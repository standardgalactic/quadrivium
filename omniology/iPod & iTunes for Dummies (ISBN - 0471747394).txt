About the Authors
Tony Bove and Cheryl Rhodes have kicked around the computer industry
for decades, editing the influential Inside Report on New Media newsletter 
and writing for weekly and monthly magazines, including Computer Currents,
NeXTWORLD, The Chicago Tribune Sunday Technology Section, and NewMedia.
They also co-founded and edited Desktop Publishing/Publish magazine. 
Tony and Cheryl have written over a dozen books on computing, desktop
publishing, and multimedia, including iLife All-in-One Desk Reference For
Dummies (Wiley), The Art of Desktop Publishing (Bantam), and a series of
books about Macromedia Director, Adobe Illustrator, and PageMaker. Tony
has also worked as a director of enterprise marketing for a large software
company, and as a communications director and technical publications man-
ager. Cheryl recently founded and served as director of a charter school and
has worked as a professional courseware designer and an instructor in com-
puter courses at elementary and high schools.
Tracing the personal computer revolution back to the Sixties counterculture,
Tony and Cheryl produced a CD-ROM interactive documentary in 1996,
Haight-Ashbury in the Sixties (featuring music from the Grateful Dead, Janis
Joplin, and the Jefferson Airplane). They also developed the Rockument
music site, www.rockument.com, with commentary and radio programs
focused on rock music history. As a founding member of the Flying Other
Brothers (www.flyingotherbros.com), Tony has performed with Hall-of-
Fame rock musicians and uses his iPod to store extensive concert recordings.


Dedication
This book is dedicated to John Paul Bove and James Eric Bove,
both of whom contributed tips and spent considerable time testing
iPods while turning a vacation into a book project. They have
earned their own iPods.
Authors’ Acknowledgments
John Paul Bove contributed technical expertise and writing for this
edition, and dedicated his Windows PC for testing versions of
iTunes and iPods. He certainly earned his new laptop.
We want to thank Rich Tennant for his wonderful cartoons. We also
want to thank our Wiley project editor Tonya Maddox Cupp, and
Editorial Manager Carol Sheehan, for ongoing assistance that made
our job so much easier. A book this timely places a considerable
burden on a publisher’s production team, and we thank the pro-
duction crew at Wiley for diligence beyond the call of reason. 
We owe thanks and a happy hour or three to Carole McLendon at
Waterside, our agent. And we have acquisitions editor Bob Woerner
at Wiley to thank for coming up with the idea for this book and help-
ing us to become professional dummies — that is, dummy authors. 
Finally, our heartfelt thanks to members of the Flying Other Brothers
(Pete Sears, Barry Sless, Jimmy Sanchez, Bill Bennett, Bert Keely,
TBone, and Roger and Ann McNamee) for the music that inspired
us while writing this book.

Introduction
Y
ou don’t need much imagination to see why we’re so happy with our
iPods.
Imagine no longer needing CDs. We take road trips that last for weeks, and we
never hear the same song twice. We leave our music library safe at home and
grab an iPod for a hike or jog and always listen to something different.
Imagine not waiting for hot new music. You can listen to it, purchase it, and
load it onto your iPod within minutes of discovering it on the Internet. Be the
first in your circle of friends to hear the exclusive new music available from
the iTunes Music Store.
Imagine not having to buy music more than once. You can purchase a CD or
downloadable music and import the music into a digital library that lasts for-
ever. Imagine never again having to replace an unplayable CD.
Imagine a musician going backstage after a performance and meeting a pro-
moter who says that he can get him ten more gigs if he can confirm the dates
right now. This musician calmly scrolls through his calendar for the entire
year (conveniently stored on his iPod), finding all the details that he needs
about gigs and recording sessions, right down to the minute, including travel
directions to each gig. “No problem,” he says. And of course, he gets the gigs.
Okay, maybe you’re not a rock star whose career depends on the information
on your iPod. But if rock stars can use them, so can average music lovers.
When we first encountered the iPod, it came very close to fulfilling our dreams
as road warriors — in particular, the dream of filling up our cars with music as
easily as filling it up with fuel. Now we use our iPod with the Alpine KCA-420i,
an in-vehicle interface adapter, which lets us plug any iPod, color-display iPod,
or iPod mini into a compatible 2004 Alpine Ai-NET head unit. That unit can 
be installed in just about any car. (It works great in a Volkswagen Passat.)
Another car integration is available for BMW cars — you can control an iPod 
or iPod mini through the BMW audio system and multifunction steering wheel.
Whether you want to be On the Road with Jack Kerouac (in audio book form),
or “Drivin’ South” with Jimi Hendrix, just fill up your iPod and go!

About This Book
We designed iPod & iTunes For Dummies, 3rd Edition, as a reference. You 
can easily find the information you need when you need it. We organized the
information so that you can read from beginning to end to find out how to
use iTunes and your iPod from scratch. But this book is also designed so that
you can dive in anywhere and begin reading because you find all the info you
need to know for each task.
We don’t cover every detail of every function of the software, and we inten-
tionally leave out some detail so that we don’t befuddle you with techno-
speak when it’s not necessary. (Really, engineers can sometimes provide too
many obscure choices that no one ever uses.) We write brief but comprehen-
sive descriptions and include lots of cool tips on how to get the best results
from using iTunes and your iPod.
If your PC is on the trailing edge rather than the leading edge, don’t worry —
you won’t miss out on the iPod revolution. True, if you don’t use Windows 2000
or Windows XP on your PC, you can’t use iTunes for Windows. However, if you
use Windows Me (Millennium Edition), you can use MusicMatch Jukebox.
Please note that if you’re using MusicMatch, you can find that content online. 
A companion Web site is available for you at www.dummies.com/go/ipod.
Conventions Used in This Book
Like any book that covers computers and information technology, this book
uses certain conventions:
 Choosing from a menu: In iTunes, when you see “Choose iTunes➪
Preferences in iTunes,” you click iTunes on the toolbar and then click
Preferences from the iTunes menu. 
With the iPod, when you see “Choose Extras➪Calendars from the iPod
main menu,” you highlight Extras in the main menu with the scroll
wheel, press the Select button to select Extras, and then highlight and
select Calendars from the Extras menu.
 Clicking and dragging: When you see “Drag the song over the name of
the playlist,” we mean click the song name, hold the mouse button
down, and drag the song with the mouse over to the name of the playlist
before lifting your finger off the mouse button.
2
iPod & iTunes For Dummies, 3rd Edition 

 Keyboard shortcuts: When you see Ô-I, press the Ô key on a Mac key-
board, along with the appropriate shortcut key. (In this case, press I,
which opens the Song Information window in iTunes.) On a Windows PC,
the same keyboard shortcut is Ctrl+I (which means press the Ctrl key
along with the I key).
 Step lists: When you come across steps you need to do in iTunes or on
the iPod, the action is in bold, and the explanatory part is underneath. If
you know what to do, read the action and skip the explanation. But if
you need a little help along the way, check out the explanation.
And Just Who Are You?
You don’t need to know anything about music or audio technology to dis-
cover how to make the most of your iPod and the iTunes software that comes
with it. Although a course in music appreciation can’t hurt, the iPod is
designed to be useful even for air-guitar players who barely know the differ-
ence between downloadable music and System of a Down. You don’t need
any specialized knowledge to have a lot of fun with your iPod and the iTunes
software while building up your digital music library.
However, we do make some honest assumptions about your computer skills:
 You know how to use the Mac Finder or Windows Explorer: We
assume that you already know how to locate files and folders and that
you can copy files and folders from one hard drive to another on the
computer of your choice: a Mac or a Windows PC.
 You know how to select menus and applications on a Mac or a
Windows PC: We assume that you already know how to choose an
option from a menu, how to find the Dock on a Mac to launch a Dock
application (or use the Start menu in Windows to launch an application),
and how to launch an application directly by double-clicking its icon.
For more information on these topics, see that excellent book by Mark L.
Chambers, Mac OS X All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies, or the massive
tome Windows XP GigaBook For Dummies, by Peter Weverka and company
(both from Wiley).

Introduction

A Quick Peek Ahead
This book is organized into six parts, with each part covering a different
aspect of using your iPod. Here’s a quick preview of what you can find in 
each part.
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music
This part gets you started with your iPod, powering it up, recharging its bat-
tery, using its menus, and connecting it to your computer. You install and set
up the iPod and iTunes software on your Mac or Windows PC. We show you
what you can do with iTunes. To acquire music, you can buy music from the
iTunes Music Store, or you can rip audio CDs. You also find out how to share
your iTunes music. 
Part II: Managing Your Music
This part shows you how to sort the music in your iTunes library by artist,
album, duration, date, and other items. You can add and edit iTunes song
information. You discover how to arrange songs and albums into iTunes
playlists that you can transfer to your iPod. When you have your music orga-
nized efficiently, transfer it to the iPod. And, for your peace of mind, we cover
backing up your music and burning it to a CD, including printing CD jewel
case inserts with the song information.
Part III: Playing Music 
We show you how to locate and play songs on your iPod and then we move
on to various accessories for connecting your iPod to your home stereo and
using your iPod on the road with car stereos and portable speakers. You 
discover how to play music on your iPod through any computer by using
advanced DJ techniques, such as cross-fading song playback and using 
the iTunes Party Shuffle. You also discover how to acquire and play videos 
in iTunes.

iPod & iTunes For Dummies, 3rd Edition 

Part IV: Using Advanced Techniques
In this part, you discover digital music encoding and how to change your
importing preferences. You can also fine-tune the sound playback with the
iTunes equalizer and on your iPod with the iPod equalizer. We describe what
you need to record sound and music into your computer from old records
and tapes, and how to modify songs in iTunes for playback on your iPod. We
cover how to enhance your iTunes library with alternate music sources and
Web radio. We also describe how to acquire and play podcasts — radio
broadcasts that you can automatically transfer to iTunes and your iPod.
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel
In this part, use your iPod as a road warrior would: setting your alarm clock,
sorting your contacts, recording voice memos, entering personal information
into your computer (such as calendar appointments, To-Do lists, and contacts),
and synchronizing your iPod with all your personal information. Use a digital
camera link to temporarily store photos on the road on your iPod and reclaim
the camera’s memory card space to take more photos. Use the color-display
iPod to show photos and slideshows on televisions. We also provide trouble-
shooting first steps and details about updating and restoring your iPod.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
In this book’s Part of Tens chapters, we outline common problems and solu-
tions that happen to most iPods and provide tips about the iPod equalizer.

sang Roger Daltrey of the Who, and the only way you can conveniently carry
that much music around while touring the Big Apple in one day is with an
Apple iPod.
Music has changed so much during the shift from purchasing music in stores
to obtaining music online that the music industry hardly recognizes it, and
the Apple iPod music player is one of the major catalysts. The iPod holds so
much music that no matter how large your music collection, you will seri-
ously consider putting all your music into digital format on your computer,
transferring portions of it to the iPod, and playing music from both your com-
puter and your iPod from now on. You might never stop buying CDs, but you
won’t have to buy all your music that way. And you’ll never again need to
replace the music that you already own.
As an iPod owner, you’re on the cutting edge of music player technology. This
chapter introduces the iPod and tells you what to expect when you open the
box. We describe how to power up your iPod and connect it to your com-
puter, both of which are essential tasks that you need to know how to do —
your iPod needs power, and your iPod needs music, which it gets from your
computer.

Introducing the iPod
The iPod is, essentially, a hard drive and a digital music player in one device,
but that device is such a thing of beauty and style and so highly recognizable
by now that all Apple needs to do in an advertisement is show it all by itself.
Even the 60GB iPod (the largest capacity as of this writing) weighs less than
two CDs in standard jewel cases, and iPod mini is smaller than a cell phone
and weighs just 3.6 ounces.
The convenience of carrying music on an iPod is phenomenal. For example,
the 60GB iPod model can hold around 15,000 songs. That’s about a month of
nonstop music played around the clock — or about one new song a day for
the next 40 years. And with the iPod’s built-in skip protection in every model,
you don’t miss a beat as you jog through the park or your car hits a pothole.
Although Apple has every right to continue to promote its Macintosh com-
puters, the company saw the wisdom of making the iPod compatible with
Windows PCs. Every iPod now comes with the software that you need to
make it work with Windows systems as well as Macintosh OS X.
A common misconception is that your iPod becomes your music library.
Actually, your iPod is simply another player for your music library, which is
safely stored on your computer. One considerable benefit of digital music
technology is that you can use your computer to serve up your music library
and make perfect-quality copies. Copy as much of it as you want onto your
iPod, and take it on the road. Two decades from now those digital songs will
be the same in quality — the music won’t be trapped on a cassette or CD that
can degrade over time (CDs can stop working after 15-20 years). The wonder-
fully remixed, remastered, reconstituted version of your favorite album can
be copied over and over forever, just like the rest of your information, and it
never loses its sound fidelity. If you save your music in digital format, you will
never lose a song and have to buy it again. 
The iPod experience includes iTunes (or, in older-generation models,
MusicMatch Jukebox), which lets you organize your music in digital form,
make copies, burn CDs, and play disc jockey without discs. Suddenly your
music world includes online music stores and free music downloads. Without
iTunes (or MusicMatch Jukebox), your iPod is merely an external hard drive.
As a result of using iTunes (or MusicMatch Jukebox), your music library is
more permanent than it ever was before because you can make backup
copies that are absolutely the same in quality. We introduce iTunes in
Chapter 2. If you’re using MusicMatch, visit the companion Web site at
www.dummies.com/go/ipod.
You’ll spend only about ten seconds copying an entire CD’s worth of music
from iTunes on your computer to your iPod. Any iPod can play any song in
10
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 

the most popular digital audio formats, including MP3, AIFF, WAV, and Apple’s
AAC format, which features CD-quality audio in smaller file sizes than MP3.
The iPod also supports the Audible AA spoken word file format.
The iPod is also a data player, perhaps the first of its kind. As an external
hard drive, the iPod serves as a portable backup device for important data
files. You can transfer your calendar and address book to help manage your
affairs on the road, and you can even use calendar event alarms to supple-
ment your iPod’s alarm and sleep timer. Although the iPod isn’t as fully func-
tional as a personal digital assistance (PDA) — for example, you can’t add
information directly to the device — you can view the information. You can
keep your calendar and address book automatically synchronized to your
computer, where you normally add and edit information. We cover using the
iPod as a data player in detail in Chapter 22 and as a general-purpose hard
drive in Chapter 23.
Comparing iPod Models
Introduced way back in the Stone Age of digital music (2001), the iPod family
has grown by four generations as of this writing, and spawned at least 19 dif-
ferent models, including a private-label version (the HPod from Hewlett-
Packard) and a custom version (iPod U2 Special Edition, featuring all of U2’s
songs). Even from the beginning, iPod models were truly innovative for their
times. With the MP3 music players of 2001, you could carry about 20 typical
songs (or a single live Phish set) with you, but the first iPod could hold more
than 1,000 typical songs (or a 50-hour Phish concert).
Today’s iPod works with iTunes on either Windows computers or Macs, but
that wasn’t always the case. The first-generation iPods work only with Macs.
In 2002, Apple introduced the second generation — one version for Windows
and another for the Mac, using the same design for both. For the third gener-
ation (2003), Apple changed the design once again.
Third-generation and fourth-generation iPods, and offshoots such as iPod
mini, iPod shuffle, and color-display iPod, work with either Windows or Mac
and come in a variety of hard-drive sizes. One way to tell what kind of iPod
you have is by its navigational controls. By design, you can hold an iPod in
your hand while you thumb the scroll wheel (our generic term for scroll
wheel, scroll pad, touch wheel, or click wheel). The LCD screen on full-size
models offers backlighting so that you can see it in the dark. 
For a nifty chart that shows the differences between iPod models, see the
“Identifying iPod different models” page on the Apple iPod Web site
(http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=61688).
11
Chapter 1: Firing Up Your iPod

First-generation iPods
Apple doesn’t sell first-generation iPods anymore, but you might see a few on
eBay. More likely, their proud owners are Mac users who still find them useful.
Despite its high price tag ($399) compared with other MP3 players, the first
5GB iPod (offering 5GB of storage space) was an unqualified success when it
was introduced in October 2001. Apple sold more than 125,000 units within
60 days. “Listening to music will never be the same again,” Apple CEO Steve
Jobs told the press at the introduction of the first iPod, and he was right.
Months later, Apple introduced the 10GB model.
First-generation iPods work only with Macs, connecting to a Mac with a stan-
dard FireWire cable. The first generation offers a distinctive scroll wheel that
physically turns with your finger as you use it. These early iPods are hefty at
6.5 ounces and have a stainless-steel back and dual-plastic top casing.
FireWire is called IEEE 1394 by the engineers who designed it and DV terminal
by camcorder manufacturers that use it, except Sony, which calls it i.Link.
These models don’t offer all the features of newer generations and can’t be
used with accessories that are designed for newer generations. For example,
you can’t expect these older models to use extensions such as voice recorders
and memory card readers. First-generation models can’t be updated to ver-
sion 2 or newer versions of the iPod software, so they also lack support for
features such as adding notes to the iPod and setting up an on-the-go playlist.
However, battery life is comparable to newer models, offering up to eight
hours before requiring a recharge. (For more about battery life, see “Facing
Charges of Battery,” later in this chapter.)
Second-generation iPods
Just as enterprising Linux and Windows developers were trying to cobble
together ways to make the iPod work with their systems, Apple introduced a
second-generation design in the form of two models: the 20GB iPod for the
Mac and the 10GB for Windows, which was supplied preformatted for
Windows. The Windows model of the second generation shipped with
MusicMatch Jukebox. 
Second-generation models use an innovative solid-state touch wheel that
doesn’t physically turn as you use it but instead responds to finger pressure.
These models use a standard FireWire connection to connect to the com-
puter with a six-pin FireWire cable.
Second-generation models can’t be updated to version 2 or 3 of the iPod
software, so they don’t offer all the features of the third and fourth generation
and can’t be used with dock-connector and voice recorder accessories designed
for third-generation and fourth-generation models. Although standard FireWire
12
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 

accessories (such as power adapters for automobiles) are available for these
models, digital camera accessories such as memory card readers are not (as
of this writing). 
Third-generation iPods
The third-generation models, many of which are still sold in stores as of this
writing, include the 10GB, 15GB, and 30GB models introduced in 2003, and the
20GB and 40GB models introduced later in that same year. All third-generation
models share the same basic features and work with the Mac or Windows,
and Apple continually provides software updates for these models. 
Models of the third generation are thinner than the second generation and use
touch-sensitive buttons with audible feedback (replacing the pressure-sensitive
buttons of the second generation that offer tactile feedback). Third-generation
models also use a dock connector to connect to a computer or power supply;
see Figure 1-1. The dock keeps your iPod in an upright position while con-
nected and lets you connect a home stereo or headphones through the dock,
which makes it convenient as a base station when you’re not traveling with
your iPod — you can slip the iPod into the dock without connecting cables. 
The dock doesn’t come standard with the 15GB model, but you can order it
as an extra from the Apple Store. 
Figure 1-1:

generation

13
Chapter 1: Firing Up Your iPod

The supplied cables connect to the dock on one end (or to the iPod itself, if
you don’t use a dock) and connect to a computer or power supply on the
other end, using standard FireWire or USB 2.0 (some models may not include
the USB cable, but you can order it from the Apple Store for about $20). (PC
users crave choice — you can read about USB in the sidebar “FireWire or
USB: That is the question” in this chapter.)
iPod mini
The iPod mini, an offshoot of the third generation, is small enough to fit in a
shirt pocket; see Figure 1-2. Its smooth, ultra-thin, anodized aluminum case
comes in five different colors. The original model houses a 4GB drive that can
hold about 1,000 songs — as much as the original 5GB model; newer models
sport a 6GB drive that holds about 1,500 songs. (An iPod mini can fit more
songs in the same amount of space because Apple introduced a better com-
pression format called AAC in second-generation models, as described in
Chapter 17. The AAC format can also be used in older models, so in effect
when Apple introduced AAC the capacity of all models increased.)

Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 

Besides its smaller size (and therefore, smaller dock), another of iPod mini’s
distinguishing characteristic is the click wheel, which offers the same func-
tions as the third-generation iPod touch wheel but is more suitable for such a
small device. The click wheel combines the scroll wheel and buttons, with
pressure-sensitive buttons underneath the top, bottom, left, and right areas
of the circular pad of the wheel.
iPod mini has the same features as full-size third-generation iPods except that
it uses a different set of accessories because of its size, and it offers up to 18
hours of battery time between charges. We describe both types of iPods and
their accessories throughout this book.
Fourth-generation and color-display iPods
In 2004 Apple introduced a fourth-generation iPod that uses the same click
wheel and buttons that iPod mini uses. Fourth-generation iPod software
includes the ability to randomly shuffle song playback with the press of a
button, and to charge up the iPod through the USB connection to your com-
puter. (Previously only FireWire connections to the computer provided
power.) The fourth-generation iPods were at first available in 40GB and 20GB
models with black-and-white displays. Currently, Apple offers 20GB and 60GB
models with color displays that can store photos and display slideshows.
The fourth-generation units with black-and-white displays offer up to 12 hours
of battery time between charges. You can play up to 15 hours of continuous
music on a color-display iPod between charges, or up to five hours of contin-
uous slideshows with music. The battery is the same type as used in other
models — the improvement is in how the software manages power in the
iPod. Like third-generation iPods, the fourth generation also uses a dock con-
nector to connect the iPod to a computer or power supply, and the dock
itself is available separately from the Apple Store. The fourth-generation
iPods connect to computers using either FireWire or USB connections.
The fourth-generation iPod models differ from earlier models by offering a
top-level Music choice in the main menu and the ability to create multiple on-
the-go playlists. You can also play audio books at slower or faster speeds
while maintaining natural-sounding pitch.
Considered a “fifth generation” by some, the iPod color display models, includ-
ing the earliest model known as iPod photo, let you store and view color digi-
tal photos as well as store and play sound; it also does everything a fourth-
generation iPod can do and uses the same accessories. As of this writing, Apple
provides a 20GB model and a whopping 60GB model that can hold up to
15,000 songs and full-color album cover art — or as many as 25,000 photos.
15
Chapter 1: Firing Up Your iPod

The 60GB iPod with color display, shown in Figure 1-3, uses the same click
wheel and buttons iPod mini uses. The color display provides crisp definition
for the iPod’s menus, making them easier to read, even in sunlight. 
The iPod color display, at 220×176-pixel resolution and over 65,000 colors,
offers excellent viewing with built-in backlighting. With the optional AV cable,
you can connect the iPod to a television monitor or video projector for a
video-quality slideshow. It even optimizes your photos to fit on a standard
(4:3 ratio) or widescreen (16:9 ratio) TV.
To get photos onto your color-display iPod, you can transfer them directly
from iPhoto on a Mac or Adobe Photoshop Elements or Adobe Album on a
Windows PC — it even synchronizes with photo albums to grab your latest
shots. And with the optional iPod Camera Connector, you can copy photos
directly from a digital camera to the iPod hard drive, saving memory card
space in your camera as you continually take more photos. iTunes also auto-
matically copies album cover art supplied with the music you buy from the
iTunes Music Store, so you can enjoy the art while playing the music.

Doing the iPod shuffle
If the regular iPod models are not small enough to fit into your lifestyle, try
the iPod shuffle, which is as much a fashion statement as a state-of-the-art
music player — this one you can wear! The iPod shuffle, shown in Figure 1-4,
is 3.3 inches long, less than 1 inch wide, and about a third of 1 inch thick —
so tiny it weighs only 0.78 of an ounce, which is little more than a car key or
pack of gum. You can hang it from your ears using the supplied earbuds and
wear it around your neck like a necklace. 
The 512MB iPod shuffle can hold 120 songs, and the 1GB model can hold 240
songs — assuming an average of 4 minutes per song, using the AAC format at
the High Quality setting (as described in Chapter 17). Remember, the iPod
shuffle is not for storing music permanently — you use it just to play selec-
tions from your iTunes library on your computer. It has no display, but that’s
actually a good thing, because it keeps the size and weight down to a mini-
mum — and you don’t need a display to play a couple of hundred songs in
random or sequential order. You can also use your iPod shuffle to hold data
files, just like an external flash memory drive.

Chapter 1: Firing Up Your iPod

With skip-free playback, lightweight design, and no need for a display, you
can easily use it while skiing, snowboarding, or even skydiving (and if you’re
at a high altitude, try “Expecting to Fly” by Buffalo Springfield, or “Astral
Traveling” by Pharoah Sanders). That’s because it uses flash memory rather
than a hard drive — you can shake it as hard as you want without a glitch.
The iPod shuffle’s battery, similar to those used in other fourth-generation
iPods, offers up to 12 hours of power between charges. 
Unlike other iPods, the iPod shuffle can’t play tunes in the AIFF or Apple
Lossless formats, which consume a lot of storage space but are higher in sonic
quality. You can play songs in the AAC format (including songs from the online
iTunes Music Store) or the MP3 format. These formats compress the music to
use much less space. You can also use the Audible book format and the uncom-
pressed WAV format. See Chapter 17 for more details on encoding formats.
To turn on the iPod shuffle, use the three-position toggle switch on the back; a
green stripe below the switch helps you see what position the switch is in.
The top position turns the iPod shuffle off; the middle position starts playing
the list of songs from beginning to end in sequential order; and the bottom
position shuffles through songs randomly — you don’t know what song will
come next, and that’s its appeal. You may want a little randomness in your life. 
Using the buttons on the front side that look like standard CD-player buttons,
you can skip forward to the next song or skip back to the previous one. The
center button either starts or pauses playback. The plus (+) button turns the
volume up, and the minus (-) button turns it down.
The iPod shuffle shines a yellow LED on the front side to show when the player
is charging, and a green LED when the shuffle is completely charged. A blinking
green LED indicates that the player is on pause. On the back side just below
the toggle switch is a Battery Status button that, when pressed, flashes an LED
that indicates how much battery juice remains: Green is a good charge, yellow
a low charge, and red a very low charge. No glow means no power remains.
Underneath the cap on the tip of the iPod shuffle is a convenient USB 2.0 con-
nector that links the iPod shuffle to a computer or to an optional power
supply and supplies power for recharging its battery. You don’t need a sepa-
rate cable. The iPod shuffle charges its battery from your computer, so you
don’t need the optional power supply. You can also get the optional $29 iPod
shuffle External Battery Pack, which provides 20 additional hours of playtime
with two AAA batteries.
Thinking Inside the Box
Don’t destroy the elegantly designed box while opening it; you might want to
place it prominently in your collection of Equipment That Ushered in the 21st
18
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 

Century. Before going any further, check the box and make sure that all the
correct parts came with your iPod.
Things you have and things you need
The iPod box includes a CD-ROM with the iTunes software for the Mac and
PC and the FireWire or USB cable you can use to connect your iPod to a com-
puter. All models (except the iPod shuffle) come with AC power adapter for
connecting either the older iPod (using FireWire) or the newer iPod-in-dock
to an AC power source.
With most models, you also get a set of earbud headphones and a remote con-
troller that connects to the iPod by wire. The accessories don’t stop there —
you might also have a carrying case and some other goodies. Optional acces-
sories, many of which we describe in this book, are available at the online
Apple Store (www.apple.com/store).
You also need a few things that don’t come with the iPod:
 A PC or Mac to run iTunes: On a PC, iTunes requires Windows 2000 or
XP, a 500-MHz Pentium-class processor or faster, and a minimum of
128MB (256MB or more recommended). With a Mac, iTunes requires
Mac OS X 10.2.8 or newer for connecting with FireWire (OS X 10.3.4 or
newer for connecting via USB or for using AirPort Express), a 400-MHz
G3 processor or better and at least 256MB of RAM. The iTunes installer
for the PC also installs the newest version of QuickTime, replacing any
older version you may have. Macs have QuickTime preinstalled; how-
ever, you may need to upgrade your version of QuickTime to 6.5.2 (cur-
rent as of this writing) or newer to use purchased music from the iTunes
Music Store in other iLife applications on a Mac.
 A PC to run MusicMatch Jukebox (alternative to iTunes): You can
alternatively use the iPod with MusicMatch Jukebox and a 300 MHz or
faster PC with at least 96MB of RAM running Windows Me, 2000, or XP
(with at least 128MB of RAM). If you’re using MusicMatch, visit the com-
panion Web site at www.dummies.com/go/ipod.
 FireWire or USB connection on a PC: PCs running Windows must have
either FireWire (also called IEEE 1394) or USB 2.0. All Macs provide USB
and most provide FireWire — it’s your choice. See the sidebar “FireWire
or USB: That is the question” in this chapter for more information about
FireWire and USB 2.0 connections on PCs.
 FireWire cable (alternative to USB): While older iPod models came
with a FireWire cable, current color-display iPods are supplied with just
a USB cable for connecting to either a Mac or a PC. You can use a
FireWire connection on either a Mac or PC by using a FireWire cable,
available from the Apple Store.
19
Chapter 1: Firing Up Your iPod

 iTunes 4.9 or newer: You can download Mac or Windows versions for
free from the Apple Web site (www.apple.com/itunes). The CD-ROM
supplied with current-model iPods should have both versions of iTunes
as well. Older models, still available in stores and online, may include
versions of iTunes as old as version 4.5 — which is fine, because version
4.5 works. (It just doesn’t have all the features of 4.9.) You can download
version 4.9 or newer versions at any time to replace it. 
 MusicMatch Jukebox for PCs (alternative to iTunes): CD-ROMs sup-
plied with some older iPod models provided MusicMatch Jukebox
instead. You can use MusicMatch Jukebox if you don’t meet the require-
ments to run iTunes.
 Applications for managing contacts and calendars (Optional): Mac
users can install Address Book (for managing contacts) and iCal (for
managing calendars), both of which can synchronize your iPod with con-
tacts and calendars. Both are available for free from www.apple.com.
Windows users can use Outlook or Outlook Express for creating a con-
tacts list and calendars for an iPod.
Using FireWire or USB cables with a Mac
If you have a Mac, the choice is easy: FireWire has been a part of every Mac
since at least 2000. (To find out about FireWire, see the sidebar “FireWire or
USB: That is the question” in this chapter.) However, differences exist
between iPod generations.
Current (third-generation and fourth-generation) models, including iPod mini
and color-display models, offer a special cable with a flat dock connector to
connect the dock — or the iPod itself — to the Mac’s FireWire or USB port. The
dock includes a cable with a flat dock connector on one end and a FireWire or
USB connector on the other (some cables have both FireWire and USB). You
can connect the FireWire or USB end of the cable to the computer (to synchro-
nize with iTunes and play iPod music in iTunes) or to the power adapter.
The connection on the bottom of the iPod is the same as the connection on
back of the dock. Plug the flat connector of the cable into the iPod or dock,
and then plug the six-pin FireWire connector on the other end to the FireWire
port on your Mac (marked by the Y symbol that resembles a radiation
symbol), or plug the USB connector to the USB port on your Mac.
20
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 

The full-size third-generation iPods don’t support USB 2.0 on the Mac, but
iPod mini and fourth-generation models support it if your Mac offers USB 2.0,
and a USB cable is provided. You need OS X 10.3.4 for connecting via USB 2.0
to a Mac.
The iPod shuffle offers only a USB connector: Remove the cap from one end
and connect it directly to the USB or USB 2.0 connection on your Mac. You
can also use an iPod shuffle Dock or a USB extension cable (available from
Apple at www.ipod.com/store).
First-generation and second-generation models offer only a standard FireWire
connection, so you can use a standard Mac-style FireWire cable to connect
the iPod to the Mac’s FireWire connection. Plug the six-pin connector of a
standard FireWire cable into the iPod, and plug the six-pin connector on the
other end to the FireWire port on your Mac. (The six-pin connector is marked
by the Y symbol that resembles a radiation symbol.)
Using FireWire or USB cables with a PC
If you have a Windows PC you can use FireWire (called IEEE 1394 in PC cir-
cles), or USB 2.0 (a.k.a. high-powered USB), which is available on most current
desktop PCs and laptops. While you can use a low-powered USB connection,
it doesn’t supply power to most iPod models, and performs too slowly. 
FireWire/IEEE 1394 expansion cards are available in various formats: Some
offer the standard six-pin port found on Macs, and some offer a four-pin port
that is also used in camcorders. If your card has a six-pin port, you can plug
your iPod cable directly into it.
For cards with four-pin ports, Apple provides the FireWire cable adapter, as
shown in Figure 1-5, and you can hook it up to the standard six-pin connector
at the end of your FireWire cable. The small four-pin connector on the adapter
plugs into the four-pin port on the FireWire card. Then plug the other end of
your cable to your iPod or your dock. You can purchase a special FireWire/
IEEE 1394 cable that has a six-pin plug on one end and a four-pin plug on the
other — look for it in well-stocked electronics stores that sell digital cam-
corders, as many camcorders use such a cable.
21
Chapter 1: Firing Up Your iPod

The FireWire cable adapter is supplied with full-size fourth-generation iPods
but not with iPod mini or color-display iPod. You can purchase one from the
Apple Store. 
If you use USB 2.0 with your PC, you can use the USB 2.0 cable supplied with
your iPod or iPod mini. The USB 2.0 cable has a flat dock connector on one
end and a USB 2.0 connector on the other. Apple also offers a combination
FireWire/USB 2.0 cable with a dock connector on one end and a cable that
forks into two connectors — one for FireWire and one for USB 2.0.
Don’t use another USB device in a chain, or a USB 2.0 hub, to connect your
iPod — unless the hub is a powered hub. Note that a USB keyboard acts like a
hub, but is not powered. Therefore it wouldn’t provide power to the iPod.
The iPod shuffle offers only a USB connector: Remove the cap from one end
and connect it directly to the USB or USB 2.0 connection on your PC. You can
also use an iPod shuffle Dock or a USB extension cable (available from Apple
at www.ipod.com/store).
Powering Up Your iPod
All iPods come with essentially the same requirement: power. Fortunately, it
also comes with a battery and a way of charging it — either directly from
your computer, or using a cable and an AC power adapter that works with
Figure 1-5:

necting to a

Chapter 1: Firing Up Your iPod
FireWire or USB: That is the question
If you use a Mac, FireWire is the choice to make
unless your Mac offers USB 2.0 and you’re
using an iPod mini, color-display iPod, or iPod
shuffle — all three of which support USB 2.0.
The iPod shuffle supports only USB and USB
2.0, so you have no choice but to use the USB
or USB 2.0 connection.
If you use a PC, you can choose between
FireWire and USB 2.0 depending on which one
you already have and whether you need to use
the connections for something else.
Why so complicated? It’s a question of speed
and convenience. FireWire can hustle data at
rates up to 400 Mbps over its cable. That’s typi-
cally fast enough — with FireWire, you can
transfer an entire CD’s worth of music in less
than ten seconds.
But engineers are never happy; they keep
making things better. USB (Universal Serial Bus)
has been around for a while, connecting hun-
dreds of nifty devices to PCs. Such nifty devices
include keyboards, pointing devices, external
hard drives, keychain-sized flash drives, print-
ers, scanners, and much more. USB proponents
envied FireWire, which is more than 30 times
faster than USB version 1.1, which offers a
speed of only 12 Mbps. So they developed a
more advanced generation of USB. Version 2.0
has a transfer rate of 480 Mbps — that’s 40
times faster than the first version — but since
USB in practice does not sustain that rate for
the entire data transfer, as FireWire does,
FireWire is still a wee bit faster.
Both FireWire and USB 2.0 connections are
plug-and-play: You can plug them in at any time
whether your computer is on or off. Depending
on the device that you use with these connec-
tions, FireWire or USB 2.0 can provide power to
the device. For example, fourth-generation
iPods, the iPod shuffle, and the color-display
iPod can draw power from a USB 2.0 connection.
The horse race between FireWire and USB 2.0
has left some computers in the dust, such as
older Macs and PCs. Many Mac models now
sport USB 2.0 connectors, but for many older
Mac users, FireWire is the only choice. Many
desktop PCs and laptops offer PCI and/or
CardBus slots for adding FireWire or USB 2.0
cards, and some PCs offer built-in FireWire or
USB 2.0.
Have we made your choice easier yet? If you
have a PC with USB 2.0 (which is more common
than one with FireWire), go with it. The only
drawback is that with an iPod older than the
fourth generation, you might not be able to get
power from the connection (depending on the
PC), so you wouldn’t be able to recharge its bat-
tery from your PC.
You can add FireWire to your PC with an expan-
sion card such as the FireCard 400 CardBus
card from Unibrain (www.unibrain.com),
which plugs into a PC desktop or laptop
CardBus slot. Laptop PCs made as far back as
1999 offer CardBus slots. Desktop PCs typically
let you add expansion cards inside the PC, and
there are many IEEE 1394 expansion cards
available on the market. Before you buy a
FireWire/IEEE 1394 card, make sure that it’s
compatible with your hardware and operat-
ing system. Apple offers approved FireWire
expansion cards at the online Apple Store
(http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-
APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore).
If you have trouble installing your FireWire or
USB 2.0 card or using your iPod with it, see
Chapter 27 for troubleshooting tips.

voltages in North America and many parts of Europe and Asia. (See Chapter
15 for information about plugging into power in other countries.)
First-generation and second-generation iPod models offer a Mac-style FireWire
connection on the top of the iPod. The power adapter also sports a FireWire
connection, so all you need is a standard six-pin FireWire cable to plug in.
Third-generation and fourth-generation models, color-display iPods, and iPod
minis can use a dock that offers FireWire and USB connections. The dock can
also connect to your home stereo through a line-out connection.
A FireWire connection to a Mac provides power to the iPod and recharges the
battery as long as the Mac isn’t in sleep mode. A FireWire connection to a
FireWire/IEEE 1394 card in a PC might not be able to provide power — check
with the card manufacturer. The smaller 4-pin connections for FireWire/IEEE
1394 cards typically don’t supply power to the iPod.
If your iPod shows a display but doesn’t respond to your touch, don’t panic —
check the Hold switch on top of the unit and make sure that it’s set to one
side so that the orange bar disappears (the normal position). You use the
Hold switch for locking the buttons, which prevents accidental activation.
You might notice that the iPod’s display turns iridescent when it gets too hot
or too cold, but this effect disappears when its temperature returns to normal.
iPods can function in temperatures as cold as 50 degrees and as warm as 95
degrees (Fahrenheit) but work best at room temperature (closer to 68 degrees).
If you leave your iPod out in the cold all night, it might have trouble waking
from sleep mode, and it might even display a low battery message. Plug the
iPod into a power source, wait until it warms up, and try it again. If it still
doesn’t wake up or respond properly, try resetting the iPod as we describe in
“Resetting Your iPod,” later in this chapter.
Facing Charges of Battery
You can take a six-hour flight from New York City to California and listen to
your iPod the entire time — and with some models, listen all the way back on
the return flight, without recharging. All iPod models use the same type of
built-in rechargeable lithium-ion battery with the following power specs:
 The first-, second-, and third-generation iPod models offer up to eight
hours of battery power.
 The fourth-generation models and the iPod shuffle offer up to 12 hours.
24
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 

 The iPod mini offers up to 18 hours.
 The color-display iPod models offer 15 hours of music playing time or 
5 hours of photo display with music.
However, keep in mind that playback battery time varies with the type of
encoder that you use for the music files in iTunes — Chapter 17 has more
information about encoders. It also varies depending on how you use your
iPod controls and settings.
The iPod battery recharges automatically when you connect the iPod to a
power source — for example, it starts charging immediately when you insert
it into a dock that’s connected to a power source (or to a computer with a
powered FireWire connection). It takes only four hours to recharge the bat-
tery fully for all models.
Need power when you’re on the run? Look for a power outlet in the airport
terminal or hotel lobby — the battery fast-charges to 80-percent capacity in
two hours. After the first two hours, the battery receives a trickle charge for
the next two hours, until fully charged. 
Don’t fry your iPod with some generic power adapter — use only the power
adapter supplied with the iPod from Apple.
A battery icon in the top-right corner of the iPod display indicates with a
progress bar how much power is left. When you charge the battery, the icon
turns into a lightning bolt inside a battery. If the icon doesn’t animate, the
battery is fully charged. You can also use your iPod while the battery is
charging, or disconnect it and use it before the battery is fully charged.
To check the battery status of an iPod shuffle, press the battery status button
on the back (the long button above the Apple logo and below the position
switch). If the battery status light is green, the iPod shuffle is fully charged; if
yellow, the charge is low; if red, very little charge is left and you need to
recharge it. If no light is visible, the iPod shuffle is completely out of power
and you need to recharge it to use it.
Maintaining battery life
The iPod’s built-in rechargeable lithium-ion battery is, essentially, a life-or-
death proposition. After it’s dead, it can be replaced, but the replacement
may cost more than $50 (some services may charge less for older models). If
your warranty is still active, you should have Apple replace it — don’t do it
yourself because opening the iPod invalidates the warranty. 
25
Chapter 1: Firing Up Your iPod

Fortunately the battery is easy to maintain. We recommend calibrating the
battery once soon after you get your iPod — that is, run it all the way down
(a full discharge) and then charge it all the way up (which takes four hours).
Although this doesn’t actually change battery performance, it does improve
the battery gauge so that the iPod displays a more accurate indicator.
Unlike nickel-based batteries that require you to fully discharge and then
recharge in order to get a fuller capacity, the iPod lithium-ion battery prefers
a partial rather than a full discharge, so avoid frequent full discharges after
the initial calibration (frequent full discharges can lower battery life). 
Lithium-ion batteries typically last three years or more and are vulnerable to
high temperatures, which decrease their life spans considerably. Don’t leave
your iPod in a hot place, such as on a sunny car dashboard, for very long.
For a complete description of how Apple’s lithium-ion batteries work, see the
Apple — Batteries page at www.apple.com/batteries. 
The bottom of the iPod warms up when it’s powered on. The bottom functions
as a cooling surface that transfers heat from inside the unit to the cooler air
outside. The iPod’s carrying case acts as an insulator, so be sure to remove
the iPod from its carrying case before you recharge it.
Keeping the iPod encased in its carrying case when charging is tempting but
also potentially disastrous. The iPod needs to dissipate its heat, and you
could damage the unit by overheating it and frying its circuits, rendering it as
useful as a paperweight. To get around this problem, you can purchase one of
the heat-dissipating carrying cases available in the Apple Store. For example,
Marware (www.marware.com) offers the SportSuit Convertible case ($39.95).
Even when not in use, your iPod drinks the juice. If your iPod is inactive for
14 days, you must recharge its battery — perhaps the iPod gets depressed
from being left alone too long. 
Saving power
Full-size iPods include a hard drive, and whatever causes the hard drive to
spin causes a drain on power. Your iPod also has a cache — a memory chip
holding the section of music to play next. The iPod uses the cache not only to
eliminate skipping when something jostles the hard drive but also to con-
serve power because the drive doesn’t have to spin as much.
If you use the AIFF or WAV formats for importing music into iTunes (or
MusicMatch Jukebox), don’t use these formats with your iPod — convert the
music first, as we describe in Chapter 20. These formats take up way too
much space on the iPod hard drive and fill up the iPod cache too quickly,
causing skips when you play them and using too much battery power
26
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 

because the drive spins more often. (See Chapter 5 for importing with iTunes.
Chapter 17 provides detailed information about these formats.)
The following are tips on power saving while using your iPod:
 Pause: Pause playback when you’re not listening. Pausing (stopping)
playback is the easiest way to conserve power.
 Back away from the light: Use the iPod backlight sparingly. Select
Backlight from the iPod main menu to turn it on or off, or turn the
Backlight Timer setting to a number of seconds, or to Off, in the iPod’s
Settings menu. (Choose Settings from the main menu.) Don’t use the
backlight in daylight if you don’t need it.
 Hold it: Flip the Hold switch to the lock position (with the orange bar
showing) to make sure that controls aren’t accidentally activated. You
don’t want your iPod playing music in your pocket and draining the bat-
tery when you’re not listening.
 You may continue: Play songs continuously without using the iPod con-
trols. Selecting songs and using Previous/Rewind and Next/Fast-Forward
requires precious energy. Not only that, but the hard drive has to spin
more often when searching for songs, using more power than during
continuous playback.
Always use the latest iPod software and update your software when updates
come out. Apple is always trying to improve the way your iPod works, and
many of these advancements relate to power usage.
Replacing your battery
Apple customers aren’t always happy campers. Early iPods came with batter-
ies that couldn’t be replaced, but all it took were a few premature battery fail-
ures and quite a few customer complaints for Apple to institute a battery
replacement service. Apple also offers a special AppleCare warranty for iPods.
You can’t remove or replace the iPod internal battery yourself — you need
Apple to replace it if it dies.
If your iPod isn’t responding after a reset (see “Resetting Your iPod” in this
chapter for how to reset your iPod), follow the troubleshooting steps in
Chapter 27. If these steps don’t restore your iPod to working condition, you
might have a battery problem. Go to the Apple support page for the iPod
(www.apple.com/support/ipod) and click the iPod service FAQ link to read
frequently asked questions and answers about iPod support. Then click the
iPod battery service request form link on the support page and follow the
instructions to request service and return your iPod for a replacement.
27
Chapter 1: Firing Up Your iPod

The only time we had to do this (with a 30GB iPod), Apple required us to
send just the iPod unit itself, without the power adapter or any other acces-
sories, to Apple’s service facility. Within a week, Apple sent back a brand new
iPod (same model).
Thumbing Through the Menus
After you import music into the iPod, you’re ready to play music. The design
of the iPod lets you hold it in one hand and perform simple operations by
thumb. Even if you’re all thumbs when pressing small buttons on tiny devices,
you can still thumb your way to iPod heaven.
The iPod’s unique circular scroll wheel makes scrolling through an entire music
collection quick and easy. With your finger or thumb, scroll clockwise on the
wheel to scroll down a list, or counter-clockwise to scroll up. As you scroll,
options on the menu are highlighted. Use the Select button at the center of the
scroll wheel to select whatever is highlighted in the menu display. 
In full-size third-generation models, the touch-sensitive buttons above the scroll
wheel perform simple functions when you touch them. (First-generation and
second-generation models aren’t touch-sensitive, so you need to press them.)
iPod mini and fourth-generation iPods, including color-display models, pro-
vide a click wheel that offers the same functions as the scroll wheel and the
clickable buttons. It has pressure-sensitive buttons underneath the top,
bottom, left, and right areas of the circular pad of the wheel. These areas tilt
as you press them, activating the buttons.
The iPod main menu for fourth-generation color-display models, shown in
Figure 1-6, offers the following selections:
 Music: Select music by playlist, artist, album, song, genre, or composer,
or select an audio book.
 Photos: Select photos by photo album or select individual photos in the
photo library. This selection appears only on color-display models.
 Extras: View and set the clock and alarm clock, view contacts, view your
calendar, view notes, and play games.
 Settings: Set display settings, menu settings, the backlight timer, the
clicker, and the date and time.
 Shuffle Songs: Play songs from your music library in random order.
 Backlight: Turn on or off the backlighting for the iPod display.
 Now Playing: This appears only when a song is playing — it takes you to
the Now Playing display.

clicker, and the date and time.
 Backlight: Turn on or off the backlighting for the iPod display.
 Now Playing: This appears only when a song is playing — it takes you to
the Now Playing display.
Pressing the iPod Buttons
The buttons on full-size iPod models do various tasks for song playback:
 Previous/Rewind: Press once to start a song over. Press twice to skip to
the previous song. Press and hold to rewind through a song.
 Menu: Press once to go back to the previous menu. Each time you press,
you go back to a previous menu until you reach the main menu. 
 Play/Pause: Press to play the selected song, album, or playlist. Press
Play/Pause when a song is playing to pause the playback.
 Next/Fast-Forward: Press once to skip to the next song. Press and hold
Next/Fast-Forward to fast-forward through the song.

Chapter 1: Firing Up Your iPod

The buttons and scroll wheel on full-size iPods can do more complex func-
tions when used in combination:
 Turn on the iPod. Press any button.
 Turn off the iPod. Press and hold the Play/Pause button.
 Disable the iPod buttons. To keep from accidentally pressing the but-
tons, push the Hold switch to the other side so that an orange bar
appears (the Hold position). To reactivate the iPod buttons, push the
Hold switch back to the other side so that the orange bar disappears
(the normal position).
 Reset the iPod. Set the Hold switch to the Hold position, and then move
it back to normal. Then, on first-, second-, or third-generation iPods or
iPod mini, press the Menu and Play/Pause buttons simultaneously for
about five seconds until the Apple logo appears in the iPod display; for
fourth-generation and color-display iPods, press the Menu and Select
buttons simultaneously for six seconds. You can reset the iPod if it gets
hung up for some reason. (For example, it might get confused if you
press the buttons too quickly.) This operation resets the iPod, essen-
tially restarting the iPod’s hard drive. It doesn’t change the music or
data on the iPod. See “Resetting Your iPod,” later in this chapter.

 Change the volume. While playing a song (the display reads Now
Playing), adjust the volume with the scroll wheel — clockwise turns the
volume up, counterclockwise turns the volume down. A volume slider
appears on the iPod display, indicating the volume level as you scroll.
 Skip to any point in a song. While playing a song (the display says Now
Playing), press and hold the Select button until the progress bar appears
to indicate where you are in the song, and then use the scroll wheel to
scroll to any point in the song. Scroll clockwise to move forward, and
counterclockwise to move backward.
Setting the Language
Wiedergabelisten? Übersicht? (Playlists? Browse?) If your iPod is speaking in
a foreign tongue, don’t panic — you’re not in the wrong country. You might
have purchased an iPod that’s set to a foreign language. More likely, someone
set it to a different language accidentally or on purpose (as a practical joke).
Fortunately, you can change the setting without having to know the language
that it’s set to.
To set the language, no matter what language the menu is using, follow 
these steps:
1. Press the Menu button repeatedly until pressing it doesn’t change the
words on the display, or until you see the word iPod.
If pressing the Menu button no longer changes the display, you’re at 
the main menu. With fourth-generation models, the menu displays iPod
no matter what language is selected — and you know you’re at the 
main menu.
2. Choose the third option from the top on fourth-generation iPods with-
out color displays. Choose the fourth option from the top on iPod
mini, iPod models with color displays, and older models. (In English,
this is the Settings option.)
Scroll clockwise until the item is highlighted, and then press the Select
button. The Settings menu appears.
3. Choose the third option from the bottom of the Settings menu (which,
in English, is the Language option).
The Language menu appears.
4. Choose the language that you want to use. (English is at the top of 
the list.)
31
Chapter 1: Firing Up Your iPod

If these steps don’t do the trick, the menu may have been customized (some-
thing you can discover how to do in Chapter 22). Someone could have cus-
tomized it previously, or perhaps you accidentally pressed buttons that
customized the menu. To get around this problem, you can reset all the iPod
settings back to the defaults. (Unfortunately, resetting your iPod settings back
to the defaults wipes out any customizations that you’ve made; you have to
redo any repeat/shuffle settings, alarms, backlight timer settings, and so on.)
Follow these steps to reset all your settings, no matter what language displays:
1. Press the Menu button repeatedly until pressing it doesn’t change the
words on the display, or until you see the word iPod.
If pressing the Menu button no longer changes the display, you’re at 
the main menu. With fourth-generation models, the menu displays iPod
no matter what language is selected — and you know you’re at the 
main menu.
2. Choose the third option from the top on fourth-generation iPods with-
out color displays. Choose the fourth option from the top on iPod
mini, iPod models with color displays, and older models. (In English,
this is the Settings option.)
The Settings menu appears.
3. Choose the option at the bottom of the menu (in English, the Reset All
Settings option).
The Reset All Settings menu appears.
4. Choose the second menu option (in English, the Reset option; the first
menu option is Cancel).
The Language menu appears.
5. Choose the language you want to use. (English is at the top of the list.)
The language you choose now applies to all the iPod menus. But don’t pull
that practical joke on someone else!
Resetting Your iPod
If your iPod doesn’t turn on, don’t panic — at least not yet. First check the
Hold switch’s position on top of the iPod. If it’s in the locked position (with
orange showing), slide it to the normal position. If it still doesn’t work, check
whether the iPod has enough juice. Is the battery charged up? Connect the
iPod to a power source and see whether it works.
32
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 

There are times when your iPod freezes up or seems confused, and it just
won’t start up. Pressing more than one iPod button at the same time might
have caused this problem, or perhaps you disconnected the iPod from your
computer before it had a chance to display the iPod’s main menu (or in older
models, the message saying it’s okay to disconnect). In situations like this,
you can reset the iPod.
Resetting the iPod isn’t the same as resetting the settings of your iPod. If all
you need to do is reset the settings on the Settings menu, you can choose
Settings➪Reset All Settings➪Reset from the main menu. (We cover the set-
tings on the Settings menu in Chapter 22.) All your menu and display settings
return to their original values.
This section is about a different kind of reset — similar to pressing a reset
button on a computer. This operation resets the operating system of the iPod
and restarts the system. Sometimes when your iPod gets confused or refuses
to turn on, you can fix it by resetting it. Follow these steps:
1. Toggle the Hold switch to the locked position and then back to the
unlocked position.
This step is like the beginning of a secret handshake.
2. On fourth-generation models, including color-display models, press
the Menu and Select buttons simultaneously. 
On older models, press the Menu and Play/Pause buttons simultaneously. 
3. Hold these buttons for at least six seconds until the Apple logo
appears; then release the buttons when you see the Apple logo.
The appearance of the Apple logo signals that your iPod is resetting
itself, so you no longer have to hold down the buttons. 
Releasing the Menu and Select buttons (or Play/Pause on older models)
as soon as you see the Apple logo is important. If you continue to hold
down the buttons after the logo appears, the iPod displays the low bat-
tery icon (which looks like a slashed battery), and you must connect it
to a power source before using your iPod again. 
Set your iPod on a flat surface to press multiple buttons more easily. Make
sure that when you press the Select button, you don’t touch any part of the
click wheel. Also make sure that you’re pressing the Menu button toward the
outside of the click wheel, and not near the center.
After resetting, everything should be back to normal, including your music
and data files.

In This Chapter

 Installing iPod software for Windows
A
n iPod without iTunes is like a CD player without CDs. Sure, you can use
utility programs from sources other than Apple to put music on an iPod.
(See Chapter 26 if you don’t believe us.) But iTunes gives you access to the
vast online iTunes Music Store, and it’s excellent for managing music on your
computer and synchronizing your music library with your iPod.
On the Mac, iTunes is practically the only jukebox in town — it’s not profitable
to compete with something that’s free. And yet, Apple hasn’t abused its posi-
tion by putting out a less-than-functional program. On Windows, iTunes has
plenty of competition but is still one of the top five audio players. 
This chapter explains how to set up your iPod with iTunes on the Mac or for
Windows. It also explains how to set up the iPod Software, which provides
the intelligence inside your iPod. With a history of 19 different model configu-
rations and 10 different software configurations, getting the right iPod
Software for your iPod would be downright confusing if Apple didn’t provide
one downloadable installer that takes care of everything. Fortunately, Apple
provides exactly that: an updater/installer each for Mac and Windows that
recognizes the type of iPod you have and installs the correct software.

Setting Up iTunes
As a Mac user, you probably already have iTunes installed because all Macs
sold since 2003 (and many before that time) are preinstalled with iTunes and
Mac OS X, and you also get iTunes if you install Mac OS X on an older machine.
The most up-to-date version of iTunes as of this writing is version 4.8. If
you’ve never used iTunes before, when you first launch it, you automatically
get the iTunes Setup Assistant.
The version of iTunes that’s provided with your iPod on a CD-ROM might be
the newest version; then again, it might not be. Software updates occur very
rapidly. If you really want the latest version, go directly to the Apple Web site
to get it. You can download iTunes for free. Install iTunes first, and then
install the iPod software.
You can set your Mac to automatically download the latest version of iTunes
when it becomes available. Simply use Software Update from the Mac OS X
System Preferences window. Click the Check Now button to check for a new
version. If one exists, it appears in a window for you to select. Click the check
mark to select it, and then click Install to download and install it.
If you use a PC with Windows, you most likely don’t have iTunes yet. Go
directly to the Apple Web site and download the latest version.
iPods that were sold before iTunes became available for Windows (in the fall
of 2003) don’t include iTunes on the CD-ROM. The older iPod CD-ROMs install
MusicMatch Jukebox. If you plan on using iTunes for Windows, which requires
Windows XP or Windows 2000, download the newer iTunes and iPod installers
from the Apple Web site. If you’re using MusicMatch, visit the companion
Web site at www.dummies.com/go/ipod.
When you get your iPod, you might be tempted to go ahead and install from
the CD-ROM. Our experience, especially with Windows PCs, is that you’re
better off going to the Apple Web site first and downloading the latest ver-
sions of the iTunes and iPod installers for Windows. Install iTunes first, and
then install the iPod software.
To download iTunes for Mac or Windows, go to the Apple iTunes page on 
the Web (www.apple.com/itunes), select the appropriate version (Mac or
Windows), and then click the Download iTunes button, as shown in Figure 2-1.
Follow the instructions to download the installer to your hard drive. Pick a
location on your hard drive to save the installer.
36
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 

Setting up iTunes on a Mac
If you downloaded the iTunes installer, launch the installer to unpack and
install iTunes. To install iTunes from the CD-ROM, open the iTunes folder on
the CD-ROM, and then double-click the iTunes package file (it has an .mpkg
extension) to unpack and install it. Then follow these steps:
1. Click Continue after the installer’s Welcome page.
The installer needs to run a program to check your computer and make
sure it’s capable of running iTunes. 
2. Read the Important Information page and click Continue.
The installer displays important “read me” information about the latest
iTunes features. Click Continue after reading it, or if you like, click the
Save button to save the Important Information page as a document, the
Print button to print it, or the Go Back button to quit the installer.
3. Click Continue and then click the Agree button for Apple’s License
Agreement.
Apple’s License Agreement appears in the installer. 
Figure 2-1:

37
Chapter 2: Setting Up iTunes and Your iPod

Optional: Before you click the Agree button, you have a few other
options. You can click the Save button to save the license agreement as a
document, the Print button to print it, the Decline button to quit iTunes
immediately, or simply go with the Agree button. No lawyers are present
when you do this; it’s all up to you. 
4. Select the destination volume for iTunes.
The installer asks for the destination volume (hard drive), as shown in
Figure 2-2, which must be a Mac OS X startup drive — any other drive is
marked by a red exclamation point indicating that you can’t install iTunes
there. iTunes is installed in the Applications folder on the Mac OS X
startup drive. 
5. Click Install to proceed with the installation.
As an alternative, you can customize your installation by clicking
Customize, selecting each package you want to install, and then 
clicking Install.
6. Click Done when the installer finishes.
Mac users can proceed by directly launching iTunes and setting it up with the
iTunes Setup Assistant. Follow these steps:
1. Launch iTunes by double-clicking the iTunes application or clicking
the iTunes icon in the Dock.
2. Click Next in the iTunes Setup Assistant opening page.
The iTunes Setup Assistant takes you through the process of setting up
iTunes for the Internet. After clicking Next, the iTunes Setup Assistant
displays a window with questions, shown in Figure 2-3.
Figure 2-2:

38
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 

3. Select Yes or No to answer the following questions:
• Would you like to use iTunes to handle audio content from the
Internet?
We suggest selecting Yes, allowing iTunes to organize and play all
audio content, because iTunes offers more features than you typi-
cally find with browser plug-ins from other companies. On the
other hand, if you’re happy with your plug-ins and helper applica-
tions, select No and leave your Internet settings untouched.
• Do you want iTunes to automatically connect to the Internet when
it’s necessary?
If you use an always-on broadband Internet service, you probably want
iTunes to connect automatically, and you can select Yes. If you use a
dial-up modem, if your Internet service is intermittently off, or if your
Internet service charges when you use it, you probably don’t want this
connection to be automatic. Selecting No forces iTunes to ask first.
After you click Next, the iTunes Setup Assistant also asks another question:
• Do you want iTunes to search your Home folder for music files?
You might want to click the “No, I’ll add them later myself” selection for
now, because iTunes might find files that you don’t want to add to your
library (such as music for games).
4. When the assistant asks whether you want to go straight to the iTunes
Music Store, select either Yes or No. Then click Done.
We suggest selecting No. However, if you can’t wait to go shopping,
Chapter 4 gives you the scoop on the iTunes Music Store.
After clicking Done, the iTunes window appears. (We unravel the won-
ders of this window in Chapter 3.) You can drag the bottom-right corner
of your iTunes window to make it larger or smaller on your screen.

39
Chapter 2: Setting Up iTunes and Your iPod

Whether or not you set iTunes to automatically connect to the Internet, be
sure to connect to the Internet with iTunes at some point. Doing so allows
you to buy music online and listen to Web radio. You can even retrieve track
information when you insert a CD so that you don’t have to type the informa-
tion yourself.
Setting up iTunes for Windows
Before installing iTunes for Windows, make sure that you’re logged on as a
Windows Administrator user if you’re using Windows 2000 or Windows XP.
Quit all other applications before installing and disable any virus protection
software.
To install iTunes for Windows, download the iTunesSetup.exe file from the
Apple Web site, as we describe earlier in this chapter (refer to Figure 2-1).
The iTunes installer also installs the newest version of QuickTime, replacing any
older version you may have. QuickTime is Apple’s multimedia development,
storage, and playback technology. While Windows users aren’t required to use
QuickTime beyond its use by iTunes itself, QuickTime is a bonus for Windows
users because it offers digital video playback.
If for some reason you can’t download this software from the Internet, and
you know for certain that the CD-ROM includes iTunes for Windows, you can
use the CD-ROM to install iTunes. The CD-ROM installation process installs
both iTunes for Windows and the iPod Updater for Windows. See the section
“Setting Up Your iPod with a Windows PC” for information about installing
iTunes for Windows from the CD-ROM.
To install iTunes for Windows, follow these steps:
1. Double-click the iTunesSetup.exe file, which you can download from
the Apple Web site.
The installer comes to life, displaying its opening window.
2. Click Next and then click the Yes button for Apple’s License Agreement.
Apple’s License Agreement page appears in the installer window, and
you can use the PageDown key to scroll down the agreement. Click Yes
after reading to agree to it, or click No to discontinue installation. You
can also click Back to return to the first page. After clicking Yes, the
installer displays the Important Information page.
40
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 

3. Read the Important Information page and click Next.
The installer displays important “read me” information about the latest
iTunes features. Click Next after reading it, or click Back to go back to
the previous page. To quit the installer and stop the installation, click
Cancel. After clicking Next, the installer displays the next page with
questions about the type of setup, as shown in Figure 2-4.
4. Select the appropriate options for your iTunes setup and then click Next.
The options follow:
• Install Desktop Shortcuts: You can install shortcuts for your
Windows desktop for iTunes.
• Use iTunes as the Default Player for Audio Files: We suggest turn-
ing this on — allowing iTunes to be the default audio content
player — because iTunes offers more features than you typically
find with players and browser plug-ins from other companies. If
you’re happy with your audio player, you can deselect this option,
leaving your default player setting unaffected.
• Use QuickTime as the Default Player for Media Files: We suggest
turning this on — allowing QuickTime to be the default audio multi-
media (including video and audio) player — because QuickTime
for Windows can play just about any media format and is compara-
ble to players and browser plug-ins from other companies. If you’re
happy with your media player, you can deselect this option, leav-
ing your default media player setting unaffected.
After clicking Next, the installer displays the Choose Destination
Location page, as shown in Figure 2-5.
Figure 2-4:
Setup
options for
the iTunes
installation
in Windows.
41
Chapter 2: Setting Up iTunes and Your iPod

5. In the Choose Destination Location page, select a destination folder
for iTunes, and then click Next.
By default, the installer assumes that you want to store the program in
the Program Files folder of your C: drive (which is an excellent place to
store it, unless you have other ideas). If you want to use a different folder,
click Browse to use Windows Explorer to locate the desired folder.
After you click Next, the installer displays information about the iTunes
Music Store.
6. Click Next.
After you click Next, the installer proceeds with the installation.
7. When the installer finishes, click Finish.
iTunes for Windows and QuickTime are now installed on your PC.
To set iTunes up for your Internet connection and start using it, double-click
the iTunes program or use your Start menu to locate iTunes and launch it.
After that, follow these steps:
1. If this is the first time you’ve used iTunes, click the Agree button for
Apple’s License Agreement.
Apple’s License Agreement appears only when you start iTunes for the
first time.
Optional: Before you click the Agree button, you have a few other options.
You can click the Save button to save the license agreement as a document,
the Print button to print it, the Decline button to quit iTunes immediately,
Figure 2-5:
Choose a
Windows
destination
folder for
the iTunes
application.
42
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 

or simply go with the Agree button. If you don’t agree, you can consult a
lawyer, but you still won’t be able to continue with the setup. 
2. Click Next in the iTunes Setup Assistant opening screen.
The iTunes Setup Assistant takes you through the process of setting up
the Windows version of iTunes for the Internet. After clicking Next, the
Setup Assistant displays a page that helps you find music files on your
PC, as shown in Figure 2-6.
3. Select or deselect the following options for finding music (by default
they are selected):
• Add MP3 and AAC Files: Select this option if you already have
music files in the AAC format that’s used by iTunes and the iPod —
this option copies those files automatically into iTunes. You might
want to turn this off, however, because iTunes might find MP3 
files that you don’t want to add to your library (such as music 
for games).
• Add WMA Files: Select this option if you want to add unprotected
Windows Media audio files to your iTunes library. This option auto-
matically converts the WMA files to the AAC format. (For more
information about formats, see Chapter 17.) The original WMA files
are left untouched.
After clicking Next, the assistant displays choices for keeping your
music files and folders organized, as shown in Figure 2-7.
Figure 2-6:

43
Chapter 2: Setting Up iTunes and Your iPod

4. The assistant asks whether you want to keep your iTunes music folder
organized. Select Yes or No, and then click Next.
The default is Yes, which tells iTunes to keep your music files organized
automatically — iTunes renames and moves files into appropriate fold-
ers when you edit the artist name, song title, album name, or track
number. If you don’t want automatic renaming or you want to rename
files and folders manually, click No.
5. The assistant asks whether you want to go straight to the iTunes Music
Store. Select Yes or No, and then click Finish.
We suggest selecting No until you are ready to go to the store. (Chapter 4
covers the iTunes Music Store in depth.)
After clicking Finish, the iTunes window appears. (Chapter 3 gives you
the full scoop on this window.) You can drag the bottom-right corner or
the edges of your iTunes window to make it larger or smaller on your
screen.
Setting Up Your iPod with a Mac
As with the iTunes software, the version of the iPod software that’s provided
with your iPod on CD-ROM might not be the newest version — especially if
the iPod sat on a store shelf for a few months. Even minor changes to the
software might mean new iPod features or better performance with your bat-
tery. Updates to the iPod software occur frequently. If you want the latest ver-
sion, go directly to the Apple Web site to get it. You can download the iPod
software for free.

Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 

You can set your Mac to automatically download the latest version of the
iPod software when it becomes available — just use Software Update from
the Mac OS X System Preferences window. Click the Check Now button to
check for a new version. If one exists, it appears in a window for you to
select. Select it and click Install to download and install it.
To download the iPod software, go to Apple’s iPod download page on the
Web (www.apple.com/ipod/download) and select the appropriate version
(Mac or Windows). Follow the instructions to download the installer to your
hard drive. Pick a location on your hard drive to save the installer. Then
launch the installer to unpack and install the iPod software.
Apple pre-installs the iPod software on Apple-branded models so that you
can use it right away with iTunes on a Mac. The extra step of downloading
and installing iPod software ensures that you have the newest version and
that you can restore the iPod if necessary (as we describe in Chapter 27).
To set up your iPod with a Mac, connect it to the Mac as described in Chapter 1.
When you first connect your iPod to a Mac, the iTunes Setup Assistant
appears like a butler, ready to help you set it up, as shown in Figure 2-8 for a
color-display iPod. In this dialog you can give your iPod a name, which is a
good idea if you plan on sharing several iPods among several computers.
In the iTunes Setup Assistant, you can decide whether to update your iPod
automatically or manually. If you want to copy your entire iTunes music
library, leave the “Automatically update songs on my iPod” option selected.
This option creates a mirror image of your library on the iPod, including all
playlists and audio files, every time you connect your iPod. (Don’t worry. You
Figure 2-8:
Set up your
iPod with
the iTunes
Setup
Assistant.
45
Chapter 2: Setting Up iTunes and Your iPod

can always change this setting later; see Chapter 10.) If you want to copy only
a portion of your library to the iPod, deselect (clear) this option.
The color-display iPod models also let you “Automatically copy photos to my
iPod;” refer to Figure 2-8. Turn this option on if you want to copy all the
photos in your iPhoto library to your iPod, or leave it off if you want to trans-
fer photos later. This option copies (or updates) your entire iPhoto library to
the iPod every time you connect your iPod. 
If you turn on the option to copy photos automatically, and you also turn on
the option to copy songs automatically, iTunes copies the songs first, then
copies photos from the iPhoto library up to the limit of the iPod’s capacity.
iTunes tries to fit the entire photo library if your iPod has room. But if all the
photos can’t fit, iTunes fills the iPod with photos in the order specified by
album list in the iPod pane of the iTunes Preferences window. See Chapter 24
to read all about transferring photos to your color-display iPod.
If you have an iPod shuffle, the iTunes Setup Assistant displays an option to
copy songs randomly, as shown in Figure 2-9. If you leave the “Automatically
choose songs for my iPod” option on, iTunes copies a random selection of
songs to the iPod shuffle. You can always choose to fill the iPod shuffle with a
different selection by clicking the Autofill button, as we describe in Chapter 10.
The iTunes Setup Assistant allows you to register your iPod with Apple to take
advantage of Apple support. When you reach the last dialog, click Done. iTunes
automatically launches, and your iPod’s name appears in the iTunes Source
pane under the Music Store. If you selected the automatic update feature in the
iTunes Setup Assistant, the iPod name appears grayed out in the Source pane,
and you can’t open it. However, your iPod quickly fills up with the music from
your iTunes music library — that is, if you have music in your library.
Figure 2-9:
Set up your

46
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 

If you deselected the automatic update feature, the iPod name appears 
just like any other source in the Source pane, and you can open it and play
songs on the iPod through iTunes and your Mac speakers, as we describe in
Chapter 16. Of course, if you’re just starting out, you probably have no tunes
in your library. Your next step is to import music from CDs, buy music online,
or import music from other sources.
After finishing setup, the iPod icon also appears on the Finder Desktop. If you
leave your iPod connected to the Mac, the iPod appears on the Desktop and
in iTunes whenever you start iTunes.
To see how much free space is left on the iPod, click the iPod icon on the
desktop and choose File➪Get Info. The Finder displays the Get Info window
with information about capacity, amount used, and available space. You can
also use the About command on the iPod, which is available in the Settings
menu: Choose Settings➪About. The iPod information screen appears with
capacity and available space.
Setting Up Your iPod with a Windows PC
Before installing the iPod Software for Windows, make sure you’re logged on
as a Windows Administrator user if you’re using Windows 2000 or Windows
XP. Quit all other applications before installing, and disable any virus protec-
tion software.
The version of iPod Software for Windows provided on the CD-ROM with your
iPod might not be the newest version. Therefore, we recommend going
directly to the Apple Web site and downloading the latest version.
If you bought your iPod before the fall of 2003, the CD-ROM that came with it
installs MusicMatch Jukebox. Don’t use the CD-ROM from older iPods if you
plan on using iTunes for Windows — download the newer iTunes and iPod
installers from the Apple Web site.
If you use Windows 2000 or Windows XP, you can use iTunes for Windows. If
you use any other Windows version, you need to install MusicMatch Jukebox
from the iPod CD-ROM. 
Setting up your iPod with Windows is a two-step process: installing the 
iPod Software and using the iTunes Setup Assistant. As of this writing, the
CD-ROMs supplied with iPods offer iTunes for Windows and iPod Software 
in one installation. However, the CD-ROM might not contain the newest 
versions — especially if the iPod sat on a store shelf for a few months. The
Apple Web site offers free downloads of the most up-to-date versions.
47
Chapter 2: Setting Up iTunes and Your iPod

If you have no other choice, you can install from the CD-ROM and then
update your software later from the Apple Web site. 
Installing the iPod Software
To install iPod Software for Windows from the CD-ROM, do not connect the
iPod to your computer — leave it disconnected, but be ready to connect it
when the instructions say so. Follow these steps first:
1. Double-click the CD-ROM icon in Windows Explorer.
The CD-ROM’s AutoPlay feature starts the installation process; if the
installer doesn’t open automatically, right-click the CD-ROM icon in the
My Computer window and choose AutoPlay from the shortcut menu that
appears.
2. In the first dialog that appears, choose the language that you want to
use and then click OK.
The language shortcut menu lets you choose from quite a number of lan-
guages. After clicking OK, the InstallShield Wizard, so familiar to Windows
users, takes over and launches the installer.
3. Click Agree for the license agreement and type in your iPod serial
number. Then click Next (or Cancel to quit).
Follow the instructions to type in your iPod serial number, and click
Next for each window. The CD-ROM installation performs the same
process as installing iTunes and the iPod software separately.
4. In the Choose Destination Location pane, select a destination folder
for the iPod Updater, and then click Next.
The iPod folder contains the iPod Updater program. By default, the
installer assumes that you want to store the iPod folder in the Program
Files folder of your C: drive (which is just peachy, unless you like to defy
the system designers at Microsoft by putting programs in other places).
Click Browse to use Windows Explorer if you dare locate a different folder.
After selecting a folder (or keeping the default), click Next. The installer
displays the next page, which asks you to connect your iPod to check its
hard drive format.
5. Connect your iPod and reformat its hard drive if necessary, then
press Next. 
6. When the iTunes Setup Assistant appears, click Next again.
Connect your iPod as described in Chapter 1. The installer checks to see
if it needs to be reformatted, and if it does, it reformats the iPod for
Windows. When finished, press Next, and iTunes starts up with the
iTunes Setup Assistant dialog inside the iTunes window. You can skip to
the next section on using the iTunes Setup Assistant.

If you purchased an older model without a CD-ROM, or a model with an out-
dated CD-ROM, you can install iPod Software for Windows, which is available
on the Internet. To download iPod Software for Windows and install the down-
loaded version, go to Apple’s iPod download page on the Web (www.apple.
com/ipod/download) and click the iPod software link. Follow the instruc-
tions to download the installer to your hard drive. Pick a location on your
hard drive to save the installer.
To install the downloaded version of iPod Software for Windows, do not connect
the iPod to your computer — leave it disconnected, but be ready to connect
it when the instructions say so. Follow these steps first:
1. Double-click the iPodSetup.exe file, which you can download from
the Apple Web site.
2. In the first dialog that appears, choose the language that you want to
use, and then click OK.
The language menu lets you choose from quite a number of languages.
After clicking OK, the InstallShield Wizard, so familiar to Windows users,
takes over and launches the installer.
3. Click Agree for the license agreement, and then click Next (or Cancel
to quit).
4. In the Choose Destination Location pane, select a destination folder
for the iPod Updater, and then click Finish.
The iPod folder contains the iPod Updater program. By default, the
installer assumes that you want to store the iPod folder in the Program
Files folder of your C: drive (which is just peachy, unless you like to defy
the system designers at Microsoft by putting programs in other places).
Click Browse to use Windows Explorer to locate a different folder if 
you dare. 
After selecting a folder (or keeping the default), click Finish. 
After the installer finishes installing the iPod Updater, follow these steps:
1. Start iPod Updater by choosing it from the iPod menu in your 
Start menu.
Launch the iPod Updater program by double-clicking the program icon
or choosing it from the Start menu (Start➪iPod➪iPod Updater). The
iPod Updater displays “Plug in an iPod to update it” in the iPod Updater
window. You can now plug your iPod into the computer.
2. Connect your iPod and wait for iPod Updater to recognize it. 
Connect your iPod as described in Chapter 1. The installer checks to see
if it needs to be reformatted; if it does, it activates the Restore button
shown in Figure 2-10. This leaves you no other option except to restore
49
Chapter 2: Setting Up iTunes and Your iPod

the iPod to its factory condition, which includes reformatting the iPod
for Windows. If your iPod is formatted for Mac use, it displays N/A for
Name and Capacity. Refer to Figure 2-10.
3. Click the Restore button to restore the iPod, and click Restore again
to continue.
After you click Restore, the iPod Updater displays a warning dialog.
Click Restore to continue with the restoration. iPod Updater erases and
reformats the hard drive and restores the iPod to its factory settings.
When it finishes restoring, it displays “Restore is complete. Please dis-
connect iPod from PC and connect it to the external power supply to
allow firmware reflash.” 
4. Disconnect the iPod from the computer and connect it to AC power.
The iPod needs AC power to do a firmware refresh. (Firmware is soft-
ware encoded in hardware.) Disconnect your iPod carefully, and then
connect it to your power adapter. The iPod performs a firmware refresh
operation that takes a few minutes. After the operation is complete, the
iPod Updater displays its opening dialog.
5. Connect the iPod to the computer again.
iPod Updater should now recognize your iPod.
6. Close iPod Updater, but leave your iPod connected.
Close the iPod Updater by clicking the X-marked close box in the upper-
right corner. Since your iPod is still connected, iTunes should start auto-
matically and display the iTunes Setup Assistant dialog inside the iTunes
window. If iTunes doesn’t start automatically, start iTunes and wait for it
to recognize your iPod. If your computer or iTunes has trouble recogniz-
ing your iPod, see Chapter 27.

Using iTunes Setup Assistant
If you started your installation from CD-ROM, as most people do, the iTunes
Setup Assistant automatically appears after installing the iPod Software —
just follow the steps given here. If you instead started your installation from
the downloaded iPod Updater, as many of you savvy folks do because you
want to use the latest version, leave your iPod connected and iTunes should
start automatically; otherwise, you can start iTunes and connect your iPod
when you’re ready to continue setup — and as soon as iTunes recognizes
your iPod, it displays the Setup Assistant. Then follow these steps:
1. Click Next when the Setup Assistant opening dialog displays.
After clicking Next, the Setup Assistant displays the next page, which
lets you give your iPod a name, as shown in Figure 2-11.
2. Give your iPod a name, set automatic options, then click Next.
In this dialog you can give your iPod a name, which is a good idea if you
plan on sharing several iPods among several computers.
You can also decide whether to update your iPod automatically or man-
ually. If you want to copy your entire iTunes music library, leave the
“Automatically update songs on my iPod” option selected. This option
creates a mirror image of your library on the iPod, including all playlists
and audio files, every time you connect your iPod. (Don’t worry. You can
always change this setting later; see Chapter 10.) If you want to copy
only a portion of your library to the iPod, deselect (clear) this option.

Chapter 2: Setting Up iTunes and Your iPod

If you have an iPod shuffle, the iTunes Setup Assistant displays an
option to copy songs randomly. If you leave the “Automatically choose
songs for my iPod” option on, iTunes copies a random selection of songs
to the iPod shuffle. You can always choose to fill the iPod shuffle with a
different selection by clicking the Autofill button, as we describe in
Chapter 10.
The color-display iPod models also let you “Automatically copy photos
to my iPod.” Turn this option on if you want to copy all the photos in
your Adobe Photoshop Album (version 1.0 or newer) or Photoshop
Elements (version 3.0 or newer) library to your iPod. Leave it off if you
want to transfer photos later. This option copies (or updates) your
entire photo library to the iPod every time you connect your iPod.
Click Next when you’re finished with setting options and the iPod’s name.
iTunes Setup Assistant moves on to the page for registering your iPod.
3. Click the Register button to register your iPod, and then click Finish.
The iTunes Setup Assistant allows you to register your iPod with Apple
to take advantage of Apple support. When you reach the last dialog,
click Finish. iTunes automatically launches, and your iPod’s name
appears in the iTunes Source pane under the Music Store. 
If you turn on the option to copy photos automatically, and you also turn on
the option to copy songs automatically. iTunes copies the songs first, then
copies photos up to the limit of the iPod’s capacity. iTunes tries to fit the
entire photo library if your iPod has room. But if all the photos can’t fit,
iTunes fills the iPod with photos in the order specified by album list in the
iPod pane of the iTunes Preferences window. See Chapter 24 to read all about
transferring photos to your color-display iPod.
If you selected the automatic update feature in the iTunes Setup Assistant,
the iPod name appears grayed out in the Source pane, and you can’t open it.
However, your iPod quickly fills up with the music from your iTunes music
library.
If you deselected the automatic update feature, the iPod name appears just
like any other source in the Source pane. You can open it and play songs on
the iPod through iTunes and your PC speakers, as we describe in Chapter 16.
Of course, if you’re just starting out, you probably have no tunes in your
library. Your next step is to import music from CDs, buy music online, or
import music from other sources.

In This Chapter
 Finding out what you can do with iTunes
 Playing music tracks on a CD
 Skipping and repeating music tracks
 Displaying visuals while playing music
M
ore than half a century ago, jukeboxes were the primary and most con-
venient way for people to select the music they wanted to hear and
share with others, especially newly released music. Juke joints were hopping
with the newest hits every night. You could pick any song to play at any time,
but you had to insert a coin and pay for each play. Radio eventually supplanted
the jukebox as the primary means of releasing new music to the public, and
the music was free to hear — but you couldn’t choose to play any song you
wanted at any time.
Today, using iTunes, you can have a digital jukebox and a radio in your com-
puter. Click a button to play any song anytime you want, or click a radio sta-
tion and play a broadcast. Connect your computer to a stereo amplifier in
your home or connect speakers to your computer, and suddenly your com-
puter is the best jukebox in the neighborhood.
This chapter explains what you can do with iTunes and how you can use
iTunes to play music tracks on a CD, just like a jukebox, only better — you
don’t have to pay for each song you play, and you can play some or all of the
songs on an album in any order. 

What You Can Do with iTunes
You can download songs from the Internet and copy them to iTunes, or copy
songs from CDs directly into your iTunes library. You can also buy music and
music videos online at the iTunes Music Store, or subscribe to podcasts,
which are feeds that transfer new audio files automatically, such as weekly
radio broadcasts. iTunes downloads content from the store and puts it in
your library, making it immediately available for playing. You can then burn
the audio content onto a CD or transfer it to an iPod. You can even use iTunes
to listen to Web radio stations and add your favorite stations to your music
library.
Transferring songs from a CD to your computer is called ripping a CD (to the
chagrin of the music industry old-timers who think that users intend to
destroy the discs or steal the songs). Ripping an entire CD’s worth of songs is
quick and easy, and track information, such as artist name and title, arrives
automatically over the Internet.
iTunes gives you the power to organize songs into playlists and burn any set
of songs in your library to CD, in any order. You can even set up dynamic
smart playlists that reflect your preferences and listening habits. iTunes
offers an equalizer with preset settings for all kinds of music and listening
environments, and it gives you the ability to customize and save your own
personalized settings with each song.
The Mac and Windows versions of iTunes are virtually identical, with the
exception that dialogs look a bit different between the two operating sys-
tems. There are also a few other differences, mostly related to the different
operating environments — the Windows version lets you import Windows
Media (WMA) songs, while the Mac version, like most Mac applications, can
be controlled by Applescripts. Nevertheless, as Apple continues to improve
iTunes, the company releases upgrades to both versions at the same time,
and the versions are free to download.
Opening the iTunes Window
You can run iTunes anytime to add music, audio books, podcasts, Web radio
stations, and music videos, and to manage your iTunes library. You don’t
have to connect your iPod until you’re ready to transfer music, audio books,
and podcasts to it (as we describe in Chapter 11), or play the content on the
iPod rather than the content in the library (as we describe in Chapter 18).
When you launch iTunes, your library and other sources of content appear.
Figure 3-1 shows the iTunes window on the Mac, and Figure 3-2 shows it in
Windows.
54
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 

The iTunes window offers a view of your library and your sources for content,
as well as controls for organizing, importing, and playing content, as follows:
 Source pane: Displays the source — Library (your iTunes library), Party
Shuffle (a dynamic playlist), Radio (access to Web radio), Music Store
(the iTunes Music Store), your iPod (if it’s connected), and your playlists.
 Song List pane and Browse pane: Depending on the source that’s selected
in the Source pane, these panes display a list of the content in your library,
your playlist, your iPod, the iTunes Music Store, the podcast directory, or
Web radio stations. The Browse button in the upper-right corner toggles
between Browse view (with the Song List pane below and the Browse pane
above with genre, artist, and album) and the Song List pane by itself.
Browse view isn’t available when viewing a playlist or the Radio selection.
 Status pane: When a song, audio book, radio station, podcast, or video
is playing, this displays the artist name, piece title (if known), and the
elapsed time.
 Search field: Type characters in this field to search your library. You can
also use the search field to peruse a playlist or to look within the iTunes
Music Store.

actually pop out of some computers, iPods are hard drives, and ejecting
them simply removes (a.k.a. un-mounts) the drives from the system.
If you don’t like the width of the Source pane, you can adjust it by dragging the
shallow dot on the vertical bar between the Source pane and the Song List
pane and Browse pane. You can also adjust the height of the Song List and
Browse panes by dragging the shallow dot on the horizontal bar between them.
To resize the iTunes window in Windows, drag the edges of the window hori-
zontally or vertically. On a Mac, drag diagonally from the bottom-right corner.

Playing CD Tracks in iTunes
iTunes needs content. You can get started right away with ripping music from
CDs into your library, but for more instant gratification, you can play music
right off the CD without importing it. Maybe you don’t want to put the music
into your library yet. Maybe you just want to hear it first, as part of your Play
First, Rip Later plan.
Insert any music CD or even a CD-R that someone burned for you. The 
music tracks appear in the iTunes song list. The Browse button changes to 
an Import button when a CD is inserted, in anticipation of importing (a.k.a.
ripping) the CD. 
The songs first appear in your song list as generic, unnamed tracks. If your
computer is connected to the Internet, you may be able to grab the song
information automatically, without your having to type anything — that is, if
you turned on the “Connect to Internet when needed” option in the General
tab of the Preferences dialog (as described in Chapter 8).
After you insert the CD, iTunes displays a message about accessing the
Gracenote CDDB database on the Internet, and then presents the track infor-
mation for each song automatically, as shown in Figure 3-3. (Gracenote CDDB
is a song database on the Internet that knows the track names of most com-
mercial CDs, but not homemade mix CDs. You can read about it and editing
song information, in Chapter 8.)
Figure 3-3:

57
Chapter 3: Getting Started with iTunes

When you play a CD in iTunes, it’s just like using a CD player. To play a CD
from the first track, click the Play button. (If you clicked somewhere else after
inserting the disc, you may have to click the first track to select it before
clicking the Play button.) The Play button then turns into a Pause button, and
the song plays.
When the song finishes, iTunes continues playing the songs in the list in
sequence until you click the Pause button (which then toggles back into the
Play button), or until the song list ends. You can skip to the next or previous
song by using the arrow keys on your keyboard, or by clicking the Forward
button or the Back button next to the Play button. You can also double-click
another song in the list to start playing it.
You can press the space bar to perform the same function as clicking the Play
button; pressing it again is just like clicking the Pause button.
The Status pane above the list of songs tells you the name of the artist or the
song title (if known), as well as the elapsed time of the track. When you click
the artist name, the artist name disappears, and the song title appears; if you
click the song title, the artist name comes back up. If you click the Elapsed
Time status, the status changes to the remaining time and then, with another
click, to the total time. (One more click brings you back to the elapsed time.)
Eject a CD by clicking the Eject button or by choosing Controls➪Eject Disc.
Another way to eject the CD is to click the eject icon next to the CD’s name in
the Source pane. You can also right-click the CD’s name and choose Eject
from the contextual menu.
Rearranging and repeating tracks
You can rearrange the order of the tracks to automatically play them in any
sequence you want — similar to programming a CD player. Click the upward-
pointing arrow at the top of the first column in the song list, and it changes to
a downward-pointing arrow, and the tracks appear in reverse order.
To change the order of tracks that you’re playing in sequence, just click and
hold on the track number in the leftmost column for the song, and then drag
it up or down in the list. You can set up the tracks to play in a completely dif-
ferent sequence.
Skipping tracks
To skip tracks so that they don’t play in sequence, deselect the check box
next to the song names. iTunes skips deselected songs when you play the
entire sequence.
58
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 

To remove all check marks from a list, simultaneously hold down the Ô key
on a Mac (or the Ctrl key in Windows) while clicking a check mark. Select an
empty check box while pressing Ô/Ctrl to add check marks to the entire list.
Repeating a song list
You can repeat an entire song list by clicking the Repeat button below the
Source pane on the left side of the iTunes window (or by choosing Controls➪
Repeat All). When it’s selected, the Repeat button icon changes to show blue
highlighting. Click the Repeat button again to repeat the current song (or
choose Controls➪Repeat One). The icon changes to include a blue-highlighted
numeral 1. Click it once more to return to normal playback (or choose
Controls➪Repeat Off).
The Shuffle button, located to the left of the Repeat button, plays the songs in
the list in random order, which can be fun. You can then press the arrow keys
on your keyboard or click the Back and Forward buttons to jump around in
random order.
Displaying visuals
The visual effects in iTunes can turn your display into a light show that’s syn-
chronized to the music in your library. You can watch a cool visual display of
eye candy while the music plays — or leave it on like a lava lamp. 
Click the Visual Effects button on the bottom-right side of the iTunes window
to display visual effects. The visual animation appears in the iTunes window
and synchronizes with the music.
In addition to the animation replacing the iTunes song list, an Options button
replaces the Import button in the upper-right corner of the iTunes window.
You can click the Options button to open the Visualizer Options dialog, as
shown in Figure 3-4.
The Visualizer Options dialog offers the following options that affect the ani-
mation (but not the performance of iTunes when it’s playing music):
 Display Frame Rate: Displays the frame rate of the animation along with
the animation.
 Cap Frame Rate at 30 fps: Keeps the frame rate at 30 fps (frames per
second) or lower, which is roughly the speed of video.
 Always Display Song Info: Displays the song name, artist, and album for
the song currently playing, along with the animation.
59
Chapter 3: Getting Started with iTunes

 Use OpenGL (Mac only): You can choose to use OpenGL, the most
widely used standard for three-dimensional graphics programming, to
display very cool animation with faster performance.
 Faster but Rougher Display: The animation plays faster, with rougher
graphics. Select this option if your animation plays too slowly.
The Visualizer menu in iTunes gives you even more control over visual effects.
You can choose Visualizer➪Small or Visualizer➪Medium to display the visual
effects in a rectangle inside the iTunes window, or choose Visualizer➪Large to
fill the iTunes window. Choosing Visualizer➪Full Screen sets the visual effects
to fill up the entire screen. When displaying the full-screen visual effects, you
can click the mouse or press Escape (Esc) to stop the display and return to
iTunes. Choosing Visualizer➪Turn Visualizer On is the same as clicking the
Visual Effects button: It displays the visual effects.
While the animated visual effects play, press Shift-/ (like when you type a ques-
tion mark) to see a list of keyboard functions. Depending on the visual effect,
you might see more choices of keyboard functions by pressing Shift-/ again.
To turn off the visual effects display, click the Visual Effects button again. You
can leave the effects on (except when in full-screen mode) even while open-
ing the equalizer because you still have access to the playback controls.

W
hen Apple announced its new music service, Apple chairman Steve
Jobs remarked that other services put forward by the music industry
tend to treat consumers like criminals. Steve had a point. Many of these 
services cost more and add a level of copy protection that prevents con-
sumers from burning more than one CD or using the music they bought 
on other computers or portable MP3 players.
Record labels had been dragging their feet for years, experimenting with
online sales and taking legal action against online sites, such as Napster, that
allowed free downloads and music copying. Although the free music attracted
millions of listeners, the free services were under legal attack in several coun-
tries, and the digital music that was distributed wasn’t of the highest quality
(not to mention the widespread and sometimes intentional misspellings in the
song information and artist names). Consumers grew even warier when the
Record Industry Association of America (RIAA), a lobbying organization look-
ing out for the interests of record companies, began legal proceedings against
people for illegal copyright infringement — people who possibly thought they
were downloading free music.
No one should go to jail for being a music junkie. Consumers and the industry
both needed a solution, so Apple did the research on how to make a service
that worked better and was easier to use, and the company forged ahead
with the iTunes Music Store. By all accounts, Apple has succeeded in offering

the easiest, fastest, and most cost-effective service for buying music online
for your computer and your iPod. The iTunes Music Store even offers gift cer-
tificates that you can e-mail to others and allowance accounts that you can
set up for others (such as children) with credit limits but without the need to
use a credit card. Apple adds new features to the store almost every week.
In this chapter, we show you how to sign in and take advantage of what the
iTunes Music Store has to offer.
Visiting the iTunes Music Store
You can visit the iTunes Music Store by connecting to the Internet and using
either iTunes or America Online (AOL).
As of this writing, the iTunes Music Store offers at least 1.5 million songs,
with most songs available for download at the price of 99 cents each and
entire albums available for download at less than the CD price. You can play
the songs on up to five different computers, burn your own CDs, and use
them on the iPod. The store also offers audio books from Audible.com, and
podcasts, which are similar to syndicated radio shows but can be downloaded
into iTunes and listened to at your convenience on your computer and iPod.
The iTunes Music Store is part of iTunes version 4 and newer. If you’re run-
ning an older version of iTunes, download the newest version, as we describe
in Chapter 2.
You can preview any song for up to 30 seconds (and audio books up to about
90 seconds), and if you have an account set up, you can buy and download
the song immediately. We don’t know of a faster way to purchase a song.
To open the iTunes Music Store, you have three options:
 Click the Music Store option in the Source pane. This opens the Music
Store’s home page, as shown in Figure 4-1. 
 Follow a music link in iTunes. Click the music link (the gray-circled
arrow next to a song title, artist name, or album title) to go to a Music
Store page related to the song, artist, or album. iTunes performs a
search in the Music Store by using the song information. If nothing
closely related turns up, at least you end up in the Music Store, and you
might even find music you like that you didn’t know about.
 Go to iTunes on AOL and click the iTunes link. If you use AOL, you can
browse or search the AOL music area for songs and click the iTunes link
to automatically launch iTunes and go to the Music Store.
62
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 

If you need to fire up your modem and log on to your Internet service to go
online, do so before clicking the Music Store option or following a music link.
The Music Store replaces the iTunes Song List and Browse panes. You can
check out artists and songs to your heart’s content although you can’t buy
songs unless you have a Music Store account set up. You can use the Choose
Genre pop-up menu to specify music genres, or click links for new releases,
exclusive tracks, and so on.
We use the term pop-up menu for menus on the Mac that literally pop up from
dialogs and windows; the same type of menu in Windows actually drops
down and is also called a drop-down menu. We use pop-up menu for both.
The iTunes Music Store also provides buttons on a gray bar just above the
Song List pane and Browse pane. The left and right triangle buttons work just
like the Back and Forward buttons of a Web browser, moving back a page or
forward a page. The button with the Home icon takes you to the iTunes Music
Store home page. The Browse button in the upper-right corner switches the
view between Browse view (with the Song List and Browse panes both open)
and Song List view (with only the Song List pane open).

Setting up an account
To create an iTunes Music Store account, follow these steps:
1. In iTunes, click the Music Store option in the Source pane or follow a
music link.
The Music Store’s home page appears (refer to Figure 4-1), replacing the
iTunes Song List pane and Browse pane.
2. Click the Sign In button in the upper-right area of the window to
create an account or sign in to an existing account.
If you don’t have an account, the button next to Account on the gray 
bar reads “Sign In.” If you already have an account, the account name
appears in place of the Sign In button. You need an account to buy
music. After clicking the Sign In button, iTunes displays the account
sign-in dialog, as shown in Figure 4-2.
If you already set up an account with the iTunes Music Store, with the
.Mac service, with other Apple services (such as the Apple Developer
Connection), or with AOL, you’re halfway there. Type in your ID and
password, and then click the Sign In button. Apple remembers the 
personal information that you put in previously, so you don’t have to 
re-enter it every time you visit the Music Store. If you forgot your pass-
word, click the Forgot Password? button, and iTunes provides a dialog to
answer your test question. If you answer correctly, iTunes then e-mails
your password to you.
3. If you aren’t signed up yet, click the Create New Account button. 
iTunes displays a new page, replacing the iTunes Music Store home page
with the terms of use and an explanation of steps to create a new
account.

question and answer (in case you forget your password), birth date,
and privacy options.
5. Click the Continue button to go to the next page of the account setup
procedure, and then enter your credit card information.
The entire procedure is secure, so you don’t have to worry. The Music
Store keeps your personal information (including your credit card infor-
mation) on file, and you don’t have to type it again.
6. Click Done to finish the procedure.
You can now use the iTunes Music Store to purchase and download
music to play in iTunes and use on an iPod.
If you use AOL and the AOL Wallet feature, you can assign payment for your
Music Store account to your AOL Wallet. AOL Wallet contains your billing and
credit card information for purchases. Use AOL Wallet to fill out your per-
sonal information. AOL Wallet automatically fills information into the text
boxes of the account setup pages so that you don’t have to.

Click the Choose Store button in the top-left corner of the iTunes Music Store
page to choose online music stores in other countries. iTunes displays a page
of buttons with flags of other countries — click one to go to the home page
for the iTunes Music Store for that country. For example, the music store in
France displays menus in French and features hit songs for the French
market.
Browsing for artists, songs, and albums
The iTunes Music Store home page is loaded with specials and advertise-
ments to peruse. You can also use the Genre pop-up menu to see only those
specials and ads for a particular genre. You can click just about anything on
the home page to get more information: today’s top ten songs, exclusive
offerings, albums, artists’ names, and more.
What if you’re looking for music in a particular genre? You can browse the
store by genre and artist name in a method similar to browsing your iTunes
library. To browse the store, click the Browse button in the top-right corner
of the iTunes window. iTunes displays the store’s offerings categorized by
genre, and within each genre, by artist and album. Click a genre in the left
column, then a subgenre in the middle-left column, then an artist in the
middle-right column, and finally an album in the right column, which takes
you to the list of songs from that album that are available to preview or pur-
chase, as shown in Figure 4-4.

Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 

To see more information about a song or the album that it came from, click
the music link (one of the gray-circled arrow buttons in the song list):
 Clicking the arrow in the Artist column takes you to the artist’s page of
albums.
 Clicking the arrow in the Album column takes you to the album page.
 Clicking the arrow in the Genre column takes you back to the genre’s
specials page (or the home page).
Our only complaint about browsing by artist is that artists are listed alpha-
betically by first name — you have to look up Bob Dylan under Bob.
If you know specifically what you’re looking for, you can search rather than
browse. The Search field in the top-right corner of the iTunes window lets
you search the iTunes Music Store for just about anything. Type part of a
song title or artist name to quickly search the store, or use the Power Search
feature to narrow your search. (See the “Power-searching” section later in
this chapter.)
Browsing the charts
What do Louis Armstrong, Roy Orbison, the Beach Boys, Dean Martin, and
Mary Wells have in common? Each one had a top-ten hit in the charts for
1964. So says Billboard, the weekly magazine for the entertainment industry
that has kept tabs on song popularity for more than half a century. The
iTunes Music Store offers pop charts for each year going back to 1946, so you
can probably find some of the songs that you grew up with.
You can’t find every song that made the charts — only the songs that the
iTunes Music Store offers. 
To find the charts, click the Billboard Charts link in the list of Music Store
links on the home page, or browse the store and select Charts at the very top
of the Genre column. From the Charts column, you can select Billboard Hot
100, Billboard Top Country, or Billboard Top R&B (rhythm & blues).
Don’t like the songs that Billboard chose? Try selecting Radio Charts from the
Genre column, and then pick a city in the United States in the middle column.
Now you can find out what songs are hits in your hometown, no matter where
you are at the moment.

Chapter 4: Shopping at the iTunes Music Store

Power-searching
You’re serious about music, and you want the power to search for exactly
what you want. Click the Power Search link on the iTunes Music Store home
page to go to the Power Search page, as shown in Figure 4-5.
You can fill in the song title, the artist name, and the album title, or just fill in
one of those text boxes (for example, if all you know is the song title). You
can narrow your search by picking a genre from the Genre pop-up menu and
by adding a composer name. After you fill in as much as you know, click the
Search button.
Playing music videos and movie trailers
Music videos and movie trailers are just a click away, and they’re free to
watch. The Music Video link on the iTunes Music Store home page takes you
to a Music Store page. Click a thumbnail or title to select a video. Then either
click Small to select a small video window size for quicker downloading, or
Large for a larger video window size for better viewing.
It might take some time to download the video before it starts to play. After
the QuickTime player controls appear in the iTunes window, as shown in
Figure 4-6, you can click the movie’s Play button (the right triangle next to the
Sound button) to play the video.

You can play music in your iTunes library while waiting for a Music Store
page or video to download over the Internet. Double-click the Music Store
option in the Source pane to open the Music Store in a separate window. With
two windows, you can use the first window to play music in your library
while using the second to browse the Music Store and download a video. The
first windows stops playing music when you use the second window to play a
video or select a song to preview or buy.
Browsing celebrity and published playlists
Do you want to be influenced? Do you want to know what influenced some of
today’s music celebrities and buy what they have in their record collections?
Scroll down the iTunes Music Store home page and click a celebrity name in
the Celebrity Playlists panel, or click the Celebrity Playlists link to go to the
page of celebrity playlists.
A typical celebrity playlist offers about an album’s worth of songs from differ-
ent artists. You can preview or buy any song in the list or follow the music
links to the artist or album page.
The Music Store home page lists some of the celebrity playlists, but a lot more
aren’t listed there (204 the last time we checked). To see all the celebrity
playlists, click the See All button at the bottom of the panel of Celebrity Playlist
links on the home page.

Chapter 4: Shopping at the iTunes Music Store

You can also be influenced by other Music Store buyers and do a little influ-
encing yourself. Click the iMix link on the Music Store home page to check
out playlists that have been contributed by other consumers and published
in the Music Store. iMixes offer 30-second previews of any songs in the
playlist. To learn how to publish your own iMix playlist, see Chapter 9.
Do you want to turn someone else on to some music quickly by sending an
e-mail? Include a reference to a song in the Store in a document or a Web
page? You can also include a Web link (URL) to an iTunes Music Store page
in an e-mail message or other document so the reader can click the link to
go directly to the store page. Drag any link, track, or graphic from a Music
Store page to an e-mail message or document you are composing, and
iTunes copies the link. You can also Ctrl-click the item and choose Copy
iTunes Music Store URL.
Previewing a song
The cool thing about record stores, besides being able to hang out and meet
people, is the ability to preview CDs before you buy them. You can’t meet
flesh-and-blood people in the online iTunes Music Store, but you can preview
songs before you buy them. To preview a song, click the song title in the song
list, and then click the Play button or press the space bar.
By default, the previews play on your computer off the Internet in a stream,
so you might hear a few hiccups in the playback. Each preview lasts about 
30 seconds. Just when you start really getting into the song, it ends — but if
the song is irresistible, you can buy it on the spot.
If you have a slow Internet connection — especially slower than 128 kbps —
the preview may stutter. Choose iTunes➪Preferences on a Mac or Edit➪
Preferences on a Windows PC and click Store. In the Store pane click the
“Load complete preview before playing” option to turn it on.
Buying and Downloading Songs
After setting up an account, you can purchase songs and download each one
to your computer immediately, or gather them in a virtual shopping cart first,
to see your choices and decide whether or not to purchase them before
downloading them all at once. 
Depending on how you set up your account, you can download the song
immediately with the 1-Click option or place the song in your Music Store
Shopping Cart temporarily, to purchase and download later. You can change
your Music Store shopping method at any time.
70
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 

After the song downloads, it appears in your iTunes song list. Purchased
songs also appear in a special Purchased Music playlist under the Music
Store option in the Source pane. You can see the list of all the songs that you
purchased by clicking the triangle to expand the Music Store option in the
Source pane, and then clicking the Purchased Music option. The Song List
pane and Browse pane change to show the list of songs that you purchased.
Using 1-Click
Apple offers 1-Click technology in the iTunes Music Store so that with one
click, the song immediately starts downloading to your computer — and the
purchase is done.
With 1-Click, you select a song and click the Buy Song button at the far right of
the song. (You might have to scroll down your iTunes Music Store window.)
The store displays a warning dialog to make sure that you want to buy the
song, and you can then go through with it or cancel. If you click the Buy button
to purchase the song, the song downloads automatically and shows up in your
iTunes library. The Music Store keeps track of your purchases over a 24-hour
period and charges a total sum rather than for each single purchase.
1-Click seems more like two clicks. If you really want to use only one click to
buy a song, select the Don’t Warn Me About Buying Songs option in the warn-
ing dialog so that you never see it again.
Your decision to download each song immediately or add to a Shopping
Cart and download later is likely based on how your computer connects to
the Internet. If you have a slow connection such as a phone line, you proba-
bly want to use the Shopping Cart, to avoid tying up the phone with each
download.
Using the Shopping Cart
You don’t have to use the 1-Click technology. Instead, you can add songs to
the Shopping Cart to delay purchasing and downloading until you’re ready.
With the Shopping Cart, the store remembers your selections, allowing you
to browse the store at different times and add to your Shopping Cart without
making any purchases final. You can also remove items from the cart at any
time. When you’re ready to buy, you can purchase and download the songs in
your cart at once.
71
Chapter 4: Shopping at the iTunes Music Store

If you switch to the Shopping Cart method (see the following section,
“Changing your Store preferences”), the Buy Song button toggles to an Add
Song button. After adding songs, you can view your Shopping Cart by clicking
the triangle next to the Music Store option in the Source pane to show the
Music Store selections (see Figure 4-7), and click the Shopping Cart option.
The Shopping Cart appears with your purchases listed in the Song List pane,
and recommendations from the store appear along the top of the window.
When you’re ready to purchase everything in your Shopping Cart, click the
Buy Now button in the lower-right corner of the Shopping Cart window to
close the sale and download all the songs at once. You can alternatively click
the Buy (for an album) or Buy Song buttons for each item that you want to
purchase.
To delete items from your Shopping Cart, select them and press Delete/
Backspace. A warning appears asking whether you’re sure that you want to
remove the selected items. Click Yes to go ahead and remove the selections
from your Shopping Cart.
Changing your Store preferences
You can change your shopping method by choosing iTunes➪Preferences on
the Mac or by choosing Edit➪Preferences on a Windows PC. In the Preferences
window, click the Store button. The Store Preferences window appears. You
can set the following features:
 Change from 1-Click to Shopping Cart or vice versa. 1-Click is the default.
 If you select the Play Songs After Downloading option, the songs that
you buy start playing as soon as they complete download to your iTunes
library.
 For better playing performance (fewer hiccups) with previews over slow
Internet connections, select the Load a Complete Preview before Playing
option. (It’s deselected by default.)
If you use more than one computer with your Music Store account, you can
set the preferences for each computer differently and still use the same
account. For example, your home computer might have a faster connection
than your laptop on the road, and you can set your iTunes preferences
accordingly — the home computer could be set to 1-Click, and the laptop
could be set to Shopping Cart.

Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 

Resuming interrupted downloads
All sales are final — you can’t return the digital merchandise. However, you
have to receive all of it before the Music Store charges you for the purchase.
If for any reason the download is interrupted or fails to complete, your order
remains active until you connect to the store again.
iTunes remembers to continue the download when you return to iTunes and
connect to the Internet. If for some reason the download doesn’t continue,
choose Advanced➪Check for Purchased Music to continue the interrupted
download. You can also use this command to check for any purchased music
that hasn’t downloaded yet.
If your computer’s hard drive crashes and you lose your information, you
also lose your songs — you have to purchase and download them again.
However, you can mitigate this kind of disaster by backing up your music
library, which we describe in detail in Chapter 11. You can also burn your
purchased songs onto an audio CD, as we describe in Chapter 12. 
Redeeming gift certificates 
and prepaid cards
If you’re the fortunate recipient of an iTunes Music Store gift certificate, all you
need to do is go to the Music Store in iTunes and set up a new account if you
don’t already have one. Recipients of gift certificates can set up new accounts
Figure 4-7:
View your
Shopping
Cart before
checking
out of the
Music
Store.
73
Chapter 4: Shopping at the iTunes Music Store

without having to provide a credit card number. As a recipient of a gift, you can
simply click None for the credit card option and use the gift certificate as the
sole payment method.
You can receive gift certificates on paper, delivered by the postal service, or
by e-mail; you can also receive a prepaid card with a fixed balance. To redeem
a certificate, click the Gift Certificate link on the iTunes Music Store home
page, and then click the Redeem Now button. Then type the number printed
on the lower-right edge of the certificate or supplied in the e-mail, click the
Redeem button to credit your account, and then sign in to your account or set
up an account. To redeem the amount of a prepaid card, click the Prepaid
Cards link on the iTunes Music Store home page, click the Redeem button
now, and then sign in or set up your account.
If you use Apple’s Mail program, you can redeem a gift certificate that was
sent by e-mail by clicking the Redeem Now button at the bottom of the e-mail
message. This button launches iTunes with the Music Store option selected
in the Source pane, and the certificate’s number shows up automatically.
Click the Redeem button to credit your account, and then sign in to your
account (if you already have an account), or set up an account (see “Setting
up an account,” earlier in this chapter).
The balance of your gift certificate (how much you have left to spend) appears
right next to your account name in the iTunes Music Store window and is
updated as you make purchases.
Managing Your Account
Online stores record necessary information about you, such as your credit
card number, your billing address, and so forth. You can change this infor-
mation at any time, and you can also take advantage of Music Store account
features, such as sending gift certificates and setting up allowance accounts.
Viewing and changing account information
Life is unpredictable. As John Lennon sang in “Beautiful Boy (Darling Boy),”
“Life is what happens to you while you’re busy making other plans.” So if
your billing address changes, or you need to switch to another credit card, or
you need to change your password for any reason, you can edit your account
information at any time.
To see your account information in the Music Store, click the Account button
that shows your account name. iTunes displays a dialog for you to enter your
account password. You then click the View Account button to see your
account in the store.
74
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 

Your account page displays your Apple ID, the last four digits of the credit
card that you use for the account, your billing address, your most recent pur-
chase, and your computer authorizations. (See “Authorizing computers to
play purchased music,” later in this chapter.) You can click buttons to edit
your account information and credit card and to buy or redeem gift certifi-
cates and set up allowances.
Viewing your purchase history
In the rock ’n’ roll lifestyle, you might recall songs from the 60s but not
remember what you bought last week. To view your purchase history, go to
your account page by clicking the Account button and typing your password
in the dialog that appears. Click the View Account button, and on your
account page, click the Purchase History button.
The Music Store displays the songs that you purchased, starting with the
most recent. If you bought a lot of songs, not all of them appear on the first
page. To see the details of previous purchases, click the arrow to the left of
the order date. After viewing your history, click Done at the bottom of the
history page to return to your account page.
Setting up allowances 
Do you trust your kids with your credit card? You don’t have to answer that —
you can sidestep the entire issue by providing an allowance account for 
that special someone who wants to buy music on your credit card. With an
allowance account, you can set the amount of credit to allow for the account
each month — from $10–$200 in increments of $10. You can change the amount
of an allowance or stop it at any time.
To use an allowance account, the recipient must be using iTunes version 4 or
newer and live in a country where the iTunes Music Store is available on the
Internet (such as the United States).
You can set up the allowance account yourself or define an allowance on an
existing account. The recipient signs in to the account and types his or her
password — no credit card required. When the recipient reaches the limit 
of the allowance, that account can’t buy anything else until the following
month. iTunes Music Store saves any unused balance until the next Music
Store purchase.
To set up an allowance account, click the Allowance link on the Music Store
home page. iTunes takes you to the Allowance page in the Music Store, where
you can enter your name, your recipient’s name, the monthly allowance
amount (using the Monthly Allowance pop-up menu), and your recipient’s
Apple ID and password.
75
Chapter 4: Shopping at the iTunes Music Store

Click Continue to proceed with the account setup process, and then follow
the instructions to finish setting up the account.
To stop an allowance or change the amount of an allowance account, go to
your account page by clicking the Account button that shows your account
name, and then type your password in the dialog that appears. Click the View
Account button and scroll the account page until you see the Setup Allowance
button; click this button to go to the Allowance page.
Sending gift certificates
A song is a gift that keeps on giving every time the recipient plays the song.
You can’t go wrong giving a Music Store gift certificate to that special person
who has everything. New songs are introduced every day, and another half-
million songs are available spanning every type of musical genre.
Before sending a gift certificate, first make sure that the recipient can run
iTunes 4. (You might want to subtly suggest to the future recipient, in an
e-mail, that it’s time to download iTunes, just to find out whether he or she
has the requisite system configuration — see Chapter 1.) 
To buy a gift certificate to send to someone, click the Gift Certificate link on
the Music Store home page. iTunes takes you to the Gift Certificate page in the
Music Store.
Click the Buy Now button to purchase a gift certificate. You can send a printed
certificate by snail mail or as an e-mail message. Supply the address, set the
amount of the gift certificate, and even add a personal message if you want;
then click Continue and follow the instructions to finish the process.
To set up or change the amount of a gift certificate, go to your account page
by clicking the Account button that shows your account name and typing
your password in the dialog that appears. Click the View Account button and
scroll the account page until you see the Gift Certificate button; click it to go
to the Gift Certificate page.
Authorizing computers to play 
purchased music
The computer that you use to set up your account is automatically autho-
rized by Apple to play the songs that you buy. Fortunately, the songs aren’t
locked to that computer — you can copy them to other computers and play
them with iTunes. When you first play the songs on the other computers,
iTunes asks for your Music Store account ID and password to authorize that
computer. You can have up to five computers authorized at any one time.
76
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 

If you want to delete one computer and add another computer, you can remove
the authorization from a computer by choosing Advanced➪Deauthorize
Account on that computer. If you need to deauthorize a computer that no
longer works, you can contact Apple through its Music Store support page
(www.apple.com/support/itunes/authorization.html).
Remember to deauthorize your computer before you upgrade, sell, or give it
away. Also, make sure you deauthorize your computer before upgrading your
RAM, hard drive, or other system components. Otherwise, the upgraded
system might count as another authorized computer. If you’ve reached five
authorizations due to system upgrades or failed computers, you can reset your
authorization count by clicking Deauthorize All in the Account Information
screen. (See “Viewing and changing account information” earlier in this chap-
ter.) You can do this only once a year — the Deauthorize All button appears
only if you have at least five authorized computers and you haven’t used the
option in the last 12 months.
After you set up an account, you can sign in to the Music Store at any time to
buy music, view or change account information, and see your purchase his-
tory. Each time you buy music, you get an e-mail from the iTunes Music Store
with the purchase information. It’s nice to know right away what you bought.

Importing Music into iTunes
In This Chapter
 Setting your importing preferences
 Importing music from CDs 
 Importing music files from other sources
T
o immortalize your music, you need to import it into iTunes from your
audio CDs and other sources. After the music is in your iTunes library,
you can preserve it forever. A song in digital format can be kept in that format
in a file on any number of digital media storage devices — so even if your
CDs, DVDs, and hard drive fail, your backup copy (assuming that you made a
backup copy on a safety CD or disk) is still as perfect as the original digital
file. You can make any number of digital copies, and there are no technical
limitations on playing the copies except those imposed by the iTunes Music
Store for songs that you purchased.
Importing tracks from a CD is called ripping a CD. We’re not sure why it’s
called that, but Apple certainly took the term to a new level with an ad cam-
paign for Macs a while back that featured the slogan Rip, Mix, Burn. Burning a
mix CD was the hip thing to do a few years ago. With iTunes, you can still rip
and mix, but if you have an iPod, you no longer need to burn CDs to play your
music wherever you go.
Ripping, in technical terms, is the process of extracting the song’s digital
information from an audio CD, but in common terms it also includes the
process of compressing the song’s digital information and encoding it in a
particular sound file format. The ripping process is straightforward, but the
import settings that you choose affect sound quality, hard drive space (and
iPod space), and compatibility with other types of players and computers. In
this chapter, we show you how to rip CDs, import music from the Internet,
and provide suggestions for settings.

Setting the Importing Preferences
Although importing music from an audio CD takes a lot less time than playing
the CD, it still takes time, so you want your import settings to be correct
before starting. Pay a visit to the Importing Preferences window (iTunes➪
Preferences on a Mac, or Edit➪Preferences in Windows), and then click the
Importing button. The Importing preferences appear, as shown in Figure 5-1.
The Import Using pop-up menu gives you the opportunity to set the type of
encoding — this is perhaps the most important choice — and the Setting pop-up
menu offers different settings depending on your choice of encoder. For example,
in Figure 5-1, we’ve chosen the AAC Encoder with a high-quality setting; in Figure
5-2, we’ve switched to the MP3 Encoder in the Import Using menu, and we’re in
the process of choosing Higher Quality in the Setting menu.
Encoding is a complicated subject and requires a whole chapter of its own.
(In fact, Chapter 17 provides a more in-depth look if you want to know more.)
For a quick and pain-free ripping session, select from among the following
encoders in the Import Using pop-up menu based on how you plan to use
your iTunes library:
 AAC Encoder: We recommend the AAC for all uses. (However, AIFF is
better if you plan to burn another CD with the songs and not use them in
your iPod.) Select the High Quality option from the Setting pop-up menu.
Figure 5-1:
Set your
importing
preferences
for ripping
CDs.
80
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music

You can convert a song that’s been ripped in AIFF, Apple Lossless, or
WAV to AAC or MP3, as we describe in Chapter 18. However, ripping a 
CD with one encoder might be more convenient — and after that, you
can rip it again with a different encoder. For example, you might import
Sgt. Pepper with the AAC encoder for use in your Mac and iPod, and then
import it again with the AIFF encoder, calling the album “Sgt. Pepper-2”
or something, in order to burn some songs on a CD. After burning the
CD, you can delete “Sgt. Pepper-2” to reclaim the hard drive space.
 AIFF Encoder: Use AIFF if you plan on burning the song to an audio CD
using a Mac (see WAV for Windows). AIFF offers the highest possible
quality, but AIFF also takes up lots of space. If you use AIFF, select the
Automatic option from the Setting pop-up menu. Don’t use AIFF format
for songs to be transferred to your iPod — convert them first to AAC or
MP3, as we describe in Chapter 18.
 Apple Lossless Encoder: Use the Apple Lossless encoder for songs that
you intend to burn onto audio CDs and for playing on iPods — the files
are just small enough (about 60-70 percent of the size of the AIFF ver-
sions) that they don’t hiccup on playback. 
 MP3 Encoder: Use the MP3 format for songs that you intend to burn
on MP3 CDs or use with MP3 players or your iPod — it’s universally
supported. If you use MP3, we recommend selecting the Higher Quality
option from the Setting pop-up menu.
Figure 5-2:
Set the
quality
setting for
the encoder
you’ve
chosen for
importing.
81
Chapter 5: Importing Music into iTunes

 WAV Encoder: WAV is the high-quality sound format that’s used on PCs
(like AIFF), and it also takes up a lot of space. Use WAV if you plan on
burning the song to an audio CD or using it with PCs. If you use WAV,
select the Automatic option from the Setting pop-up menu. Don’t use
WAV for songs to be transferred to your iPod — convert them first to
AAC or MP3, as we describe in Chapter 18.
The Importing Preferences window offers the following options, which you
set before ripping a CD:
 Import Using: Set this pop-up menu to the encoder. For more informa-
tion about encoders, see Chapter 17.
 Setting: Set this pop-up menu to High Quality or better for most music.
You can change this setting to get better quality or use hard drive space
more efficiently, as we describe in Chapter 18.
 Play Songs While Importing: Select this check box to play the songs at
the same time that you start ripping them. This option slows down the
speed of importing, but hey — you get to listen to the music right away.
 Create File Names with Track Number: Select this check box to include
the track number in the file names created by iTunes for the songs that
you rip. Including the track number makes it easier to find tracks on an
iPod using a car’s audio controls — if you’ve connected your iPod to a
car stereo system as described in Chapter 15.
 Use Error Correction When Reading Audio CDs: While it reduces the
speed of importing, select this check box to use error correction if you
have problems with audio quality or if the CD skips. (Not every skipping
CD can be imported even with error correction, but it may help.) 
Ripping Music from CDs
After checking your Importing Preferences to be sure that your settings are
correct, you are ready to rip. To rip a CD, follow these steps:
1. Insert an audio CD.
The songs appear in your song list as generic, unnamed tracks at first. If
your computer is connected to the Internet and the CD is in the Gracenote
database, iTunes retrieves the track information automatically. If you need
to connect to the Internet, go ahead and establish your connection, and
then choose Advanced➪Get CD Track Names to get the track information.
If you don’t want to connect to the Internet, or if your CD isn’t recognized
by the Gracenote database, you can type the track information yourself.
That’s described in Chapter 8.
82
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music

2. Optional: Deselect the check boxes next to any songs on the CD that
you don’t want to import.
iTunes imports the songs that have check marks next to them; when you
remove the check mark next to a song, iTunes skips that song.
3. Optional: To remove the gap of silence between songs that segue
together, select those songs and choose Advanced➪Join CD Tracks.
This happens often with music CDs — the tracks are separate, but the
end of one song merges into the beginning of the next song. You don’t
want an annoying half-second gap between the songs. For example, in
Figure 5-3, we already joined the first two songs of the Sgt. Pepper’s

from the Edit menu in Windows. In the Preference window, click the Importing
button. In the Importing Preferences window, deselect the “Play songs while
importing” check box.
iTunes displays an orange, animated waveform icon next to the song that it’s
importing. As iTunes finishes importing each song, it displays a check mark
next to the song, as shown in Figure 5-4. (On a color monitor, you see that the
check mark is green.) iTunes chimes when it finishes the import list. When all
the songs are imported, eject the CD by clicking the Eject button at the lower-
right corner of the iTunes window. You can also choose Controls➪Eject Disc to
eject the disc, or click the Eject icon next to the disc’s name in the Source pane.
Importing Music Files
The quality of the music that you hear depends initially on the quality of the
source. Web sites and services offering music files vary widely. Some sites 
provide high-quality, legally derived songs that you can download, and some
provide only streaming audio, which you can play but not save on your hard
drive or on a CD (such as a Web radio station). The allegedly illegal file-sharing
services offering MP3 files can vary in quality. Unauthorized copies of songs
might be saved in a lower quality format to save space and download time, so
beware of less-than-high-quality knockoffs.
You can download the music file or copy it from another computer to your
hard drive. After you save or copy an MP3 file — or for that matter an AIFF or
WAV file — on your hard drive, you can simply drag it into the iTunes window
Figure 5-4:

Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music

to import it to your library. If you drag a folder or disk icon, all the audio files
that it contains are added to your iTunes library. You can also choose File➪
Add to Library as an alternative to dragging.
When you add a song to your iTunes library, a copy of the song file is placed
inside the iTunes Music folder — as long as you have your preferences set 
for iTunes to “Copy files to iTunes music folder when adding to library” (the
default setting).
If you want iTunes to store only links to song files on the hard drive and not
copy the files when you add songs, you can turn off the default copy files
option by choosing iTunes ➪Preferences on a Mac, or Edit ➪Preferences on a
Windows PC, clicking Advanced in the Preferences dialog, and turning off the
“Copy files to iTunes music folder when adding to library” setting.
You can check out the contents of your music folder using the Finder on a Mac
or Windows Explorer on a Windows PC. On the Mac, the iTunes Music folder
lives in the iTunes folder inside the Music folder in your Home folder. The
path to this folder is your home folder/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music. On
a Windows PC, the iTunes Music folder resides in the iTunes folder inside the
My Music folder of the My Documents folder in your user folder. The path to
this folder is Your User folder\My Documents\My Music\iTunes\iTunes
Music. These are the default locations — unless you turn off the default 
organization in iTunes by choosing iTunes ➪Preferences on a Mac, or Edit
➪Preferences on a Windows PC, clicking Advanced in the Preferences dialog
and choosing a new location for the music folder. 
When you import a song file into iTunes, the song is copied into a new file in
the iTunes library without changing or deleting the original file. You can then
convert the imported song to another format — for example, you can convert
an AIFF file to an MP3 file — while leaving the original intact. Find out about
converting your songs to a different format in Chapter 18.
MP3 CDs are easy to import — since they are essentially data CDs, simply
insert them into your CD-ROM drive, open the CD in the Finder, and drag-and-
drop the MP3 song files into the iTunes window. Downloaded song files are
even easier — just drag-and-drop the files into iTunes. If you drag a folder or
CD icon, all the audio files it contains are added to your iTunes library.
You can import any sound into iTunes, even music from scratchy old vinyl
records or sound effects recorded through a microphone. You might want to
import unusual sounds or digitize and preserve rare music that can’t be
found anywhere else.
How do you get stuff like that into iTunes? On a Mac, you can use GarageBand,
which is part of the iLife suite (available from the Apple Store and preinstalled
on all new Macs), or use a sound-editing program such as CD Spin Doctor (part
85
Chapter 5: Importing Music into iTunes

of the Toast package) or Sound Studio. These programs typically record from
any analog source device, such as a tape player or even a turntable. Sound
Studio lets you record and digitize directly to your hard drive on a Mac running
OS X. Some Mac models include a free copy of Sound Studio (you can find it in
the Applications folder). You can also download a copy from Felt Tip Software
(www.felttip.com/products/soundstudio) and use it for two weeks before
having to pay $49.99 for it. Toast 6 Titanium from Roxio (www.roxio.com) for
Mac OS X includes the CD Spin Doctor application for recording sounds.
There are many commercial applications to choose from that work on
Windows PCs, including Roxio’s Easy CD Creator 5 Platinum package, which
includes CD Spin Doctor. You can also use MusicMatch Jukebox to record
sound through a PC’s line-in connection. If you’re using MusicMatch, visit the
companion Web site at www.dummies.com/go/ipod.
AIFF- or WAV-encoded sound files occupy too much space in your music
library and iPod. Voice recordings and sound effects tend to be low-fidelity
and typically don’t sound any better in AIFF or WAV format than they do in
formats that save hard drive space. Also, sound effects and voice recordings
are typically mono rather than stereo. You can save hard drive and iPod
space and still have quality recordings by converting these files to MP3 or
AAC formats, changing them from stereo to mono in the process and leaving
the original versions intact. We describe converting songs in Chapter 18.
Importing Audio Books
Do you like to listen to audio books and spoken magazine and newspaper
articles? Not only can you bring these sounds into iTunes, but you can also
transfer them to an iPod and take them on the road, which is much more con-
venient than taking cassettes or CDs.
Audible is a leading provider of downloadable spoken audio files. Audible lets
you authorize computers to play the audio files, just like the iTunes Music
Store; see Chapter 4. Audible does require that you purchase the files, and its
content is also licensed by Apple to be included in the iTunes Music Store in
the Audio Books category. Audible content includes magazines and radio pro-
grams as well as books.
To import Audible files, follow these steps:
1. Go to www.audible.com and set up an account if you don’t already
have one.
2. Select and download an Audible audio file.
Files that end with .aa are Audible files.
86
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music

3. Drag the Audible file to the iTunes window.
If this is the first time that you’ve added an Audible file, iTunes asks for
your account information. You need to enter this information once for
each computer that you use with your Audible account.
To disable an Audible account, open iTunes on the computer that you no
longer want to use with the account, and choose Advanced➪Deauthorize
Computer. In the Deauthorize Computer dialog that appears, select the
Deauthorize Computer for Audible Account option and click OK.
You need to be online to authorize a computer or to remove the authoriza-
tion from that computer.

Sharing Music sans a Lawyer
In This Chapter
 Sharing music purchased from the iTunes Music Store
 Being generous with network music 
 Copying to other drives
 Copying from Macs to PCs and vice versa
H
ey, it’s your music after you buy it — that is, to the extent that you can
make copies for yourself. You want to play your music anywhere and
even share the music with your friends. It’s only natural.
You can easily share the music that you rip from your CDs: After the music
becomes digital, you can copy it endlessly with no loss in quality. You can
also share the songs that you download from a service. Of course, if the
songs are in a protected format (such as music bought from the iTunes Music
Store), the computers that access the shared library must be authorized to
play the music. However, iTunes lets you share a library over a local area net-
work (LAN) with other computers running iTunes. Whether the computers
are connected to the LAN by cable (such as thin Ethernet cabling) or by wire-
less technology such as Apple’s AirPort, you can share your library with
other computers — up to five other computers in a single 24-hour period.
In this chapter, we show you how to bend the rules and share music with
others. (After all, your parents taught you to share, didn’t they?)
Sharing the iTunes Music Store Wealth
To a limited extent, you can share the music that you buy online from the
iTunes Music Store. Apple uses a protected form of the AAC encoder for the
songs — the music filenames use the extension m4p for protected music,
rather than m4a for music in the regular AAC format. (Read all about format
encoders in Chapters 17 and 18.) Thus, more than with most other services,
the rights of artists are protected while also giving you more leeway in using
the music (although by the time you read this, other services might have
adopted this format with similar privileges).

The protected form of AAC used with iTunes Music Store songs lets you do
the following:
 Create backups. You can download the music files and make as many
copies as you want.
90
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 
I fought the law and the law won: 
Sharing and piracy
Apple CEO Steve Jobs gave personal demon-
strations of the iTunes Music Store and the iPod
to Paul McCartney and Mick Jagger before intro-
ducing the online music store. According to
Steven Levy at Newsweek (May 12, 2003), Jobs
said, “They both totally get it.” The former Beatle
and the Stones’ frontman are no slouches —
both conduct music-business affairs personally
and both have extensive back catalogs of music.
They know all about the free music-swapping
services on the Internet, but they agree with
Jobs that most people are willing to pay for high-
quality music rather than download free copies
of questionable quality.
We think the solution to piracy is not technology
because determined pirates always circumvent
it with newer technology, and only consumers
are inconvenienced.
Giving music away is, of course, the subject of
much controversy, with services such as the
original Napster closed by court order while
others flourish in countries that don’t have
copyright laws as strict as the United States
has. (Napster is back, but it no longer provides
the same type of music sharing.) 
The songs that you hear from free sharing ser-
vices such as KaZaa are (for the most part) low
quality, on a par with FM radio broadcasts.
They’re nice for listening to new songs to see
whether you like them, but they’re not useful for
acquiring as part of your real music collection.
The iTunes Music Store is clearly superior in
quality and convenience, and we prefer the
original authorized version of the song — not
some knock-off that might have been copied
from a radio broadcast.
As for making copies for personal use, the law
is murky at best. It depends on what you mean
by personal use. The iLife package allows you
to use these music files in creative projects. You
can, for example, put together a music video to
show your friends by using iMovie to combine
some video footage that you shot with your
camcorder along with the latest hit by Eminem.
However, don’t expect to see it on MTV or VH1.
Your local public access cable TV station can’t
even play it unless you first obtain the broadcast
rights (which typically includes contacting 
the music publisher, the record label, and the
artist — good luck).
Can you legally use a pop song as a soundtrack
for a high school yearbook slideshow? It sounds
legal to us, given the ability to use music for
educational purposes, but you should ask a
lawyer. If you’re interested in obtaining the
rights to music to use in semi-public or public
presentations, or even movies and documen-
taries for public distribution, you can contact
the music publisher or a licensing agent. Music-
publishing organizations, such as the Music
Publishers’ Association (www.mpa.org), offer
information and lists of music publishers, as
well as explanations of various rights and
licenses.

 Copy music to iTunes libraries on other computers. Play songs on up
to five separate computers. See Chapter 4 to find out how to authorize
your computers.
 Copy music to iPods. Copy the music files to as many iPods as you
want. See Chapter 10 for automatic and manual iPod updating.
 Burn up to seven CDs. Burn seven copies of the same playlist contain-
ing protected songs to an audio CD, but no more. See Chapter 12 for tips
on CD burning.
 Share music over a network. Up to five computers running iTunes on a
LAN can play the music in your shared library in the same 24-hour period.
You can also play music in your library over a wireless connection to a stereo
amplifier or receiver by using AirTunes and AirPort Express, as we describe
in Chapter 16.
Regardless of whether you manage files on your hard drive on a regular basis,
you might want to know where these songs are stored so that you can copy
the music to other computers and back up the entire library. You might also
want to move the library to another computer — after all, these computers
just keep getting better year after year.
You can play your purchased music on any authorized computer, you can
authorize up to five at once, and you can remove authorization from any
computer that you don’t use. Also, up to five computers can share your
music library on a LAN in a given 24-hour period.
Sharing Music in a Network
If you live like the Jetsons — with a computer in every room, connected by a
wireless or wired network — iTunes is made for you. You can share the music
in your library with other computers in the same network. These computers
can be PCs running Windows or Macs, as long as they are all running iTunes.
If they can communicate with each other over the network, iTunes can share
a music library with up to five PCs in a single 24-hour period. The restriction
to five in a 24-hour period is yet another one imposed by the record labels.
When you share songs on a network, the song is streamed from the computer
that contains the songs in its library (the library computer) to your com-
puter over the network. A stream arrives in your computer bit by bit; the
computer starts playing the stream as soon as the first set of bits arrive,
and more sections are transferred while you listen, so you hear it as a con-
tinual stream. Broadcasters use this technology to continually transmit new
content (like a radio station). The song is not copied to your music library.
From your computer, you can’t burn the shared-library songs onto a CD or
copy the songs to your iPod.
91
Chapter 6: Sharing Music sans a Lawyer

You can share radio links, MP3, AIFF, and WAV files — and even AAC files and
music purchased from the iTunes Music store — but not Audible spoken
word files or QuickTime sound files.
To share your music library — turning your computer into the library 
computer — follow these steps:
1. Choose Preferences (from the iTunes menu on a Mac or from the Edit
menu on a Windows PC) and click the Sharing tab.
The Sharing pane appears, as shown in Figure 6-1, offering options for
sharing music.
2. Select the Share My Music option.
3. In the same dialog, select either the Share Entire Library option or 
the Share Selected Playlists option (and then choose the playlists to
share).
4. Type a name for the shared library and add a password if you want.
The name that you choose appears in the Source list for other comput-
ers that share it. The password restricts access to those who know it.
Use a password that you don’t mind letting others know — not the pass-
word for the online music store or any other secret password.
Pick a password that you don’t mind sharing with others; for example,
your name is a good password, but your ATM PIN is not.

iTunes displays a Reminder: Sharing music is for personal use

5. Click OK.
You can access the music from the other computers on the network by fol-
lowing these steps:
1. Choose Preferences (from the iTunes menu on a Mac or from the Edit
menu on a Windows PC) and click the Sharing tab.
The Sharing window appears, offering options for sharing music. Refer
to Figure 6-1.
2. Select the Look for Shared Music option.

Chapter 6: Sharing Music sans a Lawyer

When you are finished sharing a music library, click the tiny Eject button that
appears to the right of the shared library name in the Source pane.
Before turning off sharing for your library, you must first notify anyone 
sharing the library to eject the shared library before turning off the sharing
feature. Otherwise, iTunes displays a warning dialog allowing you to either
continue (and break off the connection to the shared library) or to leave
sharing turned on for the moment.
Sharing a music library can be incredibly useful for playing music on laptops,
such as PowerBooks, that support the wireless AirPort network.
Copying Songs to Other Computers
You can copy songs freely from your iTunes window to other hard drives and
computers, or copy the song folders from the iTunes Music folder to other
hard drives and computers. On the Mac, you can use the Finder to copy song
files as well as dragging songs out of the iTunes window into folders or hard
drives. Windows PCs offer several methods, including using Windows
Explorer to copy files.
By default, the files are organized in folders by artist name and by album
within the iTunes Music folder — unless you change options in the Advanced
section of iTunes Preferences, as described in Chapter 11. Copying an entire
Figure 6-3:

94
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 

album, or every song by a specific artist, is easy — just drag the folder to a
folder on another hard drive.
You can find out the location of any song by selecting the song in iTunes and
choosing File➪Get Info. Click the Summary tab in the Get Info dialog to see
the Summary pane.
Although you can change the location of your music library as described in
Chapter 11, most people leave the music library in its default location —
inside the iTunes Music folder in the iTunes folder.
On the Mac, the iTunes Music folder can be found by default at your home
folder/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music. On a Windows PC, the iTunes Music
folder can be found at your user folder/My Documents/My Music/
iTunes/iTunes Music.
Your playlists, including the library itself (which is in some ways a giant
playlist), are stored as eXtensible Markup Language (XML) files in the iTunes
folder along with your iTunes Music folder.
The easiest way to copy an album from a folder on a hard drive into your
iTunes library is to drag the album’s folder over the iTunes window and drop
it there. If you drop it into the Source pane, iTunes creates a playlist of the
album’s songs using the album name. To copy individual songs, you can drag
the song files over the iTunes window and drop them. When you add a song
to your iTunes library, a copy is placed inside the iTunes Music folder.
Copying Songs between PCs and Macs
Song files are not small, and album folders filled with songs are quite large.
Copying a music library from a Mac to a PC, or vice versa, is not a simple task
because of the enormity of the file sizes.
Attaching a file to an e-mail message is the most popular method of transfer-
ring a file to someone, but there is a limit as to what you can attach. Most
e-mail servers in the world won’t accept an attachment larger than 5MB;
some won’t accept larger than 3MB. Don’t even think about e-mail. If the file is
over four, it won’t go through the door. (Four megabytes, that is; and the door
is the limitation of your Internet service provider’s e-mail server.) If you use a
.Mac e-mail account, the limitation is 10MB.
Well, heck, just about every jazz tune and Grateful Dead jam we listen to in
iTunes is larger than 3MB. A song compressed in the AAC or MP3 format is
typically between 2 and 10MB, so you might get by with one pop song
attached to an e-mail, but that’s it.
95
Chapter 6: Sharing Music sans a Lawyer

How do you transfer larger amounts of music? One way would be with an
external FireWire or a USB hard drive formatted for a PC — an iPod installed
for Windows would do nicely, and you can learn all about using an iPod as a
hard drive in Chapter 23. The Mac should recognize it when you plug it in,
even though the drive is formatted for Windows, and you can copy files
directly to the hard drive, and then take the hard drive over to your PC. You
need FireWire or USB to connect an external drive. (USB is much slower.)
On a LAN you can share forever — if your computers communicate over a
local-area network, they can share files . . . even large ones. To copy large
song files or entire album folders between two Macs in a LAN, all you need to
do is allow personal file sharing on your Mac. This sounds like a liberal thing
to do, inviting all sorts of mischief and voyeurism, but you can control what
others can do. (The converse is true: If someone wants to make a file or
folder available to you over a LAN, all he has to do is enable personal file
sharing.) 
Mac OS X makes it very easy to share files and folders with Windows comput-
ers. You can enable Windows file sharing on the Mac, or access the Windows
computer from a Mac. To access a Windows PC from a Mac, you need a valid
user ID and password for an account on the Windows computer. You can go
right to that account’s Home directory on the Windows computer and use
your Mac to copy folders and files to and from the Windows computer. For
more information about file sharing on a Mac (specifically between Mac and
Windows computers on a network), see Mac OS X Panther All-in-One Desk
Reference For Dummies, by Mark L. Chambers (Wiley).
Copying very large song files over the Internet is a bit more complex, involv-
ing use of a communication application such as iChat AV, or one that offers
the File Transfer Protocol (FTP). Although it’s easy to download an MP3 song
file from a Web page or an FTP site with any browser (all you need is the Web
or FTP address — and a user ID and password if the site is protected), you
can’t send the file to a protected site with most browsers unless the site is set
up for this function. One easy way to share your files from a Mac is to use the
.Mac service to create a Web page that accommodates anyone with the right
password, even Windows-using folks, to visit and download files you put
there. For information about setting up a .Mac account, see iLife All-in-One
Desk Reference For Dummies, by yours truly (Wiley).
To make it easy for others to copy files to and from a Mac at their conve-
nience, enable FTP access for the Mac. To do this, open System Preferences,
click the Sharing icon, and click the Services button. Select the FTP Access
option. A message at the bottom of the Sharing window provides the address
of your FTP server on your Mac — something like ftp://192.168.1.246/.
Give this address to those with an account on your computer, and they can
access files and folders by using a Web browser, an FTP client such as Fetch,
or Mac OS X. If you’ve turned on the firewall in Mac OS X, click the Firewall
button and select the FTP Access option; this allows FTP access through the
firewall.
96
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 

How about transferring song files to other FTP sites, such as a password-
protected site that requires use of an FTP client? You have several options:
 Use an FTP client, such as Fetch or Rbrowser 4 for Mac OS X, or FTP
Explorer for Windows. You can find Fetch at http://fetchsoftworks.
com for $25 as of this writing. You can use it for several weeks before
paying for it. Rbrowser 4 (www.rbrowser.com) is free to download and
use, and looks a bit like the Mac Finder. FTP Explorer (www.ftpx.com) is
shareware you can use for a month before paying $35. (Students and fac-
ulty members can use it for free.)
 Use the FTP function inside another application, such as Macromedia
Dreamweaver.
 Use a free Terminal application, such as the one supplied with Mac OS X,
found in the Utilities folder inside your Applications folder, which offers
FTP. For instructions, see Mac OS X Panther All-in-One Desk Reference For
Dummies, by Mark L. Chambers (Wiley).
Most FTP utilities and functions within applications provide an easy way to
copy files; for example, Fetch provides a drag-and-drop interface for transfer-
ring any type of file with FTP servers. After you establish a connection with
the FTP server by typing the appropriate information (the FTP server name,
your ID, your password, and the directory that you have access to), you can
drag files to and from the FTP server window via the Finder, or you can
browse folders to select files and then use the Get and Put Files buttons.
You can send an entire folder of files, such as an album of songs or an artist
folder with multiple albums, by stuffing the folder (or even a set of folders)
into a compressed Zip file. (Zip is a standard compression format.) Select the
files or folders and right-click the selection. In Mac OS X, choose Create
Archive; in Windows, choose WinZip (or similar Zip utility that installs itself
into Windows menus). 
You can then transfer the Zip file to the FTP server in one step. While the Zip
file formats compress other types of files, the files won’t get any smaller if
your music files are already compressed as MP3 or AAC. However, the format
offers a compact way of sending an entire folder of files.

 Sorting the song list
 Searching for songs or artists
You rip a few CDs, buy some songs from the iTunes Music Store, and then
watch your music library fill up with songs. That song list keeps getting
longer and longer — and as a result, your library is harder to navigate.
The iTunes Library is awesome even by everyday jukebox standards. Though
previous versions were limited to a paltry (!) 32,000 songs per library and you
had to create multiple libraries to get around that limit, version 4 and up can
hold a virtually unlimited number of songs (depending on how much space
you have on your hard drive). 
Consider that a 60GB iPod can hold about 15,000 songs in the AAC format —
enough music to last at least a month if played 24 hours a day! Even if you
keep your iTunes library down to the size of what you can fit on your iPod,
you still have a formidable collection at your fingertips. If you’re a music lover
and your music collection is getting large, you’ll want to organize your collec-
tion to make finding songs easier. After all, finding U2’s “I Still Haven’t Found
What I’m Looking For” is a challenge even in a library of only 32,000 songs.
This chapter shows you how to search, browse, and sort your music library in
iTunes. You can find any song in seconds and display songs sorted by artist,
album, genre of music, or other attributes. You can change the viewing options
to make your library’s display more useful.

Browsing by Artist and Album
Overwhelmed by the long list of songs? Try browsing: Switch from Song List
view to Browse view to find songs more easily. When you select an album in
Browse view, iTunes displays only the songs for that album.
If you don’t get track information from the Internet for each song (as we show
in Chapter 5) or type it in yourself (as described in Chapter 8), iTunes displays
a blank space for Artist and Album name and “Track 01” and so on for each
track. That would make it difficult to browse for a song or artist by name.
To view albums in Browse view, click the Browse button in the upper-right
corner. iTunes organizes your music library by genre, artist, and album,
which makes finding just the right tunes easier, as shown in Figure 7-1. Click
the Browse button again to return to the Song List view — the Browse button
toggles between Browse view and the Song List view.
The Browse view sorts the songs by genre, artist, and album. Click a genre in
the Genre column to see artists in that genre, or click All at the top of the
Genre column to see all artists for all genres.
When you click an artist in the Artist column in the middle column (as shown
in Figure 7-2), the album titles appear in the Album column on the right. At
the top of the Album column, the All selection is highlighted, and the songs
from every album by that artist appear in the song list below the Genre,
Artist and Album columns.

Part II: Managing Your Music 

To see more than one album from an artist at a time, hold down the Ctrl on a
Windows PC (Ô key on a Mac), and click each album name.
As you click different albums in the Album column, the song list displays the
songs from that album. The songs are listed in proper track order, just as the
artist, producer, or record label intended them — assuming the track infor-
mation has been downloaded from the Internet or typed in manually.
This is great for selecting songs from albums, but what if you want to look
at all the songs by all the artists in the library at once? You can see all the
songs in the library in Browse view by selecting All at the top of each of the
columns — Genre, Artist, and Album.
Note that iTunes considers Clash and The Clash to be different groups,
although it sorts them properly under C. We show you how to edit the artist
name and other information in Chapter 8.
Understanding the Song Indicators
As you make choices in iTunes, it displays an action indicator next to each
song to show you what it’s doing. Here’s a list of the song indicators and what
they mean:
 Orange waveform: iTunes is importing the song.
 Green check mark: iTunes has finished importing the song.

 Exclamation point: iTunes can’t find the song. You might have moved or
deleted the song accidentally. You can move the song back to iTunes by
dragging it from your hard drive into the iTunes window.
 Broadcast icon: The song is on the Internet and plays as a music stream.
 Black check mark: The songs are marked for the next operation, such as
importing from an audio CD or playing in sequence. Click to remove the
check mark.
 Speaker: The song is playing.
 Chasing arrows: iTunes is copying the song from another location or
downloading the song from the Internet.
Changing Viewing Options
iTunes lets you customize the song list view. The list starts out with the Song
Name, Time, Artist, Album, Genre, My Rating, Play Count, and Last Played
categories. You might have to drag the horizontal scroll bar along the bottom
of the song list to see all these columns. You can display more or less infor-
mation, or different information, in your song list. You can also display
columns in a different order from left to right.
To make a column wider or narrower, drag the dividing line between the
column and the next column to its right. As you move your cursor over the
divider, it changes to a vertical bar with opposing arrows extending left and
right; you can click and drag the divider to change the column’s width.
You can also change the order of columns from left to right by clicking a
column heading and dragging the entire column to the left or right — except
that you can’t change the position of the Song Name column and the narrow
column to its left (which displays indicators). In addition, you can Control-
click (Ctrl-click) or right-click any of the column headings to display a 
shortcut menu offering the same options as the View Options window, 
the Auto Size Column option, and the Auto Size All Columns option.
Maybe you don’t like certain columns, like when they take up too much valu-
able screen space; or perhaps you want to display some other information
about the song. You can add or remove columns such as Size (for file size),
Date and Year (for the date the album was released, or any other date you
choose for each song), Bit Rate, Sample Rate, Track Number, and Comment.
To add or delete columns, choose Edit➪View Options.
The View Options dialog appears, as shown in Figure 7-3, and you can select
the columns that you want to appear in the song list. To pick a column, 
mark the check box next to the column’s heading, indicating that column 
will be shown. Any unchecked column headings are columns that do not
104
Part II: Managing Your Music 

appear in the song list in iTunes. Note: The Song Name column always
appears in the iTunes song list and can’t be removed, which is why it doesn’t
appear in the View Options dialog. You can also change the view options by
Ô-clicking on a Mac (Ctrl-clicking on a PC) any of the column headings in the
song list in either Browse or Song List view.
Change the viewing options to suit your needs. You might want to display the
Time column to know at a glance the duration of any song. Or maybe you
want the Date or Year columns to differentiate songs from different eras, or
the Genre column to differentiate songs from different musical genres.
Browse view includes a Genre column on the left side. If you don’t need a
Genre column, you can remove it from the Browse view (or add it back) by
choosing Preferences (from the iTunes menu on a Mac, or the Edit menu in
Windows). Click the General button at the top of the Preferences window. In
the General dialog, disable the “Show genre when browsing” option, which is
on by default.
Sorting Songs by Viewing Options
Knowing how to set viewing options is a good idea because you can use the
viewing options to sort the listing of songs. Whether you’re in Browse view or
viewing the song list in its entirety, the column headings double as sorting
options.
For example, clicking the Time heading reorders the songs by their duration
in ascending order from shortest to longest. If you click the Time header
again, the sort is reversed, starting with the longest song. You can sort by
any column heading, such as Artist, Album, Track, and Ratings. You might
Figure 7-3:
The viewing
options for
the song list.
105
Chapter 7: Searching, Browsing, and Sorting in iTunes

want to add the Date Added column to the Song List or Browse view, so that
you can sort your library by the date you added the song.
You can tell which way the sort is sorting — ascending or descending order —
by the little arrow indicator in the heading. When the arrow points up, the sort
is in ascending order; when pointing down, it’s in descending order.
Alternatively, you can sort the song list in alphabetical order. Click the Artist
heading to sort all the songs in the list by the artist name, in alphabetical
order (arrow pointing up). Click it again to sort the list in reverse alphabeti-
cal order (arrow pointing down).
Searching for Songs
As your music library grows, you might find locating a particular song by the
usual browsing and scrolling methods that we describe earlier in this chapter
too time-consuming. Let iTunes find your songs for you!
If you want to search the entire library in Browse view, first click the All selec-
tions at the top of the Genre and Artist columns to browse the entire library
before typing a term in the Search field. Or, if you prefer, click the Browse
button again to return to the Song List view, which lists the entire library.
Locate the Search field — the oval field in the top-right corner, to the left of
the Browse button — and follow these steps:
1. Click in the Search field, and then type several characters of your
search term, using these tips for best searching:
• You can search for a song title, an artist, or an album title.
• Typing very few characters results in a long list of possible songs,
but the search narrows down as you type more characters.
• The Search features ignore case — for example, when we search
for miles, iTunes finds “Eight Miles High,” “She Smiles Like a River,”
and everything by Miles Davis.
2. The results display as you type.
The search operation works immediately, as shown in Figure 7-4, dis-
playing in the song list any matches in the Song Name, Artist, and Album
columns.
If you’re in Browse view with an artist and a particular album selected,
you can’t search for another artist or song. Use browsing with searching
to further narrow your search.
106
Part II: Managing Your Music 

3. Scroll through the search results and click a song to select it.
The search operation works immediately, searching for matches in the
Song Name, Artist, and Album columns of the listing.
To back out of a search so that the full list appears again, you can either click
the circled X in the Search field (which appears only after you start typing
characters) or delete the characters in the Search field. You then see the
entire list of songs in the library’s song list, just as before you began your
search. All the songs are still there and remain there unless you explicitly
remove them. Searching only manipulates your view of the songs.
Showing the Current Song and Song File
Getting lost in a large library is easy. As you browse your song library, you
may want to return quickly to view the current song playing. While the song
is playing, choose File➪Show Current Song (or use Ô-L or Ctrl-L as a short-
cut). iTunes switches the view back to show you the currently playing song.
You can also show the location of the song file for any song. This trick can
come in handy if you want to copy the song file to another hard drive or over
a network, or open it in another application. Choose File➪Show Song File (or
use Ô-R or Ctrl-R as a shortcut), and iTunes switches control back to the
operating system (Mac or Windows), which displays the folder containing the
song file. You can show the song file if it is on your hard drive, but not if it is
in a shared library on another computer.
Figure 7-4:

any song
titles, album

107
Chapter 7: Searching, Browsing, and Sorting in iTunes

Showing Duplicate Songs
As your library grows larger, you may want to check for duplications — some
songs that appear on artist CDs also appear on compilation or soundtrack
CDs. If you rip them all, you could have duplicate songs that take up space
on your hard drive.
On the other hand, maybe you want to find different versions of the same
song by the same artist. iTunes can find all the songs with the same title by
the same artist quickly, even when the songs appear on different albums.
To show duplicate songs in the song list, choose Edit➪Show Duplicate Songs.
iTunes displays all the duplicate songs in alphabetical order in the song list.
If you are in Browse view, iTunes displays all the duplicate songs in artist
order — click the artist to see the duplicate songs for that artist, as shown
in Figure 7-5.
To stop showing duplicate songs and return to your previous view (either
song list or Browse view), click the Show All Songs button below the list of
duplicate songs.

Chapter 8
Adding and Editing Song
Information in iTunes
In This Chapter
 Retrieving information online
 Putting in song information
 Adding more information, album artwork, comments, and ratings
O
rganization depends on information. You expect your computer to do a
lot more than just store a song with Track 01 as the only identifier.
Adding all the song information for your tracks seems like a lot of trouble,
but you can get most of the information automatically from the Internet —
without all that pesky typing. Adding song information is important because
you don’t want your ripped CD music to have vague song titles like Track 03.
You certainly don’t want to mistakenly play “My Guitar Wants to Kill Your
Mama” by Frank Zappa when trying to impress your classical music teacher
with Tchaikovsky’s 3rd Movement, Pathétique Symphony, do you?
This chapter shows you how to add song information to your music library in
iTunes, and edit it for better viewing, so that you can organize your music by
artist, album name, genre, composer, and ratings, and then sort the Song List
or Browse view using this information by clicking the column headings.
Retrieving Information from the Internet
Why bother entering song information if someone else has already done it for
you? You can easily get information about most music CDs from the Internet —
if you can connect to the Internet. 

Retrieving information automatically
During the iTunes setup process that we describe in Chapter 2, you specify
whether iTunes connects automatically to the Internet. If you have an always-
on Internet connection, you probably set up iTunes to connect automatically;
if you use a modem to manually connect, you probably set up iTunes to not
connect automatically.
Even with a manual modem connection to the Internet, though, you can tem-
porarily change the setup of your Internet connection to connect automati-
cally at any time. Just follow these steps:
1. Choose Preferences (from the iTunes menu on a Mac, or the Edit
menu on a Windows PC).
The Preferences dialog appears.
2. Click the General button.
The General dialog appears.
3. Select the Connect to Internet When Needed option.
With this option enabled for a modem connection, iTunes triggers your
modem automatically (like a Web browser), calls your Internet service
provider (ISP), and completes the connection process before retrieving
the track information. With this option disabled (cleared), iTunes asks
first before connecting to the Internet.
You can always stop an automatic modem connection at any time — a good
idea if your ISP or phone service charges extra fees based on timed usage.
When iTunes finishes grabbing the song information from the Internet, switch
to your remote connection program without quitting iTunes, terminate the
Internet connection, and then switch back to iTunes. That way, you can leave
your Preferences setting to connect when needed and still terminate any con-
nection right after using it.
Retrieving information manually
You can connect to the Internet at any time manually (such as with a modem
connection) and retrieve the song information when you are ready to use it.
After you connect to the Internet, choose Advanced➪Get CD Track Names.
Even if you automatically connect to the Internet, the song information data-
base on the Internet (Gracenote CDDB) might be momentarily unavailable,
or you might have a delayed response. If at first you don’t succeed, choose
Advanced➪Get CD Track Names again.
110
Part II: Managing Your Music 

After connecting and retrieving track information using a modem, your Internet
service might still be connected until the service hangs up on you. You might
want to switch to a browser, without quitting iTunes, and surf the Web to make
use of the connection — and use iTunes to play music while you surf.
Entering Song Information
You have to manually enter the song information for CDs that are not known by
the Gracenote CDDB or for custom CD-Rs. No big deal, though — just enter a
song’s information in either Browse view or song list view. Click directly in the
information field, such as Artist, and then click again so that the mouse pointer
turns into an editing cursor. You can then type text into the field.
111
Chapter 8: Adding and Editing Song Information in iTunes
Long distance information: Using 
the Gracenote database
The first time we popped an audio CD into the
computer, song information appeared like magic.
iTunes displayed the song names, album title,
and artist names automatically. How did it know?
This information isn’t stored on a standard music
CD in digital form — iTunes has to recognize the
disc somehow.
The magic is that the software knows how to
reach out and find the information on the
Internet — in the Gracenote CDDB service.
(CDDB stands for — you guessed it — CD
Database.) The site (www.gracenote.com)
hosts CDDB on the Web and offers the ability to
search for music CDs by artist, song title, and
other methods. The iTunes software already
knows how to use this database, so you don’t
have to!
Gracenote recognizes an audio CD by taking
into account the number, sequence, and dura-
tion of tracks (which is why the database can
recognize CD-Rs that are burned with the
identical songs in the same order). The data-
base keeps track of information for most of the
music CDs that you find on the market.
Although the database doesn’t contain any
information about personal or custom CDs,
people can submit information to the database
about CDs that the database doesn’t know. You
can even do this from within iTunes — type the
information for each track while the audio CD is
in your computer, and then choose Advanced➪
Submit CD Track Names. The information that
you enter is sent to the Gracenote CDDB site,
where the good people who work tirelessly on
the database check out your information before
including it. In fact, if you spot a typo or some-
thing erroneous in the information that you
receive from the Gracenote CDDB, you can cor-
rect it, and then use the Submit CD Track Names
command to send the corrected version back to
the Gracenote site. The good folks at Gracenote
appreciate the effort.

After grabbing the song information from the Internet or typing it yourself,
iTunes keeps track of the information for the CD even if you just play the CD
without importing it. The next time you insert the CD, the song information is
automatically filled in.
After you enter the information for a rare CD, consider submitting the song
information to the Gracenote CDDB for others to use. Enter the information
for each track while the audio CD is in your computer, and then choose
Advanced➪Submit CD Track Names. The information that you type is sent
to the Gracenote CDDB site, where it is checked first for accuracy and then
posted for others to use.
Editing the Information
Retrieving ready-made song information off the Internet is a great help, but
you might not always like the format it comes in. At some time or another, you
might want to edit artist and band names. For example, we like to list solo
artists by last name rather than by first name (as listings from the Gracenote
CDDB often are) — we routinely change Miles Davis to Davis, Miles.
Other annoyances sometimes occur in the CDDB, such as bands with The at
the beginning of their names, such as The Who, The Band, The Beatles, and
The Beach Boys. Even though these names sort correctly (in alphabetical
order under their proper name), we dislike having The before the band name,
so we routinely remove it.
In either Browse view or the Song List view, you can edit a song’s information
by clicking directly in the specific track’s field (such as the Artist field), and
clicking again so that the mouse pointer turns into an editing cursor. You can
then select the text and type over it, or use the Copy, Cut, and Paste com-
mands in the Edit menu, to move tiny bits of text around within the field. As
you can see in Figure 8-1, we changed the Artist field to be Beck, Jeff.
You can edit the Song Name, Artist, Album, Genre, and My Ratings fields right
in the song list. However, editing this information with File➪Get Info is easier.
Keep reading to find out.
Editing multiple songs at once
Editing in the song list is fine if you’re editing the information for one song,
but typically you need to change all the tracks of an audio CD. For example, if
a CD of songs by Bob Dylan is listed with the artist as Bob Dylan, you might
want to change all the songs at once to Dylan, Bob. Changing all the song
information in one fell swoop is fast and clean, but like most powerful short-
cuts, you need to be careful because it can be dangerous.
112
Part II: Managing Your Music 

You can change a group of songs in either Browse view or the song list view.
Follow these steps to change a group of songs at once:
1. Select a group of songs by clicking the first song and then holding
down the Shift key as you click the last song.
All the songs between the first and last are highlighted. You can extend a
selection by Shift-clicking other songs or add to a selection by Ô-clicking
on a Mac, or Ctrl-clicking on a Windows PC. You can also remove songs
already selected by Ô-clicking on a Mac or Ctrl-clicking on a PC.
2. Choose File➪Get Info or press Ô-I (Mac) or Ctrl-I (PC).
A warning message displays: Are you sure you want to edit
information for multiple items?
Speed-editing the information in multiple songs at once can be danger-
ous for your library organization. If, for example, you change the song
title, the entire selection then has that song title. So be careful about
what you edit when doing this. We recommend leaving the Do Not Ask
Me Again check box cleared so that the warning appears whenever you
try this.
3. Click Yes to edit information for multiple items.
The Multiple Song Information dialog appears, as shown in Figure 8-2.
Figure 8-1:
Click inside
a field to
edit the
information.
113
Chapter 8: Adding and Editing Song Information in iTunes

4. Edit the field you want to change (typically the Artist field) for the
multiple songs.
When you edit a field, a check mark appears automatically in the check
box next to the field. iTunes assumes that you want that field changed in
all the selected songs. Make sure that no other check box is selected
except the field that you want, which is typically the Artist field (and
perhaps the Genre field).
5. Click OK to make the change.
iTunes changes the field for the entire selection of songs.
You can edit the song information before importing the audio tracks from a
CD. The edited track information for the CD imports with the music. What’s
interesting is that when you access the library without the audio CD, the
edited version of the track information is still there — iTunes remembers CD
information from the CDs you previously inserted. Even if you don’t import
the CD tracks, iTunes remembers the edited song information until the next
time you insert that audio CD.
Editing fields for a song
Although the track information grabbed from the Internet is enough for identi-
fying songs in your iTunes library, some facts — such as composer credits —
are not included. Composer information is important for iPod users because
the iPod allows you to scroll music by composer as well as by artist, album,
and song. Adding composer credits is usually worth your while because you
can then search and sort by composer and create playlists.

Part II: Managing Your Music 

After your songs import into the music library, locate a single song and choose
File➪Get Info (or press Ô-I). You see the song’s information dialog, as shown in
Figure 8-3.
When you select one song, the Song Information dialog appears; when you
select multiple songs, the Multiple Song Information dialog appears. Be care-
ful when selecting multiple songs and using the Get Info command.
The Song Information dialog offers the following tabs:
 Summary: The Summary tab (as shown in Figure 8-3) offers useful infor-
mation about the music file’s format and location on your hard drive; the
music file size; and information about the digital compression method
(bit rate, sample rate, and so on).
 Info: The Info tab allows you to change the song name, artist, composer,
album, genre, year, and other information, and you can also add com-
ments, as shown in Figure 8-4.
 Options: The Options tab offers volume adjustment, choice of equalizer
preset, ratings, and start and stop times for each song. You can assign
up to five stars to a song (your own rating system, equivalent to the Top
40 charts).
 Artwork: The Artwork tab allows you to add or delete artwork for the
song. The iTunes Music Store supplies artwork with most songs. Read
how to add artwork in the upcoming section, “Adding Album Cover Art
or Images.”
Figure 8-3:

115
Chapter 8: Adding and Editing Song Information in iTunes

You can edit the song information one song at a time and still move quickly
one song at a time through an album (without having to close the song infor-
mation dialog and reopen it) by clicking the Previous or Next buttons in the
bottom-left corner of the dialog to jump from song to song in an album.
Adding a rating
iTunes also allows you to rate songs, and the cool thing about ratings is that
they’re yours. You can use them to mean anything you want. For example, you
can rate songs based on how much you like them, whether your mother would
listen to them, or how they blend into a work environment. Then you can use
the My Top Rated playlist to automatically play the top-rated songs in the
library. You find out more about playlists in Chapter 9.
To add a rating to a song, click the Options tab, as shown in Figure 8-5. Drag
inside the My Rating field to add stars — the upper limit is five stars (for best).
You might have noticed the My Top Rated playlist in the Source pane. This
playlist is an example of a smart playlist — a playlist that updates itself when
ratings are changed. The My Top Rated playlist plays all the top-rated songs
in the library.
You can also add a rating to a song: Select the song in the song list, choose
File➪My Rating, and select a set of stars for the rating (or None). If you
include a Rating column in your song list, you can drag within the Rating
column to add a rating to a song.

button, as shown in Figure 8-6. The artwork changes for each song or album
that you select.

Chapter 8: Adding and Editing Song Information in iTunes

Unfortunately, you don’t get free artwork like this when you rip an audio CD —
the discs aren’t manufactured with digital cover art stashed somewhere on
an empty track. With a scanner, however, you can scan the cover art and save
it in a graphics format that iTunes (and its underlying graphics technology,
QuickTime) understands — JPEG, GIF, PNG, TIFF, or Photoshop. Or with a Web
browser, you can visit Web pages to scout for suitable art; just Ctrl-click (Mac)
or right-click an image (PC) to download and save the image on your hard
drive. (Most graphics on the Web are in JPEG or GIF format, so you don’t have
to convert anything.)
To add artwork to one or more songs, select the song or songs in your iTunes
library and drag the artwork’s image file from a folder into the artwork view-
ing area. That area is in the bottom-left corner of the iTunes window.
To add the same image as artwork for an entire album of songs (rather than
just individual songs), select the album in Browse view first (or select all the
songs in the album in song list view), and then drag the image file into the
artwork viewing area.
To add artwork to a single song, you can choose File➪Get Info to open the
song information window, click the Artwork tab, click the Add button, browse
your hard drive or network for the image file, and select the file. Click OK to
close the song information window.
You can also add the artwork to an album while editing multiple songs at
once. Follow these steps:
1. In Browse view, select the album in your iTunes library.
Click the Browse button to switch to Browse view so that an Album
column appears on the right side of the iTunes window. Click an album
to select it.
2. Choose File➪Get Info or press Ô-I (Mac) or Ctrl-I (PC).
A warning message displays: Are you sure you want to edit
information for multiple items?
3. Click Yes to edit information for multiple items.
The Multiple Song Information dialog appears.
4. Enable the Artwork field by selecting its check box.
When you add a check mark to a field, iTunes assumes you want that
field changed in all the selected songs. Make sure that no other check
box is selected except Artwork.

5. Drag the graphics file to the Artwork panel.
Drag the graphics file directly over the blank Artwork well in the
Multiple Song Information dialog.
6. Click OK to make the change.
A warning message displays: Are you sure you want to change
the artwork for multiple items?
7. Click Yes to change the artwork.
iTunes adds the artwork for the entire album.
To remove the artwork from a song, view the artwork in a larger window, or
resize the artwork, choose File➪Get Info and click the Artwork tab. You can
add a different image, add several images, delete the images with the Add or
Delete buttons, or resize images with the size slider.
You can remove the artwork for an entire album by opening the Multiple Song
Information dialog (choose File➪Get Info after selecting the album), enabling
the Artwork field, and then clicking OK. Because you haven’t added anything
to the Artwork field, iTunes replaces the artwork with nothing, effectively
deleting the artwork.

 Creating and editing smart playlists
 Deleting songs, albums, artists, and playlists
 Creating an iMix playlist for the iTunes Music Store
T
o organize your music for different operations, such as copying to your
iPod or burning a CD, you make a playlist — a list of the songs that you
want.
You can use playlists to organize your music playback experience. For exam-
ple, you can make a playlist of love songs from different albums to play the
next time you need a romantic mood or compile a playlist of surf songs for a
trip to the beach. We create playlists specifically for use with an iPod on road
trips, and we generate other playlists that combine songs from different
albums based on themes or similarities. For example, we have a jazz playlist
for cruising around at night in the city, a classic rock playlist for jogging in
the morning, and a playlist of rain songs to celebrate rainy days.
You can create as many playlists of songs, in any order, as you like. The song
files themselves don’t change, nor are they copied — the music files stay
right where they are, with their names stored in the playlists. 
You can even create a smart playlist that automatically includes songs in the
playlist based on the criteria you set up and removes from the playlist songs
that don’t match the criteria. The song information you edited in Chapter 8 is
very useful for setting up the criteria — for example, you can define the crite-
ria for a smart playlist to automatically include songs from a particular artist,
or songs that have the highest rating or fit within a particular musical genre.

Creating Playlists
You need to create a playlist in order to burn a CD, but playlists can also
make it easier to play songs you like without having to browse the entire
library looking for them. You can create playlists of individual songs or entire
albums. You can also include video files, podcasts, and Web radio stations in
playlists, just like songs.
Playlists of songs
You can drag individual songs into a playlist and rearrange the songs to play
in any sequence you want.
To create a playlist, follow these steps:
1. Click the + button or choose File➪New Playlist.
The + button, in the bottom-left corner of the iTunes window under the
Source pane, creates a new playlist in the Source pane named untitled
playlist.
2. Type a descriptive name for the playlist.
The playlist appears in the Source pane. After you type a new name,
iTunes automatically sorts it into alphabetical order in the Source pane,
underneath the preset smart playlists and other sources.
3. Select the library in the Source pane, and then drag songs from the
library to the playlist.
Drag one song at a time (as shown in Figure 9-1) or drag a selection of
songs, dropping them onto the playlist name in the Source pane. The ini-
tial order of songs in the playlist is based on the order in which you drag
them to the list. Of course, you can rearrange the songs in any order
after dragging them, as we show in the next step.
4. Select the playlist in the Source pane, and then drag songs to
rearrange the list.
To move a song up the list and scroll at the same time, drag it over the
up arrow in the first column (the song number); to move a song down
the list and scroll, drag it to the bottom of the list. You can move a group
of songs at once by selecting them first (holding down Shift to select a
range of songs, or press Ô on a Mac or Ctrl on a PC to select specific
songs), and then dragging them into a new position.

Part II: Managing Your Music 

You can drag songs from one playlist to another playlist. Only links are
copied, not the actual files. Besides dragging songs, you can also rearrange a
playlist by sorting the list — click the Song Name, Time, Artist column head-
ings, and so on. And when you double-click a playlist, it opens in its own
window, displaying the song list.
To open a playlist in a new window, double-click the playlist icon in the
Source pane. You can then easily browse your iTunes library and drag songs
to the playlist window.
To create a playlist quickly, select the group of songs that you want to make
into a playlist, and then choose File➪New Playlist from Selection — or drag
the selection to the white area underneath items in the Source pane. A new
playlist appears in the Source pane, and you can then type a name for the
playlist.
Playlists of albums
It’s simple to make a playlist of an album. Select the library in the Source
pane and drag an album from the Album list in the Browse view to the white
area below the items in your Source pane. iTunes automatically creates a new
playlist named after the album.
You might want to play several albums of songs without having to select each
album as you play them. For example, you might want to use an iPod on that
long drive from London to Liverpool to play Beatles albums in the order they
were released (or perhaps the reverse order, reversing the Beatles’ career
from London back to Liverpool).
Figure 9-1:

123
Chapter 9: Organizing Music with Playlists

To create a playlist of entire albums in a particular order, follow these steps:
1. Create a new playlist.
Create a playlist by clicking the + sign under the Source pane or by choos-
ing File➪New Playlist. Type a descriptive name for the new playlist.
2. Select the library in the Source pane, and click the Browse button to
find the artist.
The Album list appears in the right panel.
3. Drag the album name over the playlist name.
4. Select and drag each subsequent album over the playlist name.
Each time you drag an album, iTunes automatically lists the songs in the
proper track sequence.
You can rename a playlist at any time by clicking inside its name and typing a
new one. Also, in case you forget which songs are in which playlists, you can
see all the playlists that include a particular song. In Browse or song List view,
on a Mac press the Control key and click the song; in Windows use the right
mouse button to right-click the song, and then drag down to Playlists in the
pop-up menu. The playlists that include the song are listed in the submenu.
Using Smart Playlists
At the top of the Source pane, indicated by a gear icon, you can find what
Apple (and everyone else) calls a smart playlist. iTunes comes with a few
sample smart playlists, such as the My Top Rated and Recently Added
playlists, and you can create your own. Smart playlists add songs to them-
selves based on prearranged criteria. For example, as you rate your songs,
My Top Rated changes to reflect your new ratings. You don’t have to set any-
thing up — My Top Rated and Recently Added are already defined for you.
Of course, smart playlists are ignorant of your taste in music — you have to
program them with criteria using the song information you edited in Chapter 8.
For example, you can create a smart playlist that uses the Year field to grab all
the songs from 1966, only to find that the list includes the Beatles (“Eleanor
Rigby”), Frank Sinatra (“Strangers in the Night”), the Yardbirds (“Over Under
Sideways Down”), and Ike and Tina Turner (“River Deep, Mountain High”) in no
particular order. Use other fields of the song information you entered, such as
ratings, artist name, or comment to fine-tune your criteria. You can also use
built-in functions such as the Play Count (the number of times the song was
played) or the Date Added (the date the song was added to the library).
124
Part II: Managing Your Music 

Creating a smart playlist
To create a new smart playlist, choose File➪New Smart Playlist. The Smart
Playlist dialog appears (as shown in Figure 9-2), offering the following choices
for setting criteria:
 Match the Following Conditions: From the first pop-up menu (refer to
Figure 9-2), you can select any of the categories used for song informa-
tion. From the second pop-up menu, you can choose an operator, such
as the greater than or less than operators. The selections that you make
in these two pop-up menus combine to express a condition such as Year
is greater than 1966. You can also add multiple conditions by click-
ing the + button, and then decide whether to match all or any of these
conditions.
 Limit To: You can limit the smart playlist to a specific duration, mea-
sured by the number of songs, time, or size in megabytes or gigabytes,
as shown in Figure 9-3. The songs can be selected by various methods
such as random, most recently played, and so on.
 Match Only Checked Songs: This option selects only those songs that
have a check mark beside them, along with the rest of the criteria.
Checking and unchecking songs is an easy way to fine-tune your selec-
tion for a smart playlist.
 Live Updating: This allows iTunes to automatically update the playlist
continually as you play songs, add or remove them from the library,
change their ratings, and so on.
Figure 9-2:
Set the first

condition for
a smart
playlist.
125
Chapter 9: Organizing Music with Playlists

After setting up the criteria, click OK. iTunes creates the playlist with a gear
icon and the name untitled playlist or whatever phrase you used for the first
condition (such as the album or artist name). You can click in the playlist
field and type a new name for it.
Editing a smart playlist
To edit a smart playlist, select the playlist and choose File➪Edit Smart
Playlist (or right-click the playlist with a two-button mouse and select Edit
Smart Playlist from the pop-up menu). The Smart Playlist window appears,
with the criteria for the smart playlist.
To modify the smart playlist so that songs with a higher rating are picked,
simply add another star or two to the My Rating criteria.
You can also choose to limit the playlist to a certain number of songs, selected
by various methods such as random, most recently played, and so on.
Figure 9-3:

126
Part II: Managing Your Music 
A smart playlist for recent additions
Setting up multiple criteria gives you the oppor-
tunity to create playlists that are way smarter
than the ones supplied with iTunes. For exam-
ple, we created a smart playlist with criteria
shown in Figure 9-3 that does the following:
 Adds any song added to the library in the
past week that also has a rating greater
than three stars.
 Limits the playlist to 72 minutes of music (to
fit on one audio CD), and refines the selec-
tion to the most recently added if the entire
selection becomes greater than 72 minutes.
 Matches only checked songs.
 Performs live updating.

Deleting Songs, Albums, 
Artists, and Playlists
Deleting songs can seem counterproductive when you’re trying to build up
your iTunes library, but there are times when you have to do it, such as the
following:
 Deleting versions of songs: You might have ripped a CD twice — once
in AIFF format to burn the songs onto another CD, and another in AAC
format for your library and iPod. You can delete the AIFF versions in
your library after burning your CD (as we describe in Chapter 12).
 Deleting songs from playlists: You can delete songs from playlists
while keeping the songs in your Library. When you delete a song from a
playlist, the song is simply deleted from the list — not from the library.
You can delete playlists as well, without harming the songs in the
library. You have to switch to the Library in the Source pane to delete
songs from the library.
 Deleting a song, album, or artist from the library: With the Library
selected in the Source pane, you can select any song, group of songs,
album, group of albums, artist, or group of artists, and then press
Delete/Backspace or choose Edit➪Clear. After clicking Yes to the warn-
ing message, the songs are gone from iTunes. (Why did you rip them in
the first place? See Chapter 3 about how to play tracks first, before
importing them.)
To delete a song from a playlist, select the playlist in the Source pane, and
then select the song. Press Delete/Backspace (that’s Delete on a Mac or
Backspace on a Windows PC), or choose Edit➪Clear. In the warning dialog
that appears, click Yes to remove the selected item from the list.
To delete a playlist, select the playlist in the Source pane and press Delete/
Backspace, or choose Edit➪Clear.
To delete a song from the library, select Library in the Source pane, and then
select the song. Press Delete/Backspace, or choose Edit➪Clear. In the warn-
ing dialog that appears, click Yes to remove the selected item from the list.
Deleting a song from the iTunes Library removes the song from your Library
song list, but it doesn’t remove it from your hard drive until you agree. iTunes
displays another warning — Some of the selected files are located
in your iTunes Music folder. Would you like to move these
files to the Trash? — and you can click Yes to trash them, No to keep
them in your music folder, or Cancel to cancel the operation.
127
Chapter 9: Organizing Music with Playlists

You can delete multiple songs by first selecting them. Just hold down Shift as
you click to select a range of songs, or hold down Ô (Mac) or Ctrl (PC) as you
click each song to add it to the selection. Then press Delete/Backspace, or
choose Edit➪Clear.
To delete an entire album, first select the album in Browse view, press Delete/
Backspace, or choose Edit➪Clear. To delete everything by an artist, first
select the artist in Browse view, and then press Delete/Backspace or choose
Edit➪Clear. If you choose to move the album or artist folder to the Trash, the
album or artist folder is deleted from your hard drive; otherwise, it remains
in your iTunes Music folder.
If you leave music files and folders in your iTunes Music folder, you can add
them back to your iTunes library by dragging and dropping them into the
iTunes window.
Creating an iMix
Amateur disk jockeys, rejoice! The iTunes Music Store offers the iMix section
for sharing your iTunes playlists with other iTunes users. While you can submit
a playlist of any songs to be published in the iMix section of the store, only
songs available from the store are actually published — unavailable songs are
skipped. You can include in the playlist any song from any ripped CD, and if the
song is also available in the store, the song will be included in the published
iMix playlist.
Browsers in the iTunes Music Store can view the playlist by entering the iMix
section and clicking any playlist. See Chapter 4 for information about navigat-
ing the iTunes Music Store, playing short preview clips, and buying songs.
To create an iMix, follow these steps:
1. Select the playlist in your iTunes library and choose File➪Create
an iMix.
iTunes displays a warning message before accessing the iTunes Music
Store to publish your playlist.
2. Click the Create button in the warning message.
Click Create to start the process. iTunes displays the music store sign-in
dialog shown in Figure 9-4.
3. Sign in to the iTunes Music Store with your ID and password.
Provide your Apple or AOL ID and password to log into the store. iTunes
selects the Music Store in the Source pane and displays the iMix Music
128
Part II: Managing Your Music 

Store page shown in Figure 9-5. You see the iMix playlist that will be pub-
lished, which includes only songs that are available from the store.
4. Edit the title and description for the iMix playlist and click the Publish
button.
iTunes publishes the playlist in the iMix section of the store. Others can
browse the playlist and buy any songs, as we describe in Chapter 4.

In This Chapter
 Synchronizing your iPod with your iTunes music library
 Updating your iPod with selected playlists or selected songs
 Copying music directly to your iPod
 Updating an iPod shuffle with Autofill
 Managing playlists and editing song information on your iPod
i
Tunes is the software that puts music on your iPod (more than just music,
of course — you can include audio books, podcasts, or anything stored as
a song in iTunes). iTunes can fill your iPod with sounds very quickly and
keep it updated every time you connect it. (iTunes can also keep your iPod
synchronized with new or edited contacts and calendars, as we describe in
Chapter 26, and keep a color-display iPod synchronized with your photo
library, as we describe in Chapter 24.)
If you’re too busy to copy specific songs to your iPod and your entire iTunes
music library fits on your iPod anyway, why not just copy everything? Copying
your library is just as fast as copying individual songs, if not faster, and you
don’t have to do anything except connect the iPod to your computer. This
chapter shows you how to set up iTunes to automatically update your iPod.
This chapter also shows how you can update your iPod manually, choosing
which songs to copy. iTunes is flexible in that you can use either option or both
options to update your iPod. For example, you can update automatically with
all the songs in playlists, and then copy other music not in playlists directly to
your iPod, and delete songs from your iPod if you need to make room. 
This chapter explains how to set your preferences for updating and change
them when you need to. It also explains how to fill an iPod shuffle automati-
cally or manually and how to manage space on an iPod shuffle.

Changing Your Update Preferences
If you’ve changed your iPod preferences to update manually, you can change
them back to update automatically any time and vice versa. Change your
iPod preferences by following these steps:
1. Connect the iPod to your computer.
Your iPod must be connected for you to change the update preferences.
iTunes starts automatically. If this is the first time connecting your iPod,
it synchronizes automatically with the iTunes library. If you want to 
prevent this from happening, hold down the Ctrl and Alt keys on a PC
(Ô and Option keys on a Mac) as you connect the iPod, keeping them
pressed until the iPod name appears in the iTunes Source pane.
2. Select the iPod in the iTunes Source pane.
Your iPod appears in the Source pane using the name you gave it when
you installed the iPod software. See Chapter 2.
3. Click the iPod Options button on the bottom-right side of the iTunes
window, or click the iPod button in the iTunes Preferences window.
The iPod Options button appears only when an iPod is connected and
selected in the Source pane. You can also choose iTunes➪Preferences
on a Mac or Edit➪Preferences on a Windows PC, and click the iPod
button — whether or not the iPod is selected in the Source pane
(although it has to be connected). The iPod preferences dialog appears,
as shown in Figure 10-1.
4. Click the Music button in the iPod preferences dialog to select music
update preferences.
The Music button may already be selected; if not, click it to show the
music preferences.
5. Select the update preferences you want.
Set the update preferences, and click OK to the warning message that
appears. For example, if you select the Automatically Update All Songs
and Playlists option, iTunes displays a warning message asking you to
confirm the update preference you chose (see Figure 10-2). Be sure that
you want to use this option before selecting it; see “Updating Your iPod
Automatically” later in this chapter.
6. Click OK to go ahead (confirming that you want to change to auto-
matic update).
132
Part II: Managing Your Music 

7. Change other iPod music preferences as you wish.
Other preferences that you might want to change include the “Open
iTunes when this iPod is attached” option, which launches iTunes auto-
matically when turned on. If this is off, you have to start iTunes by
launching it yourself. Other options appear depending on the iPod
model — for example, the option “Display album artwork on your iPod”
appears only for iPod models with color displays.
8. Click OK to close the Preferences dialog.

Chapter 10: Updating Your iPod with iTunes

9. Click the iPod Eject button, which appears in the bottom-right side of
the iTunes window.
Another way to eject the iPod on a Mac is to drag the iPod icon on the
Desktop to the Trash — or in Mac OS X 10.3, click the eject icon next to
the iPod icon in the Finder Sidebar. In either Mac OS X or Windows, you
can right-click the iPod icon and choose Eject.
After you eject the iPod, the iPod displays an OK to disconnect mes-
sage in first- and second-generation models, or the iPod main menu in
third-generation models. You can then disconnect the iPod from its
dock, or disconnect the dock from the computer.
While the updating is in progress, don’t disconnect your iPod from the com-
puter until it tells you it is safe to do so. The iPod is a hard drive, after all,
and hard drives need to be closed down properly in order for you not to lose
any critical data. When it’s safe, the iPod displays an OK to disconnect
message in first- and second-generation models, or the iPod main menu in
third-generation and fourth-generation models.
Updating Your iPod Automatically
The default setting for a new iPod is to update itself automatically, synchroniz-
ing to your iTunes library: The iPod matches your library exactly, song for
song, playlist for playlist. If you made changes in iTunes after the last time
you synchronized, those changes are automatically made in the iPod when
you synchronize again. If you added or deleted songs in your library, those
songs are added or deleted in the iPod library. (A color-display iPod also syn-
chronizes automatically with your photo library. To read all about updating
with photos, see Chapter 24.)
If your iTunes music library is too large to fit on your iPod, you can still
update automatically and keep your iPod synchronized to a subset of your
library, adding new material under your control. For example, you can let
iTunes select the music automatically according to your ratings, as described
in the upcoming section, “Updating from a library larger than your iPod.” You
can even create a smart playlist that does it for you, as described in the later
section, “Updating by playlist.”
Before you actually connect your iPod to a computer to automatically update
the iPod, keep these things in mind:
 iTunes remembers your updating preferences for each iPod you connect
from the last time you updated the iPod. If you already set your prefer-
ences to update automatically, iTunes remembers and starts to automat-
ically update the iPod. If you already set your preferences to update
134
Part II: Managing Your Music 

manually, iTunes remembers and makes the iPod active in the iTunes
Source pane.
 To prevent an iPod from automatically updating, hold down the Ô and
Option keys on a Mac (Ctrl and Alt keys on a PC) as you connect the
iPod, and keep pressing until the iPod name appears in the iTunes
Source pane. This works even if you choose to automatically update
the iPod in the Setup Assistant.
 If you connect your iPod to another computer running iTunes, you might
be in for a surprise. When you connect an iPod previously linked to
another computer, iTunes displays the message: This iPod is linked
to another iTunes music library. Do you want to change the
link to this iTunes music library and replace all existing
songs and playlists on this iPod with those from this
library? If you don’t want to change your iPod to have this other
music library, click No. Otherwise, iTunes erases your iPod and updates
your iPod with the other computer’s iTunes library. By clicking No, you
change that computer’s iTunes preferences to manually update, thereby
avoiding automatic updating.
 Songs stored remotely (such as songs shared from other iTunes libraries
on a network) are not synchronized because they are not physically on
your computer. See Chapter 6 for more info on how to share music over
a network with iTunes.
When your iPod is set to update automatically (the entire library, or by either
playlist or selected song), the iPod song list and the iPod entry in the Source
pane are grayed out in the iTunes window. Because you manage the contents
automatically, you don’t have direct access to the songs in the iPod using
iTunes. For direct access, see “Updating Your iPod Manually,” later in this
chapter.
Synchronizing with your library
Your iPod is set up by default to automatically update itself from your iTunes
library so that it can synchronize with it. Just follow these simple steps:
1. Connect the iPod to your computer.
When you first connect the iPod to the computer, your iPod automati-
cally synchronizes with your iTunes music library — unless you turned
off the “Automatically update songs on my iPod” option in the Setup
Assistant, or unless you hold down the Ô and Option keys on a Mac
(Ctrl and Alt keys on a PC) while connecting the iPod.
135
Chapter 10: Updating Your iPod with iTunes

2. Wait for the updating to finish and then eject the iPod.
Wait until the iTunes status pane (up at the top) reads iPod update is
complete. You can then click the iPod Eject button, which appears in
the bottom-right side of the iTunes window.
You can also eject the iPod by dragging the iPod icon on the Desktop to the
Trash on the Mac; in OS X 10.3, you can click the eject icon next to the iPod
icon in the Finder Sidebar. In Windows, you can use various methods, includ-
ing right-clicking the iPod icon and choosing Eject from the contextual menu.
While the updating is in progress and right after ejecting the iPod, don’t dis-
connect your iPod from your computer until it tells you that it’s safe to do so.
As a reminder, the iPod displays the message Do not disconnect.
Updating from a library 
larger than your iPod
If your iTunes music library is too large to fit on your iPod, you can still
update automatically and keep your iPod synchronized to a subset of your
library. When you first use your iPod (which is set by default to automatic
update), iTunes displays a message if your library is too large to fit, telling
you that it has created a special playlist for your iPod. This playlist is spe-
cially designed for updating your iPod automatically. For example, if your
iPod is named GigaMojo, you find a new playlist named GigaMojo Selection
filled with all the songs that iTunes could fit in your iPod.
If, on the other hand, you have already been using your iPod and it’s set to
automatically update, iTunes displays a message that gives you a choice of
automatically creating a new playlist, or letting iTunes choose for you: 
 If you click Yes, iTunes creates a new playlist (titled GigaMojo Selection,
if your iPod is named GigaMojo like one of ours) and displays a message
telling you so. Click OK, and iTunes updates your iPod using the new
playlist.
 If you click No, iTunes updates automatically until it fills up your iPod.
iTunes decides which songs and albums to include in this playlist using
the ratings that you can set for each song in the iTunes song informa-
tion, as we describe in Chapter 8. iTunes groups album tracks together
and computes an average rating and play count for the album. It then
fills the iPod, giving higher priority to albums with play counts and rat-
ings greater than zero. You can therefore influence the decisions that
iTunes makes by adding ratings to songs or entire albums.
136
Part II: Managing Your Music 

Updating by playlist
Updating by playlist is useful when you want to copy selected sets of songs
to your iPod every time you connect it to your computer. For example, you
can define a set of playlists in your iTunes library to use just for updating an
iPod that doesn’t have enough capacity to hold your entire library. To do
this, set up the iPod to update only selected playlists automatically.
Updating automatically by playlist is also an easy way to automatically update
an iPod from an iTunes library that is larger than the iPod’s capacity.
Before using this update option, create the playlists in iTunes (see Chapter 9)
that you want to copy to the iPod. Then follow these steps:
1. Connect the iPod to your computer.
If your iPod is set to automatically update, hold down the Ô and Option
keys on a Mac (Ctrl and Alt keys on a PC) while connecting the iPod.
2. Select the iPod name in the iTunes Source pane.
3. Click the iPod Options button or click the iPod button in the iTunes
Preferences window.
The iPod Options button appears only when an iPod is connected and
selected in the Source pane. You can also choose iTunes➪Preferences
on a Mac or Edit➪Preferences on a Windows PC, and click the iPod
button. The iPod preferences dialog appears.
4. Click the Music button in the iPod preferences dialog to select music
update preferences.
5. Select the Automatically Update Selected Playlists Only option.
6. In the list box, select each playlist that you want to copy in the update.
Select the check box next to each playlist to select it for the update, as
shown in Figure 10-3.
7. Click OK to close Preferences.
iTunes automatically updates the iPod by erasing its contents and copy-
ing only the playlists that you selected in Step 6.
8. Wait for the updating to finish, and then eject the iPod.
Wait until the iTunes status pane reads iPod update is complete.
Then you can click the iPod Eject button (the one with the eject trian-
gle), which appears in the bottom-right side of the iTunes window.
137
Chapter 10: Updating Your iPod with iTunes

Updating selected songs
You might want to update the iPod automatically but only with selected
songs — especially if your iTunes library is larger than the capacity of your
iPod. To use this method, you must first deselect the songs you don’t want to
transfer, since all the songs in your iTunes library are selected by default. 
To deselect a song, click the check box next to the song so that the check mark
disappears. To select a song, mark the check box so that the mark appears.
You can quickly select or deselect an entire album by selecting an album in
Browse view and holding down the Ô key (Mac) or the Ctrl key (PC).
After you deselect the songs that you don’t want to transfer and make sure
that the songs you do want to transfer are selected, follow these steps:
1. Connect the iPod to your computer.
If your iPod is set to automatically update, hold down the Ctrl and Alt
keys on a PC (Ô and Option keys on a Mac) while connecting the iPod.
2. Select the iPod name in the iTunes Source pane.
You can select the iPod name even when it’s grayed out.

The iPod Options button appears only when an iPod is connected and
selected in the Source pane. You can also choose iTunes➪Preferences
on a Mac or Edit➪Preferences on a Windows PC, and click the iPod
button. The iPod preferences dialog appears; refer to Figure 10-1.
4. Click the Music button in the iPod preferences dialog to select music
update preferences.
5. Select the Automatically Update All Songs and Playlists option and
click OK for the Are you sure you want to enable automatic
updating message that appears.
6. Select the Only Update Checked Songs check box and then click OK to
close Preferences.
iTunes automatically updates the iPod by copying only the songs in the
iTunes library that are selected.
7. Wait for the updating to finish, and then eject the iPod.
Wait until the iTunes status pane reads iPod update is complete,
and you can then click the iPod Eject button, which appears in the
bottom-right side of the iTunes window.
Updating Your iPod Manually
With manual updating, you can add music to your iPod directly via iTunes,
and you can delete music from your iPod as well. The iPod name appears in
the iTunes Source pane, and when selected, its contents appear in the iTunes
song list replacing the library contents.
You might have one or more reasons for updating manually, but some obvi-
ous ones are the following:
 Your entire music library is too big for your iPod, and you want to copy
individual albums, songs, or playlists to the iPod directly.
 You want to share a single music library with several iPods, and you
have different playlists that you want to copy to each iPod directly.
 You share an iPod with others, and you want to copy your music to the
iPod without wiping out their music.
 You want to copy some music from another computer’s music library
without deleting any music from your iPod.
 You want to edit the playlists and song information directly on your iPod
without changing anything in your computer’s library.
139
Chapter 10: Updating Your iPod with iTunes

 You want to play the songs on your iPod using iTunes on the computer,
where you can play your iPod through the computer’s speakers and take
advantage of iTunes playback features (such as cross-fading between
two tracks — see Chapter 16).
When you set your iPod to update manually, the entire contents of the iPod
is active and available in iTunes. You can copy music directly to your iPod,
delete songs on the iPod, and edit the iPod playlists directly.
To set your iPod to update manually, follow these steps:
1. Connect the iPod to your computer, holding down the Ctrl and Alt
keys on a PC (Ô and Option keys on a Mac) to prevent automatic
updating.
Continue holding the keys down until the iPod name appears in the
iTunes Source pane.
2. Select the iPod name in the iTunes Source pane.
3. Click the iPod Options button or click the iPod button in the iTunes
Preferences window.
The iPod Options button appears only when an iPod is connected and
selected in the Source pane. You can also choose iTunes➪Preferences
on a Mac or Edit➪Preferences on a Windows PC, and click the iPod
button. The iPod preferences dialog appears (refer to Figure 10-1).
4. Click the Music button in the iPod preferences dialog to select music
update preferences.
5. Select the Manually Manage Songs and Playlists option.
iTunes displays the Disabling automatic update requires 
manually unmounting the iPod before each disconnect message.
6. Click OK to accept the new iPod preferences.
The iPod contents now appear active in iTunes and not grayed out.
Don’t disconnect your iPod while it is active in iTunes with the manual updat-
ing method. You have to eject the iPod and wait until the iPod displays the
message OK to disconnect (in first- and second-generation models) or the
iPod main menu.

Copying music directly
As soon as you set your iPod to manual updating, you can copy music directly.
To copy music to your iPod directly, follow these steps (with your iPod con-
nected to your computer):
1. Select the iTunes music library or a library playlist in the Source pane.
The library’s or playlist’s songs appear in a List view or in Browse view.
2. Drag items directly from your iTunes library or playlist over the iPod
name in the Source pane, as shown in Figure 10-4.
When you drag a playlist name, all the songs associated with the playlist
copy along with the playlist itself. When you drag an album title, all the
songs in the album are copied.
3. Wait for the copy operation to finish and then eject the iPod.
Wait until the iTunes status pane reads iPod update is complete;
you can then click the iPod Eject button, which appears in the bottom-
right side of the iTunes window.

Deleting music on your iPod
With manual updating, you can delete songs from the iPod directly. Manual
deletion is a nice feature if you just want to go in and delete a song or an
album to make room for more music.
Automatic synchronization with your iTunes library means that anything you
delete in your iTunes library is also deleted when you update your iPod.
However, if you update manually, you can delete songs from your iPod with-
out changing your iTunes library.
To delete any song in the song list with your iPod set to manual updating,
follow these steps:
1. Select the iPod in the iTunes Source pane.
The iPod’s songs appear in the List or Browse view, replacing the view of
your library songs.
2. Select a song or album on the iPod and press Delete/Backspace or
choose Edit➪Clear.
iTunes displays a warning to make sure you want to do this; click OK to
go ahead or Cancel to stop. If you want to delete a playlist, select the
playlist and press Delete or choose Edit➪Clear.
Like in the iTunes library, if you delete a playlist, the songs are not deleted —
they are still on your iPod unless you delete them from the iPod song list or
update the iPod automatically with other songs or playlists.
Managing Playlists on Your iPod
The song information and playlists for your iPod are automatically copied to
your iPod when you update the iPod. However, you might want to edit your
iPod’s music library separately, perhaps creating new playlists or changing
the song information manually, just on your iPod.
First you must connect your iPod to your computer, open iTunes, and set
your iPod to update manually, as we describe earlier in “Updating Your iPod
Manually.”
Creating playlists directly on the iPod
You can create a playlist just on the iPod itself, using songs that are on the
iPod. The songs must already be on the iPod.
142
Part II: Managing Your Music 

To create a new playlist, follow these steps:
1. Select the iPod in the iTunes Source pane.
2. Click the triangle next to the iPod name to open the iPod list of
playlists, as shown in Figure 10-5.
3. Create a new playlist by clicking the + button in the bottom-left corner
of iTunes under the Source list or choose File➪New Playlist.
Untitled playlist appears in the Source pane under the iPod entry.
4. Type a name for the untitled playlist.
After you type a new name, iTunes automatically sorts it into alphabeti-
cal order in the list under the iPod.
5. Click the name of the iPod in the Source pane and drag songs from
the iPod song list to the playlist.
You can also click the Browse button to find songs on the iPod more easily.
The order of songs in the playlist is based on the order in which you drag them
to the list. You can rearrange the list by dragging songs within the playlist.
You can create smart playlists on the iPod in exactly the same way as in the
iTunes music library. A smart playlist updates itself when you create it using
iTunes, and then updates itself every time you connect and select your iPod
with iTunes. Read all about smart playlists in Chapter 9.

Chapter 10: Updating Your iPod with iTunes

Editing playlists
To edit an existing playlist on your iPod, do the following:
1. Select the iPod in the iTunes Source pane.
The iPod songs appear in the List or Browse view, replacing the view of
your library songs.
2. Click the triangle next to the iPod name to open the iPod list of
playlists.
3. Scroll the Source pane to locate the playlist.
4. Select the playlist to rearrange songs.
You can rearrange songs by dragging them within the List view for the
playlist — just as if the playlist were in the iTunes library.
5. Click the name of the iPod in the Source pane and drag more songs
from the iPod song list to the iPod playlist.
You can also click the Browse button to find songs more easily.
The songs and albums that you drag to an iPod playlist must already
be on the iPod. If you want to copy songs from your iTunes library, see
“Updating Your iPod Manually,” earlier in this chapter.
Editing Song Information on Your iPod
With the iPod selected in iTunes and set for updating manually, you can edit
song information just like you do in the iTunes library by scrolling down the
song list and selecting songs.
After selecting the iPod in the Source pane, click the Browse button. In
Browse view, you can browse the iPod library, and find the songs by artist
and album.
You can edit information such as the Song Name, Artist, Album, Genre, and
My Ratings information for the iPod songs directly in the columns in the song
list. To edit song information, locate the song and click inside the text field of
a column to type new text.
You might find it easier to edit this information by choosing File➪Get Info and
typing the text into the Song Information dialog, as shown in Figure 10-6.
144
Part II: Managing Your Music 

iTunes grabs song information from the Internet (as we describe in Chapter 7),
but this information typically doesn’t include composer credits. If you have
the time and inclination to add composer credits, doing so is worth your while
because you can then search, sort, and create playlists based on this informa-
tion. This is particularly important for classical music lovers because iTunes
and the iPod make it easy to find songs by the performer/artist but not by
the composer — and sorting by composer is what many classical music fans
prefer.
Updating an iPod Shuffle 
The iPod shuffle is designed for quick and convenient music updating — just
plug it into your computer and click Autofill. It also offers automatic com-
pression to manage and fit more songs into your iPod shuffle space. 
While Apple proudly advertises its capability to shuffle songs randomly, the
key to its success is that you cannot only shuffle the songs already there, but
can copy random songs to it every time you connect it to your computer.
Eventually you can shuffle through everything in your library if you so wish,
by randomly filling your iPod shuffle every time. On the other hand, you can
fine-tune your random selection, and even reorder the iPod shuffle’s playlist
to play back in a specific order.
Figure 10-6:

Chapter 10: Updating Your iPod with iTunes

While you can add songs to your iPod shuffle manually by dragging a playlist
or song, you can also automatically fill it without having to set options for
automatic updating. Autofill automatically picks songs from your entire iTunes
music library, or from a playlist you select in the Source pane. You can also
manage the playlist for your iPod shuffle directly, after using Autofill, to fine-
tune your selection.
Using Autofill
To use Autofill to copy songs to your iPod shuffle, follow these steps:
1. Connect the iPod shuffle to your computer.
When you connect an iPod shuffle to your computer, it shows up in the
Source pane.
2. Select the iPod shuffle in the iTunes Source pane.
After selecting the iPod shuffle in the Source pane, the Autofill pane
appears below the Song List pane, as shown in Figure 10-7. The iPod
shuffle’s songs appear in the List or Browse view, replacing the view of
your library songs
3. Choose your source of music in the “Autofill from” pop-up menu.
Choose either a playlist or library (for the entire library). If you choose a
playlist, Autofill uses only the playlist as the source of music.
4. To pick random songs, select the “Choose songs randomly” option.
5. To pick only the best songs (if you are choosing them randomly),
select the “Choose higher rated songs more often” option.
6. To replace songs already on the iPod shuffle, select the “Replace all”
option.
If you don’t select this option, iTunes adds the songs without replacing
existing songs.
7. Click the Autofill button to start copying songs.
iTunes grabs a subset of your music, creates a playlist, and copies the
contents of the playlist to the iPod shuffle.
8. Wait for the copy operation to finish and then eject the iPod shuffle.
Wait until the iTunes Status pane reads iPod update is complete;
you can then click the iPod eject button, which appears in the bottom-
right side of the iTunes window.
146
Part II: Managing Your Music 

You can click Autofill over and over to create different random playlists.
When you get one you like, select all its contents and choose File➪New
Playlist From Selection to create a new playlist that contains the songs gener-
ated by Autofill. When you next connect your iPod shuffle, select this new
playlist from the Autofill From pop-up menu and click Autofill to load the
music from the playlist to your shuffle.
The iPod shuffle can play type 2, 3, and 4 Audible.com audio books (including
audio books sold by the iTunes Music Store). Unfortunately, iTunes won’t auto-
matically add them to the iPod shuffle — you have to add them manually.
Updating manually
The iPod shuffle is always set for manual updating. When you connect an
iPod shuffle to your computer, you can copy music directly to it, delete songs
from it, and edit its playlist.
To copy music to your iPod shuffle directly, connect your iPod shuffle to your
computer and follow these steps:
1. Select the iTunes Music Library in the Source pane.
The library’s songs appear in a List or Browse view.
Figure 10-7:
Autofill your
iPod shuffle

Chapter 10: Updating Your iPod with iTunes

2. Drag items directly from your iTunes music library over the iPod shuf-
fle name in the Source pane, as shown in Figure 10-8.
When you copy a playlist, all the songs in the playlist are copied. When
you copy an album, all the songs in the album are copied.
3. Wait for the copy operation to finish and then eject the iPod.
Wait until the iTunes status pane reads iPod update is complete;
you can then click the iPod Eject button, which appears in the bottom-
right side of the iTunes window.
To delete any song in your iPod shuffle, follow these steps:
1. Select the iPod shuffle in the iTunes Source pane.
The iPod shuffle songs appear in the List or Browse view, replacing the
view of your library songs.
2. Select a song or album on the iPod shuffle and press Delete/Backspace
or choose Edit➪Clear.
iTunes displays a warning to make sure you want to do this; click OK to
go ahead or Cancel to stop.

Part II: Managing Your Music 

Managing an iPod shuffle playlist
You may not want to make a random choice or even fine-tune a random
choice — you may want to take a more deterministic approach to updating
the song choices and sequence of your iPod shuffle. You can do this by man-
aging your iPod shuffle playlist manually, and you can manage even without
connecting the iPod shuffle.
Connect the iPod shuffle and select it in the iTunes Source pane so you can
see its playlist in the List view. The song order in the playlist is based either
on the order Autofill selected them or the order in which you dragged them.
You can rearrange the playing order by dragging songs within the iPod shuf-
fle playlist to new positions in the list. You can also copy songs to the iPod
shuffle at any position in the list and delete songs from the iPod shuffle
playlist, as described in the previous section, “Updating manually.”
The cool thing about an iPod shuffle is that you can also do these things with-
out connecting the iPod shuffle. Follow these steps:
1. Connect the iPod shuffle and select it in the Source pane.
2. Click the iPod Options button or click the iPod button in the iTunes
Preferences window.
The iPod Options button appears only when an iPod is connected and
selected in the Source pane. You can also choose iTunes➪Preferences
on a Mac or Edit➪Preferences on a Windows PC, and click the iPod
button. The iPod preferences dialog appears, as shown in Figure 10-9.
3. Click the Music button in the iPod preferences dialog to select music
update preferences.
4. Select the “Keep this iPod in the source list” option.
Click this option’s check box to turn it on. That way when you discon-
nect your iPod shuffle, it remains in the Source pane and you can con-
tinue changing its playlist. Your iPod shuffle is automatically updated
the next time you connect it.
5. Optional: Select the “Only update checked songs” option.
Click this option’s check box if you want iTunes to copy only songs that
are marked in the iTunes library as selected. To use this option effec-
tively, you must first deselect songs you don’t want to copy. To deselect
a song, deselect the check box next to the song in the iTunes library. To
select a song, mark the check box so the mark appears.
6. Click OK to close the Preferences dialog.
149
Chapter 10: Updating Your iPod with iTunes

7. Eject the iPod shuffle before disconnecting it.
Click the iPod Eject button, which appears in the bottom-right side of
the iTunes window, or click the eject icon next to the iPod shuffle name
in the Source pane.
Your iPod shuffle remains in the Source pane even after you disconnect it, as
shown in Figure 10-10. Select the iPod shuffle’s name in the Source pane and
rearrange the playlist as you wish, including copying and deleting songs. When
you are finished, iTunes saves the iPod shuffle playlist so when you reconnect
your iPod shuffle, it is automatically updated to match this playlist.
Managing space on your iPod shuffle
It’s a nifty song player! No, it’s an external flash drive for data backup! Either
way, you can wear the iPod shuffle around your neck, which makes it quite
convenient for either music or data. To maximize its data potential, see
Chapter 21. To maximize its music potential, connect your iPod shuffle and
open iPod preferences — either select the iPod shuffle in the Source pane
and click the iPod Options button, or choose iTunes➪Preferences (on a Mac)
or Edit➪Preferences (in Windows), and click the iPod button.
Figure 10-9:
Set iPod

150
Part II: Managing Your Music 

The iPod preferences dialog (refer to Figure 10-9) includes a storage allocation
slider with More Songs on the left side and More Data on the right side. Drag
the slider to the left to open up more space for music. Don’t worry — adding
more space won’t affect any data files already stored on the iPod shuffle.
If the storage allocation slider is as far left as it can go, or as far left as you want
to take it (leaving space for data), you still have one more method of squeezing
music onto the iPod shuffle: the “Convert higher bitrate songs to 128 kbps AAC
for this iPod” option. This option does just what it says: converts songs with
higher bit rates in either protected or unprotected AAC files or MP3 files into
smaller AAC files using 128 kbps as the bit rate. It performs this conversion on
the fly, while copying songs to the iPod shuffle, without changing the songs in
your library. Protected AAC songs retain their protection.
You can save considerable space by doing this. An iPod shuffle holding an
average of 180 songs encoded at 192 Kbps in MP3 can hold an average of 260
songs by setting this option. The conversion reduces an uncompressed AIFF
file to about seven percent of its original size.

Gimme Shelter for My Music
In This Chapter
 Locating the iTunes library
 Exporting playlists from iTunes
 Consolidating and backing up your iTunes library
You might think that your music is safe, stored as it is on both your iPod
and your hard drive. However, demons in the night are working overtime
to render your hard drive useless, while at the same time someone left your
iPod out in the rain. (No, not really, but it could happen.)
Copyright law and common sense prohibit you from copying copyrighted
music and selling it to someone else. However, you are allowed to make
copies of music, audio books, and podcasts for your personal use, including
copies for your iPod and copies for backup.
In this chapter, you find out how to make a backup of your entire library — 
a very important operation, especially if you purchase songs that don’t exist
anywhere else. That way, even if your hard drive fails, you still have your
iTunes library.
You can’t copy music from your iPod to your computer — that is, using
iTunes. It’s a one-way trip from iTunes to your iPod. The reason you can’t
copy music from your iPod using iTunes is that record companies didn’t want
to allow indiscriminate copying, and Apple complied with their request. You
can, however, use third-party utility programs (not supported by Apple) to
copy music both ways. (More on this topic in Chapter 26.) According to
record labels, most music is copyrighted and shouldn’t be copied in this
manner anyway. Instead, keep a backup of your iTunes library on your com-
puter and on another hard drive or backup medium — don’t rely on your
iPod as your sole music storage device.

Some music that you can use in iTunes and with your iPod is protected. The
iTunes Music Store uses Apple’s FairPlay technology that protects the rights
of copyright holders while also giving you some leeway in how you can use
the music. You can copy the music files freely, so backup is easy and straight-
forward on either a PC or a Mac. The question of whether you can play the
music after copying it is answered by reading the section on authorizing com-
puters to play purchased music in Chapter 4. (You can play iTunes Music
Store songs on up to five computers at the same time.)
Studying Files in the iTunes Library 
If you are like that guy who, in the movie Diner, couldn’t stand to have his
records misfiled, you’ll love iTunes and its nice, neat file storage methods.
Songs can be saved with descriptive filenames within album folders, which
are, in turn, saved within artist folders. These folders are stored in the iTunes
Music folder — unless you change your storage preferences.
Finding the iTunes library
The default method of storing content in the iTunes library is to store all
audio files, including music, podcasts, and audio books, in the iTunes Music
folder. Music videos purchased from the iTunes Music Store are also stored
here. With this method, music and video files that you drag to the iTunes
window are copied into the iTunes Music folder without deleting the original
files. You need to know where this folder is to copy content folders or back
up your library.
iTunes maintains a separate iTunes folder (with a separate iTunes Music
folder) in each Home folder (Mac) or user folder (PC). If you share your com-
puter with other users who have Home folders, each user can have a sepa-
rate music library on the same computer (and, of course, a separate iPod
that synchronizes with it).
On a Mac, iTunes stores your content library inside your Home folder. The
path to this folder is your home folder/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music.
On a Windows PC, iTunes stores your content library inside your user folder.
The path to this folder is your user folder/My Documents/My Music/
iTunes/iTunes Music.
154
Part II: Managing Your Music 

Changing the location of the library
You can store your iTunes library in a different location on your hard drive, as
long as you tell iTunes where to find it. To change where iTunes stores your
music library, choose Preferences (from the iTunes menu on a Mac or from
the Edit menu on PCs), click Advanced, and then click the Change button
shown in Figure 11-1. You can then browse to select another location — on a
hard drive or any computer on a network.
After selecting a new location, the songs you bring into iTunes (by ripping
CDs, downloading music from the iTunes store, or dragging music files) are
stored in the new location — but songs previously imported stay where they
are. To move the previous songs to the new library location, drag the songs
into the iTunes window to add them to the new library, so iTunes stores them
automatically in the new location and updates its library file properly. You
can then delete the song files you copied from the old library location.
To change the storage location back to the iTunes folder inside the Music
folder, choose Preferences, click Advanced, and then click the Reset button.
Changing how files are stored 
in the library
The default method of organizing files in the iTunes library is to store content
files in album and artist folders, naming the files according to the disc number,
track number, and title. 
Figure 11-1:
Change the
location of
the iTunes
music
library.
155
Chapter 11: Gimme Shelter for My Music

For example, the song “Here, There and Everywhere” has the track name and
song title in the filename (05 Here, There And Everywhere.mp3). The file-
name extension even tells you the type of encoding format — in this case, MP3.
Note: Songs encoded in AAC have the extension .m4a or .m4p (for protected
songs purchased from the iTunes Music Store). This song is saved in the
Revolver folder (for the album), which is in the Beatles folder (for the artist).
What about songs performed by multiple artists, such as duets, or sound-
track albums with multiple artists? Albums and songs designated as part of a
compilation are stored in album folders within the Compilations folder rather
than within individual artist folders. You can designate a song as part of a
compilation by selecting the song and opening the Song Information dialog
(File➪Get Info), clicking the Info tab, and then selecting the Part of a
Compilation option. You can designate an entire album as a compilation
album (so that the album folder is stored in the Compilations folder) by
selecting the album, opening the Multiple Song Information dialog (File➪Get
Info), clicking Yes to edit multiple songs at once, and then selecting the Part
of a Compilation option by choosing Yes (in the pop-up menu on a Mac or the
drop-down menu in Windows). Even if the choice is already made, choose Yes
again to set the check mark for updating.
When you change the song information for a song (or music video, audio
book, or podcast), the filename and location within artist and album folders
changes if you revise those information fields. For example, if you change the
song title, the filename also changes. If you change the artist name, the folder
name for the artist may change — or the file may move to a new folder by
that name. iTunes organizes the files based on the song information.
To make changes to song information without changing the files on your hard
drive, choose Preferences (from the iTunes menu on a Mac or from the Edit
menu on PCs) and click Advanced; in the Advanced pane, deselect the check
mark next to Keep iTunes Music Folder Organized.
Keep your iTunes music folder organized — leave the option turned on — if
you plan on copying the music files to an iPod that will then be used with a
car installation. (We describe car installations in Chapter 15.) Most iPod
interfaces for car stereos provide a way to navigate the iPod with the car
stereo’s controls, but won’t display the proper artist, album, and song titles
unless the music folder is organized by the default method.
Maybe you don’t want to store copies of songs in the library — especially if
you already have copies stored on your hard drive in another location and
need to conserve space. If you want to add music to your iTunes library with-
out copying the files into the iTunes Music folder, choose Preferences, click
the Advanced button, and turn off the “Copy files to iTunes Music folder when
adding to library” option. The next time you drag a song file into the iTunes
window, it stores only a reference in your iTunes Music folder to the file,
specifying its actual location. The file itself is not copied or moved. 
156
Part II: Managing Your Music 

Locating a song file
No matter where you store your iTunes library or your song files, you can
find the location of any song by selecting the song and choosing File➪Get
Info and then clicking the Summary tab in the Song Information dialog. Look
in the Kind section of the Summary. The Where section tells you where the
song is, as shown in Figure 11-2.
If you access shared libraries on a network, you probably have music in your
library that’s not actually in your library at all, but rather part of a shared
library or playlist on a network, as we describe in Chapter 6. When you look
at the Summary tab of the Song Information dialog for a song in a shared
library, the Where section doesn’t appear.
Consolidating the iTunes Library
If you have song files stored on different hard drives connected to the same
computer, you can have iTunes consolidate your music library by copying
everything into the iTunes Music folder. By consolidating your library first,
you make sure that your backup is complete.
To consolidate your music library, choose Advanced➪Consolidate Library.
The original songs remain where they are, but copies are made in your Music
folder.
Figure 11-2:
Locate a
song’s file
from the
Song
Information
dialog.
157
Chapter 11: Gimme Shelter for My Music

The Consolidate Library command copies any file ending in .aac, .m4a,
.m4p, or .mp3 into the Music directory and adds it to the iTunes library —
including any .mp3 sound files used in games, such as Quake. You might want
to move files associated with games to another hard drive or backup disc
before consolidating.
Exporting iTunes Playlists
With iTunes, you can export a playlist and import it into a different computer
to have the same playlist in both places.
You must also copy the songs (or better yet, copy the entire artist folder con-
taining the songs, to keep the songs organized) in order for the playlists on
the other computer to work. Exporting a playlist does not copy the songs in
the playlist. You get a list of songs in the XML (eXtensible Markup Language)
format but not the songs themselves — you still need to copy the actual song
files to the other computer.
To export a single playlist, select the playlist and choose File➪Export Song
List. On a Mac, choose the XML option from the Format pop-up menu in the
Save: iTunes dialog, and click the Save button. On a Windows PC, choose the
XML option from the Files drop-down menu in the Save window.
After exporting a playlist and copying it to another computer, you can import
the playlist into iTunes on the other computer by choosing File➪Import on
that computer, selecting the XML file, and clicking the Choose button. You
can also export all the playlists in your library at the same time by choosing
File➪Export Library; then import them into iTunes on the other computer by
choosing File➪Import and selecting the exported XML file.
You can also import playlist files exported from other applications as .m3u
files. The .m3u format is supported by applications such as WinAmp for man-
aging playlists.
Backing Up the iTunes Library 
If you’re like us, your iTunes library is huge. We’ve nearly filled the internal
hard drives of two modern computers, each sporting 80GB of space. And you
thought 80GB would be enough? What about the backup?
Yes, don’t think twice: Backing up can be inconvenient, and it can eat up the
capacity of all your external hard drives — but it must be done. Fortunately,
it’s easy to do. With iTunes, you can copy your library to another hard drive
158
Part II: Managing Your Music 

on your computer or to another computer. You can even copy a library from
a Mac to a PC and vice versa.
Backing up on the same type of computer
To copy your entire music library to another hard drive, locate the iTunes
folder on your computer. Drag this entire folder to another hard drive or
backup device, and you’re all set. This action copies everything, including
the playlists in your library.
The copy operation can take some time if the library is huge. Although you
can stop the operation anytime, the newly copied library might not be com-
plete. Allowing the copy operation to finish is always best.
If you restore the backup copy to the same computer with the same names
for its hard drive, the backup copy’s playlists should work fine. Playlists are
essentially XML lists of songs with pathnames to the song files — if the hard
drive name is different, the pathnames won’t work. However, you can import
the playlists into iTunes by choosing File➪Import, which realigns the playlist
pathnames to the new hard drive. Alternatively, you can use the method
described in “Backing up from Mac to PC or PC to Mac.”
If you copy just the iTunes Music folder and not the entire iTunes folder, you
are copying the music itself but not your playlists. You still have to export
your playlists — see “Exporting iTunes Playlists,” earlier in this chapter.
If you use a Mac and subscribe to the Apple .Mac service, you can download
and use the free Backup software, which allows you to save the latest ver-
sions of your files regularly and automatically so you never have to worry
about losing important files. With Backup, you can quickly and easily store
files on your iDisk (a portion of an Internet hard disk hosted by .Mac), or on
CD or DVD as data files (not as CD songs — see Chapter 12 to read how to
burn an audio or MP3 CD). The iDisk is perhaps the least convenient, even
though you do get free space with a .Mac membership. It offers up to 250MB
(barely enough for a few albums), and copying to the iDisk is slow with a
modem connection. We use iDisk to transfer individual songs and other large
files to other people and to back up very important documents, but you’re
better off using a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM (or a DVD-RW) as a backup medium
for data, as well as an audio CD for your songs and albums.
Backing up from Mac to PC or PC to Mac
Maybe you use a Mac but you want to transfer your iTunes library to a PC
running iTunes, or the other way around. Or perhaps you want a foolproof
159
Chapter 11: Gimme Shelter for My Music

method of copying your entire music library to another computer, whether
it’s a Mac or a PC running Windows, or just a computer that uses a different
name for its hard drive (or a different path to the Home folder or user folder).
To back up your iTunes music library no matter what the situation, follow
these steps:
1. Locate your iTunes Music folder on your “old” computer.
Locate your iTunes Music folder as described in “Finding the iTunes
Library,” earlier in this chapter. Consider the first computer the “old”
computer and the one to receive the copied library the “new” computer.
2. Download and install iTunes on the new computer.
See Chapter 2 for instructions on installing iTunes. If the new computer
already has an iTunes Music folder with music that you want to pre-
serve, move that iTunes Music folder to another folder on the hard
drive, or copy it to another hard drive or storage medium.
3. Copy the iTunes Music folder from the old computer to the newly
installed iTunes folder of the new computer.
If you have multiple users on the new computer, make sure that you
choose the appropriate user folder for a Windows PC or Home folder
for a Mac. The copy operation for a large music library takes a while.
4. Choose File➪Export Library on the old computer, browse to a location
on your hard drive or network, and click the Save button.
When you export your entire library, iTunes creates an XML file called
iTunes Music Library.xml that links to music files and stores all
your playlists.
5. Start iTunes on the new computer.
6. Choose File➪Import on the new computer and import the iTunes
Music Library.xml file.
The music library is now available on the new computer.
The iTunes Music Library file (iTunes Music Library.xml) must be
located within the iTunes folder where iTunes can find it.

Rather, burning a CD refers to the process in which the CD drive recorder’s
laser heats up points on an interior layer of the disc, simulating the pits
pressed into commercial CDs that represent digital information.
People burn CDs for a lot of reasons — reason numero uno is to make a backup
of songs on your computer. Perhaps having your 12 favorite love songs on one
CD for your next romantic encounter is convenient, or perhaps you want to
burn a few CDs of obscure songs to impress your friends on your next big road
trip. With iTunes you can even print CD jewel-case inserts with the list of songs
and liner notes.
This chapter burns, er, boils everything down for you by telling you what kind
of discs to use, which devices you can use to play the discs, how to get your
playlist ready for burning, and what settings to use for burning. You find out
what you need to know to make sure that your burns are not meltdowns —
that the only melting is the music in your ears.

Selecting Recordable CDs
After importing music into your iTunes library, you can arrange any songs in
your library into a playlist and burn a CD using that playlist (see Chapter 9
for more on creating playlists). If you have a CD-R, CD-RW, or DVD-R drive
(such as the Apple SuperDrive for Macs), and a blank CD-R (R stands for
recordable), you can create your own music CDs that play in most CD players.
Blank CD-Rs are available in most electronics and computer stores, and even
supermarkets. You can also get them online from the Apple Store (not the
music store — the store that sells computers and accessories). Choose
iTunes➪Shop for iTunes Products on a Mac or the Help➪Shop for iTunes
Products on a Windows PC to reach the Apple Store online.
The discs are called CD-R because they use a recordable format related to
commercial audio CDs (which are not recordable, of course). You can also
create a disc in the new MP3 format by creating a CD-R with data rather than
music, which is useful for backing up a music library.
CD-Rs play just like regular audio CDs in most CD players, including car play-
ers and portable CD players. The CD-R format is the most universal and com-
patible with older players.
Many CD burners, such as the Apple SuperDrive, also burn CD-RWs (record-
able, read-write discs) that you can erase and reuse, but CD players don’t
always recognize them as music CDs. Some burners can create data DVD-Rs
and DVD-RWs also, which are useful for holding data files, but you can only
use these discs with computers that have DVD drives. Most commercial DVD
players won’t read a data DVD-R or DVD-RW.
You can play MP3 files burned on a CD-R in the MP3 format on the new con-
sumer MP3 disc players and combination CD/MP3 players as well as on many
DVD players, and of course on computers that recognize MP3 CDs (including
computers with iTunes).
What You Can Fit on a CD-R
You can fit up to 74 minutes of music on a high-quality CD-R; some can go as
high as 80 minutes. The sound files on your hard drive might take up more
space than 650 MB if they are uncompressed, but you can still fit 74 minutes
(or 80 minutes, depending on the disc) because the CD format stores infor-
mation without error-correction data.
162
Part II: Managing Your Music 

If you burn music to a CD-R in the MP3 format, the disc can hold more than
12 hours worth of music. You read that right — 12 hours on one disc. Now
you know why MP3 discs are popular. MP3 discs are essentially CD-Rs with
MP3 files stored on them.
If you have a DVD burner, such as the Apple SuperDrive, you can burn data
DVD-Rs or DVD-RWs to use with other computers. This approach is suitable
for making backup copies of music files (or any data files). A DVD-R can hold
about 4,700,000,000 bytes (about 4.38GB), which is enough to hold part of a
music library.
To burn a CD-RW or DVD-RW that already has data on it, you must first erase
it by reformatting it using the application supplied with the drive. CD-RWs
and DVD-RWs work with computers but won’t work with consumer players.
Creating a Burn Playlist
To burn a CD (actually a CD-R, but most people refer to the recordable CD-R
discs as CDs), you must first define a playlist for the CD. See Chapter 9 to find
out how to create a playlist. You can use songs encoded in any format that
iTunes supports; however, you get higher quality music with the uncom-
pressed AIFF and WAV formats, or with the Apple Lossless format.
163
Chapter 12: Feeling the iTunes Burn
The little Red Book that launched an industry
The typical audio CD and CD-R uses the CD-DA
(Compact Disc-Digital Audio) format, which is
known as Red Book — not something from
Chairman Mao, but a document, published in
1980, that provides the specifications for the
standard compact disc (CD) developed by Sony
and Philips. According to legend, this document
was in a binder with red covers.
Also according to legend, in 1979, Norio Ohga,
honorary chairman and former CEO of Sony
(who’s also a maestro conductor), overruled his
engineers and insisted that the CD format be
able to hold Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony
(which is 74 minutes and 42 seconds — now the
standard length of a Red Book audio CD).
CD-DA defines audio data digitized at 44,100
samples per second (44.1 kHz) and in a range of
65,536 possible values (16 bits). 
To import music into the computer from an audio
CD, you have to convert the music to digital
sound files by a program such as iTunes. When
you burn an audio CD, iTunes converts the
sound files back into the CD-DA format as it
burns the disc.

To copy an album you already have in your iTunes library onto an audio CD,
you can quickly create a playlist for the album by switching to Browse view
in your iTunes library and dragging an album from the Album list (in the top-
right section of the window in Browse view) to the white area below the
items in your Source pane. iTunes automatically creates a playlist with the
album name. You can then use that playlist to burn a CD.
If your playlist includes music purchased from the iTunes Music Store or
other online stores in the protected AAC encoding format, some rules might
apply. For example, the iTunes Music Store allows you to burn seven copies
of the same playlist containing protected songs to an audio CD, but no more.
You can get around this limitation by creating or using a different playlist and
copying the protected songs to the other playlist, and then burning more CDs
with the other playlist.
Calculating how much music to use
When you create a playlist, you find out how many songs can fit on the CD by
totaling the durations of the songs, using time as your measure. You can see
the size of a playlist by selecting it; the bottom of the iTunes window shows the
number of songs, the amount in time, and the amount in megabytes for the
currently selected playlist, as shown in Figure 12-1.
In Figure 12-1, the selected playlist takes 1.1 hours (about 66 minutes) to play,
so it fits on a standard audio CD. (The 13 songs take up only 65.3MB of hard
drive space; they were purchased from the iTunes Music Store and encoded
in the compressed and protected AAC format.)
Figure 12-1:
Check the
duration of
the playlist
below the
song list.
164
Part II: Managing Your Music 

A one-hour playlist of AIFF-encoded music, which might occupy over 600MB
of hard drive space, would also fit on a standard audio CD. The amount you
can fit on a standard audio CD depends on the duration, not the hard drive
space occupied by the music files. Although a CD holds between 650MB and
700MB (depending on the disc), the music is stored in a special format known
as CD-DA (or Red Book) that fills byte sectors without error-correction and
checksum information. Thus, you can fit about 90MB more — 740MB — of
AIFF-encoded music on a 650MB disc. We typically put 1.1 hours (66 minutes)
of music on a 74-minute or 80-minute CD-R with many minutes to spare.
Always use the actual duration in hours, minutes, and seconds to calculate
how much music you can fit on an audio CD — either 74 or 80 minutes for
blank CD-Rs. Leave at least one extra minute to account for the gaps between
songs.
You do the opposite for an MP3 CD — you use the actual megabytes to calcu-
late how many songs can fit on a disc — up to 700MB for a blank CD-R. You
can fit lots more music on an MP3 CD-R because you use MP3-encoded songs
rather than uncompressed AIFF songs.
If you have too many songs in the playlist to fit on a CD, iTunes will burn as
many songs in the playlist as will fit on the CD (either audio or MP3), and
then it will ask you to insert another CD to continue burning the remaining
songs in the playlist.
If you include in a burn playlist a very long song — longer than a CD — that
you purchased from the iTunes Music Store, you see a dialog telling you to
put the long song in its own playlist, and then burn that single-song playlist
separately.
Importing music for an audio CD-R 
Before you rip an audio CD of songs you want to burn to an audio CD-R, you
might want to change the import settings. Check out Chapter 17 if you need
to do so. Use AIFF, Apple Lossless, or WAV for songs from audio CDs if you
want to burn your own audio CDs with music at its highest quality.
AIFF is the standard digital format for uncompressed sound on a Mac, and
you can’t go wrong with it. WAV is basically the same thing for Windows. The
Apple Lossless encoder provides CD-quality sound in a file size that’s about
55 to 60 percent of the size of an AIFF or WAV encoded file. Both the AIFF
Encoder and the WAV Encoder offer the same Custom settings dialog, with
settings for sample rate, sample size, and channels. You can choose the auto-
matic settings, and iTunes automatically detects the proper sample rate, size,
and channels from the source. Apple Lossless is always set to automatic.
165
Chapter 12: Feeling the iTunes Burn

Songs that you purchase from the iTunes Music Store come in the protected
AAC format, which you can’t convert to anything else, but you can still burn
them onto CDs and the quality is acceptable. Audio books also come in a pro-
tected format that can’t be converted, but you can burn them onto CDs with
acceptable quality.
The AAC music file format is a higher-quality format than MP3 and acceptable
to most CD listeners. We think it offers a decent trade-off of space and quality
and is suitable (although not as good as AIFF or Apple Lossless) for burning
to an audio CD.
Switching import encoders for MP3 CD-R 
MP3 discs are essentially CD-Rs with MP3 files stored on them using the ISO
9660 file structure that is standard across computers and players. Consumer
MP3 CD players are readily available in consumer electronics stores, includ-
ing hybrid models that play both audio CDs and MP3 CDs.
You can fit an average of 12 hours of music on a CD using the MP3 format,
although this amount can vary widely (along with audio quality) depending
on the encoding options and settings you choose. For example, you might
be able to fit up to 20 hours of mono (monaural) recordings because they
use only one channel and carry less information. On the other hand, if you
encode stereo recordings at high bit rates (above 192 bits per second), you
will fit less than 12 hours. If you rip an audio CD, you can set the importing
options to precisely the type of MP3 file you want; see Chapter 17.
You can use only MP3-encoded songs to burn an MP3 CD-R. Any songs not
encoded in MP3 are skipped and not burned to the CD-R. Audible books and
spoken-word titles are provided in an audio format that uses security tech-
nologies, including encryption, to protect purchased content. You can’t burn
an MP3 CD-R with Audible files; any Audible files in a burn playlist are skipped
when you burn an MP3 CD-R.
Setting the Burning Preferences
Burning a CD is a simple process, and getting it right the first time is a good
idea because when you burn a CD-R, it’s done one time — right or wrong.
You can’t erase content on a CD-R like you can with a CD-RW. Because you
can’t play a CD-RW in as many CD players, if you want to burn an audio CD,
166
Part II: Managing Your Music 

we recommend using a CD-R. Fortunately, CD-Rs are inexpensive, so you
won’t be out more than a few cents if you burn a bad one — besides, they’re
good as coasters for coffee tables.
Setting the sound check and gaps
Musicians do a sound check before every performance to check the volume of
microphones and instruments and their effect on the listening environment.
The aptly named Sound Check option in iTunes allows you to do a sound check
on your tunes to bring them all in line, volume-wise.
To have all the songs in your library play at the same volume level all the time,
choose iTunes➪Preferences on a Mac or Edit➪Preferences on a Windows PC.
In the Preferences dialog, click the Audio tab. Select the Sound Check check
box, as shown in Figure 12-2, which sets all the songs to the current volume
controlled by the iTunes volume slider.
After enabling Sound Check, you can burn your audio CD-R so that all the
songs play back at the same volume, just like they do in iTunes. Choose
iTunes➪Preferences on a Mac/Edit➪Preferences on a Windows PC, and then
click the Burning button. Select the Use Sound Check option, as shown in
Figure 12-3. Note: This option works whether or not you’re already using the
Sound Check option in the Audio preferences. You can select this option for
burning without ever changing the preferences for your entire library.

Chapter 12: Feeling the iTunes Burn

Consistent volume for all tracks makes the CD-R sound professional. Another
professional touch is to add an appropriate gap between songs, just like com-
mercial CDs. Follow these steps to control the length of the gap between the
songs on your audio CD-R (not MP3 CD-R):
1. Choose iTunes➪Preferences on a Mac/Edit➪Preferences on a
Windows PC, and then click the Burning tab in the Preferences
dialog.
The Burning Preferences appear; refer to Figure 12-3.
2. Choose an amount from the Gap between Songs pop-up menu.
You can choose from a gap of 0 to 5 seconds. We recommend selecting a
gap of 2 seconds, which is the default setting.
3. Click OK.
Setting the format and recording speed 
Before burning a CD-R, you have to set the disc format and the recording
speed. Choose Preferences (from the iTunes menu on a Mac/Edit menu on a
Windows PC), and then click the Burning tab in the Preferences dialog.
The Disc Format setting in the Burning dialog (refer to Figure 12-3) offers
three choices:
 Audio CD: Choose this to burn a normal audio CD of up to 74 or 80 min-
utes (depending on the type of blank CD-R) using any iTunes-supported
music files, including songs bought from the iTunes Music Store. Although
connoisseurs of music might use AIFF-encoded or WAV-encoded music to
burn an audio CD, you can also use songs in the AAC and MP3 formats.
Figure 12-3:
Select the

168
Part II: Managing Your Music 

 MP3 CD: Choose this to burn an MP3 CD with songs encoded in the MP3
format. No other formats are supported for MP3 CD.
 Data CD or DVD: Choose this to burn a data CD-R, CD-RW, DVD-R, or DVD-
RW with the music files. You can use any encoding formats for the songs.
Important: Data discs won’t play on most consumer CD players — they
are meant for use with computers. However, data discs are good choices
for storing backup copies of music bought from the iTunes Music Store.
Blank CD-Rs are rated for recording at certain speeds. iTunes typically detects
the rating of a blank CD-R and adjusts the recording speed to fit. However, if
your blank CD-Rs are rated for a slower speed than your burner, or you have
problems creating CD-Rs, you can change the recording speed setting to match
the CD’s rating. Choose iTunes➪Preferences on a Mac/Edit➪Preferences on a
Windows PC, and then click the Burning tab in the Preferences dialog. From the
Preferred Speed pop-up menu or drop-down list in the Burning Preferences,
choose a specific recording speed or choose the Maximum Possible option to
set the recording speed to your burner’s maximum speed.
Burning a Disc
After you set the burning preferences, you’re ready to start burning. Follow
these steps to burn a CD:
1. Select the playlist designated for burning a disc and click the Burn
Disc button.
A message appears telling you to insert a blank disc.
2. Insert a blank disc (label side up).
iTunes immediately checks the media and displays a message in the
status window that the disc is ready to burn.
3. Click the Burn Disc button again.
This time, the button has a radiation symbol. The burn process begins.
The “radioactive” button rotates while the burning takes place, and a
progress bar appears with the names of the songs displayed as they
burn to the disc.
When iTunes has finished burning the CD, iTunes chimes, and the CD is
mounted on the Desktop.
4. Eject the newly burned disc from your CD drive and test it.
Burning takes several minutes. You can cancel the operation at any time by
clicking the X next to the progress bar, but canceling the operation isn’t like
undoing the burn. If the burn has already started, you can’t use the CD-R or
DVD-R again.
169
Chapter 12: Feeling the iTunes Burn

If the playlist has more music than can fit on the disc using the chosen format,
iTunes burns as much as possible from the beginning of the playlist, and then
asks you to insert another disc to burn the rest. To calculate the amount of
music in a playlist, turn to the section, “Calculating how much music to use,”
earlier in this chapter.
Spoken word fans: Audible audio books with chapter markers are burned
onto CD with each chapter as a separate track.
If you choose the MP3 CD format, iTunes skips over any songs in the playlist
that are not in the MP3 format.
Printing Song and Album Information
Putting music on a blank CD-R doesn’t change the disc’s look in any way, so if
you misplace it, how do you know it isn’t just another blank? Put it inside a
case and include something in print that identifies it.
Don’t delete your burn playlist yet. You can print the CD jewel case insert,
song list, and album notes for the CD you just burned from the playlist. You
can even print the cover art that the iTunes Music Store provides with pur-
chased songs (even artwork you added yourself, as described in Chapter 8).
If you have a color printer, you can print gorgeous color inserts for your CDs.
If you don’t have a suitable printer, you can save the printed version as a
Portable Document Format (PDF) file that can be printed at a Kinko’s or simi-
lar copy shop.
Select the playlist and choose File➪Print to see a dialog like that shown in
Figure 12-4. You can see all the choices you have for CD jewel case inserts,
song listings, and album notes, and a preview of how they look when printed.

Part II: Managing Your Music 

Printing CD jewel case inserts
Everyone calls the standard CD case a jewel case even though the only pre-
cious element in the package is the music. Jewel cases have slots for insert-
ing a printed insert or booklet. You can print your own jewel case insert
directly from iTunes using the burn playlist.
To print a CD jewel case, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Print. 
2. In the dialog, select the “CD jewel case insert” option.
Figure 12-4 shows this dialog. After selecting that option, you have a
choice of themes in the pop-up menu, such as Text Only (without song
artwork), Mosaic (with artwork from songs arranged in a mosaic), Single
Cover (with one song’s artwork), and so on, as shown in Figure 12-5. 
3. Choose a theme. 
Choose a theme such as Mosaic (Black & White) if you have songs with
different cover art and you want to represent all the covers on a single
page.
iTunes offers a Page Setup button that takes you to the standard Page Setup
dialog for Mac or Windows, where you can set page layout options such as
landscape or portrait orientation. The CD jewel case themes automatically
set the proper orientation, but you can change it by clicking the Page Setup
button.
To print, click the Print button to activate the standard Print dialog box on
the Mac or in Windows. Depending on your system, you may have multiple
choices for printers, including choices for making electronic PDF files of
printed output, such as PDFWriter on Windows. (The Mac offers a built-in
PDF pop-up menu in the Print dialog.)

Chapter 12: Feeling the iTunes Burn

Printing song lists and album notes
Cover art for the jewel case is a nice decoration, but if you choose an art-
based theme rather than one that lists the songs, you may still want another
sheet with a song list to tell which track is which. You may also want a more
detailed song list that includes information for each song, such as the com-
poser, the duration, the original album, and perhaps even the rating you
assigned it in iTunes.
To print a song listing, choose File➪Print. In the dialog, select the “Song list-
ing” option shown in Figure 12-6. After choosing this option, the Theme pop-
up menu changes to provide options for columns in the song list. 
You can choose one of the following themes for the song listing:
 Songs: This theme prints a column each for the song name, duration,
artist, and album title.
 User ratings: A bit wider, this theme prints the same columns as Songs
and adds a ratings column with the ratings you’ve assigned in iTunes (as
described in Chapter 8). This theme prints in a landscape orientation.
 Dates played: This theme prints the same columns as Songs and adds
columns for the play count and the date last played, set by iTunes as
you play songs. This theme prints in a landscape orientation.
 Custom: This theme prints the columns as they’re currently set in the
iTunes song list view — so you can print any piece of information about
the songs that iTunes stores, such as Composer, Genre, and Year. See
Chapter 7 to add or change the viewing options for columns in the song
list view. 
To print a catalog-style album listing, choose File➪Print. In the dialog, select
the “Album listing” option shown in Figure 12-7. This option prints the album
title, artist, album’s song names, and song lengths.
Figure 12-6:

Part II: Managing Your Music 

You can use the Song listing or Album listing options to print a listing of all
the songs in your iTunes library, rather than just a playlist. Select Library in
the Source pane first, and then choose File➪Print and choose your printing
options. If you want to save paper and create an electronic version, use the
Macintosh or Windows Print dialog to create a PDF file.
If you want to print liner notes in a layout that iTunes doesn’t offer in its
printing themes, you can export the song information for all the songs in a
playlist to a text file, and then edit that information in a word processor or
page layout program to make liner notes for the CD. iTunes exports all the
song information for a single song, a playlist, an album, songs by an artist, 
or songs in the library into a text file. Select the songs or playlist and choose
File➪Export Song List. In the Export Song List dialog, make sure the Plain
Text option is selected from the Format pop-up menu (unless you use a
double-byte language, such as Japanese or Chinese, for which the Unicode
option is the right choice).
Troubleshooting Burns
Murphy’s Law applies to everything, even something as simple as burning
a CD-R. Don’t think for a moment that you are immune to the whims and
treacheries of Murphy (no one really knows who Murphy is), who in all his
infinite wisdom, pronounced that anything that can go wrong will go wrong.
In this section, we cover some of the most common problems that you might
encounter when burning CDs.
The best way to test your newly burned disc is to pop it right back into your
computer’s CD-ROM drive, or try it on a consumer CD player. On most CD
players, an audio CD-R plays just like any commercial audio CD. MP3 CDs
play fine on consumer MP3 CD players and also work in computers with
CD-ROM and DVD drives.

Chapter 12: Feeling the iTunes Burn

If the CD works on the computer but not on a commercial CD player, you
might have a compatibility problem with the commercial player and CD-R.
We have a five-year-old CD player that doesn’t play CD-Rs very well, and car
players sometimes have trouble with them.
The following list gives some typical problems that you might run into when
burning a CD, along with the solutions to those problems:
 Problem: The disc won’t burn.
Solution: Perhaps you have a bum disc. Hey, it happens. Try using
another disc or burning at a slower speed.
 Problem: In a consumer CD player, the disc doesn’t play, or it stutters
when playing.
Solution: This happens often with older consumer players that don’t
play CD-Rs well. Try the disc in your computer’s CD-ROM drive. If it
works there and you set the format to Audio CD, you probably have a
compatibility problem with your consumer player.
 Problem: The disc doesn’t show tracks on a consumer CD player, or it
ejects immediately.
Solution: Be sure to use the proper disc format — choose iTunes➪
Preferences on a Mac/Edit➪Preferences on a Windows PC, and click the
Burning tab to see the Disc Format setting in the Burning dialog. The
Audio CD format works in just about all consumer CD players that can
play CD-Rs. MP3 CDs work in consumer MP3 CD players and computer
CD-ROM and DVD drives. Data CDs or DVDs work only in computer
drives.
 Problem: Some songs in my playlist were skipped and not burned onto
the disc.
Solution: Audio CD-Rs burn with songs encoded in any format, but you
can use only MP3-encoded songs to burn an MP3 CD-R. Any songs not
encoded in MP3 — including songs purchased from the iTunes Music
Store in protected AAC format — are skipped when burning MP3 CDs.
(Any Audible files are also skipped, which can’t be put onto an MP3 CD.)
If your playlist for an audio CD-R includes music purchased from the
iTunes Music Store, some rules might apply — see the section, “Creating
a Burn Playlist,” earlier in this chapter.
Don’t violate copyright law.

or a music lover, nothing compares to the feeling of having so many song
choices at your fingertips. Rather than sitting back like a couch potato
and soaking up the preprogrammed sounds of radio or CDs, you control the
iPod playback and can pick any song you want to hear at any time. Shuffle
through songs randomly to get an idea of how wide your music choices are,
or just to surprise yourself or others. Or follow a thread of musical ideas,
such as the one that started with the Kingsmen’s version of “Louie Louie”
through “All Day and All of the Night” by the Kinks, “Dirty Water” by the
Standells, “Little Bit of Soul” by the Music Explosion, and the Troggs’ “Wild
Thing,” all the way to the version of “Wild Thing” by Jimi Hendrix. 
You may have spent a few minutes creating playlists in iTunes that barely
scratch the surface of the huge library you have in your hands. Now how do
you switch songs or playlists while maintaining your jogging pace or avoiding
wrecks on the freeway? 
With all the current iPod models except the iPod shuffle, you can locate and
play that music easily, browsing by artist and album, and even by composer.
Selecting a playlist is simplicity itself, and if you don’t have playlists from
iTunes (or you don’t want to hear those playlists), you can create a tempo-
rary On-The-Go playlist. This chapter shows you how to locate and play
music on any iPod. If you have an iPod shuffle, you can skip to “Playing the
iPod Shuffle” in this chapter.

Locating Songs
With so many songs on your iPod, finding a particular one can be hard —
like finding a needle in a haystack, or trying to find “Needle in a Haystack” by
the Velvelettes in the Motown catalog — even though you can narrow your
search by genre, and also search by artist, composer, album, or playlist. 
By artist
Your iPod organizes music by artist, and within each artist by album. Follow
these steps to locate a song by artist and then album:
1. Select the Music item from the iPod main menu.
Scroll the main menu until Music is highlighted, and then press the
Select button. The Music menu appears.
2. Select the Artists item.
The Artists item is second from the top of the Music menu. Scroll the
menu until Artists is highlighted, and then press the Select button. The
Artists menu appears.
To browse by genre, select the Genres item, and then select a genre from
the Genres menu to get a reduced list of artists that have songs in that
genre (in alphabetical order by artist name).
3. Select an artist from the Artists menu.
The artists’ names are listed in alphabetical order by first word. Note:
Any leading The is ignored so that The Beatles appears where Beatles
would be in the list. Scroll the Artists menu until the artist name
(such as Radiohead or Bowie, David) is highlighted, and then press the
Select button. The artist’s menu of albums appears. For example, the
Radiohead menu in our iPod includes the selections All, OK Computer,
and The Bends; the Bowie, David menu includes All, Heroes, Space
Oddity, Ziggy Stardust, and many more).
4. Select the All item or the name of an album from the artist’s menu.
The All item is at the top of the artist’s menu and should already be
highlighted; you can press the Select button to select it or scroll until
an album name is highlighted and then press the Select button. Note:
Albums are listed in alphabetical order based on the first word. A lead-
ing A or The is not ignored, so the album The Basement Tapes is listed
after the album Stage Fright. A song list appears after you select an album
choice or All.

5. Select the song from the list.
The songs in the album list are in album order (the order they appear on
the album); in the All list, songs are listed in album order for each album.
Scroll up or down the list to highlight the song.
By album
Follow these steps to locate a song by album directly:
1. Select the Music item from the iPod main menu.
Scroll the main menu until Music is highlighted, and then press the Select
button. The Music menu appears.
2. Select the Albums item.

Select the Composers item to choose a composer, and then select a com-
poser from the Composers menu to get a list of songs for that composer.
3. Select an album from the Albums menu.
The albums are listed in alphabetical order (without any reference to
artist, which might make identification difficult). The order is by first
word (a leading A, An, or The is not ignored, so the album The Natch’l
Blues is listed after Taj’s Blues in the T section rather than the N sec-
tion). Scroll the Albums menu until the album name is highlighted and
then press the Select button. A song list appears.
4. Select the song from the list.
The songs in the album list are in the order in which they appear on the
album. Scroll the list to highlight the song name and press the Select
button. The artist name and song name appear.
By playlist
When you update your iPod automatically from your entire iTunes library, all
of your playlists in iTunes are copied to the iPod. You can choose to update
your iPod with only specified playlists, as we describe in Chapter 11.
Playlists make playing a selection of songs or albums in a specific order easy.
The playlist plays from the first song selected to the end of the playlist.
179
Chapter 13: Playing Your iPod

Follow these steps to locate a song by playlist on your iPod:
1. Select the Music item from the iPod main menu.
Scroll the main menu until Music is highlighted, and then press the
Select button. The Music menu appears.
2. Select the Playlists item.
The Playlists item is at the top of the Music menu and might already be
highlighted. If not, scroll the Music menu until Playlists is highlighted,
and then press the Select button. The Playlists menu appears.
3. Select a playlist.
The playlists are listed in alphabetical order. Scroll the Playlists menu to
highlight the playlist name, and then press the Select button. A list of
songs in the playlist appears.
4. Select the song from the list.
The songs in the playlist are in playlist order (the order defined for the
playlist in iTunes). Scroll up or down the list to highlight the song you
want.
Playing a Song
After scrolling the song list until the song name is highlighted, press the
Select button to play the selected song, or press the Play/Pause button —
either button starts the song playing. When the song finishes, the iPod con-
tinues playing the next song in the song list.
While a song is playing, the artist name and song name appear, and you can
use the scroll wheel to adjust the volume. See the section, “Adjusting the
Volume,” later in this chapter.
Press the Play/Pause button when a song is playing to pause the playback.
Because the iPod is a hard drive, pause is the same as stop, and you won’t
find any delay in resuming playback.
Repeating Songs
If you want to drive yourself crazy repeating the same song over and over, the
iPod is happy to oblige. (You might want to try this with “They’re Coming to
Take Me Away, Ha Ha” by Napoleon XIV, a favorite of Dr. Demento.) More than
likely, you’ll want to repeat a sequence of songs, which you can easily do.
180
Part III: Playing Music 

You can set the iPod to repeat a single song automatically by following these
steps:
1. Locate and play a song.
2. As the song plays, press the Menu button repeatedly to return to the
main menu, and then select the Settings item.
The Settings menu appears.
3. Scroll the Settings menu until Repeat is highlighted.
The Repeat setting displays Off next to it.
4. Press the Select button once (Off changes to One) to repeat one song.
If you press the button more than once, keep pressing until One appears.
You can also press the Previous/Rewind button to repeat a song.
To repeat all the songs in the selected album or playlist, follow these steps:
1. Locate and play a song in the album or playlist.
2. As the song plays, press the Menu button repeatedly to return to the
main menu, and then select the Settings item.
The Settings menu appears.
3. Scroll the Settings menu until the Repeat item is highlighted.
The Repeat setting displays Off next to it.
4. Press the Select button twice (Off changes to All) to repeat all the
songs in the album or playlist.
Shuffling the Song Order
Maybe you want your song selections to be surprising and unpredictable,
and you want your iPod to read your mind, as the Apple ads suggest. You can
shuffle the playback of songs so that they play in random order — like an
automated radio station without a disk jockey or a program guide. With the
shuffle feature you can mix up your song collection and play it back in a jum-
bled order — and see for yourself whether your iPod knows how to pick good
tunes without your help.
To turn your iPod into a random song player so that you have no idea what
comes next, choose Shuffle Songs from the main menu. Your iPod starts with
a random song and continues to select songs randomly without ever repeat-
ing one, until it plays every song in your library. 
181
Chapter 13: Playing Your iPod

Although it may seem that your iPod plays favorites, the shuffle algorithm is
truly random, according to Apple. When an iPod does a shuffle, it reorders
the songs much the way you would shuffle a deck of cards, then plays them
back in the new order. If you keep listening for as long as it takes to complete
the list, you will hear everything, just once.
You can also shuffle songs within an album or playlist, which gives you some
control over random playback — for example, you could create a smart
playlist for all jazz songs, and then shuffle the songs within the jazz playlist. 
Follow these steps to shuffle songs in an album or playlist:
1. Locate and play a song in the album or playlist.
2. As the song plays, press the Menu button repeatedly to return to the
main menu, and then select the Settings item.
The Settings menu appears.
3. Scroll the Settings menu until the Shuffle item is highlighted.
The Shuffle setting displays Off next to it.
4. Press the Select button once (Off changes to Songs) to shuffle the
songs in the selected album or playlist.
You can set your iPod to repeat an entire album or playlist but still shuffle the
playing order, so that the order is different each time you hear it.
What if you want to play albums randomly, but don’t like when the songs in an
album aren’t played in proper album order? To shuffle all the albums in your
iPod while still playing the songs in normal album order, follow these steps:
1. Press the Menu button repeatedly to return to the main menu, and
then select the Settings item.
The Settings menu appears.
2. Scroll the Settings menu until the Shuffle item is highlighted.
The Shuffle setting displays Off next to it.
3. Press the Select button twice (Off changes to Albums) to shuffle the
albums without shuffling the songs within each album.
When the iPod is set to shuffle, it won’t repeat a song until it has played
through the entire album, playlist, or library.
182
Part III: Playing Music 

Creating On-The-Go Playlists
If you want to hear preprogrammed lists of songs but don’t want to hear the
iTunes playlists already in your iPod, or if you haven’t created playlists yet,
you can create temporary On-The-Go playlists in your iPod. (The On-The-Go
playlist feature isn’t available in first-generation and second-generation
iPods.)You can create one or more lists of songs or entire albums to play in
a certain order, queuing up the songs or albums on the iPod. This option is
particularly useful for picking songs to play right before starting to drive a
car. (Hel-lo! — you shouldn’t be messing with your iPod while driving.)
Queued songs that you select appear automatically in a playlist called On-
The-Go in the Playlists menu. (To use the Playlists menu, see the sections
“Locating Songs” and “Playing a Song,” earlier in this chapter.) The On-The-
Go playlist remains defined in your iPod until you clear it (deleting the songs
from the playlist), save it as a new iPod playlist, or update your iPod with
new music and playlists — in which case it’s copied to your iTunes library
and cleared automatically. You can also save in your iTunes library any new
playlist you create on your iPod.
Selecting songs for the playlist 
To select songs or entire albums for an On-The-Go playlist, follow these steps:
1. Locate and highlight a song or album title.
2. Press and hold the Select button until the title flashes.
3. Repeat Steps 1 and 2 in the order you want the songs or albums played.
To play the On-The-Go playlist, scroll the Music menu until Playlists is high-
lighted, and then press the Select button. The Playlists menu appears. Scroll
to the On-The-Go item, which you can always find at the very end of the list
in the Playlists menu.
You can continue to add songs to the list of queued songs in the On-The-Go
playlist at any time. Your iPod keeps track of the On-The-Go playlist until you
clear it, save it, or update your iPod automatically.
183
Chapter 13: Playing Your iPod

Deleting songs from the playlist
To delete a song from the On-The-Go playlist in your iPod, follow these steps:
1. Select the On-The-Go playlist.
If you don’t see the iPod main menu, press the Menu button repeatedly to
return to the main menu. Then choose Music from the main menu, and
scroll the Music menu until Playlists is highlighted, and then press the
Select button. The Playlists menu appears. Scroll to the On-The-Go item,
which you can always find at the very end of the list in the Playlists menu.
Press the Select button, and the list of songs in the playlist appears.
2. Locate and highlight a song to delete.
3. Press and hold the Select button until the title flashes.
4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 for each song you want to delete from the
playlist.
As you delete songs, the songs disappear from the On-The-Go playlist
one by one. The songs are still in your iPod, of course — only the
playlist is cleared.
Clearing songs from the playlist
To clear the list of queued songs in the On-The-Go playlist, follow these steps:
1. Select the On-The-Go playlist.
If you don’t see the iPod main menu, press the Menu button repeatedly to
return to the main menu. Then choose Music from the main menu, and
scroll the Music menu until Playlists is highlighted, and then press the
Select button. The Playlists menu appears. Scroll to the On-The-Go item,
which you can always find at the very end of the list in the Playlists menu.
Press the Select button, and the list of songs in the playlist appears.
2. Scroll to the very end of the song list and select the Clear Playlist item.
The Clear menu appears, showing the Cancel and Clear Playlist items.
3. Select the Clear Playlist item.
All of the songs disappear from the On-The-Go playlist. The songs are
still in your iPod, of course — only the playlist is cleared. If you don’t
want to clear the playlist, select the Cancel item.
184
Part III: Playing Music 

Saving the playlist in your iPod
You may want to create more than one On-The-Go playlist in your iPod, and
save them temporarily for transferring to your iTunes library. To save your
On-The-Go playlist in your iPod temporarily, follow these steps:
1. Select the On-The-Go playlist.
Choose Music from the main menu and scroll the Music menu until
Playlists is highlighted; then press the Select button. The Playlists menu
appears. Scroll to the On-The-Go item. Press the Select button, and the
list of songs in the playlist appears.
2. Scroll to the very end of the song list and select the Save Playlist item.
The Save menu appears, showing the Cancel and Save Playlist items.
3. Select the Save Playlist item.
The On-The-Go playlist is saved with the name New Playlist 1 (and any
subsequent playlists you save are named New Playlist 2, and so on).
These appear at the very end of the Playlist menu, not in alphabetical
order — they appear just above the On-The-Go Playlist item. If you don’t
want to save the playlist, select the Cancel item.
On-The-Go playlists saved as New Playlist 1, New Playlist 2, and so on, are
stored temporarily in your iPod until you update the iPod automatically. The
On-The-Go playlist is cleared each time you save it as a new playlist, so that
you can start creating another On-The-Go playlist.
Transferring the playlists to iTunes
You can transfer the On-The-Go playlists to your iTunes library. Perhaps the
songs you selected (or their order) inspired you somehow, and you want to
repeat the experience. 
When you update your iPod automatically (as we describe in Chapter 10), 
the current and other saved On-The-Go playlists (called New Playlist 1, New
Playlist 2, and so on) are copied to your iTunes library, saved as regular
playlists, and cleared from the iPod. The automatic update also places the
newly created playlists back in your iPod in proper alphabetical location in
the Playlist menu with the names On-The-Go 1, On-The-Go 2, and so on. 
If you want to change your On-The-Go playlists to have a new name, rename
them in your iTunes library, as shown in Figure 13-1. The next time you update
your iPod automatically, the update changes the playlist names in your iPod
to match your iTunes library.
185
Chapter 13: Playing Your iPod

When updating your iPod manually, as we describe in Chapter 10, you can
drag the On-The-Go playlist and any saved playlists from your iPod library
directly to the iTunes library.
Playing an iPod Shuffle
The iPod shuffle is a special model iPod with no display or any controls to
select specific songs or albums. The idea behind the iPod shuffle is to load it
with songs in the order you want them to play (like a long playlist), and then
play the songs in that order or in shuffle (random) order. See Figure 13-2.
To set the iPod shuffle to play songs in the order they were copied, set the
position switch to the play in order position (the middle position marked by
the arrows pointing in a circle icon). To set it to play songs in random order,
set the position switch to the shuffle position (the lower position marked by
the arrows crossing icon).
To play the iPod shuffle songs, press the Play/Pause button. To stop (or pause)
playback, press the Play/Pause button again. When you stop playback the iPod
shuffle status light blinks green for a minute.

Part III: Playing Music 

To navigate songs in the iPod shuffle, press the Previous/Rewind button to
skip backward, or the Next/Fast-Forward button to skip forward. Press and
hold these buttons to skip more than one song ahead or behind (as if you
were fast-forwarding or rewinding a tape). You can start a song over by press-
ing Previous/Rewind while the song is playing.
If you set the position switch to the play in order position, the Previous/Rewind
button skips backward and the Next/Fast-Forward button skips forward in the
order the songs were copied to the iPod shuffle. However, if you set the posi-
tion switch to the shuffle position, the playing order is randomized first — 
and then the Previous/Rewind button skips backward within the same shuffle
order, and the Next/Fast-Forward button skips forward within the same
shuffle order. For example, if your iPod shuffle, set in the shuffle position,
played the 14th song, then the fifth song, and then the 20th song, pressing the
Previous/Rewind button during the 20th song takes you back to the fifth song,
and pressing it again takes you back to the 14th song; pressing the Next/Fast-
Forward button skips through the songs in the same shuffle order again: the
14th song, the fifth song, and then the 20th song.
To go immediately to the beginning of an iPod shuffle playlist, press the
Play/Pause button three times quickly (within a second).

Chapter 13: Playing Your iPod

Adjusting the Volume
The iPod is quite loud when set to its highest volume — you should turn it
down before using headphones. To adjust the volume, follow these steps:
1. Select and play a song on the iPod.
2. Change the volume with the scroll wheel.
A volume bar appears in the iPod display to guide you. Scroll with your
thumb or finger clockwise to increase the volume, and counterclockwise
to decrease the volume.
If you have the Apple iPod Remote — a handy controller that attaches by
cable to the iPod headphone connection — you can use the volume button
on the remote to adjust the volume. You can also use the remote controller to
play or pause a song, fast-forward or rewind, and skip to the next or previous
song. You can disable the buttons on the remote by setting the controller’s
Hold switch (similar to the iPod Hold switch).
To adjust the volume of an iPod shuffle, press the Volume Up (+) or Volume
Down (-) buttons.
Bookmarking Audible Audio Books
Audible books, articles, and spoken-word titles are stored and played just like
songs in iTunes and your iPod. (You can download titles from www.audible.
com.) When you play an Audible title, you can automatically bookmark your
place in the text with the iPod. Bookmarks work only with Audible titles. If
you have an audio book or spoken-word file in any other format, such as
MP3, bookmarks are not available.
When you use the Pause/Play button to pause an Audible file, the iPod auto-
matically bookmarks that spot. When you press the Play button again, the
Audible file starts playing from that spot.
Bookmarks synchronize when you copy an Audible title to your iPod —
whichever bookmark is farther along in iPod or iTunes becomes the effective
bookmark.

S
ound studio engineers try to make recordings for typical listening envi-
ronments, so they have to simulate the sound experience in those envi-
ronments. Studios typically have home stereo speakers as monitors so that
the engineers can hear what the music sounds like on a home stereo. In the
1950s and early 1960s, when AM radio was king, engineers working on poten-
tial AM radio hits purposely mixed the sound with low-fidelity monaural
speakers so that they could hear what the mix would sound like on radio.
Thank goodness those days are over, and cars offer higher-quality FM radio
as well as very high quality audio systems.
The point is that the quality of the sound is no better than the weakest link in
the audio system. Songs from older times that were mixed to a mono (single)
channel for car radios don’t sound as good even when played on a home
stereo.
The audio CD bridges the gap between home stereos, car stereos, and
portable CD players by enabling you to listen to high-quality music anywhere
as long as you have a decent pair of headphones or good speakers. Music
production changed considerably over the last few decades as more people
listened to higher-quality FM radio; bought massive home stereos; and even-
tually bought CD players for their cars and boats and purchased portable
players to use while flying and jogging. At each step, popular music was reis-
sued in the new medium, such as audio CD, and remixed in the process for
the new sound systems.

The iPod represents a major leap forward in bridging the gap between home
stereos, car stereos, and portable players. Picking up where CDs left off, the
iPod offers nearly as high quality sound as an audio CD in a convenient
device that can hold several weeks’ worth of music. What’s more, you can
tweak the sound not just for home stereos, but also for all your listening envi-
ronments. 
Making Connections
All iPod models enable you to connect headphones to your iPod, or connect
your iPod to your home stereo with standard audio cables, or connect your
iPod to your computer with either FireWire or USB cables. The connections
are as follows. Refer to Figures 14-1 through 14-4.
FireWire/USB dock connector

Part III: Playing Music 

 FireWire/USB dock connector: Current (fourth-generation) and third-
generation models, including iPod mini, have a dock connection on the
bottom for inserting into a dock connector or using with the dock con-
nector cable. The dock connector cable has a dock connector on one
end and a FireWire or USB connector (or both FireWire and USB connec-
tors with a split cable) on the other. 
 FireWire (six pin): First-generation and second-generation iPods have
a six-pin FireWire-only connection on the top that works with any stan-
dard six-pin FireWire cable.
 Headphone/line out and control socket: You can connect headphones or
a 3.5mm stereo mini-plug cable to the headphone/line-out connection. On
a color-display iPod, the headphone/line-out connection also serves as an
A/V (audio-video) connection for displaying slideshows and photos. The
combination headphone and control socket connection on top of the iPod
lets you plug in accessories such as remote control devices and voice
recorders. (See Chapter 20 for information about voice recording.) The
headphone/line-out connection on second-generation models includes an
outer ring for connecting the Apple Remote supplied with those models.

Chapter 14: Getting Wired for Sound

 Dock: For current (fourth-generation) and third-generation iPod models,
the dock supplied with the iPod offers two connections: one for the spe-
cial cable to connect to a FireWire or USB connection, and a head-
phone/line-out connection for a stereo mini-plug cable (or headphones).
For color-display models, the iPod docks include a third connection — 
S-Video Out for connecting to a television monitor and displaying photos
and slideshows, as we describe in Chapter 24.
You can connect the FireWire or USB end of the dock connector cable to
the computer (for synchronizing with iTunes and playing the iPod through
iTunes, as we describe in Chapter 14) or to the power adapter to charge 
the iPod battery. The FireWire or USB connection to the computer provides
power to the iPod as long as the computer’s FireWire or USB hardware offers
power to the device and the computer isn’t in sleep mode. (See Chapter 1 
for power information.)

Part III: Playing Music 

Connecting to a Home Stereo
Home stereo systems come in many shapes and sizes, from an audiophile’s
monster component racks to a kid’s itty-bitty boom box. We’re not talking
about alarm-clock radios, but stereos with speakers that allow you to add
another input device, such as a portable CD player. 
Component-style stereo systems typically include a receiver (which offers a
preamp/amplifier with a volume control, and a tuner to receive FM radio).
Some separate these functions into separate components — such as a preamp,
an amplifier, and a tuner. To find a place to connect your iPod or computer to a
home stereo, look for RCA-type connections that are marked “AUX IN” (for aux-
iliary input), “CD IN” (for connecting a CD player), or “TAPE IN” (for tape deck
input). All-in-one stereos and boom boxes that are all one piece typically don’t
have connections for audio input, although there are exceptions — look at the
back and sides of the unit for any RCA-type connections. 
You can connect a CD or tape player to most stereos with RCA-type cables —
one (typically red or black) for the right channel, and one (typically white if
the other is black, or white or black if the other is red) for the left channel. All
you need is a cable with a stereo mini-plug on one end, and RCA-type connec-
tors on the other, as shown in Figure 14-5. Stereo mini-plugs have two black
bands on the plug, but a mono mini-plug has only one black band.

Chapter 14: Getting Wired for Sound

The Monster high-performance iCable for iPod (formerly called the Monster
Cable) available in the Apple Store, looks cool and offers high-quality sound
for the discerning listener with excellent stereo equipment. 
Connect the stereo mini-plug to the iPod dock headphone/line-out connection
(refer to Figure 14-3), or to the headphone/line-out connection on the top of
the iPod (refer to Figure 14-2; see Figure 14-4 for second-generation models).
Connect the left and right connectors to the stereo system’s audio input —
whatever connections are available, such as AUX IN (for auxiliary input); TAPE
IN (for tape deck input); or CD IN (for CD player input).
Don’t use the PHONO IN connection (for phonograph input) on most stereos.
These connections are for phonographs (turntables) and aren’t properly
matched for other kinds of input devices. If you do this, you might get a loud
buzzing sound that could damage your speakers.
You can control the volume from the iPod by using the scroll wheel, or from
an iPod shuffle by using the volume control. (See Chapter 13 for volume con-
trols.) This controls the volume of the signal from the iPod. Stereo systems
typically have their own volume control to raise or lower the volume of the
amplified speakers. For optimal sound quality when using a home stereo, set
the iPod volume at less than half the maximum output and adjust your listen-
ing volume by using your stereo controls. By doing this, you prevent over-
amplification, which can cause distortion and reduce audio quality.
Connecting Headphones 
and Portable Speakers
Apple designed the iPod to provide excellent sound through headphones, and
with the headphone/line-out connection, the iPod can also play music through
portable speaker systems. The speaker systems must be self-powered or able
to work with very little power (like headphones) and allow audio to be input
through a 3.5mm mini-plug stereo connection. Even the tiny iPod shuffle offers
a standard headphone/line-out connection, as shown in Figure 14-6.
Figure 14-5:

Part III: Playing Music 

The iPod includes a small amplifier powerful enough to deliver audio through
the headphone/line-out connection. All current models, including the iPod
shuffle, have a frequency response of 20 Hz (hertz) to 20,000 Hz, which pro-
vides distortion-free music at the lowest or highest pitches. Hertz has noth-
ing to do with rental cars — a hertz is a unit of frequency equal to one cycle
per second. At pitches that produce frequencies of 20 cycles per second, or
20,000 cycles per second, the iPod responds with distortion-free sound.
Portable speaker systems typically include built-in amplifiers and a volume
control, and offer a stereo mini-plug that you can attach directly to the iPod
headphone/line-out connection or to the dock headphone/line-out connection.
To place the external speakers farther away from the iPod, use a stereo mini-
plug extension cable — available at most consumer electronics stores — which
has a stereo mini-plug on one end and a stereo mini-socket on the other.
Portable speaker systems typically have volume controls to raise or lower
the volume. Set your iPod volume to half and then raise or lower the volume
of your speaker system.
When you travel, take an extra pair of headphones (or earbuds) and a splitter
cable, such as the one in Figure 14-7, available in any consumer electronics
store. The Monster iSplitter is available in the Apple Store. You can plug both
headphones into the iPod and share the music with someone on the road.

Accessories for the iHome
No home should be without an iPod on a pedestal, raising it above the desk
clutter so that you can see its display and use its controls. Although you can
play the music in your iTunes library from your computer, you might want to
use the iPod in another room that has a stereo system, or you might want to
play the iPod, freeing the computer to do other things.
Most of the accessories for the iPod (and hundreds of products are available)
are designed for travel, and we describe the best in Chapter 15. However,
companies also provide docks and stands for older iPods that don’t have
docks, as well as alternatives to the limited Apple Remote that connects by
cable to the iPod.
The $30 iPodDock from Bookendz (www.bookendzdocks.com) supports the
older iPod models in an upside down position on a desk or table and offers
connection ports (audio and FireWire) for instant docking. The iPodCradle,
also from Bookendz, supports the iPod in an upright position and is compati-
ble with most cases on the market, so you can use your iPod in the cradle
with or without the case. Bookendz also offers an iPodDock for third-
generation iPods as an alternative to the standard Apple dock.

Digital Lifestyle Outfitters (www.dlodirect.com) is a 20-watts-per-channel,
four-speaker boombox system with a dock for a full-size iPod or iPod mini.
It also includes a digital FM radio and auxiliary input jack for connecting
another music source, and draws power either from an AC adapter or six 
D-size batteries (not included). While under AC power, the iBoom can
recharge your iPod’s battery. 
If you don’t want to remove your iPod from its dock to use its navigational con-
trols, get a remote control. The Apple Remote, which is supplied with second-
generation and some third-generation models, provides the usual CD player
controls: Play/Pause, Next Track, Previous Track, and a volume button. It also
has a Hold switch, just like the iPod, to render the controls useless and prevent
accidental use. You connect the Apple Remote to the headphone/line out con-
nection at the top of the iPod (not the dock). This connection has an outer ring
for connecting remote control devices. The Apple Remote is tethered to the
iPod by cable, so it isn’t as useful in the home as it would be in a car — it has a
clip for clipping the remote control to your shirt.
When your iPod is tethered to a dock and connected to your home stereo,
you don’t have to be within reach to control it remotely — you can control
your iPod with a wireless remote control. For example, Ten Technology (www.
tentechnology.com) offers the stylish $49.95 naviPod that provides wireless
remote control of your iPod with standard Play/Pause, Next Track, Previous
Track, and volume controls. The naviPod uses infrared wireless technology
with a receiver unit that plugs directly into the control socket on top of the
iPod. The receiver has FireWire and headphone connections on the bottom,
which allow you to connect your headphones or hook up your iPod to your
computer without removing the naviPod receiver.
Engineered Audio (www.engineeredaudio.com) offers the RemoteRemote
for $34.95. Unlike infrared wireless controls, RemoteRemote is an RF (radio
frequency) wireless remote control that works around corners and through
walls. RemoteRemote offers standard Play/Pause, Next Track, Previous Track,
and volume controls, and it operates in a range of up to 100 feet.

 Protecting your iPod with carrying cases
 Using power accessories on the road
You can truly go anywhere with an iPod. If you can’t plug it into a power
source while it’s playing, you can use the battery for at least eight hours
of playing time (and up to 15 hours for color-display models), before having
to recharge. You can find all the accessories that you need to travel with an
iPod in the Apple Store at www.apple.com.
Put on “Eight Miles High” by the Byrds while cruising in a plane at 40,000 feet.
Ride the rails listening to “All Aboard” by Muddy Waters, followed by “Peavine”
by John Lee Hooker. Or cruise on the Autobahn in Germany with Kraftwerk.
Whatever. You have an entire music library with you wherever you go. 
The iPod provides high-quality music no matter what the environment —
even in an earthquake. With skip protection, you don’t have to worry about
turbulence, potholes, or strenuous exercise causing the music to skip. In
addition to the hard drive, iPods also use a memory cache. The cache is
made up of solid-state memory, with no mechanical or moving parts, so
movement doesn’t affect playback. Skip protection works by preloading up to
20 minutes of music to the cache at a time (depending on the iPod model).
The iPod plays music from the memory cache rather than the hard drive.
Playing Car Tunes
We always wanted a car that we could fill up with music just as easily as fill-
ing it up with gasoline, without having to carry dozens of cassettes or CDs.
With an iPod, an auto-charger to save on battery power, and a way to connect
the iPod to your car’s stereo system, you’re ready to pump music. (Start your

engine and queue up “Getting in Tune” and then “Going Mobile” by The Who.)
Go one step further and get a new BMW or similar car that offers an iPod
installed and integrated into the car’s stereo system so that you can control
it from your steering wheel.
There are three ways to link up your iPod with a car stereo:
 Use a cassette player: Use a standard cassette adapter and an iPod
power adapter for your car’s lighter socket. This works even with rental
cars, as long as they are supplied with cassette players. For a semi-
permanent installation you can add a car mount to keep your iPod
secure. Cassette adapters offer medium quality that is usually better
than wireless adapters.
 Use your radio: Use a wireless adapter that plays your iPod as if it were
a station on your FM radio dial. Some car mounts offer built-in wireless
adapters. This may be your only inexpensive choice if you don’t have a
cassette deck. Wireless adapters may not work well in cities where FM
stations crowd the radio dial.
 Install an iPod interface: Install an iPod interface for your car stereo
that offers high-quality line-in audio input and power. Once you have this
interface installed, you simply plug your iPod into a cable and hide it in
the glove box, as you can control the iPod from your car stereo’s head
unit. This method offers the best sound quality.
Unfortunately, not many car stereos offer a mini-socket for audio input, and
as of this writing, the few accessories that integrate directly with car stereos
require custom car installations. So far, there are no standard dock connec-
tors for car stereos, which would be totally cool because the iPod is clearly
designed for plugging into a “car dock” that offers both power and a connec-
tion to the car’s stereo system. (Stay iTuned, because car docks are on the
horizon.)
Getting in tune with cassette 
and power adapters
Until you can get a car with a mini-socket for stereo audio input (a.k.a. “stereo-
in connection”) or a FireWire connection — or get one installed — you can use
a cassette-player adapter to connect with your car stereo or a wireless device
that we describe later in this chapter, in the section “Connecting by Wireless
Radio.” These solutions provide lower sound quality than iPod interface instal-
lations or stereo-in connections but are inexpensive and work with most cars.
200
Part III: Playing Music 

Many car stereos have a cassette player, and you can buy a cassette adapter
from most consumer electronics stores or from the Apple Store (such as the
Sony CPA-9C Car Cassette Adapter). The cassette-player adapter, shown in
Figure 15-1, looks like a tape cassette with a mini-plug cable (which sticks out
through the slot when you’re using the adapter).
You can connect the mini-plug cable directly to the iPod, to the auto-charger
if a mini-socket is offered, or to the Apple Remote that in turn is connected to
the iPod. Then insert the adapter into the cassette player, being careful not to
get the cable tangled up inside the player.
One inherent problem with this approach is that the cable that dangles from
your cassette player looks unsightly. You also might have some trouble eject-
ing the adapter if the cable gets wedged in the door, but overall, this method
is the best for most cars because it provides the best sound quality.
The Apple Remote, which is supplied with some models and optional with
others, is more useful in a car than almost anywhere else — it provides the
usual CD player controls: Play/Pause, Next Track, Previous Track, and a
volume button (see Chapter 14), so you can pause a song, skip to the next
or previous song, or adjust the volume without having to reach over to your
iPod while driving. You can attach the Apple Remote to your shirt or the edge
of something thin, such as an air-conditioner vent in your dashboard.
While some new vehicles (particularly SUVs and cars such as the Toyota
Matrix mini-station wagon) offer 110-volt power outlets you can use with your
Apple-supplied battery charger, most cars offer only a lighter/power socket
that requires a power adapter to use with your iPod. Be careful to pick the
right type of power adapter for your car’s lighter/power socket. The auto-
mobile power adapters for first-generation and second-generation iPods 
provide a FireWire connector, but the adapters for the new dockable iPods
use a dock connector cable. Some adapters, such as the Kensington Cassette
Adapter/Charger for iPod (www.kensington.com), include a retractable
power cord that doesn’t dangle in front of the dashboard or tangle with other
cords and cables.
Belkin (www.belkin.com) offers the Auto Kit for $49.95, and it includes a car
power adapter with a convenient socket for a stereo mini-plug cable (which
can connect directly to a car stereo if the stereo has a mini-socket for audio
input). The adapter includes a volume-adjustable amplifier to boost the sound
coming from the iPod before it goes into the cassette adapter or car stereo.
Even with a cassette adapter and power adapter, you have at best a clumsy
solution that uses one cable (power) from a power adapter to the iPod, and
201
Chapter 15: Listening While on the Move

another cable (audio) to your car stereo cassette adapter. Attached to these
wires, your iPod needs a secure place to sit while your car moves — you
don’t want it bouncing around on the passenger seat.
You can fit your iPod securely in position in a car without getting a custom
installation. The TuneDok ($29.95) from Belkin (www.belkin.com) holds
your iPod securely and fits into your car’s cup-holder; see Figure 15-2. The
TuneDok’s ratcheting neck and height-adjustment feature lets you reposition
the iPod to your liking. The cable-management clip eliminates loose and tan-
gled cables, and the large and small rubber base and cup fits most cup holders.
MARWARE (www.marware.com) offers an inexpensive solution for both car
use and personal use. The $5.95 Car Holder, available when you select a 
MARWARE SportSuit case, attaches to the dashboard of your car, as shown in
Figure 15-3, and lets you attach an iPod that’s wearing one of the MARWARE
SportSuit covering cases (see “Dressing Up Your iPod for Travel” later in this
chapter). The clip on the back attaches to the Car Holder.

you install the bracket, you can use different custom holders for the iPod
models or for cell phones and other portable devices.

Chapter 15: Listening While on the Move

Going mobile . . . with 
car stereo integration
Premium car manufacturers are introducing new cars that are iPod-ready —
they include an iPod interface for the car stereo system. For example, BMW
offers an iPod-ready model with audio controls on the steering wheel.
Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, Mini-Cooper, Nissan, Alfa Romeo, and Ferrari all offer
iPod-ready models. In addition, car stereo manufacturers such as Alpine and
Clarion offer car audio systems with integrated iPod interfaces; see Figure 15-4.
Unless you can afford a new car that’s iPod-ready, you can opt for a custom
installation of an iPod interface for your existing car stereo and car power
(such as using a custom cable interface for a CD changer, which can be
installed into your dashboard by a skilled car audio specialist). For example,
you can order a professional installation with the Dension ICE-Link ($149
to $239, depending on your car), which adds line-level audio output and
recharging capability to almost any vehicle. It uses the CD-changer connec-
tions in car CD players to directly connect your iPod into the car’s audio
system. Dension (www.dension.com) assumes that the buyer is a profes-
sional installer, and although it’s possible to install it yourself (especially if
you use a CD changer in your trunk), most installations require taking apart
the dashboard and installing the ICE-Link behind your CD stereo. ICE-Link can
be combined with almost any iPod mount.

204
Part III: Playing Music 

If your car stereo does not offer a CD changer interface, you may want to have
a new car stereo professionally installed that offers a CD changer interface,
such as the Alpine CDA-9835, which can be installed with the Alpine KCA-420i
Interface Adapter for iPod (www.alpine-usa.com/driveyouripod/). Using
this integrated iPod setup you can control the iPod from the Alpine head unit
(which can be any Alpine head unit that is compatible with Ai-NET, Alpine’s car
network). The car stereo provides power to the iPod to keep it fully charged —
in fact, the iPod is always charged up with power while the vehicle’s ignition is
on or in ACC mode (the car stereo itself does not have to be powered on). You
can hide your iPod in the glove box while connected to the Alpine, and control
the iPod as if it were the Alpine’s CD changer, selecting songs by playlist, artist,
or album — without having your iPod in view.
Connecting by Wireless Radio
A wireless music adapter lets you play music from your iPod on an FM radio,
with no connection or cable, although the sound quality might suffer a bit
due to interference. We always take a wireless adapter with us whenever we
rent a car — even if a rental car has no cassette player (ruling out the use of
our cassette adapter), the car probably has an FM radio.
You can use a wireless adapter in a car, on a boat, on the beach with a portable
radio, or even in your home with a stereo system and tuner. We even use it in
hotel rooms with a clock radio.
To use a wireless adapter, follow these steps:
1. Set the wireless adapter to an unused FM radio frequency.
Some adapters offer you a choice of several frequencies — typically
88.1-, 88.3-, 88.5-, and 88.7 MHz — and others let you pick any FM fre-
quency. You choose the frequency and set the adapter according to its
instructions. Avoid FM stations at specific frequencies that would inter-
fere with your iPod signal.
2. Connect the wireless adapter to the iPod headphone/line-out connec-
tor or to the line-out connector on the iPod dock.
The wireless adapter acts like a miniature radio station, broadcasting to
a nearby FM radio. (Sorry, you can’t go much farther than a few feet, so
no one else can hear your Wolfman Jack impersonation.)
3. Tune to the appropriate frequency on the FM dial. 
Tune any nearby radio to the same FM frequency that you chose in Step 1.
You need to set the adapter close enough to the radio’s antenna to work,
making it impractical for home stereos — you can get better quality sound
by connecting to a home stereo with a cable.
205
Chapter 15: Listening While on the Move

Don’t be surprised if the wireless adapter doesn’t work as well in cities —
other radio stations might cause too much interference.
Here are just a few wireless adapters that we recommend:
 For $29.99, the irock 400FM Wireless Music Adapter (www.myirock.
com) from First International Digital requires standard replaceable 
batteries and offers a car power adapter.
 The TuneCast II Mobile FM Transmitter ($49.99) from Belkin (www.
belkin.com) is particularly convenient in a car because it includes a 
14-inch cable that delivers power when used with the Belkin Mobile
Power Cord for iPod, so that you can preserve your batteries for times
when you’re away from an alternate source. It offers four programmable
memory slots for saving the clearest radio frequency wherever you go.
 The TransPod FM ($99) from Digital Lifestyle Outfitters, available from
Everything iPod (www.everythingipod.com), is an excellent all-in-one
wireless FM transmitter, mounting system, and power adapter for using
your iPod in a car, and it costs less than purchasing all three items 
separately.
Dressing Up Your iPod for Travel
The simple protective carrying case supplied with some iPod models is just
not as stylin’ as the myriad accessories that you can get for dressing up your
iPod for travel. You can find different types of protective gear, from leather
jackets to aluminum cases, in many different styles and colors — Apple offers
access to hundreds of products from other suppliers on its accessories pages
(www.apple.com/ipod/accessories.html). Some are designed primarily
for protecting your iPod from harm; others are designed to provide some
measure of protection while also providing access to controls.
On the extreme end of the spectrum are hardened cases that are ready for
battlefields in deserts or jungles — the Humvees of iPod protective gear.
The iPod Armor ($49.95) by Matias Corporation (www.ipodarmor.com) is a
sturdy case that fits all models of iPod and offers possibly the best protection
against physical trauma on the market. Your iPod rests within a hard, resilient
metal exoskeleton that can withstand the abuse of bouncing down a flight of
metal stairs without letting your iPod pop out. Of course, the very same fea-
ture that prevents your iPod from popping out also makes the iPod Armor dif-
ficult to open to get access to it — this is not a case to use while listening to
music.
206
Part III: Playing Music 

Business travelers can combine personal items into one carrying case. The
iPod Leather Organizer from Belkin is made from fine-grain leather that even
Ricardo Montalban would rave about. The case holds personal essentials,
like business and credit cards, in four convenient slots. A handy mesh pocket
keeps earphones easily accessible, and a billfold holds money and receipts. 
On the sporty side, MARWARE (www.marware.com) offers the SportSuit
Convertible case ($39.95) with a patented belt clip system offering inter-
changeable clip options for use with the MARWARE Car Holder or with an
armband or belt for jogging or working out. The neoprene case has vulcan-
ized rubber grips on each side and bottom for a no-slip grip and plastic
inserts for impact protection, offering full access to all iPod controls and con-
nections while the iPod is in the case. There’s even space inside the lid to
store earbud headphones.
If you like to carry a backpack with everything in it, consider the very first
backpack ever designed to control an iPod within it: The Burton Amp Pack
($199.95) (www.sidewayspeople.com/site/catalog/burton-amp-pack.
htm) lets you switch songs on your iPod by pressing a button on the shoulder
strap. Constructed from ballistic nylon, the Amp Pack offers a secure iPod
storage pocket, a headphone port located on a shoulder strap, an easy-
access side entry laptop compartment, and padded ergonomic shoulder
straps with a soft, flexible control pad built into a strap. Perfect for listening
to Lou Reed while hanging onto a pole in a subway car, or the Hollies while
navigating your way to the back of the bus.
Using Power Accessories
If you want to charge your iPod battery when you travel abroad, you can’t
count on finding the same voltage as in your home country. However, you
still need to plug your Apple power adapter into something to recharge your
iPod. Fortunately, power adapters are available in most airports, but the
worldly traveler might want to consider saving time and money by getting a
travel kit of power accessories.
We found several varieties of power kits for world travel in our local interna-
tional airport. Most kits include a set of AC plugs with prongs that fit different
electrical outlets around the world. You can connect your iPod power adapter
to these adapters. The AC plugs typically support outlets in North America,
Japan, China, the United Kingdom, Continental Europe, Korea, Australia, and
Hong Kong.
207
Chapter 15: Listening While on the Move

One way to mitigate the battery blues is to get an accessory that lets you 
use replaceable alkaline batteries — the kind that you can find in any conve-
nience store. The Backup Battery Pack ($59.95) from Belkin (www.belkin.
com) lets you power your iPod with four standard AA alkaline replaceable
batteries — even when your internal iPod battery is drained. Discreet suction
cups secure the unit to the back of your iPod without marring your iPod
finish. A charge-level indicator tells you when your batteries are running low.
Another way to supply power to your iPod on the road is to use your
FireWire-equipped or USB 2.0-equipped laptop to supply the power (make
sure that you use FireWire or USB 2.0 hardware that provides power — see
Chapter 1), and then use a power adapter with your laptop. You can use, for
example, the Kensington Universal Car/Air Adapter from Apple to plug a Mac
PowerBook or iBook into any car cigarette lighter or EmPower-equipped air-
line seat (the EmPower in-seat power system can provide either 110-volt AC
or 15-volt DC power in an aircraft seat for passenger use). Then connect the
iPod to the laptop with a FireWire cable.
If you fly often, the APC Travel Power ($79), available from the Apple Store,
might be just the ticket. It includes an adapter that plugs into an airline seat
power connection, as well as a car power adapter. The unit offers 75 watts of
continuous power with built-in circuit protection. The flight attendant will
still tell you to turn off your iPod before takeoff and landing, but you won’t
waste precious battery power during the flight.

 Playing songs on your iPod through iTunes
 Playing songs on your stereo through a wireless AirTunes connection
I
f you like to entertain folks by spinning tunes and playing movies at home
or at parties, iTunes could easily become your media jockey console. You
could set up a laptop that connects to a home stereo and connect the iPods
that your friends bring over to augment your iTunes library. Imagine how
much music you could choose from by connecting several 60GB iPods, each
with 15,000 songs, to an iTunes library that already holds thousands of songs!
But that’s not all — you can keep track of video files using an iTunes playlist,
and play your videos in full-screen mode.
Your computer is a mean multimedia machine with the ability to mix sounds
and videos from different sources and play them through built-in displays
and speakers, external displays and speakers, and headphones. Macs and
PCs can play audio CDs, DVDs, and digital video files as well as iTunes music.
This chapter describes how you can play video files in iTunes, including music
videos and movie trailers available in the iTunes Music Store. It also shows
how to play music stored on your iPod through iTunes on your computer, so
that the music comes through your computer’s speakers. It also shows how
you can use a wireless connection with AirPort Express and AirTunes to trans-
mit iTunes songs to your home stereo or speakers without any wires. You
could stroll through the party with your laptop, choosing songs, taking
requests, and beaming the music directly to your stereo system.
Changing the Computer’s Output Volume
You can control the volume and other characteristics of the sound coming
out of your computer’s speakers, headphones, or external speakers. Even if
you connect your computer to a stereo amplifier with its own volume and

equalizer controls, it’s best to get the volume right at the source — your com-
puter and iTunes — and then adjust the output volume as you please on your
stereo or external speaker unit.
Volume is controlled by the computer system’s audio controls. iTunes also
controls the volume, but that control is within the range of the computer’s
volume setting. For example, if you set your computer’s volume to half and
set iTunes volume to full, you get half volume because the computer is limit-
ing the volume to half. If you set your computer volume at half and also
reduce the iTunes volume to half, you actually get one-quarter volume — half
the computer’ setting. The sound can be further adjusted after it leaves your
computer by using the stereo system or external speakers with controls.
The appropriate volume depends entirely on your preferences for hearing
music, but in general, the maximum level of output from your computer is
preferable when connecting to a stereo system or speakers with volume con-
trols. After setting your computer to the maximum volume, adjust the iTunes
volume or your stereo or speaker volume (or both) to get the best sound.
When using the computer’s speakers or headphones, the computer’s volume
and the iTunes volume are the only volume controls that you have, so after
adjusting the volume on your computer to the maximum level (or lower if
you prefer), adjust the iTunes volume.
Adjusting the sound on a Mac
The Mac was built for sound from the very start. Making and playing music
has been part of the Mac culture since day one, when Steve Jobs introduced
the original Mac to an audience with sound coming from its small speaker.
(It played synthesized speech and simple tones, but it was the first personal
computer with built-in sound.) 
Today’s Mac comes with built-in or external speakers and at least one head-
phone/line-out connection that you can use to connect external speakers or a
stereo system. Mac OS X lets you configure output speakers and control levels
for stereo speakers and multichannel audio devices.
If you use external speakers, headphones, or a stereo system, make sure that
you connect these devices properly before adjusting the volume. To adjust
the volume on your Mac, follow these steps:
1. Choose System Preferences from the Apple menu or the Dock, and
then click the Sound icon. 
Otherwise, press Option and a volume control key simultaneously as a
shortcut. You can have iTunes open and playing music while you do this.
210
Part III: Playing Music 

2. In the Sound preferences window, click Output.
If you have headphones attached, a Headphones option appears in the list
of sound output devices; if not, an External Speakers or Internal Speakers
option appears, as shown in Figure 16-1. If you have external speakers and
a pair of headphones attached to your Mac, the external speakers disap-
pear from the Sound preferences, but they’re still enabled.
3. Adjust the volume by dragging the Output volume slider.
You can drag the slider to adjust the volume as you listen to music. You
also have a Mute button in this window — click the Mute check box to
silence your Mac. You can also adjust the stereo balance by dragging the
Balance slider to put more music in the left or right channels.
4. Close the Preferences window by choosing System Preferences➪Quit
System Preferences or by clicking the red button in the upper-left
corner of the window.
The Sound preferences window isn’t like a dialog — when you change
settings, you can hear the effect immediately without having to click an
OK button. (There isn’t an OK button, anyway.)
Adjusting the sound in Windows
Windows XP and Windows 2000 let you configure output speakers and con-
trol levels for stereo speakers and multichannel audio devices.

Use the Sounds and Audio Devices Properties dialog to change the volume.
To open this window, choose Start➪Control Panel, and click the Sounds and
Audio Devices icon. Then click the Volume tab.
As shown in Figure 16-2, the Sounds and Audio Devices Properties dialog
offers the Device volume slider — drag this slider to set the volume. You can
also silence your PC by selecting the Mute check box.
If you select the Place Volume Icon in the Taskbar option, and your sound
card supports changing the volume with software, a speaker icon appears in
the notification area of Windows. You can then change the volume quickly
without having to open the Sounds and Audio Devices Properties dialog —
simply click the speaker icon and drag the slider that pops up. For more
information about adjusting sound on a PC, see PCs For Dummies, 9th Edition

Queuing up tunes with Party Shuffle
Playlists are great for organizing music in the order that you want to play it,
but you can have iTunes serve up songs at random by using Party Shuffle. It’s
not a dance step or pub game — Party Shuffle is a dynamic playlist that auto-
matically generates a semi-random selection in a list that you can modify on
the fly. With Party Shuffle at work, you might even find songs in your library
you forgot about or rarely play — Party Shuffle always throws a few rarely
played songs into the mix. 
To use Party Shuffle, follow these steps:
1. Click Party Shuffle in the Source pane. 
The Song List pane and Browse pane are replaced with the Party Shuffle
track list and settings at the bottom, as shown in Figure 16-3.
2. Select a source from the Source pop-up menu below the Party Shuffle
track list.
You can select Library for the entire library, or select any playlist
(including a smart playlist) as the source for music in the Party Shuffle.
If you select a playlist, Party Shuffle limits its choices to songs from that
playlist.

3. Set the following options: 
• Recently played songs: Choose how many songs should remain in
the list after they are played. You can drag already-played songs
(even though they are grayed out after playing) to a spot later in
the list to play them again.
• Upcoming songs: Choose how many songs should be listed as
upcoming (not yet played). By displaying upcoming songs first,
you can decide whether to rearrange the list or delete songs before
they are played.
• Play higher rated songs more often: Turn on this option to have
iTunes add more high-rated songs to the random list. Using this
option, you weight the randomness in favor of higher-rated songs.
See Chapter 9 to learn how to add ratings to songs.
4. Optional: If you don’t like the order of songs, you can rearrange it;
any songs you don’t like you can eliminate.
You can rearrange the order of songs in the Party Shuffle by dragging
songs to different positions in the Party Shuffle list. Eliminate songs by
selecting them in the Party Shuffle list and pressing Delete/Backspace
(or choosing Edit➪Clear).
5. Play the Party Shuffle by selecting the first song and clicking the Play
button or pressing the Space bar.
You can start playing from the first song or from any song on the list.
(When you pick a song in the middle to start playing, the songs before
it are grayed out to show that they won’t play.)
6. Add, delete, or rearrange songs even while the Party Shuffle plays.
While the Party Shuffle list plays, you can add songs in one of two ways:
• Open the Party Shuffle in a separate window by double-clicking the
Party Shuffle item in the Source pane. You can then drag songs
from the main iTunes window — either from the Library or from
a playlist — directly into position in the Party Shuffle track list.
• Without opening Party Shuffle in a separate window, you can
switch to the library or a playlist, and drag the song to the Party
Shuffle item in the Source pane, just like dragging a song to a
playlist. When you add a song to the Party Shuffle, it shows up at
the end of the track list. You can then drag it to a new position.
You can add one or more albums to the Party Shuffle track list by dragging the
albums; the songs play in album order. You can also add all the songs by an
artist by dragging the artist name. Party Shuffle acts just like a playlist, except
dynamically — you add, delete, and change the order of songs on the fly.
Cool DJs mix the Party Shuffle window with other open playlist windows —
just double-click the playlist item in the Source pane to open it in a separate

window. You can then drag songs from different playlist windows to the Party
Shuffle window while the Party Shuffle plays, adding songs in whatever order
you want in real time.
Cross-fading song playback
You can often hear a song on the radio fade out as another song immediately
fades in right over the first song’s ending. This is a cross-fade, and with iTunes,
you can smoothly transition from the ending of a song to the beginning of the
next one. Ordinarily, iTunes is set to have a short cross-fade of one second —
the amount of time between the end of the fade in the first song and the start
of the fade in the second song.
What’s totally cool about this is that you can cross-fade between two songs
in iTunes even if they’re from different sources — the songs could be in your
library, in a shared library, on CD or DVD, or even on one (or more!) iPods
connected to your computer and playing through iTunes (as we describe in
“Playing an iPod through iTunes,” later in this chapter). You could play DJ at a
party with a massive music library on a laptop and still augment that library
with one or more iPods and any number of CDs, and the songs cross-fade to
the next just like on the radio or at a dance party with a professional DJ.
You can change the amount of the cross-fade by choosing Edit➪Preferences
in Windows or iTunes➪Preferences on a Mac, and then clicking the Audio
button. The Audio dialog appears, as shown in Figure 16-4.
Figure 16-4:

215
Chapter 16: Spinning Tunes Like a DJ

In the Audio dialog, you select the Crossfade playback option, and then
increase or decrease the amount of the cross-fade by dragging the slider.
Each notch in the slider is one second. The maximum amount of cross-fade is
12 seconds. With a longer cross-fade you get a longer overlap from one song
to the next — the second song starts before the first one ends. To turn off the
cross-fade, deselect the check box.
Playing Videos in iTunes
Without any fanfare, Apple slipped a new feature into iTunes version 4.8 —
the ability to play video files and track video files using playlists. Besides
watching videos in the iTunes Music Store, you can now purchase videos for
downloading into iTunes. You can also bring your own digital video files into
iTunes. While today’s iPod doesn’t play videos, we bet that future iPods will.
Acquiring videos
You can watch QuickTime and MPEG-4 movies (files that end in .mov or .mp4)
in iTunes. QuickTime, Apple’s digital video file format, is installed on every
Mac. It’s also installed on PCs along with the Windows version of iTunes.
QuickTime is used extensively in the digital video production world for
making DVDs and movies for the Web. Music videos, movie trailers, and other
videos you can buy on the iTunes Music Store are in the QuickTime format.
MPEG-4 (Motion Picture Expert Group Version 4) is a standard format for digi-
tal video that works on just about any computer that can play video. 
The iTunes Music Store offers music videos for sale. You can select and buy a
music video, either as part of an album package or separately, and download
the video into iTunes just like a song. The video file appears in your Purchased
Music list just like any other song, as shown in Figure 16-5.
Video files are organized in folders and stored in the music library on your
hard drive just like song files, as we describe in Chapter 11. You can find the
video file’s location on your hard drive and its type by choosing File➪Get
Info, just as you would for a song file. (See Figure 16-6.) The Summary pane
shows information about the video file, including its location and file type, in
the Info pane. 
You can assign video files to playlists just like song files, but you can’t copy
them to an iPod (at least not until iPods can play video). You may want to
create a playlist that consists solely of videos. Simply create the playlist as
we describe in Chapter 9, and drag videos from Browse or List view into the
playlist.
216
Part III: Playing Music 

If you have video files of your own, dragging them into iTunes makes it easier
to find and play them. Drag each video file from the Windows desktop or Mac
Finder to the Library or directly to a playlist in the iTunes Source pane, or to
the Browse or song List view on the right side of the iTunes window, as shown
in Figure 16-7.

Chapter 16: Spinning Tunes Like a DJ

You can create your own QuickTime or MPEG-4 video files with a suitable
video editing application such as iMovie for the Mac (part of the iLife soft-
ware suite that includes iTunes), or Apple’s QuickTime Pro for Windows,
available from the Apple Store.
Playing videos
To watch a video in iTunes, double-click it in your library or playlist. Use the
iTunes Play/Pause, Forward/Next, and Previous/Rewind buttons to control play-
back, and the iTunes volume slider to control the volume, just like with songs. 
The video appears in the Artwork pane in the lower-left corner of the iTunes
window, as shown in Figure 16-8. If the Artwork pane isn’t visible, click the
Artwork button. 
You can also fill your entire display with the video picture, or view it in a 
separate window. To watch the video full screen, click the full-screen video
button underneath the Artwork pane; refer to Figure 16-8. This button is usu-
ally grayed out unless you have already selected and are playing a video.
After clicking the full-screen video button, video fills your screen and plays.
Pressing any key during playback stops full-screen video and returns you to
the iTunes window.
Figure 16-7:

218
Part III: Playing Music 

To watch a video in a separate window, click the video as it plays in the
Artwork pane. To make this setting more permanent, set your iTunes prefer-
ences to play video in a separate window. Open iTunes preferences by choos-
ing Edit➪Preferences in Windows or iTunes➪Preferences on a Mac, and click
the Advanced button. For the “Play video” option in the Advanced pane,
choose “in a separate window” in the pop-up menu as shown in Figure 16-9.
From that point on, videos in your library play in a separate window that
offers QuickTime playback controls, as shown in Figure 16-10.

The QuickTime video buttons offer more control over playback in the sepa-
rate window: Use the right-facing triangle on the bottom-left side of the
window to play or pause, and drag the slider to move forward or backward
through the video; refer to Figure 16-10. You can click the rewind or fast-
forward buttons on the bottom-right side of the window to move backward 
or forward through a video.
The current video controls in iTunes seem crude, but we have no doubt that
iTunes will be improved in the future to provide more video playback and
organizational features, and that future iPods will be brimming with videos.
Playing an iPod through iTunes
You can’t copy the songs from your iPod into your iTunes library using
iTunes, but you can use iTunes on your computer to play the songs directly
from the iPod. You can even bring your friend’s iPod with you to a party,
along with your laptop running iTunes, and include your friend’s iPod songs
in your Party Shuffle — include anyone’s iPod songs in your Party Shuffle. Not
only can you do that, but as you play songs from different iPods or from your
library, you can cross-fade them, as we describe previously in “Cross-fading
song playback,” earlier in this chapter.
When you set your iPod to manually update and connect the iPod to your
computer, the iPod name appears in the iTunes Source pane, and when you
select it, the iPod’s songs appear in the iTunes window. You can connect
someone else’s iPod this way, as we describe in the following section,
“Connecting your iPod to another computer.”
To play music on your iPod in iTunes, follow these steps:
1. Connect the iPod to your computer, holding down Ô-Option on a Mac,
or Ctrl-Alt on a PC, to prevent automatic updating.
Figure 16-10:

2. Set the iPod to update manually.
To set the iPod to update manually, see Chapter 10. (The iPod updates
automatically by default, but you can change that.)
3. Select the iPod name in the iTunes Source pane.
After selecting the iPod in the iTunes Source pane, the list of songs on
the iPod appears, as shown in Figure 16-11. You can scroll or browse
the iPod’s library just like the main iTunes library (as we describe in
Chapter 7). Click the Browse button to browse the iPod’s contents.
4. Optional: View the iPod playlists.
After selecting the iPod in the iTunes Source pane, you can click the tri-
angle next to its name to view the iPod’s playlists.
5. Click a song in the iPod song list, and then click the iTunes Play button.
When an iPod song is playing in iTunes, it’s just like playing a song from the
iTunes library or a track on a CD. The Status pane above the list of songs tells
you the name of the artist and song (if known) and the elapsed time.
Connecting your iPod to another computer
The previous section shows you how to connect your iPod to your computer.
What if you want to connect your iPod to a computer other than your own?
Or what if a friend arrives with an iPod filled with songs that you’d like to
Figure 16-11:
Select the
iPod in the
Source
pane and
play a song.
221
Chapter 16: Spinning Tunes Like a DJ

hear, and you want to hear them on your stereo system that’s already con-
nected to your computer?
You can connect your iPod to another computer, or connect someone else’s
iPod to your computer. Either way, iTunes starts up and recognizes that the
iPod is not matched to the iTunes library (because it is matched to some
other computer’s iTunes library). iTunes displays a message asking whether
you want to change the link to this iTunes music library and replace all exist-
ing songs and playlists. This is important: click No.
Unless you want to change the contents of your iPod to reflect this com-
puter’s music library, don’t click Yes. If you click the Yes button, iTunes erases
the music library of your iPod and then updates your iPod with the library on
this computer. If you’re using a public computer with no music in its iTunes
library, you end up with an empty iPod. If you’re using a friend’s computer,
your friend’s library copies to your iPod, erasing whatever was on your iPod.
So don’t click Yes unless you really want to completely change the music on
your iPod. You’ve been warned.
With color-display iPods, you also get a similar warning message about
changing the link to the photo library and replacing all photos in the iPod.
Again, click No to prevent this from happening.
After clicking No, the iPod appears in the iTunes Source pane. Set the iPod to
update manually (see Chapter 9) to play songs from your iPod.
You can use a Windows-formatted iPod with a Mac, but you can’t use a Mac-
formatted iPod with Windows. When you install an iPod with Windows, the iPod
is formatted for Windows; but you are still in luck with a Mac because Macs can
read Windows drives. If you want to be a laptop DJ and use other people’s iPods
in the mix, use a Mac laptop because it can access both types of iPods.
If you connected a Mac-formatted iPod to a Windows computer, you get a
warning message about reformatting it. Don’t do it! Click Cancel — otherwise,
you reformat the iPod and clear all music from it. Then click the Safely
Remove Hardware icon on the Windows taskbar to open the Safely Remove
Hardware window. Select the iPod and click Stop. Wait for the list of devices
in the Safely Remove Hardware window to be cleared. Then wait for your
iPod to display a message that it’s okay to disconnect (or until the iPod main
menu appears). You can then disconnect the iPod.
Using AirTunes for wireless 
stereo playback
You want to play the music in your iTunes library (or on your iPod connected
to your computer), but your stereo system is in another room, and you don’t
222
Part III: Playing Music 

want wires going from one room to the other. What you need is an AirPort in
your home — specifically, AirPort Express with AirTunes, which lets you play
your iTunes music through your stereo or powered speakers in virtually any
room of your house, without wires — as long as your computer is within
range of the AirPort Express Base Station.
AirPort is Apple’s technology that provides Wi-Fi wireless networking for any
AirPort-equipped Mac or PC that uses a Wi-Fi-certified IEEE 802.11b or 802.11g
wireless card or offers built-in Wi-Fi. For more about AirPort, see Mac OS X
Tiger All-In-One Desk Reference For Dummies, by Mark L. Chambers (Wiley). 
AirPort Express uses the fast 802.11g wireless standard to deliver data rates
up to 54 Mbps. It also works with the 802.11b wireless protocol, so that Macs
and PCs with older Wi-Fi configurations can connect wirelessly.
To use a stereo system or powered speakers with AirTunes, connect the
system or speakers to the audio port on the AirPort Express Base Station.
iTunes automatically detects the connection. 
If you already have a wireless network in place, you can add AirPort Express
and AirTunes without changing anything. Connect the AirPort Express Base
Station to the stereo system or powered speakers, and plug the Base Station
into an electrical outlet. The AirPort Express Base Station wirelessly links to
your existing wireless network without requiring any change to the network.
You can use several AirPort Express Base Stations — one for each stereo
system or set of powered speakers, in different rooms — and then choose
which stereo/speaker system to use in the pop-up menu.
To use AirTunes and the AirPort Express Base Station, follow these steps:
1. Install the software supplied on CD-ROM, which includes support for
AirTunes.
2. Connect your stereo or a set of powered speakers to the audio port of
the AirPort Express Base Station.
You can use an optical digital or analog audio cable. (Both are included
in the AirPort Express Stereo Connection Kit.) Which cable you use
depends on whether your stereo or set of powered speakers has an opti-
cal digital or analog connection.
3. Plug the AirPort Express Base Station into an electrical outlet.
Use the AC plug that came with the Base Station or the AirPort Express
power extension cord included in the AirPort Express Stereo Connection
Kit. The Base Station turns on automatically when connected to an elec-
trical outlet. (The Base Station doesn’t require a switch). The status light
glows yellow while AirPort Express is starting up. When it starts up com-
pletely, the light turns green.
223
Chapter 16: Spinning Tunes Like a DJ

4. On your computer, use iTunes to set your preferences to look for
speakers connected to your computer wirelessly using AirTunes.
Set your iTunes preferences to look for AirTunes speakers by choosing
Edit➪Preferences in Windows or iTunes➪Preferences on a Mac, and
click the Audio button. Select the “Look for remote speakers connected
with AirTunes” option in the Audio pane, as shown in Figure 16-12. 
In the Audio pane you can also disable the iTunes volume control for the
remote speakers to control those speakers separately (such as using
your amplifier’s volume control); leaving this unchecked enables you to
control the volume from iTunes.
5. Use iTunes to select the AirTunes-equipped network.
After turning on the option to look for AirTunes-connected speakers, a
Computer button appears in the lower-right corner of the iTunes window.
Clicking this button displays a pop-up menu with any available wireless
AirTunes networks, as shown in Figure 16-13. You can select the AirTunes
network to play music (“Little Net Buddy” in Figure 16-13). From that
point on, iTunes plays music through the AirTunes network rather than
the computer. To play music through speakers connected to the com-
puter (or through the computer’s built-in speakers), choose Computer
from the pop-up menu.

The AirPort Express Base Station is small enough to fit in the palm of your
hand — and it travels well because all it needs is a power outlet. You can take
your laptop and AirPort Express to a friend’s house or a party, connect the
Base Station to the stereo system, and then use your laptop anywhere in its
vicinity to play DJ. You can even use portable powered speakers wirelessly
in a hotel room, and use a hotel room’s wired LAN-to-Internet access with an
AirPort Express to connect your wireless computer and other wireless com-
puters in the room to the Internet.

 Choosing the appropriate encoder and import settings
A
s you discover more about digital audio technology, you find that you
have more decisions to make about your music library than you previ-
ously thought, and this chapter helps you make them. For example, you
might be tempted to trade quality for space — import music at average-
quality settings that allow you to put more songs on your hard drive and 
iPod than if you chose higher-quality settings. This might make you happy
today, but what about tomorrow, when iPods and hard drives double or 
triple in capacity?
On the other hand, you might be very picky about the sound quality, and
with an eye toward future generations of iPods and cheap hard drives, you
might decide to trade space for quality, importing music at the highest possi-
ble quality settings and then converting copies to lower-quality, space-saving
versions for iPods and other uses. Of course, you need more hard drive
space to accommodate the higher-quality versions.
This chapter explains which music encoding and compression formats to use
for higher quality and which to use for cramming more songs into your hard
drive space.
Trading Quality for Space
The encoding format and settings that you choose for importing music when
ripping a CD affect sound quality, iPod space, and hard drive space on your
computer. The format and settings might also affect the music files’ ability to
play on other types of players and computers.

The audio compression methods that are good at reducing space have to
throw away information. In technospeak, these methods are known as lossy
(as opposed to lossless) compression algorithms. For example, the AAC and
MP3 encoding formats compress the sound using lossy methods — the com-
pression algorithms reduce the sound quality by throwing away information
to make the file smaller, so you lose information and some quality in the
process. On the other hand, the Apple Lossless encoder compresses the
sound without any loss in quality or information, but the resulting file is only
a bit smaller than the uncompressed version — the main reason to use Apple
Lossless is to maintain quality for burning CDs while also playing the songs
on iPods. The AIFF and WAV encoders do not compress the sound and are the
best choices for burning CDs.
With lossy compression using MP3 or AAC, the amount of compression
depends on the bit rate that you choose, as well as the encoding format and
other options. The bit rate determines how many bits (of digital music infor-
mation) can travel during playback in a given second. Measured in kilobits
per second (Kbps), a higher bit rate, such as 320KB, offers higher quality
than a bit rate of 192KB because the sound is not compressed as much —
which means the resulting sound file is larger and takes up more iPod and
hard drive space.
Using more compression (a lower bit rate) means that the files are smaller,
and the sound quality is poorer. Using less compression (a higher bit rate)
means that the sound is higher in quality, but the files are larger. You can
trade quality for space and have more music of lower quality, or trade space
for quality and have less music of higher quality.
Also, power is an issue with the iPod. Playing larger files takes more power
because the hard drive inside the iPod has to refresh its memory buffers
more frequently to process information as the song plays — you might even
hear hiccups in the sound.
We prefer a higher-quality sound overall, and we typically don’t use the lower-
quality settings for encoders except for voice recordings and music recorded
in ancient times — before 1960. (Ancient recordings are already low in quality,
so you don’t hear that much of a difference when compressed.) We can hear
differences in music quality at the higher compression levels, and we prefer
going out and buying another hard drive to store more music if necessary.
Choosing an iTunes Encoder
Your iPod’s music software gives you a choice of encoders. This is perhaps
the most important choice to make before starting to rip music CDs and build
up your library. iTunes and MusicMatch Jukebox offer the same encoders —
with some differences. Here we leapfrog years of technospeak about digital
230
Part IV: Using Advanced Techniques 

music file formats and get right to the ones that you need to know about. If
you’re using MusicMatch, visit the companion Web site at www.dummies.
com/go/ipod.
Choose Preferences (from the iTunes menu on a Mac, or the Edit menu on a
Windows PC) and click the Importing tab to see the Importing Preferences
dialog. You can choose one of five encoders from the Import Using pop-up
menu:
 AAC Encoder: All your purchased music from the iTunes Music store
comes in this format. We recommend it for all uses except when ripping
your own CDs to burn new audio CDs. Technically known as MPEG-4
Advanced Audio Coding, AAC is a higher quality format than MP3 at the
same bit rate — meaning that AAC at 128 Kbps is higher quality than
MP3 at 128 Kbps. (MPEG stands for Moving Picture Experts Group, a
committee that recognizes compression standards for video and audio.)
We think it offers the best tradeoff of space and quality for iPod users,
and is especially useful for importing podcasts. (Read all about podcasts
in Chapter 21.) It’s suitable (though not as good as AIFF or Apple Lossless)
for burning to an audio CD, and it’s also excellent for playing on an iPod or
from a hard drive. However, as of this writing, only Apple supports AAC.
 AIFF Encoder: The Audio Interchange File Format (AIFF) is the standard
digital format for uncompressed sound on a Mac, and it provides the
highest quality digital representation of the sound. Like the WAV encoder
for Windows, the AIFF encoder uses a Mac-specific version of the original
Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) algorithm required for compliance with
audio CDs. Use AIFF if you plan to burn songs onto an audio CD or to edit
the songs with a digital sound-editing program. Mac-based sound-editing
programs import and export AIFF files, and you can edit and save in AIFF
format repeatedly with absolutely no loss in quality. The downside is
that AIFF files take up enormous amounts of hard drive and iPod space
because they’re uncompressed. Don’t use AIFF for songs that you want
to play on an iPod — use the Apple Lossless encoder instead.
 Apple Lossless Encoder: The Apple Lossless encoder is a compromise
between the lower-quality encoding of AAC or MP3 (which results in
lower file sizes) and the large file sizes of uncompressed, high-quality
AIFF or WAV audio. The Apple Lossless encoder provides CD quality
sound in a file size that’s about 60 to 70 percent of the size of an AIFF or
WAV encoded file. The virtue of this encoder is that you can use it for
songs that you intend to burn onto audio CDs and for playing on iPods —
the files are just small enough that they don’t hiccup on playback, but are
still much larger than their MP3 or AAC counterparts.
Using the Apple Lossless encoder is the most efficient method of storing
the highest-quality versions of your songs. You can burn the songs to
CDs without any quality loss and still play them on your iPod. You can’t
store as many songs on your iPod as with AAC or MP3, but the songs
that you do store have the highest-possible quality.
231
Chapter 17: Decoding Encoding

 MP3 Encoder: The MPEG-1, Layer 3 format, also known as MP3, is sup-
ported by most computers and some CD players. Use the MP3 format for
songs that you intend to use with other MP3 players besides your iPod
(which also plays MP3 songs, obviously), or use with applications that
support MP3, or to burn on an MP3 CD. (AIFF, WAV, or Apple Lossless
formats are better for regular audio CDs.) The MP3 format offers quite a
lot of different compression and quality settings, so you can fine-tune
the format to get better quality, sacrificing hard drive (and iPod) space
as you dial up the quality. Use the MP3 format for a song that you intend
to use with MP3 players, MP3 CDs, and applications that support MP3.
 WAV Encoder: Waveform Audio File Format (WAV) is a digital audio stan-
dard that Windows PCs can understand and manipulate. Like AIFF, WAV
is uncompressed and provides the highest quality digital representation
of the sound. Like the AIFF encoder for the Mac, the WAV encoder uses a
Windows-specific version of the original Pulse Code Modulation (PCM)
algorithm required for compliance with audio CDs. Use WAV if you plan
on burning the song to an audio CD or using the song with Windows-
based digital sound-editing programs, which import and export WAV
files (there is no difference between AIFF and WAV except that AIFF
works with Mac applications and WAV works with Windows applica-
tions). WAV files take up enormous amounts of hard drive and iPod
space because they’re uncompressed. Don’t use WAV for songs that you
want to play on an iPod — use the Apple Lossless encoder instead.
If you want to share your music with someone who uses an MP3 player other
than an iPod, you can import or convert songs with the MP3 encoder. As an
iPod user, you can use the higher-quality AAC encoder to produce files that
are either the same size as their MP3 counterparts but higher in quality, or at
the same quality but smaller in size.
232
Part IV: Using Advanced Techniques 
The past, present, and future of music
Our suggestions for encoders and importing
preferences for ripping CDs are based on our
own listening experiences and our preference
of the highest quality and the best use of com-
pression technology. You might be quite happy
with the results of using these suggestions, but
listening pleasure depends entirely on you and
the way the song itself was recorded. Some
people can hear qualitative differences that
others don’t hear or don’t care about. Some
people can also tolerate a lower-quality sound
in exchange for the convenience of carrying
more music on their iPods. And sometimes the
recording is so primitive-sounding that you can
get away with using lower-quality settings to
gain more hard drive space.
Just a century ago, people gathered at phonog-
raphy parties to rent a headset and listen to a

233
Chapter 17: Decoding Encoding
new invention called a phonograph, the prede-
cessor to the record player. Before records,
radio, and jukeboxes, these parties and live per-
formances were the only sources of music, and
the quality of the sound must have been crude
by today’s standards, but still quite enjoyable.
The choices of formats for sound have changed
considerably from the fragile 78 rpm records
from the phonography parties of the early 1900s
and the scratchy 45 rpm and 33 rpm records of
the 1940s through the 1980s to today’s CDs.
Consumers had to be on the alert then, as you
do now, for dead-end formats that could lock up
music in a cul-de-sac of technology, never to be
played again. You know what we’re talking
about — dead-end formats, such as the ill-fated
8-track cartridge or the legendary quadra-
phonic LP. You want your digital music to last
forever and play at high quality — not get stuck
with technology that doesn’t evolve with the
times.
Digital music has evolved beyond the commer-
cial audio CD, and computers haven’t yet
caught up to some of the latest audio formats.
For example, iTunes can’t yet import sound from
these formats:
 DVD-audio: DVD-audio is a relatively new
digital audio format developed from the
format for DVD video. DVD-audio is based
on PCM recording technology but offers
improved sound quality by using a higher
sampling frequency and longer word
lengths. Neither iTunes nor MusicMatch
Jukebox support the DVD-audio format, but
you can import a digital video file contain-
ing DVD-audio sound into iMovie, extract
the sound, and export the sound in AIFF or
WAV format, which you can use with
iTunes. You can also use Toast 6 Titanium
from Roxio (www.roxio.com) to import
and burn DVD-audio.
 Super Audio CD (SACD): Super Audio CD is
a new format developed from the past audio
format for CDs. The SACD format is based
on Direct Stream Digital (DSD) recording
technology that closely reproduces the
shape of the original analog waveforms to
produce a more natural, higher quality
sound. Originally developed for the digital
archiving of priceless analog masters
tapes, DSD is based on 1-bit sigma-delta
modulation, and operates with a sampling
frequency of 2.8224 MHz (64 times the 44.1
kHz used in audio CDs). Philips and Sony
adopted DSD as the basis for SACD, and the
format is growing in popularity among
audiophiles. However, neither iTunes nor
MusicMatch Jukebox support SACD. If you
buy music in the SACD format, choose the
hybrid format that offers a conventional CD
layer and a high-density SACD layer. You
can then import the music from the conven-
tional CD layer.
You might also want to take advantage of the
compression technology that squeezes more
music onto your iPod. Although the Apple-sup-
ported AAC format offers far better compres-
sion and quality than the MP3 format does (at
the same bit rates), the MP3 format is more uni-
versal, supported by other players and software
programs, as well as the iPod and iTunes.
Sticking with AAC or Apple Lossless as your
encoder might make you feel like your songs
are stuck inside iTunes with the MP3 blues
again. However, with iTunes and your iPod, you
can mix and match these formats as you please.

To have the best possible quality that you can get for future growth, and for
music editing, consider not using compression at all (as with AIFF or WAV), or
using Apple Lossless. You can import music at the highest possible quality —
by using the AIFF or WAV encoders or the Apple Lossless encoder — and burn
them to audio CDs; then convert the music files to a lesser-quality format for
use in the iPod or other devices. If you use Apple Lossless for songs, you can
use those songs on an iPod, but they take up much more space than AAC- or
MP3-encoded songs. We describe how to convert music in Chapter 18.
Manic Compression Has 
Captured Your Song
Every person hears the effects of compression differently. You might not hear
any problem with a compressed song that someone else says is tinny or lack-
ing in depth.
Too much compression can be a bad thing. Further compressing an already-
compressed music file — say, by converting a song — reduces the quality 
significantly. Not only that, but after your song is compressed, you can’t
uncompress the song back to its original quality. Your song is essentially
locked into that quality.
The lossy-style compression used by MP3 and AAC loses information each time
you use it, which means that if you compress something that has already been
compressed, you lose even more information. This is bad. Don’t compress
something that’s already compressed with a lossy method.
The Apple Lossless encoder doesn’t use a lossy method, which is why it’s
called lossless. This is also why it reduces sound files to only two-thirds of
their AIFF or WAV counterparts — which isn’t as useful for saving space as
the one-tenth compression that’s common with MP3 or AAC.
MP3 and AAC use two basic lossy methods to compress audio:
 Removing non-audible frequencies: For non-audible frequencies, the
compression removes what you supposedly can’t hear (although this
is a subject for eternal debate). For example, if a background singer’s
warble is totally drowned out by a rhythm guitar playing a chord, and
you can’t hear the singer due to the intensity of the guitar’s sound, the
compression algorithm loses the singer’s sound while maintaining the
guitar’s sound.
234
Part IV: Using Advanced Techniques 

 Removing less important signals: Within the spectrum of sound fre-
quencies, some frequencies are considered to be less important in terms
of rendering fidelity, and some frequencies most people can’t hear at all.
Removing specific frequencies is likely to be less damaging to your
music than other types of compression, depending on how you hear
things. In fact, your dog might stop getting agitated at songs that contain
ultra-high frequencies that only dogs can hear (such as the ending of
“Day in the Life” by the Beatles).
Selecting Import Settings
The AAC and MP3 formats compress sound at different quality settings.
iTunes and MusicMatch Jukebox let you set the bit rate for importing, which
determines the audio quality. You need to use a higher bit rate (such as 192
or 320 Kbps) for higher quality, which — all together now — increases the file
size. Again, if you’re using MusicMatch, visit the companion Web site at www.
dummies.com/go/ipod.
Variable Bit Rate (VBR) encoding is a technique that varies the number of bits
used to store the music depending on the complexity of the sound. Although
the quality of VBR is endlessly debated, it’s useful when set to the highest
setting because VBR can encode at up to the maximum bit rate of 320 Kbps in
those rare cases where the sound requires it, while keeping the majority of
the sound at a lower bit rate.
iTunes and MusicMatch Jukebox also let you control the sample rate during
importing, which is the number of times per second the sound waveform is
captured digitally (or sampled). Higher sample rates yield higher quality
sound and large file sizes. However, never use a higher sample rate than the
rate used for the source. CDs use a 44.100 kHz rate, so choosing a higher rate
is unnecessary unless you convert a song that was recorded from Digital
Audio Tape (DAT) or directly into the computer at a high sample rate, and
you want to keep that sample rate.
Another setting to consider during importing is the Channel choice. Stereo,
which offers two channels of music for left and right speakers, is the norm
for music. However, mono — monaural or single-channel — was the norm 
for pop records before the mid-1960s. (Phil Spector was known for his high-
quality monaural recordings, and the early Rolling Stones records are in
mono.) Monaural recordings take up half the space of stereo recordings when
digitized. Most likely, you want to keep stereo recordings in stereo, and mono
recordings in mono.

In This Chapter
 Changing your importing preferences in iTunes
 Changing settings for the AAC, MP3, AIFF, and WAV encoders in iTunes
 Converting songs to a different encoding format in iTunes
You might want to change your import settings before ripping CDs, depend-
ing on the type of music, the source of the recording, or other factors,
such as whether you plan to copy the songs to your iPod or burn an audio or
MP3 CD. The encoders offer general quality settings, but you can also cus-
tomize the encoders and change those settings to your liking. 
Whether you use iTunes or MusicMatch Jukebox, the software remembers
your custom settings until you change them again. (If you’re using MusicMatch,
visit the companion Web site at www.dummies.com/go/ipod.)
This chapter provides the nuts-and-bolts details on changing your import set-
tings to customize each type of encoder, importing sounds other than music,
and converting songs from one format to another. With the choice of settings
for music encoders, you can impress your audiophile friends — even ones
who doubted that your computer could reproduce magnificent music.
You can also convert songs to another format as described in “Converting
Songs to a Different Encoder in iTunes” later in this chapter. However, you
can’t convert songs that you buy from the iTunes Music Store to another file
format because they’re encoded as protected AAC files. If you could, they
wouldn’t be protected, would they? You also can’t convert Audible books and
spoken-word content to another format. (However, you can burn them to an
audio CD and re-import them, which might cause a noticeable drop in quality.)

Customizing the Encoder 
Settings in iTunes
To change your encoder and quality settings and other importing preferences
before ripping an audio CD or converting a file in iTunes, follow these steps:
1. Choose iTunes➪Preferences on a Mac, or Edit➪Preferences on a
Windows PC, and then click the Importing tab.
The Importing Preferences dialog appears, allowing you to make changes
to the encoding format and its settings.
2. Choose the encoding format that you want to convert the song into
and select the settings for that format.
The pop-up menus help you make your changes. The Setting pop-up
menu offers different settings depending on your choice of encoder in
the Import Using pop-up menu. See the sections on each encoding
format later in this chapter for details on settings.
3. Click OK to accept changes.
After changing your importing preferences, and until you change them
again, iTunes uses these preferences whenever it imports or converts
songs.
The AAC, MP3, AIFF, and WAV encoders let you customize the settings for
the encoders. The Apple Lossless encoder is automatic and offers no custom
settings to change.
Changing AAC encoder settings
We recommend using the AAC encoder for everything except music that you
intend to burn on an audio CD; AAC offers the best trade-off of space and
quality for hard drives and iPods.
The Setting pop-up menu for the AAC encoder offers three choices: High
Quality, Podcast, and Custom, as shown in Figure 18-1. The Podcast setting is
useful for converting audio recordings exported from GarageBand or a simi-
lar audio editing application into iTunes. (For more information about pod-
casts, see Chapter 21.) We recommend using the High Quality setting for
most music you rip from CDs, but for very intense music (such as complex
jazz or classical music, recordings with lots of instruments, or your most
favorite songs), you might want to fine-tune the settings. To customize your
AAC encoder settings, select the Custom option from the Setting pop-up
menu to see the AAC Encoder dialog, as shown in Figure 18-2.
238
Part IV: Using Advanced Techniques 

The custom settings for AAC (see Figure 18-2) allow you to change the 
following:
 Stereo Bit Rate: This pop-up menu allows you to select the bit rate,
which is measured in kilobits per second (Kbps). Use a higher bit rate
for higher quality, which also increases the file size. 320 Kbps is the 
highest-quality setting for this format; 128 is considered high quality.
 Sample Rate: This pop-up menu enables you to select the sample rate,
which is the number of times per second the sound waveform is cap-
tured digitally (or sampled). Higher sample rates yield higher quality
sound and larger file sizes. However, never use a higher sample rate than
the rate used for the source. CDs use a 44.100 kHz rate.
 Channels: This pop-up menu enables you to choose how you want the
music to play through speakers — in stereo or mono. Stereo offers two
channels of music for left and right speakers, and mono offers only one
channel but takes up half the space of stereo recordings when digitized.
If the recording is in stereo, don’t choose mono because you will lose
part of the sound (you might lose vocals or guitar riffs, depending on the
recording). Select the Auto setting to have iTunes use the appropriate
setting for the music.
 Optimize for Voice: This option filters the sound to favor the human
voice. Podcasters can use this option, along with the AAC encoder, to
convert audio recordings into a podcast format optimal for iTunes.
We recommend selecting the highest bit rate in the Stereo Bit Rate pop-up
menu and leaving the other two pop-up menus set to Auto.

Chapter 18: Changing Encoders and Encoder Settings

Changing MP3 encoder settings
We prefer using the AAC encoder for music that we play on our iPods, but as
of this writing, other MP3 players don’t support AAC. The iPod supports both
AAC and MP3 formats. You might want to use the MP3 encoder for other rea-
sons, such as acquiring more control over the compression parameters and
gaining compatibility with other applications and players that support MP3.
The MP3 encoder offers four choices for the Setting pop-up menu in the
Importing Preferences dialog:
 Good Quality (128 Kbps): This is certainly fine for audio books, comedy
records, and old scratchy records. You might even want to use a lower
bit rate for voice recordings.
 High Quality (160 Kbps): Most people consider this high enough for
most popular music, but we go higher with our music.
 Higher Quality (192 Kbps): This one’s high enough for just about all
types of music.
 Custom: To fine-tune the MP3 encoder settings, select the Custom set-
ting. Customizing your MP3 settings increases the quality of the sound
and keeps file size low.
The MP3 encoder offers a bunch of choices in its custom settings dialog (see
Figure 18-3):
 Stereo Bit Rate: This pop-up menu’s choices are measured in kilobits
per second; select a higher bit rate for higher quality, which increases
the file size. The most common bit rate for MP3 files you find on the Web
is 128 Kbps. Lower bit rates are more appropriate for voice recordings
or sound effects.

240
Part IV: Using Advanced Techniques 

We recommend at least 192 Kbps for most music, and we use 320 Kbps,
the maximum setting, for songs that we play on our iPods.
 Use Variable Bit Rate Encoding (VBR): This option helps keep file size
down, but quality might be affected. VBR varies the number of bits used
to store the music depending on the complexity of the sound. If you
select the Highest setting from the Quality pop-up menu for VBR, iTunes
encodes at up to the maximum bit rate of 320 Kbps in sections of songs
where the sound is complex enough to require a high bit rate. Meanwhile,
iTunes keeps the rest of the song at a lower bit rate to save file space.
The lower limit is set by the rate that you select in the Stereo Bit Rate
pop-up menu.
Some audiophiles swear by VBR, but others don’t ever use it. We use it
only when importing at low bit rates, and we set VBR to its highest qual-
ity setting.
Although your iPod plays VBR-encoded MP3 music, other MP3 players
might not support VBR.
 Sample Rate: This pop-up menu enables you to select the sample rate
(the number of times per second that the sound waveform is captured
digitally). Higher sample rates yield higher quality sound and larger file
sizes. However, never use a higher sample rate than the rate used for the
source — CDs use a 44.100 kHz rate.
 Channels: This pop-up menu enables you to choose how you want the
music to play through speakers; in stereo or mono. Stereo, which offers
two channels of music for left and right speakers, is the norm for music.
Monaural (mono) recordings take up half the space of stereo recordings
when digitized. Choose the Auto setting to have iTunes use the appropri-
ate setting for the music.
 Stereo mode: This pop-up menu enables you to select Normal or Joint
Stereo. Normal mode is just what you think it is — normal stereo. Select
the Joint Stereo setting to make the file smaller by removing information
that’s identical in both channels of a stereo recording, using only one
channel for that information while the other channel carries unique
information. At bit rates of 128 Kbps and below, this mode can actually
improve the sound quality. However, we typically don’t use the Joint
Stereo mode when using a high-quality bit rate.
 Smart Encoding Adjustments: This option, when selected, tells iTunes
to analyze your MP3 encoding settings and music source and to change
your settings as needed to maximize the quality of the encoded files.
 Filter Frequencies Below 10 Hz: This option, when selected, filters out
low frequency sounds. Frequencies below 10 Hz are hard to hear, and
most people don’t notice if they’re missing. Filtering inaudible frequen-
cies helps reduce the file size with little or no perceived loss in quality.
However, we think selecting this option and removing the low-frequency
sounds detracts from the overall feeling of the music, and we prefer not
to filter frequencies.
241
Chapter 18: Changing Encoders and Encoder Settings

Changing AIFF and WAV encoder settings
We recommend that you use the AIFF, WAV, or Apple Lossless encoders for
songs from audio CDs if you intend to burn your own audio CDs with the
music. You get the best possible quality with these encoders because the
music isn’t compressed with a lossy algorithm. The Apple Lossless encoder
(which is automatic and offers no settings to change) reduces file size to
about 60–70 percent of the size of AIFF or WAV versions. However, AIFF or
WAV files are preferable for use with digital sound-editing programs, and they
offer settings that you can change, such as the number of channels (Stereo or
Mono) and the sampling rate.
The AIFF and WAV formats have technical differences, but the only major 
difference in storing and playing music is that AIFF is the standard for Mac
applications and computers, and WAV is the standard for PC applications and
computers.
You can import music with AIFF or WAV at the highest possible quality and
then convert the music files to a lesser-quality format for use in your iPod.
AIFF and WAV files take up huge amounts of hard drive space (about 10MB
per minute), and although you can play them on your iPod, they take up way
too much space and battery power to be convenient for anyone but the most
discerning audiophile who can afford multiple iPods. You can handle these
large files by adding another hard drive or by backing up portions of your
music library onto other media, such as a DVD-R (which can hold 4.7GB).
However, if multiple hard drives and backup scenarios sound like unwanted
hassles, use the AAC or MP3 encoders to compress files so that they take up
less space on your hard drive.
Figure 18-3:
Customize
the settings
for the MP3
encoder.
242
Part IV: Using Advanced Techniques 

The AIFF encoder and the WAV encoder offer similar custom settings dialogs;
the AIFF Encoder dialog is shown in Figure 18-4. The pop-up menus offer set-
tings for Sample Rate, Sample Size, and Channels. You can select the Auto 
setting for all three pop-up menus, and iTunes automatically detects the proper
sample rate, size, and channels from the source. If you select a specific setting,
such as the Stereo setting in the Channels pop-up menu, iTunes imports the
music in stereo, regardless of the source. Audio CDs typically sample at a rate
of 44.1000 kHz, with a sample size of 16 bits, and with stereo channels.
The Sample Rate pop-up menu for AIFF and WAV offers more choices than for
AAC, down to a very low sample rate of 8.000 kHz, which is suitable only for
voice recordings. 
Importing Audio Books and
Voice Recordings in iTunes
Audio books are available from Audible (www.audible.com) and from the
iTunes store in a special format that doesn’t require any further compression,
but you can also import audio books, spoken-word titles, comedy CDs, and
other voice recordings in the MP3 format.
If the recording has any music at all or requires close listening to stereo chan-
nels (such as a Firesign Theatre or Monty Python CD), treat the entire record-
ing as music and skip this section. (“Nudge-nudge, wink-wink. Sorry! Everything
you know is wrong!”)

Chapter 18: Changing Encoders and Encoder Settings

By fine-tuning the import settings for voice recordings and sound effects, you
can save a significant amount of space without reducing quality. We recom-
mend the following settings depending on your choice of encoder:
 AAC encoder: AAC allows you to get away with an even lower bit rate
than MP3 to achieve the same quality, thereby saving more space. We
recommend a bit rate as low as 80 Kbps for sound effects and voice
recordings. Use the Optimize for Voice option to filter the sound to favor
the human voice.
 MP3 encoder: Use a low bit rate (such as 96 Kbps). You might also
want to reduce the sample rate to 22.050 kHz for voice recordings. Filter
frequencies below 10 Hz because voice recordings don’t need such 
frequencies.
Converting Songs to a Different
Encoder Format in iTunes
Converting a song from one format to another is useful if you want to use
one format for one purpose, such as burning a CD, and a second format for
another task, such as playing on your iPod. It’s also useful for converting
uncompressed songs or podcasts that were created in GarageBand (or a simi-
lar audio editing application) and exported or copied to iTunes.
Converting a song from one compressed format to another is possible (say
from AAC to MP3), but you might not like the results. When you convert a
compressed file to another compressed format, iTunes compresses the music
twice, reducing the quality of the sound. You get the best results by starting
with an uncompressed song that was imported using either the AIFF or WAV
format, and then converting that song to the compressed AAC or MP3 format.
You can tell what format a song is in by selecting it and choosing File➪Get
Info. Then click the Summary tab to see the song’s format. You might want
to keep track of formats by creating CD-AIFF-version and iPod-MP3-version
playlists for different formats.
To convert a song to another encoding format, follow these steps:
1. Choose iTunes➪Preferences on a Mac, or choose Edit➪Preferences on
a Windows PC, and then click the Importing tab.
The Importing Preferences dialog appears, allowing you to make changes
to the encoding format and its settings.
244
Part IV: Using Advanced Techniques 

2. Select the encoding format that you want to convert the song into 
from the Import Using pop-up menu; in the custom settings dialog that
appears, select the settings for that encoder.
For example, if you’re converting songs in the AIFF format to the MP3
format, choose MP3 Encoder from the Import Using pop-up menu, and
then select the settings that you want in the MP3 Encoder dialog that
appears.
3. Click OK to accept the settings for your chosen format.
4. In the iTunes window, select the song(s) that you want to convert, and
then choose Advanced➪Convert Selection.
The encoding format that you chose in Step 2 appears on the menu:
Convert Selection to MP3, Convert Selection to AAC, Convert Selection to
AIFF, or Convert Selection to WAV. Choose the appropriate menu opera-
tion to perform the conversion. When the conversion is complete, the
newly converted version of the song appears in your iTunes library (with
the same artist name and song name, so it’s easy to find). iTunes doesn’t
delete the original version — both are stored in your music library.
If you convert songs obtained from the Internet, you may find MP3 songs with
bit rates as low as 128 Kbps, and choosing a higher stereo bit rate doesn’t
improve the quality — it only wastes space.
The automatic copy-and-convert operation can be useful for converting an
entire music library to another format — hold down the Option key on a Mac,
or the Alt key in Windows, and choose Advanced➪Convert Selection, and all
the songs copy and convert automatically. If you have a library of AIFF tunes,
you can quickly copy and convert them to AAC or MP3 in one step, and then
assign the AIFF songs to the AIFF-associated playlists for burning CDs, and MP3
or AAC songs to MP3 or AAC playlists that you intend to copy to your iPod.

 Using the iPod equalizer
 Using iTunes equalizer presets in your iPod 
S
ound is difficult to describe. Harder still to describe is how to adjust
sound to your liking. Maybe you want more oomph in the lows, or you
prefer highs that are as clear as a bell. Even if you’ve never mastered a stereo
system beyond adjusting the bass and treble controls, the volume control,
and the loudness button, you can use this limited knowledge of sound to
quickly fine-tune the sound in iTunes, as we show in this chapter.
If you are a discerning listener, you might want to change the equalizer set-
tings in iTunes and perhaps even use different settings for different songs.
With iTunes, you have to change those settings only once. This chapter
shows you how to make presets for each song in your library so that iTunes
remembers them. What’s more, you can use the iTunes settings on your iPod,
which also offers an equalizer. This chapter shows you how.
Adjusting the Sound in iTunes
Some songs are just too loud. We don’t mean too loud stylistically, as in
thrash metal with screeching guitars; we mean too loud for your ears when
you’re wearing headphones or so loud that the music sounds distorted in
your speakers. And some songs are just too soft, and you have to turn up the
volume to hear them, then turn it down to hear other songs. Is there a way to
set the volume in advance for a certain song or album? 
Of course there is — you can set the overall volume in advance in the song
information dialog by choosing File➪Get Info. You can also make all the songs
in your library play at the same volume by leveling the volume with the Sound
Check option.

You can change the volume level at any time by sliding the volume slider in
the upper-left section of the iTunes window. The maximum volume of the
iTunes volume slider is the maximum set for the computer’s sound in the
Sound pane of System Preferences, as we describe in Chapter 16.
Setting the volume in advance for songs
With songs that you already know are too loud (or too soft), consider setting
the volume for those songs (or certain albums) in advance, so that they always
play with that volume adjustment.
To adjust the overall volume of a particular song in advance, so that it always
plays at that setting, perform the following steps:
1. Click a song to select it.
2. Choose File➪Get Info. 
The song information dialog appears.
3. Click the Options tab.
Drag the Volume Adjustment slider left or right to adjust the volume
lower or higher, as shown in Figure 19-1. You can do this while playing
the song.
Figure 19-1:
Adjust the

248
Part IV: Using Advanced Techniques 

To set the volume for more than one song at once, you can select an entire
album in iTunes Browse view or select multiple songs; then choose Get Info
to open the Multiple Song Information dialog. The Volume Adjustment slider
appears on the bottom-right corner of the dialog. Drag the slider as described
earlier to set the volume adjustment for the entire album of songs or the
selected songs.
Enhancing the sound
Audiophiles and sound purists frown on it, but many of you probably use the
loudness button on home or car stereos to enhance the sound. iTunes offers
a similar option — Sound Enhancer — that improves the depth of the sound
by enhancing the high and low frequencies. Audiophiles and sound purists
would most likely use the equalizer to boost frequencies, but you can use
this brute force method to enhance the sound.
To turn on Sound Enhancer, choose Preferences (from the iTunes menu on a
Mac/Edit menu on a Windows PC). Click the Audio button to show the Audio
dialog, as shown in Figure 19-2.
To increase the sound enhancement (boosting the high and low frequencies),
drag the Sound Enhancer slider to the right toward the High setting. This is
similar to pressing the loudness button on a stereo or the equivalent of boost-
ing the treble (high) and bass (low) frequencies in the equalizer (described in
Figure 19-2:
Use Sound
Enhancer
and Sound
Check
options in
the Audio
preferences.
249
Chapter 19: Fine-Tuning the Sound

“Equalize It in iTunes,” later in this chapter). To decrease the high and low 
frequencies, drag the slider to the left toward the Low setting. The middle set-
ting is neutral, adding no enhancement — the same as turning off the Sound
Enhancer by clearing its check box.
Sound-checking the iTunes volume
Because music CDs are mastered differently, there can be discrepancies in
volume between them. Some CDs play more loudly than others; occasionally,
individual tracks within a CD are louder than others.
You can standardize the volume level of all the songs in your iTunes music
library with the Sound Check option. Hey, musicians do a sound check before
every performance to check the volume of microphones and instruments and
its effect on the listening environment. The aptly named Sound Check option
in iTunes allows you to do a sound check on your tunes to bring them all in
line, volume-wise. This option has the added benefit of applying the same
volume adjustment when you play the songs back on your iPod, as described
in the upcoming section, “Sound-checking the iPod volume.” However, be pre-
pared for the sound check operation to take a bit of time, perhaps even sev-
eral hours for a very large music library.
To ensure that all the songs in your library ripped from CDs play at the same
volume level, follow these steps:
1. Drag the iTunes volume slider to set the overall volume for iTunes.
The volume slider is in the top-left corner of the iTunes window, under
the Play button.
2. Choose iTunes➪Preferences on a Mac/Edit➪Preferences on a
Windows PC.
The Preferences dialog appears.
3. Click the Audio button.
The Audio preferences dialog appears; refer to Figure 19-2.
4. Select the Sound Check check box.
iTunes sets the volume level for all songs according to the level of the
iTunes volume slider.
5. Click OK.
The Sound Check option sets a volume adjustment based on the volume
slider on all the songs so that they play at approximately the same
volume.
250
Part IV: Using Advanced Techniques 

Sound-checking the iPod volume
You can take advantage of volume leveling in your iTunes music library with
the Sound Check option, and then turn Sound Check on or off on your iPod
by choosing Sound Check in the iPod Settings menu.
This is useful especially when using your iPod in a car (or when jogging while
listening to headphones) because you don’t want to have to reach for the
volume on the iPod or on the car stereo every time a song comes on that’s
too loud. However, the Sound Check option on your iPod works only if you’ve
also set the Sound Check option in your iTunes library. (Audio purists frown
on volume leveling as much as they frown on sound enhancement, preferring
to adjust the volume only when they need to.)
In iTunes, select the Sound Check option as described in the preceding section,
“Sound-checking the iTunes volume.” Then, on the iPod, choose Settings➪
Sound Check➪On from the main menu to turn on the Sound Check feature. To
turn it off, choose Settings➪Sound Check➪Off.
Equalize It in iTunes
The iTunes equalizer (EQ) allows you to fine-tune the specific sound spec-
trum frequencies in a more precise way than with the typical bass and treble
controls you find on home stereos and powered speakers. (See the sidebar
on equalizers, later in this chapter.) You can use the equalizer to improve or
enhance the sound coming through a particular stereo system and speakers.
With the equalizer settings, you can customize playback for different musical
genres, listening environments, or speakers.
You might want to pick entirely different equalizer settings for car speakers,
home speakers, and headphones. Fortunately, you can save your settings, as
described in the upcoming “Saving your own presets” section.
To see the iTunes equalizer, click the Equalizer button, which is the icon with
three mixer faders on the bottom-right side of the iTunes window. (On a Mac,
you can also choose Window➪Equalizer.)
Adjusting the preamp volume
The preamp in your stereo is the component that offers a volume control that
applies to all frequencies equally.
251
Chapter 19: Fine-Tuning the Sound

Volume knobs generally go up to 10 — except, of course, for Spinal Tap’s pre-
amps, which go to 11.
The iTunes equalizer, as shown in Figure 19-3, offers a Preamp slider on the
far-left side. You can increase or decrease the volume in 3-decibel (dB) incre-
ments up to 12 dB. Decibels are units that measure the intensity (or volume)
of the frequencies. You can adjust the volume while playing the music to hear
the result right away.

What’s the frequency, Kenneth? 
The Equalizer opportunity
The Beach Boys were right when they sang
“Good Vibrations” because that’s what music 
is — the sensation of hearing audible vibrations
conveyed to the ear by a medium such as air.
The frequency of vibrations per second is how
we measure pitch. The waves can oscillate
slowly and produce low-pitched sounds, or they
can oscillate rapidly and produce high-pitched
sounds. The amplitude is a measurement of the
amount of fluctuation in air pressure — there-
fore, amplitude is perceived as loudness.
When you turn up the bass or treble on a stereo
system, you are actually increasing the volume,
or intensity, of certain frequencies while the
music is playing. The equalizer lets you fine-tune
the sound spectrum frequencies in a more pre-
cise way than with bass and treble controls. It
increases or decreases specific frequencies of
the sound to raise or lower highs, lows, and
midrange tones. The equalizer does this with
several band-pass filters all centered at different
frequencies, and each filter offers controllable
gain (the ability to boost the volume).
On more sophisticated stereo systems, an
equalizer with a bar graph display replaces the
bass and treble controls. An equalizer (EQ in
audio-speak) enables you to fine-tune the spe-
cific sound spectrum frequencies, which gives
you far greater control than merely adjusting
the bass or treble controls.

You might want to increase the preamp volume for songs recorded too softly,
or decrease it for songs that are so loud you can hear distortion. If you want
to make any adjustments to frequencies, you might need to adjust the preamp
volume first if volume adjustment is needed, and then move on to the specific
frequencies.
Adjusting frequencies
You can adjust frequencies in the iTunes equalizer by clicking and dragging
sliders that look like mixing-board faders.
The horizontal values across the equalizer represent the spectrum of human
hearing. The deepest frequency (“Daddy sang bass”) is 32 hertz (Hz); the
midrange frequencies are 250 Hz and 500 Hz, and the higher frequencies go
from 1 kilohertz (kHz) to 16 kHz (treble).
The vertical values on each bar represent decibels, which measure the inten-
sity of each frequency. Increase or decrease the frequencies at 3 dB incre-
ments by clicking and dragging the sliders up and down. You can drag the
sliders to adjust the frequencies while the music is playing, to hear the effect
immediately.
Using iTunes’ presets
iTunes offers presets, which are equalizer settings made in advance and saved
by name. You can quickly switch settings without having to make changes to
each frequency slider. iTunes comes with more than 20 presets of the most
commonly used equalizer settings, for each musical genre from classical to
rock. You can then assign the equalizer settings to a specific song or set of
songs in your iTunes library.
These settings copy to your iPod along with the songs when you update
your iPod.
To use an equalizer preset, click the pop-up menu in the Equalizer window at
the top of the equalizer, as shown in Figure 19-4, to select a preset. If a song is
playing, you hear the effect in the sound immediately after choosing the preset.
253
Chapter 19: Fine-Tuning the Sound

Saving your own presets
Don’t settle for Apple’s presets — you can create your own equalizer presets.
When you make the changes that you want to the frequencies, the pop-up
menu automatically switches to Manual when you drag the sliders to change
the frequencies. Then choose the Make Preset option from the pop-up menu
(refer to Figure 19-4) to save your changes. The Make Preset dialog appears,
as shown in Figure 19-5. Give your new preset a descriptive name. The name
appears in the pop-up menu from that point on — your very own preset.
You can rename or delete the presets by choosing the Edit List option from
the pop-up menu, which displays the Edit Presets dialog for renaming or
deleting presets, as shown in Figure 19-6. Click Rename to rename a preset,
click Delete to delete a preset, and click Done when you’re finished editing
the list.

Part IV: Using Advanced Techniques 

You can rename or delete any preset, including the ones supplied with iTunes
(which is useful if you want to recall a preset by another name).
Assigning equalizer presets to songs
One reason why you go to the trouble of setting equalizer presets is to assign
the presets to individual songs. The next time you play the song, it will use
the equalizer preset that you assigned.
When you transfer the songs to your iPod, the preset assignments stay
assigned to them, and you can choose whether to use the preset assignments
when playing the songs on your iPod.
Assign an equalizer preset to a song or set of songs by following these steps:
1. Choose Edit➪View Options.
The View Options dialog appears, as shown in Figure 19-7.

2. Select the Equalizer check box and then click OK.
The Equalizer column appears in the song list in the iTunes window.
You can combine Steps 1 and 2 by Control-clicking any song list column
heading on a Mac (or right-clicking on a Windows PC), and then choos-
ing Equalizer from the shortcut menu that appears.
3. Locate a song in the song list and scroll the song list horizontally to
see the Equalizer column, as shown in Figure 19-8.
4. Choose a preset from the pop-up menu in the Equalizer column.
The Equalizer column has a tiny pop-up menu that allows you to assign
any preset to a song.
When you transfer songs with presets to the iPod, the presets can be used for
song playback using the iPod equalizer.
Equalize It in Your iPod
You leave the back-road bliss of the country to get on the freeway, and now
the music in your car doesn’t have enough bass to give you that thumping
rhythm you need to dodge other cars. What can you do? Without endanger-
ing anybody, you can pull over and select one of the iPod equalizer presets,
such as Bass Booster.

Part IV: Using Advanced Techniques 

Yes, your iPod also has a built-in equalizer. Like the iTunes equalizer, the iPod
built-in equalizer modifies the volume of the frequencies of the sound. And
although you don’t have sliders for faders like the iTunes equalizer, you do
get the same long list of presets to suit the type of music or the type of envi-
ronment. You can use the iPod equalizer for on-the-fly adjustments.
The iPod equalizer uses a bit more battery power when it is turned on, so
you might have less playing time on your iPod battery.
You can also use the iTunes equalizer to improve or enhance the sound,
assigning presets to each song and then updating your iPod.
Choosing an EQ preset on your iPod
To select an iPod equalizer preset, choose Settings from the main menu and
then choose EQ from the Settings menu. The EQ is set to Off until you select
one of the presets.
Each EQ preset offers a different balance of frequencies designed to enhance
the sound in certain ways. For example, Bass Booster increases the volume of
the low (bass) frequencies; Treble Booster does the same to the high (treble)
frequencies.
To see what a preset actually does to the frequencies, open the iTunes equal-
izer and select the same preset. The faders in the equalizer display show you
exactly what the preset does.
The Off setting turns off the iPod equalizer — no presets are used, not even
one you assigned in iTunes. You have to choose an EQ preset to turn on the
iPod equalizer.
Applying the iTunes EQ presets
When you assign a preset to the song using iTunes, the iPod uses the assigned
EQ preset from iTunes even when you choose an EQ preset on the iPod. That’s
right — the assigned EQ preset from iTunes takes precedence over the preset
in the iPod.
257
Chapter 19: Fine-Tuning the Sound

Here’s a workaround, though. If you know in advance that you need to use
specific presets for certain songs, assign presets to the songs in iTunes
before copying the songs to the iPod. If, on the other hand, you don’t want
the songs fixed to use a certain preset, don’t assign presets to the songs in
iTunes. You can then experiment with the presets in the iPod to get better
playback in different listening environments.
To assign built-in or custom presets to songs with the iTunes equalizer, see
“Assigning equalizer presets to songs,” earlier in this chapter.
After assigning a preset to a song in iTunes, you turn on the iPod equalizer by
choosing any EQ setting (other than Off), and the iPod uses the song’s preset
for playback.

Recording and Editing Sound
In This Chapter
 Recording cassettes, vinyl records, and other analog sources of sound
 Choosing a Macintosh or Windows application to record and edit sound
 Defining start and stop times for a song
 Separating a long track into separate tracks in iTunes
You can find millions of songs on the Internet, and some digital record-
ings of songs might even be good enough to please audiophiles. With so
many songs available in the iTunes Music Store, you might not want to spend
a lot of time recording and digitizing the hits from your record collection, or
even the B-sides and album cuts. Most likely those songs are also available
from the online store in digital form, ready to play.
However, you might have sounds that were never released on CD or made
available to the public. Rare record collectors and tape archivists — you know
who you are — have recordings that you just can’t find on the Internet or on
CD, and if you create your own music, how do you get that stuff into your
iTunes library so that you can burn a CD or include the songs on your iPod?
This chapter explains what you need to record and digitize sounds from
other sources, such as tape players and turntables, and store the digital
recordings in your iTunes library. It also shows you how to set the start and
stop times of songs in your iTunes library, which is a trick you can use to edit
the beginnings and endings of songs.
All the applications described in this chapter are commercially available for
downloading from the Internet. Some are free to use, some are free for a limited
time before you have to pay, and some require cash up front. Nevertheless, all
are worth checking out if you have sounds you want to put into iTunes.

Recording Records, Tapes, 
and Analog Sources
Sound can be brought directly into your computer from a sound system or
home stereo that offers a stereo audio output connection (such as Tape Out),
or even directly from a cassette player or microphone. If you have old vinyl
records with music that can’t be found anymore, on CD or otherwise, you can
convert the music to digital by using a phonograph connected to a stereo
system with a Tape Out connection.
Songs already converted to digital can be copied into iTunes directly without
any recording procedure. For example, MP3 CDs are easy to import. Because
they’re essentially data CDs, simply insert them into your CD-ROM drive,
open the CD in Windows or the Mac Finder, and drag and drop the MP3 song
files into the iTunes window, as we describe in Chapter 5. Downloaded song
files are even easier — just drag and drop the files into iTunes. If you drag a
folder or CD icon, all the audio files that it contains are added to your iTunes
library.
Before recording sound into your computer, be sure that you have enough
disk space to record the audio in an uncompressed form (which is best for
highest quality). If you’re recording an hour of high-quality music, you need
about 600MB of disk space to record it.
Connecting and setting up audio input
Most computers offer a Line In connection that accepts a cable with a stereo
mini-plug. You can connect any kind of mono or stereo audio source, such as
an amplifier or preamp, a CD or DVD player, or an all-in-one stereo system
that offers recording through a Tape Out or similar connection.
Find the Line Out or Tape Out connection in your stereo system, and connect
a cable that uses RCA-type left and right stereo plugs or a stereo mini-plug to
this connection. See Chapter 14 for more information about audio cables.
Connect the stereo mini-plug to your computer’s Line In connection. You can
then record anything that plays on your home stereo into your computer.
If your computer doesn’t offer a Line In connection, you can purchase a
Universal Serial Bus (USB) audio input device, such as the Griffin iMic (www.
griffintechnology.com). 
260
Part IV: Using Advanced Techniques 

When recording from a phonograph (turntable for vinyl records), the phono-
graph must either include an amplifier or be connected to an amplifier in
order to raise the signal to line levels and apply proper equalization curves.
After connecting the audio source to your computer, set the audio input for
your computer and adjust the volume for recording.
On a Mac, follow these steps:
1. Choose System Preferences from the Apple menu or the Dock, and
then click the Sound icon.
2. Click the Input tab.
The Input tab displays the sound input preferences, as shown in
Figure 20-1.
3. Choose Line In from the list of input devices.
Use Line In to record into your computer. The alternative is to use the
built-in microphone, which is useful for recording live performances —
but not for records or tapes because it also picks up any noise in the
room.
4. Adjust the volume for the Line In input.
To set the volume level for sound input, start playing the record, tape, or
source of sound. As it plays, watch the input level meter. As the volume

261
Chapter 20: Recording and Editing Sound

gets louder, the oblong purple dots seem to light up with highlights, from
left to right. To adjust the volume, drag the slider underneath the input
level meter. If all the dots are highlighted all the time, you’re way too hot
(studio tech talk for being too loud). If the dots are not highlighted at all,
you’re way too low. (For some reason, the studio techs don’t say cool or
cold — just low.) You want the dots to be highlighted about three-fourths
of the way across from left to right for optimal input volume.
5. Quit System Preferences by choosing System Preferences➪Quit
System Preferences, or by clicking the red button in the top-left
corner of the window.
On a Windows PC, you must have a Line In connection and an audio card driver
that controls it. Some PCs are equipped only with microphone-controlling dri-
vers, and some offer both Line In and microphone input. If you have the appro-
priate hardware, follow these steps:
1. Open the sound properties control panel.
In Windows XP, select Control Panel from the Start menu, and click
the Sounds and Audio Devices icon. The Sounds and Audio Devices
Properties window appears. Depending on your version of Windows, you
might have a Control Panel specific for the audio driver and hardware,
or Windows Mixer, or the Sound and Audio Devices control panel. You
can open the appropriate control program by right-clicking the small
speaker icon in your system tray, and choosing Adjust Audio Properties.
In Windows Mixer, choose Options➪Properties.
2. Click the Audio tab in the row of tabs along the top of the window.
As shown in Figure 20-2, the Sounds and Audio Devices Properties
window offers sections for sound playback, sound recording, and MIDI
(Musical Instrument Digital Interface) music playback.
3. Choose the input device for sound recording.
Use the drop-down list in the Sound recording section to choose the
input device, which is the hardware for controlling the Line In connec-
tion or microphone. In Windows Mixer, select Recording under Adjust
volume and then turn on the option for Line-In or Microphone to get to
the Recording Control panel.
4. Click the Volume button in the Sound recording section to set the
input volume.
The Volume window offers a volume slider. Drag this slider to set the
input volume (to the left is low, to the right is high).
5. Click OK to finish and save your settings.
After setting up the audio input and adjusting the volume, you need to launch
an application that records sound.
262
Part IV: Using Advanced Techniques 

Choosing a sound editing application
The Sound Studio application lets you record and digitize directly to your
hard disk on a Mac running OS X. You can download a copy free from Felt Tip
Software (www.felttip.com/products/soundstudio). You can then use it
for two weeks before having to pay $49.99 for it.
Toast 6 Titanium from Roxio (www.roxio.com) for Mac OS X includes the CD
Spin Doctor 2 application for recording sounds. CD Spin Doctor offers a Noise
Reducer option to select filters for noise reduction: de-click removes loud dis-
tortions, which occur frequently with vinyl records; de-crackle removes sur-
face crackling, which happens often with well-played vinyl records; and
de-hiss removes the hissing noise that occurs with many different analog
sources, including records and tapes. Roxio also offers a Windows applica-
tion, Easy Media Creator 7.5, which includes the LP and Tape Assistant for
streamlining the process of converting classic analog recordings. You can
apply similar cleaning effects as CD Spin Doctor to easily remove noise, pops,
and clicks from old recordings.
Modifying Songs in iTunes
Although iTunes was never meant to be a song editing application, it offers a
simple control over the starting and stopping points for playing back a song.
You can use this feature to cut out unwanted intros and outros of a song, such
Figure 20-2:
Set audio
input and
adjust the
volume of

Windows
PC.
263
Chapter 20: Recording and Editing Sound

as announcers and audience applause. You can also use it in conjunction with
the Convert feature to split a track into multiple tracks.
To do more significant modifications or editing, use the applications described
in “Recording Records, Tapes, and Analog Sources,” earlier in this chapter, or
use GarageBand on a Mac.
Setting the start and stop points in a song
iTunes will play only a portion of a song if you specify start and stop times
within the song. To set the start and/or stop points in a song, select the song
and choose File➪Get Info; then click Options to show the dialog that lets you
specify the start and stop times, as shown in Figure 20-3.
Click inside the Start Time field to set the start time; for example, in Figure
20-3, we set the Start Time to 0:30 (30 seconds). Click inside the Stop Time
field to set the stop time. The time is in minutes, seconds, and hundredths of
a second (decimal) — 8:15.978 is 8 minutes and 15.978 seconds.
To determine with accuracy the time for the start and stop points, play the
song and look in the Status pane at the top-center part of the iTunes window
for the Elapsed Time. You can drag the slider in the Status pane to move
quickly through the song and find the exact times for the start and stop
Figure 20-3:
Set the start
time for a

264
Part IV: Using Advanced Techniques 

points you want to set. Note: If you click Elapsed Time in the Status pane, it
toggles to Remaining Time; click it again for Total Time, and click it once
more to see Elapsed Time again.
iTunes plays only the part of the song between the start and stop times. You
can use this feature to your advantage because when you convert the song,
iTunes converts only the part of the song between the start and stop times.
Splitting a track into multiple tracks
You might have a CD that was created with all the songs combined into one
track, or you might have recorded an entire side of a vinyl record or cassette
tape into one sound file. Either way, you probably want to separate the songs
into separate tracks in iTunes.
The best way to split a long track into smaller tracks is to open the sound file
in a sound editing program that lets you select sections and save them sepa-
rately, as we describe in “Recording Records, Tapes, and Analog Sources,”
earlier in this chapter.
However, you can also separate a track into smaller tracks in iTunes, as long
as you use the AIFF format at first. Follow these steps:
1. Before ripping a CD or importing a sound file, set the encoder in your
importing preferences to AIFF.
Choose iTunes➪Preferences on a Mac/Edit➪Preferences on a Windows
PC. Click Importing, and set your Importing encoder to AIFF (full quality).
2. Rip the CD track into iTunes or import an AIFF sound file into iTunes.
Because you set the importing preferences to AIFF, the CD track is
imported into iTunes as AIFF at full quality. You want to do this because
you’re going to convert it in iTunes later, and you need the uncompressed
version to convert. Use a song name to identify this track as a long track
with multiple tracks — for example, call it side one or something like that.
3. Change your Importing preferences to AAC or MP3. (We use AAC
mostly.)
Choose iTunes➪Preferences on a Mac/Edit➪Preferences on a Windows
PC. Click Importing, and set your Importing encoder to AAC or MP3.
Now you’re ready to convert the song segments from the long track.
4. Select the song in iTunes and choose File➪Get Info.
The song information dialog appears.
265
Chapter 20: Recording and Editing Sound

5. Click Options to show the Start Time and Stop Time fields.
You can set the start and stop times for the song (refer to Figure 20-3).
6. Define the Start Time and Stop Time for the first song in the long
track, and click OK.
Play the song and look in the Status pane at the top-center part of the
iTunes window for the Elapsed Time. You can drag the slider in the
Status pane to move quickly through the song and find the exact times
for the start and stop points you want to set. For example, if the first
song were exactly 3 minutes and 12 seconds, you would define the first
section to start at 0:00 and play to 3:12. After setting the start and stop
times, click OK to close the song information window.
7. Convert the defined segment of the long track from AIFF to AAC 
or MP3.
Select the long track (side one) and choose Advanced➪Convert
Selection to AAC (or Advanced➪Convert Selection to MP3 if you chose
the MP3 encoder in Step 6). iTunes converts only the section of the song
defined by the Start Time and Stop Time fields that you set in Step 5, and
creates a new song track in the AAC or MP3 format (depending on your
choice in Step 3). iTunes converts the uncompressed AIFF segment into
the compressed AAC or MP3 format.
8. Change the song name of the newly converted track to the actual song
name.
The converted section of the long track still has the same name (side
one). Change its name by clicking inside the song name in the iTunes
song list, or by choosing File➪Get Info, clicking the Info tab, and clicking
inside the Name field. You can also enter a track number in the Track
field. The converted song starts and stops as you specified in Step 5;
because it’s also converted to AAC or MP3, it’s ready for use in your
iTunes library and in your iPod.
9. Repeat Steps 4–8 for each song segment.
Repeat these steps, selecting the long track (side one) each time and set-
ting a new start and stop time for each new song, and then changing
each newly converted song’s name.
10. When finished, delete the long track in AIFF format.
Delete the long track (side one) by selecting it and pressing Delete/
Backspace. You don’t need it anymore if you converted all the segments
to separate songs.

Enhancing Your Music Library
In This Chapter
 Downloading music from other sources
 Playing streaming broadcasts and Web radio in iTunes
 Adding podcasts to your iTunes library and iPod
Your music library is the center of your iPod and iTunes world — your
control console for playing Master DJ at the party, your basement studio
for burning CDs, and your archive of the most important music in the universe.
Of course you would want to enhance it in any way possible. 
In this chapter, we cover ways to enhance your iTunes library. We cover
downloading music from online sources other than the iTunes Music Store as
well as playing Web radio streams on your computer using iTunes. We also
describe how to get podcasts, which are similar to syndicated radio shows
but can be downloaded into iTunes and listened to at your convenience via
computer and iPod.
Downloading Music from Other Sources
The iTunes Music Store isn’t the only place to get music online for your iPod.
Other digital music services such as Napster 2.0, Rhapsody, BuyMusic.com,
MusicNow, and MusicMatch also offer music you can purchase. 
iTunes can store MP3, AIFF, Apple Lossless, and WAV audio files as well as
AAC audio files. If you have Windows Media Player version 9 or newer
installed on your PC, iTunes can also convert unprotected Windows Media
audio (WMA) files, but not the copy-protected music available for purchase
from online services. See Chapter 5 for details on how to import music files
into iTunes.

If you buy copy-protected music in the Windows Media format or other pro-
tected format, you can always burn a CD of the music and then rip the CD
into iTunes. It’s a good practice to burn a CD of music that you buy online to
have a backup copy in mint condition.
Music sources for iTunes and
MusicMatch Jukebox
You can find music in the following types of places online:
 From the source: New artists and musicians, and even legendary bands,
are increasingly offering a bit of music on their own Web sites for free.
This is the best source of free music because it’s legal and benefits the
artists directly — they want you to listen and tell your friends. Examples
include The Zen Tricksters (www.zentricksters.com/home.html),
Little Feat (www.littlefeat.net), and the Flying Other Brothers (www.
flyingotherbros.com).
 Protected music: Online music stores and services offer protected
music for sale. Windows Media-protected songs and other protected for-
mats can’t be imported into iTunes because they’re tied to the computer
and player used for the format. However, you can burn a CD with the
music (using a different player, such as Windows Media Player) and then
rip the CD into iTunes. You lose no quality because burning a CD doesn’t
reduce the music’s quality, and ripping the CD in iTunes doesn’t reduce
the music’s quality if you use the AIFF format or the Apple Lossless
encoder (or reduces quality only slightly if you use the AAC or MP3
encoders with the same or higher bit rate — see Chapter 18 for informa-
tion about setting the AAC or MP3 encoder bit rate). You can also rip the
CD into MusicMatch Jukebox using the WAV or MP3 encoders.
 Unprotected music: Some online services and Web sites offer unpro-
tected music for sale or for free downloading as part of a promotion for
artists. These sites and services typically offer MP3 or Windows Media
(WMA) unprotected files that you can import directly into iTunes or
MusicMatch Jukebox. For example, Warp Records (a prominent elec-
tronic music label) hosts Bleep.com (www.warprecords.com/bleep),
which offers downloads of ordinary MP3s from several independent
labels, without copy protection, for about $1.35 a song.
 Swapped music: Free and “pirate” networks using peer-to-peer technol-
ogy allow users to “swap” music for free. That is, people can trade
music, but the network essentially allows them to download music from
others on the network for free. Some networks require registration for
268
Part IV: Using Advanced Techniques 

(cough) joining them so that they maintain the semblance of privacy.
Others operate outside the legal jurisdiction of the U.S. copyright law
and the laws of other countries. We don’t like to recommend these net-
works for two reasons. One, the music might be pirated (and we believe
copyright owners deserve to have some control over distribution, even
free distribution). Two, the music might not be the highest quality
because of compromises (such as lower bit rates for MP3 files, which
make for poorer quality music).
If you have a choice of music formats to download, choose the highest qual-
ity format that you can download (depending on the bandwidth of your
Internet connection) — typically MP3 at the highest bit rate offered. iTunes
can import AIFF, WAV, AAC, Apple Lossless, and MP3 files, and the Windows
version of iTunes can also import WMA (unprotected) files if you have
Windows Media Player version 9 installed on your PC. MusicMatch Jukebox
can import WAV, MP3, or WMA (unprotected) files. You can use AIFF, WAV,
AAC, Apple Lossless, or MP3 files in your iPod, and convert files from other
formats into these formats as we describe in Chapter 18. If you’re using
MusicMatch, visit the companion Web site at www.dummies.com/go/ipod.
Playing Streaming Radio in iTunes
Radio stations from nearly every part of the world are broadcasting on the
Internet. You can tune into Japan-A-Radio for the top 40 hits in Japan, or
Cable Radio UK from the south coast of England, or Radio Darvish for Persian
traditional music. You can also check out the local news and sports from
your hometown, no matter where you are. You can listen to talk radio and
music shows from all over the country and the world.
By radio, we really mean a streaming broadcast; of course, real radio stations
make use of this technology to broadcast their programs over the Internet. A
streaming broadcast sends audio to your computer in a protected stream of
bits over the Internet. Your computer starts playing the stream as soon as the
first set of bits arrive, and more sections are transferred while you listen, so
that you hear it as a continual stream. Broadcasters can use this technology
to continually transmit new content (like a radio station).
In addition, thousands of Web sites offer temporary streaming audio broad-
casts all the time. A rock group on tour can offer a broadcast of a special con-
cert, available for only one day. You might want to tune in weekly or monthly
broadcasts such as high-tech talk shows, news programs, documentaries, or
sporting events . . . the list is endless. You can even have access to private
broadcasts such as corporate board meetings.
269
Chapter 21: Enhancing Your Music Library

You can’t record or save a song from a streamed broadcast without special
software. Nor can you play a streaming broadcast on your iPod, except as a
podcast. (See “Adding Podcasts” later in this chapter.) But you can add your
favorite stations to your iTunes music library to tune in quickly and easily.
You can also tune in any MP3 streaming broadcast if you know the Web
address.
iTunes offers a set of links to radio stations on the Internet, so you might
want to try these first. Follow these steps:
1. Select the Radio option in the Source pane.
The iTunes window displays a list of categories of radio stations.
2. Click the Refresh button to retrieve the latest radio stations.
More Web radio stations are added all the time. The Refresh button in the
top-right corner of the iTunes window (taking the place of the Browse
button) connects iTunes to the Internet to retrieve the latest list of radio
stations for each category.
3. Open a category to see a list of stations in that category.
Click the triangle next to a category name to open the list of radio
streams in that category, as shown in Figure 21-1. Some large radio 
stations offer more than one stream.
4. Select a stream and click the Play button.
To select a stream, click its name in the iTunes song list (actually, radio
station list because you selected Radio in the Source pane). Then click
the iTunes Play button. Within seconds, you hear live radio off the Web.

Part IV: Using Advanced Techniques 

If you use a dial-up modem connection to the Internet, you might want to
choose a stream with a bit rate of less than 56 Kbps for best results. The Bit
Rate column (refer to Figure 21-3) shows the bit rate for each stream.
iTunes creates a buffer for the audio stream so that you hear continuous
playback with fewer Internet-related hiccups than most Web radio software.
The buffer temporarily stores as much of the stream as possible, adding
more of the stream to the end of the buffer as you play the audio in the buffer.
If you hear stutters, gaps, or hiccups when playing a stream, set your buffer
to a larger size by choosing iTunes➪Preferences on a Mac/Edit➪Preferences
on a Windows PC. In the Preferences dialog, click the Advanced button and
then choose a size from the Streaming Buffer Size pop-up menu. Your choices
are Small, Medium, or Large (sorry, no X-Large).
Car radios offer preset stations activated by you pressing a button. Of course,
you first need to tune into the station of your choice to set that button. You
can save your radio station choices in an iTunes playlist, and the process is
just as easy:
1. Select a radio station stream.
2. Create a playlist or scroll the Source pane to an existing playlist.
See Chapter 9 to discover how to create a playlist.
3. Drag the stream name over the playlist name.
iTunes places the stream name in the playlist with a broadcast icon next
to it. You can click the playlist name and rearrange the playlist as you
want, dragging stream names as you would drag song names.
Drag as many steams as you like to as many playlists as you like. Radio
streams in your playlists play only if you are connected to the Internet.
To quickly create a playlist from selected radio streams, first select the streams
just as you would select multiple songs, and then choose File➪New Playlist
from Selection.
You can tune into any broadcast on the Internet. All you need to know is the
Web address, also known as the URL (Uniform Resource Locator), which is
the global address of documents and other resources on the Web. You can
find most URLs from a Web site or e-mail about a broadcast.
Follow these steps to add a Web broadcast to a playlist:
1. Choose Advanced➪Open Stream.
The Open Stream dialog appears, with a URL text field for typing a Web
address.
271
Chapter 21: Enhancing Your Music Library

2. Type the exact, full URL of the stream.
Include the http:// prefix, as in http://64.236.34.141:80/stream/
1014.
If you’re connected to the Internet, iTunes automatically retrieves the
broadcast and places it at the end of your song list.
3. Click OK.
As of this writing, iTunes supports only MP3 broadcasts. You can find lots of
MP3 broadcasts from SHOUTcast (www.shoutcast.com) and Live365.com
(http://live365.com).
Adding Podcasts
Podcasting is a popular method of publishing audio files to the Internet,
enabling people to subscribe to a feed and receive new audio files automati-
cally. Similar to a tape of a radio broadcast, a podcast can be saved and played
back at your convenience, both in iTunes on your computer and on your iPod.
A podcast can be anything from a single song to a commentary-hosted radio
show. Podcasts are saved in the MP3 format and can be used with any media
player, device, or application that supports MP3, including your iPod. The
podcast producer uses technology called Real Simple Syndication (RSS) to
publish the podcast. RSS is widely used by the Weblog community to publish
the latest blog headlines with links to the full stories. It’s now common to find
RSS feeds on major Web sites. RSS feeds are typically linked to with an orange
rectangle with the letters RSS or XML (for eXtended Markup Language, the lan-
guage of RSS). With a feed reader or aggregator application or browser plug-
in, you can automatically check RSS-enabled Web pages and display updated
stories and podcasts. RSS is supported directly by some Web browsers,
including Apple’s Safari 2.0 for Mac OS X 10.4, or newer versions.
You can use iTunes to subscribe to podcasts (available on the iTunes Music
Store) and to automatically update your iPod with podcasts. You can play the
podcast, incorporate it into playlists, and make copies and burn CDs as much
as you like. If you don’t like the podcast, simply delete it from your iTunes
library and update your iPod. You can listen to most common podcast file
formats in iTunes, including MP3, AAC, WAV, and .M4B.
If you prefer to use a podcast receiver application that supports the OPML
(Outline Processor Markup Language, a format for storing outlines in XML)
standard for importing and exporting podcast subscription lists, use iPodder
(from www.ipodder.org) for either Mac or Windows. iPodder searches for
your specified show and alerts you that a new show is downloadable. It then
downloads the show directly into iTunes and, if your iPod is connected, auto-
matically copies it to your iPod.

Selecting and subscribing 
to podcasts in iTunes
The iTunes Podcast page on the iTunes Music Store lets you browse, find,
preview, and subscribe to over 3,000 podcasts, all of which are free of charge.
To use iTunes to select and play podcasts, visit the iTunes Music Store. Click
Music in the Source pane to select the iTunes Music Store and visit its home
page, as described in Chapter 4. You don’t need an account to browse the
store and subscribe to podcasts. The Music Store home page replaces the
iTunes Song List and Browse panes.
To select a podcast from the store’s home page, click the Podcast link in
the column on the left side. This link opens the Podcasts page shown in
Figure 21-2. 
You can also get to Podcast page by clicking Podcasts in the Source pane, then
clicking Podcast Directory at the bottom of the song list view for Podcasts. 
You don’t have to settle for the podcasts advertised on the iTunes Music
Store’s Podcasts page — thousands of podcasts are available for free, and
Apple can’t possibly highlight them all. To find a podcast more to your liking,
click the Browse button, which displays a browse view of the podcasts as
shown in Figure 21-3. iTunes lets you browse podcasts by Genre, Categories
within each genre, and Subcategories within each category — just like brows-
ing songs in the store.

You can also search the iTunes Music Store specifically for podcasts. Click
inside the search field above the Search all podcasts pop-up button in the left
column of the Podcasts page, as shown in Figure 21-4. Use the pop-up menu
to narrow your search to just podcast titles or authors.
To select, play, and subscribe to a podcast, follow these steps:
1. Click a podcast feed link to select a podcast.
iTunes takes you to the podcast’s page in the store, as shown in Figure
21-5, which offers a description, a Subscribe button to receive new pod-
casts, and a link to the podcast’s Web site for more information. The
page also lists the most recent podcast. Some podcasters offer several
podcasts in one feed.
2. Select a podcast in the list; either click the Play button or press the
spacebar.
You can play any podcast in the list. (Some podcasts are not free and
provide only previews.) iTunes plays the podcast just like a Web radio
station, streaming to your computer. To jump ahead in a podcast or play
random sections, you must first subscribe to it. By subscribing, you
download the podcast to your computer.

3. Click the Subscribe button to subscribe to the podcast.
In typical Apple fashion, iTunes first displays an alert, as shown in
Figure 21-6, to confirm that you want to subscribe to the podcast. 
4. Click OK to confirm.
iTunes downloads the podcast to your computer and switches to the
Podcasts selection in the Source pane. It displays your newly subscribed
podcast in the song list, as shown in Figure 21-7. You can click the lower-
case “i” icon on the far-right podcast listing margin to display separate
information about the podcast.
5. Select a podcast and click the Play button.
You can now play the podcast just like any other song in your iTunes
library. The podcast may be long, but it’s still just a song. You can use the
iTunes playback controls to fast-forward or rewind the podcast or play it
from any point. The blue dot next to a podcast means you haven’t yet
played it. As soon as you start listening to a podcast, the dot disappears.

Podcasts only show up in the song list that appears when you select Podcasts
in the Source pane. They won’t show up in Party Shuffle unless you drag them
into the Party Shuffle playlist. Podcasts can’t be shared over a network, and
you can’t include podcasts with Autofill when updating an iPod shuffle. 
When you play a podcast, iTunes remembers your place when you stop lis-
tening to it, just like a bookmark in an audio book. iTunes resumes playing
from the bookmark when you return to the podcast to play it. 
Some podcasts are enhanced to include chapter marks and photos. When
you play an enhanced podcast in iTunes, a bookmark menu icon appears to
the top left of the iTunes window display, as shown in Figure 21-8. Click this
icon to display a pop-up menu offering the podcast’s chapter marks, artwork,
and chapter start times, as shown in Figure 21-9.
You can drag a podcast to the Source pane to create a new playlist, as shown
in Figure 21-10, which takes on the name of the podcast. (For example, drag-
ging the Folkden Podcast podcast to the Source pane in Figure 21-10 creates
the Folkden Podcast playlist.)

Like any playlist, the new playlist can be burned on CD or copied to an iPod.
You can also add multiple podcasts to playlists and burn them to CDs or
include them in your iPod. What you can’t do, as of this writing, is create a
Smart Playlist that includes podcasts.
If the podcaster embedded a photo in an audio podcast file or included a link
to a video from the file, the photo or video content appears in the Artwork
pane. 
Updating podcasts in iTunes
Many podcast feeds provide new material on a regular schedule, and iTunes
can check these feeds automatically and update your library with new pod-
cast downloads. You can, for example, schedule iTunes to check for new 
podcasts — such as news, weather, and traffic reports, and morning talk
shows — before you wake up and automatically update your iPod. When you
get up, you have new podcasts to listen to in your iPod.
To check for updates manually, select Podcasts in the Source pane and click
the Update button. That button replaces the usual Browse button in the
upper-left corner of the iTunes window whenever you select Podcasts in the
Source pane. All subscribed podcast feeds are updated immediately when
you click Update, and iTunes downloads the most recent (or all) episodes,
depending on how you’ve set your Podcasts preferences.
To set your Podcasts preferences so iTunes can check for new podcasts auto-
matically, choose iTunes➪Preferences on a Mac or Edit➪Preferences on a
Windows PC. In the Preferences dialog, click the Podcasts button to display
the Podcasts preferences, as shown in Figure 21-11. 
You can set the “Check for new episodes” pop-up menu to every hour, every
day, every week, or manually. You can also decide what to do when a new
episode (podcast) is available — set the pop-up menu to download the most
recent one, download them all, or do nothing. You can also set the Keep pop-
up menu to keep all episodes, all unplayed episodes, the most recent
episodes, or previous episodes.
If syncing podcasts automatically to your iPod, don’t set iTunes to keep only
your unplayed episodes. If you listen to part of a podcast on your iPod, and
then update your iPod, the podcast disappears from iTunes.
279
Chapter 21: Enhancing Your Music Library

Using iTunes to synchronize 
podcasts on your iPod
While you can listen to Web radio or a podcast at any time on your computer,
a podcast’s real value is that you can take it with you in your iPod. You can
keep your iPod synchronized with the most recent podcasts automatically.
You can also drag podcasts directly to your iPod just like any song, as long
as your iPod is set to be updated manually, as we describe in Chapter 9.
To update your iPod with podcasts automatically, follow these steps:
1. Connect your iPod to your computer. Wait for iTunes to start and for
your iPod to be ready in the Source pane.
If the iPod is set for automatic updating, wait for the iPod to finish its
usual updating of songs, calendar information, and contacts.
2. Choose iTunes➪Preferences on a Mac or Edit➪Preferences on a
Windows PC. 
3. Click the iPod button.
iTunes displays the iPod preferences dialog.
4. Click the Podcasts button in the iPod preferences dialog.
iTunes displays the iPod Podcasts preferences, as shown in Figure 21-12.
You can also display the iPod preferences by clicking the iPod
Preferences button in the Podcasts preferences dialog. Refer to 
Figure 21-13.
5. Set your iPod to update all podcasts, selected podcasts, or no podcasts. 
6. Click OK.
Figure 21-11:

Part IV: Using Advanced Techniques 

If you choose to update only selected podcasts, select each podcast in
the list box that you want copied in the update, as shown in Figure 21-14.
You can also set the Update pop-up menu to update all episodes, only the
most recent episode, or only unplayed episodes; refer to Figure 21-14.
After updating your iPod with podcasts, the Podcasts menu selection appears
in your iPod’s Music menu. Select Podcasts from the Music menu to see a pod-
casts menu on your iPod. Select a podcast to play it. On an iPod, podcasts
aren’t included when you select Shuffle Songs or Music Quiz.
You can synchronize podcasts with filenames ending with .m4b to any iPod
and never lose your bookmarked place, whether you listen on your iPod or
on your computer.
When you play an enhanced podcast on an iPod, your iPod displays the name
of the chapter you’re listening to above the playback position in the episode.
To see this, press the Select button during play to make a diamond appear in
the bar. You can then scroll the wheel right to scrub forward, or left to scrub
backwards.
To play podcasts on your iPod when it’s connected via a car stereo interface
and controlled by the car’s audio head unit, create a podcasts playlist first.
You can then select that playlist using the audio head unit navigation con-
trols and play the podcast.

Using iPodder to select and play podcasts
To use iPodder to acquire podcasts, download iPodder from www.ipodder.
org and double-click the iPodder installer to install the application. After
installing, follow these steps:
1. Double-click the iPodder icon to launch it.
2. Click the Status button to display the Status pane, and click the select
feed button.
Click the “Select feeds from the podcast directory” button as shown in
Figure 21-14. A list of podcast folders appears in a directory format.
3. Open a category and select a podcast.
Click the triangle to the left of a podcast folder, as shown in Figure 21-15,
to open the folder. Some folders contain subfolders. Podcast feeds have
a globe icon next to them. After selecting a feed, its Web address (URL)
appears at the bottom of the window.
4. Optional: Click “Open in browser” to open the podcast’s Web page
and read information about it.
Most have associated Web sites that provide information.

Chapter 21: Enhancing Your Music Library

7. Select the podcast feed in the Status pane, and click the “Check
selected feed” button.
iPodder checks the selected feed for any new podcasts and automati-
cally downloads them into an iTunes playlist named after the feed. For
example, the podcast from the Coverville feed appears in your iTunes
library in the newly created Coverville playlist.
You can play the podcast directly in iTunes, just like any other song in the
iTunes library, and assign the podcast to other playlists. If your iPod is con-
nected to your computer when iPodder downloads the podcast into iTunes,
iTunes automatically updates your iPod with the playlist containing the pod-
cast. You can also connect your iPod later and update it automatically by
playlist, as described in Chapter 9. 
You can also add a podcast feed directly to iPodder by copying the URL for
the podcast feed into the text input box in the Status pane and clicking the
Add button.
Scheduling podcast updates in iPodder
One iPodder benefit is the ability to schedule automatic updating with new
podcast downloads. To set up iPodder with an update schedule, launch
iPodder and follow these steps:
1. Click the Scheduler button to display the Scheduler pane.
2. Click the “Check for new podcasts automatically” option in the
Scheduler pane.
3. Click the “Check at these specific times” option and enter specific
times, or click the “Check at regular intervals” option and choose an
interval.
To enter specific times, use military time (for example, 16:30 is 4:30 PM).
Type the time into the time field as shown in Figure 21-16, and click the
check box next to the time field to make it active. The alternative to
scheduling specific times is to set the update to occur at regular inter-
vals. Choose an interval of hours or minutes from the “Repeat every”
pop-up menu.
4. Click “Apply scheduler settings” to apply the settings in the Scheduler
pane.
5. Hide or minimize the iPodder window but leave it running.
iPodder must be running to automatically keep its schedule of checking
and downloading podcasts. To minimize the iPodder window, click the
284

minimizer button (yellow button in the top left corner in Mac OS X, or
dash button in the top right corner in Windows). Minimizing a window
shrinks the window to an icon on the Windows Taskbar or Mac Dock.
Based on your scheduler settings, iPodder will check for and download new
podcasts and transfer them to your iTunes library in playlists named after
the podcast feeds.

 Customizing your iPod menus and settings
You might have purchased an iPod simply to listen to music, but those
thoughtful engineers at Apple who get to travel a lot with their iPods put
a lot more into this device.
As we show in this chapter, your iPod keeps time, and you can use it as an
alarm clock to awaken you to your favorite music (or just a beep). In particu-
lar, you can alleviate the boredom of travel with games, and check the time,
date, and month (in case you’re stranded for a long time). You can also check
your calendar and To-Do list, and look up contact names, addresses, and
phone numbers. You can even speak into your iPod and record dictation,
conversations, or notes. You can also make your iPod more convenient to use
while traveling by customizing the iPod menu.
Setting Date, Time, and Sleep Functions 
All iPods running iPod software version 2.0 or newer have a digital clock that
doubles as an alarm clock and a sleep timer. To access the clock, choose
Extras➪Clock from the main menu.
To set the date and time, follow these steps:

1. Press the Menu button.
2. Choose Extras➪Clock.
The clock appears with menu selections underneath (except in older
models).
You can also set the date and time by choosing Settings➪Date & Time
from the main menu.
3. Select the Date & Time option.
The Date & Time menu appears.
4. Select the Set Time Zone option.
A list of time zones appears in alphabetical order.
5. Scroll the Time Zone list and select a time zone.
The Date & Time menu appears again.
6. Select the Set Date & Time option.
The Date & Time display appears with up and down arrow indicators
over the hour field, which is now highlighted.
7. Change the field setting using the scroll wheel.
Scroll clockwise to go forward and counterclockwise to go backward.
8. Press the Select button after scrolling to the appropriate setting.
The up and down arrow indicators move over to the minutes field,
which is now highlighted.
9. Repeat Steps 7 and 8 for each field of the date and time: minutes,
AM/PM, the calendar date, calendar month, and year.
When you finish setting the year by pressing the Select button, the Date &
Time menu appears again. 
You can change the time display to show the number of hours from 1 to 24
(military style). In the Date & Time menu, scroll to the Time option and press
the Select button. The option changes from 12-hour to 24-hour (military style).
With 24-hour display, 11 p.m. is displayed as 23:00:00 rather than 11:00:00. To
switch back to 12-hour, click the Select button again with the Time option.
To display the time in the menu title for all iPod menus, scroll to the Time in
Title option in the Date & Time menu, and press the Select button to turn this
option On. Press the Select button again to switch it back to Off to stop show-
ing the time in the menu title.

Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

Just like a clock radio, you can set your iPod to play music for a while before
going to sleep. To set the sleep timer, select the Sleep Timer option from the
Clock menu. A list of intervals appears from 0 (Off) up to 120 minutes (2 hours).
You can select a time amount or the Off setting (at the top of the list) to turn
off the sleep timer. After the iPod shuts itself off (after you hold down the
pause button, or it remains idle for a few minutes and shuts itself off), the
preference for the Sleep Timer is reset to the default status, Off.
Setting the Alarm Clock
Time is on your side with the iPod Alarm Clock function, which is located in
the iPod Clock menu (found only in third- and fourth-generation models). To
set the Alarm Clock, follow these steps:
1. Choose Extras➪Clock➪Alarm Clock from the main menu.
The Alarm Clock menu appears.
2. Highlight the Alarm option and press the Select button (Off changes
to On).
3. Select the Time option.
The Alarm Time menu appears with up and down arrow indicators.
4. Change the time using the scroll wheel.
Scroll clockwise to go forward and counterclockwise to go backward.
5. Press the Select button after scrolling to the appropriate alarm time.
The Alarm Clock menu appears again.
6. Select the Sound option in the Alarm Clock menu.
A list appears, with the Beep option at the top of the list, followed by
playlists on your iPod in alphabetical order.
7. Choose an option as the alarm sound, and then press the Select button.
If you choose Beep, the alarm beeps without the need for any head-
phones or speakers. If you choose a playlist, when the alarm goes off,
the playlist plays until you stop it by pressing the Play/Pause button. Of
course, you need speakers or headphones to hear the music.
8. You can return to the main menu by pressing Menu until you see the
main menu.
When the alarm goes off, the playlist (or beep tone) plays until you stop
the alarm by pressing the Play/Pause button.

Chapter 22: Sleeping with Your iPod

Choosing Display Settings
Your future may be so bright that you got to wear shades, but your iPod black-
and-white display might need a bit of an adjustment so you can see it better 
in bright sunlight or the dark of night. With the iPod Settings menu, you can
change the timer for the backlight and also set the contrast of black-and-white
displays for better visibility. (The contrast setting for color-display iPod models
is not adjustable.) Choose the Settings menu from the iPod main menu.
Backlight timer
Ordinarily, your iPod display’s backlight turns on when you press a button or
use the scroll wheel, and then it turns off after a short amount of time. On
third-generation iPods, the backlight also lights up the iPod buttons.
You can set the backlight to remain on for a certain interval of time. Choose
Settings from the iPod main menu and then select Backlight Timer. A menu
appears — 2 seconds, 5 seconds, 10 seconds, and so on. Select one by
scrolling to highlight the selection, and then press the Select button.
The backlight drains the iPod battery; the longer you set the interval, the
more frequently you need to recharge the battery.
You can turn off the backlight (and the iPod itself) by pressing down and
holding the Play/Pause button. The backlight turns on when you press any
button or use the scroll wheel. You can also turn on the backlight by select-
ing Backlight from the iPod main menu.
You can set the backlight to always be on or always be off. If you set it to
always be off, the backlight doesn’t turn on automatically when you press
any button or use the scroll wheel. You can still turn it on, however, by select-
ing Backlight from the main menu.
The backlight isn’t that useful when the display is tilted toward direct sun-
light. As we discuss in the next section, it’s better to adjust the contrast to
get better visibility in bright lighting conditions.
Don’t be alarmed if your backlight turns itself on at midnight for a brief flash.
The iPod is just setting its internal clock. If you find this annoying, turn the
Backlight Timer to off.
292
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

Contrast for better visibility
You can set the contrast of black-and-white iPod displays to make the black
characters appear sharper against the display background. (This feature isn’t
provided in color-display iPod models.) You might need to adjust the con-
trast after a sharp temperature difference freezes or bakes your iPod. If you
keep your iPod in your car overnight in the cold, or even in direct sunlight for
a time, the contrast can change so much that you can’t see your iPod display.
Allow the iPod to warm up (slowly — don’t use the oven or microwave) if it’s
cold, or cool down if the display is hot, and then adjust the contrast.
To adjust the contrast, choose Settings from the iPod main menu, and then
choose Contrast from the Settings menu. The Contrast screen appears with a
slider that shows the contrast setting, which ranges from low contrast (a
black-and-white dot) to high contrast (a full black dot). Scroll clockwise to
increase the contrast (toward the black dot) and counterclockwise to
decrease the contrast (toward the black-and-white dot).
If you accidentally set the contrast too dark or too light, you can reset it to
the halfway point between too dark and too light by pressing and holding
down the Menu button for at least four seconds.
Playing Games
The games that come with the iPod — Brick, Parachute, and Solitaire — are a
bit dorky for the information age, but hey, they’re extras. Music Quiz, on the
other hand, is a cool way to test your knowledge of your music library.
To find the games, choose Extras➪Games. (On older iPods choose Extras➪
Game). And of course you can listen to music while you play — in fact, with
Music Quiz, you have to.
Brick and Parachute
Brick is like the original version of Breakout for the Atari. To access this game,
choose Extras➪Games➪Brick (Extras➪Game on older iPods), and press the
Select button to start the game. Move the paddle from side to side along the
bottom of the display by scrolling with the scroll wheel. You get a point for
each brick you knock out. If you break out — knock out all the bricks — you
move up a level in the game, and the game starts again.
293
Chapter 22: Sleeping with Your iPod

Parachute is a crude shoot-’em-up game where you play the role of an antiair-
craft gunner. Choose Extras➪Games➪Parachute, and press the Select button
to start the game. You pivot the gun at the bottom with the scroll wheel. Press
the Select button to fire on helicopters and paratroopers. Don’t let the para-
troopers reach the ground, or else they’ll heave grenades at you. War is hell.
Solitaire
Rather than playing the card game ’til one, with a deck of 51, try the iPod ver-
sion of Solitaire (also known as “Klondike”). Choose Extras➪Games➪Solitaire,
and press the Select button to start the game. To move cards, place the hand
pointer over a card by scrolling the scroll wheel, and press the Select button
to select the card. Then scroll again to move the hand pointer to the new
location for the card, and press Select to place the card at that position. To
deal out another round of three cards, move the hand pointer over the card
deck in the top-left corner of the display, and press the Select button. After
going through an entire deck, the game places the remaining cards into a new
deck so that you can continue dealing cards. The game improves considerably
in a smoke-filled room with take-out pizza nearby; gangsters are optional.
Music Quiz
Music Quiz tests your knowledge of your music library and is probably the
greatest time-waster of them all. The game plays the first few seconds of a
song picked at random from your iPod. Choose Extras➪Games➪Music Quiz,
put on your headphones or connect your iPod to speakers, and press the
Select button to start the game. As the song plays, you have ten seconds to
pick the song title from a list of five titles. If you choose the wrong title, the
game displays Incorrect! and moves on to the next one. If you choose the
right title, you gain points and move on to the next one. (“Life’s a Long Song”
by Jethro Tull would be appropriate.)
Checking Your Calendar
Imagine a musician going backstage after a performance and meeting a pro-
moter who says he can get him ten more gigs if he can confirm the dates right
now. This musician happens to carry around an iPod, and amid the backstage
craziness, he scrolls through his calendar for the entire year, finding all the
details he needs about gigs and recording sessions, right down to the minute,
including travel directions to each gig. “No problem,” the musician says.
Your iPod accepts calendars from calendar applications such as iCal on Mac or
Outlook on Windows, as described in Chapter 25. You can view these calendars
294
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

(or a blank calendar, if you haven’t updated your iPod with your calendar
files) by choosing Extras➪Calendars and then selecting a specific calendar 
by name, or All for a merged view of all your calendars. Select a calendar and
then use the scroll wheel to go through the days of the calendar. Select an
event to see its details. Press the Next and Previous buttons to skip to the next
or previous month. To see your To-Do list, choose Extras➪Calendars➪To Do.
If your calendar events use alarms, you can turn on the iPod’s calendar
alarms. Choose Extras➪Calendars➪Alarms. Select Alarms once to set the
alarm to Beep, or once again to set it to Silent (so that only the message for
the alarm appears), or one more time to set it to Off. (The Alarms choices
cycle from Beep to Silent to Off and then back to Beep.)
Calendars are far more useful if you enter your personal information as we
describe in Chapter 25.
Sorting Your Contacts 
The most likely bits of information that you might need on the road are some-
one’s phone number or address (or both). The iPod stores up to 1,000 con-
tacts right alongside your music. To see how to put your personal contacts
into your iPod, see Chapter 25.
The iPod contact list is sorted automatically, and the iPod displays contact
names in alphabetical order when you select Extras➪Contacts. You can
choose whether to display contacts by last or first name. Choose Settings➪
Contacts➪Display; then press the Select button in the scrolling pad for each
option:
 First Last: Displays the contacts list by first name and the last name, as
in Ringo Starr.
 Last, First: Displays the contacts list by last name followed by a comma
and the first name, as in McCartney, Paul.
You can also change how the contacts sort so that you don’t have to look up
people by their first names (which can be time-consuming with so many friends
named Elvis). The sort operation uses the entire name, but you decide whether
to use the first name or the surname first. Choose Settings➪Contacts➪Sort.
Press the Select button in the scrolling pad for each option:
 First Last: Sorts the contact list by first name, followed by the last name,
so that Mick Jagger sorts under Mick (after Mick Abrahams but before
Mick Taylor).
 Last, First: Sorts the contacts by last name, followed by the first name,
so that Brian Jones sorts under Jones. (Jones, Brian appears after Jones,
Alice but before Jones, Norah.)

Chapter 22: Sleeping with Your iPod

Speaking into Your iPod
Do you record conversations and interviews on the road? Throw out that
tape recorder. Your iPod can record hundreds of hours of voice-quality
memos, meetings, notes, and interviews with a touch of a button. All you
need is an accessory that includes a microphone, such as the tiny Belkin iPod
Voice Recorder (www.belkin.com), about $30, or the Griffin iTalk Voice
Recorder (www.griffintechnology.com), about $40. Either accessory fits
right on top of your iPod. The voice memos are stored on your iPod, where
you can review them immediately using the built-in speaker of the accessory
or your headphones or speakers. Even better, the voice memos are automati-
cally transferred to your iTunes library for archiving or reviewing on your
computer.
The voice recorder (such as the Belkin iPod Voice Recorder or the Griffin
iTalk Voice Recorder) attaches to the remote connector on the top of full-size
third-generation and fourth-generation iPods (updated by version 2.1 of the
iPod software or newer). Sorry, you can’t use them with the iPod mini or iPod
shuffle.
Recording voice memos
To record voice memos, connect the voice recorder to the iPod and choose
Extras➪Voice Memos➪Record Now. The iPod displays the Record screen.
Press the Play/Pause button to begin recording, and hold the iPod as you
would a microphone, with the voice recorder pointing at the sound source
(or your mouth for your voice). With the Belkin iPod Voice Recorder, a green
LED turns on when recording. You can pause the recording by pressing the
Play/Pause button again.
When you finish recording, press the Menu button. The audio files for voice
memos are stored on your iPod in the Recordings folder, using the date and
time of the recording as the filename.
Playing back voice memos
To play back a voice memo, choose Extras➪Voice Memos and choose the
voice memo from the list. (The Voice Memos menu doesn’t appear unless you
have already connected the voice recorder at least once.) Then select Play
(or press the Play/Pause button).
296
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

The voice memo plays just like any other song on your iPod — you can press
Play/Pause to pause playback, and press it again to resume. You can hear the
playback in the voice recorder’s tiny speaker, attach headphones to your
iPod, or connect your iPod to a home stereo, car stereo, or self-powered
speakers.
You can play music through the speaker of either the Belkin Voice Recorder or
the Griffin iTalk Voice Recorder by connecting the accessory to your iPod and
playing. This comes in handy if you set your iPod as an alarm clock to play a
music playlist; you can hear music when you wake up without having to con-
nect the iPod to speakers. See the earlier section, “Setting the Alarm Clock.”
Managing voice memos in iTunes
Just like your music, your voice memos synchronize automatically with your
iTunes library if you set your iPod to update automatically. (See Chapter 9 to
discover how to set your iPod to update automatically.) iTunes stores the
voice memos in the library and creates a playlist named Voice Memos, as
shown in Figure 22-1, so that you can find them easily.
If you update your iPod manually, you can drag voice memo files directly
from the Recordings folder to your hard drive, or drag and drop them over
the iTunes window. Note: The iPod must already be enabled as a hard drive.
(Read Chapter 23 to see how to enable your iPod as a hard drive.)
Voice memos are stored as WAV files. If you want to archive them in a format
that takes up less hard drive space, convert them by using the AAC or MP3
encoder, as we describe in Chapter 18.

Chapter 22: Sleeping with Your iPod

Customizing the Menu and Settings
When traveling or using your iPod in situations or environments where port-
ability is important, you might want to customize your iPod menu and display
to make doing things easier, such as selecting certain albums, displaying the
time, displaying menus with backlighting turned on longer than usual, and 
so on.
The Settings menu in the iPod main menu offers ways to customize your iPod
experience by changing the main menu to have more choices. Choose the
Settings menu from the main menu, and then choose Main Menu. The iPod
displays a list of menus; each menu is set to either On or Off. On means the
menu appears in the iPod main menu; Off means the menu does not appear in
the main menu. (Don’t worry; the menus are still where they are supposed to
be. Turning one to On simply adds it to the main menu as well.)
Other ways to customize your experience include setting the clicker sound
and setting the language to use for the menus. The options in the Settings
menu include:
 About: This displays information about the iPod, including number of
songs (and number of photos in a color-display iPod), how much space
is used, how much space is available, the software version in use, and
the serial number.
 Main Menu: This allows you to customize the main menu on iPods that
use iPod software 2.0 or newer. For example, you can add items from
other menus, such as Artists or Songs from the Music menu (Browse
menu in older iPods), to the main menu.
 Backlight Timer: You can set the backlight to remain on for a certain
amount of time by pressing a button or using the scroll wheel. Specify
two seconds, five seconds, and so on. You can also set it to always be on.
The backlight drains the iPod battery; the longer you set the interval,
the more you need to recharge the battery.
 Compilations: This option, available in the color-display models, works
with the “Group compilations when browsing” setting in iTunes. It
removes from the Artists (but not Albums) menu the artists and songs
designated as compilation albums in iTunes. It groups them into a new
entry in the Music menu called Compilations. Using this option you can
reduce the number of artists in the Artists menu to just those artists
with songs that aren’t part of compilations.
 Contrast: With black-and-white iPod displays you can set the contrast by
using the scroll wheel to increase or decrease the slider in the Contrast
screen. If you accidentally set the contrast too dark, you can reset it by
holding down the Menu button for at least four seconds. This option
isn’t offered in the color-display iPod.
298
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

 Clicker: When this setting is on, you hear a click when you press 
a button; when it’s off, you don’t hear a click. With color-display 
iPod models, the Clicker can be set to Speaker (the iPod speaker),
Headphones, Both, or Off.
 Language: This sets the language used in all the menus. See Chapter 1
for how to set the language.
 Legal: This displays the legal message that accompanies Apple products.
 Reset All Settings: This resets all the Settings menu settings in your
iPod, returning them to the state they were in originally. However, your
music and data files on the iPod are not disturbed. This is not the same
as resetting (and restarting) the iPod software itself; Reset All Settings
simply returns all settings to their defaults. See Chapter 1 for how to
reset the iPod itself.

Using the iPod as a Hard Drive
In This Chapter
 Enabling your iPod to work as a hard drive for a Mac or a Windows PC
 Setting up an iPod shuffle as a flash memory drive
 Copying notes and text files to your iPod
 Adding text guides, news feeds, and electronic books to your iPod
 Storing Mac OS X or OS 9 on your iPod for emergencies
You have a device in your pocket that can play weeks of music, sort your
contacts, remind you of events, wake you up in the morning, and tuck
you in at night. Did you also know that you can use your iPod to keep a safe
backup of your most important files?
You read that right. Windows and Mac users can put their most important
files on an iPod and use it just like a hard drive. Mac users can even put a ver-
sion of the Mac system on the iPod in case of emergencies. (Unfortunately,
you can’t do this with Windows.) Apple doesn’t recommend putting the Mac
system on the iPod because using the iPod as a startup hard drive might make
your iPod too hot from overuse, but you can do it. You can also copy applica-
tions and utility programs that you might need on the road or even copy your
entire User folder to the iPod if you have room after putting music on it.
But that’s not all. You can use software, such as Pod2Go, that offers synchro-
nized feeds that supply your iPod with news, weather forecasts, and even sec-
tions of Web pages for reading on the iPod screen. The handy iPod shuffle,
which plugs directly into a USB connection, can double as a USB flash memory
drive for portable file storage. 
If you format an iPod for Windows first, you can transfer files to and from
Mac and Windows computers. An iPod shuffle, which fits in the palm of your
hand and draws its power from the computer, is especially useful for transfer-
ring files back and forth.

The key to these capabilities is the fact that the iPod serves as an external
hard drive. After you mount the iPod on your Mac or Windows desktop, you
can use it as a hard drive, but do so sparingly.
We don’t recommend using the iPod regularly as a hard drive to launch appli-
cations. The iPod is designed more for sustained playback of music, and you
can eventually burn out the device by using it to launch applications all the
time. Instead, use it as an external hard drive for backing up and copying
files, and use it in emergency situations for starting up the system.
Enabling the iPod as a Hard Drive
You can use any iPod, including an iPod shuffle, as an external hard drive (or
in the case of an iPod shuffle, a flash memory drive). And like any hard drive,
you can transfer files and applications from your computer to your iPod and
take them with you wherever you go. The iPod is smart enough to keep your
files separate from your music collection so that you don’t accidentally erase
them when you update your music. And because your iPod is with you, it’s as
safe as you are.
The iPod, as shipped, is formatted as a Macintosh hard drive and can be con-
nected to any Mac. When you connect it to Windows, the iPod is reformatted
as a Windows hard drive. You can then connect it to any Windows PC or any
Mac. (Macs can use hard drives formatted for Windows PCs, but can’t start
the system from them.)
Setting up the iPod hard drive on a Mac
To use your iPod as an external hard drive on a Mac, follow these steps:
1. Connect your iPod to your Mac.
2. Select the iPod name in the iTunes Source pane.
3. Click the iPod Options button on the bottom-right side of the iTunes
window, or click the iPod button in the iTunes Preferences dialog.
The iPod Options button appears only when an iPod is connected and
selected in the Source pane. You can also choose iTunes➪Preferences
and click the iPod button — whether or not the iPod is selected in the
Source pane (although it has to be connected). The iPod preferences
dialog appears. 
302
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

4. Click the Music button in the iPod preferences dialog if it’s not
already selected.
When you first open iPod preferences, the Music button is already
selected and displays the iPod music updating preferences, as shown in
Figure 23-1.
5. Select the “Enable disk use” option and click OK.
The “Enable disk use” option is available if your iPod is set to automati-
cally update. If you already set your iPod to manual updating (as we
describe in Chapter 10), this option is grayed out because it isn’t 
needed — setting the iPod to update manually automatically enables
you to use it as a hard drive.
6. Open the iPod icon in the Finder to see its contents.
The iPod hard drive opens up to show at least three folders — Calendars,
Contacts, and Notes. You may also have other folders depending on the
iPod model; for example, a color-display iPod includes the folders shown
in Figure 23-2. You can add new folders, rename your new folders, and gen-
erally use the iPod as a hard drive, but don’t rename the folders already
provided on the iPod. They link directly to functions on the iPod — for
example, the Calendars folder links directly to the Calendar menu on 
the iPod.
Figure 23-1:

Chapter 23: Using the iPod as a Hard Drive

7. Optional: Drag files or folders to the iPod window.
To keep data organized, create new folders on the iPod, and then drag
files and folders that you want to copy to the newly created folders.
8. Before disconnecting the iPod, eject the iPod from the system.
Click the Eject button next to the iPod name in the Finder, or drag the
iPod icon to the Trash icon, which turns into an Eject button as you drag
the iPod icon into it.
After ejecting the iPod, its display shows the OK to disconnect message on
older models, or the main menu on newer models. You can then disconnect
the iPod from its dock or disconnect the dock from the computer. Don’t ever
disconnect an iPod before ejecting it. You might have to reset your iPod. (If
you do, head to Chapter 1.)
To delete files and folders from the iPod, drag them to the Trash just like an
external hard drive.
Don’t use a hard drive utility program, such as Disk Utility or Drive Setup, to
erase or format the iPod’s hard drive. If you erase your iPod’s hard drive in
this way, it might be unable to play music.
To see how much free space is left on the iPod, you can use the Finder. Select
the iPod icon on the desktop, and then choose File➪Show Info. You can also
choose Settings➪About from the iPod’s main menu.
Setting up the iPod hard drive on a
Windows PC with iTunes
You can set up your iPod to use as an external hard drive on a Windows PC
by using iTunes. If you use iTunes, follow these steps:

in the iTunes preferences dialog.
4. Click the Music button in the iPod pane of the preferences dialog if
it’s not already selected.
When you first open the iTunes preferences iPod pane, the Music button
is already selected. It displays the iPod music updating preferences, as
shown in Figure 23-3.
5. Select the “Enable disk use” option and click OK.
The “Enable disk use” option is available if your iPod is set to automati-
cally update. You must select this option to use your iPod as a hard
drive. If you already set your iPod to manual updating (as we describe in
Chapter 10), this option is grayed out because it isn’t needed — setting
the iPod to update manually automatically enables you to use it as a
hard drive.

6. Double-click the iPod icon in the My Computer or Windows Explorer
window to see its contents.
If you open the My Computer window, the iPod appears as an external
hard drive, as shown in Figure 23-4. The iPod in the figure is named
Journeyman and assigned to drive “E:”. Windows automatically assigns
the iPod hard drive to a Windows drive letter.
The iPod hard drive opens up to show at least three folders — Calendars,
Contacts, and Notes. You may also have other folders depending on the
iPod model; for example, the color-display iPods include the folders
shown in Figure 23-2. You can add new folders, rename your new folders,
and generally use the iPod as a hard drive, but don’t rename the folders
already provided on the iPod. They link directly to functions on the 
iPod — for example, the Calendars folder links directly to the Calendar
menu on the iPod.
7. Optional: Copy files or folders to the iPod.
To keep data organized, create new folders on the iPod, and then copy
files and folders to the newly created folders by using the drag-and-drop
method in the My Computer window or Windows Explorer, or by copy-
ing and pasting.
8. Before disconnecting the iPod, eject the iPod from Windows.
Right-click the iPod name or icon and choose Eject from the shortcut
menu. You can do this from within iTunes by clicking the Eject button
next to the iPod’s name in the Source pane.
Figure 23-4:

306
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

After ejecting the iPod, it displays the OK to disconnect message on older
models, or the main menu on newer models. You can then disconnect the
iPod from its dock or disconnect the dock from the computer. Don’t ever dis-
connect an iPod before ejecting it. You might have to reset your iPod. (If you
do, head to Chapter 1.)
To delete files and folders from the iPod, select the filename and press
Backspace, or choose File➪Delete from the Windows Explorer menu, just like
you do on your internal hard drive.
Don’t use the Windows formatting utility or another company’s hard drive
utility program to erase or format the iPod’s hard drive. If you erase the hard
drive in your iPod in this way, it may be unable to play music.
To see how much free space is left on the iPod, select the iPod icon in My
Computer and choose File➪Properties. You can also choose Settings➪About
from the iPod’s main menu.
Setting up the iPod shuffle 
as a flash memory drive
The iPod shuffle makes a really convenient flash memory drive, which is like a
hard drive except that it uses flash memory rather than a disk drive. Flash
memory is a rewritable memory chip that holds its content without power.
The name “flash memory” was coined by Toshiba to express how much faster
it could be erased (in a flash, you see). Flash memory is widely used for exter-
nal storage devices such as USB keychain-sized drives and digital camera
memory cards. The iPod software makes the flash memory look like a hard
drive to the operating system.
To enable your iPod shuffle to act as a flash memory drive to transfer folders
and data files, follow these steps:
1. Connect the iPod shuffle and select it in the Source pane.
2. Click the iPod Options button or click the iPod button in the iTunes
Preferences dialog.
The iPod Options button appears only when an iPod is connected and
selected in the Source pane. You can also choose iTunes➪Preferences on
a Mac or Edit➪Preferences on a Windows PC, and click the iPod button. 
3. Click the Music button in the iPod preferences dialog if it’s not
already selected.
When you first open iPod preferences, the Music button is already
selected and displays the iPod music updating preferences, as shown in
Figure 23-5.
307
Chapter 23: Using the iPod as a Hard Drive

4. Select the “Enable disk use” option.
The “Enable disk use” option in the iPod preferences pane enables the
iPod shuffle to act as a hard drive.
5. Drag the slider to the right to enable more space for data.
The iPod preferences pane for the iPod shuffle (refer to Figure 23-5)
includes a storage allocation slider with More Songs on the left side and
More Data on the right side. Drag the slider to the right to open up more
space for data.
6. Click OK to close the Preferences dialog.
If you set the storage allocation slider to allocate more space for data,
and you have music stored on the iPod shuffle that takes up more space
than what you’ve just allocated, iTunes asks if you want to delete music
from the iPod shuffle to make room for data. You can click Yes to delete
music or No to leave the music alone — in which case you have less
room for data.
7. Eject the iPod shuffle before disconnecting it.
Click the iPod Eject button, which appears in the bottom-right side of
the iTunes window, or click the eject icon next to the iPod shuffle name
in the Source pane. When the iPod shuffle’s status light stops blinking
and stays on, you can disconnect the iPod shuffle.
Figure 23-5:

308
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

On a Mac, you can also eject the iPod shuffle by dragging the iPod shuffle
icon to the Trash. On a Windows PC, you can eject the iPod shuffle by click-
ing the Safely Remove Hardware icon in the Windows system tray and select-
ing the iPod shuffle.
The Mac can use Windows-formatted hard drives, but Windows can’t use
Mac-formatted hard drives. If you want to transfer data files to and from Mac
and Windows computers, set up the iPod shuffle on a Windows computer to
format as a Windows hard drive.
Adding Notes and Text
You can add text notes to your iPod so that you can view them on the iPod
display — all sorts of notes, such as driving directions, weather information,
or even news items. If you just use your iPod for music, you might want notes
about the music. This feature works with iPods that run iPod software 2.0 or
newer (including iPod mini and all iPods that use the dock connector).
Using the Notes folder
In a perfect world you could rip audio CDs and also capture all the informa-
tion in the liner notes — the descriptions of who played which instruments,
where the CD was produced, and other minute detail. Then, while sharing
your iPod music with others, you could view the liner notes on the iPod
screen whenever a question arises about the music.
You can almost achieve the same result by typing some of the liner notes or
any text you want (or copy or export song information from iTunes, as we
describe in Chapter 12) into a word processing program, such as TextEdit on
a Mac or NotePad on a Windows PC. You can then save the document as a
text-only file (with the filename extension “.txt”) and drag it to the Notes
folder of the iPod.
Documents must be saved as text-only files to be viewed on the iPod display.
If you use a word processor, such as Microsoft Word, choose File➪Save As,
and select the Text Only option (or the Text Only with Line Breaks option)
from the Save As Type drop-down list in Windows or the Format pop-up
menu on a Mac. Notes text files can be up to 4K in length — that’s roughly 2
or 3 printed pages of information.
Text files in the Notes folder are organized by filename. You can view these
notes files by choosing Extras➪Notes. Make sure that you name your notes
with descriptive filenames so that you can easily scroll the list of notes files
to find the liner notes for the album you’re listening to.
309
Chapter 23: Using the iPod as a Hard Drive

Your iPod can also display a folder hierarchy in the Notes folder, allowing you
to organize your notes by creating folders (using the Finder with your iPod
mounted as a hard drive) and putting notes files within the folders in the
Notes folder. The size of any single note is limited to 4K; any text beyond 4K
is truncated. You can transfer up to 1,000 notes. 
Notes can include basic HTML tags (used on Web pages) such as paragraph
markers (<P> and </P>) and line breaks (<BR>). The HTML tags can define
links to other Notes text files and to audio files. Software companies such as
Talking Panda (http://talkingpanda.com/) have created textual guides
you can install in the iPod Notes folder that use these tags and links to pre-
sent text on the iPod screen and play audio files. You can learn how to
develop your own HTML tags by downloading Apple’s iPod Note Reader
User’s Guide (http://developer.apple.com/hardware/ipod/
ipodnotereader.pdf).
To navigate the Notes section of your iPod, use the iPod controls as follows:
 Use the select button to open a Note from its folder, just like playing a
song in an album. 
 Use the scroll wheel to scroll up and down the list of notes in a folder,
and up and down the text in a Note. 
 As you scroll through text, iPod jumps from link to link, highlighting each
link. When a link is already highlighted, you can use the select button to
follow the link. To go back to the previous link, use the Menu button. 
 To go up to the folder that contains the Note text file, use the Menu
button several times to back up through the links until the iPod displays
the folder.
Adding guides, books, and news feeds
Do you want the latest news, weather, sports scores, or driving directions
available at the touch of a button of your iPod? How about lessons on speak-
ing French, German, Italian, Spanish, or other languages? Enterprising soft-
ware entrepreneurs have moved in to fill the vacuum left by Apple with
accessories that provide displayable text on your iPod screen, such as the
following:
 Pod2Go (available at www.kainjow.com/pod2go/) for Mac OS X offers
synchronized feeds for news, weather forecasts, movie listings, stock
quotes, horoscopes, sections of Web pages, and driving directions. 
 NewsMac 3 (available at www.thinkmac.co.uk/newsmac), also for Mac
OS X, lets you keep tabs on world news Web sites and lets you transfer
entire Web pages. 
310
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

 iLingo (available at http://talkingpanda.com/ilingo.php) offers
language lessons, with over 400 essential words and phrases of your
chosen language, organized as Notes folders and files. It also includes
audio files, created by native speakers, that provide proper pronuncia-
tion for all included phrases.
 iBar (available at http://talkingpanda.com/ibar.php) offers drink
recipes with ingredients, instructions for mixing and proper garnishing,
and advice on which glass to use. Many recipes are linked to audio anec-
dotes about the origin of the cocktail as well as instructions on how to
mix it.
 EphPod for Windows (available at www.ephpod.com) lets you update
your iPod with news, weather, and other information updates.
 Book2Pod (available at www.tomsci.com/book2pod) is a shareware
program for the Mac that allows you to read entire books on your 
iPod display. There’s also a similar shareware program for Windows
called iPodLibrary (available at www25.brinkster.com/carmagt/
ipodlibrary/iPodLibrary.htm). 
 You can also take advantage of the Notes folder and other iPod features
by using some of the handy AppleScripts provided for iTunes and the
iPod, which you can download from the Apple site (www.apple.com/
applescript/ipod).
Taking Your Mac System on the Road
Although the iPod is the road warrior’s dream weapon for combating road
fatigue and boredom, if you update and maintain its hard drive contents wisely,
it can also be invaluable as a tool for providing quick information and for
saving your computer from disaster. Don’t let hard drive space go to waste: Fill
up your iPod and let the iPod be your road manager. You can put your most
important applications, utilities, and files on the iPod hard drive as a backup.
You can even use your iPod to save your Mac in a system crisis. Although
this operation isn’t officially supported by Apple, you can load the iPod with
a minimally configured Mac system and then use the iPod to start up your
Mac. Depending on the size of your iPod, you should be able to fit both a min-
imal system and a considerable amount of music on the iPod.
Life on the road can be hazardous to your laptop’s hard drive, and if any por-
tion of the hard drive containing system files is damaged, your system might
not start up. When this happens, you ordinarily use the installation CDs to
start the Mac, scan and fix the hard drive trouble spots, and reinstall the Mac
operating system. With your iPod, you can at least start the Mac and scan
and fix the hard drive trouble spots, and you can also use any other files or
applications that you previously put on your iPod.

Chapter 23: Using the iPod as a Hard Drive

Mac models introduced after January 2003 can’t start up with Mac OS 9, so
you need to save Mac OS X to your iPod unless you use an older Mac.
To get the most functionality from your iPod, make sure that you have the
latest version of iPod software. To find out which version of software your
iPod uses, choose Settings➪About from the iPod main menu. To update your
iPod software to the latest version, see Chapter 27.
To copy files and applications to your iPod, first enable the iPod as a hard
drive, as we describe earlier in this chapter.
Installing Mac OS X
To install a custom version of OS X older than version 10.2 on your iPod
(such as 10.0 or 10.1), connect your iPod as a hard drive, as we describe ear-
lier in this chapter, and then follow these steps:
1. Insert your Mac OS X installation CD into your Mac and follow the
directions to start up the installation process.
You have to restart the Mac with the installation CD while holding down
C to start the computer from the CD.
2. When the installer asks you to select a destination, choose the iPod
hard drive.
Don’t use the option to erase and format the hard drive, because the
hard drive of your iPod is specially formatted for playing music, and for-
matting it in this manner prevents it from playing music again. So don’t
format it! If you format or erase the iPod’s hard drive by mistake, you
must restore it to its factory condition, as we describe in Chapter 27.
3. Specify a custom installation rather than a standard installation.
To make sure that you don’t use up too much hard drive space on your
iPod, choose a custom installation of OS X. In the custom installation
section, choose only the languages that you need. These language
options take up a lot of space, and you probably don’t need them.
4. After installation finishes and the Mac restarts from the iPod, con-
tinue through the setup procedure, and then use Software Update in
System Preferences to update the Mac system on your iPod.
Most likely a lot of system updates are waiting for you — updates
released after the date of your installation CDs. Take the time to update
your system because these updates might make a difference in how your
computer performs with certain applications.
312
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

To install a custom version of OS X version 10.2 (Jaguar) on your iPod, you
can use Carbon Copy Cloner, a $5 shareware program (available from www.
bombich.com/software/ccc.html). Although you could clone your system
by using the Unix ditto command in the Terminal window of Mac OS X, this
process is tedious and you could easily make a mistake. Carbon Copy Cloner
lets you specify what parts of the system you don’t need cloned, and you can
use its Preferences dialog to make the “target disk” (your iPod) bootable. 
You can also install OS X version 10.2 on your iPod using SuperDuper! (www.
shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html), a 
$19.95 advanced disk-copying program. 
To install a custom version of OS X version 10.3 (Panther) or version 10.4
(Tiger) on your iPod, connect your iPod as a hard drive, and then use the
Disk Utility program supplied with OS X. (It’s in the Utilities folder inside your
Applications folder.) Using Disk Utility, drag the icon for a source hard drive
with a version of OS X to the Source text box in the Disk Utility dialog, and
then drag your iPod hard drive icon into the Destination text box. Then click
Restore, and the program does everything for you. 
To start up a Mac in an emergency situation from an iPod that runs Mac OS X,
connect the iPod, hold down Option, and choose Restart from the Apple
menu (or if your system is already hosed, use the Power button to reboot
while holding down Option). Eventually, as the Mac resets itself and scans
itself for any startup drives, all the startup drives appear as icons in a row,
with a right-pointing arrow underneath the icons. Click the icon representing
the iPod hard drive, and then click the right-pointing arrow to start the
system from that drive.
While you’re at it, copy the Disk Utility program to your iPod so that you can
repair any Mac’s hard drive by using your iPod as the startup drive.
Installing Mac OS 9
Macs sold since 2003 no longer use OS 9, and some older models can’t use a
FireWire drive (such as an iPod) as a startup drive. However, you can still
install OS 9 on an iPod to use as a startup drive for a Mac that can run OS 9.
To install a custom version of OS 9 on your iPod, connect your iPod as a hard
drive, and then follow these steps:
1. Insert your Mac OS 9 installation CD into your Mac and follow the
directions to start up the installation process.
You have to restart the Mac with the installation CD while holding down
C to start the computer from the CD.
313
Chapter 23: Using the iPod as a Hard Drive

2. When the installer asks you to select a destination, select the iPod
hard drive.
3. After the installation finishes, quit the installation program.
That’s all you have to do — the installer does everything for you.
To start up a Mac from an iPod that holds Mac OS 9, connect the iPod, hold
down Option, and choose Restart from the Apple menu (or if your system is
already hosed, use the Power button to reboot while holding down Option).
Eventually, as the Mac resets and scans itself for any startup drives, all the
startup drives appear as icons in a row, with a right-pointing arrow under-
neath the icons. Click the icon representing the iPod hard drive, and then
click the right-pointing arrow to start the system from that drive.
Removing the system
Removing Mac OS 9 from an iPod is easy: Simply drag the System Folder from
the iPod hard drive to the Trash when your iPod is connected as a hard drive.
Removing Mac OS X isn’t as easy because OS X installs hidden files and directo-
ries, and there is no easy way to drag them to the Trash. (Perhaps that’s why
Apple doesn’t support this feature.) The quickest and easiest way to remove
OS X from an iPod is to restore the iPod, as we describe in Chapter 27. Restore
erases and reformats the iPod to its original factory condition. Be sure to copy
any important files stored on your iPod before doing this. Although all your
music and files are erased in this one step, it’s much easier to then add your
music from iTunes, your calendars and contacts, and your files, than it is to try
to delete files associated with OS X. Restore, and then copy everything back to
your iPod as needed.

Transferring and Viewing Photos
In This Chapter
 Importing photos to your computer to use with your color-display iPod 
 Transferring photos from your computer to your iPod 
 Connecting your color-display iPod to a television or to video equipment
 Viewing slideshows with a color-display iPod
 Using accessories to store photos temporarily on an iPod’s hard drive
T
aking photos has never been easier. Digital cameras and photo editing
software have combined to turn computers into digital darkrooms — no
need for a real darkroom with smelly chemicals and film processing equip-
ment. In fact, you no longer need film. What a relief! You can take all the pic-
tures you want without ever having to find a store to buy another roll of film.
Now maybe your vacation photos bore other people, but to you they’re price-
less, preserving special memories. Family pictures, vacations, weddings. . .these
events don’t happen every day. You want to take these pictures with you when
you visit friends and relatives, who promised not to be bored. But you don’t
want to lug a slideshow projector and a carousel loaded with expensive slides,
nor do you want to set up a computer. Why not use your iPod?
The color-display iPod models store photos that you can view on the iPod
display, and it also connects easily with televisions and video equipment to
display photos and slideshows to a larger audience. You can transfer your
digital photo library on your computer directly to a color-display iPod in one
easy step and keep your color-display iPod synchronized when you add more
photos to your library.
This chapter tells you all you need to know about digital cameras to get your
photos into your color-display iPod and make fabulous slideshows. It also
describes accessories you can use to transfer photos directly from digital
cameras and memory card readers to your iPod’s hard drive for temporary
storage, so that you never run out of memory for photos when shooting pic-
tures on the run.

Importing Photos to Your Computer
Digital photography is truly instant gratification — you see the results imme-
diately and can then take more pictures based on what happened an instant
before. When you run out of exposures on your digital film card, connect
your digital camera or card reader to your computer and offload the photos
to a computerized photo library, and delete them from the memory card.
Then go back and take more pictures!
Don’t have a digital camera? You still like to use that old film camera your
grandmother gave you? Don’t worry. You can use a scanner to scan photo-
graphic prints, or send your film rolls to a photo service that can convert
your film to digital images on a CD or the Web. (Odds are the photo service
you already use offers this service. Next time you’re there, ask about it.) For
example, if your camera uses 35mm film, you can have your pictures devel-
oped by a digital imaging service, such as PhotoWorks (www.photoworks.com)
or the “You’ve Got Pictures” service on America Online. Many services offer
digital processing of film and choices on how to deliver the digital images —
on CD, or posted on the Web for easy downloading to your Mac.
It makes sense to use a computer to organize and archive all your digital
photos. You can organize even massive quantities of photos in the photo
library in your computer. You can add keywords, titles, and film roll informa-
tion to each photo automatically, to make locating a particular photo very
easy. Keep the photos you like, and delete the ones you don’t like. If you have
a color printer, obtaining extra prints is as easy as using the Print command.
You can even e-mail the photos to a service for high-quality prints.
Photo library software, such as iPhoto on the Mac or Adobe Photoshop
Elements or Photoshop Album on a Windows PC, can organize any number of
photos; the number is limited only by available hard drive space. At an aver-
age size of 2MB per photo (and many photos occupy less space), you can
store 10,000 photos in a 20GB hard drive. And, of course, you can expand a
photo library over multiple disks or create multiple libraries. The number of
digital photos you can manage has no practical limit.
Connecting a digital camera 
or memory card reader
To import photos to your computer, connect your digital camera to the com-
puter and use iPhoto on a Mac, or use the digital photo application supplied
with your digital camera on a Windows PC. USB (Universal Serial Bus) is the
connection of choice for connecting most digital cameras to a computer —
the exceptions are very high quality cameras that offer FireWire. Fortunately,
both types of connections work the same way.
316
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

Digital cameras typically come with a special USB or FireWire cable that has a
very small connector on one end for the camera and a larger connector on
the other end for the computer’s USB or FireWire port. However, if both ends
are the same on the cable you are using, it doesn’t matter which end is
plugged into the camera or the computer. 
Be sure to power up your camera — most digital cameras have a power-on
switch to save battery life. (Many smart people, including ourselves, have sat
there waiting for the photos to appear, only to find that the camera was still
asleep.) Connect your camera before you turn it on, because the computer
may not recognize some camera models unless they are turned on while con-
nected. If the computer doesn’t recognize your camera, try turning the
camera off and then turning it on again.
If your camera has an AC adapter, run the camera off the adapter when
importing photos to save the camera’s battery time. If your camera has a
sleep mode, make sure that you disable or set it to a time increment long
enough to allow your images to import. Importing 24 photos generally takes
about one minute with most digital cameras.
A digital camera’s memory cards are like extra rolls of film. A memory card
reader is useful if you take lots of pictures and use additional cards. Rather
than connecting your camera to your computer every time you want to trans-
fer pictures, leave the card reader connected to the USB connection on your
computer, and put the camera’s memory card in the card reader. If you use
multiple memory cards, this method is especially convenient. 
iPhoto on a Mac can import photos from a card reader just as it does with a
camera, using the same steps. Many Windows applications supplied with digi-
tal cameras can also import photos from memory card readers. For example,
Preclick Silver Photo Organizer (www.preclick.com) can import photos
from CDs, memory card readers and digital cameras that can connect by USB
or FireWire and simulate a hard drive. 
Using iPhoto on a Mac 
To import pictures from a digital camera, connect the camera to your Mac.
Click the iPhoto icon to start iPhoto (if it hasn’t already started), and follow
these steps:
1. Click the Import mode button.
The tools pane changes to show the Import tools, as shown in Figure 24-1.
iPhoto displays either a camera icon, a disk icon, or a memory card
reader icon, depending on the type of camera or memory card reader
you are using. Our Nikon CoolPix 4300 shows up with a disk icon.
317
Chapter 24: Transferring and Viewing Photos

2. Choose whether or not to delete the photos in your camera after
importing.
If you want to delete photos from your camera as soon as they are
imported, click the “Erase camera contents after transfer” option in the
tools pane (located at the bottom of the iPhoto window). Many cameras
have a delete function, so you don’t need to use this option. However,
using this option enables you to import and delete photos in the camera
all in one step. With the photos in the photo library, you no longer need
to keep copies in your camera or memory card, and you can make room
for new photos.
3. Click the Import button.
While the importing occurs, the Import button changes to a Stop button;
to cancel the photo transfer at any time during your import, click the
Stop button. When it finishes importing, iPhoto displays a small image
for each photo in the photo library, as shown in Figure 24-2. The size of
the images in the viewing area is controlled by the zoom slider in the
lower right corner of the iPhoto window, just underneath the viewing
area. These small versions of your images, which can be reduced to very
small, are called thumbnails.
4. Disconnect the camera (eject it first if necessary).
If ejecting is required, the camera’s icon appears on the desktop. To
eject the camera, click the camera’s icon and hold down the mouse
button. The Trash icon changes to the Eject icon. You can then drag the
camera icon over the Eject icon to eject the camera properly. Although
nothing really happens (nothing actually ejects from the machine, nor

do any doors open), you may find that if you don’t eject as required with
some cameras, your images may not delete from the camera even if you
have the delete option enabled.
Using digital camera software on a PC
To import pictures from a digital camera, connect the camera to your com-
puter and launch the Windows-based photo application supplied with your
camera. While there are different applications for different cameras, they gen-
erally provide instructions for these four steps:
1. Connect your camera and set your application into import mode.
After connecting your digital camera, your application offers a simple
method of importing photos from the camera into your computer. Set up
the application so that it is ready to import. For example, in Adobe
Photoshop Album, click the Get Photos button, and then choose Digital
Camera or Scanner.
2. Choose whether or not to delete the photos in your camera after
importing.
Most camera applications offer an option to delete photos from your
camera as soon as they are imported. Many cameras have a delete func-
tion, so you don’t need to use this option. However, using this option
enables you to import and delete photos in the camera all in one step.
With the photos in the photo library, you no longer need to keep copies
in your camera or memory card, and you can make room for new
photos.
Figure 24-2:

Chapter 24: Transferring and Viewing Photos

3. Start the importing process by choosing an import command or click-
ing an import button.
4. Disconnect the camera (eject it first if necessary).
To eject the camera, right-click the camera’s icon, choose Eject from the
pop-up menu, and then disconnect the camera. Another method is to
click the Safely Remove Hardware icon in the bottom-right corner of the
screen. The Safely Remove Hardware shortcut menu appears — select
the IEEE 1394 (FireWire) device if you use FireWire, or the USB Mass
Storage device if you use USB, from the shortcut menu. When the alert
dialog appears, click OK and then disconnect the camera.
Organizing photos into 
albums or collections
You’ve probably seen photo albums with plastic sleeves for holding photo-
graphic prints. A digital photo album is similar in concept but holds digital
photo files instead of prints. In both cases, an album is simply a way of orga-
nizing photos and placing them in a proper sequence. You select the photos
from your photo library and arrange them in the order you want. iPhoto uses
album as its term; Adobe Photoshop Elements and Photoshop Album call it a
collection. We use the term album for both.
You can use photo albums to assemble photos from special events, such as 
a vacation, or to display a particular subject, such as your favorite nature
photos. If you have many more photos in your library than you want to put
on a color-display iPod, you may want to organize albums specifically for
transfer to the color-display iPod and for automatic updating. The order that
your photos appear in the album is important — it defines the order of photos
in a slideshow on your color-display iPod. You can also use albums to orga-
nize photos for a slideshow, QuickTime movie, or Web page.
You can make as many albums as you like using any images from your photo
library. Because the albums are lists of images, they don’t use up disk space
by copying the images — the actual image files remain in the photo library.
Like an iTunes playlist, a photo album is a list of references to photos in your
library. You can include the same photo in several albums without making
multiple copies of the photo and wasting disk space. 
To assign photos to an album in iPhoto, follow these steps:
1. Click the Organize mode button.
The photos in your library appear as thumbnails in the viewer pane.
320
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

2. Click the + button.
The + button is underneath the Source pane; refer to Figure 24-2.
Alternatively choose File➪New Album or Ô+N.
The New Album dialog box appears.
3. Type the album name and click OK.
The default name appears highlighted in the New Album dialog box. Type
a name for the album (other than “Album 01” — something descriptive.
4. Select photos in your library and drag them into the album.
When you click on a photo, you know the photo is selected when an 
outline appears around it — drag the photo over the name of the album
in the Source pane. You can select multiple photos for dragging by click-
ing the first one and holding down the Shift key while clicking the last
one — the first, last, and all the photos between them are selected auto-
matically. You can also add individual photos to a selection by Ô-click-
ing or Ctrl-clicking each photo. You can then drag the selection over 
the name of the album in the Source pane, as shown in Figure 24-3. A
number appears, showing the number of selected photos in the range.
5. Click the photo album name in the Source pane to rearrange the
photos in the album.
When you click an album name in the Source pane, only the photos you
dragged to the album appear in the viewer pane, not the entire library.
You can reorder pictures within the album by simply dragging them to a
different position.
Figure 24-3:
Add multiple

321
Chapter 24: Transferring and Viewing Photos

iPhoto also lets you create smart albums. Smart albums add photos to them-
selves based on prearranged criteria. You can set up a smart album that
decides which photos to include based on the ratings you assign to them. For
example, you might want to set up a smart album with only the highest-rated
photos taken during the last six months.
To create a smart album in iPhoto, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪New Smart Album and type a name for the album in the
name field.
2. Set the criteria for including photos in the smart album.
Make your criteria selections from the pop-up menus. Select a condition
from the first pop-up menu and choose a comparison, such as the
greater than or less than, from the second pop-up menu.
3. Combine conditions for better results.
To add additional matching conditions, click the Add (+) button. Then
decide whether to match all or any of these conditions by choosing
either option from the pop-up menu next to Match.
4. Click OK.
When finished adding conditions to establish the smart album criteria,
click OK to save your smart album.
iPhoto automatically updates your smart album when any photo that
matches the criteria is added or removed from the library. 
Windows users can assign photos to a collection using Adobe Photoshop
Album. Follow these steps:
1. Click the Collections tab.
2. Click the “Create new collection” button.
The Create Collection dialog box appears.
3. Type the collection name and click OK.
4. Select photos and drag them into the collection.
You can select multiple photos by clicking the first one and holding
down the Ctrl key while clicking more photos. Drag the selected photos
to the new collection tag to add them to the collection.
5. Click the check box next to the collection name to view the collection
and rearrange the photos in the collection.
You can reorder pictures within the album by simply dragging them to a
different position.
With your photos organized into albums or collections, you are ready to set
up automatic transfer to your color-display iPod.

Transferring Pictures to a 
Color-display iPod 
You can take your pictures with you, safely tucked into your color-display
iPod. On a Mac, you can use iPhoto (version 4.0.3 or newer) to import photos
into your computer and organize them into albums. You can then use iTunes
to transfer photos from your iPhoto library automatically.
On Windows, you can use Adobe Photoshop Album (version 1.0 or newer), or
Photoshop Elements (version 3.0 or newer), to import photos into your com-
puter and organize your photos into collections. You can then use iTunes to
transfer photos from your photo library automatically.
On either Mac or Windows, you can use any other photo editing or organizing
software and store your photos in a folder on your hard drive. You can then
use iTunes to transfer photos from the folder.
Whether you transfer photos from a library or from a folder on your hard
drive, you can keep your color-display iPod synchronized with the photo
library and its albums, or with the subfolders and image files in the folder.
Your color-display iPod can be kept up-to-date every time you connect it to
your computer — not just with music, but also with photos.
If you connect your color-display iPod to another computer running iTunes,
you might be in for a surprise. When you connect a color-display iPod previ-
ously linked to another computer, iTunes displays the message: This iPod
is linked to another photo library. Do you want to change the
link to this photo library and replace all existing photos on
this iPod with those from this library? If you don’t want to change
your iPod to have this other photo library, click No. Otherwise, iTunes erases
the photos on your iPod and updates your iPod with the other computer’s
photo library. 
Transferring photos from a photo library
If you store photos in an iPhoto library on a Mac, or in a photo library man-
aged by Adobe Photoshop Album or Photoshop Elements on a Windows PC,
you can transfer photos to your color-display iPod automatically, and syn-
chronize your iPod to your library so that any changes you make to the
library are copied to your iPod. You can also limit the transfer and synchro-
nization to albums or collections rather than the entire library.
To transfer all photos in a library to a color-display iPod and keep your iPod
synchronized with your photo library, follow these steps:

Transferring image files 
from a hard drive folder 
No matter what photo application you use, you can save photos as image
files in a folder on your hard drive, and then bring them into your color-dis-
play iPod whenever you want. It’s rare for a color-display iPod to meet an
image file format it doesn’t like. Use JPEG (JPG), GIF, TIFF (TIF), Pict, PNG,
PSD (Photoshop), PDF, jpg 2000, SGI, and BMP on a Mac. On a Windows PC,
use JPEG (JPG), GIF, TIFF (TIF), PNG, and BMP.

connect your color-display iPod to this computer, iTunes automatically syn-
chronizes your iPod with the folder on your hard drive, keeping your iPod 
up-to-date with any new photos, changed photos, or deletions.
Transferring full-resolution 
photos and images
Picture quality with a digital camera is measured by the number of pixels —
specific points of information in a picture, also known as the image resolution.
Digital cameras are often described by the image resolution in millions of
pixels, or megapixels. Higher megapixel counts usually result in better images.
A 2-megapixel camera produces good 4×6-inch prints and acceptable 8×10-
inch prints. A 3-megapixel camera produces very good 4×6-inch prints and
magazine-quality 8×10-inch prints. A 5-megapixel camera produces good qual-
ity 10×14-inch prints. And so on.
A color-display iPod, by default, doesn’t need the full resolution of photos to
display them well on televisions and use them with video projectors, which
are far lower in resolution than prints; certainly the tiny iPod display doesn’t
need high resolution in the photos it displays. The more resolution you have,
the more space the photo takes up, so during the transfer, the color-display
iPod software optimizes photos for video display to save space.
If you intend to use your color-display iPod to transfer images to another
computer or to make a backup of your photos in their original resolution, you
can set an option to include full-resolution versions of the photos when trans-
ferring photos. You would do this to preserve the full quality of the photo so
that you can use the version on the iPod for making prints.
To include full-resolution images, follow the steps outlined above to transfer
your photos to a color-display iPod. In the color-display preferences (refer 
to Figure 24-6), click the “Include full-resolution photos” option. This option
copies the full-resolution photos into the Photos folder of your color-display
iPod, which you can access on your computer by enabling your iPod for hard
drive use, as described in Chapter 23.
Transferring photos with the 
iPod Camera Connector
Don’t you just hate it when you fill up your digital camera’s memory card
while on the road, away from your computer? No matter how many pictures
you take, you can’t run out of memory if you use a color-display iPod and
Apple’s iPod Camera Connector, available from the Apple Store — a compact
328
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

storage solution that lets you shoot your photos, dump them into a color-
display iPod for storage, preview them on the iPod, and continue shooting.
Depending how much space you have on your iPod, you could continue
shooting photos indefinitely without having to visit your computer or use
more memory cards.
The iPod Camera Connector is a convenient adapter — about the size of a flash
memory card and about twice as thick — that connects to a color-display
iPod’s dock connection and lets you plug in a USB cable connected to your
digital camera. You can then temporarily store photos from digital camera
memory cards at full resolution on the iPod, for later importing into your
computer.
To transfer photos using the iPod Camera Connector, follow these steps:
1. Connect your digital camera to the iPod Camera Connector.
Use the USB cable supplied with your camera.
2. Connect the iPod Camera Connector to the dock connection of your
color-display iPod.
3. Turn your digital camera on.
The Import menu appears on the iPod color display, showing the number
of photos in the camera and the space occupied, along with the Import
and Cancel menu functions.
4. To import photos, highlight Import and press the Select button.
The Photo Import menu appears, showing the progress of the download
to your iPod. During this process you can choose the Stop and Save
function to save the pictures you’ve downloaded, or Cancel to cancel
the download. When the download finishes, your color-display iPod
gives you the option to erase the camera’s memory card.
To preview your photos on the iPod, see the next section, “Viewing Photos
with Your Color-display iPod” in this chapter.
Viewing Photos with Your 
Color-display iPod 
You may remember the old days when slides were projected onto white walls
or sheets, and the click-clack sound of the slide carousel on the projector
drowned out everything else. Now you can throw away those old slide projec-
tors, connect up your television, and present a slideshow with music and
transitions between each photo. All you need is your color-display iPod and a
television, video monitor, video projector, or similar video equipment.
329
Chapter 24: Transferring and Viewing Photos

Viewing photos on your iPod color display
To see photos on your iPod color display, follow these steps:
1. On the iPod, select the Photos menu from the main menu.
2. Select either Photo Library or the album name in the Photos menu.
Photo Library displays thumbnail images of all the photos in your iPod.
Selecting an album displays thumbnail images of only the photos
assigned to that album.
3. Use the scroll wheel to highlight the photo thumbnail you want, and
press the Select button.
You may have several screens of thumbnails — use the scroll wheel to
scroll through photo thumbnails in a screen and over several screens, or
use the Next/Fast-forward and Previous/Rewind buttons to skip to the
next or previous screen. When you select a photo thumbnail, your iPod
color display fills up with the photo you selected.
If you previously connected the iPod Camera Connector to your color-display
iPod, you can use the Photo Import function in the Photos menu. Select Photo
Import to see the photos you’ve imported using the iPod Camera Connector —
the photos are organized into albums named as film rolls (Roll#1, Roll#2, and
so on). Select a roll and choose Browse in the Roll menu to view your imported
photos.
Connecting to a television 
or to video equipment
You can connect your color-display iPod to any television that offers standard
RCA video and audio connections, or an S-video connection. Color-display
iPods are supplied with the iPod AV Cable, a special cable you can plug into
the headphone connection of the color-display iPod, or to the line-out con-
nection on the dock supplied with the iPod. (You must use a color-display
iPod dock; other docks do not support video out.) The cable offers RCA
video (yellow) and stereo audio (red and white) connectors to plug into your
television or video equipment. You must use the AV Cable supplied with your
iPod — Apple warns that others won’t work.
For even better picture quality, you can use a television monitor that supports
S-video, and your color-display iPod dock. Plug a standard S-video cable into
the dock’s S-video connection, and plug the other end into your television’s 
S-video connection. Plug the supplied AV Cable into the color-display iPod head-
phone or dock line-out connection, and the AV Cable stereo audio connectors
330
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

(but not the yellow video connector) into the television. For better sound,
plug the AV Cable stereo audio connectors into a stereo system with good
speakers.
You can set your color-display iPod to play slideshows on your television. If you
don’t see a picture on your television, check to be sure your television is set to
the correct input source — video in (RCA) or S-video in (if you use an S-video
cable and a color-display iPod dock). You can also use other types of video
equipment; for example, a video recorder that accepts RCA or S-video input can
record the slideshow, and a video projector can display it on a large screen.
Setting up and playing a slideshow 
Slideshows are a far more entertaining way of showing photos, because you
can include music and transitions between each pair of photos. You can dis-
play your slideshow on the iPod color display or on a television. Your
slideshow settings work with any photo album or with the entire photo
library on your iPod.
To set up a slideshow, follow these steps:
1. On your color-display iPod, select Photos from the main menu, and
Slideshow Settings from the Photos menu.
2. Select Time Per Slide from the Slideshow Settings menu to set the
duration of each slide.
You can select choices ranging from 2 to 20 seconds, or Manual to set
the slideshow to advance to the next slide only when you click the iPod
Next/Fast-forward button.
3. Pick music to play by selecting Music from the Slideshow Settings
menu, and selecting a playlist.
You can choose any playlist in your iPod, including the On-The-Go
playlist, or the Now Playing choice, to play along with your slideshow.
You can also choose to play the music set in iPhoto (if you’re using a
Mac) — iPhoto lets you assign an iTunes playlist to an iPhoto album,
and that assignment is saved in your iPod — if the playlist has been
copied to your iPod, it is automatically assigned to the slideshow.
4. Select a transition to use between photos in the slideshow by choosing
Transitions in the Slideshow Settings menu.
Wipe across is our favorite, but you can select versions of the standard
Wipe and Push transitions including Push across, Push down, Wipe
down, and Wipe center. Choose Random if you want to use a randomly
different transition for each photo change. Choose Off for no transition.
331
Chapter 24: Transferring and Viewing Photos

5. To TV or not TV? Set the color-display iPod to display the slideshow
on a TV, or to ask first, by choosing TV Out from the Slideshow
Settings menu.
You have three choices for TV Out: On, Ask, or Off. 
• On displays the slideshow on a television (through the video out
connection). You can also see the slides in large thumbnail form on
your iPod color display, along with the number of the photo within
the album or library, and Next and Previous icons. 
• Ask displays a screen first, asking you to select TV Off or TV On, so
that you can make the choice each time you play a slideshow. 
• Off displays the slideshow with full-sized images on the iPod color
display.
6. Select other options from the Slideshow Settings menu: Repeat,
Shuffle Photos, and TV Signal.
Choose Repeat and select On to repeat the slideshow over and over, or
Off to turn off repeating. Choose Shuffle Photos and select On to shuffle
photos in the slideshow in a random order, or Off to turn off random
shuffling. If traveling or living outside the U.S., choose TV Signal to
change your television signal to PAL for European and other countries
that use PAL as the video standard, or to NTSC for the U.S. standard.
To play a slideshow, follow these steps:
1. Optional: If you want to display the slideshow on a television, connect
the color-display iPod to the television first.
2. On your iPod, select Photos from the main menu.
3. Highlight an album name or Photo Library from the Photos menu, and
press the Play/Pause button.
Highlighting Photo Library first includes the entire library in the
slideshow; highlighting an album includes only the photos in that album. 
You can also start a slideshow by pressing the Select button when you
are viewing a photo on the iPod color display.
4. If you set TV Out to Ask, choose TV On or TV Off for your slideshow.
TV On displays the slideshow on a television (through the video out
connection). You can also see the slides in large thumbnail form on the
iPod color display. TV Off displays the slideshow with full-sized images
on the iPod color display.
332
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

5. Use the iPod buttons to navigate your slideshow.
If you set Time Per Slide to Manual, use the Next/Fast-forward and
Previous/Rewind buttons to move through the slideshow. Next/Fast-
forward moves to the next photo in the slideshow, and Previous/
Rewind moves to the previous photo.
If you set Timer Per Slide to a duration, use Play/Pause to pause and
play the slideshow.
6. Press the Menu button to stop the slideshow and return to the 
Photos menu.
Transferring Photos from a Camera 
to an iPod Hard Drive 
You can still make an iPod useful for photo work even if you don’t have a
color-display iPod. With full-size iPods that have a dock connector, including
color-display iPods, you can use an accessory to temporarily store photos
from digital camera memory cards at full resolution, so that you can later
import the photos into your computer.
If you’re traveling with just your digital camera and your iPod, you can shoot
all the pictures you want without worrying about filling up your camera’s
memory card. Shoot all the pictures you want, and then connect the camera
to your iPod with an accessory such as the Belkin Media Reader for iPod, and
transfer the photos to your iPod hard drive. Then delete the pictures from
your camera’s memory card and go snap some more. You could travel for
weeks on end, shooting thousands of photos in locations around the world
without running out of space in your iPod.
The key to these capabilities is the fact that the iPod serves as an external
hard drive. After you mount the iPod on your Mac or Windows desktop, you
can use it as a hard drive.
The Belkin Media Reader for iPod connects to the iPod’s dock connection
transfers photos quickly to the Photos folder on your iPod hard drive. Your
iPod can hold hundreds or even thousands of photos (depending on how much
music is already stored on it). Available from the Apple Store, the Belkin
accessory works only with full-size iPod models with dock connectors.
333
Chapter 24: Transferring and Viewing Photos

With the Belkin Media Reader and a color-display iPod (updated with iPod
Software 1.1 or newer), you can browse photos you just imported without
having to synchronize the iPod with your computer. It works just like the
iPod Camera Connector. (See “Transferring photos with the iPod Camera
Connector” in this chapter.)
To transfer the photos to the iPhoto library on a Mac, mount the iPod as a
hard drive, as we describe in Chapter 23. Then import the photos by drag-
ging the files directly from the iPod hard drive and dropping them over the
iPhoto window. To transfer the photos to a Windows photo application such
as Adobe Photo Album or Photo Elements, drag the files or the entire Photos
folder directly from the iPod hard drive into a folder on your hard drive, and
open them with the photo application.

 Storing contacts in Outlook and Microsoft Address Book (Windows or Mac)
Your iPod is capable of helping you manage your activities on the road to
the point where it competes in some respects with personal digital assis-
tants (PDAs). You can manage your address book, calendar, and To-Do list for
the road all on your computer, and then update or synchronize your iPod to
have all the information that you need for viewing and playback. As a result,
you might not ever need an additional PDA — especially if you prefer typing
data into your computer before loading it into the device. Your iPod is a
player — not just in the world of music, but also in the world of personal 
productivity.
The most likely bit of information that you might need on the road is a phone
number, an address, or information related to an event or calendar appoint-
ment. Your iPod can store your personal information right alongside your
music so that the information is available at your fingertips. After entering
and managing your personal information on your computer, you can then
copy the information to your iPod or synchronize with information already
on your iPod.
The iPod accepts industry-standard iCalendar and vCalendar files for calen-
dars and To-Do lists, which you can export from most applications that offer
calendars and To-Do lists. It also accepts industry-standard vCards, or virtual
business cards, which are records containing contact information for people,
including physical addresses, e-mail addresses, phone numbers, and so on.
Again, most applications that offer address books or contact lists can export
vCards.
If you’re a Mac user, you have it easy: You can use the free iCal and Address
Book applications and automatically synchronize the information with your
iPod calendar and contact list with iTunes; see Chapter 26. Mac users can also
choose other applications and export (or drag) the information to your iPod.

If you’re a Windows user, you have a variety of choices for managing contacts
and calendar information, and you also have choices of third-party utilities
for putting the information on an iPod, as well as the tried-and-true technique
of exporting (or dragging) information to the iPod.
This chapter shows you how to enter your personal information into the
computer by using Address Book and iCal (on a Mac) or Microsoft Outlook
and Microsoft Address Book (on a Windows PC).
Keeping Appointments 
with iCal on the Mac
iCal, the free desktop calendar application that you can download from Apple’s
software download page (www.info.apple.com/support/downloads.html),
creates calendars that you can copy to your iPod. iCal requires Mac OS X ver-
sion 10.2.3 or newer. You can create custom calendars for different activities,
such as home, office, road tours, exercise and diet schedules, mileage logs,
and so on. You can view them separately or all together. After editing your
calendars on the Mac, you can synchronize your iPod to have the same calen-
dars as we describe in Chapter 26.
If you use another application to manage your personal calendar, you might
still want to use iCal just to transfer your calendar information to the iPod
painlessly. You can import calendars from other applications that support
the iCal or vCal format, such as Microsoft Entourage, Microsoft Outlook, and
Palm Desktop. When your information is in iCal, you can synchronize your
entire calendar with your iPod using iTunes.
Launch iCal by double-clicking the iCal application or clicking its icon in the
Mac OS X Dock. iCal displays a calendar, as shown in Figure 25-1, and you can
switch the view from an entire month to just one week or one day by clicking
the Day or Week buttons at the bottom of the window.
iCal starts you off with two calendars: Home and Work. Their names have check
marks next to them in the upper-left corner of the iCal window, indicating that
both are visible, and they’re merged into the calendar view. To see only your
Home calendar, deselect the Work option in the Calendars pane on the left, and
vice versa. It’s easy to set up appointments and events for either calendar.
336
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

Setting up an appointment or event
Some appointments and events are a drag, and some are fun, but either way
you can drag your mouse to create one. Click the Week button at the bottom
of the window to see just an entire week, and then click and drag over a period
of time to create an appointment. You can choose File➪New Event to do the
same thing.
To see the details of an event or appointment, do one of these things:
 Double-click the event or appointment.
 Click the event or appointment to select it, and then click the “i” button
in the lower-right corner.
 Click the event or appointment to select it, and then choose
Window➪Show Info.
The detail for the event or appointment appears in the info drawer that sticks
out on the right side of the iCal window, as shown in Figure 25-2.
Figure 25-1:

337
Chapter 25: Getting Personal

In the info drawer, you can type over the filler “New Event” and “location”
text, change the date and time, add attendees, specify the status and whether
the event or appointment should be repeated, and so on. You can type a note
in the Notes section at the bottom and assign the event to a specific calendar
(in this case, the Home calendar). If you have created custom calendars within
iCal (as we describe in “Creating a custom calendar”), select the calendar
that you want to add the event to from the Calendar pop-up menu. You can
set the event to automatically repeat every day, week, month, or year by
using the Repeat pop-up menu.
Need to be reminded? Set an alarm for an event in iCal by selecting an option
from the Alarm pop-up menu. If you select the Message with Sound option,
the alarm works with your iPod when you synchronize your calendar with
your iPod, as we describe in Chapter 26.
Adding a To-Do item
If you’re petrified like the White Rabbit in Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland with
so little time and so much to do, iCal can keep track of your To-Do list. Click
the thumbtack icon to view the To Do items pane of the iCal window (or
choose Window➪Show To Dos). Choose File➪New To Do to add an item to
the list. 
You can set the priority of the To-Do item so that it sorts to the top (highest
priority) or bottom (no priority) of the To-Do list. You can also set its due
date in the Due Date pop-up menu — if you set a due date, the alarm pop-up
appears so that you can also set an alarm for the To-Do item. (The alarm also

drawer.
338
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

works in your iPod when you synchronize your calendar with your iPod.) iCal
lets you assign the To-Do item to a specific calendar and even add a Web
address to the URL field to link the To-Do item to a Web page. To mark a To-
Do item as finished, select the Completed option for the item.
Creating a custom calendar
You can create custom calendars in iCal that show only the events that are
assigned to the custom calendar. For example, you might create one custom
calendar for work events, another for family events, another for an exercise
plan, and so on. Your custom calendars are maintained by iCal so that you
can see them all at once or individually in the calendar view. The list of
custom calendars appears in the top-left corner of the iCal window, with a
check box next to each calendar. When you select the check box, the custom
calendar’s events show up in the calendar view. If you select more than one
custom calendar, the events from all selected custom calendars are merged
in the calendar view.

Chapter 25: Getting Personal
iPod as PDA: You can play, but you can’t type
We could never get used to tiny portable com-
puters and PDAs. We use computers for all our
information needs, but we’ve never really gone
smaller than a laptop because the keyboards on
smaller devices are too small for touch-typists.
People who use the hunt-and-peck method of
typing can quickly adapt to using forefingers
and thumbs or a stylus to type reasonably well
on a cell phone or PDA. However, PDAs can be
hard to use for people who are trained to hold
their hands a certain way and touch-type with
all fingers.
There’s true irony in this. The original reason for
the QWERTY arrangement of keys on the key-
board, standard to this day, was to slow down
the human typist and place commonly used
letter combinations on opposite sides of the
keyboard so that the mechanical arms of the
typewriter wouldn’t jam. Efforts to change this
during the computer age were ignored even if
they did allow for increased typing speed and
higher productivity. People assimilated the orig-
inal arrangement and learned to type quickly
with it, and they simply refused to change.
Small keyboards and clumsy human interfaces
hamper the use of PDAs for input, raising the
question for the laptop users: “Why bother?”
Laptops (and possibly the new tablet comput-
ers) are excellent for input and organizing infor-
mation. Besides, if you use more than one
device to enter input, you run the risk of being
out of sync — most often you end up acciden-
tally overwriting the new stuff put into the PDA
with the stuff from your laptop.
A Mac laptop and iPod combo is our answer to
this dilemma. We input and edit all information
with a Mac laptop and update the iPod as nec-
essary. We can then take the iPod into situa-
tions in which we need to view but not change
the information. And we don’t need PDAs —
except to play with as gadget freaks.

To create a custom calendar, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪New Calendar, or click the plus (+) button in the bottom-
left corner of the iCal window.
An Untitled item appears in the list of calendars in the top-left corner.
2. Type a new name for the Untitled item.
Click inside the Name text box and type a new name.
3. Turn on or off the custom calendar.
Deselect the custom calendar if you don’t want its events to be displayed.
Select it to display the custom calendar along with other selected custom
calendars (merged with the other custom calendar events).
Keeping Appointments 
with Microsoft Outlook
Microsoft Outlook is offered as part of Microsoft Office (Windows version), and
Microsoft Outlook Express is offered free with Windows. In addition, a Mac ver-
sion of Outlook is available from Microsoft. You can use any of these applica-
tions to create calendars and export the calendar information to your iPod.
Outlook provides extensive calendar and scheduling functions and task man-
agement. You need only a fraction of Outlook’s features to keep a calendar
and To-Do list that can be viewed on your iPod. Many of the more advanced
functions, such as scheduling conferences and meetings to coincide with 
the schedules of other people on a network, have no meaning on an iPod.
Nevertheless, the iPod is useful for viewing the results of Outlook activity. If
you use those features, any event, appointment, or meeting that displays in
your Outlook calendar is also copied to your iPod along with the calendar.
With your calendar and To-Do tasks set up in Outlook, you can export the
information to your iPod, as we describe in Chapter 26.
Setting up an appointment or event
To set up an appointment or event in Microsoft Outlook, first launch Outlook,
and then follow these steps:
340
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

1. Click the Calendar icon and click any time slot to select it in the
Outlook calendar.
The time slots in the Outlook calendar, as shown in Figure 25-3, appear
when you click the Calendar icon.
2. Choose File➪New➪Appointment to create an appointment or event,
and then fill in the information.
Alternatively, you can right-click the selected time slot and choose New
Appointment (or choose New Recurring Appointment for appointments
that repeat often). Specify start and end times and a location, as shown
in Figure 25-4. 
3. Click the Save and Close button to save the appointment or event.

Adding a To-Do task
The outlook for your future plans might be bright, but you need more than a
crystal ball to keep them that way. If you already use Outlook for your e-mail
and calendar functions, you might also want to use it to keep track of your
To-Do list.
To create a To-Do task in Outlook, choose New➪Task, and type a subject
name for the task. To make the task a recurring task, select the Recurrence
option and choose a frequency (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, or Yearly) for the
recurring task. Finally, click the Save and Close button to save the task.
Storing Contacts in the Mac OS X
Address Book 
Address Book, a free application that’s provided with OS X for the Mac, has
just about all the features you could ever want for storing names, addresses,
phone numbers, e-mail addresses, and physical addresses. You can drag and
drop addresses and phone numbers from incoming e-mails to avoid having to
type the information, and you can wirelessly copy cards from your address
book to cell phones, PDAs, and other Bluetooth-enabled devices. Keeping
your iPod synchronized with your addresses and phone numbers is simple
and automatic. You can then have your friends’ addresses and phone num-
bers with you at all times, right on your iPod.
If you use some other application for storing contact information, you might
want to use Address Book in addition to your other application so you can
import contact information from other applications that support vCards or
the LDIF format. (LDIF is the file format for LDAP, which stands for Lightweight
Directory Access Protocol.) To do so, launch Address Book and choose
File➪Import, select the format that you used from the submenu, and select
the file that contains the exported information. Once your information is in
Address Book, you can synchronize the information with your iPod, eliminat-
ing the hassle of dragging vCards to the iPod individually.
Adding and editing contact information
Launch Address Book by double-clicking the Address Book application or by
clicking its icon in the Mac OS X Dock. To add a new card, follow these steps:
342
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

1. Choose File➪New Card or click the plus (+) button at the bottom of the
Name pane.
A new blank card appears, ready for you to add information.
2. Type the person’s first and last name over the placeholder first and last
name text boxes, and add contact information to the other text boxes.
You can type addresses, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, and so on, as
shown in Figure 25-5. To add multiple addresses, phone numbers, or
other text boxes, click the tiny plus (+) icon next to each type of infor-
mation to add more. If some of the text boxes don’t apply, skip them,
and they won’t show up in the edited card. You can even enter a two-line
address by pressing Return to continue to the second line.
3. To save your changes, click the Edit button, and Address Book saves 
the edits.
To edit a card, select the person in the Name pane and click the Edit button.
To save your changes, click the Edit button again, and Address Book saves
the edits.
You can also add new people to your address book from the Mail program by
selecting an e-mail message and choosing Message➪Add Sender to Address
Book. You can then open Address Book, click the name in the Name pane,
and click the Edit button to edit the person’s card. Choosing Add to Address
Book in the Mail program From field’s contextual menu adds the address and
opens the card for editing in Address Book.
If you receive a vCard as an e-mail attachment (with the .vcf extension), you
can simply drag the attachment to your Address Book window to add the
vCard to your address book. Wouldn’t it be nice if all your friends sent you
vCards to keep you up to date, and you never had to retype the information? 
Figure 25-5:

Book.
343
Chapter 25: Getting Personal

Be careful with vCards from unknown persons — vCards can carry viruses.
Merging cards
One of the coolest features of Address Book is its ability to merge cards. You
might occasionally end up with multiple cards for the same person in
Address Book, typically by saving the sender’s e-mail address from the Mail
application while also dragging a vCard from the same person. To fix that,
you can hold down Shift and click cards in the Name pane to select the ones
that you want to combine. Then choose Card➪Merge Cards. Address Book
creates a new card that combines all the unique information. You can then
delete the excess cards.
Searching in Address Book
Can’t find the person you’re looking for? Address Book lets you search for
any text in any of the text boxes of any card. If you’re searching for a person,
and all you have is part of a phone number or even just part of the person’s
name, type the text in the Search text box at the top-right corner of the
Address Book window. As you type, Address Book displays the names of the
people who have the text fragment anywhere in their cards. Address Book
searches all the information on the cards, including the Notes text box, and it
searches fast, displaying names immediately. If more than one matching card
is found, click the arrow buttons at the bottom of the window to switch
between the cards. Or, choose View➪Card And Columns to see a list of all the
cards. To see all your cards again, delete the text from the Search text box.
Managing contacts in groups
You can combine address cards in Address Book into a group to make it easy
to select all the addresses at once. For example, you might want to group
together all your local friends or all your co-workers. You can then send an
e-mail to all of them at once by choosing the group as the e-mail recipient.
You can also use a group to keep track of a subset of contacts. For example,
you might want only a subset of your contact list on your iPod rather than
the entire list. To do this, create a group for the subset of contacts and export
the group as a single vCard file that you can then use on your iPod.

Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

To create a group of contacts in Address Book
1. Click the plus (+) sign at the bottom of the Group pane.
Address Book creates a new entry in the Group column with a high-
lighted text box so that you can type a new name for the group.
2. Type a name for the group.
3. Select the All item in the Group pane to see your entire list of names.
4. Drag and drop names over the group name to add them to your new
group.
After creating a new group, you can see the names in the group by clicking
the group name in the Group pane. Select the All item in the Group pane to
see all the names in the address book.
To put your addresses on the iPod, you can export a vCard file to the iPod
Contacts folder or use iTunes, as we describe in Chapter 26.
Storing Contacts in Microsoft 
Address Book or Outlook
Microsoft Outlook, provided with the Windows version of Microsoft Office,
provides extensive features for managing contacts with e-mail and address
information. You can also import address books and contact information into
Outlook from programs such as Eudora, Lotus Organizer, Netscape
Messenger, Microsoft Mail, or Microsoft Schedule+.
Outlook actually uses another application, Microsoft Address Book, to store
the contact information. Microsoft Address Book lets you gather address books
from other sources, including Microsoft Exchange Server and Internet direc-
tory services (depending on how you’ve set up Outlook). It also includes all the
contacts in your Outlook Contacts folder. When you update the information in
your Outlook Contacts folder, the Microsoft Address Book is updated as well,
so you can make all your changes in the Outlook Contacts folder.
To create a contact in Outlook, which saves the contact information in
Microsoft Address Book, launch Outlook and then follow these steps:
1. Click the Contacts icon to open the Contacts folder.
The Contacts icon appears in the Outlook Shortcuts pane on the left of
the Outlook display; refer to Figure 25-3.
345
Chapter 25: Getting Personal

2. Choose New➪Contact, and then type a name for the contact.
The Contact window appears (Windows version). To enter multiple entries
for a text box, such as more than one physical address or e-mail address,
click the down-arrow next to the text box to display more lines for that text
box. Enter all the information you want (or as little as you want).
3. Click Save and Close to save the contact. 
Your contacts are displayed in the Contact window of Outlook.
You can also create a new contact automatically for the sender of an e-mail
message that you receive. Open the e-mail message, and in the From text box,
right-click the name that you want to add to your Contacts folder, and then
choose Add to Contacts.
You can export the contact information from Microsoft Outlook (and Microsoft
Address Book) to your iPod, and for more on that, flip to Chapter 26.

W
e chose the iPod for music, but we also find it useful while traveling
for viewing the personal information — contacts, appointments,
events, and To-Do tasks — that we manage on our computers.
If you’ve already read Chapter 25, you know how to manage your calendar
activities and your contacts on your computer. In fact, you’re probably knee-
deep in vCards (virtual business cards) for your Address Book, and the calen-
dars in your vCalendar files look like they were drawn up in the West Wing.
Information changes often, and new information accumulates quickly, but
you’re well armed with an iPod that can be kept up to date. This chapter
shows you how to synchronize your iPod to have all the information that you
need for viewing and playback. We also show you how to simply copy the
information to your iPod to update it.
Synchronizing with Mac 
Calendars and Contacts
Chances are that you make a lot of changes to addresses, phone numbers,
calendar events, and To-Do lists on your Mac. Even though you can update
your iPod with this information manually, remembering to copy each file you
need is difficult. iTunes version 4.8 and newer versions can perform this func-
tion automatically and keep all your information updated on your iPod. 

To synchronize your iPod with calendars in iCal on a Mac, follow these steps:
1. Connect your iPod to the Mac.
iTunes launches automatically.
2. Select the iPod name in the iTunes Source pane.
3. Click the iPod Options button on the bottom-right side of the iTunes
window, or click the iPod button in the iTunes Preferences window.
The iPod Options button appears only when an iPod is connected and
selected in the Source pane. You can also choose iTunes➪Preferences
and click the iPod button — whether or not the iPod is selected in the
Source pane (although it has to be connected). The iPod preferences
pane appears.
4. Click the Calendars button to view the iPod Calendars preferences.
The iPod Calendars preferences pane appears, as shown in Figure 26-1. 
5. Select the “Synchronize iCal calendars” option.
A check mark appears next to the option after you select it.
Figure 26-1:

6. Select the “Synchronize all calendars” option, or select the “Synchronize
selected calendars only” option and pick calendars to synchronize.
You can synchronize all calendars in iCal, or just those you click to add a
check mark.
After setting the iPod Calendars preferences, every time you connect your
iPod, iTunes goes to work synchronizing your iPod with your calendars 
automatically.
To synchronize your iPod with contacts in Address Book on a Mac, follow
these steps:
1. Connect your iPod to the Mac.
iTunes launches automatically.
2. Select the iPod name in the iTunes Source pane.
3. Click the iPod Options button on the bottom-right side of the iTunes
window, or click the iPod button in the iTunes Preferences window.
4. Click the Contacts button to view the iPod Contacts preferences.
The iPod Contacts preferences pane appears, as shown in Figure 26-2.

5. Select the “Synchronize Address Book contacts” option.
A check mark appears next to the option after you select it.
6. Select the “Synchronize all contacts” option, or select the “Synchronize
selected groups only” option and pick groups to synchronize.
You can synchronize all contacts in Address Book, or just groups of 
contacts by clicking to add a check mark to each group.
After setting the iPod Contacts preferences, every time you connect your iPod,
iTunes synchronizes your iPod with your Address Book contacts automatically.
After you finish synchronizing and otherwise using your iPod with your Mac,
be sure to eject the iPod (by dragging the iPod icon to the Trash, or in OS X
10.3 or newer, by clicking the Eject icon next to the iPod icon in the Finder
Sidebar) before disconnecting it. If you forget this, your iPod’s hard drive
might freeze up, and you might need to reset your iPod — find out how in
Chapter 1.
After updating and ejecting the iPod, you can view your addresses and phone
numbers by choosing Extras➪Contacts, and then choosing a name.
You can look at your calendars by choosing Extras➪Calendars, and then
choosing a calendar or All. Use the scroll wheel to scroll through the days of
the calendar, and the Select button to select a day. You can then use the
Select button to select an event to see the event’s details. Use the Next and
Previous buttons to skip to the next or previous month. To see your To-Do
list, choose Extras➪Calendars➪To Do.
If your calendar events use alarms, you can turn on the iPod’s calendar
alarms. Choose Extras➪Calendars and select Alarms in the Calendars menu
once to set the alarm to Beep, or once again to set it to Silent (so that only
the message for the alarm appears), or one more time to set it to Off. The
Alarms choices cycle from Beep to Silent to Off and then back to Beep.
Synchronizing Microsoft 
Outlook (Windows)
Third-party programs are available for Windows iPod users that will automat-
ically synchronize your iPod with contacts and calendar info from Microsoft
Outlook.
350
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

For example, iPodSync (available at http://www.ipod-sync.com/) is a util-
ity for Windows that lets you keep your Outlook calendar, contacts, and To-
Do tasks synchronized between your PC and your iPod.
iPodSync displays a row of icons along the top of its window. The icons repre-
sent different types of information that you can synchronize with your iPod.
These include contacts from the Outlook Contacts folder (Microsoft Address
Book), calendar appointments and events from the Outlook Calendar, and To-
Do tasks from Outlook Tasks. Click an icon to choose the type of information
(such as Contacts), and then modify your choice with the options available
(such as including birthdays in the notes field for contacts). When everything
is set, click the Sync iPod button to automatically synchronize your iPod.
iPodSync exports contacts into a single vCard file for your iPod Contacts
folder and exports calendar information for the iPod Calendar folder.
Outlook can export contacts and calendar information, but it’s a tedious
process of exporting each contact and appointment individually. This failing
of Outlook opens a window of opportunity for entrepreneurs, and several util-
ities and applications provide a way to export contacts and calendar data all
at once. The following are samples of enterprising shareware utilities:
 OutPod at http://outpod.stoer.de. This utility lets you export con-
tact and calendar information in bulk from Microsoft Outlook to vCard
and vCalendar files, which you can then drag to the iPod, as we describe
in “Adding Calendars Manually” and “Adding Contacts Manually” in this
chapter. 
 EphPod at www.ephpod.com. This utility lets you update your iPod with
contacts from Outlook. EphPod is a full-featured Windows application
that you can use in place of MusicMatch Jukebox. It supports standard
WinAmp (.m3u) playlists and can synchronize the iPod with a library of
music files. It imports Microsoft Outlook contacts and lets you create
and edit your own contacts. EphPod can also download the latest news,
weather, eBooks, and movie listings to an iPod. If you’re using MusicMatch,
a companion Web site is available at www.dummies.com/go/ipod.
Adding Calendars Manually
If you use your iPod as a hard drive, as we describe in Chapter 23, you can
copy calendar files directly to the Calendars folder on your iPod. You can
copy industry-standard iCalendar or vCalendar files, which can be exported
by many applications including Microsoft Entourage, Microsoft Outlook, and
Palm Desktop.
351
Chapter 26: Synchronizing Information with Your iPod

In most cases, you can drag an iCalendar file (with the filename extension
.ics) or a vCalendar file (with the filename extension .vcs) to your iPod
Calendars folder. For example, you can copy iCalendar files saved from
Microsoft Outlook into the Calendars folder using Windows Explorer, as
shown in Figure 26-3.
To save calendar information in the iCalendar format from Microsoft Outlook,
you must save each appointment separately as an ICS (iCalendar) file. Select
the appointment in the calendar view or open the appointment by double-
clicking it. Use the Save As command and select iCalendar from the Save As
Type pop-up menu, and then select a destination for the ICS file. The destina-
tion can be a folder on your hard drive, or it can be the iPod’s Calendars
folder. If you select a folder on your hard drive, be sure to copy the files to
the iPod’s Calendars folder.
Some applications, such as Microsoft Entourage for the Mac, don’t offer a con-
venient way to export calendar information (except perhaps by dragging each
appointment or event onto the desktop). However, iCal for the Mac can import
Entourage calendars, so you can import into iCal (choose File➪Import), and then
use iTunes to synchronize your iPod, as we describe earlier in this chapter.
You can look at your calendars on the iPod by choosing Extras➪Calendars➪
All. Select a calendar and then use the scroll wheel to scroll through the days
of the calendar, or select an event to see the event’s details. Press the Next
and Previous buttons to skip to the next or previous month. To see your To-
Do list, choose Extras➪Calendars➪To Do.
Figure 26-3:
Copy

352
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

To remove a calendar from your iPod, connect the iPod to your computer
and enable the iPod as a hard drive; see Chapter 23. You can then open the
Calendars folder on the iPod and delete the calendar file. You can also copy
calendar files from the iPod to your hard drive.
Adding Contacts Manually
If you use your iPod as a hard drive, as we describe in Chapter 23, you can
copy contacts in vCard files directly to the Contacts folder on your iPod.
A vCard, or virtual card, is a standard format for exchanging personal infor-
mation. The iPod sorts and displays contacts in the vCard format — you can
use separate vCard files for each person or use a group vCard file that con-
tains records for many people. 
After enabling the iPod as a hard drive, simply export your contacts as vCards
directly into the Contacts folder of your iPod. In most cases, you can drag
vCard-formatted contacts from the application’s address book to the iPod
Contacts folder.
You can copy one card, a group of cards, or even the entire list as a vCard file
(with a .vcf extension) by dragging the vCard file into the Contacts folder.
Contacts must be in the vCard format to use with the iPod.
You can use applications to export vCard files directly to your iPod. For
example, in Microsoft Outlook, you can export a vCard file for a contact
directly into your iPod’s Contacts folder by following these steps: 
1. Choose File➪Export to vCard.
2. Use the Save In drop-down menu in the dialog to select the iPod as the
destination drive. 
3. Then select the Contacts folder to save the contacts file.
As of this writing, the iPod supports only a portion of what you can put into a
vCard. For example, you can include photos and sounds in vCards used by
other applications, but you can’t open up those portions of the vCard by
using the iPod.

Chapter 26: Synchronizing Information with Your iPod

Using Utilities to Copy Files and Music
The iPod has spawned a thriving industry of third-party accessories and
products. Some of the most useful products are utility programs that expand
the capabilities of the iPod or your ability to update the iPod, and even 
full-featured programs that are designed as replacements for iTunes and
MusicMatch Jukebox. With so many programs to check out, you might be
overwhelmed. We’ve selected three of the best programs for the Mac and
Windows (as of this writing). Again, if using MusicMatch, see this book’s 
companion Web site at www.dummies.com/go/ipod.
Keep in mind, with programs that allow music copying functions, that copy-
ing copyrighted material to other computers without permission is illegal.
Don’t steal music — or anything else, for that matter.
Mac utilities
On the Mac, third-party offerings have focused on extending the capabilities
of the iPod and its software to do things like copying music from the iPod to
the computer and updating the iPod with contacts and calendar information.
Take a glance at the following examples:
 iPod It at www.zapptek.com/ipod-it/. With this software, you can
transfer personal information to your iPod from Entourage, Stickies,
Mail, Address Book, and iCal. You can even download weather forecasts
and news headlines directly to your iPod.
 iPod Access at www.findleydesigns.com/ipodaccess. This utility lets
you transfer songs from an iPod to a Mac. iPod Access is available from
Findley Designs, Inc.
 iPodRip at www.thelittleappfactory.com/software/ipodrip.php.
This third-party utility, available from The Little App Factory, lets you
transfer music from your iPod back to your iTunes library and listen to
music on your iPod through your computer (saving hard drive space). It
supports all iPod song formats including MP3, AAC, Protected AAC, and
Audible.com books.
Windows utilities
On Windows, third-party offerings fill a void left by the lack of synchroniza-
tion capabilities in iTunes that work with Microsoft Outlook. Lots more third-
party programs exist for Windows, and they do everything from extending
354
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

the capabilities of the iPod and updating contacts and calendar information
to replacing the need for MusicMatch Jukebox and iTunes.
 iPodSync at www.ipod-sync.com/. Keep Microsoft Outlook calendars,
contacts, tasks, and notes synchronized between a Windows PC and an
iPod. iPodSync exports industry standard vCards for contacts, and uses
the iCalendar format for appointment information. iPodSync can even
synchronize Outlook notes and tasks. For more information, see the
iPodSync Web site.
 EphPod 2 at www.ephpod.com. This shareware utility lets you update
your iPod with contacts from Outlook. It’s a full-featured Windows appli-
cation that can be used in place of MusicMatch Jukebox or iTunes. It
supports standard WinAmp (m3u) playlists and can synchronize the iPod
with a library of music files. It imports Microsoft Outlook contacts and
also lets you create and edit your own contacts. EphPod can also down-
load the latest news, weather, e-books, and movie listings to an iPod. 
 XPlay 2 at www.mediafour.com/products/xplay. This utility, from
Mediafour Corp., provides read and write access to your iPod hard drive
for documents and data files, plus the ability to organize your music
from the Explorer-based XPlay interface or from Windows Media Player,
as an alternative to MusicMatch Jukebox or iTunes. XPlay makes your
iPod appear as a normal drive under Windows for the sharing of data
files, and it makes your songs, playlists, artists, and albums appear in
custom folders in Explorer, so they’re easy to access and manipulate and
organized similarly to how the iPod organizes them. XPlay is available
from Mediafour Corp.

Chapter 27
Updating and Troubleshooting
In This Chapter
 Your first steps for troubleshooting iPod problems
 Updating the iPod system software and firmware for Mac or Windows 
 Restoring an iPod to its original factory condition and settings
T
his chapter describes some of the problems that you might encounter
with your iPod and computer and how to fix them. If your iPod fails to
turn on, or if your computer fails to recognize it, you can most likely find a
solution here.
This chapter also covers updating the firmware and software on your iPod,
and restoring your iPod to its factory default condition. (Firmware is software
encoded in hardware.) That last option is a drastic measure that erases any
music or information on the iPod, but it usually solves the problem if nothing
else does.
First Troubleshooting Steps
Problems can arise with electronics and software that can prevent the iPod
from turning on at all or from turning on properly with all its music and
playlists. You can also have problems in the connection between your iPod
and your computer.
When you turn on your iPod, built-in startup diagnostic software checks the
iPod hard drive for damage and attempts to repair it if necessary. If the iPod
finds an issue when it is turned on, it automatically uses internal diagnostics
to check for and repair any damage. You might see a disk scan icon on your
iPod screen after turning it on, indicating that a problem was fixed. If this
happens, update your iPod firmware and software, as we describe in
“Updating the iPod with the iPod Updater,” later in this chapter.

Checking the Hold switch
If your iPod refuses to turn on, check the position of the Hold switch on top
of the iPod. The Hold switch locks the iPod buttons so that you don’t acci-
dentally activate them. Slide the Hold switch away from the headphone con-
nection, hiding the orange layer, to unlock the buttons. (If you see the orange
layer underneath one end of the Hold switch, the switch is still in the locked
position.)
Checking the power
Got power? The battery might not be charged enough. If the battery is too
low for normal operation, the iPod doesn’t turn on. Instead, a low battery
screen appears for about three seconds, and then disappears. At that point,
your only choice is to connect the iPod to an AC power source, wait for a
moment, and then turn the power on by pushing any button on the iPod. If
your source of AC power is your computer (using the FireWire connection),
make sure that the computer is on and not set to go to sleep. The battery
icon in the upper-right corner of the display indicates whether it’s full or
recharging. For more information about maintaining a healthy battery, see
Chapter 1.
If your iPod shuffle doesn’t turn on or respond, recharge its battery by con-
necting it to the USB connection on your computer.
Resetting the iPod
This operation resets the operating system of the iPod and restarts the
system. Sometimes when your iPod gets confused or refuses to turn on, you
can fix it by resetting it. 
For current fourth-generation iPod models including iPod mini, iPod U2
Special Edition, and color-display iPod, follow these steps:
1. Connect the iPod to a power outlet using the AC power adapter.
2. Toggle the Hold switch.
Push the Hold switch to hold (lock), and then set it back to unlock.
3. Press the Menu and Select buttons simultaneously and hold for at
least six seconds or until the Apple logo appears; then release the but-
tons when you see the Apple logo.
The appearance of the Apple logo signals that your iPod is resetting
itself, so you no longer have to hold down the buttons.
358
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

It’s important to release the Menu and Select buttons as soon as you see the
Apple logo. If you continue to hold down the buttons after the logo appears,
the iPod displays the low battery icon, and you must connect it to a power
source before using your iPod again.
For first, second, and third generation iPod models, follow these steps:
1. Connect the iPod to a power outlet using the AC power adapter.
2. Toggle the Hold switch.
Push the Hold switch to hold (lock), and then set it back to unlock.
3. Press the Menu and Play/Pause buttons simultaneously and hold for
at least five seconds until the Apple logo appears; then release the
buttons when you see the Apple logo.
The appearance of the Apple logo signals that your iPod is resetting
itself, so you no longer have to hold down the buttons.
It’s important to release the Menu and Play/Pause buttons as soon as you see
the Apple logo. If you continue to hold down the buttons after the logo
appears, the iPod displays the low battery icon, and you must connect it to a
power source before using your iPod again.
To reset your iPod shuffle, disconnect it from a computer, switch the slider
on the back to the Off position — the green stripe under the switch should
not visible. Wait five seconds, and then switch the slider back to the Shuffle
songs or Play in order position.
After resetting, everything should be back to normal, including your music
and data files.
Draining the iPod battery
Certain types of battery-powered devices sometimes run into problems if the
battery hasn’t drained in a while. In rare cases, the iPod might go dark and
can’t be reset until the battery is drained. If the above steps didn’t resolve the
issue, disconnect the iPod from any power source and leave it disconnected
for approximately 24 hours. After this period, connect it to power and reset.
Try to keep the iPod at room temperature — generally near 68 degrees
Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius), but you can use iPod anywhere between 50
to 95 degrees Fahrenheit (10 and 35 degrees Celsius). If you have left the iPod
in the cold, let it warm up to room temperature before waking it from sleep.
Otherwise, a low-battery icon might appear, and the iPod won’t wake up
properly. If the iPod doesn’t wake from sleep after warming up, connect the
power adapter and reset the iPod, as we describe in the previous section.
359
Chapter 27: Updating and Troubleshooting

Hitting the panic button
Actually it’s never a good idea to hit the panic button, even if there is one,
but if you have tried the solutions above and your iPod still doesn’t turn on,
check the following:
 Make sure that the iPod is the only device in your FireWire or USB chain.
Although you can connect a FireWire or USB device to another FireWire
or USB device that has a connection, forming a chain, it isn’t a good idea
to do this with an iPod.
 Make sure that you use the FireWire or USB cable that came with your
iPod and that the cable is in good condition.
 Try connecting the iPod to the built-in FireWire or USB connection of a
different computer to see if the symptom persists.
If, after turning on the iPod, all you see on the display is the Apple logo and
iPod name, and the device seems to be restarting over and over, try force-
enabling your iPod as a hard drive. (This is also known as “putting your iPod
into Disk Mode.”) 
For current fourth-generation iPod models including iPod mini, iPod U2
Special Edition, and color-display iPod, follow these steps:
1. Be sure your iPod is charged with power.
If your iPod needs to be recharged, connect it to a power source as
described in Chapter 1.
2. Reset the iPod as described in “Resetting the iPod,” earlier in this
chapter.
3. When the Apple icon appears on the display, immediately press and
hold the Select and Play/Pause buttons until Disk Mode appears on
the iPod display.
4. If your iPod isn’t connected to your computer, disconnect the iPod
from the power adapter and connect it to your computer.
You can now use the iPod Updater to update or restore the iPod — see
“Using iPod Updater” later in this chapter.
If the “Disk Mode” message doesn’t appear, repeat Steps 2 and 3. (You might
need to press the buttons more quickly.) If, after repeating these steps, the
message still doesn’t appear, the iPod might need to be repaired. 
For first-, second-, and third-generation iPod models, follow these steps:
360
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

1. Connect the iPod to your computer’s FireWire or powered USB con-
nection, or to an AC power adapter.
This procedure doesn’t work with older USB connections that don’t pro-
vide power. Make sure the computer is on and isn’t set to go to sleep.
2. Reset the iPod as described in “Resetting the iPod,” earlier in this
chapter.
3. When the Apple icon appears on the display, immediately press and
hold the Previous and Next buttons until the Do not disconnect
message or FireWire icon appears.
4. If your iPod isn’t connected to your computer, disconnect the iPod
from the power adapter and connect it to your computer.
Some iPods show the message OK to Disconnect before you connect
it to the computer. This changes to the Do not disconnect message
after connecting.
You can now use the iPod Updater to update or restore the iPod — see
“Using iPod Updater” later in this chapter.
If the Do not disconnect message or FireWire icon doesn’t appear, repeat
Steps 2 and 3. (You might need to press the buttons more quickly.) If, after
repeating these steps, the message or FireWire icon still doesn’t appear, the
iPod might need to be repaired. 
After using the iPod in Disk Mode, you need to reset the iPod (described in
“Resetting the iPod” earlier in this chapter) to return your iPod to normal
operation.
You can get more information, updated troubleshooting instructions, and
links to the iPod repair site by visiting the Apple support site for the iPod
(www.apple.com/support/ipod/).
Using iPod Updater
The iPod Updater can update the system software that controls the iPod and
can also update the firmware for the iPod’s hard drive, if necessary. The
update doesn’t affect the music or data stored on iPod’s drive. iPod Updater
is provided on the CD-ROM that comes with your iPod. To find out whether a
new version is available for downloading, go to the Apple Web page for the
iPod (www.apple.com/ipod).
361
Chapter 27: Updating and Troubleshooting

If you use MusicMatch Jukebox rather than iTunes on your Windows PC, skip
this and see this book’s companion Web site at www.dummies.com/go/ipod.
If you use a Mac and you’ve turned on the Software Update option in your
System Preferences, Apple automatically informs you of updates to your
Apple software for the Mac, including iTunes, iCal, Address Book, and the
iPod system software. All you need to do is select which updates to down-
load and click the Install button to download them.
Before downloading the iPod Updater from the Apple Web site, make sure
that you pick the appropriate version — Mac or Windows. The iPod Updater
includes updates for all generations of iPods and can detect which iPod 
you have.
Updating the iPod with iPod Updater
Be sure that your iPod has the most recent iPod firmware update installed.
To determine which version of the iPod software is installed on your iPod,
press the Menu button until you see the iPod main menu, and then choose
Settings➪About. (With first-generation and second-generation iPods, choose
Settings➪Info.) You see information next to the word Version that describes
the software version installed on the iPod.
You can also determine the software version on your iPod by using iPod
Updater. Connect the iPod to your computer and launch iPod Updater. The
iPod Updater window appears. The software version appears next to the
Software Version heading. If this version of the iPod Updater application has
a newer software version that it can install on the iPod, you see (needs
update) next to the version number. If not, you see (up to date).
To update the iPod’s firmware and software, follow these steps for both the
Mac and Windows versions:
1. Connect the iPod to your computer.
iTunes opens, and if you set your iPod for automatic update, iTunes syn-
chronizes the iPod with music and playlists from its library. The iTunes
display notifies you when the iTunes music update is complete.
2. Quit iTunes.
On a Mac, quit by choosing iTunes➪Quit iTunes. On a Windows PC,
choose File➪Exit.
3. Launch the iPod Updater application.
On a Mac, this application is located in the Utilities folder, which is in
your Applications folder. On a Windows PC, you can find it under iPod in
the Start menu. The Updater dialog appears, as shown in Figure 27-1
(Windows version).
362
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

4. Click the Update button.
(In Mac OS X, you might need to click the padlock and type an adminis-
trator account name and password first.) If the Update button is grayed
out, the software on the iPod is the same version or a newer version
than the iPod Updater application.
Note: The Update button is grayed out if the iPod isn’t properly format-
ted for Windows. It may be formatted for a Mac. You must use the
Restore button and restore the iPod to its original factory condition,
erasing all music and data, to reformat it for Windows.
5. Follow the instructions to disconnect your iPod and connect it to an
AC power adapter, if required.
Some iPod models need to be disconnected temporarily and connected
to an AC power adapter during the process of updating the software;
others do not. If you see a message asking you to disconnect the iPod,
follow the instructions displayed with the message. Some iPod models
also need to be reconnected to the computer after this process.
The iPod Updater notifies you when the update is finished, and the
Update button is grayed-out, indicating that your iPod no longer needs
an update.
6. When the update is finished, quit iPod Updater.
On a Mac, you can quit by choosing iPod Updater➪Quit iPod Updater.
On a Windows PC, quit by clicking the dialog’s Close button. Refer to
Figure 27-1.
7. Eject the iPod.
When you quit iPod Updater, iTunes might launch again because your
iPod is still connected. You can eject the iPod by clicking the iPod Eject
button in iTunes.
If iTunes doesn’t launch, you can eject the iPod on a Mac clicking the
Eject button next to the iPod name in the Finder or by dragging the iPod
icon to the Trash. On a Windows PC, right-click the iPod name or icon
and choose Eject from the shortcut menu.

Chapter 27: Updating and Troubleshooting

After ejecting the iPod, wait for its display to show the main menu or the OK
to disconnect message. You can then disconnect the iPod from its dock or
disconnect the dock from the computer. Don’t ever disconnect an iPod before
ejecting it. You might have to reset your iPod, which we describe earlier in
this chapter.
Restoring an iPod with iPod Updater
Restoring the iPod erases the iPod’s hard drive and restores the device to its
original factory settings, so make sure that you back up any important data
that you keep stored on your iPod. To replace music that was erased by the
restore operation, synchronize or update your iPod from your computer’s
music library, as we describe in Chapter 10.
To restore an iPod, follow these steps for both the Mac and Windows versions:
1. Connect the iPod to your computer.
If your iPod is working, iTunes opens, and if you set your iPod for auto-
matic update, iTunes synchronizes the iPod with music and playlists
from its library. The iTunes display notifies you when the iTunes music
update is complete. If your iPod isn’t working, skip to Step 3.
2. Quit iTunes.
On a Mac, quit by choosing iTunes➪Quit iTunes. On a Windows PC,
choose File➪Exit.
3. Launch the iPod Updater application.
On a Mac, this application is located in the Utilities folder, which is in
your Applications folder. On a Windows PC, you can find it under iPod
on the Start menu. The Updater dialog appears; refer to Figure 27-1.
4. Click the Restore button.
(In Mac OS X, you might need to click the padlock and type an adminis-
trator account name and password first.) An alert dialog appears to con-
firm you want to restore iPod.
5. Click the Restore button to confirm the restore operation.
A progress bar appears, indicating the progress of the restore operation.
6. Follow the instructions to disconnect your iPod and connect it to an
AC power adapter, if required.
Some iPod models need to be disconnected temporarily and connected
to an AC power adapter after the restore operation and during the
process of updating the software; others do not. If you see a message
364
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

asking you to disconnect the iPod, follow the instructions displayed with
the message. Some iPod models also need to be reconnected to the com-
puter after this process.
The iPod Updater notifies you when the restore is finished, and the
Update button is grayed out, indicating that your iPod no longer needs
an update.
7. When the restore operation is finished, quit iPod Updater.
On a Mac, you can quit by choosing iPod Updater➪Quit iPod Updater.
On a Windows PC, quit by clicking the dialog’s Close button. Refer to
Figure 27-1.
8. Set up your iPod by using the iTunes Setup Assistant.
In the iTunes Setup Assistant dialog, type a name for iPod in the space
provided, and then proceed with setting up iTunes with your iPod, as we
describe in Chapter 2.
9. Quit iTunes Setup Assistant, and update your iPod from your music
library.
When you quit iTunes Setup Assistant, iTunes might launch again
because your iPod is still connected. You can use this opportunity to
update your iPod with the music in your library, as we describe in
Chapter 10. You can also copy data to the iPod while it’s mounted as a
hard drive; see Chapter 23.
10. When you’re finished updating the iPod with music and data, eject 
the iPod.
You can eject the iPod by using the iPod Eject button in iTunes.
If iTunes doesn’t launch, you can eject the iPod on a Mac by clicking the
Eject button next to the iPod name in a Finder window Sidebar or by
dragging the iPod icon to the Trash icon (which turns into an Eject
icon). On a Windows PC, right-click the iPod name or icon and choose
Eject from the shortcut menu.

U
nfortunately, humans and the machines they make are not perfect.
Even though we think the iPod comes as close to perfection as possi-
ble, at some point your iPod isn’t going to work as you expect it to. When
that happens, turn to this chapter. Here we show you how to fix the most
common problems.
How Do I Get My iPod to Wake Up?
If your iPod doesn’t turn on, don’t panic — at least not yet. Try the following
suggestions to get your iPod to respond:
 Check the Hold switch’s position on top of the iPod. The Hold switch
locks the iPod buttons so you don’t accidentally activate them. Slide the
Hold switch away from the headphone connection, hiding the orange
layer, to unlock the buttons.
 See whether the iPod has enough juice. Is the battery charged up?
Connect the iPod to a power source and see whether it works.
 Reset your iPod if the iPod still doesn’t turn on. See Chapter 27 for
resetting instructions.
If your iPod shuffle doesn’t turn on or respond, recharge its battery by con-
necting it to the USB connection on your computer. If the iPod shuffle status
light blinks orange when you press a button, it means the buttons are dis-
abled. Press and hold the Play/Pause button for at least three seconds or
until the status light blinks green.

How Do I Get My Battery 
to Last Longer?
You can do a lot to keep your battery going longer (much to the envy of your
friends), including the following:
 Press the Play/Pause button to pause (stop) playback. Don’t just turn
off your car or home stereo or take out your headphones — if you don’t
also pause playback, your iPod continues playing until the playlist or
album ends. When playback is paused, the power-save feature turns off
the iPod after two minutes of inactivity.
 Hold down the Play/Pause button to turn off the iPod when not using it.
Rather than wait for two minutes of inactivity for the power-save feature
to turn off the iPod, you can turn it off yourself and save battery time.
 Turn off the backlighting. If you don’t need to use backlighting, turn it
off. It can drain the power.
 Avoid changing tracks by pressing the Previous/Rewind or Next/Fast-
Forward buttons. The iPod uses a memory cache to load and play songs.
If you frequently change tracks by pressing the Previous or Next buttons,
the cache has to turn on the hard drive to load and play the songs, which
drains the battery.
 Use compressed AAC or MP3 files. Playing larger uncompressed AIFF or
WAV files takes more power because the hard drive inside the iPod has
to refresh its memory buffers more frequently to process more informa-
tion as the song plays. Apple Lossless files, though compressed, also
deplete battery power a bit more than AAC or MP3 files.
How Do I Keep My Scroll 
Wheel from Going Crazy?
Second-generation and third-generation iPods use a nonmoving scroll wheel
that works like the trackpad (also sometimes called a touchpad) of a laptop
computer. Although the trackpad-style scroll wheel is far better than the first-
generation moving wheel (which could be hampered by sand or dirt and had
moving parts that could be damaged), it has problems of its own: it goes
crazy sometimes, and it can be very sensitive — not sensitive to criticism,
but to the touch of your finger.
The trackpad-style scroll wheel translates the electrical charge from your
finger into movement on the iPod display. If you use more than one finger or
have another finger nearby, the scroll wheel might detect the signal and skip
370
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

over selections or go backwards while scrolling forwards, and so on. If the
scroll wheel has excessive moisture on it, from humidity or a wet hand, wipe
the wheel with a soft, dry cloth.
Don’t use lotion or moisturizer on your hand right before touching the scroll
wheel. Don’t use pencil erasers, pen caps, or other types of pointers to scroll
the scroll wheel. (They won’t work with trackpad-style scroll wheels and may
damage other types of scroll wheels.) Don’t use your ring finger or the hand
that sports a heavy bracelet or similar jewelry — these can throw off the sen-
sors in the scroll wheel.
How Do I Get My Computer 
to Recognize My iPod?
Follow the first troubleshooting steps outlined in Chapter 27. If iTunes or
MusicMatch Jukebox still does not recognize the iPod, you can use the iPod
Updater to restore the iPod. (If you’re using MusicMatch, a companion Web
site is available at www.dummies.com/go/ipod.)
Also, make sure that your FireWire or USB cable is in good condition. For
iPods that work with either FireWire or USB, try one type of connection or
the other; if one connection type works, but not the other, the problem is
probably not in your iPod. Try connecting your iPod to another computer by
using the same type of connection to see whether the same problem occurs.
(Your computer might be to blame.) If the same type of connection (FireWire
or USB) to the other computer works, the problem is most likely your com-
puter’s connection or software. If it doesn’t work, the problem is most likely
your cable or connection. You can try a new cable to see whether that works.
What Do I Do if a Strange 
Icon Appears on My iPod?
When you turn on your iPod, built-in diagnostic software checks the iPod
hard drive. If the iPod finds a problem when it’s turned on, it automatically
uses internal diagnostics to check for and repair any damage. You might see a
disk scan icon on your iPod screen after turning it on, indicating that a prob-
lem was fixed. If this happens, restore your iPod to its original factory condi-
tion (see Chapter 27), and load it again with music.
If the iPod displays any other strange icon, such as a backwards Apple logo, a
disk icon with a flashing question mark, or the dreaded disk-with-magnifying
371
Chapter 28: Ten iPod Solutions

glass icon, it might need to be repaired. You can arrange for repair by visiting
the Apple support site for the iPod (www.apple.com/support/ipod).
How Do I Restore My iPod to its Original
Condition from the Factory?
Restoring the iPod erases your iPod’s hard drive and returns the device to its
original factory condition. Restore erases all of the data on the hard drive, so
make sure that you back up any important data that you have stored on your
iPod. You can use the iPod Updater utility to restore your iPod, as we describe
in Chapter 27. When finished, add music back to your iPod from the iTunes
library or from your MusicMatch Jukebox library, and then resynchronize
your iPod with calendar and contact information. (If you’re using MusicMatch,
a companion Web site is available at www.dummies.com/go/ipod.)
How Do I Update My iPod to 
Have the Newest Software?
To determine which version of the iPod software is installed on your iPod,
press the Menu button until you see the iPod main menu, and then choose
Settings➪About (in earlier versions, choose Settings➪Info). Look at the version
number that describes the software version installed on your iPod. You can use
the iPod Updater application to update or restore your iPod; see Chapter 27.
How Do I Update My iPod with Music
When My Library Is Larger Than My
iPod’s Capacity?
If you have less space on your iPod than music in your iTunes library, you
can update manually (by album, artist, or songs), update automatically by
selected songs only, or update automatically by playlist.
When you update by playlist automatically, you can create playlists exclu-
sively for your iPod. A smart playlist can be limited to, for example, 18GB (for
a 20GB iPod).
372
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

By combining the features of smart playlists (in Chapter 9) and updating
automatically by playlist (in Chapter 10), you can control the updating
process while also automatically limiting the amount of music you copy to
your iPod.
You can also update automatically and keep your iPod synchronized to a
subset of your library. iTunes creates a new playlist specially designed for
updating your iPod automatically — a smart playlist named “your iPod name
Selection.” iTunes decides which songs and albums to include in this playlist
by using the ratings that you can set for each song in the iTunes song infor-
mation, as we describe in Chapter 10.
How Do I Cross-Fade Music 
Playback with My iPod?
You can fade the ending of one song into the beginning of the next one to
slightly overlap songs, just like a radio DJ, when you use iTunes. The cross-
fade setting is the amount of time between the end of the fade-out from the
first song and the start of the fade-in to the second song.
To cross-fade songs on your iPod, you have to play your iPod songs through
iTunes on your computer. Connect your iPod to your computer and connect
your computer to a stereo or connect speakers (or headphones) to your
computer. Hold down Ô-Option (on a Mac) or Ctrl-Alt (on a PC) as you launch
iTunes and you can then select iPod in the iTunes Source pane.
By default, iTunes is set to have a short cross-fade of one second.
If you’re playing songs on an iPod that’s connected to your computer and
also playing songs from your iTunes library (or even on a second iPod, both
connected to your computer), your songs cross-fade automatically.
You can change this cross-fade setting by choosing iTunes➪Preferences (on a
Mac) or Edit➪Preferences (on a PC), and then clicking the Audio button. You
can then increase or decrease the amount of the cross-fade with the Crossfade
Playback option.
How Do I Get Less Distortion with 
Car and Portable Speakers?
iPod models designed for the Unites States have a powerful 60-milliwatt
amplifier to deliver audio signals through the headphone connection. It has a
373
Chapter 28: Ten iPod Solutions

frequency response of 20 Hz to 20 kHz, which provides distortion-free music
at the lowest or highest pitches, but it might cause distortion at maximum
volume depending on the recorded material.
For optimal sound quality, set the iPod volume at no more than three-
quarters of the maximum volume and adjust your listening volume by using
the volume control or equivalent on your car stereo or portable speaker
system. (If no volume control exists, you have no choice but to control the
volume from the iPod.) By lowering the iPod from maximum volume, you 
prevent over-amplification, which can cause distortion and reduce audio
quality.

Chapter 29
Eleven Tips for the Equalizer
In This Chapter
 Adjusting the equalizer on your home stereo
 Taking advantage of the iPod’s equalizer preset
 Getting rid of unwanted noise
You play your iPod in many environments. The same song that sounds
like music to your ears in your car might sound like screeching hyenas
on a plane. In this chapter, we show you how to fix most sound problems that
occur with iPods. Soon you’ll be cruising to the beat all the time — no matter
where you are.
Setting the Volume to the Right Level
Before using the iPod equalizer (EQ) to refine the sound, make sure the
volume of the iPod is set to about half or three-quarters (not more) so that
you don’t introduce distortion. Then set your speaker system or home stereo
volume before trying to refine the sound with equalizers.
Adjusting Another Equalizer
When you have the iPod connected to another system with an equalizer, try
adjusting that equalizer:
 Home stereo system: Refine the sound with your home stereo’s equal-
izer because it might offer more flexibility and can be set precisely for
the listening environment.
 Car stereos: The same rule applies as your home stereo — adjust the
car stereo’s equalizer as you begin to listen to music on your iPod,
before adjusting the iPod’s equalizer.

Setting Booster Presets
When playing music with your iPod through a home stereo or speakers 
(without a built-in equalizer) in a heavily draped and furnished room, try 
the iPod’s Treble Booster EQ preset or create your own EQ preset (see
Chapter 19) that raises the frequencies above 1 kHz. Boosting these higher
frequencies makes the music sound naturally alive.
Reducing High Frequencies
When using your iPod to play music through a home stereo (without a built-
in equalizer) in a basement with smooth, hard walls and concrete floors, you
might want to use the iPod’s Treble Reducer EQ preset, which reduces the
high frequencies to make the sound less brittle.
Increasing Low Frequencies
If you use high-quality acoustic-suspension compact speakers, you might
need to add a boost to the low frequencies (bass) with the Bass Booster EQ
preset so that you can boogie with the beat a little better. The Small Speakers
EQ preset also boosts the low frequencies and lowers the high frequencies to
give you a fuller sound.
Setting Presets for Trucks and SUVs
We use our iPods in different types of cars — one is a sedan; the other a 
4-wheel drive truck. Trucks need more bass and treble, and the Rock EQ
preset sounds good for most of the music that we listen to. We also recom-
mend the Bass Booster EQ preset when using your iPod in a truck if the Rock
preset doesn’t boost the bass enough. In the sedan, the iPod sounds fine
without any equalizer adjustment.
Setting Presets When You’re 
Eight Miles High
When using your iPod on an airplane where jet noise is a factor, try using the
Bass Booster EQ preset to hear the lower frequencies in your headphones
376
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

and compensate for the deficiencies of headphones in loud environments.
You might want to use the Classical EQ preset, which boosts both the high
and low frequencies for extra treble and bass. Try the Bose QuietComfort 2
Acoustic Noise Canceling headphones (www.bose.com) for plane travel —
they work great!
Reducing Tape Noise and Scratch Sounds
To reduce the hiss of an old tape recording (or the scratchy sound of songs
recorded from an old vinyl record), reduce the highest frequencies with the
Treble Reducer EQ preset.
Reducing Turntable Rumble and Hum
To reduce the low-frequency rumble in songs recorded from a turntable (for
vinyl records) or recorded with a hum pickup, choose the Bass Reducer EQ
preset.
Reducing Off-Frequency Harshness 
and Nasal Vocals
To reduce a particularly nasal vocal sound reminiscent of Donald Duck
(caused by off-frequency recording of the song source, making the song more
harsh-sounding), try the R&B EQ preset, which reduces the midrange fre-
quencies while boosting all the other frequencies.
Cranking Up the Volume to Eleven
If you want that larger-than-life sound, use the Loudness preset, and then 
jack up the Preamp slider to the max, turn up your stereo all the way, and 
put your fingers in your ears to protect them. Then consult the DVD This 
is Spinal Tap or the Spinal Tap fan site at http://spinaltapfan.com/.
