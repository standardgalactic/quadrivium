Introduction
Imagine...
...an ocean—the Internet—so vast and deep the information contained in its
more than 40 million Web sites would fill tens of thousands of libraries. 
Now imagine trying to find something in any of those thousands of libraries.
Enter the word “robotics” at the popular Google.com search engine, and
you’ll get a listing of some one million Web sites and pages. If each “hit” were a
piece of paper, the stack would reach some 30 stories—325 feet—into the air!
Imagine...
...you’re trying to find some specific information about robotics in this stack,
and you’re not sure what to look for.
That’s precisely what faces a growing legion of amateur and educational robot-
ics enthusiasts. The boom in robotics has brought with it a mountain of suppli-
ers and information. Thousands of companies worldwide provide parts, plans,
kits, and other material for building robots; thousands more support the
robotic craft with programming languages, operating systems, and computers.
Imagine...
...the most relevant information contained in one centralized clearinghouse. 
This is what I imagined, and it’s why I compiled the book you now hold in
your hands. The Robot Builder’s Sourcebook is designed to serve as a compendium
for the amateur robotics enthusiast: what it is, where to get it, and how to get
started.
What You’ll Find in this Book
This book goes far beyond any search engine or links page you’ll find on the
Internet. In The Robot Builder’s Sourcebook you will find:
• Over 2,500 robot resources, including mail order suppliers, online retailers, and
informational Web sites. Each listing is placed in a category, such as Actuators -
Motors, and include detailed information about the resource—including (when
available) address and phone number.
• Sources for unusual parts and supplies you might not have known existed. How
about thin luminous “neon rope,” in vibrant colors, to dress up your robot;
or maybe adhesive tape that conducts electricity one way, but not another;
or perhaps a special casting material that softens in a commonly available
solvent, then sets to any shape you can imagine for your robot.
• Dozens of “sidebars” with additional information to help you understand critical
robotics technologies, such as motor types, sensor designs, and choice of
materials.
• Over 200 articles of relevant advice to both beginner and experienced reader, on vari-
ous robot building topics. 
The Robot Builder’s Sourcebook is the Yellow Pages for amateur and educational
robotics. It is designed to be a constant reference for all robotics enthusiasts,
as it contains resources for both common and uncommon parts and supplies.
About the Listings
Not every company or individual having to do with robotics is listed in this
book. That would be counterproductive—it would mean tens of thousands of
listings, and you’d once again drown in a sea of too much information.

introduction
xii
Those that are listed in this book are either primary resources that no robot
maker should do without, or are representative of a large group of similar sell-
ers. They are included to give you an idea of the product offerings. The same
goes for schools with robotics programs, and for people who want to show off
their robot creations; it’s impossible to list them all.
In most cases, resources listed have Web pages, so you can easily find out more
information about them. This is not just a pro-Internet bias, but a reflection of
the realities of commerce.
Who’s Not Listed
All this said, certain companies who conduct business on the Web have been
intentionally left out. For commercial sites (sites that collect your money and
sell you things through the mail), no listing is provided for companies:
• That are only on a free server (such as Yahoo, Geocities, or AOL). There
are rare exceptions to this, when I either know the company well, or they
have been in business for so long the possibility of fraud is virtually non-exis-
tent. In such cases I’ll tell you why they were excepted.
• That fail to provide at least a phone number or a mail address (at the mini-
mum, a post office box).  This is to help protect you against fly-by-
nighters—shady characters who set up quick storefronts, take your money,
then hide in the anonymity of the Internet.
• Whose site is “under construction” with little worthwhile information con-
tained on it.
For all pages, no listing is given if the site:
• Includes content, links, or advertising to “adult” material, or to online casi-
nos and gambling. No, I’m not a prude, but I recognize many amateur
robotics enthusiasts are under 18. They don’t need me pointing them to
porn on the Internet, thank-you-very-much.
• Contains excessive pop-up or pop-under windows. I tolerate one or two pop-
up windows, but a gaggle of them, especially one right after the other, is
total baloney, and they don’t earn the right to be listed here.
• Merely frames other Web sites. No posers and wannabees!
• Is a simple “grab-bag” link lists. Search engines like Google.com do a better job.
• Tries to add itself (or other sites) to your Favorites list.
• Has not been updated within the last 12 months.
• Provides little or nothing of interest to the amateur robot builder. This
applies to some of the very high-end industrial robot manufacturers.
These Aren’t Paid Ads!
No way! The Internet is full of enough ads as it is.
No one paid me, or the publisher (cash, freebies, beer, dancing girls, what-
ever), to be listed in this book. And they especially didn’t pay for the special
“highlights” that focus on specific products or companies. Those companies,
groups, and individuals listed in this book are included because I felt they con-
tributed to the art and science of amateur robots.
Be Included in the Next Edition!
We (the publisher and I) welcome your submissions if your company, school,
or personal Web site is related to amateur (and not industrial)  robotics. If
accepted, your submission will appear in the next edition of Robot Builder’s

introduction xiii
Sourcebook. Send a short e-mail, describing your company, school, or Web site
to:
listings@robotoid.com
If you’re still working on your Web site, please complete it before submitting
your request. Submissions from non-US entities are especially encouraged.
Updates and Changes
People on the Internet move, change addresses, or plain go out of business.
Some of the listings in Robot Builder’s Sourcebook are bound to change over time.
To help reduce the frustration of dead-end links, we regularly survey the com-
panies and Web sites included in this book, and provide updates at the follow-
ing:
http://www.robotoid.com/sourcebook/
Here, you’ll find:
• New additions to the sourcebook.
• News of major changes, like Amazon.com going bankrupt (nah...).
• Searchable database of all the links provided in Robot Builder’s Sourcebook.
The searchable database is useful if you try a Web address printed in the book,
and it’s no longer working. To reduce wear-and-tear on your mouse and key-
board, we use a special coding feature for our searchable database. If you find
a Web address is no longer functional, locate the six-digit ID number included
with its listing. A typical ID number looks like this:
012345
Enter the ID into the Search box, and click the Go button. The latest Web
address we have for that listing is displayed.
Report Changed or Dead Links
Though we make every effort to look for, change, and remove bad links,
some fly under our radar. If you find a link that is no longer working, please
report it using the Changed Links button on the main Robot Builder’s
Sourcebook page.
What You Need to Use The Internet
Many of the resources listed in this book rely on contact via the Internet. In
fact, some sellers, like Amazon, only do business through the Internet. They
discourage the “older fashioned” methods of mail order buying, and may not
even provide a mailing address.
Odds are you already have what you need to make use of the Internet, but to
recap:
• Web browser. Any reasonably recent version of your favorite should be fine.
For some Web pages, you’ll want a browser that can display graphics and
run Java and JavaScript code.
• Shockwave. Some sites use Shockwave, an add-in program that provides ani-
mation and sound effects. Shockwave is a “plug-in” that works with your
Web browser. You can download it at http://www.macromedia.com/.
• E-mail reader. If you use a Web-based e-mail service (like Hotmail or Yahoo),
then your browser is your e-mail reader. Otherwise you will need an e-mail
program, such as Microsoft Outlook Express (comes with all new versions of
Windows). Additionally, there are several free and nearly free e-mail readers
you can try.

Introduction

• Newsgroup reader. A newsgroup reader allows you to read and post Usenet
newsgroup messages. Newsgroup readers comes as part of Windows
(Outlook Express), and are included with many Web browsers, such as
Netscape.

How to Use the Source Listings
Each listing in The Robot Builder’s Sourcebook provides basic contact information.
In most cases, the address and/or phone number is included for sellers of
products and services. Internet-only resources, such as search engines, include
the name of the site, its URL address, and a description.
Here’s a sample listing for a seller of products or services:

1. Name of the resource.
2. Mailing address for the resource.
3. Country the resource is located in.
4. Six digit ID number that can be used at the support site for this book to look
up the latest known URL for the resource. See the Introduction for more
information.
5. Voice phone. Outside North America the country code is included.
6. Fax phone. As with the voice number, the country code is included for list-
ings outside North America.
7. Toll free phone. In almost all cases, these numbers are good only when dial-
ing within the seller’s country. In North America, many toll free numbers
do not function if calling locally, or within the same state.
8. Main e-mail contact.
9. Web site URL address.
10. Description of products or services provided.
Note:
Not all listings include all of the above information. For example, some
companies wish to only publish their toll free phone, and not their local access
phone...sounds crazy, but that’s their approach to doing business.
Many of the listings also include one or more icons to help you identify special
features of the resource. Here’s what the icons mean:

how to use the source listings
xvi
x
Resource provides at least rudimentary product descriptions on their
Web site. Simple listings of product lines or manufacturers do not a Web cata-
log make.
d
Listing is a premium resource, known for competently providing products
to robot builders and other hobbyists.
$
Seller requires a minimum order of more than $20 (for sellers in the
United States only). Note: Some sellers will accept orders of any size, but will
tack on a handling charge if it’s under a certain amount. This is not the same
as a minimum order requirement, where your order is refused if it doesn’t
measure up.

Listing is for a manufacturer or wholesaler who may, or may not, sell
directly to individuals. If the resource does not sell directly, the Web site typi-
cally indicates where and how products can be purchased. In some instances, a
resource will sell directly only if a regional distributor or representative is not
available, so be sure to check with the company for exact policies.
V
Resource sells online, typically through an e-commerce shopping cart,
but may also accept phone, fax, or mail orders from product listings available
on the site.
	
Resource provides useful information only, and no sales.

Resource conducts local business in a bricks-and-mortar retail store.
Some listings are for companies that sell both online and locally.

Acknowledgements
I’m indebted to the countless robot enthusiasts on the comp.robotics.misc
newsgroups, who are always willing to share their ideas, hints, tips, and
sources. You were the inspiration for this book, and I hope it’ll be useful
to you.
Special thanks to Matt Wagner (my agent) at Waterside Productions, and to
Scott Grillo, my publisher at McGraw-Hill. Scott actually pays me to write
about things I love doing—building robots. Could life be any better?
This book wouldn’t have been possible without the hard and compassionate
work of Chuck Wahrhaftig and Judy Allan of TopDesk Publishers’ Group,
tamers of the wild Quark beast. Thanks, guys.
When the call went out for photos, dozens of kind folks responded on short
notice, and I’m grateful for the product photos you’ve provided. A special
kudos to Ed Sparks, for his wonderful CAD drawings. Check out
FirstCadLibrary.com for some first-rate 3D illustrations of motors, gears,
and more.
Finally, a heartfelt thanks to my family—wife Jennifer, daughter Mercedes,
son Max, and grandson Lane—for letting me stay up past my bedtime to 
finish this book.

+ Actuators
Actuators are mechanisms that produce motion from
some energy source, such as electricity or air pressure.
Common actuators are electric motors and air cylin-
ders. Actuation mechanisms are used to control how
that motion is applied. 
The companies in this main section make, distribute, or
sell a very broad line of actuators and mechanisms and
are listed here as generic resources. Additional compa-
nies and resources are listed in the following subcate-
gories:
Actuators-Motion Products: Specializes in
mechanisms (though may also sell motors and
other components)
Actuators-Motors: DC geared and nongeared
motors, servomotors, stepper motors (but not
motors for radio-controlled models)
Actuators-Other: Mechanical actuators (e.g.,
solenoids) that don’t neatly fit elsewhere
Actuators-Pneumatic: Air cylinders, control
values, pumps, and other fittings
Actuators-Shape Memory Alloy: Material
that contracts when heat or electricity is 
applied.

Locomotion Systems
Mobile robots use wheels, tracks, or legs to move around—there are exceptions, of
course: some snake-like robots crawl. We'll just concentrate on the usual designs.
Wheels: The Primary Moto-vator
Wheels are by far the most popular method of providing
robot mobility. Wheels can be just about any size, from an
inch or two in diameter to over 10 or 12 inches. Tabletop
robots have the smallest wheels, less than 2 to 3 inches in
diameter. Wheel size is critical for smaller 'bots because
larger wheels weigh more. Robots can have just about any
number of wheels, although two is the most common. In a
two-wheel robot, the machine is balanced by one or two
casters on either end.
Legs: I'm Walkin' Here, I'm Walkin'!
More and more amateur robots have legs. Legs are often
preferred for robots that must navigate over uneven terrain.
Most amateur robots are designed with six legs, which
affords static balance—the ability of the robot to be bal-
anced at all times because a minimum of three legs (in tri-
pod arrangement) are touching the ground at any one time.
Robots with fewer legs must take more careful steps, or
use dynamic balance (shifting of weight) to keep from falling
over.
Tracks: O' My Tears
Tracks (or treads) are similar to what tanks use. The tracks, one on each side of the
robot, act as giant wheels. The tracks turn, and the robot lurches forward or backward.
Track drive is best for robots used only outdoors and only over soft ground, like dirt.
Wheeled robots are the most
popular.
Despite their looks, six-legged
walking robots are not difficult
to build.

G Actuators-Motion
Products
Motion products are mechanisms and components
designed primarily for use in motion control equipment,
particularly linear motion assemblies (such as ACME
screws, ballscrews, X-Y translation tables, and linear actu-
ators). Motion products may be sold individually, or as a
complete system, including motor, all mechanical parts,
electrical control, and feedback sensors.

Of the companies listed in this section, nearly all are
geared toward industrial motion control applications;
therefore, their prices for parts tend to be high-a typical
18-inch-long ballscrew mechanism might cost in excess
of $300. However, they are good sources for mechanical
information, and many do sell low-cost versions suitable
for amateur robotics. Their wares can often be found
on the surplus market.
Companies involved in so-called motion mechanicals
are usually also manufacturers, distributors, or sellers of
motors and motor control devices.

What's a Leadscrew?
Leadscrew is a generic term for a threaded rod that trans-
lates rotary motion to linear motion. The rod is connected to
the shaft of a motor. Situated along the length of the rod is a
nut, which is connected to some platform, or carriage.
When the rod turns, the nut travels forward or back, which
causes the carriage to likewise move.
There are many types of leadscrews, and some folks
reserve the term for a specific type of rod that has a spe-
cific kind of thread. However, the point remains that the rod has threads machined along
its length, and that it couples with a nut with compatible machining so the threads will
properly engage.
Threaded Rod, Acme Rod, Ballscrew Rod
Rod stock is often used in robotics (and machinery tools
such as CNC) to translate rotational motion from a motor to
linear motion. The motor shaft is attached to the rod; a nut
is threaded onto the rod, and the nut is connected to some
carriage that slides back and forth.
The generic term for these devices is translation table, or
translation stage. When two such translation tables are con-
nected to form a cross or T, then they are called an X-Y
table, because they provide linear movement along both the
X and Y axes.
There are many types of rods: 
• Threaded rod can be found at hardware and home
improvement stores. It's like a long version of a bolt, but
without the bolt head. The rod is threaded down its entire
length. The threads are V shaped, just like a machine bolt.
Threaded rod is inexpensive and is suitable for applica-
tions where accuracy is not critical.
• Acme rod is especially made for building translation tables. The threads are more
squared off, and, of course, a special nut is required to couple with the rod. Acme rod
is an ideal "middle ground" that offers reasonable price with reasonable accuracy.
• A ballscrew rod (or coil rod) is intended to couple with a ballscrew nut. These nuts use
recirculating ball bearings that run in tiny channels. The ball bearings ride against shal-
low, rounded threads in the rod. Ballscrew rods and nuts are the most expensive of
them all, because of the mechanicals that go into the recirculating ball bearings. They
are seldom needed for amateur robotics applications.
Uses for Linear Motion Products in Amateur Robotics
Translation tables and leadscrew mechanisms are the primary domain of manufacturing
and factory automation, where machines do the work of humans—only in less time and
often with greater precision. Their application in amateur robotics is less common, though
no less compelling.
For starters, you can always build a translation table for use with your wood router in
order to build robot parts. Used with a computer, you can cut out and mill parts with
accuracies far exceeding that of a skilled craftsman. You might make a set of legs—all
exactly alike—for your walking robot, for example. The possibilities are endless.
Leadscrews translate rotational
motion to linear motion.

Linear motion is also used
in many forms of robotic
arms and grippers. For
instance, a roving wheeled
robot might be equipped
with a kind of forklift arm in
the front that can grab
objects. With a linear mech-
anism, the forklift raises up
or down to carry objects
around the room.
Finally, certain advanced
legged robots use linear
motion mechanicals to replicate walking gaits. One motor swings the leg back and forth,
and another motor lifts the footpad of the leg. To walk forward, the leg is lifted up and
positioned forward. The leg is lowered, and then moved to the back. The process repeats
itself for each step of each leg.
Build Your Own Linear Translation Table—For 
Under $20
Industrial linear translation tables cost big bucks because
they are engineered to provide high accuracy under fairly
heavy loads. But for many home-shop and amateur robot-
ics applications, supreme accuracy under heavy-duty use is
not critical. This makes it possible to build a workable linear
motion translation table for little spending money. Nearly all
of the materials are available at hardware stores. Here's
how:
Start with a length of 3/8-inch all-threaded rod. The rod is available in 1-, 2-, and 3-foot
lengths. Get the length you need for your application—if you're building a translation table
that requires an 18-inch travel, you'll need a 2-foot length. The threaded rod will act as the
leadscrew.
For the leadscrew nut purchase one 3/8-inch coupler. The coupler looks like a very long
hex nut, and in fact, that's exactly what it is. You will need to glue this nut to the moving
carriage of your translation table. Use a fast-setting epoxy. Don't use superglue or its ilk,
as it won't stand up to the mechanical stress.
You will need at least one guide shaft, and two is preferable. Look for a pair of 1/2- or
3/8-inch-diameter steel cold-rolled shafts at the same place in the hardware store as you
found the all-thread.
The carriage transport can be made out of a block of wood or plastic. Plastic is marginally
better as it doesn't swell with moisture or heat, but a good hardwood such as birch will also
work (don't use oak as it's too heavy, and don't use pine because it absorbs moisture like a
sponge). Drill three holes in a triangular configuration, with the center hole near the top. The
two holes for the shafts should be drilled carefully and should be only slightly larger than the
diameter of the shafts. Drill the larger center hole so that it accommodates the 3/8-inch
coupler. Measure the coupler at its widest point, and select a drill bit accordingly.
The front of the translation table requires careful drilling as well. Drill two holes for the
guide shafts just large enough so that you can firmly seat the shafts into the wood. You
can always apply epoxy if there's some play. You may wish to drill the holes for the car-

What’s a Leadscrew (continued)
riage and the front panel by sandwiching them together, as this will help ensure proper
alignment.
The two holes for the guide shafts in the rear of the translation table should be larger
so the shafts will freely "float" by a few millimeters. This helps prevent the carriage from
binding. Do not glue these shafts into position.
The one item you might not be able to find at the hardware store is a suitable coupler
to connect your motor to the all-thread leadscrew. A clamping-type coupler can be used
to attach shafts of different diameters together. Select a coupler for the diameter of the
all-thread (in this case, 3/8-inch) and the diameter of your motor. Suppose your motor
has a 1/4-inch shaft; you need a 3/8-inch to 1/4-inch reducing coupler. Sources for cou-
plers are found in the Power Transmission section.

Motors for Amateur Robots
Electric motors are used to "actuate" something in your
robot: its wheels, legs, tracks, arms, fingers, sensor turrets,
or weapon systems. There are literally dozens of types of
electric motors (and many more if you count gasoline and
other fueled engines), but for amateur robotics, the choice
comes down to these three:
• In a continuous DC motor, application of power causes
the shaft to rotate continually. The shaft stops only when
the power is removed, or if the motor is stalled because it
can no longer drive the load attached to it. These motors are listed in the section you
are reading now, Actuators-Motors.
• In a stepping motor, applying power causes the shaft to rotate a few degrees, then
stop. Continuous rotation of the shaft requires that the power be pulsed to the motor.
As with continuous DC motors, there are subtypes of stepping motors. Permanent
magnet steppers are the ones you'll likely encounter, and they are also the easiest to
use. Stepper motors are also listed in this section.
• A special subset of continuous motors is the servo motor, which in typical cases com-
bines a continuous DC motor with a "feedback loop" to ensure accurate positioning.
There are many, many types of servo motors; a common form is the kind used in
model and hobby radio-controlled cars and planes. These are called R/C (radio-con-
trolled) servos. R/C servo motors are listed in Radio Control-Servos.
Choosing a Motor Type
With three common motor types for amateur robots to pick from—DC, stepper, and
servo—it can be hard to know which one is best. The answer is not simple, because each
motor type has its own pros and cons.

A variety of different motors
types suitable for small robots.

Actuators-motors

Bear in mind that all motors are available in different sizes. 
• Small motors are engineered for applications where compactness is valued over
torque. While there are small high-torque motors, these tend to be expensive because
they use rare earth magnets, high-efficiency bearings, and other features that add to
their cost.
• Large motors may produce more torque, but also require higher currents. High-current
motors require larger capacity batteries and bigger control circuits that won't overheat
and burn out under the load. Therefore, match the size of the motor with the rest of the
robot. Don't overload a small robot with a large motor when big size isn't important.
• When decided on the size of the motor, compare available torque after any gear reduc-
tion. Gear reduction always increases torque. The increase in torque is proportional to
the amount of gear reduction: If the reduction is 3:1, the torque is increased by about
three times (but not quite, because of frictional losses).
Motor Specifications
Motors are rated by their voltage, current draw, output speed, and torque.
Operating Voltage
Operating voltage specifies the nominal (normal) voltage the manufacturer recommends
for the motor. Most small DC motors are designed for 1.5- to 12-volt operation, with the
majority in the 3- to -6-volt range. Larger DC motors designed for heavy-duty applications
usually require 12 to 24 volts, with some needing upward of 90 volts. Often, but not
always, the higher the voltage, the more powerful the motor (this does not apply to step-
per motors, where very low voltages—on the order of just a few volts—are common for
heavy-duty motors). Most motors can be run at operating voltages higher or lower than
the specified rating. 
• Lower voltages reduce torque and speed.
• Higher voltages increase torque and speed.
(Note: For stepper motors, speed is not greatly altered by changing the voltage.)
Avoid applying excessively high voltages to a motor, or else it could overheat and burn
out. R/C servo motors contain their own electronics which are not designed for use over
about 7.2 volts.
Current Draw
Current draw is the amount of current, specified in milliamps or amps, that the motor
requires to produce a certain amount of torque. Motors consume different amounts of
current depending on how they are operated:
• No-load. A motor that doesn't have anything attached to its shaft isn't doing any work
and is said to be free-running. No-load current tends to be very low.
• Load. As the motor does work, its load and current draw increases. Manufacturers rate
the current draw under load using different standards, making it hard to judge a motor
using this specification alone. 
• Stalled. When the motor shaft stops rotating, it "stalls" and draws as much current as
will flow through the windings. This specification is useful for "worst-case scenario"
engineering planning.

Actuators-motors
21
• Shorted. Maximum current flows into the motor when the coils are shorted out. The
motor will not run, and like any short circuit, if operated in this way for any length of
time, serious damage can result to other systems on the robot.
Torque
Torque is the way the strength of the motor is measured. It
is typically calculated by attaching a lever to the end of the
motor shaft and a weight or gauge on the end of that lever.
The length of the lever usually depends on the unit of meas-
urement given for the weight. Examples:
• Metric measurements use Newton meters (Nm), kilo-
grams-force meters (kgf-m), or sometimes gram-cen-
timeters (gm-cm).
• Standard measurements use ounce-inches (oz-in), or pound-feet (lb-ft), or pound-
inches (lb-in). It's common to reverse the nomenclature and call it foot-pounds and
inch-pounds.
Speed
The speed of the motor indicates how fast its shaft is turning. DC motors without a gear-
box spin at 3,000 to over 12,000 rpm (revolutions per minute). With a gearbox, the speed
can vary from under 1 rpm on up. 
Stepping motors are not rated in rpm, but pulses (or steps) per second. The speed of a
stepper motor is a function of the number of steps required to make one full revolution
times the number of steps applied to the motor each second. Typical values are 200 or
300 pps.
Motor Specs: Comparing Apples to Oranges
Motor torque specifications are not standardized, both in
the way the torque is measured and the way that torque is
specified. This makes it difficult to adequately compare the
torque of motors to determine which one(s) is best suited
for the job.
Why the disparity? Many motors are designed expressly
for a specific application, and the specifications are tailored
to be meaningful for that application. Amateur robot builders
don't typically buy 10,000+ motors at a time, so we have to
buy “off the rack” rather than have something specially
made for us. Naturally, we also have to accept whatever
type and format of specifications that are provided with the motor. Torque may be pro-
vided in ounce-inches for one motor and Newton meters for another. 
Basic Torque Conversion Factors
Fortunately, it's possible to compare these disparate measurement schemes with simple
math. Here are some basic conversion equivalents:
1 pound-foot = 1.35 Newton meter
1 Newton meter = 8.851 pounds-inches
1 pound-foot = 12 pounds-inches
16 ounce-inches = 1 pound-inch
1 Newton = 1 kilogram-meter per second squared

Specifications in Horsepower?
AC-operated motors are often specified in horsepower (hp) rather than torque. While
both horsepower and torque represent the strength of the motor, they are not the same
thing. (Specifically, horsepower calculations also include the amount of work performed
during a period of time, such as one second, while torque does not.) 
Small DC-operated motors for amateur robotics are not rated in horsepower, because
the ratings are less than 1/50 or even 1/100 hp. Manufacturers rely on horsepower ratings
for larger motors; you may see it for big brute motors intended for electric wheelchairs.
For the curious, 1 hp is equal to 550 lb-ft per second, or 76.04 kgf-m per second.

Anatomy of a Permanent Magnet DC Motor
By far, the most common motor used in amateur robotics is the small permanent magnet
(PM) variety. It runs off direct current (DC) and comes in thousands of shapes and sizes.
But despite all the variations of PM motors, they all work about the same.
A Peek Inside
At the center of the motor is the central shaft; wrapped around this shaft is a core of
windings, called the armature. The armature turns within a cavity of the motor that is
made of magnets. Though multiple sets of magnets may be used, the fundamental
design of PM motors uses two field magnets, one with its north pole facing the armature,
and one with its south pole facing the armature. The two magnets are placed on opposite
sides of one another inside the motor.

Actuators-motors
23
Electricity is applied to the windings, and this causes the
motor to turn within the magnetic field. The direction of the
motor is determined by the polarity of the DC voltage
applied to the two terminals of the motor. 
Brushed and Brushless
Permanent magnet motors can be brushed or brushless.
The brushed variety uses small contacts, called brushes,
that make intermittent contact with the windings on the
armature. As the armature spins, the brushes touch an
insulated metal collar (the commutator) that is positioned on the end of the armature. The
commutator is typically split in three electrically insulated sections, which each third going
to windings on the armature. As the motor spins, the electrical field is then alternated
between the windings.
In the least expensive motors, the brush is really just a piece of flexible copper wire, but
on fancier motors, real metal brushes or pieces of carbon are used. These brushes can
be replaced as part of regular motor maintenance. You won't find replaceable brushes on
smaller DC motors, but they are common on larger units, such as wheelchair drives.
Brushes can wear out over time; brushless motors are a variation on the theme where
the alternating field through the coils comes from electronic control, rather than mechani-
cal contact via brushes. Brushless motors are more complicated to drive, but can last
longer and are often more efficient.
Speed Control
The speed of the motor is primarily determined by its input voltage. Put through more
voltage, and the armature spins faster. The actual speed depends on several factors,
however, including the load on the motor. The speed is the fastest when the motor spins
freely (no load). Speed decreases for a given voltage as the load on the motor shaft
increases. 
A simple method of controlling the speed of a motor is to vary its voltage with a rheo-
stat. Turning the dial increases or decreases the voltage reaching the motor, and so the
motor changes speed. This is a rather inefficient, however; most motor speed controllers
use a technique known as pulse width modulation (PWM) where voltage to the motor is
rapidly turned on and off several hundred or even several thousand times per second. 
PWM works by varying the ratio of the "on" time to the "off" time. The longer the off
time, the slower the motor, because the motor will receive less voltage. Likewise, a PWM
period of 100% means the motor is fully on and runs the fastest. A PWM period of 0%
means the motor is off and is stationary.
Selecting the Right Motor Supply Voltage
The design of the average permanent magnet motor does not require exact operating
voltages. A motor "designed" for 12-volt operation will usually work just fine at 8 or 10
volts, or even at 14 to 16 volts. Operating the motor at a voltage higher or lower than its
rating proportionally affects the speed of the motor, its current draw, and its torque.
• With a lower voltage, the motor will run slower, draw less current, and provide less
torque.
• With a higher voltage, the motor will run faster, draw more current, and provide more
torque.

There is some danger in operating a motor at too high a voltage. You'll want to carefully
experiment with the motor to determine if it can withstand a higher voltage. Things to
consider when “overvolting” a motor:
• Because the motor is turning faster, it can develop more internal friction, wearing out
the bearings or bushings sooner than normal.
• With more current flowing through the windings, the motor can get hot. If it gets very
hot, the windings may burn out. 
• Excessive heat may partially demagnetize the magnets in the motor, resulting in dimin-
ished performance.
• With more current flowing to the motor, the control circuit or relay operating the motor
may overheat and cook to extra crispy.
Typical Problems with Permanent Magnet Motors
Permanent magnet motors of all types, styles, designs, makes, and models are prone to
failure, simply because they are fast-moving mechanical devices. Over time, motors can
develop a variety of problems that can cause them to fail. 
For small DC motors (those under about 1.5 inches in diameter and without replaceable
brushes), repair is not practical; replace them with identical or similar units. Larger DC
motors may be repairable, given the proper tools. However, bear in mind that disassem-
bling a PM motor may result in diminished performance. 
• Shorted windings. Applying too much current to the motor can overheat it, and the
windings can short. When this happens the motor ceases to turn. A short can be deter-
mined with a volt-ohm meter. A reading of 0 ohms is a clear indication of a short. If the
reading is nonzero, but low (1-2 ohms), spin the shaft of the motor and watch for a
variation in the resistance. Also check for a short between the terminals and the metal
case of the motor. It should read very high ohms—virtually an open circuit.
• Dirty brushes or commutator. These can be cleaned with alcohol, but if they are worn,
replacement is necessary.
• Dry or worn bearings. The cheapest DC motors don't use internal bearings, but they
may use washers that can crack or disintegrate. Repair or throw away. If the motor
uses bearings, they must be replaced with the exact same kind.
• Gummed lubrication, loss of lubrication. Whether the motor uses brushes, washers, or
nothing at all, the lubricant added at the factory may dry up, thin out over time, or gel
up into a gooey mess. Applying a very small dab of synthetic grease fixes this situation,
but be sure to keep the brushes and commutator clean! The motor will not work if
these are mucked up with grease.
Be a Motor Mouth
Knowing the lingo of motors helps you understand their specifications, which can in turn
help you select the right one for the job. Here's a short recap of the most common terms
you'll encounter in motor specifications.
• Breakdown torque. The maximum torque of the motor that doesn't cause an abrupt
change in either speed or output power.
• Braking. Any means of slowing down the motor. Brakes can be completely electronic,
produced by grounding or shorting out the terminals of the motor. They can also be
mechanical, similar in function to the brakes in a car. Brakes are more common in
larger AC-operated motors.

Actuators-motors
25
• Duty Cycle. The amount of time the motor can be operated between off periods.
Continuous duty cycle motors can be run 24/7; intermittent duty cycle motors are
intended to be operated for periods of a few minutes at a time.
• Full-load Amps or Full-load Current. The amount of current, in amps or milliamps, the
motor draws when it is operating at its rated output torque and voltage.
• Full-load Torque. See Torque Load.
• Mounting. The means by which the motor is mounted. Some motors are intended to be
mounted by the face (the end where the motor shaft is). Machine screws hold it in
place. Other motors are intended to be mounted by the gearbox. Others have no
mounting holes at all and are intended to be clamped into place.
• No-load Speed. The speed of the motor, in revolutions per minute (rpm) when there is
nothing attached to its shaft. The no-load speed is always faster than the load or out-
put speed
• Output Speed. The speed, in revolutions per minute (rpm) of the motor in full-load con-
dition, or free running (not turning any load), and at a given voltage. Output speed is
affected by voltage to the motor and the load on the motor shaft.
• Overhung load. Also called radial force or radial load, the force applied at right angles to
the motor shaft. This force may be the weight of the robot (if the wheels are attached
directly to the motor shaft) or the force caused by a pulley, sprocket, or gear.
Exceeding the overhung load can cause premature death of the motor.
• Reversible. Specifies if the motor can run in either clockwise or counterclockwise direc-
tion. Most DC motors are reversible, but not all.
• RPM. See Output Speed.
• Sleeve bearings. Specifies the type of bearings used for the output shaft of the motor.
Cheap motors have no bearings at all, but instead use fiber, plastic, or metal shims. Well-
made mechanical bearings make the motor quieter and last longer under heavier loads.
• Stall Torque. The amount of torque exhibited at the output of the motor when the shaft
is prevented from moving. This torque is the result of the maximum amount of current
possible flowing through the motor windings. Stall torque is specified without assump-
tions made regarding physical damage that can be caused by operating the motor in
this condition (locking a shaft in a gear motor may actually tear the gearbox apart).
• Torque. The twisting force of the shaft of the motor (or of the output shaft of the gear-
box, if the motor is attached to one). Torque can be specified in a number of different
units, with inch-pounds being the most common in North America.
• Torque Load. The maximum torque produced by the motor without an abrupt change in
speed or output power.
• Voltage. The specified operating voltage of the motor. Most motors can be operated at
higher or lower voltages, though extremes should be avoided.
Of Fish, Weight Scales, and Torque
First a story. Thomas Edison was not only an inventor, he was a businessman. When he
learned he was losing money because his phonograph players were being broken in rail
shipment, he asked his engineers to come up with a stronger box, one that could with-
stand being dropped off a loading dock at a train station. Edison was also quite frugal,
and given the number of phonographs he sold, he didn't want to make the box too
strong, or else he'd spend money unnecessarily.
The engineers set off to work. A week later, Edison returned to find them still grappling
with the problem. They had built a box, but were arguing over their calculations on
whether it had the strength to withstand the drop. Disgusted, Edison put a phonograph

Actuators-motors
26
into the box and shoved it off the loading dock. The box splintered into pieces. The box
wasn't strong enough for the job—back to the drawing board!
The moral: Empirical discovery—testing variables under real-life conditions—is some-
times the fastest and most economical approach to solving a problem. You can use the
same techniques with robots, like when determining the torque needs of the motors.
Rather than complex calculations and math, a perfectly suitable approach is to directly
measure the force needed to pull a stationary robot along the ground.
Measuring Torque with a Fish Scale
Here's how it's done: Attach a 6- to 8-foot length of string
to a hanging spring scale, like the kind used for fishing. A
scale that reads up to a couple pounds is sufficient. Attach
temporary wheels, of the same diameter you plan to use, to
a wooden box. The box should be the approximate weight
and dimensions as your robot. Secure the end of the string
to the tread of the wheel, along the top.
Holding the scale in your hand, and with the string nearly
parallel to the floor, pull the robot until it just starts to move.
Note the reading on the scale. Then, do a simple bit of
math:
Torque = Reading on the scale times the radius of the wheel
The result, torque, is in inch-pounds (or pound-inches, same thing).
Example: If the scale reads 1 pound, and the wheel is 10 inches in diameter (radius is
half the diameter, or 5 inches), then the minimum torque needed to get the robot moving
with one motor is 5 inch-pounds. 
Note: You will need to convert ounces to decimal in order do the calculations. Each
ounce is approximately 0.065 of a pound. So, if the scale reads 1 pound, 7 ounces, multi-
ply 7 by 0.065 (result: 0.45), then add in the number of pounds (1.45). The scale, in deci-
mal pounds, reads 1.45. It does not read 1.7!
Yet another method is to use a torque wrench, a common tool in the automotive
garage. Securely attach the wrench to the hub of the wheel, and turn the wrench until the
wheel begins moving. Don't turn the wrench more than you need to take a quick reading;
you may ruin the wrench otherwise.
Interpreting the Results
Consider that most robots use at least two motors for locomotion, one on each side. For
forward momentum, the motors will share the load; a reading of 5 inch-pounds repre-
sents the total torque to move the robot forward, but two motors need only develop (at
minimum) half that amount.
In reality, however, it is not uncommon to steer a robot with just one motor, and there-
fore, you should rely on the single-motor torque test as the minimum torque needed to
propel the robot. You will also want to take additional readings over various surfaces that
the robot will travel. This includes carpet as well as carpet/tile thresholds (the "bump" that
separates carpet from a tile, wood, or linoleum floor). If the robot is expected to run over
uneven ground, take incline measurements as well. You can set up incline boards using
lumber and stacks of books.
When It's Time for Math
Though empirical testing is a quick and fairly reliable method of determining the torque
requirements for your robot, you may still want to learn how to use the various inertial for-

mulas intended for these calculations. Most any engineering book has them. The work
goes faster if you have a scientific calculator that can perform trig functions. The
Microsoft Windows Calculator, when switched to Scientific mode, is suitable.
Selecting the Right Stepper Motor
There are many types of stepper motors, but the two encountered most often are the
unipolar and bipolar. On the outside, both motors look the same; inside, the motors differ
by their electrical connections and windings. Both unipolar and bipolar motors are like two
motors sandwiched together and have two sets of windings. In a bipolar motor, the wind-
ings attach to the external power supply or driver circuit at their end points only; in a
unipolar motor there is an extra set of taps at the center of the two windings.
Though variations exist, the typical bipolar stepping motor has four leads; unipolar step-
pers have 5, 6, or 8 leads, depending on how the windings are connected internally.
Unipolar and bipolar motors require different actuation techniques. Most self-contained
stepper motor control ICs are designed for unipolar motors, and therefore tend to be less
expensive. Bipolar motors must always be powered in bipolar mode. Unipolar motors can
be powered in unipolar or bipolar mode. When used in bipolar mode, the center taps of
the unipolar motor are left unconnected.
Some additional considerations:
• Bipolar motors provide slightly higher torque, but can't always reach the same top
speeds of unipolar motors.
• Unipolar motors are more common on the surplus and used markets, making them
less expensive.
Motor Sizes
Stepper motors come in lots of sizes, but many are a standardized frame size, with a
standardized mounting plate. The following NEMA (National Electrical Manufacturers
Association) frame sizes are for the height and width of the motor; the length is undeter-
mined and can vary. The following sizes are for the mounting flange, which provides holes
at each corner for attaching the motor. 
Motor Frame Size
Mounting Flange Dimension
Flange Hole Centers
NEMA 17
40mm, 1.57 inches
1.22 inches
NEMA 23
56mm, 2.22 inches
1.856 inches
NEMA 34
3.25 inches
2.739 inches
Bigger NEMA frame sizes exist, of course, but are used infrequently in small mobile
robots.
The length of the motor varies depending on its internal construction. Stepper motors
are often said to be single-, double-, or triple-stacked, which denotes the number of
“submotors” inside. The more stacks, the longer the motor. Additional stacks are used to
increase the torque of the motor.
Single or Double Shaft
It is not uncommon for stepper motors to have a shaft on both ends of its frame. The
shafts are usually the same diameter and length. One shaft is typically used to drive what-
ever load is required by the motor, and the other shaft is used for connection to some

Actuators-motors
28
kind of feedback mechanism, such as a visible indicator or an optical encoder. In the case
of the latter, the optical encoder provides information to a control circuit on the position of
the motor shaft.
Stepper Phasing
A stepper motor requires a sequence of pulses applied to its various windings for proper
rotation. This is called phasing. By their nature, all stepper motors are at least two-phase.
Unipolar motors can be two- or four-phase, and some are six-phase.
Step Angle
Step angle is the amount of rotation of the motor shaft each time the motor is pulsed.
Step angle can vary from as small as 0.9 degrees (1.8 degrees is more common) to 90
degrees. The step angle determines the number of steps per revolution. 
Pulse Rate
Stepper motors have an upper limit to the number of pulses they can accept per second.
Heavy-duty steppers usually have a maximum pulse rate (or step rate) of 200 or 300
steps per second, which equates to 60 to 180 rpm. Some smaller steppers can accept a
thousand or more pulses per second. 
It is important to note that stepper motors can't be motivated to run at their top speeds
immediately from a dead stop. To achieve top speeds, the motor must be gradually
accelerated (also called ramped). 
Running Torque
Steppers motors provide more torque at slow speeds. This is opposite of DC motors,
which develop increased torque the faster they turn. The running torque of a stepper
motor determines the amount of work it can perform. The higher the running torque, the
larger the mass the motor can move. 
Note that stepping motors are also rated by their holding torque, which the amount of
force the motor exerts when its windings are energized, but not pulsed. This imparts a
kind of braking effect where the motor will resist turning when you don't want it to.
Voltage and Current Ratings
Steppers for 5-, 6-, and 12-volt operation are not uncommon. Unlike DC motors, however,
using a higher voltage than specified doesn't result in faster operation, but more running
and holding torque. "Overvolting" stepper motors is a common technique for increasing
its torque. It's not uncommon to apply voltages of 100 to 500% over the rating on the
faceplate of the motor. However, in doing this the motor can get quite hot, and care must
be exercised to prevent overheating and damage.
The current rating of a stepper is expressed in amps or milliamps per energized phase.
The power supply must be able to deliver at least as much current as the specified rating
for the motor. For unipolar motors, two windings are powered at a time, requiring the
supply to deliver at least twice as much current as that specified. If, for example, the cur-
rent per phase is 1 amp, the minimum current requirement is 2 amps.

world. I picked Tamiya’s U.S. distribution office, but
their products are available everywhere. See the com-
pany’s Web site for locations of other distributors and
dealers:
http://www.tamiya.com/ 
Tamiya’s Educational Kits includes these useful proj-

Fine products, indeed, but they can sometimes be hard
to find. Few retail stores, even well-stocked hobby shops,
carry the Educational product line, let alone everything.
Your best bet is online sales such as Towerhobbies.com.

+ Actuators-Pneumatic
Pressure systems perform work from the pressure of gas
(pneumatic) or liquids (hydraulic). For the most part,
hydraulic systems are too large, heavy, and expensive
for use in amateur robotics, and they can be messy if
there is a leak. Pneumatic systems, using compressed
air, are common and affordable. So, we’ll cover just
pneumatic systems.
The resources in this section specialize in pneumatic
systems, including pumps, air reservoirs, air cylinders,
air motors, and pressure-control valves. Not listed here
are pneumatic tools, which are air powered, and
include the components that can be cannibalized for
use in a robot, such as the air motor from a drill or
retrofitting a 12-volt solenoid to operate the trigger
valve from an old ratchet wrench.

Pressure Actuation Systems
Motors are amazingly powerful for their size. Imagine:
Something the size of a walnut can propel a 1-pound robot
across the room. But if that seems incredible to you, con-
sider the amount of work that a pressure actuation system
can produce. Pressure is provided in the form of air or other
gas, or some kind of liquid. Air-pressure systems are called
pneumatic; liquid-pressure systems are called hydraulic.
Both are more bulky than motor actuators, but they can
also provide a lot more power.
You've seen hydraulic power at work if you've ever watched a bulldozer go about mov-
ing dirt from pile to pile. And, while you drive, you use it every day when you press down
on the brake pedal. Similarly, pneumatic power uses air pressure to move linkages.
Pneumatic systems are cleaner than hydraulic systems, but all things considered, aren't
as powerful.
Hydraulic and pneumatic systems are pressurized using a pump. The pump is driven by
an electric motor, so in a way, robots that use hydraulics or pneumatics are fundamentally
electrical. The exception to this is using a pressurized tank, like a SCUBA tank, to provide
air pressure in a pneumatic robot system. Eventually, the tank becomes depleted and
must either be recharged, using some pump on the robot, or removed and filled back up,
using a compressor.
Hydraulic and pneumatic systems are rather difficult to effectively implement, but they
provide an extra measure of power over DC and AC motors. With a few hundred dollars
in surplus pneumatic cylinders, hoses, fittings, solenoid valves, and a pressure supply
(battery-powered pump, air tank, regulator), you could conceivably build a hobby robot
that picks up chairs, bicycles, even people.
If you wish to experiment with pressure systems, I recommend first starting with pneu-
matics. The components are cheaper, and leaking air requires no cleanup, whereas leak-
ing hydraulic fluid (the same basic stuff as power steering fluid) is very messy.
Pneumatic cylinders use air to
provide powerful linear motion.

+ Actuators-Shape Memory
Alloys
A shape memory alloy (SMA) is a metal material that
undergoes molecular change when heated. Most SMAs
are manufactured so that they contract mainly in one
direction when heated. The material is electrically con-
ductive, so passing a current through it causes it to heat
up. The most common application for SMAs in robotics
is as “artificial muscles.” The SMA wire acts as a kind of
small solenoid when electricity is applied.
SMA material is sold by a variety of companies world-
wide. This section lists both the manufacturers of shape
memory alloys, as well as mail-order retailers who will
sell to consumers. Most retailers sell sample packs so
you can experiment with SMA. The material is available
in bulk, if you happen to need a lot of it.

Building Robots with Shape Memory Alloy
As early as 1938, scientists observed that certain metal
alloys, once bent into odd shapes, returned to the original
form when heated. This property was considered little more
than a laboratory curiosity because the metal alloys were
weak, difficult and expensive to manufacture, and broke
apart after just a couple heating/cooling cycles. 
Research into metals with memory took off in 1961, when
William Beuhler and his team of researchers at the U.S.
Naval Ordnance Laboratory developed a titanium-nickel
alloy that repeatedly displayed the memory effect. Beuhler
and his cohorts developed the first commercially viable
shape memory alloy, or SMA. They called the stuff Nitinol, a
fancy-sounding name derived from Nickel Titanium Naval Ordnance Laboratory. 
Since its introduction, Nitinol has been used in a number of commercial products—but
not many. For example, several Nitinol engines have been developed that operate with
only hot and cold water. In operation, the metal contracts when exposed to hot water,
and relaxes when exposed to cold water. Combined with various assemblies of springs
and cams, the contraction and relaxation (similar to a human muscle) causes the engine
to move. 
In 1985, a Japanese company, Toki Corp., unveiled a new type of shape memory alloy
specially designed to be activated by electrical current. Toki's unique SMA material, trade
named BioMetal, offers all of the versatility of the original Nitinol, with the added benefit of
near-instant electrical actuation. BioMetal and materials like it—Muscle Wire from Mondo-
Tronics or Flexinol from Dynalloy—has many uses in robotics, including as novel locomo-
tive actuation. From here on out we'll refer to this family of materials generically as shape
memory alloy, or simply SMA.
At its most basic level, SMA is a strand of nickel titanium alloy wire. Though the material
may be very thin (a typical thickness is 0.15mm—slightly wider than a strand of human
hair), it is exceptionally strong. In fact, the tensile strength of SMA rivals that of stainless
steel: The breaking point of the slender wire is a whopping six pounds. Even under this
much weight, SMA stretches little. In addition to its strength, SMA also shares the corro-
sion-resistance of stainless steel. 
Shape memory alloys need little support paraphernalia. Besides the wire itself, you
need some type of terminating system, a bias force, and an actuating circuit. Companies
that sell SMA materials provide these components, or information on them.
Not all sources of shape memory alloy sell to individuals or in small quantities. The pre-
mier resellers of SMA to the public are:

Bar Coding
Bar codes are used to uniquely identify objects and are
so commonplace in our society that we take them for
granted. For robotics, bar codes can be used as a way to
program them, as well as for navigation and object
detection.
A typical bar code system includes a reader (usually a
hand-held wand, but also a hand-held reader that uses a
CCD or laser element), and a bar code interface to
translate the black-and-white hashes into usable data.
Specialty printers are available for preparing bar codes,
though they are not strictly needed for most robotics
applications. Bar code printing software allows you to
print bar codes on standard laser or ink-jet printers.
Most manufacturers of bar code equipment listed in
this section will not sell directly to the general public;
however, they provide useful technical details not only
about their products, but also about the science of bar
coding. There are numerous online retailers specializ-
ing in bar code hardware and software; the ones listed
in this section are representative of the hundreds that
are out there.

Practical Robotics Applications for Bar Coding
Bar codes are used to identify packages in shipment, mail in the post office, food at the
grocery store, even the book you're reading now. The same technology behind bar cod-
ing for product identification can be used by robots. The components needed for bar
coding include a printed bar code (which you can make with any printer), a reader or
wand, and a code translator.
There are many types of bar codes, based on different coding sequences. A common
bar code is Code 39 (also known as Code 3-of-9), which can encode both text and num-
bers. Most commercial bar code printing and scanning hardware/software can work with
Code 39.
For a robotic application, you can interface a bar code wand to the computer or micro-
controller of a robot. Scan the code, and the information is fed into the robot. Here are
some ideas for using bar codes with robotics:
• Prepare coded programming strips, such as “wander” or “seek can of soda.” The robot
reads the code and is programmed for action.
• Place bar codes along the wall baseboard, for a wall-following robot. Attach a bar code
wand (or better yet a CCD scanner) to the robot so the wand faces the baseboard and
sees the codes. The bar codes can be used to identify where in the room the robot is.
A similar technique can be used for a maze-solving robot.
• A similar technique can be used in a line-following robot, only in addition to a line, the
robot reads bar code information as it travels. It could use this information for additional
navigation instruction.
• Given a wide-field bar code scanner (the kind used in warehouses), your robot can see
bar codes from several feet away. Such a robot could identify not only where in the
room it is, but in which room.
Bar coding is now a mainstream product, with numerous online and local retailers sell-
ing all the components you need to get started. And don't forget surplus, as new bar-
coding technologies come out all the time and companies exchange old equipment for
new.
Bar Code Translation Hardware
The latest bar code wands and CCD scanners incorporate software to read and interpret
common bar codes. These connect to a PC via the keyboard connector or through a USB
or serial port. The products are ideal if your robot is based on a PC-compatible computer.
Zebra Technologies, at http://www.zebra.com/, is a premier manufacturer of all-in-one
bar code wands and CCD scanners.
Other wands are simply optical readers and must be used with an interface. The inter-
face connects to the wand and outputs a signal (usually via RS-232) for reading by a
computer. Older model interfaces tended to be quite bulky, so if your robot is small, the
interface will dwarf the rest of the machine.
Plain optical reader wands (no interface electronics) can be used with a bar code
translation chip. One such product, available in single or multiple quantities is:
BarcodeChip.com
http://www.barcodechip.com/
The bar code chip provides data via a simple serial connection and can be readily inter-
faced to microcontrollers.

Using a Brother P-Touch PT-2300 to Print
Bar Codes
I admit I'm a label freak. I use labels to identify every drawer
and bin in my robotics lab. That way, I don't have to guess
what's in each one. In the old days, the labels were made
by the Dymo Labeler, a mechanical device that embossed
text on plastic strips. I still use my old Dymo occasionally,
but these days, most of my labels are created on a Brother
P-Touch electronic labeling system. This self-contained
machine uses special label cartridges and sports a miniature
typewriter keyboard for entering the text.
There are numerous P-Touch labelers, and they vary mostly in the width of the labels
they can print, the size of the type, and number of lines that can be printed. Obviously,
wider labels can print more lines.
The P-Touch PT-2300 prints in eight type sizes, in four fonts, with up to six lines of text,
and takes different size tapes (maximum 1-inch wide). But the feature I like the most is
that it connects to a computer via a standard USB cable; you have to supply the cable,
but it's available anywhere. With included software, you can print using any available sys-
tem font, as well as bar codes.
Several bar code formats are available, including Code 39, a good generic format that
most every bar code wand or reader will recognize. The PT-2300 is one of several higher-
end labelers from Brother than will print bar codes.
One use of the bar-coding print feature: create small strips of instructions to give the
robot. This is similar to the popular Rumble Robots, which are "programmed" using cards
with bar codes printed on them. You can make your own bar code cards for your robot,
with each card a separate behavior. For instance, one card might tell the robot to shy
away from light; another might tell it to go toward the light. 
Bear in mind that the bar codes themselves do not include the programming code to
instruct the robot. The core code is contained in the robot, and the bar code is used to
activate a desired state.

Zebra manufactures bar code readers (wands, CCD and
laser scanners), RFID readers and tags, and bar code
label printers. Products are available through distribu-
tors and retailers.
One interesting Zebra technology is the printing of
radio frequency ID tags as peel-off labels. An integrated
circuit is embedded in the label, which facilitates the
RF identification. Such "smart labels," as Zebra calls
them, do not need to be in the line of sight of the
reader (RFID will work behind obstructions and often
at a greater distance than standard optical bar coding).
Versions of the labels also contain a digital memory that
can be programmed and reprogrammed many times. 
The Web site contains several technical white papers on
bar coding and RFID technologies.

l Batteries and Power
Mobile robots require a self-contained power source,
and most robots use a battery or battery pack for this
purpose. As common as batteries are, alkaline batteries
available at the local supermarket are not ideal for use
in robotics; your robot will drain its batteries in short
order, and you'll have to replace them frequently-a
costly proposition. 
For this reason, the ideal robot power source is the
rechargeable battery. Two rechargeable battery tech-
nologies stand out as being easy to get and relatively
inexpensive. The older nickel-cadmium (ni-cad) batter-
ies, as well as the newer nickel metal hydride (NiMH)
batteries, are available at hobby stores, home improve-
ment outlets, even some discount stores like Target or
Wal-Mart.
Unusual power sources, such as experimental fuel cells,
are also included in this section, as well as battery hold-
ers and battery chargers.

Chemical Makeup of Batteries
While there are hundreds of battery compositions, only a small handful of them are regu-
larly used in amateur robots.
• Carbon-zinc batteries are also known as garden-variety "flashlight" cells, because
that's the best application for them—operating a flashlight. They're a simple battery
with relatively low current capacities. While they can be "rejuvenated" to bring back
some power, they are not rechargeable, and they end up being expensive for any high-
current application (like running a robot).
• Alkaline batteries offer several times the current capacity of carbon-zinc and are the
most popular non-rechargeable battery used today. They cost several times more than
carbon-zinc. Robotics applications tend to discharge even alkaline batteries rather
quickly, so a bot that gets played with a lot will run through it's fair share of cells. Good
performance, but at a price.
• Rechargeable alkaline batteries are the mass-merchandizing answer to the high cost of
regular alkaline batteries used in high-demand applications—robotics is certainly one
such application, though battery makers had things like portable CD players in mind
when they designed rechargeable alkalines. These cells require a recharger designed
for them and can be recharged dozens or hundreds of times before discarding. All
things considered, rechargeable alkalines are probably the best choice as direct
replacements for regular alkaline cells. More about why this is a factor in the article
titled "Mixing and Matching Battery Voltage."
• Nickel-cadmium (or ni-cad) rechargeable batteries are an old technology and unfortu-
nately, one that has caused considerable poisoning of the environment—cadmium is
extremely toxic. So, battery makers have been weaning consumers off ni-cads, favor-
ing instead the battery formulation that follows. While you can still get ni-cads, there's
little reason to, so we'll ignore them as a choice.
• Nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) rechargeable batteries not only offer better performance
than ni-cads, they don't make fish, animals, and people (as) sick when they are dis-
carded in landfills. They are the premier choice in rechargeable batteries today, but
they're not cheap. Like rechargeable alkalines, they require a recharger made for them.
(Many of the latest rechargers will work with rechargeable alkalines, ni-cads, and
NiMH; just don't use a ni-cad recharger with NiMH.)
• Lithium-ion (Li-ion) cells are frequently used in the rechargeable battery packs for lap-
top computers and high-end camcorders. They are the Mercedes-Benz of batteries,
and are surprisingly lightweight for the current output they provide. However, Li-Ion
cells require specialized rechargers and are frightfully expensive. 
• Lithium (without the -ion) batteries are also available. These are non-rechargeable and
are used for long-life applications, such as for smoke detectors. They are also used as
memory backups and are commonly available in 3-, 6-, and 9-volt cells.
• Sealed lead-acid (SLA) batteries are similar in makeup to the battery in your car, except
that the electrolyte is in gel form, rather than a sloshy liquid. SLAs are "sealed" to pre-
vent most leaks, but in reality, the battery contains pores to allow oxygen into the cells.
SLA batteries, which are rechargeable using simple circuits, are the ideal choice for
very high current demands, such as battle bots or very large robots.
• Polymer batteries are among the latest in rechargeable technology. They are used for
medium- to high-current electronics applications like cellular phones. These batteries
use lithium as a component, but they are not quite the same as the lithium and Li-ion
cells mentioned earlier. Polymer batteries can be manufactured with thicknesses as
small as 1mm wafers.

*Nominal volts per cell for typical batteries of that group. Higher voltages can be obtained by combining cells.
**Many non-rechargeable batteries can be "revitalized" by zapping them with volts for a few hours. However, such batteries are not fully recharged with
this method and are re-discharged very quickly.
Battery Voltage and Current
The two most critical aspects of batteries are their voltage and their current. The impor-
tance of voltage is obvious: The battery must deliver enough electrical juice to operate
whatever circuit it's connected to. A 12-volt system is best powered by a 12-volt battery.
Lower voltages won't adequately power the circuit, and higher voltages may require volt-
age reduction or regulation, either of which entails some loss of efficiency.
If voltage is akin to the amount of water going through a pipe, then current is the pres-
sure of that water. The higher the pressure, the more forceful the water is when it comes
out. Similarly, current in a battery determines the ability of the circuit it's connected with to
do heavy work. Higher currents can light bigger lamps or move bigger motors.
Because batteries cannot hold an infinite amount of energy, the current capacity of a
battery is often referred to as an energy store and is referred to simply as C, for capacity.
Battery current is rated in amp-hours, or roughly the amount of amperage (a measure
of current) that can be delivered by the battery in a one-hour period. In actuality, the
amp-hour rating is an idealized specification: It's really determined by discharging the bat-
tery over a 5- to 20-hour period. Few batteries can actually deliver their rated amp-hour
currents throughout that stated hour.
Smaller batteries are not capable of producing high currents, and their specifications
are listed in milliamp-hours. There are 1,000 milliamps in an amp. Therefore, a battery that
delivers half an amp is listed with a capacity of 500 milliamp-hours (abbreviated mAh).

Common Battery Sizes
If you've ever changed the batteries in an electronic device,
you already know there are different sizes available. There's
no point in telling you batteries are available in N, AAA, AA,
C, D, and 9-volt ("transistor") size.
But with the notion of different sizes fresh in our minds, its
worth noting that the size of the battery directly affects its
capacity. For comparison purposes, following is the typical
capacity ratings for rechargeable ni-cad or NiMH batteries:

*Typically used in specialty battery packs, and not available in traditional consumer packaging. They are available from battery specialty retailers as replace-
ment cells, however.
Mixing and Matching Battery Voltage
Elsewhere we've noted that not all battery cells provide the same voltage. Alkaline cells
provide 1.5 volts nominal (which means normal or average) per cell. Ni-cads and NiMH
batteries provide 1.2 volts. Most cells are used in battery packs, where they are con-
nected in series. This acts to add the volts from each cell to provide a higher voltage of
the whole pack. Therefore, four 1.5-volt batteries will yield 6 volts; but four 1.2-volt batter-
ies will yield only 4.8 volts.
Because of this variance in cell voltage, it is not always possible to simply substitute
one battery type for another in a battery pack. Circuits designed to work with a 6-volt
pack may not function, or may function erratically, if used with a 4.8-volt pack. If you've
been using your robot with alkalines, it may not work if you substitute lower voltage NiMH
batteries.
When it doubt, check the manufacturer's datasheet (if one is available) or test the
device with the lower voltage pack. Be sure to verify operation throughout the whole dis-
charge period of the batteries. The robot may work fine when the batteries are fresh; but 
Some common battery sizes.

57
the voltage at the terminal of the battery is reduced as it is discharged. This means your
robot could stop working after a short period of time, before the batteries are fully dis-
charged.
The Right Voltages for Your Robot
Standards are a wonderful thing. You can buy a TV at your local electronics boutique and
know that it'll work when you plug it into the socket at home. Don't count on electronics
for robots to be as accommodating. There is no standard for operating electronic equip-
ment: Some require 5 volts, others need 3.3 volts, and yet still others need 12, 15, 24, or
48 volts, and everything in-between.
Providing the proper voltages to the various subsystems in your robot requires careful
planning. Obviously, the easiest way to manage the power requirements of your robot is
to chose components that operate at a single voltage—say, 5 volts. That's not always
possible, especially for a mechanical device like a robot, which uses a wide variety of
systems.
There are three basic approaches to powering the various components in your robot.
Each one is discussed below.
Single Battery; Multiple Voltages
Most of the electrical equipment in your home or office is operated from a single power
supply (such as wall current). Each piece of equipment, in turn, uses this voltage as is (as
in the case of an electrically powered fan), or it converts the incoming current via a trans-
former or other device to the voltage required. This is the natural approach because each
piece of equipment is a stand-alone unit and doesn't depend on any other to operate.
This same approach can be used in your robot. A single battery—delivering, say, 12
volts—powers different subsystems. A voltage regulator or DC-DC converter is used to
provide each subsystem with the precise voltage it requires.
While this approach sounds good in theory, in practice it can be expensive and/or diffi-
cult to implement properly. 
• Linear voltage regulators, the most common variety, are cheap but relatively inefficient.
In effect, they "step down" voltage from one level to another; the difference in voltage
is dissipated as heat. The heat can be dealt with; the real problem is the unnecessary
drain on the battery. It's better to conserve battery power for productive tasks, like run-
ning the robot's motors.
• Switching voltage regulators are more efficient—some offer efficiencies of up to 80%—
but they are more expensive to implement, and many require additional components
and design consideration. Like linear voltage regulators, switching regulators "step
down" one voltage to provide another.
• DC-DC converters are self-contained voltage changers. They are the most expensive
of the lot, but they require no additional components. DC-DC converters can step down
or step up voltages and can provide negative voltages. The disadvantage of many DC-
DC converters (besides cost) is that they require high input voltages in order to supply
adequate current at the output. For instance, the input voltage may be on the order of
24 to 48 volts, in order to provide reasonable current at 5 or 12 volts.
Multiple Batteries; Multiple Voltages
A potential alternative to voltage regulation or conversion is to add separate battery
packs to your robot. One battery pack may power the main electronics of the robot;
another may power the motors. This often works out well because the electronics proba-

batteries and power
58
bly need regulation, and the motors do not. The pack for the electronics can be 6 or 7.2
volts (regulated to 5 volts), and the pack for the motors can deliver 12 volts.
The trick to making this work is to tie all the ground (negative terminal) wires of the bat-
tery packs together. Each subsystem receives the proper voltage from its battery pack,
but the shared grounds ensure that the various parts of your robot work together.
The exception to tied grounds is if you use optoisolators. A typical application of
optoisolators in robotics is to control the drive motors. The electronics and the motors are
on completely separate circuits, and their grounds are not tied. Rather than connect wires
directly from the electronics to the motor control circuitry, the electronics instead power
optoisolators, which contain a light emitting diode (LED) and a phototransistor. The link
between electronics and motor control is therefore made of light, not wire.
Single Battery; Single Voltage
Depending on the subsystems of your robot, you may be able to use a single battery and
single voltage for everything. Example: If your electronics do not contain any 5-volt TTL
parts, you might be able to run all circuitry at 12 volts, along with the motors of your robot.
Since applying excessive voltage to electronics can damage them, always check the
specifications first.
The disadvantage of using a single battery for both electronics and motor is that DC
motors—especially large ones—produce a lot of electrical noise that can disrupt the oper-
ation of microcontrollers and computers. If you plan on operating your robot from a sin-
gle, nonregulated battery pack, be sure to add noise suppression to the motors. One
effective noise suppression technique is to solder 0.1-uF nonpolarized disc capacitors
across the terminals of the motor and/or from each terminal to the ground case of the
motor.
Using Ready-made Rechargeable Battery
Packs
Many of today's consumer products use rechargeable bat-
teries. It's a fair bet that the majority of these use specially
made battery packs, rather than individual cells.
Manufacturers must often specify so-called sub sizes for
the cells in the pack because of size issues. It's hard to get
a couple of AAs, or even AAAs, in the handset of a cordless
phone, for instance.
Replacement battery packs are available for most popular
brands and makes of cordless phones, cell phones, per-
sonal CD players, and other consumer electronics products.
While these replacement packs carry a premium price, there are some advantages:
• Most packs are smaller than ones you can make yourself and are handy if space is a
problem.
• Purchasing the replacement pack for a discarded device allows you to hack the
recharger electronics from it. This saves you the cost and trouble of buying or building
a recharger.
• If the battery pack of a discarded product is still good, you can recharge and use it and
save yourself the cost of buying new batteries.

A unique source for service manuals of old but not for-

The company also buys and sells old vintage radios, TVs,
tube hi-fi sets, test equipment, hard-to-find tubes and
high-voltage capacitors. Manuals are available as copies,
and, depending on availability, some are sold as originals.
What do service manuals for old stuff have to do with
robots? First and foremost, yesterday’s electronic com-
ponents often contain useful mechanical and electrical
parts, such as gears, pulleys, and motors. The service
manuals help identify odd-ball parts you may find and
can assist you in adapting them to your robot. This is
especially true of motors in VCRs. One brand of VCR
will use the same parts for several years, so one manual
covers a lot of VCR models. 
Second, it’s fun. Maybe you could build a robot from a
vintage Philco radio.

SAMS is perhaps best known for their Photofact service
guides. In the days before they plastered “no user service-
able parts inside” over every consumer electronics device,
people actually fixed things when they broke. SAMS was
there with a Photofact, which included full schematics,
troubleshooting, and alignment information.
SAMS still sells Photofacts for many current and older
model products, including TVs, printers, and VCRs, the
latter of which is useful for robot builders because
video recorders are a gold mine of parts. You can use
the information in the Photofact as a way to hack parts
for your robot. Because most parts are reused for many
models of VCRs, a small handful of Photofacts will serve
you for a number of VCRs you may find on the garage
sale and thrift store circuit.

online, see:

Further Reading
Nothing beats books. They're relatively cheap, and the better ones pack more informa-
tion than you'll find on a galaxy of Web pages. For the robot-minded, here are some
books you'll want to consider adding to your reading list. These are available for pur-
chase, new or used, but don't forget the local library. If a book you want isn't carried by
your library, ask the librarian if it is available from another branch. Or, ask that the book be
considered for purchase.
I don't list every single robotics book, just the ones I think are most relevant to amateur
robotics. Same goes for electronics and engineering texts.
Online or Local
Only the more general-interest robotics books are carried in stock by local bookstores.
You'll need to special order the books on higher-level robotics or else find them online.

mend this book for any well-stocked robotics library. This does not mean the other books
are not recommended, useful, or good. But I realize not everyone has the cash to pur-
chase, or the time to read, every single book on robotics. I've limited myself to voting for
just two “recommended” books in each category (exception: children's nonfiction robot-
ics books, of which there are really no exceptional ones). If nothing else, consider these
books as starting points for building your own robotics reading list.

An excellent but irregularly published magazine on amateur robotics. Subscription is for

Robot Fiction
Many robot builders are also interested in fictional tales about robots. As judging fiction is
far more subjective than nonfiction, and because some of the best works of robot fiction
are old and/or out of print, I won't presume to list specific books here for adult fiction.
Instead, I'll just summarize some of the more relevant works and authors.
• Isaac Asimov. The stories in I, Robot ushered in a new era of robotics storytelling.
Asimov's famous "Three Laws of Robotics" were first introduced in these stories (the
book is a compilation of shorts published in magazines such as Astounding). The bulk
of robot fiction before this time painted robots as evil, a manifestation of the out-of-
control mechanized world people were living in during the first half of the twentieth cen-
tury. Asimov wrote extensively about robots; see The Rest of the Robots, The
Bicentennial Man, The Robots of Dawn, The Complete Robot, and many others.
• Brian Aldiss. One of my personal favorites, Aldiss forces a darker look at robotics and
our relationship with them. A seminal work is But Who Can Replace a Man, a collection
of shorts published in 1958.
• Philip K. Dick. Where Asimov was optimistic about robotics, Philip K. Dick was pes-
simistic (he arguably might have more realistic, as well). The movie Bladerunner was
inspired by a Philip K. Dick story, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, a tale about
"replicants"—engineered biological creatures who look just like humans, but aren't
allowed rights. While replicants aren't robots per se, the story deals with many of the
same ethical questions being raised today about sentient machines: Do they have the
same rights as humans, even though they aren't "real"? Dick also wrote about robots
in Second Variety, Imposter, Martian Time Slip, Autofac, and several other novels and
short stories.
• Jack Williamson. In a career than spanned many years, Williamson wrote two of the
most influential fictional works on robots: The Humanoids (1949) and With Folded
Hands (1947). Both were about a benign race of androids that take over the work, and
spirit, of their human subjects.
• Stanislaw Lem. Lem's 1974 collection of robot short stories, The Cyberiad: Fables for
the Cybernetic Age, is part fiction, part satire. Nothing is sacred, not even Asimov's
Three Laws of Robotics.
• Clifford D. Simak. Of particular interest, look for City (1952), where the Earth is inhabited
by old robotic cats, dogs, and other machines, and Time and Again (1951), an allegori-
cal tale of robot slaves seeking to free themselves.
• Ron Goulart. Robots that don't work right. Goulart's books on faltering contraptions are
hilarious, but I also understand they are an acquired taste. Try one out to see if you like
it.
• Ray Bradbury. One of the best-known science fiction authors of all time, Bradbury has
written a number of short stories and novels about robots, often taking a look at their
dark side. A number of thought-provoking robot stories can be found in I Sing the Body
Electric! (1969); more can be found in The Illustrated Man and Long After Midnight story
collections.
• David Gerrold. A gifted novelist and television writer (he penned the Trouble with
Tribbles episode for the original Star Trek TV series), David's work has spanned a wide
gamut of topics. His novel When Harlie Was One (also noted with variations, such as
When H.A.R.L.I.E. Was One) is about a self-learning machine, growing and maturing

with age just as humans do. A unique aspect of this book is that like computer soft-
ware, it's gone through several releases since its original 1972 version.
These books are suitable for younger readers interested in robots and their interaction
with humans. Many were written decades ago, so they have no sex, graphic violence, or
drug themes. The local library is the best source for these.
• Robots of Saturn, by Joseph Greene. This young adult novel (now out of print) was
published in 1962 and is remarkable in that it involves telerobotic machines that mind-
meld with humans. An unusual premise over 40 years ago, the idea is just now becom-
ing practical. 
• The Runaway Robot, by Paul W. Fairman (writing as Lester Del Ray). Published in 1965,
this book concerns a family robot that runs away from its young master while on the
Mars colony. Also out of print.
• Ricky Ricotta's Mighty Robot vs. the Mecha-Monkeys from Mars is part of the popular
Ricky Ricotta Giant Robot series for first readers. These books are in print and available
in bookstores and in libraries.

Communications
The following sections list resources involved with com-
pact wireless communications using either infrared or
radio frequency (RF) signals. The communications
products selected for these sections are adaptable to
robotics, are relatively low powered, and can be oper-
ated at 5 volts.
Infrared communications links are used primarily for
hand-held remote controls. RF links have a greater dis-
tance and (depending on the power output of the
transmitter) can be operated around corners or
through walls. Note that some of the RF transmitters
listed in the section Communications-RF may require
special licensing, depending on local laws.

Help—My Remote Control Won’t Work!
A number of robot toys and kits come with an infrared hand-held remote control, the
same kind of thing you use to channel surf on your TV. Their operation is simple: Press a
button and infrared light flashes from an emitter on the front. A sensor on the robot
receives the flashes, decodes them, and responds to the command you have given.
Alas, for something so simple, remote controls don't always work as expected. And it's
not always because the batteries are dead—though that's a leading cause. So, if the
remote control for your robot has stopped functioning, review these points to get it back
on track.
• Dead or corroded batteries. This has to be mentioned, simply because it's so obvious.
Open the battery compartment and look for corroded battery contacts. If a battery has
leaked, clean the battery contacts with a pencil eraser or battery contact cleaner. Wash
your hands thoroughly to remove residue battery electrolyte. Replace with known, fresh
batteries.
• Batteries inserted incorrectly. Be sure the batteries are not reversed when you insert
them in the remote. Otherwise the remote will not work, or it will work erratically.
• Bent battery contacts. Replacing batteries all the time in the remote can bend the bat-
tery contacts inside. Be sure they make a good physical connection to the terminals on
the battery.
• Dirty or gummed up contacts. Spilling a drink into the remote control is a sure-fire way
of ruining it. Water and diet sodas will usually dry, and the remote will come back to life.
Sugared sodas, coffee, and milk will leave a residue, requiring the remote be disassem-
bled and cleaned or thrown away.
• Obstruction or dirty LED.* Same for the infrared receiver. Look for tape, a broken piece
of plastic, dirt, or crud covering the LED on the remote control. Do the same for the
infrared receiving module on the robot.
• Bad infrared LED. This is less common, but it can happen if the remote is used a lot.
You can try replacing the LED. Most any high-intensity LED will work, but be sure to
observe correct polarity.
• Bad IR sensor. This can happen too, though it is unlikely. The sensor can be replaced
with a new one. This is much easier if the robot was built from a kit, where you can pur-
chase a direct replacement from the kit maker.
(*Some of you may object to using the term LED—light emitting diode—for an infrared
emitter. While they technically do not emit light visible to the human eye, it is indeed visible
light to other animals, such as cats, as it is in the near-infrared region of the electromag-
netic spectrum. Therefore, LED is the correct term.)
Testing the Remote Control
There are several simple ways to test if a remote control is working. One easy approach
is to place the remote near an AM radio. Dial to a position where there is no station (a
distant station is okay). Press buttons on the remote. You'll be able to hear a high-pitched
“trill” sound as you press the buttons. If you do not hear the sound, the remote is not
working at all.
In instances where the basic electronics of the remote are working, but its infrared LED
is not, you can test this with an LED sensor, available at RadioShack and many other elec-
tronics stores. The sensor is a passive device: It glows after exposure to a bright infrared
light source.

Robot Radio Links
Radio communications can be used in robotics for two pri-
mary purposes:
• To command the robot, either completely for all its dis-
crete functions, or to provide general commands for
basic operations, such as Run or Stop. General com-
mands may also be used to select and activate programs
already resident in the robot's computer.
• To receive data from the robot, usually either a video sig-
nal or some form of telemetry. 
Radio links are common for discrete function control in combat robotics. The operator
of the robot uses an R/C transmitter (outfitted with a frequency crystal for land use, rather
than airplane use) to operate the motors and weapons of the robot. Typical transmitters
have four or five channels, with each channel operated by the twin joysticks and other
knobs on the transmitter. At a minimum, three channels are used: one each for the right
and left motors, and one for the weapon.
Video is a typical application for receiving a radio signal from a robot. Video transmitters
and receivers that operate in the 2.4 GHz microwave range are common and fairly inex-
pensive—under $150 or $200 for the pair. Range is limited to under 200 feet outdoors, or
from 20 to 50 feet when used indoors.
Wireless data modems are used for sending digital data to a robot or for receiving
data. High-speed wireless data modems are expensive, so most applications call for rela-
tively low speeds from 2,400 bits per second (bps) to a ceiling of 19,200 bps. This is con-
siderably slower than even today's slowest computer modems, but the low speed is nec-
essary to preserve data integrity.
When selecting a receiver and transmitter for wireless data between you and your
robot, consider the following:
• Power output determines range. Depending on your country's laws, higher power out-
puts may require certification of the device or even licensing. In the U.S., most wireless
data modems operate at a power output that does not require licensing.
• Range contributes to maximum data rate. Data rates can be fastest over shorter dis-
tances, because the received signal is clearer. Over longer distances, the data rate
must be reduced in order to reduce or eliminate errors.
• The right antenna can greatly increase range. Radio-frequency signals radiating from a
properly designed and mounted antenna will travel further than signals from a transmit-
ter without an antenna. Be sure to use an antenna properly matched for the transmitter
you are using—sometimes, it's just a simple wire, but consult the documentation on
how to position or wrap the wire. 
• Use a compatible antenna on the receiver. The same rules apply to the receiver as to
the transmitter. Be sure to consider the orientation of the antennas on the receiver and
the transmitter—if the units have stick antennas, avoid having one point up, while the
other points sideways.
Alternatives to RF Modules
Purchasing an RF transmitter and receiver module is one way to provide a communica-
tions link between you and your robot. In additional, several ready-made products can
be hacked for their RF systems and pressed into use as radio links between you and
your bot.
Wireless modules can be used
to communicate with your
robot.

qr Competitions
Robotic competitions are all the rage these days. The
televised combat matches are but one kind of robotic
competition; there’s a large number of robots that com-
pete in a variety of engineering challenges, including
robot sumo, where two robots try to push each other
outside of a playing mat; soccer and ball playing; maze
solving; and even simulated firefighting. The common
attribute of these competitions is that, in almost all
cases, the robot is acting completely on its own. In the
TV combat games, the robot is commanded by a
human, using a remote-control link.
The following sections list many of the most popular
robot competitions worldwide. The first section is filled
with general competitions and varied challenges.
Subsequent sections highlight specific competition
events. Most competitions are held annually, and some
are not open to the general public.

So You Want to Enter a Competition
Competitions help hone important robot-building skills. They can also be fun; and if you
lose, disappointing. Keep the following in mind if you're planning on entering a robot com-
petition.
• Don't wait until the last minute to start! Beginners especially grossly underestimate the
time it takes to build a working robot. Start months before the competition event.
Ideally, don't register for the event unless your robot is done or nearly done.
• Match your robot with the competition. Just because you built a vacuum-cleaning
buddy doesn't mean it'll kick robutt in a sumo competition. Know the limitations of your
robot and what it's best designed to do.
• Start small, and work up. Don't try to build C3P-0 for your first robot. Start with a simple
project, and enter a less-challenging competition. Go up from there.
• Read the rules before building your robot. If you're targeting a specific competition for a
new robot, download and read the rules for the event before you start construction. It
will save you from costly mistakes.
• Read the rules before entering the competition. If your robot is already built, you still
need to read the rules to make sure it qualifies. Measure and weigh your robot to be
sure it's not over- or undersized for the competition.
• Enter the proper event class. Many competitions have several events, differentiated by
class: The class may be by weight, size, age (yours, not the robot's), or school grade.
• Don't try to bend the rules. You and your robot will probably be disqualified and all your
work will be for nothing.
• Above all, have fun. Competitions are meant to be a challenge. If you don't like to be
challenged, competitions aren't for you. Even if you don't win, you'll still learn a lot in
the process, and you'll meet others who share your passion for robotics.

Typical robot combat involves human operators con-
trolling a remotely operable “robot” (I put “robot” in
quotes because there are some who feel these aren’t
real robots). The most famous combat robots have so
far appeared on television, but regional—and untele-
vised—combat events are starting to appear as well.
Many of the combat robots are outfitted with various
weapons, such as saw blades, pickaxes, and hammers.
Also included in this section are some support sites for
builders and fans of combat robots, including how-tos
for better robot battle.

Care and Feeding of the “Combot”
Combat robots (combots) are designed to inflict damage on an opponent. That makes
them potentially dangerous to humans, too. So, if you're planning on building a combat
robot—whether or not you enter competitions—remember, safety is Rule One. Ignoring
safety procedures, or lapsing into carelessness, may cost you fingers, hands, arms, eyes,
even your life.
Here are some simple pointers to keep in mind when building and experimenting with a
combat robot:
1. Don't even think about building a combat robot unless you're experienced. They are
not for first-timers.
2. Don't try to skimp on the proper materials, especially for the weapons systems of the
robot. A fast spinning lawnmower blade needs a proper bearing and housing. Trying to
make do with thin sheet metal, plastic, or other lightweight material may cause dam-
age to your robot, and you!
3. Always work with a friend. Have your friend standing by while you try out the remote
controls of the robot.
4. Because of their weight, and the need for good speeds, most combat robots use
motors requiring 30 to 100 amps of battery current. Batteries that deliver this much
current are dangers in themselves if they are not treated with respect. Never short out
the terminals of the battery just to “see what would happen.” I'll tell you what will hap-
pen: You'll melt the metal used to short the terminals, you'll get severe—and possibly
life-threatening—shock and burns.
5. Work in an adequately sized workshop. Never, ever operate the weapon system of
the robot while in an enclosed room (do it outside, in the open) or while you or others
are nearby. There's a reason they have thick, unbreakable plastic surrounding the are-
nas in televised robot bouts.
6. The machinery and tools used to build a heavy-duty robot can be just as dangerous
as the robot. Wear protective gear and always use safe materials-handling proce-
dures. If you're welding the robot frame, be sure you know all about welding safety.
Yes, people have burned down their houses because of careless welding practices.
Don't be the next!
7. Finally, if you doubt your construction abilities, pass on the combat robot and build
something else.

The playing mat is typically 6 feet in diameter and is
painted black. A white stripe is painted near the outside
rim of the mat and is used by the robot to help it deter-
mine the boundary of the playing field.
Sumo competitions are separated into weight classes.
All robots within a class must weigh less than the stipu-
lated amount, such as 2, 10, or 20 pounds. No
weaponry is typically allowed in a sumo competition—
it’s all about pushing.

Tips for Effective Sumo Robot Wrestling
If you've ever watched a real sumo-wrestling match, then you know that at least part of
the sport relies on weight and girth. Same with sumo robot wrestling, where the aim is to
push your opponent outside the game field—usually a round, black circle. All things con-
sidered, a heavier robot will push a lighter robot aside, but there is more science involved
than you might think.
• In most competitions, the advantage of weight is minimized by putting contestants into
various classes. For the most part, you'll want your robot to be on the heavier side of
its class, for any advantage that might give you.
• Still, bear in mind that the heavier the robot, the harder it might be for its motors to pro-
vide adequate speed and torque. Don't blindly sacrifice agility for weight. A fast-moving
robot can more readily get out of trouble or position itself for a sideways push.
• Wheel traction is critical. Be sure to read the rules for the competition, as you may be
restricted on the size, material, and thickness of the wheels you use. Soft rubber pro-
vides better traction and helps prevent your opponent from pushing you off the play
field. Wider wheels offer increased surface area and therefore better traction.
• A low center of gravity ensures your robot won't be easily turned over. A low, squat
robot is usually the best design.
• Many sumo robots use a scoop-like shovel at the front to partially lift their competitors
off the play field. Once lifted, robots are easy prey. See if the competition rules allow for
a shovel (most do not permit a weapon).

Giving Your ‘Bot a Brain
Even the Scarecrow from The Wizard of Oz wanted a brain. You want your robot to be
at least as smart as the Scarecrow, right? You can be your own wizard of Emerald City
by giving out brains to your robotic creations. Instead of some phoney-baloney
diploma, the brains you give your robots will be electronic in nature. The only trick is—
which electronics?
Noncomputer Electronic Components
Noncomputer discrete components—transistors, resistors, capacitors, and integrated cir-
cuits—can be used to control a robot. Such robots typically are "hard-wired" to perform
some task, such as follow a line or seek out light. BEAM robots are a good example of
machines that have noncomputer brains: No number crunching is going on in their elec-
tronics. Rather, simple electronic circuits compel the robot to move.
A popular design uses a 555 timer IC to control a motor. Separate 555 chips control
each motor of a two-wheeled robot. The 555 timer outputs a series of short pulses, and
the duration of these pulses determines the speed of the motor. If one motor goes a little
slower than the other, the robot will move in wide, sweeping arcs. Add some bumper
switches to the robot to back it up and another 555 to time how long the robot reverses
direction, and the machine will do a remarkable job of navigating around a room.
Watching the robot, you'd think the thing were controlled by a computer, but its "brain"
is a simple collection of parts you can buy at Radio Shack. (If you're interested, the design
for such a robot can be found in the book, Mobile Robots: From Inspiration to
Implementation, among other sources.)
Computers and Microcontrollers
As attractive as noncomputer brains are, they are basically "hard-wired" as circuitry, and
making changes to them requires lots of work. A robot controlled by a computer can be
“rewired” simply by changing the software running on the computer. 
There is an almost endless variety of computers that be used as robot brains. The
three most common are:
• Microcontroller, programmed either in assembly language or a high-level language
such as Basic or C. The LEGO Mindstorms RCX is a good example of a robot run from
a microcontroller. Microcontrollers are available in 4-, 8-, 16-, and 32-bit versions (plus
a few others, for special purposes). The Basic Stamp, PICmicro, AVR, OOPic, and
BasicX are good examples of microcontrollers commonly used in amateur robotics.
• Single board computer, also programmed either in assembly language or a high-level
language, but generally with more processing power than a microcontroller. Single
board computers (SBCs) are a lot like "junior PCs," but on a single circuit board. In fact,
many SBCs are IBM PC-compatible and use Intel microprocessors capable of running
any Intel-based program, including the MS-DOS operating system. A common SBC
form factor is PC/104, which gets its name from "Personal Computer" (originally of IBM
fame) and the number of pins (104) used to connect two or more PC/104-compatible
boards together.
• Personal computer, such as a PC compatible or an Apple Macintosh, or even an older
model such as the venerable Commodore 64. A good option for robotics is a PC-com-
patible laptop, particularly the older monochrome models that required less battery
power. They're also fairly inexpensive on the used market.

V Computers-I/O
I/O stands for input/output, circuitry designed to
interface a computer to external circuitry. On a PC,
I/O is used to connect the computer to a printer, for
example. The I/O performs important functions of
conditioning the data and acting as a barrier to prob-
lems caused by the external device. The idea here is
that it’s cheaper to replace an I/O board or module
than the complete computer.
The I/O listed in this section is particularly suited for
robotics and other embedded applications. Depending
on the configuration, I/O can be used with single
board computers (SBCs) or with microcontrollers.
Examples of I/O modules include relay bays (the com-
puter activates the relays from program control), self-
contained Web servers, and generic interfaces to step-
per motor or H-bridge drivers.

Of Inputs and Outputs
Number Five (from the movie Short Circuit) was always shouting about "more input."
Robots need both input and output—ways to get data from the outside world (input), and
ways to control external devices, like motors (output)
There are several specialized forms of I/O found on computers and microcontrollers
that robots can use. Many are proprietary to a given circuit architecture: Microcontrollers
from National may favor one approach; chips from Philips may favor another. In the end,
many do similar jobs. 
Serial Communications
I2C—Inter-Integrated Circuit, a two-wire serial network protocol used by Philips to allow
integrated circuits to communicate with one another. With I2C you can install two or
more microcontrollers in a robot and have them communicate with one another. One
I2C-equipped microcontroller may be the "master," while the others are used for spe-
cial tasks, such as interrogating sensors or operating the motors.
Microwire—A serial synchronous serial communications protocol used in National
Semiconductor products, and popular for use with the PICMicro line of microcontrollers
from Microchip Technologies. Most Microwire-compatible components are used for
interfacing with microcontroller/microprocessor support electronics, such as memory
and analog-to-digital converters.
SCI—Serial communications interface, an enhanced version of the UART, detailed later.
SPI—Serial peripheral interface standard used by Motorola and others to communicate
between devices. Like Microwire, SPI is most often used for interfacing with microcon-
troller/microprocessor support electronics, especially outboard EEPROM memory.
Synchronous serial port—Data is transmitted one bit at a time, using two wires. One wire
contains the transmitted data, and the other wire contains a clock signal. The clock
serves as a timing reference for the transmitted data. Note that this is different from
asynchronous serial communication (see the following), which does not use a separate
clock signal.
UART—Universal asynchronous receiver transmitter, used for serial communications
between devices, such as your PC and the robot's computer or microcontroller.
Asynchronous means that there is no separate synchronizing system for the data.
Instead, the data itself is embedded with special bits (called start and stop bits) to
ensure proper flow. The USART (Universal Synchronous/Asynchronous Receiver
Transmitter) can be used in either asynchronous or synchronous mode, providing for
faster throughput of data.
Data Conversion
ADC—Analog-to-digital conversion transforms analog (linear) voltage changes to binary
(digital). ADCs can be outboard, contained in a single integrated circuit, or included as
part of a microcontroller. Multiple inputs on an ADC chip allow a single IC to be used
with several inputs (4, 8, and 16 input ADCs are common).
DAC—Digital-to-analog conversion transforms binary (digital) signals to analog (linear)
voltage levels. DACs are not as commonly employed in robots; rather they are com-
monly found on such devices as compact disc players.

Pulse and Frequency Management
Input capture—An input to a timer that determines the frequency of an incoming digital
signal. With this information, for example, a robot could differentiate between inputs,
such as two different locator beacons in a room. Input capture is similar in concept to a
tunable radio.
PWM—Pulse width modulator, a digital output that has a square wave of varying duty
cycle (e.g., the "on" time for the waveform is longer or shorter than the "off" time).
Often used with a simple resistor and capacitor to approximate digital-to-analog con-
version, to create sound output, and to control the speed of a DC motor.
Pulse accumulator—An automatic counter that counts the number of pulses received on
an input over x period of time. The pulse accumulator is part of the architecture of the
microprocessor or microcontroller and can be programmed autonomously; that is, the
accumulator can be collecting data even when the rest of the microprocessor/micro-
controller is busy running some other program.
Special Functions
Hardware interrupts—Interrupts are special input that provides a means to get the atten-
tion of a microprocessor or microcontroller. When the interrupt is triggered, the micro-
processor can temporarily suspend normal program execution and run a special sub-
program. 
Comparator—An input that can compare a voltage level against a reference; the value of
the input is then lower (0) or higher (1) than the reference. Comparators are most often
used as simple analog-to-digital converters where HIGH and LOW are represented by
something other than the normal voltage levels (which can vary, depending on the kind
of logic circuit used). For example, a comparator may trigger HIGH at 2.7 volts.
Normally, a digital circuit will treat any voltage over about 0.5 or 1 volt as HIGH; anything
else is considered LOW.
Analog/mixed-signal (A/MS)—Inputs (and often outputs) that can handle analog or digital
signals, under software guidance. Many microcontrollers are designed to handle both
analog and digital signals on the same chip, and to even mix -and match analog/digital
on the same pins of the device.
External reset—An input that resets the computer or microcontroller so that it clears any
data in RAM and restarts its program (the program stored in EEPROM or elsewhere is
not erased).
Switch debouncer—Cleans up the signal transition when a mechanical switch (push but-
ton, mercury, magnetic reed, etc.) opens or closes. Without a debouncer, the control
electronics may see numerous signal transitions and could interpret each one as a sep-
arate switch state. With the debouncer, the control electronics sees just a single transi-
tion.
Input pullup—Pullup resistors (5 to 10K) are required for many kinds of inputs to control
electronics. If the source of the input is not actively generating a signal, the input could
"float" and therefore confuse the robot's brain. The pullup resistors, which can be built
into a microcontroller and activated via software, prevent this floating from occurring.

V Computers-Single Board 
Computers
The term single board computer is a holdover from
days when most computers consisted of a main board
(called the motherboard) and additional peripheral
boards (called daughter cards) for extra features such
as I/O of disk drive interface. Today, even desktop PCs
use a single printed circuit board, all basic functions are
built in-including I/O, disk interface, sound, and dis-
play adapter.
Today the term single board computer has evolved to
mean a compact computer board, especially one that
can be powered by a single 5- or 12-volt voltage source
and that is intended primarily for use as a controller in
a piece of hardware-a so-called embedded application.
Most of the single board computers (SBCs) in this sec-
tion are smaller than 4 inches square.

Single Board Computers
Not long ago, the notion of a computer on a single, small circuit board was science fic-
tion. Now, they're so plentiful you'll find them at hundreds of sources. In this book we pro-
vide a handful of sources to get you started; there are many others, particularly those that
specialize in computers for particular applications, such as controlling an elevator, operat-
ing a construction crane, or adjusting the fuel-air mixture in your car's engine. 
These applications are often referred to as embedded, because a computer is
"embedded" as part of the overall functionality of the device. For this reason, single board
computers are almost universally used for some embedded application, though they are
also of premier interest to robot builders, because of their power, small size, and low
energy requirements.
With the proliferation of single board computers (or SBCs) has also come a dizzying
array of types, sizes, and styles. Fortunately, a form -factor known as PC/104 provides a
handy standard that makes it easier to select and use SBCs and peripherals, even from
among different manufacturers. 
PC/104 boards measure about 3.5 inches square (specifically 90 by 96mm). The "104"
comes from the number of interconnection pins used to stack the boards together. This
stacking allows you to add to a PC/104 SBC without using back planes (like in a PC-com-
patible computer) or connectors and cables. There are both 8- and 16-bit versions for the
PC/104, and there are different options within the specification.
More information on the PC/104 standard can be found at the PC/104 Consortium at:
http://www.pc104.org
While PC/104 is perhaps the most common standard form factor for SBCs, it's not the
only one. A fairly popular SBC is the PCI or ISA "daughter card," designed to fit into an
expansion slot of a PC-compatible (PCI and ISA are connector standards; PCI is the cur-
rent type used in PCs, and ISA is the older 8- and 16-bit style). Though intended to be
used inside another computer, daughter card SBCs are in fact independent computers.
They are for applications that require extra processing power, when you don't want to tax
the main processor of the computer.
Should You Use a PC as a Robot Brain?
The average PC may be desk-bound, but that doesn't mean you can't mount it on your
robot and use it in a portable environment. That said, you may not want to use the com-
puter for your robot's brain. Some PCs are more suited for conversion to mobile robot
use than others. Consider the following qualities of a computer pressed into service as
the brain of an untethered mobile robot:
• Small size. In this case, small means that the computer can fit in or on your robot. A
computer small enough for one robot may be a King Kong to another. Generally speak-
ing, however, a computer larger than about 12 inches by 12 inches is too big for any
reasonably sized 'bot.
• Standard power supply requirements. Some computers need only a few power supply
voltages, most often +5, and sometimes +12. A few, like the IBM PC-compatible,
requires* negative reference voltages of -12 and -5. (*Required is a nebulous thing:
Some PC-compatible motherboards will still function if the -12 and -5 voltages are
absent, though functions such as RS-232 serial may not operate correctly.)
• Accessibility to the microprocessor system bus or an input/output port. The computer
won't do you much good if you can't access the data, address, and control lines. The IBM
PC architecture provides for ready expansion using "daughter" cards that connect to the
motherboard. It also supports a variety of standard I/O ports, including parallel and serial.

• Uni- or bidirectional parallel port. If the computer lacks
access to the system bus, or if you elect not to use that
bus, you should have a built-in parallel port. This allows
you to use 8-bit data to control functionality of your robot.
The Commodore 64, no longer made but still available in
the used market, supports a fully bidirectional parallel
port.
• Programmability. You must be able to program the com-
puter using either assembly language or a higher-level
language such as Basic, C, Logo, or Pascal. 
• Mass storage capability. You need a way to store the
programs you write for your robot, or every time the
power is removed from the computer, you'll have to rekey
the program back in. (Recall that microcontrollers and SBCs equipped with Flash or
EEPROM memory retain their programs even when power is removed.) Floppy disks or
small, low-power hard disk drives are possible contenders here.
• Availability of technical details. You can't tinker with a computer unless you have a full
technical reference manual. The reference manual should include full schematics, or at
the very least, a pinout of all the ports and expansion slots. Some manufacturers do not
publish technical details on their computers, but the information is usually available from
independent book publishers. Visit the library or a bookstore to find a reference manual
for your computer.
Using an AC Inverter for a PC Power Source
You've read elsewhere in this section about using a PC motherboard as the brains for
your 'bot. They're cheap, reliable, and very competent computers, but a disadvantage is
their power requirements. Many require different voltages, namely +/-5 and +/-12 volts.
Another option is to power your robot from a 12-volt battery connected to an AC
inverter. These are available at auto supply stores and many department stores that carry
automotive supplies. They are designed to work with the 12-volt system of a car and can
provide enough operating juice to power the typical later-model PC (older models may
use very power-hungry components). The PC plugs into the inverter as if it were a wall
outlet.
AC inverters are available in different wattages. As you might imagine, the higher the
wattage, the more expensive the inverter. You do not need a 3,000-watt inverter; try a
400- to 800-watt version first.
An old 486-class motherboard.
One possible use for this relic
is as a robot brain.

Distributor/Wholesaler
In the retail chain, a distributor is a company or other
organization that purchases specialized product for
resale, either to other distributors, retailers, or end
users. Manufacturers often prefer working strictly
through a distributor for cost reasons: it's cheaper to
sell their product to a small handful of “go-betweeners”
(other distributors or retailers) than thousands-if not
tens of thousands-of end users.
Wholesalers serve a similar purpose as distributors, but
the term is meant to be restricted to those who buy and
sell in quantities. When buying through a distributor,
you can often purchase in single quantities (though
minimum order amounts and extra handling charges
may apply). Wholesalers want you to buy in bulk, and
they offer discounts to make that a more attractive
option.
The companies listed in the Distributor/Wholesaler
sections run the gamut from high-quantity wholesalers
to what are in effect retail sales of individual compo-
nents. Most of the distributors listed are for industrial
electronics and may serve the needs of garage shop tin-
kers, schools, and companies.
It's important to note that the Internet is changing the
way manufacturers view their distributor/customer
relationships. Thanks to e-commerce and online buy-
ing, the costs of servicing customers are reduced
greatly, allowing more and more manufacturers to deal
directly with the buying public. In some cases, such
direct sales are cheaper than going through a distribu-
tor; in most instances, buying online direct from the
manufacturer is for convenience only.
@
Distributor/Wholesaler-
Industrial Electronics
Distributors and wholesalers of industrial electronics
supply a much broader range of product than the aver-
age electronics retailer. The product may also be avail-
able in larger quantities (possibly representing a sav-
ings, if you need that many), with greater numbers of
options and choices. Most of the companies listed in
this section sell directly, either online or in retail estab-
lishments. Minimum order amounts may apply, so
you'll want to save up your orders to avoid any addi-
tional fees.
Industrial electronics distributors and wholesalers are
used to dealing with purchasing departments of compa-
nies, where X part is specified by the customer, and X
part is shipped. For this reason, most distributors and
wholesalers publish a “line card” showing either the
products they carry or the brands they represent (or
both). If online ordering is not offered, you will need to
locate copies of catalogs from various manufacturers
and order by part number.

Where to Get Stuff: Wholesalers and Manufacturers
Some wholesalers and manufacturers will sell direct to individual users. If the company
has a Web site, their sales terms are usually indicated, and you can find out if they will sell
to you. 
• Wholesalers provide parts in quantity to industry, typically product made by other firms.
They offer attractive discounts because they make up for the low prices with higher vol-
ume. Wholesalers seldom deal with individuals or in low quantities.
• Distributors sell smaller quantities to industry, schools, and sometimes individuals.
Check with the companies near you and ask for their "terms of service." 
• Some electronics manufacturers are willing to send samples of their products —some
free, some at a small surcharge. 
If you belong to a local robotics club or user's group, you may find it advantageous to
go through the club to establish a relationship with a local electronics parts distributor.

Organizations in this section cater mainly to nonelec-
tronic components (these are often referred to as pas-
sive components). This may include hardware used to
build electronic devices, battery holders, wire, cabling,
soldering equipment and supplies, mechanical repair
parts (belts, gears, etc. for VCRs). I have also included
in this section some specialty electronic components,
such as high-end linear and rotary potentiometers,
microphones, speakers, and electron tubes.
Note that some of the companies listed in this section
are wholesalers and deal only with distributors or retail-
ers. However, they make available their catalog, either
online or in printed form, which you can study to deter-
mine the scope of what's available.

RAF sells hardware for use in electronics equipment:
handles, spacers, and fasteners in both English and
metric dimensions. Product listings are in English,
French, and Spanish. Same stuff-just different words.
As an example of how these products might be used,
metal or plastic standoffs can be used to separate the
“decks” of a small robot that makes use of individual cir-
cuit boards or mounting plates, stacked one on top of
the other. Standoffs are different from spacers; the lat-
ter tend to be quite short (under a quarter of an inch);
standoffs are available in lengths up to several inches
and come with or without threaded ends. Depending
on your application, you can choose male or female
threads. A standoff with one male and one female
threaded end can be joined end to end to make a
longer standoff.
The company offers a free sampler kit; their products
are available from local distributors, which are listed on
the Web site.

Google Searches for Circuit Examples
You can use Google.com to find thousands of schematics that have been posted online.
Some circuit examples even come with printed circuit board layouts. Of course, you can
never be sure if the examples you find on some Web page have been tested. If in doubt,
contact the author to determine if there are any known issues with the schematic
The basic search phrase is schematic; by placing it first in the search string, Google will
base its returned hits with the highest relevancy to schematic diagrams. Here are some
examples:
schematic motor h-bridge
schematic mosfet transistor h-bridge
schematic "infrared sensor"
schematic "dc-dc converter"

Electronics-Display
Compact display units, typically liquid crystal display
(LCD) panels, are used in robotics as a way for the
machine to talk to its master. Many display modules for
robotics use a serial communications scheme that
requires only one or two I/O lines from the robot's
microcontroller or computer. This conserves the
robot's available I/O lines for other tasks.

Electronic Pet Fences—For Robots
You may have seen them advertised on TV or in one of those "everything for your home"
catalogs. They're electronic pet containment fences, and they're made to keep a wan-
dering dog inside your house or yard. The idea behind them is simple. When you know
how they work, you'll instantly see their application for robotics.
A wire is placed around some perimeter—say, your back yard. Attached to the wire is a
transmitter that produces a low-level radio-frequency signal. The receiver is attached to
your dog's collar. As the dog approaches the perimeter wire, the signal radiating from it
gets stronger. At a certain point, when your dog is right beside the perimeter wire, the
signal is at its strongest. The collar receives this strong signal and produces either a tone
and/or a mild shock as a means of controlling the dog's behavior. The tone isn't loud, and
the shock isn't painful; rather, they are meant to help condition the dog that going beyond
the perimeter is not allowed.
You can use a pet containment system for robotic control, as well. One potential use is
for a robotic lawnmower. Place the perimeter wire at the edges of your lawn. Then retrofit
the collar receiver so that instead of emitting a tone, or producing a shock, it sends a sig-
nal to the robot's microcontroller.
Another method leaves the collar receiver intact, but involves more experimentation on
your part. A telephone pickup coil—the kind designed to attach to the handset of a phone
to record a conversation—makes for a good induction pickup for most pet containment
systems.
Consider that while electronic pet containment systems may be designed to prevent an
animal from going beyond a perimeter, for robotics, they can be used to keep a robot
within a specified zone. Merely reverse the logic condition of the robot's programming:
Keep the robot near the perimeter, instead of avoiding it. In this way, the robot can follow
an invisible electronic "guide fence," a kind of track that keeps the machine on course.
Pet containment fences can be purchased online (several are listed in the
Electronics-Miscellaneous category), as well as from most pet supply stores and
from a number of discount department stores such as Target or Wal-Mart.
IC Cabinet Kits
A number of electronics specialty retailers, such as Jameco and Digi-key, offer preselected
kits of common TTL and CMOS integrated circuits. The kits include a labeled cabinet.
Before buying any IC kits, be sure to do the math: TTL and CMOS chips are among the
least expensive electronic components, so there's no need to pay more than you have to.
Figure the cabinet costs no more than $10. If the kit retails for $140 and contains 350
pieces, then you are paying an average of 37 cents per chip. That's not bad. But if the kit
contains 200 parts, then the price per chip skyrockets to 65 cents each. You might as
well make up your own IC selection. It'll be a lot cheaper.

Of course, you're not limited to using perimeter fences
to keep a robot from crossing over. Just as easily, the
fence can be used as a guiderail, keeping a robot on
course as it rolls around the house or side yard. A side
benefit of adapting an electronic pet containment
fence to your robot is that, unlike your dog, your 'bot
won't leave behind unpleasant little surprises for you to
step in.

Scavenging Parts
Among the best sources for obsolete parts are garage sale
discards. Here is just a short list of the electronic and
mechanical items you'll want to be on the lookout for and
the primary robot-building components they have inside:
• VCRs are perhaps the best single source for parts, and
they are in plentiful supply. You'll find motors, switches,
LEDs, cable harnesses, and IR receiver modules on many
models.
• CD players have optical systems you can gut out if your
robot uses a specialty vision system. Inside you'll find a laser diode, focusing lenses,
miniature multicell photodiode arrays, diffraction gratings, and beam splitters, plus
microminiature motors and a precision leadscrew-positioning device.
• Fax machines contain numerous motors, gears, miniature leaf switches, and other
mechanical parts. 
• Mice, printers, old scanners, disk drives, and other discarded computer peripherals
contain valuable optical and mechanical parts.
• Mechanical toys, especially those that are motorized, can be used either for parts or a
robot base.
Old VCRs are among the best
sources for parts.

American Microsemiconductor specializes in obsolete
and discontinued parts-diodes, transistors, triacs, SCRs,
and integrated circuits. Many of their products are
intended for quantity purchases by manufacturers who
need a replacement source of old or discontinued
parts, but smaller quantities are available as well.
Not all products carried by American Semiconductor
are old or outdated or no longer needed. A good por-
tion is actually still sold by other retailers and is still
made by one or more manufacturers.
Also found on the Web site are some sweet and simple
tutorials on common semiconductors: transistors,
diodes, zeners, MOSFETs, and others.

Breadboard Your Circuits!
Prior to soldering together any electronic circuit, you should
test it with a solderless breadboard. This allows you to con-
firm that circuit works, and it lets you experiment before you
commit it to a permanent circuit board. Solderless bread-
boards consist of a series of holes with internal contacts
spaced one-tenth of an inch apart, just the right spacing for
ICs. You plug in ICs, resistors, capacitors, transistors, and
20- or 22-gauge wire in the proper contact holes to create
your circuit. 
Solderless breadboards come in many sizes. For the
most flexibility, get a double-width board, one that can
accommodate at least 10 ICs. A typical double-width model is shown in the figure. Smaller
boards can be used for simple projects; circuits with a high number of components
require bigger boards. While you're buying a breadboard, purchase a set of prestripped
wires. The wires come in a variety of lengths and are already stripped and bent for use in
breadboards. The set costs $5 to $7, but you can bet the price is well worth it.
Tips to Reduce Static
Static shock—like the kind you get after scuffling your feet on the carpet and touching a
doorknob—can destroy sensitive electronic circuits. Poof! There goes weeks of work on
your latest robot. Here are some simple steps to minimize static.
• Wear low-static clothing and shoes. Wear natural fabrics, such as cotton or wool. Avoid
wearing polyester and acetate clothing. 
• Use an antistatic wrist strap. The wrist strap grounds you at all times and prevents
static buildup.
• Before touching the robot, discharge the static. Go ahead: Touch the doorknob (or
other metal) before picking up the robot.
• Avoid playing with your robots on nylon carpets. Nylon builds up a static charge in most
everything. Wood, title, or linoleum floors are better. So are polypropylene (Olefin) car-
pets, which don't build up as much static.
• If possible, avoid the use of acrylic plastic for the body of the robot. Of all plastics,
acrylics tend to build up the most static charge. If you want to use plastic, opt for ABS,
PVC, or styrene.
• During construction of the robot, ground your soldering iron. A grounded iron not only
helps prevent damage from electrostatic discharge, but it lessens the chance of a bad
shock, should you accidentally touch a live wire. 
• Use component sockets. When building your projects that use ICs, install sockets first.
This reduces the chance of damaging static when soldering, but it also makes it easier
to replace zapped ICs!

This section contains sources for companies that pro-
duce printed circuit boards (PCBs) using standard
automation files you provide to them. These automa-
tion files are prepared using compatible PCB design
software (see the previous section, Electronics-PCB-
Design). The majority of the companies listed here will
produce short runs of PCBs-two or three boards-for a
minimum setup fee. The more boards you order, the
less each board costs, because it is the setup fee that
represents the single largest cost in short-run PCB pro-
duction.
Also listed here are materials for producing your own
PCBs in your workshop, typically using a laser or ink-jet
printer to prepare PCB artwork on transfer film.

• SOT-23 to 6-pin DIP adapter
• Narrow/wide SO to 28-pin DIP adapter
The company also sells some unique “ProtBlock” pre-

Dealing with Failures
Failure design is a type of engineering that assumes nondestructive errors in a system
that self-corrects for problems. In many cases, the specific nature of the problems is not
known ahead of time. Software programs that “catch” unknown errors before they cause
early termination of a program are a good example of simple failure design. 
Knowing that things will always go wrong can help in reviewing the problems inherent in
robotics. Failure is common in all forms of engineering, and building robots is no excep-
tion. As these failures occur, you’ll learn from them, and you’ll build better robots.
Robots can fail in any number of ways: mechanical, electrical, or programming.
Mechanical Failure
You already know that mechanical problems are when something breaks or falls off the
robot. But they’re also design faults, where a robot is engineered or constructed in such
a way that it causes problems. A robot that’s top-heavy is one example: If the center of
gravity is too high, the robot may tip over easily.
The quality of construction and the sturdiness of the materials you use determine how
readily a robot will “come apart at the seams.”  Obviously, a robot made with cardboard
and electrical tape will not last as long as a robot made with wood, plastic, or metal, and
that has proper fasteners to hold everything together.
You can use the “pull test” to determine if your robot construction methods are sound.
Once you have attached something to your robot—using glue, nuts and bolts, or what-
ever system—give it a good tug. If it comes off, the construction isn’t good enough. Look
for a better way.
Electrical Failure
Electronic failures are not as obvious as mechanical ones. Unless your circuit has gone up
in smoke, it may not be readily apparent what’s wrong with it. Too, circuits that functioned
properly in a solderless breadboard during the early design phase may no longer work
once you’ve soldered the components in a permanent circuit, and vice versa. There are
many reasons this can happen, including mistakes in wiring, odd capacitive effects, even
variations in tolerances due to heat transfer.
• Circuit never worked. Review your wiring and make necessary repairs. Double-check
the accuracy of the schematic or drawing you’re working from. Is there a typo?
• Circuit worked before, and now doesn’t. Look for a short circuit or a broken wire. Try
working backward to find the problem. For example, apply power directly to the
motors. If the motors work, you know they’re okay, so try next to manually control
(using jumper wires) the H-bridge motor driver circuit you’re using. If the motors turn,
then the H-bridge is fine, and it’s time to look for problems in the microcontroller or
computer section. 
Other electrical problems may be caused by errors in programming (see the following
section); sensors that are stuck, dirty, or simply unreliable (this is the case with many
proximity sensors using infrared); or weak batteries. Always try a new or freshly charged
set of batteries before you tear your robot apart. Never assume batteries are okay. Test
them under load (that is, connect them up, then take a meter reading).
Programming Failure
More and more robots use computers or microcontrollers as central processing units,
and these are operated by software you give them. If the software contains programming

bugs, the robot may not work at all or it may work only erratically. There are three basic
kinds of programming “bugs”; in all cases, the fix is to review the program, find the error,
and revise the code.
• Compile bugs are caused by bad syntax. Look for misspelled commands, missing
characters (end-of-line semicolons in a C program are a good example), or bad for-
matting. Programming languages that compile your code will usually flag compile time
bugs, but may still let you execute the program on your robot. Be sure to first fix the
problem before you transfer the program to the robot’s microcontroller or computer.
• Run-time bugs are caused by a disallowed condition. A run-time bug isn’t caught by
the compiler. Rather, it occurs when the microcontroller/computer attempts to run the
program. A typical run-time bug is using a data type that is too small to hold the value
expected of it. Example: A byte data type holds values up to 255; a run-time bug may
occur if you attempt to store a value of 256 (in which case you’d chose a word data
type, which can hold numbers to 65,535).
• Logic bugs are when a program doesn’t work the way you expected it to. These are
caused by improper math, incorrect assumptions of how sensors interact with the envi-
ronment, or any other conditions based on false information.

AT&T Labs Natural Voices 
Text-to-Speech Engine

http://www.naturalvoices.att.com/
AT&T's Natural Voices software is among the best-
sounding text-to-speech synthesis ever developed. You
may not even be aware that it's a computer speaking to
you! Variations include male and female voices, and
vocabularies (with the proper accents) are available for
English, neutral Spanish, and German. These vocabu-
laries are implemented as “fonts,” and at the time of
this writing, additional voice fonts for British English,
Parisian French, Castilian Spanish, and others were on
the way.
The software, which runs under Windows, Linux, and
various flavors of Unix, is intended for interactive appli-
cations such as speech-enabled Web pages. However,
the company (smartly) offers the software at very low
cost for desktop use, and that would include using it to
provide your robot with a voice. If your robot operates
from a microcontroller, you can always record little
snips of voices for playback with electronic voice chips.

Making Your Robot Sound Off
Robots shouldn't be mute. Even basic sounds and sound effects can be accomplished
using relatively inexpensive sound-recording chips. One of the best known, and most
common, is the ChipCorder line of digital sound recorders, now manufactured by
Winbond. (You may know them from their previous owner, Information Storage Devices,
or ISD). The ChipCorder ICs are readily available to the electronics hobbyist and amateur
robot builder via a number of mail-order retailers, such as Digi-Key and Jameco.
ChipCorders vary in duration of sound they can record. Versions are available that
record from 30 seconds to 2 minutes of sound. The more sophisticated chips can be
controlled via a microprocessor or microcontroller so that individual segments of sound
can be individually played back. In this way, you can have (say) a minute of recorded
sound, but can play back discrete portions to produce various sound effects or vocal
phrases.
Prices for the chips vary depending on feature and recording time, but most cost under
$15. While there are certainly other makers of sound storage/playback integrated circuits,
the ChipCorder chips are by far the most widely used and among the most affordable.
A rich assortment of datasheets and application notes is available for the ChipCorder
products on the Winbond Web page at http://www.winbond-usa.com/ (Winbond is
based in Taiwan, and this is their U.S. Web site; however, this site contains most of the
ChipCorder downloadable information).
Quadravox (http://www.quadravox.com/) provides value-added circuits based on
the ChipCorder line. One product is a ChipCorder prototyping board, the QV400D, that
lets you experiment with different ChipCorder variations. It comes with everything you
need, including power supply and support software, to create, edit, and implement
recorded sounds on the ChipCorder IC.
Voice Synthesis Text-to-Speech Internet Sites
Not long ago, integrated circuits for the reproduction of human-sounding speech were
fairly common. With the proliferation of digitized recorded speech, however, unlimited
speech synthesizers have become an exception instead of the rule. The companies that
made stand-alone speech synthesizer chips either stopped their manufacture or were
themselves sold to other firms that no longer carry the old speech parts.
If you plan on using recorded (mechanical or electronic) sound with your robot, you
may want to consider any of the several text-to-speech Internet sites, such as the Bell
Labs TTS (Text-to-Speech) project. Software running on the Internet server lets you type
in the text you want to synthesize. A sound file (WAV, AU, or AIFF format) is returned to
you. Save the file and use it for producing a sound sample with a cassette tape or record-
ing chip.
There are several interactive online text-to-speech processing sites, including the fol-
lowing:

is programmed serially, meaning that it's ideally suited
for use with microcontrollers and robotics, where
input/output pins are always in short supply. The chip
is surface mount, however; so you'll need to make a cir-
cuit board if you want to breadboard.

Sound Studio” and the SAM9743 “Single-Chip Music
System.”

(man, woman, big man, child, even a gnat!), and the
spoken speech is returned as an audio clip. You can
save the audio clips to your computer. If your robo con-
tains a digital sound recording chip, like those from
ISD, you can transfer the recorded voice segments to
the chip, and your creation will now have a voice.
Can be slow at times, but worth it.

Work and no play make Tobor a bored robot. That goes
for robot builders,
too. Don’t forget the entertainment side-books, movies,
and art-on robotics themes. Many
of today’s best robot builders were influenced by fic-
tional robots in movies and
books-who hasn’t wanted to build their own R2-D2 after
seeing Star Wars?
The two categories that follow take a look at the enter-
tainment value of robots:
Art-Robots intended as artistic forms of expression,
rather than functional machines. Includes
posters, framable art, cinema special effects, spe-
cialty magazines, “standees” (life-size cardboard
models), museums, and more.

Cinefex is the premier magazine for special effects in

four times a year, is beautifully produced in full color.
Each issue concentrates on the digital, optical, and
mechanical special effects of at least one, and some-
times two or three, motion pictures or television pro-
ductions. The articles are semitechnical, and most film
jargon is explained.
Movies are gravitating to doing more and more special
effects using only computers, but productions with mech-
anical effects (other than explosions and car crash ups)
are still fairly common. The articles on mechanical effects
work are especially notable for robot builders, and you
can learn quite a few secrets and techniques from them.
Back issues are available; I recommend you thumb
through the index at the site to search for topics and
films that interest you. The soldout issues are provided
as xerographic copies. For these, the cover is in color,
but the articles are black and white.

Rad Robot Movies
These movies are out on VHS or DVD. Find them at your local video store. Some are con-
sidered special interest, so they may be available only for sale and not rent.
The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951)
The quintessential robot flick, and yet the robot (Gort) is only a minor character. But what
a character! Tick him off and he’ll open his visor and disintegrate you with a piercing laser
beam. Cool stuff.
Gort was played by Lock Martin, one of the tallest actors (7’7”) ever to work in
Hollywood—first as the doorman of the Graumans Chinese Theater, then as host of a Los
Angeles children’s TV show named The Gentle Giant. The Gort costume (there were two,
with laced “zippers” on the front or back, depending where the camera was placed) was
latex rubber and measured 8’2”.
Despite its age, TDTESS ranks as one of the best science fiction movies ever made. The
special effects are low-tech by today’s standard—the sound effect of Gort’s destructive ray
was created by playing a tape backward—but the story is top-notch, and the action thrilling.
From out of space . . . a warning and an ultimatum. Strange power from another planet
menaces the earth! What is this invader from another planet . . . Can it destroy the earth?
Robot Monster (1953)
Directed by Phil Tucker, Robot Monster is one of those “so bad it’s good” movies. Tucker
directed a number of sex and teen exploitation films in the 1950s (including Dance Hall
Racket, written by legendary comic Lenny Bruce). This flick stars George Nader, a popu-
lar B-picture actor of the 1950s and 1960s.
For whatever reason, the robot in this picture looks like a gorilla in a diving helmet,
probably because the actor playing the robot wore a gorilla suit wearing a deep-sea div-
ing helmet. The robot manages to kill off all but a half-dozen people on earth, then falls in
love. Jeepers! Moon monsters launch attack against earth! How can science meet the
menace of astral assassins?

Forbidden Planet (1956)
Before Leslie Nielson got silly and starred in all those Naked Gun movies, he was a dash-
ing leading man in many 1950s and 1960s movies. Of his most famous is Forbidden
Planet, where he and his crew of space voyagers come to fetch a scientist and his pretty
daughter and return them to Earth. 
Only the scientist doesn’t want to go, and besides he doesn’t need to, because he’s
built his very own mechanical butler, a robot named Robby. Robby is polite, couldn’t hurt
a fly (his programming follows Isaac Asimov’s Three Laws of Robotics, and therefore for-
bids it), and can make smooth, aged whiskey by the gallons. Needless to say, he
becomes a favorite of many, including the audience.
An interesting story and some fine acting, but parts are a tad scary for the little kids.
Robby the Robot would later make a number of guest appearances in other films, on the
Twilight Zone show, and even on the Superman television series.
Kronos (1957)
What do Kronos and mothers-in-law have in common? They both zap the energy out of
everything they come into contact with. Low-budget but still engaging, Kronos the movie
is the story of an alien race that has used up all the electricity of their home planet
(sounds like they’re from California). So, they send a giant robot to Earth to collect all of
our energy.
Kronos is one of many science fiction flicks that takes place predominantly in
California’s high desert—because it was so cheap for Hollywood producers to film there.
To this day, whenever I drive through the Anza-Borrego or Mohave deserts of the U.S.
Southwest, I get an eerie feeling Kronos is right around the next bend.
Parts of Kronos are really cheesy. Don’t expect multi-million-dollar special effects. This
is 1957, after all, the same year Russia launched Sputnik. World-destroying monster!
The Outer Limits, Vol. 41: I, Robot (1963)
An episode of the original Outer Limits television series, this is an adaptation from the Isaac
Asimov short story of the same name. Stars Leonard Nimoy, before he donned his pointed
ears in Star Trek. The robot stands accused of murder, but is it a machine or a man?
This prototypical episode of the Outer Limits was directed by Leslie Stevens, who
would later turn out the movie Incubus, starring William Shatner, another Trek alumnus.
The movie is memorable on many counts, the least of which it is entirely in the Esperanto
language! No robots, though—probably because robots don’t speak Esperanto.
Westworld (1973)
Written and directed by Michael “Jurrasic Park” Crichton, Westworld explores what hap-
pens when humans put too much trust into machines. It’s a story line that Crichton would
explore many times in his films, using various technologies that “go worng.”
Westworld is one of three “worlds” in an interactive resort for rich folks. The guests are
real, but just about everything else is a machine, including the gunslingers and the hook-
ers. What goes worng in Westworld is a gunbot, played deftly by Yul Brenner. For some
unknown reason, the programming for Yul and the rest of the robots get scrambled (they
must be running Microsoft Windows!), and they end up killing all but one guest.
There are few special effects with robot-like mechanisms, except for a fairly unrealistic
shot of the inside of Yul Brenner’s head. Enjoy this movie more for its “be careful what
you ask for” mid-1970s message about high-tech. Westworld . . . where robot men and
women are programmed to serve you for . . . romance . . . volence . . . anything.

entertainment-books & movies
161
The Terminator (1984)
Forever frightening all of the women in the world unlucky enough to be named Sarah
Conner, The Terminator put actor Arnold Schwarzenegger on the Map of the Stars. Great
effects for such a low-budget film.
The Terminator robot is a cyborg: human-looking on the outside, but high-tech machine
on the inside. Except for some brief shots at the beginning of the film, it’s not until the end
of the movie do we see the innards of the Terminator: chrome-plated “bones” operated
by powerful hydraulic systems. In reality, “it’s only a model” (in the words of Monty
Python). No working robot was ever created for the film; what you see is a cleverly
designed puppet operated by cables. It looks real enough!
The Terminator skeleton was designed by veteran Hollywood mechanical and makeup
effects artist Stan Winston. Winston was also responsible for the mechanical and creature
effects for such films as Aliens, Inspector Gadget, Small Soldiers, Galaxy Quest, and
Terminator III. He’s one of the best.
Short Circuit (1986)
Let’s forget the human characters in this film. Please. Instead, just concentrate on the
robots, designed by conceptual artist Syd Mead, and expertly crafted by effects supervi-
sor Eric Allard. 
Briefly, Short Circuit is about a group of five battlefield robots. One robot is accidentally
electrocuted, and this somehow fuses his computer, causing him to become alive. Now a
sentient creature, this robot—referred to as Number Five—fears for his life and escapes.
The rest of the movie is about Number Five being chased by the security department of
the Big Bad Defense Company that created him.
Actual working (remotely controlled) robots were created for the movie, which makes
Short Circuit one of the few films that employed real robotic actors. (For some shots, bits and
pieces of the Number Five robot were controlled by cable using off-screen puppeteers.)
If you can find it, get a copy of issue 28 of the magazine Cinefex (see
http://www.cinefex.com/ for starters). This issue contains an in-depth article covering
the construction of the Short Circuit robots by Allard and his All Effects Company.
Enlightening reading. Something wonderful has happened. . . . Number Five is alive!
Robot Jox (1990)
Little story but cool special effects. The robots are huge, legged vehicles used in combat
death matches. An early incarnation of the MechWarriors concept. The ultimate killing
machine, part man, part metal.
The Iron Giant (1999)
Agree or disagree, this movie is not only one of the best robot films ever made, but also
one of the best animated pictures, ever! 
The Iron Giant takes place amid the fear and suspicion of the late 1950s (1957, to be
precise). The Soviet Union had just launched Sputnik (see Kronos, above), and Americans
were sure the next “man-made moon” would contain a nuclear bomb, dropped into the
middle of their sleepy little town.
Something does fall from the sky, but it’s not what folks are expecting; it’s a giant robot
sent to earth for some unknown reason. The robot feeds itself by eating metal. Before
you can say “pass the ketchup, please,” the hulking ‘bot becomes entangled in some
high-voltage power lines and is on the brink of destruction. Enter our hero, nine-year-old
Hogarth Hughes, who saves the robot and ends up becoming best pals with it.

Entertainment-books & movies

What might have been just another “kid and his big robot buddy” film, The Iron Giant is
unique in how it deals with humanity, even when that humanity comes from a metal
leviathan. Vin Diesel plays the voice of the robot.
Two end effectors up! It came from outer space!
Honorable Mentions
Doctor Who (1975)—British television series co-starring the Daleks, a race of really,
really bad robots. There are some older Doctor Who movies that you might enjoy, as well.
Daleks are in many of them.
Gigantor (1965)—An early Japan animation series where a little boy controlled his
very own giant robot. They fought crime together.
Lost in Space (1965-1968)—Sold to the CBS network as “the Swiss Family Robinson
in outer space,” this television series started out as serious, but is best viewed today as
the ultimate in camp. When the show was first on, I had a major crush on Angela
Cartwright (she played Penny Robinson), so I didn’t pay much attention to The Robot
(sometimes referred to by fans as Robot B9 or Robot YM-3). 
Others noticed the machine over the cute brunette, and some of them have even cre-
ated their own scratch-built LIS robots, faithful down to the red grippers.
Fun fact: The original pilot for Lost in Space lacked both The Robot and the miserable
Dr. Smith. Good thing producer Irwin Allen reshot the pilot with these two great charac-
ters added.
Lost in Space (1998)—Not everyone’s cup of tea, but a personal favorite for me, this
full-feature version of the 1960s television show is packed with modern mechanical and
digital effects. The Robot is a radically updated version of the TV model. After the movie
came out, there were truckloads of models and toys based on this robot.
Metropolis (1927)—Considered the first science fiction epic film, Metropolis is per-
haps best known for the shapely metallic robotrix created by the mad scientist, Dr.
Rotwang. Look carefully at the background walls of his laboratory: You’ll see an upside
down pentagram; this symbol is often considered the sign of witchcraft and the occult.
The symbology is not accidental. Metropolis came out during a period when the world
was reeling from the effects of the industrial revolution. Suspicion of mechanics outstrip-
ping humanity helped set the notion that people who created artificial life were evil. Isaac
Asimov’s robot stories, and his Three Laws of Robotics, were aimed at reversing this
long-held stereotype.
Silent Running (1972)—An allegory of the many ills besetting the United States during
the Vietnam War era, Silent Running stars Bruce Dern as a sort of interstellar gardener.
With the aid of three small robots, he tends to Earth’s last remaining agriculture, which is
now limited to several “pods” on a space ship. The anthropomorphic robots are a high-
light of the film, but they are not mechanical; each one has a person inside it.
Star Wars (1978 to ??)—Honorably mentioned here because the films, and the
robots in them, get mentioned so much everywhere else. Who doesn’t know about C-
3PO and R2-D2? ‘Nuff said.

Fasteners
Fasteners are the often forgotten element of robot con-
struction. The smallest and simplest robots don't need
fasteners, of course-you can just tape or glue the parts
together. But larger 'bots need more substantial hard-
ware to keep everything in its place, and that means an
assortment of screws, nuts, washers, bolts, and other fas-
teners.
The local hardware store is a great source for fasteners.
It'll have most everything you need, in a variety of sizes.
But while hardware stores are prime sources for fasten-
ers, they are neither the only source, nor the best. Not
all sizes are available, and retail hardware stores typi-
cally sell small packages of fasteners at a huge markup.
You'll go broke buying packages of four or five machine
screws; bulk packages will save lots of money. Alas,
though many hardware stores sell some bulk fasteners,
they only offer the more popular types and sizes in such
packaging.
The listings that follow are fastener specialty outlets.
With few exceptions, they conduct business by mail
order or online, and a few have local stores. Most fas-
tener retailers sell in quantity, and pass on the savings
to you. They also provide more variety, including spe-
cialty nylon and plastic fasteners (which weigh less than
steel), unique drive styles, unusual sizes or lengths, and
metric.
Before purchasing fasteners, determine which sizes you
use the most. If possible, settle on a few standard sizes;
you'll save money. Consider using smaller hardware
when practical. It's cheaper and lighter. Case in point:
The smallest fasteners of my first robots were 6/32,
because that's all the local hardware stores sold in bulk.
Yet 6/32 is oversized for many applications for small
robots. These days, I gravitate toward 4/40 fasteners,
purchased from a specialty fastener retailer in bulk. Not
only does 4/40 hardware weigh about 50 percent less
than 6/32 hardware, it's cheaper to boot.

the physical traits of the fasteners you want, such as
head type, drive type, size, finish, thread type, and
more. You can buy in low quantity, but the savings really
kick in when you buy in bulk.
One important note: The site often lists a “carton quan-
tity” that may be lower than the same quantity sold as
bulk. This happens when the carton quantity is the
same as an offered bulk quantity (for example, bulk
quantity of 1,000 pieces, and a carton with a 1,000
pieces). It's easier to sell a precounted box of fasteners
than it is to count the number of pieces (usually by
weight) sold in bulk; you pay for the extra handling
then.

Fascinated by Fasteners
One way to put a robot together is with chewing gum and
bailing wire. It works until the gum dries out and the bail-
ing wire breaks off. For a more permanent construction,
use fasteners—screws, nuts, bolts, and assorted hard-
ware. Most fasteners are made so they can be applied
and later removed. Removing fasteners is handy if you
need to rebuild your robot or want to disassemble parts so you can reuse them.
Construction techniques using permanent glues and adhesives don't allow for easy
disassembly.
There are many kinds of fasteners. The most common for robotics construction is the
machine screw. It's like a regular garden-variety household screw, except it does not
have a tapered end. The end is flat, because the screw is meant to be secured with a nut
or other retainer. Machine screws are also sometimes called bolts, but the current trend
is to reserve “bolt” for large fasteners. Cars are put together with bolts; amateur robots
are put together with machine screws.
Machine screws vary by size and number of threads per inch (or per millimeter, for
metric fasteners) and also by the head type and the driver type. Pan and flat-head types
are common finds at any hardware store, though also available are round, oval, truss,
and Fillister. Common drive types are slotted and Phillips; Torx, hex, and Pozidrive can be
purchased from fastener specialty outlets. The alternative drive types are recommended
for high-torque applications or if a fastener needs to be removed often.
Nuts are used to hold machine screws in place. There are hex (six-sided) nuts, blind
nuts that dig into soft material, self-locking nuts that have a nylon insert, Tinnerman nuts
(these are flat pieces of metal that act as retainers), wing nuts, and many others. For
obvious reasons, the nut must match—in both size and threads per inch—with the
machine screw it's intended for.
Flat washers are used to spread the tension of the screw and nut across a larger area.
Lock washers (teeth on the inside, outside, or both; as well as split) help prevent the nut
from working itself loose from the screw.
While most of us are familiar with standard zinc-plated steel fasteners, there are in fact
many other materials used to make screws, nuts, and washers.
• Stainless steel offers added strength and resistance against rusting or corrosion.
• Brass is a softer metal that's most often used for looks.
• Nylon is considerably lighter than steel or brass and is advantageous when weight is a
concern.
• Aluminum is used when a metal fastener is desired and weight is a consideration. It's
also the preferred fastener for aluminum structure, as it will not cause corrosion (which
can happen if you use steel fasteners with aluminum framing).
Depending on the source, steel fasteners are available in plain zinc finish and also
black oxide, hot-dipped galvanized (useful for applications where water or the elements
might cause rust or other corrosion), and colored zinc—green and yellow are common
choices.
When shopping for fasteners, note that you can save considerably by purchasing in
quantity. At the hardware store, a package of ten #8 machine screws may cost 99 cents,
yet a package of 100 may be priced at $3.99. The price difference is buying in bulk. If you
think you'll make heavy use of a certain size fastener in your robots, invest in the bigger
box, and pocket the savings.
Nuts, screws, and washers
make up the most common
fasteners used in robotics.

Understanding Thread Sizes
What do the values 4/40, 6/32, 8/32, and others mean? These are thread sizes. For fas-
teners under 1/4 inch, thread sizes are denoted using this fractional nomenclature.
The first number represents a standard diameter of the screw using a standard sizing
metric (akin to shoe sizes). The second is the number of threads per inch (also called
pitch). Given a 6/32 machine screw, for example, the screw is a size #6 (9/64-inch, or
0.140625-inch), and there are 32 threads to the inch. Pitch is coarse or fine, so not all #6
screws are 32 pitch.

A Cornucopia of Machine Screw Drive and Head Styles
Machine screw fasteners come in a variety of drive and head styles. Here is an overview
of the several commonly available drive and head types, and what makes them unique.
Slotted
Made for general fastening and low torque
drive; screwdriver may slip from the slot.
Phillips
Cross-point drive resists drive slippage, but
lots of slots become easily stripped out
when using an improperly sized driver.
Hex, Torx, Pozidrive
Specific size and type of driver required,
which minimizes stripping. Disadvantage:
You must have the proper tool to
fasten and unfasten.
Pan
Good general-purpose fastener; shallow
head provides less grip for the driver.
Round
Taller head protrudes more than pan head,
but provides greater depth for driver. Good
for higher-torque applications.
Countersunk
Used when head must be flush with the
materials surface. Requires countersunk
hole. Also called flat head.
Fillister
Extra deep head for very high torque.
Hex bolt
Uses no slot, and requires wrench to
tighten. For highest-torque applications.

Metric Conversion Table
Metric fasteners don't use the same sizing nomenclature as their SAE cousins. Screw
sizes and pitches are defined by a standardized diameter notation, the thread pitch (num-
ber of threads per millimeter) followed by length—all in millimeters. For example:
M2-0.40-5mm
Means the screw is 2mm in diameter, has a pitch of 0.40 threads per millimeter, and
has a length of 5mm. Note that most metric screws use standard threads, so the pitch
may be omitted:
M2-5mm

Fests and Shows
In this section you'll find listings for amateur radio fests
(called hamfests) and general electronics swap meets.
These events, held on a regular basis-some monthly,
some yearly-are good sources for new and used compo-
nents for robot building.
ARRL: Database of Hamfests
203549
http://www.arrl.org/hamfests.html
Database of upcoming hamfests, swap meets set up and
patronized by ham radio enthusiasts. But you'll find
more than radio gear at most hamfests; many are good
sources for general surplus electronics and surplus
mechanicals, including motors, solenoids, relays, sol-
dering stations, tools, and more. Hamfests are usually
held on Saturdays, and many start early in the morning.
To get the best deals, get there as early as possible, or
else the good stuff will already be gone.

x Internet
Like the opening remarks introducing a famous
speaker at a banquet, “The Internet needs no introduc-
tion.” This global resource brings together buyer and
seller, student and teacher, database and researcher,
and much more. Since the early 1990s, when the
Internet was opened for commercial exploitation, it’s
become the number one resource for finding robotics
information and products. 
The sections that follow break up the Internet into
cohesive units that are of primary importance and rele-
vance to robot builders. These units include bulletin
boards and mailing lists, educational and government
labs where high-end robotics research takes place,
informational sites, search engines, Usenet news-
groups, and plenty more.
x Internet-Bulletin 
Board/Mailing List
Before the Internet came along, robot builders had to
settle for “talking shop” while sitting around a big
pickle barrel every Thursday night at Sam’s Feed and
Hay store. Still, it was a great way to share construction
ideas, trade horror stories, and ask for advice. These
days, we have the Internet as the virtual equivalent of
Sam’s hospitality, with thousands upon thousands of
bulletin boards and mailing lists that cater to a variety
of special interests. 
Though bulletin boards and mailing lists serve about
the same purpose—they let individuals read and post
messages—they work differently from each other, and
each has its pros and cons.
• Bulletin boards (also called forums) are Web sites
where you can read messages left by others and, if
the mood strikes you, post replies of your own. In
most cases, the bulletin board is software than runs
on the Web server, and you need only a Web
browser to use it. A few bulletin boards require add-
in browser software, namely, Java and JavaScript.
• Mailing lists are conducted via e-mail. You sign up to
receive messages, and every message posted to the
list is sent to you. If you want to reply to a message,
you just dash off an e-mail. The e-mail is sent to the
list, not directly to the person who posted the origi-
nal message.
Mailing lists are great for low-volume messaging; when
the messages get to 20 or 30 a day, you may wish to get
the digest version of the mailing list (if one is made
available). Bulletin boards require a special trip to the
appropriate Web site, but you can read only those mes-
sages with topics that interest you.
Among the most popular bulletin boards/mailing lists
are the Yahoo eGroups. Each group specializes in a cer-
tain topic, such as programming with the Atmel AVR
microcontroller or general robotics. You have a choice
of reading all messages on the Yahoo site (this would be
the “bulletin board setting)” or receiving messages via
e-mail. You can opt to receive all messages or just daily
digest versions.

are on computing topics, and there’s a strong anti-
Microsoft sentiment, there are plenty of articles and dis-
cussion threads on robotics, LEGO, and artificial intel-
ligence. 
Most discussion threads begin with a posting about
some article, news story, or Web page. Thousands of
readers flock to the link and often overwhelm it-this is
called “being slashdotted.” If you try to visit a link listed
in a current discussion thread and it’s unavailable, try

intense rush of interest.

Some of the best robotics research is taking place in
educational institutions and government labs. Much of
it is open to public inspection (since taxpayer money
funds it), so educational and government lab sites are a
treasure trove of ideas for robotics.
There is a lot to see at many of the educational and gov-
ernment labs listed in this section, and you’ll want to
spend time poking around to see what you can find. For
example, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
(MIT) site contains dozens of subsites, with perhaps

So, What Does Your Robot Do?”
If robot makers had a dollar for every time someone asked them that, they’d be neck and
neck with Bill Gates as the world’s richest people. But to be fair, the uses of amateur
robots aren’t always clear.
Here’s a short list of common robotic functions, should you be wondering what your
robot should do—whether you’ve built it already or not.
• Wanderer. This robot does nothing special, except explore. Entire counties have been
built and populated thanks to the explorers, so this is a great job for any robot!
• Line tracer. A simple robot that traces a line is a precursor to many types of worker mach-
ines that dutifully follow a track. Includes delivery robots, sentry robots, and many others.
• Wall follower. Like a line tracer, the wall follower seeks to navigate its realm guided by
the perimeters of a room. All rooms have walls or other boundaries of some type, and
they can be used by simple machines for simple navigation.
• Maze solver. The typical maze-solving robot is an enhanced version of the wall follower.
Mazes can be solved using various algorithms that are based on following the walls of
a maze in a certain sequence.
• Vacuum cleaner. This group encompasses any class of janitorial robot, whether it
cleans the carpets, waxes the floor, or mows the lawn. The issues are the same: Do
some work within a confined space, without knocking over people, pets, and things.
• Burglar alarm/sentry. If a robot is going to wander or trace a line or follow a wall, it
might as well do something constructive at the same time. Robots make for perfect
“mobile burglar alarms” or sentries. Equip yours with a video camera and it can record
crooks in the act. Given the proper sensors, the robot might also sniff out noxious
fumes, like carbon monoxide.
• Drink server. Mobile or stationary robots can serve drinks, appetizers, and other food.
The robot must have a strong arm that can lift the glass or food, which makes them
among the harder machines to build.
• Robot gladiator. Whether the robot fights sumo style or head to head in a death match,
robot gladiators are either autonomous or remote-controlled virtual combatants.
• Firefighter (simulation). There are real firefighting robots, and most are teleoperated by
a human. For a self-governing firefighting robot, simulation is almost as good. Most fire-
fighting contests are designed to prove a design and are staged in miniature “houses”
with candles as the fire.
• Personal assistant. We’re talking simple stuff here, like alarm clocks for waking up in
the morning.
• Educational experience. Let’s not forget that building any robot teaches important
mechanical and scientific principles to the maker. That ought to be worth something today.
• Conversation piece. A robot of your very own, especially one you built, is a great ice-
breaker at parties.

Self-Contained versus Tethered Robots
What's a real robot? One commonly accepted definition says that it's a self-contained,
autonomous (self-governed) machine that needs only occasional instructions from its
master to set it about its various tasks. A self-contained robot includes its own power
system, brain, wheels (or legs or tracks), and manipulating devices such as claws or
hands. The robot does not depend on any other mechanism or system to perform its
tasks. It's complete, in and of itself.
However, this definition ignores the legions of factory robots that are, in effect,
mechanical arms connected to a computer someplace else in the room. They are consid-
ered “robots” partly because of convention: The term was used by their early creators,
and it's stuck ever since.
Self-contained robots are those that incorporate all of the necessary ingredients for a
self-governed machine—sensors, processing, and mechanical action—all in one box.
Such a robot may be mobile or stationary. A mobile robot has wheels, legs, or some other
form of locomotion. The typical mobile robot is designed either for exploring or delivering;
the typical stationary robot is designed for manipulating objects, such as for construction
or handling dangerous materials.
Tethered robots, on the other hand, are robots in form, but not necessarily in intelli-
gence. The mechanism that does the actual task is the robot itself; the support electron-
ics or components may be separate. The link between robot and control components
might be a wire, a beam of infrared light, or a radio signal. Though only marginally consid-
ered robots, the tethered variety comprise the bulk of all robots in existence today.
Reality versus Fantasy
Where does reality end and fantasy begin? When building robots, the line isn't always
clear. Separating reality from fantasy helps avoid overreaching designs and lost effort.
Fantasy is a Star Wars R2-D2 robot projecting a hologram of a beautiful princess. Reality
is a home-brew robot that rambles down the hallway, maybe even hitting the walls as it
goes. Fantasy is a giant killer robot what walks on two legs and shoots a death ray from a
visor in its head. Reality is a foot-tall “trashcan” robot that offers houseguests a diet soda.
Sure, everyone wants to build a robot that fully replicates human intelligence and abili-
ties, but the reality is that such a robot is far away, even for engineering teams spending
millions of dollars. It's important to be wary of impossible plans. Don't attempt to give
your robot features and capabilities that are beyond your technical expertise or budget.
Here's an idea to help keep you on the reality track: When designing your robot, write
some notes about what you want it to do, then put the notes away. Let them gel in your
brain for a week or two. Quite often, when you review your original design, you will realize
that some of the features and capabilities are mere wishful thinking and beyond the
scope of your time, finances, or skills. Make it a point to refine, alter, and adjust the
design of the robot before, and even during, construction.

Autonomous Robot Controller
202468
http://indai.com/robot/
In the words of the Web site: “ARC is a simulator of
multiple mobile robots. It is used to test controllers
devised by the user in order to streamline the design
phase previous to their installation in real robots. This
simulation is, of course, only an approximation of a real
situation and in some cases a valid controller in simula-
tion will not be so in the real world.”

Robot Shapes, Styles, and Sizes
Amateur robots come in all sizes, from no larger than a
deck of cards, to well over the size of a refrigerator. Most
are on the smaller end of this scale, with robots weighing in
at 2 to 10 pounds.
Robots come in a variety of shapes. The shape is dictated
mainly by the internal components that make up the
machine and also by the intended application. Most ’bot
designs fall into one of the following categories:
• Turtle. Turtle robots are simple and compact, designed
primarily for “tabletop robotics.” Turtlebots get their name
because their body somewhat resembles the shell of a
turtle and also from early programming, with Logo turtle
graphics, which was adapted for robotics use in the
1970s.
• Miniature vehicle. These are small automatons with
wheels or tracks. In hobby robotics, they are often built
using odds and ends like used compact discs, extra
LEGO parts, or the chassis of a radio-controlled car.
LEGO robots fit this category.
• Rover. Any of a larger group of rolling or tracked robots
designed for applications that require some horsepower,
such as vacuuming the floor.
• Walker. A walking robot uses legs, not wheels or tracks, to move about. Most walker
’bots have six legs, like an insect, as the six legs provide excellent support and balance.
• Arms. Arm designs are used by themselves in stationary robots or can be attached to a
mobile robot.
• Android. Android robots are specifically modeled after the human form: a head, torso,
two legs, and possibly one or two arms.
What Happened to About.com Listings?
Knew you’d ask. You may know of About.com, a gigantic links site. About.com is divided
into many different categories, including hobbies, art, robots, artificial intelligence, and
other relevant sections, and is maintained by compensated “guides” who troll the Internet
looking for links and other resources.
About.com is not listed in this book, despite the number and usefulness of its resource
listings, because—quite simply—they are pop-up fiends. Visiting an About.com listing can
be sheer hell, with three and sometimes four pop-up windows appearing. After trying to
include some of their resources for this book, I decided I had had enough.
Feel free to investigate About.com on your own. But be prepared to close a lot of pop-
up windows as you go.

variation of the B-Bot idea developed by Marvin Green
and Cricket by Henry Arnold, modified to use a PIC
16C66 microcontroller and with a built-in software
package. It is part of an introductory robotics course
being developed for the Robotics Society of Southern
California.”

What to Name the New Robot
Can't think of what to call your next robot? Here are some common names other proud
parents have given their mechanical offspring.
Adam
Your first robot. Be coy and create a female companion robot
named Eve. Don't forget to eventually add a SnakeBot.
BugBot or RoBug
Robot bug.
Cybot
Apparently a combination of cybernetic and robot. Even some
companies have named their products this.
Fred or Sam
No clue why these are so popular.
Junior or Jr.
A microchip off the old bloke.
Kelad
Dalek (from Dr. Who) spelled backward.
Kirby or Hoover
Vacuum cleaner robot.
Max
For maximum; or for Maximillian, the antagonist robot in the
movie Black Hole.
Mobot
Mobile robot.
Mouse
And its variations: MicroMouse, MiniMouse, MickeyMouse,
MannyMouse.
Mowbot
Lawn-mowing robot.
MyBot
Not to be confused with YourBot.
Otto
Word play on automaton.
Robot
It worked for Will Robinson
Rover
It does everything but fetch.
Sparky
Hopefully, this is just a love name and isn't what happens when
you turn the power switch on.
Spike
Robotic dog; Tom's (from Tom & Jerry cartoons) nemesis.
Tobor
Robot spelled backward.

“Upgrade” a Tiger Electronics Furby. Definitely not
connected with Tiger in any way, but that shouldn’t
diminish the interest quotient.

Locating Chips and Other Electronic Parts
Though it's fun to surf the Internet into the wee hours of
the morning, sometimes you have other things to do and
want to find something quickly. If you're looking to pur-
chase integrated circuits and other electronic parts, a
great time-saver is FindChips.com, a free online
resource that is connected into the search engines of
more than a dozen electronics wholesalers, distributors,
and retailers.
Just enter the part number of the product you're
interested in, and FindChips.com will indicate which of
the resources carry the part. Then, descriptions, prices
(if available), and other pertinent data are displayed for
your review. You can go directly to any of the retailers to make your purchase if
you wish.
FindChips.com is located at:
http://www.findchips.com/
While the FindChips.com search engine is primarily intended to find products based on
part number, it will also locate many products by general description. For example, enter
"4.0 MHz resonator," and odds are it will find several matches.
FindChips.com allows you to
look for electronic parts and
compare availability and
pricing.

Searching for Patents 
The United States Patent and Trademark Office sponsors a free Web site where you can
search for, and browse, any patent going back to 1790. Older patents are shown as
graphical TIFF files (for which you need a special add-in for your browser; you can down-
load it from a link available at the USPTO site). Newer patents are in searchable text form.
The USPTO Web search page is at:
http://www.uspto.gov/patft/
Here, you can search for existing patents using the patent number, date of issuance, inventor
name, assignee name, and keyword. (You can also search through select patent applications.)
The Quick Search feature is the easiest to use. Here, you can specify up to two search
terms and indicate which field of the patent the term(s) relate to. For instance, if you're
looking for patents with "robot" in the title, specify robot as the search term, and Title as
the search field. Narrow the found patents by selecting a date range; the system defaults
to the most recent years. Patents that match are shown as a page of links.
Note: So-called design patents are prefixed with a D. These are fun to look at (you
need that TIFF graphics add-in as mentioned previously), as they are patents for the
physical appearance of a mechanism. Design patents are often taken out for toys and
movie robots and are done to prevent others from making copycat products. Regular (or
utility) patents are shown as a number, such as 1,234,567 (in case you're curious, this is a
patent from 1917 for a shirt collar).
Web searches for patents granted in other countries are also available, but not always
for free. Try the following—note that some require registration, and others are by sub-
scription only. While many are government sponsored, others are commercial enter-
prises, designed for patent attorneys, and subscription fees can be quite high. Most
pages are in the native language of the country, though some offer the choice of viewing
the site in English and other tongues.

How Stuff Works: An Inside Look at Stuff
Ever wonder how stuff works? You can keep up-to-date with the latest technologies at
Michael Brain's HowStuffWorks, the Internet version of the popular series of books.
http://www.howstuffworks.com/
From the home page, you can look up how all kinds of mechanical devices work. For
example, to learn more about how optical mice work, you might enter optical mouse or
How do optical mice work? at the main search box. (You don't have to pose searches as
questions, but the HowStuffWorks search engine will parse out and understand such
queries if you're more comfortable phrasing them that way.)
Matches are shown with short summaries; clicking on a link displays a short article that
explains the technology you're interested in—in this case, optical mice. Most of the arti-
cles on HowStuffWorks are semitechnical, but lacking are links to more complete infor-
mation at other sites. You'll need to rely on search engines like Google.com for that.

x Internet-Search
With the vastness of the Internet, search engines are
needed to help you find what you need. Otherwise,
you’d be slogging through millions of Web sites in
order to find the subjects that interest you.
Search engines work by cataloging Web pages and stor-
ing critical information about them in databases. With
many search engines, you find what you’re looking for
by entering a search phrase using keywords. A typical
keyword search might be as follows:
robotic vision systems
which (depending on the search engine you’re using)
will show you all the relevant pages having to do with
robot vision systems.
While there are many search engines available—and
most are free—a small handful are truly useful. Of all of
them, Google.com is my favorite, and it gets special
attention throughout this book. It’s fast, efficient, accu-
rate, and it doesn’t bombard you with ads. A number of
listings in this section pertain to subject searches you
can conduct using Google.com. The searches are
geared toward finding online and local suppliers of
goods and services.
As good as Google.com is, there are many other special-
purpose search engines, including electronic Yellow
Pages that allow you to look for retailers, both local and
long distance, based on subject of inquiry.

Buyer’s Index 
204093
http://www.buyersindex.com/
Buyer’s Index bills itself as “The Search Engine for
Savvy Shoppers.” It’s all that. Buyer’s Index provides
dozens of main categories, such as Tools & Instruments
and Toys & Games. 
Within these main categories are one or more subcate-
gories, which in turn list companies that sell associated
product. Listings include a short description and some-
times a quick recap of such things as the number of
items in the catalog, shipping policies, and important
restrictions. Not all listings have Web sites, but most
do.
internet-research
218

The search engine is particularly handy. You can indi-
cate features you want in the returned list: whether they
sell retail, wholesale, or both; whether they have a con-
ditional or unconditional return policy; and whether
they have a Web catalog or print catalog. Of course,
because online retailing and distribution changes rap-
idly, this information is not always up-to-date, but it’s a
good starting point. 
Useful (to robot building, that is) categories include: 
• Art & Craft Supplies & Equipment 
• Arts & Entertainment 
• Automotive 
• Bicycling 
• Books 
• Collectibles 
• Computer Components & Peripherals

Searching on the Internet
Both of these statements are true:
• The Internet is a huge sponge that soaks up time, money, and energy.
• The Internet will save you scores of time, money, and energy.
Which statement applies to you depends entirely on how you use the Internet. Careful
exploitation of its resources can be rewarding on many levels. With the Internet, you can find
most any piece of information, any part, any supplier, but knowing how to look is as important
as where to look. You can waste a lot of time “surfing” the Internet; there are better ways!
Google.com: Window into the Internet
The basic tool for finding things on the Internet is the search engine, a Web-based pro-
gram that collects data about other pages. Search engines catalog Web sites, assigning
“keywords” to them so you can locate what you want among the millions of pages avail-
able. Trouble is, most search engines on the Internet are dog-pooh. These days, they’ve
become nothing more than cheap advertising vehicles for companies with the largest
budget to spend, and the search results can be both misleading and unproductive.
Google.com is different—or at least it is as of this writing (things on the Internet have a
way of changing). In the hopes that Google.com keeps its act clean, throughout this book
we use it as the de facto standard search engine. Many of the information articles and
sidebars in this book contain references to Google.com “search phrases”—keywords that
are used to locate a myriad of associated Web pages. 
To use these search phrases, simply type them, exactly as they are printed, in the
Google.com search bar. Press the Enter key, and you’re off.
Though Google.com is advertising supported, the ads are seldom annoying or over-
whelming, nor are they inappropriate for those under 18 years of age. In nearly all cases,
the Google.com search engine has an uncanny ability to place the most relevant pages
near the top of the list. This alone saves you tremendous time.
Reaching Google.com
The U.S. North American Google.com site is http://www.google.com/. However, special-
ized versions of Google.com are provided for a number of languages and locations. Some
of the country-specific Google.com sites are as follows:
Belgium

Searching Wisely
Enter robotics into the Google.com search bar, and you’ll get over a million Web pages!
As you can imagine, robotics is a popular field of endeavor, but using a common search
phrase such as this will get you nowhere, fast. Fortunately, Google.com provides a num-
ber of ways to narrow your search, so that you have more chance of finding what you
want. Here are some tips.
Like most search engines, Google.com uses keywords to match your search phrase with
the content of a Web page. Keywords can be contained in the title, a special hidden key-
words section of the underlying HTML code that forms the Web page, or the text of the
page. How Google.com ranks the relevancy of the keywords it finds on pages is a closely
guarded secret, but through observation, it’s apparent the search engine favors keywords
that appear in the title of the page. Therefore, if a page says “ Robotics Stink,” it will likely be
ranked highly among pages on robots, simply because the phrase “robotics” is in the title.
Knowing this, you can more readily search for companies, products, or information, by
using search terms that are most likely to appear in the title of Web pages. Those Web
page creators that use non-descriptive titles, or leave them blank, will be ranked much
lower in the search results. That’s too bad for them.
You can tell Google.com to ignore keywords if they don’t appear in the title, thereby
limiting the search to only words that appear in the titles of pages. You do this with the
intitle modifier (or its close cousin, allintitle). Use
intitle:robotics
to find Web pages on which robotics appears only in the title. Note the colon after
intitle. Also note there is no space between the colon and the keyword.
Ignoring Nonrelevant Pages
Try the intitle:robotics search. You’ll find that at least some of the so-called hits on the first
couple of pages are not about mechanical robots, but about the U.S. Robotics brand of
modems, fax modems, and early PalmPilots. Unless you tell it otherwise, Google.com
doesn’t know the difference between robots that roll or walk on the floor and products
made by the old U.S. Robotics company.
There is a simple way to remove these kinds of nonrelevant pages: Use the minus (-)
character to tell Google.com to skip any Web page that contains a given keyword. Here’s
one way:
robotics –us
This fetches all Web pages with robotics, then omits all those pages with the keyword
us. This works, but unfortunately, us is a common word. The better way is to use quotes
to form a keyword phrase, like this:
robotics –”us robotics”
This time, only those pages that contain us robotics, as a complete phrase, are omitted.
Combining Keywords
It’s often handy to search for multiple keywords, such as robotics and vision. With few
exceptions, Google.com does not use Boolean searches—robotics AND vision, for exam-
ple—like some other search engines. Google’s syntax is a lot easier, yet isn’t limited.
+robotics +vision
Finds pages with both of the word forms
robotics vision
Same as above
“robotics vision”
Finds pages with the specific phrase robotics vision
Except for the whole phrase “robotics vision” the keywords in a multiple-keyword search
do not have to appear next to each other on the Web pages. That is, robotics can appear at
the beginning of a paragraph, and vision later in the paragraph. That said, Google.com
appears to give precedence to those pages where the keywords are found closer together.

internet-search 223
Note the + (plus) character in one of the examples. Google.com automatically ignores
very common words and does not include them in the results. Adding a + character to the
word ensures that Google.com considers it in your search. While both robotics and vision
are not common words and will not be ignored, it’s a good practice to include the + char-
acter whenever you want to ensure words are considered in the search.
When using the + character, be sure to add a space before it and to type the keyword
immediately following:
robot +about
Good
robot+about
Not good
robot + about
Not good  
No Wildcards, But . . . 
Google.com doesn’t support wildcards, special characters—like ? and *—that denote any
character or characters. However, the search engine allows you to construct phrases to
look for multiple forms of words by using the OR search modifier. 
+robotics eye OR eyes
Note OR in capitals. Google.com searches are not case sensitive, but you must capital-
ize OR in order to use it as a search modifier. This phrase looks for all pages with
robotics, then matches those pages with either eye or eyes.
Try Multiple Searches
Some searches will require a couple of different alternatives. One simple way of finding
pages when you want to look for multiple word forms—robotics or robot, for instance—is
to perform separate searches. For example:
robotics eye OR eyes
robot eye OR eyes
The first search looks for robotics with eye or eyes. The second, for robot with eye or eyes.
Additional Advanced Searches
Google.com supports an Advanced Search page where you can specify a number of
special qualifiers, including limiting the found pages to a given language or to those that
have been updated within a certain period of time. Similarly, you can also look for just
HTML Web pages, Adobe Acrobat PDF files, or many other common file types.
There are several handy Google.com search tricks you’ll want to know about. Be sure
to read the help pages on the Google.com site for more information.
Reversing the Order of Keywords
Google.com ranks the relevance of pages from the order of the keywords in your search
phrase. You get the same pages no matter what order you use, but the pages that appear
at the beginning of the list are altered by changing the keyword order. For example:
zebra barcode
Returns pages that favor the Zebra brand.
barcode zebra
Returns pages that favor bar coding in general, followed by
those that also contain the keyword Zebra.
More than Just Web Pages
The Google.com search engine is not limited to just Web pages. You can also find images
(not as useful to robot builders), Usenet newsgroups, and a subject directory. 
• The Groups search let you sift through years of archives of newsgroup messages. 
• The Directory search provides Web links to submitted and approved sites. Some of these
may be paid advertisements; nevertheless, it’s a good way of locating major suppliers.

At the time of this writing, Google.com was experimenting with a new feature called
Google Catalogs. This service provides scanned and indexed pages of hundreds of con-
sumer and business mail-order catalogs. If you don’t see a Catalogs search option on the
main Google.com home page, try the following URL:
http://catalogs.google.com/
En Français Anyone? Page Translations
Robotics isn’t limited to just those who speak English. You’ll find plenty of Web pages in a
variety of languages. Several free services offer text translation from and into the world’s
most common languages. The translations are not perfect, but they are often close
enough to allow you get the gist of what the Web page is all about.
Among the better Web page language translators are Google.com and Altavista.com;
my favorite is Google’s, so we’ll talk about that first. To translate a Web page, go here:
http://www.google.com/language_tools
and in the appropriate text box enter the full URL, including the http:// portion, of the
Web page you want to view. Select the “from” and “to” language choices, such as
Spanish to English, or French to German. The translation takes anywhere from a few sec-
onds to over a minute, depending on the length of the page.
Note that only normal text is translated. Text in a graphic image is not translated and is
shown in the original language.
AltaVista’s similar offering is available at:
http://babelfish.altavista.com/
It works in a similar fashion to Google.com’s translation page and offers additional lan-
guages such as Korean, Russian, and Chinese.

x Internet-Usenet 
Newsgroups
Usenet is the term used for the portion of the Internet
that provides for two-way non-real-time messaging. The
more common term is newsgroups, a bit of a misnomer
because most of the Usenet groups do not deal with
“news,” per se. The function of most groups is to share
ideas and to post and answer questions.

internet-usenet newsgroups 229
Newsgroups: Information Beyond the Web
Newsgroups were born in the days long before the Internet became a global market-
place. A newsgroup is a discussion group, a bulletin board, for posting and reading mes-
sages. Unlike chat, newsgroups are not real time; you don’t directly communicate with
others while everyone is online. Newsgroups, which are part of the Internet sometimes
referred to as Usenet, can be an excellent source of information and feedback.
As newsgroups are the result of the early Internet, their structure follows something of
a gearhead’s design of the world, and some aspects of it may be confusing and cryptic.
However, it’s not complicated once you learn your way around.
What’s a Newsgroup?
First and foremost is that newsgroups are divided into two main forms, public and private.
Public newsgroups are open to anyone, and most likely, your Internet service provider (ISP)
maintains computers just for the purpose of storing newsgroup messages. Your ISP’s com-
puters are connected to all the other public newsgroup computers around the globe, and
they constantly trade messages back and forth. The end result is that even though you may
“connect” to a newsgroup via your local ISP, you are reading the messages of others world-
wide; if you post a message of your own, within a few hours it will circulate around the globe.
Private newsgroups are set up by companies or organizations to support their products
or agenda. They may or may not be open to the public. In most cases, you must use the
newsreader portion of your Web browser to separately log into these private newsgroup
servers; they are not part of the public newsgroups provided by your ISP.
Newsgroup Hierarchy
Newsgroups follow a hierarchy, with some one dozen “top-level” categories to choose
from. The categories of primary interest to robot builders are highlighted in boldface type:
alt
Anything and everything
biz
Business products, services
comp
Computer and technical hardware, software
humanities
Fine art and literature, Philosophy 101
misc
What won’t fit anywhere else
news
Info about Usenet newsgroups
rec
Games, hobbies, personal interests, sports
sci
Applied science, social science
soc
Social issues, culture, politics, religion
talk
Current issues and debates 
Newsgroups are further divided into one or more additional sublevels, with each sub-
level separated from the top-level category name by a period. For example, the main
robotics discussion group for amateur and professional robotics is comp.robotics.misc;
the group is under the comp top-level and is further under the robotics sublevel. By the
way, there are few sublevels under robotics, so don’t expects lots of resources here. This
is just how it is for newsgroup subtopics.
Newsgroup Reading and Writing
To read (and optionally post) messages on a newsgroup you need to crank up a newsgroup
reader program, which is most often part of the browser you use for surfing the Web, or is
part of the operating system. I won’t get into exact steps here, as the procedures are docu-
mented in your software. Newsgroup readers are supported as part of Outlook Express if
you’re a Microsoft Internet Explorer user; Netscape has a newsgroup reader built-in.

Web rings are collections of Web sites—some commer-
cial and some not—that share a common theme or
interest. These days, most Web rings are hosted by
Yahoo! and similar outfits. Joining and participating are
free, but expect advertisements. The following listings
are for the hubs of the Web rings. The hub lists the
member sites belonging to the ring.

Manners and Etiquette in Newsgroups
Newsgroups can be a horrendous sink of time and energy. Take my advice: Avoid using
them as a soapbox, and avoid getting involved in heated discussions. People say things in
newsgroups that they’d never say in person, simply because folks are protected sitting
behind a computer screen. 
Here are some other tips:
• Unless you are an adult, don’t reveal your age. If you’re old enough to read this book,
you’re old enough to understand why.
• Sexual harassment is still a problem, particularly in public newsgroups where “joy rid-
ers” and “trolls” only stick around to cause trouble. So, if you’re female, I suggest you
use a male name for your login. Obviously, this isn’t a huge problem in groups fre-
quented mostly by women, but harassment is known to be a bigger issue in male-dom-
inated interest groups.
• If you include your e-mail address, use a “throw-away” e-mail account that you can
close should the spam (unsolicited commercial mail) get too abundant.
• If you read a message that angers you, don’t reply immediately. Flag it, and return to it
a day later. If you still want to reply, don’t add to any possible “flame war.” They con-
sume way too much time.

Kits
A great way to learn about something new is to build a
ready-made kit. You get all the parts you need and a
how-to construction plan to follow. The next sections
list resources for both electronics and robotics kits; the
two are separated for convenience, though in some
cases, a single resource may carry both.
Nearly all of the kits listed here are for hobbyist use and
are priced accordingly. You’ll want to select a kit based
on your skills. Most electronics kits require soldering,
so if you need to brush up on your soldering skills, start
with a simple low-cost kit. You can learn from it and
graduate to bigger and better things.

Ready-Made, Kits, or Do It Yourself?
Choice has never been greater for the robot builder. Not only can you construct robots
“from scratch,” you can buy any of several dozen robot kits. Many can be assembled
using a screwdriver and other common tools. Kits are ideal if you don’t like the construc-
tion aspects of robotics, but instead want to concentrate on the electronics or the pro-
gramming. You can also purchase ready-made robots.
Whether you choose to buy a robot in ready-made or kit form or to build your own from
the ground up, it’s important that you match your skills to the project. This is especially
true if you are just starting out. While you may want the challenge of a complex project, if
it’s beyond your present skills and knowledge level, you’ll likely become frustrated and
abandon robotics before you’ve given it a fair chance. If you want to build your own robot,
start with a simple design, and work up from there. 
OWIKITS and MOVITS
The OWIKITS and MOVITS robots are precision-made miniature robots in kit form. A vari-
ety of models are available, including manual (switch) and microprocessor-based. The
robots can be used as-is, or they can be modified for use with your own electronic sys-
tems. For example, the OWIKIT Robot Arm Trainer (model OWI007) is normally operated
by pressing switches on a wired control pad. With just a bit of work, you can connect the
wires from the arm to a computer interface (via relays, for example) and operate the arm
via software control.
Most of the OWIKITS and MOVITS robots come with preassembled circuit boards; you
are expected to assemble the mechanical parts. Some of the robots use extremely small
parts and require a keen eye and steady hand. The kits are well made and will last for
years if they are built properly. I have some OWIKITS robots I purchased almost 20 years
ago, and they are still in perfect working order.
OWIKITS ands MOVITS are made by EK JAPAN Co. (Elekit) in Japan; you can see the
company’s Web site (English and Japanese pages are available) at:
http://www.elekit.co.jp/
The products are available through dozens of distributors and resellers. A major U.S.
distributor is RobotKits Direct at:
http://robotikitsdirect.com/
Their Web site separates the robots by skill level and whether soldering is required.
Examples of interesting OWIKITS robots include:
• Navius—Controlled by a small paper disk, like a player piano. You can make your own
disk by filling in the black-and-white patterns.
• Hyper Line Tracker—Follows a black line and even remembers the last line it follows.
• WAO G—Programmable robot with a microcontroller and two feeler whiskers for
detecting objects and table drop-offs.
• Soccer Jr.—A basic beginner’s robot with wired control.

We implemented an example of such a behavior origi-
nally developed by Maris and te Boekhorst, called DID-
ABOTS. All robots in the group are the same and per-
form a very simple behavior: when they run into an
obstacle, they back up a bit, turn, and go forward again.”

Under the Hood of the Mindstorms RCX
The LEGO Mindstorms RCX is the central component of the
Mindstorms Robotics Invention System (RIS). The RCX is
termed a programmable brick; brick because it is modeled
after the brick-building system employed with the LEGO
system, and programmable because it contains its own
computer.
The RCX is more than a toy; it’s a plastic box containing a
small microcontroller, as well as interface electronics to
connect motors and sensors. At the heart of the RCX is an
H8/3292 microcontroller, running at 16 MHz. The H8, and
controllers like it, is like a miniature computer, but is
designed for “embedded applications” for hardware control. 
Two kinds of memory are used in the RCX: 16 KROM
(read-only memory), which stores the hardware BIOS (basic
input/output software) for the device, and 32 K of RAM
memory is used to store the operating system (called, erro-
neously, firmware) for the RCX, as well as up to five user
programs. The following figure shows the memory layout of
the RCX. Note that while the firmware and user programs
can be changed since they are stored in RAM, the hard-
ware BIOS cannot be altered.
A unique aspect of the RCX is that the firmware can be periodically updated. This allows
the LEGO Mindstorms programming system to be enhanced, without replacing the RCX
unit. Whenever LEGO releases updates for the RCX, you need merely to return to the
setup portion of the Mindstorms program and download the new version of the firmware.
Note that the data in RAM is retained by applying a small amount of battery power to
the RCX, even when it is turned off. This is why programs and firmware can be lost if the
RCX is stored for a length of time and the batteries run dead. 
Mindstorms Variations
There are variations to LEGO’s Mindstorms and similar product:
• Included in the LEGO Mindstorms Robot Discovery Set
(RDS) is the Scout, a programmable brick that supports
two motors and two sensors. The Scout can also be pro-
grammed via a computer with the addition of an infrared
programming tower (like the one that comes with the RIS).
• Several specialty construction sets, like the LEGO
Mindstorms Droid Developer’s Kit, come with the Micro
Scout. The Micro Scout contains its own motor, and its
basic programming is built-in. However, it can also be pro-
grammed through a system called VLL—for Visible Light
Link. The latest versions of the RCX can send signals to
the Micro Scout; one robot programs another robot!
• The RoboLab construction set comes with the similar programmable brick as the RCX
in the Mindstorms Robotics Invention System, but the package is sold with different
programming software. The RoboLab is intended for educational applications, and its
software is more suitable for classroom environments and science experiments.
• The CyberMaster is an earlier incarnation of the RCX, and while it shares many of the
same features, it is not as flexible. It was designed to be used in the classroom.

The LEGO Mindstorms (and its older brother, the

commanding your Mindstorms robot. LEGO offers a
free download of a software developer’s kit (SDK) that
describes a more robust programming environment,
one that permits far greater flexibility than the stan-
dard environments. 
Two SDKs are available: 
http://mindstorms.lego.com/sdk/  Covers RCX 1.x 
http://mindstorms.lego.com/sdk2/  Covers RCX 2.x 
The versions relate to the firmware that has been down-
loaded to the Mindstorms RCX (this firmware can be
replaced). There’s little reason for you to still be using
the first version of the firmware, so use the /sdk2 down-
load.

Mindstorms Alternative Programming Languages
Though the LEGO Mindstorms Robotics Invention System comes with a means to pro-
gram the RCX, you are not limited to it to take command of your LEGO robots. Among
the more common alternative programming languages and environments for the RCX are
the following:
• Not Quite C (NQC). This is perhaps the most popular replacement language for the
RCX. It uses C-like programming statements and is fairly robust. Versions are available
for the PC, Linux, and Macintosh. Some NQC fans prefer to add a graphical user inter-
face, and many of these are available. 
http://www.enteract.com/~dbaum/nqc/
• pbForth. Using a variant of the Forth language, pbForth is replacement firmware for the
RCX, rather than just a replacement programming language (NQC, above, uses the
standard RCX firmware). The system can be used with the PC, Macintosh, and Linux.
http://www.hempeldesigngroup.com/lego/pbForth/
• legOS. Perhaps the most difficult to use, but one of the most robust replacement pro-
gramming packages is legOS. Like pbForth, legOS is a new firmware, and therefore
works around some of the limitations (real and perceived) in the stock RCX firmware.
legOS is supported under Linux and Windows, and to use it effectively, you need C pro-
gramming experience.
http://www.noga.de/legOS/
• Java. Never to be left out, there are several Java implementations of RCX programming
alternatives. Among them is leJOS (pronounced Ley-J-oss) and TinyVM. Most Java
implementations work under Linux and Windows.

 Machine Framing
The person who thought up the concept for machine
framing must have played with Play-Doh as a kid: Put
some Play-Doh clay into a little machine, push down on
the lever, and out comes various shapes. Change the
orifice on the machine and out comes different shapes.
Now imagine, instead of clay, you do the same thing
with liquid aluminum. When the aluminum cools, it
creates what’s known as an extrusion; the profile of the
extrusion matches the orifice that the hot, molten
metal was pushed through.
Now assume the orifice is shaped so that the aluminum
extrusion has four or more sides, and each side has a
“T-slot” in it. Within this T-slot can be placed a variety of
attachments, and they tighten against the groove of the
T-slot to make a secure connection.
Such is machine framing, where aluminum rod is
extruded into various shapes for the express purpose of
creating “construction set frames” for building machin-
ery. With the appropriate connectors and accessories,
it’s possible to assemble a frame with aluminum profile
extrusions that has few, if any, nuts and bolts.
Everything is held together with connectors that cinch
against the T-slots.
Whether or not the inventor of machine framing
began his or her career with Play-Doh, you can use
these pieces of aluminum to create strong and light-
weight frames for larger robots. With the proper con-
nectors, your robot frames can be reconfigurable.
There are swivel joints, for example, that allow you to
change the shape of the frame by loosening a set screw,
moving the joint to a new position, and retightening
the screw.
A few sources will sell a few pieces at a time, but most
expect a big order and prefer working with industrial
clients and factories. Check minimum-order require-
ments, and note special shipping charges. Unless the
seller will cut the pieces for you, there may be extra
freight charges because the extrusions normally come
in 8-foot (or longer) lengths.

Aluminum extrusions are
commonly used with T-nuts to
build versatile machine frames.
Machine-Framing Alternatives
If machine framing is too rich for your blood, but you like the idea of assembling framing
using tubing and connectors, consider retail display fixture hardware designed for retail
stores. Available in plastic, aluminum, or steel, this round or square material can be cut to
length, then joined using various connectors.
One common style is 1 1/2-inch PVC tubing, available in white, gray, black, and other
colors. The tubing connects with various shapes of corner connectors. For example:
• A two-way L joins two pieces of pipe at a right angle.
• A three-way T joins three pieces of pipe: two pipes connected end to end and a third
as a riser.
• A four-way T joins four pieces of pipe in an intersection arrangement.
. . . and so on. The pipe is made to fit snugly into the connectors. PVC is easy to cut
and drill, so you can readily attach other components to the frame. One popular retail
store fixture system is Kee Klamp, made by Kee Industrial Products.
Yet another idea is to using so-called furniture-grade PVC
pipe for small robot frames. This pipe, available in sizes
ranging from 3/4 to 2 inches, is intended to make outdoor
furniture using PVC pipe and fittings. It is furniture grade
because the pipe has been treated with an ultraviolet-
resistant chemical (ordinary PVC becomes brittle in time
from exposure to ultraviolet). 
As with retail store fixture materials, you can cut the pipe
to length and assemble it using various connectors. Use
PVC solvent cement to prevent the pipe from working loose
(or you can use self-tapping screws if you want to be able
to disassemble the frame in the future). Cut holes in the
pipe to mount other components.
Use PVC pipe and fittings to
make lightweight robot frames.

Machine Framing: Erector Sets for Big Boys and Girls
Ever watch a scaffold being erected at a building site? With nothing more than some pipe
and connectors, the scaffold can be built to most any shape and any size—within the lim-
its of physics, of course. The scaffold is a kind of large-scale construction toy, not unlike
the basic concept of the Erector set, LEGO, Construx, K’NEX, and a long line of similar
toys. The difference is simply one of scale.
Imagine something in-between toy construction sets and scaffolding. That’s the idea
behind machine framing. The system employs lengths of plastic or aluminum rod, con-
nected together with various elbows, tees, and hinges. Rather than a simple rounded rod,
the material is extruded into unique profiles: hexagonal or square shapes, with flanges
and ribs that make it easy to secure other components.
With machine framing you can more quickly design the body and other structures of
your robots. The framing pieces are cut to length with a hacksaw, then assembled with
connectors and other hardware. The typical machine-framing construction does not
require drilling, taping, or welding, and this is the main attraction of the system. Everything
can be fastened tightly together using the supplied connectors and hardware.
Aluminum Leads the Parade
The most common form of machine framing is made with
aluminum and goes by the more mundane descriptor of alu-
minum profile extrusions. Several manufacturers offer alu-
minum extrusions, each one with slightly different shapes
and connector types (so they aren’t always compatible with
one another).
Framing profiles comes in a variety of sizes and usually in
two “classes”: fractional and metric. The choice depends on
what measurement system you’re most comfortable work-
ing in. We’ll assume fractional for our discussion, but note
that similar products are available in equivalent metric sizes
as well.
Machine-framing components are first measured by their cross-section dimensions,
such as 1 by 1 inch, or 1 1/2 by 2 inch. For most robots, the smaller material is sufficient,
and it’s less expensive all around. Sizes of up to 3 by 6 inches are available, when maxi-
mum structural strength is required.
Literally hundreds of profiles (extrusion shapes) are available, with the “T-slot” the most
common. In this profile, a T-shaped slot is extruded on all four sides of a square tube.
With the proper hardware, other components can be fastened anywhere along the length
of the slot. Components can be moved to another position along the length simply by
loosening their fastener, sliding it up or down, and retightening. No drilling! No welding!
Frames are constructed using connectors, fasteners, or hinges. Depending on the sys-
tem, a square frame can be made using four lengths of profile extrusion and four L-
shaped connectors. Hinges offer added flexibility by allowing you to set the angle of the
joined pieces. The hinges can be tightened to stay in place.
Now, How About Cost?
While machine framing offers a fast and efficient way to build the frames and other
mechanical systems of medium and large robots, the cost is not cheap. Most extrusions
are sold by the foot or the inch. A 6-foot length of 1 by 1 inch T-slot costs on average
about $15 to $20. A similar length of extruded aluminum channel stock, available at the

home improvement store, is barely half that amount; of
course, to use it you must drill mounting holes as needed.
Costs can be controlled by carefully selecting the pieces
you need, in the exact lengths you need, so there is no
waste. A foot of wasted extrusion can cost several dollars,
so it’s wise to make your investment stretch as far as it can.
Somewhat less expensive is plastic extrusion. This mate-
rial is not as strong as aluminum extrusion, and supplemen-
tary hardware is not as extensive. However, it costs consid-
erably less. Like aluminum extrusions, the common style in
plastic is the T-slot, either with a square shape or an octa-
gon (eight-sided) profile.
Plastic extrusions are cheaper,
but not quite as strong.

Most manufacturers won’t sell directly to the public.
But they are nevertheless good resources for product
information, datasheets, and application notes. 
Plus, a growing number of manufacturers are selling
refurbished gear and replacement parts directly from
their Web sites. Example replacement parts include
motors, gearboxes, and batteries for cordless drills and
screwdrivers, or wheels and drive shafts for power gar-
den equipment. Scan the company’s parts catalog and
you’re sure to find items that can be used on a robot.
G Manufacturer-

Manufacturers listed here produce electronic parts that
aren’t classified as semiconductors. Most of what you’ll
find here are used in robotics for sensors, such as linear
and rotary potentiometers for position sensors and
LED and infrared components for proximity sensors.
Also included here are manufacturers of connectors,
wiring harnesses, relays, switches, and other electronics
hardware.
Most of the manufacturers in this section do not sell
directly to individuals, but a few will sell in small quanti-
ties via phone orders or the Internet.

There are actually hundreds of makers of various glues,

The obvious use for glues and adhesives (and their

Manufacturer-
Semiconductors
Semiconductors include integrated circuits, transistors
(signal and power), diodes, and related circuitry. The
semiconductor manufacturers listed here run the
gamut from large multi-billion-dollar companies with
fabrication factories around the world to small specialty
designers that “send out” their ICs, transistors, and
other parts to be built by someone else. 
As it turns out, the smaller outfits often have the most
interesting specialty products. Look especially for
motor controllers, power drivers, switching regulators,
DC-DC converters, analog-to-digital converters, solid-
state accelerometers and tilt sensors, optical sensors,
LCD drivers, and microcontrollers.
Most companies listed in this section do not sell directly
to individuals. The main benefit of the manufacturers
listed here is the product datasheets and application
notes you can obtain from them. These are routinely
published as PDFs, which require the free Adobe
Acrobat 
Reader 
program 
to 
view 
(see
http://www.adobe.com/ for downloading details).
Note that a number of semiconductor makers are
only too happy to send out free samples. When sam-
ples are available, they are typically for current prod-
uct only (no legacy products kept in stock for perpe-
tuity), and package styles are limited—for instance,
ICs only in surface mount and not in DIP packages.
Check the companys’ Web sites for their samples
policies.

Some of Agilent’s product lines include: 
• Fiber optics 
• Infrared and bar code 
• LED 
• Motion control 
• Optical navigation 
• Optocoupler 
Among key products for robotics include optical mouse
ICs and sensors for optical navigation. One particularly
useful chip is the ADNS-2051 optical mouse sensor.
This chip works by taking thousands of digital pictures
each second. It has a resolution of up to 800 counts per
inch (CPI) and can track motion of up to 14 inches per
second. One possible application is robot odometry
over nonfibrous (i.e., not carpeted) surfaces. Specifics
regarding this chip can be found at: 
http://www.agilent.com/view/opticalnavigation/ 
Note the staggered DIP package design; this is not your
standard IC, and it requires special prototyping boards
or custom circuit boards. 
In addition, Agilent offers a number of low- and
medium-cost optical linear and rotary encoders for
motion control. To round out the line, the company
provides various versions of quadrature encoder inter-
face and counter ICs, including several that are in a DIP
(dual-inline pin) IC package, making them easy to

Where to Get Stuff: Freebies
Shhhh! I’m not supposed to tell you this, but a number of electronics component makers
will send you free samples, just for the asking. While it helps if you’re an instructor at a
school, or an engineer working for a company building millions of units of some gizmo,
the truth is, most semiconductor and electronics manufacturers will send free samples to
most anyone. Just don’t be greedy, and observe limits to their kindness (most companies
will send a “handful” of parts—usually under two each, or a total of 10 per request).
Availability of freebies is especially useful, as the newest semiconductors may not be
carried by distributors and wholesalers, making it hard to purchase these products. You
can get a jump ahead by asking for free samples and incorporating them in your work.
Sample kits are also sometimes available from wholesalers, distributors, and resellers.
Look for kits of parts, fasteners, or various types of hardware. The kits are limited and are
obviously meant to entice you into buying more, but they’re free, and you never know
when some piece from a kit will come in handy.

Manufacturer-Tools
The single greatest thing that separates us humans
from animals is not that we enjoy seeing robots tear
each other’s guts out, but that we use tools to help us do
our work. Tools make other tools, so the only limits on
the tools we use are their size and practicality. In this
section are listed manufacturers of a broad array of
tools used in robotics construction. This category spans
from soldering irons to woodworking saws to computer-
controlled mills.
Very few of the companies listed here will sell directly to
individuals; they prefer instead that you buy your tools
from retailers. That’s okay, because many manufacturer

Tools of the Trade: Soldering Iron
A soldering iron is a requirement for any robot building that requires you to construct or
repair electronic circuits or wiring. 
• For maximum flexibility, invest in a modular soldering pencil. This style of soldering iron
lets you change the heating element. A 25- or 30-watt heating element is preferred. 
• Stay away from “instant-on” soldering irons. They put out far to much heat for most any
application other than soldering large-gauge wires.
• Always use a soldering stand to keep the soldering pencil in a safe, upright position. 
• Get one or two small soldering tips for intricate printed circuit board work, but invest in
a single medium- or large-size tip for routine soldering chores.
• You need solder to feed the soldering iron. And not just any kind of solder, but the rosin or
flux core type. Acid core and silver solder should never be used on electronic components.
• A sponge is used to clean the soldering tip during use. Keep the sponge damp and
wipe the tip clean every few joints. An ordinary kitchen sponge is fine, but don’t use the
kind that contains soap.
Extra soldering tools you may want to add to your shop:
• Heat sink, for attaching to sensitive electronic components during soldering. The heat
sink draws the excess heat away from the component and helps prevent damage to it.
• Desoldering vacuum tool, to soak up molten solder. Used to get rid of excess solder, to
remove components, or redo a wiring job.
• Dental picks, for scraping, cutting, forming, and gouging into the work. 
• Rosin cleaner (spray or brush-on). Apply the cleaner after soldering is complete to
remove excess resin. 
• Solder vise or “third hand.” The vise holds together pieces to be soldered, leaving you
free to work the iron and feed the solder.

 Materials
Listings in this section are general sources for a wide
range of mechanical materials useful in robot construc-
tion. Many of the companies could best be described as
“materials superstores,” general stores that offer every-
thing from pieces of metal and plastic to power trans-
mission items (gears, sprockets, roller chain, bearings,
etc.), construction tools, motors, glues and adhesives,
specialty tapes, fasteners, and much more.
The catalogs of many general materials outlets are
huge, with some spanning several thousand pages.
Personally, I prefer the printed catalogs for reference,
but tend to do my actual buying online; those that sell
online provide searchable databases of components,
making it easier to find things when you’re in a hurry.

Material for Robot Bodies
Robots can be easily constructed from aluminum, steel, tin, wood, plastic, paper, foam, or
a combination of them all. Here are some common materials used in constructing robot
bases and other components.
• Plastic. Pound for pound, plastic has more strength than many metals, yet is easier to
work with. You can cut it, shape it, drill it, even glue it. Effective use of plastic requires
some special tools, and availability of extruded pieces might be somewhat scarce
unless you live near a well-stocked plastic specialty store. Use mail order instead. 
• Foam board. Art supply stores stock what’s know as foam board, also called “Foam
Core.” Foam board is a sandwich of paper or plastic glued to both sides of a layer of
densely compressed foam. The material comes in sizes from 1/8 inch to over 1/2 inch,
with 1/4 to 1/3 inch being fairly common. The board can be readily cut with a small
hobby saw (paper-laminated foam board can be cut with a sharp knife; plastic-lami-
nated foam board should be cut with a saw). Foam board is especially well suited for
small robots for which lightweightedness is of extreme importance.
• Rigid expanded plastic sheet. Expanded sheet plastics are often constructed like a
sandwich, with thin outer sheets on the top and bottom, and a thicker expanded (air-
filled) center section. When cut, the expanded center section often has a kind of foam-
like appearance, but the plastic itself is stiff. Rigid expanded plastic sheets are remark-
ably lightweight for their thickness, making them ideally suited for small robots.
• Aluminum. Aluminum is a great robot-building material for medium and large machines
because it is exceptionally strong for its weight. Aluminum is easy to cut and bend
using ordinary shop tools. It is commonly available in long lengths of various shapes,
but it is somewhat expensive.
• Steel. Although sometimes used in the structural frame of a robot because of its
strength, steel is difficult to cut and shape without special tools. Stainless steel is some-
times used for precision components, like arms and hands, and also for parts that
require more strength than a lightweight metal (such as aluminum) can provide.
Expensive.
• Tin, iron, and brass. Tin and iron are common hardware metals, often used to make
angle brackets, sheet metal (various thickness from 1/32 inch on up), and (when galva-
nized) nail plates for house framing. Brass is often found in decorative trim for home
construction projects and as raw construction material for hobby models. All three met-
als are stronger and heavier than aluminum. Cost is fairly cheap.
• Wood. Wood is easy to work with, can be sanded and sawed to any shape, doesn’t
conduct electricity (avoids short circuits), and is available everywhere. Disadvantage:
Ordinary construction plywood is not recommended; use the more dense (and expen-
sive) multi-ply hardwoods for model airplane and sailboat construction. Common thick-
nesses are 1/4 to 1/2 inch—perfect for most robot projects.

their emphasis is on industrial controls and systems,
they offer plenty of tools, supplies, PVC, plastics, cou-
plers, hardware, fasteners, and more. 
In addition to online and catalog sales, Graybar oper-
ates nearly 300 offices and distribution facilities in
Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Singapore, and the U.S.

Robotic Skeletal Structures 
In nature, and in robotics, there are two general types of support frames: endoskeletons
and exoskeletons. Neither is inherently better; it all depends on the function of the robot
and the ways in which you want to use it.
• Endoskeleton support frames are the kind found in many critters—including humans,
mammals, reptiles, and most fish. The skeletal structure is on the inside; the organs,
muscles, body tissues, and skin are on the outside of the bones. The endoskeleton is a
characteristic of vertebrates.
• Exoskeleton support frames are the “bones” on the outside of the organs and muscles.
Common exoskeletal creatures are spiders, all shellfish such as lobsters and crabs,
and an endless variety of insects.

Carbon Composites
Check here for sources of lightweight fiberglass and
carbon-composite materials. Carbon composites are
routinely sold in rod, tube, and sheet form and are
among the strongest yet lightest materials commonly
available. The same material is used in some fishing
poles and tent poles, and hence providers of these
items are also good sources for carbon composites.
While not as light, fiberglass is amazingly strong and
can be used for both the structural and body compo-
nents of your robot. Fiberglass can be molded and
shaped and in raw form is composed of a fiberglass mat-
ting cloth and a two-part resin. The resin chemicals are
mixed, and the matting cloth is immersed in this liquid.
The resin cures after several hours of exposure to air.

MRO Stands for . . . ?
You may see the acronym MRO used by online retailers and Web sites. MRO stands for
“maintenance, repair, and operating,” and it represents the parts and supplies involved in
both factory upkeep as well as its day-to-day operation. 
Some MRO materials are useful for robot building. For example, MRO suppliers often
carry heavy-duty wheels and casters, replacement DC motors, metal stock and other raw
materials, bearings, drive chain, and similar products. Much of it is aimed at industrial
applications, so the materials will tend to be for heavy-duty jobs.

Carbon rods and tubes, carbon fiber fittings, and other
lightweight materials. Air Dynamics also offers a num-
ber of unusual materials for ultralightweight model avi-
ation (including blimps). 
Notable additional products carried by Air Dynamics
include: 
• JiffyPins-gold-plated male and female connectors
that can handle currents up to 20 amps. 
• CS (Clearly Superior) Heat-Shrink-Thin, light-
weight, and clear heat shrink for larger items; 45%
shrinkage. 
• 3M Blenderm adhesive bandage tape-1/2- or 1-inch-
wide tape that sticks to most any surface, but does
not leave a residue. 
• Tesa transfer adhesive tape-Sticky stuff that’s on a
tape roll, but there’s no tape. 
• HiViz tape-Metallic foil diffraction grating tape.

Materials-fiberglass & carbon composites 291
He Ain’t Heavy; He’s My Robot!
Batteries, motors, and frame contribute the most to a robot’s weight. It’s hard to control
the weight of the first two, especially for robots built on a budget, where your choices are
limited to what you have on hand or what is inexpensively available. Your choice of frame
material for your robot, however, can greatly influence its final tally on the scales. 
The frame of the robot can add a surprising amount of weight. An 18-inch-square, 2-
foot-high robot constructed from extruded aluminum and plastic panels might weigh in
excess of 20 or 30 pounds, even before you add motors and batteries. The same robot in
wood (of sufficient strength and quality) could weigh even more. 
There are ways to lighten your robot without sacrificing strength. This is done by select-
ing a different construction material and/or using different construction techniques.
Instead of building the base of your robot using solid aluminum sheet, consider an alu-
minum frame, with crossbar members for added stability. Use thin plastic sheets as “skin”
over the frame. The plastic is strong enough for mounting circuit boards, sensors, and
other lightweight components.
Ordinary acrylic plastic is rather dense, and therefore fairly heavy, considering its size.
Lighter-weight plastics are available, but aren’t as easy to find—unless you know where to
look. Foamed PVC sheets weigh less than half as much as an acrylic sheet of the same
size, yet is about as strong. Foamed PVC goes under the trade names of Sintra,
Komatex, Komacel, and others. It’s available at most plastics specialty retailers, as well
as sign-makers’ shops. 
Robots that require multiple decks—layers of components stacked up over the base—
can be lightened using foamed PVC for the decking material and Class 125 for the “risers.”
Avoid the use of Schedule 40 or Schedule 80 water pipe, as these are thicker, and there-
fore heavier. You can attach the decks together using 6/32 all-thread, placing the PVC pipe
over the all-thread. You need only a washer and a nut to keep the all-thread tight.
For the lightest robots possible, use fiberglass or carbon composites. Hollow fiberglass
and carbon-composite tubes are very lightweight, yet are extremely strong. Both can
withstand considerable flexing before breakage (many carbon composites will not break
unless under very high tension). While cost for fiberglass and carbon composites is higher
than for most other materials, the extra can be offset by the ability to use smaller and less
expensive batteries and motors.

 Materials-Foam
Who’d a thunk you could make robots out of foam?
Well, to be truthful, not the kind of foam used to make
beds or pillows, but heavier cellular foams commonly
used for such tasks as sign making, floor underlayment,
even wall insulation. Some foams are stiff and need no
additional reinforcement, but others are best suited for
lamination with a rigid material. Combine a hunk of
foam, using contact cement, with a thin rigid piece of
plastic or metal, and you make yourself a very strong-yet
lightweight-substrate for a robot body or shell.
One side benefit of foams is that they are carvable,
using either a regular knife, hot knife, or saw (in a
pinch, you can also use an electric carving knife).

Blue Foam, Pink Foam
Blue foam is the common term for a family of expanded polystyrene foams that are sold
at building supply stores. Builders use the stuff for exterior insulation. It’s more rigid than
fiberglass insulation and has a higher R factor (R factor is the rating they give to insulative
materials; the higher the factor, the more insulation the material provides). 
Blue foam is from 1 to 3 inches thick, though specialty versions, such as floor sound-
deadening foam, are available in thinner sheets. This latter material can be found at floor-
ing stores.
Blue foam is useful as a substrate or “rigidizer” for your robot. It weighs very little for its
size and bulk, yet offers remarkable rigidity. It’s best used when physically cemented to a
carrier, such as 1/8-inch (or even thinner) plywood or plastic. The two materials together
provide a strong yet lightweight building platform for your robot. Being foam, it’s easy to
saw or drill, but it does break off into pieces the way Styrofoam and similar materials do.
Though called “blue foam,” its color may be either blue or pink. The foam is available in
different densities, with many of the pink variety foams having the lowest densities. You
may find the heavier blue foams easier to work with because they’re not as floppy.

Sign Makers for Substrates
Sign makers use “substrates” as something to print on. There are many types of sub-
strates for signage, including wood, plastic, metal, foam, and glass. Sign maker suppliers
sell these substrates in convenient sizes and in many colors. Many of the substrates can
be used to fashion all kinds of robot parts, including bases, frames, and bodies.
Here’s a sampling of sign-making substrates that can also be used in robots. 
• MDO plywood—MDO stands for “medium-density overlay,” a lighter-weight plywood
than stuff at the lumber yard, yet still very strong
• Foam board—Foam laminated with plastic, wood, or metal
• Alumalite—Aluminum over corrugated plastic; thicknesses from 1/8 inch; very strong
stuff!
• Clad-tex aluminum sign blanks—Variations on an aluminum theme, with plastic, vinyl,
and other coatings over aluminum sheet
• Celtec PVC board—Expanded (foamed) PVC; this is the basic stuff you shouldn’t do
without (other brands include Sintra, Komacel, and Komatex)
• Coroplast—Inexpensive foam board laminate
• Corrugated plastic—Goes by trade names like Gatorboard, Gatorplast, and other
Gators, looks like the liner in cardboard but is made of plastic
• DiBond—Sheet metal over expanded (foamed) PVC; economical alternative to Alumalite
• Econolite—Like Alumalite, but with aluminum on one side only 
• Fiber-Brite substrates—Fiberglass panels; very light but very strong
• PolyCarve substrates—Extruded polyethylene that can be carved into 3D shapes
• Reflective tapes—Metal or glass tapes that reflect lots of light
• Holographic tapes and films—Add rainbow colors and designs with various patterns
• LusterBoard—Aluminum on the outside, lightweight wood on the inside; 1/4- and 1/2-
inch widths common
Note that prices tend to be very competitive, because sign makers get paid by the job,
and they want to reduce their materials costs as much as possible. On the other hand,
online retailers of sign-making supplies may require a minimum order of $25 or $50, and
some will not cut material to more convenient sizes (typical sign substrate sheets are 4
by 8 feet). Not only do you get a big sheet of material to contend with, it must be shipped
via motor freight and not UPS. Because of added expenses of trucking, look for sign
maker suppliers that sell cut pieces.

Stuff for when you bag that ol’ robot. McKenzie sells
taxidermy supplies, of which things like eyes, casting
materials, and carvable foam are useful to the robot
constructionist.

Electroluminescent Wire
Imagine a flexible neon sign. That’s what electroluminescent
(EL) wire is. EL wire looks a lot like small plastic tubing, but
when electricity is applied to it, it glows in a rainbow of col-
ors. How does it work? At the center is a solid copper con-
ductor. This conductor is coated with an electroluminescent
phosphor. To excite the phosphor, two very fine wires are
wrapped around the center conductor. Over this whole
arrangement is a clear plastic sheath, which also protects
everything inside.
Apply current to the wires, and the phosphor lights up.
Colors are produced by varying the chemical makeup of the
phosphor and also by altering the tinting of the plastic pro-
tective sheath, varying the voltage, and/or varying the frequency of the current driving the
wire. The end result is a brightly colored glowing wire.
EL wire has several uses in robotics. Here are just some of them:
• First and foremost, it looks cool! Wrap some EL wire of different colors around the
periphery of your robot to give it some pizzazz.
• Small strips of EL wire, of a certain color, can be used to identify robots in a competi-
tion. If the robots are equipped with filtered light sensors, they can even differentiate
friend from foe on the battlefield.
• EL wire can provide illumination for the robot for use in object detection. When used in
conjunction with cadmium sulfide (CdS) cells, the reflected glow of the EL wire can be
detected and used for proximity sensing. (In addition, many red-colored phosphors will
emit a certain amount of near-infrared light, which is detectable with ordinary infrared
phototransistors.)
• A strip of EL wire on the floor can be used for a line-tracking robot. On the underside of
the robot, affix sensors to detect the glow of the wire.
• Strips of EL wire can be placed around the periphery of a room or along the floor to
serve as a kind of electronic fence. Sensors on the underside of the robot detect the
light from the EL wire. A bonus: Unlike a painted line, the EL wire can be switched on
and off, thereby allowing the robot to exit the fenced area, should that be necessary.
Powering EL Wire
EL wire is driven by a high-voltage alternating current (AC). But it need not be plugged
into a wall outlet. Rather, the wire uses small self-contained inverters that produce the
required voltage from a small DC source (usually 3 to 12 volts; AA batteries are sufficient).
Inverters are rated by their output capacity, which in turn determines the length of EL
wire that can be driven. Small inverters can drive from 3 to 6 feet of EL wire; higher-
capacity units drive 20 to 30 feet (and more) of wire. Models designed for commercial
lighting can drive several hundred feet.
Inverters are not terribly expensive—consumer models retail for $7 to $12. You’ll have
good results if you add more inverters to drive additional strands of EL wire rather than try
to do it all from one unit. Additionally, you can opt for an inverter that blinks the EL wire at
specific intervals or keeps it on continuously. Specialty inverters are available with built-in
sequencers that selectively activate several strands of EL wire in turn.
Note that inverters are available at different operating frequencies—from 400 Hz to
over 12,000 Hz. The brightest outputs are provided at the higher frequencies. The color of
some of phosphors can be altered by changing the frequency of the AC power signal. For
Electroluminescent is flexible
“glow wire” that has both
functional and decorative uses
in robotics.

example, the “blue” phosphors can be changed from green to blue by varying the fre-
quency between 400 and about 6,000 Hz. Changing the input voltage of the inverter,
which in turn changes the output voltage, also alters the color of some EL wire.
Available Colors
Color choice varies by manufacturer, but most offer the following, in diameters from
1.3mm (called “angle hair”) to 5.0mm:
• Aqua (blue/green)
• Deep red
• Green
• Indigo (deep blue)
• Lime green
• Orange
• Pink
• Purple
• Red
• White
• Yellow
The blues and greens tend to be the most vibrant colors.
One caveat when working with EL wire: Exposed (cut) ends of the wire can let in mois-
ture, which can ruin the phosphor coating. To prevent this, always apply heat-shrink tub-
ing over the ends of the wire. Attach the heat-shrink tubing so that it forms a closed seal.

 Materials-Metal
Some lament the end of “Detroit Iron,” the days when
American car manufacturers used tons of tin and
chrome for the bulbous cars of the 1940s and 1950s.
Don’t let the same thing happen to robots! For a heavy-
duty robot, you need to consider metal, if not for the
frame or other structural components, then for the
body. Most of the winning combat robots are made of
aluminum or steel (some even stainless steel) and
could dent a ‘55 Ford if the two ran into one another.
Now that’s a robot!
Seriously, in this section are sources for and about met-
als suitable for use in robotics. Several online metal
retailers are included, as well as some local establish-
ments that have Web sites you can look at. Buying metal
through the mail can be expensive if you’re purchasing
large pieces of steel, as shipping costs mount.
Therefore, depending on the material you are purchas-
ing, you may wish to look for a local resource before
turning to mail order.
On the other hand, lightweight aluminum and brass
are readily shippable, especially if you purchase them in
the sizes closest to your end application. That also limits
waste and helps reduce cutting metal to sizes.

8 Tips for Working with Metal
With the right tools, working with metal is only slightly harder than working with wood or
plastic. Here are some tips to streamline your metalworking.
1. Always use sharp, well-made drill bits, saws, and files. Dull, bargain-basement tools
aren’t worth the trouble. 
2. If you’re using a power drill or power saw, use the slower speed settings. High speed
settings are for wood; slow for metal.
3. For sawing metal, select a fine-tooth blade, on the order of 24 or 32 teeth per inch.
Coping saws, keyhole saws, and other handsaws are generally engineered for wood
cutting, and their blades aren’t fine enough for metalwork.
4. When cutting rod, bar, and channel stock by hand, use a miter box. The hardened
plastic and metal boxes are the best buys. Be sure to get a miter box that lets you cut
at 45 degrees both vertically and horizontally.
5. Use a punch to ensure accurate drilling. When cutting metal, the bit will skate over the
surface until the hole is started. The punch creates a small “dimple” in the metal that
reduces skating. 
6. Whenever possible, use a drill press to cut metal pieces.
7. Always use a proper vise when working with a drill press. Never hold the work with
your hands, or serious injury could result. If you can’t place the work in the vise, use a
pair of Vice Grip pliers or other suitable locking pliers.
8. Cutting and drilling leaves rough edges (called burrs and flashing) in the metal. These
must be filed down using a medium- or fine-pitch metal file.

Show your patriotism and put a flag on your robot! Or,
snoop around American FlagStore.com for such things
as fiberglass poles, lightweight aluminum poles, and
brass and aluminum metal balls-the balls sit atop the
flagpole and can be used to build all sorts of unusual
robot shapes. Their flagpole balls come in sizes from 3
to 12 inches.

Metal Stock at the Corner Hardware Store
Have a hankering to construct the next Terminator robot? You’ll need about $300,000 in
titanium to do it. A better idea: Make another robot and settle for commonly available
metal stock, such as aluminum plate, channel, and rod. Your local hardware or home
improvement store is the best place to begin. Here’s what you’ll find at the better-
stocked stores.
Extruded Aluminum and Steel
Extruded metal stock is made by pushing molten metal out of a
shaped orifice. Extruded aluminum and steel come in 2-, 3-, 4-, 6-,
or 8-foot sections; some stores will let you buy cut pieces. Aluminum
is lighter and easier to work with, but steel is stronger. Use steel
when you need the strength; but otherwise, opt for aluminum.
Extruded aluminum and steel is available in more than two
dozen common styles, from thin bars to pipes to square posts.
Although you can use any of it as you see fit, a couple of standard
sizes may prove to be particularly beneficial in your robot-building
endeavors.
• 1 by 1 by 1/16-inch angle 
• 57/64 by 9/16 by 1/16-inch channel
• 41/64 by 1/2 by 1/16-inch channel 
• Bar stock, widths from 1 to 3 inches; thicknesses 1/16-inch to
1/4-inch
Mending Plates
The typical wood-frame home uses galvanized mending plates, joist hangars, and other
metal pieces to join lumber together. Much of it is weird shapes, but flat plates are avail-
able in a number of widths and lengths. You can use the plates as is or cut to size (the
material is galvanized steel and is hard to cut; be sure to use a hacksaw with a fresh
blade). The plates have numerous predrilled holes in them to facilitate hammering with
nails, but you can drill new holes where you need them. 
Mending plates are available in lengths of about 4, 6, and 12 inches by 4 or 6 inches
wide, and also in 2-inch-wide T shapes. You can usually find mending plates, angles, and
other steel framing hardware in the nail and fastener section of the home improvement
store.
Iron Angle Brackets
You need a way to connect all the metal pieces together. The easiest way is to use galva-
nized iron brackets, located in the hardware section of the store. Angle brackets come in
a variety of sizes and shapes and have predrilled holes to facilitate construction. The 3/8-
inch-wide brackets fit easily into the two sizes of channel stock mentioned previously. You
need only to drill a corresponding hole in the channel stock and attach the pieces
together with nuts and bolts. The result is a very sturdy and clean-looking frame. You’ll
find the flat corner angle iron, corner angle (“L”), and flat mending iron to be particular
useful.
Extruded aluminum
(and steel) comes in
common bar, angle,
and channel shapes.

What are jewelry findings? They are small plastic or
metal pieces used to make jewelry. Several common
types are useful in the construction of smaller robots.
For example, earring posts and earring backs can be
used to make miniature linkages. Small beads can be
used as spacers and even bearings; jump rings can be
used to attach small parts (they’re bendable with pli-
ers); and spacer bars can be used as tiny linkages.

Of particular interest are the wood blanks. Most of
these are fairly exotic woods, but they’re not all that
expensive. A benefit of these exotics is that many are
extremely hard and/or dense (like carob) and are a
lot stronger than a piece of pine or some other com-
mon wood. You might want to consider one of these
exotics if you are building a robot with wood and need
strength for the base, risers, or some other compo-
nent.
Smaller variations of these blanks can be found in the
Pen Blanks category and include both wood, celluloid,
and something called Environ, a manufactured mate-
rial that looks like granite or wood, but is actually
newsprint and soybean by-products. Pen blanks are usu-
ally about 3/4 by 5 inches.

Hardware for Hard Robot Bodies
Small, lightweight robots don’t need heavy-duty construction. A little scrap of wood or
plastic, some glue, maybe a piece of Velcro, and you’re done. But bigger robots need a
stronger means of holding things together. Enter construction hardware—things like nuts,
bolts, angles, and extruded aluminum.
Here are some common items you’ll want to have around your shop. Much of it can be
found at the corner hardware or home improvement store. Online and mail-order sources
offer greater variety. If you’re looking to buy a lot of some given hardware, you can often
purchase it in quantity at a significant discount.
Fasteners
The most basic hardware is fasteners. The following descriptions pertain to SAE-size
threads, but similar sizes are available in the metric world.
• Machine screws. Available in different diameters, amateur robots use mainly number 4,
6, 8, and 10 machine screws (4/40, 6/32, 8/32, and 10/24, respectively). Common
lengths are from 1/4 inch to 2 inches; you’ll probably use the 1/2-inch and 3/4-inch
lengths the most. 
• Nuts. Hex nuts are the most common and cheap, but also consider T-nuts (also called
blind nuts), which can be used with wood and soft plastics. Also look for locking nuts,
which are like standard hex nuts but with a nylon insert; the nylon helps prevent the
screw from working itself loose.
• Washers. Flat washers act to spread out the compression force of a fastener. They’re
available in sizes to complement the size of machine screw or bolt you are using. Tooth
(internal or external) and split lock washers help prevent the nut from coming loose.
• All-thread rod. This is sold in 1- to 3-foot lengths. It comes in the same standard thread
sizes and pitches. All-thread is good for shafts and linear motion actuators and to make
bolts of any given length. Buy it when you need it.
The cheap zinc-plated screws, nuts, and washers are fine, but if you want a more hi-
tech look, try the black anodized variety. When weight is a problem, opt for nylon hard-
ware. It’s a little more expensive than metal, and not quite a strong, but considerably
lighter.
When buying machine screws, you have a choice of a variety of heads and drivers.
Common machine screws come in round-head, flat-head, pan-head, or Fillister-head
varieties; round-head or pan-head is adequate for most uses, and they are cheaper when
bought in quantity. (Okay, okay, there are about three dozen additional machine screw
head geometries, but I’m not going to list them all. Most of the specialty varieties are not
generally available except in large quantities.)
Most machine screws available at the hardware store are slotted for flat-bladed screw-
drivers. You may instead wish to use Phillips, Torx, square drive, Pozidrive, or hex head
(Allen wrench) screws, which require the proper screwdriver. Slotted screws are cheaper
to make, so they cost less. But there’s a risk of stripping out the slot if overtightened.
Specialty drive screws can be tightened and loosened without as much risk of stripping
out the head.
Extruded Aluminum
Robot frames and other pieces can be constructed out of extruded aluminum. Designed
for such applications as show trim, picture frames, and other handy applications,
extruded aluminum comes in various sizes, thicknesses, and configurations. Length is
usually 8 or 12 feet, but if you need less, most hardware stores will cut to order.

• 1/2- and 3/4-inch-wide bar
Zinc-Plated Steel Angle Brackets
Standard hardware angle brackets are ideal for general
robotics construction. You can use the brackets to build the
frame of a robot constructed with aluminum extrusion
stock. Common sizes are:
• 1 1/2-inch by 3/8-inch flat corner brackets—used when
joining pieces cut at 45-degree angles to make a frame.
• 1-inch by 3/8-inch, and 1 1/2-inch by 3/8-inch corner angle
brackets—used when attaching the stock to base plates
and when securing various components (like motors) to
the robot. 
Keep in mind that angle brackets are heavy, and if you
use a lot of them, they can add considerably to the weight
or your robot. If you must keep weight down, consider sub-
stituting angle brackets for other mounting techniques,
including gluing, brazing (for metal), or screws fastened directly into the frame or base
material of your robot.
Use extruded aluminum to
make robot frames, bodies,
arms, and other components.
Angle brackets are used in
general robot construction.

Gummy Transfer Tape
Here’s an old trick: Suppose you want some “stickum,” but can’t use tape. One way is to
apply a coating of rubber cement over some waxed paper. Wait half a minute for the
cement to congeal, then gently “roll up” the residue into small clumps. You can now stick
the stickup where you need it.
One disadvantage of this technique is that rubber cement tends to dry out, and its
stickum doesn’t stay sticky for long.
Transfer tape is an option. This stuff, which is also called unsupported adhesive tape,
looks like double-sided tape, but it’s engineered to leave its sticky residue, and no tape.
It’s meant for such jobs as electronics production, where workers apply small dabs of
sticky substances to hold down wires and components. Transfer tape, such as the stuff
made by tesa AG in Germany, is applied by first placing the material as you would any
other tape. You then peel off the waxed paper, and what’s behind is a layer of very sticky
goo. Unlike rubber cement, transfer tape stickum remains tacky and semiflexible. 
Transfer tape is available from art supply stores, adhesive specialists, and electronics
production supply outfits. You can find it online with these Google.com searches (don’t
look just for “transfer tape”; that won’t cut it):
“transfer tape” “tesa 4900”
+”transfer tape” +”waxed backing”
“unsupported adhesive” tape
Here are some online sellers of adhesive transfer tape (note that some tapes work
best when used with a specially made dispenser):

Blenderm: Sticky Stuff without Gummy Residue
3M’s Blenderm is a waterproof adhesive bandage that is intended to be used on people,
but is also pretty handy with robots. The semiclear tape is available in different widths up
to 2 inches, and it sticks to practically anything. Yet it doesn’t leave much gummy junk
behind, and it stays flexible for an eternity. Possible ideas: Use it to construct hinges or
movable flaps.
You can sometimes find Blenderm at local drug stores, but be wary of the cheaper
brands. You want the real stuff, so make sure it says 3M and Blenderm. 
If you can’t find it locally, try on the Web, using the following Google search:

Materials-Paper & Plastic
Laminates
A laminate is a sheet composed of two materials glued
together, almost like a sandwich. 
Laminates save money by using only a small amount of
the expensive outside material, relying on the inside
material to supply most of the bulk. Because two kinds
of materials are cemented together, they tend to rein-
force one another.
A commonly available laminate is foam core, available
at most craft and art supply stores. The material is com-
posed of compressed Styrofoam (or similar), lined on
both sides with heavy colored paper. You can cut foam
core with a knife or a small hobby saw, and ordinary
paper glue can be used to hold the cut pieces together.
Foam core is the most common paper laminate, but it’s
by far not the only one. There is a wide variety of paper
and even plastic laminate sheets available, and many
brands are listed here. Some manufacturers of paper
and plastic sell directly, but most want you to purchase
their goods from arts and craft retailers. For those mak-
ers that don’t sell directly, you can see their Web sites
for handy application notes and material-handling
datasheets.

Cardboard Substrates
When I was a little kid, I sent away for a fiberboard submarine. I didn’t know what “fiber-
board” meant, and I hoped they would send me a real metal submarine. It turned out that
fiberboard is just another name for cardboard, the stuff they make shipping boxes out of.
In fact, my submarine was just a square box with a submarine shape (two colors, no
less!) printed on it.
Cardboard may not make for good submarines, but—surprise!—it can be used as an
effective construction material for robotics. Not just any cardboard, though. Common
cardboard consists of two thin sheets (liner boards) of paper sandwiched to a corrugated
inner core, or medium. The thickness and material used for the inner corrugated medium
determines the overall rigidity of the cardboard. Cardboard for shipping boxes is too light-
weight for most robot projects.
A better kind is called honeycomb board. This is a special kind of cardboard that uses a
thick honeycomb medium. Thickness can vary from 1/2 inch to several inches. Honeycomb
board is available at many art supply stores and is used in model making. For robotics, it
can be sandwiched to a thin carrier, such as plywood or plastic, or even metal. The carrier
need not be thick; the strength of the sandwich material will come from the cardboard.
Compared to both cardboard and foam core, honeycomb board (that’s a generic term
for it, by the way) is quite expensive. However, it has good structural characteristics.
When used properly, honeycomb board can hold over 100 pounds.

ble), machinable plastic, foam board, and tools for cast

 Materials-Plastics
Most everyone knows the famous line in the movie The
Graduate, where, at Dustin Hoffman’s graduation
party, a man comes up to him and tells him to get into
the one business of the future, “plastics.” What audi-
ences worldwide don’t know is that the man was really
talking about plastics used in amateur robots. Both plas-
tics and robots are the wave of the future, so it makes
sense they are connected at the hip.
This section details resources for affordable plastics
that can be used in the construction of robot frames,
bases, and shells. Many of the listings are for online
retailers, though some are for local establishments.
Plastics specialty outlets and sign makers are among the
best sources of plastics for robot bodies. 
In a pinch, you can purchase a small sheet of acrylic or
polycarbonate plastic at the local hardware store. But
these plastics are harder—and in the case of acrylics,
prone to cracking—than such specialty plastics as PVC,
ABS, Delrin, styrene, and nylon.
Note that if you purchase sheet plastics from a specialty
retailer, you may have to buy an entire sheet, which is 4
by 8 feet. Most will cut it for you. If you don’t need that
much material, most retailers have a “junk bin” of
excess plastic pieces; scrounge through it to see what
you can find. 
One possible problem with this method: Unless you
know your plastics, you may end up buying material that
is more trouble than it’s worth. There are some resin
plastics that are difficult to cut and drill and which will
not respond to solvent cements intended for the more
common PVC, ABS, and styrene plastics. If you’re not
sure what kind of plastic you’ve found, be sure to ask.

Foam Core Substrates
Foam core is part foam, part paper. It is available from art supply stores, in thicknesses
from 1/8 to 1 inch. Construction is simple: An inner foam sheet is sandwiched on both
sides with high-quality paper. Foam core is cheap, easy to cut with a hobby knife or small
scroll saw, and can be readily glued.
You can provide extra rigidity to foam core by combining it with another thick substrate,
such as cardboard, thin metal, or plastic. However, depending on thickness and weight
loads, foam core can be used by itself.

Also offers Sign Foam, a heavier-bodied rigid
polyurethane foam that can be drilled, carved, cut, and
routed. According to the site: “Sign Foam is a light-
weight, high density polyurethane board that possesses
remarkable strength and durability. It is unlike any
other foam you may have used . . . in strength, hard-
ness, chemical resistance, structural durability, screw
holding capabilities, and thermal expansion and con-
traction rates.”

Types of Plastics 
There are literally thousands of types of plastics. Here is a listing of the more common varieties you will
encounter as you build robots. 
• ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene). The most common application for ABS is sewer and waste-
water plumbing systems. ABS is the large black pipes and fittings you see in the hardware store.
Despite its shiny black appearance in plumbing material, ABS is really a glossy, translucent plastic
that can take on just about any color and texture. It is tough and hard and yet relatively easy to cut
and drill. Besides plumbing fittings, ABS comes in rods, sheets, and pipes and is the plastic used to
construct LEGO pieces.
• Acrylic. Acrylic is clear and strong, the mainstay of the decorative plastics industry. It can be easily
scratched, but if the scratches aren’t too deep, they can be rubbed out. Acrylic is somewhat tough
to cut without cracking and requires careful drilling. The material comes mostly in sheets, but is also
available in extruded tubing, rods, and is the coating in pour-on plastic laminate.
• Cellulosics. Lightweight, flimsy, but surprisingly resilient, cellulosic plastics are often used as sheet
coverings. They have minor uses in robotics. One useful application, however: The material softens
at low heat, and can be slowly formed around an object. Comes in sheet or film form. 
• Epoxy. Very durable clear plastic, often used as the binder in fiberglass. Epoxies most often come
in liquid form, for pouring over something or onto a fiberglass base. The dried material can be cut,
drilled, and sanded.
• Nylon. Tough, slippery, self-lubricating stuff most often used as a substitute for twine. Nylon also
comes in rods and sheets from plastics distributors. Nylon is flexible, which makes it moderately
hard to cut. 
• Phenolic. An original plastic, phenolics are usually black or brown in color, easy to cut and drill, and
smell terrible when heated. The material is usually reinforced with wood or cotton bits or is lami-
nated with paper or cloth. Even with these additives, phenolic plastics are not unbreakable. Comes
in rods, sheets, and pour-on coatings. Minor application in robotics except as circuit board material.
• Polycarbonate. Polycarbonate plastic is a close cousin to acrylic but more durable and more resist-
ant to breakage. Polycarbonate plastics are slightly cloudy in appearance and easy to mar and
scratch. Comes in rods, sheets, and tubing. A common inexpensive window-glazing material, poly-
carbonates are hard to cut and drill.
• Polyethylene. Polyethylene is lightweight and translucent and is often used to make flexible tubing. It
also comes in rod, film, sheet, and pipe form. The material can be reformed with application of low
heat, and when in tube form, can be cut with a knife. 
• Polypropylene. Like polyethylene, but harder and more resistant to heat. 
• Polystyrene. A mainstay in the toy industry. This plastic is hard, clear (can be colored with dyes),
and cheap. Although often labeled as “high-impact” plastic, polystyrene is brittle and susceptible to
damage by low heat and sunlight. Available in rods, sheets, and foam board. Moderately hard to
cut and drill without cracking and breaking.
• Polyurethane. These days, polyurethane is most often used as insulation material, but it’s also avail-
able in rod and sheet forms. The plastic is durable, flexible, and relatively easy to cut and drill.
• PVC (polyvinyl chloride). PVC is an extremely versatile plastic best known as the material used in
freshwater plumbing and outdoor plastic patio furniture. Usually processed with white pigment,
PVC is actually clear and softens in relatively low heat. PVC is extremely easy to cut and drill and
almost impervious to breakage. Beside plumbing fixtures and pipes, PVC is supplied in film, sheet,
rod, tube, even nut and bolt form. 
• Silicone. A large family of plastics all in its own right. Because of their elasticity, silicone plastics are
most often used in molding compounds. Silicone is slippery to the touch and comes in resin form
for pouring.

Decoding Plastic ID Symbols
You’ve seen them on the bottom of bottles and canisters. They’re the funny circular arrow
thingamajigs with numbers inside. You know this already, but they’re ID symbols, which
are designed to help consumers and recyclers tell the difference between various plastics.
Well, if you’re building robots out of junk you find around the house, it can be darned
useful to know what kind of plastic you are using, in case you want to join two or more
pieces with some solvent cement. Why is this important? Because different plastics
require different kinds of solvent cements. A solvent for one plastic may do absolutely
nothing for another.
Here’s what the ID symbols mean.
PETE—polyethylene terephthalate
HDPE—high-density polyethylene
PVC—polyvinyl chloride
LDPE—low-density polyethylene
PP—polypropylene
PS—polystyrene

The Joys of Rigid Expanded PVC
What (sort of) looks like wood, drills like wood, cuts like
wood, and sands like wood—but isn’t wood? Expanded
polyvinyl chloride (PVC). This material, commonly used for
both sign making and construction, is manufactured by mix-
ing an inert gas with the molten plastic. The plastic is then
extruded into various shapes: sheets, rods, tubes, bars, and
more. The gas (usually nitrogen or carbon dioxide) forms
tiny microscopic bubbles in the plastic, which makes the
material bulkier when it cools.
This means foamed PVC contains less plastic than ordi-
nary PVC materials. This has two advantages:
• Less plastic = less weight. That’s important in building robots for which added weight
drains the battery faster.
• Less plastic = less density. This makes foamed PVC easier to drill, cut, and mill. If
you’ve ever cut acrylic plastic, you know it chips and breaks easily, and its high density
makes using hand tools a real chore. The thinner, foamed PVC materials can be cut
using a knife; the thicker stuff, with an ordinary saw blade.
PVC Sheets for Signage
Foamed PVC is often used as a replacement for wood in some outdoor applications,
typically where moisture and rot are a problem. The material is formed into familiar
wood-like shapes, and some even has a wood grain. As robot builders, we’re not too
interested in this stuff. Rather, we’re after the foamed PVC sheets used to make signs
(sign makers refer to this raw material as substrate). It’s available in a variety of sizes
and thicknesses, in a rainbow of colors: blue, red, orange, tan, black, brown, yellow . . .
you name it. 
Foamed PVC goes by many trade names, such as Sintra, Celtec, Komatex, Trovicel,
Versacel, and Komcel, but it’s probably easiest if you just ask for it by its generic “foamed
PVC” moniker. Sheets are commonly available in any of several “mil” sizes (a mil is one
millimeter). Of the more common thicknesses:
• 3 mil, or roughly 1/8 inch
• 6 mil, or roughly 1/4 inch
• 10 mil, or roughly 13/32 inch
Not all colors are available in all thicknesses. I’ve found the thicker pieces are available
in basic black or white only, with colors a special-order item (often requiring large vol-
umes).
The same cements and adhesives for PVC irrigation pipes can be used with foamed
PVC. I like using a fairly thin cement, such as Weld-On 66. It has a medium consistency
and is clear. It can be brushed on or applied using a suitable needle applicator (you can
get cement brushes and applicators at the same place you buy the PVC plastic). You can
also use a specialty adhesive, such as Foamex contact adhesive, for fast production
assembly. 
PVC cements bond by partially “melting” the plastic pieces and are recommended over
traditional adhesives, including hot glue and epoxies. For best results, rough up the
pieces to be cemented by lightly sanding the surfaces. Everything has to be squeaky
clean for a good bond. You can clean PVC using ordinary acetone.
Foamed (expanded) PVC
comes in a variety of
thicknesses and colors.

If you’re assembling large quantities of PVC parts, consider the investment of a ther-
moplastic welder. These welders apply concentrated heat that melts the plastic pieces
together. Get a model that has several temperature settings, as you’ll need to experiment
with the proper heat level for a strong, consistent weld. Thermoplastic welding kits for
everything but heavy-duty assembly are available in the $200 to $500 range; tips wear
out over time, and replacements cost $25 to $50.
Though foamed PVC can be “worked” just like wood, if you use power tools, adjust the
speed of the drill, saw, or sander so that it’s slower than you’d use for wood. This reduces
heat from friction; the heat can cause the plastic to melt, and it makes for a messy cut. If
the drill or blade is thin, the melted plastic may recongeal, and you’ll have to recut it. Almost
all of the better saws and drills, and many bench sanders, allow for adjusting speed.

Foamed PVC—The Devil’s in the Details
Foamed (or expanded) PVC is one of the best materials for constructing strong robot
bodies. It’s relatively cheap, lightweight, and easy to work with. The material is available in
sheet form, as well as tubes, squares, rods, and other shapes. Here are some details
about working with the stuff.
• While foamed PVC can be sawed and drilled like wood, the feed rate should be slower.
This prevents gumming up the drill or saw.
• During cutting or drilling, cool the cut with a blast of compressed air. A flexible hose can
be set up on your saw or drill press for this. The air also removes chips that can gum
up the saw or drill.
• You can use most any high-speed cutting tools with foamed PVC. Band saws, circular
saws, and panel saws are good choices. I use a radial arm saw, equipped with a car-
bide-tipped combination blade, to cut out pieces of PVC sheets.
• When using a reciprocating saw, blades with a tooth pitch of 0.080-inch to 0.32-inch give
best results. For circular saws, blades with a minimum of 80 teeth are recommended.
• Wood, metal, or plastic drills can be used. If using milling tools, ground them the same
as you would when using other plastics. Drills should have a 30-degree angle of twist in
order to facilitate chip removal (or else the plastic may remelt into the cut). 
• For faster cutting, scoring, punching, or perforating, you can warm PVC to 85 to 105
degrees (an incandescent or infrared heat lamp is a good choice). 
• Deep groves or notches should be avoided, as this reduces the strength of the material.
• Solvent-based materials containing MEK (methyl ethyl ketone) or THF (tetra hyrdo
furan) are often used to join PVC pieces together. Both of these chemicals are highly
toxic, however. Treat them with respect. These chemicals are the most common sol-
vent ingredients found in PVC cement sold at hardware and home improvement stores.
• You can either apply the solvent with a narrow artist’s brush, or better yet, use a
needlepoint applicator. For the latter, you need low-viscosity solvent, such as WELD-
ON 2007.
• Clean all surfaces to be joined with isopropyl alcohol. Acetone can be used to remove
sticky residue or inks from the plastic, but apply sparingly, as the acetone partially melts
the plastic.
• Bear in mind that adhesives cannot fill gaps in the materials. Strive for straight, even cuts.
• Foamed PVC is thermoformable, so it can be heated and bent into shapes. Use a heat
gun, heat strip, or other apparatus approved for use with bending plastics. Never, ever
use an open flame to heat PVC, or any other plastic. Though foamed PVC is flame
retardant, it can catch on fire; if it does, it releases toxic gas, and the molten plastic can
drip and cause very serious burns.

The Case Against PVC
Plumbers and robot builders love PVC (polyvinyl chloride). According to industry sources,
it’s the second most commonly used plastic in the world. And to some, it’s also a major
polluter.
The international Greenpeace organization contends that PVC is one of the world’s
largest sources of dioxin. The dioxin is released during manufacture of the plastic, but
also when the plastic is burned. Unlike many other plastics, most PVC products are not
“recycled” (in the traditional sense), and more often than not are simply disposed of in
landfills or incinerated. By the way, if you can find a Recycling Plastic ID symbol on the
product, you’ll know it’s made of PVC if it says “3.”
Does this mean you should not use PVC in your robotic creations? That’s up to you.
There are disadvantages to most any substrate or building material you may use. A metal
or wood base may be no less environmentally unfriendly; toxins are released during the
manufacture of all metals, and the hardwoods in high-quality plywood may come from
rain forests that are not being replanted. What’s a robot builder to do?
First and foremost, use your materials wisely. Don’t waste. Not only does this save you
money, it helps reduce scrap sent to the landfill. Design your robot so that you can use
standard-size materials with little or no excess. Except for shavings or very small pieces,
save all your discards. You can use them for braces and cross pieces.
Second, some kinds of PVC material are more air than PVC. So-called foamed PVC
(sometimes called expanded or cellular PVC) is made by injecting air or other inert gas
into the slurry, so that the plastic is “bulked up.” This reduces the weight of a given piece,
and less PVC material is used.
Finally, when possible, raid the scrap and salvage bins at your local plastics store or
sign maker store. Just because a sheet of plastic has been previously used doesn’t mean
it can’t be cut up and used to build your next robot. You’ll save some money, and you’ll
know you’re doing your part to clean up the earth.

Celastic—Plastic-Impregnated Fabric
I’ve always envied prop makers for movies and theater. They get to play with the neatest
stuff. Case in point is Celastic, a woven fabric that is impregnated with polymer (plastic).
Out of the box, the fabric is a little stiff. It is “activated” by drenching it in acetone, which
effectively melts the plastic. 
After soaking in acetone, the fabric becomes quite flexible and can be molded to most
any shape. As the acetone evaporates, the plastic in the cloth recongeals, and the fabric
hardens to a semistiff mat. The fabric retains its shape enough to apply latex, fiberglass,
urethane resin, or urethane foam, if you want a more robust structure.
You can use Celastic to create an unusual robot body. If you apply urethane foam to
the “dried” Celastic, you can sand down the contours and even paint it. Celastic is sold in
48- to 50-inch-wide strips, usually by the yard. The acetone to activate the material can
be purchased in the paint department at any hardware or home improvement store. Do
remember to use Celastic with proper ventilation only, and keep the acetone—and the
drying Celastic cloth—away from open flames.
Celastic is available from most casting and mold-making supply outlets, taxidermy retailers,
and specialty retailers that deal with puppet-making goods. Online retailers of Celastic include:

Tips for Drilling and Cutting Acrylic
All things considered, acrylic plastic isn’t the best material for building robots, but it’s rela-
tively cheap and can be found everywhere. You’re better off using ABS or PVC plastic (or
a mix of the two). They’re easier to cut and drill than acrylic, and they’re lighter per
square inch, too.
But, ABS and PVC plastic sheets can be hard to find. Sometimes, we have to use what
we can get, so if you’re stuck building a robot out of acrylic plastic, here are 10 tips for
drilling and cutting it into the shape you need.
1. First and foremost, always wear protective goggles or safety glasses. Acrylic can
shatter when cutting or drilling it, and pieces may fly off and lodge into your eye. Use
caution—plastic can be nasty!
2. Avoid using wood drill bits. Drill bits designed for plastic or glass drilling yield better,
safer results. You probably only need one or two plastic bits; 1/8-inch and 3/16-inch
sizes should suffice for most work.
3. Use a power drill and not a hand drill. You get best results by using a medium drill
speed; about 750 to 1,000 rpm. (For wood, you want a fast speed; for plastic a
medium speed; and for metal, a slow speed).
4. When drilling, always back the plastic with a wooden block or a piece of masking tape.
Without the block or tape, the plastic is almost guaranteed to crack
5. Holes larger than 1/4-inch should first be made by drilling a smaller pilot hole. Start
with a small drill and work your way up several steps.
6. Use a radial arm or table saw for straight cuts. Though there are specialty blades for
cutting plastics, they are expensive. A regular combination blade is acceptable for all
but the thinnest of acrylic sheets.
7. Use only a sharp blade. 
8. Avoid fast feed rates, and don’t force the material into the blade. When cutting (and
drilling, for that matter), the plastic tends to remelt at the cut, and pushing the work
too fast can generate lots of friction.
9. For rounded cuts, use a saber saw or scroll saw (the latter is my preference). Or, if
you don’t have to cut much, a manual coping saw. Use a slow speed to avoid remelt-
ing the cut plastic due to friction.
10. Finish the cut ends and sharp corners of the plastic with a metal file. If you have the
equipment, you can also burnish the edges with plastic rouge and a buffing wheel.
The experts use flame burnishing to obtain smooth edges, but I don’t recommend it if
you’re not skilled in the art.

Hot and Cold Dipping Plastics
Dipping plastics are like fondue with polymers. Perhaps the
best-known application for dipping plastics is applying a
kind of rubberized grip to hand tools—just dip the handle of
the tool into a can of dip, pull out after a few seconds, and
let dry. Most dip can also be applied by brushing, but the
idea is the same.
Dipping plastics harden to a tough shell or a rubbery
sheath, depending on the chemistry used. There are two
basic flavors: cold and hot. Cold dip is not heated before
use, and it cures with exposure to air. Hot dip is cured by
warming it in an electric oven as per the manufacturer’s directions (typically 350 to 375
degrees for 15 or 20 minutes). The plastic completes its curing process when cooled.
For robotics, dipping plastic can be used to add a rubberized soft coating to the legs of
walking bots, to frame bumpers to reduce damage, to add traction to wheels, and even
to provide extra insulation for wire connectors.
Here are some tips when using dipping plastics:
• Curing times for cold dip can be reduced by gently warming with a hair dryer.
• Apply several thin coats rather than one thick coat. 
• Hot dipping is best when the object being dipped is preheated. Obviously, this won’t
work if you’re using plastic or wood. It works well for metal objects, like the aluminum
legs of a walking robot.
The most popular dipping material is plastisol, a PVC compound that can be made in
most any color, thickness, and hardness (when cured). In addition to being used as a
heavy coating, plastisol serves as a semiflexible mold.
Dipping plastic is available in
dip or brush-on cans.

• 1- to 2-inch diameter lightweight PVC and alu-
minum tubing, used to create displays and racks.
Along with the tubing are various types and styles of
connectors: 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, even 6-way connectors-all of
which can be used to build cheap (as in inexpen-
sive) robot frames.
• Ball bearing lazy Susan turntables, intended to
make rotating displays, but useful for any rotational
movement in a robot. Sizes from 3 to 12 inches in
diameter and even larger.
• Slat wall is used to mount peg bars for holding mer-
chandise. This material is plastic with T-shaped slots
grooved into it at even intervals. With simple hard-
ware, you can use slat wall as a reconfigurable robot
base, no drilling required.
The list goes on. Peruse the online and printed catalogs
of these vendors for more ideas.

works with many laser printers) decal film is the water
slip type; after printing, place in water for a short
period of time, then transfer to a flat, clean surface-
wood (sanded, closed-grained are best), plastic, or
metal. They even sell a “tattoo paper” that lets you
make temporary tattoos of your rad robots.

Lazertan is a thin paper that is used to transfer full-
color images to flat surfaces, such as wood, tile, metal,
or plastic. You first print the image onto the paper
using a color photocopier. The paper is then left to
soak in water, like a decal, until its emulsion is soft. The
emulsion is then transferred to the surface you want to
cover. You can use Lazertran in lieu of painting or as
labeling for a control panel.

Fun with Transfer Films
Thanks to a wide variety of transfer films, expressing your creativity and showing it to the
world has never been easier. With just a laser printer, ink-jet printer, or copier, you can
transfer images to many kinds of surfaces, including fabric, wood, metal, and plastic. 
Among the most common transfer films are iron-on transfer for fabric, for making cus-
tom T-shirts. Elsewhere in this section you can learn about Lazertran, a water-slide decal
transfer film that works with color copiers. Once printed, you can transfer the Lazertran
image to a variety of hard surfaces (there is also a version for printing on fabric, to make
framable art).
And yet there are still others, all driven by a robust appetite for such custom-made
items as mugs, mouse pads, the aforementioned T-shirts, amateur sports trophies—you
name it, there’s probably a transfer film for it. Some require a special kind of printer, such
as the Alps and Citizen Printiva, which use a dry-resin thermal transfer ink for the most
vibrant colors. Others work with ordinary ink-jet and laser printers. The transfer method is
usually either heat—the toner/ink transfers from film to surface using an iron or heat
press—or by immersion in liquid, usually water.
Here are some additional resources for transfer films. Be sure to check out their offer-
ings to see what they have available.

Color Anything with Water-Slide Decals
If you’ve ever assembled a plastic model kit you know about water-slide decals: Dip the
decal into warm water, wait a few seconds, then slide the clear decal emulsion off the
backing paper and onto your model.
Modern marvels being what they are, you can print your own water-slide decals using a
laser or ink-jet printer. The decal “paper” can accept black-and-white or color images.
While you must print a full sheet at a time (though some printers will accept smaller sizes
down to about 4 by 6 inches), you can cut out individual decals and apply the smallest to
various parts of your robot.
You can use water-slide decals for making control panels or labels, and, of course, to
dress up your robot with color or design. The decal will stick to most any smooth surface
and should be “fixed” into place with a gloss or matte overspray. These chemicals are
available at any hobby or art supply store and are expressly designed for use with decals.
Water-slide decal paper is but one subgroup of a larger family of printer transfer films,
which also includes clear and translucent “sticky-back”—used primarily for overlays—and
adhesive-backed opaque vinyl, often used for bumper stickers and signs. These materials
share the common trait of compatibility with color copiers and laser and/or ink-jet print-
ers, allowing you to prepare your own designs quickly and relatively cheaply.

Microcontrollers
Microcontrollers helped bring amateur robotics into
the mainstream. These single-chip computers are
expressly designed to be used in so-called embedded
applications, where control of some external device is
the main goal. Microcontrollers can be connected to
sensors and motors-input and output. Based on the
robot’s input, the internal programming in the micro-
controller can command the motors in such a way that
the robot exhibits quasi-intelligent functions. For
instance, the ‘bot might move toward a light or away
from a barking dog. The possibilities are endless.
The following sections list numerous resources for
microcontrollers. Included are manufacturers of com-
plete board-level products with built-in robotic func-
tions, coding examples, and software to aid in program-
ming microcontrollers. The sections are:
• Hardware: Lists resources for microcontroller hard-
ware, particularly ready-made boards that incorpo-
rate the microcontroller chip, voltage regulator,
extra memory (when needed), and interface ele-
ments.
• Programming: Examples of programming micro-
controllers, with an emphasis on code useful in
robotics.
• Software: Add-in software for writing your own
microcontroller programs.

Basic Stamp, but has a number of hardware features
that make it ideal for use in robots: 
• SpMotor-Control stepper motors 
• Servo-Easily control servo motors
• HPWM-Use the hardware PWM of a PICmicro 
• Interrupts-Use interrupts with Basic 
• ADin-Easily use internal A/D on PICmicro 
• OWIN/OWOU-Use Dallas 1-wire 
• XIN/XOU-Use X-10 devices 
The 24-pin version of the Atom is pin-compatible with
the Basic Stamp II, and the programming language

used with the Atom is a superset of that found on the
Basic Stamp II. 
The MBasic compilers let you program a PIC microcon-
troller in Basic, compile the program to the PIC’s native
assembly language, and download that program to
chip. Available in two versions, Basic and Pro; I recom-
mend the Pro version, though it costs a little more.

The BasicX is a general-purpose microcontroller with a
built-in programming language. You write programs on
the PC using a Basic-like syntax, then download them,
via a cable, to the BasicX. Unplug the cable, and the
program now resident on the BasicX runs. 
There are several flavors of the BasicX: 
The BasicX-1 is a 40-pin chip that requires an external
crystal and capacitors and voltage regulator (if one is
not provided with your other circuitry). The BasicX-24
is a 24-pin chip that has everything on-board to run
from a 6- or 9-volt battery. The pinout of the BX-24 is
the same as the Basic Stamp II from Parallax. 
Several advantages of the BasicX include its fast pro-
cessing time, plus its ability to directly access most of
the hardware registers on the microcontroller (both
chips use Atmel AVR controllers). The company sells
development boards to make it easier to prototype your
projects, as well as a serial LCD module. 
The product is available through distributors or directly
from the Web site.

Microcontrollers Are Self-Contained Computers
A key benefit of microcontrollers is that they combine a microprocessor component with
various input/output typically needed to interface with the real world. The typical micro-
controller sports these features:
• Central processing unit (CPU)
• Hardware interrupts 
• Built-in timer/counter
• Programmable full-duplex serial port 
• Multiple I/O lines (typically from 8 to 32) 
• RAM and ROM/EPROM in some models
Some microcontrollers will have greater or fewer input/output (I/O) lines, and not all
have hardware interrupt inputs (an interrupt is a way for an external device to “get the
attention” of the controller); some will have special-purpose I/O for such things as voltage
comparison or analog-to-digital conversion.
Just as there is no one car that’s perfect for everyone, the design of each microcon-
troller makes it more suitable for a given application than another. When selecting the
microcontroller for your robot, first analyze the hardware requirements. Most microcon-
trollers are part of a family or line, with siblings that have fewer or more features. Check
out the specifications of another controller in the same line to see if a variation provides
just the right hardware for your robo needs.

The Basic Stamp Microcontroller
Since its inception, the Basic Stamp has provided the
“onboard brains” for countless robotics projects. This
thumbprint-sized microcontroller uses Basic language com-
mands for instructions and is popular among robot enthusi-
asts, electronics and computer science instructors, and
even design engineers looking for an inexpensive alternative
to microprocessor-based systems. 
The Basic Stamp, which is manufactured by Parallax is
really an off-the-shelf  Microchip PICmicro microcontroller.
Embedded in this PIC is a proprietary Basic-like language
interpreter, called PBasic. The chip stores commands
downloaded from a PC or other development environment.
When the program is run, the language interpreter built inside the Stamp converts the
instructions into code the chip can use.
As a result, the Basic Stamp acts like a programmable electronic circuit, with the added
benefit of intelligent control—but without the complexity and circuitry overhead of a dedi-
cated microprocessor. Instead of building a logic circuit out of numerous inverters, AND
gates, flip-flops, and other hardware; you can use just the Basic Stamp module to provide
the same functionality, doing everything in software.
The Basic Stamp uses two kinds of memory: PROM (programmable read-only memory)
and RAM. The PROM memory is used to store the PBASIC interpreter; the RAM is used to
store data while a PBASIC program is running. Housed in a separate chip (but still part of
the Basic Stamp itself; see the description of the BSII module, later) is EEPROM memory
for the programs you download from your computer. 
In operation, your PBASIC program is written on a PC, then downloaded—via a serial
connection—to the Basic Stamp. The program is stored in EEPROM. 
The Basic Stamp is available directly from its manufacturer or from a variety of dealers
world over. Prices from most sources are about the same. The Basic Stamp is available in
several versions, including the older BSI, the ever-popular BSII, and new BSII-SX, 2p, and
2e. The Stamp comes stand-alone or is part of several kits:
• BSII Module. The Basic Stamp module contains the actual microcontroller chip, as well
as other support circuitry. All are mounted on a small printed circuit board that is the
same general shape as a 24-pin IC. In fact, the BSII is made to plug into a 24-pin IC
socket. The BSII module contains the microcontroller, which holds the PBASIC inter-
preter, a 5-volt regulator, a resonator (required for the microcontroller), and a serial
EEPROM chip.
• BSII Starter Kit. The starter kit is ideal for those just, well, starting out. It includes a BSII
module, a carrier board, programming cable, power adapter, and software on CD-
ROM. The carrier board has a 24-pin socket for the BSII module, a connector for the
programming cable, power adapter jack, and a prototype area for designing your own
interface circuitry.
• Basic Stamp Activity Board. The Activity Board, which is typically sold without a BSII
module, offers a convenient way of experimenting with the Basic Stamp. It contains
four LEDs, four switches, a modular jack for experimenting with X-10 remote-control
modules, a speaker, and two sockets for easy interfacing of such things as serial ana-
log-to-digital converters (ADCs).
• Growbot and BOE Bot. The Growbot and BOE Bot products are small mobile robot kits
that are designed to use the Basic Stamp microcontroller. The robots are similar, with
The Basic Stamp
microcontroller.

microcontrollers-hardware 343
the BOE Bot a little larger and heavier and able to accommodate more experiments. A
BSII module is generally not included with either robot kit.
• Basic Stamp Bug II. Another robot kit, the Basic Stamp Bug II is a six-legged walking
robot. The Bug is meant to be controlled with a BSI microcontroller, though it could be
refitted to use the BSII. The Basic Stamp module is extra.
The PBASIC language supports several dozen special functions, many of which are
ideal for robotics. You’ll want to study these statements more fully in the Basic Stamp
manual, which is available for free download from Parallax and is also included in the
Starter Kit as a printed book.
• button—The button statement momentarily checks the value of an input and then
branches to another part of the program should the button be in a LOW (0) or HIGH (1)
state. The button statement lets you choose the I/O pin to examine, the “target state”
that you are looking for (either 0 or 1), and delay and rate parameters that can be used
for such things as switch debouncing.
• debug—The Basic Stamp Editor (which runs on your PC) has a built-in terminal that dis-
plays the result of bytes sent from the Basic Stamp back to the PC. The debug state-
ment “echos” numbers or text to the screen and is highly useful during testing.
• freqout—The freqout statement is used to generate tones primarily intended for audio
reproduction. You can set the I/O pin, duration, and frequency (in Hertz) using the fre-
qout statement. An interesting feature of freqout is that you can apply a second fre-
quency, which intermixes with the first. 
• input—The input statement makes the specified I/O pin an input. As an input, the value
of the pin can be read in the program. Many of the special function statements, such as
button and pulsin, automatically set an I/O pin as an input, so the input statement is not
needed for these.
• pause—The pause statement is used to delay execution by a set amount of time. To
use pause you specify the number of milliseconds (thousandths of a second) to wait.
For example, pause 1000 pauses for one second.
• pulsin—The pulsin statement measures the width of a single pulse, with a resolution of
two microseconds (2 µs) on the Basic Stamp II.
• pulsout—Pulsout is the inverse of pulsin: with pulsout you can create a finely measured
pulse, with a duration of between 2 µs (on the Basic Stamp II) and 131 milliseconds. The
pulsout statement is ideal when you need to provide highly accurate waveforms.
• rctime—The rctime statement measures the time it takes for an RC (resistor/capacitor)
network to discharge to an opposite logical state. The rctime statement is often used
to indirectly measure the capacitance or resistance of a circuit, or simply as a kind of
simplified analog-to-digital circuit.
• serin and serout—Serin and serout are used to send and receive asynchronous serial
communications. It is one method of communicating with other devices, even other Basic
Stamps, all connected together. You use serout to send commands and text to the LCD.
• shiftin and shiftout—The serin and serout statements (see previous) are used in one-
wire asynchronous serial communications. The shiftin and shiftout statements are used
in two- or three-wire synchronous serial communications. The main difference is that
with shiftin/shiftout a separate pin is used for clocking the data between its source and
destination.

Handy Board, The
202936
http://www.handyboard.com/
The Handy Board uses a Motorola 68HC11 microcon-
troller to build a sophisticated robotics central brain.
The Handy Board is used in many college and univer-
sity robotics courses (it was originally developed at
MIT) and is suitable for education, hobby, and indus-
trial purposes. As the Web site says, “People use the
Handy Board to run robot design courses and competi-
tions at the university and high school level, build
robots for fun, and control industrial devices.” 
The features of the Handy Board are: 
• Motorola 68HC11 microcontroller 
• 2-line LCD 
• Integrated 700mAh ni-cad rechargeable battery
(not included in some versions) 
• 8 analog inputs 
• 9 digital inputs 
• Infrared output and input 
• Start and stop buttons 
• Piezo buzzer 
• 32K battery-backed memory to store programs 
• 4 1.1 amp H-bridge motor drivers (not included in
some versions) 
• Serial (RS-232) and SPI interfaces 
The HandyBoard.com Web site is a facilitator of the
Handy Board; MIT allows the board to be reproduced
by anyone for noncommercial purposes. However, you
may find it easier to get one already made, either assem-
bled or in form. Vendors are listed on the Web site and
include Gleason Research, The Robot Store in Hong
Kong, and Acroname (all are listed in this book). 
A variety of software choices are available for the Handy
Board, but the most common recommended is
Interactive C, a multitasking C language that allows for
compiling programs, as well as line-at-a-time command
execution. A free version of Interactive C is available for

The BasicX Microcontroller
Microcontrollers are fast becoming a favorite method of
endowing a robot with smarts. Offering both speed and
ability is the BasicX by NetMedia, a company that previously
devoted itself to home automation and small Web cams.
The BasicX-24 is actually a member of a family of microcon-
trollers from NetMedia, which also includes the less expen-
sive (but network-capable) BasicX-1, as well as the BasicX-
35. We’ll concentrate just on the BasicX-24 (or BX-24) from
here on out.
A selling point of the BX-24 is that it is pin-for-pin com-
patible with Parallax’s Basic Stamp II. It’s important to note
that the BX-24 is not a Stamp “clone.” The two microcontrollers don’t share the same
programming languages, so programs written for one will not work on the other. 
The BX-24 directly supports 16 input/output (I/O) lines. For each I/O line, or pin, you can
change the direction from an input or an output. When an I/O line is an output, you can
individually control the value of the pin, either 0 (logic LOW) or 1 (logic HIGH). When an I/O
line is an input, you can read a digital or analog value of a TTL-compatible device con-
nected to the BX-24. Eight of the 16 I/O lines can be used for analog connections. The
BX-24 incorporates its own built-in 10-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC). Under soft-
ware control, you can indicate which of the eight input lines is to be read.
Three of the plated-through holes of the BX-24 serve as optional I/O and are pro-
grammatically referred to as pins 25, 26, and 27, making a total of 19 input/output pins.
(The remaining plated-through holes provide a way to connect to the chip’s serial
peripheral interface, or SPI, lines. Connecting to these lines is not recommended unless
you’re familiar with SPI interfaces, especially as the BX-24’s EEPROM is controlled by
these same I/O lines.)
A nice touch on the BX-24 is its two LEDs: one red and one green. The green LED is
normally used to indicate power-on for the chip, but you can individually control both
LEDs from your own programs. You might use the LEDs as status indicators, for example.
The LEDs share two of the additional plated-through hole connectors on the BX-24.
The BX-24 board comes with its own 5-volt voltage regulator, which provides enough
operating current for all the components on the board, plus several LEDs or logic ICs. If
you plan on using the BX-24 to operate a robot, you’ll want to provide a separate power
supply of adequate current rating to the other components of the robot. You should not
rely on the BX-24’s onboard regulator for this task.
In order to program the BX-24 you need to purchase the BasicX-24 developer’s kit,
which contains one BX-24, a programming cable, a power supply, a “carrier board,” and
programming software on CD-ROM. Cost as of this writing is $99 for the developer’s kit,
with additional BX-24s at $49.95 each. You plug the BX-24 into the carrier board, which
has a 24-pin socket and empty solder pads that you can use to add your own circuitry.
The programming cable connects between the carrier board and a serial port on your PC.
The power supply is the “wall wart” variety and provides about 12 to 16 vdc.
The BX-24 uses a proprietary programming environment, which consists of an editor
and a download console, which also serves double-duty as a terminal for data sent from
the microcontroller. The program editor supports the BasicX language, which is a subset
of Microsoft Visual Basic. Don’t expect all Visual Basic commands to be available in
BasicX, however. BasicX supports the same general syntax as Visual Basic and many of
the same data types (bytes, integers, strings, and so forth).
If you’re familiar with Visual Basic, then you should feel right at home with BasicX. The
BasicX language supports the usual control structures, such as If/End If, While/Wend,
The BasicX-24 (BX-24) micro-
controller, on a development board.

microcontrollers-hardware 349
For/Next, and Select/Case. Your BasicX programs can be subroutines, and you can call
those subroutines from anywhere in the program. 
The BX-24 is a general-purpose microcontroller, so many of its built-in features are
geared toward any typical personal or commercial microcontroller application. Still, a
number of features of the BasicX programming language lend themselves to use in robot-
ics. These features are implemented as functions added to the BasicX language. To use a
feature, you merely include it in your program, along with any necessary command
parameters. 
• GetADC and PutDAC. Recall from previously that the BX-24 has its own eight-channel,
10-bit ADC. With the GetADC function, you can read a voltage level on any of eight I/O
pins and correlate that voltage level with a binary number (from 0 to 1,023). Conversely,
you can use the PutDAC function to output a pulse train that will mimic a variable volt-
age.
• ShiftIn and ShiftOut. With ShiftIn you can receive a series of bits on a single I/O pin and
convert them to a single byte in a variable. ShiftOut does the inverse, where you can
convert a byte into a series of bits. Both functions allow you to specify an I/O pin for
use as the data source and another I/O pin for the clock. The BasicX software auto-
matically triggers the clock pin for each bit received or sent. 
• OpenCom. The BX-24 supports as many serial ports as you have available I/O pins.
With OpenCom you can establish serial communications with other BX-24 chips or any
other device that supports serial data transfer. One common use for OpenCom is to
establish a link from the BX-24 chip back to the download window of your PC; this win-
dow can serve as a terminal for debugging and other monitoring tasks.
• PulseIn and PulseOut. The PulseIn function waits for the level at a given I/O pin to
change state. One practical application of this feature is to watch for a critical button
press to activate some function on your robot. PulseOut sends a pulse of a certain
duration (in 1.085-microsecond units) out a given I/O pin. PulseOut is one of the most
commonly used functions, used to blink LEDs, trigger sonar pings, and command ser-
vomotors to move to a new location. 
• InputCapture. Somewhat akin to PulseIn, InputCapture watches for signal transition on
a specific I/O pin of the BX-24. InputCapture can time the duration of these transitions,
thereby giving you a “snapshot” of a digital pulse train, including how long each pulse
lasted. 
• PlaySound. The PlaySound function outputs a waveform that, when connected to an
amplifier via a decoupling capacitor, allows you to play previously sampled sound that
has been stored in the EEPROM. You can play back sounds at various sampling rates
and control the number of times the sound is repeated.

The OOPic Microcontroller
Taking an unusual approach to embedded hardware is the
OOPic, from Savage Innovations. This chip, which comes on
its own carrier/developer board, uses object-oriented pro-
gramming rather than the “procedural” programming found
in the Basic Stamp and similar products. The OOPic—which
is an acronym for “Object-Oriented Programmable
Integrated Circuit”—is said to be the first programmable
microcontroller that uses an object-oriented language. The
language used by the OOPic is modeled after Microsoft’s
popular Visual Basic. You don’t need Visual Basic on your
computer to use the OOPic; the OOPic programming environment is completely stand-
alone and available free.
The OOPic supports 31 input/output (I/O) lines, and with few exceptions, any of the
lines can serve as any kind of hardware interface—using what the OOPic documentation
calls “hardware objects,” which are digital I/O lines that can be addressed individually or
by nibble (4 bits), by byte (8 bits), or by word (16 bits). The OOPic also supports prede-
fined objects that serve as analog-to-digital conversion inputs, serial inputs/outputs,
pulse-width modulation outputs, timers/counters, radio-control (R/C) servo controllers,
and 4x4 matrix keypad inputs. The device can even be networked with other OOPics, as
well other components that support the Philips I2C network interface. 
The OOPic comes with a 4K EEPROM for program storage, but memory can be
expanded to 32K, which will hold some 32,000 instructions. The EEPROM is “hot swap-
pable,” meaning that you can change EEPRPOM chips even while the OOPic is on and
running. When a new EEPROM is inserted into the socket, the program stored in it is
immediately started. 
Additional connectors are provided on the OOPic for add-ins such as floating point
math, precision data acquisition, DTMF/modem/musical-tone generator, digital ther-
mometer, and even a voice synthesizer, currently under development. The OOPic’s hard-
ware interface is an open system; the I2C interface is published by Philips, allowing any IC
that uses the I2C interface to “talk” to the OOPic. 
While the hardware capabilities of the OOPic are attractive, its main benefit is what it
offers robot hackers: Much of the core functionality required for robot control is already
embedded in the chip. This will save you time in writing and testing your robot control
programs. Instead of several dozen lines of code to set up and operate an R/C servo, you
need about four lines when programming the OOPic.
A second important benefit is that the OOPic’s various hardware objects are multitask-
ing, which means they run independently of and concurrently with one another. You might
command a servo in your robot to go to a particular location. 
Though the OOPic is meant as a general-purpose microcontroller, many of its objects
are ideally suited for use with robotics. Of the built-in objects of the OOPic, the oA2D,
oDiox, oKeypad, oPWM, oSerial, and oServo objects are probably the most useful for
robotics work.
• Analog-to-Digital Conversion. The oA2D object converts a voltage present on an I/O
line and compares it to a reference voltage. It then generates a digital value, which rep-
resents the percentage of the voltage in relation to the reference voltage. There are
four physical analog-to-digital circuits implemented within the OOPic, available on I/O
lines 1 through 4.
• Digital I/O. Several digital I/O objects are provided in 1-bit, 4-bit, 8-bit, or 16-bit blocks.
In the case of the 1-bit I/O object (named oDio1), the Value property of the object repre-
sents the electrical state of a single I/O line. In the case of the remaining digital I/O

objects, the Value property presents the binary value of all the lines of the group (4, 8,
or 16, depending on the object used). There are 31 physical 1-bit I/O lines implemented
within the OOPic. The OOPic offers six physical 4-bit I/O groups; three 8-bit groups, and
one 16-bit group. 
• R/C Servo Control. The oServo object outputs a servo control pulse on any IO line. The
servo control pulse is tailored to control a standard radio-controlled (R/C) servo and is
capable of generating a logical high-going pulse from 0 to 3 ms in duration in 1/36-ms
increments. A typical servo requires a 5-volt pulse in the range of 1 to 2 ms in duration.
This allows for a rotational range of 180 degrees. 
• Keypad Input. The oKeypad object splits two sets of four I/O lines in order to read a
standard 4x4 keypad matrix. The four row lines are individually and sequentially set low
(0 volts), while the four column lines are used to read which switch is pressed within
that row. If any switch is pressed, the Value property of the oKeypad object is updated
with the value of the switch; a Received property is used to indicate that at least one
button of the keypad is pressed. Once all keys are released, the Received property is
cleared to 0.
• Pulse Width Modulation. The oPWM object provides a convenient pulse-width-modu-
lated (PWM) output, suitable for driving motors (through an appropriate external tran-
sistor output stage, of course). The oPWM object lets you specify the I/O line to use—
up to two at a time for PWM output—the cycle frequency, and the pulse width.
• Asynchronous Serial Port. The oSerial object transmits and receives data at a baud rate
specified by the Baud property. The baud rate can be either 1,200, 2,400, or 9,600
baud. The oSerial object is used to communicate with other serial devices, such as a
PC or a serial LCD display.
Several versions of the OOpic are available: the original OOPic (or OOPic I) and the
OOPic II. The OOPic II adds several features useful for robotics, including built-in support
for many popular sensors and motor controllers. These include:
• oCompassDN—Reads a Dinsmore compass (http://www.dinsmoresensors.com/)
• oLCDSE(T)—Set of objects that control Scott Edwards serial LCDs
(http://www.seetron.com/)
• oSonarPL—Reads a Polaroid 6500 sonar ranging module (http://www.polaroid-

• oSonarDV—Reads a Devantech (http://www.robot-electronics.co.uk/) SRF04 ultrasonic

• oTracker—Tracks the position of a line
• oUVTronHM—Reads a Hamamatsu UVTron flame detector

The Basic Stamp revolutionized amateur robotics, yet
the concept is simple: Take an 8-bit microcontroller,
normally intended to be programmed in assembly lan-
guage. Instead of requiring folks to learn assembly,
embed within the microcontroller a language inter-
preter, so that it can be programmed in a simpler lan-
guage, namely Basic. The Basic Stamp is a PICmicro
microcontroller with such a language interpreter. It
also includes additional basic components so that it is
completely self-contained, and runs just by applying
power to it. A voltage regulator, crystal, and additional
memory are mounted on the Basic Stamp chip, which is
the same size as a “fat” 24-pin integrated circuit. 
While the Basic Stamp is a main product for Parallax,
they recognize that robotics is a central area of interest,
so they also offer a number of robotcentric items,
including robot kits (GrowBot and BOE-Bot), various
sensor packages (line following, compass, etc.), and
development boards. They also team up with third-
party companies to offer integrated products, such as
RF modules, video cameras, LCD panels, and sound
modules.

FerretTronics is a developer of custom chips and soft-

Highlights of their product line include: 
• FT609-stepper motor controller. Using just a 2400-
baud serial communications link (from a computer
or microcontroller), you can control the step,
speed, direction, and acceleration of a stepper
motor. The chip lacks high-current capacity, so you
need to augment it with an H-bridge like the
L293D, a UDN2540 quad Darlington power driver
or other suitable transistor circuit. 
• FT639 -R/C servo controller. Also using a 2400-baud
serial line, this chip can control up to five R/C ser-
vos simultaneously (of course, you have full inde-
pendent control of each servo). You can precisely
control the position of the servo in 256 steps. 
• FT936-Sony infrared remote-control decoder. This
chip will decode the infrared signals from a Sony TV
remote and output the codes on five I/O lines. You
can use the FT936 to add remote-control capability
to your robot without having to write the decoding
software yourself. (And, by having the decoding
done off-board, your robot’s microcontroller can be
busy doing other important things.) The unit comes
with an infrared receiver module.

4 Ways to Control a DC Motor from a Computer
All of the following motor control techniques can be controlled by a computer or microcontroller.
• Relays. A single-pole, single-throw (SPST) relay can turn a motor on or off. A double-
pole, double-throw (DPDT) relay can reverse the direction of a motor. A variation is the
solid-state relay, which uses solid-state components (such as power MOSFETs,
described later) rather than electromechanical contacts.
• Bipolar transistors. A single bipolar transistor can be used to switch a motor on or off.
Four transistors, in an H-bridge arrangement, can be used to control the direction and
power to a motor. Two transistors in the bridge should be NPN types; the remaining
two, PNP types. Power transistors are needed for larger currents. Transistor arrays (ICs
that contain several transistors) can be used in place of discrete components.
• MOSFET transistors. Like bipolar transistors, MOSFETs can be used to either switch a
motor on or off or to control its direction. Four transistors are used in an H-bridge
arrangement to control direction and power to a motor. Two transistors should be the
N-channel type; the remaining two the P-channel type.
• H-bridge IC. H-bridge chips contain bipolar, MOSFET, or other types of transistors.
There are either four transistors in the chip that can be externally connected to form an
H-bridge, or the transistors are already internally connected in the H-bridge arrange-
ment. H-bridge ICs can control direction and power to a motor.
In each case, components must be selected to properly handle the current demand from
the motor. Damage to the component—as well as the computer or microcontroller con-
nected to it—can result if the motor draws excessive current. Heat sinks, which help dissi-
pate heat due to high current loads, are generally used with the preceding components
(except electromechanical relays).

Motor Bridge ICs
A motor bridge is an electronic circuit capable of controlling
the operation and direction of a motor. You can build a
motor bridge out of relays or transistors or purchase a spe-
cially made integrated circuit that does it all for you. Though
motor bridge ICs used to be quite expensive, they are rou-
tinely available in the $2 to $20 range, from a variety of
online and mail-order outlets.
Motor control bridges have two or more pins on them for
connection to control
electronics. Typical functions for the pins are:
• Motor enable. When enabled, the motor turns on. Some
bridges let the motor “float” when disabled, which causes the motor to stop. On other
bridges disabling the motor causes a full or partial short across the motor terminals,
which acts as a brake to stop the motor very quickly. By pulsing the enable pin using
pulse-width modulation (PWM), the H-bridge is able to change the speed of the motor.
• Direction. Setting the direction pin changes the direction of the motor.
• Brake. On bridges that allow the motor to float when the enable pin is disengaged, a
separate brake input is used to specifically control the braking action of the motor.
Better motor control bridges incorporate overcurrent protection circuitry to avoid dam-
age to themelves if the motor pulls too much current and overheats the chip.
Bridges using discrete
components, like this one, tend
to make much larger modules
than motor bridge ICs.

The Basics of Relays
Relays in your robot? Some robot builders blanch at the idea, considering relays to be
old-fashioned. Better to use all-electronic solutions, such as H-bridges or power transis-
tors. While modern electronics certainly has its place, so do older components. Circuits
can be built without resistors and capacitors, yet these components don’t suffer the
same ridicule as relays.
The truth is, in certain situations, the electromechanical relay may be the best and
cheapest solution. They’re not always the right solution, so like everything else in robots,
you need to weigh your choices. But, if you value your time, energy, and pocketbook, you
won’t automatically discount relays simply because they are old-fashioned.
How Relays Work
A relay is composed of two sections: an electromagnetic coil and a set of contacts.
These sections are electrically isolated, so that the coil is energized with one circuit, and
the contacts are used in another circuit.
When electricity (AC or DC) is applied to the coil, the contacts close or open, depend-
ing on their design. In most relays, when the electricity is removed from the coil, the con-
tacts return to their original state, because they are spring loaded. In some relays, the
contacts “latch,” and their position must be explicitly changed. Latching relays aren’t used
extensively in robotics, but they are in security systems and other applications where the
contacts must remain open even if power is removed from the coils.
The contacts of a relay are like a mechanical switch. There can be one set of contacts
or many. Each set of contacts is referred to as a pole. In addition, each pole can have
one or two positions. A single-position pole is either open or closed, but a double-position
pole has contacts for both open and closed. 
The pole and position nomenclature for relays is the same as it is for switches:
SPST
Single-pole, single-throw
The relay contacts are either open or closed
when energized. The normal condition (when
not energized) is indicated: NO, for normally
open, and NC, for normally closed.
SPDT
Single-pole, double-throw
The relay has a common and both NO and
NC contacts. This type of relay can be used
for NO or NC operation or both.
DPST
Double-pole, single-throw
Same as SPST, except a separate set of poles
is added for an additional circuit. For
example, the relay can control both a 5-volt
and a 12-volt circuit.
DPDT
Double-pole, double-throw
Two sets of poles, with NO and NC contacts
for each. 
Specialty relays have additional poles—3, 4, and even more poles—but these are sel-
dom used in amateur robotics. This type of relay tends to be physically large, as well.
Coil Voltage and Current Draw
The coil of the relay is energized by a control circuit. Coils are rated for a specific voltage.
Relay coils for 5 volts are ideal for use on robotics, because 5 volts is the common oper-
ating voltage of many computer circuits. This makes it easy to interface the relay to a
microcontroller or computer.
When energized, relay coils consume a certain amount of current. It is important to
note this current, not only because any current draw will discharge the batteries of your

robot, but also some relays may draw too much current from the control electronics con-
nected to it. The average 5-volt SPST relay may draw from 20 to 30 milliamps (mA). This
is no more than a brightly lit LED, but some microcontroller or computer I/O ports may not
be able to provide this much current. In such cases, you need to add a buffer, such as a
TTL gate or a small signal transistor, to increase the current-handling capacity.
The basic approach for connectiing an I/O port to a relay through a transistor is available
in most any book on beginning electronics. Common in most such circuits is a resistor,
from 1.0K to 4.7K at the base of the transistor. Start with a high value and work down;
you've picked the right resistor value when the relay engages when you activate the I/O
port. A diode is also used across the terminals of the coil. This is important because when
the relay turns off, a rush of current will flow back through the coil and possibly into the
transistor. The diode prevents damage to your electronics.
Contact Amperage
The contacts of the relay are rated for the current they can carry. The rating is typically
specified as amps at a particular voltage, usually 250 VAC volts or 30 VDC. Forgetting the
voltage specification, you need to ensure that the contacts will handle the current you
wish to pass through the relay. If you are using the relay to control motors that draw
upward of 3 amps each, then the relay contacts must be able to handle no less than
three amps.
There is generally no need to overspecify the amperage-handling capacity of the relay,
unless you notice the contacts are “sticking” (they don’t release when you deenergize the
coil), if there is a nasty spark when the contacts are disengaged, or if the relay becomes
noticably hot.
Relay Case Styles
Relays designed for heavy-duty use, controlling several amps of current, are more likely
to be the big, gompy, and ugly things your mother warned you against. Many are
enclosed in clear plastic so you can see the innards of the relay in all its glory. There’s no
reason to you can’t cover or paint the plastic to “dress up” the relay, but just don’t use
any material that’s flammable.
Relays for smaller loads are smaller—some no bigger than an integrated circuit
mounted on a socket. These types of relays are popular for controlling lighter loads, like
small motors or LED lamp clusters. The small relay variety may be electromechanical—
equipped with a coil and spring-loaded contacts—or it may be the reed type. Reed relays
use a much simpler construction: A coil is wrapped around two pieces of metal enclosed
in a glass ampoule. When the coil is energized, the metal pieces are drawn toward (or
away, in the NC style) from one another.

motor control 379
Pros and Cons of Relays
First, let’s look at some advantages of using relays.
• Relays can offer a size advantage on systems that require heavy heat sinking for power
electronics. A relay with 10-amp contacts may be only 3/4 inch square, but a heat sink
for a 10-amp power MOSFET can be many times that.
• Relays don’t require adapting to ensure proper operation in the circuit. Many transistor-
based power circuits require you to determine the characteristics.
• Relays are relatively inexpensive, so if you wreck one while experimenting, replacing it
won’t set you back as much. Replacing an all-electronic control can be quite costly.
Now for a few of the more salient disadvantages:
• Relays for very high current (25 or 50 amps and above) can be big, loud, and heavy.
All-electronic controls—the solid-state relay or the power MOSFET—become the better
choice for robotic applications.
• Relays wear out over time, though the number of switches is in the tens or hundreds of
thousands. When used within their design limits, electronic controls never wear out and
can be expected to last years, trouble free.
• Some applications, like pulse-width modulation of motors, cannot be accomplished with
relays. An electronic motor control solution is required in these instances.

Outside-of-the-Box
Many products have obvious uses: a machine screw is
meant to fasten two or more pieces together. But some-
times, looks can be deceiving, and items that appear to
be useful for a narrow application can be adapted to
serve other purposes. This is called “outside-of-the-box”
thinking, where you take something meant for one job
and give it a completely different job to do.

How Fast Can Your Robot Move?
If you know how fast the wheels of your robot turn, you can calculate the speed, in inches
per second, that your robot will move. Making the calculation is easy:
1. Divide the speed of the robot, in revolutions per minute (rpm) by 60. The result is the
revolutions of the motor per second (rps). A 100-rpm motor runs at 1.66 rps. 
2. Multiply the diameter of the drive wheel by pi, which is approximately 3.14. This yields
the circumference of the wheel. A 7-inch wheel has a circumference of about 21.98
inches.
3. Multiply the speed of the motor (in rps) by the circumference of the wheel. The result
is the number of linear inches covered by the wheel in one second. 
With a 100-rpm motor and 7-inch wheel, the robot will travel at a top speed of 35.168
inches per second, or just under 3 feet per second.
You can adjust the traveling speed of your robot by altering the diameter of its wheels.
By reducing the diameter of the wheel by half, you reduce the traveling speed of the
robot by half.
Bear in mind that the actual travel speed, once the robot is all put together, may be
lower than this. The heavier the robot, the larger the load on the motors, so the slower
they will turn.

G Power Transmission
“Power transmission” is anything that transfers power
or movement from one device to another. This category
is quite large and encompasses gears, belts, chains,
bearings, bushing, shafts, collars, retaining clips, ball
bearings, and other components used in moving mech-
anisms.
Many sources for power transmission components also
sell other materials of practical application for robots.
Be sure to review all of the offerings of a given source as
they may also provide something else you’ve been look-
ing for.
It’s not uncommon for sellers of power transmission
components to provide you with lots of technical detail
but no prices! This is common in the industrial supply
business, where finding just the right part is more criti-
cal than pricing. As amateur roboticists are typically
long on dreams and short on cash, you’ll want to specif-
ically ask for a pricing sheet so you can compare costs.
The outfits that require you to speak with a sales repre-
sentative for every price you want are probably not
worth the effort. Skip to the next source.

Commonly Used Power Transmission Components
There are literally thousands of power transmission components, but the following com-
prise the most commonly used and the most critical.
Gears
Gears are a principle component of power transmission and
are primarily used in robotics to reduce the speed and
increase the torque of the wheel drive motors. Because of
the mechanical precision required to properly mesh gears,
most amateur robot builders do not construct their own
gear assemblies. Gears are more fully detailed elsewhere in
these sections.
Timing Belts
Also called synchronization belts. Typical timing belts for
small mechanisms range from 1/8 to 5/18 inch in width and
sizes from just a few inches to several feet in diameter.
Material is usually neoprene, with metal or fiberglass rein-
forcement. Belts are rated by the pitch between “nubs” or
“cogs,” which are located on the inside of the belt. Timing
belts are used with matching timing belt pulleys, which
come with either ball bearing shafts (used for idler wheels)
or with press-on or set screw shafts for attaching to motors
and other devices.
V-belts
V-belts have a tapered V shape and are used to transfer motion and power from a motor
to an output when synchronization of that motion is not critical (because the belt could
slip). V-belts, which are often made with metal- or fiberglass-reinforced rubber, are used
with V-grooved pulleys. By changing the diameter of the pulleys, it’s possible to alter the
speed and torque of the output shaft in relation to the drive shaft. The same physics that
apply to gears and gear sizes apply to V-belt pulleys as well.
Endless Round Belts
Endless round belts are used to transfer low-torque motion. The belts look like overgrown
O-rings and, in fact, are often manufactured in the same manner. Other endless round
belts are made by fusing the ends of rounded rubber (usually neoprene). Some belt mak-
ers provide splicing kits so you can make custom belts of any length. Grooved pulleys are
used with round belts; as with V-belt pulleys, the diameter of the round belt pulley can be
altered to change the torque and speed of the output.
Ladder Chain
Ladder chain resembles the links of a ladder and is used for fairly low torque and slow
speed operations. Movement of a robotic arm or shoulder is a good application for ladder
chain. With most chain, links can be removed and added using a pair of pliers. Special
toothed sprockets, engineered to match the pitch (distance from link to link) of the chain
is used.
Timing belts (or synchronization
belts) use cogged belts and
sprockets.
Spur gears.

Roller Chain
Roller chain is exactly the same kind as for bicycles, except
for most small-scale machinery, the chain isn’t as big. Roller
chain is available in miniature sizes, down to 0.1227-inch
pitch (distance between links). More common is the #25
roller chain, which has 0.250-inch pitch. For reference, most
bicycle chain is #50, or 0.50-inch pitch. Sprockets with
matching pitches are used on the drive and driven compo-
nents. Roller chain comes in metal or plastic; plastic chain is easier to work with and links
can be added or removed. Many types of metal chains are prefabricated using hydraulic
presses and require the use of “master links” to make a loop.
Idlers
Idlers (also called idler pulleys or idler wheels) take up slack in belt- and chain-driven
mechanisms. The idler is placed along the length of the belt or chain and is positioned so
that any slack is pulled away from the belt or chain loop. Not only does this allow more
latitude in design, it also quiets the mechanism. The bores of the idlers are fitted with
appropriate bearings or bushings.
Couplers
Couplers come in two styles
• Rigid
• Flexible
Couplers are used to directly connect two shafts
together, thus obviating the need for any kind of gear or
belt. Rigid and flexible couplers are detailed more fully in these sections.
Bearings
Bearings are used to reduce the friction of
a spinning component, such as a wheel or
idler, around a shaft. Several bearing con-
structions exist, with ball bearings being
the most common. The bearing is com-
posed of two concentric rings; between
each ring is a row of ball bearings. The
rings—and the ball bearings—are held in place by a mechanical flange of some type.
Bearings can be mounted directly to a device, which requires precision machining and a
press to securely insert the bearing into place. 
Another form of bearing uses narrow pieces of metal rod, called needles, and works in
a similar manner.
Pillow blocks are available that allow bearings to be readily mounted on any frame or
device.
Bushings
Bushings and bearings serve the same general purpose, except a bushing has no moving
parts. (Note: Some people also call these bearings or dry bearings, but I prefer to use the
term bushing in order to differentiate them.) The bushing is made of metal or plastic and
is engineered to be “self-lubricating.”

An example is Oilite, a self-lubricated bronze metal com-
monly found in industrial bushings. Several kinds of plastics,
including Teflon, exhibit a self-lubricating property. Bushings
are used instead of bearings to reduce cost, size, and
weight and are adequate when friction between the moving
parts can be kept relatively low. Bushings, and not the more
expensive bearings, are used in the output gear of the less
expensive R/C servos, for example.

exchange for spending a lot less money, you must give
up the ability to specify an exact size of belt you need.
However, in many cases, standard-sized belts available

Getting Geared Up
Of course, you can always buy gears from Gears R Us. (Okay, most go by far more mun-
dane names like Boston Gear, Small Parts, W. M. Berg, and Stock Drive.) You’ll get just
what you’re looking for from these sources, but it’ll cost you. The average machined 1-
inch-diameter aluminum gear can cost between $20 and $30.
As long as your requirements aren’t too unusual, you may be able to locate the gears
you want from other products and sources. 
• Toy construction sets. Don’t laugh! Toys like LEGO, Erector, and Inventa come with
gears you can use in your robotics projects. Most are on the large size and are made
of plastic.
• Hobby and specialty retailers. Next time you’re at the hobby store look for replacement
gear sets for servos and drive motors for R/C cars and airplanes. Some are plastic;
others are metal (usually either aluminum or brass). Typically, you’ll have to buy the
whole set of replacement gears for whatever motor or servo the set is for, but in other
cases you can purchase just one gear at a time. Some online retailers, such as
ServoCity.com and Jameco.com, sell gears specifically for hobby applications (like
robots). The price is reasonable.
• Surplus catalogs. New gears can be expensive; surplus gears can be quite affordable.
You can often find new gears, plastic or metal, for about 10 cents on the dollar, com-
pared to the cost of the same gear new. The only problem: Selection can be limited,
and it can be hard to match gear sizes and pitches even when buying gears from the
same outlet.
• Rechargeable electric screwdrivers. Inside are numerous gears, typically in a “plane-
tary” configuration, used to produce their very high speed reductions. Before raiding
the screwdriver for just its gears, consider using the motor, too. The motor and gearing
system of a typical electric screwdriver makes for a fine robot drive system.
• Hacked toys. Discarded and discounted toys make for good gear sources. These
include friction and battery-powered toy cars, “‘dozer” toys, even some action figures.
Tear the toy apart for the treasure inside. These gears tend to be small and made of
plastic.
• Old kitchen appliances. Go to thrift stores and garage sales and look for old food mix-
ers, electric knives, even electric can openers. Unlike toys, kitchen appliances com-
monly use metal gears—or, at the least, very strong plastic gears.

Lovejoy manufactures a line of affordable flexible cou-
plers. These are designed to connect a motor drive with
some driven device, like a pump or a wheel. Because
they are flexible, the coupler allows the shafts of the
driver and the drivee to be slightly out of whack from
one another, and yet they won’t tear each other apart. 
One of the more common Lovejoy connectors in use
for robotics is the jaw coupling, which consists of two
machine halves that fit together with “fingers.” A flexi-
ble material, called the spider, is sandwiched between.
There are two benefits of jaw connectors: Halves in the
same series can be mixed and matched, so the shaft
sizes can be different for each side. The spider material
is available from soft to fairly rigid, to better suit the
application.

Understanding Gears
Gears are used for two purposes:
• To transfer power or motion from one mechanism to another.
• To reduce or increase the speed of the motion between two linked mechanisms.
The simplest gear systems use just two gears: a drive gear and a driven (or output)
gear. More sophisticated gear systems, referred to as gear trains, gearboxes, or trans-
missions, may contain dozens or even hundreds of gears. Motors with attached gear-
boxes are said to be gearbox motors.
Gear Teeth
Gears are specified not only by their physical size, but also
by the number of teeth around the circumference. Spur
gears are most common and are used when the drive and
driven shafts are parallel. Bevel gears have teeth on the
surface of the circle, rather than the edge. They are used to
transmit power to perpendicular shafts. Miter gears serve a
similar function but are designed so that no reduction takes
place.
Spur, bevel, and miter gears are reversible—the gear train
can be turned from either the drive or the driven end.
Conversely, worm and leadscrew gears transmit power per-
pendicularly and are not usually reversible The leadscrew
resembles a threaded rod. 
Rack gears are like spur gears unrolled into a flat rod. They are primarily intended to
transmit rotational motion to linear motion.
Gear Reduction = Torque Increase
When gears are used to reduce the output speed of a mechanism—say, a motor—the
torque at the output is increased. Gears are basically a form of lever; power can be
increased by changing the ratio of the lever over the fulcrum. Substituting the fulcrum in a
gear system is the number of teeth on each gear. 
Gear reduction is accomplished by changing the ratio of teeth of mating gears: A two-
gear system with a 100-tooth gear and a 50-tooth gear is said to have a 2:1 reduction. With
such a system, output speed is reduced by 50 percent, and torque is roughly doubled.
The teeth of a gear provides
mechanical traction.

Common Gear Specifications
Here are some common gear specifications to keep you warm at night.
• Pitch. The size of gear teeth is expressed as pitch, which is roughly calculated by
counting the number of teeth on the gear and dividing it by the diameter of the gear.
Common pitches are 12 (large), 24, 32, 48, and 64. Odd-size pitches exist, of course,
as do metric sizes.
• Pressure angle. The degree of slope of the face of each tooth is called the pressure
angle. The most common pressure angle is 20 degrees, although some gears, particu-
larly high-quality worms and racks, have a 14 1/2-degree pressure angle.
• Tooth geometry. The orientation of the teeth on the gear can differ. The teeth on most
spur gears are perpendicular to the edges of the gear. But the teeth can also be
angled, in which case it is called a helical gear. There are a number of other unusual
tooth geometries in use, including double-teeth and herringbone.

Flexible Linkages
Flexible linkages allow mechanical power or movement to be transferred from one place
to another using some form of bendable material. Examples are as follows:
• Pulleys and belts. Pulleys are like wheels, and the belts ride over the wheels. Most pul-
leys incorporate a sleeve or rim to keep the belt in place.
• Sprockets and chain. Sprockets are also wheels, but incorporate teeth around their cir-
cumference in order to mesh with a chain. 
• Cable. A flexible cable, made of plastic or metal, transfers power/movement by spin-
ning within some protective sheath. The speedometer cable on older-model cars is a
good example of how these work.
Except for cable, flexible linkages can function in a similar manner to gears, including
reducing or increasing speed and torque. This is accomplished by using different
sprocket or pulley diameters.
A benefit of using pulleys/belts or sprockets/chain is you needn’t be so concerned with
absolute alignment of the mechanical parts of your robot. When using gears it is neces-
sary to mount them with high precision.

Rigid and Flexible Couplers
Couplers are used to connect two drive shafts. A common application is to use a coupler
to connect the drive shaft of a motor with the axle of a wheel. Connectors can be rigid or
flexible. Rigid couplers are best used when the torque of the motor is low, as it would be
in a small tabletop robot. Flexible couplers are advised for higher torque applications, as
they are more “forgiving” of errors in alignment.
Rigid couplers can be made using metal or plastic tubing, selected for its inside diame-
ter. You can purchase suitable tubing at a hobby or hardware store. Cut the tubing to
length, then drill two small holes at both ends for setscrews. Use a tap to thread the hole
for the size of setscrews you wish to use—4/40 is a good all-around size for most appli-
cations.
Steel tubing provides the most strength, but is harder to cut, drill, and tap. If the thick-
ness of the tubing is sufficient, aluminum will work well for most low-torque applications.
Brass and bronze should be avoided because these metals are too soft. For very low-
torque jobs, plastic or even rubber tubing will work. Select the rubber tubing so that it is
just slightly smaller than the motor shaft and axle you are using, and press it on for a
good fit.
There are many types of commercially available rigid and
flexible couplers, and cost varies from under a dollar to well
over $50, depending on materials and sizes. Common flexi-
ble couplers include helical, universal joint (similar to the U-
joint in the drive shafts in older cars), and three-piece jaw.
The couplers attach to the shafts either with a press fit, by a
clamping action, by setscrews, or by a keyway. Press fit and
clamp are common on smaller couplers for low-torque
applications; setscrews and keyways are used on larger
couplers.
Three-piece jaw couplers, like those made by Lovejoy,
consist of two metal or plastic pieces that fit over the shafts.
These are the “jaws.” A third piece, the spider, fits between
the jaws and acts as a flexible cushion. One advantage of three-piece couplers is that,
because each piece of the jaw is sold separately, you can readily “mix and match” shaft
sizes. For example, you can purchase one jaw for a 1/4-inch shaft and another for a 3/8-
inch shaft. Both jaws must have the same outside diameter.
A three-piece jaw coupler.

you’re building your robot. Now, the stuff W. M. Berg
sells isn’t cheap. You pay for the quality and for getting
exactly what you want (instead of trying to make do
with something you found surplus). Product is available

Movers and Shakers
Joseph F. Engelberger
Joseph Engelberger is widely considered the “father
of modern robotics,” having begun (with inventor
George Devol) the first robot company (Unimation)
in 1960. Just a few years later, Unimation’s “Unimate”
robots were installed at General Motors and were
busy churning out parts for cars. Today, robots are
found in just about every car manufacturing factory
in the world. Without robots, your car would be
more expensive and less reliable.

Enigma sells a unique real-world simulation program
for developing drive trains for coaxially driven (wheel
on either side) robots, especially larger robots for com-
bat. You enter the technical details of the motor and
the details of your robot design, including gear ratios,
tire diameters, motor voltage and capacity, and weight.
The program then simulates how the robot will per-
form given the motor you’ve selected. 
The technical specs of common motors are already in
the program’s database, and you can edit those figures
if neededor create new entries. The program simulates
battery voltage, state of charge, and internal resistance,
as well as over- and under-volting of the motor (e.g., the
performance of motor driven at 12 volts, but whose
faceplate rating is 19 volts). 
Another unique aspect is the database includes the
approximate price and sources for the motors.

Autonomous versus Teleoperated Robots
Autonomous robots are those that act upon their own con-
trol. They consist of the following systems:
• Sensors to monitor the environment
• Some form of processor or computer
• Actuators to move wheels, arms, or other mechanisms
The processor or computer runs a program whose aim is
some goal for the robot. That goal might be waxing the
open areas of the floor in a large warehouse, for instance.
The program also includes alternative actions for the robot
to perform should an obstacle stand in the way of complet-
ing the goal. Such obstacles include objects in the robot’s way, low battery power, or
mechanical breakdown.
A teleoperated robot is one that is commanded by a human and operated by remote
control. The robot may be in physical sight of its human controller, like the combat robots in
BattleBots and similar competitions, or it may be linked via camera, such as police robots
that are used to defuse bombs. Of the three systems in an autonomous robot, the telerobot
lacks the first two, as sensing and computing are handled by the human operator.
Some telerobots, like the world famous Mars Pathfinder Sojourner, the first interplane-
tary dune buggy, are actually half remote controlled and half autonomous. A growing
number of telerobots fit into this category. The low-level functions of the robot are han-
dled by a microprocessor on the machine. The robot is able to carry out basic instructions
on its own, freeing the human operator from having to control every small aspect of the
machine’s behavior.

Model Railroading
At a time when amateur robot builders were constructing their automatons with tubs and
relays, model railroaders were experimenting with electronic speed controls, touch sen-
sors, miniature motorized armatures, and much more. Even if you’re not into model rail-
roading, our track-centric brethren can show the robot builder a thing or two about
electromechanical construction and control. They even have plenty of specialized goodies
that just beg to be used in robots.
Modern model railroading is centered around the DCC—Digital Command Control—a
worldwide standard that permits multiple locomotive engines and other devices to be
individually controlled via a signal passed through the metal tracks of the model. In the
“old days,” each engine was controlled simply by varying the voltage on the track, so
there could only be one engine per track (or track segment) at one time. With DCC,
the track uses a centralized command center, and each locomotive is equipped with a
DCC decoder. Each decoder “listens” to the command signals meant for it and ignores
any others.
What’s more, the power for the locomotive engine also comes from the track, just as it
always has for most kinds of model railroads. The difference is that instead of controlling
the motor in the locomotive directly by varying the voltage to the track, the DCC decoder
controls the motor if, and only if, it receives a digital signal from the command center to
do so.
It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that DCC is also handy for robotics. A
DCC command center and decoders could be used to not only transmit power (12-14
volts AC) to different parts of a robot, but to control it as well. Or, if you outfit a robot
arena with a metal floor and metal mesh on top, you could construct an army of semiau-
tonomous robots that don’t carry their own power supply—the whole thing would work
along the same lines as bumper cars at carnivals.
DCC setups can be a tad expensive, though there are still bargains; so be on the
lookout for them. The basic unit controls just the on/off and direction of a motor.
That’s perfectly fine for most robotic application. Advanced DCC command centers
can control a half dozen or more locomotives, along with “extras” such as lamps
and whistles.
Higher-end setups even offer a wireless command center, so you can control your
robot from anywhere in the room, and others can be controlled by the RS-232 port of a
personal computer. Because many of the basic functions of a DCC decoder can be pre-
programmed—such as motor speed and acceleration rates— when you operate your
robot through the command center (or the PC), you need not manipulate every little
nuance of the robot’s operation.
Of course, there’s more to model railroading than just DCC, and a surprising amount of
it can be applied to robotics, as well:
• Construction materials, including lightweight plastics, rubber and plastic castings, and
spray foam.
• Drive motors, often in unusual shapes and arrangements, for locomotives. These are
very high quality with great efficiency in a miniature scale. Many come with gearboxes
attached or can be readily attached to a gearbox.
• Mechanicals, trellis, crossing arms, etc.

Radio-Control Model Hobby Parts and Components
When you think about it, a small mobile robot is not much different from a radio control
model car, boat, or airplane—except that its activity is largely controlled by a computer,
rather than remotely by a human being. The mechanical aspects of the robot share many
of the same parts and components as radio controlled (R/C) models. Because R/C mod-
eling is such a popular hobby, practiced all over the world, a vast array of products are
widely available at affordable prices.
Transmitter and Receiver
The centerpiece of the typical R/C model is the radio control transmitter. In a fully
autonomous robot, the transmitter is not used because the automaton is controlled by an
electronic circuit of some type (exception: when the robot is equipped with a wired or
wireless remote control, so it can be operated by a human).
Transmitters are complemented by receivers in the vehicles (or in our case, the
robots). The transmitter and receiver operate over radio frequency waves and are on a
very specific frequency. Most hobby R/C models use a transmitter/receiver capable of at
least two functions, or channels. In the case of a model car, for example, one channel
might be for speed and another for steering. Additional channels are used for other func-
tions, such as direction.
For hobby R/C, there are two general types of transmitters: air and land. Depending on
the country of use, there are various restrictions for both kinds, and the transmitters
operate at different frequencies to avoid interference. Because robots are land-based
vehicles, you should use only a transmitter meant for land applications. This helps avoid
potential interference, where your robot experiments may cause the crash of a nearby
model airplane.
The transmitter/receiver pair is crystal controlled and operates on a specific frequency
(often referred to as a “channel,” but this kind of channel should not be confused with the
various function channels—that is, speed or steering—supported by the transmitter). If
you plan on using your robot in a competition, with other remotely controlled machines,
you may need to change the operating frequency of the transmitter and receiver to avoid
conflicts with other entrants.
You can often save some money by purchasing a starter kit that includes a transmitter
and matching receiver, as well as one or more servos. You can then add to it with addi-
tional servos or alternative frequency crystals and other goodies.
A few final words about R/C transmitters and receivers: Don’t be lulled into thinking you
need lots and lots of channels (that is, channels for functions like speed and steering). A
three- or four-channel transmitter is probably more than sufficient.
Among the highest priced transmitters are those that
employ FM-PCM (pulse code modulation) circuitry. For the
most part, it’s money wasted on a mobile robot; PCM is ideal
for fine-control applications for model airplanes and helicop-
ters. Land-based robotics can make do with the “older-fash-
ioned,” but still quite capable, FM-PPM (pulse position mod-
ulation) or the even less expensive AM circuitry. 
R/C Servos
An R/C servo is a motor that always knows “where it is.”
The output of the motor is meant to connect some part of
the model, like the steering wheels of a car or the rudder of
Model R/C servos are great for
motorizing robots.

an airplane. Obviously, the positioning of these parts needs to be precise, and electronics
inside the servo provide for that.
More about servos throughout this section.
Rechargeable Battery Packs
R/C applications are power hungry, and rechargeable battery packs are the norm. The
battery packs are available at several voltages and current capacities. Common voltages
are as follows:
4.8-volt
7.2-volt
9.6-volt
The 7.2-volt packs are perhaps the most useful for robotics. Note the “unusual” volt-
ages; these are the result of the 1.2-volts-per-cell batteries used in the packs. Current
capacities range from about 350 milliamp-hours (mAh) to over 1,500 mAh. The higher the
current capacity, the longer the battery can provide juice to your robot. Unfortunately,
higher capacity batteries also tend to be larger and heavier. You should always pick the
current capacity based on the estimated needs of your robot, rather than just selecting
the biggest brute of a battery that you can find.
There are two general types of batteries used in rechargeable packs: nickel-cadmium (ni-
cad) or nickel metal hydride (NiMH). Both can be recharged many times, but of the two, ni-
cad batteries are the least expensive because they’ve been around the longest. NiMH bat-
teries provide for high current capacities, with ratings of 600 to 3,000 mAh and over.
There are other advantages to NiMH batteries. For years, users have complained
about the “memory effect” of ni-cad cells (though ni-cad battery makers say this problem
has long been corrected). The memory effect is simply this: If a ni-cad battery is
recharged before being completely discharged, it may “remember” this shortened current
capacity. The next time the battery is used, it may not last as long as it should before
needing a recharge.
Additionally, ni-cad batteries contain cadmium, a highly toxic metal. Ni-cad batteries
can be bad for the environment, because the cadmium in them can leach out and filter
down to the water table and into underground streams or rivers. Exposure to cadmium is
known to cause everything from flu-like symptoms to kidney failure to cancers of the lung
and prostate. As a result, ni-cad batteries should never just be thrown away in the trash,
but properly recycled or disposed in a hazardous waste facility.
Both ni-cad and NiMH battery packs require rechargers specially designed for them.
The better battery rechargers work with a variety of pack voltages.
Wheels and Tires
The local hobby store provides a gamut of wheels and tires of all sizes for your robot, as
well as mounting hardware.
Drive Wheels
Wheels for model radio controlled planes are ideally suited for the main drive of mobile
robots, as they are both strong and lightweight. The wheels, which typically have a metal
or plastic hub drilled out for a 1/8-inch-diameter axle shaft, are available in sizes from 1.5
to over 6 inches in diameter. 
You can chose between rubber and foam tires; rubber tires come with or without
treads and tend to be heavier and sturdier. They are ideal for robots weighing over one
pound. Foam wheels are lighter and in many cases cheaper, but heavier robots may
cause the wheels to deform if used on a heavy robot.

radio control 425
Tires are used on model cars and are generally smaller
than the wheels for R/C airplanes. This doesn’t mean they
are less expensive; on the contrary, tires for R/C cars can
cost $30 to $50 each, though most are under $15 per pair.
Hubs are plastic or metal. The main benefit of R/C car tires
is the traction they can provide. A wide rubber tire affords
considerable traction on all kinds of surfaces. Robots des-
tined for use outdoors, or in sumo-style robot competitions,
benefit from this extra traction.
Tailwheel
Tailwheels are the “third wheel” for when a plane is on the
ground. Because tailwheels spin and rotate around a center
column, they are perfectly suited for use as support casters in coaxial-drive robots.
Tailwheels are made to match certain scales of model airplanes, and the rubber wheels
come in sizes from 3/4 to 2 inches. The wheel is mounted on a prebent metal post, and
the post fits into a holder which attaches to the robot (see the following figure). The
height of the tailwheel can be adjusted in its holder to accommodate a variety of robot
designs.
Dura-Collars
Though used for many applications, Dura-Collars are typically employed to keep R/C
wheels on their axle shafts. The collar is made of plated metal and is drilled for a
setscrew. You use a hex wrench to tighten the collar around the axle shaft. Dura-Collars
come in a variety of sizes; you match collar to the diameter of the axle shaft. Common
sizes are 1/16 inch (1.5mm) to 3/16 inch (4.7mm). 
Pushrods, Cables, and Linkages
Less used in amateur robotics, but still very useful, is the pushrod, which is basically a
piece of heavy, thick metal. More often than not, the pushrod is threaded on one end, so
that it firmly connects into a clevis, swivel ball, or other linkage fitting. The other end of the
pushrod is bent to make a hook and is attached to the servo by way of a servo horn (see
the following section for more information on servo horns). 
You can use pushrods in robotic designs that require you to transfer linear motion from
one point to another, such as an arm or finger grippers. This allows you to place the
heavy and bulky servo in the base of the arm.
You must match the size of the pushrod and the clevis. You can chose from plastic or
metal clevises; the metal variety can be either screw-on or solderable. The screw-on type
is definitely easier to work with, but requires threaded pushrod, and this adds to the
expense.
Flexible cables, with and without an outer plastic sheathing, are used in much the same
way as pushrods, but are useful when the linkage cannot be rigid.
Servo Horns and Bellcranks
Servo horns fit onto the shafts of R/C servos and are most often used to convert the rota-
tional movement of the servo to a linear movement. In a model airplane, for example, this
linear movement might be to move the ailerons up and down. Servo horns come in a vari-
ety of shapes and sizes; it’s best to simply take a look at what’s available and chose the
kind you think will work best. You need to get servo horns for your make and model of
servo, because the mounting holes vary in size.
Foam wheels are both
inexpensive and lightweight.

By the way, there’s also plain ol’ control horns, which are not for attaching to the output
shafts of servos. Control horns are most often used on the other end of the mechanical
linkage from the servo—you’d use a control horn on the surface of an aileron. 
Bellcranks are similar to control horns and serve as levers. They are often used to
enlarge or reduce the amount of linear movement.
Miscellaneous R/C Hardware
It’s not possible to describe every piece of hardware available for R/C modeling, but
here’s a quick rundown of some of the more useful components.
• Control hinges. Plastic or metal hinges with mounting holes. In a variety of sizes. For
robotics, go for the best you can get, so the hinge doesn’t fall apart from extra wear.
• Bolt/nut/screw hardware. In a variety of sizes, from tiny 2/56 threads to standard 6/32
and 8/32 threads. Look for blind nuts, which let you mount things like servos and
motors flush to the body of the robot. Blind nuts need soft plastic, wood, or similar
materials (but not metal or “hard” plastic like acrylics). The “fins” of the nut must be
able to dig into the material to provide a secure fit.
• Threaded inserts. Also used with softer materials, they screw into the material to create
a standard-size threaded hole. 
• Servo tape. Wide and supersticky tape for holding servos, batteries, and other objects
to the frame of a robot. 
• Hex-socket-head screws. Precision machined with threads from 2/56 through 6/32.
Has hex-socket head, sometimes with a knurled knob to allow for easier manual tight-
ening. 
• Threaded couplers. Extend the length of threaded rods by allowing them to be con-
nected together.
• Replacement servo gears. Though intended to repair broken or worn-out servos, these
gearsets can also be used for any other purpose you choose. Replacement gears may
be plastic or metal, depending on the make and model of servo they are for.

Review of Seven Serial Servo Controllers
Servo controllers operate multiple radio control servos from a single serial line. The benefit
of servo controllers in robotics is obvious: Rather than devote the majority (or all) of a
robot’s controller to servo functions, this task is handed off to a “coprocessor” that does
all the work.
In operation, the robot’s computer or microcontroller sends a short set of instructions
to the serial controller, telling it which servos to operate and where to move them. These
instructions are sent through a simple one- or two-wire serial connection. In the typical
two-wire connection, one line is used for the actual data, and the other line is used as a
synchronizing clock. Even those microcontrollers that lack true serial communications
capability can use the two-wire approach by applying what’s known as “bit banging”—
sending data to a pin one bit at a time.
There are a number of serial servo controllers on the
market. Here’s a quick rundown on several of the most
popular ones.
Mini-SSC (Scott Edwards Electronics)
http://www.seetron.com/
The Mini-SSC set the stage for the other servo controllers
that followed, and as a result, many products are functional
duplicates of this one. The Mini-SSC connects to a serial
communications port at 9,600 bps or 2,400 bps and con-
trols up to eight standard hobby servos at one time. It’s
possible to link several Mini-SSC boards in parallel and
therefore control even more servos.
SV203 (Pontech)
http://www.pontech.com/
The Pontech SV203 series of serial servo controllers oper-
ates up to eight standard servos at speeds of 2,400, 4,800,
9,600, or 19,200 bps. Like the Mini-SSC, each board can be
assigned a different “address,” and therefore you can con-
trol multiple banks of eight servos. The SV203B/C boards
also feature infrared, digital I/O, and onboard program
memory, allowing them to be used in stand-alone mode,
with a controller or computer.
Servo 8T (Web-Hobbies.com/NetMedia)
http://www.web-hobbies.com/
The Servo 8T controls up to eight servos, and eight units
can be daisy-chained to control up to 256 servos. The
Servo 8T supports serial speeds up to 19,200 bps. What
sets this controller apart from the others is that it incorpo-
rates force feedback for each servo. This information is
communicated back to the computer or microcontroller and
can be used to moderate the position of the servo.

offers another product, the FT649, that can control five FT639 servo controllers (for a
total of 25 servos, which is usually more than enough for anybody).
ASC16 (Medonis Engineering)

http://www.ohmark.co.nz/
The Ohmark DSC controls up to eight servos and can be daisy-chained to operate up to
32 servos using the stock product. In addition to being able to set the position of the
servo, the DSC can control the “rate” or speed of the servo movement (this is a unique
and great feature) and can disable individual servos so that they do not consume power.

Inside an R/C Servo
The typical R/C servo comprises three major parts:
• Motor. The motor is a small DC-operated permanent
magnet unit, capable of reversing direction.
• Reduction gear. The high-speed output of the motor is
reduced by a gearing system. Many revolutions of the
motor equal one revolution of the output shaft of the
servo. In most servos, the output shaft turns no more
than 90 degrees in either direction.
• Control circuit. The output shaft is connected to a potentiometer, a common electronic
device very similar to the volume control on a radio. The potentiometer (or “pot”) con-
nects with a control circuit, and the position of the pot naturally indicates the position of
the output shaft.
In a radio-control application, the receiver—mounted someplace in the vehicle—both
powers and controls the servo. The control signal for the servo is in the form of a series
of pulses. The duration of the pulses is what determines the desired position of the servo. 
Specifically, the servo is set at its center point if the duration of the control pulse is 1.5
millisecond (one-thousandth of a second). Durations longer or shorter command the
servo to turn in one direction or the other. A duration of 1.0 millisecond (ms) causes the
servo to turn all the way in one direction; a duration of 2.0 ms causes the servo to turn all
the way in the other direction.
Note that the pulse-width variance of 1.0 to 2.0 ms is average for most R/C servos, and
that the full rotation of a servo is typically 130 to 180 degrees, depending on its mechani-
cal design.

Modifying Servos for Continuous Rotation
R/C servos have built-in mechanical stops that prevent them from turning more than
about 180 degrees (exception: servos meant for specialty applications, like landing gear
retraction, which may turn 360 to 720 degrees). By removing the mechanical stops, and
making a change in the electrical connections inside, it’s possible for the output of the
servo to turn continuously in either direction. Modified servos are often used for the drive
wheels of small robots because their use simplifies the connection between the control
electronics of a robot and the motor drive. The servo package includes motor, reduction
gearing, and power drive electronics and can be directly connected to a microcontroller,
computer port, or other digital interface.
The Internet and World Wide Web provide a number of sources for information on how
to modify popular standard-size servos. Check out the following:

radio control-servos 435
Representative model R/C servo.
Digital Proportional versus Digital Servos
Standard servos for radio controlled models use digital signals to control their position.
This is called digital proportional control. The position of the output of the servo is propor-
tional to the width of the on/off (digital) signals being fed to it.
But internally, these servos are old-fashioned analog devices. The latest twist in R/C is
the digital servo; these use onboard digital circuitry to enhance the functionality of the
motor. Inside the motor case is a microprocessor that is controlled by commands you
send from the transmitter. In addition to the standard digital pulses used for positioning
the servo, additional programming commands can be sent for such functions as control-
ling the speed of the servo motor and for readjusting the center point of the servo. 
Digital servos can be operated from the same R/C receivers or robotic servo con-
trollers as standard servos. However, the programmability feature (for those digital servos
that support it) requires a specialized programmer module.
Key benefits of digital servos include higher resolution of position and faster response
time. An example digital servo is the Hitec HS-5925MG. Its specifications are impressive:
• 128 oz. of torque
• 0.08-sec. speed (60 degrees)
• 384 oz. of holding power, at 6 volts
Digital servos cost several times more than their older-fashioned analog cousins, but at
least part of the higher cost is in mechanical improvements. The typical digital servo uses
high-speed ball bearing construction, more powerful motors, and stronger gears. They
are designed as the choice for performance R/C applications, such as model helicopters.
If you opt to use digital servos in your robotics project, you must ensure that your bat-
tery pack can deliver the extra current they draw. The average digital servo is designed to
drive heavier loads at higher speeds, and this requires more current from your battery
pack. High-capacity (1,600 mAh or higher) ni-cad batteries, NiMH batteries, or sealed
lead-acid batteries are recommended.
Finally, digital servos tend to be much louder than standard servos, both when turning
and when “idling” (they can buzz while remaining still). Don’t use them if you’re building a
spy robot!
Futaba provides some technical details on digital servos on their Web site (some pages
may be in PDF format, requiring you to install and use the Adobe Acrobat Reader):

How to Buy Mail Order
It may seem daft to “explain” how to buy mail order, but every year thousands of people get
cheated out of millions of dollars with mail order (that is, millions in total, not every person!).
So, for reminder’s sake, here’s a list and dos and don’ts when conducting business by mail.
Do
• Understand exactly what you are buying, when delivery will be made, and how much
you’re paying before sending any money. Sounds simple enough, but it’s easy to forget
the small stuff when you’re excited about finding goodies for your robot.
• Favor those companies that provide a mailing address and a working phone number
for voice contact (not just fax). Sellers without one or the other aren’t necessarily
crooks, but lack of contact information just makes it harder to get a hold of someone
should there be a problem.
• Be wary of companies that advertise by sending unsolicited “spam” via e-mail. Spam is
basically free to send, so everyone can do it—including the scamsters.
• Verify shipping charges, handling charges, and service fees before finalizing the order.
These costs can significantly add to the price, especially for small orders.
• Check out the company before sending them a significant order (“significant” is up to
you; it might be anything over $500, or it might be anything over $35). Check for a poor
rating with the Better Business Bureau (or similar institution for those outside the United
States) in the company’s home town; in the appropriate newsgroups; or in online chat
or bulletin boards.
• Determine added costs for duty, taxes, and shipping when buying internationally.
• Carefully examine your credit card monthly statement for improper charges.
Don’t
• Give your credit card number via e-mail, or on a Web page order form, unless you
know the communications link is secure.
• Buy from a source unless you feel very comfortable you can trust your money with them.
• Use a credit card to pay for goods from a company you have not yet dealt with if send-
ing a check or money order is just as easy. This limits the exposure of your credit card
accounts to possible Internet fraud.
• Send money to foreign companies unless you’re positive they are safe bets. While
you’re checking them out, be sure they will ship to your country.
Should you have trouble with a mail-order merchant (and you or the business is in the
United States), the following two organizations might be able to help you resolve the matter.

Money Changing and Currency Conversions
Robotics is truly a global endeavor, with people all over the world buying and selling
goods, services, and software. Web pages in other countries typically show prices in the
local currency, such as yen in Japan or pounds or Euros in Great Britain. You can use a
currency converter service—of which there are many freely available on the Web—to cal-
culate the going exchange rate of currencies.
One of the easiest (and least marred by pop-up ads) is XE.com:
http://www.xe.com/
To use, specify the amount to exchange and the “from” and “to” currencies. For exam-
ple, if a Web site shows a price in Japanese yen, and you want dollars, you select JPN
Japan Yen in the From pull-down list, and USD United States Dollars in the To pull-down
list. The rates are updated daily, but are not guaranteed to be the ones in effect when you
actually make your purchase. Use for ballpark estimates only.
Calculating Shipping Costs via UPS
The United Parcel Service, or UPS, delivers packages to North America and worldwide.
For those in the United States, UPS is a common mode of delivery of packages, even
over the Post Office. UPS has several service “grades” depending on how soon you want
your goodies, from next-day air to “ground”—ground shipping goes by truck or air and is
given the lowest priority.
The costs to ship via UPS are readily calculated using the UPS Web site:
http://www.ups.com/
From this centralized location, choose the Rates link, then fill in the following information
to calculate shipping costs: shipper location, shippee (that’s you) location, weight, size,
service type, and whether the package is being dropped off at a UPS service station or if
it’s being picked up.
You probably won’t know some specifics about the package being sent to you, such as
its size or whether it’s being picked up by a driver, but you can enter nominal values here
to arrive at an approximate shipping cost. Most online retailers not operated out of some-
one’s home use the “daily pickup service,” where a driver comes by once a day to collect
the boxes. Use that option if you’re not sure. Unless you know the box will be overly
large, use 8-inch-square dimensions for the packaging size.
Note that many mail-order retailers also charge a “handling” or packaging fee, in addi-
tion to any direct shipping costs. Remember to tack these fees onto the price you pay.


Retail-Armatures 
& Doll Parts
Retail stores that specialize in doll and teddy bear-mak-
ing parts are listed in this section. This includes some-
thing known as armatures, which are used in dolls and
puppets to replicate bone joints. Basic armatures for
teddy bears are made of plastic and act like universal
joints, allowing movement in all directions. More
sophisticated armatures are made of metal and allow
movement in one plane only. They may be on puppets
and more lifelike dolls.
Other doll parts you can use in your robots include
eyes, noses, and “body foam” (soft and pliable, but
thick).

Where to Get Stuff: Arts and Craft Stores
Arts and craft stores are veritable gold mines of handy robotic materials, with the added
advantage of low cost—few people want to spend lots of money on their leisure projects.
Keep an eye out for the following goodies at your neighborhood arts and craft outlet.
• Foam rubber sheets in various colors and thicknesses.
• Foam board, constructed of foam sandwiched between two heavy sheets of paper.
• Electronic light and sound buttons to make Christmas ornaments and custom greeting
cards are also well suited for robots.
• Jewelry findings, in plastic and metal, for making your own jewelry, are handy for con-
structing miniature robots and other parts. Findings include metal pushpins and locking
fasteners, used to make earrings.
• Parts for dolls and teddy bears can often be used in robots. Fancier dolls use “articula-
tions”—movable and adjustable joints—which can be used in your robot creations. Look
also for linkages, bendable posing wire, and eyes (great for building robots with per-
sonality!).
• Plastic crafts construction material can be used in lieu of more expensive building kits.
• Model-building supplies, including plastic and metal parts, glues and adhesives, and
hand tools.

Shrink Art Plastic 
Ask most kids and they know what Shrinky Dink is: It’s a plastic that shrinks to one-quar-
ter of its size when heated in an oven at about 225 degrees. Generically, it’s called shrink
art plastic sheets and also goes by such names as Super Color Shrink and PolyShrink.
You can draw or print a shape on the plastic, and when “reduced,” the printing stays vivid
and clear. You can use it to create nameplates and labels, encoder discs, body designs,
and more.
Cost is about a dollar per sheet, and you can cut out just the portion you need.
You can find Shrinky Dink at Wal-Mart and other discounters; the generic (and therefore
less expensive) material can be found at arts and craft stores.

Lawrence Art Materials offers online buying of arts
and crafts supplies. Their product line emphasizes
painting and reproduction supplies (acrylics,
brushes, easels, and whatnot), but they also offer a
number of potentially useful artifacts for bot build-
ing. It’s all in how you look at things. Here are some
ideas:
• Intaglio printing plates involve copper or zinc
sheet metal. These sheets can be used in the con-
struction or embellishment of robot bodies.
Available in different thicknesses (1-2mm is aver-
age) and sizes, and the smaller sheets are quite
affordable.
• Fluorescent acrylics can be used to paint your robot
in vivid colors. Bright colors can be used when
building robot teams for competitions (depending
on the vision system, of course). 
• Lazertran transfer paper lets you print in full color
and transfer the image to most any surface. Use it
for your robot’s paint job, to label a control panel,
and more. See http://www.lazertran.com/ for more
info.
• Student-quality rollers, which can be used to press
on glued laminates (thin metal over wood or plas-
tic), rub-on lettering, and any other job where gen-
tle but firm pressure must be applied. 
• Engraving plastic is a thin semiflexible plastic sheet
that can be used for building laminates.

For robotics, auctions can provide inexpensive test
equipment, tools, and materials. But be careful: Items
at most auctions are sold as-is, and one person’s high
bid may be another person’s junk they’re trying to
unload. A word of advice: Do not bid on any auction
unless you know exactly what you’re buying, no matter
how attractive the price. This applies particularly to gov-
ernment auctions, where online details are scarce and
the condition of the item only marginally described.

DRMS
DRMS stands for “Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service,” an agency of the U.S.
government (at least for now) that sells stuff back to the taxpayers, who already paid for
it to begin with. The government calls it “surplus,” but it can be new or used, in perfect or
in junk condition. Prices are typically pennies on the dollar, and goods are typically offered
as sealed bids.
(By the way, you’ll also see the notation DRMO. That stands for “Defense Reutilization
and Marketing Offices,” the name the government gives to each local DRMS field office.)
What can you get government surplus? If you’re lucky, you might find a Jeep for $22,
but more likely, you’ll find reasonably good deals on motors, test equipment, tools, com-
puter gear, and other electronics. You won’t be able to purchase entire Titan missiles
from Uncle Sam, but you might get at auction some of its nonclassified subsystems.
(They destroy the classified stuff.)
In the old days, government surplus was sold by the pallet-full at depot stations around
the country—often, but not always, at military bases. Now, the auctions may take place on
base or more often than not, over the Internet or at a private salvager’s lot. With the latter,
the government has handed over the details of the auction to a private company; the com-
pany handles all the financial and material transactions, taking a service fee for doing so.
An outfit known as Government Liquidation, LLC, handles most (if not all) of the surplus
sales for the U.S. government. Their Web site should be your first stop for any govern-
ment surplus auction you may wish to participate in:
http://www.govliquidation.com/
The process is fairly simple: First, you register with the site, providing your e-mail name
and physical address. You then cruise the listings. Like all auctions, be sure you’re serious
about buying before you bid. And unlike eBay and most online auctions, the typical gov-
ernment auction is “closed,” and you don’t get to see what others are bidding for on the
stuff you want. This can be a disadvantage or an advantage, depending on how you bid. 
One approach: Consult the purchase price amount, which is usually indicated in the
auction listing. Then base your bid on some percentage of this amount, say 10 percent.
This assumes the item you’re bidding on is in good working order; if it’s damaged or non-
working, even if listed as repairable, you’ll want to offer less than your usual.

Hobbies and Crafts on eBay
Buy used. Buy new. Buy junk. It’s all available on eBay, the world’s largest online auction
site. What you get all depends on how careful a buyer you are. 
eBay categorizes their auctions; hobby and craft products are listed under:
http://pages.ebay.com/catindex/hobbies.html
Some of the main and subcategories of interest are as follows:
• Model RR, Trains—Model trains and accessories 
• Arts & Crafts—Painting, scrapbooking, ceramics, handcrafted arts, more
• Models—Plastic, metal, and wood kits, model-making supplies 
• Radio Control Vehicles—Radio-controlled cars, boats, and aircraft 
• Supplies—Art supplies and more
If you’ve used eBay before, then you know all the details. If you haven’t used eBay,
keep the following in mind:
• You must sign up first before you can bid on any auction, and you must be 18 years or
over to sign up.
• Don’t bid unless you are willing to spend the money. eBay lets sellers write negative
comments about customers who don’t pay up. (As a buyer, you can also write things
about the sellers you’ve dealt with. This ensures everyone plays fair.)
• Read the item description carefully before bidding. Know exactly what you are getting
before you bid.
• If you have any questions, e-mail the seller. If the seller does not respond, do not bid!
• Double-check shipping and handling charges. Some sellers on eBay charge excessive
handling and make much of their money that way. Don’t be a sucker.
• Compare the going price for the item you’re bidding on against other current auctions,
if any. You can also compare the final high-bid price using the Completed Item search
option.
• Use proxy bidding to set your “best and final” high price. Decide the maximum
amount you want to pay for an item, then stick to it. Set this as your high price;
eBay will automatically ratchet up your bid, up to your maximum, if others bid against
you. Refrain from getting into “bidding wars” at the last minute and going over your
maximum.
• It’s quite common to be “sniped” by last-minute high bidders. They wait until the auc-
tion is about to close, then place their bids, hoping no one outbids them in the final
seconds. Don’t get mad and vow to do the same yourself next time. You’re bound to
overbid.

Retail-Automotive
Supplies
Even if you’re not building a robotic car you will find
automotive supply stores handy resources for tools and
parts. Granted, much of the components are geared
toward cars and trucks, and specific models at that, but
the general-purpose merchandise such as switches,
wires, electrical connectors, batteries, battery chargers,
12-volt vacuum cleaners, rubber gasket-making and
RTV materials, and trim can be useful to robot builders.
Not included here, but nevertheless useful sources, are
automotive recyclers, better known as junkyards. These
are local in nature, so look in the Yellow Pages or other
business phone listings. Junkyards are good sources for
things like used windshield or power window motors.
Some require you to remove the part from the car, and
others have done the dismantling for you. Obviously,
you’ll save money with the former.

Retail-Discount &
Department
I just love it when I can walk into a general-purpose
store and find the perfect part for my robot projects.
One reason for this joy is the cost savings in finding
merchandise meant for one thing, but readily adapt-
able to my robotics hobby.
This section lists a variety of national, even interna-
tional, discount and department stores. The product
carried by these stores is varied, and the listings are pro-
vided here more to get your creative juices flowing. You
have to actually walk through the aisles and pick things

up to determine which stuff is useful in your robot-
building endeavors.
Several of the big discount chains, such as Kmart and
Target, are also ideal sources for robotic toys. Watch for
regular clearance sales, which occur in the months
before Christmas and immediately after the holidays.
Additional clearance sales may be held in late January
or February, after the annual toy convention held in
New York. 
Do consider there are many more discount and depart-
ment stores than those listed here. In your area may be
a number of smaller chains, even independent stores.
Don’t forget to include them your regular “parts

Here you buy 30 rolls of toilet paper at a time, or you

You can order products at the Costco Web site, but
they’re generally not the same as the ones for sale in

you. 
Helpful tip: Costco labels all their product with large
pricing signs, usually stuck to the shelves with magnets
or hung overhead on a wire. If you notice a big asterisk
(star) on the pricing sign, it means it’s a “seasonal”
and/or temporary item, and when the current stock is
gone, it’s gone. It probably won’t be reordered. Keep
this in mind should you want to stock up on some prod-

Once known for its abundant use of orange Formica,
Target is now one of the leading retailers in North
America, with stores from Bangor, Maine, to Honolulu,
Hawaii-and about 1,000 more in between. Target stores
come in a variety of flavors that fit the local neighbor-
hood. For lots of choices, nothing beats Target
Greatland and Super Target, which boast an extended
product mix (and, in my observation, slightly lower
prices). The “ordinary” Target stores offer a few less
items, but I found they are more likely to stuff the end
caps (the ends of shelves) with clearance items. I once
bought a new LEGO Mindstorms set, on clearance, at
my local “ordinary” Target store for under $100-about
half off. 
My usual procedure is to make an afternoon of visiting
the several Target stores in my area. Pickin’s are partic-

Toys and manipulatives. What’s a manipulative, and
why is it a cool thing for robots? Manipulatives are small
shapes used to teach counting, patterns, and motor
skills. They may be little bits of plastic, wood, or foam,
but because they are small and precut, they make for
good robot-building materials. Also sells gears, K’NEX
construction sets.

Where to Get Stuff: Mail Order
There is no limit to what you can buy mail order (at one time, they even sold houses
through the mail!). So, rather than tell you what to look for in mail order, it makes
more sense to remind you of the different kinds of mail order. (And yes, I know that
these days, less and less “mail order” is going through the mails—it’s a term of con-
venience.)
• Retail catalog sales. Some retail stores also offer goods via a separate mail-order
branch. If the store has a printed catalog, obtain a copy and look through it for special
products not carried in the bricks-and-mortar store.
• Mail-order catalogs. This is the typical form of mail order, where a company sends you
a catalog or brochure, and you order from it. More and more outfits are conducting this
kind of business from the Internet, saving the cost of printing catalogs.
• Internet. Thanks to the Internet you can now find the most elusive part for your robot.
The Internet is an extension of catalog sales, where Web pages take the place of
printed pages. A disadvantage is that even the best e-commerce shopping cart is not
as handy as a nice color catalog that you can read at your leisure, in any part of the
house.
• Online auctions. Typified by eBay, online auctions provide a means for individual buyers
and sellers to trade. Goods are shipped via the mail.
When shopping mail order, always compare prices of similar items offered by various
companies before buying. Consider all the variables, such as the added cost of insur-
ance, postage and handling, and COD fees. Be sure that the mail-order firm has a lenient
return policy. You should always be able to return unsuitable goods if they are not satis-

Stocking Up on Everyday Electronic Components
There are thousands of different electronic components, but most circuits use just a
handful of them. If you do any amount of electronic circuit building, you’ll want to stock up
on the following standard components. Keeping spares handy prevents you from making
repeat trips to the electronics store. 
• Resistors. Get a good assortment of 1/8- and 1/4-watt resistors. Make sure the assort-
ment includes a variety of common values, and that there are several of each value.
Supplement the assortment with individual purchases of the following resistor values:
270 ohm, 330 ohm, 1K ohm, 3.3K ohm, 10K ohm, and 100K ohm. The 270- and 330-
ohm values are often used with light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and the remaining values
are common to TTL and CMOS digital circuits.
• Variable resistors. Variable resistors, or potentiometers (pots), are relatively cheap and
are a boon when designing and troubleshooting circuits. Buy an assortment of the
small PC-mount pots (about 80 cents each, retail) in the 2.5K, 5K, 10K, 50K, 100K,
500K, 250K, and 1-megohm values. You’ll find 500K and 1-megohm pots often used in
op-amp circuits, so buy a couple extra of these.
• Capacitors. For a well-stocked shop, get a dozen or so each of the following inexpen-
sive ceramic capacitors: 0.1, 0.01, and 0.001 µF (microfarad). Many circuits use
in-between values of 0.47, 0.047, and 0.022 µF. A small stock of 0.1-µF tantalum capac-
itors is useful; these capacitors are used for power supply decoupling. Larger elec-
trolytic and specialty capacitors can be purchased on an as-needed basis, though a
small assortment of values from 1 to 100 µF will be a time-saver.
• Transistors. There are thousands of transistors available, but a few “generic” ones are
typical in many circuits. Common NPN signal transistors are the 2N2222 and the
2N3904 (some transistors are marked with an “MPS” prefix instead of the “2N” prefix;
they are the same). Common PNP signal transistors are the 2N3906 and the 2N2907.
The NPN TIP31 and TIP41 are familiar to most anyone who has dealt with power switch-
ing or amplification of up to about 1 amp. PNP counterparts are the TIP32 and TIP42.
These transistors come in the T0-220-style package. A common larger-capacity NPN
transistor that can switch 10 amps or more is the 2N3055. It comes in the T0-3- and
T0-220-style packages. 
• Diodes. Common diodes are the 1N914, for light-duty signal-switching applications, and
the 1N4000 series (1N4001, 1N4002, 1N4003, and 1N4004). Get several of each and use
the proper size to handle the current in the circuit. A special kind of diode is the zener,
which is typically used for regulating voltage. Zener diodes are available in a variety of
voltages and wattages. Purchase these as needed.
• LEDs. All semiconductors emit light, but light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are especially
designed for the task. Small red LEDs are among the most common, but other colors
and sizes are available, as well. White and blue LEDs are the most expensive, so you’ll
want to save these for special purposes. Green and red are far less expensive, and you
can stock up on a number of these. Infrared LEDs, which emit no light, are used to
build several kinds of robotic sensors.

Stocking Up—Integrated Circuits
Integrated circuits let you construct fairly complex circuits from just a couple of compo-
nents. Although there are literally thousands of different ICs, some with exotic applica-
tions, a small handful crops up again and again in hobby projects. You should keep the
following common ICs in ready stock: 
• 555 timer. This is, by far, the most popular integrated circuit for hobby electronics. With
just a couple of resistors and capacitors, the 555 can be made to act as a pulser, a
timer, a time delay, a missing-pulse detector, and more. 
• LM741 op-amp. The 741 can be used for signal amplification, differentiation, integration,
sample-and-hold, and a host of other useful applications. The 741 is available in a dual
version, the 1458. Note that there are numerous other op-amps available, and some
have design advantages over the 741. These include the LM324, LF356, and the TL082.
• LM339 quad comparator. Comparators are used to compare two voltages. The output
of the comparator changes depending on the voltage levels at its two inputs. The com-
parator is similar to the op-amp, except that it does not use an external feedback resis-
tor. You can use an op-amp as a comparator, but a better approach is to use some-
thing like the 339 chip, which contains four comparators in one package.
• LM386 audio amplifier. This common and versatile single-package audio amplifier can
drive an ordinary 8-ohm speaker with up to a quarter of a watt. Only a couple of capac-
itors are needed to complete the circuit.
• ULN2003 transistor array. A transistor array is an integrated circuit containing multiple
transistors. The device is commonly used to increase the current capacity of microcon-
trollers and other devices that cannot provide enough juice to run large LED panels or
relays. Other transistor array ICs are available, with some able to drive loads of up to
500 mA per channel.
• TTL logic chips. TTL ICs are common in computer circuits and other digital applications.
There are many types of TTL packages, but you won’t use more than 10 to 15 of them
unless you’re heavily into electronics experimentation. Specifically, the most common
and most useful TTL ICs are the 7400, 7402, 7404, 7407, 7408, 7414, 7420, 7430, 7432,
7473, 7474, 74123, 74154, 74174, 74175, 74193, 74240, 74244, 74273, and 74274.
• CMOS logic chips. Because CMOS ICs require less power to operate than the TTL vari-
ety, you’ll often find them specified for use with low-power robotic and remote-control
applications. Like TTL, there is a relatively small number of common packages: 4001,
4011, 4013, 4016, 4017, 4024, 4027, 4040, 4049, 4066, 4069, 4071, 4081, 4093, 4511,
4543, and 4584.

B. G. Micro is a haven for the electronics tinkerer and
robotics enthusiast. Much of the stock is surplus, so it
comes and goes, but while it’s being offered, it has a
good price attached to it. Get it while you can, because
someone else surely will. 
The company also offers a fairly complete line of pas-
sive and active general electronics components, includ-
ing IC sockets, resistors, capacitors, linear and digital
ICs, switches, relays, solenoids, pin headers, transistors,
diodes, voltage regulators, LEDs, infrared phototransis-
tors, batteries and battery holders, cables, wire, hand
tools, connectors, optics, standoffs, and other plastic
and metal hardware.

Web catalog page for B.G. Micro.

Specific products of interest to the robot builder
include LCD displays (including serial LCD), motors,
and the OOPic microcontroller. 
A word of caution! Don’t skim the B. G. Micro catalog
too quickly. Its design is fairly “compact” and it’s easy to
miss things. They sell a lot of parts that are best
described as miscellaneous, and there can be some real
gems hidden between product listings. Some super
finds are just a single line of text in the 30-odd-page cat-
alog!

All in the TTL Chip Family
There are several families of TTL chips. The family is denoted by letter identifiers, such as
74HC193. They differ in the amount of current they consume, their speed, and their man-
ufacture. The most commonly used letter identifiers are as follows:
A—Advanced
C—CMOS
F—Fast
H—High speed
L—Low power
S—Schottky
T—TTL compatible
It is common to combine letter identifiers, such as LS (low-power Schottkey), HC (high-
speed CMOS), and HCT (high-speed CMOS TTL-compatible).
Which one(s) to use depends on the application. If a circuit specifies a certain TTL fam-
ily, be sure to use it, as the designer of the circuit may have included it for a reason. If
there is no specific family mentioned, an S, LS, or HCT version will usually (note the
emphasis on usually) work.

Fry’s are: 
• Robots (like the Parallax BOE-Bot) 
• Basic Stamp starter kits 
• Tamiya Educational motor sets 
• OWI/MOVITS robots 
• Integrated circuits, transistors, diodes, resistors,

• Soldering irons, PCB supplies, breadboard supplies 
• Books (more than you knew were ever

• Computer software 
• Soda pop and candy 
• Video games and video game consoles 
• X-rated movies 
• Washing machines 
I left out about 1,000 other product lines, but you get
the idea. Weekdays are the best time to shop; the aisles
get really cluttered on the weekends. Watch for previ-
ously opened (and/or returned) merchandise, the lat-
ter of which is usually marked. If the box can be
opened-that is, it’s not shrink wrapped-check its con-
tents before buying.

(MPJA). I got a beautiful large tube in an aluminum
housing for 10 bucks, and they got a customer for
life.
MPJA sells both new and surplus electronic and
mechanical products. Their assortment of such items as
motors is fairly small, but they make up for it with a
wide selection of other common (and some not-so-com-
mon) products, like LEDs, DC-DC converters, power
supplies, sugar-cube-sized video cameras, tools, LCD
displays (including a nice serial interface board), ultra-
sonic transducers, microphones, and tons of other
stuff. Prices are very good. 
Get their color catalog, but make it a point to regularly

Be sure to study it well so you don’t miss the interesting
items. For example, an addition that almost slipped by
me is an affordable (under $3) ultraviolet LED. These
are useful for a number of reasons. UV light causes cer-
tain materials to fluoresce, which can be used (with the
proper sensor) for robotic vision.

First, a story. Years ago I was interested in exploring
radiation and radioactive substances (nothing danger-
ous, mind you, just naturally occurring materials). I
wanted to build a Geiger counter, which is basically a
specially designed gas tube (called a Geiger-Mueller
tube) and some very simple electronics. Though I
searched everywhere, few sources were willing to sell
just the G-M tube . . . except Marlin P. Jones & Assoc.

and measurement gear, batteries, and chargers. 
Of particular interest is the replacement parts for VCRs,
cassette players, and other consumer electronics. These
can be a good source of relatively inexpensive belts, pul-
leys, and even motors. To be useful, you need to know
the part number to understand exactly what you’re get-

Retail-Hardware & Home
Improvement
Everyone else may spend their Saturdays fixing a
clogged kitchen drain, but we robot builders are busy
in our workshops, hammering together our next walk-
ing ‘bot. Still, both the robot makers and the drain
fixer-uppers go to the local hardware and home
improvement stores. We may actually buy much of the
same things, but the end use is completely different.
Hardware stores (and their close but larger cousin, the
home improvement outlet) are excellent sources for
fasteners, basic hardware, tools, tool accessories (saw
blades, bits, etc.), paint, glues and adhesives, casters,
wheels, plastic sheeting, metal stock, and hundreds of
other items.
The resources listed here either have an online pres-
ence or are national chains. In the U.S., many hardware
stores belong to one of several cooperative “chains,”
such as True Value and Ace. Other independent hard-
ware stores may be located near you, and you should
not hesitate to visit them. Keep a notebook of what
each area hardware store offers, so the next time you
need a particular item, you’ll know just where to go to
get it.

Don’t Forget the Corner Hardware Store
In the age of the Internet, where everything seems but a click away, it’s easy to forget
that the best place to buy things is in your own neighborhood. Buying local helps you han-
dle the merchandise yourself; a picture on a Web page may say a thousand words, but
being able to hoist some artifact in your hand is worth a lot more. And, of course, returns
and exchanges are easier when you buy locally, because you don’t have to hassle with
packing things in a box and standing in line at the post office or shipper’s.
Any self-respecting robot hobbyist should know every location of every hobby store
and hardware store in a 5- or 10-mile radius. This is especially true of hardware stores,
which are more plentiful and varied than hobby stores. Whether you live in an area, as I
do, with four or five home improvement superstores nearby, or have only a single small-
town retailer to rely on, hardware stores are the source for common items, including
metal stock, fasteners, tools, saws and bits, adhesives, and paints.
I’ve memorized every aisle of the stores near me and have taken notes about pricing,
so that if I need some widget, I know where I saw it and about how much it cost.
Humongous home improvement outlets aren’t necessarily better than the small, inde-
pendent retailer. In fact, in my area, the local Ace Hardware store carries a better variety
of casters and specialty fasteners (including metric and nylon) than the big Lowe’s and
Home Depot.
Of course, not everyone lives within a reasonable distance of any hardware or home
improvement store, and here is where the Internet can help. In the last few years, hard-
ware-specialty retailers have set up shop on the Internet, either in direct competition
with local stores or in support of their own chain of bricks-and-mortar outlets. For
example,
• B&Q has many stores in the U.K., and they also sell many products over the Internet. 
http://www.diy.com/
• Home Depot in North America augments their huge warehouses with Maintenance
Warehouse, a catalog and online retailer of hardware goods intended for home and
building repair/maintenance.
http://www.mwh.com/
• CornerHardware.com offers a virtual hardware store experience, offering hand and
power tools, electrical items, and most everything else you’d find in a real hardware
store.
http://www.cornerhardware.com/

what you need for your ‘bot. Depending on where you
live, same-day or next-day shipping may be available to
you; otherwise, you’ll wait two or three days to get your
stuff. 
Use the locator at the Web site to find a warehouse near
you (they’re in major cities across the U.S.).

”Retail-Office Supplies
What do office supplies and robots have in common?
Depends on how you look at the products carried by
office supply companies. Consider alternative uses for
such items as packing tape, nonpermanent adhesives,
ink-jet transfer film, plastic for spiral-binding machines
(both the plastic covers and the combs), reinforced
strapping tape, and lots more.
And, of course, there’s always the mundane, but still
useful, label makers, labels, parts bin organizers, batter-
ies, and other products useful for maintaining a well-
ordered robot-building shop.
The chain store listings here are representative of office
supply stores worldwide. These resources offer online
sales, and you can browse their Web catalogs for ideas.

Researching with Mail-Order Catalogs
I once saw a documentary about how actor and martial arts expert Jackie Chan made it a
habit to save old newspaper and magazine clippings as ideas for his films. He’d save
some for months, even years, and hang them up on a wall for easy reference. The
process must work because Jackie Chan movies are always inventive and original, even
though many of the sequences in them may have been inspired by real-life events!
The moral of this story is really about finding inspiration and how you can take ordinary
things, find some new slant about them, and end up with an original idea. Same thing with
products found in mail-order catalogs. Most catalogs describe products for the use they
were intended. Yet many ordinary, everyday products have many more applications.
Make it a point to go through every mail-order catalog that comes into the house or
classroom. Just because the catalog may not sell “Robot Parts” doesn’t mean it doesn’t
have robot parts to sell. Obviously, apparel catalogs have less relevance to robot building
than, say, a household tools catalog or even the monthly Home Depot flyer.
Instead of throwing away catalogs when they get old, go through them once more and
tear out products you think might have a use beyond the obvious application. Maybe that
fiberglass replacement shovel handle could be used to build a super lightweight robot
frame, for far less than the same amount of material in wood or metal. Or maybe the
dog-training collar in the latest pet supply catalog could be adapted to signal a robot
when it’s about to venture outside your yard. 
Even if you can’t think of a good application now, save the item, and put in a scrap-
book. Periodically, when the mood strikes you, pull out the scrap book to review your
special finds.

Small Parts, for Robots of Any Size
Large mechanical components are relatively plentiful, and easy to buy. Bike stores, lawn-
mower repair shops, auto parts marts, auto recyclers (junk yards), and similar resellers
offer a wide variety of heavy duty bearings, axles, sprockets, chains, gears, and other
power transmission components.
Too bad it’s not nearly as simple to find the small stuff. And when you can find it, minia-
ture power transmission components tend to be just as expensive as their bigger
cousins. Salvaging components from old VCRs, compact disc players, even wall clocks is
an alternative, but you never know what you’ll get, and the parts are often manufactured
for a specific narrow application, and may not adapt to the role you want it to play in your
robot creation.
This doesn’t mean small power transmission parts don’t exist; you just have to go to
the right sources. Premier mail order sources of small power transmission components—
gears, sprockets, roller chain, bearings, shafts, etc.—are Serv-o-link, Small Parts, Stock
Drive Products, W. M. Berg, Didel, Hammad Ghuman, Kelvin, and Miniature Bearings.
There are others, of course, but this is a good well-rounded group that represents a vari-
ety of components, all the way from inexpensive plastic molded parts, to hand-machined
goods in titanium.
When searching for small parts, you’ll want to be mindful of the intended application,
and then look for the cheapest material that will do the job. In most cases, small parts are
not used for high torque applications, so molded plastic parts may suffice. If this is the
case for your application, you’ll find that by selecting plastic over metal you can save con-
siderably.

Robots Don’t Eat!
You may be wondering why I listed several online and local restaurant supply outlets. No,
I’m not suggesting you build a mechanical Emeril, or that amateur robots make for good
chefs—personally, I get enough robotic service at the local fast-food joint. 
Rather, restaurant supply outlets tend to be excellent sources for materials at low cost.
Typical restaurant supply outlets carry such items as:
• Stainless steel spun bowls (miniature dipping and finger-bowl size, up to gargantuan
100-pound mixing bowls);
• Aluminum and steel baking sheets, with and without antistick coatings (can be a cheap
alternative to aluminum or metal sheet purchased at hardware and hobby stores);
• Kitchen and baking utensils, in plastic, metal, or wood—cut them to various shapes to
make parts for your robots;
• Miscellaneous unusual items, including strainers, individual bread and cake pans (good
as the “mother mold” for making small castings), silverware containers that make for
great vertical parts bins, and plastic tumblers (you and I call them “glasses”), which can
be sawed to various sizes and shapes and used for protective robotic covers, shells,
and other applications.
When shopping the restaurant supply store, you must think outside the box. Don’t look
at a miniature plastic saltshaker as a dispenser of sodium chloride. Instead, look at it as a
housing for a robotic sensor or the leg tips to a medium-sized walking robot. Be creative!
Final note: Steer away from the retailers that specialize in “gourmet kitchens.” Their
products tend to be more expensive. The typical restaurant supply outlet sells cheap,
because eateries are like any other business—they’re always looking for ways to trim
costs. You get to enjoy those cost savings, too.

Where to Get Stuff: Retail
There aren’t many robot-building stores at the mall, but you can do quite well at the fol-
lowing retail establishments around town.
• Hobby and model stores. Ideal sources for small parts, including lightweight plastic,
brass rod, servo motors for radio control (R/C) cars and airplanes, gears, and con-
struction hardware. 
• Arts and craft stores. Sell supplies for home crafts and arts. As a robot builder, you’ll be
interested in just a few of the aisles at most craft stores, but what’s in those aisles will
be a godsend! 
• Hardware stores and builder’s supply outlets. Fasteners (nuts, bolts), heavy-gauge gal-
vanized metal, hand and motorized tools.
• Electronic specialty stores. There’s Radio Shack, of course, which continues to support
electronics experimenters. Check the local Yellow Pages under Electronics-Retail for a
list of electronics parts shops near you. 
• Surplus. Electronics surplus stores specialize in new and used mechanical and elec-
tronic parts (these are not to be confused with surplus clothing, camping, and govern-
ment equipment stores). Finding them is not always easy. Start by looking in the phone
book Yellow Pages under Electronics, and also under Surplus.
• Sewing machine repair shops. Ideal for small gears, cams, levers, and other precision
parts. Some shops will sell broken machines to you. Tear the machine to shreds and
use the parts for your robot. 
• Auto parts stores. The independent stores tend to stock more goodies than the
national chains, but both kinds offer surprises in every aisle. Keep an eye out for things
likes hoses, pumps, and automotive gadgets.
• Auto repair garages. More and more used parts from cars are being recycled or sent
back to a manufacturer for proper disposal, so the pickins at the neighborhood
mechanics garage aren’t as robust as they used to be. But if you ask nicely enough,
many will give you various used parts, like timing belts, or offer them for sale at low
cost.
• Junkyards. Old cars are good sources for powerful DC motors, used for windshield
wipers, electric windows, and automatic adjustable seats (though take note: such
motors tend to be terribly inefficient for a battery-based ‘bot). Or how about the
hydraulic brake system on a junked 1969 Ford Falcon? Bring tools to salvage the parts
you want. And maybe bring the Falcon home with you, too.
• Lawn mower sales/service shops. Lawn mowers use all sorts of nifty control cables,
wheel bearings, and assorted odds and ends. Pick up new or used parts for a current
project or for your own stock.
• Bicycle sales/service shops. Not the department store that sells bikes, but a real pro-
fessional bicycle shop. Items of interest: control cables, chains, brake calipers, wheels,
sprockets, brake linings, and more.
• Industrial parts outlets. Some places sell gears, bearings, shafts, motors, and other
industrial hardware on a one-piece-at-a-time basis.

t
Retail-Robotics Specialty
When I started robotics as a hobby there was no such
thing as a “robot store.” The first I had ever seen was
started in the mid-1980s by Timothy Knight, a young
author who wrote a popular book on personal robots.
His store, in the San Francisco Bay area, offered for sale
toys and robot kits; it closed a few years later, during the
“robot doldrums,” a sad period when amateur robotics
was on the decline because of lack of decent hardware.
Now, with sophisticated microcontrollers costing less
than a night at the movies for a family of four, there are
plenty of interesting products to sell, and robotics spe-
cialty stores have cropped up all over the world. A few
are local retail stores only, but most offer mail-order
sales through catalogs or the Internet.
Robotics specialty stores stock a variety of items, from
robot toys to kits, sensors, motors, and microcon-
trollers. The sources listed in this section expressly con-
centrate on amateur robots and all will sell mail order
(many internationally).
The stock at many robotics specialty outlets is much the
same, allowing you to compare prices. A few, like
Acroname, offer exclusive product not available else-
where.

Ways to Steer Your Robot
There are a variety of methods used to steer wheeled robots. Here are the most com-
mon approaches.
Differential 
For wheeled and tracked robots, differential steering is the
most common method of getting the machine to go in a dif-
ferent direction. The technique is exactly the same as steer-
ing a military tank: One side of wheels or treads stops or
reverses direction while the other side keeps going. The
result is that the robot turns in the direction of the stopped
or reversed wheel/tread. Because of friction effects, differ-
ential steering is most practical with two-wheel drive sys-
tems. Additional sets of wheels can increase friction during
steering.
Car-Type
Pivoting the wheels in the front is yet another method of
steering a robot. Robots with car-type steering are not as
maneuverable as differentially steered robots, but they are
better suited for outdoor use, especially over rough terrain.
Somewhat better traction and steering accuracy are
obtained if the wheel on the inside of the turn pivots to a
greater extent than the wheel on the outside. This tech-
nique is called Ackerman steering and is found on most
cars, but not as many robots.
Three-Wheel Tricycle
Car-type steering, described previously, is one method that avoids the problem of “crab-
bing” due to differences in motor speed (simply because the robot is driven by just one
motor). But car-type steering makes for fairly cumbersome indoor mobile robots; a better
approach is to use a single drive motor powering two rear wheels and a single steering
wheel in the front; the arrangement is just like a child’s tricycle. The robot can be steered
in a circle just slightly larger than the width of the machine. Be careful of the wheel base
of the robot (distance from the back wheels to the front steering wheel). A short base will
cause instability in turns, causing the robot to tip over in the direction of the turn.
Tricycle-steered robots require a very accurate steering motor in the front. The motor
must be able to position the front wheel with subdegree accuracy. Otherwise, there is no
guarantee the robot will be able to travel a straight line. Most often, the steering wheel is
controlled by a servomotor; servomotors used a “closed-loop feedback” system that pro-
vides a high degree of positional accuracy.
Three-Wheeled Omnidirectional
Three drive motors, placed 120 degrees apart (basically at the points of an equilateral tri-
angle), can be used to drive a robot in any direction. In order for the design to work, spe-
cial multidirectional wheels are required. These wheels have rollers around their circum-
ference; they provide traction at angles other than perpendicular to the hub of the wheel.
The robot moves “forward” by activating any two motors; it turns by adjusting the speed
and/or direction of any and all three of the motors.
Differential steering allows a
robot to spin in place.

retail-science
506
As you can imagine, this system requires three drive
motors instead of just two. An alternative design uses four
wheels, with either two motors (two wheels per motor) or
four motors. The wheels are mounted in traditional car fash-
ion. The robot is differentially steered, as explained previ-
ously.
Multidrive Omnidirectional
For the highest-tech of all robots, omnidirectional drive uses
multiple steerable drive wheels, usually at least three such
drive wheels, but sometimes four, five, and even six. The
wheels are operated by two motors: one for locomotion, and
one for steering. In the usual arrangement, the drive/steering wheels are “ganged” together
using gears, rollers, chains, or pulleys. Multidrive omnidirectional robots exhibit excellent
maneuverability and steering accuracy, but they are technically more difficult to construct.
Three-wheeled omnidirectional
drive provides movement in all
directions, without requiring a
support caster.

Retail-Surplus
Electronics
Surplus doesn’t mean junk; it simply means someone
doesn’t need it anymore and is selling their excess
stock. In the case of electronics, surplus seldom means
“used” as it may for other surplus components, such as
motors or mechanical devices. The listings in this sec-
tion are for local and mail-order retailers of surplus
electronics. Note also that many such retailers also sell
new components. As such, there is a blurred line
between what it surplus and what is new.
One benefit of shopping the surplus electronics retailer
is cost: Even for new components, prices are generally
lower than from general electronics retailers. On the
downside, selection may be limited to whatever compo-
nents the store was able to purchase. Don’t expect every
value and size of resistor or capacitor to be available.

Mechanical
This section lists sources for surplus mechanical parts,
all selected for their relevancy to amateur robotics.
Surplus mechanical parts may be either used (called
RFE, for “removed from equipment”), or new. New
parts may be from a manufacturer who made too many
of them, unused goods from the government, or are
repair/replacement parts for a product no longer in
broad use.
No matter what their source, surplus mechanical com-
ponents can represent a real savings over buying the
same goods new. Selection can be severely limited, but
you never know when you’ll find exactly what your
robot needs. For this reason, collect as many surplus
mechanical catalogs as you can, and consult each issue
for the best components.

Some time ago, a fellow named Jerry used to sell odds-
and-ends surplus stuff, having taken over the business
from his parents. That in itself wasn’t unusual, but the
humor he brought to the “write-ups” for the products
in his printed catalog made each edition worth waiting
for. Every robot builder who knew how to use a screw-
driver received-and studied-the Jerryco catalog. 
Alas, Jerry passed away a few years back, but his spirit is
still alive in the “new” Jerryco, American Science &
Surplus. From old optics to new lasers, to books, gears,
pulleys, tools, pumps, magnets, electronics, batteries,
arts and crafts, and everything in between, AS&S offers
a wide range of product at good prices. They still send
out a printed catalog, but all of their wares are available
for viewing online, where you can order as well. 
Realizing that robot building is an important aspect of
their business, AS&S dedicates a special section of the
Web site to robot parts. Find the Robot Parts link in
the table of contents area, and you’ll find the latest
offerings. When I last looked, they had ball transfers
(great for robot support caster wheels), large heavy-
duty wheels, pneumatic cylinders, roller chain, and
more.
Retail stores are in the Chicago and Geneva, Ill., areas
and in Milwaukee, Wisc.

the book they remark, “Many of the components shown

:Retail-Train & Hobby
This section represents a fairly broad collection of
retailers involved with motorized hobbies, particularly
trains and radio-control cars, planes, and boats. Trains
and hobby R/C are combined here because so many
retail establishments do the same. While some model
train components can be pressed into service for robot-
ics, the prime focus is on R/C models, particularly

I Love Catalogs!
Ever since I was a kid I collected—and studied—mail-order catalogs. No, I’m not talking
about the Frederick’s of Hollywood catalogs, either. I’m talking about science, electronics,
and surplus catalogs, like Edmund, Fair Radio, Layfayette Electronics (remember them?),
Allied, and of course Radio Shack.
Never mind that I couldn’t afford anything in these catalogs. I still studied them like they
were baseball statistics. I learned quite a bit from these catalogs, and today I continue the
habit of poring over the better component and equipment catalogs I receive. I even buy
something once in a while!
The Internet makes mail-order buying a cinch, but in my opinion, a printed catalog is still
the best way to really discover what’s available. Web pages can be slow and cranky, and
they’re like trying to see the world through tiny portholes on the side of a ship.
Also consider: Printed catalogs can be taken with you. A highlighter and a stack of
Post-It notes let you flag items you might be interested in. Be sure to read the descrip-
tions for the catalog items; it’s a great way to learn what things are and how they might
be used. The better catalogs even suggest ways how you might adapt a product to a
certain application.
For those mail-order retailers that still offer printed catalogs, be sure to order a copy
(most are free, or cost a buck or two). Some catalogs come with a date stamped on
them; for those that don’t, be sure to write down the date you received it. That way, you
will know when it’s time to get a new one. If the company sends out regular catalogs—
say, every month or so—odds are you’ll be dropped from the mailing list if you don’t order
regularly. That’s okay; keep signing up for more catalogs.

servo motors and related hardware, batteries and bat-
tery chargers, miniature construction hardware and fas-
teners, lightweight wheels, gears and gear sets, and
high-powered motors.
This section primarily lists online and mail-order
sources. Don’t forget the local train and hobby retailer.
Prices may be comparable to what you can find mail
order, with the added benefit of being able to buy and
use all in the same day!

Robots-BEAM
BEAM stands for “Biology Electronics Aesthetics
Mechanics,” a philosophy of robotics that suggests-
when it’s all said and done-smaller is better than larger,
simpler is better than complex, and cheaper is better
than expensive. It’s not surprising then that BEAM
robotics has many followers. It’s a fun, fast, and rela-
tively inexpensive way to get involved in robotics.
While most BEAM ‘bots are extremely simplistic and do
just one or two core tasks, a challenge of this style of
robotics is how to make the machine more robust, with-
out making it more complex, heavy, or expensive.
Turns out this is very hard to do.
The sources in this section sell or support BEAM robot-
ics. Listings include Web sites with free BEAM robot
plans, as well as retailers who sell kits for building
BEAM robots.

Mark is responsible for the BEAM concept, and here we
see his philosophy of BEAM-though in fairly typical
Tilden-speak: “The idea is to improve robo-genetic
stock through stratified competition and have an inter-
esting time in the process.” I think he means scientists
just want to have fun.

now), talks-(chirps in response to light level), sees-
(photo resistors sense brightness to guide it), feels-(via
touch sensing feelers of course!), feeds-(coming soon
via solar cells charging rechargeable batteries-once
enough light is located, bot will go to ‘sleep’ to
recharge).”

Movers and Shakers
Mark Tilden
http://www.nis.lanl.gov/projects/robot/
Can a bunch of little robots do the work of one big
robot? Mark Tilden, creator of the “BEAM” concept
in robotics, thinks so. BEAM stands for “Biology
Electronics Aesthetics Mechanics,” a confluence of
attributes that derives locomotion and behavior from
nature, with simple electronics and mechanics.
Today BEAM robots are popular kits for beginners.

Reading books on robot theory is fine, but what better
way to learn about robotics than to build or use one?
The listings in this section are for robots designed to
teach about robotics. Most educational robots are
designed (and priced) for classroom study, sometimes
by one student at a time, but more commonly, by
groups of students. The typical educational robot com-
prises both a hardware and a software component; the
software allows the robot to be programmed for various
functions.

Robotics group. In the words of the site: “Modular
Reconfigurable Robotics is an idea about how to build
robots for various complex tasks. Instead of designing a
new and different mechanical robot for each task, you
just build many copies of one simple module. The mod-
ule can’t do much by itself, but when you connect many
of them together you get a system that can do compli-
cated things. In fact, a modular robot can even recon-
figure itself-change its shape by moving its modules
around-to meet the demands of different tasks or dif-
ferent working environments.”

Robots-Hobby & Kit
In this section you’ll find robots you can buy, either
ready-made or in kit form. The size and style of robots
are varied, from miniature bots that fit in the palm of a
child’s hand, to behemoths intended to rip the batter-
ies out of other robots. Prices vary, too, from just a
handful of dollars to several thousands of dollars.
Many of the robots and kits listed here are ready to go,
but some may require the addition of a microcontroller
or other support computer. Several robots (ready-made
and kit) are designed for use with third-party microcon-
trollers, primarily the Basic Stamp II. To get full use of
the robot or kit, you must purchase the microcon-
troller, which obviously adds to the cost.

What to Look for in a Robotics Kit
Robot kits offer an ideal way to learn about the science of robot building. Rather than hav-
ing to gather all the bits and pieces yourself, a kit lets you concentrate on the building and
programming aspects. You don’t need to take numerous trips to the hardware store,
and—depending on the kit—you don’t even need to pick up a saw, sander, or drill. (Of
course, there are many robot tinkerers who enjoy this aspect the most. It’s all in your per-
spective.)
If you’re looking to explore the world of amateur robotics with a kit, here are some
pointers to keep in mind to help you decide which one is best for you.
Obviously, cost is a consideration, and most kits fall into three categories. 
• At the low end, costing from $20 to $100, is the kit for a basic nonprogrammable or
simple programmable robot. Examples in this category are BEAM robots (see Robots
- BEAM). These make for good starter kits, especially for younger robobuilders.
• The middle ground is the $100 to $300 kit. The Parallax BOE-Bot (BOE stands for
“Board of Education”)usually comes with a more sophisticated means of programming.
These kits are perfect for junior high and high school robotics studies.
• The high end comprises specialty kits, such as the walking robots from Lynxmotion or
the heavy-duty platforms from Zagros. Prices may vary from a low of $300 to several
thousand dollars. They are intended for the serious robotics hobbyist or for educational
purposes.
Once you’ve decided on the price range that suits you, the next step is comparing fea-
tures. You can judge features based on what the kit comes with (two motors, two
wheels, etc.), or what the completed robot does. If you are looking to learn behavior-
based programming in robotics, a robot kit that does not permit you to change its built-in
programs will not be of much use to you, no matter what hardware it comes with.
Finally, if possible, ask for an electronic copy of the instruction manual that comes with
the kit. Many that I’ve seen are poorly written, and difficult to understand. It can be frus-
trating enough troubleshooting a belligerent robot; you don’t need poor Yoda-ish docu-
mentation worsening the situation.

To call Robotix a “construction toy” would be insulting,
but in fact, the Robotix series construction sets are sold
as toys. Originally developed by gamemeisters Milton-
Bradley, Robotix is now within the fold of Learning
Curve, a company heavily involved in the mechanical
construction toys market (other Learning Curve brands
include Lionel trains). 
Robotix consists of snap-together plastic beams, where
electric motors can serve as joints or rotating wheels.
The beams are very sturdy, and it’s possible to con-
struct a walking Robotix robot that measures over 18
inches tall. The motors are operated either by a wired
controller or by remote control. The motors are quite
powerful as they have their own gear reduction built-
in. The Discovery Channel series of Robotics sets offer
a number of unique designs, including insect-style
walkers.
I have some Robotix sets going back to the mid-1980s,
and I cherish them. Every once in a while, I’ll see
incomplete sets sold at thrift stores, garage sales, even
online at eBay. Though incomplete, the parts from the
sets are interchangeable, allowing for the construction
of even bigger and better robots.

consisting of aluminum profile extrusions (machine
framing), motors, Razor scooter wheels-and other

Sensors
A robot without sensors is just a fancy machine. If
“clothes make the man” (applies to women, too, of
course), then sensors make the robot. In this section,
and the several sections that follow, you’ll find various
types of sensors suitable for use in robotics. Sensors can
be quite expensive, and several high-end variations are
listed. However, most of these sources are affordable.
And, most sensor makers and sellers provide copious
datasheets and application notes about their products,
which you can study as you learn how the various sensor
technologies work.
Note that while some sensor manufacturers will sell
directly to the public, those that do often have mini-
mum-order requirements. 
Also included for reference are Web resources on sen-
sors and sensor technology, how to build homemade
sensors, and how to interface sensors to microcon-
trollers and computers.

Common Robotic Senses
Robots need to sense the world around them in order to interact with it. Without such
senses, they become little more than machines. We have five senses with which to expe-
rience our world: sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste. A robot can be endowed with
any and all of these senses as well.
• Sensitivity to sound is a common sensory system given to robots. The reason: Sound is
easy to detect, and unless you’re trying to listen for a specific kind of sound, circuits for
sound detection are simple and straightforward.
• Sensitivity to light is also common, but the kind of light is usually restricted to a slender
band of infrared, for the purpose of sensing the heat of a fire or for navigating through a
room by way of an invisible light beam. 
• In robotics, the sense of touch is most often confined to collision switches mounted
around the periphery of the machine. On more sophisticated robots, pressure sensors
may be attached to the tips of fingers in the robot’s hands. The more the fingers of the
hand close in around the object, the greater the pressure. 
• The senses of smell and taste aren’t generally implemented in robot systems, though
some security robots designed for industrial use are outfitted with a gas sensor that, in
effect, smells the presence of dangerous toxic gas.
Not all robotic senses are well developed. Robot eyesight is a good example. While
electronic cameras, which can serve as the robot’s eyes, are both affordable and easy to
connect to a computer, the processing of the information from a camera is a complex
task. The visual scene must be electronically rendered and programming must make
sense of the object the robot sees.

Object Detection: The Close, the Far, and the In-between
For robots to be self-sufficient in the human world, they must be able to determine their
environment. They do this by sensing objects, obstacles, and terrain around them. This
can include you, the cat, an old sock, the wall, the little hump on the ground between the
carpet and the kitchen floor, a rock, another robot, a stair, a table leg, and a million other
things. We’ll lump it all under “object detection” and move on.
Robots perform object detection using either contact or noncontact means. Contact
detection is when the robot, or some appendage of the robot, touches the object. Typical
examples are leaf switches with pieces of wires, serving as whiskers, connected to them.
Noncontact detection relies on sensing proximity to an object, without actually touching
that object. This can be done using vision, ultrasonics, infrared light, inductance, capaci-
tance, and many other techniques.
Once an object is detected, collision with it is avoided, or avoided as much as possible.
In the case of contact sensing, the robot has already touched the object, but ideally not in
a way that causes damage to either object or robot. For proximity sensing, the robot may
be inches, feet, or yards away from the object. In any case, the robot “sees” the object,
and then goes about deciding how best to avoid it.
Near- and Far-Object Detection
Proximity detection can be further broken down into two subgroups: near-object and far-
object. The difference is relative and depends on such things as the size and speed of the
robot, the size and speed of the object, and the type of object. For a typical carpet-roving
bot, anything more than 8 to 10 feet away could be considered “far” and is unlikely to be a
major influence on the machine. However, the robot still may need to be aware of the
object’s presence in order to formulate all of its operating plans. 
Conversely, objects that are closer must be dealt with in a more immediate and
aggressive manner. Such objects are within the robot’s immediate sphere of operation.
Detecting them is more critical, because they are the ones the robot will likely bump into
or fall over.
Proximity or Distance?
There are two ways to approach near-object detection: proximity and distance.
• Proximity sensors care only that some object is within a zone of relevance. That is, if an
object is near enough in the physical scene the robot is looking at, the sensor detects it
and triggers the appropriate circuit in the robot. Objects beyond the proximal range of a
sensor are effectively ignored, because they cannot be detected.
• Distance measurement sensors determine the distance between the sensor and what-
ever object is within range. Distance measurement techniques vary; almost all have
notable minimums and maximums. Few yield accurate data if an object is smack-dab
next to the robot; likewise, objects just outside range can yield inaccurate results.

Proximity Detection versus Distance Measurement
Robots employ a number of noncontact methods to determine if an object is nearby
(noncontact meaning nothing on the robot physically touches the object). There are two
forms of noncontact detection, proximity detection and distance measurement.
• Proximity detection. Proximity detection is concerned only that some object is within a
specified zone in front of or around the robot. Proximity simply means “close by”; it
does not take into account how close or far the object is from the robot, nor does it
concern itself with the size of the object. A common nonrobot example of proximity
detection is the automatic security light: Walk in front of the sensor at night, and the
light turns on. 
• Distance (or range) measurement. With distance measurement, detection involves
measuring the physical range between the object and the robot. Depending on the
type of sensor used to measure the distance, relative size of the object may also be
inferred.
Both detection schemes use similar technologies. The most common proximity detec-
tion schemes use infrared light or ultrasonic sound. If enough light (or sound) is reflected
off the object and received back by the robot, then an object is within proximity. 
Distance measurement sensors also use infrared light and ultrasonic sound, but the
mechanisms tend to be more sophisticated. A popular group of sensors made by Sharp
employs what’s know as parallax to measure the distance to an object. In operation,
infrared light is directed at an angle at an object. The light bounces from the object at the
same angle and reenters the sensor. The displacement of the reflected beam indicates
the distance between the sensor and the object. The greater the displacement, the
greater the distance.
Ultrasonic sensors (proximity or ranging) measure the time it takes for a burst of high-
frequency sound to travel from the sensor, strike an object, and return. Though the speed
of sound varies depending on atmospheric conditions (humidity, temperature, and alti-
tude), ultrasonic sensors are surprisingly accurate. The popular Polaroid 6500 sensor and
control board boast a +/- 1% accuracy over the effective range of the sensor, which is 6
inches to 35 feet. A 1% error at 35 feet is less than five inches.

Sensor Beam Spread
Infrared and ultrasonic sensors emit light or sound, respectively, in order to detect nearby
objects. With both sensor types, the further the object is from the sensor, the more the
light or sound spreads by the time it gets there. 
Infrared light is easier to focus into a small beam so that beam spread is minimized.
With proper optics, beam spread over a distance of 10 or 15 feet may be only a few
inches in diameter. This allows infrared sensors to be more selective in the objects they
detect. However, it also requires more stringent alignment and maintenance of the sen-
sor. If the focusing lenses of the sensor are not properly aligned, no object may ever be
detected!
Sound waves can also be focused, but in most ultrasonic sensor applications this is not
required; by its nature, high-frequency sound disperses (spreads) less readily than low-
frequency sound. Even without acoustic focusing, the beam pattern of an ultrasonic sen-
sor such as the Polaroid 6500 is approximately 25 degrees. (The beam pattern also con-
tains nodes to either side of the main beam, but these are at relatively low acoustic
power.)
A narrow beam isn’t always desirable. Sometimes you want the widest spread possi-
ble. In these instances, it’s best not to purposely “defocus” the beam, but to incorporate
several sensors to create an array. The elements in the array are carefully positioned so
that cover is broadened, without excessive overlap.

Odometry: Five Clicks off the Starboard Bow
Odometers measure distance. There’s one in your car, so you know how many miles it is
to the nearest electronics surplus store. Likewise, robots can have odometers. They are
used for two purposes:
• Dead reckoning. Most robots lack the ability to determine their location the same way
humans can (using familiar places and other landmarks). If a robot knows where it is
when it starts, it can use odometry for dead reckoning.
• Speed control. By counting the clicks of an odometer over a specific time period, it’s
possible for a robot to determine its speed. It can then adjust its speed if necessary.
Optical Encoders for Odometry
Perhaps the most common form of robotic odometer is the
optical encoder: a small disc is fashioned around the hub of
a drive wheel or even the shaft of a drive motor. The disc
contains a pattern of slots or dashes and can be used as an
optical encoder. With a reflectance disc, infrared light strikes
the disc and is reflected back to a photodetector. With a
slotted disc, infrared light is alternatively blocked and
passed and is picked up on the other side by a photodetec-
tor. With either method, a pulse is generated each time the
photodetector senses the light.
Magnetic Encoders for Odometry
A magnetic encoder is constructed using a Hall-effect
switch (a semiconductor sensitive to magnetic fields) and
one or more magnets. A pulse is generated each time a magnet passes by the Hall-effect
switch. A variation on the theme uses a metal gear and a special Hall-effect sensor that is
sensitive to the variations in the magnetic influence produced by the gear. 
How Encoders Work
Encoders (optical or magnetic) produce a series of pulses as they turn. The number of
pulses is relative to the distance the robot travels. Suppose a wheel is 3 inches in diame-
ter (that is 9.42 inches in circumference; computed by multiplying the diameter by pi, or
roughly 3.14156). Further suppose the encoder wheel has 32 slots. Dividing the number of
slots into the circumference of the wheel yields the number of pulses the encoder will
produce at each revolution: 0.294 inches of travel (9.42 / 32) for each “tick” of the
encoder. If the robot senses 10 pulses, it knows it has moved 2.94 inches.
Most robots use coaxial drive, with two drive wheels on either side and a supporting
caster on the front and/or the back. With this common arrangement, encoders are
attached to each wheel, so that the robot can determine the distances traveled by both
wheels. This is necessary because the drive wheels of a robot are bound to turn at
slightly different speeds over time. By integrating the results of both optical encoders, it’s
possible to determine where the robot really is, as opposed to where it should be. 
Collecting the Pulses
On robots outfitted with a microcontroller, odometry measurements are best made if the
chip has an onboard pulse accumulator or counter input. These kinds of inputs independ-
ently count the number of pulses received since the last time they were reset and do not

fect. Odometers are far from accurate: wheels slip, especially if the surface is hard and
smooth or in turns. The wheel encoder may register a certain number of pulses, but
because of slip the actual distance of travel will be less. Wheel diameters may change
due to tire pressure and even heat. Such error is referred to as unbounded, because it
can grow—getting worse and worse—the more the robot travels.
If you require absolute accuracy in navigation, it is necessary to combine odometry with
other navigation techniques, such as active beacons, distance mapping, or landmark
recognition.

A shaft encoder.
About Pulse and Quadrature Shaft Encoders
Two common forms of shaft encoders are pulse and quadrature. 
• With a pulse encoder, a single train of digital pulses (high/low/high/low, etc.) is emitted
as the shaft spins. Spin the shaft slowly, the pulses come out slowly. Spin the shaft
quickly, the pulses come out rapid fire.
• With a quadrature encoder, two separate trains of pulses are emitted. These outputs
are called channels. The pulses are timed 90 degrees apart from one another. That is, if
you divide a digital pulse into four equal segments, the pulses from the two channels
will be offset from one another by one of those segments.
The main use of pulse encoders is to measure speed, and they are sometimes called
digital tachometers (analog tachometers output a voltage proportional to the speed of the
shaft). Pulses are emitted whether the shaft is turning forward or backward, and there is
no way of determining the direction of the shaft. 
Quadrature encoders, on the other hand, indicate not only number of pulses per revo-
lution, but direction. This is possible because the pulses from one channel will “lead” the
other, depending on the direction the shaft is turning.
Internally, the quadrature encoder is not that much different from a pulse encoder. The
quad encoder uses a separate sensing element, typically a light-emitting diode and pho-
totransistor in the optical variety. The LEDs and photosensors are mechanically spaced to
produce the 90-degree phase difference required for quadrature encoding.

ear and rotary quadrature and absolute encoders. They
have a variety of models to choose from, and you can
select such options as the number of counts per resolu-
tion or whether an index pulse is generated at each rev-
olution. Encoders are available with standard or heavy-
duty 
bearings, 
depending 
on 
their 
intended
application. 
The company also sells modules, discs, and linear strips
to construct your own encoder. This is not so much to
save money (though it is cheaper than a full encoder),
but it allows you greater flexibility in adding an encoder
to your existing hardware setup. Linear strips are sold
by the inch; discs are sold by diameter and counts per
revolution. 
Additionally, US Digital supplies counter chips and
interface electronics that make it very easy to attach an
encoder to a PC or other controller. Among their inter-
face electronics: 
• AD6—Quadrature encoder to parallel port adapter 
• LS7083—Quadrature encoder to counter
(up/down clock) interface chip 
• LS7166—Quadrature encoder to microprocessor
interface chip 
• A2—Absolute encoder interface to RS232 port 
Application notes and datasheets accompany the inter-
face electronics products (you can download the appli-
cation notes and datasheets and look them over before
you buy). In some cases, sample software is included. A
simple Visual Basic demo accompanies the AD6 parallel
port adapter, for example. Anyone with modest experi-
ence in Visual Basic can adapt the demo to suit their
needs. 
Finally, if you don’t feel like making your own cables,
custom-made cables and connectors can be ordered to
match most any configuration.

GPS for Robotics
There is no cost to use GPS, except for the price of a receiver. For
robotics applications, a GPS receiver can be used to tell the robot
where it is in the world—or even your back yard. A GPS-equipped
robot could be programmed to know that it’s wandered too far
from home. Or, outfitted with a compass, such a robot might be
able to navigate back home.
While GPS for a small mobile robot can be useful, there are
some “gotchas” you need to be aware of. 
• By itself GPS will work only outdoors. The signal from the satellite
is not strong enough to penetrate walls. One way around this
limitation is to use a pseudolite, a receiver that is positioned out-
doors, and which communicates with specially modified
receivers contained inside a building. (Pseudolites can also used
a kind of local-area GPS that covers a building or small areas,
but these are beyond the discussion here.)
• It takes time—up to several minutes—for a GPS receiver to lock
onto the signals from its satellites. Each time the GPS signals are
interrupted, for whatever reason, there may be another 2- to 3-
minute delay to fully reacquire the satellites.
• The orbits of the GPS satellites tend to favor North America and other countries where
the United States has a strategic interest. In such areas, the receiver will almost always
pick up signals from at least three satellites, and often four to eight satellites. But in
some other parts of the world, only one or two satellite signals may be received, and
this is insufficient to provide a fix.

The ABCs of GPS (Global Positioning Satellite)
The global positioning satellite (GPS) system is a means by which someone on the
ground can determine which ground they’re on . . . are they in Kansas City, Kansas, or
Kansas City, Missouri? With GPS, you can know your position on the globe within a few
meters. The system is used by the military, aviation, private industry, even individuals,
such as hikers.
How It Works
GPS is a collection of two dozen satellites that circle the globe in specific orbits. Each
satellite, which spins about 12,000 miles from the earth, contains its own highly accurate
atomic clock. The time, as reported by this clock, is broadcast from the satellite to the
earth. A receiver on the ground picks up the signal from the satellite. To be effective, the
receiver must also pick up the signal from at least two other GPS satellites.
Because each satellite will be at different distances from the ground receiver, it takes a
slightly different time for each signal to reach the receiver. The difference in distance
causes the signal from each satellite to be delayed from one another—like light, radio sig-
nals travel at a known speed, about 186,000 miles per second. 
The position of the receiver on the earth can be accurately determined by correlating
the “timestamps” from each satellite. As each timestamp is received a fraction of a mil-
lisecond after the first one, the delayed timestamps indicate how far away the satellites
are from the receiver. Included with the timestamp from each satellite is the satellites own
position over the earth.
The GPS system is the result of an initiative by the U.S. Department of Defense. When
the first GPS satellite was launched in 1978, the system was off limits to civilian use. That
changed in the 1980s, and today, GPS is regularly used in commerce. For just a few hun-
dred dollars, you can purchase all-in-one GPS receivers. The receiver will indicate your
position in the wilderness to within 10 to 100 meters (usually on the lower side of this
range). You might still get lost, but at least you’ll know where you are!

Things to Know About GPS
GPS is both pricey and temperamental for use in amateur robots. But if you’re seriously
considering it, keep these points in mind:
• Perhaps the easiest way to experiment with GPS is to purchase a developer’s kit,
including a bare-bones GPS module (a module without a display or control buttons).
Cost is $50 to over $200. In most cases, the module connects via a serial link to your
microcontroller or computer.
• Using a consumer-ready GPS product may require hacking to interface it to your micro-
controller or computer.
• GPS modules use a variety of data formats. The NMEA-0183 is an official (but voluntary)
standard, but other proprietary and semiproprietary formats are available as well,
including Rockwell binary, SiRF binary, and Delorme Earthmate.
• Your choice of which module to use depends on what you’re connecting it to and the
availability of software that will understand the data format from the module. When
available, opt for a module supporting NMEA-0183 or a module capable of a number of
data formats.
• Some new GPS receivers incorporate a technology known as Wide Area Augmentation
System, or WAAS, which increases accuracy to about 3 to 5 meters, on average.
• Additionally, certain high-priced GPS receivers use Differential GPS (DGPS), a system
that correlates signals from the GPS satellites with that of known land-based transmit-
ters. DGPS offers accuracy to under 1 meter, but its coverage is limited, usually to
major waterways or aircraft flight patterns.
• GPS satellites for civilian use transmit at 1575.42 MHz, one of two frequencies used by
the GPS system. This frequency is sometimes referred to by its designation L1; L2 is for
military use.
• GPS is best in wide, open, unobstructed areas. Inaccurate results can occur if the sig-
nal bounces off nearby buildings or mountains.

What the Heck Are NMEA Sentences?
Scan through manuals and literature about GPS systems, and you’ll likely read about
“NMEA sentences.” No, this is not some new form of punishment; rather it’s a description
of the data format used in many GPS systems—NMEA-0183 (which is technically a stan-
dard for interfacing marine electronics, not just GPS units).
An NMEA sentence is normal text (alphabetical and numerical characters) sent serially,
at a certain speed (baud rate). Products that use the NMEA-0183 standard know how to
receive, parse, and construct NMEA sentences, so that other compatible gear will under-
stand the data.
An example NMEA sentence looks like this:
$GPRMC,092204.999,A,4250.5589,S,14718.5084,E,0.00,89.68,211200,,*25
This sentence provides position and time information. The commas are used to parse
(separate out) the data, in order to make sense of it.

Measuring Distance with Infrared Sensors
Infrared light sensors use a technique known as parallax to measure distance to an
object. Parallax is the angle between the two straight lines that intersect some object
(near or far) when viewed at two different points of observation. A good example of par-
allax is how a person looking at the moon in Los Angeles sees it in a different portion of
the sky than a person looking at the exact same time in New York. 
The difference in the angles can be computed, and if the distance between observers
is known, then the distance from the observers to the object can be calculated.
For infrared sensors, the technique works using a slightly different approach, but the
concept is the same. A beam of infrared light illuminates a scene. The beam is aimed at
the object at a slight angle. The beam reflects off an object in front of the sensor and
bounces back into the sensor. A rule of physics known as angle of incidence ensures that
the reflected beam is the same angle as the incident beam. 
The reflected beam falls onto a linear array of very small photodetectors. The detectors
are arranged in a long line; the sensor basically detects where on the line the reflected
light strikes. This linear array is connected to internal circuitry that resolves the distance of
the object. The circuitry can provide either a digital or an analog output.
A key maker of infrared distance measurement sensors is Japan-based Sharp. The
sensors are engineered not for amateur robotics (though they are ideally suited for the
tasks), but instead are intended for use in such applications as proximity devices for auto-
mobiles, for paper detection in copiers, and similar mundane tasks.
What’s Available
Depending on the model, the sensors have a minimum
range of about 4 inches (10cm) and a maximum of 31.5
inches (80cm). 
• GP2D02—Digital serial output indicates range as an 8-bit
value. Range is from about 4 inches to 30 inches.
• GP2D05—Digital HIGH/LOW output registers whether an
object is within a preset range. The range can be
adjusted by making an internal adjustment.
• GP2D12—Analog output indicates range as a voltage
level.
• GP2D15—Like the GP2D05, the output triggers when the object is within a certain range
(10 inches).
• GP2Y0D02YK—Similar to the GP2D05, HIGH/LOW output registers whether an object is
within a preset range (31.5 inches).
• GP2Y0A02YK—Extended range version detects objects from 8 to 60 inches.
Refer to the following Web sites for information on the Sharp infrared sensors:
http://www.sharpsma.com/
http://www.sharp.co.jp/ecg/opto/products/
In all cases, the Sharp infrared sensors share better-than-average immunity to ambient
light levels, so you can use them under a variety of lighting conditions (except perhaps
very bright light outdoors). The sensors use a modulated—as opposed to continuous—
infrared beam that helps reject false triggering and makes the system accurate even if
the detected object absorbs or scatters infrared light, such as heavy curtains or dark-col-
ored fabrics.

distance/proximity sensors.

564
Proximity Sensing versus Distance Measuring
Several of the Sharp sensors are for proximity detection rather than distance measure-
ment. These have a 1-bit output that is either HIGH or LOW depending on whether an
object has been detected within a threshold range. 
Your choice of whether to use a proximity sensor or a distance-measuring sensor
depends on your application. If you
• are merely concerned that an object is nearby, use a proximity sensor. The HIGH/LOW
nature of the output of the sensor makes it very easy to use. The GP2D05 sensor can
be modified to alter the proximity threshold distance. The working range is from 4
inches to 30 inches (10cm to 80cm).
• need to detect “far” and “close” proximity, consider adding additional proximity sensors
set at different threshold distances. For instance, one sensor can be set at 70cm to
80cm to detect objects that are relatively far from the robot. Another could be set at
10cm to 12cm to detect those objects that are at the risk of being run into.
• must determine relative distances, then a distance-measuring sensor is needed. Two
options are available: analog output and digital output. Microcontrollers and computer
I/O ports with analog inputs can be used with analog sensors. The sensor provides a
varying voltage in relation to the distance of the object. Digital sensors provide the dis-
tance information in a simple serial data train. Your microcontroller or computer reads
one bit at a time to reconstruct the data. Examples of using both kinds of outputs are
provided by many retail sources that offer the Sharp sensors.
Increasing Field of View
The Sharp sensors are restricted to a fairly narrow field of view and are no wider than
about 16cm at their widest point. To increase the field of view, you can either use multiple
sensors, with slight overlapping coverage, or you can rotate the sensors using an R/C
servo.
For the latter, mount the sensor on a plastic control horn, and attach the horn to the
servo. Under control of your robot, you can scan the servo up to 90 degrees to either
side, thereby taking in an almost 180-degree panoramic view. Avoid taking readings while
the sensor is in motion as you could get spurious results. Instead, stop the servo, then
take the reading.
Controlling Current Consumption
One disadvantage of the Sharp and other IR sensors is that current consumption is rela-
tively high when the sensor is activated. The GP2D02 and GP2D05 sensors are normally
not active; they must be triggered to take a reading by your computer or microcontroller.
When inactive, they draw a miniscule 2 µA (microamps) of current. When active, they
consume about 25 mA, average for a light-emitting diode at regular intensity. The GP2D12
and GP2D15 sensors take continuous readings, so they are always on.
If current consumption is a concern in your robot, opt for an infrared sensor type that
can be turned on and off at will. This reduces unnecessary battery drain. And, since sen-
sors like the Sharp units use modulated light, turning them off when not needed helps
ensure the pulsing light doesn’t interfere with other infrared systems, including remote
control.
Interfacing Jacks and Plugs
One final thought: The Sharp IR proximity and distance-measuring sensors are miniature
devices, and they use a special miniature plug-in connector. When purchasing a Sharp

Photosensitive Elements
You have a variety of photosensitive elements to choose from when
building a robot. The three most common (and most affordable) are the
photoresistor, the phototransistor, and the photodiode.
• Photoresistors. Typically made from cadmium sulfide, and therefore
referred to generically as Cds cells, photoresistors acts like a light-
dependent resistor: The resistance of the cell varies depending on the
intensity of the light striking it. While Cds cells are easy to interface to
other electronics, they are somewhat slow reacting. This can be a ben-
efit when used indoors with AC-operated lights.
• Phototransistors. All semiconductors are sensitive to light, and photo-
transistors exploit this trait. They are basically regular transistors with
their metal or plastic top removed. Unlike Cds cells, phototransistors
are very quick acting, able to sense tens of thousands of flashes of light
per second. The output of a phototransistor is not “linear”; that is, there
is a disproportionate change in the output of a phototransistor as more
and more light strikes it. 
• Photodiodes. A simple form of the transistor, photodiodes are likewise
made with a glass or plastic cover to protect the semiconductor mate-
rial inside them. One common characteristic of most photodiodes is
that their output is rather low, even when fully exposed to bright light.
This means that to be effective the output of the photodiode must usu-
ally be connected to a small amplifier of some type.
Phototransistors

photoresistors
and
photodiodes)

Feeling Is More Than Touch
Consider the human body: It has many kinds of touch receptors embedded within its skin.
Some receptors are sensitive to physical pressure, while others are sensitive to heat.
Similarly, you may wish to add these types of sensors to your robots.
• Heat sensors can detect changes in heat of objects within grasp. Heat sensors are
available in many forms, including thermisters (resistors that change their value
depending on temperature) and solid-state diodes that are specifically made to be
ultrasensitive to changes in temperature.
• Air-pressure sensors can be used to detect physical contact. The sensor is connected
to a flexible tube or bladder (like a balloon); pressure on the tube or bladder causes air
to push into or out of the sensor, thereby triggering it. To be useful, the sensor should
be sensitive down to about 1 pound per square inch, or less.
• Resistive bend sensors, originally designed for use with virtual reality gloves, vary
their resistance depending on the degree of bending. Mount the sensor in a loop,
and you can detect the change in resistance as the loop is deformed by the pressure
of contact.
• Strain gauges measure the stress on parts of the robot. You can mount strain gauges
on the front and back bumpers of a robot, for example, and they will detect when the
‘bot has collided with an object. Strain gauges that detect a DC bias (in other words, a
constant pressure) can be used to determine if the robot remains pressed against an
object. Strain gauges that cannot detect a DC bias (piezoelectric cells are included in
this group) can only determine change between contact and noncontact.
• Microphones and other sound transducers make effective touch sensors.
Microphones, either standard or ultrasonic, can be used to detect sounds that occur
when objects touch (“microphonic conduction,” for the lack of a better term). Mount
the microphone element on the robot. Place a small piece of felt directly under the ele-
ment, and cement it in place using a household glue that sets up hard. Run the leads of
the microphone to a sound trigger circuit. As things move past the sensor, it will pick up
the sound.

Robots That Follow Walls
Mice exhibit a curious behavior: When indoors, they tend to run alongside
the walls, rather than out in the center of the room. This is for their pro-
tection: Mice are prey, and they can be more easily seen in the open.
A common robot experiment is to construct a wall-following “mouse,” a
mechanical rodent that favors walls and even actively seeks them out
before exploring the rest of the room. Most all wall-following robots use a
touch or proximity sensor to detect the wall. There are several common
ways of accomplishing this:
• Whisker contact. The robot uses a mechanical switch, or a stiff wire
that is connected to a switch, to sense contact with the wall. This is by
far the simplest method, but is prone to mechanical damage after a
period of use.
• Noncontact active sensor. The robot uses active proximity sensors,
such as infrared or ultrasonic, to determine distance from the wall. No
physical contact with the wall is needed. In a typical noncontact system,
two sensors are used to judge when the robot is parallel to the wall.
• Noncontact passive sensor. The robot uses passive sensors, such as
linear Hall-effect switches, to judge distance from a specially prepared
wall. In the case of Hall-effect switches, the baseboard or wall might be
outfitted with an electrical wire, through which a low-voltage alternating current is fed.
When in proximity, the sensors will pick up the induced magnetic field provided by the
alternating current. Or, if the baseboard is metal, the Hall-effect sensor (when rigged
with a small magnet on its opposite side) could detect proximity to a wall.
• “Soft-contact.” The robot uses mechanical means to detect contact with the wall, but
the contact is “softened” with the use of pliable materials. For example, a lightweight
foam wheel can be used as a “wall roller.” The benefit of soft contact is that mechanical
failure is reduced or eliminated, because the contact with the wall is through an elastic
or pliable medium.

follow a wall.

Making a Conductive Foam Pressure
Sensor
Besides a microcontroller or computer, sensors tend to be
the most expensive component on a robot. On the cheap
end of the scale are simple touch sensors, which trigger
whenever the robot bumps into something. The typical
touch sensor is made from a switch, which is either open or
closed. The disadvantage of such switch sensors is that
they do not register force. To do that, you need a strain
gauge, load cell, or similar technology, all of which can be
quite expensive.
You can make your own pressure sensor out of a piece
of discarded conductive foam, the stuff used to package
CMOS integrated circuits. The foam is like a resistor. Attach two pieces of wire to either
end of a 1-inch-square hunk and you get a resistance reading on your volt-ohm meter.
Press down on the foam and the resistance lowers. 
The foam comes in many thicknesses and densities. You’ll have best luck with the
semistiff foam that bounces back to shape quickly after squeezing it. The more dense the
foam, the less compliant it is, and the slower it returns to its original shape.
To make a simple pressure sensor, first use transparent tape to attach the stripped end
of a length of 28-30 AWG wire-wrap wire ends to a very thin piece of 1-inch-square
unvarnished aluminum sheet. The sheet can be purchased at most any hobby store and
should be flexible but not as thin as aluminum foil. Make two of these. Be sure the wires
attached to the squares are at least 5 or 6 inches long.
Next, sandwich a piece of conductive foam between the two squares. Wrap up every-
thing in one or two layers of transparent or masking tape. Don’t apply the tape too
thickly.
The interface circuit can be quite simple. The output of the conductive foam is a
resistance, which is lowered when the foam is compressed. A typical RC (resistor-
capacitor) circuit is employed, where the foam sensor is the resistor. This circuit is then
used with a Basic Stamp or other microcontroller; the time it takes for current to dis-
charge through a capacitor is directly related to the resistance R. The Basic Stamp has
a special command for just this, RCtime. A typical RCtime program looks like this:
result
var
word
‘ establish Word-sized variable named result
high 5
‘ bring I/O pin 5 high
pause 1
‘ for one millisecond
rctime 5, 1, result
‘ read value RC charge time
debug ? result
‘ display it on the screen
The Basic Stamp manual provides more details on how to use RCtime, and you’ll want
to experiment with different values of the capacitor C in order to derive meaningful
results.
Note that conductive foam pressure sensors are not linear (their output does not track
the pressure applied), and they are subject to settling times of several seconds to several
minutes. During this settling time, after pressure has been removed, the foam is still
returning to its original thickness. Therefore, it takes longer for the sensor to reset to nor-
mal than it does to register pressure.

Fire Detection with Pyroelectric Sensors
You know about pyroelectric sensors: They are the “magic eye” used in modern motion-
sensitive security lights. The sensor use body heat and motion to detect when a human,
large animal, or alien is nearby. Infrared pyroelectric sensors require both heat and move-
ment to work: Movement alone won’t trigger them, nor will stationary heat. The sensors
are passive—hence the acronym commonly used for them: PIR, for “passive infrared”—
and emit no light or heat radiation of their own.
PIR units are sensitive to the radiation emitted by most fires. If the flame is large
enough, there will be enough movement to trigger the sensor. Small flames, like a ciga-
rette lighter or candle, are not enough to trigger the sensor, unless the flame is very close
by. The larger the fire, the more the flame will flicker and move, and therefore the more
reliable the detection.
Most PIR sensors are designed for security applications, where you want the widest
field of view possible. That field of view is increased with the use of a plastic Fresnel lens,
which is mounted in front of the sensor. For firefighting, a wide field of view not only
increases the possibility of false alarms, but reduces the overall sensitivity of the sensor.
You can increase the sensitivity and decrease the field of view by placing a small plastic
lens (about 25mm or less) over the sensing window. Use a positive diopter lens: Plano
convex or double convex are suitable. Shield the sensor window from stray light.
With a smaller field of view, you may need to “sweep” the room in order for your robot
to see everything around it. You can either move the robot itself, or mount the sensor on
a servomotor. The sweeping must stop periodically in order to take a “room reading.”
Otherwise, the motion of the sensor could trigger false alarms.

Sensing Touch with Piezoelectrics
Pierre and Jacques Curie discovered a new form of electricity just a little more than a
century ago. The two scientists placed a weight on a certain crystal. The strain on the
crystal produced prodigious amounts of electricity. The Curie brothers coined this new
electricity “piezoelectricity”—piezo is derived from the Greek word meaning “press.” 
Later, the Curies discovered that the piezoelectric crystals used in their experi-
ments underwent a physical transformation when voltage was applied to them. Thus,
the piezoelectric phenomenon is a two-way street: Depress press the crystals and
out comes a voltage; apply a voltage to the crystals and they respond by flexing and
contracting.
Piezoelectric materials are commonly used in small speakers and buzzers. The beep-
beep-beep of a wristwatch comes from a tiny piezo annunciator. These are made by
depositing a piezo ceramic material on a thin piece of meal. Yet piezo activity is not con-
fined to brittle ceramics. PVDF, or polyvinylidene fluoride is a semicrystalline polymer that
lends itself to unusual piezoelectric applications. The plastic is pressed into thin, clear
sheets and is given precise piezo properties during manufacture. 
PVDF piezo film is currently in use in many commercial products, including noninduc-
tive guitar pickups, microphones, even solid-state fans for computers and other electri-
cal equipment. One PVDF film you can obtain and experiment with is Kynar, available
directly from the manufacturer, Measurement Specialties. The company sells a variety of
Kynar sensors in single quantities, but (as of this writing) does have a $100 minimum
order.
Kynar piezoelectric film is available in a variety of shapes and sizes. The wafers, which
are about the same thickness as the paper in this book, have two connection points. Like
ceramic discs, these two connection points are used to activate the film with an electrical
signal or to relay pressure on the film as an electrical impulse. 
When purchasing Kynar piezo sensors, opt for the ones with the lead wires already
attached. This makes connecting the sensor to your circuit a lot easier. Measurement
Specialties provides application notes and sample schematics you can follow to interface
the Kynar material to other circuits.
One application of Kynar is as a bend sensor. Attach a strip of Kynar piezo material to a
piece of thin flexible plastic, available at craft stores. Cut the plastic to about 1/2 inch by 6
or 7 inches long. You can use double-sided tape to secure the Kynar to the plastic. Next
secure the plastic to the front of your robot to make a kind of bumper.
When the robot bumps up against something, the plastic will flex, and this in turn bends
the Kynar sensor. The sensor will output a small voltage, which is detected by your
robot’s computer or microcontroller.
Note that as with all piezoelectric materials, the output of Kynar is an AC signal. That is,
it doesn’t produce a voltage and maintain it. Press the bumper, and the sensor outputs a
momentary voltage, even if you keep applying pressure. After a fraction of a second, the
output of the sensor returns to zero volts. Release the bumper so it returns to its natural
shape, and an equal but opposite voltage is produced by the sensor.
PVDF piezo film is available from:

Electronic Compasses: Where on Earth Is Your Robot?
Just like sea and land explorers of old, robots can use magnetic compasses for navigation.
A number of electronic and electromechanical compasses are available for use in hobby
robots. The most basic compasses are accurate to about 45 degrees and provide heading
information (N, S, E, W, SE, SW, NE, NW) by measuring the earth’s magnetic field.
One of the least expensive electronic compasses is the Dinsmore 1490, from Dinsmore
Instrument Company. The 1490 detects the earth’s magnetic field by using miniature Hall-
effect sensors and a rotating compass needle (similar to ordinary compasses). The sen-
sor is said to be internally designed to respond to directional changes similar to a liquid-
filled compass, turning to the indicated direction from a 90-degree displacement in
approximately 2.5 seconds.

of ±3–4 degrees, this compass uses a variety of interface methods, including a digital

Sensors-RFID
Radio frequency identification (RFID) is a kind of sen-
sor that is similar in purpose to bar codes, but it’s meant
to operate over longer distances and even through
other objects. (Emplantable biochips, like the kind
used for pets—and now people—are miniature RFID
units.)
Applications in robotics are both obvious and numer-
ous: You can use RFID for robot-to-robot identification,
robot-to-human identification, navigation, beacon sys-
tems, and more. A benefit of RFID is that the sensitivity
of the reader electronics can be varied so that you can
directly control maximum working distances. In this
way, a room could be full of RFID elements, yet your
robot will only “see” the one closest to it.

tions become available. If nothing else, you can use the

Radio Frequency Identification
RFID, or radio frequency identification, uses small devices that radiate a digital signature
when exposed to a radio frequency signal. RFID is found in products ranging from toys to
employee access cards, to gasoline pump “key fobs” and trucking, to farm animal inven-
tories, automobile manufacturing, and more. 
How They Work
A transmitter/receiver, called the interrogator (also the
reader or host), radiates a low- or medium-frequency car-
rier RF signal. If it is within range, a passive (unpowered) or
active (powered) detector, called a tag or transponder,
reradiates (or “backscatters”) the carrier frequency, along
with a digital signature that uniquely identifies the device.
RFID systems in use today operate on several common RF
bands, including a low-speed 100- to 150-kHz band, typified
by the TIRIS line from Texas Instruments, and a higher 13.5-
MHz band. The tag is composed of an antenna coil along
with an integrated circuit. The radio signal provides power
when used with passive tags, using well-known RF field
induction principles. Inside the integrated circuit are decod-
ing electronics and a small memory. A variety of data transmission schemes are used,
including nonreturn to zero, frequency shift keying, and phase shift keying. Manufacturers
of the RFID devices tend to favor one system over another, depending on the intended
application. Some data modulation schemes are better at long distances, for example.
Why Use RFID?
How can they be used in robotics? Here are a couple of ideas:
• Place RFID tags on multiple robots that are meant to work together. The robots are
able to identify one another as they come in proximity.
• Place RFID tags on people. This would allow a robot, or group of robots, to identify
each person.
• Place RFID tags along baseboards of rooms or doorjambs. As a robot passes by a tag,
it can determine where in a room, even which room, it is currently located.
It is the last idea that holds much promise for amateur robots. Navigating a robot within
a structure or yard is made even more complicated if there are several rooms or areas
that the robot must be kept aware of. RFID tags allow the robot to determine which room
or area it is currently occupying, without resorting to more complicated mapping or image
recognition.
When used for room identification, RFID tags operate as a kind of lighthouse, orienting
the robot as it travels. Besides RFID, there are several other ways to provide active navi-
gation signals to a robot: One is infrared beacons placed strategically in a room or area.
Surprisingly, the advantage of RFID over infrared beacons is that the coverage of the RF
signal is naturally limited. This provides a convenient way to differentiate the areas of a
housebound robotic workspace. 
Memory and Cost
RFID tags have differing amounts of memory, from just a few bytes to several thousand
bytes. Most have 32 to 128 bytes—enough to store a serial number, date, and other lim-
RFID tags reradiate a radio fre-
quency signal, embedding a
unique data code in it.

Sensors-Strain Gauges &
Load Cells
Strain gauge sensors—and their close cousin, the load
cell—are used to measure a variety of physical attrib-
utes, including pressure, torque, tension, and bending.
They are routinely used in commercial products, such
as bathroom scales and automotive digital torque
wrenches. 
Though industrial strain gauges and load cells are quite
expensive (upward of $500 for even a basic unit), there
areanumberofsourcesforlow-previsionsensorsthatare

While RFID systems are not complex, cost is not quite in the superaffordable region
(demonstration and developer’s kits are available from some manufacturers in the $200
to $300 range, and this includes the reader and an assortment of tags). Handheld inter-
rogators cost between $150 and $500; the tags cost under $1 each, but most manufac-
turers want you to buy them in quantity of 250 or more, making RFID an expensive propo-
sition. However, once implemented RFID is a carefree and long-term solution to helping
your robot know where it is.

Strain Gauges
Perhaps the best way to measure physical force is with a strain gauge (and their close
cousin, the load cell), used in weight scales, bridge load sensors, and thousands of other
applications. Strain gauges are somewhat pricey—about $10 and over in quantity—and
they aren’t the kind of thing you can find at the corner Radio Shack. The cost may be off-
set by the increased accuracy the gauges offer. You want a gauge that’s as small as pos-
sible, preferably one mounted on a flexible membrane.
For robots, strain gauges can be used as collision detectors, as touch pads for grip-
pers and legs, and as position sensors for arms, among other applications.

Sensors for Tilt Measurement
A common means of providing a robot with a sense of balance is with a tilt sensor or tilt
switch. The sensor or switch measures the relative angle of the robot with respect to the
center of the earth. If the robot tips over, the angle of the sensor/switch changes, and this
can be detected by electronics in the robot. Tilt sensors and switches come in various
forms and packages. Common varieties include:
• Mercury-filled glass ampoules that form a simple on/off switch. When the tilt switch is in
one position (say, horizontal), the liquid mercury metal touches contacts inside the
ampoule, and the switch is closed. But when the switch is rotated to vertical, the mer-
cury no longer touches the contacts, and the switch is open. The major disadvantage
to mercury tilt switches is the mercury itself, which is a highly toxic metal.
• Ball-in-cage all-mechanical switches are popular in pinball machines and other devices
were small changes in level are required. The switch is a square or round capsule, with
a metal ball inside. Inside the capsule are two or more electrical contacts. The weight
of the ball makes it touch the electrical contacts, which forms a switch. The capsule
may have multiple contacts, to measure tilt in all directions.
• Electronic spirit level sensors use the common fluid bubble, along with some interfacing
electronics. A spirit level is the same kind you see in ordinary levels at the hardware store:
It’s merely a glass tube filled, but not to capacity, with water or some other fluid. A bubble
forms at the top of the tube since it isn’t completely filled. Because of gravity, titling the tube
makes the bubble slosh back and forth. An optical sensor—an infrared LED and detector,
for example—can be used to measure the relative size and position of the bubble.
• Electrolytic tilt sensors are like mercury switches, but are more complex and a lot more
costly. In an electrolytic tilt sensor a glass ampoule is filled with a special electrolyte liq-
uid—a liquid that conducts electricity, but in very measured amounts. As the switch tilts,
the electrolyte in the ampoule sloshes around, changing the conductivity between two
(or more) metal contacts.
• Accelerometers, which can electronically detect the pull of the earth’s gravity. The lat-
est accelerometers are available on a single integrated circuit, making them small and
relatively inexpensive.

sensors-tilt & accelerometer 579
What’s an Accelerometer?
An accelerometer is a device that measures change in speed. Accelerometers are used
in vehicles, rockets, even elevators. Put an accelerometer in a car, for example, and step
on the gas. The device will measure the increase or decrease in speed. Most accelerom-
eters only measure acceleration (or deceleration) and not constant speed or velocity.
Velocity information can be derived from acceleration data, however.
Although designed to measure changes in speed, many types of accelerometers are
also sensitive to the constant pull of the earth’s gravity. This type of accelerometer can
used to measure the tilt of a robot. This tilt is represented by a change in the gravitational
forces acting on the sensor. The output of the accelerometer is either a voltage, or it can
be a digital signal that indicates the relative acceleration at any given moment.
Analog Devices ADXL202 Accelerometer
Analog Devices is a semiconductor maker of primarily
industrial and military-grade operational amplifiers, digital-
to-analog and analog-to-digital converters, and motion con-
trol products. One of their key product lines is ADXL line of
accelerometers, which uses a patented fabrication process
to create a series of near-microscopic mechanical beam.
This “micromachining” involves etching material out of a
substrate. During acceleration, the beam is distended along
its length. This distention changes the capacitance in nearby
plates. The change in capacitance correlates as accelera-
tion and deceleration.
In addition to the mechanical portions of the accelerome-
ter, all the basic interface circuitry is part of the device. In
fact, looking at one of the ADXL accelerometers, you’d think they were just integrated cir-
cuits of some type. Because the basic circuitry is included as part of the accelerometer,
only a minimum number of external parts are needed. 
Analog Devices makes a lower-cost line of accelerometers specifically designed for
consumer products. Their ADXL202 is a dual-axis device with a +/- 2 g sensitivity (if you
need more g’s, check out the ADXL210, which is rated at +/- 10 g’s). The ADXL202 has a
simplified output: As acceleration changes, the timing of the pulses at the output of the
device changes. This change can be readily determined by a PC or microcontroller that
measures the length of the pulse. 
The ADXL202 is a surface-mount component, so if you want to use it with a regular proto-
typing board or solderless breadboard, you’ll need to solder it to a carrier, then attach the car-
rier to the rest of your chip. Analog also sells a handy evaluation board with an ADXL202 and a
standard 0.100-inch header for easy attaching to standard breadboards and solder boards.
Analog provides a datasheet and application notes on using the ADXL202 and provides
links to resellers of the chip on their Web site (you can also buy some products directly
from the company):

Piezo Gyros for Inertial Navigation
The same physics that keep a bicycle upright when its wheels are in motion can be used
to provide motion data to a robot. Consider a bicycle wheel spinning in front of you while
you hold the axle between your hands. Turn sideways, and the wheel tilts. This is the
gyroscopic effect in action; the angle of the wheel is directly proportion to the amount and
time you are turning. Put a gyroscope in an airplane or ship and even imperceptible
changes in movement can be recorded, assuming the use of a precision gyroscope. 
Gyros are still used in airplanes today, even with radar, ground controllers, and radios
to guide the way. While many modern aircraft have substituted mechanical gyros with
completely electronic ones, the concept is the same: During flight, any changes in direc-
tion are recorded by the inertial guidance system in the plane (there are three gyros, one
for each of the three axes). Any time during the flight the course of the plane can be scru-
tinized by looking at the output of the gyroscopes. 
Inertial guidance systems for planes, ships, missiles, and other such devices are far, far
too expensive for robots. However, there are some low-cost gyros that provide modest
accuracies. One reasonably affordable model is the Max Products MX-9100 micro piezo
gyro, often used in model helicopters. The MX-9100 uses a piezoelectric transducer to
sense motion; this motion is converted to a digital signal whose duty cycle changes in
proportion to the rate of change in the gyro.

Ultrasonic Distance Measurement
In 1947 American test pilot Chuck Yeager broke the sound barrier. The plane he was fly-
ing, Glamorous Glennis (today on exhibit at the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C.) flew
faster than sound waves can travel through the air.
Sound travels at about 1,130 feet per second at sea level. While temperature, humidity,
and atmospheric pressure change the speed of sound, for general purposes we can con-
sider it a constant and use it for distance measurement. For years, the fancier Polaroid
instant cameras used an ultrasonic focusing system to ensure clear, sharp pictures. Their
ultrasonic system worked so well the company was able to make a tidy extra profit on sell-
ing the sensors to other manufacturers (Polaroid recently sold the ultrasonic business unit).
Theory of Operation
To measure distance, a short burst of ultrasonic sound—usu-
ally 40 kHz for most ultrasonic ranging systems—is sent out
through a transducer (essentially a fancy term for a speaker).
The sound bounces off an object, and the echo is received by
another transducer (this one a specially built ultrasonic micro-
phone). A circuit them computes the time it took between the
transmit pulse and the echo and comes up with distance. 
Given a speed of 1,130 feet per second (about 344
meters per second), the time it takes for the echo to be
received is in microseconds if the object is within a few
inches or feet of the robot. Though a few microseconds is a
short period of time on the human scale, it’s no problem for
modern fast-acting CMOS and TTL ICs. 
Given a travel time of 13,560 inches per second for sound, it takes 73.7 microseconds
(0.0000737 seconds) for sound to travel 1 inch. Or if using centimeters, sound travels 34,442.4
centimeters per second, or 29.03 microseconds per centimeter. In any ultrasonic ranging sys-
tem, the total transit time between transmit pulse and echo is divided by two, to compensate for
the round-trip travel time between the robot and the object. To calculate in inches, the remaining
value is divided by 73.7 (for inches) or 29.03 (for centimeters) to determine the distance.
Maximum and Minimum Ranges
Sound waves eventually dissipate, so there is a maximum range you can expect from
your ultrasonic distance measurement sensor (the range is reduced even more outdoors,
where wind disperses sound waves). The maximum distance of the Polaroid ultrasonic
transducer is about 35 feet when used indoors, and a little less when used outdoors,
especially on windy days. Other ultrasonic sensors have the same, or even less, maxi-
mum range. A range of 3 to 6 meters is usually adequate for robotics, where it is not nec-
essary to detect objects outside the immediate field of interest.
Likewise, ultrasonic systems exhibit minimum working distances. Because the Polaroid
ultrasonic transducer is used for both transmitting and receiving, its minimum distance is
6 inches. The reason: The ranging board cannot listen to sound echoes until the transmit
phase is complete. The transducer continues to vibrate slightly for a short period after
sending a pulse of ultrasonic sound. During this “blanking” period, which is required to
eliminate false readings, return echoes are ignored.
Ultrasonic sensors that use separate transmit and receive transducers do not require a
blanking period, as long as the transducers are microphonically isolated (that is, mechani-
cal vibrations from the transmitter are not picked up by the receiver). Minimum working
distances can be effectively reduced to about an inch.
Ultrasonic sensors use the
speed of sound to measure
distance.

Sonar Transducers: Buying New or Hacking Old
There are a variety of ways to implement ultrasonic ranging:
• Purchase a ready-made non-Polaroid sonar ranging system, such as the SRF08 and
SRF04 from Hobby-Electronics.com. The SFR04 requires your robot to calculate transit
time of the ultrasonic pulse; the SRF08 handles all calculations for you and returns the
result as a digital value.
• Purchase a ready-made Polaroid 6500 sonar ranging system. Sources include
Acroname.com and RobotStore.com. The 6500 consists of a gold-plated Polaroid ultra-
sonic sensor and a driving board, as well as engineering notes and application sheets.
• Purchase transducers and build your own ultrasonic distance board. Matched sensors
are available from a number of sources, including Jameco, Marlin P. Jones, B.G. Micro,
and All Electronics. They are relatively inexpensive (usually under $5 for the pair). You
need a circuit to provide 40 kHz to the transmitter, and another to amplify and lock onto
the 40-kHz signal from the receiver.
• Salvage a sonar ranging system from a used Polaroid camera, such as the Sun 660.
These use sensor boards similar, but not identical, to the Polaroid 6500. Using the
sources provided in this article, you can hack the ranging board and connect it to any
of a number of microcontrollers. The ranging board requires its own 6-volt supply.

” Supplies-Casting & Mold
Making
Casting and mold making aren’t skills shared by most
robot builders, but they should be. With little training,
and only a few dollars in materials, you can produce
your own parts for your robo-creations. The process is
simple enough: Use plaster or some other material to
create a mold from an existing element. One possibility
is hubs for wheels. As long as you have one hub for the
model, you can make additional ones as needed. The
hub can be something you’ve purchased, retrofitted
from some other item, or custom made using wood,
metal, or plastic.
After the mold has dried and cured, you can then cast
parts from it. Casting can be made using hard or soft
rubber, even certain low-temperature metals. 
The benefits of casting are twofold: First, you can save
money by making your own parts. Buying new sprock-
ets, gears, wheel hubs, and other components can get
expensive. Once you make a mold, each casting might
cost only 25 cents each, depending on the material-
obviously, some casting materials are more expensive
than others, but overall, it’s pretty inexpensive stuff.
Second, you can “mass-produce” unique items, rather
than hand-make them one at a time. You need only
build one model, then make duplicates with casting.
This section lists resources concerned with casting and
mold making, including materials and instruction. In
addition to the casting arts, this section also includes
sources for vacuum forming, which is a process of mak-
ing molded shapes with thin plastic sheets.

Steps to Casting in Plastic
Casting is a method of creating parts from a master mold. Casting can save you time and
money and, if done right, can produce a superior-looking product. Let’s say you need to
produce 12 sets of servo mounts for your six-legged hexapod robot. You’ll need two sep-
arate pieces for each servo, making for a total of 24 mounts. You could cut and drill them
all, and maybe end up with something respectable. But another approach is to cast them
using liquid plastic. Do it right, and you never have to cut or drill anything.
Or, suppose you need two #25 chain sprockets, but only have one in your parts bin.
With that one sprocket—the “model”—you can make as many duplicates as you like.
Casting can be helpful if you’re on a tight budget or can’t wait a week or two to order a
part.
Casting an object in plastic is not difficult, but it can be time-consuming. The general
steps are to create the mold, then create the casting. But of course, there’s a bit more to
it than that. Here’s an overview.
Create the Mold
All castings require a mold of some type. If a mold doesn’t yet exist, you will need to
make one from a model. The most common molds are made of plaster (also known as
plaster of paris), which you can purchase at any arts and craft store. Specialty plasters,
such as dental plaster (examples: Hydrocal and Die-Keen), are available from mail-order
outlets. The mold is produced by glopping the semiliquid plaster over the model and let-
ting it dry.
Plaster molds are either one-piece of two-piece. A one-piece mold has just one half
and is suited for objects where only the front side need be cast because the final object is
meant to be placed against a flat panel (examples are decorative trim or some kind of flat
hood ornament for your robot). A two-piece mold has a front and back and is meant to
cast a stand-alone figure.
Other mold materials exist, of course, and are better suited than plaster for some
tasks. Plaster molds can’t have any “undercuts” because the plaster dries hard and stiff.
The more the model is irregularly shaped, the more you will need to use a flexible mold
material, such as latex. Latex molds do not hold their shape for the casting step, how-
ever, and need to be reinforced with a plaster “mother mold.” In all, making latex and
other flexible molds takes extra time.
Create the Casting
A casting is made by pouring a liquid or semiliquid material into the mold and letting the
material set up and cure. Some casting materials, like hot melt (very much like hot glue),
set up when they cool. These are the fastest to work with. Others, like urethane resin,
require a chemical change that can take several hours or even overnight.
Most liquid plastics (like urethane) for casting are composed of two parts: the main
plastic resin, and a catalyst. Separately, the materials will never harden to produce a fin-
ished plastic piece. When mixed, a chemical reaction causes curing that results in hard-
ening. The catalyst must be added to the plastic in just the right amounts, or the casting
will be ruined. The mixture is either by weight or by volume; each manufacturer provides
an instruction sheet that you should follow to the letter.
Depending on the materials you use, you may need to apply what’s known as mold
release before pouring in the liquid casting gloop. Petroleum jelly is common for plaster
molds, though there are also thinner sprays available that create less mess. It is critical
that the mold release be compatible with both the mold and casting materials, or else the
casting may never fully cure.

Wait, Wait, Then Wait Some More
The single greatest error made by beginners to the mold-making and casting art is trying to
rush things. It can take a day or two between start and finish to complete a casting, espe-
cially if a mold is also required. And, depending on the casting materials you use, a plaster
mold will need extra time—days or even weeks—for the water in the plaster to dry out. 
(However, some moisture is good, as it keeps the mold from becoming too brittle. You
may actually have to add water to your molds periodically, especially if you cast with ure-
thane resins, which draw out moisture as they cure.)
Trying to rush things will result in a poor casting that either never cures (it remains soft
and sticky), comes out of the mold in pieces, or is too brittle. If you take your time, you’ll
find your casting results will be up there with the pros.
Safety and Respirator Masks
Materials used for mold making and casting vary from harmless dust producers to downright
carcinogens. You must exercise care when working with mold-making and casting materials
and remember to wear a respirator mask, safety goggles, and, if necessary, gloves.
Plaster for molds presents little danger, except that you should never use it to make a
mold of an arm, leg, or other body part (yours or someone else’s). Plaster cures by pro-
ducing heat, and this heat can burn skin. Urethane and fiberglass resins should always be
used in a well-ventilated area. Never try to cast plastic in a closed room, and advise oth-
ers that they may need to leave for a while.
Smoking is a no-no while working with molds and casting, and keep all ingredients
away from open flames. Some casting materials require heating (this is the case with hot
melt); use an electric double-boiler or hot plate to heat the material. Don’t use an oven or
range that uses gas and produces an open flame.

Freeman sells materials for machine tooling, including
machineable wax, a kind of hard wax that is used for
creating prototypes using a mill or lathe. The wax melts
at about 225 degrees and can be “cast” in most any
shape. It can then be routed, milled, or lathed into
complex machine parts. The resulting wax piece isn’t
strong enough for a heavy-duty combot, but sometimes
can be used for smaller parts on lighter robots. And, of
course, you can always use machineable wax for its
intended purpose: Create a quick sample in wax, before
spending the time and expense doing it in metal. 
In addition to machineable wax, Freeman sells high-
quality wood laminates (particle board, Armorboard,
and so forth), casting urethanes for machining, and
machining accessories.

Fiberglass Casting Tape
If you’ve ever broken an arm or leg, the doctor probably gave you a fiberglass cast.
Rather than getting out sheets of fiberglass matting and mixing resin and catalyst in a big
jug, the doctor likely just ripped open a package of presoaked fiberglass tape and started
wrapping around the broken body part. The material cures in a matter of minutes.
The benefit of using presoaked fiberglass tape is obvious, and ease of use is at the top
of the list. The same casting tape is available to mere mortals. You can use it to build
robust robot bodies and even to repair ones that get damaged.
3M Scotchcast is a popular casting tape available from medical supply companies. The
tape is dipped in water to activate it. It can be cut with scissors (before or after dipping
into water) and can be worked into the desired shape over a period of several minutes
before it begins to harden. Casting gloves are recommended because the tape gets
sticky, and the urethane resin is a skin irritant. The tape is available in widths from 2 to 5
inches.
Scotchcast is made for use with both humans and animals. Veterinary casting supplies
are often cheaper. Try the following Google.com search phrases to locate suppliers of

Selecting the Right Plastic Casting Resin
There are plenty of plastic casting resins to choose from. The more you cast your own
parts, the more you’ll discover which casting resins are best suited for the work you do.
(And also such important things as which ones stink less.)
Here’s a short rundown of several popular products and manufacturers. Browse each
company’s Web site to discover the ancillary products that might be of use to you, such
as curing additives (these slow down or speed up curing), colorants, additives to change
the texture and hardness of the final casting, and much more.

For example, take their “UV Invisible on White” paint.
It looks white in normal light, but glows brightly under
ultraviolet light. Combine this paint with a UV LED
(available at Hosfelt, Marlin P Jones & Associates,
among other sources), and a UV detector, such as those
for testing money. With this setup you could create a
unique line-following robot that appears to follow an
invisible track on a white painted table. Or, use the

Wormy Plastic
The early plastic catches the worm? In the land of fishing and fishing lures, it can. Worm
plastic is a make-it-yourself process that uses a special liquid plastic; the plastic cures
with the application of 350- to 400-degree heat. The liquid is called worm plastic because
it is used to make fishing worm lures, but it has a number of other applications as well.
When cured, the plastic is soft and somewhat rubbery; additives can be used to make
it even softer or to harden it up. Worm plastic can be used with simple molds to make
shapes, and since it is milky clear, it can be colored with reds, blues, greens, and other
hues. Other additives are used for fishing applications to give the lures a scent, but you’ll
probably want to skip those.
Worm plastic is available at the better fishing bait and lure shops, as well as on the
Web. Here are a couple of specialty Web sites that carry or discuss worm plastic, col-
orants, and various additives:

Using Hot Glue
All glues take time to “set.” For most glues, the longer the setting time, the stronger the bond.
That’s why a 30-minute epoxy is better, all things considered, than a 5-minute epoxy. But the
problem with slow-setting glues is that you either need to clamp the pieces together while
the joint hardens or sit there holding everything in place. For some jobs, neither is practical.
Enter hot-melt glue. Hot-melt glue is like a sticky wax. It melts at temperatures of 250 to
400 degrees and congeals as it cools. The cooling process doesn’t take long—under a
minute—and the glued joint is already strong. Additional strength comes as the glue cures,
but the pieces are already securely held together. For most tasks, no clamping is necessary.
You need only a hot glue “gun” and glue sticks; both are available at hobby stores, arts
and crafts stores, and most home improvement stores. Cost is under $20 for the pair.
You can get a regular-size glue gun for bigger household jobs, but for most robotics
applications, the small “craft” gun is all you need. They’re cheaper, too.
The glue is heated to a viscous state in a glue gun, then spread out over the area to be
bonded. Glue sticks are available in “normal” and low-temperature forms; the low-tem-
perature glue is better with most plastics, to avoid any “sagging” or softening of the plas-
tic due to the heat of the glue.
Tip: Before gluing, rough up the plastic surfaces to be bonded. Plastics with a smooth
surface will not adhere well when using hot-melt glue, and the joint will be brittle and
might break off with only minor pressure.
Finally, using a hot-melt glue gun is easier when the weather is warm. In cold weather,
the glue sets very quickly. If it’s cold out, move the project indoors. It’ll give you a few
more seconds to position the pieces together before the glue sets up.

Hot Glue Cautions
Though the hot-melt glue is not heated to dangerous temperatures, it’s still rather
uncomfortable to have a dollop of melting ooze land on your arm or leg. Exercise care
when using the glue gun, and keep it away from children. The low-temperature gun and
glue sticks are safer (though the glue resets more quickly), but can still burn skin.

Testors is a major manufacturer of paint and painting
products for the hobby model industry (they also sell
plastic models, but that’s not of as much interest to us).
Testors paints are formulated to adhere well to many
kinds of plastics; I’ve found they are about the best
paint for PVC plastic. Once dried and cured (about a
day), the paint is not prone to scratching or peeling.
Testors also sells tools, painting supplies, and inexpen-
sive airbrushes. 
The company sells most of their wares through local
hobby retailers but also sells online. 
On a personal note, I once wrote a beginner’s book
for Testors on hobby model building, which they
included in some of their paint kits. They no longer
sell it, but it talked all about how to assemble and

Picking a Good Volt-Ohm Meter
Besides a screwdriver, the most important tool to the robot builder is the
volt-ohm meter. This device is also called a multitester, and for good rea-
son: It’s used to test all sorts of electrical levels and conditions, including
voltage, shorts, and open circuits. This moderately priced tool is a basic
requirement for working with electronic circuits of any kind. 
Digital or Analog
There are two general types of meters available today: digital and analog.
The older analog style, which is still preferred by some users, incorpo-
rates a mechanical movement with a needle that points to a set of gradu-
ated scales. Digital meters display measured values in a digital readout.
Analog meters are hard to find, and the digital variety tend to be cheaper,
so we’ll concentrate on the digital models from here on out.
Which Functions?
Digital meters vary greatly in the number and type of functions they pro-
vide. Features include:
AC volts
Standard feature
DC volts
Standard feature
Milliamps
Standard feature
Ohms
Standard feature
Audible continuity
Common optional feature
Diode check
Common optional feature
Capacitance
Optional; found in some models
Transistor
Optional; found in some models
The maximum ratings of the meter when measuring volts, milliamps, and resistance
also vary. For most applications, the following maximum ratings are more than adequate:
DC volts
1,000 volts
AC volts
500 volts
DC current
200 milliamps
Resistance
2 megohms

Do You Need an Oscilloscope?
For serious work in electronics, an oscilloscope is an
invaluable tool. Priced at $300 and above, an oscilloscope
allows you to perform tests that a volt-ohm meter simply
cannot do. Among the many applications of an oscillo-
scope are:
• Test DC or AC voltage levels
• Analyze the waveforms of digital and analog circuits
• Determine the operating frequency of digital, analog, and
RF circuits
• Test logic levels
• Visually check the timing of a circuit, to see if things are happening in the correct order
and at the prescribed time intervals 
A basic, no-nonsense dual-trace (two-channel) model, with a 20- to 25-MHz maximum
input frequency, is adequate. Don’t settle for the cheap, single-trace units. The two chan-
nels let you monitor two lines at once, so you can easily compare the input signal and
output signal at the same time. While not absolutely necessary, most expensive scopes
come with storage or delayed sweep, and these can be handy features for more com-
plex testing chores.
You can save some money buying used. The desirable Tektronics and Hewlett-Packard
brand oscilloscopes are routinely available at eBay and other online auctions. As always,
be careful what you buy. Older scopes are expensive to repair, so make sure you get one
that is guaranteed to work.
You may also wish to get a PC-based oscilloscope. The better ones tend to be
fairly expensive, and, of course, they all require the use of a compatible personal
computer.
Oscilloscope Resolution 
Resolution refers to the accuracy of the scope. Resolution is measured in bandwidth and
vertical sensitivity (there are other factors that contribute to the resolution of an oscillo-
scope, but they are beyond the scope—no pun intended—of this discussion). The band-
width of the scope is expressed in megahertz (MHz) and is the fastest signal that can be
accurately displayed. Vertical sensitivity indicates the Y-axis resolution. The low-voltage
sensitivity of most average-priced scopes is about 5 mV; higher-priced scopes provide 1-
to 2-mV sensitivity. Note that voltage levels lower than this voltage may appear, but they
cannot be accurately measured.

The Value of Good Scope Probes
The probes used with oscilloscopes are not just wires with clips on the end of them. To
be effective, the better scope probes use low-capacitance/low-resistance shielded wire
and a capacitive-compensated tip—these ensure better accuracy. 
Most scope probes are passive, meaning that they employ a simple circuit of capaci-
tors and resistors to compensate for the effects of capacitive and resistive loading. Many
passive probes are switchable between 1x and 10x. At the 1x setting, the probe passes
the signal without attenuation (weakening). At the 10x setting, the probe reduces the sig-
nal strength by 10 times. This allows you to test a signal that might otherwise overload the
scope’s circuits. 
Active probes use operational amplifiers or other powered circuitry to correct for the
effects of capacitive and resistive loading and to vary the attenuation of the signal. The
following table shows the typical specifications of passive and active oscilloscope probes. 
Probe Type
Frequency Range
Resistive Load
Capacitive Load 
Passive 1x
dc - 5 MHz
1 megohm
30 pF
Passive 10x

Logic Probes and Logic Pulsers
Logic probes are designed to indicate the logic state of a particular circuit line. One LED
on the probe lights up if the logic is 0 (LOW), another LED lights up if the logic is 1
(HIGH). Most probes have a built-in buzzer that has a different tone for the two logic
levels.
A third LED or tone may indicate a pulsing signal. A good logic probe can detect that
a circuit line is pulsing at speeds of up to 10 MHz. That’s fast enough for robot work.
The minimum detectable pulse width (the time the pulse remains at one level) is 50
nanoseconds.
A handy troubleshooting accessory when working with digital circuits is the logic pulser.
This device puts out a timed pulse, letting you see the effect of the pulse on a digital cir-
cuit. Normally, you’d use the pulser with a logic probe or an oscilloscope. The pulser is
switchable between one pulse and continuous pulsing.

Meter Supplies
Your meter will come with a pair of test leads—one black and one red. The leads are ter-
minated with needle-like metal probes. Quality of the test leads included with the lower-
cost meters is usually minimal, so consider purchasing a better set. Coiled leads are
handy; they stretch out to several feet yet recoil to a manageable length when not in use. 
Standard leads are fine for most routine testing, but some measurements may require
the use of a clip lead. These attach to the end of the regular test leads and have a spring-
loaded clip on the end. You can clip the lead in place so your hands are free to do other
things. The clips are insulated to prevent short circuits.

& Tools
While it’s possible to build a robot with just a screw-
driver, the job is made easier with various hand and
power tools common to all construction. You don’t
need a shed full of tools—just the basics will do. The
resources in this section, and the ones to follow, pro-
vide listings of several dozen hand and power tool mak-
ers and retailers. If you choose to augment your main
work tools with specialty machinery, such as mills,
lathes, and even computer-controlled routers, then
that’s covered, too.
In this main Tools section are resources for general
tools, including power and hand tools, as well as tool
accessories. The sections that follow break out different
types of tools and products and list additional resources
you’ll want to know about.

& Tools-CNC
CNC stands for “computer numeric controlled,” a
process whereby a computer controls the operation of a
machine tool, such as a lathe or mill. Once the domain
solely of well-heeled industrial factories, CNC tools are
now affordable by even budget-minded hobbyists. The
listings in this section are resources for desktop CNC
power tools. Many come complete with the necessary
software to construct 3D parts. This section also lists
resources for CNC software.
For a CNC mill, three stepper or servomotors are used
to control the X, Y, and Z axes. (For the uninitiated, a
mill is like a drill press, except that the work piece can
be moved in two planes.) For a CNC lathe, two stepper
or servomotors are used, one for horizontal tool posi-
tion, and one for tool depth. Additionally, the lathe
motor may be computer controlled.
A third type of CNC tool is the router. These serve a
similar purpose as the mill, but use a routing tool to
carve or cut out pieces in larger sheets of material. Like
the mill, the CNC router uses three motors, one each
for the X, Y, and Z axes.
Some additional acronyms you should know:
• CAD means “computer-aided design,” the software
used to create accurate models of 3D objects
• CAM means “computer-aided manufacture,” the
software that makes a CAD drawing and operates a
CNC machine to produce the final part.
• DXF is a popular file format created by CAD pro-
grams; many CAD programs can share files in this
format.
• G-Code is a popular machine-level output format
that instructs the motors of a mill or lathe to move
to specific positions.

CNC Routers
For the robotics hobbyist with a bit of extra spending cash,
a computer numerically controlled (CNC) router will have
you building all sorts of bots in record time. A CNC router
combines a high-speed motorized cutting tool (the router)
with computer-controlled movement. This movement is
controllable in three planes: X, Y, and Z. 
To use, you first secure a piece of wood, plastic, metal,
foam, or other material onto the base of the device. You
then program the “moves” the router will take over the
material. For example, if you’re cutting out a shape, the
router will first move downward (the Z axis) to drill into the
material, then move back and forth (the X and Y axes) to
cut out the shape.
Depending on the routing tool used in the machine, you
might also be able to mill parts out of softer materials, like
plastics and soft woods. (For metals and other hard materi-
als, a mill is the better choice, as it has more cutting power.) When milling on a CNC router,
the Z axis of the router is varied ever so slightly, in order to produce a 3D cut surface.
While CNC routers are simple in principle, they are not cheap in cost. The typical CNC
router package for hobbyist use costs $2,000 and more. Prices go up from there, with
$5,000 being typical for an entry-level professional model.
The design of the typical CNC router is the gantry: The gantry slides back and forth,
and is the X axis. Attached to the gantry is a Z-axis plate, which moves up and down; the
router tool is physically attached to this. Depending on the design of the machine, the Y
axis is produced by either moving the entire gantry or by moving the work piece itself.
The latter is probably more common in the smaller “desktop” CNC machines—the ones
most suitable, in size and price, for the amateur robot builder.
The travel distances of the three axes define the maxi-
mum size of material you can work with. A small CNC router
may be limited to a 12 by 12-inch piece of material, and with
a maximum thickness of 2 or 3 inches. When comparing
CNC routers, check the extents of the X, Y, and Z axes, and
be sure they will be adequate for your needs.
You’ll want to verify that these are travel extents (the tool
actually travels this distance to cut) and not merely the
maximum dimensions of the material you can fit into the
machine. A given CNC router may be able to accept mate-
rial up to 12 by 12 inches, but may only be able to cut out a
shape of 8 by 11 inches.
The movement along the three axes of the CNC router is
performed by a stepper motor (less common is the servomotor, which adds considerably
to the cost of the machine). The stepper motor drives the mechanics of the CNC router
via an acme screw, ballscrew, trapezoidal leadscrew, rack and pinion gear, belt, or chain.
I’ll let the manufacturers tout the pros of their specific systems, but in the end, you’ll want
to ensure your machine has the repeatable accuracy you need for your work. Any CNC
machine with a repeatable accuracy of less than 0.010 inch is not worth your investment.
Note the term repeatable above. Some CNC router vendors list the positioning accu-
racy of the stepper (or servo) motor. This is not the same as the repeatability of the cut-
ting tool; the latter takes into consideration the flatness of the worktable, the type of
drive mechanism, the effects of backlash as the tool moves back and forth, and other
variables.
Gantry designs are typical of
CNC routers.
The router cuts and mills
material by moving either the
tool, the material, or both.

One simple way to test the accuracy of a CNC router is to
replace the router tool with a fine-tipped felt pen. Securely
tape a piece of paper to the worktable and have the router
draw a shape—such as the figure of a dog or person—onto
the paper. Do it twice. Carefully examine the drawing: You
should not see two “double traces” anywhere. If you do (it’ll
likely be at the corners or intersections of lines), that router
lacks sufficient accuracy.
When purchasing a CNC router, consider the software
you will use with the machine. Many commercially made
CNC routers come with software; others don’t. CNC soft-
ware can cost several hundred, to several thousand, dol-
lars; if your machine lacks software, be sure to add this cost
to the final price. (Note: Most CNC routers can be used with
software from a variety of vendors, but it’s still good to
make sure yours doesn’t use some proprietary control
technique that limits your choices.)
Finally, if the cost of a ready-made CNC router is too rich for your blood, you might
want to consider making your own. It’s not quite as easy as some Web sites and maga-
zine ads make it out to be, but you can save 40 to 60% by going the DIY route.
Stepper motors provide exact
movement of the router for
precision cuts.

Construction Tools You Need
If you’re fashioning your own robot frame and other mechanical parts, you need tools to
cut, saw, punch, ream, file, and fasten. These are the tools you can’t do without:
• Claw hammer, used for just about anything you can think of.
• Rubber mallet, for gently bashing pieces together that resist going together; also for
forming sheet metal. 
• Screwdriver assortment, including various sizes of flat-head and Philips-head screw-
drivers. 
• Hacksaw, with an assortment of blades. Coarse-tooth blades are good for wood and
PVC pipe; fine-tooth blades are good for copper, aluminum, and light-gauge steel.
• Miter box, to cut straight lines. 
• Wrenches, all types. Adjustable wrenches are helpful additions to the shop. Small and
large Vice-Grips (that’s a brand name) help you hold pieces for cutting and sanding. 
• Nut drivers, make it easy to attach nuts to bolts.
• Measuring tape, a 6- or 8-foot steel measuring tape is a good choice. A cloth tape
helps measure unusual shapes. For precision, purchase a small (6- to 8-inch) machin-
ist’s rule, graduated in inches, metric, or both.
• Square (18-inch), for making sure that pieces you cut and assemble from wood, plastic,
and metal are square.
• File assortment, to smooth the rough edges. Get a set for larger pieces, and another
small set (called needle files) for miniature work.
• Drill motor,with variable speed control.
• Drill bit assortment, good, sharp ones only. If yours are dull, have them sharpened, or
replace them. A small set with sizes from 1/16 inch to 1/4 inch is fine for starters.
• Wire crimping tool, for crimping lugs and connectors onto various sizes of wires. Get
the kind that can handle wire from 12 to 22 gauge.
• Vise, for holding parts. A modest-size vice that attaches to your workbench with bolts
(not a clamp; they don’t hold) is sufficient.
• Safety goggles, for use whenever you’re using tools to hammer, cut, drill, or any other
time when flying debris could get in your eyes. Be sure you use the goggles.

Construction Tools You Should Have
If you want a well-stocked robot lab, consider these optional tools:
• A drill press helps you drill better holes, because you have more control over the angle
and depth of each hole. Be sure to use a drill press vice to hold the pieces. Never use
your hands! 
• A table saw or circular saw makes cutting through large pieces of wood and plastic
easier. Use it with a guide fence for straight cuts.
• A scroll saw or saber saw lets you cut out shapes. A decent scroll saw is not expensive
and provides good accuracy.
• A motorized hobby tool, like those made by Dremel and Weller, makes short work out
of a number of chores. The latest models have adjustable speed controls, which you
need. Be sure to select the right bit for the job. A more powerful alternative to the
hobby tool is the Roto-Zip (that’s its trade name). 
• Hot-melt glue guns let you apply fast-setting glue to most any surface. They are avail-
able at most hardware and hobby stores and are available in a variety of sizes. 
• With a nibbling tool you can “nibble” small chunks from metal and plastic pieces. Use
the tool to cut channels and enlarge holes.
• A tap and die set lets you thread holes and shafts to accept standard-size nuts and
bolts. 
• A brazing tool or small welder allows you spot-weld or braze two metal pieces together.
Use these for small work only, and only if you’re old enough to pay for fire insurance.

& Tools-Machinery
Machinery tools include mills and lathes. A mill is used
to carve material to create complex 3D shapes. It can
also be used as a very accurate drill press (in fact, a mill
looks a lot like a drill press). A lathe is used to cut
against spinning rod or square material and is used for
such jobs as cutting grooves in wheel axles. 
The resources in this section are primarily aimed at
desktop machinery, most of which is affordable for
home workshops. See also Tools-CNC for computer-
ized versions of mills and lathes.

A Quick Look at Desktop Mills, Lathes, and
CNC Routers
Model makers have used so-called desktop mills, lathes,
and CNC routers for years. These tools are similar in fea-
tures and function as the behemoths you see at large
machine shops and on manufacturing floors, but are scaled
down in both size and price—an ideal mix for amateur robot
builders.
First, some definitions:
• A mill is like a vertical drill press. Instead of a cutting bit
that just goes up and down, on a mill the work piece itself
can be moved horizontally and laterally. This allows the
mill to produce complex shapes, instead of just holes.
• A lathe is used to rotate a part against a cutting tool. It is typ-
ically used to contour round or cylindrical material—threads
on a rod, for example. The material turns on a horizontal
bed; the cutting tool is brought up against the material.
• A CNC router is a high-speed cutting tool, like a wood
router, that is attached to a mechanism that moves the
router along the X, Y, and Z axes. This movement is man-
aged by a computer.
A CNC router is inherently a computer-controlled device.
Mills and lathes can be completely manual affairs, or they,
too, can be hooked up to a computer. With most models,
you can purchase a manual desktop mill and lathe today,
and sometime down the road retrofit it for computer control.
Desktop lathes can be used to
create wheel hubs, shafts,
specialty fasteners, and more.

Makers of Desktop Machinery
There are a number of makers of desktop mills, lathes, and CNC routers. Among the
more common manufacturers are:
• Cool Tools
• FlashCut CNC
• ISMG
• Techno-Isel
• Liberty Enterprises
• Many/EasyCut
• MAXNC
• MicroKinetics
• Minicraft
• Minitech
• Sherline
• Super-Tech
• TAIG
Prices and features from these makers vary. If you’re interested in acquiring a desktop
mill, lathe, or CNC router, you’re well advised to get information on as many of them as
possible. The typical starting price for the better-made tool is $500, so consider research
part of your investment.
Not all desktop tools are created equally. Some, like those from Cool Tools, are
designed for garage shop tinkerers on a budget. They’re fine for working with lightweight
materials like soft plastics and thin woods, but don’t think you can use them to produce
highly accurate complex shapes from stainless steel! Price goes up based on accuracy,
power, and size, so plan your purchase accordingly. If you need to work with pieces up to
20 inches, don’t settle for a machine with a maximum cutting size of just 18 inches.
One way to save money on a desktop mill or lathe is to purchase it used. The better
machines fetch good prices on eBay and other online auctions, but you may have good
luck snagging a steal simply by going to garage sales and checking the local newspaper
classified ads.

There’s nothing like working with air tools out in the
garage. Everyone in the neighborhood can hear you
work, and the “bripp, bripp” of the drill or saw or
sander tells all you’re hard at work building your latest
invention. These tools are also fun to use, and pneu-
matic tools cost less than comparable electric tools. 
Campbell Hausfeld is one of the premier names in
home and shop air tools. They sell compressors that
develop the necessary air pressure, the hoses, regula-
tors, and dryers to condition the air, the tools them-
selves, and other accessories. Products are sold through
retailers 
such 
as 
Home

and 
other
hardware/home improvement stores. Some online
sales of selected (often factory-serviced) products. 
Campbell Hausfeld’s air tools include air hammers,
drills (including reversing type), ratchets, screwdrivers,
sanders, nailers, and staplers. I use two reversing drills,
keeping either drill bits or screwdriver bits in them,
depending on what I’m doing. Quick disconnect cou-
plers allow for fast tool changes.

Care and Feeding of Pneumatic Tools
Water destroys air tools. Oiling your tools every day that you use them will greatly prolong
their life and helps dispel trapped water. Even if you have an air dryer attached to your
compressor, be sure to add oil to the tool (just squirt a dab or two into the air intake) the
first time you use it that day. 
You may also wish to invest in an inline oiler, which adds oiled air to the tool as you use
it. The oiler connects to the hose line from the compressor to the tool. 
One final word: Wear earplugs (available at any drug store) when using air tools. Your
eardrums will thank you for it.

& Tools-Precision &
Miniature
Many mobile robots are small and require tools to
match. In this section, you’ll find specialty tools for pre-
cision metal, plastic, and wood work. Many of the tools
are miniature and are ideally suited for making small
parts. Included are miniature machinery tools (mills,
lathes, etc.), rotary saws, and other hand-operated
motorized tools.

Tools and Supplies for Wire Wrapping
Wire wrapping is one of the fastest methods of creating permanent and near-permanent
circuits, without fussing with creating circuit boards. Wire wrapping is a point-to-point
wiring system that uses a special tool and extra-fine 28- or 30-gauge wrapping wire.
Wire-wrapped circuits are as sturdy as soldered circuits, when properly constructed, and
you can change your designs without resoldering.
You can purchase either a manual or a motorized wrapping tool. Unless you plan on
wire wrapping all day, the manual tool is sufficient. To use, insert one end of the stripped
wire into a slot in the tool, and place the tool over a square-shaped wrapping post. Give
the tool 5 to 10 twirls. The connection is complete. To remove the wire, you use the other
end of the tool and undo the wrapping.

Shopping Surplus for Used Surgical Tools
A useful tool for robotics construction is the hemostat, lock-
ing, fine-toothed pliers that are used in various surgical pro-
cedures. They’re expensive to buy new, but are available on
the surplus market. The hemostats have been autoclaved
(disinfected using high heat), so while “used” they are per-
fectly safe.
Most of the surplus hemostats you’ll find are made of
stainless steel, but you might also run into plastic versions.
They’re lighter weight but not quite as powerful as the
metal variety.
Stainless steel hemostats
make good miniature pliers.

¶ Toys
Some of the earliest working robots were toys . . .
though not many were designed to be played with.
Rather, these robots, which followed patterns set in
cams, were for timekeeping—clock making with
mechanicals had been a real art for several centuries in
Europe—and for entertainment. One of the most
famous “show-and-tell” robots was a doll that wrote its
signature while seated at a desk.
In this section, and the several to follow, are listings of
toys with a robotic flavor. Some are robotic in shape,
while others can be used to hack robots of your own
design. Except for the very high end robot toys, such as
the Sony AIBO, most are priced low enough that you
won’t worry about gutting them to get to their parts.
This main section lists general toy repositories, such as
the venerable Toys"R"Us and the famous FAO Schwarz
in New York City. The next sections tackle specific types
of toys suitable for robotics:
• Construction-Designed for making things, these toys
teach mechanical interactions, and many (such as
LEGO and K’NEX) and can be used as elements.
• Electronics-Some electronics toys can be hacked for
their sound chips, voice chips, and other compo-
nents. There are many on the market; this section
lists a few manufacturers that make popular brands.
• Robots-Robot toys include old tin windups and
sophisticated microprocessor-controlled elec-
tronic pets.

can find a Toys"R"Us store in most every town—some-

which is typical in the toy retail trade, but you can count
on Toys"R"Us for a steady supply of these time-honored
products: 
• LEGO Mindstorms 
• K’NEX construction sets 
• Tonka motorized tractors and bulldozers (hack

• R/C batteries and rechargers 
• Nerf pistols and balls (for lightweight fighting
robots) 
• Motorized cars

LEGO
LEGO has become the premier construction toy, for both
children and adults. The LEGO Company, parent company
of the LEGO brand, has expanded the line to educational
resources, making the ubiquitous LEGO “bricks” common in
schools across the country and around the world. LEGO
also makes the Mindstorms, a series of sophisticated com-
puterized robots.
LEGO Technic line of LEGO sets provides additional parts
for robot construction. The pieces are engineered to fit the
“classic” LEGO bricks, but add useful beams, connectors,
and other parts to provide greater flexibility. A LEGO Technic
beam has holes drilled through its sides for attaching to connector pieces. These holes
are perfect for mounting LEGO components onto the rest of your robot.

about shipping costs; you can save money buying many
items at once. 
They offer the full line of Tamiya Educational kits
(motors, track sets, wheels, etc.), but not all kits are in
stock all the time. You can arrange for your shipment to
be held until most or all of the goods you want can be
shipped to you. 
Prices are in Japanese yen. You can convert to your cur-
rency on the Web site or at http://www.xe.com/.

K’NEX is the Rodney Dangerfield of construction toys
for robotic parts: Next to LEGO, it gets no respect. Or
at least, very little attention. 
That’s a shame, because of all the construction toy
materials available, K’NEX is among the most useful in
amateur robotics. K’NEX pieces snap together to make
physically large yet lightweight structures. Gluing cre-
ates permanent joints, and you can use the parts, with
fasteners and even nuts and machine screws, to create
frames and other parts for your robots. K’NEX sets tend
to be cheaper and have more parts than the average
LEGO set.

Fischertechnik
The Fischertechnik kits, made in Germany, are favored in
higher-ed classes and even some colleges and universities.
More than “toys,” Fischertechnik kits offer a snap-together
approach to making working electromagnetic, hydraulic,
pneumatic, static, and robotic mechanisms. 
All the Fischertechnik parts are interchangeable and
attach to a common plastic base plate. You can extend the
lengths of the base plate to just about any size you want,
and the base plate can serve as the foundation for your
robot. You can use the motors supplied with the kits or use
your own motors with the parts provided.
Fischertechnik parts.

Specialty robotic products in the K’NEX line include
the CyberK’NEX machines (Ultra, Cybots) remote-con-
trol robot construction sets, MechWarrior construction
sets, and Cool Machines, where you can build various
kinds of vehicles with plates, beams, and girders. 
You can buy extra K’NEX parts and sets online; toy
stores carry the complete sets. Available parts items sold
online include a motor pack, miniature spring motor,
tires, and gears. The gears are so inexpensively priced
you’ll want to get them even if you don’t use any other
K’NEX parts (but I urge you to consider doing so).

K’NEX
K’NEX uses unusual half-round plastic spokes and connec-
tor rods to build everything from bridges to Ferris wheels to
robots. You can build a robot with just K’NEX parts or use
the parts in a larger, mixed-component robot. For example,
the base of a walking robot may be made from a thin sheet
of aluminum, but the legs might be constructed from vari-
ous K’NEX pieces.
A number of K’NEX kits are available, from simple starter
sets to rather massive special-purpose collections (many of
which are designed to build robots, dinosaurs, or robot-
dinosaurs). Several of the kits come with small gear motors so you can motorize your
creation. The motors are also available separately.
KNEX parts.
Erector Set
Erector Sets, now sold by Meccano, were once made of all metal. Now, they commonly
contain both metal and plastic pieces, in various sizes, and are generally designed to
build specific vehicles or other projects. Useful components of the kits include pre-
punched girders, plastic and metal plates, tires, wheels, shafts, and plastic mounting pan-
els. You can use any as you see fit, assembling your robots with the hardware supplied
with the kit or with 6/32 or 8/32 nuts and bolts. 
Over the years the Erector Set brand has gone through many owners. Parts from old
Erector Sets may not fit well with new parts, including but not limited to differences in the
threads used for the nuts and bolts. If you have a very old Erector Set (such as the ones
made and sold by Gilbert), you’re probably better off keeping them as collector’s items,
rather than raiding them for robotic parts. Similarly, today’s Meccano sets are only pass-
ably compatible with the English-made Meccano sets sold decades ago. Hole spacing and
sizes have varied over the years, and “mixing and matching” is not practical or desirable.

The Robotix kits, originally manufactured by Milton-Bradley
and now sold by Learning Curve, are specially designed to
make snap-together walking and rolling robots. Various kits
are available, and many of them include at least one motor;
you can buy additional motors if you’d like. You control the
motors using a central switch pad. 
The structural components in the Robotix kits are molded
high-impact plastic. You can connect pieces together to
form just about anything. You can cement the pieces
together to provide a permanent construction.

Capsela
Capsela is a popular snap-together motorized parts kit that
uses unusual tube and sphere shapes. Capsela kits come
in different sizes and have one or more gear motors that
can be attached to various components. The kits contain
unique parts that other put-together toys don’t, such as
plastic chain and chain sprockets/gears. Advanced kits
come with remote control and computer circuits. All the
parts from the various kits are interchangeable. 
The links of the chain snap apart, so you can make any
length chain you want. Combine the links from many kits
and you can make an impressive drive system for an experimental lightweight robot.

“pinge,” which allows the pieces to swivel and move. 
Though the hinged pieces are not powered, the
Polymorf sets are useful as raw materials for building
robots. You can glue or fasten other pieces of your
robot to the Polymorf plastic. You can also use
Polymorf to test different articulated designs. Different
sets are available, with 230 to 1,000 pieces. In this cases,
“pieces” means panels and pinges. The 1,000-piece set
has 364 panels, 52 each of the seven shapes.

User Groups Provide Help, Guidance
When I began to build my first robot in the late 1970s, I didn’t know anyone else who was
interested in my hobby. There were only a few books on the subject, and no magazines
except the general-interest electronics periodicals. The world has changed—for the bet-
ter—thanks primarily to the Internet. With the Internet, it’s possible to locate others who
have the same interests as you. With just a modicum of effort, you can find people all
over the world with whom to exchange ideas. You might even be able to find folks in your
hometown who share your interests.
Such are user groups, where like-minded people can get together—in person or over a
modem—to discuss their interests. There are user groups for robotics, electronics, artifi-
cial intelligence, electronics, mechanics, metalworking and woodworking, programming,
microcontroller and embedded systems, CNC machine tools, and much more. Some
meet locally; others meet virtually on the Internet. 
The Internet meetings are usually held through an online bulletin board. An example of
an all-online user group is TRCY, which stands for “The Robotics Club of Yahoo.” Here,
some 2,000 members from around the globe use the bulletin board and chat features of
Yahoo! to discuss the robot-building art. Libraries with photos, schematics, and building
plans are provided.
Not all robotics user groups are virtual, of course. Many are held in business parks,
school auditoriums, and people’s homes. Some premier “real-life” user groups include
the Seattle Robotics Society, Dallas Personal Robotics Group, HomeBrew Robotics Club,
and Twin Cities Robotics Group. Those groups that provide local meeting places are indi-
cated in the User Groups section by city and state.

Video
Low-cost video cameras have paved the way to an
increased use of vision systems in robotics. The sources
in the following sections manufacture, sell, or support a
variety of video equipment for allowing your robot to
see. You may use video to process imagery for true video
vision analysis, or you may merely broadcast a video sig-
nal from your robot to your desktop. Either way, you’ll
find a number of affordable products to suit your
needs.
The video sections are:
• Cameras—Self-contained digital or analog cameras
that are small enough to mount on the typical
mobile robot. Digital cameras can be directly con-
nected to a microprocessor or computer for vision
analysis.
• Imagers—For those who wish to make their own
vision systems from scratch. The imagers require
interface electronics. This is not something most
will want to do; rather, the listings in the section are
really for their online datasheets and application
notes documentation.
• Programming & APIs—API stands for “Application
Program Interface.” Examples and products for pro-
cessing images. Also includes sources for capturing
video popular personal computer platforms.
• Transmitters—Resources of battery-powered trans-
mitters (and their associated receivers) for relaying
color and black-and-white video images from one
location to another. Note that these transmitters are
low power only, and range is limited.

Better Pictures with Better Lenses
If you’re interested in exploring vision systems for your robot creations, be sure to con-
sider the quality of the lens (some solid-state imagers don’t even come with a lens; you
must add your own). Many of the smallest solid-state cameras were designed as elec-
tronic peepholes for doors and so have a very wide field of view—almost a “fisheye”
appearance—to see as much outside as possible.
With wide views comes distortion of the image. That can make it hard to process the
image to detect shapes and objects. For robotics work, you’ll want the best lens you can
afford, preferably one that provides a normal field of view. This will reduce the so-called
barrel distortion common in wide-angle lenses.
The least expensive solid-state cameras come with a nonremovable lens, so you get
what you get. The lens is interchangeable on the better units. A few are designed to work
with standard C-mount lenses, which any CCTV reseller can provide.

Better Eyes to See You With
Most ‘bot eyes are far simpler than the ocular sensors we humans have, yet they function
quite admirably despite their lack of complexity. Here are the most common devices used
for robot eyes. 
• Photoresistors, typically a cadmium sulfide (Cds) cell (often referred to simply as a pho-
tocell). A Cds cell acts like a light-dependent resistor: The resistance of the cell varies
depending on the intensity of the light striking it. When no light strikes the cell, the
device exhibits very high resistance, typically in the high hundreds of K ohms, or even
megohms. Light reduces the resistance, usually significantly (a few hundreds or thou-
sands of ohms). Cds cells are very easy to interface to other electronics, but they are
somewhat slow reacting and are unable to discern when light flashes more than 20 or
30 times per second. This trait actually comes in handy, as it means Cds cells basically
ignore the on/off flashes of AC-operated lights.
• Phototransistors are very much like regular transistors, with their metal or plastic top
removed. A glass or plastic cover protects the delicate transistor substrate inside.
Unlike Cds cells, phototransistors are very quick acting, able to sense tens of thou-
sands of flashes of light per second. The output of a phototransistor is not “linear”; that
is, there is a disproportionate change in the output of a phototransistor as more and
more light strikes it. A phototransistor can become easily “swamped” with too much
light. Even as more light shines on the device, the phototransistor is not able to detect
any more change.
• Photodiodes are the simpler diode versions of phototransistors. Like phototransistors,
they are made with a glass or plastic cover to protect the semiconductor material
inside them. And like phototransistors, photodiodes are very fast acting and can
become “swamped” when exposed to a certain threshold of light. One common char-
acteristic of most photodiodes is that their output is rather low, even when fully
exposed to bright light. This means that to be effective, the output of the photodiode
must usually be connected to a small amplifier of some type.
• Pyroelectric sensors—commonly referred to as PIR, for “passive infrared”—see by
detecting changes in heat. They can be purchased new or salvaged from an existing
motion detector. The most common use of pyroelectric infrared (or PIR) sensors is in
burglar alarms and motion detectors. Because PIR sensors see only objects that move,
they can be used to distinguish between animate and inanimate objects.
• Ultrasonic sensors send out a beam of sound, and then wait for the return echo. The
difference in time between the burst of sound and its return echo indicates distance. By
taking many measurements while slowly moving the ultrasonic sensor, it’s possible for
the robot to “map” the topography of its immediate environment.
• Radar is like ultrasonics, but it uses radio waves instead of sound. The advantage of
radar is that the resolution—the ability to determine objects of small size—is far better
than ultrasonics. The disadvantage is that workable radar detectors for robotics are
quite expensive.
• Video cameras can be directly connected to computers, and the image they receive
can be analyzed by software. They are the most like “real” eyes, and while video cam-
eras are now relatively inexpensive and produce excellent detail, the limitation is in the
software. It’s not an easy task to break down and analyze a moving scene in an unpre-
dictable environment, particularly in real time. No doubt this area of robotics will
undergo massive improvements in the years to come and will someday give the ability
for robots to see just as humans do.

Alternative Sources for Video Cameras
You don’t need to buy a specialty solid-state video camera to give eyes to your robot.
There are a few alternative sources for low-cost imagers:
• Hacked wireless security camera. You’ve seen ads for wireless security cameras you
can “put anywhere.” The camera, which operates at 9 to 12 volts DC, transmits its sig-
nal in the 2.4-gigahertz range. You need a video receiver to pick up the signal. Quality
varies greatly, especially under low-light condition. Test a sample camera first before
taking it apart. And be sure to turn off any microwave ovens that are operating nearby,
as they emit a signal close to the operating frequency of these cameras.
• Game Boy camera. These were available for a time—but are now discontinued—for the
venerable Nintendo Game Boy handheld game machine. You can still find them at
swap meets, used computer stores, and at online auctions, such as eBay (the Game
Boy device is not needed to hack the camera). The resolution is fairly low—128 by 123
pixels—but the camera is cheap and worth the hacking effort. Here are two sources for
hacking the camera:

• Older model digital still cameras. Digital cameras get better all the time. Ones with USB
or serial interfaces to transfer the pictures to a PC are good candidates for hacking.
• USB serial Webcams. Many of the latest Webcams are cheap and are inherently digital,
as they connect to the PC (or Macintosh or whatever) via a USB serial link. With some
work, you may be able to hack a Webcam for robotics. But take note: While the data
may be transferred via USB, the format of that data is likely propriety and varies from
one manufacturer to the other. Some Webcam makers provide a software developer’s
kit or publish the data format specifications for their products, but others do not. Use
Google.com to look for resources for Webcam writing drivers for Linux and other non-
Windows operating systems. These pages will explain the data format of the camera. A
most helpful resource is Sourceforge:

CCD and CMOS Imagers
When I started robotics, consumer video cameras used a high-voltage imaging tube
called a Vidicon to render a picture. Vidicons tended to be large and required a high-volt-
age power supply. The whole thing was heavy; with a lens, the typical video camera was
the size of a lunchbox and weighed several pounds.
These days, cameras are the size of a cockroach—a regular-sized cockroach, not
those brutes you encounter in New York City!—and require only minimal voltage to run.
The cameras are cheap, too. You can buy a decent miniature black-and-white video
camera for under $50; color versions are more, but still reasonable. These cameras,
which use only solid-state components, are intended for security applications. The better
ones operate under fairly low light conditions. 
Solid-state video cameras use two kinds of imaging electronics: CCD or CMOS. CCD
imagers (the CCD stands for “charged coupled device”) is generally considered to offer a
sharper picture and offers better low-light sensitivity. CMOS imagers cost less, but on the
whole, don’t deliver the sharpest pictures. While there are some CMOS imagers intended
for low-light operation, most are not as sensitive as their CCD brethren.

Video Images: Analog or Digital
The vast majority of solid-state video cameras available today provide an analog output
signal (specifically, it is a composite signal that combines synchronization and lumi-
nance signals, and with a color system, chrominance signals as well). Depending on
where in the world you buy your camera, this signal is compatible with your TV and
VCR.
For example, color cameras sold in the United States are compatible with the NTSC
color standard; black-and-white cameras, with the RS-170 standard. Cameras for sale in
many parts of Europe follow the PAL standard. Some cameras are selectable between
NTSC and PAL or are available in either version.
For the most part, cameras with composite signal outputs are only modestly useful in
robotics. The signal must be processed before the electronics (computer, microcon-
troller) on the robot can use it. The processing might be in the form of a frame capture
card, or it might be some homemade sync separator and analog-to-digital comparator
circuit. However, a minority of solid-state cameras provides a digital output—usually 8-bit
parallel, but also USB serial. A parallel digital camera can be directly connected to your
robot’s computer or controller; software running on the robot reads the video signal by
processing the digital data.

Says the Web site, their mission is to “create a simple,
robust vision system suitable for real time robotics
applications. The system aims to perform global low
level color vision at video rates without the use of spe-
cial purpose hardware.”

Selecting the Right Caster
Robots with coaxial drives—two drive wheels on either
side—need something on the front and/or the back to pre-
vent them from tipping over. A common approach is to use
casters. If the robot’s drive wheels are mounted along the
center line of the robot, then two casters are used. One is
placed toward the front of the robot, and the other toward
the back. If the drive wheels are placed at one end of the
robot, then only one balancing caster need be used.
For small roving robots, the caster is fairly small. The
smallest commonly available caster has a wheel of about 1
5/8 inches; smaller models are available, but are not as
easy to find. The 1 5/8-inch caster will work with robots that
have 2- to 3-inch-diameter drive wheels. The larger the
drive wheel, the larger the caster. (This doesn’t always hold true, depending on whether
the motors and wheels are mounted on the top of the robot’s base, or below it. When
mounted on top, there is less ground clearance, and the caster must be smaller.)
A problem with the very small casters is that, well, most aren’t made very well. They
are designed for extremely light duty, so their ball bearing swivel mechanism is cheaply
made. This can cause the swivel to bind up or stick when used with a light load, such as
your robot. When selecting a caster, spin its swivel. If it catches or binds up at all, select
another model or brand (or another caster in case you simply got a bad one). 
If your robot is small and light (under a few pounds), you should also avoid casters
where the swivel is stiff because of heavy grease. Otherwise, the caster may not turn
readily under the light weight of the robot.
Casters add balance to two-
wheeled robots.

Wheels, Tires, Hubs—Oh, My!
Rolling robots use wheels. Or maybe they use tires (or
tyres, if you’re in the United Kingdom). Or maybe they use
hubs and tires. Which one is right? They all are, and the
terms are often used interchangeably. Yet it helps to define
exactly which is which, so here’s a short glossary on what
these terms should mean.
Wheels are made up of tires, mounted on hubs. A tire is
rubber, plastic, metal, or some other material, and the hub
is the portion that attaches to the shaft of the axle or motor.
(Similarly, the wheels on a car are made of the tire on the
outside, and the hub, or rim, on the inside.)
Some wheels for robots are molded into one piece.
Others, such as the Dave Brown Lite-Flight wheels, are
composed of two separate pieces assembled at the plant. The Lite-Flight wheels use a
plastic hub that attaches to the motor shaft or axle, and onto the hub is mounted a foam
tire.
Some more terms:
• Load wheels are wheels with a metal or heavy-duty-plastic hub. They are for heavy
loads.
• Press-on tires are wheels without hubs; you press the tires (sometimes they’re just an
O-ring) onto hubs.
Wheels are tires mounted on
hubs.

Using Ball Transfers as Casters
Ball transfers are primarily designed to be used in materials
processing— conveyor chutes, and the like. Ball transfers
are made of a single ball, either metal, plastic, or rubber,
held captive in a housing. They function as an omnidirec-
tional caster for your robot. 
The size of the ball varies from about 11/16 to over 3
inches in diameter. Look for ball casters at mechanical sur-
plus stores and also at industrial supply outlets, such as
Grainger, McMaster-Carr, Outwater Plastics, MSC Industrial
Direct, and others.
Ball transfers can be used as
omnidirectional casters.

Omniwheels Go Your Way
Imagine a wheel that spins like any other wheel, yet also
allows for sideways motion. That’s an omnidirectional wheel,
multidirectional wheel, or omniwheel—an idea that goes
back to about 1910. The wheel is a series of small wheels or
rollers, mounted around the circumference of a larger main
wheel. They’re popular in materials-handling applications;
the wheels are mounted in rows on top of tables or convey-
ors. Boxes or other goods glide effortlessly along the wheels
and are allowed movement in any direction.
For robotics, omniwheels have two principle applications:
• As drive wheels in three-wheeled robots. An example robot that uses this design is the
PalmPilot Robot Kit (PPRK), sold by Acroname and several others. Rather than use two
drive wheels positioned opposite one another, the PPRK uses three wheels in a trian-
gular configuration. Only two motors propel the robot at a time, but the machine is able
to move in any direction by applying power to specific motors.
• As free-wheeling casters, allowing for low-friction turning. A problem with swivel cast-
ers is that the swivel may not spin freely in turns. This causes the robot to lose accurate
tracking and steering (if the robot is light enough, a caster that isn’t pointed in the right
direction will cause the little critter to veer off to one side!).
Omniwheels are available in sizes ranging from about 40mm (about 1.5 inch) to over
150mm (about 6 inches). The wheel material is rubber or polyurethane. Alas, omniwheels
are rather expensive, but for what they do, they do it well.
Omniwheels can be used as
casters or as drive wheels.

Yellow Pages—First Line of Defense
Someone at the phone company forgot to trademark the name “Yellow Pages,”
and so now there are hundreds of Yellow Pages—in print form, and on the
Internet. Your own local merchants are among the best choices for parts and
supplies for your robot: because they’re nearby, you can visit them yourself and
pick up what you need. There are no shipping costs to contend with, and you
know what you’re getting.
The Yellow Pages are broken up into categories, and over time, the categories
have become somewhat standardized. This categorization has also extended to
the numerous online Yellow Pages and business directories now available.
These are free, of course, because the Yellow Pages are really just a massive
classified ad section.
As useful as the Yellow Pages are, their sheer size can make finding the right
thing at the right time hard. Following are the major categories for parts, sup-
plies, and services for amateur robot building. The ones shown in italics are
primary sources; study these well to find out what’s near you.
Note: Some phone companies and Yellow Pages publishers offer their printed
books on CD-ROM, and the disc includes a search engine. Check this out; it
can help you find what you need.
