Last Ninja II
When the Last Ninja appeared
and amazed everyone with it's
superb mix of graphics, adven-
ture and puzzles, conquered the
charts, swept the awards and
showed just what was possible
with eight-hit machines, eve-
ryone agreed that it was the last
word in kung-fu games. It was
also inevitable that there would
be a sequel.
Once again, you must don
the black suit and mask of the
ninja and take up your sword
for the inevitable combat that
is sure to follow. In this game
you will face foes even more
dangerous than the ﬁre brea-
thing dragons of the original,
in a land more treacherous than
the swamps; modern day New
York. As Arkamuni, the Last
Ninja, you have been sent by
Considering their prominence
in British myths and legends,
it is something of a surprise to
ﬁnd that the Tales o f King
Arthur and the Knights of the
Round Table do not feature
more frequently in adventure
games. Whilst the exploits o f
Sirs Gawain, Tristram, Percival
and Galahad are reasonably
well known, i t comes as no
great surprise to discover that
Level 9, in conjunction with
Mandarin Software, are basing
their story around the exploits
of Sir Lancelot, the greatest and
bravest knight of them all.
The games consists of three
linked adventures, following
the life of Lancelot from his
arrival at court, right through
the ancient gods to seek out and
defeat your arch enemy, the evil
Shogun Kunitoki.
Six d i ffe re n t sections
packed full of muggers, thugs,
corrupt cops and even knife-
throwing jugglers will challenge
the arcade players, whereas
those who like to match their
reactions with skill will enjoy
the puzzles on the way to the
showdown with the evil Kuni-
toki. These aren't puzzles that
you will have to ponder over
for weeks and then type i n
precisely as in some adventures,
these are puzzles that you solve
with a joystick using some logic
but mostly gut-feeling and pure
nerve.
Around the main screen are
the usual Last Ninja displays:
areas where you can scroll
through objects that you hold
and may need to  use, your
to the quest that ultimately split
the Round Table, the search for
the Holy Grail.
• The story sticks very closely
to Malory's medieval version,
of th e  legend, L e  M o r te
D'Arthur, so don't expect any
Hollywood-style romanticism.
Instead, th e  game follows
Lancelot's life, starting with his
battle to become the greatest
knight of the age. Then come
the two tragic love affairs, one
with Elaine, during which he
fathers Galahad, a n d  th e
second with Arthur's wife,
Queen Guenever, which stems
from his excessive sense of duty
towards her.
This second affair gives
Arthur's enemies the chance to
score, elapsed time, and bars
that represent your strength
and that of any opponent that
you face. Combat normally
involves b l o w s  b e i n g
exchanged using hands and
feet, but sometimes weapons
can be used, including some
that you can hurl from a dis-
tance. A s  battles rage, the
strength bars reduce and death
visits the combatant whose bar
vanishes ﬁrst.
The main attraction is, once
again, the stunning 3D graphics
that form the backdrop to the
adventure. In this game you'll
battle on roof tops that tower
above the streets, ru n  the
gauntlet o f  the drugstores
downtown, face crooked cops
in Central Park and then meet
crowbar-wielding muggers just
around the next corner just
imagine their surprise when
drive a wedge between him and
his greatest friend. I t  also
means that Lancelot is not pure
enough o f  heart to  actually
complete the quest to ﬁnd the
Holy Grail, although he is
granted a vision of it.
The story is accompanied
by lashings of Level 9's atmos-
pheric text and there is no need
to worry about ﬁnding the
exact combination o f  words
necessary to solve a puzzle; the
Level 9 parser is still recognised
as being one of the best in the
industry. If you have the disk
version, you will also be able
to enjoy some stunning illustra-
tions which accompany the
text.
Mandarin is also offering
they discover that they're tak-
ing on a ninja!
Eventually, you'll learn
enough kung-fu moves or ﬁnd
sufﬁcient weapons to keep you
alive long enough to stay on the
trail o f  Kunitoki, eventually
leading to the ﬁnal confronta-
tion in his hidden opium den.
Before this, you will have had
many an hour o f  kung-fu
arcade adventuring, leaving
you hoping that this isn't the
Last Ninja and looking forward
to the prospect of Last Ninja

Emlyn Hughes, the man with
the squeaky voice. lucrative TV
contracts and the crunching
• tackle who wore the number six
shirt for Liverpool in the Bill
Shankley era, now stars in his
own football game.
The best way to think of it
is to look back at that all time
classic, Commodore Interna-
tional Soccer, that was released
in 1983 and think of EHIS as
the updated version. However,
that's only h a l f the story
because, behind the Commo-
dore Soccer gameplay, there's
a strong strategy element
including player statistics and
League and Cup competitions.
Each player's statistics des-
cribe their running and tackling
skills, ﬁtness rating and a
record is kept of the number
of games they've played and the
goals they scored. This infor-
mation should help you choose
your team fo r  the coming
matches.
During the match you use
the joystick to control the man
nearest to the ball, depending
on who has possession, and try
and dribble down the ﬁeld to
score. That's where the similar-
ity ends. In EHIS the player's
abilities decide how well he
tackles o r how fast he runs
which improves an already
tried and tested format.
In Commodore's Soccer,
ball control consists o f drib-

bling and shooting the ball in
the direction you're running
but, in EHIS, you can either
kick the ball along the ground,
loft it into the air for crosses
or pass towards the right or left
as well. Add to  that sliding
tackles, diving headers and
charging your opponent off the
ball and you've got a system in
which realistic moves can easily
be built up. For example, your
keeper could roll the ball out
to a defender who passes it to
a midﬁeld player, then a smart
chip out to the winger (a good
runner), who charges down to
the line and crosses it into the
box for a diving header at goal!
The preproduction copy of
EHIS that I was playing didn't
have all it's features in place
such as the eight team Super
League, where you can change
the name of any of the teams
and players to suit your taste
in football, Neither were the
Cup competition or champion-
ship (whatever that is), or the
free kicks or penalties for rough
play included. However, all 11
players on either side, a novelty
in computer football games,
were doing enough to convince
me that this is one to look out
for.

Serve and Volley
Sports simulation programs
have always proved t o  be
extremely popular and Acco-
lade have enjoyed particular
success in this ﬁeld through
games such as Hardball, still
the best baseball game around.
Now, they have turned their
hand to tennis with their latest
title Serve and Volley, distrib-
uted by Electronic Arts.
There have been many ten-
nis games before but all of them
have suffered from major ﬂaws
in their playability or else have
proved to be extremely limited
in scope. Serve and Volley
includes a host of features not
previously seen in simulations.
Even the sternest critic is likely
to be impressed.
To start with, you can
choose which surface you play
on, grass, clay or concrete, each
of which determines the tactics
to be employed. If you get too
good at the lowest skill level,
you still have two more levels
to choose from plus a practice
mode for beginners. You can
also decide whether to play a
one-off match or enter a tour-
nament playing against either
the computer o r  a  human
opponent.
Emphasis during the play is
on stroke selection, timing and
ball placement. There are three
different serves to choose from:
top spin, ﬁrst serve and slice
and th e  variety continues
according to  which o f  ﬁve
different strokes you opt for. As

Times of Lore
"Oh, I don't like role playing
games", someone was saying to
me the other day. "Book upon
book o f rules to be learned,
spells to be memorised, maps
to be drawn and having to get
to grips with all the different
commands and then having to
learn a completely new set of
instructions if I want to switch
from Ultima to Bard's Tale to
Phantasie.
"No", he went on, "give me
something where I can just pick
up a joystick and start playing
immediately picking up what I
need to know as I go along."
"Times of Lore". I replied.
"What, a  game all about
policemen", my friend coun-
tered trying to  extract the
Michael.
"Not that kind of law — 1-
o-r-e as in mythology. It's the
latest game to  come fro m
Origin, already famous for its
Ultima series and it's designed
for people just like you".
Of course, you will need to
read the rules eventually but the
game is designed so that you
can start playing straight away,
using a series of icons at the
bottom of the screen to control
your character's actions. Yes,
this is an all-action, graphic,
role-playing game.
The story is set in mists of
time, long, long ago. The king-
dom o f Albareth is a t war,
facing hordes of invading bar-
barians. After a series of desp-
erate struggles, High Ki n g
Valwyn wins the day but the
conﬂict has taken its toll. The
king disappears to seek rest in
the lands o f  the Elden folk,
vowing to return after 20 years
have passed.
Over 20 years have passed,
though, and there are still
no roaming brigands. As you
might expect, there i s  a n
increasing amount of lawless-
ness and rumours are rife about
the fate of the old king and what
well as backhand and forehand,
you can lob, volley or attempt
to kill the point with a devas-
tating smash.
Each player's performance
can be individually tweaked.
You can adjust your endurance,
the relative strength o f your
forehand and backhand and
come to a compromise between
power and accuracy. These
statistics can be viewed at any
time and you can even sit back
and let the computer play for
you according to your chosen
abilities. Matches and tourna-
ments can be saved at any point
(no pun intended).
The screen displays the
whole court from a sideways
perspective. At the top left of
the screen is a window featuring
what the programmers call
strobe-a-strobe graphics. This
is an animation frame that
shows close-ups of your shots,
giving very realistic effects.
Who knows? Serve and
Volley may prove to be the one
opponent th a t Stefﬁ Gr a f
couldn't beat with one hand
tied behind her back! G R H

troubles will befall the king-
dom. It is known that adven-
turers are being recruited to see
if they can sort out the troubles,
or at least ﬁnd out what's going
on. Daring missions to strange
lands are the order the day, so
you decide to  pledge your
sword t o  t h e  people o f
Albareth.
As you wander the land,
you w i l l  encounter many
strange beasts and men, almost
all guaranteed to  be hostile.
There are many places t o
explore: castles, deserted ruins,
dungeons and the general perils
of the wilderness. As you walk
along the beach, you wonder
if you will need to ﬁnd a boat
to take you to foreign shores
in pursuit of your quest.
The graphic display i s
shown in a Gauntlet-like, 3-D
perspective which looks partic-
ularly effective. Objects and
buildings have a considerable
amount o f detail drawn into
them, adding considerably to
the effect. Gameplay takes
place in real time so you will
need to have all your wits about
you, no sitting and pondering
your next move here!
One further bonus is that
you don't need a disk drive to
play Times o f  Lore — i t is
available on cassette as a self-
contained game, although
further volumes in the series
will almost certainly be disk
only.
For anyone who has not yet
experienced the joys o f role-
playing games, o r those who
prefer action to strategy, Times
of Lore could well prove to be
just the game to  whet their
appetite.

SPECUIL.
Ultima V
Almost exactly one year after
it was ﬁrst announced, Ultima
V has ﬁnally arrived. Devotees
of th i s series, which has
achieved something of a cult
status, will he raiding their
piggy banks in order to buy a
copy of the game sight unseen.
Others will no doubt want to
know how the game compares
with other computer role-
playing games before splashing
Out.
About the same length in
playing time as its predecessor
(100 -  200 hours), Ultima V
nevertheless boasts m a n y
improvements to  what was
already an excellent game
system.
Whole new areas of Britan-
nia have come to light with the
discovery of the New Under-
world. Lord British cannot
resist the opportunity to go on
one last adventure but disaster
strikes the party and everybody
is captured, apart from one
brave soul who escapes to tell
the tale. The people of Britan-
nia, now leaderless, panic and
you are summoned once again
to try and rid the land of this
new evil.
A party of up to six char-
acters can be created to help
you on your quest although key
alliances will have to be made
later on in the game so it might
prove prudent to start off with
less than a full team. Character
generation is achieved by ans-
wering a  series o f  moral
dilemma questions rather than
the random rolling of dice.
The Ultima series works so
well because everything within
the game meshes together per-
fectly. There are no glaring
anomalies either within the
game system or the story. Items
and characters not only have
a purpose, but also a logical
reason for being there in the
ﬁrst place. Weaknesses from
previous games have been
ironed out or eliminated and a
host of new features added. All
in all, a game that is a must
for any collection. G R H

FISH!
Here's a ﬁshy tale for adven-
turers who are looking to net
a new game packed with puz-
zles to solve and of course, red
herrings. Neither is this an
excuse to carp on about ﬁshy
puns, besides it's not the right
time or plaice, so don't knock
me off my perch and, before
you g o  completely green
around the gills, t e l l  you all
about it.
FISH! is the latest game
from those masters of adven-
tures, Magnetic Scrolls, who's
Corruption recently gained the
best game award at the British
Micro Awards, so you know
this new one's going to be good.
It's also going to be tough but
the superb mix of awful puns,
clever puzzles and breath-
taking graphics will make the
ordeal worthwhile.
As the game begins you are
a multi-dimensional espionage
operator, happily swimming
around a goldﬁsh bowl, enjoy-
ing a  spot o f  R&R, when
suddenly a plastic castle drops
past your dorsal ﬁn and settles
on the bottom of your bowl.
This can mean only one thing,
another mission has begun.
Once again, it's your
enemies, the Seven Deadly
Fins, up to their old tricks of
threatening the ﬁshy people of
the planet Hydropolis who
have just built a device to stop
the loss o f water from their
planet. Unfortunately, th e
Seven Deadly Fins have stolen
the device and spread parts of
it throughout the dimensions
and, if you don't get them back,
the ﬁsh people will have had
their chips.
Swimming inside the castle
leads you to ﬁnd three doors
that each lead into a  new
dimension but i f you want a
break from the action you can
always play your favourite
game, such as the Prawn, on
your computer.

If you survive the puns and
the missions then you go
through a hole in the castle and
become the head of the project
to make the device which leads
you into more problems, more
puns and more puzzles to solve.
This looks as i f it will be
a puz7le solver's adventure but
before you tackle it, be warned
that it contains truly awful puns
that are "guaranteed to make
you groan".

It is fair to say that nearly all
the role-playing games released
for the home computer market
so far have been fantasy based.
This is ﬁne if you enjoy talking
to dwarves or slaying dragons
but not everybody sees them-
selves as a latter-day hero and,
instead, prefer something a bit
more hi-tech. I f  you fall into
this category, then Neuro-
mancer might be the game
you've been looking for.
The game brings together
two mighty forces, William
Gibson and Interplay. Based on
Gibson's novel which won the
Hugo, Nebula and Philip Dick
science ﬁction awards, the
game has been created b y
Interplay, best known for their
epic fantasy trilogy, The Bard's
Tale.
The year is 2017, the place,
Japan. Greed is the dominating
force in a  corrupt world, a
world which is hooked into a
giant computer. Information
on any subject you care to name
is instantly available fro m
world communication net-
works. You play the part of a
•
futuristic hacker. This pursuit
is not only frowned upon ever-
ywhere but is also risky inextre-
mis because anyone caught in
the act is likely to ﬁnd their life
expectancy suddenly reduced
to zero.
As the hacker, you roam t
streets of Japan looking both
for better equipment and, as
always, for more information.
A tip here, a password there,
anything so long as i t allows
you further into the system, for
whoever controls the software,
controls the world.
One possible task is to ﬁnd
a way into the government and
corporate computer systems, or
how about using your software
to melt the IC E (Intrusion
Countermeasures Electronics)
that is used in protective layers
to guard th e  Cyberspace
databases.
Once inside Cyberspace,
you may ﬁnd that you are no
longer alone and that there are
other people willing to share
their information with you, for
a price. The more you learn,
the more you are able to learn_

Role-playing games are not

At this point, I should point out
that I have never heard of Devo

is a  good o r  a  had thing!
Apparently the song Some
'Things Never Change stands a
good chance of being released
as a  single so presumably
someone thinks it's okay.
Should yo u  get totally
stuck, I suppose that you could
always read the book or, if you
are too lazy even to do that,
you can wait for the ﬁlm to be
released. Remember though,
this is a lot more serious than
leaving rude messages on bul-
letin boards. Hacking can
seriously damage your health -
but think of the rewards if you
succeed...

Afterburner, the game that
stunned the arcade fraternity
with its climb in, pitch and roll,
simulator console will soon
appear on the C64, thanks to
Activision's massive develop-
ment team o f  programmers,
artists and musicians. The
conversion work is nearly com-

for take off in December.

rience but would the public
think i t was worth the extra
money they would have to pay
(as much as LI a game)? They
did, in droves, and it shot up
the all time earners chart and
became the number one arcade
game.
Just because i t was an
arcade smash doesn't mean it
will convert well. In fact, many
said it couldn't be done. After
all, a CM doesn't compare with
an hydraulic simulator con-
trolled b y a  computer with
three megabytes of memory!
Work on the game began at
Activision's Software Studios
back in March and at last it's
taking shape, making the team
conﬁdent that Afterburner will
be ready in December.
Your craft is an F-I4 ﬁghter
and* as you'd know i f  you
climbed inside the arcade ver-
sion, it's a plane that's capable
of some amazing speeds and
breath-taking manoeuvres.
Armed with a cannon and a
small, but important, number
of Vulcan missiles, the F-I4 is
sent on a  deadly mission to
intercept enemy bombers. This
will be far from easy as the sky
.•
rapidly becomes crowded with
enemy aircraft, bullets and
missiles.
Supersonic dogﬁghts have
little i n common with those
fought with Spitﬁres because
everything is now computer
controlled and happens in a
instant. The C64 version prom-
ises to have all the furious ﬂying
action of the original, including
a full 360 degree roll. Even this
freedom of movement may not
save you from the enemy ﬂak
and you'll get a painful close-
up of the superb graphic lands-
capes as you plummet downw-
ards in a ball of ﬂame.
It will be this gameplay that
makes or breaks Afterburner
and it's got plenty to offer, my
favourite part being the locking
on, launching and eventual
impact of a missile as it takes
out an enemy plane.

The Games Summer
Edition
It had to happen. When Epyx
released the Games Winter
Edition in the summer I just
knew the Summer Edition was
coming in the winter. I  also
knew i t would be worth the
wait.
The 'Games' series have
always set the pace for sports'
simulations and seem to  get
better and better, confounding
those who thought the series
had to end with Winter Games.
This is the fourth compendium
since then and the seventh
overall.
Now eight players can
represent any of 24 countries,
each with their own ﬂag and
national anthem, in eight gruel-
ling events. You'll need both
strength and timing to clear the
bar in the demanding pole vault
event but that's just a taste of
things to come because next
you get a  chance to  tr y  a
circular swing, salto turn o r
long hang kip while going
through your routine on the
V I I I = E M
unparallel bars. The gymnastic
rings i s  another equally
demanding event in which you
strive to perfect inverted hangs,
shoulderstands and the punish-
ing pikes as you try to impress
the crowd, judges and go for
Gold.
The H a m m e r  e v e n t
demands strength and power to
hurl the weight further than
anyone else whereas, in con-
trast, diving requires precision
and agility. Finally, there are
still the gruelling cycling, hur-
dles and archery events to test
whatever abilities you have left
after that lot.
Thunderblade
US Gold is i n  the enviable
position of being poised to have
it's third consecutive Christmas
number one smash hit. In 1986,
it was the monsters, magic and
mayhem of Gauntlet, last year
it was Outrun, and this year US
Gold are putting everything
behind this coin-op conversion
of Thunderblade.
Thunderblade is actually
the arcade sequel to  Sega's
Afterburner which is Media-
genic's tip for the top. Will these
two go head to head for the top
spot? That will only become
clear by Christmas because
both a r e  scheduled f o r
December launches.
The Thunderblade o f the
title is a mean ﬂying machine
that bristles with accurate and
sophisticated weaponry and
has t h e  p o w e r t o  o u t -
manoeuvre even the fastest jet
ﬁghter. It will be your job to
ﬂy this on four missions.
Your ﬁrst sortie is into a city
where you have to blast your
way through skyscrapers under
a constant onslaught b y  a
persistent enemy. The graphics
here are particularly impressive
as you can swoop down and
climb up between the towering
skyscrapers, adding depth to a
shoot-em-up for the ﬁrst time.
If you survive the ci ty
attack, you then ﬂy out to sea
to attack what's described as a
military ship, covered i n  so
many defence systems that it's
hard to imagine how it stays
aﬂoat.
In the ﬁrst two missions, the
game is played as if you were
looking down on top of Thun-
derblade. As you head back
inland, it's time to change your
view to a head-on display (as
opposed to heads up). You still
see Thunderblade but this time
it's heading straight towards the
action. Enemy ﬁghters and
gunships constantly ﬁre at you
as you ﬂy through a  rocky
canyon and then onwards into
dense, lush forests. This tilting
display adds a new feel to the
game and I wonder how many
will prefer the top down style
to the full frontal assault. Either
way, the action is still non-stop
and the graphics superb.
Thunderblade has been
selected as the Pepsi Challenge
Game of the Year and is there-
fore sure to get the promotional
support o f this drinks' giant.
How about, 'Pepsi quenches
your thirst, Thunderblade
quenches your thirst for action.'
Whatever the ads may say,
prepare f o r  ta k e - o ff i n
December and look fo r this
high ﬂyer shooting straight to
the top.

EktlE SPECIﬁ
Even the briefest look at a
Games Summer Edition screen-
shot will show the improve-
ments i n  graphics t h a t
have developed from side on
views to 3D almost TV-style
presentation. For example, the
cycling screen is split into three,
two 3D sections depicting each
rider with the third showing
their positions on the track.
Similarly, the archery screen
includes an insert so you can
zoom in on your bowmanship,
and the hammer throwing beg-
ins with a  close-up o f  the
competitor in the nets and then
zooms out to cover the throw.
All this adds a new dimension
to the Games format.
The Games Summer Edi-
tion goes further still and is
more than just another collec-
tion o f  events. There i s a
coaching manual in the instmc-
lion book as well as a slow
P 4 1
motion, action replay option
for the gymnastic events so that
you can closely examine your
technique to correct any tiny
errors that have stopped you
scoring maximum.
Epyx's Games have already
set new standards with a series
of superb sports simulations
and, although this Summer
Edition will appear long after
the Olympics have left Seoul,
it will be the sports game for
others to beat for the next four
years.

Around the World in Eighty Days
Question: What's green and goes round the world in eighty
days? Answer: Phileas Frog!
Pandora may not be the best - known software house
in the industry but they are beginning to develop something
of a name for themselves. Their ﬁrst release, Eagle's Nest,
was one of the better Gauntlet clones, released at a time
when there was a spate o f them, noteworthy because it
was set in the Second World War rather than against the
usual fantasy background.
Now, they have turned to the classics for their latest
title which is based on the book by Jules Verne and
programmed for them by Rainbow Arts. It's a sign of the
times that most people will probably be more familiar with
the cinema version rather than the book, even the press
release states that there is only a passing relationship between
the book and the game.
The journey starts with a bet. Relaxing in his London
club, the Reform in Pall Mall, Phileas Fogg (not Phineas
as is usually written) makes a bet with ﬁve of his fellow
members. The amount is twenty thousand pounds - a huge
amount in those days - and the subject of the wager is
that he can make a tour of the world in eighty days (1872),
or less, returning to the club whence he started.
Pausing only to  return home to  pick up •
manservant Passepartout and his carpet bag full of money,
Fogg's trip begins, only to develop very quickly into a series
of adventures. The journey is scheduled to pass through
India, Japan and North America although, naturally, you
will ﬁnd yourself making the odd detour. The best laid
plans of mice and men...
Money management is crucial to the game. Starting with
twenty thousand pounds (half your personal fortune), you
have to ensure that you always have sufﬁcient funds for
tickets, bribery and sundry other emergencies. Amongst the
modes of travel used are train, an assortment o f water-
borne vessels and elephant. To hinder your progress further.
there is the evil Mr Fix, an inane detective convinced that
Fogg was responsible for a large bank robbery, who is out
to thwart our hero at every turn.
The games combines arcade sequences with strategic
planning of your travels and you can expect to have to
battle your way out of an Indian temple, ﬁnd a path across
the jungle, avoid a pack o f man-eating wolves in North
America, escape from the London dungeons and even
perform an acrobatic display to get yourself out of another
mess.
The game combines arcade sequences with strategic
music and sound effects to match. As everybody knows,
Fogg managed to win his bet by virtue of travelling round
the world east to west and effectively gaining an extra day
when he crossed the International Date Line. Now it is
up to you to prove that it was no ﬂuke.

Operation Wolf
This is arcade action at it's best.
Armed with a few sub-machine
gun clips and enough rockets
to keep the main enemy assault
at bay, you must blast your way
through villages and swamps
and jungle screens to rescue a
group of hostages, in screen
after screen of combat.
The screen display is split
into two with the right hand
side occupied by  a  display
showing the amount of ammo
you have le ft, y our  a ll-
important score a nd t he
number of enemy soldiers, tanks
and helicopters remaining in
this section of the game. It's
unlikely that you will ever have
time to give this more than a
passing glance for, as soon as
you've tightened your boots,
slid your knife into its shoulder
sheath and released the safety
catch on your automatic sub-
machine gun, t he  enemy
quickly strikes.
The main display, a 3D view
of the village, jungle clearing or
swamp that you're in, begins to
scroll slightly as the attack
begins. In this game it pays to
keep moving.
Suddenly, they're on you.
Enemy troops charge at you
with guns blazing and only
well-aimed shots can save you.
After mowing them down,
there's no time to congratulate
yourself as another wave
attacks. This time they've
brought in reinforcements as
paratroopers land to join in the
assault. Just as you're about to
cut them down before they land
to hurl their grenades at you,
a soldier appears right in front
of you and he's poised to ﬁre!
If you survive that lot you
may even stand a  chance
against the tanks that roll
across the screen. You can take
these out either by scoring
several hits with your gun or
by unleashing one of  your
rockets at them and then watch
the ﬂames engulf them. The
choice is yours but, either way,
it must be destroyed before it
destroys you.
If you think the tanks are
bad then just wait until the
helicopter gunships appear.
These have to be taken out by
rockets or you won't live long
-
enough to try anything else.
Even t h e  helicopters
wouldn't be too difﬁcult on
their own but when you're
facing a gunship, tank and a
screenful of paratroopers and
ground troops, things start to
get a little difﬁcult and this isn't
one of those games with a smart
bomb to get you out of trouble
when the going gets too tough.
You have to ﬁght it out to the
bitter end.
Unfortunately, you can't
just keep the ﬁre button pressed
and blast anything and every-
thing that moves or  you'll
quickly run out of ammo and
shoot some of the innocent
stretcher bearers that always
manage to get in my way. This
not only troubles your con-
science but also your score as
you lose points.
It's not all bad news because
you'll also ﬁnd extra packs of
bullets and rockets to rearm
yourself and bottles of medicine
to patch up your wounds and
let you ﬁght a little longer.
If you like your games fast
and tough then you'll love
Operation Wolf. It's been a
smash hit in the arcades and
is sure to repeat its success on
the CM.
