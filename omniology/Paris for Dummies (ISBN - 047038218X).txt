Introduction
P
aris has been coveted since the Romans wrested away this settle-
ment from a tribe of peaceful fishermen called the Parisii and named
it Lutetia, Parisiorum. A fascination with the city grew over nearly 2,000
years. It’s not just the culture — though you can visit a different museum
every day for a year and still not hit all of the exhibits. Nor is it Paris’s
breathtaking beauty — from the curved Beaux-Arts apartment buildings
to the graceful bridges arching over the Seine to the eye-pleasing formal
gardens balanced by natural parks to exquisite store windows and unex-
pected vistas.
If this is your first visit or if you haven’t been to Paris in a decade or
more, you may just find your heart stolen by this legendary city.
You’re also in for some changes. Parisians are trying mightily to over-
come the stereotype that they are collectively a rude bunch. Service at
stores and in restaurants can actually be downright warm, especially
when foreigners take the time to acknowledge storekeepers and waiters
with a pleasant smile and a simple, “bonjour” (hello).
I hope during your visit you will find, like I do, that Paris is an eternal
source of discovery. Even what looks to be a familiar walk will yield sur-
prises — a passage that veers off the main road into a park; an unusual
building; a cluster of houses containing some half-forgotten history from
centuries past. Or maybe you’ll discover the Parisian way of life where
relaxing in a cafe and watching the world go by is a natural part of every
day. It can be quite addictive!
Paris is more than a city; it’s an encounter. Every visitor here experi-
ences Paris’s glory in an individual and unique way, and as always, I
hope the city grabs a hold of your heart so that once your time here is
finished, you’ll itch to return.
About This Book
Consider this a textbook of sorts that you don’t have to read from front
to back, with your visit to Paris your test (there are no failing grades,
however!). Basically Paris For Dummies presents you with to-the-point
information on Paris that’s fun and easy to access. I explain very basic
information about the city for readers who have never visited and dis-
cuss points of interest for the seasoned traveler.
Please be advised that travel information is subject to change at any
time — and this is especially true of prices. Always write or call ahead

for confirmation when making your travel plans. The author, editors, 
and publisher cannot be held responsible for the experiences of readers
while traveling. Your safety is important to us, however, so we encour-
age you to stay alert and be aware of your surroundings. Keep a close
eye on cameras, purses, and wallets, all favorite targets of thieves and
pickpockets.
Conventions Used in This Book
Paris For Dummies is a reference book, meaning you may read the chap-
ters in any order you want. We use some standard listings for hotels,
restaurants, and sights. These listings enable you to open the book to
any chapter and access the information you need quickly and easily.
In this book, we include lists of hotels, restaurants, and attractions. As
we describe each, we often include abbreviations for commonly accepted
credit cards. Take a look at the following list for an explanation of each.
AE: American Express
DC: Diners Club
DISC: Discover
MC: MasterCard
V: Visa
Also included is some general pricing information to help you as you
decide where to unpack your bags or dine on the local cuisine. We use 
a system of euros and dollar signs to show a range of costs for one night
in a hotel (the price refers to a double-occupancy room) in Chapter 9 
or a meal at a restaurant (included in the cost of each meal is soup or
salad, an entree, dessert, and a nonalcoholic drink) in Chapter 10.
Always included are the Paris arrondissements, or administrative dis-
tricts, in each address to give you a better idea of where each place is
located. Paris is divided into 20 arrondissements, which spiral out like a

Dummies Post-it® Flags
As you read this book, you’ll find information that you’ll want to reference as you plan
or enjoy your trip — whether it be a new hotel, a must-see attraction, or a must-try
walking tour. Mark these pages with the handy Post-it® Flags included in this book to
help make your trip planning easier!

snail shell from the first arrondissement in the very center of Paris
(abbreviated 1er), to the 20th on the outer edges of the city (abbreviated
20e). The arrondissement number appears after the street address in
each citation in this book. For example, “55 bd. St-Michel, 5e,” indicates
the building numbered 55 on the boulevard St-Michel is in the 5th
arrondissement. To get an idea of where each arrondissement is located,
consult the “Paris at a Glance” map in Chapter 1. Street abbreviations
used throughout the book include not only bd. (boulevard), but also rue
(street), av. (avenue), place (square), bis (an odd term generally mean-
ing an address between two buildings), ter (terrace), or quai (quay or
riverbank).
To help you orient yourself, we also give the nearest métro (subway)
stop for all destinations (for example, Métro: Pont Marie).
Although exchange rates can and do fluctuate daily, the price conver-
sions in this book were calculated at the rate of 1 (the local currency,
the euro) to $1.60 (U.S. dollars). For more information about the euro,
see Chapter 4.
Foolish Assumptions
As we wrote this book, we made some assumptions about you and your
needs as a traveler.
 You may be an experienced traveler who hasn’t had much time to
explore Paris and wants expert advice when you finally do get a
chance to enjoy that particular locale.
 You may be an inexperienced traveler looking for guidance when
determining whether to take a trip to Paris and how to plan for it.
 You’re not looking for a book that provides all the information avail-
able about Paris or that lists every hotel, restaurant, or attraction
available to you. Instead, you’re looking for a book that focuses on
the places that give you the best or most unique experience in
Paris.
If you fit any of these criteria, Paris For Dummies gives you the informa-
tion you’re looking for!
How This Book Is Organized
Paris For Dummies is divided into seven parts with two appendixes. If
you read the parts in sequential order, they can guide you through all
the advance-planning aspects of your trip and then get you off and run-
ning while you’re in the City of Light.
Introduction 3

Part I: Introducing Paris
Provided here is a “best-of” overview of the city, some basic history and
architecture, and the variety of events Paris offers at different times of
the year.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Paris
Should I use a travel agent or go it alone? Is travel insurance a good
idea? These chapters touch on everything you need to consider before
planning a trip, including hints on developing a realistic budget and
what options are available to travelers with special needs or interests.
Part III: Settling into Paris
Some of the city’s best moderately priced hotels (with a few super-
budget and some deluxe resorts thrown in for good measure) are listed
here, as well as advice on how to tie up those frustrating last-minute
details that can unnerve the most seasoned of travelers. You’ll learn in
no time what kind of accommodations to choose in Paris and why you
don’t have to pay full price at hotel chains.
Tips on everything from navigating your way through Customs to getting
to your hotel from the airport to discovering Paris neighborhood by
neighborhood orient you to Paris in no time. You find out how to use the
city’s terrific transportation system, why you shouldn’t rent a car here,
and what to know when you hail a cab. You make sense of the euro, and
find out where to turn if your wallet gets stolen.
Paris is known for its fine food, and Chapter 10 helps you choose some
of the best restaurants for your taste and budget. Everything from mod-
erately priced to haute cuisine restaurants is listed here, so you can dis-
cover that a fine meal is truly an art in itself. We also provide street food
and light fare options for those occasions when you don’t have the time,
or the desire, for a full-course meal.
Part IV: Exploring Paris
How to get to Paris’s top sights, how much they cost, how much time to
devote to them, and handy indexes by sight, type, and neighborhood
make Paris’s most famous attractions (and some not so famous but just
as good) easier to find. There are kid- and teen-specific sights, as well as
information on orientation and other tours, a shopper’s guide to Paris,
three recommended itineraries, and five great day trips if you’d like to
explore outside of the city.
Part V: Living It Up After Dark: Paris Nightlife
Part V gives you all the information you need about seeing plays, opera,
ballet, and live music as well as which nightclubs and bars are the most
fun. We are honest about whether the spectacles for which Paris has
come to be known — the cabarets — are truly worth it. Uncover what’s
Paris For Dummies, 5th Edition

going on and where you can get reduced-rate tickets. Nothing is more
beautiful than Paris at night, when the city’s monuments are lit up like a
stage. Anything can happen!
Part VI: The Part of Tens
What For Dummies book would be complete without a Part of Tens?
Included is a quick collection of such fun tidbits as and great views of
Paris without the lines and best places for a picnic — a quintessential
Parisian pastime!
Appendixes
In the back of this book is Appendix A, a Quick Concierge that contains
lots of handy information you may need when traveling in Paris: phone
numbers and addresses of emergency personnel, area hospitals, and
pharmacies; lists of local newspapers and magazines; protocol for send-
ing mail and finding taxis; and more. Check out this appendix when
searching for answers to lots of little questions that may come up as you
travel. You can find the Quick Concierge easily because it’s printed on
yellow paper.
Appendix B is a glossary of English-to-French translations of basic
vocabulary and health, travel, and (of course) shopping terms.
Icons Used in This Book
The following icons are scattered throughout the margins of this guide
and are meant to draw your attention to especially useful text.
Keep an eye out for the Bargain Alert icon as you seek out money-saving
tips and/or great deals.
The Best of the Best icon highlights the best Paris has to offer in all 
categories — hotels, restaurants, attractions, activities, shopping, and
nightlife.
You see this icon whenever something needs your particular attention.
When you need to be aware of a rip-off, an overrated sight, a dubious
deal, or any other trap set for unsuspecting travelers, this icon alerts
you to that fact. These hints also offer the lowdown on the quirks, eti-
quette, and unwritten rules of the area so you can avoid looking like a
tourist and, instead, be treated more like a local.
This icon is a catchall for any special hint, tip, or bit of insider’s advice
that can help make your trip run more smoothly. Really, the point of a
travel guide is to serve as one gigantic tip, but this icon singles out those
nuggets of knowledge you may not have run across before or of which
you can make immediate use.
Introduction 5

This icon, in addition to flagging tips and resources of special interest 
to families, points out the most child-friendly hotels, restaurants, and
attractions. If you need a baby sitter at your hotel, a welcoming relaxed
atmosphere at a restaurant, or a dazzling site that delights your child,
look for this icon. Information is included regarding larger, family-sized
rooms at hotels and restaurants that serve meals that go easy on your
little ones’ tummies.
Sometimes a great hotel, restaurant, or attraction may be a bit out of the
center or require a bit of effort to get to. This icon alerts you to these
secret finds, and you can rest assured, no spots are included that aren’t
truly worth the energy. This icon also signifies any resource that’s par-
ticularly useful and worth the time to seek out.
Where to Go from Here
Where else? To Paris! Paris For Dummies shows you just how accessible
this city can be. Included is a selective list of some of the best hotel,
dining, and touring options along with insider info to help you make
informed decisions. Follow the advice laid out here, and you’ll want to
return to Paris again and again.

Introducing Paris

In this part . . . 
A
re you a stranger to Paris? Or has it been a long time
since you last visited? Then (re)introduce yourself to
the city and whet your appetite to ﬁnd out more about it. In
Chapter 1, you get an overview of Paris and learn about the
best the city has to offer. Chapter 2 gives you a crash course
in Paris’s history and architecture, brieﬂy introduces you to
French cuisine, soothes any worries you may have about the
language, and recommends some great books and movies to
enhance your understanding of the city. In Chapter 3, the
pros and cons of the seasons as well as a Paris calendar of
events helps you decide the perfect time for your visit.

Chapter 1
Discovering the
Best of Paris
In This Chapter
 Paris’s best sights
 Paris’s best accommodations for every price range
 Food, glorious food, the best bars, a shopping nirvana, and the best culture,
parks, and gardens
T
he euro is devastating the dollar. Gas prices have never been so
high. Airlines are charging for checked baggage. Planning a trip any-
where during these times may seem like an unaffordable luxury, and to
Paris of all places — well, you may be hearing from all fronts how expen-
sive it is. I’m here to tell you that, though prices are higher than they are
at home, you don’t have to break the bank to visit. Paris For Dummies is
designed to give you an overview of all types of hotels, restaurants, and
shopping in all price ranges. But I include tips, too, on how to save —
and let you know when spending more is justified.
So, go ahead and visit one of the world’s most beautiful and celebrated
cities with what could be one of the best attractions of all — a way of life
in which relaxing in a cafe and watching the world go by are natural
parts of the day. Where you can, build into your itinerary time to linger
and get lost — getting lost, after all, costs nothing. Discovering a tiny
shop instead of a subway station or a pretty park around a bend can be
more fun than a planned trip to a famous monument. And as for those
famous monuments and museums: Yes, you’ll discover that the Louvre
is as incredible as its reputation, but did you know that the Musée du
quai Branly has opened up near the Eiffel Tower and displays some of
the Louvre’s former treasures? And what a great time to visit — the
Orangerie, closed for nearly a decade, has reopened, and Monet’s Water
Lilies here are spectacular! You’ll find that taking a motorboat tour of
the Seine is one of the best ways to see Paris, but why not rent a row-
boat in the Bois de Boulogne and the Bois de Vincennes, two big, beau-
tiful parks on each side of Paris that are a haven from the city’s bustle?
Whatever you do, you’ll quickly discover that Paris (see map “Paris at a
Glance”) is more of an experience than merely a city, and each visitor
experiences it in an entirely individual way.

This chapter is designed as an at-a-glance reference to the absolute best — 
the best of the best in my opinion — that Paris has to offer. Each of these
experiences and places is discussed in detail later in the book; you can
find them in their indicated chapter, marked with a Best of the Best icon.
The Best Accommodations
With more than 2,200 chain hotels, deluxe palacelike accommodations,
hotels that cater to business travelers, budget hotels, and mom-and-pop
establishments, it’s difficult to narrow things down to just a few. But the
hotels here are the hotels that, in my opinion, you’ll want to return to on
your next visit (because no one can see Paris just once!). I only list hotels
in the first eight arrondissements, the most central locations in Paris.
See Chapter 9 for more information on the accommodations listed here.
 I love the Hôtel de l’Abbaye Saint-Germain (6e), a former convent
on the Left Bank that is simply charming, with five-star service and
beautiful tranquil surroundings. Rooftop suites and some first-floor
rooms open onto vine-covered terraces, and the fabulous duplex
apartment is terrific for honeymooners.
 In a city where accommodations range from the ultra-luxurious to the
barely inhabitable, Hôtel Verneuil (7e) offers the elegance of a small
boutique hotel at a reasonable price located just a short walk from St-
Germain-des-Prés, the Louvre, the Musée D’Orsay, and the Seine.
 The impressive, airy Hôtel du Jeu de Paume on the exclusive Ile
St-Louis was once a 17th century jeu de paume (the precursor to
tennis) court, and you can still see the wooden skeleton rising from
the open lobby. This is one of Paris’s more unusual hotels, success-
fully combining sumptuous ancient and modern décor, and guests
have their choice of staying in rooms or, for more than five days,
private apartments. It’s located right down the street from Notre-
Dame and Left and Right Bank bridges.
The Best Food
No matter where you decide to dine or what kind of food you choose,
you can count on having some of the most memorable meals of your life
in Paris! The following list contains some of my favorite restaurants (the
information in parentheses indicates the arrondissement in which each
establishment is located). See Chapter 10 for more information on the
restaurants listed here.
 Le Cinq (8e): Ah, to be able to dine here daily! This multi-Michelin-
starred restaurant in the Four Seasons George V is truly extraordi-
nary, from exquisite pull-out-all-the-stops food to its award winning
sommelier and fantastic wine cellar. If you want a once-in-a-lifetime
dining experience, you won’t be disappointed.
Part I: Introducing Paris 
12

 Le 404 (3e): You may join staff and patrons dancing on the bar at
the end of your dinner at this hip and fun Moroccan restaurant not
far from the heart of the Marais. You’ll be talking to your neighbors
over tasty tajines, couscous, and pastilla and toasting to new friend-
ships with a crisp regional wine.
 Le Potager du Marais (3e): Vegetarians, rejoice! This tiny restau-
rant near the Centre Pompidou serves delicious French and other
standards that happen to be meatless (there are also some options
for vegans). Diners sit at a long communal table and the place is
always packed (reservations for dinner are strongly suggested);
there’s such a friendly vibe, you almost won’t be able to help talk-
ing to others around you.
The Best Sights
What’s a visit to Paris without seeing the view from the Eiffel Tower (even
though there are other great views that incorporate the famous landmark)?
For most people, the real reason for visiting Paris is to see the quintes-
sentially French attractions for which the city is known. Are the sights
really as great as returning travelers say? Mais oui! Here are just a few of
the best. See Chapter 11 for more information on the sights listed here.
 You can’t miss the city’s most famous landmark, the Eiffel Tower,
which graces the city skyline with its lacy presence. At night for ten
minutes each hour until it closes, the tower bursts into glittering
light from 30,000 bulbs. Mail your postcards and letters from the
tower’s very own post office located the first level up; they’ll get a
special Tour Eiffel postmark.
 Take a tour boat down the Seine at night and see lights from
bridges older than the United States cast reflections in the water.
English-language commentary is included. (Even better: Take one of
Fat Tire Bike’s night bike tours around the city. Included in the
price is a Seine boat ride.)
 The Musée d’Orsay, a former train station, has an unsurpassed col-
lection of Impressionist masterpieces and beautiful displays of Art
Nouveau furnishings. Much less overwhelming than the Louvre and
well-located near the Seine and Eiffel Tower, this museum should
make everyone’s top five!
 Your first glimpse of the nearly 900-year-old Cathédral de Notre-
Dame just may take your breath away. Flying buttresses lend a
graceful air to what would otherwise be an imposing structure. 
Play Quasimodo and climb to the top of the bell tower (get there
early — the lines grow huge from late morning through closing,
especially in summer) or marvel at the gorgeous rose windows.
 The Arc de Triomphe was commissioned by Napoléon to honor his
army and its 128 victorious battles, but the real reason people visit
is for the view — one that takes in the Eiffel Tower. From the top,
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Paris 13

49m (162 ft.) up, you can see in a straight line the Champs-Elysées,
the obelisk in the place de la Concorde, the Louvre, and the Grande
Arche de la Défense in St-Denis, a giant open cube built to be the
modern equivalent to this arch.
 The Musée Picasso constantly rotates its exhibits that represent
every phase of Picasso’s prolific 75-year career. All of it is housed in
a beautiful 17th-century mansion deep in the Marais, one of Paris’s
best and most interesting neighborhoods.
 The Musée Nationale d’Auguste Rodin is one of Paris’s more relax-
ing museums. There are only 16 medium-sized rooms here, and
after taking in the sensual sculptures, you can stroll through the
gardens here to see more of the legendary artist’s masterpieces
such as The Thinker and The Gates of Hell.
 The Musée de Cluny is one of the jewels of Paris museums and is
home to the famous tapestry series The Lady and the Unicorn. It
houses ancient Roman hot and cold baths, the original statues
pulled off Notre-Dame in 1790 by furious revolutionaries, and so, so
much more, as well as a terrific gift shop to boot.
The Best Parks and Gardens
Paris has parks for every taste and interest offering flowers, rare plants,
and views of the city and puppet shows, pony rides, and museums. Here
are some of its best. Chapter 11 has more information.
 The Jardin des Tuileries (1er) is Paris’s most visited park, where
visitors to the Louvre next door like to revive in the fresh air and
rest their feet on conveniently placed wrought-iron chairs surround-
ing the garden’s fountains. In keeping with the French style of parks, 
trees are planted according to an orderly design and the sandy
paths are arrow straight. During the summer, a carnival features an
enormous Ferris wheel (with great views of the city) and some
other thrill rides, a fun house, arcade-style games, and snacks.
 The Jardin du Luxembourg in the Latin Quarter is Parisians’ 
most beloved park. Children love it for its playground, pony rides,
puppet theater, and the Fontaine de Médicis where they can sail 
toy boats. Make use of the tennis and boules courts (boules is a
French game similar to lawn bowling or the Italian bocce in which
players try to be the first to roll their balls closest to the small
object ball called the cochonnet), or appreciate the art exhibited on
the wrought-iron fence at the garden’s northwestern entrance near
boulevard St-Michel and rue de Médicis. Courses are offered here in
bee keeping, and the park’s orchard grows apples and pears that
end up on the plates of staff at the French Senate, which is housed
in the garden’s Palais du Luxembourg.
 Parc de la Villette (19e) is a modern park with a series of theme
gardens, including an exotic bamboo garden and one featuring
Part I: Introducing Paris 
14

steam and water jets. Scattered throughout are playgrounds and
other attractions — this is a must-visit if you’ve spent time at the
huge children’s science complex, Cité des Sciences et l’Industrie.
 Rock formations and grottoes in the tranquil Parc de Belleville
(20e) are still around from the days when the hill was a strategic
point for fighting Attila the Hun. Watch the sun set over western
Paris and take in the wonderful (free!) views of the city. Topped by
the Maison de l’Air, a museum with displays devoted to the air that
we breathe, you can enjoy fountains, a children’s play area, and an
open-air theater that holds rock concerts during the summer.
The Best Shopping
Though the city has a well-deserved reputation as a bastion of over-the-top
luxury (to understand why, head for the 8th arrondissement), discount,
resale, and overstock stores also abound, as well as the wonderful
Monoprix (see below). Whenever I’m in Paris, a visit to the following stores
is a must. See Chapter 12 for more information on the stores listed here.
 Monoprix, a reasonably priced department store with branches
around the city, has stylish clothing and is also great for accessories, 
low-priced cosmetics, lingerie, and house wares. Many locations
also have large grocery stores good for gift buying. The one at 52
av. du Champs-Elysées, 8e, is chock-full of goodies and open until
midnight.
 Le Bon Marché (6e) is elegant, but small enough to be manageable,
and is the Left Bank’s only department store. You can find the top
designers here, as well as more affordable pieces, too, and the
basement toy store has great gift selections. The third floor is par-
ticularly renowned for its large shoe selection and lingerie depart-
ment (where dressing rooms have phones to summon your
salesperson).
 Although it isn’t cheap, Le Bon Marché’s next-door grocery store,
Le Grand Épicerie (6e) is one of the best luxury supermarkets in
Paris and a great place to look for gourmet gifts such as olive oils,
homemade chocolates, or wine. It makes for wonderful one-stop
picnic shopping, too, offering a wide array of prepared foods and
cheeses. If you’re staying in an apartment or your hotel has a
kitchen for guests, come here to purchase fixings for dinner.
The Best of Culture
Getting “cultured” is not a problem in Paris. There are more than 100
theaters, competing opera houses, and ballet and chamber music con-
certs in many churches. Even if your French is rusty or not up to par,
many avant-garde productions and English-language theaters serve as
alternatives to French-language plays. In this section, I list some of the
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Paris 15

best places to see theater, watch a ballet, or hear a symphony. See
Chapter 15 for more information.
 You can see dazzling performances by the national opera and ballet
troupes that perform at both the radiant Palais Garnier (9e) and
the ultramodern Opéra National de Bastille (11e). The Palais
Garnier conducts more ballet performances, and the Opéra Bastille
puts on more opera.
 A good mix of modern and classic tragedies and comedies comes
alive in wonderful performances in the Salle Richelieu of the
Comédie-Française, 2 rue de Richelieu, 1er.
 For popular, contemporary plays, the Théâtre National de
Chaillot, place du Trocadéro, 16e, is your place.
 Whatever your choice of the classic arts — opera, ballet, concerts,
recitals — you’ll find it performed at the Châtelet, Théâtre Musical
de Paris (1er) by local and international performers of the highest
caliber.
 More than a dozen Parisian churches regularly schedule relatively
inexpensive organ recitals and concerts. The most glorious, where
the music is nearly outdone by the glorious stained glass windows,
is Sainte-Chapelle (4e).
The Best Clubs
Each neighborhood makes a different contribution to Paris’s vibrant
nightlife scene. Listed here are some of the best places to dance the
night away. See Chapter 16 for more information.
 Barrio Latino (11e) has three bars on four floors, private areas
where you can see (but not be seen), a second floor restaurant
serving Latino food, a top-floor private club with a kitschy Che
Guevara mural, and energetic Latin music that sets everyone to
dancing. It’s pure fun!
 Batofar (13e), an Irish light ship docked right in the Seine, is one
hot, sweaty, and ultimately fun time right on the Seine, with all
types of music represented, from drum-and-bass to British pop.
 Where else in Paris will you dance to the Hives and the Cure fol-
lowed by some electro-pop spun by great DJs (and down some
great beer, too)? It’s at the unassuming Le Truskel (2e), an Irish
pub with a basement “microclub” that has been drawing in crowds
of 20-somethings since it opened in 2002.
 Le Mix (15e) boasts spinning provided by music gurus Ministry of
Sound and David Guetta (a holy name among clubbers).

History 101: The Main Events
The ancient times
The Parisii tribe settled Paris in the third century B.C. on the Ile de la
Cité (one of two islands in the Seine around Central Paris — these days,
Notre-Dame sits on Ile de la Cité). They were peaceful fishermen who
traded with other tribes along the river and with travelers on the main
north-south trading road that connected the Mediterranean with north-
ern Europe. Unfortunately, the road made attacking the Parisii all too
convenient for invaders. The first and most successful were the Romans
led by Julius Caesar in 52 B.C. During the Romans’s 500-year stay, the set-
tlement became known as Lutetia Parisiorum (Lutèce in French). You can
still see the Roman public baths at the Musée National du Moyen
Age/Cluny Museum in the Latin Quarter.
Years of barbarian invasions eventually weakened Rome’s hold over 
the territory. Around A.D. 350, Attila the Hun, on his way to sack Paris,
changed course at the last minute, purportedly due to the prayers of a
young girl named Geneviève. She became the patron saint of Paris. In
the 400s, Franks from the east successfully wrested control away from
the Romans. In 508, Clovis, king of the Franks, chose Paris as his capital.
It was abandoned as a capital 250 years later only to regain that status in

987 when Hugues Capet was proclaimed king of France. Celebrating the
city’s importance, two Gothic masterpieces, the cathedrals of Notre-
Dame and Sainte-Chapelle, were built on the Ile de la Cité. Across the
river, on the Left Bank, the University of Paris was founded in the
mid–12th century, although now referred to as La Sorbonne, named after
the Collège de Sorbonne, founded in 1257.
Revolutionary Paris
Under Louis XIV, who ruled for 72 years, the monarchy’s power reached
its height, supported by heavy taxes. Although he added monuments
and splendor to the city, the Sun King moved his court to Versailles,
alienating the citizenry and preparing the way for the French Revolution.
On July 14, 1789, a mob stormed the Bastille prison, which held many
who were out of favor with French royalty. To most French citizens at
the time, the Bastille was a sign of much that was wrong with the monar-
chy, and the attack on the Bastille came to represent the end of the
monarchy. Three days later at the Hôtel de Ville, Louis XVI was forced 
to kiss the new French tricolor. On July 14, 1790, the Festival of the
Federation was celebrated on the Champs de Mars, and an estimated
300,000 attended a Mass at which the king swore an oath of loyalty to
the constitution. Still, radical factions grew. On August 10, 1792, revolu-
tionary troops joined a Parisian mob storming the Tuileries Palace,
where the king lived and took him prisoner. In 1793, he and Queen Marie
Antoinette were beheaded in the place de la Concorde. At this time,
Maximilien Robespierre was elected leader of the Committee of Public
Safety, which conducted witch hunts for those it deemed counter-
revolutionaries. This became known as the Reign of Terror. Between
September 1793 and February 1794, 238 men and 31 women were tried
and executed for crimes against the state. Nearly 5,500 more awaited
trial in prisons until Robespierre’s arrest in July 1794. He was executed
the same month.
The era of Napoléons
During the last stage of the French Revolution, a directory of five men
was ushered in to govern France. After four years, Napoléon staged a
coup (1799), turning the country into a dictatorship. Five years later,
(1804) at Notre-Dame, Napoléon crowned himself emperor and his wife,
Joséphine, empress. After applying the Code Napoléon over all French
territory, the Corsican general embarked on a series of military cam-
paigns until his defeat at Waterloo in 1815. During his reign, he gave
Paris many of its most grandiose monuments, notably the Arc de
Triomphe and the Bourse, but his greatest gift was starting the Louvre.
After the fall of Napoléon, the monarchy was restored through the
Bourbon Restoration, placing Charles X on the throne. In 1830 the July
Monarchy replaced Charles with King Louis Philippe, of the House of
Orléans. His government lasted until the Revolution of 1848, which
brought about the Second Republic and the 1851 election of Louis
Napoléon, nephew of the original emperor. The first president of the
Part I: Introducing Paris 
18

French republic, Louis was also known as Napoléon III after he estab-
lished the Second Empire (1852–1870) and therefore also holds the dis-
tinction of being France’s last monarch.
During the 19th century France experienced the intellectual and artistic
developments that define it as a nation today. In Paris, the Second
Empire was a time of architectural and urban evolution through the
plans of Baron Georges Haussmann. Commissioned by Napoléon III to
modernize the twisty, medieval city, it was Haussmann who created the
wide boulevards and the wrought iron balconies that so clearly define
the Paris of today.
Modern Paris
The Eiffel Tower (La Tour Eiffel), built only as a temporary structure for
the 1889 World’s Fair, was at one time the tallest structure in the world.
Paris opened its first métro line in 1900, and by the turn of the 20th cen-
tury, had thousands of restaurants and 27,000 cafes.
In the years that followed, Paris witnessed two world wars with more
than ten million military casualties, nearly one million Jews losing their
lives, and four years of German occupation. Tens of thousands of sol-
diers died fighting the end of French colonial rule around the world.
In 1968, students took to the streets of Paris, rebelling against France’s
antiquated educational system among a host of other causes, including
the rights of workers (this period of time is known in France as Mai
1968). Charles De Gaulle’s government tried to quash the strikes with
police action, but only succeeded in making the situation worse. Young
people hurled paving stones at police in street battles, and ten million
French workers throughout the country went on strike. This nearly led
to the collapse of the government, and De Gaulle called for new elec-
tions. Almost as quickly as the student and worker revolution started, it
was over by June 1968 when voters elected an even stronger De Gaulle
administration. De Gaulle, himself, resigned in 1969. The government
flirted unsuccessfully with socialism in the 1980s and ended the decade
with a great celebration of democracy: the bicentennial of the French
Revolution and the centennial of the Eiffel Tower.
Former Paris Mayor Jacques Chirac was elected president in 1995 on 
his promise to jump-start the economy, but growth remained stagnant,
and the president was forced to share power with Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin.
In 2005, as a result of the accidental electrocution of two teenagers of
African and North African descent, riots broke out in Paris resulting in
the burning of thousands of cars and trucks in the Ile-de-France region.
The anger and violence turned into a months-long series of riots that
spread throughout urban areas of France. The situation was not helped
when former Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy referred to the suburban
youth as racaille, meaning lowlife or scum. The year 2006 saw continual
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Paris 19

clashes between the citizenry and the French government when over a
million people took part in student strikes opposing proposed changes
to the basic layout of workers’ rights in France, specifically changes that
would allow employers to fire workers under the age of 26 without giving
an officially stated reason.
In a very heated and publicly debated election, in 2007 Nicolas Sarkozy
became the President of France. His presidency has proven to be contro-
versial for a number of reasons. The French have been totally put off by
his personality; supposedly he is often tactless and impulsive. The media 
frenzy covering his marriage to former model and singer-songwriter
Carla Bruni, and the subsequent tabloid coverage of their life together, is
regarded as unnecessary and distasteful. Politically and economically,
his promise to totally revamp the nation’s economy to a more American
model (including a stronger work ethic) was met with equal welcome
and disdain from various sectors of society. Implementing his proposed
changes has proven to be less fruitful than many hoped (or feared), but
since he has been elected France no longer has a maximum 35-hour
workweek, and some taxes have been reduced.
Another cultural and political shift in France that may surprise return
voyagers is the February 2007 legislation making it illegal to smoke in
public places; this includes cafes, bars, restaurants, and other venues.
The public has responded with polarized opinions about the ban, but
most respect the new laws.
Building Blocks: Local Architecture
First-time visitors to Paris are struck by the graceful curves and balconies
of the city’s gorgeous apartment buildings, many of which were built
during the reign of Napoléon III (mid-1800s) under Baron Haussmann,
the appointed urban planner by the emperor. In addition to the mixture
of styles associated with the 19th and 20th centuries, different architec-
tural eras are represented in Paris, among them the Ancient Roman,
Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, classical (classicism), and rococo
periods. You can see artifacts from Paris’s founding in the third century
B.C. by a tribe of fishermen, as well as such modern-day projects as the
guts-on-the-outside Centre Georges Pompidou and I.M. Pei’s glass pyra-
mid at the Louvre.
Paris’s important architectural periods are outlined here.
 Ancient Roman (125 B.C.–A.D. 450): After Julius Caesar conquered
the island of Lutétia, his legions began using bricks and concrete 
in building and introduced the load-bearing arch, which led to the
construction of stronger bridges and doorways. You can see exam-
ples of excavated Roman ruins at the Crypte Archéologique (see
Chapter 11), about 60m (200 ft.) directly in front of the entrance 
of Notre-Dame. Possibly the most important ancient ruins are the
Roman baths in the cellar of the Cluny Museum (also in Chapter 11), 
Part I: Introducing Paris 
20

a former private residence that was built around and on top of the
ruins, and the Arènes de Lutèce, an amphitheater from the 1st cen-
tury A.D. Unearthed during the construction of rue Monge in the
1860s, the public gathering place held gladiator competitions and
could house up to 15,000 people.
 Romanesque (800–1100): This style is characterized by arches and
curves, thick walls with small windows, huge piers to hold up the
roof, simple geometric arrangements, and painting in decorative
hues. The architects during this period built large churches; none
survive intact in Paris; all were improved upon with different archi-
tectural styles or rebuilt. St-Germain-des-Prés is a Romanesque
building with a Gothic interior. St-Julien-le-Pauvre was originally a
Romanesque church, but later Gothic additions obscure the origi-
nal details.
 Gothic (1100–1500): Known for its slender vertical piers and coun-
terbalancing buttresses and for vaulting and pointed arches that
allow for taller and thinner structures, the interiors of these build-
ings force the eyes upward. Windows with stained glass were con-
structed so that most of the illiterate population could understand
the stories told in each pane. Gargoyles (drain spouts), spires,
flying buttresses, rose windows, and choir screens were all features
of the Gothic church. The best examples are Notre-Dame, of
course, and the Cathédrale de Notre-Dame de Chartres (Chapter
14 describes this cathedral in more detail).
 Renaissance (1500–1630): This architectural style is characterized
by harmonious form, mathematical proportion, and a unit of meas-
urement based on the human scale. Roofs became steeply pitched,
and dormer windows were built taller, using stone. The mansions
surrounding the Place des Vosges are all Renaissance, as is the
Hôtel Carnavalet, home to the Musée Carnavalet.
 Classicism (1630–1800): In this school, the emphasis was on form,
simplicity, proportion, and restraint, influenced by the architecture of
ancient Greece and Rome. Exteriors in the classical style may feature
Doric, Corinthian, and Ionic columns, low and simple dormer win-
dows, mansard roofs (having two slopes on all sides with the lower
slope steeper than the upper, invented by François Mansard), and
simple proportions; the interiors of classical buildings went over the
top. This interior style is known as rococo, derived from the words
rocaille (rock) and coquille (shell), delicate decorative motifs that
appeared along with scrolls, branches of leaves, flowers, and bamboo
stems. The best example of classicism and rococo is Versailles (see
Chapter 14). The Louvre is also a classical tour de force.
 Nineteenth century (1800–1889): This style began with neoclassi-
cism, a return to the majesty of past civilizations, and an adoption
of classical forms and styles. Examples include the Arc de Triomphe
and the Madeleine. The Second Empire brought wide boulevards
lined with six-story apartment buildings with balconies and mansard
roofs with dormer windows. The Third Republic’s industrial age
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Paris 21

produced glass and steel structures; the most famous are the Eiffel
Tower and Sacré-Coeur.
 Art Nouveau (1890–1914): This period saw the end of the 19th cen-
tury and continued into the 20th with beautiful renderings of plants
and flowers in wrought iron (Abbesses Métro station entrance),
stained glass, wood, tile, and hand-painted wallpapers (for a won-
derful introduction to Art Nouveau, visit the middle floor of the
Musée d’Orsay; see Chapter 11).
 Twentieth to twenty-first century (1900–): Twentieth-century style
may be defined by late President François Mitterand’s grands pro-
jets (grand projects), most of which were controversial when 
completed. Richard Rogers’s and Renzo Piano’s Centre Georges
Pompidou (see Chapter 11), with its “guts on the outside” architec-
ture, horrified Parisians, as did I.M. Pei’s glass pyramids at the
Louvre, but residents have slowly come to accept them. The four
looming towers shaped like open books that comprise Mitterand’s
last project, the Bibliothèque Nationale de France, are another
story; the building, which is still suffering from the occasional tech-
nological glitch, has gotten little respect since its opening in the
late 1990s.
The Grande Arche de la Défense in nearby St-Denis was designed to
be a modern-day equivalent to the Arc de Triomphe. Mitterand
commissioned the late Danish architect Johann Otto von Spreckelsen
to build the Arche, which also completes the axe historique (a line
of historic buildings and monuments extending west from its origin
in the center of Paris; it includes the Arc de Triomphe and the
obelisk in place de la Concorde); the Grande Arche looks like a
floating square when seen from afar. Paris’s “starchitect” Jean
Nouvel, who used glass to great effect in the Fondation Cartier and
Institut du Monde Arabe late in the 20th century, has given Paris
the Musée du Quai Branly in the 21st, again making use of glass but
also promoting a more ecological theme: a wall bursting with
15,000 live plants. The result was beautiful, although some locals
complain that the plants suffer due to drainage problems. He will
continue to be present in Paris as he was selected to design the
upcoming Signal Tower in la Défense.
The new development there is part of a plan to expand Paris’s pop-
ulation of skyscrapers, as the need for space has increased greatly.
The expansion is greatly welcomed; however, the main opposition
to it is part of the Parisian Green movement, who see the buildings
as a waste of resources. The abandoned docks of the 13e just south
of Gare d’Austerlitz are morphing into a gorgeous, green waterfront
complex called Docks en Seine. Architects Jakob and Brendan
MacFarlane are building a wood and metal construction over the
warehouses to be covered with greenery, and located here will be
the French Fashion Institute (Institut Français de la Mode) bou-
tiques, a pool, restaurants, and a dance club.

A Taste of Paris: The Local Cuisine
Parisians have such wonderful meals from which to choose — regional
French, three-star haute cuisine, North African couscouseries, tasty
crêpes sold from street vendors, and more. During the last decade, the
city witnessed the rise of baby bistros, restaurants opened by celebrity
chefs and their talented young apprentices offering simpler and less-
expensive meals than those served at their deluxe establishments. Also
in vogue is a back-to-Grandmère’s-kitchen approach featuring chefs turn-
ing out homey meals such as blanquette de veau (veal stew in white
sauce), cassoulet (meat-and-vegetable casserole), and confit de canard
(duck preserved and cooked in its own fat until it’s so tender it falls off
the bone). Asian influences are also in vogue; witness the success of
L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon. I talk in more depth about dining in Paris in
Chapter 10.

Salivating over French cooking
Even with English translations, confronting a French menu can be a
daunting experience. Dishes that have been familiar to French people
since childhood are often unknown to outsiders. The following list is a
user’s guide to typical French dishes that you’re likely to encounter.
 Andouillette (ahn-dwee-et): A sausage of pork organs encased in
intestines. Andouillette has a strong flavor with a distinct aftertaste
and is usually grilled and served with mustard and french fries.
Look for the A.A.A.A.A. label — the Association Amicale des
Authentiques Amateurs d’Andouillettes (Association of Real
Andouillette Lovers) stamps it on the best andouillettes.
 Blanquette de veau (blahn-ket duh voe): Veal cooked in a white
stew that includes eggs and cream.
 Boeuf Bourguignon (buhf bor-gee-nyon): Beef cooked with red bur-
gundy wine, mushrooms, and onions.
 Boudin (boo-dan): A rich sausage made from pig’s blood, usually
combined with crème fraîche, onions, and eggs. More elaborate
versions may feature a touch of garlic or chestnuts. The dish is
often served with sautéed apples or mashed potatoes, which
enhance the slightly sweet taste of the sausage.
 Boudin blanc (boo-dan blahn): A white sausage made from veal,
chicken, or pork.
 Bouillabaisse (bwee-ah-bess): A fish stew from the Mediterranean
that includes assorted shellfish and white fish accompanied by
croutons, grated cheese, and rouille, a mayonnaise made with
garlic.
 Brandade (brahn-dahd): Salt cod (morue) soaked in cold water,
shredded, and cooked with garlic, olive oil, milk, and potato. It has
the look and consistency of mashed potatoes but tastes like salted
fish. A green salad makes a good accompaniment.
 Carpaccio (car-pahsh-shyow): Thinly sliced, cured raw beef or
tuna.
 Cassoulet (cass-oo-lay): A rich stew made of white beans, dry
sausage, onion, duck, prosciutto, herbs, carrots, and tomatoes. 
It’s cooked slowly and usually served in a ceramic bowl or pot.
Absolutely delicious, but heavy; don’t plan any serious physical
exertions after eating — digestion will be enough.
 Cervelles (suhr-vel): Pork or sheep brains.
 Cheval (sheh-vahl): Horse meat.
 Choucroute (shoo-kroot): Sauerkraut cooked with juniper berries
and wine, served with an assortment of pork cuts, usually including
brisket, pork shoulder, ham, frankfurters, or spicy sausage. It goes
well with boiled potatoes and is served with mustard.
Part I: Introducing Paris 
26

 Confit de canard (con-fee duh can-ahr): A duck leg cooked and pre-
served in its own fat. The fatty skin is usually salty, but the meat
underneath is tender and juicy. Mashed potatoes make a good side
dish.
 Cuisses des grenouilles (cwees day gren-wee): Frogs’ legs.
 Escargots (es-car-go): Snails.
 Foie (fwah): Liver.
 Gesiers (jeh-zyay): Gizzards; very good in salads.
 Lapin à la moutarde (la-pan ah la moo-tard): Rabbit cooked with
mustard, crème fraîche, and sometimes white wine. The mustard
perks up the rabbit meat, which has a mild flavor.
 Lièvre (lee-yevr): Hare.
 Magret de canard (mah-greh duh can-ahr): The sliced breast of a
fattened duck, sautéed and sometimes served with a green pepper-
corn sauce. The result more closely resembles red meat than poul-
try. As with any meat, specify how you want it cooked.
 Pieds de cochon (pyay duh coh-shon): Pig’s feet.
 Plateau de fruits de mer (plah-toe duh free duh mair): A variety of
raw and cooked seafood served on ice. You usually find two kinds
of oysters — flat, round belon, and larger, crinkly creuse. Both types
are cultivated, not harvested. The oysters are eaten with lemon or
red-wine vinegar and accompanied by thin slices of buttered rye
bread. In addition to various kinds of shrimp, clams, and mussels,
you also see periwinkles (bulots; edible marine snails), which are
eaten with mayonnaise.
 Pot-au-feu (pot-oh-fuh): A hearty dish of boiled vegetables and beef
that sometimes includes the marrow bone. Scrape out the marrow,
spread it on toast, and sprinkle it with salt. Sometimes the broth is
served first, followed by the vegetables and beef. Mustard is the
preferred condiment.
 Ris de veau (ree duh voe): The thymus gland of a calf (a white
meat) sautéed in a butter and cream sauce. It has a delicate, pleas-
ant taste but is high in cholesterol.
 Rognons (ron-yawn): Kidneys.
 Tête de veau (tet duh voe): Calf’s head.
Words to the Wise: The Local Language
Parisians do speak English and yes, are willing to speak it — especially
with visitors who do them the courtesy of trying to speak a few phrases
of French. You often find that you can’t even complete a sentence in
French before you’re answered in English. Don’t be afraid of saying you
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Paris 27

don’t understand French (Je ne comprends pas; juh neh cohm-pren pah);
you will save yourself, and the person with whom you are conversing, a
lot of time, and get help that much faster.
Phrases to remember are the essential Parlez-vous anglais (par-lay voo
ahn-glay; do you speak English?); the common courtesy phrase of
Bonjour madame/monsieur (bohn-joor mad-am, mis-yoo) when you enter
a store or place of business; and au revoir madame/monsieur (oh-vwah)
when you leave. This book, too, has an extensive glossary of words and
phrases (See Appendix B for “A Glossary of French Words and Phrases”)
that anticipate nearly every situation.
Background Check: Books and Movies
Compiled here are lists of books and movies to help prepare you for
your trip.
Books
There are so many books about the experiences of travelers who fell
under the city’s spell, or the doings of a particular French person, or the
efforts of those who try to figure out just what it is that makes France
such a peculiar culture but such a wonderful place to visit. The following
list provides just a sample.
 C’est La Vie: An American Conquers the City of Light, Begins a
New Life, and Becomes — Zut Alors — Almost French by Suzy
Gershman (Viking). Frommer’s Born to Shop author Gershman had
long planned to retire in France with her husband. But when he
died of an unexpected illness, she moved to Paris alone to try to
work through her grief. A deliciously chatty chronicle of her first
year in Paris.
 The Flâneur by Edmund White (Bloomsbury). Edmund White, 
who lived in Paris for 16 years, wanders through the streets and
avenues and along the quays, taking readers into parts of Paris 
virtually unknown to visitors — and to many Parisians.
 French Toast: An American in Paris Celebrates the Maddening
Mysteries of the French by Harriet Welty Rochefort (Thomas
Dunne Books). Part memoir, part guide by an Iowan who picked up
and moved to Paris more than 20 years ago, this book sheds light
on why the French do things the way they do, and how you can,
too, while you’re there.
 A Moveable Feast by Ernest Hemingway is the memoir of this Lost
Generation writer’s life in Paris during the ’20s and ’30s. Beautifully
written, the book is full of anecdotes about life in the city during
the period and of course the expatriate writing community that
thrived.
Part I: Introducing Paris 
28

 Paris to the Moon by Adam Gopnik (Random House). The often
humorous and tender account of the five years New Yorker–writer
Gopnik spent in Paris with his wife and young son.
 The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten
Passion in a Paris Atelier by Thad Carhart (Random House).
Carhart notices an unassuming piano shop while walking his chil-
dren to school one day. He eventually gains entry into a new world
of the piano and its French fans as well as its art and history — 
and rediscovers the forgotten joys of playing the piano.
 Savoir Flair by Polly Platt (Culture Crossings Ltd.) details cultural
do’s and don’ts by an American who has lived in Paris since 1967.
This guide is simply essential!
 Seven Ages of Paris by Alistair Horne (Vintage) is a colorful narra-
tive history of Paris and, due to its designation as the center of the
French world, the history of France, as well. Interesting and inform-
ative, it is a great unintimidating introduction to a city with a whole
lot of history.
 Sixty Million Frenchmen Can’t Be Wrong by Jean-Benoit Nadeau
and Julie Barlow (Sourcebooks). Two Canadian journalists who
move to France on a two-year fellowship deconstruct French ideas
about land, food, privacy, and language.
 A Year in the Merde and Talk to the Snail by Stephen Clarke
(Bloomsbury USA). In the first, Clarke describes how he, an
Englishman, arrives in Paris to set up some English tearooms in
Paris, giving a laugh-out-loud account of the pleasures and perils of
being a Brit in France. In his follow-up, Clarke gives us his hilarious
11 commandments for understanding the French, with a great sec-
tion on the typical tourist experience.
Movies
It’s difficult to cull this down into a small list because there are so many
terrific films about France. Most here take place in Paris, and their shots
of this beautiful city will only increase your anticipation of visiting.
 À Bout de Souffle (Breathless): In this classic by Jean-Luc Godard,
a small-time gangster kills a cop and then flees to Paris to get
enough money together to leave the country with his girlfriend.
Wonderful shots of Paris in the late 1950s.
 Before Sunset: In this sequel to the 1995 film Before Sunrise, the
two main characters, who had met in Vienna and spent a memo-
rable night together, reunite after one gives a reading from his new
book at Shakespeare and Company.
 Gigi: This 1958 Lerner and Loewe musical set in Paris at the turn of
the 20th century follows a young girl as she is groomed into a would-
be courtesan (based on a story by the French author Colette).
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Paris 29

 Jules et Jim: In this François Truffaut classic, two best friends fall
in love with the same woman in 1912 Paris. Breathtaking!
 The Fabulous Destiny of Amélie Poulain: It’s hard to tell who the
star is in this movie about a young woman trying to do good,
actress Audrey Tautou or the city of Paris.
 La Vie en Rose: Marion Cotillard won an Oscar and César in 2007
for best actress portraying Édith Piaf in this biographical film of the
singer’s tumultuous life.
 Paris, je t’aime: This 2006 collaboration of 18 short films, all
named after different Parisian neighborhoods, is a beautiful collec-
tion of humorous, dramatic, and heart-wrenching oeuvres. It gives
some great insight to the diversity of Parisian life while featuring
the architecture and character in the City of Light.
 The Triplets of Belleville: This animated film is about a Tour de
France racer kidnapped by gangsters and the grandmother who
goes in search of him with the help of a musical trio — the Triplets
of Belleville. Though it doesn’t take place in Paris, it’s a terrific
introduction to the country and fun to watch with your kids. (There
isn’t much talking, so not a lot of subtitles to decipher.)
 Zazie Dans le Metro: In Louis Malle’s very funny 1962 film, a young
girl is foisted on her unwilling transvestite uncle, and they have a
series of madcap adventures in Paris.
 Les 400 Coups: Truffaut’s tale of a neglected Parisian teen who
commits petty crimes but gets in trouble for trying to do right is set
in a dingy, seedy version of Paris.

 Choosing the best season to visit
 Checking out a calendar of events
T
he pros and cons of each season are listed here to help you decide
when you can make the most of your visit to Paris. Also compiled is
a calendar of the most memorable events in Paris; you may want to con-
sider planning your trip to coincide with one of the festivals, sporting
events, or celebrations.
Revealing the Secret of the Seasons
Residents and visitors alike find Paris ideal in spring and autumn, when
weather is kind, crowds are reasonably sized, and Parisian life runs at a
steady hum. Winter can be gray and bone-chillingly damp, but there are
plenty of things to do inside: You can fill an entire trip with visits just to
the Louvre, and January has its own joy — two to three weeks of shop-
ping the twice yearly government mandated sales. In summer, you can
bask in daylight that lasts until 10 p.m.

Paris in the springtime
In 2008, spring came early to Paris with some flowers blooming in
February, an unusual occurrence. Spring generally arrives in Paris
around April and brings some beautifully clear, fresh days. The parks

and gardens of Paris — and those at Versailles, Fontainebleau, and Giverny
(see Chapter 14) — burst with colorful, fragrant blooms. Crowds of visi-
tors don’t kick in until July summer vacation (except during the spring
fashion shows in Mar), so lines are relatively short at the top sightseeing
attractions, and airfares have yet to reach their summertime highs.
But keep in mind that April in Paris is not as temperate as Cole Porter
would have you believe. In fact, Paris weather can be very similar to that
in London: It’s fickle. Pack for warm, cold, wet, dry, and every other
eventuality; in other words, bring layers and don’t even think about
coming without an umbrella. Also, nearly every Monday in May is a holi-
day in France — stores and many museums are closed, the métro runs
on a holiday schedule, and other venues are affected.
Paris is a beach
Long and sultry days make visiting Paris in summer ideal — 6 a.m. 
sunrises and 10 p.m. sunsets — so you’re afforded additional hours to
wander and discover. You can find discounts of 30 percent to 50 percent
in most stores during July, one of the two big months for shopping sales
(the other is Jan). Hotel room rates are less expensive in July and
August. Also during August, parking is free in some areas of the city.
But remember that an influx of tourists during the summer means long
lines at museums and other sites. The weather also is capricious: You
may have a week of rain and 55-degree temperatures, followed by days
of cloudless skies and high temperatures, and much of the city is with-
out air-conditioning.
Because most Parisians take their vacations in August, the city is won-
derfully tranquil in some places and devoid of life in others. Although
the entire city doesn’t exactly shut down in August, some shops and
restaurants close for the entire month. The city’s cultural calendar slows
down, too, and you may have to walk an extra block or two to find an
open shop or newsstand. And if you go to Paris in August with thoughts
of practicing your French, think again. French may be the language
you’re least likely to hear.
Fabulous festive fall
Paris bursts into life starting the first week of September, a time typically
known as la rentrée (the return). This season is one of the most exciting
times of the year, when important art exhibitions open along with trendy
new restaurants, shops, and cafes. By the middle of September, airfares
drop from summertime highs. And with daytime temperatures in the 60s
and 70s and nights in the 50s, the weather is pleasant.
Keep in mind, however, that finding a hotel at the last minute in the fall
can be difficult due to the number of business conventions and trade
shows that take place in the city, including the October fashion shows.
Be sure to book ahead.
Part I: Introducing Paris 
32

Transportation strikes of varying intensities traditionally occur during
the fall. Some go virtually unnoticed by the average traveler, but others
can be giant hassles.
Winter wonderland
You can find great airfare deals during the winter; airlines and tour oper-
ators often offer unbeatable prices on flights and package tours. Lines 
at museums and other sights are mercifully short. You can ice skate in
front of the Hôtel de Ville. And, if shopping is your bag, you can save up
to 50 percent during the sales in January.
But remember that although Paris winters may appear mild on paper, in
reality, residents know that they are gray (sometimes the sun doesn’t
shine for weeks), dreary, and bone-chillingly damp (there’s a reason
French women wear scarves!). And look out for those winds that lash up
and down the city’s grand boulevards. Bring a warm, preferably water-
proof, coat and umbrella.
A Paris Calendar
When you arrive, check with the Paris Convention and Visitors Bureau
(% 08-92-68-30-00 [at a charge of .35/55¢ per minute]; www.parisinfo.
com) and buy Pariscope, L’Officiel des Spectacles for dates, places, and
other up-to-date information. Or, if you pass by an English-language
bookstore or bar, pick up a copy of the English-language Paris Free Voice.
For a refresher course in the ways and means of Paris addresses, see the
Introduction.
Below are Paris’s month by month attractions.
January
A big, noisy parade on New Year’s Day makes Paris more Rose Bowl than
City of Light. La Grande Parade de Montmartre is fun and flashy with
majorettes, high school bands, and elaborate floats that traverse the city
streets. The parade begins at 2 p.m. (so you can sleep in) in the place
Pigalle, 18e (the 18th arrondissement, or neighborhood), and ends at the
place Jules-Joffrin, 18e. January 1.
The Fête des Rois is a holiday kids love, the celebration of the Feast of
the Three Kings, and custom dictates the wearing of gold paper crowns
to celebrate. The main object of celebration is a flaky, almond-paste-filled
pie that conceals a ceramic charm (so watch your teeth). According to
custom, whoever finds the charm becomes king or queen for the day, is
entitled to wear the crown, and has free reign, as it were, in his or her
choice of a consort. The pie with the charm is available at all pâtisseries
(dessert shops). January 6.
Chapter 3: Deciding When to Go 33

La Mairie de Paris Vous Invite au Concert features a two-week, two-
people-for-the-price-of-one special admission to a variety of jazz and
classical concerts across the city. Mid-January.
An annual Commemorative Mass for Louis XVI attracts a full turnout of
aristocrats, royalists, and even some far-right types. At the Chapelle
Expiatoire, 29 rue Pasquier, 8e. Sunday closest to January 21.
Residents go all out for the Chinese New Year Festival, which, depend-
ing on the Chinese calendar, falls between January 21 and February 19.
Celebratory events take place in Chinatown (13e). A parade features
dragons, dancers, and fireworks. Plan on grabbing a bite to eat in one of
the many excellent Chinese restaurants in the area.
Twice a year, in January and September, more than 40,000 buyers make
their way to the Ready-to-Wear Fashion Shows in the Salon International
de Prêt-à-Porter (Parc des Expositions, 15e; Métro: Balard or Porte de
Versailles). The exposition hall at the Porte de Versailles hosts shows of
the new clothing lines from some 1,200 designers. Admission for non-
trade visitors is around 23 ($28). Invitation-only fashion shows are also
held at the major design houses. End of January.
February
Foire à la Feraille de Paris is one big upscale flea market. This yearly
antiques and secondhand fair takes place in the Parc Floral de Paris in

March
Professional actors and residents of the neighborhood perform in La

One of the most popular athletic events of the year, the Paris Marathon
has runners sprinting past a variety of the city’s most beautiful monu-
ments. The 42km (26-mile) event attracts enthusiastic crowds. April 5,

and-light shows with fireworks that take place one Saturday in June,
three Saturdays in July, one Saturday in August, and two Saturdays in
September. These events are held at the Château de Versailles, Versailles.
Log on to www.chateauversailles.fr for more information. (See

Late June.
July and August
French independence day, Bastille Day, is July 14, but the festivities
actually begin the night before on July 13, with free bals (dances) open
to everyone at fire stations all over the city. (Some of the best bals are in
the fire stations on the rue du Vieux-Colombier near the place St-Sulpice,
6e; the rue Sévigné, 4e; and the rue Blanche, near place Pigalle, 9e.)
Although the bals are free, drinks cost. On July 14, be sure to get to the
Champs-Elysées waaay before the 10 a.m. start of the Bastille Day mili-
tary parade if you hope to see anything. Later that night a sound-and-
light show with terrific fireworks can be seen at the Trocadéro. Rather
than face the crowds, many people watch the fireworks from the Champs
de Mars across the river, from hotel rooms with views, or even from the
hill on rue Soufflot, in front of the Panthéon. July 13 and 14.
The Paris, Quartier d’Été (Paris, summer neighborhood) celebration
has contemporary music, dance, and film as the bills of fare at outside
venues around the city. The outdoor movies shown on a giant screen at
Parc de la Villette (Métro: Porte de la Villette) are particularly popular.
July 14 to August 15.
If you plan to be in Paris in July, bring your beach clothes! Paris Plage, a
month-long festival, turns a bit of the Right Bank into the Riviera. From
mid-July to mid-August, the city closes off 3.5km (2 miles) of its quays
between the Pont Henri IV and the quai des Tuileries so that people can
enjoy the same activities they would at the beach — all but swimming in
the swift and dangerous Seine (a pool was added between pont Marie
and pont Sully in 2004). There are three “beaches” made from sand,
grass, or wooden planks; palm trees and wooden lounge chairs; snack
bars and cafes; a climbing wall, trampolines, an area to play boules; and
even old-time dance halls known as guinguettes. Concerts are organized
by the electronics store Fnac, and there are dance and comedy perform-
ances as well.
The final day of the three-week-long Tour de France is the third Sunday
of July. The winner is crowned at the Champs-Elysées. If you plan to
attend the celebration, be sure to arrive very early because the crowds
are tremendous. You need a special invitation for a seat in the stands
near place de la Concorde, but you can see the cyclists farther up the
Champs-Elysées and, depending on the route (which changes each
year), elsewhere in the city, too. Check the newspapers the day before
or log on to www.letour.com.
Chapter 3: Deciding When to Go 37

The Fête de l’Assomption celebrates the journey of Mary, Jesus’s
mother, to Heaven after her death. Church services at Notre-Dame are
the most popular and colorful on this important French holiday (many
stores are closed, and transportation runs on a holiday schedule), and
banners are draped over the church’s towers to celebrate the day.
August 15.
September
One of the largest and most prestigious antiques shows in the world, the
Biennale des Antiquaires, opens to the public in even-numbered years in
the Cour Carée du Louvre, the underground exhibition space connected
to the museum. For more information, contact the Paris Convention and
Visitors Bureau. Early September.
Planning your trip to Paris around September 15? Then be sure to visit
the off-limits palaces, churches, and other official buildings that throw
open their doors to the public for two days during Les Journées de
Patrimoine (the days of Patrimony). Long lines can put a damper on
your sightseeing, so plan what you want to see and show up early (with
a good book, just in case). Get a list and a map of all the open buildings
from the Paris Convention and Visitors Bureau. Weekend closest to
September 15.
The annual arts festival, the Festival d’Automne, is recognized through-
out Europe for its innovative programming and the high quality of its
artists and performers. Check the Paris Convention and Visitors Bureau
for more information.
The second of two annual Ready-to-Wear Fashion Shows takes place in
September (see the previous entry under “January”).
This street party cum parade gets bigger every year, and at press time,
the mid-September Paris Techno Parade was expecting 300,000 viewers
to turn out to celebrate musical freedom with a conscience. The parade
teamed up with an NGO to fight hunger in 2006 and began eco-friendly
initiatives in 2007.
October
More than a half million people visit museums, libraries, swimming
pools, churches, and bars and restaurants during Nuit Blanche. Open
very late or all night for one night, parts of the city become a nighttime
art installation. Early October.
The wine might not taste that great, but it’s all about the celebration of
the harvest at Montmartre’s one remaining vineyard, Clos Montmartre.
Watch as the wine is auctioned off at high prices to benefit local chari-
ties during the Fêtes des Vendanges à Montmartre here. Locals dress in
period costumes, and the streets come alive with music. First or second
Saturday of October.

As interesting for browsing as for buying is the FIAC (Foire Internationale
d’Art Contemporain), one of the largest contemporary art fairs in the
world. With stands from more than 150 galleries, half of them foreign,
the fair takes place at the Parc des Expositions, Porte de Versailles, 15e
(Métro: Balard or Porte de Versailles). Admission is 14 ($16). For more
information, call % 08-92-69-26-94. Mid- to late October.
November
Many of the city’s major museums celebrate the art of photography
during Mois de la Photo (the month of the photo) with shows. Check
listings in the weekly guide Pariscope. All month.
The French commemorate those who died fighting in both World Wars
with a wreath-laying ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe, and veterans sell
poppy corsages in memory of Armistice Day. November 11.
November in Paris can be awfully gray and chilly, but you’ll warm up
quickly just after midnight on the third Thursday (technically Fri) of
November for the annual celebration of the public release of Beaujolais
Nouveau — a lightweight red wine that is bottled after the fall harvest
and meant for immediate consumption as it has a short shelf life. (You
can find it in the States as well, right around Thanksgiving.) Wine bars
and cafes are packed just for the event.
The annual Lancement des Illuminations des Champs-Elysées (lighting
of the avenue’s Christmas lights) makes for a festive evening, with jazz
concerts and an international star to push the button that lights up the
avenue. For more information, call the Paris Convention and Visitors
Bureau. Late November.
December
Each year a different foreign city installs a life-size Christmas manger
scene (La Crèche sur le Parvis) in the plaza in front of the Hôtel de Ville
(City Hall). The crèche is open daily from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. December 1
to January 3.

Planning Your 
Trip to Paris

In this part . . . 
L
ook no further than these chapters to help you plan
everything for your trip — from where to stay and how
much to spend on traveling successfully with children to
what to do if your wallet has been stolen. Chapter 4 tells you
what to expect in each price category so you can plan a work-
able budget. Chapter 5 gets you to Paris, whether it be by
plane, train, automobile, or hovercraft and discusses the pros
and cons of package tours. Chapter 6 takes into account spe-
cial interests and gives advice to families, seniors, disabled
persons, and gay men and lesbians. And in Chapter 7, you get
some advice about those last-minute details that can frustrate
even the most frequent ﬂier. 

Chapter 4
Managing Your Money
In This Chapter
 Developing a workable budget
 Cutting costs — but not the fun
 Handling your money
 Dealing with a lost or stolen wallet
A
good way to budget your trip to Paris is to mentally walk through
the journey, from the moment you leave to the minute you get back
home, and don’t forget to figure in your transportation to and from the
airport. Then add in the flight cost (see Chapter 5 on how to fly to Paris
for less), the price of getting from the Charles-de-Gaulle or Orly airports
to your hotel, your hotel rate per day, meals, public transportation costs,
admission prices to museums and the theater, and other entertainment
expenses. Add another 25 percent to the total for good measure. You
never know when you might stumble across a cute boutique or a bro-
cante (a flea market with one-of-a-kind items).
Planning Your Budget
Cities rarely are cheap or expensive across the board; Paris tends to be
pricey for dining but more reasonable for accommodations, so booking a
good hotel shouldn’t be a problem. The following list offers guidelines
for what you’re likely to spend while in Paris. The rate of exchange at
press time was 1 = $1.60.
 Lodging: Before you start shelling out money for lodging, think
about how much time you’ll actually spend in your room. For
between 80 and 100 ($128–$160), you can rent a clean, function-
ally furnished hotel room with a private bathroom and cable TV.
This type of budget room is comfortable, has the basic furnishings
and décor; the drawbacks are thin yet serviceable towels and thin
bars of packaged soap (Hint: You can buy better soaps in the gro-
cery store or at chain store Monoprix for just a few euros).
If you’re feeling extravagant and willing to spend 200 ($320) or
more, luxury, upper-tier hotels offer more services, such as room
service, air-conditioning, and toiletries.

 Transportation: The Paris métro, the model for subways around
the world since its inauguration in 1900, is one of the best transit
systems around in terms of price and efficiency. Getting across town
in less than a half-hour is no problem, and the cost is lower when
you purchase one of several available discount tickets or a carnet
(booklet) of ten tickets. (See Chapter 8 for options and prices.)
If you thrive on labyrinthine one-way streets, a dearth of parking
spaces, hellish traffic, and driving among what are statistically the
worst drivers in Europe, then renting a car in Paris is for you, but I
strongly discourage it! If you want to rent a car to see other parts of
France or make a day trip outside of Paris, rent on your way out of
the city. (See Chapter 7 for addresses and phone numbers of car
rental agencies in Paris.)
 Restaurants: The French consider dining out one of the finer joys in
life, and they pay for it. You can expect to do the same. An average
Parisian dining experience — a three-course dinner in a popular
upscale restaurant — runs about 60 to 80 ($72–$96) per person.
You can find establishments serving satisfying two-course meals for
as little as 14 ($22) and ethnic eateries and sandwich shops that
help you save even more money. Dining reasonably in Paris isn’t
impossible when you know where to look. Chapter 10 helps you
discover just that.
 Attractions: Entry fees to museums and other sights can add up
quickly; find money-saving advice in Chapter 11, after which making a
list of must-dos will give you a feel for how much money to set aside.
 Shopping: Paris is one of the world’s best places to shop. Store
owners arrange their wares in such enticing window displays (with
prices) that they’ll have you faites du leche-vitrines (licking the win-
dows) in no time. You can find some great deals during the semian-
nual sales in January and July, but remember that a steep 19.6
percent tax (value-added tax, abbreviated VAT or TVA) is added to
most goods. If you live outside the European Union, you’re usually
entitled to get back part of the tax, if you meet certain require-
ments. See Chapter 12 for more information.
 Nightlife: Don’t forgo the spectacles at the Lido or Moulin Rouge if
you’ve always wanted to see them — just know beforehand that
you’ll be charged a small fortune for entry and alcoholic beverages.
Plan on seeing the show without dinner, and exit with a wallet that
isn’t quite as light as it otherwise would be. Budget big, too, espe-
cially when you plan to visit clubs and other nightspots; nightclubs
usually have covers (though the first drink is generally included)
and bars are not cheap. You can save money for ballet, opera, and
plays at the national theaters by buying half-price or same-day tick-
ets. See Chapter 15 and 16 for more information.
Table 4-1 gives you approximate prices for some common expenses,
listed in euro, U.S. dollars, and British pounds.

Cutting Costs
One of the primary ways to save money at the outset is by booking a
package tour. For many destinations, you can book airfare, hotel, ground
transportation, and even some sightseeing just by making one call to a
travel agent or searching the Internet, for a lot less than if you tried to put
the trip together yourself. (See Chapter 5 for specific companies to call.)
I can’t repeat it enough: Always ask for discount rates. Membership in
AAA, frequent-flyer plans, trade unions, AARP, or other groups may qual-
ify you for savings on car rentals, plane tickets, hotel rooms, even meals.
Ask about everything; you may be pleasantly surprised.
The following list offers additional cost-cutting strategies for various
expenses.
 Food and drink
• Make lunch your main meal. Many restaurants offer great
deals on a fixed-price (prix fixe) lunch or offer a daily formule
(day’s special) of appetizer, main course, and dessert that can
often be cheaper than ordering off the regular menu. After two
or three courses at midday, you won’t want a big dinner.
• Try the ethnic neighborhoods. You can get terrific Chinese
and Vietnamese foods in the 13th arrondissement between
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 45

the place d’Italie and the Porte de Choisy; and the 10e, 
18e, and 20e have restaurants with North African, Turkish,
Vietnamese, and Thai menus. Couscous is on the menu at
many restaurants and usually is an inexpensive offering, 
and falafel stands abound in the Marais.
• Keep in mind that the plat du jour (daily entree special) usu-
ally is the cheapest main dish at a budget restaurant.
• Remember that wine is cheaper than soda. Some mineral
waters, likewise, are less expensive than others. Ask for tap
water (une carafe d’eau, oon kar-ahf doh), which is free.
• If you’re just having drinks or coffee, do it standing at the bar.
You pay twice as much when you’re seated at a table.
• Know the tipping rules. Most restaurants include the gratuity
in the bill. Look for service compris on your bill, which means
15 percent has been added already. It is customary to leave
extra; 5 percent if the service was good.
 Lodging
• Book your hotel room early. Rooms at the best prices fill up
quickly, especially in the fall.
• Negotiate the room price, especially in the low season. It
never hurts to ask for discounts, either: Ask for a discount if
you’re a student or older than 60; ask for a discount when
you’re staying three days or more.
• Check the Web for online specials. Most Parisian hotels have
their own Web sites and offer promotions, especially for stays
of three days or longer.
• Reserve a room with a kitchen. It may not seem like much of a
vacation if you cook your own meals and wash your own
dishes, but you can save a lot of money by not eating in
restaurants three times a day. Even if you make only break-
fast and pack an occasional bag lunch, you can save a little
extra cash for souvenirs and gifts for your family and friends
back home. Shopping the open-air markets and grocery
stores offers a fun peek into the French way of life.
• Try renting an apartment instead of staying in a hotel.
Renting a Paris apartment can be surprisingly cheap, and
apartment rental services flourish online. You save money by
eating more meals in the apartment, and you experience a
little of what it’s like to live like a resident of Paris. (See
Chapter 9 for specific rental agencies.)
• Consider a housing swap. If you have a house in a desirable
locale for French tourists (big cities or near national parks)
you may just be able to arrange a mutually beneficial 
arrangement — for free. (See Chapter 9 for details.)
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Paris 
46

 Shopping and entertainment
• For discounts on fashion, try the rue St-Placide in the 6e
arrondissement. You find plenty of overstock and dégriffe
(clothes with labels removed) items on this street near Le
Bon Marché department store (where clothes are decidedly
not cheap). Stylish inexpensive clothing also can be found at
Monoprix stores located all over the city.
• If you plan to visit two or three museums a day for multiple
days, buy the Paris Museum Pass. It’s offered in three versions:
a two-consecutive-day pass (30/$48), a four-consecutive-day
pass (45/$72), and a six-consecutive-day pass (60/$96). It’s a
great deal if you plan to visit a lot of museums. See Chapter 11
for more information.
• Take advantage of the reduced admission fees at museums.
The reduced prices usually apply after 3 p.m. (at the Louvre,
it’s after 6 p.m.) and all day Sunday. Remember that on the
first Sunday of every month, admission to national museums
is free.
• Buy half-price theater and other performance tickets. You 
can find same-day half-price tickets at one of the kiosks by
the Madeleine or at the Gare Montparnasse. The kiosks are
little huts with panels indicating whether the performance 
is sold out (symbolized by a little red man) or if tickets are
still available (a little green man). (See Chapter 15 for more
information.)
• Avoid going to clubs on weekends. Some clubs are cheaper
than others, and some are cheaper during the week. Many
clubs allow women in free until a certain time (usually 11 p.m.).
 Transportation
• Fly during the week rather than on weekends. Many airlines
charge slightly less if you fly on weekdays.
• Travel during the off season (also called the low season), the
period from approximately October to April.
• Pack light so that you can take the cheapest way into the city
from the airport and won’t have to worry about lugging
around heavy bags. You can save around 38 ($61) by taking
a train or bus instead of a cab from Roissy-Charles-de-Gaulle
Airport and about 33 ($53) from Orly.
• While in Paris, use the bus or métro or walk.
• Buy a carnet of ten métro tickets at a time. A single ticket
costs 1.50 ($1.70), but if you plan on staying a few days, a
carnet (pack of ten) costs only 11 ($13). Better yet, if you
know you’re going to be in Paris one to two days, buy a Paris
Visite pass, which is good for unlimited subway and bus
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 47

travel. At 8.50 ($14) for one day or 14 ($22) for two days
(kids 4–11 pay half price; kids under four ride free), it’s a
good deal. If you’ll be in Paris longer than three days, your
best bet is the Carte Orange. It costs 16 ($26) for zones 
1 and 2 (Paris and some of the suburbs) and 22 ($35) for
zones 1 to 3 (Paris and suburbs including Disneyland). You’ll
need to provide a passport-size photo (or snap one at photo
booths in major train and métro stations). (See Chapter 8 for
more details.)
Handling Money
The euro, the single European currency for much of the European Union,
became the official currency of France and 11 other participating coun-
tries on January 1, 1999, but it didn’t go into general circulation until
January 1, 2002. The old currency, the French franc, disappeared into
history on March 1, 2002. Exchange rates of participating countries are
locked into a common currency fluctuated against the dollar.
Converting to euro
In converting prices to U.S. dollars, the conversion rate used here is 
1 = $1.60. For up-to-the-minute exchange rates between the euro and
the dollar, check the currency converter Web site at www.xe.com/ucc.
At this writing the U.S. dollar rate to the £ equals approximately US$2.
These were the rates of exchange used to calculate the values in 
Table 4-1.
You can withdraw euro at any ATM in Paris, and ATMs are everywhere
and open 24 hours. Find them outside nearly every bank, in major
department stores, airports, and train stations. MasterCard and/or Cirrus
cards can be used at any ATM that displays the MasterCard and/or Cirrus
marks. Visa and/or PLUS can also be used at ATMs displaying Visa and
PLUS signs.
Keep in mind you won’t be able to check your balance or transfer funds,
so keep track of your withdrawals while you travel.
Remember that every time you withdraw cash from an ATM, your bank
hits you with a fee, sometimes as much as $5. Check how much your
bank charges before leaving home. On top of this fee, the bank from
which you withdraw cash may also include its own fee. Thus, taking out
larger amounts of money every two to three days makes more sense
than more frequent withdrawals of smaller denominations. Likewise,
remember that your bank places a limit on the amount of money you can
take out per day, usually between 300 and 500 ($500–$1,000).
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Paris 
48

If you need to withdraw more than your bank’s limit, visit any Parisian
bank where a teller can swipe your ATM card for the amount you need,
as long as the amount doesn’t surpass the Parisian bank’s own limit.
Approach the bank’s information desk first to explain in English what
you need done.
Pulling out your plastic: Using credit cards
MasterCard and Visa are accepted at nearly any establishment that
takes credit cards in Paris. But American Express and Diners Club aren’t
widely accepted at small restaurants, shops, or budget hotels in Paris or
the rest of the country.
Remember that you pay interest on cash advances on your credit card
from the moment you receive the cash. And, many credit card compa-
nies now tack on additional fees for foreign currency transactions —
sometimes up to 4 percent, on top of the 1 percent service charge that
MasterCard and Visa charge. If you don’t know how much your credit
card charges for currency conversion, contact a company representative.
Going the way of the dinosaur: The extinction 
of traveler’s checks
These days, there’s no need to waste valuable time standing in long lines
at the American Express office or in search of bureaux de change to cash
traveler’s checks. Simply use your ATM card to withdraw the money you
need. Relatively few banks in Paris exchange currency or cash traveler’s
checks, preferring to send visitors to bureaux de change in touristy areas
that charge a hefty fee.
If you want the safety of the traveler’s check without the hassle, check
out American Express’s Traveler’s Cheque Card. It’s a reuseable, reload-
able card that is not linked to your bank account. You can even add
more funds when you’re out of the country by calling American Express
collect at % 801-945-9450. To learn more, consult the Web site at
www.americanexpress.com.
You can cash traveler’s checks at American Express, 11 rue Scribe, 9e,
% 01-47-77-70-00 (Métro: Auber or Opéra); Travelex, 194 rue de Rivoli,
1er, % 01-42-60-37-61 (Métro: Tuileries); or Global Change, 240 rue de
Rivoli, 1er, % 01-42-36-14-82.
Dealing with a Lost or Stolen Wallet
Every credit card company has an emergency international number that
you can call if your wallet or purse is stolen. In the unlikely event that
this happens, be sure to block charges against your credit card account
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 49

immediately. Your credit card company may be able to wire you a cash
advance off your credit card immediately, and in many places, can deliver
an emergency credit card in a day or two. Call % 0-800-90-11-79 if you’ve
lost or had your Visa card stolen. American Express card and traveler’s
check holders in France can call collect % 336-393-1111 for money and
lost card emergencies. For MasterCard, call % 0800-90-13-87.
If your traveler’s checks are lost or stolen, you need to be able to report
exactly which checks are gone in order to get them replaced. The check
issuer can tell you where to pick up the new checks.
Here’s what to do if your pocket has been picked: First, make a police
report as soon as possible. There are three or four police stations (com-
missariats) in each arrondissement (the train stations also have small
police stations). Go to the station closest to where the crime took place.
If you were robbed in the subway, however, you can go to any police sta-
tion. You will receive a Récépissé de Déclaration de Perte ou de Vol
(receipt for declaration of loss or theft). If you have lost your passport,
identification documents, and/or valuables, you are given separate
receipts — one for your papers (pièces d’identité) and one for your valu-
ables. The police receipts are sometimes necessary in applying for the
replacement of airline tickets, INTERAIL passes (Europass and Eurail),
passports, and traveler’s checks or for supporting insurance claims.
The report must be made in person and most police stations have
English-speaking personnel. Call the U.S. Embassy (% 01-43-12-22-22)
for assistance in interpreting if you have difficulty being understood.
Though it’s unlikely the police will recover your lost or stolen items,
contact the police and file a police report anyway — you may need it for
credit card or insurance purposes later.
Finally, you can visit the lost and found office, run by the French police,
to verify whether your belongings were returned: Centre des Objets
trouvés de la Prefecture de Police de Paris, 36 rue des Morillons, 75015
(% 08-21-00-25-25 [.10/20¢ per minute]; Métro: Convention), open
Monday to Thursday 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., and Friday 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.

T
hough the Internet has drastically changed travel planning, you still
need to decide what kind of travel best suits you. This chapter will
make you an expert in no time and well able to get yourself to Paris
simply and easily.
Flying to Paris
Though Paris has two major airports: Charles de Gaulle and Orly, most
non-European visitors will probably land at the larger, busier, and more
modern Charles de Gaulle. Known as CDG, and sometimes called Roissy-
Charles de Gaulle, it’s located 23km (15 miles) northeast of downtown
Paris. Orly Airport is located 14km (81⁄2 miles) south of the city. Web sites
and phone numbers for the major airlines serving Paris are in the list
that follows. These sites offer schedules, flight bookings, and package
tours. Most have Web pages where you can sign up for e-mail alerts that
list weekend deals and other late-breaking bargains.

Getting the best deal on your airfare
Though every airline offers virtually the same product, prices can vary
by hundreds of dollars. Competition among the major U.S. airlines is
unlike that of any other industry.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Paris 
52

Business travelers who need the flexibility to buy their tickets at the last
minute and change their itineraries at a moment’s notice — and who
want to get home before the weekend — pay the premium rate, known
as the full fare. If you’re lucky enough to fly to Paris this way, more power 
to you. It was certainly not cheap! But if you can book your ticket far in
advance, stay over Saturday night, and are willing to travel midweek
(Tues–Thurs), you can qualify for the least expensive price — usually a
fraction of the full fare. On most flights, even the shortest hops within
the United States, the full fare is close to $1,000 or more, but a 7- or 14-
day advance purchase ticket may cost a good bit less. Obviously, plan-
ning ahead pays.
The airlines also periodically hold sales, in which they lower the prices
on their most popular routes. These fares have advance purchase
requirements and date-of-travel restrictions and may be nonrefundable,
but you can’t beat the prices. As you plan your vacation, keep your eyes
open for these sales, which tend to take place in seasons of low travel
volume — November 1 to December 1 and January to April. You almost
never see a sale around the peak summer vacation months of July and
August, or around Thanksgiving or Christmas, when many people fly,
regardless of the fare they have to pay.
Consolidators, also known as bucket shops, negotiate bulk quantities of
airline tickets and sell them at a discount. They are great sources for
international tickets, although they usually can’t beat the Internet on
fares within North America. Start by looking in Sunday newspaper travel
sections; their ads are usually formatted to look like classified ads. U.S.
travelers should focus on the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, and
Miami Herald.
Bucket-shop tickets are usually nonrefundable or rigged with stiff cancel-
lation penalties, often as high as 50 percent to 75 percent of the ticket
price, and some put you on charter airlines with questionable safety
records (I know one person who flew a rickety charter to Paris through a
thunderstorm and swears he will never fly charter again).
Several reliable consolidators are worldwide and available on the Web.
STA Travel (% 800-781-4040; www.statravel.com), the world’s leader
in student travel, offers good fares for travelers no matter your age.
ELTExpress (% 201-541-3826 for air travel originating in the U.S. and
Canada; www.flights.com) started in Europe and has excellent fares
worldwide, particularly to Europe. LowestFare.com (% 800-FLY-CHEAP;
www.lowestfare.com) is owned by priceline.com. Montreal-based Air
Tickets Direct (% 888-858-8884; www.airticketsdirect.com) has
been operating since 1991.
Booking your ticket online
The big three online travel agencies, Expedia (www.expedia.com),
Travelocity (www.travelocity.com), and Orbitz (www.orbitz.com),
sell most of the air tickets bought on the Internet. (Canadian travelers
Chapter 5: Getting to Paris 53

should try www.expedia.ca and www.travelocity.ca; U.K. residents
can go for expedia.co.uk and opodo.co.uk.) Each has different busi-
ness deals with the airlines and may offer different fares on the same
flights, so shopping around is wise. Expedia, Orbitz, and Travelocity will
also send you an e-mail notification when a cheap fare becomes avail-
able to your favorite destination.
Of the smaller travel agency Web sites, SideStep (www.sidestep.com)
recently merged with kayak.com to search more than 140 sites at once.
It’s a browser add-on that in reality beats competitors’ fares about as
often as other sites do.
Great last-minute deals are available through free weekly e-mail services
provided directly by the airlines. Most of these deals are announced on
Tuesday or Wednesday and must be purchased online. Most are only
valid for travel that weekend, but some (such as Southwest’s) can be
booked weeks or months in advance. Sign up for weekly e-mail alerts at
airline Web sites or check megasites that compile comprehensive lists of
last-minute specials, such as Smarter Travel (www.smartertravel.
com). For last-minute trips, www.lastminute.com often has better
deals than the major-label sites.
If you’re willing to give up some control over your flight details, use
Priceline’s (www.priceline.com) opaque fare service. I say opaque
because it offers rock-bottom prices in exchange for travel on a mystery
airline at a mysterious time of day, often with a mysterious change of
planes en route, sometimes more than one change of planes. The 
mystery airlines are all major, well-known carriers, but your chances 
of getting a 6 a.m. or 11 p.m. flight are pretty high. Priceline also has
nonopaque service; you can pick exact flights, times, and airlines from a
list of offers.
Great last-minute deals are also available directly from the airlines them-
selves through a free e-mail service called E-savers. Each week, the air-
line sends you a list of discounted flights, usually leaving the upcoming
Friday or Saturday and returning the following Monday or Tuesday.
Airline sites also offer schedules, flight booking, and information on late-
breaking bargains.
Arriving by Other Means
If you’re arriving in Paris by train from northern Germany, Belgium, or
London, you disembark in the Gare du Nord. Trains from Normandy
come into the Gare St-Lazare, in Northwest Paris near Galeries Lafayette
and Opéra Garnier. Trains from western France (Brittany, Chartres,
Versailles, Bordeaux) head to the Gare de Montparnasse in the 14e;
those from the southwest (the Loire Valley, Pyrénées, Spain) arrive at
the Gare d’Austerlitz near the Jardin des Plantes, in the 13th arrondisse-
ment. Those from the south and southeast (the Riviera, Lyon, Italy,
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Paris 
54

Geneva) pull in at the Gare de Lyon. Trains coming from Alsace and
eastern France, Luxembourg, southern Germany, and Zurich arrive at
the Gare de l’Est. All train stations connect to métro stations with the
same name. All Paris train stations are located within the first 15
arrondissements, and are easily accessible.
Buses connect Paris to most major European cities and the most well-
known of the companies are Eurolines. There are no American offices,
so you must make bus transportation arrangements after arriving in
Europe. In Great Britain, contact Eurolines (% 08-705-14-32-19). In Paris,
contact Eurolines (at their Latin Quarter agency at 55 rue St. Jacques, 
5e; % 43-54-11-99). International buses pull into the Gare Routière
Internationale (International Bus Terminal) in the suburb of Bagnolet,
just across the périphérique (ring road) from the Galliéni Métro station.
To get into Paris proper, take Line 3 and change buses according to your
final destination.
If you are arriving in Paris from the U.K., about a dozen companies run
hydrofoil, ferry, and hovercraft across the English Channel, or La
Manche (pronounced la mahnsh; “the sleeve”), as the French say.
Services operate daily and most carry cars. Hovercraft and hydrofoils
make the trip across the Channel in about 40 minutes; the shortest ferry
route between Dover and Calais is about one and a half hours. The major
routes are between Dover and Calais and Folkestone and Boulogne
(about 12 trips a day). Depending on weather conditions, prices and
timetables can vary. This is not the best way to get to Paris from the
U.K.; the entire trip from London to Dover by train, then from Dover to
Calais by ferry, and Calais to Paris by train takes about 11 hours. You
can check schedules and reserve space on ferries on Ferrybooker.com
(www.ferrybooker.com). Special fares at press time included Dover to
Calais for 70 ($112) per car with up to five passengers.
It’s important to make reservations because ferries are crowded.
The Channel Tunnel (Chunnel) opened in 1994, and the popularity of its
Eurostar train service has had the happy effect of driving down prices
on all cross-channel transport. This remarkable engineering feat means
that if you hop aboard Le Shuttle in Britain, you can be eating a meal in
France two to four hours later. You can purchase tickets in advance or at
the station. Eurostar tickets start around 63 ($100) one way off season if 
you book seven days in advance. Prices rise in April and in June. Eurostar 
transports passengers only (no vehicles) between London or Ashford in
Kent and Paris, Brussels, Lille, and beyond. For more information on
Eurostar, including online booking, go to www.eurostar.com. For spe-
cial packages information in the U.S., visit RailEurope (www.raileurope.
com) or the TravelPro Network (www.travelpro.net).
A separate company known as Eurotunnel (% 08-705-35-35-35 in the
U.K.; www.eurotunnel.com) can transport passengers with their cars
between Folkestone in the United Kingdom and Calais in France. Car
Chapter 5: Getting to Paris 55

prices start at £ 22 ($44) for a round-trip day trip and can rise to £199
($399) for a round-trip journey longer than five days. One-way prices
start at £49 ($98).
Joining an Escorted Tour
On escorted tours, the tour company takes care of all the details, and
tells you what to expect at each leg of your journey. You know your
costs up front, and you don’t get many surprises. Escorted tours can
take you to the maximum number of sights in the minimum amount of
time with the least amount of hassle.
It’s the least independent way to travel, but some travelers find escorted
tours liberating — no hassles with public transportation, no deciphering
maps, and the comfort of knowing what you’re getting. Others fervently
despise escorted group tours, because they feel as if they’re being
herded from one sight to the next, missing the element of surprise and
individuality that independent travel affords.
If you decide to go with an escorted tour, I strongly recommend purchas-
ing travel insurance, especially if the tour operator requires payment up
front. But don’t buy insurance from the tour operator! If the tour opera-
tor doesn’t fulfill its obligation to provide you with the vacation you paid
for, there’s no reason to think that it’ll fulfill the insurance obligations
either. Get travel insurance through an independent agency. (For more
about the ins and outs of travel insurance, see Chapter 7.)
When choosing an escorted tour, along with finding out whether you
have to put down a deposit and when final payment is due, ask a few
simple questions before you buy.
 What is the cancellation policy? Can they cancel the trip if they
don’t get enough people? How late can you cancel if you are unable
to go? Do you get a refund if you cancel? If they cancel?
 How jam-packed is the schedule? Does the tour schedule try to fit
25 hours into a 24-hour day, or does it give you ample time to relax
by the pool or shop? If getting up at 7 a.m. every day and not
returning to your hotel until 6 or 7 p.m. at night sounds like a grind,
certain escorted tours may not be for you.
 How large is the group? The smaller the group, the less time you
spend waiting for people to get on and off the bus. Tour operators
may be evasive about this, because they may not know the exact
size of the group until everybody has made reservations, but they
should be able to give you a rough estimate.
 Is there a minimum group size? Some tours have a minimum
group size, and may cancel the tour if they don’t book enough
people. If a quota exists, find out what it is and how close they are
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Paris 
56

to reaching it. Again, tour operators may be evasive in their answers, 
but the information may help you select a tour that’s sure to
happen.
 What exactly is included? Don’t assume anything. You may have to
pay to get yourself to and from the airport. A box lunch may be
included in an excursion but drinks may be extra. Beer may be
included but not wine. Find out how much flexibility you have: Can
you opt out of certain activities, or does the bus leave once a day,
with no exceptions? Are all your meals planned in advance? Can
you choose your entree at dinner, or does everybody get the same
chicken cutlet?
Depending on your recreational passions, I recommend one of the fol-
lowing tour companies.
 The French Experience (% 800-283-7262; www.frenchexperience.
com) has been around since 1983 and offers several fly/drive pro-
grams through different regions of France (the quoted price includes
airfare and a rental car). You can specify the type and price level of
hotels you want. The agency arranges the car rental in advance,
and the rest is up to you.
 Perhaps the most instantly recognizable tour operator in the world,
American Express Vacations (% 800-335-3342; www.american
expressvacations.com) has more comprehensive offerings than
those of other companies and includes package tours and inde-
pendent stays.
Choosing a Package Tour
For lots of destinations, package tours can be a smart way to go. In many
cases, a package tour that includes airfare, hotel, and transportation to
and from the airport costs less than the hotel alone on a tour you book
yourself. That’s because packages are sold in bulk to tour operators who
then resell them to the public. It’s a bit like buying your vacation at a
Costco or Sam’s Club — except the tour operator is the one who buys
the 1,000-count box of garbage bags and resells them ten at a time.
Package tours can vary as much as those garbage bags, too. Some offer
a better class of hotels than others; others provide the same hotels for
lower prices, others exclude children. Some book flights on scheduled
airlines; others sell charters. In some packages, your choice of accom-
modations and travel days may be limited. Some let you choose between
escorted vacations and independent vacations; others allow you to add
on just a few excursions or escorted day trips (also at discounted
prices) without booking an entirely escorted tour.
To find package tours, check out the travel section of your local Sunday
newspaper or the ads in the back of national travel magazines such as
Chapter 5: Getting to Paris 57

Travel + Leisure, National Geographic Traveler, and Condé Nast Traveler.
Air France Holidays (% 800-2-FRANCE; www.airfranceholidays.
com) has France-specific package tours; their six-night Paris Affair 
special starts at $1,149 and includes air and hotel fare, breakfast, a 
Seine River cruise, and a performance of the Paradis Latin cabaret.
Liberty Travel (call % 888-271-1584 to find the store nearest you; www.
libertytravel.com) is one of the biggest packagers in the Northeast,
and usually boasts a full-page ad in Sunday papers.
Another good source of package deals is the airlines themselves. Most
major airlines offer air/land packages, including American Airlines
Vacations (% 800-321-2121; www.aavacations.com), Delta Vacations
(% 800-654-6559; www.deltavacations.com), Continental Airlines
Vacations (% 800-301-3800; www.covacations.com), and United
Vacations (% 888-854-3899; www.unitedvacations.com). Several big
online travel agencies — Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz, and Lastminute.
com — also do a brisk business in packages. If you’re unsure about the
pedigree of a smaller packager, check with the Better Business Bureau 
in the city where the company is based, or go online at www.bbb.org. If
a packager won’t tell you where it’s based, don’t fly with them.

I
t seems unimaginable that there once was a time when people
dressed up for a trip through the air and walked onto a plane unhin-
dered (pleasant flight attendants brought free and copious drinks and
snacks, though rampant cigarette smoke made breathing a challenge).
These days, no one finds traveling a piece of cake, but for some people it
poses more challenges. If you’re bringing your family to Paris, or have a
disability and are wondering how to pilot yourself down cobblestone
streets and winding métro corridors, if you’re a senior citizen, or you
want to see the gay side of Paris, this is the chapter for you.
Taking the Family Along
Parks and playgrounds are plentiful in Paris, as are kid-specific sights
and museums, interesting boat rides, and bike tours and the French wel-
come children, making Paris one of the best places to travel with kids in
the world. In addition, you’re less than an hour away from Disneyland
Paris in the suburb of Marne la Valée. Paris is just as safe as, if not safer
than, most big American cities. Though taking your children thousands
of miles away may seem at times like an insurmountable challenge, it
can be immensely rewarding, giving you new ways of seeing the world
through smaller pairs of eyes.
Look for good family-oriented vacation advice on the Internet from 
sites like the Family Travel Forum (www.familytravelforum.com), 
a comprehensive site with customized trip planning and discussion
boards; the award winning Family Travel Network (www.familytravel
network.com), which offers travel features, deals, and tips; Traveling

Internationally with Your Kids (www.travelwithyourkids.com),
started by parents whose daughters were born abroad and is a clearing-
house for information on traveling (and even moving abroad) with your
children from those who have been there; and FamilyTravelFiles.com
(www.thefamilytravelfiles.com), which provides an online maga-
zine and a directory of off-the-beaten-path tours and tour operators for
families.
If you plan your trip well in advance, your kids may get a kick out of
learning the language from one of the many French-language instruc-
tional videotapes on the market.
Such books as Ludwig Bemelmans’s Madeline series, Albert Lamorisse’s
The Red Balloon, and Kay Thompson’s Eloise in Paris are great for kids
under eight years of age. Older teens may appreciate Ernest Hemingway’s
A Moveable Feast (Scribner paperback reissue), Victor Hugo’s Les Misér-
ables, Mark Twain’s Innocents Abroad, and Rose Tremain’s The Way I
Found Her (Washington Square Press paperback reprint). All will proba-
bly like the popular French comic book series The Adventures of Asterix,
by René Goscinny and Albert Uderzo. Translated into English and 
available at bookstores, there’s also an English-language site: www.
gb.asterix.com.
Children younger than 18 are admitted free to France’s national muse-
ums (although not necessarily to Paris’s city museums), and some
attractions offer a lower rate for families of four or more. When purchas-
ing tickets, ask if there is a family rate (carte famille nombreux, pro-
nounced kart fam-ee nohm-brooz).
The following bargains will require some skill in the French language. If
you don’t understand it, you may want to recruit someone who does
because these are terrific bargains. Children younger than 12 traveling
by rail through France, can use the Carte Enfant Plus, a children’s rail
pass. It’s available at any SNCF (French National Railroads) station or, for
non-Americans, online at www.sncf-voyages.com (if you scroll all the
way to the bottom of the home page, you will see a tiny British flag; click
on this for English). Unfortunately, SNCF does not sell directly to North
Americans who have to purchase these cards at a French train station.
The pass offers up to a 50 percent discount for the child and one to four
adult travel companions on non-TGV (Train Grand Vitesse, France’s
high-speed train) mainline trains in off-peak periods, and 25 percent off
on TGV trains (except overnight trains) and mainline trains during peak
travel times. The pass costs 78 ($125), and you can reserve it online
right before you leave, and pick it up at any Paris train station within the
time limit (usually two days). Similarly, a discount travel card is avail-
able for those ages 12 to 25 called Carte 12-25. For 49 ($79), a card-
holder is entitled to up to 60 percent discounts on all TGV and non-TGV
rail services and couchette (sleeping car) berths. A guaranteed 25 per-
cent reduction is available on all TGV rail services and couchette berths
on non-TGV mainline services at all times where no seats are available at
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Paris 
60

the 50 percent reduction rate. A passport photo must be presented
when applying for these cards. Note: To find out where to buy or pick up
these passes in any of Paris’s major train stations, go to their Acceuil
(Welcome) information kiosk and have an English-speaking representa-
tive direct you.
When traveling with a baby, you can arrange ahead of time for such
necessities as a crib and bottle warmer at your hotel, and, if you’re driv-
ing, a car seat (small children are prohibited from riding in the front
seat). Find out whether your hotel stocks baby food; if not, take some
with you for your first day, but then plan to buy some. Plenty of choices
are available, from Nestlé to Naturalia.
Transportation in Paris isn’t as stroller-friendly as in the United States.
Be prepared to lift your child out of the stroller when boarding buses,
climbing up and down stairs, and/or walking long distances in some
métro subway stations. The upside of all of this is that once you get to
your destination, you and your child can stroll and play in some of the
world’s prettiest parks and gardens.
And when you need some kid-free time, consider visiting the American
Church’s basement bulletin board where English-speaking (often
American) students post notices offering baby-sitting services. The
church is located at 65 quai d’Orsay, 7e (% 01-45-62-05-00; Métro:
Invalides). Or try one of the following agencies that employ some
English-speaking baby sitters: Allo Maman Dépannage (% 01-34-05-
00-47), or Kid Services (% 08-20-00-02-30 [.10/20¢ per minute]).
Specify when calling that you need a sitter who speaks English. 
The books Travels With Baby: The Ultimate Guide for Planning Trips with
Babies, Toddlers, and Pre-school Age Children by Shelly Rivoli (Travels
With Baby Books), How to Take Great Trips with Your Kids by Sanford
Portnoy (The Harvard Common Press), and Trouble-Free Travel With
Children: Over 700 Helpful Hints for Parents on the Go by Vicki Lansky
(The Book Peddlers) are full of good, general advice that can apply to
travel anywhere. Another reliable tome with a worldwide focus is
Adventuring with Children (Foghorn Press).
You can also check out Family Travel Times, published six times a year
by Travel with Your Children, 40 Fifth Ave., New York, NY 10011 (% 212-
477-5524; www.familytraveltimes.com). Subscriptions are $39 for one
year, $49 for two years. A free publication list and a sample issue are
available on request.
Finally, a word of advice: Although French people love kids and welcome
them just about anywhere, they expect them to be well mannered.
Proper behavior is expected everywhere, but especially in restaurants
and museums. French children are taught at an early age to behave
appropriately in these settings, and French adults expect the same from
your kids.

Making Age Work for You: Tips for Seniors
Mention that you’re a senior citizen when you first make your travel
reservations; you may be entitled to some discounts before you even get
to Paris. When you arrive in Paris, don’t be shy about asking for senior
discounts, and always carry a form of identification that shows your
date of birth.
People over the age of 60 qualify for reduced admission to theaters,
museums, and other attractions and for other travel bargains like the
Carte Senior, which entitles holders up to 50 percent discounts on TGV
rail services and couchette berths on non-TGV mainline services, sub-

Accessing Paris: Advice for 
Travelers with Disabilities
Unfortunately, those features that make Paris so beautiful — uneven
cobblestone streets, quaint buildings with high doorsills from the
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Paris 
62

Middle Ages, and twisting lanes too narrow and traffic-clogged to 
simultaneously admit pedestrians and autos — also make using a walker
or a wheelchair a nightmare. According to French law, newer hotels 
with three stars or more are required to have at least one wheelchair-
accessible guest room. Most of the city’s older, budget hotels, which are
exempt from the law, occupy buildings with winding staircases, or eleva-
tors smaller than phone booths, and generally aren’t good choices for
travelers with disabilities.
Slowly, but surely, however, Paris is becoming more accessible. There is
now space for wheelchairs in the first class cars of France’s high-speed
trains (le Train Grand Vitesse or TGV) — for the price of a second-class
ticket. For more information in English about traveling through France
by train go to www.voyages-sncf.fr.
Few métro stations have elevators, most feature long tunnels, and some
have wheelchair-unfriendly moving sidewalks and staircases. Escalators
often lead to flights of stairs, and many times when you climb a flight of
stairs, you’re faced with another set of stairs leading down. However,
line 14 of the métro is wheelchair accessible, and so are the stations at
Nanterre-Université, Vincennes, Noisiel, Saint-Maur-Créteil, Torcy, Auber,
Cité-Universitaire, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, Charles-de-Gaulle-Étoile,
Nanterre-Ville, and several others. The RER’s Line E is also wheelchair
accessible.
Wheelchair lifts or kneeling stairs are standard equipment on more than
50 city buses. Bus 91, which links the Bastille with Montparnasse, is
wheelchair accessible, and so are Bus 20, which runs from Gare St-
Lazare near Galeries Lafayette to Gare de Lyon, and Bus 31 from Charles
de Gaulle Étoile near the Arc de Triomphe to Gare de l’Est. Some high-
speed and intercity trains are equipped for wheelchair access, and a
special space is available in first class (at the price of a second-class
ticket) for wheelchairs, although you must reserve well in advance.
Don’t let inconveniences change your mind about visiting Paris. Before
your trip, go to the Paris Convention and Visitor’s Bureau Web site,
which provides an overview of facilities for people with disabilities in
the French transportation system and at monuments and museums in
Paris and the provinces (http://en.parisinfo.com/guide_paris/
rub5978.html&id_article=14572). This list contains everything from
tour guides to accessible parks to organizations for persons with disabil-
ities to specialized transport.

Following the Rainbow: Resources 
for Gay and Lesbian Travelers
France is one of the world’s most tolerant countries toward gays, trans-
gender, bi, and lesbians and has no laws that discriminate. Technically,
sexual relations are legal for consenting partners ages 16 and older. A
casual indifference to their lifestyles led many to settle here: Oscar
Wilde and James Baldwin lived in Paris, as did Gertrude Stein and Alice
B. Toklas.
The biggest concentration of gay bookstores, cafes, bars, and clothing
boutiques is in the Marais, which stretches from the Hôtel de Ville to the
Bastille. The best source of information on Parisian gay and lesbian life
is the Centre Gai et Lesbien, 63 rue Beaubourg, 3e (% 01-43-57-21-47;
www.centrelgbtparis.org; Métro: Rambuteau), open Monday 6 p.m.
until 8 p.m., Tuesday 4 to 8 p.m., Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday 12:30
to 8 p.m., Thursday 3 to 8 p.m., Sunday 4 to 7 p.m. The center is a source
of information, and members of its staff coordinate the activities and
meetings of gay people around the world. Another helpful source is 
La Maison des Femmes, 163 rue Charenton, 12e (% 01-43-43-41-13;
maisondesfemmes.free.fr; Métro: Reuilly-Diderot), which has a cafe
and a feminist library for lesbians and bisexual women. Meetings about
everything from sexism to working rights and informal dinners and get-
togethers all take place here.
Gay magazines that focus mainly on cultural events include Illico (free in
gay bars) and Tetu, available at almost all newspaper stands. This maga-
zine is similar to the U.S. publications Out and The Advocate, and each
issue has a separate pull-out section with cultural and nightlife events in
Paris and every major city in France. Lesbia is available for women. You
can find these and others at Paris’s largest and best-stocked gay book-
store, Les Mots à la Bouche, 6 rue Ste-Croix-la-Bretonnerie, 4e (% 01-
42-78-88-30; www.motsbouche.com; Métro: Hôtel-de-Ville). Open 11 a.m.
to 11 p.m. Monday through Saturday and 1 to 9 p.m. Sunday.
The International Gay and Lesbian Travel Association (IGLTA; % 800-
448-8550 or 954-776-2626; www.iglta.org) is the trade association for
the gay and lesbian travel industry. It offers an online directory of gay-
and lesbian-friendly travel businesses.
Many agencies offer tours and travel itineraries specifically for gay and
lesbian travelers. Now, Voyager (% 800-255-6951; www.nowvoyager.
com) is a well-known San Francisco–based gay-owned and -operated
travel service. Canada’s GayTraveler (www.gaytraveler.ca) is a Web
site dedicated to travel for the gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered
Chapter 6: Catering to Special Travel Needs or Interests 65

communities. The site has discussion boards and a free monthly
newsletter in addition to lists of all-gay cruises, tours, packages, and
other holiday events.
The following travel guides are available at most bookstores: Frommer’s
Gay & Lesbian Europe (Wiley), an excellent travel resource (www.
frommers.com); Out and About (www.outandabout.com), which offers
such guidebooks as Three Days in Paris packed with solid information on
the global gay and lesbian scene; Spartacus International Gay Guide
(Bruno Gmünder Verlag; www.spartacusworld.com/gayguide) and
Odysseus (Odysseus Enterprises; www.odyusa.com/html/trvlguide.
html), both good, annual English-language guidebooks focused on gay
men; and the Damron guides (www.damron.com), with separate annual
books for gay men and lesbians.

P
lanning a trip to Paris can be half the fun. This chapter helps you
organize those inevitable last-minute loose ends and details.
Getting a Passport
A valid passport is the only legal form of identification accepted around
the world. You can’t cross an international border without it. Getting a
passport is easy, but the process takes some time.
Applying for a U.S. passport
If you’re applying for a first-time passport, follow these steps.
1. Complete a passport application in person at a U.S. passport office;
a federal, state, or probate court; or a major post office. To find
your regional passport office, either check the U.S. Department 
of State Web site, http://travel.state.gov/passport/
passport_1738.html, or call the National Passport Information
Center (% 877-487-2778) for automated information.
2. Present a certified birth certificate as proof of citizenship.
(Bringing along your driver’s license, state or military ID, or social
security card is also a good idea.)
3. Submit two identical color passport-sized photos, measuring 2-x-2
inches in size. You often find businesses that take these photos

near a passport office. Note: You can’t use a strip from a photo-
vending machine because the pictures aren’t identical.
4. Pay a fee. For people 17 and over, a passport is valid for ten years
and costs $100. For those 16 and under, a passport is valid for five
years and costs $85.
Allow plenty of time before your trip to apply for a passport; processing
normally takes three weeks but can take longer during busy periods
(especially spring).
If you have a passport in your current name that was issued within the
past 15 years (and you were over age 16 when it was issued), you can
renew the passport by mail for $75.
Applying for other passports
The following list offers more information for citizens of Australia,
Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.
 Australians can visit a local post office or passport office, call 
the Australia Passport Information Service (% 131-232 toll-free
from Australia), or log on to www.passports.gov.au for details on
how and where to apply. The fee for Australian passports is AU$208
for adults, and AU$104 for children and seniors.
 Canadians can pick up applications at passport offices throughout
Canada and post offices (% 800-567-6868; www.ppt.gc.ca).
Applications must be accompanied by two identical passport-sized
photographs and proof of Canadian citizenship. Processing takes
10 to 18 days if you apply in person, or about three weeks by mail.
The cost is C$87 for adults; C$37 for children.
 New Zealanders can pick up a passport application at any New
Zealand Passports Office or download it from its Web site. For
information, contact the Passports Office or check out its Web site.
Contact the Passports Office at % 0800-225-050 in New Zealand or
log on to www.passports.govt.nz. The cost for an adult passport
is NZ$150; NZ$80 for a child’s passport. Processing takes ten busi-
ness days.
 United Kingdom residents can pick up applications for a standard
ten-year passport (five-year passport for children under 16) at
passport offices and Check & Send post offices. For information,
contact the United Kingdom Passport Service (% 0870-521-0410;
www.passport.gov.uk/index.asp). An adult passport is £72; a
child’s passport costs £46.
Always keep a photocopy of the inside page of your passport with your
picture packed separately from your wallet or purse. In the event your
passport is lost or stolen, the photocopy can help speed up the replace-
ment process. When traveling in a group, never let one person carry all
the passports. If the passports are stolen, obtaining new ones can be
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Paris 
68

much more difficult, because at least one person in a group needs to be
able to prove his or her identity to identify the others.
If you’re a U.S. citizen and either lose or have your passport stolen in
Paris, go to the Office of American Services, Embassy of the United
States between 9 a.m. and noon Monday to Friday at 4 av. Gabriel, 8e 
(% 01-43-12-22-22; http://france.usembassy.gov/pass-lost.html;
Métro: Concorde). Canadians in the same circumstances need to visit
the Consulate of the Canadian Embassy, 35 av. Montaigne, 8e (% 01-44-
43-29-00; Métro: Franklin-D-Roosevelt or Alma Marceau). Australians
must go to the Ambassade d’Australie at 4 rue Jean Rey, 15e (% 01-40-
59-33-00; Métro: Bir-Hakeim). New Zealanders need to visit the New
Zealand Embassy, 7 Ter rue Léonard de Vinci, 16e (% 01-45-01-43-43;
Métro: Victor-Hugo).
Why Not to Rent a Car in Paris
Gas is expensive. This should be reason enough to make use of France’s
excellent national train system, but if you are an extreme sports afi-
cionado, driving in Paris is for you. Parisian drivers are ruthlessly
aggressive. Traffic is dense. Roundabouts pop up everywhere, and cars
seem to hurtle at you from the left — no better example than the Étoile
circle that surrounds the Arc de Triomphe, where cars enter and exit
from 12 different locations at high speeds. Parking is difficult, both in
terms of finding a space and the size of the spaces available. Most
hotels, except luxury ones, don’t have garages. And if you drive to Paris
from somewhere else and get on the limited-access roadway called the
périphérique that circles the city, you’ll find that its exits aren’t num-
bered. Because the Paris métro is one of the world’s best urban trans-
portation systems, having a car in Paris seems highly unnecessary. Even
the day trips described in Chapter 14 are easily accessible by public
transportation.
If you must drive in Paris, make sure that you have a copilot helping you
navigate the streets. Children, by law, are required to sit in the back, and
front and backseat passengers must wear seat belts. And remember that
the majority of rentals available in France (and, indeed, most of Europe)
have manual (stick-shift) transmissions. In fact, if you request an auto-
matic transmission, you’ll probably end up paying more for the car, if a
car is even available.
When you rent a car, try doing so for three days or more because the
cost usually works out to be less per day than renting for one day, and
unlimited mileage is thrown in. Reserve before you leave home (make
sure to print out your reservation!), and keep in mind that government
taxes are calculated at about 20.6 percent of the total contract, collision
damage insurance tacks on 15 to 20 ($24–$32) per day, gas is very
expensive, and a surcharge of about 15 ($24) is assessed if you pick up
the car at the airport.
Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 69

Car rental agencies in Paris include:
 Avis, gare d’Austerlitz, arrivals gate, 13e (% 01-45-84-22-10;
www.avis.com). A compact car, such as a Renault Clio, that seats
four runs about 165 ($264) per day unlimited mileage before tax.
 Europcar, 60 bd. Diderot, 12e (% 08-25-35-23-52 [.20/30¢ per
minute]; www.europcar.fr). A compact two-door with air-
conditioning, such as the Volkswagen Golf, costs 190 ($304) 
per day with unlimited miles before tax.
 Hertz France, gare de l’Est (2, rue du 8 Mai 1945), 10e (% 01-42-
05-50-43; www.hertz.com). A compact car such as a Fiat Panda
costs about 196 ($314) per day with limited mileage.
 National, Charles de Gaulle Airport, Terminal One (% 01-48-62-
65-81; www.nationalcar.com). A compact five-door car that seats
four, such as a Citröen C4 1.6, costs 107 ($171) per day unlimited
mileage before tax.
The major highways (autoroutes) to Paris are the A1 from the north (the
United Kingdom and Belgium); the A13 from Normandy and other points
in northwest France; the A109 from Spain and the southwest; the A7
from the Alps, the Riviera, and Italy; and the A4 from eastern France. At
the beginning and end of long weekends, school breaks, and August
summer vacations, these roads become parking lots.
Playing It Safe with Travel 
and Medical Insurance
Three kinds of travel insurance are available: trip-cancellation insurance,
medical insurance, and lost luggage insurance. The cost of travel insur-
ance varies widely, depending on the cost and length of your trip, your
age and health, and the type of trip you’re taking, but expect to pay
between 5 percent and 8 percent of the vacation itself.
 Trip-cancellation insurance helps you get your money back if you
have to back out of a trip, if you have to go home early, or if your
travel supplier goes bankrupt. Allowed reasons for cancellation can
range from sickness to natural disasters to the Department of State
declaring your destination unsafe for travel. Protect yourself by
paying for the insurance with a credit card — by law, consumers
can get their money back on goods and services not received if
they report the loss within 60 days after the charge is listed on
their credit card statement.
Note: Many tour operators, particularly those offering trips to
remote or high-risk areas, include insurance in the cost of the trip
or can arrange insurance policies through a partnering provider, a
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Paris 
70

convenient and often cost-effective way for the traveler to obtain
insurance. Make sure the tour company is a reputable one, how-
ever: Some experts suggest you avoid buying insurance from the
tour or cruise company you’re traveling with, saying it’s better to
buy from a third-party insurer than to put all your money in one
place.
 Most health plans (including Medicare and Medicaid) do not pro-
vide medical insurance coverage for travel overseas, and the ones
that do often require you to pay for services up front and reim-
burse you only after you return home. Even if your plan does cover
overseas treatment, most out-of-country hospitals make you pay
your bills up front and send you a refund only after you return
home and file the necessary paperwork with your insurance com-
pany. As a safety net, you may want to buy travel medical insur-
ance, particularly if you’re traveling to a remote or high-risk area
where emergency evacuation is a possible scenario. If you require
additional medical insurance, try MEDEX Assistance (% 800-537-
2029; www.medexassist.com) or Travel Assistance International
(% 800-821-2828; www.travelassistance.com).
 Lost luggage insurance is not necessary for most travelers. On
international flights (including U.S. portions of international trips),
baggage coverage is limited to approximately $9.07 per pound, up
to approximately $635 per checked bag. If you plan to check items
more valuable than the standard liability, see if your valuables are
covered by your homeowner’s policy, or get baggage insurance as
part of your comprehensive travel-insurance package; the BagTrak
product is included in Travel Guard International’s travel insurance
packages (% 800-826-1300; www.travelguard.com). Don’t buy
insurance at the airport, as it’s usually overpriced. Be sure to take
any valuables or irreplaceable items with you in your carry-on lug-
gage, as many valuables (including books, money, and electronics)
aren’t covered by airline policies.
If your luggage is lost, immediately file a lost-luggage claim at the
airport, detailing the luggage contents. For most airlines, you must
report delayed, damaged, or lost baggage within four hours of
arrival. The airlines are required to deliver luggage, once found,
directly to your house or destination free of charge.
For more information on travel insurance, contact one of the following
recommended insurers: Access America (% 800-284-8300; www.access
america.com); Travel Insured International (% 800-243-3174; www.

Staying Healthy when You Travel
I know you’re not going to get sick on this vacation, so feel free to skip
over this section! Of course, the last time I checked, those nasty flu bugs
weren’t listening to me any more than they probably listen to you, so
just in case you’re bitten . . . 
The French government pays 70 percent of the cost of doctor visits, and
its national health insurance covers 99 percent of France’s population.
Visitors needing medical care in France find that same-day appointments
are easily made, and patient fees are relatively inexpensive. Patients
almost always have to pay up front, unless they’re citizens of European
Union countries with reciprocal medical arrangements. Some U.S. health
insurance companies reimburse you for the cost of treating illnesses in
foreign countries; make sure to keep all your receipts.
If you do get sick, ask the concierge at your hotel to recommend a local
doctor — even his or her own doctor, if necessary. You can also call SOS
Medecins (% 01-47-07-77-77), a 24-hour service. Ask for an English-
speaking doctor. The Centre Médicale Europe, 44 rue d’Amsterdam, 9e
(% 01-42-81-93-33; www.centre-medical-europe.com), is another
good and efficient option. It has a host of specialists, and foreigners pay
around 30 ($48) for a consultation. If you’re in urgent need of a dentist,
try SOS Urgences Stomatologiques et Dentaires, 87 bd. Port-Royal 
(% 01-43-36-36-00).
Talk to your doctor before leaving on a trip if you have a serious and/or
chronic illness. For conditions such as epilepsy, diabetes, or heart prob-
lems, wear a MedicAlert identification tag (% 888-633-4298; www.
medicalert.org), which immediately alerts doctors to your condition
and gives them access to your records through MedicAlert’s 24-hour
hotline. Contact the International Association for Medical Assistance to
Travelers (IAMAT; % 519-836-0102; www.iamat.org) for tips on travel
and health concerns in the countries you’re visiting, and lists of local,
English-speaking doctors. The United States Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (% 800-232-4636; www.cdc.gov) provides up-to-date
information on health hazards by region or country and offers tips on
food safety.
Staying Connected by Cellphone or E-mail
The three letters that define much of the world’s wireless capabilities
are GSM (Global System for Mobiles), a big, seamless network that
makes for easy cross-border cellphone use throughout Europe and
dozens of other countries worldwide. In the United States, T-Mobile,
AT&T Wireless, and Verizon use this quasi-universal system; in Canada,
Microcell uses GSM, and all Europeans and most Australians use GSM.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Paris 
72

If your cellphone is on a GSM system, you can make and receive calls
across civilized areas on much of the globe, from Andorra to Uganda.
Just call your wireless operator and activate international roaming on
your account. Unfortunately, per-minute charges can be high — usually
$1 to $1.50 in Western Europe and up to $5 in such places as Russia and
Indonesia.
That’s why it’s important to buy an unlocked world phone from the get-
go. Many cellphone operators sell locked phones that restrict you from
using any other removable computer memory phone chip card (called a
SIM card) other than the ones they supply. Having an unlocked phone
allows you to install a cheap, prepaid SIM card (found at a local retailer)
in your destination country. (Show your phone to the salesperson; not
all phones work on all networks.) You get a local phone number — 
and much, much lower calling rates. Getting an already locked phone
unlocked can be a complicated process, but it can be done; just call your
cellular operator and say you’re going abroad for several months and
want to use the phone with a local provider.
For many, renting a phone is a good idea. (Even owners of cellphones
with international calling capabilities have to rent new phones if they’re
traveling to non-GSM regions, such as Japan or Korea.) Although you can
rent a phone from any number of overseas sites, including kiosks at air-
ports and at car rental agencies, I suggest renting the phone before you
leave home. One good place is www.roadpost.com. You can rent a
phone from them that starts at $59 for basic service (plus $1.45 per
minute) in France. The phone comes with your own number, voice mail,
call forwarding, adaptors and accessories for your travel destinations,
and free 24/7 technical support. When you return home, just ship the
phone back to Road Post in the prepaid envelope they provide. You can
give loved ones and business associates your new number, make sure
the phone works, and take the phone wherever you go — especially
helpful for overseas trips through several countries, where local phone-
rental agencies often bill in local currency and may not let you take the
phone to another country.
In France, phone rental isn’t cheap. You usually pay $40 to $50 per 
week, plus airtime fees of at least a dollar a minute. One option is www.
mobirent.fr, a French company that specializes in phone rental and
will deliver to your lodging. The phone and its accessories are accompa-
nied by one of three pricing plans: first class, business class, or econ-
omy. Economy rates are 52 ($83) for 90 minutes of calling in France,
162 ($260) for 90 minutes of calls to North America, and 243 ($389)
for 90 minutes of calls to the rest of the world. With rates like this, it may
be more prudent to just buy a cellphone in France. For under $100, you
get a phone and accessories, and some free minutes — don’t forget that
unlike mobile phone services in the States, receiving calls and text mes-
sages in France is free, and you can still call most places in Europe or
America at somewhat reasonable rates. Cellphone stores abound in
Paris: the biggest are SFR (there’s a branch at 125 rue de Rennes, 6e;
Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 73

Métro: St-Placide), France Télécom (a central location is 46 bis rue de
Louvre, 1e; Métro: Les Halles), and Bouygues Télécom (33 rue de Rivoli,
4e; Métro: Hôtel de Ville). The first two companies provide better quality
service and less blackout periods, while Bouygues Télécom is generally
cheaper. You can also ask about rental policies at these stores; however,
at the time of this writing, these companies are ceasing to offer this 
service.
Accessing the Internet Away from Home
Travelers have any number of ways to check their e-mail and access the
Internet on the road. Of course, using your own laptop — or even a PDA
(personal digital assistant) or electronic organizer with a modem — gives
you the most flexibility. But even if you don’t have a computer, you can
still access your e-mail and even your office computer from cybercafes.
It’s hard nowadays to find a city that doesn’t have a few cybercafes.
Although there’s no definitive directory for cybercafes — they are inde-
pendent businesses, after all — two places to start looking are at www.
cybercaptive.com and www.cybercafe.com.
Aside from formal cybercafes, most youth hostels nowadays have at
least one computer you can use to get on the Internet. And most public
libraries across the world offer Internet access free or for a small
charge. You can always find a cybercafe near a college; in France the
Latin Quarter abounds with them around rue des Écoles and boulevard
St-Michel. Try Luxembourg Micro, 81 bd. St-Michel, 5e (% 01-46-33-
27-98; Métro: St-Michel). Avoid hotel business centers unless you’re will-
ing to pay exorbitant rates.
If you plan to take a laptop to Paris, ask if your hotel has free or cheap
wireless access. T-Mobile Hotspot (www.t-mobile.com/hotspot)
serves up wireless connections at more than 1,000 Starbucks coffee
shops nationwide and at the Starbucks locations in Paris. Boingo (www.
boingo.com) and Wayport (www.wayport.com) have networks in air-
ports and high-class hotel lobbies. iPass (www.ipass.com) providers
also give you access to a few hundred wireless hotel lobby setups, in
such Parisian hotels as Le Meridien Montparnasse and Holiday Inn Tour
Eiffel. The companies’ pricing policies can be complicated, with a variety
of monthly, per-connection, and per-minute plans, but in general you 
pay around $30 a month for limited access — and as more and more
companies jump on the wireless bandwagon, prices are likely to get
more competitive.
If Wi-Fi is not available at your destination, most business-class hotels
throughout the world offer dataports for laptop modems, and a few
thousand hotels in the United States and Europe offer free high-speed
Internet access using an Ethernet network cable. You can bring your
own cables, but most hotels rent them for around $10. Call your hotel in
advance to see what your options are.

Keeping Up with Airline 
Security Measures
Today security procedures at airports around the world mean longer
waits in lines and getting to the airport earlier, especially for an interna-
tional flight. Generally, you’ll be fine if you arrive at the airport one and
a half hours before a domestic flight and three hours before an interna-
tional flight.
Bring a current, government-issued photo ID such as a driver’s license
or passport (of course you will need your passport if you are traveling
to France). Keep your ID at the ready to show at check-in, the security
checkpoint, and sometimes even the gate. (Children under 18 do not
need government-issued photo IDs for domestic flights, but they do for
international flights to most countries.)
Speed up security by not wearing metal objects such as big belt buckles
and make sure to pack all liquids (this includes makeup, toothpaste, and
so on) in your check-in baggage. If you have metallic body parts, a note
from your doctor can prevent a long chat with the security screeners.
Keep in mind that only ticketed passengers are allowed past security,
except for folks escorting passengers or children with disabilities.
Travelers in the U.S. are allowed one carry-on bag, plus a “personal
item” such as a purse, briefcase, or laptop bag. The Transportation
Security Administration (TSA) has stabilized what you can carry on and
what you can’t. The general rule for carry-on luggage is that sharp things
are out as are all liquids, including water bottles, gels, lotions, and any
similar items (makeup, lipstick, and toothpaste, and so forth). Be sure to
pack any of these items in your checked baggage or they will be confis-
cated. Baby formula, breast milk, and prescriptions are some of the
exceptions to the rule (the name on the prescription must match the
name of the passenger). To be safe, visit the TSA Web site at www.tsa.
gov for a current list of restricted items.

his section helps you get from point A to point B without
wasting time and money. Better yet, it suggests great
places to stay and tells you all you want to know about eating
French-style and then directs you to some memorable eater-
ies. Chapter 8 guides you from the airport to your hotel,
describes the most popular neighborhoods, and tells you
where to go for information once you’re in Paris. Read
Chapter 9 for reviews of the best accommodations in Paris —
for all budgets. Chapter 10 proves that Paris is indeed a feast
with an overview of the local dining scene, advice on how to
trim the fat from your food budget, and recommendations for
some of the best restaurants, brasseries, cafes, wine bars, tea
salons, and sandwich places in the city. A handy index cross-
references all the dining establishments by neighborhood,
price, and type.

 Navigating the city
T
he Paris experience begins for most on the plane, where announce-
ments are made in English and French. For others it begins at the 
airport — with bi- and trilingual signs directing you to passport control
and baggage claim. The airports are now mostly nonsmoking, but the
smell of cigarettes remains, though faintly. Luggage carts are free!
Depending on when you travel, you might experience long lines at pass-
port control. People dress more formally than at home. It all may seem a
little astonishing. But, the important thing is you’ve arrived! Now you
can move on to the first item of the day — getting from the airport to
your hotel.
Navigating Your Way through 
Passport Control and Customs
Most visitors to Paris land at Charles de Gaulle Airport. It’s known as
CDG and sometimes called Roissy-Charles de Gaulle. Nearly all direct
flights from North America land at Charles de Gaulle. Bilevel Terminal 1
(Aérogare 1) is the older and smaller of the two terminals and is used by
foreign airlines. Narrow escalators and moving sidewalks connect its
podlike cement terminals. The bright and spacious Terminal 2 (Aérogare
2) is divided into halls A through F and is used by Air France, domestic
and intra-European airlines, and some foreign airlines, including Air
Canada.

A free shuttle bus (navette) connects Terminals 1 and 2. Signs in French
and English in both terminals direct you to Customs, baggage claim, and
transportation to the city. Staff at information desks are also on hand to
answer questions.
Two lines are set up for passport control, one for European Union
nationals and the other for everyone else. These lines can move quite
quickly or horrendously slowly; it usually depends on the clerk checking
your passport.
When passing through Customs, keep in mind that restrictions are differ-
ent for citizens of the European Union than they are for citizens of non-
E.U. countries. As a non-E.U. national, you can bring in 200 cigarettes or
100 cigarillos or 50 cigars or 250 grams of smoking tobacco duty-free.
You can also bring in two liters of wine and one liter of alcohol of more
than 80 proof. In addition, you can bring in 50 grams of perfume, and a
quarter-liter of eau de toilette. Travelers can also bring in 175 ($280) in
other goods. (See Chapter 12 for what you’re allowed to bring home.)
Because you probably aren’t going to need to make a claim, you should
be waved through by an officer pretty quickly. Customs officers do, how-
ever, pull random travelers over to check luggage. Whenever that hap-
pens to you, don’t be offended; be polite and as helpful as you can, and
if you don’t speak French, let them know by saying, “Je ne parle pas
français” (zhe ne parl pah frahn-say).
Regardless of the terminal, you need euro to get from the airport into
Paris. You can find ATMs in the arrival areas of the airports along with
bureaux de change, where you can exchange dollars for euro, but you’re
better off buying and bringing 300 ($480) from your bank at home.
Airport ATMs are notorious for being broken when you need them most,
and the airport bureaux de change are just as notorious for their bad
rates of exchange.
Making Your Way to Your Hotel
You can travel to and from the airports by several different means, and
the amount of text here notwithstanding, they’re all easy!
If you fly into Charles de Gaulle
Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG) is located 23km (15 miles) northeast of
downtown Paris. Transportation into the city is plentiful.
Taking a taxi
Probably the easiest, but certainly not the cheapest, mode of transporta-
tion to your hotel from the airport is by taxi. A cab into town from
Charles de Gaulle takes 40 to 50 minutes, depending on traffic. The initial
fare for up to three passengers is 2.20 ($3.50) and rises .85 ($1.35) for
each kilometer between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. Between 5 p.m. and 10 a.m.,
Part III: Settling into Paris 
80

the standing charge remains the same, but the per-kilometer charge
rises to 1.10 ($1.80). An additional fee of 1 ($1.60) is imposed for lug-
gage weighing more than 5kg (11 lb.) or for an extra bag. If your French
is poor or nonexistent, write down the name and full address of your
hotel. The five-digit postal code is the most important morsel of informa-
tion, because it tells the driver the arrondissement where to take you.
Look up the code and check the meter before you pay — rip-offs of arriv-
ing tourists are not uncommon. Whenever you strongly think that you
may have been overcharged, demand a receipt (un réçu, ray-soo), which
drivers are obligated to provide, and contact the Paris Préfecture of
Police (% 01-53-71-53-71).
The taxi stands at Charles de Gaulle are located at:
 CDG Terminal 1: Exit 20, arrivals level
 CDG Terminals 2A and 2C: Exit 6
 CDG Terminals 2B and 2D: Exit 7
 CDG Terminal 2e and 2F: Exit 1
 CDG Terminal 3: Arrivals level
Taking a shuttle
If you don’t want to schlep your bags through Paris’s streets and métro
stations, taking an airport shuttle is definitely the way to go. Although
more expensive than airport buses and trains, shuttles are much
cheaper and roomier than taxis. And you can reserve a seat in advance
and pay by credit card. World Shuttle, 13 rue Voltaire, 94400 Vitry-sur-
Seine (% 01-46-80-14-67; www.world-shuttles.com), costs 26 ($42)
for one person, 17 ($27) per person for two or more from Charles de
Gaulle and Orly. The price per van (before 5:30 a.m.) is 70 ($112) for
two to four people.
PariShuttle (% 01-53-39-18-18; www.parishuttle.com) offers a similar
service. You’re picked up in a minivan at Orly or Charles de Gaulle and
taken to your hotel for 27 ($43) for one person, 20 ($32) per person
for groups of two to four people, and 17 ($27) per person for five to
eight people. The cost for children up to ten years is 10 ($16).
Riding the rails
A good option when you’re not overloaded with baggage and want to
keep your expenses down is to take the suburban commuter train to the
métro. RER (Réseau Express Régional) Line B stops near Terminals 1
and 2. Easy, cheap, and convenient, you can ride both to and from the
airport from 5 a.m. to midnight Monday through Friday and 7 a.m. to 
9 p.m. weekends.
Free shuttle buses connect terminals CDG 1 to the RER train station. You
can pick up the free shuttle bus in CDG Terminal 1 by following the RER

Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 83

B logos (with a picture of a bus alongside) to the exit on the arrivals
level. CDG 2 has direct access to the RER station; follow the round RER B
logos.
Buy the RER ticket, which costs 8.40 ($13) at the RER ticket counter
and hang onto it in case of ticket inspection. (You can be fined if you
can’t produce your ticket for an inspector.) You will need your ticket
later to get off the RER system and onto the métro.
Depending where your hotel is located, you exit either on the Right or
the Left Bank. From the airport station, trains depart about every 15
minutes for the 40- to 50-minute trip into town and stop on the Right
Bank at Gare du Nord and Châtelet-Les Halles, and on the Left Bank at
St-Michel, Luxembourg, Port-Royal, and Denfert-Rochereau, before head-
ing south out of the city.
Boarding the bus
A bus is better than the RER if:
 You’re heading into Paris during off-peak driving hours, and you’re
not in a hurry.
 Your hotel is located near one of the drop-off points. Note: The bus
is most convenient for the hotels I recommend in the 2e and 8e
arrondissements. If you’re staying outside these arrondissements,
you can take a taxi from the shuttle drop-off point or board the
closest subway if you aren’t loaded down with luggage. If a bus isn’t
convenient, check out the door-to-door airport shuttle services in
the earlier “Taking a shuttle” section.
If your hotel is located on the Right Bank, in the 8e, 16e, or 17e arron-
dissements, take Les Cars Air France coach Line 2, which stops at rue
Gouvion Saint-Cyr at Porte Maillot before ending up at 1 av. Carnot at
place Charles de Gaulle-Étoile, the name for the huge traffic roundabout
at the Arc de Triomphe. The bus costs 14 ($22) one-way and runs
every 15 minutes from 5:45 a.m. to 11 p.m. You do not have to be a pas-
senger on an Air France flight to use the service, and tickets are avail-
able in a small office next to the bus or from the bus driver. The trip
from the airport into the city and vice versa takes about 40 minutes in
light traffic, such as on weekend mornings. During weekday morning
rush hour, however, the same trip can take twice as long. Pick up the
coach from:
 CDG Terminal 1: Gate 34, arrivals level
 CDG Terminals 2B and 2D: Gate 6
 CDG Terminal 2E and 2F: Gate 3, arrivals level
If your hotel is located on the Right Bank near the Bastille (11e or 12e)
or on the Left Bank in Montparnasse (14e), take the Air France Line 4
coach, which stops at boulevard Diderot in front of the Gare de Lyon
Part III: Settling into Paris 
84

before ending up on rue du Commandant Mouchotte near the back of
the Gare de Montparnasse. The bus costs 10 ($16) one-way and runs
every 30 minutes from 5:55 a.m. to 10:55 p.m. both to and from the air-
port. It takes about 50 minutes to get from the airport into the city in
light traffic. Catch this coach from:
 CDG Terminal 1: Gate 34, arrivals level
 CDG Terminals 2B and 2D: Exit 6
 CDG Terminal 2E and 2F: Gate 3, arrivals level
Take the Roissybus if your hotel is on the Right Bank near the Opéra (2e
or 9e). It costs 8.90 ($14) and leaves every 15 minutes from the airport
between 6 a.m. and 7 p.m. and every 20 minutes between 7 p.m. and 11
p.m. The drop-off point is on rue Scribe, a block from the Opéra Garnier
near American Express. You can get to your destination in 45 to 60 min-
utes in regular traffic. Buy your tickets in the small office next to where
the bus is parked or on the bus. Pick up this coach from:
 CDG Terminal 1: Gate 30, Arrivals
 CDG Terminals 2A and 2C: Gate 9 from Terminal 2A
 CDG Terminal 2B and 2D: Gate 11
 CDG Terminal 2E and 2F: Arrivals level
If you fly into Orly
Orly Airport, 14km (81⁄2 miles) south of the city, has two terminals —
Ouest (West) and Sud (South) — and English speakers find the terminals
easy to navigate. French domestic flights land at Orly Ouest, and intra-
European and intercontinental flights land at Orly Sud. Shuttle buses
connect these terminals, and other shuttles connect them to Charles de
Gaulle every 30 minutes or so. A tourist information desk is conveniently
located on the arrivals level of both terminals.
Like Charles de Gaulle Airport, two lines are set up for passport control;
one for European Union nationals, one for visitors carrying passports
from all other countries, and you should be waved through Customs.
(See the previous section, “Navigating Your Way through Passport
Control and Customs” for information about what you can bring into
France.)
Taking a taxi
A cab from Orly into Paris costs about 40 ($64), depending on traffic,
and takes anywhere from 25 minutes to an hour. The taxi stand at Orly
Sud is just outside Exit M; at Orly Ouest it’s at Exit I. The same advice as
when taking a taxi from Charles de Gaulle holds true here: Write down
the full name and address of your hotel for the driver. And remember
that cabs charge 1 ($1.60) for each piece of luggage put in the trunk.
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 85

Busing is best — sometimes
Take the Les Cars Air France coach Line 1 if your hotel is located on the
Left Bank near Les Invalides (7e). Buses leave Orly Sud at Gate L, and
Orly Ouest at Gate H, arrivals level, every 15 minutes from 6:15 a.m. to
11:15 p.m. The trip takes about 30 minutes and costs 10 ($16). You can
request that the bus stop at Montparnasse-Duroc (14e).
The cheapest trip into town is on the Jetbus. You take this bus from Orly
to Métro station Villejuif-Louis Aragon in south Paris (13e). It costs 6.40
($10) for the 15-minute journey. Beginning at 6:34 a.m., the bus leaves
every 15 minutes from Orly Sud, Gate H, and from Orly Ouest at Gate C
on the arrivals level. The bus departs Paris for Orly from 6:15 a.m. to
10:15 p.m.
Taking the train
If you’re staying on the Left Bank, take the RER C line by catching a free
shuttle bus from Gate Orly Sud and Gate G at Orly Ouest to the Rungis
station, where RER C trains leave every 15 minutes for Gare d’Austerlitz
(13e). A one-way fare is 6 ($8) for the train for adults and 4.25 ($5.68)
for children. The trip into the city takes about 30 minutes, making vari-
ous stops along the Seine on the Left Bank.
If you’re staying on the Right Bank, you can take the Orlyval/RER B line
to Antony Métro station (from Gate K in Orly South and Gate W in Orly
West). You connect at the Antony RER station where you board the RER
B train to Paris. Hold on to the ticket because you will need it to get into
the métro/RER system. A trip to the Châtelet station on the Right Bank
takes about 30 minutes and costs 6.10 ($9.75) for the RER train and
7.40 ($12) for Orlyval. Once in Paris, the train stops at Denfert-
Rochereau, Port-Royal, Luxembourg, and St-Michel on the Left Bank,
and then crosses to the Right Bank for stops at Châtelet and Gare du
Nord.
Figuring Out the Neighborhoods
You arrive at your hotel, check in, and maybe unpack a little. But taking
a nap prolongs your jet lag. So, go out and act like a Parisian by having a
cup of coffee at a cafe before getting ready to explore.
The Seine River divides Paris into two halves: the Right Bank (Rive
Droite) on the north side of the river and the Left Bank (Rive Gauche) on
the south side of the river. The larger Right Bank is where you find the
city’s business sector, stately monuments, and high-fashion industry.
The Left Bank has the publishing houses, universities, and a reputation
as bohemian because students, philosophers, and creative types have
been congregating here for centuries. Two of the city’s tallest monu-
ments are on the Left Bank — the Tour Montparnasse (that lonely tall
black building hovering on the edge of the city) and the Eiffel Tower.
Part III: Settling into Paris 
86

The city is divided into 20 numbered arrondissements (municipal dis-
tricts). The layout of these districts follows a distinct pattern. The first
(abbreviated 1er for premiere) arrondissement is the dead center of
Paris, comprising an area around Notre-Dame and the Louvre. From
there, the rest of the districts spiral outward, clockwise, in ascending
order. The lower the arrondissement number, the more central the loca-
tion. To get a better idea, consult the “Paris Neighborhoods” map.
Arrondissement numbers are key to locating an address in Paris. And
this book lists addresses the way they appear in Paris, with the arron-
dissement number following the specific street address (for instance, 29
rue de Rivoli, 4e, is in the fourth arrondissement). Arrondissement num-
bers are noted on street signs and are indicated by the last two digits of
the postal code. An address with a postal code of 75007 is located in the
seventh arrondissement. Once you know the arrondissement in which
an address is located, finding that spot is much easier. Numbers on
buildings running parallel to the Seine usually follow the course of the
river east to west. On north-south streets, numbering begins at the river.
Neighborhoods in the following sections are listed first by arrondisse-
ment, and then by neighborhood name. Only the better-known 
arrondissements — meaning the ones that you’re most likely to stay in
or visit — are mentioned here.
On the Right Bank
The following are the neighborhoods you’re likely to visit on the Right
Bank.
1er: Musée du Louvre/Palais-Royal/
Les Halles/Ile de la Cité
Traditionally, people consider the Right Bank to be more upscale, with
Paris’s main boulevards, such as Champs-Elysées, and museums such as
the Louvre. One of the world’s greatest art museums (some say the
greatest), the Louvre, still lures visitors to Paris to the 1er arrondisse-
ment. You can see the contrast between many of the city’s elegant
addresses along the rue de Rivoli and arched arcades under which all
kinds of touristy junk is sold. Walk through the Jardin des Tuileries, the
most formal garden of Paris, and take in the classic beauty, opulence,
and wealth of the place Vendôme, which is home to the Ritz Hotel.
Browse the arcaded shops and view the striped columns and seasonal
art on display in the garden of the Palais Royal, once the home to
Cardinal Richelieu. The slightly seedy Forum des Halles, an above- and
below-ground shopping and entertainment center, is also here.
This arrondissement tends to be crowded, and hotel prices are higher
during Paris’s high tourist season (in early fall) because the area is so
convenient. Aristocratic town houses, courtyards, and antiques shops,
flower markets, the Palais de Justice, Notre-Dame Cathedral, and
Sainte-Chapelle (the chapel built in 1243 for St. Louis, famous for its 
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 87

gorgeous stained-glass windows) are also part of the 1er on Ile de la Cité,
an island in the Seine. This is one of Paris’s prettiest and most crowded
neighborhoods, as is its sister island, Ile St-Louis (see “4e: Ile St-Louis/
Centre Pompidou” below).
2e: La Bourse
Often overlooked by tourists, the 2e houses the Bourse (stock exchange),
and some of the pretty 19th-century covered shopping passageways.
The district, lying between the Grands Boulevards and the rue Etienne
Marcel, is also home to the up-and-coming Sentier area, where the gar-
ment trade is located, and wholesale fashion outlets abound. Sex shops
and prostitutes line parts of the rue St-Denis, but the nearby area known
as Montorgueil has lined former seedy streets with upscale and trendy
cafes and boutiques, turning the area into a desirable location and a nice
tourist destination.
3e: Le Marais
Le Marais (translated as “the swamp”) is one of Paris’s hippest neigh-
borhoods, and one of the city’s most popular attractions, the Musée
Picasso, and one of the more interesting museums, Musée Carnavalet,
are located here. Paris’s old Jewish neighborhood is located around the
rue des Rosiers, and the rue Vieille-du-Temple is home to numerous gay
bars and boutiques. Sadly, the hip boutiques that can pay the area’s
extremely high rents are beginning to crowd out the old stalwarts. Jo
Goldenberg, the venerable Jewish deli, closed its doors in 2007.
4e: Ile St-Louis/Centre Pompidou
Aristocratic town houses, courtyards, and antiques shops, the Brasserie
Ile-St-Louis (a historic brasserie with literary associations), Berthillon
(reputed to be Paris’s best ice cream), the Centre Georges Pompidou
museum, and the place des Vosges make up the 4e arrondissement,
which is located partly on the Ile St-Louis and partly in the Marais dis-
trict. The area around the Centre Pompidou is one of Paris’s more eclec-
tic; you see everyone from pierced and Goth-style art students to chic
Parisians walking their children to school to tourists buying football
shirts from one of the many souvenir stores.
8e: Champs-Elysées/Madeleine
The 8e is the heart of the Right Bank, and its showcase is the Champs-
Elysées. The Champs stretches from the Arc de Triomphe to the city’s
oldest monument, the Egyptian obelisk on place de la Concorde. The
fashion houses, the most elegant hotels, expensive restaurants and
shops, and the most fashionably attired Parisians are here.
9e: Opéra Garnier/Pigalle
Everything from the Quartier de l’Opéra (the neighborhood around the
Opéra Garnier) to the strip joints of Pigalle falls within the 9e, which was
radically altered by Baron Haussmann’s 19th-century redevelopment
Part III: Settling into Paris 
88

projects; his Grands Boulevards radiate through the district. You’ll prob-
ably pay a visit to the 9e to shop at its famous department stores Au
Printemps and Galeries Lafayette. Try to visit the Opéra Garnier (Paris
Opera House), if only to see the gorgeous ceiling by Marc Chagall.
10e: Gare du Nord/Gare de l’Est
In the movie Amélie, the young heroine likes to skip stones on the Canal
St-Martin in the hip neighborhood of the same name with a burgeoning
night scene, located here. Though most of this arrondissement is dreary
(Gare du Nord and Gare de l’Est are two of the city’s four main train
stations), the canal’s quai de Valmy and quai de Jemmapes are scenic,
tree-lined promenades. The classic movie Hotel du Nord was also filmed
here.
11e: Opéra Bastille
The 11e has few landmarks (though its Bastille monument is one of
France’s most well-known) or famous museums, but the area has
become a mecca for hordes of young Parisians looking for casual, in-
expensive nightlife. Always crowded on weekends and in summer, the
overflow retires to the steps of the Opéra Bastille, where inline skaters
and skateboarders skate and teens flirt. A market on the weekends on
Boulevard Richard Lenoir across from the Bastille monument features
the creations of more than 200 artists.
16e: Trocadéro/Bois de Boulogne
This area of Paris is where the moneyed live. Highlights include the Bois
de Boulogne (the huge wooded park on Paris’s western edge), the
Jardin du Trocadéro (known for its famous fountains bordering the
Eiffel Tower), the Musée de Balzac, the Musée Guimet (famous for its
Asian collections), and the Cimetière de Passy, resting place of Manet,
Talleyrand, Giraudoux, and Debussy. One of the largest arrondissements,
the 16e is known today for its exclusivity, its BCBG residents (Bon Chic
Bon Genre, or yuppie), its upscale rents, and some rather posh (and,
according to its critics, rather smug) residential boulevards. The
arrondissement includes what some visitors consider the best place in
Paris from which to view the Eiffel Tower, the place du Trocadéro.
18e: Montmartre
The Moulin Rouge, the Basilica of Sacré-Coeur (the white domed struc-
ture on a hill overlooking Paris), and the place du Tertre (the square
filled with restaurants behind it) are only some of the attractions in this
outer arrondissement. Take a walk through the winding old streets here,
and you feel transported into another era. The Bateau-Lavoir, Picasso’s
first studio in Paris, is also here. The city’s most famous flea market,
Marché aux Puces de la Porte de St-Ouen, is nearby in the 20e.
On the Left Bank
The following are neighborhoods you’re likely to visit on the Left Bank.
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 89

5e: Latin Quarter
Bookstores, schools, churches, nightclubs, student dives, Roman ruins,
publishing houses, and expensive boutiques characterize this district,
which is called Latin because students and professors at the Sorbonne,
located here, once spoke Latin exclusively. Stroll along quai de Monte-
bello, inspecting the inventories of the bouquinistes (booksellers), and
wander the shops in the old streets of rue de la Huchette and rue de la
Harpe (but don’t eat here; you can find much better places). The 5e 
also stretches down to the Panthéon and to the steep cobblestone rue
Mouffetard behind it, where you can visit one of the city’s best produce
markets, eat at a variety of ethnic restaurants, or raise a glass in très
cool Café Contrescarpe.
6e: St-Germain and the Luxembourg Gardens
The art school that turned away Rodin, the École des Beaux-Arts, is
here, and so are some of the chicest designers around. But the secret of
the district lies in discovering its narrow streets and hidden squares.
Everywhere you turn here, you encounter famous historical and literary
associations. For instance, the restaurant Brasserie Lipp is where
Hemingway lovingly recalls eating potato salad in A Moveable Feast,
and the Café les Deux Magots is depicted in the movie adaptation of
Hemingway’s The Sun Also Rises. The 6e takes in the rue de Fleurus
where Gertrude Stein lived with Alice B. Toklas, and down the street is
the wonderful Luxembourg Gardens, probably local residents’ most
loved park. (Try to find the Statue of Liberty in the garden.)
7e: Near the Eiffel Tower and Musée d’Orsay
The city’s most famous symbol, the Eiffel Tower, dominates the 7e, 
and part of the St-Germain neighborhood is here, too. The Hôtel des
Invalides, which contains Napoléon’s Tomb and the Musée de l’Armée,
are in the 7e, in addition to the Musée Rodin and the Musée d’Orsay, the
world’s premier showcase of 19th-century French art and culture. The
Left Bank’s only department store, Le Bon Marché, is also located here,
and so is a warren of streets along which beautiful shoes, clothing, and
household objects are sold.
13e: Butte-aux-Cailles and Chinatown
Although high-rises dominate much of 13e, a nightlife scene emerged
around 2000 on barges along the quai Tolbiac (where the Bibliothèque
François Mitterand sits) and in the cozy network of winding streets that
make up the Butte-aux-Cailles (literally “hill of pebbles”) neighborhood.
The 13e is a lively hub for Paris’s Asian community with Vietnamese and
Chinese restaurants along avenue d’Ivry and avenue de Choisy next to
stores selling all kinds of items from France’s former colonies in South-
east Asia. The Chinese New Year Parade takes place here in late January
or February.
Part III: Settling into Paris 
90

14e: Montparnasse
Montparnasse is the former stomping ground of the lost generation —
writers Gertrude Stein, Ernest Hemingway, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Ford
Madox Ford, and other American expatriates gathered here in the 1920s.
After World War II, it ceased to be the center of intellectual life in Paris,
but the memories linger. Some of the world’s most famous literary cafes,
including La Rotonde, Le Select, Le Dôme, and La Coupole, are in the
northern end of this large arrondissement, near the Rodin statue of
Balzac at the junction of boulevard Montparnasse and boulevard
Raspail. Some of those same literary giants (most notably Jean-Paul
Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir) are buried nearby, in the Cimitière du
Montparnasse. At its southern end, the arrondissement contains pleas-
ant residential neighborhoods filled with well-designed apartment build-
ings, many built between 1910 and 1940.
Finding Information after You Arrive

Getting around Paris
Probably your best introduction to Paris, and to the way the city is laid
out, is from the north tower at Notre-Dame. You can see the magnificent
cathedral from many parts of the city, and a visit helps you get oriented.
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 91

By métro
The best way to get around Paris is to walk, but for longer distances the
métro, or subway, rules. The Métropolitain is fast, safe, and easy to navi-
gate. Open from 5:45 a.m. to 12:45 a.m., it’s an efficient and cheap way 
to get around. You may want to avoid it during rush hour, between 7 to
10 a.m. and 6 to 8 p.m. Operated by the RATP (Régie Autonome des
Transports Parisiens), the métro has a total of 16 lines and more than
360 stations, making it likely that one is near your destination. The
métro is connected to the suburban commuter train, the Réseau
Express Régional (RER), which connects downtown Paris with its air-
ports and suburbs.
You can recognize a métro station either by an elegant Art Nouveau gate-
way reading Métropolitain or by a big yellow M sign. Unless otherwise
marked, all métro stations have a ticket booth, where a single ticket costs
1.45 ($2.40) or a group of ten tickets called a carnet (kar-nay) is 11
($18). You can buy them from an attendant or, in most stations, from a
machine. Every métro stop has maps of the system; you can get portable
maps by asking at a ticket booth for une carte (oon kart). Near the exits,
you can find a plan du quartier, a very detailed pictorial map of the streets
and buildings surrounding the station, with all exits marked. A good idea
is to consult the plan du quartier before you exit the system, especially at
very large stations. You may want to use a different exit to reach the other
side of a busy street or wind up closer to your destination.
Navigating the métro is easy, and you’ll be a pro in no time. Here’s what
you do.
1. Use the métro map on the inside front cover of this book to
figure out which station is closest to you.
For example, if you want to go to the Louvre and are in your hotel
in the Latin Quarter, say the Familia, check this book’s hotel listing
for its nearest métro station. That station, or your starting point, is
Jussieu. Look at the métro map on the Cheat Sheet at the front of
this book for the line containing the Jussieu station. (Each end of
the lines on the métro map is marked with the number of the line.)
The Jussieu station is on Line 7.
2. Look for your destination station.
Look for your destination station, in this case the Louvre. You see
that the Louvre has two stops: the Palais-Royal Musée du Louvre
station on Line 7 and the Louvre Rivoli station on Line 14. Choose
the Palais-Royal Musée du Louvre station, and you won’t have to
change trains.
3. Enter the métro system through a turnstile with two ticket slots.
With the magnetic strip facing down, insert your ticket into the
nearer slot. Your ticket pops out of the second slot. Remove it, and
Part III: Settling into Paris 
92

either walk through a set of rubberized doors that briskly open on
each side or push through a turnstile.
Keep your ticket with you until you exit the station. At any point
while you’re in the métro, an inspector may ask to see your ticket
again. If you fail to produce it, you may have to pay a steep fine.
When you ride the RER, or suburban rail, you must keep your ticket
because you have to insert it into a turnstile when you exit the 
station.
4. Make sure you’re going in the right direction.
When you’re past the entrance, look at your subway map and trace
the line past your destination to its end. The station’s name at the
end of the line is the name of the subway train on which you’ll be
traveling; in the case of Line 7 the train is La Corneuve. To get back
to your hotel from the Louvre, you take the train going in the oppo-
site direction, marked Villejuif Louis Aragon and exit at the Jussieu
station.
5. Enter the train and exit at the station you want.
Blue signs reading Sortie mark all exits.
It’s pretty easy. Suppose, however, that the métro line nearest to you
doesn’t directly go to your destination. For example, you want to go to
the Arc de Triomphe from Jussieu, and the stop is Charles de Gaulle-
Étoile. Find the Charles de Gaulle-Étoile stop on the métro map. You see
that you can reach Charles de Gaulle-Étoile on Line 6 or Line 1. But
you’re on Line 7. You have to change trains. Changing trains is called a
correspondance, or transfer.
To make a transfer (correspondance), follow these steps.
1. Figure out which transfer station you need.
On your map, blank white circles indicate where a number of lines
intersect. These circles denote transfer stations, where you can
change subway trains.
To figure out where you need to change from the 7 train to Line 1 or
Line 6 (to get from Jussieu to the Arc de Triomphe), use the map to
see where Line 7 intersects with Line 1 and with Line 6. Line 7 and
Line 6 intersect at Stalingrad, opposite from where you want to go.
But Line 7 and Line 1 intersect at Concorde, very close to Charles
de Gaulle-Étoile. This is the train you want to take. To make sure
you go in the right direction on Line 1, look on your map for the
name of the station at the very end past Charles de Gaulle-Étoile.
It’s called Grande Arche de la Défense, and this is the name of the
train you want to ride.
2. Look for a bright orange Correspondance sign above the plat-
form at the transfer station.
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 93

Beneath it is a white sign that has the number of the line you can
transfer to in a circle (in the example, Line 1).
3. Follow the direction the sign indicates for the line you want.
You eventually come to two stairwells leading to the platforms.
Navy blue signs mark this area, indicating the train’s direction and
listing all the stops the train makes. Make sure you choose the
stairwell leading to the train going in the direction you want — in
the example, you want the train to Grande Arche de la Défense, so
that you can exit at Charles de Gaulle-Étoile.
The distances between platforms at the correspondance (transfer) sta-
tions can be very long. You may climb stairs, walk a short distance, only
to descend stairs to walk some more. Châtelet is particularly long. Some
lines are connected by moving sidewalks that seem to do nothing but
make a very long walk a little less long. For those with limited mobility,
take the bus or a cab.
The métro connects with the suburban commuter train, the RER, in sev-
eral stations in the city. The RER operates on a zone fare system, but
métro tickets are valid on it in the city. You probably won’t go past the
first two zones, unless you visit Disneyland on the A4 or Versailles on
the C5. When you ride the RER, keep your ticket because you need to
insert it into a turnstile to leave the station.
The doors on most métro cars don’t open automatically. You must lift a
door handle or press a button to get on and off.
Anyone who has ever been crushed on a Paris subway at rush hour can
attest that commuters don’t easily give up their places. If you step out of
the train to let someone off, you may just be giving others on the platform
the chance to squeeze in before you. Be polite, but stand your ground.
After the subway shuts down around 1 a.m., the RATP operates
Noctambuses that run on the hour from 1:30 a.m. to 5:30 a.m. from
Châtelet-Hôtel de Ville, but they don’t cover every arrondissement.
Check the maps at the entrance to métro stations to determine if a
Noctambus services your destination. The bus has a distinctive yellow-
and-black owl symbol, and tickets cost 2.70 ($3.10).
A ten-ticket carnet good for the métro and on buses is a good deal for
11 ($18) because a single ticket costs 1.45 ($2.40). You can purchase
a carnet at all métro stations as well as tabacs (cafes and kiosks that sell
tobacco products). The heavily publicized Paris Visite card offers free
or reduced entry to some minor attractions and free souvenirs from
others in addition to unlimited travel on métro and buses, but make sure
the attractions that interest you are included on the list (ask for it at the
ticket window first). Buy the Paris Visite (the regular pass covers zones
1 through 3, which include all of central Paris and many of its suburbs) if
you’re in Paris for only a day or two. At 8.50 ($14) for one day or 14
($22) for two days (kids 4–11 pay half price; kids under four ride free),
Part III: Settling into Paris 
94

it’s a good deal. However, the three-day 19 ($30) and the five-day 28
($44) Paris Visites are a waste of money. Instead, purchase the Carte
Orange (see below).
How long do you plan to be in Paris? If you plan to use public transporta-
tion frequently, consider buying the Carte Orange. It costs 16 ($26) for
zones 1 and 2 and 22 ($35) for zones 1 to 3. You’ll need to provide a
passport-size photo. Bring one from home or visit a photo booth at one
of the many Monoprix stores, major métro stations, department stores,
or train stations, where you can get four black-and-white pictures for
less than 5 ($8). Make sure you buy the weekly Carte Orange, called
coupon hebdomadaire (koo-poh eb-doh-muh-dare) and not the monthly
coupon mensuel (koo-poh men-soo-ell). The card is valid Monday
through Sunday and on sale Monday through Wednesday of the same
week, and Friday through Sunday for the following week.
The weekly passes don’t last exactly seven days from the date of pur-
chase; they begin Monday mornings and end Sunday night. So if you pay
for a full weekly pass on Saturday, it will only last two full days and you
won’t get your money’s worth. Don’t buy the Carte Orange hebdomidaire
if you find yourself in Paris toward the end of the week.
Paris l’Open Tour is good for one or two days of unlimited travel around
Paris on special open-air buses. It offers three hop-on/hop-off routes for
29 ($46) for a one-day pass and or 32 ($51) for a two-day ticket. Use
your Paris Visite card to get the one-day ticket for 22 ($35).
For more information on the city’s public transportation, call the RATP’s
English information line (% 08-92-69-32-46 or 08-92-68-41-14 [.35/55¢
per minute]; www.ratp.fr).
By bus
The bus system is convenient and can be an inexpensive way to sightsee
without wearing out your feet. Most Parisian buses run from 6:30 a.m. to
8:30 p.m.; a few run until 12:30 a.m. Each bus shelter has a route map,
which you want to check carefully. Because of the number of one-way
streets, the bus is likely to make different stops depending on its direc-
tion. Main stops are written on the side of the buses with the endpoint
shown on the front above the driver. Furthermore, the back of every bus
shelter has posted large bus maps and smaller maps inside the shelter
showing the specific bus route. Métro tickets are valid for bus travel,
and although you can buy single tickets from the conductor, you can’t
buy ticket packages (carnets) on the bus.
Board at the front of the bus. If you have a single-trip ticket, insert it 
into the slot in the small machine right behind the driver. The machine
punches your ticket and pops it back out. If you have a pass, show it to
the driver. To get off at the next stop, press one of the red buttons on the
safety poles; the arrêt demandé (stop requested) sign above the driver
lights up.
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 95

The downside of taking the bus is that it often gets mired in heavy
Parisian traffic, so I don’t recommend it if you’re in a hurry. And, like the
métro, avoid the bus during rush hours when it seems le monde (the
world) is sharing the bus with you.
Bus routes great for sightseeing include:
 Bus 69: Eiffel Tower, Invalides, Louvre, Hôtel de Ville, place des
Vosges, Bastille, Père-Lachaise Cemetery
 Bus 80: Department stores on boulevard Haussmann, Champs-
Elysées, avenue Montaigne haute couture shopping, Eiffel Tower
 Bus 96: St-Germain-des-Prés, Musée de Cluny, Hôtel de Ville, place
des Vosges
By taxi
You have three ways to get a taxi in Paris, and I rank them in order of
how successful they are.
 The best way to find a cab is by phoning Alpha Taxis (% 01-53 60
63 50) or Taxis G7 (% 01-47-39-47-39). Keep in mind, however, that
phoning ahead is more expensive because the meter starts running
as soon as the driver commences the journey to get you.
 You can also wait at a taxi stand (station de taxis) marked by a blue
Taxi sign. Depending on the time of day, however, you may wait in a
long line of people, or a very limited number of cabs stop.
 Finally, you can hail a cab, as long as you’re not within 60m (200
ft.) of a taxi stand. Look for a taxi with its white light illuminated,
which means the cab is available. An orange light means the cab is
occupied or on the way to a pickup. You may get a cab driver who
refuses to take you to your destination; by law, a driver can do this

Keeping the picks out of your pockets
Over the past few years, petty crime has been making a comeback in Paris, a city that
is otherwise relatively safe. Anywhere you find a high concentration of tourists, you
also find pickpockets — including in the métro, hovering around the lines outside the
Eiffel Tower and Notre-Dame, and in the church and its bell tower. Keep an eye out
for little bands of scruffy children, who often surround you, distract you, and make off
with your belongings.
Your best bet is to use common sense. Be aware of the people around you at all times.
Get a money belt. Women wear purses diagonally across the body with the flap facing
the body. Make sure zipper purses are closed at all times. (In fact, zippered purses
aren’t recommended.) See Chapter 4 for what to do if you get pickpocketed.

only during his or her last half-hour at work. Be prepared, as well,
for the selective vision of drivers, especially when you hail a cab.
Don’t be surprised to see a free taxi or two pass you by.
The initial fare for up to three passengers is 2.20 ($3.50) and rises .85
($1.35) for each kilometer between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. Between 5 p.m.
and 10 a.m., the standing charge remains the same, but the per-kilometer
charge rises to 1.10 ($1.80). An additional fee of 1 ($1.60) is imposed
for luggage weighing more than 5kg (11 lb.) or for an extra bag. A fourth
passenger incurs a 2.85 ($4.55) charge. Common practice is to tip your
driver 10 percent to 15 percent on longer journeys when the fare
exceeds 15 ($24); otherwise round up the charge and give the driver
the change.
By car
Streets are narrow, parking is next to impossible, and nerve, skill, ruth-
lessness, and a knowledgeable copilot are required if you insist on driv-
ing in Paris. I strongly recommend that you don’t. (If you must drive in
Paris, do it in Aug when residents are away on vacation, and traffic is
lighter.)
A few tips: Get an excellent street map and ride with another person;
traffic moves so lightning-fast you don’t have time to think at intersec-
tions. You must pay to park Monday to Saturday, 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Parking
is free on Sundays and public holidays; during August certain streets
offer free parking (look for yellow stickers on the parking meters). Street
parking is limited to two hours and fees start at 1 ($1.60) an hour on
Paris’s outskirts, to 3 ($4.80) in central Paris. Note that meters do not
accept coins and only take the Paris Carte card, available in tabacs for
10 ($16) to 30 ($48). After inserting the Paris Carte, the meter issues
a ticket to be placed on the windshield.
Drivers and all passengers must wear seat belts. Children under 12 must
ride in the back seat. Drivers are supposed to yield to the car on the
right, except where signs indicate otherwise, as at traffic circles.
Watch for the gendarmes (police officers), who lack patience and who
consistently contradict the traffic lights. Horn blowing is frowned upon
except in emergencies. Flash your headlights instead.
By bicycle
The banks of the Seine are closed to cars and open to pedestrians and
cyclists March to November each Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. It may
not make much of a dent in the air quality, but bicycling is a fun and
healthy way to spend a Sunday afternoon.
Paris Mayor Bertrand Delanoe scored a huge hit in 2007 with the intro-
duction of Velib’, the low-cost bike rental program. Over 20,000 bikes are
available for as little as 1 per hour ($1.60) in an effort to encourage
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 97

more cycling and less pollution. Bike rental stands are located all over
the city, pedallers use a credit card or buy a Velib’ pass to rent the bikes
which can be returned to any stand around the city. The Paris Respire
(Paris Breathes) campaign shuts off certain streets every Sunday all year
long for bikers, runners, strollers, and inline skaters. The main routes
run north-south from the Bassin de La Villette along the Canal St-Martin
through the Left Bank and east-west from Château de Vincennes to the
Bois de Boulogne and its miles of bike lanes.
For more information and a bike map, pick up the Plan Vert from the
tourist office. (For bike tours of the city, see Chapter 11.)
Paris à pied (on foot)
Paris is one of the prettiest cities in the world for strolling, and getting
around on foot is probably the best way to really appreciate the city’s
character. The best walking neighborhoods are St-Germain-des-Prés on
the Left Bank and the Marais on the Right Bank, both of which are filled
with romantic little courtyards, wonderful boutiques, and congenial
cafes and watering holes. The quays of the Seine, as well as its bridges,
are also lovely, especially at sunset when the sun fills the sky with a pink
glow that’s reflected on the water. And try not to miss the pretty Canal
St-Martin with its arched bridges and locks in the 10e, featured in the
movies Amélie and Hôtel du Nord or the tiny streets off the Montmartre
butte (hill).
Take special care when crossing streets, even when you have the right 
of way. The number-one rule of the road in France is that whoever is
coming from the right side has the right of way. Drivers often make right
turns without looking, even when faced with pedestrians at crosswalks.
And don’t ever attempt to cross a traffic circle if you’re not on a cross-
walk. The larger roundabouts, such as the one at the Arc de Triomphe,
have pedestrian tunnels.

P
art of the fun of traveling is waking up in a new place with unlimited
opportunities for exploring! If this is your first trip to Paris, your
expectations about what a hotel room should look like may be based on
what you have seen in your own country. For those visiting from North
America, one important thing to know is that rooms in Paris tend to be
on the smaller side, even in expensive places (unless you opt for a
modern chain hotel, which can lack charm, or ultra-deluxe lodgings).
Parisian doubles are almost never big enough to hold two queen-size
beds, and the space around the bed usually isn’t big enough for more
than a desk and perhaps a chest of drawers. The story is the same in
London, Rome, and most other continental capitals where buildings date
back two, three, four, or more centuries, when everything was smaller.
Parisian hotels also vary widely in their plumbing arrangements. Some
units come equipped with only a sink; others may also have a toilet and
either a shower or tub. Private bathrooms with tubs often have hand-
held shower devices, and some shower stalls don’t have curtains (the
water often drains into a grate in the floor). The trend is toward renovat-
ing small hotels by installing a small shower, toilet, and sink in each
room, but don’t count on having all these amenities in your room unless
you’re in a pricier hotel.
Acoustics tend to be unpredictable in old Parisian hotels. Your quarrel-
ing neighbors may compete with street noise for the prize of most
annoying, so bring earplugs for the neighbors, or ask for a room in the
rear of the hotel to avoid the street noise. Another point to remember:
Most budget hotels in Paris don’t have air-conditioning, so consider this
if you’re visiting in July or August.

Getting to Know Your Options
More than 2,200 hotels are located in Paris — chain hotels, deluxe
palacelike accommodations, hotels that cater to business travelers,
budget hotels, and mom-and-pop establishments.
The French government grades hotels with a star system, ranging from
one star for a simple motel or inn to four stars for a deluxe hotel.
Moderately priced hotels usually get two or three stars. This system is
based on a complex formula of room sizes, facilities, plumbing, eleva-
tors, dining options, renovations, and so on.
To find the hotel that’s right for you, you need to weigh five variables:
price, location, room size, amenities, and — the least tangible, but per-
haps most desired of them all — a charming Parisian ambience. If the
first variable, price, poses no problem, then you can have it all: great
location, huge room, super perks, and sumptuous surroundings. Most
travelers, however, need to make some compromises.
Before committing to a hotel, keep in mind that Paris offers additional
options for lodging — renting an apartment, for example. Nothing beats
living in Paris as a Parisian. In your own apartment, you can cook with
fresh and unusual ingredients from the local green markets, taste fine
wines that would be too expensive in a restaurant, and entertain new
friends. Although the daily rate can be higher than a budget hotel, the
room will be larger, you can save money on meals, and in the end, you
may end up paying the same rate you would for room and board at a
hotel — or less.
The most practical way to rent an apartment is through an agency. Most
agencies require a seven-day minimum stay and offer discounts for
longer stays. I’ve found that apartments vary quite a bit in size, location,
and amenities. At the bottom end — for about 100 ($160) per day —
you’ll find yourself in either a small, centrally located studio, or a larger
studio in a neighborhood a bit far from the center of Paris. Studio apart-
ments usually feature a convertible couch; an armchair or two; a bath-
room with a tub or shower; and a tiny kitchenette with a refrigerator,
stove, coffeemaker, and maybe a microwave. Dishes, cutlery, pots and
pans, telephone, TV, iron, vacuum cleaner, linens, and sometimes a
washing machine are also provided. Pay a bit more — around 200
($320) per day — and you get a more centrally located one-bedroom
apartment. As with anything else, higher prices pay for larger, more luxu-
rious spaces.
You can find many rental agencies online and comparison shop among
them. Companies offering attractive apartments at reasonable prices are
Apartment Living in Paris (www.apartment-living.com) which, at
press time, advertised a 135m (450-ft.) two-room rental in the Latin
Quarter for 100 ($160) a night, and Lodgis Solutions (www.lodgis.com),
Part III: Settling into Paris 
100

which also rents apartments in New York, the French Riviera, and
Marrakech, and at press time advertised a stylish one-bedroom in the
upscale fourth for 750 a week ($1,200). Paris Vacation Rentals (www.
rentals-paris.com) is an agency that deals in short-term rental of
upscale apartments at very good prices (a good-sized one bedroom near
the Louvre was renting for 1,000/$1,600 a week). A little more expen-
sive is New York Habitats (www.newyorkhabitat.com), a New York real
estate brokerage that rents flats in Paris and elsewhere as a sideline (a
cozy Marais studio was renting for 370/$590 per week). Check out
Bonjour Paris (www.bonjourparis.com) for reviews and information
about apartment rental agencies.
Keep in mind that this is a short-term apartment rental. You have to sign
a contract and put down a security deposit, which may not be refunded
if you damage the apartment in any way.
If the agency offers optional gift baskets or transportation to and from
the airport, refuse them. The gift basket usually contains items you can
buy more cheaply at the grocery store, and the transportation is usually
twice as much as a cab.
If you bring the kids with you to Paris, your best option may be the
aparthotel, a hybrid between an apartment and a hotel where you can
have the autonomy of an apartment with some of the amenities of a
hotel. You book an aparthotel just like you do any other hotel, through
its Web site or phone number. And, like hotels, they have 24-hour recep-
tion desks, satellite TV, housekeeping services, kitchenettes, and laun-
dry. For a family of four, a one-bedroom apartment is a good-value
alternative to two double rooms in a cheap hotel. And if you use your
kitchenette to prepare even half of your own meals in Paris, you can
reap huge savings on your dining bill.
If you don’t mind opening your house or apartment to others during
your vacation, you might find that an apartment swap is your best bet.
Several agencies will work with you for a small fee to advertise your resi-
dence and find a place for you to stay abroad. Check out Home Xchange
Vacation (www.homexchangevacation.com) or Home Base Holidays
(www.homebase-hols.com). It’s almost always better to do an apart-
ment swap through an agency which screens members so that you are
protected from problems.
Finding the Best Room at the Best Rate
The rack rate is the maximum rate a hotel charges for a room. It’s the
rate you get if you walk in off the street and ask for a room for the night.
But you often don’t have to pay it! This section gives tips on finding the
best rooms in Paris at the best rate.
Chapter 9: Checking in at Paris’s Best Hotels 101

Finding the best rate
At chain hotels (especially the American ones) and other luxury hotels,
you can often get a good deal simply by asking for a discounted rate.
Your odds of getting a reduced rate improve drastically if you’re staying
for more than a few nights.
Keep in mind that bartering for a cheaper room isn’t the norm at Paris’s
budget hotels. Small and privately owned, owners post their rates in the
reception area and are not willing to negotiate. To be fair, they may not
be able to afford to let rooms go for less.
Room rates change with the seasons as occupancy rates rise and fall. In
Paris, summer is low season. Yes, you’re reading that correctly: Room
rates tend to be lower in July and August, which is typically when the
French flee the big cities for the beaches and the mountains. November
and December are also low season, but early fall is high season, with
October, in particular, heavy with conventioneers, making it difficult to
find a room. If a hotel is close to full, it’s less likely to extend discount
rates.
Prices for the hotels recommended here are designated with dollar
signs; Table 9-1 explains how this works. In a nutshell, the more dollar
signs you see, the more expensive the hotel. The number of dollar signs
corresponds to the hotel’s rack rates (full rate), from the cheapest
double room in low season to the most expensive in high season. The
most noticeable difference between budget hotels and the most expen-
sive hotels is better amenities and services, followed by a more luxuri-
ous décor. None of the recommended hotels listed in this chapter is a
dump; the places are decent and reputable. Naturally, the luxury level in
a 1,000 ($1,200) room is substantially higher than in a 100 one ($160).

Room prices are subject to change without notice, so the rates quoted in
this book may be different from the actual rate you receive when you
make your reservation. Be sure to mention membership in AAA, AARP,
frequent-flier programs, and any other corporate rewards programs you
belong to when making your reservation at a chain hotel. You never
know when it may be worth a few dollars off your room rate. Family-run
establishments rarely have arrangements with large organizations.
Keep this advice in mind when you’re trying to save money on a room.
 A travel agent may be able to negotiate a better price at top hotels
than you can get yourself. (The hotel gives the agent a discount for
steering business its way.)
 Always ask if the hotel offers any weekend specials, which typi-
cally require you to stay two nights (either Fri–Sat or Sat–Sun). In
Paris, you can find this kind of deal from September through March
at almost all price levels.
 A forfait (fohr-feh) is a discount that requires you to stay a certain
number of nights — perhaps a minimum of three or five. Sometimes
something else is thrown in (like a bottle of champagne) to sweeten
the deal. If you’re going to be in Paris for more than three days,
always ask if there’s a forfait, and then pick the hotel with the best
deal.
 Don’t forget about package deals (see Chapter 5) that include air-
fare, hotel, and transportation to and from the airport.
 Look on the Internet for deals (see below).
Chapter 9: Checking in at Paris’s Best Hotels 103

Surfing the Web for hotel deals
Although the major travel booking sites (such as Travelocity, Orbitz,
Expedia, and Cheap Tickets; see Chapter 5 for details) offer hotel book-
ing, using a site devoted primarily to lodging can be best because you
may find properties that aren’t listed on more general online travel agen-
cies. The Paris Convention and Visitors Bureau (www.parisinfo.com)
gives detailed information on hotels and other lodging they sanction and
provides links to accommodations reservation centers (but the Web site
doesn’t tell you about special rates). Some lodging sites specialize in a
particular type of accommodation, such as bed-and-breakfast accommo-
dations, which you won’t find on the more mainstream booking services.
Others offer weekend deals on major chain properties that cater to busi-
ness travelers and have more empty rooms on weekends. And finally,
some individual hotels will offer an “Internet bonus” for a reservation
made on their personal Web site. Therefore, checking out some of the
online lodging sites, many of which offer discounts, is in your best 
interest.
Hotel Discounts (www.hoteldiscounts.com) offers bargain room rates
at hotels in more than two dozen U.S. and international cities. The serv-
ice prebooks blocks of rooms in advance, so sometimes it has rooms —
at discount rates — at hotels that otherwise are considered sold out.
TravelWeb (www.travelweb.com) lists more than 16,000 hotels world-
wide, focusing on chains such as Hyatt and Hilton, and you can book
almost 90 percent of these online. France Hotels Online (www.france-
hotel-online.com) offers detailed listings of independent hotels,
apartments, and bed-and-breakfasts according to budget and neighbor-
hood. All Hotels (www.all-hotels.com) lists 140,000 lodgings through-
out the world. (The hotels on this site pay a fee to be listed.) Places to
Stay (www.placestostay.com) lists inns, B&Bs, resorts, hotels, and
properties you may not find anywhere else. Hostelworld (www.hostel
world.com) lists youth hostels and cheap hotel deals in Paris and major
cities around the world and offers ratings written by former clients of
the various accommodations. Budget travelers can find excellent deals
here.
Arriving Without a Reservation
If you arrive in Paris without a reservation, you have two choices. You
can pick up a phone and start dialing (after you purchase a phone card
for public phones at the nearest tabac, a cafe or kiosk that sells tobacco
products). Or you can walk into one of the branches of the Paris Con-
vention and Visitors Bureau and let the multilingual staff make you a
reservation. The main switchboard for any branch is % 08-92-68-30-00
(.35/55¢ per minute). Only the staff at three of the office’s six branches
offer reservations services, so call before you go. (Note: These centers
are closed on May 1 and Dec 25.)

 The Anvers welcome center, on the median strip facing 72 bd.
Rochechouart; open daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (Métro: Anvers)
 The welcome kiosk beneath the modern glass roofed terminal of
the Gare du Nord, 18 rue Dunkerque, 10e; open daily from 8 a.m. to
6 p.m. (Métro and RER: Gare du Nord
 The welcome kiosk at the Gare de Lyon, 20 bd. Diderot, 12e; open
Monday through Saturday 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. (Métro and RER: Gare de
Lyon)
Hotels with unsold rooms offer them through the Paris Convention and
Visitors Bureau at rock-bottom prices, so you may get a three-star hotel
at a two-star price. The staff will make a reservation for you on the same
day that you want a room, free of charge, but it must be on a credit card
or check card (which will act as a credit card while in a foreign country).
Note that during the summer season, you’ll have to wait in a long line,
and you aren’t guaranteed a room.
Paris’s Best Hotels
The thousands of hotels in Paris range from small alcove singles in his-
toric buildings to the historic and palatial that anticipate a traveler’s
every need. But only around 50 are described here. The reason? You
don’t need an overwhelming, encyclopedic list of all the hotels, just ones
that are right for you, and an equally right backup in case your first
choice is booked solid. In compiling this list, the first step was consider-
ing the typical traveler’s wish list. And for most of you, the main priority
is location. Thus, the first criterion, though ruthless, was simple. If a
hotel isn’t located in the first eight arrondissements, it isn’t recom-
mended in this book.
The second concern was price. The most expensive category listed here,
$$$$, contains hotels that cost more than 300 ($480) a night, which is
expensive by nearly anyone’s standards. Only a few hotels described
here fall into the $$$$ category because most travelers are on a budget.
(For a complete rundown on the $ system, see Table 9-1.) Three-quarters
of the hotels in this chapter rent doubles for less than 150 ($240) night
but nevertheless give you comfort, some nice amenities, and that frisson
of Parisian character for which the city’s hotels are known. And none of
the hotels listed here is a dive.
Finally, a variety of neighborhoods between the first and eighth
arrondissements is represented here with a nice range of styles from
conservative to trendy. The aim? I want to make sure that everyone is
accounted for, regardless of budget, taste, or style of travel.
In this chapter, two maps pinpoint the locations of the hotels: “Hotels in
the Heart of the Right Bank” and “Hotels in the Heart of the Left Bank.”
Reviews are arranged alphabetically for easy reference. Hotels that are

especially good for families are designated with the kid-friendly icon.
Listed immediately beneath the name of the hotel is the neighborhood in
which it’s located and the number of dollar signs corresponding to the
hotel’s rack rates, from the cheapest double room in low season to the
most expensive in high season. At chapter’s end are indexes of accom-
modations by price and neighborhood for easy reference.
Almost all hotels serve breakfast in some form. Note that a normal petit
déjeuner (breakfast), also referred to as continental, will usually include
coffee or tea, juice, a croissant, pain au chocolat (a croissant with a thin
thread of chocolate filling) or similar pastry, and toast with various confi-
tures (jams). If a hotel also offers un petit déjeuner Américain (American
breakfast), it means they offer a buffet with eggs and meats — but you
will pay for it.
Castex Hôtel
$$
Le Marais (4e)
The Castex is a popular budget classic, near everything in the eastern part
of the Marais and the staff is friendly. Each large room has a writing table
or a desk and chair; some have views overlooking the courtyard. The
entryway opens onto to a wide and comfortable wood-beamed lobby with
newspapers and seating for guests. Rooms have televisions, some are also
wood-beamed. Reserve at least a month in advance. The rue St-Antoine is
a half-block away and offers some good cheap shopping and a variety of
places to eat.
See map p.106. 5 rue Castex. % 01-42-72-31-52. Fax: 01-42-72-57-91. www.castex-

Citadines Les Halles Aparthotel
$$–$$$
Louvre (1er)
Staying here is like living in your own quiet high-rise apartment in the
middle of Paris. With more than 85 rooms, visitors can choose from stu-
dios and one-bedrooms that have fully equipped kitchenettes, and serv-
ices include a 24-hour reception desk, satellite TV, air-conditioning, house-
keeping, baby-equipment rental, and laundry facilities. Located in the
middle of a large pedestrian zone, this neighborhood is a bit dicey late at
night, so if you’re a single traveler, this hotel may not be the best bet.
See map p. 106. 4 rue des Innocents (91m/299 ft. from the Forum des Halles). % 01-

Citadines Louvre Aparthotel
$$$
Louvre (1er)
This seven-story aparthotel is in a terrific location in an upscale and pretty
neighborhood just opposite the Comédie-Française and next to the Jardin
du Palais-Royal. Once a students’ residence, it has several studios (each
with a double fold-out sofa) and apartments equipped for travelers with
disabilities. Studios and one-bedrooms (a separate bedroom with two
single beds and pull-out double sofa) have fully equipped kitchenettes,
and services include a 24-hour reception desk, satellite TV, air-conditioning,
housekeeping, baby-equipment rental, and laundry facilities. Book well in
advance.

Citadines Paris Opéra-Grands Boulevards Aparthotel
$$$–$$$$
Opéra (2e)
Around the corner from the Opéra Comique, the Musée Jacquemart-André,
and the Comédie-Française and near the Grands Boulevards, this five-story
aparthotel is the most central in the Citadines chain. It’s located in a 
peaceful passage, and rooms come with fully equipped kitchenettes; avail-
able services include a 24-hour reception desk, satellite TV, Internet, air-
conditioning, baby-equipment rental, dry cleaning, laundry facilities, house-
keeping, bar, billiard table, and fitness center. A one-bedroom apartment
here (two single beds in the bedroom, a double pull-out couch) can be a
good alternative to renting two rooms in a cheap hotel because cooking in
the kitchenette saves on your dining costs.

Familia Hôtel
$–$$
Latin Quarter (5e)
This hotel has many repeat visitors and no wonder — the rooms have been
painstakingly restored with either provincial-inspired wallpaper or frescoes
painted by students from l’École des Beaux-Arts (Paris’s best art school).
The cozy lobby exudes the atmosphere of a tiny castle with rich tapestries,
a winding staircase, and frescoed walls. Some rooms have balconies (num-
bers 22, 23, 52, 53, 61, 62, 65) with captivating views of the Latin Quarter.
From the fifth and sixth floors, you can see Notre-Dame. Bathrooms are
small but modern and tiled. All rooms have cable TV and hair dryers. The
staff provides kid-friendly services (such as bottle heating) and larger
rooms for the weary traveler who requests ahead. Take note that most
rooms in the hotel are on the small side, and the least expensive doubles

can get hot in Paris heat waves.

Four Seasons George V
$$$$
Champs-Elysées (8e)
This is one of Paris’s truly legendary palace hotels combining the old
(Murano chandeliers and Louis XIV tapestries) with a sleek, light-wood-
and-marble lobby opening onto an outside marble courtyard decorated
with bright blue awnings and umbrellas. A team of concierges greet guests
staying in 245 large rooms, separated from the public corridors by their
own hallways for more peace and quiet. Louis XVI–style furniture, marble
bathrooms, stereo systems, DVD players, and wireless Internet access are
the norm. The Honeymoon Suite has three terraces, and other suites offer
a stone’s-throw view of the Eiffel Tower — some from their bathtubs.
Amenities include the signature Four Season mattresses (930 coils instead
of the industry-standard 800), a spa (with its own elevator) offering 24-
hour massages and a huge pool, an American bar, and multi-starred restau-
rant, Le Cinq (reviewed in Chapter 10). Check online for package deals.

Grand Hôtel des Balcons
$$–$$$
St-Germain-des-Prés (6e)
Steps from Théâtre de l’Odéon is this gracious and comfortable hotel with
balconied rooms, modern light oak furnishings, bright fabrics, 19th-
century stained-glass windows, and Art Nouveau lobby furnishings (look
for the voluptuous statue of Venus in the breakfast room). Although most
rooms and their wrought-iron balconies are small and basic, clever use of
space allows for full-length mirrors and some rooms have closets on the
larger side. Bathrooms are small to miniscule but well-designed. The
higher-priced doubles, triples, and quads are bigger and luxurious; some
have double-sink bathrooms. All rooms have satellite television and
Internet access. If you opt to have breakfast here, it’s a sumptuous and fill-
ing breakfast buffet. The Jardin du Luxembourg is a five-minute walk south.

Grand Hôtel Lévêque
$
Eiffel Tower (7e)
This 1930s-era hotel is just three blocks from the Eiffel Tower on a color-
ful pedestrian street bustling with the rue Cler market, bakeries, restau-
rants, a terrific crêpe stand, wine shops, and florists. The newly renovated
lobby has a comfortable lounge area with a bar and fireplace and a brand-
new breakfast room The snug rooms have new chic décor with small bath-
rooms in excellent condition, satellite TV, hair dryer, Internet access, and
ceiling fan. Staff members are very friendly and helpful, and if you ask, they
may be able to give you a higher-priced room on the fifth floor with a bal-
cony and partial view of the Eiffel Tower. This hotel fills up fast, so book
well in advance. Street-side rooms (which have good views) cost a little
more than interior rooms; as always, check online for deals. Note: At press
time, staff reported that the hotel was about to be wired for Wi-Fi.

Hôtel Agora
$–$$
Louvre (1er)
This is a very good find on a busy pedestrian street near Les Halles and has
a traditional French air once you mount a curved staircase (after the ini-
tial climb, an elevator leads from reception to upper floors) to its eclectic
reception area. Rooms have antique furniture, marble mantelpieces, floral
prints, and old-fashioned wallpapers. If you want a room on the larger side,
ask for 1, 2, or 6. The windows are double-glazed, thankfully, which helps
muffle the outside noise. The bathrooms are decently sized; some have
bathtubs and even bidets, an often confusing French charm, which is
rarely offered at hotels with such reasonable prices. Fifth-floor rooms have
balconies with views of the impressive St-Eustache Church.

Hôtel Alison
$$
Madeleine (8e)
This hotel has a retro 1970s ambience that somehow manages to be per-
fectly in tune with the classy neighborhood. The large, well-appointed
rooms are furnished in modern style, with black furniture and light walls,
and have plenty of storage space, a safe, minibar, trouser press, satellite
TV, Internet access, and double-glazed windows. Hair dryers and upscale
toiletries grace gleaming, tiled bathrooms with wall-mounted showers. You
can relax on low, orange-leather couches in the plush lobby or enjoy a

Hôtel Amélie
$
Eiffel Tower (7e)
This is a modest 16-room hotel bedecked with overflowing flower pots at
each window. The rooms are small and basic with tiny closets, writing desks,
minibars, and a downscale décor, but the tiled bathrooms offer hair dryers
and good-quality toiletries. The location is excellent for seeing such seventh
arrondissement sights as the Eiffel Tower and Napoléon’s Tomb, yet the
atmosphere is peaceful, almost serene. Stroll down nearby rue Cler for some
great fruit and veggie markets or for an expert crêpe made by a lovely Greek
vendeur who has been there for years. There is no elevator. The owners
often have seasonal promotions; check the Web site for specials.

Hôtel Balzac

Champs-Elysées (8e)
Just one quiet street from the Arc de Triomphe is this gorgeous jewel box
of a hotel. Luxuriously renovated for 11 million in 2007, this is the place
to stay if you want all the amenities of a palace hotel in a more intimate set-
ting. Enjoy butler service; a bar, lounge, and tearoom; 24-hour room serv-
ice; Molton Brown toiletries; in-room entertainment systems that include 
a wall mounted flatscreen TV, CD, and DVD player; ADSL and Wi-Fi; mini-
bar; thick high-quality duvets and high-thread-count linens. The 278-sq.-m
(3,000-sq.-ft.) Suite Royale (2,500/$3,137) is the hotel’s best, with its own
265m (883-ft.) terrace where one can dine with a beautiful view of the Eiffel
Tower and soak in a Jacuzzi bath after a busy day of sightseeing.

Hôtel Claude-Bernard

Latin Quarter (5e)
This is one of my highly recommended hotels because it keeps very high
standards while keeping costs down. The inside features a lobby bar (but

it’s not manned by a regular bartender; you have to ask at reception if you
want to be served), a lounge area with comfortable banquettes, and a two-
person elevator. The decently sized rooms have warm and tasteful wall-
paper, sleek bathrooms, minibars, Wi-Fi, satellite TV, decorative balconies
with flowers, and often a well-preserved piece of antique furniture. Some
particularly attractive suites come with couches and armchairs. A sauna
is available for guests to use, and all rooms are air-conditioned. Nearby
are the Panthéon, the Sorbonne, and the fantastic Cluny Museum. Check
the Web site for promotions.

but comfortable, and all are furnished in a modern or classic style 
with such touches as fresh flowers, pretty gingham curtains, and wood-
paneled accents. Book at least six weeks in advance for one of the cham-
bres familiales — two connecting rooms with two large beds in each room.
Continental breakfast is served in the cozy vaulted stone cellar dining
room; the homemade jams are sure to please. Located near the church of
St-Germain-des-Prés, the historic Café de Flore, Les Deux Magots, and
Brasserie Lipp, it’s also a few blocks from the Seine and the Jardin du
Luxembourg. Check the Web site for specials.

Hôtel de l’Abbaye Saint-Germain
$$$–$$$$
St-Germain-des-Prés (6e)
This former convent on the Left Bank is a wonderful choice for travelers
who aren’t willing to spend deluxe hotel prices but still want elegance,
tranquillity, and deluxe-quality service. Some of the 42 rooms and two- and
four-bedroom suites have their original exposed oak ceiling beams, 19th-
century-style furnishings, and damask upholstery; all are air-conditioned,
with hair dryers and satellite TV. The rooms are a good size by Paris stan-
dards, and the suites are absolutely spacious. The style of décor is modern
with funky bedspreads and framed drawings and prints of famous Andy
Warhol creations. Some first-floor rooms open onto a vine-covered terrace.
Rooftop suites also have terraces, and there is one fabulous duplex terrific

Hôtel de la Place des Vosges
$$–$$
Le Marais (4e)
The entrance to the place des Vosges is only steps away from this hotel
which used to be the stables of King Henri IV. Now the exposed stone walls
and beamed ceilings complement a somewhat dark and dusty, antiques-
filled lobby. The small rooms have beamed ceilings, satin-cotton blend bed
sheets with anti-allergen spreads, and tiled bathrooms. All rooms have
satellite TVs, free Wi-Fi, safes, desks, and hair dryers, but there is a lack of
storage space. The larger top-floor room (no. 10) has a pretty view over
the Right Bank and a Jacuzzi, but the elevator stops a floor down, which
is a consideration if you have a lot of luggage.

Hôtel de L’Elysée
$$$
Champs-Elysées (8e)
The Costes brothers bought this hotel in 2007, and at press time, hotel
staff said everything was “up in the air.” When I visited, I saw rooms with
patterned wallpaper, built-in closets, half-headboards, and stucco ceilings.
The wonderful, but small mansard suite no. 60 features wood beams over-
head and skylights set into the low, sloping ceilings that provide peek-a-
boo vistas of Parisian rooftops, including a perfectly framed view of the
Eiffel Tower. All fifth- and sixth-floor rooms enjoy at least rooftop views,
the former from small balconies (nos. 50–53 offer glimpses of the Eiffel
Tower). (Take note that there are 15 steep steps from where the elevator
stops to the top floor.) A pretty sitting room off the lobby welcomes guests
with a small bar and fireplace, arched ceilings and period reproduction
furniture give the hotel an air of charm.

Hôtel des Deux-Iles
$$$
Ile St-Louis (4e)
This appealing jewel box of a hotel is superbly located on the Ile St-Louis
(practically in Notre-Dame’s backyard). The owners are interior decorators,
and it shows; the 17 rooms have exposed oak ceiling beams and provincial
upholstery, and the lobby is a warm and cozy gem with fresh flowers and
bamboo furniture. Off the lobby is a rock garden that some of the rooms
overlook and a basement breakfast room with a fireplace. Although ameni-
ties include completely renovated bathrooms with hair dryers, cable TV,
Wi-Fi, minibars, and air-conditioning, rooms are small, so if you have a large
amount of luggage, you may want to look elsewhere. Paris’s best ice cream
shop, Berthillon (closed in Aug), is just around the corner, and you can find
Berthillon ice cream in neighborhood brasseries, too. So much is nearby —
the Memorial de la DéportationSainte-Chapelle; the Conciergerie; and the
bird and flower markets on Ile de la Cité, to name only a few — you may
not know where to begin, so start early in the morning with Notre-Dame.

St-Germain-des- Prés (6e)
The Hôtel de Seine is centrally located on a street full of art galleries in St-
Germain-des-Prés, between boulevard St-Germain and rue Jacob. It’s a few
blocks from the Seine and the pedestrian bridge Pont des Arts that leads
to the Louvre. Each room is distinctly decorated with either French provin-
cial furniture and flowered wallpaper or Provence-inspired jewel-toned
paint and Louis XVI reproductions. Rooms have satellite TV, marble bath-

Latin Quarter (5e)
Ask for rooms at the back of this hotel in a great Latin Quarter location;
those that face boulevard St-Michel are quite loud late into the night on
weekends. The rooms in this hotel are a good size, beds are firm, storage
space is ample, and the modern bathrooms have hair dryers. Décor is typ-
ical modern hotel: a comfortable mirrored lobby furnished with couches
and Art Nouveau lamps, rooms with striped or flowered bedspreads, and
curtains with color-coordinated artwork and blonde furniture. Each room
has satellite TV with numerous channels and Wi-Fi is available throughout
the building. The hotel is near Musée de Cluny, Jardin du Luxembourg, and
the Panthéon. The Seine and Notre-Dame are a ten-minute walk away.

Eiffel Tower (7e)
Canelle, the proprietors’ cocker spaniel, will welcome you to this 25-room
hotel that resembles a country house tucked away on a colorful street near
the Eiffel Tower. It’s also a terrific bargain. Rooms are decorated with flow-
ered drapes, fabric-covered headboards, throw pillows, and cushioned
high-backed seats, and each is unique. Along with the countryside feel are
modern urban amenities: satellite TV and bathrooms with hair dryers,
large towels, and good lighting; those with tubs have wall-mounted show-
ers. A cozy breakfast room is located in the remodeled basement. Reserve
at least four months in advance. In the summer, the two best rooms are on
the ground floor and open onto the leafy courtyard; they stay cool despite
the lack of air-conditioning. A grocery store is two doors down for travel-
ers needing provisions at 27 rue Cler, and the rue Cler outdoor market
(open Tues–Sun mornings) is right around the corner.

Hôtel du Jeu de Paume

Ile Saint-Louis (4e)
Madame Elyane Prache and her golden retriever, Scoop, will give you a
friendly greeting at this impressive, airy hotel on the exclusive Ile St-Louis.
The wooden skeleton of a 17th-century jeu de paume (precursor to tennis)
court rises from the open lobby two stories above a stone and wood entry
with a fireplace, couches, glassed-in elevator, and spiral staircases. Most
accommodations are snug to medium, but the simple stylish décor under
hewn beams keeps rooms from feeling cramped. Eat breakfast in the plant-
filled garden or indoors in the inviting lobby. The three standard duplexes
with spiral stairs are roomier (and don’t cost any more than a double), but
if you are staying five days or longer and want true bliss, check into the
three-bedroom 900 ($1,300) duplex apartment with a private terrace. A
600 ($840) two-bedroom apartment is also available for stays of five days

Hôtel du Lys

St-Germain-des-Prés (6e)
Housed in a 17th-century mansion on a street that dates back to 1180, this
hotel, with original tall casement windows and homey, intimate rooms dec-
orated in floral wallpaper with exposed-beam high ceilings, is a haven from
the bustling neighborhood. Rooms feature double glazing to keep out the
noise, and rooms 19 and 22 have balconies. People with disabilities need
to heed the lack of an elevator, and the staircase, although historic, is
narrow. The Lys is just a few blocks from the Seine and Notre-Dame in an
area that gets quite crowded in summer. Breakfast is included.

Hôtel du Vieux Saule
$$–$$$
Le Marais/Bastille (3e)
This is not our typical Parisian hotel. With a giant display of cacti and other
desert plants in the woody lobby, you will think you’ve arrived in a hotel
in the middle of Arizona. The cheerful, but small, rooms have a modern
décor and tiled bathrooms, hair dryers, safes, double-glazed windows, lug-
gage racks, Wi-Fi, satellite TV, trouser presses, and even small irons and
ironing boards. The rooms on the fifth floor tend to be bigger. Breakfast is
a buffet served in the original 16th-century cozy vaulted cellar accessed by
a winding staircase (no elevator). For those worn out by the day’s sight-
seeing, check out the sauna — again, an unusual perk for Paris. Promotions
are often offered online.

Hôtel Esmeralda
$–$$
Latin Quarter (5e)
This off-beat and ramshackle hotel is a favorite with budget travelers, so
you’ll want to book at least three months in advance. Its creaky wood
floors and cramped and sometimes dusty hallways pale in comparison to
its superior location just steps away from the Seine and Notre-Dame. If you
prefer hotels with such amenities as satellite TV, free toiletries, or space,
then the Esmeralda is probably not for you. There is an old, winding
wooden staircase (no elevator) and outstanding views of Notre-Dame and
the Seine from the hotel’s front rooms (make sure to specify these rooms
when you reserve). East rooms overlook St-Julien-le-Pauvre and square
Viviani. Shabby-chic velvet coverings and antique furniture create homey
warmth that almost makes up for the disappointingly dark rear rooms. The
front rooms with a view have modern bathrooms with tubs, and some are

Hôtel Henri IV

Louvre (1er)
This hotel doesn’t have an elevator; only five rooms have showers or tubs,
only two have toilets, and none have phones. The stairs are creaky, and
no matter how old you may be, this place will make you feel young in com-
parison. But this super-budget Henri IV is one of Europe’s most famous
hotels and nearly always is full. It occupies a dramatic location on place
Dauphine — the northernmost tip of Ile de la Cité, across the river from 
St-Germain and the Louvre and a few steps from Pont-Neuf. The 17th-
century building houses cozy rooms that are past their prime, though
many find them romantically evocative (others think they’re just run
down). Each room has a sink, but guests share the spotless toilets and
showers on each of the five floors. One of the communal bathrooms has
an enormous tub, and a few rooms have beautiful views of place Dauphine.
Rooms 19 and 20 have a shower, toilet, and a terrace for 65 ($82). All in
all, staying here is an adventure. Book far in advance.

Hôtel Jeanne d’Arc

Le Marais (4e)
Reserve well in advance for this great budget hotel on a pretty little street
just off the place St-Catherine. The place is full of eccentric furniture and
countryside touches, like soft tangerine-colored wallpaper decorating the
halls of the ground floor and a plant-filled dining room. Reception is
through a door on the right which features the hotel’s signature mosaic
mirror, a tribute to French pride. Rooms are small to decent-sized with
large windows, card-key access, and large bathrooms, but storage space is
a bit cramped. Other room features include direct-dial telephones, cable
TV, and bedside tables. If a view is important, make sure you request a
room at the top or facing the street because some rooms don’t have one.
The hotel is in the center of the Marais, and it can be a little noisy, but
you’re near the Musée Picasso, place des Vosges, and the Bastille, and the
fabulous Au Bistro de la Place cafe is in the square next door.

boast impressive bathrooms. You may want to ask for one of the four

and with Antoine St-Exupéry, author of The Little Prince, add a nice touch
to the taupe-colored lobby. The standard rooms are simple with colorful

The hotel is right at the edge of the St-Germain-des-Prés shopping district,
and Le Bon Marché department store, with its terrific L’Épicerie super-

lobby. The two-bed double rooms are dark, but spacious with high ceil-
ings. Each room has a writing table, a small closet, and a suitcase rack.

Paul Keniger is the third generation of his family to care for this very warm

even make the kitchen available during the low season. A washer/dryer
and iron are at your disposal. Signs in English recommend neighborhoods
to visit and tours to take, and you can always ask one of the Kenigers for
recommendations. The hotel is very close to the Sorbonne — it’s around
the corner from the Panthéon, near the outdoor green market on rue
Mouffetard — and its good rates attract students. One of the best organ-
ized Web sites for a hotel I’ve seen, check it out for individual floor plans
of each room, as well as the ever-present promotions. Rooms fill up quickly
in July and August, so if you plan to travel then, book well in advance.

Hôtel Montpensier

Louvre (1er)
Supposedly the former residence of Mademoiselle de Montpensier, cousin
of Louis XIV, this hotel’s high ceilings and windows, the stained-glass ceil-
ing in its lounge, and its grand staircase all work together to create a sense
of faded grandeur. Many rooms on the first two floors, which date from the
17th century, are serviceable with a budget-hotel décor, while rooms on
the fifth floor (an elevator is available) have attractive slanted ceilings and
good views over the rooftops. They are smaller than the first- and second-
floor rooms, but all the sizes here are quite impressive given the rates.
Most rooms are comfortably outfitted with easy chairs, ample closet
space, and modern bathrooms with hair dryers. Reserve at least a month
in advance for July. The prices are terrific for this location, just two blocks
from the Jardin du Palais Royal and right down the street from the Louvre
and the Jardin des Tuileries. Service was downright icy when I visited in

Hôtel Prince
$–$$
Eiffel Tower (7e)
Just a ten-minute walk from the Eiffel Tower, the Prince is a good value for
the location. Rooms are modern, soundproof, and have exposed stone
walls, matching curtains and bedspreads, and big bathrooms with fluffy
towels. Although they vary in size, all rooms are pleasant, comfortable,
and well kept, with double-glazed windows, suitcase racks, TV, minibar,
air-conditioning, and ample closets, and even hair dryers and safes. If
you’re too worn out from sightseeing to stagger out the door to the two
downstairs cafes (not a part of the hotel), the hotel can arrange for a local
restaurant to deliver a meal. Room 001 on the ground floor next to recep-
tion is available with facilities for travelers with disabilities.

Hôtel Saint-Merry
$$$
Le Marais (4e)
This unique hotel located on a pedestrian-only street in the Maraisand was
formerly the presbytery of the Church of Saint-Merry next door. It was also
once a brothel, but no matter what its history, it retains an almost spooky
medieval atmosphere. In fact, the bed in room no. 9 has flying buttresses
on either side (easy to trip over in the dark). The rooms have beamed ceil-
ings, stone walls, wrought-iron chandeliers, and candelabras. Fabrics are
sumptuous; bathrooms are fully tiled, and equipped with hair dryers. Staff
is very helpful. Higher prices are for larger rooms with views. In keeping
with its medieval feeling you won’t find an elevator in the building (Note:
21 winding steps lead to the second-floor reception area). TVs are in suites
only. The hotel is a few short blocks from the Seine and Hôtel de Ville. The
Louvre is about a 15-minute walk away.

Hôtel Saints-Pères
$$$
St-Germain-des-Prés (6e)
Travelers have made this romantic hotel one of the Left Bank’s most 
popular. Designed in the 17th century, this was the residence of Louis XIV’s
architect, and the hotel looks the part, furnished with antiques, old paint-
ings, tapestries, and gilt mirrors. Many of its 39 rooms overlook an inte-
rior courtyard where breakfast and drinks are served. Rooms have modern
amenities such as air-conditioning, satellite TVs, and minibars. The most
requested is the magnificent chambre à la fresque where guests sleep
beneath a 17th-century painted ceiling. The hotel is a stone’s throw from

Hôtel St-Jacques
$$
Latin Quarter (5e)
Not only was this hotel designed by Baron Haussman (architect of Paris
and its grand boulevards), it also had a cameo in the Cary Grant–Audrey
Hepburn film Charade. Several of its rooms have restored 19th-century ceil-
ing murals, and most of the high ceilings have elaborate plasterwork,
giving the décor an old-Paris feel that is accentuated with traditional fur-
niture and fabric-covered walls. The owners have added their own touches
in the hallways, with stenciling on the walls and trompe l’oeil painting.
Modern comforts include generally spacious rooms, an elevator, tiled bath-
rooms with hair dryers and toiletries, double-glazed windows, ample
closet space, fax and computer outlets, safes, and satellite TV. Although
they aren’t accessible by elevator (which stops a floor down), the rooms
on the top floor are less expensive and have great views (be sure to ask for
them specifically).

Hôtel Tiquetonne
$
Opéra (2e)
Though the happening neighborhood of Montorgeuil is quickly losing its
last vestiges of seediness, the somewhat shabby, though terrific bargain
Tiquetonne still remains. If a view is more important than space, ask for
one of the top rooms boasting views of the Eiffel Tower or Sacré-Coeur.
Each room has the basics: a bed with a wall-mounted wooden headboard,
table, and comfortable chairs and adequate storage space. Walls tend to
be thin. The Tiquetonne is located just off the busy pedestrian street rue
Montorgueil and is a stone’s throw from the red-light district of rue 
St-Denis and a five-minute walk to the Marais and the Georges Pompidou
center. Ask for rooms facing the quieter rue Tiquetonne. Note: The hotel
is closed in August.

Hôtel Verneuil
$$$
St-Germain-des-Préss-Eiffel Tower (7e)
In a city where accommodations range from the ultra-luxurious to the
barely inhabitable, Hotel Verneuil offers the elegance of a small boutique
hotel at a reasonable price. Located in the 7th arrondissement just a short
walk from St-Germain-des-Prés, the Louvre, the Musée D’Orsay, and the
Seine, Hotel Verneuil provides the location, quiet, and value that any visi-
tor to Paris can appreciate. The 17th-century building’s sedate, classically
decorated lobby contrasts with the 26 small, quirky rooms upstairs, all
with reasonably sized, en suite bathrooms. Original wood beams grace
many of the guest rooms, and breakfast (an additional charge) is served in
a whitewashed cellar with vaulted ceilings. Art galleries, antique dealers,
and more than a few good cafes, including the legendary Café de Flore and
Les Deux Magots, line the streets around the hotel. It’s an intimate, charm-
ing place that’s nice to come home to after a day of sightseeing.

Hôtel Vivienne
$–$$
Opéra (2e)
Hôtel Vivienne is well located between the Louvre and the Opéra and
offers comfortable, simply decorated rooms at a good price. They have
the traditional molding found in classic Parisian apartments, and have
soundproofing — something lacking in most Parisian lodgings. The bath-
rooms vary in size from adequate to huge, and all have hair dryers and
wall-mounted showers in the tubs. Some of the rooms have adjoining
doors, perfect for families; others have small terraces. A few have views 
of the Eiffel Tower. Before venturing from the neighborhood, explore 
the Galeries Vivienne and Colbert, gorgeous historic covered passage-
ways with pretty shops, intimate restaurants, and art galleries. Also 
of note, the French restaurant scene in the Diane Keaton–Jack Nicholson
film, Something’s Gotta Give, was filmed at Le Grand Colbert restaurant
right down the street.

which is calm and not subject to the bustle of France’s widest avenue.
Exuding a sense of luxury and peacefulness, draperies filter the sun in the
Lord Byron’s lobby, the reception desk is under an arch, and a pleasant
little garden makes you feel miles away from the hubbub. An elevator will
whisk you to rooms furnished with antique reproductions, Provençal and

Pavillon de la Reine
$$$$
Le Marais (3e)
Translated as “The Queen’s Pavilion,” this is more a French country house
than a castle in the middle of Paris, just off the Place des Vosges. Enter
through wrought-iron gates and pass through the pretty flowered court-
yard and on into a cozy wood-beamed and flagstone-floored lobby where
in winter, a fire burns in the marble fireplace in the antique-filled lounge.
The large standard rooms are decorated with such country touches as
gingham wallpaper and Louis XIII–style furniture, the superior duplex
rooms have modern beds (some decorated in velvets and taffeta) located
in a loft above a cozy sitting room with comfortable chairs and couches.
Rooms overlook the courtyard or a flowered patio and have all the ameni-
ties: air-conditioning, cable TV, Internet, room service, minibar, and laun-
dry service. Breakfast is served in the vaulted cellar, amidst tapestries;
pastries are made at the boulangerie next door. You will definitely be
treated like a queen (or king) here.

Dining and Snacking
in Paris
In This Chapter
 Getting the inside scoop on Paris’s dining scene
 Eating well without breaking the bank
 Grabbing something on the go
 Discovering the best bakeries, cafes, wine bars, and tea salons
 Finding a restaurant by location, cuisine, and price
P
aris, and the rest of the country, is a feast. Traditional haute 
cuisine — a delicate balance of flavors, sauces, and ingredients
blended with a studied technique — includes such classics as blanquette
de veau (veal in an eggy cream sauce), pot-au-feu (an excellent stew of
fatty beef and vegetables), coq au vin (chicken braised in red wine with
onions and mushrooms), bouillabaisse (seafood soup), and that hearty
staple boeuf bourguignon (beef stew with red wine).
But when people started thinking healthy a few decades back, buttery,
creamy, saucy French cuisine quickly found itself on the outs. So the
French invented nouvelle cuisine, which gave chefs an excuse to concoct
new dishes — still French, mind you, but less fattening because they use
fewer heavy creams and less butter and serve (much) smaller portions.
When the nouvelle trend lost steam (in part because of the miniscule
portions), people began spinning off more-healthful and/or more-
creative cooking styles. (In fact, these days, that American staple and
butt of many French jokes — the hamburger — has finally become chic!
Served in a variety of inventive ways, it’s not what you’ll find back 
home — and it’s eaten with knife and fork!) Add to these styles the mix
of French regional restaurants and the many ethnic dining rooms, and
you’ll never want for variety.
This chapter is designed to make you feel comfortable about dining in
Parisian restaurants and have at least one experience of a true French
meal that stretches over several incredible courses. Each restaurant
listed has all the ingredients of an excellent dining spot — fantastic
cooking, reasonable prices, and great atmosphere — and creates the

kind of experience that lingers on in your memory after the last dish is
cleared away. Then, when you just can’t sit down to another multiple-
course meal, you can choose other options, from street and ethnic food,
to cafeterias, tea salons, and cafes.
For detailed culinary information, see Chapter 2, where I give a brief run-
down on French cuisine, a useful glossary of French culinary terms, and
a user’s guide to typical French dishes.
Getting the Dish on the Local Scene
Making reservations for dinner
The vast majority of French restaurants are very small establishments
with limited seating, and tables are scrupulously saved for folks who
book. Always try to make at least a same-day reservation, even for a
modest neighborhood bistro. If you are concerned about your language
skills, you can always visit the establishment before service starts to
make a same-day or next-day reservation. Or, ask the concierge in your
hotel, or the hotel’s desk clerk to make a reservation for you. Some top
restaurants require several weeks’ notice. Remember to call if you’re
going to be more than 20 minutes late. Showing up late is considered
bad form.
If you’re staying at a hotel with a staff concierge, phone or fax ahead 
and ask the concierge to make a reservation if you’d like to eat at a
sought-after restaurant. Make the call as early as possible, specifying
your preferred date with a back-up date or two. Don’t forget to tip the
concierge (slip 10/$16 into an envelope and discreetly present it when
checking out).
Dressing to dine
Only the most expensive restaurants enforce dress codes (suit and tie),
and in theory, you can dress up or down as you like. Parisians, however,
are a pretty stylish lot (how do Frenchwomen get their scarves to do
that?), even when dressing informally in jeans. Relaxed dressing doesn’t
mean sloppy jeans and sneakers — especially sneakers. The look to aim
for is casual but upscale. You can’t go wrong if you dress in neutrals —
think black, beige, cream, navy, and chocolate. If you wear jeans, pair
them with a nice jacket, sweater, or shirt and good shoes and nice acces-
sories. Go a notch dressier than what you’d wear at home.
Knowing the difference between a cafe and a bistro
Eateries go by various names in France, and in theory at least, these
labels give you some clue to how much a meal costs. From most expen-
sive to least expensive, the lineup generally goes like this: restaurant,
bistro, brasserie, cafe. The key word is generally. Never rely on the name
of an establishment as the sole price indicator; some of the city’s most
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in Paris 131

expensive places call themselves cafes. Furthermore, the awnings above
quintessential cafes often claim the labels of restaurant, cafe, brasserie,
or some other combination. The only way to be sure of the price is to
read the menu, which by law is posted outside.
The following is a list of the different types of establishments and what
you should expect.
 Restaurants are where you go to savor French cuisine in all its glory.
At their best, classic dishes are excellent, and new dishes are inven-
tive. Dining is usually more formal than in bistros or brasseries, and
service is slower. You may also have more than one server. Generally,
restaurants serve lunch between noon and 2:30 p.m. and dinner
between 7 and 10 p.m. You must be seated for lunch no later than 
2 p.m., if you want a full meal.
Between 3 and 7 p.m., you may find it nearly impossible to have a
sit-down meal in a Paris restaurant or bistro. During this swing
shift, your best bet is to head to a cafe, tearoom, or wine bar. Dining
at 7 p.m. is considered very early for dinner in Paris; most Parisians
wouldn’t think about sitting down before 8 p.m. But starting too
late — 10 p.m. is getting dangerous — can also leave you without
many options.
Restaurant critics are divided about the ménu dégustation (meh-noo
day-goo-stah-see-oh; sampler, or tasting, menu), featured in many of
the city’s top restaurants. Made up of small portions of the chef’s
signature dishes, it offers tremendous value because you have the
opportunity to try more dishes. But some say there are too many
portions for a customer to get a sense of the chef’s artistry, and the
mixture of so many flavors just confuses, instead of enriches, the
palate.
 The typical bistro used to be a mom-and-pop operation with a
menu confined to such Parisian standbys as boeuf bourguignon
(braised beef in red wine sauce), and tarte tatin (caramelized
upside-down apple pie). Today, many bistros have expanded upon
the old classics but retain the tradition of offering hearty, relatively
low-priced dishes in a convivial, intimate atmosphere. Think crush
of elbows and the sounds of corks popping, glasses clinking, multi-
tudes of conversations, and people having a good time. Bistros are
where Parisians come to dine most often.
 Literally, the word brasserie means “brewery” and refers to the
Alsatian menu specialties that include staples such as beer, Riesling
wine, and choucroute (a sauerkraut-based dish, usually topped by
cuts of ham). Most brasseries are large, cheerful, brightly lit places
that open early and close late (some are open 24 hours a day), and
have an immense selection of dishes on the menu, although many
no longer specialize in Alsatian fare. At brasseries, you can usually
get a meal at any time of day, even in hours when restaurants and
bistros are closed, and the food is relatively inexpensive.
Part III: Settling into Paris 
132

Sadly, brasseries began to fall to corporate acquisition in the 1970s,
and today most are part of one all-encompassing chain. Although
this fact shouldn’t stop you from visiting some of Paris’s legendary
eateries, look out for places that list mundane and repetitive food
on their menus — they’re more numerous than you think. Your best
bet is to get a look at the menus of brasseries that interest you and
compare costs, as well as listings. If poulet rôti (rotisserie chicken),
steak frites (steak and fries), and omelets seem to be highlights, you
may want to try eating somewhere else.
 Cafes are typically open from about 8 a.m. to 1 a.m. They serve
drinks and food all day from a short menu that often includes
salads, sandwiches, steak, mussels, and french fries. Prime loca-
tions or famous literary cafes carry higher price tags. Most cafes
offer reasonably priced omelets, croques (see later), sandwiches,
soups, or salads. Omelets come plain with just a sprinkling of herbs
or filled with cheese, ham, or other hearty additions. Onion soup
(soupe à l’oignon) is a traditional Parisian dish, and you may see
soupe de poisson (fish soup) on the menu. Another cafe favorite is
the croque monsieur, a grilled ham sandwich covered with melted
cheese (which often comes open-faced), or a croque madame, the
same dish topped with an egg. Or try a salade niçoise, a huge bowl
filled with lettuce, boiled potatoes, tuna, hard-boiled eggs, capers,
tomatoes, olives, and anchovies or a salade de chèvre chaude, fresh
greens topped with warm goat cheese on croutons. These dishes
make a light, pleasant meal for 6 to 12 ($9.60–$19).
Parisians use cafes the way the British use pubs — as extensions of
their living rooms. They’re places where you meet friends before
heading to the movies or a party, read your newspaper, write in
your journal, or just hang out and people-watch. Regardless of
whether you order a cup of coffee or the most expensive cognac in
the house, no one will ask you to leave. Coffee, of course, is the
chief drink. It comes black in a small cup, often with a thin wrapped
square of dark chocolate, unless you order a café crème or café au
lait (coffee with steamed milk, which Parisians usually have at
breakfast). Thé (tay; tea) is also fairly popular but generally isn’t
high quality (check on the menu for mentions of a specific brand —
“Thé Mariages Frères,” for example, will be very good). Chocolat
chaud (shock-o-lah-shoh; hot chocolate), on the other hand, is
absolutely superb and made from real ground chocolate. The result
is a thick, rich, yet not too sweet taste of heaven.
 Tearooms, or salons de thé, usually open midmorning and close by
early evening. Some serve light lunches, but most are at their best
in the afternoon for desserts with coffee or tea.
 Wine bars operate from midmorning to late evening when you can
order wine by the glass and munch on snacks such as tartines
(open-faced sandwiches), olives, and cheese. Some offer simple
lunch menus, but like cafes and tearooms, they’re generally better
for light bites.
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in Paris 133

Understanding the order of a meal
A proper meal consists of three, or sometimes four, courses, so portions
are usually moderate. Be aware of the traditional way French restaurants
serve food.
 An apéritif is a light drink that precedes the meal. The French don’t
like to start a meal by numbing the palate with strong liquor. They
usually stick to such offerings as a kir, a mixture of white wine and
crème de cassis (black currant liqueur), which is light and the most
common premeal drink.
 You’re always served bread with your meal, but you must request
butter.
 Water isn’t placed on the table automatically — you must ask for 
it. To get regular tap water (which is perfectly fine to drink), as
opposed to the pricey equivalent in a bottle, simply ask for une
carafe d’eau (oon kar-aff doh).
 Cheese comes after the main course and is usually accompanied by
a red wine.
 Dessert comes after the cheese course, but dessert and cheese can
be served at the same time at your request.
 Diners traditionally don’t drink coffee during the meal. Black coffee
is served after dessert in a demitasse cup with sugar cubes on the
side. If you want milk with your coffee, you must ask for a café au
lait (ka-fay oh lay) or café crème (ka-fay krem).
 After the meal is finished, it is possible to order a digestif, or a small
glass of liquor or fortified wine, thought to aid the digestion. Some
classic digestifs are cognac, Calvados (an apple brandy from
Normandy), sherry, and port.
 If you have food left on your plate, don’t ask for a doggie bag.
Restaurants are not accustomed to handling these types of
requests.

To tip or not to tip
In France, waiting tables is a profession with benefits and retirement security, and
waiters are treated with respect (even though you may come across some who do not
return the sensibility). When it comes to tipping them, you may have heard not to leave
anything since a gratuity is already included in the bill. It’s true that an 18 percent serv-
ice charge, which appears on the bill as service compris, is added. But waiters never
get the full 18 percent. Thus, it’s customary to leave a few euro, or about 5 percent of
the bill after a meal, unless the service was truly terrible.

The menu du jour at many establishments includes red or white wine.
The standard measure is un quart (a quarter-liter carafe), sometimes
served in un pot or un pichet (a pitcher). If wine isn’t included, you can
order vin ordinaire (house wine) or a Beaujolais (a light, fruity red wine),
a Côtes du Rhône (a dry red wine), or a Chardonnay (a light white wine),
which are very reasonably priced. And you can always opt for soda,
juice, or water instead (l’eau plat is still water; l’eau gazeuse is carbon-
ated water). Cocktails are available but discouraged because they’re
thought to numb the palate. Note that soda is often more expensive than
a glass of wine at many establishments.
In France, as anywhere, you should never underestimate the importance
of good manners. Your meal will be much smoother if you remember
essential but basic phrases such as “Bonjour, monsieur” (hello, sir) and
“Merci, madame” (thank you, madam). Keep in mind, too, that French
table manners require that all food, even fruit, be eaten with a knife 
and fork.
Contrary to what you may have seen in the movies, never, ever refer to
the waiter as “garçon,” (boy) and don’t snap your fingers at him or her.
Instead, say, “Monsieur, s’il vous plaît!” or “Madame/Mademoiselle, s’il
vous plaît!” (Sir/Madam/Miss, if you please!).
Trimming the Fat from Your Budget
If you’re watching your pocketbook when it comes to dining out, follow-
ing a few of these simple tips can go a long way toward making the bill as
appealing as the food.
 Order prix-fixe (set-price) meals. These set-price meals are up to
30 percent cheaper than ordering the same dishes à la carte.
What’s the trade-off? Your options are more limited than if you
order from the main menu. Review the prix-fixe option carefully to
determine what you’re getting at that price. Does the meal come
with wine, and if so, how much — a glass or a half-bottle? Is dessert
or coffee included?
 Make lunch your main meal. Many restaurants offer great deals on
a fixed-price lunch. You probably won’t be hungry for a full meal at
dinnertime after two or three courses at lunch.
 Try the crêperies. Crêperies (many are off the boulevard du
Montparnasse around the square Délambre) offer a great value. Try
savory meat- or vegetable-filled crêpes, called galettes, with a bowl
of cider for your main meal and honey, jam, chantilly (whipped
cream), chocolate, or fruit-filled crêpes for dessert. Surroundings
are usually Brittany-inspired with red-checked tablecloths, wooden
beams, maritime souvenirs, and pictures of Bretagnons in native
dress.
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in Paris 135

 Try the falafel stands. If your day’s plans include a trip to the Marais
(Picasso Museum, Place des Vosges, Maison de Victor Hugo, and
shopping; see Chapters 11 and 13 for information on guided tours),
have for lunch a delicious and cheap falafel or other Middle Eastern
food from one of the storefronts on and around rue des Rosiers.
 Try chain restaurants or sandwich shops. Chez Clément, Léon de
Bruxelles, and Bistro Romain offer some good-value, though not
inspired, meals. Pomme de Pain, Cosi, and Lina’s have fresh and
tasty sandwiches.
 Pay attention to the menu’s details. On most menus, the cheaper
dishes are made of cheaper cuts of meat or the organs of animals,
such as brains, tripe, and the like (often appearing on menus are
cervelles, which are pork or sheep brains, tête de veau, calf’s head,
rognons, kidneys).
 Don’t eat breakfast at your hotel. Doing so adds, at the very least,
$5 more per person to your hotel bill. Grab a croissant or a pain au
chocolat (chocolate-filled pastry) from a boulangerie (bakery).
 Know the tipping rules. Service is usually included at restaurants
but it’s customary to leave about 5 percent extra for your server.
Paris’s Best Restaurants
Restaurants are listed alphabetically for easy reference, followed by the
price range, neighborhood, and type of cuisine for each. Price ranges
reflect the cost of a three-course meal for one person ordered à la carte,
featuring an appetizer, main dish, dessert, and coffee — alcohol is not
included.
The number of dollar signs used to describe each restaurant gives you a
general idea of how much a meal costs at dinner, but don’t make price
your only criteria for choosing a restaurant. Most establishments offer
fixed-price menus (also called formules or prix fixe) that can bring the
cost down one whole price category. Likewise, if you’re dying to try a
place that’s above your budget, visit it at lunch when meals are cheaper.
See Table 10-1 for a key to the restaurant prices.

The restaurants listed here range from moderately priced establish-
ments to homey neighborhood favorites to chic “in” spots. Also included
are some bargain eateries and a few of the city’s most sumptuous restau-
rants where haute cuisine is an art form.
See the “Restaurants on the Right Bank” and “Restaurants on the Left
Bank” maps for locations of restaurants in this section.
A La Petite Chaise
$$
St-Germain-des-Prés (7e)
CLASSIC FRENCH
Founded in 1680, this small gem is alleged to be the oldest restaurant in
Paris, and its roster of historic diners is quite impressive: Heir to the throne
Philip d’Orléans and his priest, Cardinal Dubois, George Sand, Toulouse-
Lautrec, Colette and François Mitterand, are just a few. The entryway,
adorned with a smoky antique mirror from the early 18th century, leads to
a softly illuminated, cozy dining room reminiscent of an old country inn,
which it once was. Start with assiette nordique et son sorbet de citron vert (a
plate of salmon with a side of lime sorbet). Main courses may include a par-
mentier de poissons à l’échalote et sa salade verte (thinly sliced fish in a shal-
lot sauce served with a green salad) or leg of lamb cooked in its own juices.
The house special dessert is gateau au chocolat — a rich chocolate cake
topped with English cream.
See map p. 140. 36 rue de Grenelle. % 01-42-22-13-35. Métro: Sèvres-Babylone. (Exit
the station on bd. Raspail and walk one block north to rue de la Chaise. Follow the
street to the end, where it intersects rue de Grenelle.) Prix-fixe lunch menu comes
with a glass of wine and a café: 19, 25, or 29 ($30, $40, or $46); dinner prix fixe
(main course with appetizer and dessert): 33 ($53). AE, MC, V. Open: Daily noon–
2 p.m. and 7–11 p.m.
Au Bascou
$$
Le Marais (3e)
BASQUE/SOUTHWEST
Located in a simple and softly lit rustic interior, some of the best Basque
dishes in Paris can be found here. (The Basque region is the corner of
southwestern France resting along the Spanish border and is known for
its distinct dialect and the excellent culinary skills of its citizens.) Consider
starting with a pipérade basquaise (a light terrine of eggs, tomatoes, and
spices) before moving on to roast wild duck or rabbit in a red-wine sauce.
A bottle of Irouléguy, a smooth red Basque wine, makes a nice accompa-
niment to meals, and the service, though friendly, at times can leave a lot
to be desired. You may want to save this place for a night when you don’t
want to linger over dinner.
See map p. 138. 38 rue Réaumur. % 01-42-72-69-25. Métro: Arts et Métiers. (Exit the
station at rue de Turbigo and cross over it to rue Réamur. Head east one block; the
restaurant is on the corner of rue Réamur and rue Volta.) Main courses: 18 ($29).
AE, MC, V. Open: Mon–Fri noon to 2 p.m. and 8–10:30 p.m.

Auberge de Jarente
$$
Le Marais (4e)
BASQUE
Since 1964, cooks have been using olive oil, tomatoes, and all kinds of pep-
pers to create mouth-watering Basque fare here. The 23 ($37) menu may
include starters of fish soup or terrine de lapin à la confiture d’oignons
(rabbit terrine served with onions, chutney style). Or try the house cas-
soulet (white bean casserole with meat), and for a main course, such
Basque-influenced dishes as sliced duck breast in a barely sweet honey
lemon sauce and potatoes. Top it off with a massive crème brûlée and
sheep’s cheese with jam. Order this menu because a half-bottle of wine is
included — this is rare! The rustic décor includes a cavelike, cozy down-
stairs, and service is downright familial.
See map p. 138. 7 rue de Jarente (between rue de Sevigné and rue de Turenne, just

Auberge Le Pot de Terre
$
Latin Quarter (5e)
CLASSIC FRENCH
Parisians in the know relish this restaurant’s quality fresh food at dirt
cheap (for Paris) prices. Served in a rustic dining room with stone walls
and exposed wooden ceiling beams, the classic market fare served by
charming waitstaff includes such starters as a fantastic onion soup, mus-
sels cooked in white wine with onions, and a duck liver salad. Main courses
could be duck confit with parsleyed potatoes, roast leg of lamb with garlic,
sautéed salmon with sorrel. You couldn’t say that the food is terribly
unique for a French restaurant, but it is well prepared and, at 16 ($26)
for a three-course menu, worth a visit.

Eiffel Tower (7e)
MODERN BISTRO
A stone’s throw from the Eiffel Tower, the elegant Au Bon Accueil’s daily-
changing, green market–based menu is simple and delicious. Tables are
set with chewy grainy bread and a small plate of saucisson (thinly sliced
sausage) in an unpretentious dining room with sand and wood colors and
slate floors. If you’re ordering from the prix-fixe menu, you may start with
a green salad with raspberry vinegar, fresh Parmesan, and smoked bacon
followed by aile de raie, radis noirs confits et salade de pourpier (wing of ray
with black radish confit and wild dandelion salad). Main dishes are divine

Au Pied de Cochon

Les Halles (1er)
CLASSIC FRENCH
With marble, murals, elaborate sconces, chandeliers, an excess of tourists
and some of the most patient waiters around, Au Pied de Cochon opened
in 1946 and has played a vibrant part in the history of this old market
neighborhood. Specialties here are platters of fish and of course, pork,
specifically andouillette AAAAA (a strong-tasting regional tripe sausage)
which you can get grilled with béarnaise sauce. There’s also the namesake
dish, pied de cochon (pigs’ feet). Or, if you’re daring — and hungry — have
the plateau rouge: half a Canadian lobster, crayfish, shrimp, crabs, and
other red fish served on a towering pile of shaved ice. Finish with melt-in-
your-mouth profiteroles (cream puffs).

$–$$
Montmartre (18e)
CLASSIC FRENCH
This is a reliable old standard a bit off the tourist track in Montmartre and
well worth the trek. Its chic burgundy leather banquettes are usually filled
with a local crowd savoring moderately priced classic cuisine that may
include stewed lamb shoulder from Corrèze, and pot au feu os à moelle
crème de Raifort (tender beef boiled with vegetables and served with
marrow and horseradish). As an appetizer, try the crépinette de pied de
cochon (pork sausage patty). Desserts are made on the premises and the
selection changes often, but you can count on a moelleux aux chocolat
(chocolate cake with a wonderfully liquid center) served with an orange
purée, or a light custard cream.

Bofinger
$$
Bastille (4e)
ALSATIAN/BRASSERIE
Parisians like to joke that the clientele at this famous restaurant near the
Bastille is made up of tourists and the elderly. But Bofinger, which first
opened in 1864, continues to pack them in, with waiters in long white aprons
delivering hearty cuisine, much of it based on the Franco-Germanic cook-
ing of the Alsace region — lots of choucroute (sauerkraut, usually served
with sausages or other cuts of pork). The downstairs dining room is ornately
decorated with Art Nouveau flourishes and a glass-domed ceiling. Upstairs
is cozier with wood paneling. It’s owned by the Flo brasserie chain, which
means that you’ll see similar menus in the chain’s other restaurants, which
include Julien and Brasserie Flo. Service can be whirlwind. Brasseries are
good for off-hours dining, tending to stay open until 1 a.m.

Brasserie Balzar
$$
Latin Quarter (5e)
ALSATIAN/BRASSERIE
Though it’s now owned by the brasserie-buying titan Flo Group, locals still
count this brasserie that opened in 1898 as a favorite and can regularly be
seen in off hours sipping coffee and nibbling pastries. Choose from such
hearty French classics (served by twinkly-eyed waiters) as steak tartare
avec frites (raw minced beef with french fries and salad) or roast leg of
Quercy lamb. You can also get a good veal liver (foie de veau), steak au
poivre (steak with crushed peppercorns), and a few fresh fish dishes.
Portions are copious, french fries are crunchy, perfectly salted, and among
the best in Paris.

Brasserie de l’Ile St-Louis

Ile St-Louis (4e)
ALSATIAN/BRASSERIE
Brasserie de l’Ile St-Louis is loud and bustling. Its outdoor tables have 
an unparalleled view of the eastern tip of Ile de la Cité, the back of 
Notre-Dame, the Seine, and the Panthéon. The food is quintessentially
Alsatian — including choucroute (heaps of tender, biting sauerkraut and
meaty slices of ham); the hearty cassoulet, laden with rich beans and
tender pieces of lamb and pork; and ham shank atop a bed of lentils.
Although the food is not all that it used to be, the location is worth the trip.

Breakfast in America
$
Latin Quarter (5e)
AMERICAN
Connecticut-born filmmaker Craig Carlson opened this diner in 2003 after
years as an expat craving American-style big breakfasts. The food here is
even better than what you get in the roadside spots back home, and it’s been
discovered by the locals: American travelers in need of a fix are often out-
numbered by Parisians who pack the place for fluffy pancakes, crispy bacon,
omelets, and a 2.10 ($3.35) “bottomless mug o’ joe.” Breakfast is served all
day every day except Sundays, but the menu also includes burgers, nachos,
chicken wings, and sandwiches. A 9.95 ($16) combo of burger, fries, and
coffee is a good deal for Paris. Sunday’s 16 ($25) brunch is, of course, par-
ticularly busy. Service is efficient and friendly and in English; you may even
be seated by Craig himself. There is another location in the Marais at 4 rue
Malher, Métro: Saint-Paul. Note: Tip is not included in the final tab here. The
restaurants are very small and fill up quickly.

Caveau du Palais
$$
Ile de la Cité (4e)
CLASSIC FRENCH
It’s quieter at night at this restaurant where Yves Montand and Simone
Signoret were regulars. Artist André Renoux painted the interior (Interior
Restaurant Caveau du Palais) and the cozy wood-beamed place bustles at
lunch; it’s a favorite of lawyers from the nearby Palais de Justice. It’s
located in the heart of the serene, tree-lined place Dauphine, a secluded
cobblestoned park nestled off Pont Neuf near the tip of Isle de la Cité. Start
with the peppery house pâté or save your meat cravings for the house’s
special côte de boeuf, a kilo of grilled giant ribs prepared for two. Finish it
off with a classic crème brûlée or a few boules of ice cream. The owners
display the work of up-and-coming artists and their big dog is a friendly
presence.

Latin Quarter (5e)
AUVERGNE
One of my favorite places to take people in Paris, ChantAirelle has deli-
cious peasant food, an outdoor high-walled garden, products for sale from
the Auvergne region of France, and an enormous and friendly black cat.
The door “moos” when opened and other wildlife sounds can be heard
beneath the happy chatter of diners. Food is presented in good-sized por-
tions, and appetizers may include ardoise de salaisons de Haute-Loire (a
terrine served with regional meats including a variety of saucissons and
country ham) or oeuf pochés à la fourme d’Ambert artisanale (poached

tender magret de canard au miel de Montagne et à la fleur de thym (duck
filet cooked in mountain honey and thyme blossom) or a truffade (a casse-
role of thinly sliced potatoes cooked in cream, with smoked ham in the
center). The best Auvergne wine is the Chateauguay, a fine fruity red. The
restaurant is a block from the Panthéon.

Chez Casimir

Gare du Nord (10e)
CLASSIC FRENCH
If you’re arriving (or leaving) Paris via the Gare du Nord, schedule a lunch
or dinner at this terrific restaurant not too far from the station. It’s owned
by Thierry Breton and on the same street as its sister restaurant, Chez
Michel (reviewed later in this list). Both are well worth the trip and reser-
vations are strongly suggested. The menu here consists of ingredients from
the green market found that morning or the night before. Start with the
refreshing carpaccio de haddock (marinated sliced raw haddock), then have
onglet de boeuf poëlé, choux de bruxelles et carottes (pan-fried beef served
with Brussels sprouts and carrots), or be almost-too-adventurous and try
the tete de veau, a French comfort-food classic — meat from the head and
neck region of a young calf. For dessert, indulge in clafoutis aux prunes
rouges (a pancake made from crepe batter dotted with bits of red plums).

At the base of the rue du Calvaire steps heading to the place de Tertre, is
a cozy restaurant with some of the cheapest eats in this neighborhood,
which isn’t exactly known for bargain dining. Food is hearty, and the pro-
prietor, M. Rajha, is charming and friendly. The dining room is decorated
with wood benches, red-and-white picnic tablecloths, and a collage of
Toulouse-Lautrec period posters and kitschy Lautrec-style paintings of
cats dining. Stick to such basics as onion soup, cassoulet, or poulet rôti
avec frites (roast chicken with french fries) and you’re guaranteed to leave

Crowds of Parisians come here to the sister restaurant of Chez Casimir for
excellent, unusual food at very fair prices served in twin dining rooms. The
succulent scallops are hand-picked by scuba divers, served with truffles
in the winter. The menu may include crème d’homard Bréton (cream of lob-
ster soup topped with shaved Parmesan cheese) or the regional kig ha farz
(a stew made with veal and pork flavored with herbs and served with
bacon bits and vegetables) or it may venture south to Nîmes with such
local specialties as a brandade de morue legerment gratinée au parmesan
(a salt-cod casserole, baked lightly with Parmesan cheese). For dessert,
ask if they have kouign amann (a Breton pastry made of layers of brioche
dough, butter, and caramelized sugar). The cellar is more casual with
wooden tables. Choose from more than 100 different wines at retail cost,
a truly dizzying experience.

famed Costes brothers, who have ultrahip restaurants across the city and
the Hotel Costes, the décor is made of up of white plastic tables and chairs
and large silver and white abstract sculptures. The waitresses could under-
study as models — rail thin, six feet tall, and radiant. The menu changes
every month, but modern French food is fused with Asian-inspired cre-
ations. You might find a starter of avocado-stuffed king crab, or gazpacho.
Move on to turbot grilled in béarnaise sauce, mandarina crispy duck (a
play perhaps on the French purse company?), or the mysterious tigre qui
pleure (crying tiger — you’ll just have to ask). Desserts usually combine in-

Les Halles (1er)
CLASSIC BISTRO
When Les Halles still was Paris’s marketplace, its workers came to La Poule
au Pot to share this signature dish, an old French recipe of chicken stewed
with broth and vegetables, which has been served here since 1935 with
much success — if the livre d’or (a gold book filled with the names of visit-
ing celebrities) means anything. After the market’s demise, visits from such
celebrities as Maurice Chevalier, the Rolling Stones, and Prince kept this
Parisian bistro on the map. The atmosphere created by the long zinc bar,
pots of wine, red leather banquettes, a blackboard with the day’s market spe-
cials, wood paneling, and waiters in long aprons transports you to another
era, and traditional French fare is the name of the game here. Begin with a
dozen escargot cooked Burgundy style with butter, garlic, and parsley or
oeufs cocotte à la crème (eggs baked with cream), then try a filet of salmon
cooked in a saffron cream sauce, or the succulent house poule au pot with
a tureen of the broth on the side. Finish with a velvety crème brûlée.

MODERN BISTRO
This Michelin-starred place is still a bonne addresse among the dining chic.
Joël Robuchon, arguably the most famous chef in France when he retired

lacquered restaurant that serves simple French and Asian fusion food in
which the ingredients are the real stars. Seating is at a 36-person counter
that wraps around the open kitchen. The idea is to give diners a “behind the
line” experience, so you may see Robuchon giving orders, sous-chefs sauc-
ing main dishes, or a pig being roasted on a spit. The menu continually
changes. Robuchon offers tapaslike tasting plates that diners are encour-
aged to share. Main dishes can include tournedos of beef flavored with
Malabar black pepper, cutlets of milk-fed lamb with thyme, or bass cooked
in its own juices with lemon grass. Robuchon has a no-reservations policy

with a zinc bar graced by wine barrels; seating is quite close (you’ll prob-
ably become friends with the diners on each side of you by the end of the

Calvados, stuffed with potatoes, and stuffed cabbage and kidneys, though
the proprietors do pay a nod to fish lovers with a tasty seafood terrine 
and tuna tartare. Other typical dishes are grilled lamb chops, steak-frites

Champs-Elysées (8e)
HAUTE CUISINE
Chef Phillippe Legendre has earned two Michelin stars for this restaurant
in the Four Seasons Georges V, and I’ve been raving about it since 2000.
This is a true temple to haute cuisine from the gray-and-gold dining room
with its high ceilings and overstuffed chairs to the Limoges porcelain and
Riedel stemware created for the restaurant. The sumptuous and inventive
cuisine is served by the perfect waitstaff. Diners may start with an egg-
plant risotto with a carpaccio of cèpes (mushrooms) from Sologne served
with black truffles and continue with milk-fed Pyrenées lamb roasted in
sesame and mint cream. For dessert, a Manjari chocolate soufflé flavored
with orange or the chef’s choice of assorted chocolate desserts may be on
the menu. The wine list here is magnificent; if he has time, chief somme-
lier Thierry Hamon may even give you a tour of the cellar.

Le 404

Le Marais (3e)
MOROCCAN
This is one happening place where patrons and staff may dance on the bar
or in the aisles and the vibe is high energy and downright fun. Named for
the Peugot 404, one of the most popular models of car in Morocco in the
1960s, the restaurant is known as much for its fashionable clientele as its
tasty tajines, couscous, and other North African dishes, all eaten in a dining
room that simply evokes another place with carved wooden screens 
in front of tall windows, low (and close-to-your-neighbor) seating, and
exposed stone walls. You may start the evening with a meze tasting plate
of hummus and other regional appetizers and continue on to a flaky and
tender chicken tajine stewed in lemon and olives (tajine is the clay pot in
which everything is cooked) or couscous with seven vegetables.

Le Grenier de Notre-Dame
$–$$
Latin Quarter (5e)
VEGETARIAN
This cozy, two-level plant-filled restaurant near Notre-Dame opened in 1978
on a street that once was home to butcher shops. The food, which can be
inconsistent, is generally good, filling, and nearly all vegetarian, but vegans
take note: Eggs, cheese, and some fish are used here. Especially recom-
mended is the miso soup with tofu and seaweed and the vegetable pâté
served with warm toast; a white bean cassoulet filled with tofu, seitan, and

Fast French food zones
When you’re short on time or money, the following streets have many restaurants with
fast service at low prices.
 Avenue d’Ivry and Avenue de Choisy, 13e: Far off the tourist track, the Vietnamese,
Chinese, and Thai restaurants along these wide avenues cater to the local
Southeast Asian population. Prices are low and quality is high, and you can eat like
the locals.
 Boulevard de Belleville, 11e: This street features many couscouseries (couscous
restaurants) that are reasonably priced and satisfactory, if not outstanding. Middle
Eastern snacks, pastries, and a glass of mint tea make an exotic and inexpensive
meal.
 Boulevard du Montparnasse, 14e: It’s not fast food, but it’s still worth a mention.
The block between rue Vavin and boulevard Raspail has four cafes with literary
associations (early-20th-century writers such as Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Joyce,
and St-Vincent Millay spent a lot of time at La Coupole, Le Dôme, Le Select, and
La Rotonde) as well as high and moderately priced seafood restaurants, crêperies,
sandwich shops, and ethnic eateries.
 Métro Belleville, 11e: The streets radiating out from this station are the northern
headquarters for Asian cuisine. You can usually slurp down noodle soup at any
hour of the day and well into the night.
 Rue des Rosiers, in the Marais, 3e: People have been known to trudge across
town for the huge pita-bread sandwiches sold on this street. Stuffed with falafel
(deep-fried chickpea balls), eggplant, and salad, and then topped with your choice
of sauce, this must be the best 5 ($8) meal in town.
 Rue du Montparnasse, 14e: The street between boulevard Edgar Quinet and
boulevard du Montparnasse is a crêperie row of inexpensive Breton eateries.
Whether the crêpes are sugared up with syrups and jam or stuffed with vegeta-
bles and meat (these are often called galettes), they make a tasty light meal for
less than 11 ($18).
 Rue Sainte-Anne, 2e: Sushi usually is expensive in Paris, but because this street
lies within the same neighborhood as many Japanese businesses, you find the
freshest fish and most authentic Japanese dishes at moderate prices.

vegetables; and the enormous portions of lentil moussaka made with
lentils, white cheese, egg, tomatoes, and eggplant. For dessert try the
homemade chocolate cake with orange sauce. The wine list includes a vari-
ety of organic offerings. Service varies from downright warm to grumpy.

Le Kokolion
$–$$
Montmartre (18e)
CLASSIC FRENCH
A red facade and colored lights illuminate the entrance of this small and
adorable little French “resto.” Atmosphere is key here: Funky glass spheres
hang from the ceiling and provide some dim lighting, posters of old movies
and recent plays in the quarter are also displayed, along with the occa-
sional kitschy photograph. Open only for dinner, service can be slow once
it gets crowded. The food quality is even higher than the prices you pay.
A 24 ($40) dinner menu can start out with an os à moelle gratiné avec sel
du cuve ronde et toast (a beef bone-marrow casserole made with reservoir
salt) or aubergine grillé au chevre et tomates confits, sauce pistou (eggplant
grilled with goat’s cheese and preserved tomatoes in a basil, garlic, and
olive oil sauce); dinner could be a half a rooster roasted in tarragon gravy
served with homemade potato purée or rack of lamb roasted in an herbed
crust. Their wine list is great and inexpensive: Ask the Kevin Spacey look-
alike waiter for recommendations (he may be the only one present). The
desserts will unfortunately leave something to be desired (at these low
prices you can’t have everything!) so think about that before you decide
on a prix-fixe menu that includes dessert. The Kokolion closes late, as it
serves dinner to the after-theater crowd from the nearby Théâtre de
l’Atelier. You can start dining as late as midnight, but be warned that by 10
p.m., waiters can be slow.

Le Père Claude
$$
Eiffel Tower (5e)
CLASSIC BISTRO
The family that runs Le Père Claude does it with much love as evidenced
by the thoughtfully rustic outside (empty champagne barrels, a wagon
wheel, birch branches, and a bench) and the brown and cream interior
where pictures of waitstaff through the years adorn some of the walls. (The
restaurant even has its own jazz band with the names of its members on
the front door.) Expect to tuck into enormous portions of red meat dishes
here. Starters may include warm sausage with pistachios and apples, duck
liver pan fried with tortellini and morel mushrooms, and yes, cuisses 
de grenouilles (frogs’ legs). The panaché de viandes is an assortment of
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in Paris 153

perfectly roasted meats served with a comforting heap of mashed pota-
toes. Make sure you specify how you want the beef cooked, or it will be
served the way the French like it — bleu, which means very, very rare
(refer to Chapter 2 for more about how meat is cooked). Bouillabaisse is
the house special Thursday and Friday nights. President Jacques Chirac
and Don King have been spotted (separately) chowing down here, but it’s
usually home to families and, to a lesser extent, tourists with big appetites.
After dinner, you can stroll up the avenue de La Motte-Picquet and take in
a view of the spectacular illuminated Eiffel Tower.

L’Epi Dupin
$$
St-Germain-des-Prés (6e)
FRENCH
L’Epi Dupin is still perhaps the best of the bistros (see “Knowing the dif-
ference between a cafe and a bistro” earlier) and a good value as well. Chef
François Pasteau, pairs fine modern bistro cuisine with an antique French
setting of hewn beams and stone walls (tables are quite close together).
The food, which Pasteau buys fresh daily at the Rungis green market, runs
to traditional rural French, with lighter, modern alternatives such as salmon
carpaccio or endive tatin with goat cheese. Service, though friendly, can be
seriously rushed as staff scramble to accommodate three seatings a night.
See map p. 140. 11 rue de Dupin (between rue de Sèvres and rue du Cherche Midi).
% 01-42-22-64-56. Reservations strongly recommended. Métro: Sèvres Babylone.

$
Le Marais (3e)
VEGETARIAN
Privacy is out, and seating is at 13 tables pushed together at this vegetar-
ian restaurant steps from Centre Pompidou that gets so packed that reser-
vations are a must. The food, most of it organic, is generally very good.
The dining room is small with exposed stone walls, plants, and apricot
tones. Most of the offerings are organic and vegans can be accommodated.
You may start with a bowl of vegetarian French onion soup or eggplant
pâté and continue with a crouistillant des légumes (a cutlet made of veg-
etables) or shepherd’s pie or a fondue made up of leeks and Comté cheese.
A must for dessert is the fondant au chocolat with custard sauce. Browse

Maison Chardenoux

Bastille (11e)
CLASSIC BISTRO
This restaurant’s turn-of-the-20th-century décor is the very essence of old
Paris (it has been appointed a Monument Historique), and though out of
the way, a meal here is worth the trek to an uninteresting neighborhood.
A variety of French regional dishes are served in a dining room filled with
swirling stucco decorations and brightened by etched windows with lacy
curtains. The specialty of the house is tête de veau traditionelle (yes, that’s
calf’s head; the meat is served in a broth of vegetables, peppercorns, and
parsley); appetizers may include terine de canard maison avec pain grille
(duck pâté with toast), or escargots de bourgogne (snails prepared with
garlic, butter, and parsley). Main courses may include bar grille entire au
fenouil, haricots verts (whole fish grilled with fennel and served with green
beans) or foie de veau à échalote, écrasée de pommes de terre (veal liver
with shallots and mashed potatoes). Desserts are classically Gallic. Try

Keep it fresh: Eating veggie
Being a vegetarian can be challenging for those who also like dining out. Paris is no
exception: Everyone’s primary food group seems to be ham. Luckily for the vegans and
vegetarians among us, there are several places where one can eat fantastic French
food without involving any butchers. Below is a list of places to get vegetarian grub
during your time in Paris.
 Au Grain de Folies (24 rue de la Vieuville, 18e; % 01-42-58-15-57; Métro: Abbesses)
is a five-table restaurant that feels like you’re eating in someone’s kitchen. Soups,
veggie tarts, and homemade desserts leave nothing to be desired.
 Le Grenier de Notre-Dame (see earlier).
 Le Potager du Marais (see later).
 Though meat is on the menu here, you can get a veggie take out from Chez H’anna
(54 rue des Rosiers, 4e; % 01-42-74-74-99; Métro: St-Paul) that may include a mas-
sive falafel with a big cucumber and tomato salad on the side.
 Le Boutegrill Chez Hamadi (12 rue Boutebrie, 5e; % 01-43-54-03-30; Métro: St-
Michel) is a Tunisian restaurant that also prepares excellent couscous meals, one
of which is only stewed vegetables. Sip along with your meal a glass of Mascara,
a well regarded Algerian wine.
 Lemoni Café (5 rue Herold, 1er; % 01-45-08-49-84; Métro: Palais Royal or Bourse
or Les Halles) is a Greek-influenced organic (bio) lunch counter with a lot of veg-
etarian options and good value specials from 8.10 to 14 ($13–$22).
 Les Puits des Légumes (18 rue Cardinal Lemoine, 5e; % 01-43-25-50-95; Métro:

Restaurant du Palais-Royal
$$–$$$
Louvre (1er)
CLASSIC FRENCH
The elegant arcade that encircles the gardens inside the Palais-Royal also
surrounds this restaurant, making it one of the most romantic locations in
Paris. Service is lacking during midday, as it is a favorite lunch spot for
professionals working in the area; better to eat dinner here and avoid over-
worked waiters and waitresses. Sit at the terrace on warm, sun-filled days
and begin your meal with starters such as a beet and leek terrine or sar-
dines from the Midi Marinées accompanied by quinoa tabbouleh. Main
dishes vary with the season but may include veal à la Milanese with fresh
homemade pasta or Homard Breton de Notre Vivier Rôti et Beurre Coraillé
(whole roasted Breton lobster with coral butter). Risottos are also a spe-
cialty here. Try the good house red wine, served Lyonnaise-style in thick-
bottomed bottles. The desserts are delicious; the pistachio and chocolate
mille-feuille (puff pastry) and the petits beignets (little doughnuts) are
divine. When dining outside just isn’t an option, you can enjoy the dining
room that shines in tones of gold, silver, and garnet.

gain three-course lunch that may start with a goat cheese profiterole with
tomato coulis or marinated raw salmon slices with dill, followed by the
house specialty, chateaubriand (porterhouse steak) served in a variety of
ways, including with foie gras, or try the beef filet with green pepper.
Classic dishes such as duck confit and gigot d’agneau (leg of lamb) with
gratin Dauphinois (cheese-topped potatoes) are on the à la carte menu.

The order of the Knights of Malta once owned the Commanderie of
Peyrassol, and this petite restaurant serves and sells the wines that have
been made there, along with delicious Provençal dishes. Located on a
street where those who aren’t in the know flock to Le Grand Colbert, this
well-kept secret also serves regional truffles in most of its dishes in a rustic
atmosphere made up of exposed stone and brick, wood, and wine barrels.
You may start with a salad with two duck breasts on a bed of green beans
or a homemade truffled foie gras. Main courses include grilled tartines with
8 grams of black or brumale truffles or gnocchi served in a cream sauce of
brumale truffle. This is worth the visit, and you can buy many of the prod-
ucts sold here in their next-door shop.

St-Germain-des-Prés (6e)
MODERN BISTRO
William Ledeuil opened this hip and sophisticated place in 2002 near the
trendy Les Bookinistes, where he worked as chef. It is indeed an art gallery
and kitchen: The walls of the spacious and spare dining room feature as
their only decoration artwork that changes every three months. The inno-
vative, Asian-inspired menu, created from a tiny windowed kitchen at the
far side of the room, changes every five weeks. The menu is broken down
into soup and pasta starters and grilled main courses (à la plancha).
Starters may include a soup of snail and conchigli pasta flavored with a
horseradish-parsley emulsion or duck ravioli with Thai herbs. Mains may
be grilled milk-fed lamb shoulder served with a spicy tamarind and miso
condiment or grilled squid and octopus with green apple and curcuma.
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in Paris 157

Since portions are small, you’ll more than likely have room for dessert,
which may include tasty ginger-orange cake served with a blood-orange
sorbet. Reservations are recommended because this restaurant fills up fast.

Dining and Snacking on the Go
Face it: Who can sit down to multiple-course meals every day — even if
they are cooked by legendary chefs? Fortunately, many alternatives to a
full meal are available. Choose from street carts, sandwich places, and
tea salons. And of course, there’s that Parisian institution, the cafe.
Listed here are some of Paris’s best cafes and their more sophisticated
sisters, the wine bars where you, too, can join in the great French art of
people-watching!
See the “Light Meals in the Heart of the Right Bank” and “Light Meals in
the Heart of the Left Bank” maps for locations of establishments in this
section.
Partaking of Paris street food
Some street vendors sell Belgian waffles, called gaufres, served warm
with powdered sugar or chocolate sauce, but the Parisian street food you
see the most is the crêpe — a thin wheat pancake stuffed with a filling
that’s either salty or sweet. When served with savory fillings, such as
cheese or mushrooms, a street vendor may either call it a crêpe salé
(salted or savory), or a galette. A true galette, a specialty from Normandy,
is made with buckwheat and is only cooked on one side, unlike a tradi-
tional crêpe cooked on both sides. However it is cooked, both are deli-
cious and constitute a meal. Sweet crêpe fillings include plain powdered
sugar, chocolate-hazelnut spread, ice cream, or jam (called compote).
Talk about a sugar rush!
You can find stalls or carts selling crêpes near most of the major attrac-
tions, in the parks and bigger gardens, and along the rue de Rivoli
between the Marais and the place de la Concorde. When you buy a crêpe
from a street vendor, you won’t have much of a choice of sweet fillings;
for a more extensive menu visit a crêperie.
Make a meal of crêpes at one of the many good establishments on rue
du Montparnasse, where you can settle down in a peaceful atmosphere
with a bowl of cider (a Breton specialty), a galette for a main course, and
a crêpe for dessert — usually under 12 ($19) a person (Métro: Edgar
Quinet or Montparnasse-Bienvenüe).
The other typical Parisian street food, panini, is also sold just about any-
where. Named for the Italian-style bread with which they’re made, panini
Part III: Settling into Paris 
158

can be almost any filling stuck between two slices of bread, then flat-
tened and grilled between two hot plates. The most common fillings are
mozzarella, basil, and sun-dried tomatoes (a pizza sandwich, if you will).
Panini are cheap, tasty, and easy to eat on the run.
Snacking on sandwiches
Even sandwiches are delicious in France. Sandwich (and more) shops
Lina’s, Cosi, and Le Pain Quotidien, open until the early evening, make
their own breads. Following is a list of sandwich shops you may want 
to try:
 Cosi, 54 rue de Seine, 6e (% 01-46-33-35-36; Métro: St-Germain-des-
Prés; see map p. 162), has branched out across the ocean and now
has locations around the U.S. and U.K. It serves its sandwiches on
delicious homemade flatbread, and fillings are plentiful and deli-
cious. You can even build your own salads if you want — this place
is a bit of New York–style service in the heart of Paris.
 Le Pain Quotidien, 18 place du Marché-St-Honoré, 1er (% 01-42-
96-31-70; Métro: Tuileries; see map p. 160), like Cosi, now has
stores in other countries. It’s part of a Belgian chain serving mouth-
watering tartines (open-faced sandwiches) made with combinations
such as country ham and Gruyère, a goat-cheese-and-honey duo; or
a combination of tuna, hummus, and fresh vegetables. The fresh
salads here are also a good choice. There are five locations all
around Paris; one is in the Marais at 18 rue des Archives, 4e (% 01-
44-54-03-07) and another is in the Latin Quarter, not far from the
Panthéon at 138 rue Mouffetard, 5e (% 01-55-43-91-99).
 Lina’s, 22 rue St-Pères, 6e (% 01-40-20-42-78; Métro: St-Germain-
des-Prés; see map p. 160), packs an assortment of fillings onto
whole-grain breads and rolls, American deli–style. Other locations
are at 15 rue du Louvre, 1er (% 01-40-41-15-00), and 1 bd. de
Courcelles, 8e (% 01-40-08-01-00), not far from the designer 
boutiques.
 Pomme de Pain, 76 rue de Rivoli, 4e (% 01-42-78-57-29; Métro:
Hôtel de Ville; see map p. 160), boasts a fast-food-style counter
where staff slice baguettes in half and layer on the toppings of your
choice. The menu specials (a sandwich, potato or dessert, and one
drink) are usually a fair deal. Branches are located all across the
city, including one at 2 bd. Haussmann, 9e (% 01-48-24-20-60), and
another at 1-7 rue Pierre Lescot, Basement level 3, Forum des
Halles, 1er (% 01-40-39-94-63).
Assembling a picnic, Parisian style
Grab a crusty baguette or two, some dried sausage, a wedge of cheese,
and a few pieces of fruit and head to the nearest park or to a garden that
strikes your fancy. Picnicking in Paris can be as fun and as unforgettable
as a meal in a three-star restaurant at just a fraction of the cost. In this

section, discover where to stock up on provisions. (Note: You can also
assemble picnic fixings cheaply at Parisian supermarkets all across the
city.)
The traiteurs (gourmet food shops)
Look for the word traiteur, which designates a food shop that sells 
ready-made meat, pasta, and salad dishes. The two most famous,
Fauchon and Hédiard, have main stores at place de la Madeleine, 8e
(Métro: Madeleine), and branches all across Paris. Every neighborhood
has several good traiteurs so be on the lookout, and don’t hesitate to ask
your hotel staff for recommendations.
 Fauchon, 30 place de la Madeleine, 8e (% 01-70-39-38-00; Métro:
Madeleine; see map p. 160), was founded in 1886. This is the high-
end food shop with everything from foie gras and Norwegian
smoked salmon to caviar to fancy breads and cheeses. Their
épicerie and cave together will entirely stock your picnic basket.
Open Monday to Saturday 9 a.m. to 8 p.m.
 Hédiard, 21 place de la Madeleine, 8e (% 01-43-12-88-88; Métro:
Madeleine; see map p. 160), is a gourmet food shop that sells
upscale products, wine, and ready-made food to go. Open Monday
to Saturday from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m.
 Lafayette Gourmet, 48 bd. Haussmann, 9e (% 01-42-82-34-56, or
01-42-81-25-61; Métro: Havre-Caumartin; see map p. 160), is another
wonderful grocery store that has everything you need for a picnic.
It’s located smack in the middle of the Galeries Lafayette complex
(in the men’s store). Open Monday to Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to
7:30 p.m.; open Thursday until 9 p.m.
 La Grande Épicerie, Le Bon Marché, 38 rue de Sèvres, 7e (% 01-44-
39-81-00; Métro: Sèvres-Babylone; see map p. 162), may be the best
grocery store on the Left Bank. It has large traiteur and wine depart-
ments and sells everything from cleaning supplies to gourmet
chocolate to fresh fish. Picnics just aren’t complete without fresh
salad expertly measured and mixed from this foodie wonderland.
Open Monday to Saturday from 8:30 a.m. to 9 p.m.
 Lenoire, 10 rue St-Antoine, 4e (% 01-53-01-91-91; Métro: Bastille),
is an up-and-coming chain with locations around the city. Especially
good are its chocolates and exquisite little desserts. Open Monday
to Saturday 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.
The street markets
Every neighborhood in Paris has its street market, and it’s probably the
best place to find the freshest produce, cheeses of excellent quality, and
other picnic supplies. Even when you don’t buy anything, visiting one or
two is worth the authentic reflection of Parisian society you encounter.
Markets are generally open from Tuesday through Saturday, from around
7 a.m. to 1 p.m., and of course, the pickings are better the earlier you go.
Part III: Settling into Paris 
164

The ones open on Sunday are indicated. Some of the more well known
include:
 Marché Bastille, 11e (Métro: Bastille; see map p. 160): This huge
market sells everything from game, cheese, and vegetables to fish
and condiments. Open Thursday from 7 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and
Sunday 7 a.m. to 3 p.m.
 Marché Biologique, boulevard Raspail between rue du Cherche-
Midi and rue de Rennes, 6e (Métro: Rennes; see map p. 162): This
all-organic market features greengrocers, winemakers, butchers,
and bakers. Open Sunday 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. An “inorganic” market
takes place here Tuesday and Friday from 7 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.
 Place Monge, 5e (Métro: Monge): One of the oldest markets in Paris
on one of the city’s more interesting streets. Sing along with accor-
dion players on Sunday mornings. Open Wednesday and Friday
between 7:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m., 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Sundays.
 Rue Cler, 7e (Métro: Ecole-Militaire; see map p. 162): See how diplo-
mats shop for their dinner in this chic market. Open Tuesday
through Saturday mornings between 8:30 a.m. and 1 p.m. and again
from 5 to 7 p.m. Sundays open only in the morning up to noon.
 Rue de Buci, 6e (Métro: Odéon; see map p. 162): This lively market
is close to all the Latin Quarter action. Open Tuesday to Sunday
mornings between 8 a.m. and noon.
 Rue Montorgueil, 1er (Métro: Les Halles/Châtelet; see map p. 160):
Have breakfast at one of the many sidewalk cafes before choosing
your produce. Open Tuesday through Saturday from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m.
and 4 to 7 p.m.
 Rue Poncelet, 17e (Métro: Ternes; see map p. 160): The Poncelet
market is especially renowned for its fresh fruit stalls. Open
Tuesday through Saturday mornings between 8:30 a.m. and noon
and again from 2:30 until 6 p.m.
The best bakeries
You want a fresh baguette for your picnic, and you can find bakeries
(boulangeries) on nearly every corner in residential neighborhoods.
Keep in mind that quality of the breads varies considerably.
Long lines of locals on weekend mornings or evenings before dinner give
away the best bakeries. You can get a sandwich or a quiche to go, but be
warned that bakeries here offer what seem to be very plain sandwiches —
often just a slice of bread or cheese on a baguette with no condiment or
other accoutrement. If you want a sandwich with more filling, look for the
name of an ingredient plus “crudités,” which means that it comes with raw
vegetables, usually lettuce, cucumbers, or even tomatoes, and mayon-
naise). For a chicken sandwich with raw veggies, for example, ask for
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in Paris 165

poulet crudités (poo-lay crew-dee-tay). Below are some of Paris’s best 
bakeries.
 BE (Boulangepicier), 73 bd. de Courcelles, 8e; % 01-46-22-20-20.
Open Monday to Saturday from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Métro: Courcelles
or Ternes; see map p. 160.
 Bonneau, 75 rue d’Auteuil, 16e; % 01-46-51-12-25. Open Tuesday
through Sunday from 6:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. Métro: Michel-Ange-
Auteuil; see map p. 162.
 Boulangerie Kayser (organic), 14 rue Monge, 5e; % 01-44-07-17-81.
Open Tuesday through Sunday 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Métro: Maubert
Mutualité; see map p. 162.
 Boulangerie Kayser (traditional), 8 rue Monge, 5e; % 01-44-07-
01-42. Open Wednesday through Monday from 6:30 a.m. to 8:30
p.m. Métro: Maubert Mutualité; see map p. 162.
 Caumont, 33 rue Coquillière, 1e; % 01-45-08-57-60. Open Monday
through Friday from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.
 Le Grenier au Pain, 38 rue des Abbesses, 18e; % 01-46-06-41-81.
Open Friday through Tuesday, from 7:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. Métro:
Abbesses.
 Moulin de la Vierge, 166 av. de Suffren, 15e; % 01-47-83-45-55.
Open Friday to Wednesday from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Métro: Sèvres-
Lecourbe; see map p. 162.
 Poilâne, 8 rue du Cherche-midi, 6e; % 01-45-48-42-59. Open
Monday to Saturday from 7:15 a.m. to 8:15 p.m. Métro: St-Sulpice 
or Sèvres Babylone; see map p. 160.
There are so many different types of bread available in these bakeries
that a complete list would probably be impossible to compile accurately.
However, the most common is the baguette — long, fat, and crispy. If
you’re feeling a little adventurous, spend a euro and change, instead of
the requisite 85 centimes, on a baguette de campagne, à l’ancienne, or de
tradition. These names mean that the baguette dough, which is prepared
by hand, is left overnight in order to let the yeast develop. The result is a
much more flavorful and chewier interior with an off-white, more rustic
look than the simple white-interior baguettes. The extra 20 to 40 cen-
times will go a long way. Look for boulangeries that say ARTISINAL, which
means that they prepare all of their goods on the spot: These places sell
pastries and bread with a mouthwatering taste that cannot be described
in any language!
Watching the world go by at a cafe
Compiled here are some of my favorite cafes — places where you’ll be
comfortable reading the paper, writing postcards, people-watching, and
soaking up the city’s atmosphere while relaxing with a cup of coffee, a
glass of wine or beer, or a sandwich, salad, or traditional French specialty
Part III: Settling into Paris 
166

like pot-au-feu (beef boiled with vegetables). Cafes are generally open
from about 8 a.m. until 1 a.m., and most take MasterCard and Visa.
Au Bistro de La Place
This square on the place du Marché Sainte-Catherine is a pedestrian zone
on the site of an 18th-century market, and this cafe’s plant-covered terrace
is the prettiest of all the bistros here. The food is terrific; you may find
fresh vegetable soup served hot or cold or an artichoke pâté with salad,
topped off with butter-browned salmon served with a saffron sauce. Even
if you don’t come here for a meal, visit during the afternoon to enjoy a
leisurely drink or pastry on the terrace.
See map p. 160. 2 place du Marché Sainte-Catherine (between rue de Turenne and
rue de Sevigné), 4e. % 01-42-78-21-32. Métro: St-Paul. Closed Fri.
Au Rendez-Vous des Amis
The ultramodern décor of so many Marais establishments has been left
behind in favor of wood counters and well-worn chairs, with simple sketches
and old photos on the walls. A hot goat cheese salad with some red wine 
is mouthwatering, and the people-watching on the chic rue Saint-Croix de 
la Bretonnerie is never boring. There are good wines by the glass starting at
4 ($6.40).

Café Beaubourg
This cafe overlooking the Centre Pompidou used to be the first word in
hip, but now it’s more of a hangout for the tourists visiting the site, about
60m (200 ft.) away. The backs of its white terrace chairs still resemble the
lips in the Stravinsky Fountain just around the corner. The dark bi-level
interior has large circular columns that soar to an illuminated ceiling and
the walls are filled with books. A small wooden bridge spans the upper
part of the cafe and leads to quieter, artistically designed tables. Tourist-
filled or not, it’s still a good place to recover with a beverage and a quick
bite after perusing the attractions of the modern art museum next door.

de-Ville.
Café de Flore
In the heart of St-Germain-des-Prés, this cafe will always be popular, even
though the famous writers have moved on and its prices are high. Sartre is
said to have written Les Chemins de la Liberté (The Roads to Freedom) at his
table here, and he and Simone de Beauvoir saw people by appointment
here. Other regulars included André Malraux and Guillaume Apollinaire.
Paris’s leading intellectual bookstore, La Hune, is right next door.

Café de la Place
If you’re headed out of Paris via the Gare Montparnasse and you have a 
bit of extra time, skip the train station food stalls and come to this old-
fashioned cafe overlooking small, tree-lined place Edgar Quinet, just around
the corner and down the street. It’s a calm and popular spot for young
neighborhood residents. Browse the menu of inexpensive bistro special-
ties, or opt for a simple sandwich and a glass of wine. If you’re lucky, there
will be a brocante (flea market) or art fair in the square across the street.
See map p. 162. 23 rue d’Odessa, 14e. % 01-42-18-01-55. Métro: Edgar-Quinet.
Café de l’Industrie
This cafe is young, friendly, casual, and extremely popular; so much so
that at night the crowd constantly overflows to the sidewalks next door
and even across the street. To capitalize on its popularity, Café de
l’Industrie bought its next-door neighbor and the former Moroccan restau-
rant across the street. Mod meets retro meets country in the spacious
rooms that also have a vaguely colonial flavor. Hip Bastille denizens drift
in and out all day. Bartenders like to mix “specialties,” and if you ask for
one with a winning smile, you may get a reduced price.

% 01-47-00-13-53. Métro: Breguet-Sabin or Bastille.
Café les Deux Magots
Like its neighbor, Café de Flore, Café les Deux Magots was a hangout for
Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir. The intellectuals met here in the 1950s,
and Sartre wrote at his table every morning. Hemingway also haunted this
place (when he had the money to do so, at least). With prices that start 
at 4.40 ($7.05) for coffee, the cafe is an expensive place for literary-
intellectual pilgrims, but a great spot to watch the nightly promenade on
the boulevard St-Germain.
See map p. 162. 6 place St-Germain-des-Prés, 6e. % 01-45-48-55-25. Métro: St-
Germain-des-Prés.
Café Mabillon
If you only have one night in Paris, make the most of it and welcome the
dawn at Café Mabillon, which stays open all night. During the day, pleas-
ant lounge music draws the young and hip as well as older BCBG locals,
who dine in fantastic outfits that you’d be afraid to spill food on. If you’re
hungry, try the ravioli with foie gras; it’s to die for. Or just have a café or
glass of wine and relax on the outdoor terrace or in the ultramodern inte-
rior. At night the music changes to techno and electro, and the bordello-
red banquettes fill with a wide assortment of night owls. As dawn
approaches, the sound drops to a level just loud enough to keep you from
dozing off in your seat.

Café Marly
This is one of the prettiest cafes in Paris and its location can’t be beat.
Sinking into one of the plush red chairs here amid high ceilings, warmly
painted pastel walls, and luxurious sofa chairs with a drink or cup of tea
is the best antidote to Louvre fatigue! This stunning cafe has a gorgeous
view of the glass pyramid that is the museum’s main entrance. You almost
forget food is served here, but that would be a mistake — it’s very good,
if not abundant. It’s on the expensive side, but that is normal considering
your location. Enjoy the exquisite lighting on the pyramid and surround-
ing 18th-century facades from the outdoor balcony. After 8 p.m., seating
is for dinner only.

Métro: Palais-Royal-Musée du Louvre.
Fouquet’s
This 20th-century Parisian institution is the place with the red umbrellas on
the Champs-Elysées, not far from the Arc de Triomphe, and counts such
patrons as James Joyce, Charlie Chaplin, Marlene Dietrich, Winston
Churchill, Franklin D. Roosevelt, François Truffaut, Claude Chabrol, and Jean-
Luc Godard. Opened in 1899, it is now registered as a historic monument.
See map p. 160. 99 av. des Champs-Elysées, 8e. % 01-47-23-50-00. Métro: George V.
La Chaise au Plafond
This friendly, stylish place tucked away on a pedestrian-only side street in
the heart of the Marais is always packed. Maybe that’s because it’s the per-
fect spot to refuel after visiting the Musée Picasso. It serves enormous
salads, imaginative sandwiches, and thick tartes to a local crowd sprinkled
with tourists in the know. The menu and kitchen here are the same as
another well known cafe just around the corner, les Philosophes, but la
Chaise au Plafond has more personality and more twinkly-eyed waiters.
See map p. 160. 10 rue Trésor, 4e. % 01-42-76-03-22. Métro: Hôtel-de-Ville.
La Contrescarpe
The dimly lit book-filled interior here is perfect for an intimate tête-à-tête,
while the tables outside, which overlook four lilac trees and a fountain,
seem to seat a more boisterous clientele. This is a good place to take a
break after marketing on rue Mouffetard or visiting the nearby Panthéon.
The 15 ($24) menu is a good deal.
See map p. 162. 57 rue Lacépède, 5e. % 01-43-36-82-88. Métro: Cardinal Lemoine.
La Coupole
The more things change, the more they stay the same at this Lost
Generation cafe that has been packing them in for nearly a century. Henry
Miller came here for his morning porridge, and now Japanese business
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in Paris 169

people, French yuppies, models, tourists, and neighborhood regulars keep
the frenzied waiters running until 2 a.m. The food is good, too, though
prices are high. There’s dancing downstairs on the weekends.
See map p. 162. 102 bd. Montparnasse, 14e. % 01-43-20-14-20. Métro: Vavin.
Le Comptoir du Relais St-Germain
This tiny cafe on a narrow sidewalk right off boulevard St-Germain serves
restaurant-class meals and quick pick-me-ups: You can get cheese or char-
cuterie with a traditionally made baguette while you sip some house red
wine, but also try their chicken cream soup with spices — mmm. Le
Comptoir is perfectly situated in the carrefour de l’Odéon where you can
watch Left Bank habitués and students walk by, or wave to the people in
the Horse’s Tavern and Café les Éditeurs across the street.
See map p. 162. 9 carrefour de l’Odéon, 6e. % 01-46-33-45-30. Métro: Odéon.
Le Progrès
Situated near the footsteps of Sacre Coeur, le Progrès is quirky and simple
and almost always packed. The benches and closely arranged tables put
funky and bohemian locals next to tourists, all served by a youthful staff
who yell jokes back and forth over the midday din. A croque jeune homme
(their tongue-in-cheek name for a croque-monsieur) is only 8 ($13), or
you can just sip wine while watching the denizens of Montmartre pass you
by. During the winter, their vin chaud (hot wine, with spices) will chase
away the Parisian chill.

Anvers.
L’Eté en Pente Douce
To find this cute cafe away from Montmartre’s tourist hordes, turn right
after exiting the funiculaire, and take the first set of steps leading down to
a leafy square facing a small park. The terrace here looks out on stairs and
iron lamps once painted by Montmartre artist Utrillo, and someone almost
always performs here for the captive audience. The interior is brightly dec-
orated with painted borders of leaves and plants, mosaics, unusual objets
d’art, and a painted ceiling. Between lunch and dinner, the restaurant
serves tea, pastries, and sandwiches.
See map p. 160. 23 rue Muller, 18e. % 01-42-64-02-67. Métro: Chateau-Rouge.
L’Étoile Manquante
Located on a street known for funky cafes like Café des Philosophes and
its neighbor, Au Pétit Fer à Cheval, this is a modern, tasteful, and fun place
that hosts all kinds of locals, artists, and writers who enjoy reasonably
priced, somewhat inventive and tasty food in an atmosphere that whis-
pers rather than shouts “cool.” Little stars in the floor tiles twinkle in the
dim light from recessed round ceiling lights outlined in brown circles and
Part III: Settling into Paris 
170

from baguette-shaped sconces with artfully placed tiny holes to let the
light through. The vibrant scene is reflected in the wall of rectangular mir-
rors in the back of the restaurant. A visit to the very dark bathrooms lit
from above by “starlight” is a must.
See map p. 160. 34 rue e Vieille du Temple, 4e. % 01-42-72-48-34. Métro: Hôtel de
Ville or St-Paul.
Le Sancerre
This is one of Montmartre’s cheaper cafes located on rue des Abbesses
where you can sit and watch the passing citizens of Montmartre in their
hipster gear. They have great croque-monsieurs if you’re hungry, or order
a café and contemplate your next artistic endeavor like the other people
sitting at neighboring tables. This lively place can get packed, so you may
want to stop by late afternoon when things are calm.
See map p. 162. 35 rue des Abbesses, 18e. % 01-42-58-0-20.
Pause Café
This cantine du quartier (neighborhood canteen) with lemon-colored out-
door tables is almost always full, and if it’s nighttime, the patrons are most
likely stopping in for drinks on their way to a night of dancing. A bright-
colored, modern interior with hanging light fixtures also features found
art, while outdoors is made tropical with cloth and bamboo umbrellas and
potted palms. The food is fresh and tasty.
See map p. 160. 41 rue de Charonne, 11e. % 01-48-06-80-33. Métro: Lédru-Rollin.
Steeping and sipping at a tea salon (Salons de thé)
Sitting down to tea in Paris can be an elegant and refined undertaking, or
a relaxing break between bouts of shopping and musée-hopping. The tea
salons have a wide range of blends, steeped to perfection, and the pastry
selections are usually excellent (Ladurée’s macaroons are world-famous).
Save your full meals, however, for a restaurant because tea salons tend
to be expensive.

A heady mix of wine bars
Paris’s wine bars have a good selection of wines by the glass, and tasty
light meals served all day in pleasant surroundings. These places are
often a cozy and sophisticated alternative to the cafe.
À La Cloche des Halles
Look closely at the exterior for the bell that once tolled the opening and
closing of the vast food market for which this neighborhood was named.
This tiny bar and cafe is packed at lunchtime so you might want to go late
afternoon. Patrons dine on plates of jambon (ham) or homemade quiche
accompanied by a carafe of wine, and maybe the tarte tatin for dessert.
It’s convivial and fun, but very noisy and crowded, just like the rest of the
quarter during the day. If you can’t find a seat, you can usually stand at
the bar and eat.
See map p. 160. 28 rue Coquillière, 1er. % 01-42-36-93-89. Métro: Les Halles or Palais-
Royal-Musée du Louvre. Mon–Fri 8 a.m.–10 p.m., Sat 10 a.m.–5 p.m.
Au Négociant
You may walk right past this tiny wine bar the first time, so make sure to
retrace your steps. Wine by the glass is reasonable, and the excellent pâtés
and terrines are homemade and served with fresh, chewy bread.
Photographer Robert Doisneau (Le Baiser de l’Hôtel de Ville) was a regular.
See map p. 160. 27 rue Lambert, 18e. % 01-46-06-15-11. Métro: Château-Rouge or
Lamarck-Caulincourt. Mon–Fri noon–2:30 p.m., Tues–Thurs 6:30–10:30 p.m.
Clown Bar
Founded in 1904, this place became a second home three years later 
to circus people working at the Cirque de l’Hiver next door who would con-
gregate here and drop off letters to be mailed. There’s a zinc bar decorated
Part III: Settling into Paris 
172

with a mélange of circus posters and circus-themed ceramic tiles and stat-
ues. (One bust eerily resembles Jack Nicholson.) The wine list features an
extensive selection of French offerings from the Rhone and Languedoc.
See map p. 160. 114 rue Amelot, 11e. % 01-43-55-87-35. Métro: Filles du Calvaire.
Mon–Sat noon–2:30 p.m. and 7 p.m.–1 a.m.
La Tartine
It underwent a renovation in the early 2000s that took away its gritty char-
acter (new toilets and a fresh coat of paint made this a new place), and
now La Tartine is simply another wine bar, albeit in a good location on rue
de Rivoli. It’s relaxed and comfortable and a mix of working class and well
heeled frequent it. You can get a light lunch of goat cheese salad, or a pick-
me-up of tartine (open-faced sandwich), cheese, or charcuterie (assorted
sliced meats) plate along with one of many wines by the glass.
See map p. 160. 24 rue de Rivoli, 4e. % 01-42-72-76-85. Métro: St-Paul. Wed–Mon
noon–10 p.m.
Le Bistrot du Peintre
The doors are Art Nouveau and the bar is zinc at this cozy place where
painters, actors, and night crawlers hang out. The delicious and reasonably
priced food, wood paneling, large terrace, and superb belle époque atmos-
phere make this wine bar a highlight. The wine selection is affordable — an
added bonus.
See map p. 160. 116 av. Ledru-Rollin, 11e. % 01-47-00-34-39. Métro: Ledru-Rollin.
Daily 9 a.m.–2 a.m. (the kitchen closes at midnight).
L’Écluse
L’Écluse is casually chic, authentic, and conveniently located smack in the
middle of St-Germain. Have one of its 20 wines by the glass and a light bite
such as carpaccio, salad, or soup.
See map p. 162. 15 quai des Grands-Augustins, 6e. % 01-46-33-58-74. Métro: St-
Michel. Daily 11:30 a.m.–1 a.m.
Le Griffonnier
The kitchen staff at Le Griffonnier deliver first-rate cuisine, and the wine
cellar is superb. Sample the entree du jour such as their boeuf bourguignon
(beef stewed with red wine, onions, mushrooms, and bacon), or try a
hearty plate of charcuterie (regional sliced meats), terrines, and cheese,
usually from the Auvergne region of central France, and ask your waiter
to recommend the wine. Hot meals are served at lunchtime Monday to
Friday (until 3:30 p.m.) and Monday nights.
See map p. 160. 8 rue des Saussaies, 8e. % 01-42-65-17-17. Métro: Champs-Elysées-
Clemenceau. Mon–Fri 8 a.m.–9 p.m.
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in Paris 173

Le Sancerre
Don’t be put off by the unstylish interior which consists of a wooden bar
with stools losing some of their caning. Le Sancerre is a wonderful place
to unwind for a light meal or glass of wine after visiting the Eiffel Tower.
Loire wines are the specialty here, including, of course, Sancerre. The
friendly manager and bartender will discuss the best accompaniments for
his wines. Typically French items are on the menu here, such as omelets
of all varieties with a side of fried potatoes. Specials change all the time,
so ask as well: The last sitting included a tasty house salad of Auvergne
bleu cheese, tomatoes, and walnuts. The more adventurous can sample
the ubiquitous andouillette, the sausage that is decidedly an acquired
taste.
See map p. 162. 22 av. Rapp, 7e. % 01-45-51-75-91. Métro: Alma Marceau. Mon–Fri
8 a.m.–10 p.m., Sat 8 a.m.–4 p.m.
Mélac
If only this wine bar wasn’t so out of the way in a neighborhood with not
much to recommend it. But owner Jacques Mélac has an excellent selec-
tion of wine from nearly all the regions of France, which he dispenses to a
lively crowd of regulars. He’s happy to give you recommendations. Usually
a hot plat du jour is available for lunch, but you can feast on a selection of
first-rate pâtés, terrines, charcuterie (regional sliced meats), and cheeses
all day.

9 a.m.–2 p.m., Tues–Sat 9 a.m.–10:30 p.m.
Taverne Henri IV
You can visit this authentic, old-fashioned bar for a quick pick-me-up after
a Seine boat cruise. Although on the expensive side, the wine and food are
excellent. The variety of wines by the glass can accompany open-faced
sandwiches, pâtés, and such cheeses as Cantal and Auvergne blue.

Mon–Fri 11:30 a.m.–10 p.m., Sat noon–6 p.m. Closed Aug.
Willi’s Wine Bar
This has been a favorite of tourists and locals since its opening in 1980.
An upscale crowd have sampled more than 250 different varieties of wine
while seated at the polished oak bar or have dined in the high-ceilinged
oak-beamed dining room from a prix-fixe menu starting at 20 ($31). Each
year the owners commission an image relating to wine from an artist, and
the colorful paintings are available for sale as prints.

Getting the scoop on Paris ice cream
If Paris doesn’t have the best ice cream flavors in the world, it must run
a close second. Such flavors (rhubarb, plum, cassis, honey nut . . .)! Ask
for a cornet seule (kor-nay sul; single-scoop cone) or cornet double (kor-
nay doobl; double scoop) — even the cone is yummy. Parisians cite
Berthillon, 31 rue St-Louis-en-l’Ile, 4e (% 01-43-54-31-61; Métro: Cité;
see map p. 160) as the best in the city, but the following establishments
also put soft-serve to shame. Although Berthillon closes from July 15
through the first week in September, a note on the door directs cus-
tomers to other nearby shops that sell its ice cream. Le Flore en l’Ile,
42 quai d’Orléans, 4e (% 01-43-29-88-27; Métro: Cité), a restaurant and
salon de thé, always has an outside station to buy Berthillon ice cream. A
chain of ice cream parlors called Amorino (locations listed below) also
boasts excellent ice cream in numerous flavors (for pure ingenuity try
the grapefruit).

Part IV
Exploring Paris

In this part . . . 
S
o many things to see in Paris . . . what do you do ﬁrst . . .
and how long will it take? Chapter 11 tells you a bit about
what’s worth seeing; lists some more cool things to see and
do for kids, teens, history buffs, and art and literature lovers;
and suggests gardens and parks to relax in after visiting all
those museums. You also ﬁnd here guided-tour options, from
buses to bicycles! Chapter 12 describes today’s shopping
scene in Paris, previews four great shopping neighborhoods,
covers the outdoor markets, and provides reviews of local
shops of interest. In Chapter 13, you have the chance to dis-
cover Paris in four itineraries and a walking tour. And just
when you’re getting used to Paris, Chapter 14 sends you away
on one of ﬁve popular day trips in the Ile-de-France region.

Chapter 11
Discovering Paris’s 
Best Attractions
In This Chapter
 Exploring Paris’s top attractions
 Finding sights and activities for all types of interests
 Considering a guided tour
I
n Paris, you are never at a loss for something to see, and this chapter
starts you off with a succinct review of 20 of the city’s top attractions,
giving you the lowdown on when to go, how to get there, and why to
visit it in the first place.
Before you leave, log onto www.weather.com and look at the extended
forecast for Paris. Or when you arrive, pick up a copy of the International
Herald Tribune or USA TODAY’s international edition for extended
weather forecasts and save museum visits for rainy days. (Keep in mind
that most museums close on Mon or Tues and admission is free the first
Sun of the month at national museums. On free days, be prepared to
wait in long lines.) For a list of suggestions of what else to do on rainy
days in Paris, see Chapter 17 in the Part of Tens.
Paris’s Top Sights
Paris is synonymous with the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, the Arc de
Triomphe, and you’re probably planning to see at least one of them. A
word of advice: Figure out which sights you would be heartbroken to
miss, and plan to do those first. After that, if you have the flexibility,
improvise! There’s so much to see that you’ll reorder your itinerary
daily. This chapter gives you an idea of what’s out there.

Arc de Triomphe
Champs-Elysées (8e)
The Arc de Triomphe represents victory to the French, although it has also
witnessed the agony of defeat, as in 1871 when Paris was seized by the
Prussians during the Franco-Prussian War, and in 1940 when Nazi armies
marched victoriously through the arch and down the Champs-Elysées.
Napoléon commissioned the Arc to honor his army and its 128 victorious
battles. Today it houses the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, which was ded-
icated in 1921 to honor the 1,500,000 French soldiers who died during
World War I. The panoramic view is the real attraction for visitors to the
Arc de Triomphe, where joyous French citizens have celebrated every-
thing from the end of World War II and their liberation to winning the World
(soccer) Cup in 1998. From the top, 49m (162 ft.) up, you can see in a
straight line the Champs-Elysées, the obelisk in the place de la Concorde,
and the Louvre. Twelve streets and avenues, named for Napoleonic bat-
tles and war heroes, radiate out from the Arc. That big cube at the far end
is the Grande Arche de la Défense in St-Denis, built to be the modern equiv-
alent to this arch. Every year, the last day of the Tour de France sees the
racers riding up the Champs and around the Arc in a series of laps before
the victor is declared. An eternal flame beneath the Arc pays tribute to the
lost soldiers and is symbolically relit every evening at 6:30 p.m. Allow an
hour to visit, an hour and a half in high summer.
Don’t try to cross to the Arc de Triomphe on surface streets! Attempting
to dodge the warp-speed traffic zooming around the Arc will likely get you
seriously hurt. Instead, use one of the clearly marked entrances to the
underpass beneath the Arc, which you find on surrounding streets.
Buy your ticket at the end of the underpass from a clerk in a small booth,
and then climb the stairs to find yourself standing at the base of the Arc
near the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. You have two choices to reach the

Saving on seeing the sights
One of the best bargains for tourists visiting Paris is the Paris Museum Pass, which
offers free and unlimited admission to over 60 of the top sights of Paris and the Ile-de-
France. The card also promises no waiting in admission lines, but you still have to
stand in line for security checkpoints at the museums that have them. Note: The pass
is not accepted at the Eiffel Tower. It’s offered in three versions: a two-consecutive-
day pass (30/$48), a four-consecutive-day pass (45/$72), and a six-consecutive-
day pass (60/$96). The biggest benefit is that you don’t have to wait in line at most
museums and monuments! You just saunter up to a separate window, and they wave
you through. You can buy the pass at Charles de Gaulle airport in the tourist informa-
tion areas in terminal 1 and in 2F, 2C, and 2D, any branch of the tourist office, at most
museums and monuments, and at any Fnac store (a French chain store selling elec-
tronics and music), one of which is located conveniently at 74, Champs-Elysées.

top: by a set of more than 250 winding steps or by an elevator. The line for
the stairs is always shorter. Both stairs and elevator lead to the small inte-
rior museum and store on the Arc’s top floor. To get to the outdoor view-
ing platform you need to climb another flight of narrow steps; the viewing
platform is not wheelchair accessible.
Keep in mind that on busy days, there will be a line of people in the under-
pass waiting to buy tickets. Go early if you’re visiting during the height of
tourist season.

Cathédral de Notre-Dame
Ile de la Cité (4e)
“Our Lady of Paris” is the heart and soul of the city, the Gothic church con-
structed between the 12th and 14th centuries that dominates the Seine
and the Ile de la Cité, as well as the history of Paris. Notre-Dame is a study
in Gothic beauty and gargoyles, at once solid with squat, square facade
towers and graceful with flying buttresses around the sides. It’s been
remodeled, embellished, ransacked, and restored so often that it’s a
wonder it still has any architectural integrity at all (during the Revolution,
it was even stripped of its religion and rechristened the Temple of Reason).
Construction of Notre-Dame (see the nearby “Notre-Dame de Paris” map)
started in 1163 when Pope Alexander III laid the cornerstone and was com-
pleted in 1330. Built in an age of illiteracy, the cathedral windows tell the
stories of the Bible in its portals, paintings, and stained glass. Angry citi-
zens pillaged Notre-Dame during the French Revolution, mistaking reli-
gious statues above the portals on the west front for representations of
kings and beheading them. (To see the statues removed by revolutionar-
ies visit the Cluny Museum. See the write-up later in this chapter.)
Nearly 100 years later, after Notre-Dame had been turned into a barn,
writer Victor Hugo and other artists called attention to its dangerous state
of disrepair and architect Viollet-le-Duc began the much-needed restora-
tion. He designed Notre-Dame’s spire, a new feature, and Baron Haussmann
(Napoléon III’s urban planner) tore down the houses cluttering the views
of the cathedral.
Visiting Notre-Dame takes a good hour to 90 minutes. The highlight for kids
will undoubtedly be climbing the 387 narrow and winding steps to the top
of one of the towers for a fabulous view of the gargoyles and of Paris (set
aside at least 45 min. for this, more during high tourist season). And note
that the entrance to the towers is outside the cathedral on the left side of
the facade on rue du Cloître-Notre Dame. If you plan to visit the tower, go
early in the morning! Lines stretch down the square in front of the cathedral
and outside the towers’ entrance during the summer. Before entering, walk
around to the east end of the church to appreciate the spectacular flying

which retain some of their 13th-century stained glass — in all their glory.
Of interest to history buffs will be the Cathedral’s Treasury (on the Seine
side of the building), which houses such valuable items as gold and jew-
eled chalices and other items from Notre-Dame’s long history.

this futuristic “guts-on-the-outside” building in the late 1960s as part of a
redevelopment plan for the neighborhood, and since its opening in 1966,
the Centre National d’Art et de Culture Georges Pompidou has been a sur-
prisingly popular attraction — so popular that the wear and tear of about
160 million visitors caused the building to begin crumbling and it closed
for a three-year renovation in 1997. It is a wonderfully spacious haven in
which to view, touch, or listen to modern art and artists. The newer of
Paris’s two modern art museums, the Centre Georges Pompidou includes
two floors of work from the Musée National d’Art Moderne, France’s
national collection of modern art. The Centre Pompidou also houses a
cinema, a huge public library, spaces for modern dance and music, tem-
porary exhibits that often include video and computer works, and nearly
150 drawings, paintings, and other works by Romanian sculptor Constantin
Brancusi in the Brancusi Atelier, a small building near the Pompidou’s
entrance. Plan on spending at least two hours to do the works and a half-
hour buying souvenirs here.
Sadly, taking a free escalator ride to the top for the breathtaking panoramic
view of Paris is no more; you must purchase admission to the museum.
However, if all you’re interested in is the view, consider stopping at the
Pompidou’s ultrahip top-floor restaurant Georges. For the same price as an
adult’s full-package admission to the museum (10/$16), you can relax
with a glass of wine and enjoy the 360-degree view from indoors.
As a bonus, visit the nearby Igor Stravinsky fountain (informally la
Fontaine des automats), which is free. Its animated sculptures by Jean
Tinguely and Niki de Saint Phalle include red lips spitting water, a multi-
colored treble clef symbol, a mermaid squirting water from strategic body
parts, and a twirling grinning skull, all representations of Stravinsky’s com-
positions.

Champs-Elysées
Champs-Elysées (8e)
This is the avenue where the military march on Bastille Day, where
cinephiles line up for French and American movies playing in the many
theaters, where tourists wander the broad sidewalks and browse some of
Chapter 11: Discovering Paris’s Best Attractions 189

the same stores that can be found back home, where the Tour de France
crowns the winner. But this isn’t just a boulevard; if you were in Paris when
the French won the World and Euro Cup soccer championships (1998 and
2000, respectively), you understand what the Champs-Elysées means to
the French. They come here to celebrate victory and freedom. When close
to a million singing, flag-waving Parisians spilled into the avenue, it was
said that the country hadn’t experienced such group euphoria since the
days following the Liberation of Paris by the Allies in 1944. The scene on
France’s most famous street is liveliest at night, with people lining up for
the numerous cinemas (see English-language films here by looking for v.o.
for version originale on schedules and movie posters) and floodlights illu-
minating the Arc de Triomphe and place de la Concorde. Restaurants con-
sist mainly of standard chain cafes (Chez Clément, Hippo) and American-
style fast-food (McDonald’s, Planet Hollywood), although good restaurants
abound on the streets surrounding the avenue (see Chapter 10). You can
shop at reasonably priced stores, such as Zara, get good deals on T-shirts
at Petit Bateau, pick up what all of Europe is listening to at Fnac or Virgin,
search for chic souvenirs at Le Drugstore, wander the very luxe (Louis
Vuitton, whose flagship “cultural space” and store opened in 2006), and
pass chain stores that you’d see in any American mall (the Disney Store,
Quiksilver). Some of the stores are open on Sunday. Allow an hour to walk
from top to bottom, longer if you want to shop, eat, or dawdle.

Eiffel Tower (La Tour Eiffel)
Eiffel Tower/Les Invalides (7e)
Paris’s most famous symbol weighs 7,000 tons, soars 317m (1,056 ft.), is
held together with 2.5 million rivets and was due for destruction 20 years
after the World’s Fair of 1889 for which it was built. (Its usefulness as a
communications tower saved it.) Praised by some and criticized by others,
the tower created as much controversy in its time as did I.M. Pei’s pyramid
at the Louvre 100 years later. Upon completion, the Eiffel Tower was the
tallest human-built structure in the world. People have climbed it, bungee-
jumped from it, and cycled down the tower’s steps. Since 2003, 20,000
lights sparkle for ten minutes an hour each evening until 2 a.m. in summer
and 1 a.m. in winter. Parisians often comment that the final lighting hour
is the best one, because the yellow ambient lighting on the tower’s struc-
ture is turned off, and only the sparkling white lights can be seen.
But what you really want to know are the practicalities: Do I have to climb
stairs? Do elevators go to the top? Are there bathrooms? Do they have snacks?
Can I ascend in a wheelchair? The answers: The Tower has three levels that
are accessible by elevator. No elevator goes directly from ground level to
the top; you must change elevators at the second level. Although you can
take stairs from the ground to the first and second levels, you can’t take
stairs from the second level to the top. Most likely you’ll wait for elevators
on the first and second levels in specially roped-off lines. In high season,
the wait sometimes is as long an hour for each line. Restrooms are located
Part IV: Exploring Paris 
190

on each level, and snack bars and souvenir stands are on the first and
second levels. The tower is wheelchair accessible to the second level but
not to the top.
Some advice: Six million people visit the Eiffel Tower each year. To avoid
loonnnggg lines, go early in the morning or in the off season and take the
stairs to Level 2 to avoid waiting in line for the elevators there (you can only
get to the top by elevator, however, and will have to wait in line for it). If this
isn’t possible, allow about three hours for your visit: one hour to line up for
tickets and another two to access the elevators on levels one and two.
Food is available at the Altitude 95 restaurant on the first floor, which is
simply gorgeous, but overpriced for the quality of its meals. A first-floor
snack bar and second-floor cafeteria are open, but again, they’re not the
best values (you’ll pay about 7.50/$12 for a slice of pizza or a sandwich
and a drink). The best food at the Eiffel Tower is also its most expensive,
without a doubt: The Michelin-starred Jules Verne, one of Paris’s most cel-
ebrated restaurants, is on the Eiffel Tower’s second level. (One of the pluses
of dining here is that you get your own private elevator to the restaurant.)
If you have the patience to wait until sunset, the Eiffel Tower at night is
recommended! Its lights frame the lacy steelwork beneath you in a way
that daylight doesn’t, and the Seine reflects it all.

Hôtel des Invalides (Napoléon’s Tomb)
Eiffel Tower/Les Invalides (7e)
Louis XIV, who liked war and waged many, built Invalides, one of Europe’s
architectural masterpieces, as a hospital and home for all veteran officers
and soldiers “whether maimed or old or frail.” It still has offices for depart-
ments of the French armed forces, and part of it is still a hospital. The best
way to get the sense of the awe that the Hôtel des Invalides inspires is to
walk to it by crossing the Alexander III bridge. The dome of the Église du
Dôme (gilded with 12 kilograms of real gold), is one of the high points of
classical art, with a skylight rising 107m (351 ft.) from the ground. Sixteen
green copper cannons point outward in a powerful display.
Enemy flags captured during the military campaigns of the 19th and 20th
centuries hang from the rafters in two impressive rows at the Église de 
St-Louis, known as the Church of the Soldiers, but most visitors come 
to see the Tomb of Napoléon where the emperor is buried in six coffins,
one inside the other, under the great dome. The first coffin is iron, the
second mahogany, the third and fourth lead, the fifth ebony, and the out-
ermost oak. The emperor’s remains were transferred here 20 years after
his death in 1820 on the island of St. Helena, where he was exiled follow-
ing his defeat at Waterloo. Buried along with Napoléon in smaller tombs
Chapter 11: Discovering Paris’s Best Attractions 191

are the emperor’s two brothers, his son Napoléon II of France, Claude
Rouget de Lisle (author of La Marseillaise, the French national anthem),
and Henri de la Tour d’Auvergne, Viscount de Turenne — one of France’s
greatest military leaders. Napoléon was so respected that even the 1793
extremist revolutionaries, who scattered the remains of the other
deceased French leaders interred at St. Denis, preserved his bones until
their final resting place in les Invalides. A must-see is the Musée de
l’Armée, one of the world’s greatest military museums; admission is
included when you buy your ticket for Napoléon’s tomb. It features thou-
sands of weapons from prehistory to World War II including spearheads,
arrowheads, maces, cannons, and guns in addition to battle flags, booty,
suits of armor, and uniforms from around the world. The Charles de Gaulle
wing tells the story of World War II on video touch screens, a decoding
machine, and other artifacts. Admission here allows access to Napoléon’s
Tomb, the Musée de l’Armée, a scale models museum, and the Order of
the Liberation museum. Set aside two hours for a complete visit or a half-
hour to see only the tomb.

Jardin des Tuileries
Louvre (1er)
Come for a stroll here either before or after visiting the Louvre. Once a fash-
ionable carriageway, today the Tuileries is Paris’s most visited park and a
great place to rest your feet and catch some rays on conveniently placed
wrought-iron chairs surrounding the garden’s fountains. In keeping with the
French style of parks, trees are planted according to an orderly design and
the sandy paths are arrow straight. Spread out across 25 hectares (63
acres), the gardens were originally laid out in the 1560s for Queen Mother
Catherine de Medici in front of the Tuileries Palace, which was burned
down during the 1871 Paris Commune. The Orangerie (which has finally
reopened! — see later in this chapter) and the Jeu de Paume are at the
garden’s western edge, and to the east you’ll find 40 beautiful Maillol
bronzes scattered among the trees, as well as four sculptures by Rodin, and
works by Jean Dubuffet, Alberto Giacometti, David Smith, Max Ernst, Henry
Moore, and Henri Laurens. You can sit down for a light snack at one of the
outdoor cafes. During the summer, a carnival features an enormous Ferris
wheel (with great views of the city), a log flume, fun house, arcade-style
games, snacks, and machine-made soft ice cream (but I find the best ice
cream in the Tuileries is the homemade ice cream sold from a stand right
beyond the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel at the entrance to the Tuileries).

Jardin du Palais-Royal
Louvre (1er)
In past centuries, gamblers and those seeking more lascivious pleasures
flocked to this garden where Cardinal Richelieu ordered the Royal Palace
built in 1630 as his personal residence, complete with grounds landscaped
by the royal gardener. Today the palace is no longer open to the public,
but its statue-filled gardens, including Daniel Buren’s wonderful prison-
striped columns of staggered heights built in 1986 (which make for a great
photo op), remain one of the most restful places in the city. The square is
also ringed by restaurants, art galleries, and specialty boutiques, and it’s
home to the Comédie-Française.

Jardin et Palais du Luxembourg
St-Germain-des-Prés (6e)
No matter which entrance you walk through, you will fall in love with this
beloved park not far from the Sorbonne and just south of the Latin Quarter.
It’s the 6e arrondissement’s Jardin du Luxembourg, one of Paris’s most
beloved parks. Children love it for its playground, pony rides, puppet thea-
ter, and the Fontaine de Médicis (the central Médici Fountain) where they
can sail toy boats and watch the ducks. Besides pools, fountains, and stat-
ues of queens and poets, there are tennis and boules courts (boule means
ball; in this game, players compete to see who can roll their small steel
ball closest to a larger steel ball that lies farther down the court). In recent
years, art has been exhibited on the wrought-iron fence at the garden’s
northwestern entrance near boulevard St-Michel and rue de Médicis.
The park was commissioned by King Henri IV’s queen, Marie de Medici, who
also had the Palais du Luxembourg built at the northern edge of the park.
The Palais resembles the Palazzo Pitti in Florence, where Marie spent her

Keeping an eye on your wallet 
while eyeing the goods
You won’t be able to avoid pesky (and illegal) vendors trying to cajole you into buying
everything from Eiffel Tower key chains to postcards to mechanical butterflies; they
constantly approach tourists standing in line for Eiffel Tower admission tickets. Be
attentive — some of these vendors work in tandem with pickpockets who will rip you
off while you’re busy looking at the displays. As for the quality of the merchandise —
it’s pretty bad. Buy your souvenirs from shops and licensed vendors. (See Chapter 4
for advice on what to do if you get pickpocketed.)

childhood and for which she was homesick. When the queen was banished
in 1630, the palace was abandoned until the Revolution in 1789, when it was
used as a prison. Now the seat of the French Senate, it is not open to the
public.
Orchards in the park’s southwest corner contain 360 varieties of apples,
270 kinds of pears, and various grapevines. Members of the French Senate
get to eat the fruit, but leftovers go to a soup kitchen. Walk north and you
come across a bevy of beehives behind a low fence. A beekeeping course
is taught here on weekends. See whether you can find the Statue of Liberty
tucked away nearby.

Montmartre
On the Right Bank
This neighborhood/village is for anyone who admires the work of Toulouse-
Lautrec, is interested in one of Picasso’s earliest studios, or loved the films
Le Destin Fabuleux d’Amélie Poulain or Moulin Rouge. You can get to
Montmartre by taking the métro to the Anvers or Abbesses stop, the
entrance of which is graced by a fabulous Art Nouveau métro sign. You can
either walk to the top of the butte (hill) or take the funiculaire (outdoor small
railway) up. (To take the funiculaire, walk from the Anvers Métro station the
short distance from rue Steinkerque and turn left onto rue Tardieu, where,
for a métro ticket, the funiculaire whisks you from the base of the
Montmartre butte to the road right beneath Sacré-Coeur.) After visiting
Sacré-Coeur and the touristy but fun place du Tertre, a square with 
overpriced restaurants and artists clamoring to sketch your portrait,
wander down the hill where you eventually stumble across Paris from
another era — surprisingly unspoiled lanes, quiet squares, ivy-clad shut-
tered houses with gardens, and even Paris’s only vineyard. Altogether, it cre-
ates a sense of the rustic village it once was. (Note: See Chapter 13 for a
detailed walking itinerary through Montmartre.)
Musée d’Orsay
Eiffel Tower/Les Invalides (7e)
This stone and iron former train station is one of the world’s greatest muse-
ums of 19th century art, with an unsurpassed collection of Impressionist
masterpieces. Opened in 1900 by the Campagnie des Chemins de Fer
d’Orléans, it was virtually abandoned 39 years later. (You can see its sorry
state in Orson Welles’s film The Trial.) In 1979, it was classified as a histor-
ical monument to prevent its demolition and its transformation into a
museum began in 1983. Paris’s collections of 19th-century art, which had
been scattered among many museums, now had a single home, and the
Musée d’Orsay opened to the public in 1986.

Paris’s top attraction: 
The Seine river cruise
Is there anything more romantic than slipping down the current of one of the world’s
great rivers past famous cathedrals, museums, palaces — and the prison where Marie
Antoinette spent her last days? Well, perhaps killing the canned PA sightseeing com-
mentary and getting rid of all the other camera-clicking tourists would help the roman-
tic mood, but if it’s mood you’re after you can always take a more refined, though wildly
expensive, dinner cruise.
Three companies offer similar tours in the same price range with recorded commen-
taries. Perhaps the most well known are the Bateaux-Mouches that sail from the Right
Bank and have huge floodlit boats. Bateaux-Parisiens sail from the Left Bank, while
Vedettes Pont Neuf sail from the Ile de la Cité. Vedettes boats are smaller, more inti-
mate, and not all of them are covered.

est: the Eiffel Tower, the Musée d’Orsay, St-Germain-des-Prés, Notre-Dame, the
Jardin des Plantes, Hôtel de Ville, Louvre, and the Champs-Elysées. A day ticket costs
12 ($19) per adult or 6 ($9.60) for children under 16; Batobus runs every 25 to 30
minutes mid-March to May and from September through the beginning of November
from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. and until 9:30 p.m. June through August. From November through
January 8 and from February 3 through mid-March, Batobus runs every half-hour from
10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.

There are three floors of exhibits. On the ground floor are Ingres’s La
Source, Millet’s L’Angelus, the Barbizon school, Manet’s Olympia, and other
works of early Impressionism. Impressionism continues on the top level,
with Renoir’s Le Moulin de la Galette, Manet’s Déjeuner sur l’Herbe, Degas’s
Racing at Longchamps, Monet’s cathedrals, van Gogh’s Self-Portrait, and
Whistler’s Portrait of the Artist’s Mother. Works by Gauguin and the Pont-
Aven school, Toulouse-Lautrec, Pissarro, Cézanne, and Seurat also are
exhibited. Symbolism, naturalism, and Art Nouveau are represented on the
middle level; the international Art Nouveau exhibit is worth a look for its
wonderful furniture and objets d’art as well as Koloman Moser’s Paradise,
a beautiful design for stained glass. Give yourself three hours, including a
lunch break in the museum’s gorgeous, turn-of-the-20th-century Musée
d’Orsay restaurant on the middle level. For less expensive and quicker
light bites, the Café des Hauteurs is on the fifth floor (it has a great view
of the Seine through its clock window) and a snack bar is on the mezza-
nine. In 2008, admission to both the Musée d’Orsay and the Musée Rodin

Musée du Louvre
Louvre (1er)
The three steps to an enjoyable Louvre experience are to:
1. Buy your tickets in advance. Visitors from the United States and
Canada can purchase tickets online from www.ticketweb.com
(don’t be put off by the Paris, CA location denoted on the website;
this is the Louvre in Paris France) and have them delivered to their
homes before departure. Visitors from other countries can use
www.fnac.com or www.ticketnet.com. If you are already in France
upon reading this, some métro stations have tickets for sale at the
window or you can buy tickets from the distributors on the second
floor of the Carrousel du Louvre. Take the escalator near the Nature
et Découverte store to the second floor; distributors are on the left.
2. Grab a free map of the Louvre at the Information Desk under the
Pyramid or get a free guide. The Louvre bookstore in the Carrousel
du Louvre sells many comprehensive guides and maps in English;
you can also grab brochures for “Visitors in a Hurry,” or a guide-
book, The Louvre, First Visit.
3. Take a guided tour. You can try a 90-minute tour by a museum
guide (% 01-40-20-52-63) that covers the most popular works and
gives you a quick orientation to the museum’s layout. Times and
prices vary; generally, a tour of the most celebrated works is about

8 for adults and 5 for students under 26 years of age ($13 and
$8, respectively). If you prefer to set your own pace, an audio tour
(6/$9.60) can be rented at the entrance to any of the wings.
I.M. Pei’s glass pyramid is the main entrance to the museum; pregnant
women, visitors with children in strollers, and those with disabilities have
priority. Avoid this entrance and its long lines by using the 99 rue de
Rivoli/Carrousel du Louvre entrance, or take the stairs at the Porte des
Lions near the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel (the arch resembling a

smaller Arc de Triomphe). Those who already have tickets or have the
Carte Musées et Monuments can use the special entrance to the Louvre at
the passage Richelieu between rue de Rivoli and the courtyard.
Tickets are valid all day so you can enter and exit the museum as many
times as you prefer. Admission is reduced after 6 p.m. on Wednesday and
Friday, and free the first Sunday of each month.
The Louvre palace (see “The Louvre” map nearby) evolved during several
centuries, first built as the Château du Louvre in 1190 by Philip Augustus.
It first opened as a museum in 1793, and it would take you a month of 
visits to see the more than 30,000 treasures it now houses. But a visit to 
the Louvre doesn’t have to be overwhelming. The Louvre is organized in
three wings — Sully, Denon, and Richelieu — over four floors exhibiting art
and antiquities from Oriental, Islamic, Egyptian, Greek, Etruscan, Roman, 
Oceanic, European, and North and South American civilizations, and sculp-
ture, objets d’art, paintings, prints, drawings, and the moats and dungeon
of the medieval Louvre fortress.
When you’re in a hurry, but want to do the Louvre on your own, do a quick,
“best of the Louvre” tour on either Wednesday or Friday when the museum
is open until 9:45 p.m. Start with Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa (Denon
wing, first floor); on the same floor nearby are two of the Louvre’s most
famous French paintings, Géricault’s The Raft of Medusa and Delacroix’s
Liberty Guiding the People. Next, visit the Winged Victory and Michelangelo’s
Slaves (both Denon wing, ground floor) before seeing the Venus de Milo
(Sully wing, ground floor). After that, let your own interests guide you.
Consider that only Florence’s Uffizi Gallery rivals the Denon wing for 
its Italian Renaissance collection, which includes Raphael’s Portrait of
Balthazar Castiglione and Titian’s Man with a Glove. And the revamped
Egyptian antiquities department is the largest exhibition of Egyptian antiq-
uities outside Cairo.

Musée Jacquemart André
Champs-Elysées (8e)
This kid-friendly museum is very much worth a visit, not only for the
Italian and Flemish masterpieces by Bellini, Botticelli, Carpaccio, Uccello,
Rubens, Rembrandt, and van Eyck, but to see how very rich Parisians lived
in the 19th century. Edouard André, the heir of a prominent banking family,

and his wife, Nélie Jacquemart, a well-known portraitist, commissioned
architect Henri Parent to build their “house,” then traveled the world to
find French, Flemish, and Italian paintings, furniture, and tapestries to fill
it. They had no children, so Nélie willed the house and its treasures to the
French government, giving the city of Paris one of its best museums.
Highlights of the collection include Rembrandt’s Docteur Tholinx, Van
Dyck’s Time Cutting the Wings of Love, a fresco by Jean Baptiste Tiepolo,
Domenico Ghirlandaio’s naturalistic Portrait d’un Vieillard, and a portrait
of Catherine Skavronskaia by Elisabeth Vigée-Lebrun, one of Marie
Antoinette’s favorite artists, and a fascinating person in her own right. As
you wander the ornate gilt-ridden rooms, pause in the “winter garden,” a
tour de force of marble and mirrors flanking an unusual double staircase.
For kids, the museum has organized a special activity: At the beginning of
the visit kids receive a free booklet with word mysteries. The kids use the
contents of the museum to solve the puzzles, aided by clues spread
throughout the museum, and find out the “secret letters.” It is all worth-
while, especially for the surprise! Take advantage of the free interactive
audio that guides you through the mansion with fascinating narrative. Visit
at 11 a.m., allow at least an hour, then take a break in what was Madame
Jacquemart’s lofty-ceilinged dining room, now a pretty tearoom serving
light lunches (the salads are all named for artists) and snacks.

Musée Nationale d’Auguste Rodin
Eiffel Tower/Les Invalides (7e)
This may just be the “perfect” museum. It’s a large house with just 16 rooms
surrounded by bucolic gardens. Auguste Rodin, often regarded as the great-
est sculptor of all time, lived and worked here from 1908 until his death in
1917, an era when his legendary sculptures were labeled obscene. This col-
lection includes all of his greatest works. In the courtyard, Burghers of Calais
is a harrowing commemoration of the siege of Calais in 1347, after which the
triumphant Edward III of England kept the town’s six richest burghers as ser-
vants. Also in the courtyard is The Thinker. The Gates of Hell is a portrayal
of Dante’s Inferno. Intended for the Musée des Arts Decoratifs, the massive
bronze doors were not completed until seven years after Rodin’s death.
Inside the most popular attraction is Le Baiser (The Kiss), which immortal-
izes in white marble the passion of doomed 13th-century lovers Paolo
Malatesta and Francesca da Rimini. Studies done by Rodin before he exe-
cuted his sculptures take up some of the 16 rooms. Particularly interesting
is the evolution of his controversial nude of Balzac rising from a tree trunk.
Don’t miss the works of Camille Claudel, a top-rated artist and Rodin’s stu-
dent and lover for many years. The museum is in the 18th-century Hôtel
Biron, which was a convent before it became a residence for such writers
and artists as Matisse, Isadora Duncan, Jean Cocteau, and the poet, Rainer
Maria Rilke. Count on spending at least an hour and a half here.

If you don’t have much time or money, pay the 1 ($1.60) admission to
visit just the gardens, where Rodin’s works stand among 2,000 rosebushes,
bubbling springs, and other plants. A playground is also hidden within the
grounds. Allow at least an hour to visit the garden, longer if you want to
break for coffee in the garden cafe.

trip to Paris and see something different each time because the works are
constantly rotated. Located in the renovated Hôtel Salé, which was built in
the mid–17th century for a salt tax collector (hence the name which trans-
lates as the salted mansion). The museum was created in 1973 by Picasso’s
heirs, who donated his personal art collection to the state in lieu of paying
outrageous inheritance taxes after his death. The spectacular collection
includes more than 200 paintings, nearly 160 sculptures, 88 ceramics, and
more than 3,000 prints and drawings. Every phase of Picasso’s prolific 75-
year career is represented. Works can be viewed chronologically; particu-
larly interesting is seeing how his paintings were influenced by the women
he loved at the time: his first wife, Olga; Marie-Thérèse Walter, mother of
his daughter, Maya; Françoise Gilot, mother of Paloma and Paul; and Dora
Maar, among others. Budget at least two hours here, if not more. It is best
to go early in the morning, as the narrow corridors in parts of the museum
get particularly crowded during the afternoon (they need the wall space
to exhibit this enormous collection). The museum also displays works by
other artists collected by Picasso, including Corot, Cézanne, Braque,
Rousseau, Matisse, and Renoir. A visit here is well worth the trip; make
sure to walk around the neighborhood afterward to shop the trendy bou-
tiques and fill up on falafel from one of the numerous stands on and around
rue des Rosiers.

Panthéon
Latin Quarter (5e)
Is it a church? Is it a museum? Is it a tomb? Perhaps the best descrip-
tion would be: The Panthéon is to France what Westminster Abbey is to
England — a final resting place for many of the nation’s greatest men and
one woman, Marie Curie. Few other monuments in Paris have had as ver-
satile a career as the neoclassical Panthéon, whose huge dome is one of the
landmarks of the Left Bank. Inside the domed church’s barrel-vaulted crypt
are the tombs of Voltaire, Rousseau, Hugo, Braille, and Zola. French writer,
politician, and adventurer André Malraux was the last to be entombed here
in 1996. Louis XV originally built the Panthéon as a church in thanksgiving
to St-Geneviève after his recovery from gout. Construction started in 1755,
but after the French Revolution, the church was renamed the Panthéon, in
remembrance of ancient Rome’s Pantheon, and rededicated as a burying
ground for France’s heroes. All Christian elements were removed and win-
dows were blocked. From 1806 to 1884, officials turned the Panthéon back
into a church two more times before finally declaring it what it is today.
Along with historical information of the great figures buried here, a small
wing is devoted to explanation of the scientific theories and experiments
discovered by Pierre and Marie Curie. A pendulum suspended from the cen-
tral dome re-creates Jean-Bernard Foucault’s 1851 demonstration proving
the rotation of the earth. A plaque here is dedicated to 2,600 “righteous”

Père-Lachaise Cemetery
Montmartre and beyond (20e)
On a high hill overlooking Paris, this “city” is the final resting ground for
some of the world’s most illustrious composers, artists, writers, poets,
singers, and philosophers. Chopin, Bizet, Proust, Balzac, Corot, Delacroix,
Pissarro, Modigliani, Molière, Oscar Wilde, Isadora Duncan, Simone
Signoret, Yves Montand, and of course, Jim Morrison (framed pictures of
him grace the walls of neighboring brasseries, but his bust has been
removed due to vandalism) have been laid to rest in this, the world’s most
visited cemetery. No wonder Parisians have always come here to stroll and
reflect; with its winding, cobbled streets, park benches, and street signs,
the 44-hectare (110-acre) Père-Lachaise is a minicity unto itself. Many vis-
itors leave flowers or notes scrawled on métro tickets for their favorite
celebrity residents. The tombs are artistic works, decorated with exqui-
site marble and stone statuettes or chiseled around diminutive stained-
glass windows.
Legends abound. The 18th-century bronze tomb of murdered journalist
Victor Noir is reputed to make women fertile when rubbed (the polished
sheen of certain parts of his statue is testament to its lore!). Oscar Wilde’s
impressive tomb here, carved by Sir Jacob Epstein, is covered with lipstick-
spots from the kisses of his admirers. The tragic love story of Abélard and
Héloïse (she was his student and her uncle castrated him when he found
out about their affair) has faded, but in the 19th century, their tombs were
magnets for disappointed lovers. You can obtain a free map from the gate-
keeper at the main entrance, but the better map is one sold outside the
entrance for 3 ($4.80). Or you can just use the “Père-Lachaise Cemetery”
map provided in this chapter. Allow at the very least two hours to visit.

Place des Vosges
Le Marais (3e)
The place des Vosges sits right in the middle of the Marais — a symmetri-
cal block of 36 rose-colored town houses, nine on each side, with hand-
some slate roofs and dormer windows. At ground level is a lovely arcaded
walkway that’s now home to galleries, cafes, antiques dealers, and smart

boutiques. In the early 17th century, Henri IV transformed this area into
the most prestigious neighborhood in France, putting his royal palace
here, and the square quickly became the center of courtly parades and fes-
tivities. After the Revolution, it became place de l’Indivisibilité. Victor Hugo
lived at No. 6 for 16 years (see “More Fun Things to See and Do,” later in
this chapter). This is one of the places in Paris where you can enjoy a sand-
wich in front of the fountain, and catch some rays alongside local students
and older residents. Allow 30 minutes to walk all the way around the
square under the arcades and a brief stroll in the park.
See map p. 184. Métro: St-Paul. Bus: 20, 29, 69, 76, 96.
Sacré-Coeur
Montmartre (18e)
The white Byzantine-Romanesque basilica dominating Paris’s highest hill —
the one that you can see from all around the city — is Basilique du Sacré-
Coeur. Built from 1876 (after France’s defeat in the Franco-Prussian War) to
1919, the church’s interior is not as striking as its exterior and is, in fact,
vaguely depressing. The best reason to come here is for the city-spanning
views from its Dome — visibility is 48km (30 miles) across the rooftops of
Paris on a clear day. Conserve your pre-Dome climbing energy by using the
funiculaire to take you to Sacré-Coeur. Simply take the métro to the Anvers
station, and then ride the elevator to exit the station. Walk the short dis-
tance from rue Steinkerque and turn left onto rue Tardieu, where, for the
price of a métro ticket, the funiculaire whisks you from the base of the
Montmartre butte to an area right below the church.
To reach the dome and crypt, face the church and walk around to its left
side, following signs for the Dome and Crypte. You walk down a set of
stairs and follow a walkway about 15m (50 ft.) to an iron gate. The entrance
and ticket machine are on your right.
The climb from church floor to dome is up a flight of nail-bitingly steep
corkscrew steps.
On the other side of Sacré-Coeur is the place du Tertre, where Vincent van
Gogh once lived; he used it as a scene for one of his paintings. The place is
usually swamped by tourists and quick-sketch artists in the spring and
summer. Don’t let the artists push you around too much: Their sketched
likenesses of you or your companions may leave something to be desired,
especially at their prices. Following any street downhill from the place du
Tertre leads you to the quiet side of Montmartre. The steps in front of the
church come alive around dusk, when street musicians entertain the crowd
that gathers to watch the city’s lights come on. Be alert: Pickpockets love
Montmartre. Young men often hang around Sacré-Coeur and try to sell
made-on-the-spot bracelets to tourists, tied directly on to your wrist — this
is a classic way of partially incapacitating you while they rifle through the
pockets of you or your fellow travelers. Don’t stop for them; just give them
a polite “non merci.”

Sainte-Chapelle
Ile de la Cité (4e)
There are two ways to appreciate Sainte-Chappelle. Save it for the early
afternoon on a sunny day, because the effect of its 15 perfect stained-glass
windows soaring 15m (50 ft.) high to a star-studded vaulted ceiling is
purely kaleidoscopic. Or, if you have the time, catch a classical music 
concert here, when light from the chandeliers dancing off the windows is
magical.
Built between 1246 and 1248 by Louis IX, the only French king to become
a saint, Sainte-Chapelle, the “Holy Chapel,” was a shrine to house relics of
the crucifixion, including the Crown of Thorns that Louis bought from the
Emperor of Constantinople. Building Sainte-Chapelle certainly cost less
than the outrageously expensive Crown of Thorns, which was said to have
been acquired at the crucifixion. (Louis purchased the Crown from his
cousin, Emperor Baldwin II of Constantinople, at a sum of 135,000 livres
tournois — meanwhile Sainte-Chapelle cost only 40,000 to construct.) The
Crown now resides in the vault at Notre-Dame.
Sainte-Chapelle actually consists of two chapels, one on top of the other.
Palace servants used the chapelle basse (“lower chapel”), ornamented with
fleur-de-lis designs. The chapelle haute (“upper chapel,” accessed by 30
winding steps) is one of the highest achievements of Gothic art. If you
spend the time (which can take hours or even a day!), you can see that the
1,134 scenes in the stained-glass windows trace the Biblical story from the
Garden of Eden to the Apocalypse. St. Louis is shown several times.

“More Fun Things to Do in Paris” map can help you locate the fun zones.
Part IV: Exploring Paris 
206

Especially for kids
If you’re a kid visiting Paris, there are so many things to do and see, from
zoos and boat rides to a city of science and magic museums! There’s the
fun Parisian tradition of les guignols (puppet shows) that, even though
conducted in French, are pretty easy to figure out. You can find the
shows in the Jardin du Luxembourg, the Champ de Mars, and the Jardin
des Tuileries. All Parisian parks, in fact, are wonderful for children, even
without the puppet shows; one of the best is the Bois de Vincennes,
located at the most eastern edge of the city. You can rent a boat for a
leisurely row on the lake, or a bike to ride on the park’s miles of bike
paths, or visit the great zoo with 1,200 animals (sadly, due to renovation
it closed for four years at the end of 2008). Wander the wonderful maze
at the more centrally located Jardin des Enfants des Halles, 105 rue
Rambuteau (% 01-45-08-07-18; access is free, generally open from 
10 a.m.–4 or 6 p.m.; Métro: Châtelet). The French love well-behaved 
children and are happy to welcome them, especially in the following
locations which have been designed with kids in mind.
Aquarium Tropical de la Porte Dorée
It’s a little off the beaten path, but it’s still a fascinating place to visit either
before or after a visit to the nearby parc Zoologique de Paris. Aquatic life
is grouped by theme and by oceanographic region in 80 aquariums. Your
kids will love the circular aquarium where the Nile crocodiles live, and be
excited to view sharks in natural looking environments. On display until
May 2009 is an exhibit devoted to New Caledonia’s coral reef. Allow at least
an hour and a half.

Open: Wed–Mon 9 a.m.–5:15 p.m.
Cité des Sciences et de l’Industrie/Parc de la Villette
This is basically a theme park about science. It’s simply enormous, with
interactive exhibits on everything from outer space to genetically manip-
ulated plants, all in an incredibly cool setting. There’s a planetarium, movie
cinemas, ten themed gardens, and an aquarium, as well as an adventure
playground designed specifically for 3- to 12-year-olds. On the complex’s
east side is Explora, which features exhibits, models, robots, and interac-
tive games, demonstrates scientific techniques, and presents subjects that
include the universe, the earth, the environment, space, computer science,
and health (in one experiment, you can test your sense of smell). The Cité
des Enfants (Children’s City) was just remodeled and expanded and is
divided into exhibits for 2- to 3-year-olds, 3- to 5-year-olds and 6- to 12-year-
olds. Kids will learn how their bodies work in a variety of ways by seeing
themselves from every angle, exploring mazes, discovering the properties

of water through experiments — the list of activities for children is simply
endless here. The gigantic Géode sphere, on the complex’s south side, is
a wonder, with a huge hemispheric IMAX screen on which six or so films
are shown daily. Another theater, the Cinaxe, is a simulator that projects
movies on a screen while accelerating and moving the audience in differ-
ent directions (children younger than three, pregnant women, and those
with disabilities are not allowed). Kids can climb aboard an actual sub-
marine in the l’Argonaute exhibit (on the complex’s south side next to
Géode) and participate in technology demonstrations at the Science
Actualités (Science Today).
After the visit, let your kids run wild in the expansive, green parc de la
Villette, where they can play in one of the ten gardens — especially neat
are the Garden of Childhood Terrors, a blue spruce and silver birch
“forest” where eerie music plays, and the Dragon Garden where kids and
adults can cruise down the tongue of a dragon, an enormous slide. There
are restaurants in the complex and food stands in the park. This could
easily be an all-day visit. The Cité des Sciences et l’Industrie is bordered
by the La Villette canal basin. Directly across is another smaller complex,
the Cité de la Musique, accessible by a bridge. Its exhibits, museums, and
concerts are also worth a stop.

Jardin de l’Acclimatation Bois de Boulogne
This is like an amusement park from another era, small enough to be man-
ageable with such low-tech attractions as a petting zoo and a house of mir-
rors, a big chair swing, and mechanized boats. And after a half-day at this
10-hectare (25-acre) park, your children will sleep well! The park’s layout
is simple: Just follow its circular road in either direction, and it eventually
gets you back to where you started. Attractions also include bumper cars,
an archery range, a miniature golf course, individual mechanical horses
that take “riders” on a little circuit, a farm, a quick little roller coaster, an
American-style bowling alley, a playground, pony rides, and a “City of
Merry-Go-Rounds,” where young “citizens” can drive cars, firetrucks, and
planes, try their hand at carnival games, and ride the carousel. Kids and
their parents can also take in a puppet show. The park has an “enchanted
river,” a lake bordered by a bright blue-topped Korean pavilion, a restau-
rant, and snack and ice cream stands. The most fun way to get here is to
take the Pétit Train from the métro’s Porte Maillot exit (2.70/$4.30 round-
trip). Pay for rides by buying a carnet of 15 tickets for 32 ($51).

Jardin des Plantes/Museums of Natural History
Children have visited this wonderful place for centuries to gape at bugs,
bones, minerals, meteorites, dinosaurs, fossils, and endangered species in
the galleries of the Jardin’s Musée National d’Histoire Naturelle on the site
of the former royal medicine garden. Here, the cavernous Grand Gallery
of Evolution traces life and humankind’s relationship to nature. A giant
squid, Wheke, (19.7 ft. long and donated by the National Institute of Water
& Atmospheric Research Limited), was exhibited here in March 2008. 
The endangered and extinct-species room displays (stuffed versions of)
Gabonese monkeys, Sumatran tigers, lemurs of Madagascar, and a mock-
up of the dodo bird. English explanations of some exhibits are available.
Also part of the natural history museum in separate buildings are the
Mineralogy and Geology Gallery (1,800 minerals, meteorites, and precious
stones), the Entomological Gallery (1,500 insect specimens for bug-loving
kids), and the Paleontology and Anatomy Gallery (the relationship
between humans and animals shown with lots of skeletons). Walk outside
amid 2,000 mountain plants from the Alps and the Himalayas in the Alpine
garden, see the cacti in the Mexican garden, the greenhouse with tropical
plants and rows of trees, beds of herbs and flowers, a 17th-century maze,
and a carousel. Save for last the medium-sized ménagerie (zoo), one of the
oldest in the world (it opened in 1794 with animals from the zoo at
Versailles), containing live bears, buffalo, big cats, apes, antelope, reptiles
(including an alligator found in a room at the Hôtel de Paris), tortoises,
small Przewalski horses (which no longer exist in the wild), and birds.
Don’t overlook the super cool Vivarium — the spiders and insects are
remarkable, especially the bugs that look like living tree branches! — or
the Microzoo, where kids use microscopes to get a look at the life of the
tiniest animals. A small restaurant on the zoo’s premises offers pick-me-
ups for the tired and cranky. Allow at least two hours.

La Grande Arche de la Défense
The Grand Arche de la Défense is the centerpiece of a very futuristic Paris
suburb rife with glass and chrome skyscrapers lending their height to sur-
real sculptures. Built in 1989 to commemorate France’s bicentennial, the
arch completes a continuous line of perspective running from the Arc de
Triomphe du Carrousel in the courtyard of the Louvre, down the Champs-
Elysées, and through the Arc de Triomphe to the suburb of La Défense. As
well, there’s a full overview of the Bois de Bologne. The netting you see
here is for catching any pieces of the facade that may fall down — several
chunks have already. This is a popular destination with about 500,000 vis-
itors a year, and kids will love the cool outdoor elevator to the top. There
is a restaurant on the premises, but I suggest bringing snacks to stave off
any hunger pangs and enjoying a better meal back in Paris. Allow about
two hours for the round-trip journey from central Paris, including the
climb to the top.
See map p. 208. 1 parvis de la Défense, 92040 Paris-La Défense. % 01-49-07-27-27.
Métro and RER: Grande Arche de la Défense. Admission: 9 ($12) adults, 7.50 ($12)
students and seniors, free for children younger than 6. Open: Daily Apr–Sept 10

Musée de la Curiosité et de la Magie
It’s a bit dusty at this easy-to-miss museum in an old building next to the
Village St-Paul, but kids won’t care. Bona fide magicians escort you through
vaulted rooms containing a collection of trick mirrors, animated paintings,
talking genies, and the history of illusion in general. Who amongst you is
brave enough to risk sticking a hand in the mouth of a lion to see if it’s really
an illusion? While they won’t disclose any secrets, you and your kids will
have your senses tickled through many interactive displays. Live magic
shows performed throughout the afternoon are also highly entertaining.
The museum shop sells all the tools your kids need to cast (benevolent)
spells back home.
11 rue St-Paul, 4e. % 01-42-72-13-26. Métro: St-Paul. Admission: 9 ($12) adults, 7
($11) children younger than 13. Open: Wed and Sat–Sun 2–7 p.m. and daily during
national school breaks in winter, over Easter, Christmas, and Toussaint/All Saints Day
(Nov).
Palais de la Découverte
This museum is a full funhouse of science brought to life for kids. Here,
you can explore a planetarium, a room devoted to the earth’s geology from
its beginnings to the future, a mathematics atelier that promises a fun
experience, and lots of live experiments on weekends. Your hair will stand
on end in the electrostatics room; kids can light up displays, test their
muscle reactions on special machines, see experiments about electro-
magnetism in an annex off the Electricity Room, and learn about DNA in
the Life Sciences wing. A very popular exposition in 2008 simulated vol-
canoes, earthquakes, and tsunamis. Count on spending at least two hours
here.

Especially for teens
The kid-friendly sights in the previous section are appropriate for
teenagers, as well. But here are a few more suggestions for kids who are
a bit older.
Aquaboulevard
If your teens are bored in Paris (and you’re not visiting during July and Aug
when the banks of the Seine become a beach) go to Aquaboulevard, which
claims to be the biggest water park in Europe. Its seven water slides, wave
pool, against-the-current river, indoor and outdoor pools, spas and Jacuzzis,
whirlpool, geysers, water cannons, walls of water, waterbed with bubbles,
and waterfall make it a fun substitute, and it’s safer than swimming in the
Seine. A McDonald’s, an Oh! Poivrier!, a pizza place, a Hippopotamus, and a
first-run movie theater are located on the premises as well.
See map p. 208. 4 rue Louis-Armand, 15e. % 01-40-60-10-00. Métro: Balard (head
down av. de la Porte de Sèvres; just after you walk under the overpass, you will see
Aquaboulevard straight ahead). Admission: 25 ($40) ages 12 and older, 10 ($16)
children 3–11, who must be accompanied by an adult. Open year -round: Mon–Thurs
9 a.m.–11 p.m., Fri 8 a.m.–midnight, Sat 9 a.m.–midnight, Sun 8 a.m.–11 p.m. Children
under 3 are not admitted.
Champs-Elysées
Teens can shop to their hearts’ content on Paris’s most famous street in
such clothing stores as O’Neill, Quiksilver, Zara, Naf Naf, and Kookaï, and
music stores Virgin and Fnac. They can catch movies in French or English
(look for “v.o.,” for version originale, on the marquee or in newspaper list-
ings for U.S. releases that aren’t dubbed into French) in one of the many
movie theaters and eat familiar fast food at McDonald’s or KFC. Many of
the stores on this street are open Sunday, and plenty of teens — both res-
idents and tourists — hang out here.
See map p. 208. Métro: Concorde, Champs-Elysées, Clémenceau, Franklin-D-
Roosevelt, George V, Charles-de-Gaulle-Étoile. Many bus lines cross the Champs,
but only the 73 travels its entire length.
Les Catacombes (The Catacombs)
This is the coolest, creepiest, most macabre attraction in Paris. “Arrête,
c’est ici l’Empire de la Mort” (“Stop, here is the Empire of Death”) reads the
inscription over the door of the Catacombs, and if they’re open when you
Chapter 11: Discovering Paris’s Best Attractions 213

visit (Les Catacombes seem to undergo repairs at the most inopportune
times), you are in for a spooky visit like no other. This attraction is truly
not for the faint-hearted, and thus perfect for hardy kids older than ten,
because the tunnels are dark, damp, and frankly, a bit scary. A former
quarry, Les Catacombes began housing bones in 1785 from the Cimetière
des Innocents and an assortment of other overstocked Parisian cemeter-
ies. Now Les Catacombes are the final resting place for about six million
skulls and skeletons stacked in thousands of yards of tunnels.
You will need a flashlight (lampe de poche, lahmp duh puhsh) to navigate
the tunnels. Your best bet is to bring one from home, but if you haven’t,
you can buy one in one of the stores on boulevard Raspail or the pedes-
trian rue Daguerre off avenue Général LeClerc. Before you buy, however,
first check to see if the Catacombs are closed for repairs.
Those prone to claustrophobia should think twice about entering. The
deep, dark tunnels close in rapidly and tightly. A flashlight will help navi-
gate the poorly lit corridors and allow you to see the inscriptions. Wear
non-slip shoes (such as hiking boots) to avoid a misstep on the rocky,
often damp passageways and a hood to protect yourself from the water
dripping overhead. Les Catacombes earned the nickname place d’Enfer
(“Hell Square”), which later became place Denfert-Rochereau, and you can
take Métro line 4 or 6, or RER B to the stop of the same name.
See map p. 208. 1 place Denfert-Rochereau, 14e. % 01-43-22-47-63. Métro: Denfert-
Rochereau. The entrance is an unassuming small door where a plate reads ENTRÉE DES
CATACOMBES. Admission: 7 ($11) adults, 3.50 ($5.60) ages 14–26 and seniors, free
for children younger than 14. Open: Tues–Sun 10 a.m.–5 p.m. (last entry at 4 p.m.).
Les Égouts
One of Paris’s most popular tours is that of its sewers — you sometimes
have to wait as long as a half-hour in line. The tour starts with a short film
about the history of sewers: Though the tunnels here were laid out in the
1850s during the reign of Napoléon III, at the same time that Haussmann
was designing the grands boulevards, Paris’s sewers date all the way back
to Roman times. The film is followed by a visit to a small museum, and
finally the short trip through the maze. Paris’s sewers are laid out like an
underground city, with streets clearly labeled and each branch pipe bear-
ing the name of the building to which it’s connected. Don’t worry; you
won’t trudge through anything dégoutant (disgusting), but the visit may
leave your clothes smelling a bit ripe. Make this the last of the day’s attrac-
tions, and wear something you don’t plan to wear again until after the next
wash day. The ceiling occasionally drips water, but the tour guides insist
that it is only condensation, and thus, clean. Guided tours are free, and
most are in French, but English and also Spanish are available in summer.
Toward the end, a long montage of the evolution of the city’s drainage
system also gives a beautiful timeline of the entire city’s development as
a whole, from the pre-Roman period until present day. Plan on spending an
hour and a half to two hours.

See map p. 208. 7e. % 01-53-68-27-81. Métro: Alma-Marceau, then walk across the
bridge to the Left Bank. RER: Pont de l’Alma. The entrance is a stairway on the Seine
side of the Quai d’Orsay, facing no. 93; look for a free-standing ticket booth.
Admission: 3.80 ($6.10) adults, 3.05 ($4.90) for ages 5–16, free for children younger
than 5. Open: May–Sept Sat–Wed 11 a.m.–5 p.m., Oct–May 11 a.m.–4 p.m. Closed
two weeks in Jan.
Especially for history buffs
The city is filled with wonderful museums to satisfy even the pickiest
buff’s thirst for knowledge. Blue plaques on buildings tell you the names
of famous people and the dates that they lived there. Brown-and-orange
signs in French give you an overview of an area’s particular story. (For
those who have learned some French for the voyage, don’t despair if you
don’t recognize some of the verb endings in these signs! Any historical
writing makes use of a nonspoken literary past tense, the passé simple. It
is used to make people think of the described events as truly historical,
although personally it seems a bit pretentious!). This section gives a run-
down on places worth a visit.
Cabinet des Médailles
People who stumble by mistake into this free museum (once France’s orig-
inal national library, still referred to as the Bibliothèque Nationale de France)
love this place, and if you’re a treasure hunter — or pirate — this is the place
for you. Displayed here are archaeological objects, cameos, bronzes,
medals, and money originally amassed by French kings. Among the more
exceptional finds are the Treasure of Berthouville, a collection of Gallo-
Roman money; the Cameo of Sainte-Chapelle, a huge multicolored cameo
dating from the first century; and the Treasure of Childéric, one of the oldest
remnants of the French monarchy. Take a peek into the Salle Labrouste, a
lovely reading room built in 1868, which now echoes sadly without its book
collection (ten million books were removed in 1998 to the Bibliothèque
Nationale de France in the 13e). The garden, a virtual mini-Versailles, also
merits a stop. Security is tight here. Plan to spend at least an hour.
See map p. 208. Bibliothèque Nationale de France, 58 rue de Richelieu, 2e (between
rue des Filles St-Thomas and rue Colbert). % 01-53-79-83-30. Métro: Palais-Royal-
Musée du Louvre or Bourse. Bus: 20, 29, 39, 48, 67, 74, 85, 95. Admission: Free. Open:
Mon–Fri 1–5:45 p.m., Sat 1–4:45 p.m., Sun noon–6 p.m.
Cluny Museum
This is one of the jewels of Paris museums, and a tranquil place to visit in
the heart of the Latin Quarter. It’s home to the famous tapestry series The
Lady and the Unicorn. Officially called the Musée National du Moyen
Age/Thermes de Cluny, this is no dull Dark Ages museum. It houses ancient
Roman hot and cold baths, the original statues that furious revolutionar-
ies tore from Notre-Dame in 1790 (thinking they represented royalty), one
of the most beautiful tapestry series in the world, and a peaceful garden
Chapter 11: Discovering Paris’s Best Attractions 215

that makes reference to it. You also find remnants of clothing that royalty
wore in the Middle Ages, coins, leatherwork, and gothic furniture, as well
as church art — jeweled crosses, statues, sculptures, clothing, tapestries,
and paintings of saints.
In the 19th century, the Hôtel de Cluny belonged to a collector of medieval
art; upon his death in the 1840s, the government acquired the house and
its contents. You enter through a medieval cobblestone courtyard, the
Cour d’Honneur (Courtyard of Honor) — be sure to take in the turreted
building and its gargoyles; this is one of the only medieval residences left
in Paris. After paying for admission in the tiny lobby, turn left past the gift
shop (save it until last) and try to take it all in. The fascinating Roman
baths and the Notre-Dame statues are one floor down; one floor up is The
Lady and the Unicorn. The tapestries hang in a dimly lit room by them-
selves. You can sit in one of the cushioned seats and try to figure out the
meaning of the sixth tapestry. (The first five are an allegory representing
the five senses; the meaning of the sixth tapestry remains a mystery.) In
one of the medieval-period chambers being renovated, one can find a
detailed miniature model of the Cluny hotel, which anyone can touch — it
was placed there to give blind visitors the opportunity to feel the shapes
and construction used in the medieval architecture. The gift shop is a won-
derful place for souvenirs, and the renovated gardens are an oasis of calm
off one of the Latin Quarter’s busiest streets. Every plant (except two) in
The Lady and the Unicorn tapestries was extensively researched and
tracked down to be planted here.
See map p. 208. 6 place Paul-Painlevé, 5e (between rue du Sommerard and rue des
Écoles). % 01-53-73-78-00. Métro: Cluny-Sorbonne. Admission: 7.50 ($12) adults,
5.50 ($8.80) ages 18–26 and seniors, free for children younger than 18 and for all
first Sun of month. Open: Wed–Mon 9:15 a.m.–5:45 p.m. Closed Christmas, New Year’s
Day, and May 1.
Conciergerie
This was once one of the most elegant palaces in Europe, commissioned
by Phillippe le Bel in the 14th century. But the kings moved to the Louvre
and the building was left to be administrative offices of the crown. It was
turned into a prison in the 15th century, and it is probably most famous for
its days during the terror years of the French Revolution, when 4,164 “ene-
mies of the people,” including Marie Antoinette and her husband, Louis VXI,
resided here before meeting their fate. Visitors pass through the Tour
d’Argent (the Silver Tower), where the crown jewels were once stored, and
the Tour César to the Salle des Gardes (Guard Room) entrance. Probably
the most popular exhibit is Marie Antoinette’s 1-sq.-m (11-sq.-ft.) cell. More
than 4,000 of those imprisoned here headed for the guillotine on the place
de la Révolution (now the place de la Concorde), including revolutionary
ringleaders Danton and Robespierre, assassin Charlotte Corday, and the
poet André Chenier. The far western tower, the Tour Bonbec, came to be
known facetiously as the Tower of Babel because of the frequent screams
from the many prisoners tortured there. Marie Antoinette’s cell is now a
chapel, and the other cells have been transformed with exhibits and
Part IV: Exploring Paris 
216

mementos designed to convey a sense of prison life in a brutal era. Of wel-
come relief after the prison walls is the Women’s Courtyard, with a small
central garden and a fountain that was originally a bathhouse. Plan on
spending two hours both here and in Sainte-Chapelle, the high-Gothic
chapel and one of Paris’s top sights (mentioned earlier in this chapter) with
15 spectacular stained-glass windows that are simply awe-inspiring.
See map p. 208. Palais de Justice, Ile de la Cité, 1er. % 01-53-73-78-50. Métro: Cité,
Châtelet-Les Halles, or St-Michel. (Exit the Métro at Cité, which is between rue de la
Cité and bd. du Palais; the Palais is directly across bd. du Palais.) RER: St-Michel.
Admission: 6.50 ($10) adults, 4.50 ($7.20) ages 18–25, free for children under 18.
Open: Mar–Oct daily 9:30 a.m.–6 p.m., Nov–Feb daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m. Closed Christmas,
New Year’s Day, and May 1.
La Crypte Archéologique
This may be one of the best reasons to stop construction on a parking 
lot — ever. In 1965, excavations for a new parking lot under the parvis (a
portico in front of the church) of Notre-Dame revealed Gallo-Roman ram-
parts, third-century Gallo-Roman rooms heated by an underground fur-
nace system called a hypocaust, and cellars of houses dating back to
medieval times. The parking lot project was abandoned, and the excava-
tions were turned into this neat archaeological museum. Over the cen-
turies, builders erected new structures over the ruins of previous
settlements, raising the island about 7m (23 ft.). To help you visualize the
buildings that once stood here, scale models show how Paris grew from a
small settlement to a Roman city, and photographs show the pre-
Haussmann parvis. Allow about 45 minutes, longer if you’re a history buff.
See map p. 208. Place du parvis Notre-Dame, 4e (about 60m/200 ft. directly in front
of Notre-Dame, accessed by downward-leading stairs). % 01-55-42-50-10. Métro:
Cité. RER: St-Michel-Notre-Dame. Admission: 8 ($13) adults, 6 ($9.60) ages 26 and
younger. Open: Thurs–Tues 10 a.m.–6 p.m.
Musée Carnavalet
Housed inside two beautiful Renaissance mansions, Paris history comes
alive here through an incredible selection of paintings, reassembled rooms
in all their period glory, and other items from daily life long ago. The blue-
and-yellow rooms of Louis XV and Louis XVI are here in all their ornately
furnished glory. The chess pieces that Louis XVI played with while await-
ing his beheading are here, as are Napoléon’s cradle, Marie Antoinette’s
personal items, and a replica of Marcel Proust’s cork-lined bedroom. The
Cabinet Doré de l’hotel La Rivière room has a spectacular gilded, ceiling
painting of Apollo and Aurora by Charles Le Brun; his other ceiling paint-
ing is of Psyche with the Muses. Many salons depict events related to the
Revolution, and the paintings of what Paris used to look like are fascinat-
ing. Numerous models of the Bastille prison are represented, including one
depicting the peasant revolt itself. There is a wing devoted to the archae-
ology of Paris’s earliest settlements (some artifacts, such as the fishing
boats used by settlers, date back to between 2200 and 4400 B.C.). Visitors
Chapter 11: Discovering Paris’s Best Attractions 217

can even touch some of the exhibits here. A beautiful garden with access
only from the museum is a nice place to revive afterward. The courtyard
houses bas-reliefs of the season by celebrated architect François Mansart
(who enlarged the buildings) and next to it are zodiac signs carved in the
16th century by Jean Goujon. The statue in the center is Louis XIV, by
Coysevox. You may want to buy an English-language guidebook in the
museum’s gift shop, because audio guides are in French.

Musée d’Art et d’Histoire du Judaïsme
The beautiful 17th-century mansion Hôtel de St-Aignan houses this enor-
mous collection tracing the development of 2,000 years of Jewish culture
in France and also in Europe, from life in the Middle Ages to the 20th cen-
tury. In addition to beautifully crafted religious objects, including several
copies of the Torah, with breastplates, crowns, and cloth coverings from
different Jewish communities throughout the world, there are shofars,
menorahs, ark curtains, and spectacular velvet cloaks reflecting both the
Sephardic and Ashkenazi traditions throughout Europe and North Africa.
The museum has medieval gravestones and 20th-century paintings and
sculptures. The museum also presents very thoroughly the newly avail-
able documents relating to the Dreyfus affair, the notorious scandal that
falsely accused a Jewish army captain of providing secret military infor-
mation to the German government in 1894. The free audio tour is very
informative. The exhibits end with a collection of works by Jewish artists,
including paintings by Modigliani, Soutine, Zadkine, and Chagall. A fasci-
nating 2008 exhibit, “Looking for Owners,” traced the fate of art returned
by Germany after World War II. Allow at least two hours. Security is tight
here; you will have to pass through metal detectors.

Place de la Bastille
Ignore the traffic and try to imagine the place de la Bastille just more than
200 years ago, when it contained eight towers rising 30m (100 ft.). It was
here, on July 14, 1789 (now commemorated in France as Bastille Day), that
a mob attacked the old prison, launching the French Revolution. Although
the Bastille had long since fallen into disuse, it symbolized the arbitrary
power of a king who could imprison anyone for any reason, while the cit-
izenry paid high taxes for his follies, his biggest being the maintenance of
the court at Versailles. Prisoners of means could buy a spacious cell and
even host dinner parties, but the poor disappeared within the prison’s
recesses and sometimes drowned when the Seine overflowed its banks.
The attack on the prison was therefore a direct assault on royal power.
The Bastille was razed in 1792. In its place stands the Colonne de Juillet, a

Especially for art lovers
From galleries in the Marais, Bastille, St-Germain-des-Prés, and near the
Champs-Elysées, through Egyptian, Assyrian, and Greco-Roman art at
the Louvre, realism, Impressionism, and Art Nouveau at the Musée
d’Orsay, to the modern international masters at the Centre Pompidou, it
is an understatement to say that Paris offers a vast wealth of art.
But art in Paris is not merely French art. Though French movements
began or developed here, generations of artists from all parts of the
world have thrived in Paris, and the city’s museums and galleries hold
enough art for several lifetimes of daily viewing. If you’re an art lover
and happen to be in town in October, Paris presents the enormous Foire
Internationale d’Art Contemporain (www.fiac.com), one of the largest
contemporary art fairs in the world with stands from more than 150 gal-
leries, half of them foreign. The following museums are often less
crowded than their larger and more famous counterparts, but each has
plenty of wonders in store.
Fondation Cartier pour l’Art Contemporain
This trendy museum has displayed contemporary art since its opening in
1984. Supported by Cartier, the luxury jeweler and watchmaker, even the
building where the art is displayed itself is a gorgeous and flashy work.
Designed by architect Jean Nouvel it is too striking to miss: A glass-and-
metal screen stands between the street and the glass-and-metal building,
creating an optical illusion that makes the courtyard greenery appear as if
it is growing indoors. Most of the first-rate contemporary art exhibits that
the Cartier jewelry empire hosts are in the basement. Exhibitions at the time
of writing included moving image and sound works of video-artist and poet
Gary Hill; also the moving-image works of Japanese artist Tabaimo. The per-
manent collection is built around large groups of works by living artists and
includes paintings by artists such as Vija Celmins, Sam Francis, and Matthew
Barney, as well as photography by Nan Goldin, William Eggleston, Raymond
Depardon, and others; sculpture; huge installations; and video works.
Reservations are necessary for the très cool performance art and music of
Les Soirees Nomades (Nomadic Evenings) from July to October on some
Sundays, Wednesdays, and every Thursday night, from 5 to 9 p.m. There are
also workshops for children; in 2008, kids imagined themselves as giants
and sculpted artwork accordingly. Check the Web site for details about these
events. Plan to spend at least an hour and a half here.

Maison Européenne de la Photographie
Two renovated 18th-century town houses contain this sleek museum
which has the goal of making the three fundamental mediums of photog-
raphy — exhibition prints, the printed page, and film — accessible to all.
It succeeds on all fronts. A first-floor gallery exhibits original period prints
like Irving Penn’s photo of Colette, the vaulted 18th-century basement dis-
plays cutting-edge photography, film projections, and installations. There
is a space for young photographers to show their work, and the Roméo
Martinez library displays some 12,000 titles spanning the last 50 years of
photography. Martinez was editor-in-chief of Camera magazine for 20
years. There are permanent collections of Polaroid art and an excellent
video library that allows you to look up thousands of photographs.
Highlights of 2008 included an Annie Leibovitz exhibition, celebrating 15
years of her work. Allow at least an hour and a half including a pick-me-up
in the cozy vaulted 18th-century basement cafe. (Note: This cafe closes at
5 p.m. on Wednesdays; all other opening days it is open until 7 p.m.)

Musée Cognacq-Jay
La Samaritaine department store founder Ernest Cognacq and his wife
Marie-Louise Jay amassed at the turn of the 20th century this collection of
18th-century rococo art that features works by François Boucher, Jean-
Honoré Fragonard, Peter Paul Rubens, Louis-Michel van Loo, Jean-Antoine
Watteau, Elisabeth Vigée-LeBrun, and Giambattista Tiepolo displayed in
elegant Louis XV and Louis XVI paneled rooms. There is a collection of
everyday objects, such as dance cards, and snuff and candy boxes, shelves
of porcelain and porcelain figures, rich wood cabinets, and furniture. The
building housing it all is the beautifully preserved Hôtel Donon, built in
the 16th century. You can walk through a little manicured garden, open
May to September, to enjoy sunny days. Temporary exhibits are presented
two to three times a year. In 2006 one of the exhibitions included the his-
tory of the big department stores (grands magasins), and the artwork asso-
ciated with them, and how their invention elevated the couple for whom
the museum is named.

Plantes and not realize that this is an actual museum. Works are from 29
artists, including César, Ossip Zadkine, and Stagio Stahly.

Musée de l’Orangerie des Tuileries
Since spring, 2006, visitors have been delighting in the at-last renovated
Musée de l’Orangerie which had been undergoing repairs for close to a
decade. The highlight of the Orangerie is most definitely its two oval rooms
wrapped nearly 360 degrees with Monet’s Nymphéas, the water lily series
he painted especially for the Orangerie, and these rooms were the primary
focus of the renovations. The immense and awe-inspiring murals simply
pop from their spotless cream-white walls, lit brightly enough to accentu-
ate all of the beautifully emotional colors. But don’t make the water lily
paintings your sole reason to visit. Since 1984, the museum has also
housed the remarkable John Walter and Paul Guillaume art collection,
comprising works by Cézanne, Renoir, Rousseau, Matisse, Modigliani,
Dérain, Picasso, and Soutine, among other artists.

Musée du Quai Branly
This stunning museum, just a block from the Eiffel Tower, was designed
by premiere French architect Jean Nouvel, who is also responsible for the
Fondation Cartier and the Institut du Monde Arabe, and like these two cen-
ters, there is plenty of glass to let in light. Housed in four spectacular build-
ings (one has a wall of living plants) with a garden off from the quai Branly,
are the art, sculpture, and cultural materials of a vast range of non-Western
civilizations, separated into different sections that represent the tradi-
tional cultures of Africa, East and Southeast Asia, Oceania, Australia, the
Americas, and New Zealand. The pieces here come from the now defunct
Musée des Arts Africains et Océaniens, from the Louvre and the Musée de
l’Homme. Temporary exhibits are shown off in boxes all along the 180m
(600-ft.) exhibition hall. Incredible masterpieces are on display made by
some very advanced traditional civilizations: Some of the most impressive
exhibits present tribal masks of different cultures, some of which are so
lifelike and emotional in their creation that you can feel the fear and ela-
tion involved in their use, which is well documented in descriptions in
French and English. Allow two hours for a full visit; also take a stroll in
their carefully manicured garden, or have a café in their small cafeteria
across from the main building. There are numerous entrances to the
museum grounds from the area near the Eiffel tower; the main entrance is
on quai Branly. Note: You cannot buy your tickets at the museum. You also
must reserve the time of your visit at the same time you buy tickets. Order
online at www.ticketnet.com (the site is available in English; look for EN
at the top of the home page) or at a Fnac store (there is one at 74 av. du

Musée Gustave Moreau
Some of the paintings here are downright bizarre, which makes a visit here
all the more interesting. Gustave Moreau was a symbolist painter influ-
enced by the English pre-Raphaelites who may have been better known as
Henri Matisse’s teacher. He painted mythological fantasies in a sensuous,
romantic style with work that looks as if it is encrusted with jewels. The
artist himself established and designed this duplex museum studio so that
his symbolist work could be displayed the way he wanted long after his
death. More than 6,000 of Moreau’s works can be found here. Among them
are The Pretenders, The Life of Humanity, The Apparition, Orpheus by the
Tomb of Eurydice, and Jupiter and Semele. Moreau taught at the École des
Beaux-Arts; his museum’s first curator, Georges Rouault, was his favorite
student, among other famous artists such as Henri Matisse. The artist’s
apartment is also preserved here. An hour and a half should be plenty.

Musée Maillol
Curvaceous, bold, and graceful bronze statues of Aristide Maillol’s favorite
model, Dina Vierny, are on vibrant display as well as the works of
Impressionist and Postimpressionist artists in this renovated 18th-century
convent. Outside is the sculpted fountain of the four seasons by Edme
Bouchardon. But it is the important modern art collection inside that
rightly draws the most notice. The elegant upper floors of the museum dis-
play crayon and pastel sketches of Vierny, who Maillol discovered when
she was only 15 years old. He believed her voluptuous figure was the per-
sonification of femininity and she served as his exclusive model for ten
years. Maillol’s personal collection includes the work of his friends,
Matisse and Bonnard, as well as two sculptures by Rodin, works by
Gauguin, Dégas, Rousseau, Odilon Redon, Maurice Denis, Kandinsky, and
Renoir. Vierny, who collected art most of her life, has an important col-
lection of modern primitives that include Douanier, Rousseau, and Camille
Bombois, as well as drawings by Suzanne Valadon, Dégas, Picasso, and
Foujita. The museum features splendid temporary exhibits; a recent
exhibit was an ensemble of 59 photographs taken by Bert Stern in 1962 of
the striking and fragile Marilyn Monroe.

Musée Marmottan Monet
It’s a little off the beaten path — out in the 16th in an area of beautiful build-
ings between the Ranelagh garden and the Bois de Boulogne — but if you
have the time and the weather’s on your side, this exquisite museum
devoted to the works of Claude Monet is worth the trip. It contains the
world’s largest collection of Monet’s work, including his water lily paint-
ings as well as his more abstract representations of the Japanese Bridge at
Giverny. The painting that coined the term describing the painting style
and artistic movement, Impression: Sunrise, is located here. Monet’s per-
sonal collection can also be found here, with paintings and sculpture by
his contemporaries Pissarro, Manet, Morisot, and Renoir.
The museum is in a 19th-century mansion that belonged to the art histo-
rian Paul Marmottan. He donated his house and collection of Empire fur-
niture and Napoleonic art to the Académie des Beaux-Arts upon his death
in 1932.
Donations have expanded the collection to include more Impressionist
paintings and the stunning Wildenstein collection of late medieval French,
Italian, English, and Flemish illuminated manuscripts. Allow at least an
hour and a half for a visit.

Musée Zadkine
Head to this tranquil small museum before or after a trip to the Jardin du
Luxembourg; it’s located across the street from the park on the rue
d’Assas. It’s the perfect spot to view the works — about 300 sculptures
and more than 350 drawings — of Belarussian sculptor Ossip Zadkine. The
small statue garden is sheltered within walls of Virginia creeper, and
Japanese cherry, maple, and birch trees lend shade to the garden’s chang-
ing artwork. The garden and museum are free, the temporary exhibits
don’t cost much, and it’s worth a visit if you like contemporary sculpture
or you are familiar with the artist’s work. Zadkine moved to Paris around
1909 and lived and worked in this house and studio from 1928 until his
death in 1967. His art, books, tools, and furniture are all on display, as well
as many of his works in brass, wood, and stone. His bronze, Destroyed City
(1953), is considered a masterpiece; the model is exhibited here (the orig-
inal is in Rotterdam). The museum is accessed through an alleyway.

Paris’s literary landmarks aren’t all connected to Ernest Hemingway, F.
Scott Fitzgerald, and the “Lost Generation,” though it sure can seem that
way sometimes.
Brasserie de l’Ile St-Louis
If you’re a fan of From Here to Eternity or The Thin Red Line, pay a visit to
this brasserie (see also Chapter 10 for a review of the food), where novel-
ist and regular customer James Jones kept his own chope (mug) at the bar.
Not only is the location excellent — the building is situated directly off the
footbridge from Ile de la Cité to Ile St-Louis with a gorgeous view of the
eastern tip of Ile de la Cité (including the back of Notre-Dame and the
Panthéon in the distance) — but this eatery is one of the last remaining
independent brasseries in Paris. Jones lived with his family around the
corner on Ile de la Cité, and the film about their lives, A Soldier’s Daughter
Never Cries, was filmed in the neighborhood.

Brasserie Lipp and Café les Deux Magots
You can’t talk about literary Paris without mentioning Ernest Hemingway,
and two of his favorite hangouts are just across the street from each other
on boulevard St-Germain-des-Prés. Brasserie Lipp is where Hemingway lov-
ingly recalls eating potato salad in A Moveable Feast, and the Café les Deux
Magots is where Jake Barnes meets Lady Brett in The Sun Also Rises.
Tourism has driven up prices, so just go for a glass of wine or a coffee (and
remember that it’s cheaper standing up at the bar than sitting down at a
table). The people-watching will undoubtedly be good. Refrain, if you can,
from snapping flash photos; the regulars can get mighty annoyed!

Café de Flore
Next door to Les Deux Magots is this other infamous St-Germain-des-Prés
cafe. Sartre is said to have written Les Chemins de la Liberté (The Roads to
Freedom) at his table here, and he and Simone de Beauvoir saw people by
appointment here. Other regulars included André Malraux and Guillaume
Apollinaire. Since 1994, the cafe has each autumn awarded the approxi-
mately $8,000 Prix de Flore to a young writer of promising talent.

Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald went on a few famous benders. It has a
cabaret in the cellar, and the Bloody Mary was said to have been invented
here, but Harry’s high prices may dissuade you. If cost is no concern kick

and the place is just as crowded as it was in the 1930s, although its high,
high prices are geared toward a tourist crowd. Notable luminaries were
author John Dos Passos, Picasso, and Leon Trotsky. The Cloiserie’s true
claim to fame, however, is that Hemingway completed The Sun Also Rises
on the terrace here in just six weeks. Much of the novel also takes place
here.

Maison de Balzac
Novelist Honoré de Balzac wrote some of his most famous novels while
living in this rustic cabin in the very posh residential Passy neighborhood
from 1840 to 1847. He lived under a false name (M. de Breugnol) to avoid
creditors, and allowed entrance only to those who knew the password. He
wrote some of his La Comédie Humaine (The Human Comedy) here. See
his preserved study with portraits, leather-bound books, letters, and man-
uscripts on display. You can also see his jewel-encrusted cane (why spend
on bills when you can have jewels?) and the Limoges coffeepot that bears
his initials in mulberry pink. Expect to spend about 45 minutes here.

Maison de Victor Hugo
Here’s your chance to explore one of those gorgeous place des Vosges apart-
ments! Of course, if you or your kids have read The Hunchback of Notre-Dame
Chapter 11: Discovering Paris’s Best Attractions 225

or Les Miserables, you may want to visit here anyway. Victor Hugo lived on
the second floor of this town house (built in 1610) from 1832 to 1848. The
museum was designed to reflect the way Hugo structured his life: Before
Exile, During Exile, and After Exile. (He fled the country after an unsuccess-
ful revolt against President Louis Napoléon [who later became Napoléon III],
and returned to Paris 16 years later after the collapse of the Second Empire.)
You can see some of his furniture, samples of his handwriting, his inkwell,
first editions of his works, and a painting of his 1885 funeral procession at
the Arc de Triomphe. Portraits of his family adorn the walls, and the fan-
tastic Chinese salon from Hugo’s house on Guernsey where he was exiled is
reassembled here. The highlight is more than 450 of Hugo’s drawings, illus-
trating scenes from his own works. Plan to spend an hour here.

Shakespeare and Company Bookstore
The newest of the Shakespeares was opened by George Whitman in the
mid-1960s and named in honor the original Shakespeare & Co (he also
named his daughter, Sylvia Beach Whitman, after the original proprietor,
and she now manages the place with her father). It serves as a haven for
Americans and English speakers, playing the dual role of gathering place
and bookstore. Poetry readings take place on Sunday nights, and Whitman
will give lodging to a (debatably) lucky few writers or poets in exchange for
work in the store. Note that this is not the original Shakespeare and
Company. The original opened in 1919 at 6 rue Dupuytren (take the métro
to Odéon, walk through the square there, and turn left) by Sylvia Beach.
Two years later, Beach moved the shop to 12 rue de l’Odéon (the building
is no longer there) and stayed until the United States entered into World
War II (in German-occupied Paris, Beach was considered an enemy alien
and was forced to abandon shop).

Especially for nature lovers
Most parks are open until sunset, unless otherwise noted. Count on
spending at least one hour (much of that relaxing in the beautiful 
surroundings).
Bois de Boulogne
This huge park on the west side of Paris was once a royal forest and hunt-
ing ground. Napoléon III donated it to the city and Baron Haussmann trans-
formed it, using London’s Hyde Park as his model. Today the Bois is a 
vast reserve of more than 880 hectares (2,200 acres) with jogging paths,
bridle trails, bicycling (bike rental available Apr–Oct near the Les Sablons
Part IV: Exploring Paris 
226

entrance to the park), and boating on its Lac Inférieur and Lac Supérieur
(boat rental available at the northern edge of the Lac Inférieur). Also here
are the parc de la Bagatelle (see the listing later in this section); the famous
Longchamp and Auteuil racecourses; the Stade Roland Garros, where the
French Open is held; the Musée National de des Arts et Traditions
Populaire (documents French everyday life from the year 1000 to the pres-
ent); and the beautiful Pré Catalan, a lovely park in which it is said the
copper beech here has a span wider than any other tree in Paris. The Pré
Catalan contains the Jardin Shakespeare in which you can find many of
the plants and herbs mentioned in Shakespeare’s plays and the Pré Catalan
restaurant, one of Paris’s prettiest and most expensive restaurants. The
Jardin de l’Acclimatation (see “Especially for kids” earlier in this chapter)
is one of Parisian children’s favorite amusement parks. Les Serres
d’Auteuil, at the southeastern edge of the Bois, are the municipal green-
houses and gardens that supply Paris with its flowers and plants. Open to
the public, the greenhouses are especially nice to visit in winter; they pro-
vide a taste of the Caribbean with orchids, tropical plants, and palm trees.
As the sun sets, prostitutes in parked cars and vans line the road on each
side of the Porte Dauphine entrance, so the Bois is best enjoyed in daylight.
This park is so big that you can spend an entire afternoon here.
See map p. 208. 16e. Métro: Porte Dauphine or Les Sablons.
Bois de Vincennes
Once a hunting ground for kings, this is the largest green space in Paris.
Rent a boat at the two lakes here: Lac Daumesnil, on the west side of the
park has two islands connected by a bridge; Lac des Minimes is located on
the northwestern edge of the Bois. The Bois de Vincennes is home to the
parc Zoologique (which will be closed until 2012 years for renovations);
a Buddhist center right next to the bridge at Lac Daumesnil, complete with
temple and Buddha effigy; and the Château de Vincennes, in which early
monarchs Charles V and Henri III sought refuge from war and where Mata
Hari was executed in 1917. The Bois de Vincennes houses the spectacular
parc Floral de Paris (see the listing later in this section), the Hippodrome
de Vincennes for harness racing, and the Aquarium Tropical de la Porte
Dorée (see the “Especially for kids” section). This is also a big park where
you can enjoy spending an entire afternoon.
12e. Métro: Porte Doree or Chateau de Vincennes.
The Center for Nature Discovery, Garden 
in Memory of Diana, Princess of Wales
Diana fans now bring their messages and bouquets here instead of to the
flame at place de l’Alma (Métro: Alma-Marceau), near the entrance to the
tunnel where the princess, her friend Dodi Fayed, and driver Henri Paul
were killed in an automobile accident on August 31, 1997. In this small park
that opened in 2002, children discover how to grow flowers, vegetables,
and decorative plants and learn about nature. Plan on spending at least a
half-hour here.
21 rue des Blancs-Manteaux, 3e. Métro: Rambuteau.

Parc de Belleville
If you visit the bustling neighborhood of Belleville, stop in this park for its
beautiful views of western Paris. Topped by the Maison de l’Air, a museum
with displays devoted to the air that we breathe, there are fountains, a chil-
dren’s play area, and an open-air theater with concerts during the summer.
Rock formations and grottoes evoke the days when the hill was a strate-
gic point for fighting enemies such as Attila the Hun. Access the park by
taking the rue Piat off rue de Belleville and enter through an iron gate
spelling out the words Villa Ottoz. A curved path leads you to tree-lined
promenades (more than 500 trees are here), with the first of the magnifi-
cent Left Bank views peeping through the spaces between pretty houses.
Beds of roses and other seasonal flowers line walks, and views of the city’s
Left Bank become more pronounced the higher up the terraced pathways
you go.
20e. Métro: Pyrénées (walk down rue de Belleville and turn left onto rue Piat where
you see arched iron gates leading into the park) or Courrones (cross bd. de Belleville
and turn left onto rue Julien Lacroix to find another entrance).
Parc de la Bagatelle
Located in the Bois de Boulogne, the parc de la Bagatelle is known for its
gardens, which reveal the art of gardening through the centuries. The rose
garden was planted by Monet’s friend, Jean-Claude-Nicolas Forestier,
whose claim to fame was as designer of the Champs-de-Mars and other
gardens. His 10,000 roses of 1,200 varieties, peak in June. You can enjoy
bulbed plants (tulips, hyacinths, and so on) in March; peonies, clematis,
and irises in May; water lilies in June; dahlias and autumn foliage in
October; and winter-flowering trees, shrubs, and snowdrops during the
cold months. A water lily pond pays homage to that certain famous painter
of water lilies. Forestier was inspired by the Impressionists and their way
of showing flowers by species and emphasizing the effects of mass plant-
ing. The Orangerie here is home to the Festival Chopin à Paris from mid-
June to mid-July. The château, which you can view from the outside only,
was built by the Comte d’Artois in 1775, after he made a bet with his sister-
in-law, Marie Antoinette, that he could do it in less than 90 days. It took 66
days. Under Napoléon, it was used as a hunting lodge.
16e. Métro: Porte Maillot. Exit at av. Neuilly. Bus: 244 to the Bagatelle-Pré Catalan
stop.
Parc de la Villette
This modern park is part of the grounds of the Cité des Sciences et de
l’Industrie and has a series of themed gardens, including an exotic bamboo
garden and one featuring steam and water jets. Scattered throughout the
park are playgrounds and other attractions. (See “Especially for kids” earlier
in this chapter.) In the summer, you can catch an outdoor movie or listen to
a concert, and kids can play on a giant dragon slide. You can get to the parc

de la Villette by métro, but a fun, alternative route worth trying is the guided
canal trip to the park from Pont l’Arsenal or Musée d’Orsay with Paris Canal
(% 01-42-40-96-97; Métro: Bastille) or with Canauxrama (% 01-42-39-15-00;
Métro: Jaurés). See “Paris by Guided Tour” later in this chapter.
See map p. 208. 19e. Métro: Porte de la Villette.
Parc des Buttes-Chaumont
This former gypsum quarry and centuries-old dump is one of four man-
made parks Napoléon III commissioned to resemble the English gardens he
grew to love during his exile in England. It features cliffs, a suspension
bridge, waterfalls, a lake, and a cave topped by a temple. The waterfall
cave is musty, but romantic — it is listed in Où S’Embrasser à Paris (Where
to Kiss in Paris) as one of the top hidden make-out spots in the city (in the
mornings you may even have it to yourselves). This is worth a stop if
you’re in the area.
19e. Métro: Buttes-Chaumont. (The station is located within the park.)
Parc Floral de Paris
The Bois de Vincennes houses the spectacular parc Floral de Paris, with a
butterfly garden, library, and miniature golf course, as well as the parc
Zoologique de Paris. You can rent bikes here and ride around the exten-
sive grounds, or row a rented canoe around a winding pond. (You can even
rent quadricycles — bicycles built for four — for around 10/$12).
12e. % 01-55-94-20-20. Métro: Château de Vincennes. Exit at cours des Maréchaux
and walk south; the château is on the right. Cross av. des Minimes into the park.
Open: 9:30 a.m.–dusk.
Parc Monceau
This was Marcel Proust’s favorite park. A Dutch windmill, a Roman temple,
a covered bridge, waterfall, farm, medieval ruins, and a pagoda, all
designed by Carmontelle are some of the oddities in this park in Paris’s
ritzy 8th. It contains what is said to be Paris’s largest tree, an Oriental plane
tree with a circumference of almost 7m (23 ft.). Have a picnic on a bench
here with supplies from the rue de Levis (open Tues–Sun; Métro: Villiers)
and watch the English nannies from the nearby palatial apartment build-
ings stroll with their charges.
Boulevard de Coucelles, 8e. Métro: Monceau. (The métro station is at the edge of
the park.)
Promenade Plantée
New York City’s new High Line green space took as its example this old rail-
road bridge that was converted into a clever 5-km-long (3-mile) garden that
begins behind the Opéra Bastille, runs along the length of avenue Daumesnil,
the Reuilly Garden, and the Porte Dorée to the Bois de Vincennes (it makes
Chapter 11: Discovering Paris’s Best Attractions 229

a great jogging path). Beneath the promenade, artisans have built boutiques
and studios into the bridge, collectively known as the Viaduc des Arts.
Check them out for eclectic, unusual gifts.
12e. Métro: Bel Air or Dugommier. Walk from the métro to av. Daumesnil. The ele-
vated railroad bridge above av. Daumesnil is the Promenade Plantée.
Houses of the holy
Paris has had a tradition of worship since the first settlers on the Isle of
Parisii in the third century B.C. In fact, many of Paris’s churches were
built on the ruins of pagan temples. Today Paris’s churches are treasure
troves of fine art, stained glass, and architecture. Included here are some
of those worth a visit.
Église St-Etienne du Mont
Standing directly behind place du Panthéon, this is one of Paris’s most
extraordinary churches. Completed and consecrated in the 17th century,
on the site of a 13th-century abbey, the church is a unique blend of late
Gothic and Renaissance styles. Preserved near the chancel and set in an
ornate copper-trimmed shrine is the sarcophagus stone for Paris’s patron
saint Geneviève, who saved the city from the Huns in the fifth century. The
most impressive attraction here, however, is the 16th-century rood screen,
embraced by twin spiraling marble staircases — a stunning display of
Renaissance design. The tombs of Pascal and Racine are also here.
1 place St-Geneviève, 5e. % 01-43-54-11-79. Métro: Cardinal Lemoine. Open: Daily
Sept–June Mon–Sat 8:30 a.m.–noon and 2–7 p.m., Sun 9 a.m.–noon and 3:30–7:30
p.m.; July–Aug Tues–Sun 10 a.m.–noon and 4–7:15 p.m.
Église St-Eustache
This massive church at the heart of Les Halles was built between 1532 and
1637, combining a Gothic structure with Renaissance decoration. Molière
and Mme. de Pompadour were baptized here, and Molière’s funeral was
held here in 1673. This was the first church to contain the tombs of cele-
brated Parisians, most notably Louis XIV’s finance minister, Colbert. The
organ is one of the finest in Paris and has been entirely restored and mod-
ernized. Franz Liszt used to play the organ here, and there is a free concert
every Sunday at 5:30 p.m. There are also free jazz and piano concerts from
time to time.

Métro: Les Halles. Open: Mon–Fri 9:30 a.m.–7:30 p.m.
Église St-Germain-des-Prés
This is the most famous church in the 6th and one of the most important
Romanesque monuments in France. Built in the 11th century, St-Germain-
des-Prés was an important abbey and center of learning during the Middle
Part IV: Exploring Paris 
230

Ages. At the time of the French Revolution, the monks were expelled and
the church was vandalized. But much still remains, including the large
tower, the oldest in Paris. King John Casimir of Poland is buried at the
church, as is the heart of René Descartes. A small square at the corner of
place St-Germain-des-Prés and rue de l’Abbaye contains Picasso’s small
sculpture of the head of poet Guillaume Apollinaire.
3 place St-Germain-des-Prés, 6e. % 01-55-42-81-33. Métro: St-Germain-des-Prés.
Open: Daily 8 a.m.–8 p.m.
Église St-Julien le Pauvre
One of the oldest churches in Paris, this small example of Gothic splendor
sits in the lovely square René Viviani. Originally constructed in the 12th cen-
tury, it lies on the original pilgrimage route of St-Jacques de Compostelle to
Spain. The oldest tree in Paris, an acacia reputedly planted in 1602, still
stands in its garden. The church contains a stunning wooden screen, which
encloses a beautiful chancel. Many classical concerts take place here
throughout the year.
79 rue Galande, 5e. % 01-43-54-52-16. Métro: St-Michel. Open Mon–Sun 9:30 a.m.–
1 p.m.
Église St-Roch
This 17th-century church has the richest trove of painting and sculpture
in Paris outside a museum. Beginning on the right aisle, notice the bust of
Maréchal François de Créqui by Geneviève, Cardinal Dubois and Priests by
Coustou, and paintings by Louis Boulanger in the fourth chapel. The cele-
brated statue by Falconet, Le Christ au Jardin des Oliviers is at the entrance
to the choir, and other highlights include La Nativité by Anguier (on the
altar), the bust of Le Nôtre by Coysevox, and the monument to the painter
Mignard by Girardon (both on the left side). Classical music concerts are
played here on Tuesdays, often featuring compositions by Bach and
Vivaldi, starting around 12:30 p.m.
296 rue St-Honoré, 1er. % 01-42-44-13-20. Métro: Tuileries or Palais-Royal-Musée
du Louvre. Open: Mon–Sat 8 a.m.–7:30 p.m., Sun 8:30 a.m.–7:30 p.m.
Église St-Severin
A religious building has stood here since the sixth century. The current
building, begun in the 13th century, is in flamboyant Gothic style. The west
portal came from the church of St-Pierre-aux-Boeufs on the Ile de la Cité
before it was demolished in 1837. The dramatic palm-tree-shaped vaulting
only serves to enhance the brilliant stained-glass windows behind the altar
depicting the seven sacraments. Also notable is the chapel to the right of
the altar, which was designed by Mansart and contains an intensely
moving series of etchings by Georges Rouault and an extraordinary ren-
dering of the crucifixion by G. Schneider.

Mon–Sat 11 a.m.–7:30 p.m., Sun 9 a.m.–8:30 p.m.
Église St-Sulpice
This church, unfinished since the funds ran out in the mid–18th century,
houses three of Eugène Delacroix’s greatest masterpieces: Jacob Wrest-
ling with the Angel, Heliodorus Driven from the Temple, and St. Michael
Vanquishing the Devil. And that’s not all: During both equinoxes and at the
midday winter solstice, sunlight hits the bronze meridian line running
along the north-south transept, climbs the obelisk to the globe on top, and
lights the cross. The organ here is one of the grandest in Paris, built in
1781. More recently, and to the chagrin of the church caretakers, St-Sulpice
has become a tourist hot spot due to its feature in Dan Brown’s The
DaVinci Code. Among other things, the book suggests that the church had
been built on the site of a round pagan temple, with the meridian line as
the original outline of its boundaries. This is all untrue; however, it does
not make this beautiful and grand church any less interesting to visit.
Place St-Sulpice, 6e. % 01-42-34-59-65. Métro: St-Sulpice. Open: Daily 7 a.m.–

La Madeleine
Resembling a Roman temple, the Madeleine is one of Paris’s minor land-
marks. Although construction started in 1806, the Madeleine wasn’t con-
secrated as a church until 1842. The building was originally intended as a
temple to the glory of the Grande Armée (Napoléon’s idea, of course).
Climb the 28 steps leading to the facade and look back: You’ll be able to see
rue Royale, place de la Concorde and the obelisk, and, across the Seine,
the dome of Invalides. Inside, Rude’s Le Baptême du Christ is on the left as
you enter.
Place de la Madeleine, 8e. % 01-44-51-69-00. Métro: Madeleine. Open: Daily 7 a.m.–
7 p.m., closed Sun from 1:30–3:30 p.m.
La Mosquée de Paris
Built from 1922 to 1926 in the Hispano-Moorish style and overlooked by a
green and white minaret, this is one of the newer religious establishments
in Paris. The complex is divided into three sections for study, leisure, and
worship. At the heart is a patio surrounded by finely carved arcades, mod-
eled on the Alhambra in Granada, Spain. The Salon du Thé here is a lovely
place for refreshment, as popular for its Arabian Nights décor as it is for its
mint teas and baklava. Fountains, North African music, plush banquettes,
and mosaics create an exotic but casual hangout for the local student pop-
ulation. The hammam (steam baths) are a popular place with trendy types
who get massaged and exfoliated here (I hear it’s pretty painful!).

Paris’s Bridges
When you buy métro tickets, have a look at the logo. What looks like the
profile of a woman in a circle is actually an artistic rendering of the Seine
as it meanders through Paris. Here are just a few of the works of art
spanning that river.
Petit Pont
A bridge has spanned the Seine from the Left Bank to the Ile de la Cité since
the times of Julius Caesar, who wrote about one in his Commentaries. The
current incarnation is the Petit Pont (Little Bridge) which was built in 1853.
Pont des Arts
The Pont des Arts is one of Paris’s prettiest bridges. It’s a seven-arched
pedestrian-only footbridge connecting the Louvre and the Acadèmie
Française that originally opened in 1804 and was the first iron bridge on
the Seine. It suffered much bomb damage during World Wars I and II, and
barges often ran into it. It finally collapsed in 1979 and was replaced with
this steel version in 1984. You see plenty of artists painting the views of
the northern tip of Ile de la Cité, the Louvre, and the Acadèmie Française,
as well as pedestrians navigating the potted plants on their way to the
Louvre. During the warm seasons it becomes a popular picnic spot. Art
exhibits are occasionally displayed; this is one place perfect for photo ops.
Pont Neuf
The 12-arched Pont Neuf (New Bridge) is probably Paris’s most famous
bridge, and its design marks the end of the Middle Ages. Started in 1578,
it was finally completed in 1603 and opened to the public by Henri IV in
1603. A statue of Henri IV astride a horse divides the bridge into its two
spans, which are anchored on the tip of Ile de la Cité.
Métro: Pont Neuf.
Pont St-Michel
The Pont St-Michel has three arches and is decorated with a large letter N
which causes some to mistake it for the Pont Neuf. The N refers to
Napoléon III who had it built in 1857 to replace the crumbling bridge that
preceded it. Up until 1808, people lived in houses on the bridge.
Métro: St-Michel.

Paris by Guided Tour
If you’re a newcomer to the wonders of Paris, an orientation tour can
help you understand the city’s geography. But even if you’ve been
coming to Paris for ten years or more, one of the various tours can intro-
duce you to sides of the city you never knew existed. As you see in this
chapter, you have many good reasons for taking a guided tour. In fact,
being shown around by guides whose enthusiasm makes the city come
to life can be the high point of your entire trip.
Embarking on a bus
Paris is the perfect city to explore on your own, but if time is a priority,
or your energy is at low ebb, consider taking an introductory bus tour.
The top tour-bus company in town is Grayline’s Cityrama (% 01-44-55-
60-00; www.cityrama.com), which has a one-and-a-half-hour, top-sights
tour daily at 10 and 11:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m.; the cost is 20 ($32) adults,
10 ($16) children 4 to 11, free for children under 3. Cityrama also offers
various full-day tours of Paris from 78 to 100 ($125–$160), and three-
and four-hour historic and major sights tours starting at 48 ($77). The
four-hour “Seinorama” tour (daily at 2:15 p.m.) includes a drive up the
Champs-Elysées, a one-hour cruise on the Seine, and a stroll to the
second-floor of the Eiffel Tower. It costs 48 ($77) for adults and 24
($38) for children under 12.
Cityrama also offers a variety of “Paris by Night” tours with bus trips
around the illuminated city and perhaps a dinner and Seine Cruise start-
ing from 27 ($43); more deluxe packages include a show at the Moulin
Rouge or Paradis Latin or dinner in the Eiffel Tower (prices start at
98/$157). Cityrama offers free pickup from some hotels, or you can
meet at their office at 2 rue des Pyramides (Métro: Pyramides) between
rue St-Honoré and rue de Rivoli (across from the Louvre).
Paris L’OpenTour, 13 rue Auber, 9e (% 01-42-66-56-56; www.parisopen
tour.com; Métro: Havre-Caumartin), from Paris’s public transportation
system (the RATP), has quickly come to rival Cityrama. Its bright yellow
and green convertible double-decker buses take you to four different
areas, and you listen to recorded commentary in English through a set of
headphones given to you when you board. The “Paris Grand Tour”
covers Paris’s most central sights, minus the Islands: the Madeleine,
Opéra, the Louvre, Notre-Dame, St-Germain-des-Prés, Musée d’Orsay,
place de la Concorde, Champs-Elysées, Arc de Triomphe, Trocadéro,
Eiffel Tower, and Invalides. The “Montmartre-Grands Boulevards” tour
goes to the Montmartre funiculaire (but not up the Montmartre hill), the
Gare du Nord, Gare de l’Est, and the Grands Boulevards. The “Bastille-
Bercy Tour” goes east to Notre-Dame, the Bibliothèque Nationale de
François Mitterrand, Gare de Lyon, and parc Bercy. The “Montparnasse-
St-Germain-des-Prés” tour goes to the Jardin du Luxembourg, the
Part IV: Exploring Paris 
234

Observatory, the Tour Montparnasse, the Catacombes, Invalides, and 
St-Germain-des-Prés.
L’OpenTour makes its stops at regular city bus stops marked with the
L’OpenTour logo. You can board at any of these stops and buy a pass
right on the bus. The pass is also on sale at any branch of the Paris
Tourist Office, L’OpenTour kiosks near the Malesherbes (8e) and Anvers
(9e) bus stops, the RATP office at place de la Madeleine (8e), the
Montmartre tourist office (21 place du Tertre), the main Batobus docks
on the Seine, and the offices of Paris L’Open Tour at 13 rue Auber (9e),
and even the Cityrama office (address above). Your hotel may also have
the passes for sale; ask at the reception desk.
A one-day pass costs 29 ($46) for adults, 15 ($24) for children aged 
4 to 11; a two-day pass costs 32 ($51) for adults, 15 ($24) for children
4 to 11, and 22 ($35) for holders of the Paris Visite pass. You can get on
or off the bus as many times as you want, which, in my opinion, makes
this the more worthwhile tour. The buses run daily every 15 to 30 min-
utes throughout the year from about 9:15 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.
The RATP also runs the Balabus (% 01-58-76-16-16), a fleet of orange-
and-white buses that runs only on Sundays and holidays, 12:30 to 8 p.m.,
from April to September. Routes run between the Gare de Lyon and the
Grand Arche de La Défense, in both directions, and cost just one métro
ticket. Look for the Bb symbol across the side of the bus and on signs
posted along the route.
Touring by boat
One of the most beautiful ways to see Paris is by taking a sightseeing
boat cruise up and down Paris’s waterways. In addition to the Seine River
cruises (see the “Paris’s top attraction: The Seine river cruise” sidebar
earlier this chapter), try a longer and more unusual tour with Paris Canal
(% 01-42-40-96-97; www.pariscanal.com; Métro: Bastille). Its two-and-
a-half-hour cruises leave the Musée d’Orsay at 9:30 a.m. and end at parc
de la Villette. The boat passes under the Bastille and enters the Canal St-
Martin for a lazy journey along the tree-lined quai Jemmapes. You cruise
under bridges and through many locks. The boat leaves the parc de la
Villette at 2:30 p.m. for the same voyage in reverse, in front of the sign
that says “Folie des Visites du Parc,” and returns to quai d’Orsay at 5 p.m.
Reservations are essential. The trip costs 17 ($27) for adults, 14 ($22)
for ages 12 to 25 and older than 60, and 10 ($16) for children 4 to 11.
If you have restless young children, the wait for the water to rise at each
lock may prove too long. You may want to consider one of the shorter
Seine boat trips mentioned in Chapter 17 or take the canal cruise one
way and travel back by métro.
Canauxrama (% 01-42-39-15-00; www.canauxrama.com; Métro: Jaurès)
offers two-and-a-half-hour tours similar to Paris Canal’s at 9:45 a.m. and
2:30 p.m., leaving from Port l’Arsenal in the 12e and ending at the parc
Chapter 11: Discovering Paris’s Best Attractions 235

de la Villette in the 19e. The cost is 15 ($24) for adults, 11 ($18) for
ages 12 to 25, 8 ($13) for children 6 to 11, and free for children younger
than 6. Reservations are required.
Horsing around — a guided tour at two horsepower
Cruising around Paris in a tiny car with an open roof and a hilarious tour
guide is a terrific way to see the city! The Citroën 2CV (meaning two
chevaux, or two horsepower) was to France what the VW Beetle was to
the United States, and it was France’s most popular car from its debut
before World War II up to 1990, when Citroën stopped production. Now
you can tour Paris in its best-loved car with 4 Roues Sous 1 Parapluie
(Four Wheels Under an Umbrella; % 08-00-80-06-31 inside France; out-
side France 06-67-32-26-68; www.4roues-sous-1parapluie.com). One
to three people can choose from numerous tours that introduce essen-
tial monuments such as the Eiffel Tower, Notre-Dame, and the Place de la
Concorde, or see plazas and sites not normally frequented by tourists,
but that are still very much a part of the city’s charm: a DaVinci Code
tour, a tour of different gardens throughout the city, a shopping tour, a
secret Paris insider tour, a romantic evening for two that throws in
dinner and dessert, a cosmopolitan escapade four-hour tour. You can
even custom design your own tour. Prices start at 19 ($30) for a half-
hour trip to 144 ($230) per person in a group of three for the four-hour
Versailles tour. There are a variety of tours lasting a half-hour up to four
hours for trips outside the city. The chauffeur/tour guides are very funny
and full of knowledge, and each speaks English and French. These are
not big cars and a three-hour three-person (adult) tour could get uncom-
fortable. Reservations required by telephone or contact them online
through their secure server.
Walking your way across Paris
Paris Walks (% 01-48-09-21-40; www.paris-walks.com) is a popular
English-language outfit offering fascinating two-hour guided walks with
such themes as Paris During the Revolution, Hemingway’s Paris, the
Marais, the Village of Montmartre, Chocolate tour, the Latin Quarter, and
the Two Islands. Call for tours being offered during your visit and for
where and when to meet — usually at a métro station entrance at 10:30
a.m., and again at 2:30 p.m. Tours cost 10 ($16) adults, 8 ($13) stu-
dents under 25, and 5 ($8) children. They also offer weekend jaunts to
places such as Fontainebleau or Monet’s Gardens at Giverny or
Normandy landing beaches by car.
French Links (% 01-45-77-01-63; www.frenchlinks.com) is run by
Rachel Kaplan, the author of numerous guidebooks about living in Paris,
such as Best Buys to French Chic in Paris, as well as the continuously
updated Paris Insider Guides, who lets you customize your tour from a
two-hour walking tour, to a full-day cultural tour. Trained, experienced
guides with degrees in art and history lead you on such walks as Paris in
a Basket: Gourmet Market Tour, Gastronomical Paris Tour, Parisian Art
Nouveau, The Liberation of Paris, Photographer’s Walking Tour, and
Part IV: Exploring Paris 
236

many others. And they’re happy to help you design your own tour. The
talks are entertaining and fun, geared to everyone from high-school and
college-age students to retirees. Four-hour tours without transportation
start at 438 ($700) for one to four people. All tours must be prebooked
and prepaid with a U.S. bank check or by credit card (MasterCard, Visa,
or American Express) using their secure server.
Seeing Paris by bike
One of the best ways to see Paris — and burn off some of those rich din-
ners, too — is from the seat of a bike. Mayor Bertrand Delanöe, a huge
proponent of improving the city’s air quality, has introduced two initia-
tives. The first, Paris Respire (Paris Breathes), opens the roadways on
the banks of the Seine in the 1er, 4e, and 7e, the banks of the Canal St-
Martin in the 10e, roads in the 6e near Jardin du Luxembourg (Mar–Nov),
in the 14e, near Montmartre in the 18th, and the two big parks flanking
the city, the Bois de Vincennes (12e) and the Bois de Boulogne (16e) to
bikers, inline skaters, runners, and walkers on Sundays between 10 a.m.
and 5 p.m.
The second is the wildly popular bike rental program, Velib’. Since 2007,
some 20,000 bikes and their corresponding parking stations have
popped up all over the city. You can rent a bike near the Louvre and
return it anywhere a bike parking station is located in the city (per the
Paris Tourist Office, these stations are located 300m/984 ft. apart). You
must first buy a special card from a machine at any of the parking sta-
tions: Residents can buy a one-year “subscription” card, and visitors can
buy cards for shorter durations (Abonnement Courte Durée) of one day
for 1 ($1.60) or one week for 5 ($8). (Note: 150 [$240] is automati-
cally debited from your bank account as a security deposit and credited
back into the account after you safely return the bike.) With bike parking
stations located everywhere, many near métro stations, there is really
no reason not to ride, and the number of cyclists in Paris these days is
making the city resemble its neighbor to the north, Amsterdam. In fact,
the program is so popular, that sometimes, namely after 1 a.m. when the
métro shuts down and public transportation is hard to come by, there
aren’t enough bikes to go around. The disadvantage for Americans is the
payment system which takes only cartes à puces (European credit cards
or other cards with a microchip). Some American credit cards have
these, but if you aren’t sure, call your credit card company.
Not only can you rent bikes from Fat Tire Bike Tours (24 rue Edgar
Faure, 15e; % 01-56-58-10-54; www.fattirebiketoursparis.com), but
you can also take one very funny guided tour of the city on bikes or on
the Segway scooter. Look for someone holding a large white meeting-
point sign in front of the Pilier Sud (South Pillar) of the Eiffel Tower
(Pilier Sud is spelled out above the ticket booth) for the bike tour; look
for the guide on the Segway in the same place for the Segway tour.
Friendly guides take you on day or night bike tours of the city (24/$38
day for adults; 22/$35 day for students; night tours are $45 adults;
26/$42 students; 48/$77 and 44/$70, respectively, for both tours).
Chapter 11: Discovering Paris’s Best Attractions 237

The tours last four to four and a half hours. Day tours are at 11 a.m.
year-round, and also at 3 p.m. April 1 through October 31. Night tours,
which are beautiful (especially the ride past the Grand Pyramid through
the courtyard at the Louvre), take place at 7 p.m. nightly April 1 through
October 31, and at 6 p.m. nightly the month of March. Night tours take
place the month of November and February 15-30 on Saturday, Sunday,
Tuesday, and Thursday at 6 p.m. Reservations are required for Segway
tours (http://citysegwaytours.com).

Chapter 12
Shopping the Local Stores
In This Chapter
 Getting an overview of Paris’s shopping scene
 Understanding Customs and the VAT
 Finding the best department stores, street markets, and bargain shops
 Searching the prime shopping neighborhoods
W
ith the way the economy is in many English-speaking parts of the
world, shopping in Paris may not be high on one’s list of things to
do when visiting the city. Fortunately (or maybe not) even the window-
shopping is exquisite: Enticing goods are arranged just so in windows —
and the prices are listed. Believe it or not, bargains do exist here. From the
toniest haute couture shop to the hidden dêpot-vente (resale shop) selling
last year’s Yves Saint Laurent at fabulously reduced prices, even non-
shoppers can find something. This chapter gives you an overview of the
Parisian shopping scene, providing hints about where to find the bargains,
how to get it all home, and even how to get some of your money back.
Surveying the Scene
The cost of shopping in Paris isn’t always astronomical. If you plan only to
buy haute couture clothing, then yes, you’ll pay top prices. However, Paris
has many stores that sell clothing and goods at prices comparable to
what you’d pay in the United States. And some items in Paris are cheaper
even than they are in your hometown, including some French and
European brands of perfume and cosmetics, shoes, clothing from French-
based companies such as Petit Bateau and Lacoste, and French-made
porcelain, cookware, and glassware. You’ll obviously pay more for any
name brand imported from the United States, such as Donna Karan and
Calvin Klein, and for any souvenirs in areas heavily frequented by tourists.
Keep in mind that a 19.6 percent value-added tax (VAT) is tacked on to
the price of most products, which means that most things cost less at
home. (For details on getting a VAT refund, see the next section “Getting
the VAT back.”) Appliances, paper products, housewares, computer sup-
plies, electronics, and CDs are notoriously expensive in France, but
checking out prices of French products before your trip can help you
recognize a bargain.

Chapter 12: Shopping the Local Stores 241

Probably the best time to find a bargain in Paris is during the government-
mandated twice-annual sales (soldes) in January and July when merchan-
dise gets marked down 30 percent to 50 percent or more. You will often
see lines of Parisians outside their favorite stores the first days of the
sales. If you can brave the crowds, you just may find the perfect designer
outfit at a fraction of its retail price. Note: Though the sales are supposed
to last two weeks, they often run on much longer, often into the next
month, according to the amount of merchandise left.
Generally, store hours are Monday through Saturday from 9:30 a.m.
(sometimes 10 a.m.) to 7 p.m., and later on Thursday evenings, without a
break for lunch. Some smaller stores are closed Monday or Monday
mornings, and break for lunch for one to three hours, beginning at
around 1 p.m., but this schedule is becoming increasingly rare. Small
stores also may be closed for all or part of August and on some days
around Christmas and Easter. Sunday shopping is gradually making
inroads in Paris but is limited mostly to tourist areas; try the Carrousel
du Louvre at the Louvre, rue de Rivoli across from the Louvre, rue des
Francs-Bourgeois in the Marais, and the Champs-Elysées. The depart-
ment stores are open the five Sundays before Christmas, and occasion-
ally one or two Sundays during the annual sales.
Politeness is imperative when you shop in Paris. Always greet sales-
people at smaller stores with “Bonjour, madame” or “Bonjour, monsieur”
when you arrive (the Glossary in Appendix B can help with pronuncia-
tion). And regardless of whether you buy anything, say, “Merci, au
revoir” (“Thank you, goodbye”) when you leave.
Clothing sizes are different around the world. In French men’s trousers,
for example, add 10 to the waist size you wear in U.S. clothing to get the
French size. To determine what size you need to look for, check out
Table 12-1, which lists conversions for U.S. and Continental sizes.

Getting the VAT back
Whenever you spend more than 175 to 182 ($280–$291) in a single
store, you’re entitled to a partial refund on the value-added tax (VAT),
also referred to in France as TVA. The refund, however, isn’t automatic.
Food, wine, and tobacco don’t count, and the refund is granted only on
purchases that you take out of the country — not on merchandise that
you ship home. The amount of the refund varies; it’s 12 percent in
Galeries Lafayette and Printemps, and it may be anywhere from 15 per-
cent to 18 percent at smaller boutiques.
When applying for a refund, you must show the store clerk your pass-
port to prove your eligibility. You’re then given an export sales docu-
ment (in triplicate — two pink sheets and a green one), which you must
sign, and usually an envelope addressed to the store.
Two private tax refund companies operate in Paris, the bigger Global
Refund (www.globalrefund.com) and Premier Tax Free (www.
premiertaxfree.com).
When you spend more than 175 ($280) in a store that participates in
Global Refund’s Europe Tax-Free shopping program (indicated by the Tax-
Free sticker in the store’s windows), you’re given a Tax-Free Shopping
Cheque that shows the amount of refund owed to you when you leave the
country. Have this check stamped by a Customs officer in the airport, and
then take it to the special Global Refund counter for an instant refund.
Global Refund offices are located within department store Galeries
Lafayette and in the men’s boutique, Madelios, at 23 bd. de la Madeleine,
1er (Métro: Madeleine), in Charles de Gaulle airport at Terminal 1 depar-
tures level, Gate 26; Terminal 2A, Gate 5; Terminal 2B, Gate 7; Terminal 2C,
Gate 5; Terminal 2F, Gate 11; and in Terminal 3 on the Departures level. In
Orly Airport, there is only one Global Refund office in Orly South near the
international baggage claim on the departures level.
It works the same way with Premier Tax Free. Look for Premier Tax Free
stickers in the windows of stores participating in this program, and
Chapter 12: Shopping the Local Stores 243

spend more than 175 ($280) to get your refund. Premier Tax Free
offices are located at American Express, 11 rue Scribe, 9e (Métro: Opéra);
Travelex Opéra, 45 av. de l’Opéra (Métro: Opéra); at two Travelex
Champs-Elysées locations: 73 and 125 (Métro: Franklin D. Roosevelt and
Charles de Gaulle-Étoile, respectively), in Charles de Gaulle Airport
Terminal 1, Gate 26; and in Orly South on the departures level.
Department stores that cater to foreign visitors, such as Au Printemps
and Galeries Lafayette, have special détaxe areas where clerks prepare
your invoices for you. You must present your passport. Otherwise, when
you leave the country, bring all documents to the airport’s détaxe booth
and have a Customs official stamp them. Enclose the appropriate docu-
ment (the pink one) in the store envelope the clerk provided when you
bought your merchandise and mail it from the airport from which you
are leaving the European Union. The wait for a refund is anywhere from
one to six months. Travelers leaving from Charles de Gaulle Airport can
visit the détaxe refund point in Terminal 1 on the departure level
between Gate 14 and 16; in Terminal 2, Hall B between Doors 6 and 7
near the baggage claim area; or in Hall A between Doors 5 and 6; and in
Terminal T9, near the departure gates. At Orly, the détaxe booth is in
Orly West between Halls 3 and 4 on the departure level.
Whenever you’re claiming a tax refund, try to arrive at the airport as
early as possible because you must show everything you’re declaring to
a Customs official, and you may have to wait in line. Plus, after you finish
with détaxe, you must stand in line again to check your luggage.
If you’re traveling by train, go to the détaxe area in the station before
boarding because you can’t have your refund documents processed on
the train. Give the three sheets to the Customs official, who stamps
them and returns a pink and a green copy to you. Keep the green copy
and mail the pink copy to the store.
Your reimbursement is either mailed as a check (in euro) or credited to
your credit card account, which is better, as you may find it difficult to
cash a check for euro in your own country. If you don’t receive your tax
refund within six months, write to the store, giving the date of purchase,
and the location where the forms were given to Customs officials.
Include a photocopy of your green refund sheet.
Getting your goodies through Customs
Returning U.S. citizens, who’ve been away for 48 hours or more, are
allowed to bring back, once every 30 days, $800 worth of merchandise
duty-free (a duty is a tax). You’re charged a flat duty of 3 percent on the
next $1,000 worth of purchases; on gifts, the duty-free limit is $100 (any
item that costs more than $100 is subject to the full tax). U.S. citizens
have the right to bring back up to 200 cigarettes, 100 cigars, and one
liter of alcohol duty free; any larger amount will be taxed regardless of
whether or not you have reached the $800 limit. You can’t bring fresh
food into the United States (ignore what the people in the Paris duty-free
Part IV: Exploring Paris 
244

stores tell you; fresh meats and cheeses are not allowed); canned foods,
however, are allowed.
Citizens of the United Kingdom and Ireland who are returning from a
European Union (E.U.) country have no limit on what they can bring
back from an E.U. country, as long as the items are for personal use
(including gifts), and the necessary duty and taxes have been paid.
Limits are set at: 3,200 cigarettes, 200 cigars, 3kg (6.6 lbs.) smoking
tobacco, 10 liters of spirits, 90 liters of wine, and 110 liters of beer.
Canada allows its citizens a once-a-year C$750 exemption after spending
seven days out of the country, and you’re allowed to bring back duty
free: 200 cigarettes, 50 cigars, 200 grams smoking tobacco, 1.5 liters of
wine or 1.14 liters of liquor, and 50 cigars. In addition, you can mail gifts
to Canada from abroad at the value of up to C$60 a day, provided they’re
unsolicited and don’t contain alcohol, tobacco, or advertising matter.
Write on the package Unsolicited gift, under $60 value. All valuables need
to be declared on the Y-38 form before your departure from Canada,
including serial numbers of valuables you already own, such as expen-
sive foreign cameras.
The duty-free allowance in Australia is A$900 or A$450 for those
younger than 18 and does not include tobacco or alcohol. Upon return-
ing to Australia, citizens can bring in 250 cigarettes or 250 grams of loose
tobacco, and 2.25 liters of alcohol. If you’re returning with valuable
goods that you already own, such as foreign-made cameras, you need 
to file form B263.
The duty-free allowance for New Zealand is NZ$700. Citizens older than
17 can bring in 200 cigarettes or 50 cigars, or 250 grams total of tobacco
products, plus 4.5 liters of wine or beer, or up to three bottles of liquor
products that don’t exceed 1.125 liters.
Checking Out the Big Names
Two of Paris’s major department stores, Au Printemps and Galeries
Lafayette, offer visitors a 10 percent discount coupon, good in most
departments. If your hotel or travel agent doesn’t give you one of these
coupons (they’re sometimes attached to a city map), you can ask for
them at the stores’ welcome desks; the clerks speak English.
Check out the “Paris Shopping” map for the locations of the stores listed
here.
BHV
This store near the Marais and next door to l’Hôtel de Ville finally under-
went a much-needed renovation which removed its cute basement brico-
lage cafe in favor of more room for its hardwares. BHV (Bazar de l’Hôtel
de Ville) sells the usual clothing, cosmetics, luggage, and leather ware at
Chapter 12: Shopping the Local Stores 245

decent prices, but it’s really worth a visit because of its giant basement-
level hardware store with everything you need to fix up your home. Check
out its very cute pet store, BHV La Niche, at 42 rue de la Verriere (it has
some of the best small dog and cat carriers I’ve ever seen!).
52 rue de Rivoli, 1er. % 01-42-74-90-00. Métro: Hôtel de Ville.
Forum des Halles
This was the site of the original wholesale market of Paris, where merchants
would come from kilometers away to set up tables of fruits, vegetables,
dairy products, and so forth. In 1971 the market was formally moved to a
suburb outside the city limits, and a major RER and métro stop — “les
Halles” — and a mall complex were built. The forum is the closest thing to
a “mall” shopping center that one can find in Paris. In the place where once
stood fish-mongers and butchers of Emile Zola’s Le Ventre de Paris (les
Halles market is a centerpiece of the story) one can go clothes shopping in
the Gap, Celio, and H&M, buy CDs and DVDs at Fnac, buy furniture at
Habitat, get lunch, and even see a movie at the UGC theaters on the lowest
underground level. In 2007 architects Patrick Berger and Jacques Anziutti
won the bid for the total redesign of the Forum des Halles. Parisians have
regarded this central area of the shopping mall as an eyesore since its
redesign in 1975. Beware that the area can be seedy later on at night.
101 Porte Berger, 1er. % 01-44-76-96-56. Access from numerous doors surrounding
the complex, on rue Rambateau, rue Berger, and rue de Pierre Lescot; or enter
directly from métro station. Métro: Les Halles. Open: Sun.
Galeries Lafayette
Of the three major Paris department stores, Galeries Lafayette is probably
the most-visited by a hair due to its prolific advertising campaigns, such
as its billboards featuring supermodel Laetitia Casta. Merchandise here
ranges from good to excellent with lots of deals during the sales. Look for
women’s clothing from Sonia Rykiel, Comptoir des Cotonniers, and agnès b.
And check out the gourmet grocery store, Lafayette Gourmet, in the men’s
store. Main store restaurants include: Häagen-Dazs, Lina’s gourmet sand-
wiches, Fauchon tearoom and restaurant, McDonald’s, Café Sushi, and
Lafayette Café on the sixth floor, which has great views of Paris (it’s a self-
serve cafeteria and my personal favorite). If you don’t already have one,
ask at the front desk for the 10 percent discount coupon, good in most
departments. All the advertising has only benefited Galeries Lafayette:
This store gets downright crowded, and if you visit during the sales, pace
yourself or you can become thoroughly fatigued. Détaxe is 12 percent here.
40 bd. Haussmann, 9e. % 01-42-82-34-56. Métro: Opéra or Chaussée-d’Antin. Open:
Mon–Sat 9:30 a.m.–7:30 p.m.
La Samaritaine
Alas! Parisians bemoan the temporary closing of their beloved shopping
destination and 1920s architectural monument. La Samaritaine closed in
June 2005 after its president announced that the building had become, in
Part IV: Exploring Paris 
246

its advanced age, a serious fire risk. It will remain closed for around five
more years (estimates and official announcements dance around four to
six years); all of the electrical systems, plumbing, and fire systems will be
completely renovated. The owner of La Samaritaine (LVMH, the Möet-
Hennessy Louis Vuitton luxury group) has plans to relaunch the store as
an outlet for luxury brand clothing and other items, not unlike Harrods of
London fame. Located between the Louvre and the Pont Neuf, the depart-
ment store is housed in four buildings with Art Nouveau touches and an
Art Deco facade on quai du Louvre. Possessing the arguably perfect
rooftop view of Paris, it was named after a hydraulic pump originally
installed near the Pont Neuf in 1609. La Samaritaine will return, but for now

Halles.
Le Bon Marché
This is the Left Bank’s only department store, and it’s a wonderful respite
from the multibuilding, crowded shopping experience of Au Printemps and
Galeries Lafayette. Elegant, but small enough to be manageable, much of
the store’s merchandise is exquisite and includes designers such as Sonia
Rykiel, Bensimon, Vivienne Westwood, Burberry, and Yohji Yamamoto. The
main store’s third floor is particularly renowned for its large shoe selec-
tion and grand lingerie department (where dressing rooms have phones to
summon your salesperson). The basement features a beautiful bookstore
and upscale toys as well; in fact, many bourgeois Parisians head to Le Bon
Marché for their every shopping need. Thus, nothing here is cheap. Make
sure to visit Le Grand Épicerie next door (is there anything you can’t get
at Le Bon Marché?), where you can buy everything from toilet paper to
truffles. A cafe, Delicabar, above Le Grand Épicerie, has a menu divided
into tasty sweet and salty offerings, while the Café de la Grand Épicerie on
the second floor in the Home Décor section, features selections chosen by
the gourmet grocery store’s food, wine, and pastry professionals.
24 rue de Sèvres, 7e. % 01-44-39-80-00. Métro: Sèvres-Babylone.
Le Drugstore
Though not a department store (it’s more a mini-mall), Le Drugstore is
included here because it was once an important part of Parisian culture
in the 1960s, and its owner, ad giant Publicis, is hoping to regain that status
with a stunningly modern glass renovation that cost millions of euros.
Inside is a brasserie run by a disciple of multistarred French chef Alain
Ducasse (waitstaff is clothed by French designer Jean-Charles
Castelbajac), an invitation-only restaurant, Privé Marcel, an international
newsstand, a gift shop, a drug store (naturally), gourmet food, wine, and
cigar stores, and a Shu Uemura beauty products shop. Also here are movie
theaters and a cool bar with a terrace overlooking the Champs and the Arc
de Triomphe. Owned by Publicis since the late ’50s, Le Drugstore was the
Chapter 12: Shopping the Local Stores 247

height of cool in the 1960s when it was one of the few places in Paris you
could pick up a pack of cigarettes or a magazine at 2 a.m. (and in a sense,
it still is since most tabacs are closed by 11 p.m. at the latest, not to men-
tion newsstands). Has its new revamping made it the hip place it once was
while helping to push the Champs-Elysées into the 21st century? The jury
is still out.
131 av. du Champs-Elysées, 8e. % 01-44-43-79-00. Métro: Georges V, Charles de
Gaulle-Étoile. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–2 a.m.
Monoprix
These Target-like stores are Paris’s best-kept secret, where you can find
wonderful clothing, much of it fashion-forward, at reasonable prices along
with accessories, low-priced cosmetics, lingerie, and housewares. Many
locations also have large grocery stores, although the food is a bit pricey
(see below for cheaper supermarkets). The Champs-Elysées branch at 
no. 52 is open until midnight Monday to Saturday.
Various locations. % 08-10-08-40-00.
For those looking for grocery stores that are a little more reasonable
than Monoprix, Le Marché Franprix is the most inexpensive grocer that
still sells good quality vegetables, fruits, cheeses, mustards, and all the
normal French sundries. Their stores are on practically every other
street throughout the city. Another supermarket that’s a little bigger and
a bit more polished is Champion (% 08-10-05-50-00). They have a wider
selection than Franprix but still won’t break the bank.
Printemps
Printemps (formally and formerly known as Au Printemps) is one of Paris’s
largest department stores. Merchandise is sold in three different buildings:
Printemps de l’Homme (menswear), Printemps de la Maison (furniture and
accessories), and Printemps de la Mode (women and children’s fashion).
Well-known designers represented here include (but are certainly not lim-
ited to) Dolce & Gabbana, Armani, and Burberry. Fashion shows take place
under the 1920s glass cupola (seventh floor) at 10 a.m. every Tuesday
year-round, and every Friday from March to October. You can easily spend
a day here, and there are eight restaurants scattered throughout the three
buildings. The beauty department in the main building is, according to
Printemps, the largest in the world. There is a fabulous selection of lin-
gerie in the basement level of the main building, as well. Détaxe is offered
at 12 percent here.
64 bd. Haussmann, 9e. % 01-42-82-50-00. Métro: Havre-Caumartin. Open: Mon–Sat
9:35 a.m.–7 p.m., until 10 p.m. Thurs.
Tati
For the most part, Tati is frankly tacky, but where else can you find the occa-
sional funky top for 2 ($3.20)? Or wear-for-one-season shoes at 10 ($16)?
Part IV: Exploring Paris 
248

In fact, you never know what you may find here if you dig; the occasional
gem rewards those who are persistent. Tati also has a jewelry branch called
Tati Or, an eyewear store known as Tati Optic, and a travel agency called
Tati Vacances. Despite rumors of closing and the near-buyout of its Barbès-
Rochechouart location, business has bounced back and cheap clothing and
accessory items abound! Expect crowds.
4 bd. Rochechouart, 18e. % 01-55-29-52-20. Métro: Barbès-Rochechouart. Other
branches are located at 68 av. du Maine (% 01-56-89-06-80; Métro: Gaîté), 30 av.
d’Italie (% 01-53-80-97-70; Métro: Place d’Italie), and 76 av. Clichy, 17e (% 01-
58-22-28-90; Métro: La Fourche).
Taking It to the Street (Markets)
The huge Marché aux Puces de la Porte de St-Ouen, 18e, purportedly
the largest flea market in the world, is a real shopping adventure and
although you probably won’t snag a bargain, it’s still well worth the visit.
Open Saturday, Sunday, and Monday, it features several thousand stalls,
carts, shops, and vendors selling everything from vintage clothing (see if
you can find the vendor whose specialty is wearing her merchandise
from the mid-1800s) to antique chandeliers, paintings, furniture, and toys.
You need to arrive early to snag the deals — if you can find any. The best
times for bargains are right at opening time and just before closing time.
To reach the market, take the métro to the Porte de Clignancourt stop;
exit onto avenue de la Porte de Clignancourt. (You can also exit onto bd.
Omano, which turns into avenue de la Porte de Clignancourt.) Head
north a block and cross beneath an underpass; the markets begin on
your left. Open Saturday through Monday 9 a.m. to 8 p.m.
Starting at the underpass just past the Clignancourt Métro stop, you’ll
see stalls selling cheap junk, but don’t stop here! Turn left onto rue des
Rosiers, the market’s main street. Be alert; pickpockets roam the mar-
kets, especially the stalls on the periphery.
Don’t pay the ticketed price or the price the vendor first quotes you;
always haggle. You can usually get at least 10 percent off.
Visitors to Paris usually choose the Clignancourt market over the con-
vivial market at Porte de Vanves, 14e, a gem still waiting to be discov-
ered. Probably the smallest of the fleas, it’s nevertheless a good place to
browse among friendly dealers. To reach the market, take the métro to
the Porte de Vanves stop; exit at boulevard Brune; follow it east to
avenue Georges Lafenestre, and turn right. Open Saturday and Sunday
8:30 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. A cheap clothing market takes its place after 1 p.m.
Other flea markets include one at Porte Montreuil (Métro: Porte de
Montreuil) and another at place d’Aligre, 14e (Métro: Ledru-Rollin, open
9 a.m.–noon). Much more downscale, these markets give the term “junk”
a whole new meaning.

Scoring Bargains in Paris
The savvy Parisian waits for sales, knows the addresses of discounters,
and knows that some of the best fashion deals are found in resale shops
that deal directly with designer showrooms for half-price designer cloth-
ing that has been worn on a runway or used in a fashion shoot. And four
words are the key to her world: soldes (sales), dégriffés (designerwear
with the labels cut out), stock (overstock), and dêpot-vente (resale). Most
depôts-vente are on the Right Bank in the 8e, 16e, and 17e arrondisse-
ments. If you’re itching for a bargain after shopping for full-price items,
visit one of the streets where discount stores abound:
 Rue d’Alésia, 14e (Métro: Alésia), is filled with French designer dis-
count outlets selling last year’s overstock at up to 70 percent below
retail. These stock boutiques are more downscale than their sister
shops; be prepared to rifle through the racks to find the gems.
Outlets include Chevignon at no. 122, Darjeeling (a French lingerie
brand) at no. 68, Cacharel at no. 114, Georges Rech at no. 100, Tout
Compte Fait at no. 101bis, Via Veneto at no. 72 (for Dior, Armani,
and other designer menswear), and Jacadi at no. 116.
 Rue Paradis, 10e (Métro: Poissonnière), is filled with wholesale
china and porcelain stores such as Artoria at no. 32 and Editios
Paradis at no. 29.
 Rue St-Placide, 6e (Métro: Sèvres-Babylone), is also a street of
dreams with many discount stores, including Le Mouton à Cinq
Pattes (8 rue St-Placide) and La Générale de Pharmacie (no. 58),
which sells French cosmetics and skincare products at up to half
the normal prices. Discounted no-name shoes and housewares are
also sold on this street. Perpendicular to Le Bon Marché, St-Placide
is quite a relief on the pocketbook after perusing the wares at the
luxury department store.
 Boulevard de Rochechouart, 18e (Métro: Anvers or Barbès-
Rochechouart), is certainly not the prettiest of Paris’s boulevards
and can get awfully crowded. But for those who care about bar-
gains, is a street of deep discounts with multiple branches of Tati
(at 4 and 18), and a Celio Club (formerly Celio Stock) at no. 15,
among others. If you have time to spare after visiting Sacré-Coeur,
head south from the cathedral down rue Steinkerque or rue Seveste
and make a left onto boulevard de Rochechouart.
You can also try these discount stores spread throughout the city.
Anna Lowe
The sales pitch here is “big brands at small prices,” and if you consider
only the very best designers, this store is for you. It carries Yves Saint
Laurent, Chanel, and Giorgio Armani at a steep discount — at least 50 per-
cent. The clothes may be overstock or last year’s models with samples
from the runway. Most of the staff speaks English.

Miromesnil or St-Phillippe-de-Roule.
Annexe des Créateurs
This is made up of two stores — one devoted to selling gently worn
designer daywear, the other to barely worn evening wear. If you don’t mind
wearing resale togs, you could save yourself between 40 percent and 75
percent off the retail price of the items. The store has been described as
an Ali Baba’s cave entirely devoted to luxury, and the description is apt.
You find names like Chanel, Dior, Thierry Mugler, Louis Vuitton, Hermès,
Vivienne Westwood, and Jean-Paul Gaultier.
19 rue Godot de Mauroy, 9e. % 01-42-65-46-40. Métro: Hauvre-Caumartin or
Madeleine.
Bonpoint
These exquisite children’s clothes with such touches as hand-smocking,
lace collars, and velvet usually come with a steep price. However, this
Bonpoint branch, called boutique fin de série (end of series) sells end-of-
season clothes at reduced prices; it’s particularly good during the yearly
sales in January and July.
42 rue de l’Université, 7e. % 01-40-20-10-55. Métro: Rue-du-Bac.
La Clef des Marques
This large, somewhat drab store sells baby clothes, shoes, lingerie, sports
clothes, and end-of-series couture items. Racks are overfull so you have
to hunt a bit for a bargain.
124 bd. Raspail, 6e. % 01-45-49-31-00. Métro: Notre-Dame des Champs.
La Marelle
Located in the wonderful Galerie Vivienne, this store resells clothing from
some of the top designers in very good condition.
21 Galerie Vivienne, 2e. % 01-42-60-08-19. Métro: Palais Royal.
Le Depôt-Vente de Buci Bourbon
This resale store is actually two shops right next to each other with vintage
and not-so-old clothing and accessories for men and women along with
gently used furniture.
4 and 6 rue Bourbon Le Chateau, 6e. % 01-46-34-45-05 and 01-46-34-28-28. Métro: St-
Germain-des Prés or Mabillon.
Le Mouton à Cinq Pattes
Visit “the sheep with five legs” when you’re feeling energetic — racks 
at this dégriffé store are simply packed and the store is often crowded. It
Chapter 12: Shopping the Local Stores 251

carries extremely well-known designer names (most of the tags are ripped
out) on women’s, men’s, and children’s clothing, shoes, and accessories.
The stock changes constantly, so if you see something you like, grab it; it
won’t be there the next time.
8 and 18 rue St-Placide, 6e. % 01-45-48-86-26 for all stores. Métro: Sèvres-Babylone.
Another branch is located at 138 bd. St-Germain (% 01-43-26-49-25).
Masculin Direct
This sizable men’s store, located directly behind the BHV, carries sports
and evening wear by Pierre Cardin, Bayard, and Guy Laroche, all at dis-
counted prices. During the sales you can go mad here, but the rest of the
time the store is yours, with shopkeepers that only make you feel com-
fortable as you browse for that perfect-color shirt.
18 rue des Archives, 4e. % 01-42-77-16-56. Métro: Hôtel de Ville.
Mi-prix
This store, though at the edge of the city in the 15e, is worth the long trip:
Karl Lagerfeld, Missoni, and Gianfranco Ferré are just some of the labels
that are steeply discounted in this men’s discount store.
27 bd. Victor, 15e. % 01-48-28-42-48. Métro: Balard or Porte de Versailles.
Nip’ Shop
Yves Saint Laurent, Sonia Rykiel, and Guy Laroche are big labels here, but
lesser-known designers are also represented. It’s in the same neighbor-
hood as Réciproque (see the next listing), but much more intimate. Ask
the smiling woman who runs this shop for suggestions and advice; she
knows her wares and will find the item that has been waiting for you all
along.
6 rue Edmond-About, 16e. % 01-45-04-66-19. Métro: Rue de la Pompe.
Réciproque
This series of depôt-ventes (resale shops) on rue de la Pompe is the largest
in Paris for men, women, and children. Exhaust yourself among the jew-
elry, furs, belts, antiques, scarves, and designer purses (Hermès, Dior,
Gucci, and Louis Vuitton are just a few of the names I’ve seen). This store
is for shoppers willing to spend upwards of $1,000 on a gently worn Chanel
suit, less for other designers (a careful search can result in Hermès scarves
and ties at a third of their normal price!). Midrange labels are also well rep-
resented.
88, 89, 92, 93, 95, and 101 rue de la Pompe, 16e. % 01-47-04-30-28. No. 88 is a “gift
shop” with small accessories and jewels, nos. 89–95 are the different categories of
women’s clothing and shoes, and the men’s shop is exclusively at no. 101. Métro: Rue
de la Pompe. Closed Mon.

Hitting the Great Shopping Neighborhoods
You don’t need beaucoup bucks to afford to shop in Paris (except for
certain stores in the 8e!). Great deals for every taste and dollar amount
can be found. Read this section to get a significant head start in the hunt
for that perfect item.
Haute Couture at Haute Costs: The 8e
Head for the 8e to see why people like Carrie Bradshaw and Saudi
princes in need of a luxury shopping spree jet to Paris. Nearly every
French designer is based on two streets — avenue Montaigne (Métro:
Alma-Marceau, Franklin-D-Roosevelt) and rue du Faubourg St-Honoré
(Métro: Concorde) — where sales bills of more than 1,000 ($1,600) are
expected, and snooty sales clerks are par for the course. You can still
have a good time window-shopping here (and get an idea of what’s in
style), even if you don’t have a platinum card.
Although avenue Montaigne and rue du Faubourg St-Honor boast some
of the same big designer names, they are completely different in tem-
perament. Avenue Montaigne is wide, graceful, lined with chestnut trees,
and undeniably hip, attracting the likes of Dolce & Gabbana at no. 54
(% 01-42-25-68-78) and Prada at no. 10 (% 01-53-23-99-40). Other design-
ers on this street include Céline, 36 av. Montaigne (% 01-56-89-07-92);
Chanel, 42 av. Montaigne (% 01-47-23-74-12); Christian Dior, 30 av.
Montaigne (% 01-40-73-73-73); Ferragamo, 45 av. Montaigne (% 01-47-
23-36-37); Giorgio Armani, 18 av. Montaigne (% 01-42-61-55-09) Gucci,
60 av. Montaigne (% 01-56-69-80-80); Nina Ricci, 39 av. Montaigne 
(% 01-40-88-67-60); Ungaro, 2 av. Montaigne (% 01-53-57-00-00); and
Valentino, 17 av. Montaigne (% 01-47-23-64-61).
Rue du Faubourg St-Honoré is jammed with shoppers walking along the
small, narrow sidewalks. Begin at the rue Royale intersection and head
west. Prada is located at no. 6 (% 01-58-18-63-30); Yves St-Laurent for
women is at no. 38 (% 01-42-65-74-59), men at no. 32 (% 01-53-05-80-80).
Other high quality or haute couture designers include Gianni Versace at
54 rue du Faubourg St-Honoré (% 01-47-42-55-31); Givenchy, 28 rue du
Faubourg St-Honoré (% 01-42-68-31-00); Dominique Sirop, 14 rue
Foubourge St-Honoré (% 01-42-66-60-57); La Perla, 20 rue du Faubourg
St-Honoré (% 01-43-12-33-60); Chloé, 56 rue du Faubourg St-Honoré 
(% 01-44-94-33-00); Sonia Rykiel, 70 rue du Faubourg St-Honoré (% 01-
42-65-20-81); Pierre Cardin, 59 rue du Faubourg St-Honoré (% 01-42-66-
92-25); and Missoni, 1 rue du Faubourg-St-Honoré (% 01-44-51-96-96).
Funky and Unique: The 3e and 4e
There’s something for everyone in the Marais: Divide your time between
culture (15 different museums are right here) and commercialism in this
beautiful neighborhood crammed with magnificent Renaissance man-
sions, artists’ studios, secret courtyards, and some of the most original
shops in the city. Rue des Francs-Bourgeois (Métro: St-Paul or
Chapter 12: Shopping the Local Stores 253

Rambuteau), the highlight of the area, is full of small shops selling every-
thing from fashion to jewels. And its stores are open on Sunday! Rue des
Rosiers (Métro: St-Paul) is a fashion destination in its own right, with hot
designers flanking Jewish delis and falafel joints. Everything is really
close in the Marais, so don’t be afraid to ramble down the tiniest lane
whenever whim dictates. Part of the fun of this neighborhood is that it’s
such a mixed (shopping) bag.
Marais highlights include Paule Ka, 20 rue Mahler (% 01-40-29-96-03),
for the sort of 1960s clothing made famous by Grace Kelly, Jackie
Onassis, and Audrey Hepburn; Jacenko, 38 rue de Poitou (% 01-42-
71-80-38), for unique and immediately stylish menswear that is beauti-
fully tailored and soft to the touch; Autour du Monde, 8 and 12 rue des
Francs-Bourgeois (% 01-42-77-16-18), a clothing/housewares store
devoted to the innovative style line Bensimon: find comfortable dresses,
chic refurbished uniforms, delicate linen sheets, and inventive table-
ware; and Antik Batik, 8 rue Foin (% 01-48-87-95-95), a reasonably 
well-known French company featuring clothes inspired by numerous cul-
tures. Browsing their racks is a transcontinental flight: Find African
prints, wood beaded shirts and necklaces, as well as Chinese silk outfits
and salwar kameez ensembles accompanied by Indian-pattern inspired
scarves. Also check out Zadig et Voltaire, 16 rue Pavée (% 01-44-59-
39-06), a subtle and charming favorite of the well-dressed yet casual
Parisian. For the truly unusual, haute couture star Issey Miyake, 3 place
des Vosges (% 01-48-87-01-86), features loose but structured clothing
that screams “artist.” Fashion victims of the emaciated and avant-garde
(think black, white, and lots of sequins) should check out Tsutsu (70 rue
Vieille du Temple, 3e; 01-42-71-16-02). Covering your feet, Jean-Claude
Monderer, 22 rue des Francs Bourgeois (% 01-48-04-51-41), sells stylish
men’s and women’s sneakers, loafers, and sleek and slender going-out
shoes for both sexes, while more traditional men’s shoes are at Edouard
de Seine, 119 rue de Turenne (% 01-48-87-31-01), with another location
at rue Meslay.
Chic and Sophisticated: The 6e
Stylish young professionals with old family (called Bon Chic Bon Genre
or BCBG) call this, one of the prettiest areas in Paris, home. Here you
can shop with the BCBG amid bookstores, art and antiques galleries,
high-end designer clothing shops, decently priced shoe and accessories
stores, and sophisticated and trendy boutiques. You won’t go thirsty
with famed literary hangouts such as Café de Flore, Les Deux Magots,
and Brasserie Lipp nearby, and you may not even go broke — all price
ranges are represented here.
Louis Vuitton has a huge luggage-specialized store behind Les Deux
Magots on 6 place St-Germain (% 01-45-49-62-32), and Christian Dior
is nearby at 16–18 rue de l’Abbaye (% 01-56-24-90-53). Giorgio Armani
is at 149 bd. St-Germain (% 01-45-48-62-15); Céline, 58 rue de Rennes
(% 01-45-48-58-55); and Christian Lacroix, 2-4 place St-Sulpice (% 01-
46-33-48-95). Much more pleasing price-wise includes Italian designers
Part IV: Exploring Paris 
254

Stefanel, 54 rue de Rennes (% 01-45-44-06-07); Comptoir des Cotonniers,
59 Ter rue de Bonaparte (% 01-43-26-07-56); Et Vous, 69 rue de Rennes
(% 01-40-49-05-10); and Tara Jarmon, 18 rue de Four (% 01-46-33-26-60).
Also check out Blanc et Bleu, 28 rue Bonaparte (% 01-44-07-38-54); their
yacht-appropriate clothing evokes sailing images; it is for anyone who
loves boats. A similar store that sells the ubiquitous and authentic 
horizontal-striped sweaters of virile French sailors is Saint James, 66 rue
de Rennes.
The Marché St-Germain at 14 rue Lobineau is a modern shopping mall
that’s a bit out of place in a neighborhood known for bookstores and
upscale boutiques. Visit if you need to experience air-conditioning and
use the restrooms; otherwise don’t waste your time — why visit the Gap
and Zara kids when the styles are the same at home but the prices
higher?
Fierce and Youthful: The 2e
The 2nd arrondissement has a spread of different kinds of stores that
cater to Paris’s hip or branché (a synonym literally meaning “plugged
in”) and younger fashion crowd. The area sells a mix of high fashion,
specialty niche stores, and discounted wares; you can find the Jean-Paul
Gaultier boutique in the picturesque Galerie Vivienne on one end and
Kookaï Le Stock on the other. The cheapest shopping is in the Sentier
area, around the Sentier Métro stop, which is Paris’s garment district,
overlapping parts of the 3e and 1er. The best — but not the cheapest —
shops are found within a square formed on the south by rue Rambuteau,
on the west by rue du Louvre, on the north by rue Réamur, and on the
east by rue St-Martin. This area is where you can find hip secondhand
clothes, funky club wear, and stock boutiques selling last season’s designs
at a discount.
The neighborhood is considered to be chic and wealthy, but prostitutes
still frequent the area later in the afternoon and evening, especially rue
St-Denis.
For last year’s unsold stock of women’s and teen’s clothing, visit Kookaï
Le Stock, 82 rue Réamur, 2e (% 01-45-08-93-69). Espace Kiliwatch, 64
rue Tiquetonne, 2e (% 01-42-21-17-37), seems like a never-ending tour
through decades of vintage clothing and styles, persistence may reward
you with a bargain. Meanwhile the neighborhood mecca of club and
design gurus is at Kokon To Zai, 48 rue Tiquetonne, 2e (% 01-42-36-
92-41), selling well-known and emerging designer wear in a small store
decorated in vibrant colors. Anthony Peto, 56 rue Tiquetonne, 2e 
(% 01-40-26-60-68), has sold hats of all styles and colors (from the chic
and classy to the totally outrageous) in this location for 22 years. Le
Shop, 3 rue d’Argout, 2e (% 01-40-28-18-38), sells two floors of club
wear, skateboards, and CDs — often to new music spun by a live DJ.
Those with a more sophisticated palate (and deeper pockets) can go to
Barbara Bui, 23 rue Etienne-Marcel, 1er (% 01-40-26-43-65), for elegant,
Chapter 12: Shopping the Local Stores 255

contemporary fashion. Youthful and fresh, but still respectably fashion-
able for men is Chevignon, 26 rue Etienne Marcel, 1er (% 01-42-33-60-
20). For haute couture sophistication with an edge, head to Jean-Paul
Gaultier, 6 rue Vivienne (% 01-42-86-05-05). Find men’s, women’s, and
children’s clothes at agnès b at 2, 3, 6, and 19, rue du Jour (% 01-40-39-
96-88, 01-42-33-04-13, 01-45-08-56-56, and 01-42-33-27-34, respectively).
These carefully designed store sells timelessly chic and carefully
detailed outfits, with plenty of choices for the whole family (the men’s
store is at no. 3, children’s at no. 2, women’s at no. 6, and accessories 
at no. 19).
Bohemia: The 18th
There is some kinship between the Marais and Montmartre fashion, but
les Montmartrois (citizens of Montmartre), with their offbeat outfits and
offbeat jobs (artists, musicians, writers), have a style that seems to
come from other aesthetic eras. A lot of the stores around here feature
chunky but organic jewelry or dangling Indian metal decoratives, and
careful searching will provide boutiques selling soft leathers and care-
fully tailored tweed trousers, all next to flowing linens and funky, often
impossibly shaped hats. There are many more bargain finds here than
you would find in the Marais. The window shopping shouldn’t be
missed: Be sure to check out rue d’Orsel (one of the consignment shops
features a snow-white cat, sleeping on the shoes you might buy), rue
Lépic, and rue des Abbesses.

The arcades
You can’t speak of shopping without mentioning Paris’s quaint arcades. In the 19th
century, people, horses, and carriages crowded unpaved, dirty, badly lit streets. When
it rained, everything turned to mud. Imagine shopping in these conditions! But one
19th-century shopkeeper looking for innovative ways to draw crowds to his store pro-
posed displaying wares in pretty covered passageways with other merchants. And
thus, the first malls were born. These days, the charming iron and glass arcades are
still shopping havens, and the 2e has Paris’s greatest concentration, each with its own
character.
 Passage Choiseul, 44 rue des Petits-Champs (Métro: Quatre-Septembre), dates
from 1827 and is the longest and most colorful arcade, selling discount shoes and
clothing and used books. French writer Céline grew up here and included it in the
books Journey to the End of Night and Death on the Installment Plan.
 Passage des Panoramas, 11 bd. Montmartre and 10 rue St-Marc (Métro: Grands
Boulevards), opened in 1800 and was enlarged with the addition of galleries
Variétés, St-Marc, Montmartre, and Feydeau in 1834. Its stores sell stamps,
clothes, and gifts, and it’s the passage with the largest choice of dining options:
Korean food, a cafeteria, tea salons, and bistros.

The walking tour in Chapter 13 passes practically all of the boutiques
listed here!
Passé Devant, 62 rue d’Orsel (% 01-42-33-41-40), is a high-demand (its
number is unlisted) depot-vente or consignment shop that sells women’s
attire from couture lines or talented but discontinued boutique design-
ers. Bargains are hit or miss. Discover Heaven, 83 rue des Martyrs 
(% 01-44-92-92-92), where co-owner and designer Jean-Christopher
Peyrieux is one of the few Parisian boutique owners who is present to
help his clients pick out the perfectly divine outfits for men and women.
Jo., at 47 rue d’Orsel (% 01-55-79-99-16), has slim-cut menswear from
Emile Lafaurie (the best slacks in the city with reasonable price tags);
Jérémie Barthod, 7 rue des Trois Frères (% 01-42-62-54-50), features
unique costume jewelry — if twisted metal and glass beads could grow
Chapter 12: Shopping the Local Stores 257
 Passage Jouffroy, across the street at 10 bd. Montmartre (Métro: Grands
Boulevards), was built between 1845 and 1846. It became an instant hit as Paris’s
first heated gallery. After an extensive restoration of its tile floors, the gallery now
houses a variety of arty boutiques, including a dollhouse store, and an Italian cafe
that sells fancy kitchen gizmos such as espresso machines and vacuum-pump
wine stoppers.
 Passage Verdeau, 31 bis rue du Faubourg-Montmartre (Métro: Le Peletier), was
built at the same time as its neighbor, Passage Jouffroy. You can find old prints,
movie stills, books, and postcards here.
 Galerie Vivienne, 4 place des Petits-Champs, 5 rue de la Banque, or 6 rue Vivienne
(Métro: Bourse), is hands down the most gorgeous of all the arcades. Its classi-
cal friezes, mosaic floors, and graceful arches have been beautifully restored.
Built in 1823, this neoclassical arcade is now a national monument that attracts
upscale art galleries, hair salons, and boutiques, including Jean-Paul Gaultier.
 Galerie Colbert is linked to the adjoining Galerie Vivienne. It was built with a large
rotunda and decorated in Pompeian style in 1826 to capitalize on the success of
Galerie Vivienne.
 The pretty Passage du Grand Cerf, 10 rue Dussoubs (Métro: Etienne-Marcel), has
more of a modern bent, with jewelry designers, trendy clothing stores, furniture
stores with funky, “ethnic-inspired” pieces, decorative tchotchkes, and an ad
agency.
For a complete change of pace, head over to the following arcades, but keep in mind that
the neighborhoods aren’t the nicest. The Passage Brady, 46 rue du Faubourg St-Denis
(Métro: Strasbourg St-Denis), has become an exotic bazaar where Indian restaurants
and spice shops scent the air. The passage opened in 1828. The Passage du Caire, 2
place du Caire (Métro: Sentier), is one of the oldest arcades built in 1798 to commemo-
rate Napoléon’s triumphant entry into Cairo. It reflects the Egyptomania of the time with
fake columns and death masks of pharaohs on its exterior. In the heart of Paris’s Sentier
garment district, it’s home to clothing wholesalers and manufacturers.

naturally out of the ground, this is how they would look. Spree, 16 Rue
La Vieuville (% 01-42-33-41-40), is much larger than it seems, inconspic-
uously tucked away on a twisty street. Find good deals on the latest
fashions from Marc Jacobs and some smaller designers. Le Diable et
Moi, 29 rue des Abbesses (% 01-42-55-40-43), has hip and somewhat
expensive attire, including ironic T-shirts and short skirts primarily for
hipster chicks; while Colline, 20 rue des Abbesses (% 01-42-58-54-63),
is the place to get timeless cashmere sweaters, plush jackets, dresses,
and blouses with beautifully detailed and colorful prints.
Shopping in Paris from 
A(ntiques) to W(ine)
Listed here are some of the best stores representing both economy and
first-class shopping in the City of Light.
Antiques
Le Louvre des Antiquaires
This enormous mall is filled with all kinds of shops selling everything from
silverware to sketches by famous artists to Louis XIV furniture. Items are
pricey, but rumors have it that some good deals exist here. A cafe and toi-
lets are located on the second floor.
2 place du Palais-Royal, 1er. % 01-42-97-27-27. Métro: Palais-Royal-Musée du
Louvre.
Le Village St-Paul
This indoor-outdoor arts and antiques fair was once a 17th-century village.
Its shops display paintings, antiques, and other items, both inside and in
the courtyard. It’s easy to walk past the entrances, so look for the signs
just inside the narrow passageways between the houses on rue St-Paul,
rue Jardins St-Paul, and rue Charlemagne. Keep in mind that this is a very
popular destination on the weekend. Closed Tuesday and Wednesday.
23–27 rue St-Paul, 4e. No phone. Métro: St-Paul.
Bookstores
Gibert Joseph
Gibert Joseph is the Parisian students’ bookstore, selling new and second-
hand books, records, videos, and stationery on several floors and in several
branches on boulevard St-Michel. If you’re looking to learn some basic
French vocabulary or grammar, there are small practice textbooks for
English-speakers at rock-bottom prices. Late September, when students at
some of the nearby colleges buy their textbooks, it can get very crowded.
26 and 30 bd. St-Michel, 6e. % 01-44-41-88-88. Métro: Odéon or Cluny-Sorbonne.

Librarie Eyrolles
This convenient and charming bookstore has an extensive selection of
books on every topic imaginable, as well as stationery, fancy pens, and
even books in English, Spanish, and a handful of other languages. Its sell-
ing point for voyagers is the useful visitor information, like maps and
neighborhood guides, and a whole assortment of gifts to bring home,
including Paris flip-books for the kids and coffee-table book souvenirs
for the grown-ups.
55, 57, 61, and 63 bd. St-Germain, 6e. % 01-44-41-11-74. www.eyrolles.com.
Métro: Maubert-Mutualité.
Librarie La Hune
Sandwiched between cafes Les Deux Magots and de Flore, this bookstore
has been a center for Left Bank intellectuals since 1945 when Sartre was
among its clients. Most books are in French. It’s open until midnight every
night except Sunday.
170 bd. St-Germain, 6e. % 01-45-48-35-85. Métro: St-Germain.
Mona Lisait
The French hold their independent lifestyle very dear, and chain book-
stores don’t play a big part of the culture. Mona Lisait (a play-on-words of
the famous painting by Da Vinci, it translates as “Mona was reading”) is
one of the chains, but one I find acceptable because its stores always have
a great number of used books available — and the new ones are often on
sale. Some of the used books are barely touched and you’re sure to find a
bargain on some beautiful editions of famous works.
9 rue St-Martin, 4e. % 01-42-74-03-02. Métro: Rambuteau. Other locations at 7 bd.
Bonne Nouvelle, 2e, % 01-42-33-69-27, Métro: Bonne Nouvelle; and 39 rue Jussieu,
5e, % 01-40-51-81-22, Métro: Jussieu.
The Red Wheelbarrow
Founded by Canadian bookseller Penelope Fletcher Le Masson in 2001,
this cozy English-language bookstore not far from Le Village St-Paul (see
“Antiques” earlier) stocks primarily contemporary and classic literature,
with novels translated from French, general nonfiction, including a wide
range of Paris- and France-related titles, and an extensive children’s sec-
tion. They also carry some French-English bilingual books and stories set
in France.
22 rue St. Paul, 4e. % 01-48-04-75-08. Métro: St. Paul.
Shakespeare and Company
No, this isn’t the original (that was on rue l’Odéon), but English-speaking
residents of Paris and backpackers still gather in this wonderfully dark and
cluttered store, named after Sylvia Beach’s legendary literary lair and run
Chapter 12: Shopping the Local Stores 259

more and more these days by owner George Whitman’s daughter, Sylvia
Beach Whitman. There is a selection of new books, but most books are
used. Backpackers and willing travelers can sleep in beds among the
stacks, while working during the day to pay for a good night’s sleep. A fat
black cat lives there as well and has been sleeping on the same desk on
the second level each time I visited — you can pet him, he’s friendly. Note:
Poetry readings are held on Sundays.
37 rue de la Bûcherie, 5e. % 01-43-25-40-93. Métro or RER: St-Michel.
Village Voice
Quality fiction in English is the highlight of this small two-level store in St-
Germain-des-Prés, along with an excellent selection of poetry, plays, non-
fiction, and literary magazines. Owner Odile Hellier has been hosting free
poetry and prose readings with celebrated authors and poets since 1982,
and this is a wonderful place to attend an English-language reading. (Check
Paris Free Voice for readings.)
6 rue Princesse, 6e. % 01-46-33-36-47. Métro: Mabillon or St-Germain.
Ceramics, china, and glass
Baccarat
This famous crystal production house and museum used to be located at
a landmark building at 30 rue de Paradis. However the museum, boutique,
restaurant, and general quarters have moved to place des Etats-Unis in the
16e, a much more chic location. Several other boutiques throughout Paris
sell this famous brand of crystal, for which one will pay dearly.
11 place des Etats-Unis, 16e. % 01-40-22-11-00, museum, % 01-40-22-11-22, bou-
tique. Métro: Boissière.
La Maison Ivre
The Left Bank between St-Germain-des-Prés and the Seine is the unofficial
antiques and art gallery district, and this store sits right in the district’s
heart. It carries an excellent selection of handmade pottery from across
France, emphasis on the Provence region, and ceramics from southern
France. You can purchase beautiful, well-made pieces of ovenware, bowls,
platters, plates, pitchers, mugs, and vases.
38 rue Jacob, 6e. % 01-42-60-32-88. Métro: St-Germain-des-Prés.
Lumicristal
For discounted crystal by Daum, Limoges, and Baccarat, Lumicristal is the
place to shop.

Clothing for children
Du Pareil au Même
Du Pareil au Même is the place to buy clothes for every child on your list —
clothes are practical, très mignons (very cute), and very reasonably priced.
1 rue St-Denis, 1er. % 01-42-36-07-57. www.dpam.com. Métro: Châtelet. Many
branches are located throughout the city.
Jacadi
When BCBG women (see the “Chic and Sophisticated: The 6e” section ear-
lier in this chapter) have children, Jacadi is where they buy their very
proper children’s clothes that feature rich fabrics and such gorgeous
touches as hand-done smocking and pretty fabrics.
256 bd. St-Germain, 7e. % 01-42-84-30-40. www.jacadi.com. Métro: Suferino.
Many branches are located throughout the city.
Natalys
Part of a French chain with a dozen stores in Paris, Natalys sells children’s
wear, maternity wear, and related products.
74 rue de Rivoli, 1er. % 01-40-29-46-35. Métro: Hôtel de Ville. Other branches include
69 rue de Clichy, 9e, % 01-48-74-07-44; and 47 rue de Sèvres, 6e, % 01-45-48-77-12.
Petit Bateau
For years, women in the know have been stocking up on T-shirts from this
very cute (and somewhat expensive) brand of clothing that uses simple
patterns and color pairings to give a sense of delightful and well-made sim-
plicity. The signature “little boat” icons grace the front of their tops or
attach via little side-labels — anyone can feel like a small French kid chas-
ing pigeons through the Jardins de Luxembourg. I say anyone because Petit
Bateau, originally designed with infants, toddlers, and young children in
mind, now carries the same fun little-kid styles sized for adults!

branch is located at 266 bd. St-Germain, 7e. % 01-45-56-10-45.

Clothing for men
Celio
Dressing like a youthful Parisian man doesn’t have to kill your wallet. I
often call Celio “the French Gap,” which refers to their prices and their
menswear — shirts, polos, button-down pants, belts, jackets, and so 
forth — basically everything that Gap sells but with a specifically French
twist of small details and a bit more flair than the Gap would sell. Celio has
over 20 locations in Paris, but some carry limited lines of their wares.
Listed below are some of the bigger ones.
66 bd. du Montparnasse, 14e. % 01-45-38-90-03. Other boutiques are found at 65 rue
de Rivoli, 1e, % 01-42-21-18-04; and 4 rue Halèvy, 9e, % 01-42-68-30-60.
Chevignon
This fashionable men’s store gives fashion-forward looks that have indus-
trial detailing and nice colors that follow season trends de la mode. A chain
that’s sold in many countries, it’s almost impossible to find in the United
States, and when you do it’s heavily marked up. Ironically, printed text on
the clothing is often in English. Check out their scarves, sweaters, and zip-
ups that are very slimming and very French-looking.
26 rue Etienne Marcel, 2e. % 01-42-33-60-20. Métro: Etienne Marcel.
Façonnable
For quality shirts in nearly every color and casual pants, in addition to
jackets, suits, and other men’s finery (all a bit on the conservative side),
Façonnable is the place. In the United States, Nordstrom carries some of
Façonnable’s fashions, but this store has the entire line.
9 rue du Faubourg-St-Honoré, 8e. % 01-47-42-72-60. Métro: Madeleine or Concorde.
Another branch is located at 174 bd. St-Germain, 6e. % 01-40-49-02-47.
Madelios
This huge store offers one-stop shopping for men, selling everything from
overcoats to lighters to luggage. If companions get bored waiting, the store
is part of a small mall that has some nice stores for browsing.
23 bd. de la Madeleine, 1er. % 01-53-45-00-00. Métro: Madeleine.
S.D. Spontini
Looking like the urbane, ultra-Parisian man doesn’t have to be difficult:
S.D. Spontini has several boutiques throughout the city and boasts rea-
sonable prices for very fashionable menswear. These boutiques sport
funky button-down shirts good for drinks in lounges or sitting around in a
cafe. They also sell trendy shoes, belts, and those rib-textured sweaters
French men wear at almost any time of the year.
29 rue des Francs Bourgeois, 4e. % 01-44-78-70-71. Métro: St-Paul.

Ted Baker
This is the Paris branch of the London designer and sells relaxed dressy
and casual clothes with little details (like large French cuffs or a wild pat-
tern lining the collar) that set this brand apart.
20 rue des Francs Bourgeois, 3e. % 01-44-54-02-98. Métro: St-Paul.
Clothing for teens and the young-at-heart
Antoine et Lili
If you’re strolling the quays of the hip Canal St-Martin, have a peek into
this magenta-themed store selling youngish bohemian clothes and acces-
sories, and decorations that look great in dorm rooms or kitschy apart-
ments. Some fun items include picture frames made from colorful scrap
metal, or funky notebooks bound with hand-made paper. A garden and
small canteen also are located here.
95 quai Valmy, 10e. % 01-40-37-41-55. Métro: Gare de l’Est. Another branch can be
found at 90 rue des Martyrs, 18e, % 01-42-58-10-22.
Cop-Copine
Cutting-edge and flattering, Cop-Copine makes great youthful clothes that
enhance your good parts and disguise your not-as-good ones.
80 rue Rambuteau, 2e. % 01-40-28-49-72. Métro: Les Halles. RER: Châtelet-Les Halles.
H&M
Hennes & Mauritz, the Swedish “IKEA of fashion,” has a large selection of
up-to-the-minute men’s and women’s fashion at very low prices. This is
where you run to get the latest Prada copy — the store markets to the fash-
ion conscious. Due to its huge popularity, big fashion names like Karl
Lagerfeld and Stella McCartney have created lines for H&M, and in 2008
Japanese couture house Comme des Garçons took the lead at this “fash-
ion for all” equalizer.
120 rue de Rivoli, 1er. % 01-55-34-96-86. Métro: Hôtel-de-Ville or Louvre-Rivoli.
Mango
With locations throughout the city, this store is popular with young
Parisian women for its inexpensive, fashion-conscious, body-hugging
(sometimes tacky) clothes.
82 rue de Rivoli,1er. % 01-44-59-80-37. Métro: Hôtel-de-Ville or Louvre-Rivoli.

Form-fitting suits, dresses, and casual wear in synthetics and blends can

Clothing for women
Cacharel
Beautiful women’s, children’s, and men’s clothes are featured at Cacharel,
some in pretty Liberty-flower printed fabrics. A Cacharel overstock bou-
tique is at 114 rue Alésia, 14e (% 01-45-42-53-04).
64 rue Bonaparte, 6e. % 01-40-46-00-45. Métro: Saint-Sulpice.
Colette
This is Paris’s most cutting-edge clothing store, and everything from
designer clothes to cameras and beauty products is artistically arranged.
You can also find artsy tchotchkes, art magazines, and avant-garde coffee-
table books. Even if you don’t buy (the prices are astronomical), just look-
ing is fun and you can break for a snack or drink from one of the extensive
selection of waters at the basement Water Bar.
213 rue St-Honoré, 1er. % 01-55-35-33-95. Métro: Tuileries.
Comptoir des Cotonniers
This well-known designer has branches in the major department stores as
well as its own boutiques scattered around the city. Clothes are fashion-
able without being too cutting-edge and made well from cotton, wool, or
silk. Their numerous boutiques market to women from young to middle
aged. Styles, though not timeless, will last a few seasons at home.

Women’s clothing at Etam is made mostly from synthetic or synthetic-
blend fabrics, but the fashions are recent, and the stores are simply every-
where. Etam’s lingerie, sold in regular Etam stores and separately at Etam
Lingerie, has the best deals on pretty and affordable nightclothes and
underwear.

Franck et Fils is not a simple boutique: It is a mini department store of high-
class fashion, located in the snobby-chic 16e arrondissement village of
Passy. Catering to women only, one can pick up here such luxuries as
Chanel suits, new couture creations, fur-lined gloves, and beautiful hair
accessories, as well as elaborate hats, feather headbands, handbags, and
more. A staple shopping destination for chic Parisians.
80 rue de Passy, 16e. % 01-44-14-38-00. Métro: La Muette.
Gelati
Paris is home to exquisite shoe designers such as Christian Louboutin,
Robert Clergerie, and Maude Frizon, but if you can’t afford their high, high
prices, come to this fun shoe store that carries styles inspired by top
designers but doesn’t reflect their couture prices.
6 rue St-Sulpice, 6e. % 01-43-25-67-44. Métro: Mabillon.
La City
The clothes sold in numerous boutiques across Paris are perfect for work
or for going out to dinner, and young women are the target audience.
Although everything is synthetic, the prices are reasonable.
37 rue Chaussée d’Antin, 9e. % 01-48-74-41-00. Métro: Chaussée d’Antin.
1-2-3
Like La City, 1-2-3 targets young women looking for stylish suits, blouses,

ics or synthetic blends; clothing and accessories are sold at moderate
prices.

Viaduc des Arts
When the elevated railroad cutting across the 12e was transformed into
the Promenade Plantée, the space beneath was redesigned to accommo-
date a long stretch of artisan shops, galleries, furniture stores, and craft
boutiques. Some of the glasswork artists here are absolutely superb. If you
plan to visit the Bois de Vincennes via the Promenade Plantée, duck in for
a look on any day except Sunday, when it’s closed. The Viaduc Café here
(43 av. Daumensil) is a pleasant place for a light bite or a glass of wine.

Food
A La Mère de Famille
What other city has a candy store with over 240 years of experience?
Founded in 1861, this store sells the best chocolates, jams, herbal teas,
sweet bonbons, candied fruits, and everything you know you shouldn’t eat
but will anyway. Still in its original location on a picturesque corner near
Montmartre, try the rhubarb jam and pick up some candied chocolates
that look exactly like olives. Of course, everything is fantastic, so a simple
entry to inhale the perfume of a classic French candy store is the best way
to begin.
35 rue du Faubourg Montmartre, 9e. % 01-47-70-83-69. Métro: Cadet or Grands
Boulevards.
Fauchon
Paris’s original gourmet store is still going strong, opening small branches
all over the city. This is its flagship store, and here the signature pink-
labeled cans of coffee, caviar, foie gras, biscuits, wines, oils, candy, and
pastries fight for beautifully organized shelf space. If you’re in the area,
take a peek inside if only for its long history. Split into two parts, one sec-
tion carries the many prepackaged gourmet delights, clearly meant to be
gifts; the other carries staples. But save your shopping for other, cheaper
grocery stores that may stock, incidentally, some of Fauchon’s products.
Its tea salon is next door.

Hédiard
Across the street from rival Fauchon is Hédiard, a gourmet food shop that

stripes. Hédiard is slightly cheaper than Fauchon and has good prepared
hot and cold food. If you must have foie gras with your baguette, then
Hédiard is one of the places you can count on finding it. Branches are
located throughout the city.

exquisite foods you may ever see, including trout in aspic, fine pâtés and
salads, lobsters, and smoked salmon. The name has changed, but the qual-

rific spot to browse for gifts or for yourself. It has a good selection of wines,
and the house-brand merchandise, often cheaper than other labels, is of
very good quality. Eat at the prepared-food counters or sit at the small bar

This is one of the best luxury (meaning it’s not cheap) supermarkets in
Paris and a great place to look for gourmet gifts, such as olive oils, home-
made chocolates, fresh pastas, and wine. Food is artfully arranged in glass
cases, and the produce is some of the freshest around. It makes for won-
derful one-stop picnic shopping, too, offering a wide array of prepared
foods and cheeses and terrific snack food (some of it from the U.S.!).

La Maison du Chocolat
Each candy here is made from a blend of as many as six kinds of South
American and African chocolate, flavored with just about everything imag-
inable. The salespeople here know everything there is about mixing choco-
lates and their fillings; ask them to help you with an assortment if you think
you can contain yourself from stuffing them in your mouth all at once!
Possibly the classiest chocolate shop ever, the man selling ice cream at
the exterior of the shop wears a full suit, even during mid-July.

orful scarves (handmade in Central America, West Africa, and Southeast
Asia), a huge assortment of bracelets, necklaces, and dangly earrings made
of materials such as wood and seashells; also look for decorated pocket-
book mirrors, glasses cases, and other hand-luggage-sized tokens from

containers, labeled jars for farine and sucre (flour and sugar) — essentially
anything you could need for a cute French kitchen. I suggest as a gift a set
of espresso cups because they are easily portable and have fun designs.

W
ith so much to see in Paris, where do you start first? The itiner-
aries in this chapter help you figure it out. Branch out and
explore Paris’s interesting alleyways and pretty green spaces, which
you’ll encounter all around you. That is what is so much fun about Paris:
It reveals itself in all kinds of ways.
Making the Most of Paris in Three Days
On Day One, start early by having coffee and croissants at a cafe or pick
up a pastry at a boulangerie near your hotel to eat on the run, or if you
just can’t live a day without an American breakfast, take yourself to
Breakfast in America in the Latin Quarter or Marais. Then begin at the
true center of Paris: Notre-Dame on the Ile de la Cité. The cathedral is
the starting point for any tour, and Paris’s starting point, as well —
you’re at Kilomètre Zéro, from which all distances in France are meas-
ured. From there, take a short walk west to the island’s other Gothic
masterpiece — Sainte-Chapelle in the Palais de Justice. Afterward,
cross the Seine to the Louvre on the Right Bank. Select just a few rooms
in a particular collection for your first visit. The Louvre is one of the
world’s largest and finest museums, and it would take months to see
everything. Take a well-deserved lunch break in the museum’s comfort-
able Café Marly (see Chapter 10 for a description) overlooking I.M. Pei’s
pyramid, or if you want more, cheaper food choices, try the food court
on the Louvre’s second floor (escalators in the Carrousel de Louvre
where you enter give access).
From the museum, stroll west through the beautiful Jardin des Tuileries
looking out for the beautiful statues by Maillol, Rodin, and others to the
place de la Concorde, with its Egyptian obelisk and fountains. Continue
west up the Champs-Elysées, browsing some of the same stores you can
find in your own hometown (though Fnac and Virgin Megastore are
good places to buy music, and each has a cafe on the premises for a

break; Zara is good for the latest fashion at low prices; and Le Drugstore
has exquisite but pricey gifts and books), on either side of the avenue
until you come to the Arc de Triomphe. Pay it a visit, then find avenue
Marceau on the south side of the Arc and walk south or take bus 92 to
Alma Marceau and board the Bateaux-Mouches for a Seine boat ride
(see Chapter 11). After you disembark, have dinner at the friendly and
reasonably priced L’Assiette Lyonnaise, 21 rue Marbeuf, 8e (from Pont
L’Alma walk down av. George V to rue Marbeuf and make a right;
L’Assiette Lyonnaise is on your right).
Explore the Left Bank on Day Two. Take the métro to LaMotte-Picquet-
Grenelle and stop into Monoprix just across the street for cheap picnic
food from its grocery store. Walk north up avenue de Suffren until you
reach the École-Militaire. Facing it is the Eiffel Tower and its front lawn,
the Champs-de-Mars, where you can spread out to have a picnic after
visiting the tower. After your climb and subsequent lunch, head east on
the quai Branly and pay a quick visit to the beautiful Musée de quai
Branly to experience the art of traditional cultures of Africa, East and
Southeast Asia, Oceania, Australia and New Zealand, and the American
continents (note the live plants growing on the building’s outside walls).
Afterward head east on quai Branly (which turns into quai d’Orsay) until
you reach the grounds of Invalides and visit the gold-topped Église du
Dôme (which contains the Tomb of Napoléon). Admission also includes
entrance to the Musée de l’Armée. Across boulevard des Invalides is the
Musée Rodin, where you can enjoy a slow walk around the beautiful gar-
dens before gazing at the artwork inside. Still have energy? Great! Hop
on the métro at Varenne, at the corner of boulevard des Invalides and
Varenne (you should be able to buy a pick-me-up soda from one of the
machines on the platform), change to RER Line C, and arrive at Musée
d’Orsay. Afterward, walk over to the métro’s Assemblée Nationale sta-
tion at the intersection of boulevard St-Germain and rue de Lille. Take
the métro two stops to rue du Bac and exit onto boulevard St-Germain,
making sure to walk in the direction traffic is heading, all the while
browsing in upscale shops and art galleries. At place St-Germain-des-
Prés, look for one of the famous cafes, Café de Flore, Café Les Deux
Magots (see Chapter 10), or Brasserie Lipp and have a well-deserved
drink. When you finish, take rue Bonaparte (which intersects St-
Germain-des-Prés) south to Parisians’ favorite park, the Jardin du
Luxembourg. Stroll through the park (keeping an eye out for beehives
and a mini Statue of Liberty) and exit at the boulevard St-Michel gates on
the park’s east side. Walk north on boulevard St-Michel toward the river.
You’ll be in the Latin Quarter. The Panthéon is at the top of the hill on
rue Soufflot. You can enjoy a nice meal at one of the many inexpensive
restaurants located behind the Panthéon on rue Mouffetard.
On Day Three, get up early and hop on the métro to St-Paul, in the heart
of the Marais. Head east on rue St-Antoine, then turn north onto rue de
Birague which will take you right to Paris’s oldest square, the aristo-
cratic place des Vosges, bordered by 17th-century town houses. Exit on
rue des Francs-Bourgeois (for some great but a bit pricey shopping),
Part IV: Exploring Paris 
274

then turn north onto rue Vieille du Temple until you see the Musée
Picasso. Try to arrive when it opens at 9:30 a.m., and allow two hours for
your visit. Afterward double back on rue du Vieille du Temple to rue des
Rosiers and pick up a filling lunch from one of the many falafel places.
Browse the stores here and head west on rue des Francs Bourgeois,
which turns into rue Rambuteau. Follow rue Rambuteau west to rue
Beaubourg, where you’ll face the back of the wonderful Centre Georges
Pompidou. Spend two hours exploring it. Afterward, jump on the métro
at the Rambuteau station and head for Père-Lachaise. Spend the after-
noon searching out Cimitière Père-Lachaise’s famous residents with the
2 ($3.20) map (it’s the best one) sold outside the gates on boulevard de
Ménilmontant. Afterward, take the métro’s Line 2 to the Anvers station.
Walk north on rue Tardieu to the base of Sacré-Coeur. Take the funicular
(one métro ticket) to the top and then spend 15 to 20 minutes inside
Sacré-Coeur before climbing to its dome. After climbing down, head
behind the church to the place du Tertre, which still looks like an old-
fashioned Parisian square, despite artists begging to paint your picture
(some can be quite persuasive, but they’re too expensive, and it’s better
to just politely tell them “non, merci”). Even though the cafes are pictur-
esque — and more expensive — save your appetite for Au Poulbot
Gourmet, 39 rue Lamarck (follow rue Lamarck down the hill to no. 39)
for dinner.
Planning a Five-Day Visit
Spend the first three days as outlined in the “Making the Most of Paris in
Three Days” itinerary. Add the Conciergerie to your tour of Ile de la Cité
on Day One; the entrance is on the Seine side of the Palais de Justice.
On Day Four, visit Versailles. On Day Five, take the métro to Opéra to
visit the stunning Opéra Garnier with its mural by Marc Chagall. Then
head north to boulevard Haussmann to shop the rest of the afternoon
away at department stores Printemps and Galeries Lafayette. The sixth-
floor cafeteria at Galeries Lafayette offers plenty of lunch or dinner
choices — from a salad bar to grilled steaks and dessert.
A Walking Tour through the Marais
The Marais (translation: “swamp,” which it used to be), the old Jewish
quarter of Paris, is also now one of its hippest, chicest neighborhoods
with the new edging out a population that has called this area home
since the Middle Ages. Jo Goldenberg, a kosher deli, restaurant, and
Paris institution, closed its doors in 2006, and as rents skyrocket, the
family-run kosher pizza places, delis, and religious shops are giving way
to designer boutiques and restaurants. There is still a Jewish presence
here; the rue Pavée Orthodox Synagogue is the heart of the community,
but the beloved working class neighborhood is much changed. Some
Jewish residents are adapting, and others are moving to Paris’s farther
Chapter 13: Following an Itinerary 275

reaches in the 19e and 20e arrondissements. The mix of old and new
only enhances this quarter’s attractions, however, making the Marais
one of the best places to visit for tourists and locals alike.
Take the métro to the St-Paul station and after climbing the steps from
the station, turn right (or east) along the rue St-Antoine. On your right
will be the baroque church of St-Paul-St-Louis (badly in need of restora-
tion) where Victor Hugo was a parishioner and donated the holy water
fonts on each side of the entrance. Delacroix’s Christ in the Garden of
Olives is in the left transept, if you want to take a peek inside.
Turn right when leaving the church and walk across rue St-Antoine to the
Hôtel de Sully, a 17th-century mansion commissioned by Henri IV, that
houses the Caisse Nationale des Monuments Historiques et des Sites
that features some great photography exhibits. Walk through the front
courtyard into lovely formal gardens. This is a popular place for locals to
catch some sun on warm days. Walk through the courtyard in the direc-
tion of the building’s Orangerie, passing a bookstore on the left side
(inside you can see the building’s original painted wood beams) and exit
on the right side of the Orangerie to place des Vosges (see Chapter 11).
Thirty-six brick and stone pavilions rise from graceful arcades surround-
ing a gorgeous central plant- and flower-filled square. This used to be the
court of Henri IV, and the buildings were constructed according to strict
plan: The height of the facades equals their widths, and triangular roofs
are half as high as the facades. In the southeastern corner here is the
Maison de Victor Hugo (see Chapter 11), the prolific author of Les
Misérables and The Hunchback of Notre-Dame. After a quick (and free)
visit to his house, leave the square at the end opposite the entrance and
make a left onto rue des Francs-Bourgeois for some window shopping
(don’t miss the mouthwatering women’s clothing at BGN at 21, Zadig 
& Voltaire at 42, and Barbara Bui at 43) before hitting the Musée
Carnavalet (see Chapter 11) on the corner of rue de Sévigné. Facing the
Musée Carnavalet, turn right and continue up rue de Sévigné. Turn left at
rue du Parc-Royal, continue to place de Thorigny and make a right onto
rue de Thorigny. At no. 5 is the Musée Picasso.
This is one of the must-see museums of Paris, one of the largest collec-
tions of the master’s paintings (if not the largest) in the world. When fin-
ished, retrace your steps to the corner of rue du Parc-Royal and rue
Payenne. Turn right onto rue Payenne and stop by the pretty Square
Georges-Cain on the left, where you can see remnants from some of the
city’s demolished mansions. Follow rue des Francs-Bourgeois to no. 38,
the Allée des Arbalétriers, a typical medieval street with large paving
stones and overhanging floors. This was where Louis d’Orléans, King
Charles V’s brother, was hacked to death by goons for the duc de
Bourgogne. Make a right onto rue Vieille-du-Temple. On the corner is 
the late Gothic turret that is the only remnant of a mansion (the Hôtel
Hérouet), built around 1510. At no. 87 is the Hôtel de Rohan-Strasbourg,
no. 60 is the Hôtel de Guénegaud des Brosses which houses the Musée
Part IV: Exploring Paris 
276

de la Chase et Nature, no. 58 are the towers of the Hôtel de Clisson, a
14th-century mansion. No. 60 is the Hôtel de Soubise, where the Musée
de l’Histoire de France is located. Cross rue des Francs-Bourgeois, con-
tinuing on rue Vieille-du-Temple for the Hôtel Amelot-de-Bisseuil at no.
47 where Beaumarchais wrote The Marriage of Figaro in 1784. This is also
a terrific shopping street with Mosavitra (reasonably priced stained and
painted glass tiles) at 23, Japanese-influenced clothing at A la Bonne
Renommée at 26, award-winning lamp designer Salih Mekhici at 100,
and sporty and chic women’s clothing at A.P.C. at 112, among many
others. At the Hôtel Amelot-de-Bisseuil take a right and then turn left
onto the rue des Rosiers, the heart of the old Jewish quarter.
Much of the Jewish community here dates back to the 13th century and
references to the “street of rosebushes” (rosiers) appeared as early as
1230. This is where you’ll want to grab something filling, like a falafel from
L’As du Falafel at no. 34. If you turn right onto rue Pavée at the end of 
rue des Rosiers, you will see the synagogue at no. 10, built by Hector
Guimard, artisan of the Art Nouveau subway entrances. At the end of the
street is the St-Paul Métro station across rue St-Antoine. If you still have
energy, cross rue St-Antoine, take a right and walk to rue St-Paul. At no. 10
is the Musée de la Curiosité et de la Magie (see Chapter 11) and a bit far-
ther down is the Village St-Paul, a secluded 17th-century village–cum–
outdoor art and antiques fair. It’s easy to walk past the entrances which
are tucked between rue St-Paul, rue Jardins St-Paul, and rue Charlemagne
(look for the signs just inside the narrow passageways between houses).
You’ll find yourself in a cluster of interlocking courtyards lined with shops
selling antiques, paintings, and bric-a-brac. The haphazard arrangement of
courtyards dates from the 14th century when they were the walled gar-
dens of King Charles V. Also on rue St-Paul, for those travelers who miss
the United States, is Thanksgiving, a store selling such items as
Marshmallow Fluff and Fritos at no. 20. The English-language Little Red
Wheelbarrow bookstore is next door at no. 22. Retrace your steps up rue
St-Paul to rue St-Antoine to catch the métro to your next destination.
Take a Stroll through a Parisian Village
Montmartre has been revitalized by tourists, and the quarter itself is
fashionable and hip again. Its twisted streets and ivied walls are still just
as charming as the days before it was incorporated into the city, when it
was a village known for its cheap wines and artistic inhabitants (many
artists left Paris proper for Montmartre at night precisely because of the
cheap drinks). The twisting streets here can sometimes mean very con-
fused voyagers, but fear not! This half-day’s tour of Montmartre will have
you walking around like a local in no time.
Bring a map that has a good rendering of the 18th arrondissement.
Though getting lost is part of the fun of Montmartre, it’s getting out that
can get a bit frustrating.
Chapter 13: Following an Itinerary 277

 Scoping Abbesses, Part One: Start out at Place Blanche, to see
what might be the world’s most famous nightclub, the Moulin
Rouge. Take the requisite picture (lit up at night, it is most impres-
sive!), and walk up rue Lepic. Open during the day are great cheese
shops and small produce shops. At no. 12 is Lux-Bar, which opened
a century ago and continues to give locals a place to soothe their
palates. Across the street at no. 15 is Café des Deux Moulins of
Amélie fame. The interior remains mostly the same, with the glass
“toilettes” sign and the copper-topped bar (the cigarette counter
was removed a while ago for more space). A big poster of Amélie
graces the back wall. Turn right and walk down rue des Abbesses.
Here is some great shopping (Colline at no. 20 and Le Diable et
Moi at no. 29 bis). You will also pass fantastic boulangerie Le
Grenier du Pain, at no. 38, and a good people-watching cafe, Le
Sancerre, at no. 35, eventually ending up in place des Abbesses.
Here you will see the Eglise St-Jean-de-Montmartre, which was
built in 1904, and also the beautiful Art Deco entrance to the
Abbesses stop, designed by Hector Guimard. It is one of the last
two original métro entrances left in the city.
A good place to have a picnic lunch if you buy your sandwich from Le
Grenier à Pain is next to the “I love you wall” located in the Square Jehan
Rictus (just off of place des Abbesses, on the other side of the métro
entrance and the merry-go-round). In this small green space is a wall
with the words “I love you” (Je t’aime in French) written in over a hun-
dred different languages. Comme c’est romantique!
 Scoping Abbesses, Part Two: The next part of the tour leads up to
everyone’s favorite Montmartre landmark: Sacre Coeur. However,
the streets leading up to it are quite important — especially if you
like shopping. Walk along rue des Abbesses until you cross rue des
Martyrs. You’ll see an Antoine et Lili at no. 90, a shop perfect for
interesting little gifts for the college crowd. Then, take a quick left
and right onto rue Yvonne le Tac. At no. 9 you pass the entrance to
the chapel built on the supposed spot of the beheading of St. Denis,
for whom all of Montmartre (the word Montmartre comes from
mountain, or mont, of the martyr) is named. At no. 8 is a lovely
ivied building, while around the corner you pass the local cafe Au
Progrès at 7 rue des Trois Frères, perfectly situated in a four-way
crossroads, with the ideal panoramic view of Parisian streets. Make
another right and traverse rue d’Orsel. Here are art galleries, an
antique bookstore, and some really ugly modern furniture shops. If
it’s later at night, a great restaurant on this street is le Kokolion, at
no. 62. For menswear, go to Jo., at no. 47, and S.D. Spontinini, just
up the street at 1 rue de Trois Frères. A real circus supply store
(fun gift ideas!) is at Bonjour l’Artiste, at no. 35.
 Sacre Coeur and Place du Tertre: Climb the lamppost-divided
stairs famously depicted in the photograph by Brassaï, or for the
price of a métro ticket, take the funiculaire (walk from the Anvers
Métro station the short distance to rue Steinkerque and turn left
Part IV: Exploring Paris 
278

onto rue Tardieu). Enjoy the fantastic, free view for which you don’t
have to wait in line. Work started on this basilica in the 1870s and
the building is a pastiche of Romanesque and Byzantine styles.
Renoir, Picasso, Seurat, Degas, Van Gogh, and Zola all hung out in
Pigalle and Montmartre. And there was no keeping Toulouse-
Lautrec away, of course. Follow around the western side of the
basilica, passing the dwarfed Église St-Pierre du Montmartre, and
wander around Place du Tertre without letting yourself get too
abused by the painters dying to paint your picture. Here you can
truly see how this place was once its own village, with adorable
houses, old paned windows, and tiny cobblestone passageways
(not to mention some of the highest rents in the city). Walk around
the edges of the Place du Tertre area to the Espace Dalî at 11 rue
Poulbot, a small museum dedicated to Dalî’s work, of which there is
a plethora to see (and hear — his voice plays over eerie ambient
music). Then wander up rue des Saules, passing the famous
cabaret Au Lapin Agile at no. 22, a famous haunt of artists Picasso,
Modigliani, and Utrillo (they still have music shows here, but they
are vastly overpriced). Around the corner is the Musée de
Montmartre, at 12 rue Cortot, where you can learn all about the
history and art associated with this beloved part of Paris.
 There and back again: Once you’ve had enough of the hilltop,
make your way down through place Jean Baptiste Clément and
down rue de la Mire to rue Ravignan, where you can see a beautiful
house (built in 1911), located right across the street from 49 rue
Gabrielle, where Picasso had his first studio in Paris. On this street
are more art studios and funny narrow passages, as well as the
very fairly priced Chez Marie (no. 27; see Chapter 10 for the
review). Continue east to the upper portion of rue Lepic, where you
can catch a glimpse of the oldest and only remaining windmill in
Montmartre, Le Moulin de la Galette (unfortunately, you can’t visit
it). Descend farther past rue Berthe and onto rue Androuet, where
you will find the little Collignon grocery store from Amélie — she
really did live in Montmartre! You are again on rue des Trois Frères.
Follow it along and you will shortly pick up rue Ravignan again.
Here you can find the Bateau Lavoir, another studio haunted by the
likes of Picasso and Modigliani, at 11 bis place Emile Godeau. In this
spot, there are benches where you can rest before you end up back
at Abbesses, enjoying another quick view of the Paris skyline.

The Château de Versailles
Sofia Coppola’s movie version of the life of Marie Antoinette, “teen
queen,” generated renewed interest in the opulent Austrian import, but
even if you haven’t seen the film, you’ll discover that there’s more to
Versailles (% 01-30-83-78-00; www.chateauversailles.fr) than its
incredible château, of which the words “awe-inspiring” don’t begin to 
do justice. This palace is a small city on more than 800 hectares (2,000
acres) that houses formal and fanciful gardens, meadows (with sheep), 
a mile-long Grand Canal modeled on the one in Venice, the Grand and
Petit Trianon mansions, a hamlet (the Hameau) where Marie Antoinette
played peasant, the restored royal stables, a coach museum, fountains,
and woods. All this attests to the power royalty once had and to one
king who truly believed he deserved it: Louis XIV. The king hired the
best to build Versailles: Louis Le Vau and Jules Hardouin-Mansart,
France’s premier architects; André Le Nôtre, designer of the Tuileries
gardens; and Charles Le Brun, head of the Royal Academy of Painting
and Sculpture, who fashioned the interior. Construction got underway 
in 1661.

Day Trips from Paris
Chapter 14: Going Beyond Paris: Five Day Trips 281
In 1682, Louis XIV transferred the court to Versailles to live with him and
thus prevent plots against him. Historians estimate that anywhere from
3,000 to 10,000 people, including servants, lived at Versailles in the 100
years between the rules of Louis XIV and Louis XVI, and court etiquette
grew to be absurd. (Sometimes attendants engaged in power struggles
about who ranked high enough to dress Marie Antoinette while the
young queen waited, shivering. And Versailles’s female royalty gave
birth before a live audience; the higher the rank, the better the seat.)
When you see all this over-the-top magnificence and try to estimate the

cost, you may have a better understanding of the anger of the revolu-
tionaries a century later.
Louis XIV enjoyed an incredibly long reign of 72 years (though he was
only five years old when he inherited the title). When he died in 1715, 
he was succeeded by his great-grandson, Louis XV, who continued the
outrageous pomp and ceremony and made interior renovations and
redecorations until lack of funds forced him to stop. Louis XV’s son and
daughter-in-law, Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, made no major changes
at Versailles, but by then it was too late. On October 6, 1789, a mob voic-
ing the feelings of the average French citizen sick of bearing the brunt 
of the costs of royalty’s foibles, marched on the palace and forced the
royal couple to return to Paris. This was the beginning of the French
Revolution. The royal family eventually lost their lives, save one daugh-
ter (though some report that the young dauphin, or heir to the throne,
never really died in prison, but was spirited away from the country), and
Versailles ceased to be a royal residence.
The monarchy was reinstated in 1830, and Louis-Philippe, who reigned
from 1830 to 1848 and succeeded Louis XVIII, prevented Versailles’s
destruction by donating his own money to convert it into a museum
dedicated to the glory of France. In the mid–20th century, John D.
Rockefeller also contributed to the restoration of Versailles, and the
work from that contribution continues to this day. The nearby
“Versailles” map shows the current configuration.
Getting there
Catch the RER line C to Versailles from one of the stops at the Gare
d’Austerlitz, St-Michel, Musée d’Orsay, Invalides, Ponte d’Alma, Champ
de Mars, or Javel and take it to the Versailles Rive Gauche station (take
“direction Versailles-rive-gauche-château”), from which there’s a shuttle
bus to the château. Or, you can take the 15-minute walk through the
town, which is very pretty on its own. Round-trip tickets cost 5.80
($9.30) and the trip takes about 35 minutes. Eurailpass holders travel
free on the RER but must show their Eurailpass at the kiosk near any
RER entrance to receive a ticket that opens the turnstile leading to and
from the RER platforms.
An alternative method of reaching Versailles from central Paris involves
regular SNCF Transilien trains, which make frequent runs from two rail-
way stations — Gare St-Lazare and Gare Montparnasse — to Versailles.
Trains departing from Gare St-Lazare arrive at the Versailles Rive Droit
railway station; trains departing from Gare Montparnasse arrive at
Versailles Chantiers. The cost of the tickets is the same as the RER. Both
stations lie within a ten-minute walk of the château, which is a wonderful
way to orient yourself with the town, its geography, its scale, and its
architecture. If you can’t or don’t want to walk, you can take bus H, X, or
G, or (in midsummer) a shuttle bus marked either TRI or Château from
any of the three stations directly to the château for a fee of 2.50 ($4)
each way per person. Because of the vagaries of the bus schedules, it

may be easier to walk. Directions to the château are clearly signposted
from each railway station. Another method of arrival for the adventur-
ous is to take the 171 bus toward Versailles-place d’Armes. The bus
leaves from the Pont de Sèvres Métro station, at the southern end of 
line 9. The journey is roughly 25 minutes this way.
To reach Versailles by car, drive west on the A13 highway from Porte
d’Auteuil toward Rouen. Take the Versailles-Château exit, about 23km
(14 miles) from Paris. Park in the visitors’ parking lot at place d’Armes
for 4.50 ($7.20) Monday through Friday, 5.50 ($8.80) on weekends.

The drive takes about a half-hour, though in traffic it can take more than
an hour.
You can also take advantage of the Versailles Passeport (% 01-30-83-
78-00), a one-day pass to visit the entire Château de Versailles and all of
the surrounding attractions within the city. This includes audio guided
tours in the château, the chapel, the King and Queen’s Grand Apartments,
the Dauphin’s (Crown Prince) Apartments, and the Appartements de
Mesdames (ladies-in-waiting, open only on weekends during the low
season). The opera house, normally opened to the public, was closed in
June 2007 for renovations until further notice. After this massive opulent
castle visit, you have free reign of the parks, gardens, and forest groves,
the Grand Trianon (the nearby private retreat of Louis XIV), the Domaine
de Marie-Antoinette (Marie-Antoinette’s private fields, open from Apr 1 to
the end of Oct), and all of the temporary exhibits. If you use the Passeport
during the high season, the spectacle of Les Grands Eaux Musicales (see
later in this section) is also included. The tickets cost 20 ($32) during
the week and 25 ($40) during weekends and holidays; 16 ($26) for visi-
tors under 18. Keep in mind that seeing each attraction separately
requires purchasing your ticket at an Fnac or SNCF ticket booth.
Don’t want the hassle of getting to Versailles yourself? You can also take
a tour bus there. Cityrama, 2 place des Pyramides, 1er (% 01-44-55-61-
00; www.cityrama.fr), has different trips to Versailles ranging from 
47 to 137 ($75–$219) for adults, 24 to 96 ($38–$153) children (the
higher-priced tickets also include trips to Giverny, Fontainebleu, and
Barbizon). Paris Vision, 214 rue de Rivoli, 1er (% 01-42-60-30-01; www.
parisvision.com), offers bus excursions starting from 47 to 159
($75–$254); it’s half-price for ages 4 to 11.
Exploring Versailles
I cannot be more serious when I lay down two words of advice — arrive
early! If you really want to beat the crowds, get there at 8 a.m. when it
opens. More than three million tourists visit Versailles each year, and
you’ll want to have as much of a head start as possible. Plus, there’s
been additional influx since the Hall of Mirrors was reopened. The lines
have been a nightmare since then. Also, don’t be surprised by various
renovations taking place in public areas that have not been announced:
It seems that a lot of repair work is going on, which may affect your visit.
The first rooms you see in the palace are the six Louis XIV–style Grand
Appartements, which kings used for ceremonial events, and the Petit
Appartements, where they lived with their families. Louis XV stashed
his mistresses, Madame du Barry and Madame de Pompadour, in his
second-floor apartment, which you can visit only with a guide (the Petit
Trianon was built as a retreat for the king’s mistress, but Madame de
Pompadour died before it was completed). Attempts have been made 
to restore the original décor of the Queen’s bedchamber, which Marie
Antoinette renovated with a huge four-poster bed and silks in patterns 
Part IV: Exploring Paris 
284

of lilacs, her favorite flower, and peacock feathers. Look for the secret
door through which she attempted to escape.
Other magnificent rooms include the Salons of War and Peace, which
flank the palace’s most famous room, the 71m-long (236-ft.) Hall of
Mirrors. Hardouin-Mansart began work on the hall in 1678, and Le Brun
added 17 large windows and corresponding mirrors. The ceiling paint-
ings represent the accomplishments of Louis XIV’s government. Jacques-
Ange Gabriel designed the Library with its delicately carved panels. The
Clock Room contains Passement’s astronomical clock, which took 20
years to make; it’s encased in gilded bronze.
Gabriel also designed the Royal Opéra for Louis XV. Try to imagine it the
way it used to be during a concert — bearskin rugs under foot and the
light of 3,000 powerful candles. Hardouin-Mansart built the gold-and-
white Royal Chapel between 1699 and 1710. After his father’s death,
Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette prayed for guidance here, fearing they
were too young to run the country.
After you see the château, plan to spend at least an hour strolling
through the Formal Gardens, spread across 100 hectares (250 acres).
Here Le Nôtre created a Garden of Eden, using ornamental lakes and
canals, geometrically designed flowerbeds, and avenues bordered with
statuary. Louis XV, imagining he was in Venice, would take gondola rides
with his lover of the moment on the mile-long Grand Canal. The restored
vegetable gardens (le Potager de Roi) are here, as well. If you visit on a
weekend in the summer, try to take in Les Grands Eaux Musicales, a
show in which the fountains move in time to the classical music of Bach,
Mozart, or Berlioz. Cost is 8 ($13) adults, 6 ($9.60) ages 10 to 26 and
seniors, children younger than 10 are free. Another spectacle is Les
Fêtes de Nuit de Versailles, a variety of breathtaking shows, combining
sound-and-light displays with fireworks, but also featuring dance, pup-
petry, and high quality theatrics that the French do well. Held between
June and September, the kids will definitely enjoy these as much as you.
Prices range from 30 ($48) for adults to 20 ($32) under 18. Seniors,
children younger than ten are free. (For reservations to either show, see
www.chateauversaillesspectacles.fr or call % 01-30-83-78-89 or
% 01-39-20-16-20.)
Because of the crowds and long lines, most guests are content to visit
only the château and gardens, but you can see much more at Versailles if
you have the stamina. The most important of the remaining sights are
the Grand Trianon and the recently renovated Petit Trianon. Trianon
was the name of the town that Louis bought and then razed in order to
construct a mansion, le Grand Trianon, where he could eat light meals
away from the palace. Designed in 1687, again by Hardouin-Mansart, the
Grand Trianon has traditionally served as a residence for the country’s
important guests, although former President Charles de Gaulle wanted
to turn it into a weekend retreat for himself. Napoléon I spent the night
here, and U.S. President Richard Nixon slept in the room where Madame
Chapter 14: Going Beyond Paris: Five Day Trips 285

de Pompadour (Louis XV’s mistress) died. Gabriel, the designer of the
place de la Concorde, built the Petit Trianon in 1768 for Louis XV, who
used it for trysts with Madame du Barry, his mistress after de Pompadour.
Marie Antoinette adopted it as her favorite residence, where she could
escape the constraints of palace life.
Behind the Petit Trianon is the Hamlet, a collection of small thatched
farmhouses and a water mill, a setting where Marie Antoinette pre-
tended she was back at her family’s country retreat in Austria. Near the
Hamlet is the Temple of Love, built in 1775 by Richard Mique, Marie
Antoinette’s favorite architect. In the center of its Corinthian colonnade
is a reproduction of Bouchardon’s Cupid shaping a bow from the club of
Hercules.
Louis XIV’s stables, La Grande Ecurie, are newly restored and open to
the public. Also designed by Hardouin-Mansart, the stables held as many
as 600 horses owned by the king. These days, you’ll see 20 ivory-colored
Lusitano horses from Portugal. A morning tour here includes a dressage
demonstration with riders in costume on horses performing to music.
Near the stables is the entrance to the Le Musée des Carrosses, which
houses horse-drawn coaches from the 18th and 19th centuries, among
them one used at the coronation of Charles X and another used at the
wedding of Napoléon I and his second wife, Marie-Louise. One sleigh
rests on tortoiseshell runners. A ticket to the Petit Trianon also admits
you to this museum, and to the Salle du Jeu de Paume. Constructed by
Louis XIV, this museum space was originally an indoor court intended
for le jeu de paume, a sport that was the precursor to tennis. It has his-
torical significance, as it is the place where, on June 20, 1789, the French
revolution began: Representatives of the Third Estate, unsatisfied with
the reforms of Louis XVI, met at the Jeu de Paume and swore they would
not leave the chamber until they were given a Constitution.
Admission to La Grande Ecurie is 6 ($9.60) adults, 3 ($5) 17 and under.
It is open on specific Tuesdays and Thursdays at 11 a.m. Admission to the
coach museum is 2 ($2.40), free for children younger than 18. It’s open
every weekend from April to October 9 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. and the first two
weekends in November 12:30 to 5:30 p.m. The Musée des Carrosses and
the Salle du Jeu de Paume are open only on certain weekends and holi-
days; you must call ahead to the Versailles info line to see if they are avail-
able for viewing.
Admission to the palace is 14 ($8.60) for adults. It’s free for those
younger than 18 and for all on Sunday. Combined admission to the
Grand and Petit Trianons is 9 ($5.75) for adults; children younger 
than 18 are free. Audio guides are available in iPods for a 3 ($5) fee.
Admission to the gardens is free except for the days of Grands Eaux
Musicales (see earlier for prices).
Lecturer-led one-hour tours of the palace are admission price plus 6
($9.60), 4 ($6.40) ages 10 to 17 and seniors; one-and-a-half-hour tours
are admission plus 6 ($9.60), 4.50 ($7.20) ages 11 to 17 and seniors;
Part IV: Exploring Paris 
286

two-hour tours are admission plus 8 ($13) for adults, 6 ($9.60) ages
10 to 17. Tours are free for children younger than ten.
From May to September, the palace is open Tuesday through Sunday
from 9 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. The rest of the year, the palace is open Tuesday
through Sunday from 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. From May through September
the Grand Trianon and Petit Trianon are open daily noon to 6:30 p.m.;
from October to April, the Grand Trianon and Petit Trianon are open
daily noon to 5:30 p.m. The park and the gardens are open every day,
except in bad weather, from 7 a.m. in summer and 8 a.m. in winter until
sunset (between 5:30 and 9:30 p.m., depending on the season).
Dining options
The town of Versailles has no shortage of places where you can break for
lunch, but after you’re on palace grounds, you may find it infinitely more
convenient just to stay put — otherwise you have to hike back into town
and back out to the palace again. In the château, you can eat at Le Café, a
snack bar just off the Cour de la Chapelle. In the Formal Gardens is an
informal restaurant, La Flotille, on Petite Venise. (To get there from the
château, walk directly back through the gardens to where the canal starts.
Petite Venise and the restaurant are to your right.) There is La Petite
Venise, a wood-beamed restaurant, brasserie, and tearoom with outdoor
seating between the Grand Canal and the Apollo Fountain. Finally, several
snack bars and fresh-squeezed orange juice stands are located in the gar-
dens near the Quinconce du Midi and the Grand Trianon.
Note: For those with limited mobility, electric cars are available at the
south entrance (% 01-30-83-75-05).
The Palais de Fontainebleau
Fontainebleau is much less crowded than Versailles, and you can com-
bine culture and outdoor activities. It’s a terrific day trip from Paris.
After you tour the castle, hike the trails, rock climb, or rent bikes to ride
in the 16,800-hectare (42,000-acre) Forêt (forest) de Fontainebleau that
13 million guests visit each year. The palace (% 01-60-71-50-70; check
out the nearby “Fontainebleau” map) is probably most famous as the
site of Napoléon’s farewell to his imperial guard before he went into
exile. It also contains more than 700 years of royal history from the
enthronement of Louis VII in 1137 to the fall of the Second Empire in
1873. And artist Leonardo da Vinci played a small role in its history.
On the palace Web site is a link to purchase a Forfait Loisirs from the
SNCF, in which you pay a single fee for the round-trip train ticket to the
palace, an entry for a viewing of the Grandes Appartements, and a guide-
book which you can collect at the Tourist Office next to the château
(this may help avoid some lines). Per person the tickets are 23 ($37)
for adults, 17 ($27) for minors aged 10 to 17, and 8.10 ($13) for chil-
dren four to nine years (children under four enter for free).

Getting there
To reach Fontainebleau by train, take the SNCF Montargie line to
Fontainebleau Avon station; it departs hourly from the Gare de Lyon 
in Paris. The trip takes 35 to 60 minutes and costs 7.80 ($13).
Fontainebleau Avon station is just outside the town in Avon, a suburb 
of Paris. From the station, the town bus (direction Château) makes the
3km (2-mile) trip to the château every 10 to 15 minutes on weekdays 
and every 30 minutes on Saturdays and Sundays.
You can also reach Fontainebleau on a tour bus. Cityrama, 4 place des
Pyramides, 1er (% 01-44-55-61-00; www.cityrama.fr), combines both
Fontainebleau and the nearby artist’s village of Barbizon (see later in
this section) for 65 ($104) adult, 33 ($50) child. Paris Vision, 214 rue
de Rivoli, 1er (% 01-42-60-30-01; www.parisvision.com), offers a 154
($246) extended minibus tour which includes Barbizon, Fontainebleau,
and Vaux le Vicomte, another château with beautiful gardens. Children
go for half-price.

Exploring Fontainebleau
Fontainebleau was built for love. François I transformed a run-down
royal palace into Fontainebleau in 1528 for his mistress, and his succes-
sor, Henri II, left a beautiful memorial to the woman he loved — a ball-
room decorated with the intertwined initials of his mistress, Diane de
Poitiers, and himself.
The Mona Lisa once hung here, and it is said that its creator, Leonardo da
Vinci, personally brought the painting to its buyer, his friend François I.
The Mona Lisa remained in the royal family for years before it was gifted
to the Louvre. Stucco-framed paintings now hanging in the Gallery of
François I include The Rape of Europa and depict mythological and alle-
gorical scenes related to the king’s life. Make sure to see the racy ceiling
paintings above the Louis XV Staircase, which was originally painted for
the bedroom of a duchess. The stairway’s architect simply ripped out the
bedroom floor, using its ceiling to cover the stairway. One fresco depicts
the Queen of the Amazons climbing into Alexander the Great’s bed.
When Louis XIV ascended the throne, Fontainebleau was largely neglected
because of his preoccupation with Versailles, but it found renewed glory
under Napoléon I. You can walk around much of the palace on your own,
but most of the Napoleonic rooms are accessible only on guided tours,
which are in French. Napoléon had two bedchambers; mirrors adorn
either side of his bed in the grander chamber (look for his symbol, a bee),
while a small bed is housed in the aptly named Small Bedchamber. A red-
and-gold throne with the initial “N” is displayed in the Throne Room. You
can also see Napoléon’s offices, where the emperor signed his abdication;
however, the document on exhibit is only a copy. Minor apartments
include those once occupied by Madame De Maintenon, the second wife
of Louis XIV; those of Pope Pius VII, whom Napoléon kept a virtual pris-
oner; still another was Marie Antoinette’s.
After a visit to the palace, wander through the gardens, paying special
attention to the lovely, bucolic carp pond, and take caution while walking
by some of the fearless swans. If you’d like to promenade in the forest, a
detailed map of its paths is available from the Office de Tourisme, 4 rue
Royale, near the palace (% 01-60-74-99-99; www.tourisme-fontaine
bleau.com). You can also rent bikes nearby from À la Petite Reine, 32
rue des Sablons (% 01-60-74-57-57), for about 5 ($8) an hour, 13 ($21)
a half-day, 16 ($26) a full day, with a credit card deposit. The Tour
Denencourt, about 5km (3 miles) north of the palace, makes a nice ride
and has a pretty view. Other mapped-out walking and bike tours of the
city and environs can be downloaded from the Tourist Office Web site or
you can get a map once you’re there.
The Palais de Fontainebleau (% 01-60-71-50-70) is open Wednesday
through Monday, and is closed on New Year’s Day, Christmas Day, and
the first of May. The opening hours October through March are from 
9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.; from April to September the hours are 9 a.m. to 
6 p.m. Admission to the Grand Appartements is 13 ($20) for adults,
Chapter 14: Going Beyond Paris: Five Day Trips 289

11 ($18) for ages 18 to 26 and older than 60, free for those under age
18. Free for all on the first Sunday of the month.
Dining options
If you’re arriving by train and plan to visit only Fontainebleau, consider
bringing a picnic from Paris. In fine weather, the château’s gardens and
nearby forest beckon. If you have a car, however, save your appetite for
Barbizon (see later).
On the western edge of France’s finest forest lies the village of Barbizon,
home to a number of noted landscape artists — Corot, Millet, Rousseau,
and Daumier. The colorful town has a lively mix of good restaurants,
boutiques, and antiques shops — the perfect place to while away an
afternoon. For lunch, try the Relais de Barbizon, 2 av. Charles de Gaulle
(% 01-60-66-40-28). They have a prix-fixe menu at 27 ($43) which fea-
tures hearty home-style dishes such as confit de canard and baba au
rhum for dessert. The restaurant is open Thursday through Monday
noon to 2:30 p.m. and 8 to 10 p.m. (Only lunch is served on Tues.)
Reservations required on weekends.
If you stay in Fontainebleau for lunch, try Le Table des Maréchaux in
the Hôtel Napoléon, 9 rue Grande (% 01-60-39-50-50). Its 40 ($42)
three-course ménu may include a mackerel and mozzarella spring roll, or
a Parmesan-encrusted cod with eggplant purée. Finish up with a straw-
berry and grapefruit tart. In warm weather, diners can eat on the out-
door terrace.
The Cathedral at Chartres
The French sculptor Rodin dubbed this building “The Acropolis of
France.” Upon laying eyes on this greatest of High Gothic cathedrals,
Napoléon declared, “Chartres is no place for an atheist.” Perhaps the
would-be emperor had been moved by the ethereal world of colored
light that fills the cathedral (still the fourth-largest church in the world)
on a sunny day, streaming through an awe-inspiring more than 2,500 sq.
m (27,000 sq. ft.) of 12th- and 13th-century stained glass, turning the
church walls into quasi-mystical portals to heaven.
It survived the French Revolution, even though it was scheduled for
demolition. It withstood two world wars, when volunteers took down 
all of its 12th- and 13th-century stained glass piece by piece. But for 
a majority of its visitors, the Cathédrale de Notre-Dame de Chartres 
(% 02-37-21-59-08; see the nearby “Notre-Dame de Chartres” map), one
of the world’s greatest Gothic cathedrals and one of the finest creations
of the Middle Ages, comes second in importance to a small scrap of
material housed inside. Known as the Sancta Camisia, it is said that it
was worn by the Virgin Mary when she gave birth to Jesus. This sacred
scarf was supposedly a gift from the Empress Irene of Byzantium to

Charlemagne, and has been resting in the cathedral of Chartres since 
A.D. 876 (Note: This refers to a different or earlier construction than the
Chartres cathedral that we know today).
Getting there
You can see all this for around a 26 ($46) round-trip train ticket from
Paris’s Gare Montparnasse, less than an hour’s ride away. The tourism
office (% 02-37-18-26-26) is right on the place de la Cathédral.

If you’d like to drive to Chartres, take the A10/A11 highway from Porte
d’Orléans and follow the signs to Le Mans and Chartres. The drive takes
about 75 minutes.
Traveling to Chartres by tour bus is another option. Cityrama, 4 place
des Pyramides, 1er (% 01-44-55-61-00; www.cityrama.fr), offers five-
hour excursions leaving from Paris every Tuesday, Thursday, and
Saturday for 59 ($94) adult, 30 ($47) child.
Exploring the cathedral
Take one of Malcolm Miller’s excellent 75-minute guided tours of Chartres
Cathedral. Miller, an Englishman who has made the study of the cathedral
his life’s work, has published such books as Chartres Cathedral (Riverside
Books Co.) and Chartres Stained Glass (Jarrold Publishing) and has been
giving fascinating tours of the cathedral for 45 years. No need to reserve;
meet inside the cathedral at the gift shop. Miller also gives private tours
for groups up to 15 at 10 to 15 per person ($16–$24). Call % 02-37-28-
15-58 or e-mail millerchartres@aol.com for more information. Tours
are Monday through Saturday at 11 a.m. and 2:45 p.m. from Easter to
November (although he is sometimes available in winter, too).
If you can’t get in touch with Malcolm Miller, call the cathedral Welcome
Center at % 02-37-21-75-02. Guided Crypt visits are available, but in
French only. They meet outside of the cathedral at the La Crypte store
from April 1 to October 31 at 11 a.m., and June 22 to September21 at
3:30, 4:30, and 5:15 p.m. (excluding Sun and holidays). From November
to March the tours leaves from the cafe gift shop in the North tower, at
11 a.m. and 4:15 p.m. Climb the tower for gargoyle close-ups Monday
through Saturday from 7:30 a.m. to noon and from 2 to 7 p.m., and also
on Sunday from 8:30 a.m. to noon and from 2 to 7 p.m.; admission is
6.20 ($9.90) adults and 4.20 ($6.70) ages 18 to 25; free for children
under 18. Note that the stone stairs are steep and winding and the climb
isn’t for everyone.
Sunday afternoons are a terrific time to visit, when free organ concerts
(4:45–5:45 p.m.) and the filtered light coming in from the western win-
dows make the church come wonderfully alive.
The cathedral that you see today dates principally from the 13th cen-
tury, when it was built with the combined efforts and contributions of
kings, princes, church officials, and pilgrims from across Europe. This
Notre-Dame was among the first to use flying buttresses.
On your tour, begin at the very beginning — with the entryway. People
say that Rodin sat for hours on the edge of the sidewalk, contemplating
the portal, spellbound by its sculptured bodies draped in long, flowing
robes with amazingly lifelike faces. Before entering, walk around to both
the north and south portals, which date from the 13th century. The bays
depict such biblical scenes as the expulsion of Adam and Eve from the
Garden of Eden, and episodes from the life of the Virgin.
Part IV: Exploring Paris 
292

Next, just inside, are the Clocher Vieux (Old Tower) with its 105m 
(350-ft.) steeple dating from the 12th century, and the Clocher Neuf
(New Tower). Originally built in 1134, the new tower’s elaborate orna-
mental tower was added between 1507 and 1513 following one of the
many fires that swept through the cathedral.
You can climb to the top of the Clocher Neuf, but make sure your shoes
aren’t slippery — parts of the tower are without a railing and are quite
steep and narrow.
The cathedral is also known for its celebrated choir screen. Don’t let the
simple term fool you; this is a carved wood structure that took nearly
200 years to complete. The niches, 40 in all, contain statues illustrating
scenes from the life of Mary. The screen is in the middle of the cathedral
toward the altar.
Few of the rushed visitors ever notice the screen; they’re transfixed by
the stained-glass windows. Bring a pair of binoculars to better focus on
the panes, which cover more than 2,508 sq. m (26,996 sq. ft.). The glass
is unequaled anywhere in the world and is truly mystical. It was spared
in both world wars, because in both wars, the glass was removed piece
by piece. Currently, the Association Chartres Sanctuaire du Monde has
undertaken the considerable task of raising the millions of euro neces-
sary for the restoration of the windows, which have suffered on both
sides from smoke from the cathedral’s candles and from pollution.
Most of the stained glass dates from the 12th and 13th centuries. Many
visitors find it difficult to single out one panel or window of particular
merit; however, the oldest is the 12th-century Notre Dame de la belle
verrière (Our Lady of the beautiful window, sometimes called the Blue
Virgin) on the south side. The colors from the glass are such a vibrant,
startling blue that many find it hard to believe that the window is 1,000
years old. In the nave (the widest in France), have a look down at the
13th-century labyrinth. It was designed for pilgrims to navigate on their
hands and knees as a form of penance, all 300m (1,000 ft.) of it. These
days, much of it is covered with folding chairs for Mass. The wooden
Virgin of the Pillar, to the left of the choir, dates from the 14th century.
The crypt was built over a period of 200 years, beginning in the 9th cen-
tury. Enshrined is Our Lady of the Crypt, a Madonna made in 1976 that
replaced one destroyed during the Revolution. The Sancta Camisia, the
holy relic that some people believe Mary wore during the birth of Jesus,
is behind the choir screen in a chapel to the left of the church’s treasury.
The cathedral is open daily April through September from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.,
October through March from 7:30 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. Ask at the Chartres
tourist office (% 02-37-18-26-26) outside the cathedral for information
about tours in English and a schedule of masses open to the public.
Chapter 14: Going Beyond Paris: Five Day Trips 293

Dining options
Restaurants, cafes, and snack bars abound around town, but just a
stone’s throw from the cathedral is Le Café Serpente, 2 Clôitre Notre-
Dame (% 02-37-21-68-81). Facing the south side of the cathedral with
outside tables, this restaurant serves traditional French fare at reason-
able prices between 13 and 20 ($21–$32) for two courses that may
start with a dish of leeks and asparagus with foie gras and include a main
course of filet de rouget (red fish filet). House specialties are pigs’ feet and
veal kidneys. If you’re just there for a snack or light meal, the salade com-
posée (large meal-salads) and tasty omelets are available. The restaurant
is open daily for lunch, and Monday through Saturday for dinner.
On the other side of the cathedral you can find Le Cloître Gourmand,
21 Cloître Notre-Dame (% 02-37-21-27-02), a charming and inexpensive
restaurant that feels like you’re eating in someone’s kitchen. Here you
can get simple entrees for 6 ($9.60) such as a pea-mint soup or a
spinach pastry, and for a main course they have a great pan-fried salmon
with perfumed rice. The restaurant faces a shady side of the cathedral,
allowing a view of medieval sculpture as you sip your café. The restau-
rant is open Monday through Saturday at noon through 2 p.m., opening
again around 7 p.m. for dinner.
For more upscale dining, take the time to wander through town where
you’ll discover Le Moulin de Ponceau, 21-23 rue de la Tannerie (% 02-
37-35-30-05). This chic restaurant can be on the expensive side, but 
it’s worth it from the fresh market–menu to the gorgeous scenery.
Beautifully situated on the banks of the Eure river, this restaurant’s ter-
race overlooks a stunning panorama of ancient houses, stone bridges,
and weeping willows leaning into to the gently flowing water of the Eure,
which is more of a stream than a river at this juncture. A la carte you can
order a duo of lobster and monkfish or veal sweetbreads in puff pastry
with asparagus and wild mushrooms. Menus are at 39 and 53 ($62
and $85) for three courses. Relax, listen to the water flowing, and throw
your bread crumbs to the ducks that paddle along the current. To find
rue de la Tannerie, head through old town, on rue au Lait, for example,
in the direction of the Eure. The streets are very twisted and there is no
perfect route. Once you end up at the bank, cross the nearest bridge —
rue de la Tannerie follows along its East bank. The restaurant is open
Tuesday to Saturday noon to 2 p.m. and 7:30 to 9:30 p.m., and Sunday
noon to 2 p.m. If you have extra time, spend it by exploring the medieval
cobbled streets of the Old Town. At the foot of the cathedral are lanes
with gabled and turreted houses and humped bridges spanning the Eure
River. The turreted Norman house (it’s the oldest-looking one there) on
rue Chantault, dates back nine centuries.
Stop in at the Musée de Beaux-Arts de Chartres, 29 Cloître Notre-Dame
(% 02-37-90-45-80), to see paintings by old masters such as Watteau,
Brosamer, and Zurbarán, and admire the museum’s architecture, some of
which dates back to the 15th century. The museum is open Wednesday
through Monday, 10 a.m. to noon and 2 to 5 p.m., Sundays 2 to 5 p.m. The
Part IV: Exploring Paris 
294

museum is open until 6 p.m. May to November 30. It is closed on
November 1 and 11 and Christmas Day. Admission is 2.90 ($4.35) adults
and 1.50 ($2.40) for children under 12 and senior citizens (students get
in free).
Disneyland Paris
Disneyland Paris, known locally as Le Parc Disneyland (% 407-934-7639
in the United States, 01-60-30-60-53 in Paris; www.disneylandparis.
com), is France’s number-one attraction, with more than 50 million visi-
tors a year and celebrated its 15th anniversary in 2007. When it opened
in 1992 the French were dead set against it; now 40 percent of its visitors
are French, and half of those are Parisian. Set on a 2,000-hectare (5,000-
acre) site (about one-fifth the size of Paris) in the suburb of Marne-la-
Vallée, the park incorporates the elements of its Disney predecessors
but gives them a European flair. Allow at least a full day to see
Disneyland Paris.
Information about hotels and packages is constantly changing, so your
best bet for staying up to date is to obtain the Disneyland Resort Paris
brochure from the Web site a few months in advance.
Getting there
To get there, take the A line RER from such central Paris RER/métro stops
as Châtelet-les-Halles or Nation or Gare de Lyon to Marne-la-Vallée/Chessy,
within walking distance of the park. The RER station is in Zone 5 of the
public-transport system, so the cheapest way there (and back again) is 
to buy a single-day Mobilis pass good through Zone 5, which costs 13
($20). Admission to the park from April to November is 57 ($91) adults
and 49 ($78) children 3 to 11; children under three are admitted free.
Avoid lines at the resort by buying Disneyland passes at all RER A sta-
tions, except Marne-la-Vallée, and métro stations including Charles-de-
Gaulle-Etoile, Franklin-D-Roosevelt, Gare de Lyon, Porte Maillot, Esplanade
de la Défense, Anvers, Père-Lachaise, Place de Clichy, Gallieni, Havre-
Caumartin, Villiers, Alésia, Barbès-Rochechouart, Châtelet, Denfert-
Rochereau, and Gare de l’Est. The pass is good for either Disneyland Park
or Walt Disney Studios but not both.
Within the park, a free shuttle bus connects the various hotels with the
theme park, stopping every 6 to 15 minutes, depending on the time of
year. Service begins an hour before the park opens and stops an hour
after closing.
If you prefer to drive to Disneyland Paris, take the A4 highway east and
exit at Park Euro Disney. Guest parking at any of the thousands of spaces
costs 8 ($13). A series of moving sidewalks speeds up pedestrian tran-
sit from the parking areas to the theme park entrance.
Chapter 14: Going Beyond Paris: Five Day Trips 295

Exploring the park
The Disneyland Paris resort consists of two theme parks. The first,
Disneyland Park, clusters together five “lands” of entertainment 
(Main Street, U.S.A.; Frontierland; Adventureland; Fantasyland; and
Discoveryland) and is where most of the massive and well-designed
hotels, a nightlife center (Le Festival Disney), swimming pools, tennis
courts, dozens of restaurants, shows, an aquarium, and the Manchester
United Soccer School are located. If your kids are younger than seven,
they’d be best suited for Main Street, U.S.A., Fantasyland, Sleeping
Beauty’s Castle, and the afternoon parade. Children ages 7 through 12
will most likely enjoy Frontierland, the Phantom Manor ghost house, the
Big Thunder Mountain roller coaster, Adventureland, Indiana Jones and
the Temple of Doom roller coaster, and the Pirates of the Caribbean ride.
Discoveryland, the Space Mountain roller coaster, and the Star Tours
simulated spacecraft ride should please your teens.
Walt Disney Studios Park is the newer of the two parks and is set up as
a movie studio come to life, where children participate in the movie-
making process. The entrance is called the Front Lot and resembles the
Hollywood Disney studios — water tower, gates, and all. En Coulisse
restaurant is located here, serving the kind of food kids like and
Americans are known for — hamburgers, pizza, salads, and ice cream. In
a film studio resembling a street, kids can become a part of the filming of
impromptu comedy sketches as they walk around the park; later in the
day, they get to see themselves on screen. In the Animation Courtyard,
cartoon characters come to life via black light and mirrors, and children
can play at being animators at interactive displays. The French Disney
Channel has its studios here, in the Production Courtyard; kids get to
see how a TV studio really works and may be asked to serve as extras.
An international buffet, Rendez-Vous des Stars, is located here. The Back
Lot features the Backlot Express Restaurant, serving sandwiches and
other quick fare, and the Rock-n-Roller Coaster, a very fast and very 
loud ride (120 speakers playing Aerosmith) that whips you through an
Aerosmith rock video. Calm down afterward by watching the stunt show
spectacular, which is highlighted by a high-speed car chase. Food kiosks
sell popcorn, ice cream, hot dogs, and so on throughout the park.
A guide for visitors in wheelchairs gives important information about
access to rides and other attractions all around the park. You can pick
up a copy at City Hall in the Disneyland Park or call to have a copy sent
to you (% 01-60-30-60-30).
Admission to the park from April to November is 57 ($91) adults and
49 ($78) children 3 to 11; children under three are admitted free. The
hours of Disneyland Paris vary with the weather and season, so call
before setting out. In general, however, the park is open from 9 a.m. to 
8 p.m. daily. It sometimes opens an hour later in mid-May, mid-June, and
September and October. From September to December, the scheduling
hours become erratic during certain weekends due to various school
holidays, and they also vary with the weather. Definitely call or check
Part IV: Exploring Paris 
296

online before you go at the Web site and phone number listed in the first
paragraph of this section.
Avoid waiting in long lines with the free FASTPASS. After presenting the
pass at the ride you want, you’re given a time frame for when to come
back and board the ride first upon your return. Ask for it at the ticket
booth or City Hall.
Staying at Disneyland
If you want to stay at Disneyland overnight or for a few days, you need
to book well in advance. Plenty of hotels are available at different price
levels, and you can explore the options and book accommodations on
the park’s Web site at www.disneylandparis.com.
Monet’s Gardens at Giverny
Monet moved to Giverny (% 02-32-51-28-21; www.fondation-monet.
com for Fondation Claude Monet, which runs the museum) in 1883, and
the water lilies beneath the Japanese bridge in the garden and the flower
garden became his regular subjects until his death in 1926. In 1966, the
Monet family donated Giverny to the Académie des Beaux-Arts in Paris,
perhaps the most prestigious fine-arts school in France, which subse-
quently opened the site to the public. Giverny has since become one of
the most popular attractions in France, inspiring millions with its land-
scape and Provençal-themed house, but even the crowds can’t com-
pletely overwhelm the magic.
Getting there
Catch an SNCF train at the Gare St-Lazare in Paris approximately every
hour for the 45-minute trip to Vernon, the town nearest the Monet gar-
dens. The round-trip fare is about 24 ($38). From the station, the 241
bus makes the 5km (3-mile) trip to the museum for 2 ($3.20); a taxi ride
will cost 7 to 10 ($11–$16); you can rent a bike in Vernon, or even go
on foot — the route along the Seine makes for a nice walk.
If you’re driving to Giverny, take the A13 highway from the Porte d’Auteuil
to Bonnières, then D201 to Giverny. The whole trip takes about an hour.
Traveling to Giverny by tour bus is another option. Cityrama, 4 place
des Pyramides, 1er (% 01-44-55-61-00; www.cityrama.com), has two
trips to Giverny: a five-hour trip on Tuesday, Thursday, or Saturday for
67 ($107) adults, 34 ($54) children 4 to 11 (children under age four
ride free); and an all-day Giverny-Auvers-sur-Oise trip on Sunday or
Wednesday for 113 ($181) for adults, 80 ($128) for children, which
includes lunch at the American Museum. Call for specific dates. Paris
Vision, 214 rue de Rivoli, 1er (% 01-42-60-30-01; www.parisvision.
com), offers several trips: a Versailles-Giverny all-day trip on Tuesday
through Sunday that includes lunch at the Moulin de Fourges and a visit
Chapter 14: Going Beyond Paris: Five Day Trips 297

to the American Art Museum for 159 ($254) for adults, 111 ($178) for
children; and a trip to the house, gardens, and American Art museum on
Tuesdays through Sunday for 85 ($136) for adults and 43 ($69) for
children.
Exploring the gardens
Even before you arrive at Giverny, you probably have some idea of what
you’re going to see — but nothing prepares you for the spectacular
beauty of seeing the gardens up close. The gardens are usually at their
best in May, June, and July. Should you yearn to have them almost to
yourself, plan to be at the gates when the gardens open, or go on a rainy
day (June is probably the busiest month, although they will all be busy).
You’ll probably spend at least a half-day at Giverny, longer if you plan to
eat lunch and visit the American Museum.
The gardens are open from April to November Tuesday through Sunday
from 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., as well as Easter Monday and Whit Monday (51
days after Easter). Admission to the house and gardens is 5.50 ($8.80)
for adults, 4 ($6.40) for students, and 3 ($5.75) for ages 7 to 12 (chil-
dren under age seven get in free); reservations are required.
Some say Monet’s influence was responsible for the influx of American
artists into the village of Giverny in the late 1880s. Others say that Monet
had little contact with the Americans, and it was Giverny’s beauty that
captured the hearts of painters such as John Singer Sargent and William
Metcalf, who began spending their summers there. In any case, at one
point, more than 50 American artists lived in Giverny with their families.
You can see much of their work at the Musée d’Art Américain Giverny
(% 02-32-51-94-65), just 91m (299 ft.) from Monet’s house and gardens.

Monday (51 days after Easter). Admission is 5.50 ($8.80) for adults, 
4 ($6.40) for students and seniors, 3 ($4.80) for ages 12 to 18, and 
free for children younger than 12. Admission is free for all on the first
Sunday of every month.
Dining options
Your entry ticket is no longer valid once you leave Monet’s home, so
think ahead about whether you want to eat lunch before or after your
visit. It may be smart to arrive in early afternoon to have a better chance
of avoiding the crowds in the morning.
There are many little cafes and crêperies in the square directly across
from Monet’s house and on the adjacent street. But a short walk from
the gardens is Les Jardins de Giverny, 1 rue du Milieu (% 02-32-21-
60-80). This beautiful and tranquil restaurant opens its doors onto a
rose garden in warm weather and serves delicious regional specialties. 
A trou Normand (cider and Calvados sorbet) aids digestion between
courses that may include smoked breast of goose marinated in port
wine or guinea fowl filleted with apples and potatoes. Main courses cost
between 17 and 32 ($27–$51). The 33 ($53) and 45 ($72) menus 
are better deals. Another good restaurant in town is Le Relais Normand
(% 02-32-21-16-12) in the Hôtel d’Evreux, an old Norman manor house
with a fireplace and terrace. It serves such delicious dishes as roasted
Normandy oysters with a nut and mushroom filling, beef filet with
Livarot cream cheese, and duck filet with caramelized red fruit. The
three prix-fixe menus cost 23 and 29 ($37 and $46). The restaurant is
open for lunch Tuesday through Sunday from noon to 3 p.m.

P
aris may not be a city that never sleeps, but it’s just as
fabulous after the sun sets as it is during the day. There
is so much to do! Take your pick of French-language, English-

and even cabaret spectacles like Moulin Rouge. But beware!
Events can sell out quickly. Chapter 15 gives you the lowdown

 Taking in plays, symphony, opera, and dance in Paris
W
hatever your choice of the classic arts, you can be guaranteed to
find it in excellent form in Paris. This is the city that gave the world
playwrights Molière, Victor Hugo, Pierre Corneille, and Jean Racine; and
produced actors Sarah Bernhardt and Antonin Artaud. Fortunately for vis-
itors, you don’t need to understand French to take in an evening of culture
here. Paris has a world-class orchestra, opera, ballet companies — and
brilliant venues that house them. There’s a flourishing English-language
theater scene, and cutting-edge theater productions with scope and visu-
als that make language secondary!
This chapter helps you find out what’s going on and then gets you there.
Getting the Inside Scoop
Paris is one of the places in the world to see top-tier ballet and listen to
world-renowned symphonies. Unlike New York City, where theaters are
located in the area around Broadway and 42nd streets, and serious
music and ballet happen at Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center, in Paris
cultural offerings are scattered around the city, from the Opéra Bastille
in the 12th to Théâtre National de la Colline in the 20th.The 2008–2009
season will be the last for the Opéra Bastille’s director, Gérard Mortier,
who is leaving to take over the New York City Opera. Mortier, who made
his mark on Europe by shaking up the Salzberg Festival, is known for
being cutting edge. A 2008–09 highlight here is: Verdi’s Macbeth. The
Palais Garnier presents in 2009 the French national ballet company’s
premiere dancers in John Cranko’s Onéguine, after the book Eugene
Onegin by Pushkin, with music by Tchaikovsky. In other spectacles, the
Opéra Nationale will perform Puccini’s Tosca, conducted by the boyish
Stefan Solyom.

Paris is home to an early music scene (music of the Middle Ages,
Renaissance, baroque, rococo, and the early classical eras) led by the
early music group Les Arts Florissants (www.arts-florissants.com),
which was founded in 1979 and has performed baroque operas in Paris’s
biggest venues. Check out the Web site of the Paris Convention and
Visitors’ Bureau (www.parisinfo.com) for venues and pricing.
The musical is a hot ticket here: West Side Story celebrated its 50th
anniversary in Paris to rave reviews and The Lion King and Cabaret also
enjoyed huge success, with over 200,000 theatergoers seeing Cabaret
alone. Songs from musicals are especially popular and mainstream in
France, sometimes selling albums before the show even opens. If you
see a show, don’t be surprised to hear some of its music on the radio.
On any given day, close to 100 theatrical productions may be going on in
Paris and the surrounding area. Because Paris is just a three-and-a-half-
hour Eurostar ride from London, some of that city’s finest actors have
found their way across the Channel and into the city’s English-language
theater community, where they joined up with American, Australian, 
and even some bilingual French confrères (colleagues). Productions in
English may not be plentiful, but quality is high, and a wide range of
styles is offered.
Arrive early to performances. On the reverse side of some Paris theater
tickets may be written: Les spectateurs retardaires ne peuvent à être
placés que lors d’une interruption du spectacle et en fonction de l’accessi-
bilité. In other words, late arrivals cannot be seated until there is an
interruption (intermission) in the play, if they are seated at all. Others
may say: Pour bien garantir votre place, nous vous remercions en avance
d’arriver un quart d’heure avant l’ouvrerture de la spectacle. This means if
you show up to the theater exactly at curtain-opening (instead of 15 min.
in advance), your seat may have been already given away depending on
the popularity of the show. Opera tickets say: Les spectateurs retardaires
ne peuvent à être placés qu’à la fin du premier tableau, du premier acte de
l’ouvrage ou à l’entracte, meaning that late arrivals cannot be seated until
the end of the first scene, the first act, or between acts. Some theaters
will not even seat those who arrive after the curtain rises, in many cases
because the plays being performed are short with no intermission. You
want to arrive at the theater or opera early anyway; the bars in these
locations are generally very good and are relaxing places to unwind
before the shows.
A placeuse (an usher, usually female) wearing a small purse around her
neck will show you to your seats. Yes, that purse is for tips, which are
expected; generally tip 1 or 2 ($1.60–$3.20) per person.
Paris audiences tend to dress up for performances, in nice jewelry and
dressy pants or skirts for the women, jackets for the men. Generally, the
nicer the venue, the dressier the look. Thus, for men a tie and jacket are
recommended at the Palais Garnier, whereas an open collar under a styl-
ish jacket would be the look for a performance at Bouffes du Nord.

Finding Out What’s Playing 
and Getting Tickets
Several local publications provide up-to-the-minute listings of perform-
ances and other evening entertainment. Pariscope: Une Semaine de Paris
(.40/65¢) is a weekly guide with thorough listings of movies, plays,
ballet, art exhibits, clubs, and more. It can be found at any newsstand.
L’Officiel des Spectacles (.45/70¢) is another weekly guide in French.
You can pick up the free music monthly, Cadences, outside concert
venues. The Paris Free Voice is a free monthly publication that spotlights
events of interest to English speakers, including poetry readings, plays,
and literary evenings at English-language bookstores and libraries. You
can find it at cybercafes and English-language bookstores or at www.
parisvoice.com.
You can also get information on the Web from the French Government
Tourist Office (www.francetourism.com), the Paris Convention and
Visitors’ Bureau (www.parisinfo.com), and the Maison de la France

kiosque.com) for excellent magazine-style sites about opera and dance
in Europe, including schedules, reviews, and phone numbers for order-
ing tickets.
Chapter 15: Applauding the Cultural Scene 305
Dinner and a show
Because performances tend to start around 8 p.m. and French restaurants tend to
open at 7 p.m., with dining lasting anywhere from one and a half to three hours and
more, what’s a hungry show-goer to do? Have a snack before the show, and feast
afterward at one of the many cafes or brasseries open late. The following are listed
in Chapter 10, and plenty more can be found around the city.
 Au Pied de Cochon, in the 1er, is open 24 hours.
 Bofinger, in the 4e, is open until 1 a.m.
 The Latin Quarter’s infamous Brasserie Balzar, 5e, stays open until midnight.
 Brasserie Ile St-Louis, on the tip of Ile St-Louis right across from Notre-Dame, is
open until midnight.
 Café Marly, 1er, in the Louvre’s courtyard, is open until 1 a.m.
 You can order food at showy Fouquet’s, 8e, on the Champs-Elysées, until 2 a.m.
 La Coupole on boulevard du Montparnasse, 14e, is open until 1:30 a.m. on 
weekends.

Ticket prices in this chapter are approximate; costs vary, depending on
who is performing what on which day of the week. Call the theaters for
information, or consult Pariscope and other entertainment listings. Many
concert, theater, and dance tickets are sold through Fnac department
stores and at the box office. You can find a dozen or so Fnac outlets
throughout Paris; the most prominent is 74 av. des Champs-Elysées
(Métro: George V). You can also reserve online at Fnac (www.fnac
spectacles.com, in French only). Easier is TicketNet (www.ticket
net.fr), in French and English (look for the tiny EN to the right of the
Contact tab at the top of the welcome page), which allows you to buy
tickets to cultural events online.
Raising the Curtain on 
the Performing Arts
The theaters listed here are national theaters supported by the govern-
ment, but many private ones also exist. For full listings, consult Pariscope:
Une Semaine de Paris (.40/65¢), a weekly guide with thorough listings of

Attending the theater
A good mix of modern and classic tragedies and comedies comes alive 
in breathtaking performances in the Salle Richelieu of the Comédie-
Française, 2 rue de Richelieu, 1er (% 01-44-58-15-15; www.comedie-
francaise.fr; Métro: Palais-Royal-Musée du Louvre). Performances are

Saving money on tickets
For half-price theater tickets for national theaters and other venues, go to the Kiosque-
Théâtre at the northwest corner of the Madeleine Church (directly across from no. 15
place de la Madeleine; Métro: Madeleine) to buy tickets for same-day performances.
The panels all around the kiosk indicate sold-out shows with a little red man; a little
green man tells you that tickets are still available. The Kiosque-Théâtre is open
Tuesday through Saturday from 12:30 to 8 p.m., Sunday from 12:30 to 4 p.m. A second
branch of the discount-ticket counter is located on the esplanade between the Tour
Montparnasse and the Gare Montparnasse, and a third at Ternes in Montmartre in the
center of the square near the métro. Try to arrive no later than noon, because lines
are usually long.

go on sale at the box office at each of the theaters 90 minutes before the
show or you can purchase online.
Seeking English-language theater
Summer is a good time to catch English-language theater in Paris. The
Théâtre de Nesle, 8 rue de Nesle, 6e (% 01-44-07-35-49; Métro: St-Michel),
and Les Déchargeurs, 3 rue des Déchargeurs, 1er (% 01-42-36-00-02;
www.lesdechargeurs.fr; reservations at % 08-92-70-12-28 [.45/70¢ per
minute]; Métro: Châtelet), sometimes stages English-language plays. Or,
for comedy in English, try Laughing & Music Matters, in the salsa club La
Java, 105 rue Faubourg du Temple, 10e (% 01-53-19-98-88; www.anything
matters.com; Métro: Goncourt-Hôpital Saint-Louis). This company is
thriving; the lineups are always terrific, featuring award-winning comics
from the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Australia. Shows
usually start at 8:30 p.m.; admission varies, but count on paying 20 to
25 ($32–$40) at the door.
Other English-language theaters include the International Players
(www.internationalplayers.info), a nonprofessional but still high-
quality Anglophone theater company that performs musicals and plays
in its space just outside of the city limits in St-Germain en Laye (RER: 
St-Germain en Laye). Past productions include The Boyfriend (2008),
Oklahoma (2007), and Sleeping Beauty (2006). Actors in the international
drama company Drama Ties (% 01-75-50-16-91), started in 1901, put 
on their own original plays in English and use various theaters in and
around Paris; last season included runs of Snow White’s Black Heart
and Rapunzel. The Théâtre en Anglais (% 01-55-02-37-87; http://
theatre.anglais.free.fr), outside the city in Asnières-sur-Seine, per-
forms classic plays in English with an excellent troupe. The 2008–09
season includes Oliver Twist, Pinter’s The Dumb Waiter, and Romeo and
Juliet.
Then again, some theater isn’t meant to be understood. In fact, some-
times not understanding the language can actually be a bonus. Several
well-known avant-garde theater companies are located in Paris, includ-
ing Les Bouffes du Nord, at 37Bis bd. Chapelle, 10e (% 01-46-07-34-50;
www.bouffesdunord.com), run by the legendary Peter Brook with
Micheline Rozan, and Le Théâtre du Soleil, in the bois de Vincennes 
(% 01-43-74-24-08; www.theatre-du-soleil.fr), known for its stun-
ning adaptations of both classics and original works. Up for 2009 is Les
Projets des Théâtre Aftaab, a collaboration with a theater company from
Kaboul. Even though these performances are usually in French, the
scope of these productions is so large, and the visuals so profound, you
may not even notice that you haven’t understood a single word.

Listening to classical music and the symphony
Classical music concerts occur throughout the year, and many of them
are quite affordable. Look for flyers at churches announcing schedule
times, prices, and locations.
More than a dozen Parisian churches regularly schedule relatively inex-
pensive organ recitals and concerts. The most glorious, where the music
is nearly outdone by the gorgeous stained-glass windows, is Sainte-
Chapelle, 4 bd. du Palais, 1e (% 01-44-07-12-38; Métro: Cité). Concerts
take place every day between March and November at 7 and 8:30 p.m.
You can also hear music at St-Eustache, 1 rue Montmartre, 1er (% 01-
42-36-31-05; Métro: Les Halles); St-Sulpice, place St-Sulpice (% 01-42-
34-59-60; Métro: St-Sulpice), which has wonderfully resonant eight-
columned pipe organ concerts on most Sundays at 4 p.m.; St-Germain-
des-Prés, place St-Germain-des-Prés (% 01-55-42-81-33; Métro:
St-Germain-des-Prés); the Madeleine, place de la Madeleine (% 01-44-
51-69-00; Métro: Madeleine); and St-Louis en l’Ile, 19 rue St-Louis-en-l’Ile
(% 01-46-34-11-60; Métro: Pont-Marie). It may be a less magnificent set-
ting, but the friendliness of the people attending Sunday concerts at the
American Church, 65 quai d’Orsay (% 01-40-62-05-00; www.acp.org;
Métro: Invalides or Alma-Marceau), makes up for the décor. Their Ateler
Concert series takes place at 5 p.m. Sundays. Check the Web site for
other musical events.
Free concerts are staged occasionally in the parks and gardens. (See
Chapter 3 for a calendar.) Maison de la Radio, 116 av. du President
Kennedy, 16e (% 01-56-40-12-12; Métro: Kennedy-Radio France), offers
free tickets to recordings of some concerts. Tickets are available on the
spot an hour before the recording starts. The Conservatoire National
Superieur de Musique at the Cité de la Musique, 209 av. Jean Jaurés, 19e
(% 01-40-40-45-45; Métro: Porte de Pantin), stages free concerts and
ballets performed by students at the conservatory, while the Concert
Hall here (% 01-44-84-44-84) plays host to all types of performances,
from jazz to world music.
The Salle Pleyel, 252 rue du Faubourg-St-Honoré, 8e (% 01-42-56-13-13),
is home to the Orchestre de Paris, and gives 50 concerts a year. The
Radio France Philharmonic also plays about 20 concerts a year here, and
the lucky traveler may catch a performance of the London Symphony
Orchestra, which often visits several times a season. This magnificent
concert hall has been acoustically fine-tuned and refurnished with more
comfortable seating and delivers some grand musical experiences.
Reservations are best made by phone Monday to Saturday 12 a.m. to 
7 p.m. Senior citizens and youths under 27, take note: An hour before 
the show any available, last-minute tickets are offered at just 10 ($16).
There’s a 15 percent discount on tickets for those with disabilities.

Enjoying opera and ballet
Whatever your choice of the classic arts — opera, ballet, concerts,
recitals — you’ll find it performed in Paris by local and international per-
formers of the highest caliber in some of the most wonderful venues
imaginable. Inaugurated in 1874, the Châtelet, Théâtre Musical de Paris,
1 place du Châtelet, 1er (% 01-40-28-28-40; www.chatelet-theatre.
com; Métro: Châtelet), is one of the top places to take in culture in Paris
(Edward Scissorhands, the ballet, made its debut here in fall 2008).
Upcoming highlights include a recital from the Martha Graham Dance
Company (Mar 2009), pianist Radu Lupu playing selections of Debussy
and Schubert (May 2009), and the Orchestre Nationale de France offer-
ing a special concert in honor of the first day of summer (Fête de la
Musique). Tickets range from 10 to 120 ($16–$230). The box office is
open daily from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. To make reservations by phone, call
between 10 a.m. and 7 p.m. daily. There is a 2.50 ($4) surcharge for
Internet and phone reservations.
You can see dazzling performances by the national opera and ballet
troupes at both the radiant Palais Garnier, place de l’Opéra, 9e (% 01-
72-29-35-35 from abroad or 08-92-89-90-90 for reservations [.35/55¢ per
minute]; www.opera-de-paris.fr; Métro: Opéra; RER: Auber), and the
ultramodern Opéra National de la Bastille (see the next paragraph).
The Palais Garnier conducts more ballet performances, and the Opéra
Bastille puts on more opera. Tickets are priced from 5 ($8) for seats
that have little or no visibility (you can buy these only at the box office
an hour before the performance) to 172 ($275) for the first row of the
balcony. Reserve by phone up to four weeks in advance and buy at the
ticket windows for performances up to 14 days in advance (including
same-day tickets). Making reservations online or by phone adds a 3
($4.80) surcharge. The box office, located in the building between the
rue Scribe and rue Auber, is open Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to
6 p.m., Saturday 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.
The Opéra National de la Bastille, place de la Bastille, 12e (% 08-92-
89-90-90 for reservations [.35/55¢ per minute]; www.opera-de-paris.
fr; Métro: Bastille), offers first-class comfort and magnificent acoustics
at each level of the auditorium, although Parisians tend to think the
building is a badly designed eyesore. The opera house is located at the
place de la Bastille; at night, kids crowd the steps, showing off their
skateboarding moves, talking on cellphones, and flirting. Tickets are
priced between 5 ($8) for reduced and no-visibility seats to 172
($275) for the front rows of orchestra and balcony seating. Reserve by
phone up to four weeks in advance and buy at the ticket windows for
performances up to 14 days in advance (including same-day tickets).
The cheapest seats are on sale only at the box office. Making reserva-
tions online or by phone incurs a 3 ($4.80) surcharge; call Monday to
Friday 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturday 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. to make a reserva-
tion by phone. The box office, located at 130 rue de Lyon (the side of the
opera house facing the Bastille monument), is open Monday through
Friday 10:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.

The other major venue for opera is the stunning Belle Epoque Opéra-
Comique, 5 rue Favart, 2e (% 08-25-01-01-23 for reservations; www.
opera-comique.com; Métro: Richelieu-Drouot), which offers wonderful
musical theater in the Salle Favart, a more intimate venue (the audito-
rium is so small you can hear people whispering onstage) than its opera
hall counterparts. It’s currently undergoing renovation which is not sup-
posed to affect performances. A highlight for the 2008–09 season is
Carmen (June 2009). Tickets are priced from 6 to 115 ($9.60–$184)
depending on the performance. The box office at place Boieldieu (front
of the theater, 2e) is open Monday through Saturday from 11 a.m. to 
7 p.m. and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.

Hot Spots for Cool Jazz
If there’s one thing you can count on in Paris, it’s that the stalwart
Caveau de la Hûchette, 5 rue de la Hûchette, 5e (% 01-43-26-65-05;
Métro or RER: St-Michel), will still be around. It’s a legendary club in a
cozy, cavelike space that has been welcoming jazz bands for more than
60 years. Locals and tourists of all ages converge here for jitterbugging
with a noisy, friendly crowd. Cover is 11 ($18) Monday through
Thursday; Friday through Sunday and the eve of a holiday it’s 13 ($21)
between 9:30 p.m. and 2:30 a.m. Music starts at 10:15 p.m.
New Orleans jazz is on the menu at Le Petit Journal Saint-Michel, 71 bd.

or $32) cover for entry with a drink included (the cheaper price is for
nonalcoholic drinks). Open Monday to Saturday at 7 p.m. with concerts
starting around 9:15 p.m. Check out their sister club, Le Petit Journal
Montparnasse, 13 rue du Commandant-Mouchotte, 14e (% 01-43-21-
56-70; Métro: Gaîté or Gare Montparnasse).
Near Les Halles pedestrian district, the rue des Lombards is a terrific
place to hear some of France’s most interesting jazz, and clubs on this
street have formed the “Paris Jazz Club.” For 30 ($48), one can pur-
chase a membership that offers such promotions as a monthly free
entry, reduced prices to clubs, and special theme nights. Go to www.
parisjazzclub.net and click on the English flag for more information

in English. Clubs on this street include Duc des Lombards, 42 rue des
Lombards, 1er (% 01-42-33-22-88; www.ducdeslombards.com; Métro:
Châtelet-Les Halles), which is often crowded with casually dressed
enthusiasts. A ticket to a show starts at 19 ($30; you can also reserve
online). Le Sunset and Le Sunside, both at no. 60 (% 01-40-26-46-60 and
% 01-40-26-21-25, respectively), are temples to eclectic (Le Sunset) and
more traditional (Le Sunside) jazz which can be heard in the venue’s
basement and street level bars. Concerts are priced around 25 ($40).
World music fans go to Le Baiser Salé at 56 (% 01-42-33-37-71; Métro:
Châtelet), an intimate venue that gets crowded with fans who love fusion
jazz, funk, Brazilian, Afro-Caribbean, funk, and meringue. The cover
starts around 18 ($29). The club is open daily from 7 p.m. to dawn with
concerts usually starting around 10 p.m.
It’s often standing room only at New Morning, 7-9 rue des Petites-Ecuries,
10e (% 01-45-23-51-41; www.newmorning.com; Métro: Château-d’Eau),
where the best jazz musicians from around the world perform to an audi-
ence that knows its jazz. It’s one of Paris’s best jazz clubs, and past per-
formers include Stan Getz, Miles Davis, and Wynton Marsalis. The venue
opens at 8 p.m. and concerts start at 9 p.m. Cover starts at 19 ($30),
depending on the act.
Classy Le Bilboquet, 13 rue St-Benoit, 6e (% 01-45-48-81-84; Métro: 
St-Germain-dès-Pres), starred alongside Louis Armstrong in the 1961 film
Paris Blues. Not much has changed since the film; the piano bar, where a
copper-plated ceiling makes for some interesting acoustics, has hosted
such legends as Charlie Parker and Duke. Concerts start at 8:30 p.m.
from Sunday to Thursday and at 9 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. There
is no cover, but drinks can be expensive at the bar (around 12/$19).
Jazz lovers who visit Paris during June and July weekends can laze
among the flowers of the Bois de Vincennes’s beautiful Parc Floral and
hear world-renowned acts during the Paris Jazz Festival. Métro: Château
de Vincennes. For more information: www.parisinfo.com/shows-

Listening to Live Music
Though it’s located in the Pigalle red light district that can be less than
savory at night, La Divan du Monde, 75 rue des Martyrs, 18e (% 01-42-
52-02-46; www.divandumonde.com; Métro: Pigalle), is a terrific venue.
Famous patrons (when it was a bar) included Toulouse-Lautrec and
Baudelaire and its décor reflects a bygone era. Plus, the music is eclec-
tic; you can hear anything from live rock to a band from the Balkans
playing regional music to DJs spinning New Wave. Concerts start any-
time from 7 to 10 p.m. Monday through Saturday and at 5 p.m. on
Sunday. Cover changes according to the act but can start at 6 ($26) for
a DJ to 35 ($56) for a concert.

La Flèche d’Or, 102 bis rue de Bagnolet, 20e (% 01-44-64-01-02; www.
flechedor.fr; Métro: Alexandre-Dumas), prides itself in developing live
acts and features four acts a night nearly every night as well as a DJ
spinning tunes. The site is the former Charonne train station, and you
can still see the tracks beneath a glass atrium. The club’s weeknight
openings vary, but count on its being in full-swing Thursday through
Saturday from 8 p.m. until at least 2 a.m. Cover ranges from free to 15
($24), depending on the act.
Concerts and live reggae, dance hall, rock, funk, and North African
Arabic as well as hip-hop and classic French, can be heard at off-the-
beaten-track Abracadabar, 123 av. Jean Jaurès, 19e (% 01-42-03-18-04;
www.abracadabar.fr; Métro: Laumière ou Ourcq). The venue is inti-
mate and the cover is cheap, starting around 5 ($8). Concerts start at 
9 p.m., and you can dance until 2 a.m. from Sunday to Wednesday, and
until 5 a.m. from Thursday to Saturday.
La Scène Bastille, 2 bis rue des Taillandiers, 11e (% 01-48-06-50-70;
www.la-scene.com; Métro: Ledru-Rollin), is a trendy and upscale joint
that has a cozy lounge with caramel-colored padded walls and room to
dance to whatever music is playing. Nights without live bands are club-
bing nights, led by a DJ. Concerts usually start at 10 p.m. and cost 11
or 12 ($18 or $19), nights with a DJ (check the Web site for calendar)
usually cost 12 or 14 ($19 or $22).
Shaking Your Groove Thing 
at the Best Dance Clubs
Paris clubs change their programming from night to night, with house
music de rigeur at many places. Check Pariscope magazine for concert
schedules. Salsa, the hottest trend a few years back, is still going strong
as are techno, house, world, classic rock, and indie rock.
A word of advice: Some of these clubs have strict door policies and turn
away those wearing sneakers, sweat suits, baseball caps, and shorts.
Many nightclubs accept reservations, so if you’re worried about getting
past the bouncers, give your club of choice a call (or ask the concierge
of your hotel to do it). To club on a budget, go out during the week when
cover charges may be (officially or unofficially) waived. Yes, it’s sexist,
but women often get in free, especially if they’re dressed in something
slinky, low-cut, or short (or all three). Black clothes seem to be the rule
for men and women, and the later you go — or earlier in the morning as
the case may be — the more fashionable people get.
Owned by the group who owns Barfly and Buddha Bar, Barrio Latino,
46-48 rue du Faubourg-Saint-Antoine, 11e (% 01-55-78-84-75; Métro:
Bastille), is a restaurant/bar/club in a gorgeous building designed by
Gustave Eiffel that delivers a terrific time — if you can get in. The lines
Part V: Living It Up After Dark: Paris Nightlife 
314

here on weekends are enormous which means it is packed inside. It has
three bars on four levels, private areas where you can see (but not be
seen), a lounge, winter garden, a second-floor restaurant serving Latino
food, and energetic salsa and bossa nova music that sets everyone to
dancing (and sweating!). Food ranges from tapas and hamburgers to
Central, South American, and Caribbean specialties, each dish listed
with its respective country. Open during the week from 11 a.m. to 2 a.m.;
weekend club nights run until 5 a.m.
It’s a rock club and a club for dancing, and le Triptyque, 142 rue
Montmartre, 2e (% 01-40-28-05-55; Métro: Grands bd. or Bourse), is 
one of the hippest spots in town. It hosts clubbing nights and live music
by music groups or hot and up-and-coming DJs in the American and
European music scene. Unlike some snooty nightclubs in Paris,
Triptyque is very much “do-your-own-thing” and no bouncers should
give any trouble. Entry changes based on who is performing, but many
nights are free, and paid nights are usually between 6 and 12
($9.60–$19). Open Monday to Wednesday 9:30 p.m. to 4 a.m., Thursday
to Saturday 9 p.m. to 6 a.m., Sunday 8 p.m. to 2 a.m.
Cithéa Nova, 112 rue Oberkampf, 11e (% 01-40-21-70-95; Métro:
Parmentier or Ménilmontant), was taken over by the bar across the
street and serves lunch, dinner, and brunch as well as an eclectic mix of
world, jazz, and funk music. You can catch concerts Wednesday through
Saturday, and a DJ spins after midnight or whenever the bands aren’t
playing. Cover is free; drinks range from 4 to 12 ($6.40–$19). Open
daily 9 p.m. to 5 a.m.
All kinds of electronic music plays on the lightship Batofar, across from
11 quai François Mauriac, 13e (% 01-53-60-17-30; Métro: Bibliothèque
François Mitterand or Quai de la Gare). It’s a hot, sweaty, and ultimately
fun time. Music can be anything from drum-and-bass to British pop, and
the party can go on all night. La Cantine, its small snack bar, serves
lunch and dinner between noon and 2 p.m. and 7:30 and 11:30 p.m. The
clientele, in their 20s and early 30s, crowd the ship all night, but it’s still
worth it. Hours can change based on the night, but plan on getting there
between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. Monday to Saturday. Cover ranges from free
to 15 ($18) depending on the band or DJ for the night. During July and
August, Batofar has Outdoor Summer Sessions where, for 5 ($8)
between 6 and 8 p.m., you can learn African dance or how to make old
clothes hip.
Elysée Montmartre, 72 bd. De Rochechouart, 18e (% 01-42-92-45-36;
Métro: Anvers), a club that serves the dual function of disco and major
concert hall, celebrated its bicentennial in 2007. The birthplace of the
can-can, now it’s home to club nights that pull in more than 1,000
dancers. Moby, Björk, U2, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers are just some
big musical acts that have headlined here. Check Pariscope for events
and prices. Dances are usually held 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. Cover charges vary
from 15 to more than 25 ($24–$40), depending on the event.
Chapter 16: Hitting the Clubs and Bars 315

Where else in Paris will you dance to the Hives and the Cure followed by
some electro-pop spun by great DJs (and down some great beer, too)?
It’s at the unassuming Le Truskel, 12 rue Feydeau, 2e (% 01-40-26-59-27;
Métro: Bourse, Grands Boulevards), an Irish pub with a basement
“microclub” that has been drawing in crowds of 20-somethings since it
opened in 2002. Bands are rumored to relax here after sets at bigger
clubs; the U.K.’s Pete Doherty played in June 2008. Open Tuesday 8 p.m.
to 3 a.m., Wednesday to Saturday 8 p.m. to 5 a.m.
Josephine Baker, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Simone de Beauvoir loved danc-
ing in the basement dance hall at La Coupole, 102 bd. du Montparnasse,
14e (% 01-43-20-14-20; Métro: Vavin). It’s still a retro venue with plush
banquettes but its sounds are 21st century: salsa, house, and electro-
soul. The cover is around 14 ($22). During the week, the club shuts
down between 2 to 3 a.m., and Fridays and Saturdays the party lasts
from midnight to 5:30 a.m.
Also in Montparnasse are two enormously popular clubs; Red Light,
34 rue du Départ, 15e (reservations % 01-42-79-94-53 from 2–8 p.m.;
www.enfer.fr; Métro: Montparnasse Bienvenue), a large club that wel-
comes an even larger crowd. With some seating and multiple raised plat-
forms above the floor for those who dare to dance, you can watch the
trendiest kids in town wearing the oddest new fashions available. Cover
can vary, usually it starts around 15 ($24) with a two-drink minimum,
but some nights are free: Check the Web site to see if reduced or free
passes can be printed out (usually you have to show up before a certain
hour). Just around the corner is Club Mix, 24 rue de l’Arrivée (% 01-
56-80-37-37; www.mixclub.fr; Métro: Montparnasse Bienvenue). Groove
with the fashionistas on Fridays and Saturdays until 5 a.m. to house and
“tek-house” beats. Le Mix boasts spinning provided by some of Paris’s
best DJs. Le Mix also has a varying cover — many nights are free admis-
sion before midnight; always check on the Web beforehand.
You’ll have to get past some of the strictest bouncers in Paris to dance
in a basement that is essentially under the Louvre at classy Cab (for-
merly Cabaret), 2 place du Palais Royal, 1er (% 01-58-62-56-25; www.
cabaret.fr; Métro: Palais Royal-Musée du Louvre). It’s also a restaurant
until 11 p.m. Here you can rub shoulders with models, businessmen 
and -women, and some BCBG children of rich and old-name families,
though this place has more of an out-of-town crowd. Indigo lighting illu-
minates furniture that looks like it was grown and not assembled. There
are two bars with shiny black or glass surfaces, and three different seating
areas (not counting the VIP section). Music is house, ’80s, and rhythm and
blues, with American hits mixed in. Admission runs 28 to 30 ($45–$48).
Open Wednesday and Friday through Sunday from midnight until 5 a.m.
Located next door to le Moulin Rouge, huge trilevel La Loco, 90 bd. 
de Clichy, 18e (% 01-53-41-88-89; Métro: Blanche), is popular with
American students and young people from Paris and the surrounding
suburbs. Each level is devoted to a different sound: You may hear house,
Part V: Living It Up After Dark: Paris Nightlife 
316

techno, hip-hop, raï (remixed traditional music, mostly from Algeria, but
consisting of all the countries of the Maghreb), or metal, so all can find
their niche. The sous-sol (basement) is the most chilled-out of the three
levels, where you can see the remnants of an old railway line (hence the
name). Cover Tuesday through Thursday is 12 ($19) without a drink
and 14 ($22) with one drink; cover on Friday is 15 ($24) without a
drink and 18 ($29) with one drink; on Saturday it’s 15 ($24) without a
drink and 20 ($32) with a drink. Open daily 11 p.m. to 6 a.m.
On the outskirts of the Marais is the small bar/club Favela Chic, 18 rue
Faubourg du Temple, 11e (% 01-40-21-38-14; Métro: République). Now
that a branch of the club has opened up in London, this Brazilian music
venue is even more packed, if that’s possible. A restaurant by day, at
night the long tables in the front area fill up with laughing 20- to 30-year-
olds of diverse backgrounds and ethnicities. The dance floor is also
always packed, and big comfy couches and chairs line the best areas to
dance, if you can snag one. The music is often remixed Brazilian club-
bing fare, but there is also electro, hip-hop, and other eclectic selections
made by the DJs. It can get very sweaty, but drinks are reasonably
priced (6/$7 cocktails). Entry is free during the week and 10 ($16) on
weekends. Open Tuesdays through Thursdays from 8 p.m. to 2 a.m., on
Friday and Saturday it stays open until 4 a.m.
Literally facing the door at the same address as Favela Chic is Le Gibus
(% 01-47-00-78-88), another popular dance club that is also less expen-
sive and rocks all night. The DJs here play more popular dance music,
reggae, hip-hop, and top forties hits from the ’70s to the ’90s. A little less
eclectic than its neighbor, it is still very popular among the diverse
crowd. Cover is 20 ($32), which includes a drink. One of Paris’s most
important and popular tech clubs, Rex, 5 bd. Poissonière, 2e (% 01-
42-36-83-98; Métro: Bonne Nouvelle), has arguably Paris’s best sound
system and most popular DJs. Open Wednesday to Saturday 11 p.m. to 
6 a.m. Closed August. Admission is free to 15 ($24).
Gay Paree: The Scene
Paris has been a destination for gay parties since before the Code
Napoléon decriminalized homosexual relations back in the 19th century.
Although some of these delightful dens are mainstays that maintain
clientele for years (like le Queen), others appear and disappear as
quickly as quirky clothing trends.
The local weekly or bi-weekly rags devoted to the nightlife, which
include Gai Pied Hebdo, Illico, and Paris Next, do their best to keep up
with the hottest destinations. You can pick them up in most gay bars or
bookstores in and around le Marais. The pickings for lesbian locations
are less profound, as usual; check out Lesbia magazine for club and bar
listings. Other reading material includes Têtu and PREF (Préférences)
Mag, which have special nightlife inserts and cover most of the coun-
try’s gay bars and clubs.
Chapter 16: Hitting the Clubs and Bars 317

Amnesia Café, 42 rue Vieille-du-Temple, 4e (% 01-42-72-16-94; Métro:
Hôtel-de-Ville), is a relaxed cafe/bar/bistro/club with three bar areas,
including the basement level Amni-Club. A specialty here is Café
Amnesia, whiskey-infused coffee topped with whipped cream. Decorated
in warm, coppery tones and furnished with comfortable leather chairs
and banquettes, the cafe is open daily 11 a.m. to 2 a.m.; the club is open
daily 8:30 p.m. to 2 a.m., later on the weekends.
Le Carré, 18 rue du Temple, 4e (% 01-44-59-38-57), is a currently ultrahip
bar and restaurant with modern décor. Eat dinner here on banquettes
against a backlit wall of painted glass or snack on tapas beneath the bar’s
suspended light bulbs. Open daily 10 a.m. to 4 a.m.
For those who enjoy thumping music and large crowds, Raidd, 23 rue du
Temple, 4e (call the Open Café for details; see later in this section; www.
raiddbar.com; Métro: Hôtel de Ville), is the place for you. Dance, top-
forties, and house music abound, and Raidd’s a must-visit for those
taking in the gay scene in Paris. Some nights have go-go dancers taking
showers behind a glass wall. Open daily until 5 a.m.
L’Oiseau Bariolé, 16 rue de la St-Croix de la Brétonnerie, 4e (Métro:
Hôtel de Ville, Rambuteau), is a cozy place featuring mauve and purple
leather and velvet seating, a convivial crowd of locals, and a buy-one-get-
one-free happy hour.
Located in the pedestrian zone of Les Halles, the Banana Café, 13 rue de
la Ferronerie, 1er (% 01-42-33-35-31; Métro: Châtelet-Les Halles), often
has a mixed crowd. Open all night, it has a street-level bar and a dance
floor in the basement with live piano music or a DJ. After 10 p.m., things
get crazy, with go-go boys dancing on the bar (look for holiday-themed
costumes) or on platforms in the basement.
One of Paris’s oldest lesbian bars, La Champmeslé, 4 rue Chabanais, 2e
(% 01-42-96-85-20; Métro: Pyramides), is a few blocks east of the avenue
de l’Opéra, and features an older, sophisticated crowd. This comfortable
bar for women has cabaret singing each Thursday night, and on Tuesdays
there are tarot card readings. Also featured are art exhibitions, literary
readings, and other themed nights. Open daily 4 p.m. to dawn.
Previously Les Scandaleuses, le 3w Kafé, 8 rue des Ecouffes, 4e (% 01-
48-87-39-26; Métro: St-Paul), sets a relaxed tone for a diverse mix of
women, with styles running from pink-haired punk to denim and flannel.
It features speed dating some weeknights. This place is simply jammed
on weekends and the crowd spills out onto the sidewalk. Open daily 
5 p.m. to 2 a.m.
Fridays and Saturdays are known for Le Bal Gai at Le Tango/Le Bôite à
Frissons (the Thrill Box), 13 rue au Maire, 4e (% 01-42-72-17-78; www.
Part V: Living It Up After Dark: Paris Nightlife 
318

boite-a-frissons.fr; Métro: Arts et Métiers), with music ranging
from accordion (the thrill box) to disco and an emphasis on couples
dancing. (No techno gets played here!) Singles dances are often held;
consult the Web site for more information. Tea dances start late after-
noon Sundays. Open at 11 p.m. and continuing until 5 a.m.
Oh Fada! at 35 rue Ste-Croix de la Bretonnerie, 4e (% 01-40-29-44-40),
was started by the night club team Follivores (they organize gay parties
throughout Paris), and is populated by a friendly and convivial crowd of
a mixed age. Described as “atypique,” it is popular among those who are
tired of the gay-ghetto snobbism (but still want cute bartenders). Open
Monday to Wednesday and Sunday 5 p.m. to 2 a.m., Thursday to
Saturday 5 p.m. to 4 a.m.
Eager patrons often wait in a line outside to gain entry to Open Café,
17 rue des Archives, 4e (% 01-42-72-26-18; Métro: Hôtel de Ville). It is

Off the beaten path in Paris
LGBT Parisians often complain that their urban life is concentrated into one place: the
Marais. Gay travelers may find it refreshing to leave behind the Chelsea/Castro-esque
“ghetto,” as it is often referred to, and be themselves outside the narrow confines of
the former marshland.
Le Clauzel, 29 Rue Clauzel, 9e (% 01-45-26-08-96), a bar-resto in the 9e arrondisse-
ment, is ideal because it caters to nobody in particular. Owned by a gay couple, neigh-
borhood folks stop by all day to say hello or wet their whistles, as do the transvestites
from Pigalle, gay tourists, and regulars, and anyone else looking for a regular neigh-
borhood bar that happens to sport a big rainbow flag.
In the mood for some cabaret with your dinner? L’Artishow, 3 cité Souzy (% 01-43-
48-56-04; www.artishowlive.com), is the best cross-dressing performance art
you can see on this side of the pond, found in the newly hip 11e. Clever, queer, and
wildly entertaining, L’Artishow’s performances have seen much praise by le Figaro,
along with other national media outlets. They even have a 12:30 p.m. lunch show if you
had evening picnic plans.
In the nearby 10e arrondissement is an establishment that defies definition, a reminder
of why Paris remains a world cultural center. Le Point Éphémère, 200 quai de Valmy,
10e (% 01-40-34-02-48; www.pointephemere.org; Métro: Jaurès or Louis Blanc),
is many things; a cafe and restaurant, but also a concert hall, art gallery, discussion
forum, dance studio, and so on and so forth. An urban commune of art and culture, it
should be no surprise that le Point Éphémère, while mixed, is a haven for queer folks
of all ages and backgrounds looking to express themselves, or to meet new friends to
discuss philosophy over a double-espresso.

THE classic gay watering hole of Paris, in business for years and still a
favorite among locals and tourists. Basic cafe fare is served all day. Open
Sunday to Thursday 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. and Friday and Saturday until
around 4 a.m.
Queen, 102 av. des Champs-Elysées, 8e (% 01-53-89-08-90; Métro:
George V), is still one of the hottest clubs in town, with nightly crowds
so thick you may find it difficult to get a drink. A walk-up balcony lets
you watch the crowd from up high, and across the way is a stage sus-
pended 6m (20 ft.) in the air, from which dancers perch and sway to the
music. Weekends may include drag shows or strippers. Cover (including
one drink, with or without alcohol) is 15 ($24) Sunday and Tuesday to
Thursday; Friday, Saturday, and Monday cover (including one drink, with
or without alcohol) is 20 ($32). Open daily from midnight to 6 a.m.
For a fairly small dancing venue, Folies Pigalle, 11 place Pigalle, 9e 
(% 01-48-78-25-56), is quite popular. The crowd is a genial mix of gays
and straights (the gays say there are more straights, and vice versa)
dancing and drinking in a former cabaret-like theater. Sundays are Afro-
Latino-House nights; the club claims it’s the only such party in Paris.
Kicking Back with Classy Cocktails
Whether you’re looking for a bar to go before clubbing or a quiet, roman-
tic place to unwind with a drink, these locations are highly recommended.
Most bars and lounges in Paris open daily at 9 p.m., but no one arrives
until after midnight. They generally close around 4 a.m.
Andy Whaloo, 69 rue des Gravilliers, 3e (% 01-42-71-20-38; Métro: 
Arts-et-Métiers), is owned by the people who run the terrific restaurant
Le 404 next door and serves as that restaurant’s unofficial waiting room
as well as a hip spot to sip pricey drinks. Looking something like your
grandparents’ Moroccan-themed basement with old bottles displayed in
the windows and Moroccan grocery sundries making up the décor, hip
Parisian denizens pretend not to check each other out from low seats
around the small room.
At Alcazar, 62 rue Mazarine, 6e (% 01-53-10-19-99; Métro: Odéon), ele-
ments of traditional brasserie style, such as banquettes and mirrors, are
slicked up with modern flair and mixed with innovations such as a mez-
zanine with indigo walls and heavenly overstuffed chairs. This place is
ultra-sophisticated and its patrons quite chic.
In the swanky neighborhood near the Champs-Elysées is Nirvana
Lounge, 3 av. Matignon, 8e (% 01-53-89-18-91; Métro: Franklin D.
Roosevelt), sporting a bright pink entrance with flashy curves, and
celebutante clientele. The lounge music playing is this place’s own,
released every year and sold at the bar. The food is excellent, from a
former chef at the Ritz, and super expensive, just like everything else
Part V: Living It Up After Dark: Paris Nightlife 
320

here. Cocktails are superior, the bar staff attentive, and you will spend
more than 14 ($22) a pop on most drinks. Open every day, from 8 a.m.
to 2 a.m.
Harry’s New York Bar, 5 rue Daunou, 2e (% 01-42-61-71-14; Métro:
Opéra or Pyramides), has been one of Europe’s most famous bars, as
popular today as it was in the time of that notorious Lost Generation 
of writers who really knew how to ring up a bar tab. It is said that the
bloody mary was invented here, and the selection of whiskey is amazing.
The 1930s Piano Bar resembles the inside of a cozy yacht. Founded in
1911, aged 30+ French locals and tourists make up the crowd. Open
every day from 10:30 a.m. to 4 a.m.
Thinking about flammenkeuche on an empty stomach is not recom-
mended. These large, square, thin-crusted pizzas topped with cream,
herbs, and goodies such as salmon, ham, and goat cheese are the draw
at La Fabrique, 53 rue du Faubourg St-Antoine, 11e (% 01-43-07-67-07;
Métro: Bastille). The restaurant is sleek, the bar is minimalist, and the
color to wear appears to be black, if the trendy crowd that frequents the
place has anything to say about it. Although the bar is open until around
4 a.m., depending on the crowds, food is served only until midnight. Be
ready to stand in line on the weekends, and look out for private parties
when the restaurant is closed to the public. Open every day from 9 a.m.
to 4 a.m.
In a neighborhood juxtaposed with chic and grunge, Café Etienne
Marcel, 34 rue Etienne Marcel, 2e (% 01-45-08-01-03; Métro: Etienne
Marcel), is another funky Paris hangout from the Costes brothers, who
really seem to be buying up Paris bars and restaurants. White plastic
seats and walls with bold colors and graffiti art in an airy space make a
fine place for ordering a complicated drink. The music playing is from
the yearly release of the Hôtel Costes CDs. Open every day from 11 a.m.
to 2 a.m.
Le Bar, in the Hotel Plaza-Athénée, 25 av. Montaigne, 8e (% 01-53-67-66-
65; Métro: Alma-Marceau), is one of the in spots in Paris, where a crowd
with champagne taste sips drinks that cost more than some bottles of
wine. Unless you’re somebody (or on the arm of somebody), there’s 
no guarantee you’ll get in, and when you do, be prepared to withstand
the once-over you’ll receive from the other fabulously dressed people.
Service is reportedly slow at times. Drinks start at around 20 ($32).
The Lizard Lounge, 18 rue du Bourg-Tibourg, 4e (% 01-42-72-81-34;
Métro: Hôtel-de-Ville), is small and stylish, a pleasant place to hang out
with an arty, international crowd — if you can hear them. The music is
loud the later into the night you get, and the heavy-gauge steel balcony
overlooking the main bar doesn’t offer much of a chance for quieter con-
versation. Still, this is a great venue on three levels with a menu of good
beers and drinks. Even the bathrooms have funky décor, with their lizard
logo inlaid on some surfaces. Live bands play or a DJ spins dance music
in the refurbished basement weeknights and all weekend.
Chapter 16: Hitting the Clubs and Bars 321

Sit outside for fantastic people-watching, or choose from three floors of
funky art-covered walls and sit in one of the antique chairs at Les Etages,
5 rue de Buci, 6e (% 01-46-34-26-26). Popular among young profession-
als, the cocktails list here is extensive and complete: Try all sorts of
champagne-mixed fruit cocktails, or trust their bartenders to mix you
something stronger but with just as much flavor. You can eat as many of
their fantastic honey-roasted peanuts as you want, but after two refills,
they will definitely give a judgmental glare. Open every day from 11 a.m.
to 2 a.m.
Spending an Evening at a French Cabaret
Forget everything you think Parisian cabaret is like. Today’s “can-can
girls” are often overshadowed by light shows, special effects, and tinny
recorded music, though if you’re expecting to see lots of flesh in today’s
Parisian revues, you won’t be disappointed. The shows are highly over-
rated and very expensive but continue to be a huge attraction for
tourists. The infamous Folies Bergères no longer exists as a cabaret; it’s
now a concert hall.
When seeing a Parisian cabaret show, have dinner somewhere else and
save yourself some cash. For the money you’d spend at the cabaret, you
can have an absolutely fabulous meal at one of the pricier suggestions 
in Chapter 10. Some of the cabarets admit children, though not kids
younger than four. Be aware that every other member of the audience
may be from another country — these are some of the least Parisian
experiences you can have while still being in Paris.
The Crazy Horse, Paris, 12 av. George V, 8e (% 01-47-23-32-32; www.
lecrazyhorseparis.com; Métro: George V), looks like a strip club with
the red silhouette of a naked woman on its glass doors. One can see
Taboo, a striptease show that highlights each dancer (who have names
like Vanity Starlight, Bee Bee Opaline, and Nooka Karamel). Depending
on your seats, cover and two drinks cost 100 ($160) at the bar to 120
($192) in the orchestra with a half-bottle of champagne. Special dinner-
show packages with restaurants De Vez, Chez Francis, and Fouquet’s
start at 150 ($240). There are two shows nightly at 8:30 and 11 p.m.,
with three shows on Saturday at 7:30, 9:45, and 11:50 p.m.
The Lido, 116 av. des Champs-Elysées, 8e (% 01-40-76-56-10; www.lido.
fr; Métro: George V), features the revue Bonheur, which pays tribute to
the sensuality of women. Spanning Paris and India and including movie
and cabaret classics, it is supposedly the most expensive spectacle in
Europe. The show with dinner and a half-bottle of champagne costs
140 to 280 ($224–$448); with just drinks, the show starts at 90
($144) for the later show at 11:30 p.m., and 100 ($160) for the earlier
show at 9:30 p.m. Check the Web site for such promotions as a com-
bined evening at the Lido and Seine river cruise.

Frank Sinatra once performed here, at probably the most famous of the
cabarets, the Moulin Rouge, place Blanche, Montmartre, 18e (% 01-
53-09-82-82; www.moulinrouge.fr; Métro: place Blanche). It’s been
packing in crowds since 1889, and its signature can-can dancers, made
famous in paintings by Toulouse-Lautrec, still bare breasts in the show’s
finale today. Edith Piaf, Yves Montand, and Charles Aznavour made their
reputations at the Moulin Rouge, though its show Féerie, is nothing like
an evening of French chanson. Instead, expect comedy, animal, and
magic acts with scantily clad women bumping and grinding around the
stage. Table seats have better views than seats at the bar. A bar seat 
and two drinks cost 99 ($158) for the 9 p.m. show, 89 ($142) for the 
11 p.m. show. Dinner followed by the 9 p.m. show costs 145 to 175
($232–$280); you must arrive for dinner by 7 p.m.
The Paradis Latin, 28 rue Cardinal-Lemoine, 5e (% 01-43-25-28-28;
www.paradislatin.fr; Métro: Cardinal-Lemoine), bills itself as the
most Parisian of the French cafes, and its building has quite the pedi-
gree; it was designed by Gustave Eiffel. A genial master encourages audi-
ence participation during a show that’s less gimmick-filled with more
song and dance routines than the others. To save money, forgo dinner
for the lower-priced Champagne Revue, which includes a half-bottle of
bubbly and costs 82 ($131); dinner (at 8 p.m.) plus show packages
range from 117 to 170 ($187–$272). Performances are Wednesday
through Monday, with a 9:30 p.m. showtime.

Part VI
The Part of Tens

In this part . . . 
O
kay, these little extras won’t make or break your trip, but
they may just make it a little more fun. In Chapter 17, we
give you the inside scoop on where to ﬁnd spectacular views of
the city — without the other tourists. In Chapter 18, we show
you where to make like Manet and have déjeuner sur l’herbe —
in other words, the best places to go for a fabulous picnic.

Chapter 17
Ten (Well, Nine) Places 
to See Paris — Without 
the Lines
In This Chapter
 Finding a fantastic panorama off the beaten path
 Discovering some special Paris vistas
W
ith wait times at the Eiffel Tower guaranteed to exceed an hour
and sometimes two in high season (and not a whole lot less at
the Arc de Triomphe) you may wish you could spend the time differ-
ently. Fortunately, there are lots of other places to observe Paris vistas
without long lines, if any. Some are even free!
Galeries Lafayette
The sixth floor cafeteria of Galeries Lafayette’s main store, 40 bd.
Haussmann, 9e (% 01-42-82-34-56; Métro: Opéra or Chaussée-d’Antin),
is sleek and modern and sells fresh hot and cold food. But one of the
best reasons to come here is for the views over the rooftops of Paris. If
you’re not hungry for a meal, at least try the delicious hand-scooped ice
cream from the cart here, grab a table beside a window, and enjoy! See
Chapter 12.
La Madeleine
See rue Royale, place de la Concorde and the obelisk, and, across the
Seine, the dome of Invalides after climbing the 28 steps of La Madeleine
church, place de la Madeleine, 8e (% 01-44-51-69-00; Métro: Madeleine).
After taking in the view, pop inside to see Rude’s Le Baptême du Christ,
which is on the left as you enter. See Chapter 11.

Panthéon
A spectacular view of the Eiffel Tower and the surrounding neighbor-
hoods is available from the Panthéon’s dome, place du Panthéon, 5e 
(% 01-44-32-18-00; Métro: Cardinal-Lemoine or Maubert-Mutualité; Bus:
21, 27, 83, 84, 85, 89). This museum, once a mausoleum that was once a
church built in honor of the patron saint of Paris now boasts Foucault’s
pendulum hanging from the domed ceiling. The hill on which the
Panthéon is built is a terrific place to see fireworks on Bastille Day. See
Chapter 11.
Parc de Belleville
It’s off the beaten track, sure, but this park in the 20e offers tree-lined
promenades (more than 500 trees are here) and magnificent Left Bank
views peeping through the spaces between pretty houses. Beds of roses
and other seasonal flowers line walks and views of the city’s Left Bank
become more pronounced the higher up the terraced pathways you go.
(Located in the 20e; take the métro to Pyrénées, then walk down rue de
Belleville and turn left onto rue Piat where you see arched iron gates
leading into the park; you can also take the métro to Courrones, cross
bd. de Belleville and turn left onto rue Julien Lacroix, where another
entrance is located.) See Chapter 11.
Pont des Arts
This steel-and-wood, seven-arched, pedestrian-only footbridge connects
the entrance to the Louvre on one end with the magnificent Acadèmie
Français on the other. The walk across offers breathtaking views all across
the river, but especially of the tree-lined tip of Ile de la Cité with the spires
of Notre-Dame and Sainte-Chapelle, the turrets of the Conciergerie, and
the fabulous curving, white apartment and judicial buildings. (Métro: Pont
Neuf; walk west along quai de Louvre or quai de la Conti. It’s the bridge
directly to the west of Pont Neuf.)
Restaurant Georges at the 
Centre Georges Pompidou
It used to be that visitors to the Centre Georges Pompidou could skip
the museum entirely and ride the escalators on the outside of the build-
ing (enclosed in a plastic tube like a giant gerbil habitat) to the top for
breathtaking views of the city. That’s no longer permitted; you need to
buy a ticket for the museum first. Unless, of course, you have drinks,
lunch, or dinner at the trendy Costes brothers restaurant Georges (you
need a reservation to gain access to the floor). The entrance is to the left
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
328

of the museum’s main entrance, 19 rue Beaubourg, 4e (% 01-44-78-47-
99; Métro: Rambuteau or Châtelet). See Chapter 10.
Sacré-Coeur
To see the view from Sacré-Coeur in the 18e, 25 rue du Chevalier-de-la-
Barre, 18e (% 01-53-41-89-00; Métro: Anvers — take the elevator up and
follow signs to the funiculaire, which runs to the church; Bus: the local
Montmartrobus is the only bus that goes to the top of the hill), you have
two choices: The first method is the free panorama from the wall just in
front of the church (use the coin-operated viewing machines); or you
can pay 5 ($8) to visit Sacré-Coeur’s dome. To reach the dome, face the
church and walk around to its left side, following signs for the Dome and
Crypte. Walk down a set of stairs and follow a walkway about 15m (50 ft.)
to an iron gate. The entrance and ticket machine are on your right. The
climb from church floor to dome is up a flight of nail-bitingly steep
corkscrew steps, but the view is worth it. See Chapter 11.
Tour Montparnasse
At a height of 207m (689 ft.), the Tour Montparnasse, 33 av. du Maine, 15e
(that looming black skyscraper on the Left Bank; % 01-45-38-52-56; Métro:
Montparnasse-Bienvenüe), towers above Paris, and from its panoramic
roof terrace on the 56th floor, you can see as far as 40km (nearly 25 miles)
in nice weather. Right next to the Gare du Montparnasse, it’s a bit pricey
(9/$15 adults, 6.50/$11 students 16–20 years, 4/$6.40 ages 7–15), but
the views are exceptional — you’ve never seen Paris like this!
The Towers at Notre-Dame
Climb 387 narrow and winding steps to the top of one of the towers here
for Quasimodo’s view of the gargoyles and of Paris below. My advice: If
you plan to visit the tower, go early in the morning! Lines stretch down
the square in front of the cathedral during the summer. It’s at 6 Parvis
Notre-Dame, Ile de la Cité, 4e (% 01-42-34-56-10; Métro: Cité or St-Michel;
RER: St-Michel; Bus: 21, 38, 85, 96). See Chapter 11.
Chapter 17: Ten (Well, Nine) Places to See Paris 329

Chapter 18
Ten-Plus Great Places 
for a Picnic
In This Chapter
 Finding that special place to enjoy a meal in plein air (fresh air)
 Enjoying Paris like a Parisian
P
ick up some delicious meats, sweets, and wine (see Chapter 12 for
recommendations) from one of Paris’s open-air markets, traiteurs
(gourmet food shops), or grocery stores and enjoy an open-air feast
without the worry of tipping or dressing to dine. Best of all, you can lay
down for a snooze right after you eat.
A word of advice: Such parks as the Luxembourg Gardens or the
Tuileries jealously guard their lawns; you may have to walk a bit before
you find a spot where you can spread out on the grass. But chairs are
everywhere — some even have reclining backs! — and you can pull a
few right up to a fountain and eat amidst the spray from the water. If this
seems too public, your best bet is to try the vast Bois de Vincennes or
Bois de Boulogne where you can picnic nearly anywhere. Don’t forget to
clean up afterward.
Banks of the Seine near the Musée 
de Sculpture en Plein Air
Twenty-nine artists created abstract works that complement the medita-
tive mood that the banks of the Seine inspire (kids climb all over them).
Sculptures include those by French sculptor César Baldaccini and the
Belarorussian Ossip Zadkine. Wander amid the sculptures before you
spread out your meal in this waterside park that’s really a museum (the
name Musée de Sculpture en Plein Air translates to “Open-Air Sculpture
Museum”) (Métro: Sully-Morland or Gare d’Austerlitz).

Bois de Boulogne
A former royal forest and hunting ground, this vast reserve of more than
880 hectares (2,200 acres) has jogging paths, horseback riding paths,
cycling (rentals are available), and boating on two lakes. Picnic areas are
abundant here. The Longchamp and Auteuil racecourses are located
here, as is the Jardin Shakespeare in the Pré Catelan, a garden contain-
ing many of the plants and herbs mentioned in Shakespeare’s plays
(Métro: Porte Maillot, Porte Dauphine, or Porte Auteuil).
Bois de Vincennes
Rent canoes or bikes or visit the parc Zoologique (zoo) and petting zoo
after you picnic on the extensive grounds at the Bois de Vincennes,
which also has a Buddhist center, complete with a temple. The Chateau
de Vincennes, where early monarchs such as Charles V and Henri III
sought refuge from wars, is also the place where Mata Hari met her
demise. The parc Floral de Paris (% 01-43-43-92-95) is here with its
spectacular amphitheater (and jazz concerts on summer Sat), a butterfly
garden, library, and miniature golf (Métro: Porte Dorée or Chateau de
Vincennes).
Jardin des Tuileries
The Tuileries is a restful space in the center of Paris that houses the
Orangerie and the Jeu de Paume at its western edge and plays home to
40 beautiful Maillol bronzes scattered among the trees to its east. This
spot is the city’s most formal garden, with pathways and fountains that
invite you to sit on the metal chairs provided and munch on picnic
treats while cooling off in the breezes off the waters.
The name comes from tuiles, which means “tiles” — the clay here was
once used to make roof tiles. The gardens were originally laid out in the
1560s for Catherine de Medici in front of the Tuileries Palace (which
burned down in 1871). In the 17th century, landscape artist André Le
Nôtre, creator of the gardens at Versailles, redesigned a large section
(Métro: Tuileries or Concorde).
Jardin du Luxembourg
You can sit on metal chairs near the boat pond or spread out on grass
open to picnickers directly across from the Palais de Luxembourg, on
the park’s south edge. Not far from the Sorbonne and just south of the
Latin Quarter, the large park is popular with students and children, so it
isn’t the quietest of places. Besides pools, fountains, and statues of
queens and poets, tennis and boules (lawn bowling) courts are available.
Chapter 18: Ten-Plus Great Places for a Picnic 331

See whether you can find the miniature Statue of Liberty (Métro: Odéon;
RER: Luxembourg).
Parc de Belleville
Though the parc de Belleville is out of the way, it’s still a wonderful place
to visit with children, watch the sun set across western Paris, or nosh on
a baguette with saucisson sec (cured sliced sausage, a bit like French
salami). The park has fountains, a children’s play area, an open-air the-
ater with concerts during the summer, rock formations, and grottoes
that evoke the long-ago days when the hill was a strategic point to fight
enemies like Attila the Hun. Beds of roses and other seasonal flowers
line the walks, and views of the city’s Left Bank become more pro-
nounced the higher up the terraced pathways you go.
Take the métro to Pyrénées; then walk down rue de Belleville and turn
left onto rue Piat, where you see arched iron gates leading into the park
(spelling out the words Villa Ottoz). A curved path leads you to tree-
lined promenades (more than 500 trees are here) with the first of the
magnificent Left Bank views peeping through the spaces between pretty
houses. You can also take the métro to Courrones, cross boulevard de
Belleville, and turn left onto rue Julien Lacroix where another entrance is
located.
Parc de la Villette
Picnic at Parc de la Villette in the summer while watching an outdoor
movie or listening to a concert. Afterward, you and your kids can visit
the enormous children’s museum complex, the Cité des Sciences et de
l’Industrie (Museum of Science and Industry), and the Musée de la
Musique (Music Museum), located on the grounds. This modern park
has a series of theme gardens and includes an exotic bamboo garden
and a garden featuring steam and water jets. Scattered throughout the
park are playgrounds and other attractions (see Chapter 11). The most
fun way to get here is to take a canal trip from Pont l’Arsenal or the
Musée d’Orsay (see Chapter 11). You can also take the métro to Porte 
de la Villette.
Parc des Buttes-Chaumont
Parc des Buttes-Chaumont is one of the four man-made parks that
Napoléon III commissioned to resemble the English gardens he grew to
love during his exile in England. Built on the site of a former gypsum (a
mineral used to make plaster) quarry and a centuries-old dump, it fea-
tures cliffs, waterfalls, a lake, and a cave topped by a temple. You have
plenty of places to lay out your picnic spread here. For a pleasurable
walk to further whet your appetite, exit at Métro Danube. Walk east
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
332

along rue David d’Angers until you find villa du Danube, a sloping road.
Follow this through to villa de la Renaissance, and you will discover rue
de Mouzaïa: Along this walk and around here you can wander beautiful
cobblestoned streets (all called “villa” something) with houses that look
nothing like the rest of Paris, sporting ivied balconies and Provençal-
style roofs (Métro: Buttes-Chaumont or Danube).
Parc du Champ de Mars
Once a parade ground for French troops, parc du Champ de Mars is the
vast green lawn beneath the Eiffel Tower, extending to the École Militaire
(Military Academy), at its southeast end, where Napoléon was once a stu-
dent. You have plenty of places to relax and contemplate the tower. If you
have an evening picnic (bring wine; it’s okay; everyone else does it!), you
can count the hours passing by watching the blinking lights go on and off
on the Eiffel tower (up until 1 a.m.); listen for cheers and “awwwws” as
people admire the Parisian symbol. After your picnic, take a boat tour of
the Seine from the nearby Bateaux Mouches (Métro: Bir-Hakeim).
Parc Monceau
Marcel Proust’s favorite park, Monceau allegedly contains Paris’s largest
tree — an Oriental plane tree with a circumference of almost 7m (23 ft.).
The painter Carmontelle designed several structures for parc Monceau,
including a Dutch windmill, a Roman temple, a covered bridge, a water-
fall, a farm, medieval ruins, and a pagoda. Garnerin, the world’s first
parachutist, landed here. In the mid–19th century, the park was
redesigned in the English style. There is a small shop near the entrance
where one can buy sweets and drinks; however, I suggest visiting a local
boulangerie instead. Very close by are the fantastic market streets rue
Poncelet and rue des Levis (Métro: Ternes).
Square du Vert Galant
This spot is one of the most romantic in Paris (and may be crowded with
others depending on the time of day and year you visit; I guarantee you’ll
have it all to yourself in Jan, however). Descend the stairs near the middle
of Pont Neuf (near the Pont Neuf tour boats) to this beautiful spot com-
memorating Paris’s favorite king, Henri IV. You’re at the very tip of Ile de la
Cité, in the middle of the Seine. You can spread out on a bench under the
trees and enjoy the stunning views of both banks and the river stretching
out ahead. The square is 7m (23 ft.) lower than the rest of the island; this
was the original level of Paris during the Gallo-Roman period. At sunset,
this is a popular spot for romantics (Métro: Cité).

Fast Facts
American Express
The full-service office at 11 rue Scribe 
(% 01-47-14-50-00) is open Monday
through Friday from 9 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.,
October to April; from May to September,
it’s open until 7:30 p.m. The bank is also
open Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., 
but the mail-pickup window is closed.
ATM Locations
As in big cities everywhere, ATMs are
easy to find in Paris. Most bank branches
have at least one outdoor machine, and
there are ATMs in major department stores
and in train stations. If you want a list of
ATMs that accept MasterCard or Visa
cards before you leave home, ask your
bank, or print out lists from www.visa.
com or www.mastercard.com.
Baby Sitters
Visit the American Church’s basement bul-
letin board where English-speaking (often
American) students post notices offering
baby-sitting services. The church is
located at 65 quai d’Orsay, 7e (% 01-45-
62-05-00; Métro: Invalides). Or try one of
the following agencies that employ some
English-speaking baby sitters: Allo Maman
Dépannage (% 01-47-55-15-75), or Kid
Services (% 08-20-00-02-30 [10/20¢ per
minute]). Specify when calling that you
need a sitter who speaks English.
Business Hours
The grands magasins (department stores)
are generally open Monday through
Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 7 p.m.; smaller
shops close for lunch and reopen around 
2 p.m., but this practice is rarer than it used
to be. Many stores stay open until 7 p.m. in
summer; others are closed Monday, espe-
cially in the morning. Large offices remain
open all day, but some close for lunch.
Banks are normally open weekdays from 
9 a.m. to noon and from 1 or 1:30 to 4:30 p.m.
Some banks also open on Saturday morn-
ing. Some currency-exchange booths are
open very long hours; see “Currency
Exchange,” later in this list.
Camera Repair
Photo Suffren, 45 av. Suffren, 7e (% 01-44-
67-25-25; www.photosuffren.com),
repairs camera equipment on-site at this
location not far from the Eiffel Tower.
Climate
From May to September you can expect
clear sunny days and temperatures in the
70s to high 80s Fahrenheit (21 to 31 degrees
Celsius) at the height of summer. But be pre-
pared for rainy or searingly hot summers,

too. From late October to April the weather
is often gray and misty with a dampness
that gets into your bones. Always bring an
umbrella. Temperatures average about 45
degrees Fahrenheit (7 °C) in winter, and
the low 60s Fahrenheit (17°C) in spring and
autumn. Note: Ignore the song “April in
Paris,” and pack layers for your early
spring trip to the City of Light. It is often
quite chilly.

Currency Exchange
It is so much easier to use your ATM card
to get cash in Paris — you usually get a
better rate of exchange than you do at
bureaux de change (exchange offices),
hotels, restaurants, and shops. Most banks
in Paris have stopped cashing traveler’s
checks and now steer tourists to bureaux
de change. If you must use traveler’s
checks, for good rates, without fees or
commissions, and quick service, try the
Comptoir de Change Opéra, 9 rue Scribe,
9e (% 01-47-42-20-96; Métro: Opéra; RER:
Auber). It is open weekdays from 9 a.m. to
5:30 p.m., Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.
The bureaux de change at all train stations
(except Gare de Montparnasse) are open
daily; those at 63 av. des Champs-Elysées,
8e (Métro: Franklin-D-Roosevelt), and 
140 av. des Champs-Elysées, 8e (Métro:
Charles-de-Gaulle-Étoile), keep long hours.
Despite disadvantageous exchange rates
and long lines, many people prefer to
exchange their money at American
Express (see the “American Express” list-
ing earlier in this Appendix).

loose tobacco, and 2.25 liters of alcohol. If
you’re returning with valuable goods you
already own, such as foreign-made cam-
eras, you need to file form B263.
The duty-free allowance for New Zealand
is NZ$700. Citizens older than 17 can bring
in 200 cigarettes or 50 cigars or 250 grams
of tobacco (or a mixture of all three if their
combined weight doesn’t exceed 250
grams), plus 4.5 liters of wine or beer or 
up to three bottles containing 1.125 liters 
of liquor.
Dentists
You can call your consulate and ask the
duty officer to recommend a dentist. For
dental emergencies, call SOS Urgences
Stomatologique Dentaire (% 01-43-37-
51-00 or 01-42-61-12-00) daily from 9 a.m. 
to midnight.
Doctors
Call your consulate (see “Embassies and
Consulates” later in this list for numbers)
and ask the duty officer to recommend a
doctor, or call SOS Médecins (% 01-43-
07-77-77), a 24-hour service. Most doctors
and dentists speak some English. You can
also call for an appointment at the Centre
Médicale Europe, 44 rue d’Amsterdam 
(% 01-42-81-93-33). Consultations cost
about 20 ($32), and specialists are 
available.
Drugstores
Pharmacies are marked with a green cross
and are often upscale, selling toiletries and
cosmetics in addition to prescription drugs
and over-the-counter remedies. If you’re
shopping for products other than drugs,
buying them elsewhere, such as a super-
marché (supermarket), is almost always
cheaper.
A 24-hour pharmacy, Pharmacie Les
Champs, is conveniently located on the
Champs-Elysées at 84 av. des Champs-
Elysées, 8e (% 01-45-62-02-41; Métro:
George V).
Electricity
The French electrical system runs on 220
volts. You need adapters to convert the
voltage and fit sockets. These are cheaper
at home than they are in Paris. Many
hotels have two-pin (in some cases, three-
pin) sockets for electric razors. Asking
your hotel whether you need an adapter is
a good idea before plugging in any electri-
cal appliance.
Embassies and Consulates
If you have a passport, immigration, legal,
or other problem, contact your consulate.
Call before you go: They often keep
strange hours and observe both French
and home-country holidays. Here’s where
to find them: Australia, 4 rue Jean-Rey, 15e
(% 01-40-59-33-00; Métro: Bir-Hakeim);
Canada, 35 av. Montaigne, 8e (% 01-44-
43-29-00; Métro: Franklin-D-Roosevelt or
Alma Marceau); New Zealand, 7 ter rue
Léonard-de-Vinci, 16e (% 01-45-01-43-43;
Métro: Victor-Hugo); Consulate of Great
Britain, 18 bis rue d’Anjou, 8e (% 01-44-
51-31-02; Métro: Madeleine); Embassy of
Ireland, 4 rue Rude, 16e (% 01-44-17-67-
00). The embassy of the United States, 2 av.
Gabriel, 8e (% 01-43-12-22-22; http://
france.usembassy.gov; Métro:
Concorde), is open Monday through Friday
from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Passports are issued
at its consulate at 2 rue St-Florentin, 1er
(% 01-43-12-22-22; Métro: Concorde),
Paris For Dummies, 5th Edition 
336

between 9 a.m. and noon Monday through
Friday. The consulate is open Monday to
Friday from 9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and 1 to 
3 p.m. and closed on all French and U.S.
holidays.
Emergencies
Dial % 17 for the police (gendarmerie). To
report a fire or if you need an ambulance,
call % 18 (Sapeurs-Pompiers) or % 15 for
SAMU (Service d’Aide Medicale d’Urgence),
a private ambulance company.
Hospitals
Two hospitals with English-speaking staff
are the American Hospital of Paris, 63 bd.
Victor-Hugo, Neuilly-sur-Seine (% 01-46-
41-25-25), just west of Paris proper (Métro:
Les Sablons or Levallois-Perret), and the
Hôpital Franco-Brittanique, 3 rue Barbes
Levallois-Perret (% 01-46-39-22-22), just
north of Neuilly, across the city line north-
west of Paris (Métro: Anatole-France).
Note that the American Hospital charges
about $600 a day for a room, not including
doctor’s fees. The emergency department
charges more than $60 for a visit, not
including tests or X-rays.
Information
Before you go, contact the French
Government Tourist Office, Maison de la
France, 825 Third Ave., 29th floor, New
York, NY 10022 (France-on-call Hotline: 
% 514-288-1904; www.francetourism.
com). The city’s tourist information office,
L’Office du Tourisme et des Congrès de
Paris (www.parisinfo.com), maintains
two full-service welcome centers. Both
offer basic information about attractions in
the city, help with last-minute hotel reser-
vations, make booking for day trips, and
sell transportation and museum passes —
but for a small fee. The first, in Gare du
Nord (Métro: Gare du Nord) beneath the
glass roof, is open daily from 8 a.m. to 
6 p.m. The second, the Opéra-Grands
Magasins Welcome Center at 11 rue
Scribe (Métro: Opéra or Chaussée d’Antin),
is open Monday to Saturday from 9 a.m. to
6:30 p.m.
Several auxiliary offices, or welcome cen-
ters, are scattered throughout the city. The
office in Gare de Lyon (Métro: Gare de
Lyon) is open Monday through Saturday
from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. The welcome center
in Gare du Nord is open daily from 8 a.m. to
6 p.m. There are two offices in Montmartre,
at 21 place du Tertre (Métro: Abbesses),
open daily from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., and on the
median strip facing 72 bd. Rochechouart
(Métro: Anvers), open daily from 10 a.m. to
6 p.m. The welcome center in the Louvre
(Métro: Palais Royal or Musée du Louvre) 
is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., while
the nearby Pyramides office, 25 rue des
Pyramides (Métro: Pyramides), is open
daily from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. from June 1 to
October 31, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. the rest of the
year. Paris’s convention center, Paris Expo
(Métro: Porte de Versailles), has an infor-
mation desk open 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. during
trade fairs.
Internet Access
There is no single chain of Internet cafes
in Paris, so the best way to find one is to
wander around the streets in the Latin
Quarter, home to the Sorbonne and other
colleges, which is the best thing to do
while in Paris anyway. Rates start at
around 1.50 ($2.40) for the first 10 min-
utes. Most hotels now have wireless
Internet (Wi-Fi) or free or low-cost com-
puter access in the salon or lobby area.
Language
In the tourist areas of Paris, English is
widely understood. As you move into more
residential sections of the city, however,
you will probably meet people who don’t
speak English. I suggest carrying a pocket-
sized phrasebook such as Berlitz Phrase
Appendix A: Quick Concierge 337

Book: French, available at all bookstores
(or use the glossary in Appendix B).
Laundry and Dry Cleaning
The more expensive your hotel, the more it
costs to have your laundry or dry cleaning
done there. Instead, find a laundry near
you by consulting the Yellow Pages under
Laveries pour particuliers. Take as many
coins as you can. Washing and drying 6kg
(13 lb.) usually costs 8 ($13). Dry cleaning
is nettoyage à sec; look for shop signs with
the word PRESSING, and don’t expect to
have your clothes back within an hour; you
may be able to get them back the next day
if you ask nicely. The dry cleaning chain 5
à Sec has stores across Paris.
Liquor Laws
Supermarkets, grocery stores, and cafes
sell alcoholic beverages. The legal drink-
ing age is 16. Persons younger than 16 can
be served an alcoholic drink in a bar or
restaurant when accompanied by a parent
or legal guardian. Wine and liquor are sold
every day of the year. Be warned: The
authorities are very strict about drunk-
driving laws. If convicted, you face a stiff
fine and a possible prison term of two
months to two years.
Lost Property
Paris’s Prefecture of Police runs the cen-
tral Lost and Found, Objets Trouvés, 36 rue
des Morillons, 15e (% 08-21-00-25-25
[.10/20¢ per minute]; Métro: Convention),
at the corner of rue de Dantzig. The office
is open Monday to Thursday 8:30 a.m. to 
5 p.m. and Friday 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
(except in July and Aug). For Lost and
Found on the métro, call:
Gare de Lyon: 01-53-33-67-22
Gare Montparnasse: 01-40-48-14-24
Gare Saint-Lazare: 01-53-42-05-57
Gare de l’Est: 01-40-18-88-73
Gare d’Austerlitz: 01-53-60-71-98
Gare du Nord: 01-55-31-58-40
Luggage Storage
Most hotels will store luggage for you for
free, and that’s your best bet, especially
when you plan to return to Paris after a
tour of the provinces.
Maps
Maps printed by the department stores are
usually available free at hotels, and they’re
good for those visiting Paris for only a few
days and hitting only the major attractions.
But if you plan to really explore all the
nooks and crannies of the city, the best
maps are those of the Plan de Paris par
Arrondissement, pocket-sized books with
maps and a street index, available at most
bookstores. They’re extremely practical,
and prices start at around 9 ($14). You
can find them in Paris bookstores, at the
Target-like chain store, Monoprix (there is
one in nearly every Paris arrondissement),
bookstores, and presse stores (large ver-
sions of newsstands). Most Parisians carry
a copy because they too get lost at times.
Newspapers and Magazines
Paris has a terrific events/nightlife/sight-
seeing weekly, called Pariscope (www.
pariscope.fr), sold at every news-
stand for .40 (65¢). A competitor is
L’Officiel des Spectacles, costing a mere
.35 (55¢). You may also want to pick up
the free English-language Paris Voice
(www.parisvoice.com), which is
widely available at hotels and English-
speaking venues.
Pharmacies
See “Drugstores.”
Paris For Dummies, 5th Edition 
338

Police
Dial % 17 in emergencies; otherwise, call
% 01-53-71-53-71.
Post Office
Large post offices are normally open
weekdays from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., Saturday
from 9 a.m. to noon; small post offices may
have shorter hours. Many post offices
(look for the bright yellow signs) are scat-
tered around the city; ask anybody for the
nearest one. Airmail letters and postcards
to the United States cost .85 ($1.35);
within Europe .65 ($1.05); and to Australia
or New Zealand, .85 ($1.35).
The city’s main post office is at 52 rue du
Louvre, 1er (% 01-40-28-76-00; Métro:
Louvre-Rivoli). It’s open 24 hours a day for
urgent mail, telegrams, and telephone
calls.
Restrooms
Public restrooms are plentiful, but you usu-
ally have to pay for them. Every cafe has a
restroom, but it’s supposed to be for cus-
tomers only. The best plan is to ask to use
the telephone; it’s usually next to the toi-
lette. Street-side toilets, which are auto-
matically flushed out and cleaned after
every use, were converted to free in 2006.
Some métro stations have serviced rest-
rooms; you’re expected to tip the attendant
.50 (80¢).
Safety
Paris is a relatively safe city; your biggest
risks are pickpockets and purse snatchers,
so be particularly attentive in museum
lines, popular shopping areas, around
tourist attractions, on the métro, and on
crowded buses (especially in the confu-
sion of getting on and off). Popular pick-
pocket tactics include someone asking you
for directions or bumping into you while an
accomplice takes your wallet, and bands
of children surrounding and distracting you
and then making off with purchases and/or
your wallet.
Women need to be on guard in crowded
tourist areas and on the métro against
overly friendly men who seem to have
made a specialty out of bothering unsus-
pecting female tourists. Tricks include
asking your name and nationality and then
taking advantage of your politeness by
sticking like a burr to you for the rest of the
day. They’re usually more harassing than
harmful, but if you’re too nice, you may be
stuck spending time with someone with
whom you prefer not to. A simple laissez-
moi tranquille (lay-say mwa tran-keel;
leave me alone) usually works.
Smoking
Paris restaurants and cafes are smoke-
free with smoking sections often set up
outside.
Taxes
Watch out: You can get burned. As a
member of the European Community,
France routinely imposes a standard 19.6
percent value-added tax (VAT) on many
goods and services. The tax on merchan-
dise applies to clothing, appliances, liquor,
leather goods, shoes, furs, jewelry, per-
fume, cameras, and even caviar. You can
get a rebate — usually 12 percent — on
certain goods and merchandise, but not on
services. The minimum purchase, depend-
ing on the store, is 180 ($288) in the same
store for nationals or residents of countries
outside the European Union. Chapter 12 has
more on VAT and how to deal with it.
Taxis
Because cabs in Paris are scarce picking
up one at a stand may be easier than hail-
ing one in the street. Be careful to check
the meter when you board to be sure
you’re not also paying the previous pas-
senger’s fare, and if your taxi lacks a
Appendix A: Quick Concierge 339

meter, make sure to settle the cost of the
trip before setting out. Calling a cab to pick
you up is more expensive because the
meter starts running when the cab
receives the call, but if you need to do it,
call Alpha Taxis (% 01-53-60-63-50).
The initial fare for up to three passengers
is 2.20 ($3.50) and rises .85 ($1.35) for
each kilometer between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m.
Between 5 p.m. and 10 a.m., the standing
charge remains the same, but the per-
kilometer charge rises to 1.10 ($1.80). An
additional fee of 1 ($1.60) is imposed for
luggage weighing more than 5kg (11 lb.) or
for an extra bag. A fourth passenger incurs
a 2.85 ($4.55) charge.
Telephone/Telex/Fax
Public phone booths in Paris seem to be
going the way of the dinosaur since the
advent of cellphones. You might find a
coin-operated phone in a cafe or restau-
rant, but most public phone booths are
equipped to take cartes à puces (European
credit cards or other cards with a
microchip that are inserted directly into
the phone) or cartes à code that have a
code you enter into the phone before dial-
ing a number. Those without a cellphone
find cartes à code the most convenient
because you can use the card on the
phone in your hotel. Cartes à code start at
7.50 ($12) for about an hour’s worth of
phone access and increase in price. You
can buy them at any tabac. For directory
assistance, dial % 12. To make interna-
tional calls, dial % 00 (double zero) to
access international lines.
To charge your call to a calling card or call
collect, dial AT&T at % 0-800-99-0011;
MCI at % 0-800-99-0019; or Sprint at % 0-
800-99-0087. To call the United States
direct from Paris, dial 00 (wait for the dial
tone), and then dial 1 followed by the area
code and number.
For placing international calls from France,
dial 00 and then the country code (for the
United States and Canada, 1; for Britain,
44; for Ireland, 353; for Australia, 61; for
New Zealand, 64), then the area or city
code, and then the local number (for exam-
ple, to call New York, dial 00 + 1 + 212 +
000-0000). To place a collect call to North
America, dial % 00-33-11, and an English-
speaking operator will assist you. Dial 
% 00-00-11 for an American AT&T opera-
tor; MCI % 0800-99-00-19; and Sprint 
% 0800-99-00-87.
For calling from Paris to anywhere else in
France (the provinces, in other words, or
province), the country is divided into five
zones with prefixes beginning 01, 02, 03, 04,
and 05; check a phone directory for the
code of the city you’re calling.
If you’re calling France from the United
States, the number you dial probably looks
something like this: 011-33-(0)1-00-00-00-00.
You must first dial the international prefix,
011; and then the country code for France
(33); followed by city code and the rest of
the number. When dialing from outside
France, leave off the 0, which is often indi-
cated in parentheses, in the city code.
Avoid making phone calls from your hotel
room; many hotels charge at least .75
(90¢) for local calls, and the markup on
international calls can be staggering.
You can send telex and fax messages at
the main post office in each arrondisse-
ment of Paris, but asking at your hotel or
going to a neighborhood printer or copy
shop is often cheaper.
Time Zone
Paris is six hours ahead of Eastern
Standard Time; noon in New York is 6 p.m.
in Paris.
Paris For Dummies, 5th Edition 
340

Tipping
The custom is to tip the bellhop about 1
coin per bag, more in expensive (splurge)
hotels. If you have a lot of luggage, tip a bit
more. Don’t tip housekeepers unless you
do something that requires extra work. Tip
a few euro if a reception staff member per-
forms extra services.
Although your addition (restaurant bill) or
fiche (cafe check) bears the words service
compris (service charge included), always
leave a small tip. Generally, 5 percent is
considered acceptable.
Taxi drivers appreciate a tip of .50 to 1
(80¢–$1.60) or whatever it costs to round
up the fare to the next euro. On longer
journeys, when the fare exceeds 20 ($32),
a 5 percent to 10 percent tip is appropriate.
At the theater and cinema, tip 1 ($1.60) if
an usher shows you to your seat. In public
toilets, a fee for using the facilities often is
posted. If not, the maintenance person will
expect a tip of 1 ($1.60). Put it in the
basket or on the plate at the entrance.
Porters and cloakroom attendants are usu-
ally governed by set prices, which are dis-
played. If not, give a porter 1 ($1.60) per
suitcase, and a cloakroom attendant .50
(80¢) per coat.
Transit Info
When taking a train on the national train
system, you must validate your train ticket
in the orange ticket composteur on the
platform or pay a fine. For information in
English about Paris subways and buses
(RATP) call % 08-92-68-41-14.
Water
Tap water in Paris is perfectly safe, but if
you’re prone to stomach problems, you
may prefer to drink mineral water.

Appendix B
A Glossary of French 
Words and Phrases
W
hy La Tour Eiffel but Le Tour de France? Why un cabinet but une
cabine? Simply put, in French and other Romance languages,
nouns are assigned a gender. The article preceding the noun, such as le
and la (which mean the) and un and une (which mean a or one), corre-
sponds to that gender. La and une are feminine; le and un are masculine.
Plural nouns are preceded by les. An extra letter is also added to the noun
itself to signify feminine gender. So Brian Williams is un journalist, but
Katie Couric is une journaliste. French schoolchildren spend years memo-
rizing the gender of nouns; fortunately no one expects you to do the same!
