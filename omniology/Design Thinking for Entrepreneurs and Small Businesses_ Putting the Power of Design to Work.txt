Introduction  
to Design 
Thinking
Combining Creativity and Analysis in Business
In the past couple of years, the term design has been thrown around quite 
a bit in various business contexts. We’ve heard of user design, experience 
design, social design, integrated design, service design, and place-based 
design, in addition to the term with which we are most familiar: graphic 
design.
Although design was once the sole domain of graphic designers—those 
professionals with the artistic skill to create logos, advertisements, signage, 
and printed materials of all sorts—you can now find a plethora of profes-
sionals in other industries describing themselves as designers. Depending 
on how they approach their work, the term designer might be quite appli-
cable, and here is why:
Design in its current use in business vernacular describes a data-
driven, purposeful intent behind an action, and that intent occurs to 
affect a specific, measurable business outcome.
If you approach your business with this kind of intent, regardless of its 
industry, size, age, niche within the marketplace, or geographic location 
(or lack thereof for online-only enterprises), then you, too, are a designer.

If you can begin to think like a designer and learn some of the tools 
designers use regularly to drive growth and success, then myriad doors of 
possibility will open.
■ Note  No matter what kind of business you’re in, and no matter the size, it will be of benefit 
when you and your fellow employees consider yourself designers. It’s a useful—and profitable—
way to plan and execute your initiatives.
What Is Design Thinking?
Do an Internet search of “design thinking” through your favorite search 
tool, and you’ll turn up an absurd number of results (several hundred 
thousand at the time of this writing). In the simplest of terms, design 
thinking is an exploratory approach to problem solving that includes and 
balances both analytical and creative thought processes.
Tim Brown, CEO of IDEO, a renowned design and innovation firm, and 
arguably the first champion of design thinking in business, wrote this of 
design thinking in Change By Design: “Insofar as it is open-ended, open-
minded and iterative, a process fed by design thinking will feel chaotic to 
those experiencing it for the first time.”1
No truer words have been written about design thinking. It will feel chaotic 
the first time, and probably the second and third times, and maybe even the 
fourth time you put it to use. Design thinking is not a typical skill set learned 
in business school, but a valuable skill that should be embraced by all business 
professionals, not just those in a “creative” industry or for whom design is 
front-and-center in their job description. Design thinking is an egalitarian skill 
set that can be learned, practiced, and championed by professionals across 
industries and job titles.
Design thinking is largely nonlinear and fluid, as most explorations are—or 
at least should be. A true exploration is not a forced march between Point 
A and Point B, but a meandering trail that ends at the defined destination 
of Point B yet allows for the flexibility to observe the landscape along the 
way and, perhaps, discover something new or previously overlooked. The 
circuitous nature of design thinking does not derive from a designer’s lack 
of the discipline needed to be organized and deliberate. Much to the con-
trary, design thinking is purposefully intended to be circuitous and fluid as 
a challenge to the conventional means of problem solving.

We are experienced in (and some may argue trained in) asking, “What’s 
next?” when working toward solving a problem. (I blame algebra and its 
necessarily rigid adherence to a sequential order in problem solving.) In 
design thinking, there isn’t always a specific “next” to which we should 
proceed. Each phase of design thinking could yield multiple “nexts” as 
possibilities, and it is up to us—the design thinking team—to deter-
mine which “next” to pursue. Admittedly, this can be a little confusing 
at first.
Perhaps most important, design thinking is an iterative and rapid process 
that can be applied to even the most confounding business challenges, and 
it is a strategic activity that will identify clear opportunities that you can act 
on quickly.
The Phases of Design Thinking
Given design thinking’s adaptable, flowing nature, no one can truly say with 
strong conviction, “This is the way design thinking happens.” There are 
defined phases in the approach that serve as excellent signposts indicating 
you are making progress. However, the work that happens within each 
phase can vary wildly depending on the challenge at hand.
Let’s begin with a high-level review of the phases of design thinking, after 
which we’ll dive deeper into each to better understand what happens and 
how it fits into the bigger design-thinking picture.
Phase I: Understand
Understanding your business challenge is imperative 
to identifying and creating a solution, and the degree 
of understanding goes well beyond that of conjec-
ture or your previous history with challenges of a 
similar nature.
Phase II: Define
Once you understand the challenge at a level of 
detail that reveals subtle nuances you likely would 
have missed without taking the time to develop that 
understanding, you can clearly define in specific 
terms what the challenge is and why it needs to 
be addressed.
Understand
Define

Phase III: Ideate
Now that the challenge is defined and you 
know what problem needs to be solved, you can 
unleash your creativity and begin imagining solu-
tions. Ideation is by far the phase that everyone 
enjoys most, and because of that, many teams get 
bogged down here. Teams are also tempted to 
jump ahead to this phase, completely forgoing 
Understand and Define. Avoid both tendencies at all costs, or you 
very likely will generate a wealth of fantastic ideas that aren’t relevant 
to the challenge or go off on fantastic tangents.
Phase IV: Prototype
Once you draw the ideation phase to a close, the 
next step is to cull through the idea inventory and 
select the cream of the crop. These are the ideas 
you’ll take into the prototype phase. Be judicious in 
your selection of ideas—specifically the quantity of 
them—because you will need to create a prototype 
of each one. As a good rule of thumb, you’ll want to 
plan on prototyping at least two or three ideas. Prototyping will start to 
give your ideas depth, so you can get an impression of how they will take 
form in reality. Prototypes aren’t always tangible items. It is just as impor-
tant to prototype a service, experience, process, or other intangible.
Note

  In design thinking, you prototype not just products but also services, experiences, 
processes, and other things most would consider intangible.
Phase V: Test
Testing will help you save money during development and avoid potential 
disaster. This sounds dramatic, but it’s true. Testing 
will keep you from committing resources to a project 
only to find out that you were on the wrong path. The 
upside is that testing doesn’t have to be complicated 
or expensive.

There you have it: design thinking, a process of only five phases. What 
is critically important to understand about design thinking is that 
the process does not always consist of a direct line from Point A to 
Point B through the phases. As you work through the process, you 
may find you need to back up and repeat a phase. For example, you 
could find that in the Define phase, you don’t have quite enough data 
to help you clearly articulate the challenge you’re facing, and there-
fore you need to go back to the Understand phase and do a bit more 
research. Or you could discover in the Prototype phase that one  
(or more) of your ideas can’t be constructed as you had hoped, and you 
need to Ideate some more. You could even discover in the Test phase 
that your prototypes all bombed, and you need to start over with the 
Understand phase.
How you move through the design-thinking process is determined largely 
by the quality of your work in each phase. Stay focused on each phase as 
you’re in it, without taking a look at the horizon for the next one. If you 
look too far ahead, you might miss something critical.
A Deeper Dive
Now that you’ve waded into the water and have a better understanding of 
design thinking, it is time to take off the floaties and dive in to get a more  
in-depth grasp of each phase of the process.
Understand
Creating a solution to your business challenge is next to impossible with-
out some clear understanding of what your challenge entails. The nature 
of the challenge may appear to be one thing on the surface and something 
else entirely once you peel back the visible layers. Consider this example: 
a local hospital has seen its share of births decline since a competing facil-
ity opened nearby. The new facility offers a few distinct patient benefits, 
such as advanced security and a catered dinner in-room for the new par-
ents, which the local hospital doesn’t offer. The local hospital leadership 
believes those benefits at the competing facility are luring patients away 
from their hospital.
On the surface, that scenario seems plausible, and the local hospital lead-
ership makes plans to counter the competitor’s benefits with some new 
ones of their own, such as an easier admission process and limo service 
for parents to take their babies home. A competitive environment with 
more options and benefits for the patient seems like a smart business 
move, right?

Chapter 1 | Introduction to Design Thinking 
6
How does the local hospital leadership know that their new benefits will 
sway a patient’s choice? Have they talked to their prospective patient 
group? Have they asked expectant parents what services and benefits 
they want from a hospital, and which are most important to them? Have 
they asked new ­parents why they chose the hospital where their child 
was born?
Rather than rushing to judgment and adding benefits as the answer, the 
local hospital leadership needs to take the time to understand their 
potential patients’ needs and wants. How can middle-aged men under-
stand what the twenty- and thirty-something expectant moms need and 
want in a hospital? The best way to do that is through research, which I 
cover more extensively in Chapter 2.
More often than not, especially when revenue is on the line and a busi-
ness’s key performance indicators are watched very closely by investors 
and other stakeholders, leadership will make a decision based on their 
past experience in the industry, a measured guess based on market trends, 
their gut instinct, or a combination of all three, when what is needed most 
is accurate data derived from research. Although taking the time to do 
the research during the Understand phase cannot guarantee a better per-
formance than going with your gut, it will give you a much stronger and 
more accurate foundation from which to make decisions and will give you 
more confidence that the decisions you make are the best options.
Define
At the conclusion of the Understand phase, you should have a fair amount 
of data, both quantitative (think numbers, scaled responses, answers that 
can be measured) and qualitative (typically responses to open-ended 
questions). The quantity of data is completely dependent on the extent of 
your research and the nature of your industry. At a minimum, you need 
enough data for developing a comprehensive assessment of the situation 
or challenge at hand.
From that assessment, you can define the specific business challenge you 
face. Continuing our example of the local hospital, let’s say the assessment 
of the research data reveals that the patients going to the competitor facil-
ity aren’t choosing to give birth there because of its benefits but because 
it offers a more advanced level of neonatal care, which calms expectant 
moms’ fears of possible health complications for the baby during birth.
That’s the “a ha!” moment for the local hospital leadership.

The opportunity to change patient behavior and regain market share lies 
not in creating additional benefits for new parents. The opportunity lies 
in ­making appropriate investments in talent and technology to develop 
a ­neonatal unit. The business challenge defined becomes: “Design an 
advanced-care ­neonatal unit for the local hospital and allocate the funds 
needed to develop the unit to be competitive in the market.” That’s quite 
a bit different from how the business challenge for the local hospital might 
have been defined if the Understand phase was bypassed.
Ideate
As mentioned earlier, this is the phase that people enjoy most. With 
the challenge defined, now is the time to dream up how to solve it. 
Brainstorming, another name for ideating, dominates this phase of design 
thinking. To get the most out of brainstorming, you truly need to suspend 
reality, disregard the typical parameters for business operations, check 
your ego at the door, and repeat to yourself, “There are no bad ideas.”
Be very deliberate in identifying the individuals you want to be on your 
brainstorming team. The nature of your business challenge will help dic-
tate who those people are. Your goal here is a heterogeneous group built 
around a core of individuals that closely resembles your target market 
through ­demographics and psychographics. Diversity is your friend. Don’t 
default to including only your senior leadership or subject matter experts 
during the Ideate phase. Branch out and include a mix of employees from 
various levels in the organization, including someone from operations, 
who will lend a broad perspective. You may consider inviting trusted ven-
dors, thought partners, and even friends and family members to join you 
to offer an outsider’s viewpoint, as well. Entrepreneurs might consider 
including funding partners.
Although diversity in your brainstorming group is important, the num-
ber of people involved is equally important. You need enough to create 
some enthusiasm and provide varying viewpoints, but not so many that 
the activities get unwieldy or warring factions of opinions arise. I prefer 
groups of no fewer than three and no more than ten.
Once you have your brainstorming team selected, schedule a two-hour 
block of time in which to brainstorm. You’ll need at least one two-hour 
block and perhaps additional blocks depending on the nature of the chal-
lenge to be solved and the productivity of the group. Remember, you will 
need to prototype at least two solid ideas for testing, so don’t get caught 
up on one great idea and decide you’re done. Keep exploring the chal-
lenge from all angles.

■ Tip  While there are no bad ideas during the Ideate phase, they can sometimes be off 
topic. Honor those off-topic ideas by documenting them in a “parking lot” area to hold for future 
consideration.
Brainstorming or ideation sessions can easily go off the rails and disintegrate 
into wasted time and occasionally hurt feelings. Here are five key rules to 
keep your group on track, productive, and positive.
1.	 Declare your intention: Under no circumstances 
should you enter a brainstorming session without a 
clearly articulated intent of what you aim to get out 
of it, and be sure to communicate that to your group 
ahead of time. You want everyone participating to 
be working toward the same goal in a brainstorming 
session. By communicating your intent ahead of time, 
you prime the pump, so to speak, and your team will 
likely spend some time thinking about your challenge 
in advance of the session.
2.	 Everyone is equal: In the real world—the one 
­outside of the brainstorming session—the president 
of the ­company carries more weight than an account-
ing assistant. During brainstorming, everyone is equal 
regardless of his or her role in the company or place 
in the hierarchy. There is no seniority, and the only 
authority in the room is the one chosen to be the 
moderator. Everyone is free to speak, and everyone 
is obliged to listen to the speaker. Period.
3.	 All things in moderation: Prior to the session, select 
someone to be the moderator. This person should 
be adept at facilitating conversations, asking pertinent 
questions, and documenting what is said or done. This 
person must also be comfortable redirecting the con-
versation if it’s gone off on a tangent, appropriately 
interrupting if someone is dominating the conversa-
tion, and moving the discussion along if it gets bogged 
down in one particular area. Ideally, the moderator you 
choose has no “skin in the game” and therefore no self-
interest in the outcome of the brainstorming. If you can 
afford to contract with an independent moderator or 
facilitator, do so, particularly if you have a headstrong 
group that needs to be guided by a firm and unbiased 
hand.

4. Write it down: Every idea, thought, or question 
needs to be documented. Do not rely on anyone’s 
memory to recall the outcomes from your brain-
storming session. Documentation is key! You’ll want 
to be able to refer to what occurred with accuracy. 
I prefer to document brainstorming sessions in two 
ways: by themselves or combined. The first method 
is with sticky notes. Choose three  colors: one for 
ideas, one for thoughts, and one for questions.  
Each idea, thought, or question gets written on its own 
color-coded note. I repeat, each gets its own note. You 
may want to sort these later, and if you have to cut 
a sticky-note in half because it contained two sepa-
rate ideas, it’s likely the halves will get lost. The sec-
ond method is to document the discussion on a white 
board, but again assign a different color to each state-
ment category (idea, thought, question). Be sure you 
photograph the white board before erasing it. Every 
cell phone has a camera; use it. In fact, have several 
people take several pictures as a precaution.
5. Let the sillies out: Whether your group is experi-
enced brainstormers or new to the activity, they will 
inevitably feel a bit awkward at the beginning, and that 
usually leads to a case of the sillies: outlandish ideas 
that contextually make no sense but are contributed 
as a kind of joke to break the ice. That’s normal and 
okay. Just let the sillies flow and get them out of the 
group’s system so they can concentrate on the chal-
lenge at hand. Two things to note: the sillies should 
not be confused with “bad ideas” because there are 
no bad ideas during brainstorming. Second, if you have 
a recurrence of the sillies toward the end of the brain-
storming session, you’ve run too long and it’s time to 
wrap up, even if there is still time left on the clock.
Tying back into our neonatal unit example, your group may have ideas 
ranging anywhere from developing its own unit to collaborating with 
another provider to supplementing its own services to tapping into 
emerging technology to fill the gap.

Prototype
At the end of brainstorming, you likely have a slew of ideas occupying 
space along the continuum from “awesome” to "what the hell were we 
thinking?" You may be a bit overwhelmed with the volume of ideas and 
struggling to sift the chaff from the most delightful morsels. This is where 
the Prototype phase begins, and you start to see its value.
Once you’re finished with the Ideate phase and have moved into the 
Prototype phase, it’s time to put the business operations parameters back 
into play and view your ideas through the lens of reality. In doing so, you 
can begin to separate your brainstorming ideas into categories of what is 
doable, what is possible, and what is so far-reaching that it will require too 
many resources to pull off.
■ Tip  After you’ve sorted the ideas from the Ideation phase, pack up the notes about 
the far-reaching ones and save them. You never know when they might trigger other ideas 
down the road or evolve into possibilities.
Now that you’ve organized your ideas, meet with your operations team 
or leader and take a close look at which ideas are the most viable to try 
given your current state of resources—capital, time, and talent—and which 
could make the greatest positive impact toward solving your business chal-
lenge. Where these factors overlap is where the opportunity lies.
Visually, this looks like a Venn diagram (Figure 1-1).
Understand
Figure 1-1. Where your available resources, doable ideas, and potential impact overlap 
is the “sweet spot,” the area in which your opportunities lie.

Design Thinking for Entrepreneurs and Small Businesses
11
The ideas that lie in the sweet spot should be the ones for which proto-
types are developed. Wondering what you should do if there aren’t any 
ideas in the sweet spot? Go back to the Ideate phase and brainstorm 
some more.
Ideally, you will have two or three ideas in the sweet spot. Trying to pro-
totype any more than that will get to be overwhelming and potentially 
costly. To start building your prototypes, select the idea that you think will 
require the least amount of resources to be a starting point. It will ease 
you into the prototype process and is more likely to be a successful and 
enjoyable activity for your team.
Remember, it doesn’t matter if the idea you are prototyping is a material 
object, a process, or an experience. It still needs to be fleshed out to a 
point that it can undergo enough viable testing to prove that it works and 
has the potential to succeed.
Returning to the earlier example of the local hospital that needs to design 
a neonatal care unit to better compete in its market, the Prototype phase 
could include a physical mock-up of an actual department, with furniture 
and equipment, in a repurposed existing space within the hospital. There 
may be a prototype of new construction needed to create the neonatal 
care unit. Or perhaps there is a technology solution, such as remote patient 
monitoring and high-risk protocols, that can be introduced through new 
workflows and collaborations that need to be prototyped.
Give the prototypes as much detail and specificity as possible. When you 
enter the Test phase, you’ll want to have as complete a prototype as pos-
sible so that your test subjects aren’t put in the position of providing 
feedback based on conjecture.
Test
Now that you have at least two prototypes developed, it’s time for the 
Test phase. Frankly, my blood pressure goes up any time I hear the word 
test, but that’s an illogical response with this type of test. Testing proto-
types keeps you from charging down the wrong path, and spending way 
too much money and other resources on a potential solution only to dis-
cover that it doesn’t work like it should. Testing is a good thing.
Testing can be easy and inexpensive, which is also a good thing. How 
to test your prototype depends on what it is. We’ll cover this in more 
specificity in the chapters ahead, but we touch on the common elements 
of testing here.
Your testing participants should mirror the users for whom the solution 
will remedy the business challenge, and should include key stakeholder 

Chapter 1 | Introduction to Design Thinking 
12
groups who are affected by the implementation of the solution. In the 
local hospital example, the testing participants could include expectant 
mothers, obstetricians, neonatologists, nurses, respiratory therapists, and 
facility operations staff—perhaps even mothers of children born in neo-
natal care units in other hospitals. Gathering feedback from different users 
and stakeholders will yield an array of perspectives.
Testing is one area in which diversity needs to be controlled. Although you 
may be testing your ideas among various groups, you will want to organize 
your testing participants by type—nurses with nurses, and so on—to get 
the most out of the activity. By keeping like participants together, you 
can capitalize on their shared knowledge and perspective, which will help 
keep the testing time shorter and the feedback focused. This will improve 
the likelihood that they will suggest modifications to the idea.
■ Tip  Make sure your testing participants are the types of customers who would use your 
product or service. If your service is designed for nurses, don’t test the service on teachers.
How do you find testing participants? Start in your own back yard with 
your contact list and just ask. You’ll be surprised by their willingness to 
help. However, you may need participants with very specific demographics, 
like a nurse with more than five years of experience working in a hospital 
­environment. In that case, you can still recruit through your own network 
by asking your contacts to forward your need on to others they may 
know. You can also recruit through Craigslist, use Facebook advertising 
(which is very affordable), or ­network through professional associations. 
If there isn’t a conflict of interest, you could approach another business 
entity—such as a hospital system for our nurse example—and uncover 
opportunities to ­communicate with and recruit their employees.
Regardless of who your participants are or what you test, the participants 
need to sign a nondisclosure agreement and a noncompete agreement 
prior to any discussions of or interactions with your product, service, or 
process. They also should be made aware that the testing sessions prob-
ably will be documented with audio and video recording for research 
purposes only. If a participant refuses to sign the agreements or does not 
want to be recorded, I strongly recommend they be excused from the 
Test phase. When the agreements are signed and complete, you need to 
give the participants an appropriate overview of the context prior to any 
testing. Using the local hospital example, it would be critical to explain to 
the participants the challenge the administration is trying to solve and the 
solution the prototype represents. Then the participants will be prepared 
to provide meaningful feedback.

Although testing can be done inexpensively, do not skimp on providing food 
and beverages. This is not only hospitable and appropriate but also a strategic  
maneuver to encourage the group to relax and feel welcome. You may also 
consider offering modest cash compensation. Although not required, it is 
a smart consideration if the product, service, or process you are testing is  
complicated, requires a great deal of input or effort on the participant’s 
part, or if recruiting participants becomes difficult.
Keep the testing atmosphere light and relaxed. You want your partici-
pants to feel welcomed, comfortable, and valued, and you want to portray 
yourself and your team as welcoming, open-minded, and collaborative. 
The location of testing is again dependent on what you are testing. We 
are all familiar with the stereotypical focus group room with one-way 
glass, on the other side of which sits the client and his or her entourage 
observing the testing. Those facilities can be found—and rented—in most 
large cities. However, that kind of formality and expense is far from neces-
sary. More common locations are on the business’s premises, in an online 
environment, and in the field, particularly if your means of testing does not 
include focus groups.
As was important during the Ideate phase, documentation is critical in the 
Test phase. You will want to refer back to what was shared by the participants 
with accuracy, because their feedback will affect directly the future devel-
opment of your product, service, or process. During the Test phase, I highly 
recommend the use of an impartial moderator or facilitator, as well as both 
written documentation of the testing process and outcomes, and audio/video 
documentation. As a general rule, once I start recording a testing session,  
I remind participants that the session is being recorded for documenta-
tion only to assist with reporting on the testing outcomes.
Selecting one prototype from our neonatal unit example, new construc-
tion of a unit, one testing scenario might consist of participants play-
ing their specific roles—expectant mom, nurse, administrative assistant, 
physician—as they “walk through” the construction mock-up and narrate 
their experience. Expectant moms would give input on what they like and 
what they don’t like about the check-in process, what they think is miss-
ing in the labor and delivery room that would improve the experience, 
and what amenities you may have included that don’t make an impact. 
Physicians and nurses would provide feedback on their experiences as 
well, but because their points of view are entirely different, you’ll get dif-
ferent data.
With testing, you are aiming to uncover insights from all users that would 
culminate in creating a neonatal care unit that satisfies their needs and 
wants, while at the same time providing a solution to your business chal-
lenge, with the specific purpose of shifting market share your way.

Chapter 1 | Introduction to Design Thinking 
14
Once your stakeholder groups have tested the product, service, or pro-
cess, gather all of your documentation, give your left brain a jolt, and get 
ready to analyze the results. It’s not as hard as it sounds, really. This kind 
of analysis involves a lot of compare-and-contrast activity. First, review 
the data from each stakeholder group on its own merit. Look for com-
mon themes in participants’ comments, reactions, and suggestions. If you 
included audio/video documentation, look for common themes in partici-
pants’ facial expressions and other nonverbal cues, particularly in response 
to a moderator’s questions or as correlated with a specific action as part 
of the test.
Then look across the stakeholder groups, comparing the common themes 
you documented during individual group analysis. Themes that are shared 
across user groups indicate a more universal concern with the prod-
uct, service, or process, and you’ll need to pay close attention to those, 
because they will affect your work on a larger scale. Themes unique to a 
stakeholder group may indicate a specific need that should be addressed, 
but not necessarily with the product, service, or process you are currently 
testing.
You will follow the same analysis for each of the prototypes you tested.  
(Are you getting a better understanding of why I recommend limiting 
your prototypes to only two or three?) Once the analysis is complete for 
each prototype, you want to pull back and look at the whole picture by 
comparing the prototypes to one another. Common themes will indicate 
areas that need to be remedied regardless of which prototype moves 
forward to production, so acknowledge those but don’t spend too much 
time on them at this point.
Look for the themes unique to a specific prototype and consider their impor-
tance to developing a successful solution to your challenge. If one theme 
is perceived to be more critical than others—perhaps because your most 
important stakeholder group identified the theme—compare its needs to 
your available resources. Can you allocate resources appropriately to satisfy  
the theme’s needs and therefore improve the chances of success for the 
product, service, or process? Conversely, are there several themes that 
will require smaller investments but collectively yield a bigger effect and 
potential for success?
By the end of the Test phase, there is a lot of data, some lingering questions, 
and a bit of gut instinct. However, there are no right answers. The only “right” 
answers are those derived from that data and those that you determine to be 
the best for accomplishing your business’s goals. Gather your team and review 
the testing results. Did they prove or disprove the basic premise that one  
(or more) of the solutions you presented for testing actually will solve the 
business challenge you face? Did one solution perform better than others, 
or did they all test well? Did they all fall far below expectations?

If none of the solutions tested performed well, you need to stop and take 
a hard look to determine why. Answering the “why” will help you deter-
mine to what point in the design-thinking process you need to return. 
Some questions to ask: Did you have the appropriate testing participants, 
and did you provide them with relevant context? Were the prototypes 
understandable, and did they align with the testing parameters? Were the 
potential solutions strong enough, or do more ideas need to be generated?  
Is it possible that the business challenge wasn’t defined clearly enough?
Backing up in the design-thinking process is frustrating, but it doesn’t need 
to be disheartening. No one gets the solution correct the first time, every 
time. Consider this: prior to the design-thinking process, your arsenal of 
weapons for solving a business challenge consisted of gut instinct, assump-
tions, and a modest amount of data. At the end of the design thinking 
process, you have nearly the opposite—a lot of data, clarity of purpose, 
and a little bit of gut instinct to add some flavor.
Summary
We started our review of design thinking at the 30,000-foot level, and 
then dove deeper into its five distinct phases: Understand, Define, Ideate, 
Prototype, and Test. We reviewed the importance of understanding what 
your business challenge truly entails. We covered how to specifically 
define the business challenge so you can ideate with purpose. And we 
discussed the need for prototypes and testing to help ensure that you are 
on a path toward a viable business solution.
You may feel as though you’re drinking from a fire hose; this is a lot of 
information to consume at once. Furthermore, I’m asking you to internal-
ize this information using a way of thinking with which you may not yet be 
comfortable. If you are feeling unsure about how to proceed with design 
thinking, don’t worry. It’s normal, and I’ve been there. As with any new 
undertaking, practice and familiarity will lead to confidence.
The following chapters will explain how to implement design thinking in 
specific business scenarios, with examples and special tips to help you 
integrate it into your own business. By the end, you will know yourself to 
be a designer.

The Role of  
Research in  
Design Thinking
Don’t Assume: Ask!
Data can be intimidating, elusive, and enlightening. Obtaining it, specifi-
cally taking the time to conduct meaningful research, can seem like an 
obstacle to progress. It’s not. Research facilitates progress’s emergence 
from the primordial soup of data so it can begin to take shape and form 
a solution.
When faced with a business challenge and using design thinking to help 
develop a solution to the challenge, you need research.
Your initial reaction is probably one or more of these three:
I don’t have time for research.
• 
I don’t have the budget for research.
• 
I don’t have the patience for research.
• 
Sadly, most small businesses and entrepreneurs will skimp on research 
when time and budget are perceived issues. In this chapter, I demonstrate 
that you do have the time, budget, and patience for research, and that 
research is an absolute imperative in design thinking to keep you from 
chasing rabbits down trails that lead to nowhere.

Design Thinking Research Is Different
Research in the design thinking context is not the static search we 
employed during late nights in the library or online hunting for facts to 
support our theses. It is not simply a means to an end. In design thinking 
research is an inquisitive quest for insights and perspectives that con-
stantly evolves and truly has no end. It is purposeful in its pursuit of infor-
mation, and it uses the results to inform business decisions.
Research in design thinking takes the form of asking a question—which 
can be done in numerous ways—and documenting the answer. Research 
doesn’t need to be large-scale quantitative surveys that undergo regressive 
analysis to arrive at actionable answers. (Thank goodness, because how 
many entrepreneurs and small-business owners can conduct regressive 
analysis? Not I.) Nor does design thinking research need involve expensive, 
elaborate, in-depth, long-term qualitative studies.
Note
■
■
  Design thinking research is purposeful, affordable, and actionable. Why assume 
when you can know?
Granted, design thinking research certainly has the capacity to be as elab-
orate as your budget and time will allow. Most notably, it can be inexpen-
sive, simple, and scalable. What it fundamentally cannot be is omitted.
Quantitative versus Qualitative
For our discussion, we classify research into two categories: quantitative 
and qualitative, often referred to as “quant” and “qual.” Each has its own 
strengths and weaknesses; neither is superior to the other. There are 
some business cases in which it is perfectly acceptable to conduct only 
one of the two research categories, but these are few and far between.  
I recommend that you refrain from putting all of your research eggs into 
one category’s basket, because a balanced approach will be more informa-
tive and more likely to reveal a broader scope of opportunity to develop 
solutions to your business challenge. Eschewing one type for the other 
will not save you any time or money, so plan for both.
The “Quant”
Quantitative research is characterized by its focus on measurable data 
that can be extrapolated and applied to a population greater than the one 
tested. It is commonly used to gather demographic data, measure opinion 
4

Design Thinking for Entrepreneurs and Small Businesses

using a predefined scale, and collect customer or user behavioral data. 
Surveys are the poster children of quantitative research because they 
can be constructed, distributed, and evaluated easily. Whether delivered 
online, via telephone, or through regular mail, surveys collect data in 
limited categories using predominantly closed questions. The length of a 
quantitative survey typically is dictated by what data are known currently 
and what data need to be collected to complete the desired data set.
Quantitative data can also be gathered through web analytics (page views, 
original visitors, click-throughs, etc.), point-of-sale software, online polls, 
and customer feedback forms.
The “Qual”
Qualitative research is characterized by its exploratory nature. It is more 
about depth than breadth, and results are not as easily extrapolated to 
larger populations. However, the information collected is rich in a level of 
detail and nuance that isn’t possible in quantitative research. The stereo-
typed image of qualitative data is the focus group. Despite focus groups 
being characterized and parodied in popular media, this interview method is 
valuable because it provides an opportunity for deeper exploration into the 
consumer’s opinions, purchasing behavior, and lifestyle factors that might 
influence that behavior. The nature of the topic being researched will dic-
tate the type and size of group and the demeanor of the interview. If you are 
discussing potty training with a group of young parents, the questions will 
likely be light and humorous and the atmosphere convivial. However, if you 
are discussing financial investments and retirement funds, the questions will 
take a more serious tone, and the atmosphere will likely reflect that.
Other means of gathering qualitative data include one-on-one interviews, 
in-store interceptions (in which a shopper is interrupted briefly to be 
asked questions about their immediate purchasing decisions), and obser-
vation of your potential consumers in their natural habitats.
The Four Roles of Research
Research in design thinking plays the roles of Equalizer, Archeologist, 
Interpreter, and Devil’s Advocate. Research levels the knowledge field 
and puts all of your team members on the same page, understanding your  
business challenge from the same data set. It helps uncover the roots of 
the challenge so you don’t take it simply at face value. It translates the 
needs and wants of the customer into insights on which you can take 
action. It can be the tempered balance to enthusiasm that shines a cau-
tionary light on a solution’s potential flaws.

Chapter 2 | The Role of Research in Design Thinking  
20
The Equalizer
Surveys are the ideal equalizer in design thinking research, because they 
can provide a measured overview of the market, the competitive envi-
ronment, customer demographics, purchasing patterns, and similar broad-
scope views that give the lay of the land. Surveys essentially level the 
playing field for businesses because they can be conducted cheaply and 
quickly and can be quite pointed in their questions.
If you find yourself working in a vacuum with no known data, surveys can 
remedy that situation. You can gather even the most basic of data—like 
customer names. Consider this scenario: you have a new formula for laun-
dry detergent that minimizes environmental impact without sacrificing 
the perceived level of cleanliness that customers expect. You have plenty 
of industry data, and perhaps even consumer data harvested from several 
markets across the country. However, you haven’t launched your product 
yet, so you have zero customer data unique to you. You have a general 
idea of your target customer based on the existing information you gath-
ered, but you want to ask specific questions to discover who among the 
vast universe of people who do laundry in your launch markets would 
choose your new greener, but slightly more expensive product instead of 
their usual choice.
Tip
 
■
 You don’t have to work in a data vacuum. Use surveys to gather even the most basic 
information from customers to jump-start your research.
You can distribute a survey to a population that looks like your gen-
eral target customer and collect data from scratch. That data set might 
include questions about income, family size, geographic region, current 
product preference, frequency of use, purchase behavior, and opinions 
about the environment. Once the data are collected and analyzed, you’ll 
be able to identify the consumer groups most likely to make the switch 
to your product. The outcome could read something like this: “Women 
age thirty to forty-five with children living at home, with an annual house-
hold income of more than $60,000 who buy laundry detergent at least 
once every six to eight weeks, and who are somewhat or very concerned 
about the environment.” You now have a well-defined, specific consumer 
segment—supported by data!—to whom you can begin to market.
Alternatively, you may have some consumer data to work with but need 
more details. For established businesses with modest data capture capa-
bilities, this is common. You may have some customer contact details 
and past purchase history, but not much more. In that case, the scenario 
may look like this: you are an automobile dealer, and during the process 

Design Thinking for Entrepreneurs and Small Businesses
21
of selling a vehicle, you collect age, race, marital status, home ownership 
status, income level, and credit score data. If you accepted a trade-in 
vehicle for the new purchase, you also gathered data on the make, model, 
and year of that vehicle. At this point, you have a fairly detailed picture of 
your customer, but you want to know more.
After the purchase, you distribute a brief survey—via mail or email—that 
asks the customer additional questions about his or her experience at 
your business (a potential indicator of repeat or word-of-mouth referral 
business), what other dealers they visited and/or considered before mak-
ing the purchase (a measurement of who they perceive the company’s 
competitors to be), and how many other vehicles they own (an indicator 
of consumption capacity for this type of purchase).
All of these data are merged with the data collected during the vehicle 
purchase. Combined, it goes into your database of customers, which now 
contains much more robust content to better inform and direct your 
company’s leaders when they begin to explore new business opportuni-
ties or face new challenges.
The Archeologist
Qualitative research, at least in my mind, resembles the romanticized 
image of the archaeologist, that intrepid explorer bent on unearthing hid-
den treasures, truths, and beliefs that can shed light on how and why we 
do what we do as humans and consumers. Think about it: somewhere, 
someone conducted some research among a group of consumers a lot 
like you to determine what type of teapot they would most prefer to 
purchase. Then they used the data from that research to design precisely 
that type of teapot.
I find qualitative research fascinating, highly valuable, and eminently impor-
tant to the design-thinking process. My preferred means of qualitative 
exploration are focus groups and customer intercepts. Those are the 
qualitative research methods we explore next.
Before we jump into the details of how to conduct this type of research, 
it’s good to note that collecting the insights revealed during either of these 
activities are best recorded with video and supplemented with written notes. 
Fortunately, you aren’t recording for a screening at the Sundance Film Festival, 
so the quality of your video doesn’t have to be anything more than compre-
hensible. Using a video app on your smart phone is sufficient. As mentioned 
in the previous chapter, it is imperative to have your participants agree to 
recording their likeness and signing a waiver to that effect. Logistically, getting 
a waiver signed during a customer intercept might be a hassle, but it is always 
better to err on the side of caution and cover your bases.

Chapter 2 | The Role of Research in Design Thinking  
22
Customer Intercepts
Customer intercepts are a quick, somewhat informal way to get brief 
answers to limited questions that are relative to what a customer is doing 
in real time. To conduct these, you truly intercept customers during their 
activity—be it shopping for or using the product or service for which 
you are conducting research. Therefore, the way you approach custom-
ers is critical, as is the brevity of your interaction with them. As you are 
considering the questions you want to ask customers and the way you 
will approach them, put yourself in their shoes. Construct the intercept 
in such a way that if you were the customer, you would willingly answer a 
few questions posed by a stranger.
Because our culture propagates a distrust of strangers, your countenance 
and body language are important in getting a response. Your actions 
speak louder than words here. For successful customer intercepts, the 
interviewer should be open, friendly, curious, approachable, and some-
what extroverted without coming across as overbearing or obnoxious.  
I encourage senior leadership to conduct interviews when possible, as they 
get the opportunity to hear the customer feedback firsthand. However, 
anyone on your team who matches this description would be a good 
choice as an interviewer.
Before conducting any intercepts, determine the questions for which you 
need answers. You’ll want to identify no more than two main questions, with 
a follow-up question for each. That’s it—short and sweet. You should also 
think through questions that might be asked of you by the customer and 
formulate your answers. If your interviewer is not involved with determining 
the questions, be sure he or she understands what information you want to 
glean from this process so they are well informed going into the activity.
Next, determine where these intercepts will happen. For locations any-
where other than your own place of business, you’ll need to secure per-
mission from the appropriate people, like store managers. If you plan to 
conduct your intercepts in public spaces, take the time to investigate 
whether you need permits or permission from local authorities. Once 
you have your location, schedule dates and times during which you are 
most likely to encounter the type of customers you want to interview. 
Don’t just go to where your customers are, go when they are there.
Let’s illustrate all of this customer intercept information with an example.
You operate a small business that provides locally produced, 
artisanal cheese using milk from grass-fed, free-ranging goats on 
your small farm just outside of the city. Your cheese is distributed 
through a regional grocery retailer and is shelved alongside three 
national brands and two other local brands. You want to conduct 

Design Thinking for Entrepreneurs and Small Businesses
23
customer intercepts to better understand the decision-making 
process buyers go through when selecting goat cheese. Your 
interviewer is placed near enough to the cheese case to be able 
to see what cheese is selected but not so close that he or she is 
obtrusive. Once a customer selects a package of goat cheese—
regardless of the brand selected—your interviewer will then 
approach him or her. She should introduce herself and indicate 
that she is interviewing customers about their preferences in 
cheese. She should not share the brand of the cheese for which 
she is conducting the interviews unless specifically asked by the 
customer. Sharing that information up front could influence the 
customer’s answers, as most people do not want speak ill of a 
brand directly to a brand’s representative.
After the introduction, your interviewer should inform the 
customer that his answers are being recorded for research 
reference only and obtains the customer’s verbal permission (if 
the interview is being recorded). Then the questions can begin. 
In this scenario, the lead question could be “Why did you select 
that brand of goat cheese?” If the customer’s answer is not 
specific, for example, “I don’t know,” the follow-up should be 
more direct, such as, “Did you find the packaging more appealing 
than the others? Or did you select the product based on the 
price?” Your second main question could be about the product 
being locally produced and the importance that fact did or did 
not play in the customer’s choice. If the customer didn’t select 
your brand, your interviewer could inquire about what product 
features would prompt him to switch to your brand. At this 
point, the interviewer is done and should thank the customer 
for their help. The customer may engage your interviewer in 
conversation, and that is fine as long as your interviewer isn’t 
missing opportunities to speak to other customers.
Focus Groups
Focus groups are the stuff of which advertising legends are made. The 
focus group as portrayed in television and film—think Mad Men—is a 
­stereotype of the experience. Although there is always some kernel of 
truth in a stereotype, focus groups don’t have to be expensive, compli-
cated, or dramatic. They won’t make or break a product or service. They 
will, however, provide the opportunity to explore, somewhat in depth, the 
“why” behind customer behavior.

Chapter 2 | The Role of Research in Design Thinking  
24
Marketing strategist and former psychologist George Silverman explains 
focus groups like this:
The open-ended interaction of focus groups leads to stimulation of 
thoughts and emotions, the revelation of material which is not ordinarily 
forthcoming in an individual interview, the examination of how people 
in various roles interact, and the observation of important behavior.1
The open-ended nature of focus groups make the research technique 
appealing. They are inherently exploratory, framed by two or more inves-
tigative, collaborative activities through which a moderator guides the 
group to reveal relevant insights from the customers’ perspectives. Focus 
groups are best used when more detailed, nuanced information is needed 
or when the customer’s decision-making process is complicated. Health 
care and finance are prime examples of industries that benefit from focus 
group research when developing their products and services.
The primary ingredient for focus groups—with the exception of target 
­customers—is the moderator. I consider personality to be critical when 
selecting a moderator. He or she must be able to make connections with the 
focus group participants and quickly build a comfortable rapport, yet maintain 
enough distance and control to keep the group on task. The moderator is 
not a part of the group but is their guide. I consider moderating a group to 
be similar to supervising other people’s children: the moderator is friendly, 
likable, and engaging, but always in control. If you have the opportunity to con-
tract with an independent moderator, I encourage you to do so. Conducting 
a focus group requires a certain amount of skill, finesse, and experience. If you 
don’t have a budget for a moderator, don’t let that be a barrier to using focus 
groups to your advantage. With a little studying and preparation, you could 
lead the group yourself. It’s not ideal, but it can be done.
The second critical component for a focus group is the moderator’s guide. 
This is a written document that outlines how the group will spend its time 
together. If an independent moderator is used, the guide will likely con-
tain granular detail, including scripted copy for the moderator’s welcome, 
introduction, instructions, and so on, as an added benefit to you, the client. 
An independent moderator will want to ensure that you are informed of 
all the focus group procedures. If you are serving as your own moderator, 
the guide should provide as much detail as you need to stay focused and 
communicate clearly with the group. The moderator’s guide is a docu-
ment for the moderator’s own use, so it doesn’t need to be pretty, just 
thorough.

http://mnav.com/focus-group-center/bensurf-htm/.

With a clear understanding of how the focus group will flow and having 
selected a moderator, it’s time to recruit participants. I have moderated 
groups with as many as twelve participants and as few as three. My ideal 
focus group is no fewer than three but no more than six. There is no 
magic to that number; I find the group size manageable for a moderator 
and engaging for a participant. If you have a group larger than ten, you run 
the risk of group think (the natural tendency of groups to gravitate toward 
a harmonious outcome while forsaking their individual opinions) taking 
hold and skewing your results.
The participants you invite to the focus group should reflect the charac-
teristics of your target market as closely as possible. Going back to our 
goat cheese example, if the primary target market for your product is 
women, ages thirty to fifty, who have children, with household incomes 
of more than $60,000 a year, and who exercise three or more times a 
week, then your focus group should consist of that same type of person. 
Furthermore, you should organize your focus group participants so that 
the group is as homogeneous as possible, for example, stay-at-home moms 
with stay-at-home moms, working moms with working moms. By grouping 
like participants together, you help create rapport among the group, and 
they can build on one another’s answers and thoughts. You can recruit 
focus group participants in many ways, the most popular and cost-effective 
of which include social media, your personal and professional networks, 
and word-of-mouth referrals.
Whether you’ve selected an independent moderator or have taken on that 
role yourself, it is extremely valuable to summarize the focus group’s pro-
ceedings, the insights learned, the “take-aways,” and their implications within 
a day or two after the focus group is completed. (If you’ve worked with a 
moderator, a summary report should be a part of the scope of work for 
which you contracted him or her.) Summarizing the experience and insights 
soon after the focus group will help you not only document what you saw 
and heard, but also capture thoughts and impressions that you may not have 
noted while the focus group was under way.
The Interpreter
There is a wealth of inquiry-driven research tools that can complement 
focus groups or stand alone. These tools serve as interpreters of cus-
tomer insight and are particularly beneficial in providing added clarity 
to customers’ responses to the questions asked. Without a doubt, the 
majority of these tools resemble games, and many of them are captured in 
a wonderful encyclopedic resource called Gamestorming, written by Sunni 
Brown, David Grey, and James Macanufo. Rather than regurgitating their 
work, I focus on two of my go-to interpreter tools that generate a lot of 
discussion among research participants and yield a lot of insight.

Chapter 2 | The Role of Research in Design Thinking  
26
Photo Sort
If a picture is worth a thousand words, you should use them to your 
research advantage. They are especially advantageous if you’re research-
ing areas of consumer behavior rooted in deep-seated emotions, or nebu-
lous topics such as brand personality. The photo sort activity is perfect 
for use in small focus groups or individual interviews.
The images used in the photo sort exercise are generally sourced from 
magazines and the Internet, and the process of gathering the images is 
incredibly contemplative, prompting the researcher to think through all 
aspects of the exercise and the intended outcomes. Images pulled from 
magazines and the Internet are protected by copyright laws; you shouldn’t 
run into any legal issues with using them because you will use them for 
noncommercial purposes, as I am describing here.
In practical terms, you’ll want to use images that are in color, at least as 
large as your palm, and on a white background. If you have to cut out 
an image from a magazine and glue it to a sheet of white paper, do it. If 
you will be using the images with some frequency, perhaps with multiple 
groups of research participants, then you would benefit from having them 
laminated at your nearest copy shop so they will be more durable.
How, exactly, do you go about selecting images to use in this exercise? It 
is entirely dependent on the topic being researched. The key is that each 
image represents an emotion in some way. If you can find images that rep-
resent emotions and contain people who represent your target market, 
then all the better! (Those can be difficult to find, though.)
At this point, the photo sort activity may seem a bit vague, so let’s con-
sider this example: a financial services firm wants to use the photo sort 
activity in a focus group that will be discussing customers’ perceptions 
of investing money. The insights derived from the photo sort activity will 
help direct the firm in developing new investment products and commu-
nicating their benefits effectively to their target customer: men age forty-
five and older, married or divorced with children, and with household 
incomes of more than $75,000. Before sourcing the images, you and your 
research team (whoever you’ve tapped to help you) need to brainstorm 
a list of emotions or emotional states that your target customer might 
experience in connection with investing money. Some of those could be 
fear, a sense of being overwhelmed, confident, tentative, procrastinating, 
empowered, and disengaged.
Once you have your list of emotions, the search for images begins. Major 
search engines, such as Google, allow you to search for images by keyword, 
for example “confident” or “unsure.” You can also use photo-sharing sites 
as a resource. You will get thousands of results, so finding the images isn’t 
the ­challenge. Selecting them is. Put yourself in your target customer’s 

Design Thinking for Entrepreneurs and Small Businesses
27
mindset when you review the images and try to determine what will reso-
nate. Your goal is to compile a collection of diverse but representative 
images that reflect your list of emotions and emotional states.
Tip
■
■
  Don’t wait to build your image library. Whenever you come across an interesting or 
iconic image in your daily consumption of news and information, save it!
With your images selected and your focus group in place, the activity 
begins. Using the financial services example, you or your moderator is 
working with a group of five men who mirror your target consumer. With 
the array of images spread out in the center of the table, in front of the 
focus group participants, you ask the question, “Which of these images 
represents how you feel when you think about making financial invest-
ments?” The participants sift through the images and select as many as 
they like. The obvious follow-up question to each participant is “Why?” 
Be sure to allow each person time to explain his perspective and why he 
chose the image or images he did.
Documenting this activity, and capturing the insights revealed, is much like 
documenting any focus group session: audio and video recording is ideal, 
with additional written notes as needed.
Dot Voting
When researching opinion on existing products or services or perspectives 
on the customer experience, the Dot Voting exercise is an excellent choice.  
It is a good activity for gleaning insights from larger groups. This activity is 
like a visual manifestation of the 1–10 point rating means of measurement, 
and that visualization can spark wonderfully rich discussion. The activity 
itself is incredibly easy to conduct, which makes it universally appealing.
Display a poster along one wall in which a continuum of opinion can be rep-
resented, with the least positive response on the left endpoint and the most 
positive response on the right endpoint. It’s helpful to provide some points 
of measurement along the continuum to give your participants guideposts. 
Consider marking the center of the continuum or marking the quarters.  
I recommend not going as far as to mark each guidepost, 1 through 10, on 
the continuum. You want the continuum to be somewhat flexible in its 
interpretation, save for the center or quarter marks you provided.
Give each participant small round stickers—the kind you find in office 
supply stores that are typically in primary colors—in enough quantity to 
answer each of the questions you’ll be posing, with one sticker represent-
ing one answer. In the financial services example, the moderator might ask 

Chapter 2 | The Role of Research in Design Thinking  
28
the participants, “On a range from 1 to 10, where 1 is ‘least important’ and 
10 is ‘most ­important,’ how important are your friends’ or families’ rec-
ommendations regarding investment decisions?” Then have each of your 
participants answer by placing a sticker along the continuum at a place 
that represents the importance of those recommendations. Once every-
one has placed a dot, you can ask if anyone would like to share why they 
answered the way they did. Then, move on to the next question.
To help you interpret the results, assign each question a specific color of 
dot for the answer. At a glance, you’ll be able to differentiate the answers by 
topic. To use the financial services example again, ask your participants, “How 
important is mobile banking?” The participants respond by placing a blue 
sticker on the poster along the continuum. Next, you ask, “How ­important 
are printed monthly statements?” and the participants answer, but this time 
with a yellow dot, and so on. What if you have more questions than you do 
colored dots? You can achieve the same outcome using markers.
The best way to document the Dot Voting activity is twofold. First, observe the 
participants’ behavior and take written notes. More important, the second 
means of documentation is the culminating result of the activity: the poster.  
A tangible document in this context is generally referred to as an artifact, 
and it’s a wonderful representation of the activity. Save it!
The Devil’s Advocate
Whereas the previous research tools and activities are focused on pro-
viding feedback and revealing opportunities for the researcher, the tools 
that I classify as devil’s advocates are used to try and find gaps, reveal 
weaknesses, and generally question all assumptions associated with the 
product, service, or idea at the center of the research. These activities add 
balance to qualitative research efforts.
The 5 Whys
My all-time favorite devil’s advocate tool is called The 5 Whys. You’ll feel 
like a toddler during the process as you ask “Why” at least five times, 
but trust me: it reveals some great insights. The 5 Whys emerged as an 
effective problem-solving technique during Toyota’s pursuit of innovative 
improvements in its manufacturing process. Used in either a focus group 
setting or as a stand-alone exercise, The 5 Whys peel back the layers of 
perception and opinion to get to the core of what is being researched.
The process is simple. Start with a premise relative to what you are 
researching. In the financial services example, that premise could be “Our 
target customer wants to manage his investments online, without the 

Design Thinking for Entrepreneurs and Small Businesses
29
assistance of an advisor.” You ask your research participants, “Why?” The 
group discusses the possibilities of why and decides that the customer 
wants to manage his investments online because he wants the conve-
nience that the online environment provides. You ask, “Why does he 
want convenience?” The group responds, and the process continues with 
a “Why?” followed by a group discussion and conclusion, and so on until 
collectively, all participating feels like they’ve uncovered the core issue and 
there is no more reasonable answers to “Why?” In the financial services 
example, ultimately the core could be that the customer doesn’t want to 
pay a service fee that he assumes would be involved if he worked with an 
advisor.
The 5 Whys can be used in a focus group setting or online via a collab-
orative platform such as Basecamp2 or even through an online survey 
service, such as Survey Monkey,3 by using open-ended questions. Audio/
video recording is the best choice for documenting the activity if you are 
conducting it live with a group. The data capture from conducting the 
activity in an online format is sufficient documentation, as it produces an 
artifact that can be saved and referred to repeatedly.

  Devil’s advocate activities and tools can easily take on a negative tone and turn 
into gripe sessions. Be alert and ready to redirect the conversation to be more productive.
Cannonball
Another excellent devil’s advocate tool is called Cannonball, the goal of 
which is to “punch holes” in the idea, product, service, or process being 
researched. This tool is best used in a group setting with a moderator 
leading the discussion. Because participants are often shy at the begin-
ning of the activity, they typically will punch holes gently, couching their 
thoughts as tentative suggestions. Don’t let that hesitation fool you; this 
activity can easily accelerate into a barrage of hole-punch attempts, which 
often leads into lively discussion and debate.
Once again returning to our financial services example, Cannonball might 
focus on punching holes in the website developed to answer the target 
customer’s desire for convenience. Research participants might punch 
holes in the way the website functions, what services are available through 
the website, and the way a user has to navigate the website.

Using Cannonball comes with a cautionary disclaimer: the moderator 
needs to understand that the discussion could easily turn negative in tone, 
and he or she needs to be prepared to redirect the conversation or reset 
the tone when necessary to keep the activity productive.
Summary
Research helps eliminate the dangers inherent in making assumptions, 
which can be detrimental to your success. Design thinking research 
 methods—both qualitative and quantitative—are affordable, accessible, 
and incredibly user-friendly, so you have no reason to skimp on it. The 
bottom line is that any of these research activities are frameworks for 
asking questions and getting answers that you can leverage to help you 
succeed. Remember, the only dumb question is the one not asked.

Designing a 
Business Strategy
Get Down to Business
A business strategy is created to outline purposefully the path a business 
must take to achieve its desired outcomes. Behind your business strategy 
is a series of deliberate, data-driven decisions about markets, products, and 
services. It also involves your organization’s culture, from which your busi-
ness goals, decision-making processes, and measurements of success evolve.  
When described this way, business strategy sounds energizing, dynamic,  
and meaningful. So why is it that the majority of business strategies appear 
constrained, confused, and stagnant?
I place the blame squarely on the lack of design thinking, which should be 
brought to bear during the strategic planning process. The roots of design 
thinking are empathy, purpose, and adaptability, and working with design 
thinking principles is inherently dynamic. It would follow, then, that if you 
apply design thinking principles when developing your business strategy, it 
will be dynamic, flexible, and effective.
A Strategy Is Born
It’s exciting to see a business opportunity, and instinctively we want to 
rush to take advantage of it before anyone else does. In that rush, we gloss 
right over the due diligence needed to develop a sound business strategy 
and a viable business model. Once we’re neck deep in our business opera-
tions without those guides, we often realize that we have no clear vision

for what we’re doing or where we want to go. Growth stalls, operations 
hit a tailspin, and we might even panic a bit. To avoid that downward spi-
ral, we need to harness the excitement and channel its energy into smart, 
purposeful planning.

  Clearly define your business opportunity with language everyone can understand. 
This should be a jargon-free zone.
The first, most critical step is to define clearly the business opportunity. 
For the purpose of this book, I’m going to assume that you are familiar 
with SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analyses and 
assessing the competitive landscape, two common and important tools 
used for identifying and articulating business opportunities. If you need 
a refresher or are starting from square one, an Internet search of those 
terms will yield thousands of useful results. My purpose is to introduce you 
to—and encourage your use of—design thinking tools that will add depth 
and additional insight as you develop and define your business strategy.
Conduct your SWOT and competitive analyses first, because they will give 
you the foundation of information on which you can build your strategy. 
With those complete and in hand, you’ll be prepared to introduce the 
following three design thinking tools into your business strategy planning: 
Circles of Influence, Context Map, and Stakeholder Visioning. These tools 
will give you insight from three critical perspectives:
1.	 Yourself and your own network,
2.	 The world outside of your business and its influences, and
3.	 The key stakeholder groups involved in your venture.
The information these tools yield is laced with opinion, and that is okay. 
It balances the data-driven information in your SWOT and competitive 
analyses.
Circles of Influence
We most often hear the phrase “circles of influence” in a persuasive con-
text, such as sales or politics. For our purposes, the context is support 
and development of your business (Figure 3-1). The root of the Circles 
of Influence exercise lies in tapping into your personal, professional, and 
extended networks, identifying additional connections, and leveraging 
them to help you explore new markets, evaluate products and services, 
reach new customers, and more.

Design Thinking for Entrepreneurs and Small Businesses
33
If you are a sole proprietor, you can conduct the Circles of Influence activ-
ity on your own, but I encourage you to include others—close friends, 
your spouse, trusted colleagues, and mentors are good choices—but no 
more than four people. If you have an established leadership team that is 
larger than five people (you plus four others), you could consider working 
through this activity with a larger group, but you’ll need to be diligent in 
keeping everyone focused and productive to avoid the “too many cooks 
in the kitchen” outcome.
As with all design thinking tools, Circles of Influence is best done through 
a visual exercise, but not just a boring list of whom you know. It is very 
hard to uncover connections in such a linear way. Use a dry erase board, a 
flip chart or poster board, or some other large surface on which you can 
write. Write your goal or purpose across the top, for example, “Launch 
our product with three companies of no more than 100 employees as a 
beta test.” Be as specific as you can.
Under your goal statement, draw two large circles, leaving enough room 
between and around them to allow for written notes. Using a different 
color of ink for each circle is visually stimulating but not critical. In the 
center of left circle, write “Doers”; in the center of the right circle, write 
“Supporters.” Give your participants, including yourself, a stack of sticky 
notes (the best office supply item ever). Give each person a different 
Figure 3-1.  Circles of Influence activity diagram

Chapter 3 | Designing a Business Strategy
34
color pad of stickies, which will be helpful in understanding the dynamics 
of potential connections.
Starting with the Doers circle, have the group think of people they know 
who can provide specific, task-oriented help to achieve your goal. Each 
person needs to be named specifically—“James Smith in human resources 
at Company ABC” versus “someone in human resources at Company 
ABC.” As each participant in your group thinks of a doer, he or she writes 
the doer’s name on a sticky note and places it in the Doers circle. Once 
the group has thought of everyone possible, they collectively evaluate and 
discuss how connecting with each doer would be advantageous. Would 
the connection be mutually beneficial? Does the person know other 
potentially helpful people with whom your team could connect? Where 
can you plug these contacts into your strategic approach so you can get 
closer to accomplishing your goal?
Work together to identify whom to speak with first from the Doers 
circle. Who is the easiest person to talk to with the best return? Take 
notes during discussion so you don’t lose any of these details, or better 
yet, audio or video record it as you would a focus group.
Now move on to the Supporters circle and follow the same process with 
specificity in naming the people who belong in that circle, such as “Anna 
Knutz with ChemPro.” The difference between the Doers and Supporters 
circles is subtle but distinct: the people in the Supporters circle might not 
be able to do something specific to benefit your business strategy, but 
they provide thought leadership, support, enthusiasm, and a willingness to 
go the extra mile for you if asked.
Not everyone in the circles will provide value in the way you hope, and 
that’s all right. Focus on the successes. In this example, perhaps it turns 
out that James Smith was delighted to be a beta tester, and Anna Knutz 
provided wise counsel that kept you on track.

  During the Circle of Influencers activity, don’t forget to look for people who belong to 
both circles. They are incredibly valuable connections because they can assist with something 
specific as well as provide support.
Context Map
For the majority of us, when we are working on a challenging situation—
and developing a business strategy certainly qualifies as challenging—it is 
truly difficult to see the bigger picture. We see the details we are most 
concerned with and miss others entirely. The cliché, “You can’t see the 
forest for the trees” is the perfect descriptor.

Design Thinking for Entrepreneurs and Small Businesses
35
Dave Gray, coauthor of Gamestorming,1 has said, “We don’t truly have a 
good grasp of a situation until we see it in a fuller context.” The Context 
Map activity is designed to provide that bigger context. It is based on the 
premise that once you have a larger, systemic view of the environment in 
which your business is operating, you’ll be better prepared to plan for and 
anticipate business and market needs at a larger scale.
The Context Map activity is interactive and requires some advance prepa-
ration on your part to get the most out of it. The group will drive the 
contributions and final outcome of the activity, but as the leader, you’ll be 
responsible for spurring them along with relevant and thought-provoking 
questions. The goal is to describe the external environment in as much 
detail as possible, with the intent that the group can respond proactively, 
rather than reactively. The context map will help your team see the forest, 
not just the trees.

  Consider the Trends section as “square one,” and start developing your context map from 
there.

Chapter 3 | Designing a Business Strategy
36
The Context Map exercise always begins with an outline of current trends. 
The other sections of the map can be completed in any order. Rather than 
directing the group, I recommend you let them dictate the order after the 
Trends sections are completed and pay attention to the workflow. The 
areas that generate more content are fair indicators of where the team’s 
focus and energy lie. Occasionally, the conversation drifts into analyzing 
the internal context—what’s happening within your organization—so 
you may find it necessary to redirect the conversation. Remember, the 
Context Map exercise is best used for external exploration.
You’ll need flip-chart paper, markers, and an expanse of wall for this activity. 
You can draw the necessary elements, which are described in more detail 
next, on the flip chart ahead of time and then post it on the wall, or post the 
paper first and then draw—whichever is easier for you. For the purpose of 
explanation, let’s assume you are posting the paper first and then drawing.
Post six large sheets of paper on the wall so you have two rows of three 
columns. In the center of the top middle sheet, draw something that rep-
resents your business, for example, a place setting if you own a restaurant 
or a computer if you own a software company. It doesn’t have to be 
elaborate. Then, label the picture appropriately with your company name 
(which helps if your drawing skills are marginal). On that same piece of 
paper, in the upper left corner, write “Political Factors.” In the upper right 
corner, write “Economic Climate.”
On the top left and top right sheets of paper, draw several long arrows 
pointing toward the center sheet, leaving enough room between them 
to add notes later. Label these sheets “__________ Trends,” leaving the 
blank empty. Later in the activity, you’ll name the trends. On the bottom 
left sheet, draw more arrows (again, with space in between), this time 
pointing up and to the right toward the top middle sheet. Label this sheet 
“Technology Factors.”
On the bottom middle sheet, draw an image that represents your primary 
customer and label the sheet “Customer Needs.” If you have more than 
one customer group you want to explore in this activity, add an additional 
sheet below that one and draw something representative of that second 
group. Don’t include more than two customer groups in the context map, 
or the activity will get unwieldy.
On the bottom right sheet, draw arrows pointing up and to the left toward 
the top middle sheet, and label that sheet “Uncertainties.”
Now you’re ready to bring in your team and get started. Introduce the 
Context Map activity and explain its purpose: to help the team define and 
understand the bigger picture in which the business functions. Start with 
the Trends sections and have the team contribute the content while you 
add their comments to the sheet. Once the team feels the current trends 
w

Design Thinking for Entrepreneurs and Small Businesses
37
have all been captured, move on to another section, but let them choose 
which one.
Follow the same process—contributing content and comments—for the 
remaining sections, one at a time, until they are all complete.
Using the illustrated example of JDI Deep Sea Excursions, Trends might 
include statements such as “25 percent increase in fishing gear sales in 
the last year,” “Families spending more time on outdoor activities,” and 
“Self-sustaining food movement = more gardens . . . more fishing?” Political 
Factors for JDI may include legislation that restricts fishing in particular 
areas or lobbying groups that actively campaign against leisure fishing at 
sea. The economic climate might include the rising cost of fuel and the 
increased cost of permits.
The Technology Factors section for JDI could include needing a stronger 
presence on the Internet or investing in developing technology to improve 
locating schools of fish. For the Customer Needs section, JDI may identify 
their primary customers as males above age twenty-five and list among its 
needs the desire to be able to book an excursion online. In the Uncertainties 
section, JDI will capture factors affecting its business that are still unclear, 
which could be pending legislation that will severely limit the number of 
fish allowed to be caught or how much the cost of fuel will rise.
Once all of the sections are complete, go back to Trends and review the 
team’s original contributions in the context of the completed map. Do 
any of those identified trends need to change? Are they all on point? For 
example, if your team isn’t confident that the self-sustaining food move-
ment has exerted enough influence in the market to affect your business, 
they may choose to remove that trend from the map. Make any adapta-
tions as necessary and then, as a team, come up with a description for 
those trends in the blank space.
To close the Context Map activity, lead the group through a summary dis-
cussion of what occurred and solicit feedback along the lines of insights, a 
ha! moments, and areas that need further exploration. The last step is to 
agree as a group that the context map is the most accurate representa-
tion of the environment in which the business is operating. I often encour-
age teams to leave the context map posted for several days following the 
activity for reinforcement, as long as it can be posted in an area away from 
clients, vendors, and potential competitors.
Stakeholder Visioning
Every business has multiple groups of stakeholders who have ­varying 
degrees of vested interest in its success and perspectives on what that 
success looks like. Stakeholder Visioning, when used in developing a 

Chapter 3 | Designing a Business Strategy
38
­business strategy, provides a 360-degree review of your business from the 
multiple perspectives of your stakeholders. It also gives the participants an 
opportunity to relate intuitive knowledge and subject matter expertise. 
With these multiple perspectives, you can explore possible futures and 
uncover potential gaps that could impede success.
Divide your team and assign them to a stakeholder group that they will 
represent during the activity. You’ll have at least two groups: customers 
and employees. Depending on the nature of your business, you may want 
to include others, such as vendors, community members, shareholders, 
investors, or mentors. Have them sit together in their new groups, and 
consider having each participant wear a nametag with their group name 
on it, for example, “Customer,” or in some other way indicate each group 
so that participants are clearly identified and no one gets confused.
Ask them to step into their roles and imagine your business—and their 
involvement in it—five years in the future. What will the business be like? 
What will they value as a group? What trends do they think will have 
emerged? What do they think the competitive environment be like? What 
specifically will have changed over those five years? Have the participants 
write their responses on sticky notes, one thought per note. If it helps 
them communicate their ideas better, than can illustrate the notes, as 
well. Then have each group present their perspectives. For example, an 
employee might value increased profits and be concerned that the busi-
ness may become less competitive in five years, whereas a vendor might 
value the opportunity to diversify its own business by working with yours 
and might see a potential permanent partnership in five years.
Once each stakeholder group has presented, ask the participants to step 
out of their roles and review the perspectives from their own points of 
view. Sort the sticky notes into common themes. Within those themes, 
have the team identify any opportunities that can be incorporated into 
your business strategy now to capitalize on future potential.

team has the opportunity to adopt multiple roles.
Summary
A sound business strategy is critical to success, and traditional means of 
planning a strategy are no longer sufficient. Developing a plan to keep 
your business viable and resilient in a volatile marketplace needs design 
thinking. When you add design thinking tools to the process, you can push 
your business strategy to be more robust and comprehensive.

Designing 
Live Customer 
Experiences
Maximizing “Face Time”
One of the more visible ways design thinking can be manifested is through 
live customer experiences, meaning the ways a customer interacts with 
your brand and business in person. In fact, now that the customer experi-
ence has become recognized as an important part of the success of a brand, 
a specialized marketing discipline has emerged: experiential marketing.
Experiential marketing allows customers to engage and interact with 
brands, products, and services in a sensory context, helping them connect 
with the brand in meaningful, personal ways. These personal interactions 
and the connections they build lead to informed purchasing decisions. 
Designing live customer experiences propels your brand beyond the nar-
rative of the features of your product or service; customers experience 
the benefits firsthand.
You can leverage design thinking tools to create brand interactions with 
purpose and meaning, and to do that effectively, you must be able to 
empathize with your customer. Quite simply, if you were your customer, 
what would your expectations for your brand be? How would you want 
to interact with your brand and business? What would you want to derive 
from that interaction? What would you want to feel afterward?

From the physical space your brand occupies to customer service pro-
cesses to employee training, every touch point with a customer is an 
opportunity to showcase your brand, set the tone of the customer con-
versation, and build loyalty.
Your Bricks-and-Mortar Location
If your business has a physical space—an office, warehouse, retail store, 
or open space—this is where a brand’s first impressions are often made. 
Putting some thought into how your brand interacts with a customer in a 
physical space is particularly important for those businesses with revenue 
models that rely heavily on person-to-person transactions. Let’s put this 
concept into personal terms as an example.
Imagine you are hosting someone very important at your home for din-
ner. Perhaps they are your future in-laws, your banker, the chairman of a 
nonprofit on whose board you serve, or a prospective new executive you 
are considering hiring. You want to put your best foot forward, right? You 
give your house a thorough cleaning, arrange freshly potted flowers on 
the front porch, set the table with your best china, and maybe even check 
to be sure your medicine cabinet doesn’t contain anything questionable. 
We’ve all done this (or similar things) because we wanted our guests to 
feel welcome and comfortable, but also because we wanted to portray 
ourselves—our personal brand—in a certain light.
Now let’s put this in business terms. Imagine you are hosting a potential 
customer for a meeting at your office, during which you hope to close a 
deal that will result in doubling your gross revenues for the fiscal year. Is 
your office designed to provide the type of experience with your brand 
that you want that customer to have? Or is your space somewhat haphaz-
ardly put together without any consideration of your brand?
If your physical space is a retail store, is it welcoming without being over-
whelming? Is it designed to engage customers as they navigate the space? 
Is your team trained to provide a specific interpersonal experience for 
customers?
To evaluate your brand experience in terms of physical space, as honestly 
as possible, put yourself in your customers’ shoes. Better yet, recruit a few 
of your leadership team and friends to join you and gather several per-
spectives. For illustrative purposes, I’ll use a retailer as the first example, 
because I believe retail is one business sector with the most to gain when 
the live customer experience is designed.
Start evaluating from the parking lot: is the area clean, and does it feel safe? 
Is your entrance well marked, attractive, welcoming, and free of debris? 
These points seem basic, but they are essential and often overlooked.

Design Thinking for Entrepreneurs and Small Businesses
41
Tip
■
■
  Don’t give a trashy first impression. Make sure your parking lot or car park, sidewalks, 
and breezeways are clean and debris-free.
Next, evaluate the customers’ experience when they arrive at your store. 
Do the interior design, merchandising, and product selection align with 
your brand? For example, if your business is a specialty running store 
and you’ve defined your brand as approachable, egalitarian, and friendly, 
does the interior of your store support that brand message with open 
spaces, welcoming but energizing colors, and places to sit? Does your 
product selection appeal to beginners as well as experienced runners? 
Does your merchandising and signage encourage the customer to explore 
your store? Is the lighting appealing and sufficient? If you have a music 
system, what’s playing? I had a completely incongruous experience in a 
specialty running store in Scotland, in which the system was broadcast-
ing country-and-western music with predominantly slow tempos not at 
all conducive to running. Rather than feeling energized, ready to run, and 
hyped up for new gear, I felt slower, more relaxed, and in no hurry to make 
a purchase—certainly not the customer experience the brand intended.
What if you have an office rather than a retail space? The approach is simi-
lar. Start from the parking lot and work your way inside. If your office is 
on an upper floor, take the elevator and perceive it through your custom-
er’s viewpoint. Is it too slow? Do the doors close too quickly (especially 
important if your customers tend to be older or physically challenged in 
some way)?
Once you arrive at your office, does your reception area or lobby reinforce 
your brand? For example, a conservative health care corporation may furnish 
its lobby in traditionally styled, dark wood furniture accented with oriental 
rugs and classic still-life painting reproductions. A cutting-edge architecture 
firm, on the other hand, may design its reception area with reclaimed mate-
rials, ultra-modern furnishings, and colorful, original artwork. If the physical  
setting of your reception or lobby is incongruous with your brand mes-
sage or devoid of any attention to detail, then the customer experience is 
one of confusion and uncertainty, which is not the first impression you’re 
counting on.
Carry this evaluative process throughout the public spaces of your office 
or retail space, and pay attention to detail. Restrooms, dressing rooms, 
conference rooms, and work areas are opportunities for reinforcing the 
experience you purposefully design. They are also where an experience 
that started off beautifully can deteriorate, sometimes irrevocably.

Color Theory and You
Color is important as the effects are instantaneous; for example blue 
connects the human mind to the universe and alleviates any sense 
of tight enclosure or claustrophobia that could occur in a windowless 
environment.
—Leatrice Eiseman, director of the Eiseman Center for Color 
Information and Training1
Explanations of color theory are plentiful on the Internet, and you can 
find a much deeper history of its evolution and role in marketing, as well 
as behavioral science. Here I’ll touch lightly on how color theory comes 
into play with regard to designing physical space, and color’s effects on live 
customer experiences.
Simply put, color theory attempts to explain what feelings specific colors 
evoke and why. I say “attempt” because color is a highly subjective design 
element. The emotion a color evokes in one person could be markedly 
different in another. The reaction to color can be influenced by personal 
preference as well as cultural perspective.
Tip
■
■
  Avoid the tendency to design your office or store based on your personal preferences, 
especially when it comes to color. Put your brand’s identity and personality before your own.
There are widely accepted generalities that you should consider when 
evaluating your physical space in terms of the customer experience and 
supporting your brand. You’ll notice that some colors seem to evoke feel-
ings that are quite different from each other, a result of how—and how 
much—the color is used in design.
Warm Colors
Warm colors include red, yellow, and orange and generally convey pas-
sion, happiness, enthusiasm, and energy.
Red, a primary color, and its various hues can be used 
• 
to communicate power and passion, as well as danger. 
Brighter reds have more energy; muted, darker reds 
have more elegance.
1Personal conversation with author.

Design Thinking for Entrepreneurs and Small Businesses
43
Yellow, which is also a primary color, can be perceived 
• 
as happy and hopeful, but also as cautious. Softer yel-
lows convey a sense of calm, whereas darker yel-
lows with a more golden hue can convey wealth or 
permanence.
Orange is vibrant and energetic, and is often asso-
• 
ciated with vitality and movement. Orange garners 
attention in a way that is considered less aggressive 
than red.
Cool Colors
Cool colors include blue, green, and purple, and they are considered calm-
ing, soothing, and less intense than their warm counterparts. Therefore, 
these colors and their various hues are frequently used to convey a sense 
of professionalism and maturity.
Blue is most readily associated with calmness, 
• 
responsibility, and peace, with darker hues conveying 
a greater sense of stability and strength while lighter 
hues feel refreshing.
Green is the color of nature and almost universally 
• 
conveys a sense of life, growth, new beginnings, and 
wealth. Brighter greens, incorporating a lot of yellow, 
are energizing and inspirational. Alternatively, darker 
greens that include more blue than yellow are seen 
as stable, solid, and reliable.
Purple has long been associated with royalty, wealth, 
• 
and spirituality. Darker, richer hues of purple convey 
wealth and regality. Lighter purples, such as lavender 
and lilac, are more commonly associated with spiritu-
ality and romance.
Color in a business’s physical space can go a long way toward creating 
the type of environment—and by extension, a type of feeling—you want 
your customers to experience. In terms of your particular business, color 
should be used to reinforce your brand and its image. For example, a plant 
nursery would certainly lean toward using a lot of green—symbolizing 
nature, life, and growth—in its physical environment whether through 
the plants it stocks, paint and decorative elements, or both. However, a 
nursery may also want to punctuate its environment with yellow (happy) 
and orange (energy), both of which appear frequently in natural settings. 
Alternatively, a financial adviser might opt for shades of blue (professional-
ism) and purple (wealth).

Chapter 4 | Designing Live Customer Experiences
44
If the colors in your physical space aren’t aiding in creating the kind of expe-
rience you want for your customers—such as too much red in a psycholo-
gist’s office or too much blue in the gym—don’t despair. More often than not,  
a new paint color will put your space back on the right track. If painting 
isn’t an option for you, or if a lot of your color comes from your furnish-
ings, you still have alternatives. The psychologist with too much red in 
his office can temper that fire with cooler colors by incorporating a few 
accessories in shades of blue or purple. The gym owner could energize 
the workout environment with shades of orange or yellow.
The Human Element
Truly, nothing can make or break a live customer experience than the 
human element—your team. You know this because you’ve experienced 
it firsthand in your own encounters with brands. I’m willing to bet that 
the businesses you frequent most deliver a customer experience that 
has made you feel welcomed, understood, appreciated, satisfied, or some 
combination of these. You shouldn’t deliver anything less to your own 
customers. To ensure that great experience, you need to indoctrinate 
your team members. They need to be living, breathing representations of 
your brand with a commitment to the Golden Rule: treat others as you 
want to be treated. It works in life, and it works in commerce.
One of my favorite design thinking tools for training teams to create 
knock-’em-dead live customer experiences is the empathy map. Empathy 
makes the word go around smoothly; without it, we have misunderstand-
ing and disruption. The empathy map tool leads teams through a process 
that helps them develop empathy for the customer, which leads teams to 
craft experiences that they—as the customer—would want.
Create an Empathy Map
The goal of the empathy map in terms of customer experiences is to gain 
a deeper understanding of customers, and their wants, needs, and expecta-
tions with regard to their interaction with your team, business, and brand. 
I liken the process to the cliché of walking in someone else’s shoes; the 
empathy map is the metaphorical pair of shoes. Creating an empathy map 
can be simple and completed in less than thirty minutes, which makes it a 
doable exercise to conduct during a staff meeting. It is the perfect place to 
start your team’s training in designing customer experiences.
Ideally, you’ll conduct the Empathy Map exercise with a team of no more 
than ten and no fewer than four. If you are a sole proprietor or a young 
start-up with a very small team, consider asking your spouse, a mentor,  
a friend, or any other trusted advisors and individuals to join you.

To start, you (or your moderator, if you choose to use one) will need a 
large whiteboard or flip chart and markers in at least two colors. In the 
center of the board, draw something that represents your customer. I 
often use the ubiquitous “Hello, my name is ___________” name badge 
with “Your Customer” in the blank. It’s easy to draw and everyone recog-
nizes it (Figure 4-1). Across the top of the board, write out the topic you 
want to address in the exercise. In this case, it's “Our customer’s experi-
ence in our store/office and with our team.”
Figure 4-1.  Empathy Map activity diagram
Then divide the remainder of your board into six sections, radiating out 
from the name badge image. Label the sections “Thinking,” “Hearing,” 
“Saying,” “Doing,” “Seeing,” and “Feeling.” Now it’s time to put on those 
metaphorical shoes and start walking. Have everyone participating imag-
ine him- or herself as your customer with the intent of populating the dia-
gram with real sensory experiences from the customer’s point of view.
You can start populating the diagram from any section, and the order 
in which you fill it in doesn’t matter. In fact, you may find yourself and 
your team jumping among sections as the responses flow. Note the most 
common question from participants at the beginning of this exercise is “Are 
we saying what the customer is thinking/hearing/saying/doing/seeing/feeling 

Chapter 4 | Designing Live Customer Experiences
46
now, or do we say what we want the customer to think/hear/say/do/see/
feel?” This is an extremely valid question and begs for clarification.
In a perfect world, the team would stay focused on the customer’s 
responses as they would be in the present. If those responses don’t align 
with what the experience should be, address that separately with a differ-
ent design thinking tool like Microscoping (see Chapter 7). However, the 
world isn’t perfect and that singular focus on the “now” can be difficult to 
maintain. Rather than force the issue, I let groups respond in terms of both 
“now” and “want.” This allows you to capitalize on the inevitable brain-
storming around the customer experience that arises during the Empathy 
Map exercise. The key is to distinguish between the “now” and “want” by 
using different colors of ink. Be sure to include a key somewhere on the 
board that identifies which color is assigned to each type of response.
For the purposes of this example, I’ll start with “thinking.” Have your team 
consider what the customer is thinking during a live customer experience 
and write those thoughts in the diagram, using the terms and language 
your customer would use. Using the specialty running store as an exam-
ple, the customer might be thinking, “I’m not sure what questions to ask,” 
“This employee is really listening to me,” “I feel comfortable in here even 
though I’m not a serious runner.” Remember, the point of the exercise is 
to empathize with customers so you can design a live experience they will 
appreciate. Continue on in this manner through all of the senses until the 
diagram is complete.
Now that your empathy map is complete, you have a lens through which 
you can view your business, your operations, your staff’s training, and 
your product and service offerings from your customer’s perspective. 
Understanding the customer’s perspective and adopting it as your own 
are invaluable as you move through the following design thinking exercises 
to design engaging, live customer experiences.
Note
■
■
  If in the process you find that you don’t know as much about your customer as you 
thought, and you have gaps in your empathy map, that’s okay. Now you’ll know what areas in 
which you need more research to better understand your customer.
Mapping the Customer Experience
Now that you better understand your customer after using the empa-
thy map design thinking tool, what do you do with that knowledge? You 
design the live experience your customers most desire. The customer 
journey map (CJM) is a visual means by which you design how a customer 

Design Thinking for Entrepreneurs and Small Businesses
47
­interacts with your business and brand. Originally and still effectively used 
in service design, the CJM identifies all the touch points where a customer 
interacts with your business, including decision making and exit points, 
where delivering the optimum customer experience can be even more 
critical than at other points along the journey.
The objective with a CJM is to map a customer’s experience with your 
business. Think of a game board with pathways and a definitive start and 
finish. Your map at the end of this exercise will look somewhat like a game 
board with descriptive detail in each space.
You’ll need the usual design thinking materials for this exercise as you’ve 
used with others: a white board or flip chart, markers, and two colors of 
sticky notes.
Tip
■
■
  If you haven’t stocked up on markers, sticky notes, and flip charts yet, get thee to an 
office supply store. You’ll be glad you did.
Start at “Start”
As with every game—or process, adventure, or analysis—you have to start 
at the beginning. With a CJM, your starting place is the first point of contact 
your customer has with your business, and there could be several of them. 
Returning to the specialty running store example, the starting places for a 
customer’s live experience are the store, the telephone, and online. You may 
be wondering how an online starting point can be a part of a live customer 
experience. Consider how often customers—including yourself—search 
online for directions to a store, look up a store’s operating hours, or review 
products on a store’s website prior to visiting the physical location. That activ-
ity leads to the live experience and is therefore important to the process.
To create your CJM, on the far left of your workspace (white board or flip 
chart page), start three rows or paths, with “Store,” “Phone,” and “Online” 
as your starting places. Be sure to leave a few inches of space between 
paths, so you have room to add sticky notes.
Next, pick one path to focus on. For our purposes, let’s focus on the store 
path. The first step along the store path is entering the premises. Draw a 
square like you would see on a board game and label it “Enter.” On one 
color of sticky notes, have your team write short descriptions of what 
the customer’s experience is now on entering the store. For example, 
“Customer squints because there isn’t enough light to see,” or “The sight-
line is open, so the customer can see the whole store at a glance.” On 
the other color of sticky notes, have your team write short descriptions 

Chapter 4 | Designing Live Customer Experiences
48
of what you want the customer’s experience to be: “Customer sees the 
latest merchandise on display,” and “Customer hears the door chime, so 
he or she knows employees are aware that someone has walked in.” If 
there are descriptions that fall into both now and want categories, great! 
You should write those descriptions on both colors of sticky notes and 
put them in their respective areas (Figure 4-2).
Identify the next interaction on the CJM and draw a square. For our 
example, that interaction is the customer being greeted by an employee, 
and the square is labeled “Greeting.” Go through the same process as 
you did with “Enter,” describing on the assigned colors of sticky notes the 
customer’s experience now and as you want it to be.
A CJM can be as detailed or as high-level as you choose, based on how 
deeply you want to analyze—and improve—the live customer experi-
ence. However, even if you opt for detail, don’t get mired down in minu-
tiae. Rarely, if ever, is it necessary to map the experience for every product 
category or service you offer. You are mapping your customer’s journey 
through the “forest,” not their journey up to each tree within the forest.
For the specialty running store example, one of the additional types of inter-
action is “Browsing Product.” Browsing is a “forest” activity—broad and 
Figure 4-2.  Customer Journey Map activity diagram, beginning

Design Thinking for Entrepreneurs and Small Businesses
49
big-picture. If we broke browsing down into subsections such as “browsing 
footwear,” “browsing apparel,” and “browsing accessories,” we would be 
focusing on the trees and could miss the forest (a.k.a. big picture) entirely.
To flesh out the in-store experience for our example, we would add “Foot 
and Gait Analysis,” “Footwear Fitting,” and “Check-out” (the “finish” of 
the game board). For each of these steps along the path, the team follows 
the same descriptive process used with “Enter” and “Greeting.” The end 
result of the Store path would look something like Figure 4-3.
Note
■
■
  Not all paths will contain the same number of steps. However, each path will have a 
start, at least one intermediate step, and a finish.
When all of your live customer experience paths on your CJM are com-
plete, review them for commonalities. What shared experiences exist 
that you want to maintain or reinforce? Are there shared deficiencies 
between paths that demand immediate correction? Where can you invest 
your resources to produce the best possible outcomes and improve the 
live customer experience? Document all thoughts, ideas, solutions, and 
tasks, and sort them into one of four action lists with thirty-day, sixty-day, 
Figure 4-3.  Customer Journey Map activity diagram, with one completed path

Chapter 4 | Designing Live Customer Experiences
50
ninety-day, and undetermined deadlines. For example, if the running store 
customers are squinting as they enter the store because the lighting is 
inadequate, list “Change wattage of entry lighting; brighter bulbs” on the 
thirty-day action list. Notice the specificity of the action listed. That kind 
of detail empowers self-directed action among your team. Push yourself 
and your team to sort your ideas into the action lists with deadlines, 
because deadlines are the catalysts for completing any kind of task.
The undetermined action list should be the shortest of them all; ideally 
it is empty. A task without an assigned deadline has a high probability of 
lingering without completion. If you cannot determine a deadline for a 
task, you probably lack the proper information to make a determination 
in the first place. Therefore, shift your task to finding the information, and 
put a deadline on it.
When the thoughts, ideas, solutions, and tasks have been sorted into 
action lists, move on to assigning team members the responsibility of tak-
ing the lead in marshaling those tasks and getting them accomplished. 
Depending on the skill sets and personalities of your team members, the 
nature of your business culture, and your leadership style, team members 
could volunteer to lead, or you could directly assign them responsibilities 
as necessary.
Align Employees to Customer Expectations
Understanding your customer and designing a live experience that is 
engaging and relevant is invaluable. However, the experience is of no value 
if your employees aren’t aligned and committed to delivering on your cus-
tomers’ expectations. You may have heard the old expression, “You can 
lead a horse to water, but you cannot make him drink.” Now that you’ve 
led your employees to the water (the experience your customer wants), 
this next design thinking tool will help you get your employees to drink 
(deliver the experience). The Code of Conduct exercise will help you 
lead your team and get them to drink.
Code of Conduct
The title of this design thinking tool is a bit intimidating, and that’s all right. 
Your ultimate outcome from the Code of Conduct exercise is a shared 
understanding among your team regarding what is required of them indi-
vidually to deliver a meaningful live customer experience.
In the center of a whiteboard or flip chart, write the words “Pleasant” 
and “Meaningful.” Ask each member of your team to call out what actions, 
 behaviors, and beliefs they believe are necessary to make the live customer 

Design Thinking for Entrepreneurs and Small Businesses
51
experience pleasant and meaningful. Write each thought and idea on your 
workspace in a mind map diagram. Group the thoughts and ideas around 
“Pleasant” and “Meaningful” as appropriate.
For the specialty running store example, contributions (Figure 4-4) could 
include “Make eye contact when you greet a customer,” “Don’t appear to 
be in a rush,” “Shake the customer’s hand at the end of the transaction, 
even if they haven’t bought anything,” and “Encourage the customer to be 
brutally honest about how the shoes feel.”
Now quickly review each of the contributions and how they are grouped. 
Does everyone have the same understanding of each statement? Does 
everyone agree with how the statements are grouped? Is there any-
thing missing? When your team is satisfied with the diagram, review each 
statement and ask why it is important to the live customer experience. 
Document their responses alongside the statement being addressed.
Once all statements have been reviewed and responded to, your diagram 
will resemble a work agreement that your team has co-created and to 
which they tacitly agreed. Your role at the end of the Code of Conduct 
exercise is to review the outcome with your team, noting each statement 
and the value they assigned to it. Remind them they now have a shared 
Figure 4-4.  Code of Conduct activity diagram

Chapter 4 | Designing Live Customer Experiences
52
commitment to follow this code. Granted, it’s a sneaky way to get employ-
ees aligned, but it works. The key is in the co-creation.
Enforcing the code of conduct and ensuring adherence to the commit-
ment can be a challenge. Ideally, you’ll have the type of business culture 
in which your employees can police themselves in a constructive way so 
that they keep each other focused and on task, without you needing to be 
directly involved. Unfortunately, there will be times when you have to step 
in and correct the behavior of either the code violator, the corrector, or 
both. It’s a downside of being the boss.
Perhaps the best and most relatable example is parenting multiple chil-
dren. I am a mother of four daughters, and they all know my and my 
husband’s expectations for their behavior. They readily police themselves, 
and generally that works just fine. Occasionally, though, there are tattletale 
moments and I have to step in when self-policing is delivered in a noncon-
structive way.
One means of ensuring enforcement of the code while minimizing your 
need to parent your employees is making the code part of your business’s 
culture and conversation. Weave the content of your code of conduct 
into employee communications, add a review to the agenda of staff meet-
ings, and consider posting the visualized code (Figure 4-4) in a break room 
or similar space as an ever-present reminder.
Summary
Even though we live and work in a digitally dominated world, live experi-
ences remain a significant and valuable interaction point between busi-
nesses and customers. They can make or break a customer’s perception 
of your business and brand, and they are one of many areas that benefits 
greatly from the purposeful application of design thinking.

Designing 
Digital Customer 
Experiences
Creating Connections in the Digital Domain
The importance of live customer experiences is undeniable, and knowing 
that is incredibly valuable to your business and marketing planning. Also 
undeniable are the realities of our digital world and the evolving cus-
tomer touch points that technology provides. A good digital experience 
isn’t based just on functionality but on how your customer feels while 
interacting with it.
In the digital space, customer interaction is immediate and impatient.  
A customer can interact with your business and brand with intent 
(“I’m going to shop my favorite store online and buy some new clothes”), 
on a whim (“I wonder what time that movie is showing?”), or through hap-
penstance (your digital presence is included in the results of an Internet 
search). A customer can interact with your business and brand online, 
via mobile technology, and through social media. Leveraging these pos-
sible means of interaction through technology requires a commitment to 
consistency in message, branding presentation, and quality across all digital 
platforms and devices.

The Online Experience
Online experiences are now ubiquitous in business. Second only to 
developing a brand, creating a website is an immediate need for an entre-
preneur or emerging business, and for good reason. To a customer, a 
website adds legitimacy and authenticity to a business; they expect to find 
a website that provides sufficient information, as well as opportunities to 
interact with the business in a way that meets their expectations. Often a 
website provides the customer’s first experience with a business. As with 
live customer interactions, first impressions have impact.
Designing a relevant and meaningful customer experience in the digital 
realm involves more than just offering compelling graphic design and 
basic functionality. It requires a deep understanding of your customer 
that guides a thoughtful approach to information architecture, navigability, 
and usability. It also requires entering into the process knowing that until 
you’ve tested your website and are satisfied that it delivers what your 
customer wants, it is a prototype. Expect to have revisions even after you 
think you’re done.
There are scores of digital agencies, freelancers, DIY software, and other 
resources to guide you through building a functional website. My purpose 
here is to give you a solid understanding of the process so that you are 
equipped well to work with, ask questions of, and challenge the assump-
tions of anyone with whom you work—including yourself—to develop 
your online presence.
Information Architecture
Information architecture (often abbreviated IA) is simply fancy nomen-
clature for how your website’s content is structured, shared, and found. 
The Information Architecture Institute defines IA formally as:
The structural design of shared information 
• 
environments.
The art and science of organizing and labeling web-
• 
sites, intranets, online communities, and software to 
support usability and findability.
An emerging community of practice focused on 
• 
bringing principles of design and architecture to the 
digital landscape.1
1See http://www.iainstitute.org/en/about/our_mission.php.

Design Thinking for Entrepreneurs and Small Businesses
55
As you discuss and design your website’s IA, you need to consider first 
and foremost what your customer wants to accomplish by visiting your 
website. That is the foundation on which you build. The best way to illus-
trate the development of IA is through example. For simplicity, we’ll use a 
service-based business as the case study.
Let’s say you own a professional consulting firm and need to design its IA 
in preparation for developing a website. First, ask yourself why you need a 
website. In other words, what does your customer want to accomplish via 
your website? Your answers likely include finding your contact informa-
tion, learning more about your services, learning more about your experi-
ence, and perhaps reading some case studies or testimonial statements 
from satisfied clients. Those answers identify the “big buckets,” or main 
categories, of information.
IA designers represent this work visually through a tool called a wire 
frame, which looks a lot like an organization chart. The wire frame for our 
example would start out looking like Figure 5-1.
Figure 5-1. Wire frame example, tier 1
Now that you’ve defined your main information categories, you start on 
the next level of information. In the wire frame, this is the second layer 
in the chart (below the home page) and represents the information the 
customer wants to see if they click on one of your main categories. So in 
the consulting firm example, let’s say the customer wants to learn more 
about the various services you offer. The second tier of information would 
include a list of services you provide, accompanied by brief descriptions. 
The wire frame would look like Figure 5-2.

Chapter 5 | Designing Digital Customer Experiences
56
At this point, your IA may reach its conclusion for the services informa-
tion, or it may need to expand. If you have only a few services and can 
sufficiently (and appealingly) describe them within a paragraph or two, 
you may not need another tier in the wire frame. If you need to provide 
greater detail, you might need another tier after all. If you need a third tier, 
the wire frame would look like Figure 5-3.
Figure 5-3. Wire frame example, tier 3
Figure 5-2. Wire frame example, tier 2
To flesh out the wire frame for your entire site, you would follow this 
process through each main information category to its natural end.

Design Thinking for Entrepreneurs and Small Businesses
57
Navigability 
When you have a completed wire frame, the next step is to design the 
navigation of your website. Simply stated, you want to design how a cus-
tomer moves through your site among the various pages of content.
Customers’ web behavior is fickle, and because of that, great navigation 
walks a fine line between simplicity and annoyance. There’s a general 
belief within digital marketing circles that a customer won’t click through 
to another page within a website more than three times—less if they 
want to accomplish a specific task, such as contacting you. With each click, 
therefore, the content must be compelling and what they expect to see, 
or they may leave the site completely. Design your navigation to accom-
modate that fickleness.
Fortunately, there are a few widely accepted best practices for designing 
the navigability of your website. Leverage these! Don’t let a web designer 
or other consultant try to convince you of something different. There are 
far too much data that support these best practices to ignore.
Use a Top or Left-Side Orientation
First and foremost, embrace the fact that customers are habituated to 
look for the main navigation menu at the top or left side of your web page. 
Yes, it’s predictable and somewhat boring, but it’s easy and that’s key. You’ll 
notice that most of the popular templates, or themes, on Wordpress2  
(a type of web-based software for creating and hosting websites and blogs) 
have their main navigation in one of those areas. A few of the popular 
themes have images that dominate the top part of the page, with the 
navigation immediately below them. These themes defy the best practices  
I’m describing, so a word of caution: just because those themes are popular  
doesn’t mean they are producing the best results.
Tip
■
■
  Keep your main navigation at the top of the page. It’s the first place customers expect 
to see it.
Use Descriptive Navigation
Second, make your main navigation descriptive. Although I’ve used 
“consulting services” in the case example, I encourage you to be more 
descriptive. If you consult on marketing, use “Marketing Consultation” 
2See http://wordpress.org/.

Chapter 5 | Designing Digital Customer Experiences
58
in your main navigation. This level of specificity communicates directly 
to your customer and makes your site more visible to search engines. 
In fact, you may consider using highly targeted search terms or key 
words as your main navigation headings. Google offers a free tool called 
Keyword Planner that is easy to use.3
Order Navigation Cues Carefully
Finally, consider the order of your main navigation. Items that appear 
first or last on any list are most effective, and navigation is no exception. 
Psychology studies on the “serial position effect” show that attention 
and retention are highest for things that appear at the beginning and 
at the end of lists. The middle gets lost in memory. Your navigation 
categories that are most important to your customers, and ultimately 
your business, should be listed first in your navigation. What about all of 
those websites you see with their “About Us” first in their navigation? 
Don’t do that.
Figure 5-4.  Navigation best practices

Design Thinking for Entrepreneurs and Small Businesses
59
Usability
With your navigation in place, the usability of your website comes to the 
forefront. The more usable the website, the easier for customers and 
the better their experience because it presents information in a clear 
and concise way and in locations that seem logical and lets them easily 
accomplish their goals.
Tip
■
■
  A website that is difficult or annoying will damage or destroy the digital experience and 
alienate customers.
Usability goes hand in hand with graphic design, so evaluating usability 
will run on a parallel path with the development of the website’s graphics.  
The discipline of graphic design for the web is rife with best practices, 
technological protocols, and design accommodations that other media 
don’t require. There are scores of other books devoted solely to web 
design and all its intricacies; this book is not one of them.
My intent in including usability as it relates to designing a digital experience 
is to highlight its fundamental importance. Usability is where the rubber 
meets the road, so to speak. All of your effort with IA and navigation is for 
nothing if customers can’t easily use the resulting website.
Keys to a Functional Website
As your graphic designer creates a functional website, there are best 
practices to ensure a usable product. Peter J. Meyers, the president of 
User Effect, compiled a twenty-five-point usability checklist4 that is a 
great (though lengthy) resource. I consider five of them most critical to 
a website’s effectiveness.
Loading time for the site is reasonable. If your site 
• 
takes too long to load, the customer will give up, and 
you’ve lost him or her.
Good contrast between text and background and 
• 
the font selection and size allow for easy readability. 
Customers don’t want to squint or strain their eyes 
to read your information.
4See http://www.usereffect.com/topic/25-point-website-usability-checklist.

Chapter 5 | Designing Digital Customer Experiences
60
Your logo is placed prominently, and your contact 
• 
information is easily found.
Use of buttons, links, and drop-down menus is rea-
• 
sonable. Thoughtfully guide your customer through 
your content; don’t make them leap around to find 
the information they want.
Content is concise, communicates clearly (i.e., can be 
• 
skimmed and understood), and uses emphasis spar-
ingly. The latter is particularly important. If too much 
of your content is emphasized through a boldface 
font or different text colors, or punctuated with too 
many exclamation points, how will your customer 
know what information is truly important?
The best way to determine the usability of your website is to test it. The 
best times to do this are early in the design process, when you can catch 
major flaws; when the design is complete but before the site is live; and 
any time you make major changes to the site. A good general approach 
to testing the usability of your site is to recruit five to ten individuals who 
best represent your primary customer demographically but who are not 
familiar with your website design. You might also consider participants 
who have varying levels of online experience. Generally, if you’re testing 
early in the process, you need fewer participants to catch the big flaws. 
As the website gets more refined further in the process, you’ll need more 
participants.
Don’t let identifying and recruiting participants for testing overwhelm you. 
Much like recruiting participants for focus group research, start with the 
people you know in your professional and personal circles and expand 
from there. You probably won’t have to look far to find amenable recruits. 
Once you have your testing cohort, it’s time for evaluating your website.
Usability tests come in many different formats, and some agencies that 
specialize in digital design and development can make testing seem like 
an unwieldy beast to manage. It isn’t. Usability tests can be simple and 
straightforward. At the end of the day, you want to know if your website 
works the way it should. Design your test to deliver that information.
Design and Conduct an Effective Usability Test
To effectively design your usability test, outline what tasks you want the 
participant to do and the information you want to glean from that action. 
Then, draft directions and/or questions for the participants that will yield 
that information. For example, you might instruct them to locate and 
o

Design Thinking for Entrepreneurs and Small Businesses
61
purchase a particular product, ask them where on the site they would find 
more information about the business’s leadership team, or ask them to 
sign up for the newsletter.
Usability tests can be conducted in person by a moderator who guides the 
participants through the actions and observes the process. As with focus 
groups, you may want to record one or two participants, generally with 
the camera positioned over the participant’s shoulder with their hands, 
the keyboard, and the computer screen captured in the frame. Usability 
tests can also be conducted remotely via a survey format, although this 
isn’t as effective because you lose the opportunity for observation. In 
either case, at the end of the test, ask your participants to write a brief 
summary of their experiences, sharing any observations they have about 
functionality, navigation, and design.
Remember that at the beginning of this discussion, I pointed out that 
you need to consider your website as a prototype. Here’s why: You will 
discover new things that require site changes.
After testing, review the data for its relevancy and determine what changes 
need to be made to remove any deficiencies. Certainly you want to create 
the best possible online experience for your customer, so don’t cringe at 
the idea of revisions.
Tip
■
■
  If the revisions to your site were extensive after the initial usability test, conduct another 
one. If the revisions were minor, then let your timeline and budget dictate whether you will do 
another round of testing.
The Mobile Experience
Smart phones and mobile applications have evolved into critical touch 
points in the customer’s digital experience. Because of that, businesses of 
all sizes and kinds are struggling to get ahead of the customer experience 
curve and find ways to drive brand engagement through mobile devices. 
Mobile technology puts Internet access, information, and social media in 
the hands of customers whenever they want it, wherever they are—and 
that’s an immediacy you cannot afford to ignore.
Consider this scenario: Suzy Customer is in a coffee shop and wonders 
where she can find the designer handbag she’s been coveting and finally 
decided to buy. She’ll search the Internet for nearby stores so she can 
have it in her hands today. She finds your listing in her search results 
and clicks on your link. What will her experience with your business be 
through her mobile device?

Chapter 5 | Designing Digital Customer Experiences
62
Businesses that capitalize on the unique opportunities mobile devices 
present and purposefully design their digital customer experience to 
accommodate this technology can get ahead of their competitors. The 
key is to accept that mobile technology isn’t simply a breeding ground 
for innovation. Rather, it is an important part of the business’s overall 
customer experience ecosystem and an ever-evolving one at that. The 
following list suggests some of the best practices for mobile design5:
1.	 Put functionality first and visual design a distant second.
2.	 Performance is everything.
3.	 Keep it simple.
4.	 If a website will work, then skip the app.
5.	 Balance function, performance, and visual design for the 
best outcome. Too much of one thing isn’t a good thing.
Designing for mobile technology often seems overwhelming. Ask for 
a mobile application and your designer/programmer will ask if it’s for 
iPhone, Android, BlackBerry, iPad, or a netbook. (Each year there probably 
will be additional technology to add to that list!) Each device requires its 
own design to accommodate its operating platform and screen dimension. 
Imagine the costs of designing and programming for each type of device. 
Now imagine the costs of losing customers because you just didn’t have 
the budget to develop an application for their type of device. Fortunately, 
there’s been a shift in perspective among digital designers that is proving 
to be a huge benefit for businesses, especially those with limited resources 
for developing their digital presence.
Responsive Design: An Alternative to Apps
As described in Smashing Magazine,
Responsive Web design is the approach that suggests that design 
and development should respond to the user’s behavior and 
environment based on screen size, platform and orientation. The 
practice consists of a mix of flexible grids and layouts, images and 
an intelligent use of CSS media queries. As the user switches from 
their laptop to iPad, the website should automatically switch to 
accommodate for resolution, image size and scripting abilities. In 
other words, the website should have the technology to automatically

respond to the user’s preferences. This would eliminate the need for 
a different design and development phase for each new gadget on 
the market.6

  Unless you have a very specific interaction you want your customer to experience or 
participate in, you probably don’t need a mobile application.
For business professionals who aren’t web designers, this description may 
sound like a foreign language. The most important part of it is, however,  
the last sentence, which loosely translated into business-speak means 
“budget-friendly.” Responsive design largely eliminates the need for mobile 
apps in all but the most specialized customer interactions on mobile 
devices. Let’s look at an example.
A local chapter of a nonprofit, membership-based social organization was 
concerned that it was missing opportunities to connect with and engage 
its current and potential customers (members) through digital media. 
Although it had invested significant financial resources in developing a 
content-rich web presence, the organization hadn’t expanded its digital 
footprint to include mobile devices. The leadership felt that a mobile app 
would fill the gap, and they surveyed their membership to inquire about 
the type of mobile devices that were owned and used the most. The 
survey revealed three different types of devices for which applications 
would need to be designed. Unfortunately, the organization had limited 
resources to put toward development for even one app.
The organization’s leadership worked with a web development consultancy,  
which helped them identify the types of interactions they wanted their 
members to be able to perform through mobile devices. These interac-
tions mirrored those that could be performed on the group’s website. 
An independent mobile app wouldn’t be necessary to accomplish the 
organization’s objective. Instead, the agency would restructure the group’s 
website using responsive design techniques and mobile usability best prac-
tices. The end result was a digital experience in which the member could 
easily navigate and perform the key interactions in a visually appealing and 
efficient way—and consistent with the experience members would have 
online via the website—regardless of the type of mobile device they used. 
In simpler terms, a member could use his or her smart phone, netbook, 
or laptop and easily perform interactions in the same way successfully on 
each device.

The Social Media Experience
The third aspect of the digital customer experience trifecta is social media, 
and it plays an important role in creating an experience that supports a 
brand as well as delivering value to your customer in a way that resonates.  
Social media has also earned a reputation as a potential powder keg for 
businesses, but frankly, that’s not entirely accurate. Social media in and of 
itself is a powerful communication tool. It offers a means to nurture con-
nections with existing customers and connect your business with thou-
sands of potential customers with which you might otherwise never have 
the opportunity to interact. The missteps of businesses in their use of 
social media is what has given the medium its stigma, and that can be 
assuaged by understanding its role and place in the customer experience 
landscape.
Note
■
■
  Social media missteps, such as unauthorized Tweets or insensitive images on 
Facebook, can be a source of problems, but that’s hardly a reason to avoid social media 
marketing efforts. When done right, they can enhance your brand, improve user experience, 
and give you an opportunity dialogue with customers.
Small businesses and entrepreneurs often see a great deal of success using 
social media as a means not only to communicate key information to 
customers but also help build a relationship with those customers and 
nurture loyalty. Clothing retailers provide great examples of this kind of 
interaction. Apricot Lane Boutiques, a franchised women’s clothing retailer, 
engages customers on Facebook and Twitter with frequent posts about 
specific merchandise, sales, and events local to each boutique’s market. 
The franchisees respond to customer questions and comments via social 
media, making use of the platform’s two-way communication vehicles. 
Herein lies a critical point: this business understands that social media 
can—and should—be a way to speak and listen to their customers.
Listening to Customers
Just as you can use social media to reach your customers and a wider 
audience of potential customers, so can your customers use social media 
to reach each other and that wider audience. Customers readily post their 
experiences—and their opinions thereof—in social media environments, 
most notably Facebook and Twitter. It’s human nature to want to share 
one’s experiences with others, especially when those experiences are 
emotionally charged. Social media gives them immediate outlets through 
which they can share, but that isn’t always a good thing.

Customers might rave about the excellent service they received, describe a 
situation in which an employee went above and beyond to solve a problem, 
and encourage their friends and followers to support the business. In the 
glow of the feel-good moment, the satisfied customer can post a message 
from their smart phone on the spot. Definitely a desirable response!
Customers may also rage about an experience they perceive as less than 
ideal, whether it involved customer service, product performance, or 
operating policies. In this situation, the immediacy of social media can be 
a powder keg. In the heat of the moment, an angry customer can post a 
message without the benefit of having clearly thought through the com-
ment or the potential effect of it.
In both situations, how the business responds will affect brand perception, 
customer loyalty, and the business’s reputation.
Tip
■
■
  The way you respond to social media posts—what you say, when you say it, and how 
you say it—greatly affects the customer experience, for better or for worse.
Reputation Management
Managing the customer experience in social media is frequently referred 
to as reputation management. That means monitoring social media plat-
forms and engaging with customers appropriately, whether that involves 
answering questions, solving problems, or simply thanking customers for 
their support. It also means thoroughly understanding that there is no 
such thing as anonymity in digital media. Your activity in social media 
needs to be genuine and transparent as to its source. So whether you take 
on this responsibility, assign it to another team member, or contract with 
someone outside of your organization, reputation management is crucial 
to your business. The end goal is ensuring a positive digital experience for 
your customers.
Successful reputation management and positive customer experiences 
hinge on the timeliness, tenor, and content—in that order—of your 
response to a customer’s comment, question, or complaint. For the most 
positive results, respond to any customer communication within an hour 
during normal business hours. If a customer praises you, thank them. If a 
customer has a question, answer it directly if you can be brief. If the answer 
requires a longer explanation, you can either ask the customer to email 
you or direct him or her to a specific page on your website where he or 
she can read the answer at length. Don’t know the answer to the question?  
By all means, at least post a response along the lines of “Thank you for asking!  
Let me collect the accurate information, and I’ll respond again soon.”

  The anonymity of digital media is a myth; your identity can be uncovered.
If a customer complains on social media, responding can be tricky and 
warrants greater care. The tenor and content of your response is crucial 
to resolving the situation to the customer’s satisfaction and retaining your 
business’s reputation and good will. Make a misstep, and your response 
could not only alienate that customer but also go viral and wreak havoc 
on your business’s reputation. A customer complaint calls for a prompt, 
professional, succinct-but-not-curt, sincerely concerned response. Don’t 
belabor the point, don’t make excuses, and don’t be defensive even if you 
feel the complaint is unjustified or vitriolic. Provide your contact informa-
tion and ask the customer to contact you directly if they have any addi-
tional concerns or questions. If the complaint is specific to an employee, 
or if it will require additional action on your part to resolve, you’ll want 
to move this conversation out of the public eye.
Summary
Although the digital world in which we live and work is enduring, it is also 
evolving. What the digital landscape looks like today will be vastly differ-
ent in a few short years. Technological advances result in new devices 
through which we can reach customers and digital environments in which 
we can interact with them. Regardless of how technology changes, the 
basis of our customer interaction stays the same. The quality of the cus-
tomer’s experience—not the vehicles through which it occurs—is what 
helps shape a business’s success. As entrepreneurs and business owners, 
we need to keep our eyes on that prize.
Above all, remember to design the same positive experience with your 
customer in the digital space as you would if the customer was standing 
in front of you.

Designing 
Services and 
Service Delivery
Purposeful Customer Service
The playground of small businesses and entrepreneurs is not only product 
development but also services and their delivery. In fact, a service business 
is a common point of entry for entrepreneurship. On some level, almost 
everyone is qualified to start a service-based business, because everyone 
has some skill, knowledge, or experience for which others are willing to 
pay. Starting a service-based business is quite an egalitarian proposition; 
anyone with a decent work ethic and a desirable skill can sell a service; as 
opposed to product-based businesses, there is a reduced financial commit-
ment because there is no physical inventory to purchase and maintain.
Differentiating your service business from the sea of others is equally 
as challenging as it would be with a product-based business. However,  
by applying a design thinking approach and using the discipline’s tools, you 
can be purposeful where competitors may be haphazard.

Services as Solutions
Just as a product must fulfill a customer need, a service must provide a 
solution to a customer’s problem. For example, customers need a more 
fuel-efficient, high-capacity vehicle, so a U.S. car manufacturer produces 
a hybrid version of its best-selling SUV. The automaker’s product fulfills 
a need. Furthermore, entrepreneurs and small-business owners need 
help getting everyday tasks done, so a software as a service (SaaS) 
company creates a web-based platform through which entrepreneurs 
and owners can contract with freelance assistants to accomplish those 
tasks. The SaaS company’s service provides a solution.
Here is where the conversation about products and services can get 
­esoteric. I have had many a colleague posit that a product can provide 
a solution, and a service can fulfill a customer need. Perhaps the hybrid 
SUV is the solution to a customer’s transportation problem, and the SaaS 
company’s platform is the product that fulfills the customer’s need for 
an assistant. Do the semantics matter? Not all that much, but for our 
­purposes of discussing the use of design thinking in developing services, 
we’ll define services as solutions.
Successfully applying design thinking to a service business requires a solid 
understanding of the customer’s problem for which the service is to be 
the solution. Chapter 2 covers the important role of research in the design 
thinking process. If you don’t have a clear understanding of the problem 
for which the customer needs a solution, you simply cannot properly 
design a service to satisfy that problem. If you skipped Chapter 2, go back 
and read it now. If you’ve read it, remember that research helps eliminate 
assumptions, and design thinking research methods are affordable, accessible, 
and very user-friendly.
The 5 Whys
With regard to service design, I highly recommend you use the 5 Whys 
as one of your design thinking tools (see Chapter 2 for a description).  
It is particularly important to understand the true root of the customer’s 
problem to best design the service solution. Let’s use a virtual assistant 
service as an example. At the surface, the belief is that entrepreneurs need 
help getting general business and personal tasks done. Why? Because they 
don’t have time to do it all. The answer to “why?” may seem to be suf-
ficient and a reasonable basis on which to design a service to solve the 
entrepreneur’s problem. By digging deeper, however, we can design a ser-
vice that delivers a more precise—and satisfactory—solution. Answers to 
additional why questions could reveal that ultimately, the entrepreneur 
doesn’t have the expertise to handle specific tasks but won’t or doesn’t 
readily admit that to him- or herself.

  Embrace your inner toddler and enjoy asking “why?”
With a surface-level understanding of the problem, we may have designed 
the virtual assistant service to provide task fulfillment in a wide variety of 
areas performed by assistants with generalized experience. Instead, with a 
deeper level of understanding, we would design the service to offer assis-
tance provided by more specialized experts to fulfill highly specific tasks in 
targeted areas of operations, such as finance or human resources.
Making the Intangible Memorable
The one distinct feature of a service business that I encourage you to 
keep at the forefront of your mind and your awareness is this: services 
are intangible. Although services can be experienced and consumed, they 
cannot be physically touched, and their intangible nature produces some 
unique challenges with customers.
Services are at a great disadvantage as compared to products when it 
comes to forming lasting impressions among customers. Generally, ser-
vices don’t result in physical artifacts or tangible representations of the 
service that was provided. (Paperwork and forms—regardless of how 
classy their presentation folder is—do not count.) With product-based 
businesses, customers possess a physical artifact that they can ­identify 
with the business transaction, for example, an air-conditioning system, a 
car, a dress, or a watch. The artifact serves as a sort of memory device, 
prompting the customers to remember the business and their ­experiences 
interacting with it.
Intangible services are much like memories: they can be described in 
great detail, can be emotionally charged, and leave a lasting impression. 
Conversely, they can also be insignificant and transient. It’s the quality and 
depth of meaning in what occurred that creates a lasting memory. It’s also 
what gives a service its significance in the eyes and minds of customers.
To illustrate this dichotomy, I’ll put the concept in personal terms: think 
of a vacation from which you brought home a souvenir, say, a seashell 
from the beach or a miniature Eiffel Tower from Paris. When you see 
that souvenir, do you recall the details of your vacation and all that you 
experienced? Now, think of a vacation from which you didn’t bring home 
a souvenir. How often do you recall the memories of that trip? Can you 
recall those memories in rich detail, or are the memories a bit fuzzy?

Chapter 6 | Designing Services and Service Delivery
70
Note
 
■
 Services lack the advantage of physical artifacts, which provide customers with 
visual cues to remember their interactions with a business.
A service business’s lack of a physical artifact shouldn’t be seen as a  deficiency, 
but should be considered a ripe opportunity to engage design-thinking tools 
to ensure a service is delivered in such a meaningful way that it can be 
remembered in detail, over time, without the need of a visual prompt.
Service Delivery Pathways 
Service delivery seems inextricably linked to the customer experience, 
and from many viewpoints, it is. However, the focus of service delivery is 
efficiency and effectiveness—for your customer and your business—and it 
should be regarded as a distinct characteristic of your business and therefore 
planned and designed accordingly. The easiest way to view service delivery is 
to focus on the mechanisms through which your service is delivered. Let’s go 
back to the virtual assistant service example to illustrate the difference.
An entrepreneur has decided to use your service to help her with book-
keeping. How will you provide that service? In other words, through what 
paths can the customer engage your business, and at what points along those 
paths are there transactions through which you deliver your service?
The customer journey map (CJM; see Chapter 4) is an excellent design-
thinking tool for mapping not only the customer journey, but also your 
service delivery process. If you’ve already completed a CJM for your business, 
bring the flip-chart pages out of your file drawer—or print out the digital 
photos you took of your completed map on the white board—and use 
them for reference. To incorporate your CJM into service design, you 
need to go a level deeper and add details of how your service is delivered 
to the customer.
There can be multiple starting points and service delivery pathways with 
any business. In our scenario, we’ll compare and contrast two  pathways. 
Both start online, and one remains online through the duration of the 
transaction, whereas the other goes offline to complete the service  delivery 
in person.
Your entrepreneur customer goes online and reviews the content of your 
website (a pretty common occurrence in any business sector). Again, 
focusing on the mechanisms of service delivery and its roots in efficiency 
and effectiveness, how well does your website perform? Do the pages 
load quickly? Is the information clear and easy to understand? Is it clear to 
the customer what her next step needs to be to engage your company?

Design Thinking for Entrepreneurs and Small Businesses
71
In our example, the entrepreneur reads on your website that to receive 
further information and a cost estimate, the next step is to submit  
an inquiry about services, describing what type of assistance she needs 
(see Figure 6-1). Is it clear via the copy and design how she is to submit 
that inquiry? Once she clicks on the link or button on the website, a  
fill-in-the-blank form pops up, with a request to provide as much information 
as possible. Are the form’s fields defined in such a way that it guides her 
through providing the information, ensuring that you get the information 
you need?
Figure 6-1.  Inquiry form for service delivery

Chapter 6 | Designing Services and Service Delivery
72
The form the customer receives—with defined fields—is designed to 
make service delivery efficient (Figure 6-1). By prompting the customer 
to provide detail up front and in a way that is helpful to you potentially will 
minimize the amount of communication needed before you can provide 
a cost estimate, thus making the delivery of service at this point more 
effective.
Once you have received the customer’s form, identify how you will deliver 
the next level of service: the cost quote and the solution to the customer’s  
problem. At this point the service delivery pathways can diverge into 
online-only and online/offline formats. As the service provider, you have a 
decision to make: how do your transactions need to happen? If research 
indicates that your customers prefer the efficiency of a completely online 
service experience, then that is the delivery pathway you design and pro-
vide. Alternatively, if research indicates that your customers are more 
likely to contract your services after meeting and conducting business in 
person, then you design your delivery pathway to start online and then 
move offline to close the deal. What if you don’t have any research that 
indicates a preference? You can offer both and evaluate which means of 
service delivery performs better for you, or you can offer the service 
delivery that you prefer and monitor it closely to ensure you are able to 
meet your business goals.
In the virtual assistant services example, the steps along each pathway 
would have more differences than similarities (Figure 6-2). However you 
design service delivery, scrutinize the efficiency and effectiveness of each 
transaction point along the path. Not only do you want to ensure that the 
process is cost-effective for your business, you also want to minimize the 
risk of your customer abandoning the transaction altogether.

73
Risk of Abandonment
The phrase “abandon rate” has infiltrated many e-commerce ­conversations 
over the past five years, and it refers to how often an online customer 
starts but does not complete a shopping transaction. It’s an alarming trend 
for businesses, and online retailers follow the data closely. Although it 
is well known that the “death rate” of customer transactions by aban-
donment is high for product-based businesses, I argue that the rates are 
likely higher among service-based businesses. Why? In my experience, the 
transaction points require a deeper level of engagement on the part of 
the customer before he or she has committed to the purchase. The form 
requires detail so that the next transaction is more effective. Providing 
that level of detail requires the customer to spend more time and thought 
early in the process and thus elevates the risk of abandonment.
Should we allow that risk to influence us to shorten the inquiry form and 
request less detail from the customer? There are arguments for yes and 
no. I am in the “no” camp; let me tell you why.
Figure 6-2.  Service delivery pathways

Chapter 6 | Designing Services and Service Delivery
74
A service-based business by nature is more hands-on and generally 
requires more investment on the part of the business to complete a 
transaction (salespeople will tell you it’s harder to sell a service than a 
product). As a business owner, I would opt to spend my investment on 
customers who are more engaged and by extension better prospects.  
A customer who has completed a more detailed form as part of an inquiry 
about my services demonstrates that deeper engagement.
Should we allow the risk of abandonment to influence us in how we design 
service delivery? Absolutely. I would be arrogant—and irresponsible—to 
suggest that service-based businesses don’t need to be concerned about 
abandonment. The key here is to balance the business’s need to invest in 
potential customers with the need to operate effectively and successfully. 
As one of my mentors would say, “Choose your battles.”
In the war on abandonment, how do you identify which battles are worth 
fighting? I recommend using your CJM with the service delivery details 
and working with your team to identify points along the path at which 
customers may abandon the transaction. Any transaction point at which 
the customer has to make a decision is a potential abandonment point 
(see Figure 6-3).
Figure 6-3.  Potential abandonment points

Design Thinking for Entrepreneurs and Small Businesses
75
Returning to the virtual assistant service example, abandonment can 
occur at many points, the first of which is when the customer reviews the 
website. As I noted earlier, if your pages load slowly, the information isn’t 
clear, or there’s no clear indication of what a potential customer should 
do to continue the transaction, the potential customer could bail. The 
detailed inquiry form could be an abandonment point. The cost estimate 
could also be an abandonment point. And so on.
Your challenge as a business owner or entrepreneur is to evaluate those 
potential abandonment points and prioritize them. For example, do you 
feel (and if you’ve done target market research, you likely know) that your 
prospective customer wants to be able to choose her own assistant from 
among the pool of resources you offer? Allow for that functionality. Is your 
prospective customer more likely to balk at the cost and potentially 
abandon the transaction at the cost estimate point? Consider redesigning 
the way you deliver that part of your service—presenting the estimate—via 
a meeting with the potential customer.
Summary
Although service delivery and customer experience may seem like two 
sides of the same coin, they are in fact distinct aspects of business and demand 
individual attention. To best design the way your business delivers the 
service(s) it provides, acknowledge that the devil is in the details. Focus 
on the mechanics of how your services are delivered, with emphasis on 
efficiency and effectiveness for you and your customer. Well-delivered 
services produce great customer experiences.

Designing 
Marketing
More Than Meets the Eye
Proper, purposeful marketing is an integral part of a business’s success.  
It is also one of the most volatile, subjective, and misunderstood areas 
of business operations. Although largely considered the fun part of  
business—with logos, tag lines, advertising, promotional items, letterhead, 
and so on—marketing done well is much more than meets the eye.
My professional background is in marketing. This subject is one of my  
passions, bailiwicks, and soapboxes. The discipline of marketing encompasses 
much more than the promotional activities such as advertising, public  
relations, and graphic design that immediately come to mind. Marketing in 
its true form also includes pricing strategy, product or service development, 
and product/service distribution. However, for the purposes of our discussion, 
when I refer to “marketing,” I will be referring only to the promotional 
aspects of the discipline and how design thinking can enhance your efforts 
in that area.

Chapter 7 | Designing Marketing
78
Before you spend a penny on advertising, logo design, or any other marketing 
tactic, be sure you have a clearly articulated brand that you and your leader-
ship team know inside and out. Without a doubt, the cornerstone of solid, 
successful marketing is creating a well-defined brand, and it should inform 
every marketing decision you make. To promote your business without 
this cornerstone in place is a waste of money.
Contrary to popular belief, defining your brand doesn’t have to take forever 
or cost a fortune. By using design thinking tools, you can produce results 
quickly and efficiently. Once your brand is defined and in place, design 
thinking can help you create and execute marketing plans for products and 
services successfully.
Rapid Branding
Know this: your business’s brand is not a logo or a business card. Those 
are merely visual representations of your brand. Rather, your brand is your 
business’s personality, the embodiment of what your company stands for 
and is known for. Your brand is what distinguishes you from your compe-
tition. When you market your brand, you are promoting that distinction, 
emphasizing your advantages to the customer, and positioning your brand 
as the solution to the customer’s problem.
Accurately defining your brand can be accomplished in an afternoon 
with your senior leadership team or other important stakeholders using 
a design thinking activity called Microscoping. This activity helps you 
uncover your brand’s DNA by exploring both the rational and emotional 
sides of your brand, drilling down to inviolate philosophies that reside at 
the core of your brand and form its essence.
Defining the DNA
In the numerous times I have facilitated a Microscoping exercise, the first 
question from the team is invariably, “Are we defining the brand as it is 
now, or as it should be?” That one question immediately reveals that a 
brand is not in prime health. If the brand isn’t the way it should be, there’s 
no need to define it in its current state. Instead, define the brand as it 
needs to be.
The Microscoping exercise requires a white board (or flip charts), markers,  
and at least two hours of uninterrupted time with your leadership team. 
Prior to gathering your group, draw the chart shown in Figure 7-1, which 
will be populated during the exercise.

Design Thinking for Entrepreneurs and Small Businesses
79
The top half of the chart focuses on the rational aspects of the brand: 
what it does, how it could be described, and the facts and symbols that 
support the rational aspects. The bottom half focuses on the emotional 
aspects of the brand: how the brand makes the customer look, how it 
makes the customer feel, and its personality. At the center of the chart 
are three to five adjectives that describe the core essence of the brand, 
critical aspects that are never compromised.
Unlike other design thinking examples in previous chapters, this particu-
lar exercise requires a precise workflow for the best results. Starting 
with the top half of the chart, begin in the upper left quadrant and have 
your team define what your product or service does or provides in con-
crete, descriptive terms. To illustrate this process, we’ll use a health care  
services start-up as an example. This start-up provides portable digital 
medical records, physician referrals, scheduling, and billing intermediation 
direct to consumers who join the program via a paid annual subscription.
Next, have your team define how the customer would describe the 
product. The health care start-up might be described as:
a source of information, 
• 
seems complicated but isn’t, 
• 
better access to physicians, 
• 
Figure 7-1.  Microscoping brand DNA chart

Chapter 7 | Designing Marketing
80
worth the membership fee, and 
• 
responsive to questions.
• 
Now, consider the contents of the upper segments. What symbols and facts 
support the statements made? For example, symbols might include a USB 
drive, a medical bill, and a company representative on the phone. Facts might 
include, “patient access to all records,” and “15 percent average reduction in 
patient out-of-pocket expenses,” among others (see Figure 7-2).
Figure 7-2.  Microscoping brand DNA chart with rational aspects defined
Moving to the bottom half of the chart and beginning with the lower left 
box (Figure 7-2), describe how the customer thinks they look when they 
are associated with the brand. With our health care start-up example, 
descriptors of the customer could include technology-savvy, organized, 
sick, and needs help. Next, have your team describe how the customer 
feels when they are associated with the brand, and fill in the lower 
right segment. For our example, descriptors might include empowered, 
safe, thankful, informed, and helpless. Considering the content of the  
bottom segments, have your team describe the personality of the brand. 
Our health care start-up’s brand personality might be described as helpful, 
friendly, knowledgeable, and accessible.
With all of the quadrants complete (Figure 7-3), and the facts, symbols, 
and personality described, the team moves to the center of the chart,

where the core of the brand is defined. The discussion must focus on the 
aspects of the brand that the business must never abandon to keep itself 
distinct from its competition, relevant to its customer, and viable to its 
stakeholders.
At this point in the Microscoping activity, the conversation gets more  
difficult. You and your team must winnow the information in the boxes 
down into a core that contains an immune, bite-size conviction. This is no 
easy process. Teams inevitably lean toward defining the core too expan-
sively. However, it is important to embrace the reality that your brand 
cannot be all things to all people. As a former colleague of mine used to 
say, you have to stick a stake in the ground and stand by it. The core of 
your brand is your stake in the ground.
Tip
 
■
 If you’re using flip charts for the Microscoping exercise, consider using a pencil when 
defining the core. You’ll probably have revisions as the team discusses the core aspects. Once 
the team has agreed on the final content, go back and add that in with a marker. You’ll have a 
better-looking final document.
To best define the brand’s core, use key words from the content in the 
graph. For longer statements and phrases, use words that succinctly  
capture their essence. Those key words for our health care example 
could be helpful, knowledgeable, data, access, technology, referrals, empowered, 
and safe. However, eight words are too many. It becomes too large of a

conviction to be able to support sustainably. The challenge is to narrow 
that list to no more than five, so the team ultimately asks themselves the 
hard question, “What is absolutely mandatory for our brand’s success?” 
The answers form your brand’s DNA.
Now that you have your brand’s DNA defined, use it as your ­touchstone 
for all communications—internal and external—as well as product or 
service development. With our health care example, let’s say we whittled 
the list down to these three: access, helpful, and safe (Figure 7-4). In adver-
tising, staff newsletters, web content, and so on, the key messages the 
company conveys would always support at least one of the key words. 
Furthermore, as the product development team fleshes out the ­offerings 
to the company’s members, they would measure their efforts against 
those key words. For example, they might ask themselves in the process, 
“Is this product designed to reinforce our brand’s core?”

A Family of Brands
Just because you operate a small business or are an entrepreneur with 
a start-up does not mean that you won’t need to design and manage 
­multiple brands. It is important to use the Microscoping exercise for each 
brand in your company’s portfolio. They may have some commonalities, 
but I guarantee they will have their distinctions, and those need to be 
defined and articulated. Don’t take shortcuts and assume that because 
you defined your company’s brand DNA that the new product you added 
or the competitor you acquired will share it.

Design Thinking for Entrepreneurs and Small Businesses
83
To best illustrate this, let’s look an example of a much larger company 
that operates on a global scale: Procter & Gamble. All companies have 
a starting point, and Procter & Gamble (P&G) is no exception. It was 
once a small(ish) company like yours. Today, though, the company’s brand  
portfolio is large and diverse with brands ranging from Tide and Downy to 
Secret and Tampax. A review of statements that dominate P&G’s website 
reveals that its corporate brand DNA focuses on value, innovation, and 
sustainability.1 As a consumer, think about P&G’s brand DNA in relation 
to Tampax. At Tampax’s core is the brand about value, innovation, and  
sustainability? No. Tampax’s marketing and branding statements emphasize 
confidence and freedom. However, Tampax does share innovation as a 
characteristic of its brand DNA, thus keeping the product relevantly tied 
to its parent company. Tide also embraces innovation as part of its brand 
DNA, keeping it tied to P&G. In fact, you’ll see the innovation thread 
­running through all P&G product brands.
When a company has a portfolio of more than one brand, you can look 
at it as a family of brands. As with the P&G example, the parent company 
shares some of its DNA with its offspring—brands—just as the parents 
of a family share genetic material with their children. Obviously not all 
children in a family are identical replicas of the parents; each sibling is  
different, but they share some commonalities that indicate they are part 
of the same family and of the same parents. The same applies to a parent 
company such as P&G. Its brands share some commonalities, but each 
brand is different in its own right.
As your company expands, keep this family perspective in mind. You want 
each brand to be resonant of the parent brand’s DNA, but you need 
to define them on their own terms so they can grow, strengthen, and 
­succeed independently of the parent company.
Designing a Marketing Plan 
With your brand DNA defined and articulated for the entire world (or at 
least your world) to see, you can confidently design a marketing plan that 
will appropriately support your brand. Your brand DNA is your touchstone, 
and your marketing plan is your roadmap. Its entire purpose is to get you 
from point A (where your business and brand is now) to point B (where 
you want it to go/what you want to achieve).

Imagine heading off on a road trip with a destination in mind but only a 
general sense of how to get there and nothing to guide you. How many 
times might you take a wrong turn, have to backtrack, end up taking a 
much longer and circuitous route, and arrive stressed and late to your 
destination? Contrast that experience with a road trip for which you have  
directions and landmarks, and an accurate determination of the length of your 
trip so that you arrive at your destination energized and ready to go?
I have always followed a formulaic approach to designing a marketing  
plan. It keeps me on task and prevents overlooking key factors relevant to 
the plan. However, the resulting document can vary in length ­depending 
on the scope of the marketing effort and the level of detail put into 
the plan. Before you start designing a plan, consider your audience: for 
whom is this plan intended? A leadership team well versed in your brand’s 
DNA, your target market, your marketing goal, your budget, and your key 
­performance indicators may need less detail than a collaborative team 
comprised of leaders from different departments, vendors, or others not 
involved in your company’s daily operations. Let your audience be your 
guide when determining the level of detail to include in the plan. A marketing 
plan template is provided in the resources section of this book, Appendix D, 
for your use.
The Business Case
The opening section of a well-designed marketing plan is pretty cut 
and dried: what is the business case for what you want to accomplish? 
Generally a paragraph or two, this section is a brief summary of the justi-
fication of your marketing plan. Use data to support your case and answer 
the question, “Why do we need to market this?”—particularly if you are 
marketing a specific product or service. Returning to our health care 
start-up example, the business case could center on reducing the time 
and expense required to navigate the health care system.
Strategic Overview
Follow your business case with a description of your business, product, 
or service and why it effectively satisfies the business case. This section 
is also typically a paragraph or two in length. For our example, the health 
care start-up’s services are designed to intermediate on behalf of patients 
and give them access to resources to more easily navigate the health care 
system.

Design Thinking for Entrepreneurs and Small Businesses

Marketing Objectives
Next, outline your marketing objectives. You can describe these or simply 
list them as bullet points. These objectives should illustrate the “big picture”  
you want to accomplish with this marketing plan. In the case of our  
example, the marketing objectives could be to:
increase awareness of the start-up’s services among 
• 
the target markets, 
position the start-up as the solution to the ­customer’s 
• 
frustrations, and 
add 200 new members. 
• 
Stating marketing objectives—at the very least, one of them—in terms 
that can be measured is important, as you’ll discover further into this 
chapter.
Communications Objectives
These objectives are more granular in detail than the marketing objectives. 
They focus on the tactical approach to communications that the company will 
take to satisfy the marketing objectives. You can describe these objectives  
or list them as bullet points. Our start-up example’s communications 
objectives could include planning and launching a customer-directed, highly 
targeted, direct-response campaign and implementing a public and media 
relations effort to increase awareness of their services.
Target Audiences
Your business will probably have more than one target audience. 
Remember, though, that you want the best return on your marketing 
investment, so you want to keep your marketing plan focused on the one 
or two audiences that will provide you with the greatest opportunity for 
return. The research you’ve conducted (see Chapter 2) will guide you in 
describing your primary—and perhaps your secondary—target audience. 
In this section, you provide a narrative description of the target audience, 
as well as any relevant demographic data. For our health care start-up, the 
primary target audience may be married women, ages twenty-five to fifty, 
employed outside of the home, with children under the age of eighteen, 
who have visited a physician, medical clinic, or hospital at least three times 
within the past twelve months.

Chapter 7 | Designing Marketing
86
Marketing Strategies
In this section, the plan begins to show some greater detail with more 
specification as to how the team will go about accomplishing the marketing 
objectives. The marketing strategies you outline should be broad strokes 
of activity, such as designing the communications with a consistent theme 
that also drives customer inquiries to a campaign-specific web address 
through which customers can access more detail and the company can 
capture customer data. Notice that the details of what that theme entails 
or the design of the communication devices are not included at this point. 
To provide that level of detail at this early stage of planning would be 
premature.
Key and Supporting Messages
This section can be included in the marketing plan, or it can be omitted 
depending on the process you and/or your team went through in design-
ing the plan. If, during the plan design phase, you hit on the key customer 
message—and any supporting messages—to meet the plan’s objectives, 
this section is where you would describe it and any specific word choices 
that should be used in customer-directed communication. For example, 
with the health care start-up, that key message could be about provid-
ing confidential and helpful support to aid members in accessing needed 
health care resources.
Tactical Plan
Now it’s time to outline the nitty-gritty details of your marketing plan. 
Whereas the previous sections of your plan serve as your overarching 
guide, this section gets granular in its detail. In your tactical plan, you artic-
ulate what you’ll do to follow your strategies and use your key messages 
to accomplish your objectives. Open your tactical plan by addressing all of 
the planned resources you’ll use to fulfill the plan’s objectives: advertising 
and promotional vehicles, community outreach activities, public and media 
relations efforts, and so on.
I encourage you to include as much detail as possible. With our health 
care start-up example, we might list highly targeted direct mail, a search 
engine marketing campaign, and social media advertising as three vehi-
cles through which the start-up will promote its services to its target  
audience. Although that list provides a nice overview to your promotional 
activities, make an effort to add specifics. For example, with regard to 
the direct mail tactic, the company might include detail on the format 

Design Thinking for Entrepreneurs and Small Businesses
87
of the direct mail piece itself (brochure, postcard, etc.), the source of 
the mailing list (Experian, health care provider partners, etc.), the mailing 
list parameters (the target audience demographics plus any behavioral 
qualifiers such as “active in outdoor sports” or “expecting a new child 
within the next six months”), and the frequency planned for the mailing 
(three separate pieces mailed within eight weeks). Do this for each of the 
resources you listed as tactics.
To accompany the detailed outline of resources to be used, create a  
timeline to delineate what happens and when. (I prefer to keep things 
simple and use a spreadsheet as a calendar, with each field representing 
one week.) Continuing with the start-up’s direct mail example, we would 
identify the dates on which we want the pieces to be sent and add the 
relevant dates for the other resources.
Measurement
The final section of your marketing plan should address how you will 
measure your efforts in all areas to determine their level of success. Nine 
times out of ten, our immediate response to the question, “What does 
success look like?” is “More ______________,” with the blank filled in 
by “sales,” “customers,” “accounts,” or “business.” We all want more, but 
we need to be specific in our marketing plan. I am a firm believer that 
marketing efforts alone cannot be responsible for generating new busi-
ness. There are too many other factors out of the purview of marketing 
that influence a customer’s buying decision. Marketing can and should be 
accountable for increasing awareness, influencing brand perception, and 
activating customer inquiries.

  Plan to measure all marketing efforts. How else will you know what's working and 
what isn’t?
When you have multiple tactics supporting your marketing plan, as with 
our start-up example, you need to decide if you want to measure the per-
formance of the marketing campaign as a whole or measure each tactic 
individually. For our start-up, measuring on the whole is as easy as tallying 
the number of new members acquired during the campaign and within 
thirty days after. If you want more detailed analysis and measurement, 
each of your resources needs to be measured in terms of key perfor-
mance indicators (KPIs) that are relevant and realistic for that resource.

Chapter 7 | Designing Marketing
88
To illustrate, let’s put this in terms of our start-up’s direct mail tactic.  
As stated in the marketing objectives, the company wanted to enroll  
200 new members. Can direct mail be solely responsible for producing 
those new members? No, that would be an unrealistic KPI. The direct 
mail might make a compelling case, but chances are good that only a  
small portion of recipients will become new members based on that one 
communication tactic. Probably more new members will originate through 
the other planned communication vehicles, as well as through inevitable 
phone inquiries for more information. (Never overlook the power of a 
personal conversation between a potential customer and one of your 
team members!)
Can direct mail be expected to drive customer inquiries, thus potentially 
generating new members? Absolutely, and that’s a reasonable KPI for 
that tactic. Now that the KPI for direct mail is established, how do you 
determine the quantity of inquiries the direct mail should generate? 
Fortunately, there are “industry standards” and best-practices expecta-
tions you can use as guidelines. For direct mail, the expected response 
rate, which is what yields your quantity of inquiries, is between 3 percent 
and 5 ­percent of the total number of pieces mailed. That translates into 
30 to 50 responses per 1,000 pieces mailed. The more targeted your 
mailing list, the more likely the response rate will be higher.
As you assign KPIs to your tactics, make note of the expected perfor-
mance. I often include this information on the tactical timeline/­calendar, 
updating it weekly, so I can visualize progress during the duration of the 
marketing campaign.
The Doctor Is In
Throughout this book, I’ve emphasized the importance of understanding 
your customers, their wants, and their needs so that you can design your 
business and its products or services as the solutions. You need that same 
understanding for successful branding and marketing. You must under-
stand your primary customer to define your brand in terms that they will 
find resonant, which will lead to affinity and preference.
At some point in your business’s life cycle, you’ll encounter an inevitable  
ebb in your success, and there could be any number of causes for this.  
Among all of the introspection and analysis you will deploy during slow  
times, be sure to include a health check-up for your brand. A brand that 
is healthy, that is, relevant, recognized, and profitable, is one of the many 
business Sherpas that carry your business along the path to success.  
A brand that is unhealthy can be your undoing even when all else is 
going well.

Design Thinking for Entrepreneurs and Small Businesses
89
Determining your brand’s health status requires some serious introspec-
tion, a willingness to inquire of and listen to others, and an open mind 
receptive to what is shared. The best way to undergo a brand health 
check-up is with an activity called The Doctor Is In. This activity requires 
you and your team to answer some hard-hitting questions in descriptive 
detail to best ascertain what “ails” your brand. The doctor asks questions 
to uncover the symptoms of the ailment. If the first round of answers 
don’t provide sufficient detail, the doctor probes deeper with follow-up 
questions such as, “Then what happens?,” “What changes did you see?,” 
and “Why or why not?” The following list consists of core questions for 
the doctor to pose to yourself and your team. It was born from my pro-
fessional perspective and evaluation process, and feel free to modify it as 
you see best for your unique business. I strongly recommend you use a 
moderator to serve as the doctor. For fun, I always draw a graphic that 
resembles Lucy’s “psychiatric help” stand from the Peanuts comic strip 
and put the answers to the questions in the center (Figure 7-5).

The Doctor Is In Questionnaire
1.	 How is your business changing? Are you merging, 
changing your product or service offerings, or revis-
ing your strategic plan? Has customer attrition been 
higher than normal?
2.	 How is your market changing? Are there changes that 
affect your customers’ behavior? Are you facing new 
or increased competition?
3.	 Is your industry becoming commoditized?
4.	 Is your core customer base changing? Do you have 
different customers now than you did five years ago?
5.	 If you ask ten people closely associated with your 
business, “What is our mission?” will you get ten  
different answers? Or worse, blank stares?
6.	 Do your communications (brochures, manuals, adver-
tisements, promotional pieces) present consistent 
messaging? Or do they look like they could be from 
different companies?
7.	 Do you lack comprehensive brand and messaging 
guidelines that are consistently used by everyone 
internally and externally who are creating communi-
cations materials?
8.	 Can you tell your business’s story in three minutes  
or less?
Notice that the first and second questions focus on how change is happen-
ing, not if it is. Change always takes place; it’s the pace of it that changes.  
If your business or market is changing more rapidly than you can keep 
pace, you have some fundamental operations issues to address; put your 
brand on the back burner until that is resolved.
If the third and fourth questions give you cause to stop and think, you may 
not be paying close enough attention to the change that surrounds you, 
and your brand is suffering for it. You might consider reviewing Chapter 3 
and adjusting your business strategy as needed to accommodate the shifts 
in your industry and customer base.
Questions five through eight are all communications-based and directly 
related to your brand’s health on a micro level. Even if you have pressing 
macro issues that have been revealed with the first four questions, you can 
work immediately on a short-term remedy for your brand in this area.

Design Thinking for Entrepreneurs and Small Businesses
91
The essence of marketing is the ability to tell a compelling story, and 
telling it in a way that is relevant to customers and your own team. As 
business owners and entrepreneurs, we often overlook the importance 
of telling our story internally. We often think that because our team is 
immersed in our business daily, they know the story and understand its 
meaning. That isn’t always the case. If others closely associated with your 
business—employees, leadership, and key vendors—can’t share a synopsis 
of your story, you need to tell it to your internal audiences more fre-
quently and more comprehensively.
If your communications materials aren’t presenting a consistent message 
and image, then not only are they not sufficiently supporting the story you 
and your team are telling, they are also not telling an accurate story in 
the absence of the narrators. Communications materials absolutely must 
tell your story, emphasizing strengths, differentiators and compelling facts, 
on their own. They also must present a visual image consistent with the  
attributes of your brand. This applies to materials presented to customers  
as well as internal documents.
An easy (and, sadly, prevalent) example to point out is a business’s email 
signature, because email is used both externally and internally. How many 
times have you seen variations of an email signature sent from a company-
based email address? One may have the full-color logo and another with 
none. One sender may include the business’s website address and no 
social media links, and another sender may leave off the website but still 
include the social media links. Confusing, isn’t it?
Last, as the head honcho of your business, you must be able to tell your 
story to anyone of any background succinctly and effectively. Yes, I’m 
referring to the fabled and often-maligned elevator pitch. Your short story, 
so to speak, will be a necessity for the life span of your business, and if 
you can’t nail it, you certainly can’t expect others to do so. Practice if you 
need to. Craft variations on a theme so you’re prepared for any type of 
listener, from your barber to the angel investor you lucked upon in the 
conference center hallway.
Summary
Marketing provides the opportunity to tell your brand story in a purpose-
ful way to the audiences who will most likely find the greatest meaning 
and relevance within it. Just as with other aspects of your business, design 
thinking provides valuable perspective and guidance to help you achieve 
the best outcomes. From discovering and defining your brand’s DNA 
through Microscoping to evaluating your brand’s health with The Doctor 
Is In, design thinking tools can put you and your team in the much-desired 
position of market leader.

Designing for 
Change
Don’t Get Caught Off-Guard
Change is inevitable. Even if you dig in your heels and fight it every step 
of the way, change still happens. It can seem interminably slow, or faster 
than the speed of light. The sheer number of clichés and colloquialisms to 
describe change is an indication of its inevitability. We’ve grasped at gram-
matical straws to come to terms with the flow of change. It’s important 
to understand that change doesn’t have to happen to you. I encourage you 
to use design thinking tools to make change happen for you and for your 
business’s success.
Going Beyond Your Gut
Many of us have a strong gut instinct, and most of us tend to follow it.  
I think it’s one of the more distinctive qualities of entrepreneurs and small 
business owners—knowing that you have a great idea and being willing to 
take a leap of faith to make a business out of it. Successful entrepreneurs 
and business owners back up their gut instincts with smart and diligent 
business planning.
Changes in market conditions, economies, industries, and niches don’t have 
to catch you unaware and unprepared. Regardless of the scope of change, 
you can anticipate it, stay attuned to its subtleties, and take purposeful steps 
toward using it to your benefit.

  If it seems as though nothing is changing, then you aren’t looking closely enough.
Up to this point, the opportunities to apply design thinking principles to 
the development of products, services, experiences, marketing, and physi-
cal spaces have been pretty clear. Needs and challenges could be identified 
and articulated, and uncovering potential solutions could be approached 
methodically. Facing change and designing for it is quite a different sce-
nario. Change can be rife with ambiguity, making it harder to pinpoint how 
you can intervene in its emergence and purposefully design your response 
to it. All the more reason to employ design thinking.
Facing Change Head-On
You’ve heard the bit about not seeing the forest for the trees. There’s legit-
imacy in that idiom, as you have probably experienced. All too often, as we 
are immersed in our own daily ins and outs of operating our ­businesses, 
we focus only on what is within our immediate view, the “trees:” next 
week’s payroll, next season’s futures, last month’s sales figures, next year’s 
goals. Meanwhile, we have little idea what might be happening in the forest 
because we aren’t looking. The “forest”—the bigger economic picture—may 
be undergoing radical change that could yield either great opportunity or 
portend disaster.
How do you see the forest and not just the trees, then? Use the Forest 
and Trees design thinking activity.
At its root, the Forest and Trees activity is a sorting tool, albeit on a 
big-picture scale. Use it to distinguish between issues with shorter-term, 
more intimate ramifications and those issues that have the potential to 
have a more profound effect not only on your business, but also on the 
economic environment in which you operate.
Gather your leadership team for this activity, which can typically be com-
pleted in less than two hours. Using two flip charts, or a large white 
board divided in half, label the left side “Trees” and the right side “Forest” 
(Figure 8-1). Provide your team with stacks of sticky notes and ask them 
to list all of the issues that consume the majority of their time, one per 
sticky note. This should not be a list of what the participants do each day, 
but a list of the challenges they face on a regular basis and that require 
their time and attention. The information contributed can vary widely, 
encompassing everything from human resources and team management 
to product development and operations. Assemble the sticky notes into 
themes—all of the operations issues together, and so on—and arrange 
them under the Trees heading.
g

Design Thinking for Entrepreneurs and Small Businesses
95
Now it’s time to view your trees in the context of the forest. Working 
through one theme at a time, have your team evaluate each issue for 
its relevance to the larger environment. For example, let’s say a ­financial 
­planning firm has identified trees and sorted them into the following 
themes: human resources, sales, and industry regulations. As the team 
works through the human resources theme, they are particularly vocal 
on the issue of talent acquisition and the increasingly difficult process of 
identifying and attracting the knowledgeable and skilled professionals they 
need to grow the business. The question to ask: “Is talent acquisition an 
issue beyond our business?”
To determine the answer, the team needs to have some working ­knowledge 
of the greater economic environment and developments in their ­specific 
industry. Is the topic of talent acquisition in relevant news sources? Is 
it a topic of conversation and industry-related events? Within the past 
year, have they found themselves in a bidding war for talent with a 
competitor outside their market? Positive responses to these types of 
questions likely indicate that the issue is affecting the forest, so a sticky 
note with talent acquisition would then be posted to the Forest side of  
the board.
Figure 8-1.  Forest and trees chart, in progress

Chapter 8 | Designing for Change
96
Keep working through each theme on the Trees side until they have all 
been evaluated and duplicated for the Forest side of your board as needed. 
Once you are finished with the trees, it’s time to expand your perspective 
and evaluate the forest by asking your team, “What issues are you seeing 
or hearing about that haven’t affected us yet?” Again, working knowledge 
of the bigger economic environment and your industry is necessary for 
effectiveness. As you did with the trees section, list each forest issue on 
sticky notes, one per note, and sort them by theme on the Forest side of 
your board (Figure 8-2).
Figure 8-2.  Forest and trees chart, completed
Once your forest issues have been identified, it’s time to evaluate them 
in the context of the trees. Consider the financial planning firm example. 
Perhaps the team listed recently passed legislation in a state in which the 
firm does not operate. They would need to answer the question, “What 
is the likelihood that similar legislation could pass in our state, and how 
would it affect our business?” If the team determines that the likelihood is 
high, the next step is to write the issue on another sticky note and post it 
on the dividing line between forest and trees.
At the conclusion of the Forest and Trees activity, you and your team will 
have a map of sorts that will help you visualize the larger “forest” issues, 
that is, impending change, that could have ramifications for your business,  
which will help you in taking the next steps toward designing for that 
change.

Design Thinking for Entrepreneurs and Small Businesses
97
The Need for Speed
The Forest and Trees activity can be somewhat intense because you 
and your team are immersed in a lot of deep, evaluative thought. You’ve 
seen the forest and the changes approaching on the horizon. Seeing isn’t 
enough, though. Your team needs to be able to respond to that approaching 
change. To do that, and to enjoy an exercise that provides some mental 
and emotional balance to the intensity of Forest and Trees, follow with a 
faster-paced design thinking exercise called 3-12-3.
The 3-12-3 exercise is a three-part activity in which strict timekeeping 
is the main rule, and the numbers refer to the amount of time allot-
ted for each part: three minutes for generating ideas, twelve minutes 
for combining those ideas into rough concepts, and three minutes again  
for presenting the concepts to a group. The process is all brainstorming,  
but the approach to it is focused and fast, forcing the participants to  
generate ideas quickly without a lot of overthinking.
To start the activity, identify the problem, opportunity, or issue for which 
you need some potential solutions and state it in no more than two 
words. Although you could identify the issue with a descriptive sentence 
or phrase, resist this temptation. Keeping it limited to just two words  
supports the brevity of the activity. Referring back to our financial planning  
firm example, let’s say that the issue at hand is “talent acquisition.” On a 
white board or flip chart, write “Talent Acquisition” as the heading. If you 
have more than five team members participating in this exercise, divide 
them into equal-size groups, but don’t have more than three groups total.
Next, give each of your participants a marker and a stack of sticky notes, 
along with the direction to generate as many ideas as possible in three 
minutes for how they and the company might be able to solve the issue 
of talent acquisition. Once those three minutes are up, be firm about 
­stopping the brainstorming. (Remember, speed is important in this activity!) 
For our financial planning firm example, some of those ideas could include 
developing a proprietary training program, partnering with a local college 
or university to ensure its curriculum aligns with current industry needs, 
or hiring a full-time recruiter in the company’s human resources office.
Following the three-minute brainstorming, give participants twelve minutes 
to organize their ideas and group them into themes. Our financial ­planning 
firm example may group its ideas into themes like education, staffing 
needs, or internal training (Figure 8-3). As participants sort their ideas 
into themes, they can sketch, draw, or otherwise visualize their ideas to 
better communicate the concepts, with the goal of being able to commu-
nicate them clearly to the larger group in the last part of this exercise.

Chapter 8 | Designing for Change
98
Furthermore, as they work through the sorting process, they will discover 
how the ideas may be interrelated and may see additional ­opportunities. 
If the sorting portion of the 3-12-3 exercise spurs new ideas, have 
your participants capture those ideas but keep them separate for later  
consideration. If you see your participants starting to brainstorm during 
this twelve-minute period, redirect them back to sorting the ideas that 
have already been generated.
The last three-minute section of the exercise can take one of two paths. 
If your group of participants was large enough to be divided into sepa-
rate smaller groups, then the smaller groups each have three minutes to 
report on their ideas and how their thought process worked—quickly 
and succinctly! Again, each group has only three minutes for this part.  
If your team is smaller and they all worked together as one unit, these 
three minutes can be spent synthesizing the themes or summarizing the 
conclusions drawn during the sorting segment of the activity.
To conclude the 3-12-3 activity, collectively reflect and discuss what ideas 
were shared, but don’t be satisfied with just reflection. Take the oppor-
tunity to make the effort that went into the activity actionable. Save 
the sticky notes from 3-12-3 and use them in the next design thinking 
exercise.

The Matrix Holds the Answers 
If you have gone through the previous two design thinking activities,  
you and your team have seen the approaching changes (a.k.a. the ­forest) 
and generated ideas of how to best respond. To make your efforts 
­actionable, you need to evaluate your concepts and select those in which 
the company should invest more time and resources. The Impact and 
Effort Matrix is an excellent design thinking tool for helping teams choose 
among its options.
The Impact and Effort Matrix is a decision-making exercise in which ­possible 
actions are evaluated and mapped based on two qualities: the effort required 
to implement the action, and the action’s potential effect on the group’s 
issue, opportunity, or challenge. Some actions may be inexpensive and easy 
to implement but may make very little impact. Others may be expensive 
but have a sizable long-term payoff that justifies the expense. Categorizing 
actions in this manner helps decisions get made, because participants 
must balance and evaluate potential actions reasonably before committing 
to them.
On a white board or large flip chart, draw a large square. Label the left 
line of the large square “Impact,” and label the bottom line “Effort.” Place 
a minus sign at the intersection of these two lines. At the opposite end of 
each line, place a plus sign (Figure 8-4).
Figure 8-4.  Impact and Effort Matrix chart, in progress

Chapter 8 | Designing for Change

Now divide the large square into four smaller squares. In the upper left 
quadrant, draw a happy face. In the lower right square, draw a sad face.  
In the upper right and lower left quadrants, draw questioning faces. 
Now, the matrix is ready to accommodate mapping the team’s ideas 
(Figure 8-5).
Figure 8-5.  Impact and Effort Matrix chart, ready for input
To open the exercise, ask the group a question, which can be as simple 
as “What do we need to reach our goal?” For the financial planning firm 
and its challenge with talent acquisition, the question might be “How do 
we find the talent we need?” Ask the group to generate ideas individually 
on sticky notes, and add those to the notes you saved from the 3-12-3 
­activity, discarding any duplicates.
Ask the group to present their ideas and place them within the Impact 
and Effort Matrix according to their perception of the amount of effort 
required to implement the ideas and the degree of impact those ideas are 
likely to have (Figure 8-6).

Design Thinking for Entrepreneurs and Small Businesses
101
As participants place their ideas into the matrix, they may—and should—
openly discuss the position of the ideas. The group might strengthen an 
idea and therefore move it up in impact or down in effort. An idea might 
also be degraded and moved up in effort or down in impact. Ultimately, 
the collective wisdom, experience, and opinion of the group will direct 
the idea to its proper position within the matrix. In this respect, the  
high-impact/low-effort square will house the ideas to which the group 
is most committed, and those ideas should be considered the most 
actionable.
Note
■
■
  Collaboration and cooperation is critical in the matrix.
Returning to our financial planning firm and its talent acquisition example, 
ideas that could reside in the high-impact/low-effort square could include 
such things as an internal training program, a more rigorous evaluation of 
skills during the interviewing process, and developing a list of educational 
institutions whose curricula align best with the firm’s skill set needs.

Summary
As entrepreneurs, business owners, and humans, we are surrounded by 
ongoing change whether or not we acknowledge it. Change cannot be 
stopped. Rather than be stymied by it, we can use design thinking  principles 
and tools to help us meet head-on the challenges and opportunities 
spawned by change, prepared and unafraid. From large-scale change that 
affects entire economies or smaller-scale change that affects only our  businesses, 
designing our response to change enables us not only to tolerate it but 
also embrace it.

Designing for 
Growth
Minimize Growing Pains
By no means can growth be pain-free; it isn’t a reasonable expectation to 
think that could be possible. Think back to when you were a child and 
your arms and legs would occasionally—and seemingly randomly—ache 
for no apparent reason. If your mother was like mine, she described those 
aches as growing pains. If you were like I was, that answer seemed like 
the dumbest thing you had ever heard. Worse, you were powerless to 
prevent the ache.
When it comes to business, growing is accompanied by occasional aches 
and pains, just like in childhood. But with forethought and the purposeful 
application of design thinking tools that accommodate and embrace growth, 
you can minimize the growing pains and put your business and team in a 
position to capitalize on every opportunity that comes your way.
Note

thinking practices.
Why Growth Is Important
Growing a business can be overwhelming, intimidating, and challenging.  
It can be exhilarating and rewarding. It should also be a constant.

C H A P T E R 

Chapter 9 | Designing for Growth
104
Many of us will reach a point at which we are satisfied with the volume of 
business we conduct with the size of company we have and in the markets 
in which we operate. Reaching a point of satisfaction is a milestone that 
can and should be celebrated! However, without some continuing degree 
of growth, that milestone could turn into a gravestone. Growth is one of 
the key factors that keeps your business alive and thriving.
It’s imperative to understand that the opposite of growth is not stability. 
It isn’t even stagnation. The opposite of growth is loss. We do not live 
in a static world; change is a constant and it surrounds us all the time.  
My contention is that unless your business continually grows, you will 
experience loss. Let’s use a forest as an example.
A forest is composed of many trees, all of which are growing at ­varying 
rates. Is there a point at which all the trees decide that they are tall enough 
and just stop growing? No. Their growth is constant. Imagine, though, that 
one tree—we’ll call him George—decides that enough is enough, and he’s 
through with this growing stuff. He’s worked hard the past few decades 
to get where he is today—an admirably tall tree with well-formed, lush 
branches that attract many birds to nest there: the very definition of a 
successful tree. George is satisfied and happy and is ready to rest easy and 
enjoy the results of his growth.
Meanwhile, George’s neighbor trees keep growing. George notices small 
changes over the years as the other trees grow while he stays the same: 
some of the birds didn’t return to nest, and he doesn’t seem to be getting 
as much sunlight as before. As more time passes, those changes become 
more profound: less and less sunlight reaches through the branches above 
him on the trees that kept growing, making it very difficult to maintain his 
leafy, lush branches. His only wildlife residents are a pair of squirrels; the 
birds left for other trees and branches where the sun is brighter. Clearly, 
George isn’t thriving as he once was. He has lost his successful place amid 
the forest.
George realizes that to regain his previous success, he needs to grow, 
although now he’ll have to catch up to the neighbor trees. He notices that 
even the neighbor tree that seemed to be going nowhere is still taller and 
lusher than he, because it kept growing.
Will George be able to grow and catch up to the forest that surrounds 
him? Maybe, maybe not. What if he had kept growing? Even at a small rate, 
he would have continued to grow enough to at least keep up with the 
neighbor trees and not have lost his access to the resources he needed 
to sustain himself.

Design Thinking for Entrepreneurs and Small Businesses
105
I am not advocating for a “keeping up with the Joneses” approach to 
­business. What I am suggesting is that you recognize that a degree of 
growth is mandatory for sustainable business success. If you choose not 
to grow, you also choose to tolerate the inevitable loss.
Growing Gracefully
In this chapter, I recommend several design thinking activities geared 
toward embracing growth and growing your business at a modest rate.  
I believe that this is where the greater challenge lies. Rapid growth—that 
of the start-up variety—is an entirely different dynamic and probably one 
with which you as an entrepreneur and business owner are familiar.
I abhor the adage, “Hindsight is twenty-twenty.” It’s usually proffered in a 
rueful kind of way, and that isn’t helpful. However, the concept behind the 
adage has merit. Looking back at our history and mining that information 
for what has worked—and made us successful—in the past is a great 
starting point when designing for growth.
If your business is growing in staff size or expanding its current operating 
capacity, reviewing and documenting past events and successes as well as 
failures and missteps becomes an important process for charting effective 
growth. Visualizing that history aids your team in discovering, recognizing, 
articulating, appreciating, and potentially replicating the key components 
of what got the business to where it is today. The 20-20 exercise guides 
you in mapping those components and using them as a roadmap for future 
growth.
Hindsight Is 20-20
You can conduct the 20-20 exercise with as few as five people or as 
many as fifty. It is an accommodating format for larger groups, which is a 
rather uncommon feature among design thinking activities. Gather what 
you now know to be the requisite white board or flip charts, and the 
appropriate marker type, and several stacks of sticky notes. This exercise 
doesn’t require an outside moderator, so you can lead it yourself.
Start by drawing a continuous horizontal line across the width of the 
white board. If you’re using flip-chart paper, you’ll want to hang several 
pieces—end-to-end horizontally—to accommodate your line. This is 
your timeline. Several factors affect how you label. If yours is a young 
company, you might label the left end point with the year you started  
the company, and then mark the rest of in one-year increments. If yours 
is a more established company, you might label the left end point with  
the date of a key moment, like the year you launched a new product, and 

Chapter 9 | Designing for Growth
106
mark the rest of the timeline in five-year increments. There is no rule 
to follow other than label your timeline in a way that is relevant to your 
business.
Since we started this chapter illustrating the concept of growth with a 
forest, let’s use a plant nursery that’s been in business for six years as 
our example for the 20-20 activity. As with other activities, you should 
consider recording the session. The nursery’s timeline would start with 
the year the business launched, say, 2005, with one-year increments 
(Figure 9-1). Be sure to leave plenty of space above and below the time-
line and between each labeled increment, to allow for notes and written 
comments.
Figure 9-1.  20-20 timeline
Tip
■
■
  If there are years during which your business experienced significant changes, allow a 
little extra space than for other years.
Next, ask each participant to write his or her name and one or two 
words about their first impressions of the company on a sticky note, and 
post it on the timeline below the year that person joined the company 
(Figure 9-2). If you have a group of fewer than twelve, ask each person to 
share a brief story about joining the company as they post. Additionally, 
if your group includes staff that has been with the company since the 
beginning, pay especially close attention to their stories. Their historical 
perspective of the business is invaluable to this process.

Design Thinking for Entrepreneurs and Small Businesses
107
Now ask your team questions, and flesh out the map by capturing their 
answers—using text and images—on sticky notes and placing them at the 
appropriate points along the timeline (Figure 9-3). Encourage your team 
to provide as many answers as they can, but remember, just one answer or 
response per note. Potential topics could include the following:
1.	 Company successes
2.	 Company missteps
3.	 Lessons learned
4.	 Changes in leadership
5.	 Changes in mission, vision, or values
6.	 Changes in product or service offerings
7.	 Market trends
8.	 Competitive shifts
9.	 Major client acquisitions or losses
10.	 Shifts in revenue
11.	 Shifts in staff size
12.	 Major client projects
13.	 Internal reorganizations
14.	 Technology developments
15.	 Regulatory or legal changes
Figure 9-2.  20-20 timeline with team added

Chapter 9 | Designing for Growth
108
If you really want to be organized for this activity, consider ­assigning 
specific colors of sticky notes to represent categories of answers.  
For example, internal topics could be yellow, market-based and external 
topics could be blue, and lessons learned could be pink.
As you add sticky notes to the timeline, ask open-ended questions to 
stimulate thinking and keep the conversation going. Encourage storytelling 
and honesty, even about the hard times. If the process stalls, try reenergiz-
ing it with observations of your own.
Tip
■
■
  If you aren’t comfortable drawing—or feel like you can’t draw—then come up with 
some recognizable icons before the meeting. Visuals will aid the process and provide quick 
points of reference.
Once you have captured the group’s answers, summarize the ­information 
on the timeline and ask the group to identify patterns, share what  
they have learned, and say how they can leverage this information and 
Figure 9-3.  20-20 timeline with team input

Design Thinking for Entrepreneurs and Small Businesses
109
perspective for the company’s continued growth. You many need to ask 
questions to prompt the conversation. Some of those could be:
How have these patterns influenced the development 
• 
of the company? 
What is the most important lesson we have learned?
• 
At what point was the company most successful,  
• 
and why?
To conclude the 20-20 activity, ask your team to think about the com-
pany’s next steps moving forward. What is the most important thing 
the company can do next to capitalize on its history and leverage it for 
future success? Leave your timeline posted and have each participant post 
a response to your question at the far right end during the remainder 
of the day, and reconvene briefly at the end of the day to review them.  
Be sure to take photos of the final, completed timeline so you can refer 
back to it as needed.
Designing New Hires
Inevitably, with growth comes ambiguity. Leadership has a general idea of 
what they want and/or need as the company grows, but often it is difficult 
to define and clearly articulate. This applies to the growth of a company’s 
business operations, including product and service development, and also 
to the growth of its business support, namely, its staff. During a growth 
phase, you might know you need a new vice president of sales, but what 
does that mean to you? Sure, you can draft a job description that uses all 
of the key terms that a recruit would expect to see, but is that the best 
approach to sourcing the right person—not just the right skill set—to fill 
the role?
As powerful as design thinking is, its tools and activities are predominantly 
geared toward solving problems and meeting challenges in all aspects of 
business except those that are human. I find that puzzling because the 
largest expense for small businesses isn’t rent or production costs but 
payroll. Because of this, staffing deserves (and frankly is overdue for) a 
little design thinking love. To that end, I’ve adapted the Design the Box 
activity to address a business’s needs to grow its staff.
Normally, Design the Box is focused on developing a new product or 
service for a business from the perspective of first designing the box 
in which the product—or metaphorical box for a service—is delivered.  

Chapter 9 | Designing for Growth
110
The premise of the exercise is that if you design the box first, you can  
better articulate the features, benefits, and unique selling points that need 
to be embodied in the product.1
For the purpose of applying design thinking to staffing needs, let’s call this 
exercise Design the VP, because the example I’ll use our example the plant 
nursery’s need for a new vice president of sales. (If you needed to hire a 
new art director, you would call the exercise Design the Art Director.) 
Just change the name of the exercise to include the position for which you 
are hiring, and you’re set.
Start the Design the VP activity just as you would the Design the Box 
activity: with defining what is “in” the VP. On a white board or flip chart, 
draw the shape of a person in the center. I draw a stick figure, because that 
is the extent of my artistic talent. At the top of the page, write the title of 
the position for which you are designing (Figure 9-4).
1There’s a great example of Design the Box shared by Kate Verrill online. See  
http://www.gogamestorm.com/?p=576.
Figure 9-4.  Design the VP starting point

Design Thinking for Entrepreneurs and Small Businesses
111
Using the plant nursery example as the one hiring the VP, we determine 
the qualities that need to be in the VP and list those near the correspond-
ing area of the stick figure. For example, we might determine that the VP 
needs to be articulate and communicate well, so we draw a speech bubble 
near the figure’s head and include those descriptors (Figure 9-5).
We might decide that the VP needs to have a college degree and previous 
sales experience, so we add those features to the figure. We might decide 
that our VP needs have experience with plants, so add that feature, too. 
(Figure 9-6).
Figure 9-5.  Design the VP in progress

Chapter 9 | Designing for Growth
112
Once we’ve defined what we need “in” our VP, we need to design the VP 
itself. Rather than designing a prototype of a box, like we would in the 
Design the Box activity, we’re going to design the person in Design the VP. 
We will articulate what about the person’s personality and presence we 
want and need for a VP. Imagine the process of interviewing live candidates 
for this position: what would influence you to choose one candidate over 
another beyond what is on his or her résumé?
Note
 
■
 Do not let designing the person spark controversy. Keep physical descriptions and 
specific attributes out of the conversation!
For the VP of sales at the plant nursery, we might decide that we want 
someone who smiles easily and genuinely, so we add that to the stick fig-
ure. We may decide also that the person needs to be able to make cold 
calls comfortably and can work equally well with corporate clients and 
landscape companies, so we add those features, too (Figure 9-7).
Figure 9-6. Design the VP in progress

Design Thinking for Entrepreneurs and Small Businesses
113
Now we have a visual representation of the type of person with the skill 
set and attributes we want for the position. We can use that as a touch-
stone as we recruit and interview candidates, ensuring that they meet the 
requirements we designed. Did we design a man or a woman? A blonde 
or a redhead? Single or married? None of those attributes matter, nor can 
they legally guide hiring practices.
Cross-Pollinating Ideas
One of the more common areas of business growth, and perhaps one of 
the most fun, is expanding the products or services your company offers. 
Ideation alone generates a lot of interest among and participation from 
staff. However, the process of expanding a product or service line closely 
mirrors the overall design thinking process, and you must perform due 
diligence for understanding and defining the need and potential oppor-
tunity before you jump into ideation. Assuming you’ve done that and are 
ready to start brainstorming ways to innovate and expand on what your 
company offers, I suggest introducing your team to a design thinking tech-
nique called heuristic ideation.
Figure 9-7.  Design the VP completed

Chapter 9 | Designing for Growth
114
Heuristic ideation is a rather fancy way of saying “rapid brainstorming.” 
The technique speeds up the process of generating ideas by associating 
concepts disparate to one another but still relevant to the bigger picture. 
And it is a lot of fun.
As with all design thinking activities, you need a white board or flip chart 
and markers. Sticky notes are optional for this one! The first step is 
to determine what you want to brainstorm about and two descriptive 
­attributes that you can use to define the matrix. For the plant nursery  
example, we might populate the matrix with a look at plant usage  
(interiors, exteriors, and events) and contract duration (purchase, long-
term rental, short-term rental). On the board, draw a matrix and populate 
it with our information (Figure 9-8).
Figure 9-8.  Rapid brainstorming matrix
Note
■
■
  The rapid brainstorming matrix can be any size, but I recommend nothing larger than 
six cells by six cells.
During the activity, the group looks across the cells for unusual or  
unexpected combinations to spark new ideas. Some of the combinations 
may not make sense at first, but they could contain a nugget of an idea 
worth exploring, or they could trigger other thoughts that lead to more 
viable possibilities. There may be some combinations for which the group 
cannot come up with any compelling ideas. In those instances, you may 
want to add another attribute to add to the matrix or alter the attributes 
already in the matrix (Figure 9-9).

Design Thinking for Entrepreneurs and Small Businesses
115
Once you’ve generated as many cross-pollinated ideas as possible, have 
the group assess which two are the most viable and explore how to  
prototype those ideas. At that point, you’ll be on the path to determining 
if your growth plan can include those new ideas.
Summary
Growth is an integral part of business, whether it is incremental, mon-
umental, or somewhere in between. It can take on a wide variety of 
forms, be localized in specific departments or niches of your business, or 
sweep through your entire organization, leaving no area unaffected. Quite 
plainly, growth happens. With design thinking tools, you’ll be equipped to  
anticipate opportunities, embrace growth, and purposefully direct your 
efforts and resources in a way that will best benefit your business in the 
long run.

Case Studies
Design Thinking in Action
Putting design thinking into action might feel like second nature or the 
most foreign thing on the planet, but it’s happening every day in large 
corporate boardrooms and in break-out sessions at conferences around 
the world. Design thinking isn’t just for big businesses, though, as you’ve 
discovered through the previous chapters. Many small businesses owners 
and entrepreneurs have dipped their toes in the design thinking water and 
have applied its principles to a variety of challenges.
Following are examples of success stories with small organizations’ first 
forays into working with design thinking activities and exercises. The case 
studies cover a variety of situations to give you the broadest view into 
how design thinking has been used by others much like you.
Come on in; the water’s fine.
Design Thinking and Branding Strategy
Innovation in technology is booming with no discernible end in sight. 
There are thousands upon thousands of entrepreneurs and small busi-
nesses entering that space, particularly in the area of mobile application 
development and design, where they are producing hundreds of thousands 
of products. With that much activity, the mobile application landscape is 
always changing. When introducing a new application, creating distinctive 
branding is critical, but equally critical is getting it done quickly.
An integrated marketing and web strategy firm based on the East 
Coast had an idea for a mobile app that would fill a niche and provide 
an ­innovative solution for professional and hobbyist photographers and 
A
A P P E N D I X 

Appendix A | Case Studies
118
­filmmakers. After a thorough review of mobile apps already available, the 
firm determined that it had a viable idea and proceeded to use their 
­internal resources to develop the application.
Once the app was bug-free, the firm was ready to brand it. I led the 
firm’s senior leadership through a Microscoping brand DNA exercise (see 
Chapter 7) to identify, describe, and coalesce around the key features of 
the application’s brand, the brand’s personality, and the brand’s core.
Ideally, the Microscoping exercise is done in person on a white board or 
flip chart. Because of budget restraints, I stayed in my office in Texas, while 
the firm’s leadership stayed in their office on the East Coast, and we used 
an online collaborative workspace and conference calls to complete the 
exercise. Although we were successful, conducting Microscoping remotely 
would never be my first recommendation. Unless there is a greatly com-
pelling reason not to gather the group in the same physical space, opt for 
the in-person version of the exercise.
As we worked through the exercise, we discovered that the firm’s senior 
leadership held disparate viewpoints in two of the seven areas of the 
brand’s DNA, including the core. Through some honest conversation, we 
were able to come to an agreement and a shared definition of those two 
areas. We accomplished what we set out to do: create a well-defined 
brand DNA that would guide all branding efforts for the application 
­moving forward (see Figure A-1).
Figure A-1.  Microscoping brand DNA chart

Design Thinking for Entrepreneurs and Small Businesses
119
Had we not used the Microscoping exercise and uncovered the dispari-
ties among the leadership team, we potentially could have made strategic 
errors in developing a marketing strategy and plan for the application that 
could have led to a loss of opportunity, time, and resources.
As the app has continued to develop and accommodate user needs, 
the brand has stayed true to its DNA, continues to communicate to its 
target audiences in terms that support the brand as well as resonate 
with its ­targets, and consistently adds new users—all indicators that the 
Microscoping exercise was successful in defining the brand accurately and 
meaningfully.
CASE STUDY SNAPSHOT
Challenge: Develop a solid, relevant brand strategy for a new mobile application 
developed by an interactive marketing and web strategy firm.
Action: Using the Microscoping brand DNA exercise, identify and articulate the 
seven aspects of the brand: what it does, how a user would describe it, facts and 
symbols to support brand claims, how a user perceives others’ opinions of him 
when using the brand, how the brand makes the user feel, the brand’s personality, 
and the core tenets of the brand.
Result: A well-defined, sustainable brand DNA profile created collaboratively and 
wholly adopted by the firm’s senior leadership.
Design Thinking and Business Strategy
Regardless of your viewpoint of health care in America, you have to admit 
that it is ripe for innovation. (Whether you can navigate your way through 
the complexity of the system is another matter.) No other industry in the 
past decade has stood at the precipice of such massive, sweeping change 
that will affect every individual and business in the country. Even the 
­largest health care providers are having difficulty tackling the ­challenges 
that face them.
One of those providers saw an opportunity for innovation in the health 
care marketplace that greatly would benefit the American consumer, yet 
its senior leadership knew that it would not be able to capitalize on that 
opportunity in a successful way within its current organizational structure. 
In true entrepreneurial spirit, that company spawned a separate health care 
start-up to shepherd a new business concept to fill the innovation gap.
The start-up’s leadership needed innovative thought partners to help them 
develop the new company’s business model, organizational structure, and 
operations processes that would launch the business. They engaged a 

Appendix A | Case Studies
120
firm of which I was part of the senior leadership and would spearhead the 
initiative with one of the firm’s partners.
At the outset, the company’s only asset was an idea on a page from a 
­yellow notepad. As monumental as the idea was—to create a service that 
helps patients navigate the health care industry—no implementation plan 
or organizational structure existed to bring the initiative to life. Our first 
application of design thinking principles came in the form of Stakeholder 
Visioning (see Chapter 3). The start-up’s leadership comprised very senior, 
exceptionally knowledgeable, and experienced health care executives, 
which translated into a lot of brainpower. It also translated into some dif-
ficulty in shifting mindsets and adopting the perspective of stakeholders 
other than health care providers. The start-up’s business idea included 
both consumer-facing and provider-facing services, so the need to fully 
capture the perspectives of both stakeholder groups was imperative.
We had to balance the wants and needs of competing interests during this 
exercise. To do so effectively, we had to check our assumptions and our 
perceived business constraints at the door. The experienced health care 
leaders would have to think like consumers without considering whether 
their business (or any other) could fulfill what the consumers wanted and 
needed.
Although the Stakeholder Vision exercise was a challenge at first, we 
­successfully completed the process and used its outcomes to define the 
start-up’s business model, organizational structure, operating processes, 
mission, vision, and values to all parties’ satisfaction—and within thirty 
days of the legal formation of the company.
CASE STUDY SNAPSHOT
Challenge: Develop a viable business strategy, organizational structure, and 
operating processes for a health care start-up.
Action: Using Stakeholder Visioning, identify the needs and wants of two key 
stakeholders—health care consumers and providers—and appropriately balance 
them to develop a business model that not only meets consumer expectations but 
also is sustainable by and profitable for providers.
Result: A solid foundation on which it could build its service offerings and brand 
strategy and from which the start-up could launch into the marketplace.

Design Thinking and Customer Experience
Retail is no easy business, yet it makes up several vertebrae in our ­country’s 
economic backbone. According to U.S. Census data from 2010, there are 
nearly 6 million retail trade firms in the country, more than 5 million of 
which have twenty or fewer employees.1 That is a lot of competition in a 
small business marketplace. Distinguishing your business is imperative for 
success—nay, survival—and one means of doing so is through the pur-
poseful design of the customer experience.
A franchisee of a specialty running retailer in the South had seen competi-
tion in her market steadily increase over the span of two years. Although 
her store was still performing well, she wanted to ensure that she kept 
her current customer base engaged and satisfied, as well as attracting new 
customers, whom she could convert into loyal ones. In sum, she wanted to 
deliver a memorable and pleasing in-store experience to her customers.
A review of the previous year’s sales activity revealed that the product cat-
egory that underperformed most significantly was apparel. In fact, although 
apparel occupied more than 50 percent of the store’s square footage, 
apparel sales accounted for less than 15 percent of total sales. Not only 
did this directly affect the store’s profitability, but also—and more impor-
tant to the franchisee—the customer was missing the full experience of 
shopping in the store. The big question before the franchisee and her 
leadership team was, “Why aren’t customers shopping apparel?”
To uncover the root answer to that question, we used The 5 Whys activity 
(see Chapter 2), during which we all sounded like toddlers asking, “Why?” 
We started with the premise, “Our customers aren’t shopping the whole 
store,” and proceeded through asking ourselves “why?” repeatedly in an 
effort to peel back the layers of perception and get to the root. With each 
“why?” we dug deeper into the answer, ultimately arriving at the response, 
“Because we aren’t promoting it or talking about it. And those areas of 
the store are dark” (see Figure A-2).

Appendix A | Case Studies

Prior to any experience design work, I spent a half-day in the store 
­observing customers and their shopping behavior, and conducting the 
Customer Intercepts research exercise. Nearly 90 percent of ­customers 
didn’t shop the entire store. They went directly to the shoe wall display. 
Of the customers who did shop beyond the shoe wall, the recovery equip-
ment display in the front of the store by the showcase window attracted 
the most attention. The common denominator of both areas: they are 
well lit. Among the varying reasons customers provided for why they 
didn’t shop the other areas in the store were these nuggets: they didn’t 
notice the other areas, the apparel didn’t catch their eye, and that part 
of the store just didn’t seem appealing. Although the customers didn’t 
exactly say, “That part of the store is dark,” their answers seemed to 
­support the answer to the fifth why in the exercise.
That was our lightbulb moment, figuratively and literally. The information 
from the customer intercepts and observational research revealed that 
customers weren’t getting the in-store experience the franchisee wanted 
to deliver because the apparel wasn’t showcased or merchandised effec-
tively. One means of correction that was in franchisee’ sphere of control 
was to improve the lighting and how the apparel was merchandised so 
that the light drew the customers’ eyes to the displays.
Sixty days after the changes were made, we followed with another review 
of sales data and another series of customer intercepts. The data showed 
increases in apparel sales, and the customer feedback was more positive 
about the in-store experience, citing not only the apparel displays but also 
a general, overall feeling of lightness, energy, and color.

CASE STUDY SNAPSHOT
Challenge: Design and deliver an in-store experience that would engage customers 
in a meaningful way, while also guiding them to shop the entire store, rather than 
one or two specific areas.
Action: Using The 5 Whys activity, ask iterative, probing questions to identify the 
root cause of why customers were not shopping the entire store, which resulted in 
a less-than-desirable customer experience.
Result: A specific, actionable, and manageable plan for design modifications to the 
store that would result in a better customer experience and potentially improved 
category sales.
Design Thinking and Change
When you’ve had a successful business for more than two decades, it’s 
easy to fall into predictable patterns. Although you shouldn’t scoff at or 
undermine solid processes and best practices, too much routine can leave 
your business stale and potentially bore your target audiences.
A singer/songwriter/guitarist based in the Midwest had enjoyed twenty-
plus years of success with radio airplay, opening national tour dates for 
A-list acts, and filling concert halls coast to coast. As with any business, 
though, he was experiencing a valley among his hills—a downward trend 
in ticket sales—and wanted to mitigate that as quickly as possible. That 
trend was a reflection of a target audience that had subtly changed while 
the singer was preoccupied with handling the day-to-day tasks of being a 
professional musician. He couldn’t see the forest for the trees. We met 
his challenge head-on with the Forest and Trees exercise (Chapter 8).
When the singer, his manager, and I launched into the Forest and Trees 
exercise, we knew full well we would identify dozens of trees. However, 
none of us knew what the forest would hold. At the end of the exer-
cise, we had uncovered the following themes in both the trees and forest 
sections: touring, funding, and branding. The most compelling realization 
was this: the singer’s primary target audience had aged with him, and this 
fact had ramifications in all three themed areas. The singer and his fan 
base were no longer in their twenties, with disposable income and few 
responsibilities. They were now in their forties, with children, mortgages, 
and limited free time. With the realization that the target audience had 
changed significantly came the realization that the singer’s brand had not.
Now that we could see the forest, we could take deliberate steps toward 
designing for this change that had affected the singer’s business. Although 

Appendix A | Case Studies
124
his brand still resonated strongly with his target audience, it wasn’t 
­connecting with younger consumers. This was our problem to solve using 
the 3-12-3 activity, also described in Chapter 8, the outcomes of which 
included a shift in strategic planning for the singer’s next concert season, 
as well as a shift in his brand DNA. As of this writing, those shifts had 
occurred and the singer is seeing greater diversity among his audiences, as 
well as performing at festivals and venues that generally attract a younger 
demographic.
CASE STUDY SNAPSHOT
Challenge: Evaluate the business landscape to determine how to best design for 
and adapt to changes in the market and among the target audience.
Action: Using the Forest and Trees exercise and the 3-12-3 activity, identify the 
most relevant and actionable means to mitigate the negative effects of change and 
capitalize on opportunities.
Result: Appropriate shifts in the business’s strategic plan and brand DNA to 
accommodate the change.
Design Thinking and Research
Launching a new business takes guts. Launching one in an industry ­suffering 
through the throes of frequent change takes guts and blind faith. However, 
neither pays the bills or generates profits. Research prior to planning and 
launch will save you time, effort, money, and headaches. As entrepre-
neurs, we get excited about ideas and opportunities, and we might rush 
to ­implement them and realize success. No more! It’s time to make a 
­commitment to research and due diligence before action.
The former editor of a printed alternative news source made a path-
­altering choice and moved to editing an online-only alternative news source 
of her own creation. She had gathered a plethora of research in the form 
of competitive analyses, business models, and market demographics—all 
sources of secondary quantitative data. Feeling confident that she had 
created a marketable product, she launched the online source to rave 
reviews.
After an initial period of rapid growth, the news source’s readership and 
paid subscriber base leveled out. A review of the source’s content, design, 
and delivery mechanisms assured the editor that all was aligned with the 
data she had collected. However, the picture wasn’t complete without 
qualitative data.

Design Thinking for Entrepreneurs and Small Businesses
125
Rather than experimenting with format and content in an attempt to 
­reenergize the acquisition of readers and paid subscribers, the ­editor 
engaged my services to conduct qualitative research with current 
­subscribers for the purpose of using the information to fine-tune her 
product offering. The usual approaches to qualitative research, covered 
in Chapter 2, require face-to-face contact. Unfortunately, we faced two 
significant challenges to traditional qualitative research: for the majority of 
the subscriber base, the editor had only email addresses, and the start-up 
nature of the venture demanded the process be quick and inexpensive.
The answer to these challenges would be an amalgam of quantitative and 
qualitative research techniques. We used a customizable survey instru-
ment that could be delivered through email, and we employed qualita-
tive questioning formats and techniques used in customer intercepts and 
one-on-one interviews to design the survey’s content. Not only did this 
approach solve the challenge with reaching the subscriber base, it was 
delivered quickly and at a very low cost. The resulting hybrid research tool 
was successful. More than 25 percent of paid subscribers responded to 
the survey (average response rate is 15 percent), providing richly detailed 
information and unique perspectives that proved helpful in guiding the 
editor in her product refinement.
CASE STUDY SNAPSHOT
Challenge: Uncover the reasons behind the start-up’s sluggish growth and look for 
ways to modify the business’s product appropriately.
Action: Using a hybrid of quantitative and qualitative research techniques, 
elicit detailed information from participants solely through an online delivery 
mechanism.
Result: A higher-than-average response rate with subscribers providing in-depth 
opinions and perspectives that would inform the product’s future development.

Metrics for  
Design Thinking
Measuring Performance
Every bit of work and every penny invested are for nothing if you aren’t 
measuring their return. It’s a core tenet of operating a profitable, success-
ful business. The same rule applies for design thinking initiatives: you must 
measure.
Metrics—the measurements by which you gauge an initiative’s success or 
failure (or other characteristics)—need to be one of your best friends, yet 
they are hard to get to know. They can seem aloof, elusive, oppositional, 
and secretive. In reality, they are eager to be transparent and give you 
everything they have.
As business owners and entrepreneurs, we face two distinct challenges 
when it comes to metrics: identifying the relevant ones and taking the 
time to measure them over multiple periods. That’s just for the metrics 
of the processes with which we are familiar. Introduce design thinking into 
the mix—new approaches to problem solving with which you may not be 
familiar—and you might think you need a whole new set of metrics.
This is not necessarily the case.
Many of the ways you normally measure progress can also be used to 
­measure design thinking–based initiatives: foot traffic, inquiries, sales, 
­referrals, impressions, click-throughs, content subscriptions, page views, 
follows and likes, satisfaction ratings, and churn. All of these ­measurements 
are applicable depending on the circumstance.

Appendix B | Metrics for Design Thinking 
128
Relevant Metrics
Following is a brief reference guide to use in helping you and your leader-
ship team determine what measurement to use when.
Foot Traffic
Uniquely relevant for retailers and public spaces, such as libraries and 
parks, foot traffic is measured by simply counting the number of ­individuals 
who enter your space within a specified timeframe. Measuring foot traffic 
is as easy—and as boring as—standing by a door and using a hand-held 
tally counter. If your marketing plan is designed to increase the number of 
visitors to your store, measuring foot traffic will give you insight into the 
plan’s success.
Inquiries
Prompting a customer to inquire about additional information is a 
­call-to-action tactic often used by businesses with a long sales process or 
complex products. Inquiries are also a means of gauging a customer’s level 
of interest in a product or service. You can measure inquiries by tracking 
the mechanism you created for generating them in your call to action, for 
example, phone calls, emails, coupons redeemed, and so on.
Sales
This is likely the most popular measurement and one of the easiest to 
track. However, sales are not always an accurate reflection of an initiative’s 
success. Many other factors can affect sales: availability of inventory, cost, 
employee interaction, fulfillment, and so on. Although sales are generally 
considered the ultimate measure of success, that metric should never be 
the only measure.
Referrals
New customers referred by current ones or by vendors—customers who 
come to you via word of mouth—are highly desirable by any business. To 
measure referrals through customer interaction, whether in person or on 
the phone, you can simply ask the customer how he or she heard about 
your business. Customer referrals through the Internet can be tracked 
using web analytics (see Appendix C for a definition).

Design Thinking for Entrepreneurs and Small Businesses
129
Impressions
Measuring impressions is often referred to as “counting eyeballs,” because 
one impression is equivalent to one person seeing one piece of com-
munication (advertisement, web page, billboard, and so on) one time. 
Marketing communication is almost exclusively measured by impressions. 
Impressions can be measured in several ways. Print media measures 
impressions based on circulation and distribution counts. Broadcast 
media measures impressions based on data reported by listeners or 
viewers through services such as Nielsen. Impressions for online media 
are measured by unique IP addresses.
Click-Throughs
This is a means of measuring web-based communication specifically.  
A click-through is the action someone takes when they click on an 
­advertisement or a link embedded in one piece of communication that 
takes the reader to another piece of communication, for example, a link 
from a retailer’s e-newsletter to the retailer’s product page.
Content Subscriptions
A click-through is occasionally followed by an opportunity to subscribe to 
a company’s newsletter. If one of your goals is to increase your database 
of customers and potential customers to whom you can communicate 
regularly, use this metric.
Page Views
A click-through can also be followed by a page view. A page view is a 
­specific type of impression, measured by tracking unique IP addresses. It is 
the equivalent of one person viewing one page on your website one time. 
Page views are a common metric for measuring a website’s traffic.
Follows and Likes
In the realm of social media, “follows” and “likes” are the primary means 
of measuring customer engagement. On Facebook, users “like” businesses. 
On Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, and similar platforms, users “follow” 
businesses.

Appendix B | Metrics for Design Thinking 
130
Satisfaction Ratings
Rating satisfaction with a business, whether among employees or custom-
ers, is a common practice. The rub is that this metric requires a baseline 
to measure against, so satisfaction must be measured twice before results 
can be meaningful. The most common means of measurement are sur-
veys, which can be delivered online, via phone, or through the regular mail, 
and customer comment forms.
Churn
This has nothing to do with butter. Churn, also called churn rate or attri-
tion rate, refers to the rate at which a business loses customers. Churn 
is measured during a defined timeframe, and although it is a metric most 
commonly used by subscription-based business models, like mobile phones 
and magazines, it can be relevant to any business sector that tracks the 
purchase history and behavior of its customers. If the life cycle of your 
product or service is three months, and a customer hasn’t made a repeat 
purchase within nine months of his or her initial purchase, you’ve probably 
lost that customer.
When to Measure Performance
Many clients have asked me when they should measure performance. My 
pat answer is “Always.” In all seriousness, keeping your finger on the pulse 
of your business by measuring relevant metrics regularly is good busi-
ness. Getting into the habit will help you identify potential challenges and 
opportunities while they are still on the horizon so you can prepare for 
their arrival.
If measuring performance is new for you, select relevant metrics that you 
can measure at a frequency that will be not only meaningful but also feasi-
ble. Some business sectors benefit from daily or evenly hourly measuring, 
others suffice with monthly or quarterly measurements. At the absolute 
minimum, take measurements of relevant metrics at least annually, which 
could be at the end or beginning of your fiscal year, or on your business 
anniversary date . . . essentially any date that makes sense for you.
From a design thinking point of view, I firmly believe that regardless of 
your ongoing measurements, you also need to measure before and after 
any design thinking initiative. It’s logical and necessary if you want to gauge 
results accurately. For example, if you are going to redesign your store 
to increase foot traffic, you should measure that foot traffic prior to the 

Design Thinking for Entrepreneurs and Small Businesses
131
redesign. Also measure the foot traffic afterward at three regular inter-
vals so that you have an average foot traffic count, which you can then 
compare to the result you obtained before the redesign.
Measurement and the Iterative Nature of 
Design Thinking
By its very nature design thinking is an iterative process that perfectly 
illustrates the saying, “If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again.” Hence, 
design thinking includes prototyping and testing as critical steps in the 
process. Those of us who use design thinking in our businesses know that 
rarely (f ever) will we get it right the first time, regardless of what “it” is. 
There is and always will be room for improvement, so we prototype and 
test as many times as necessary to get the results we want. Therein lies 
the core reason that measurement is hugely important not only in busi-
ness but also in design thinking. Knowing the results of our efforts aids 
us in making adjustments quickly so we can try again, and again, until we 
get it right.

Design 
Thinking Jargon
Put the Right Words in Your Mouth
I have never played Meeting Bingo—the game you can play secretly during 
a meeting when you’re bored. It’s played like bingo, but instead of keeping 
track of B-5 and O-70, you keep track of jargon and business-speak like 
“parking lot this issue” and “sustainable practices.” We’ve all been in meet-
ings like that, and they validate my belief that jargon should be banned 
from any gathering of two or more professionals.
Since the likelihood of that happening is slim to none, I want to arm you 
with the definitions of the most common design thinking jargon so that 
you can talk the talk with the best of them.

Foreword
While I was having dinner with Steve Myers of CERN, he shared with me 
some of his stories of the development and first operation of the Large 
Hadron Collider and his frustrations with the media who by and large sought 
to scare the general public with stories of tiny black holes that could endanger 
the entire planet. His team of physicists was largely unprepared for the media 
assault and fared badly, which unfortunately led to many apocalyptic stories in 
the European tabloids. Listening sympathetically to this story, I remembered 
something my father once told me, “You can’t be good at everything. 
Concentrate on what you know you’re good at, make good guesses at the 
things that are within reach of your understanding, and for everything else 
take the best counsel you can find.” It’s advice I carry around with me like an 
old heirloom watch, and it’s advice Steve and his team could have used. He’s 
an expert physicist, but no expert at media relations.
Technology drives democratization, from areas as diverse as the political 
arena (think of Twitter’s role in the Arab Spring) to the arts (Adobe 
Premiere, the leading filmmakers’ tool, runs quite happily on my old 
MacBook Pro) and of course, the Internet start-up culture that has 
opened up resources—previously only available to large enterprises—to 
the bedroom entrepreneur through cloud computing. There’s no end in 
sight. In the next few years, manufacturing capabilities will move from the 
fabrication plant to the garage by way of affordable 3D printing technology. 
It’s a rosy story; finally we have at our disposal all the technology and 
services required to harness our creative impulses. We can move from 
a sketch on the back of a taxi receipt to a highly successful product or 
service used by millions in a matter of months.
But how do we leverage these technologies and services to our best 
advantage if we don’t also have access to resources that help us build our 
strategic vision and entrepreneurial dexterity? I want to introduce you to 
someone who gives you that access.
I first met Beverly Rudkin Ingle in the Hilton bar at South by Southwest 
2012. I was a little grumpy and a little tired, having traveled for sixteen 
hours from London, expecting a few days of relentless Texan sunshine 
only to be met with weather not that different than a typical English 
summer day—wind and driving rain. I was inspired, though, after listening 
to Dave Morin evangelize on the importance of driving the emotional

context of his business, Path. As I nursed a gin and tonic and thought 
about what the days ahead might hold, I gradually began to be sucked 
into the conversation this astute, sassy Texan woman next to me was 
having with the founders of a now highly successful digital agency. As she 
wove her stories, I began to focus less on the college basketball playing 
on the bank of TVs behind the bar and more on her persuasive narrative. 
Beverly is many things to many people, and to me she is nothing less than 
a brilliant storyteller.
Soon I found myself deep into an elaboration of her theory—no that’s 
wrong, her mission—to democratize the often opaque process of 
business/product innovation and evolution. Beverly’s key message is that 
big companies don’t rely on luck. They leverage the power of design 
thinking. So why can’t entrepreneurs and small business owners do the 
same if they are equipped with a few easy-to-use, commonsense tools?
Now thanks to her book, they can. The good news: it’s much easier than 
physics.

Acknowledgments
I am thrilled to have this opportunity to extend my sincere gratitude 
to the following people for their inspiration, guidance, and support in 
creating this book.
My husband and best friend, Joe, for his unwavering love and belief in my 
ability to pull this off, and his tolerance of baseball caps.
My daughters, Anna, Katie, Evelyn, and Victoria, who were wonderfully 
patient and understanding and who learned that if I was typing on the 
computer with earbuds plugged in, I was working and shouldn’t be 
interrupted unless there was blood, broken bones, or barf.
My daddy, Jack; my mama, Bobbi; my dad, Jerry; and my in-laws, J. and 
Kathy; for the truly special love, encouragement, and support that you 
can get only from parents, present and in spirit.
My foil and partner-in-crime, Paul R., who made me stop and pay 
attention—and gave me a push—at South by Southwest.
My faithful friends and cheerleaders—Angel, Chris, Jeanette, Jeremy,  
Mary Katherine, Melissa, Michele, Missy, Paul S., Sandy, and Susan M.—
whose enthusiasm buoys me when I need it most.
My colleague and friend Susan Worthman, director of the Leading by Design 
Fellows Program at the California College of the Arts, who embraced the 
tornado and encouraged my enthusiasm for change.
My editor, Jeff Olson; coordinating editor Rita Fernando; and Apress 
Media for the invaluable guidance, confidence and opportunity.
And my tenth-grade English teacher, Tom Vannatta, who has no idea how 
much of an influence he was. 

Preface
The entrepreneurial spirit in the United States is dynamic, determined, 
and laced with fantastic tales of self-made millionaires and enviable success 
stories. There’s a great deal of mystique surrounding those tales, which  
I attribute to our country’s unique reputation of being the land of 
opportunity. Entrepreneurs have created more than 27 million small busi­
nesses according to 2010 data.1 If you are holding this book, you probably 
are one of them, and you’re looking for your next competitive advantage.
When I first heard the phrase “design thinking,” I had been on a quest for 
the next competitive advantage for my clients and myself. Instinctively, 
I knew the next step had to be big and bold; it had to embrace change 
and be purposeful in its approach to business challenges. It also had to 
make the consumer or customer a priority like never before. I wasn’t 
sure where to turn, but a series of fortuitous conversations and research 
on the Internet led me to design thinking.
The methodology was what I had been searching for, and by all accounts, 
it was successful. Large corporations have been leveraging design thinking 
for years, albeit using various other terminologies. Procter & Gamble, 
Apple, British Airways, Roche, Samsung, and other corporations of their 
magnitude put design thinking principles to work for their collective 
success every day. 
“If the big boys are doing it,” I thought, “then there must be measurable 
value.”
I discovered that there was—and continues to be—measurable value, 
and quite a lot of it. I also discovered that design thinking was still 
sequestered in corporate boardrooms. Access was limited to those 
with big ideas and deep pockets, available through major agencies and 
consultancies and often with hefty price tags.
For those of us not leading large corporations but those 27 million small 
businesses, access to design thinking was nearly nonexistent. I wrote this 
book to change that. A shift to purposeful, customer-centric business 
practices that would be sustainable over the long run starts with the small 
businesses that create the backbone of our economy. That shift starts now.

Preface
xvi
Without consulting fees, project retainers, contract commitments, or 
even a boardroom, you now have access to some of the most productive 
design thinking principles, methodologies, and activities that you can put 
to work immediately. All you need is enthusiasm, an open mind, some 
markers, a white board or flip chart, a few stacks of sticky notes, and this 
book, and you’re ready to go.
At a glance, Design Thinking for Entrepreneurs and Small Businesses guides 
you through the following:
Chapter 1—A detailed but digestible introduction 
to design thinking
Chapter 2—The importance of research, why you  
cannot skimp on it, and why you don’t have to
Chapter 3—Designing a business strategy, and why 
it isn’t an oxymoron
Chapter 4—Designing live customer experi-
ences and why first impressions will always be 
meaningful
Chapter 5—Designing digital customer experiences 
and how to create connections with customers
Chapter 6—Designing services and service deliv-
ery and how efficiency benefits your business and 
your customers
Chapter 7—Designing marketing and branding and 
why it is—and should be—so much more than 
your logo
Chapter 8—Designing for change in your business 
model, market, or competitive environment
Chapter 9—Designing for growth and why growth 
does not stop
I included four appendixes filled with additional data, templates, and case 
studies to help guide you along your discovery and implementation of 
design thinking.
Design thinking has yet to reach its peak of influence, because until now it 
wasn’t readily available to entrepreneurs and small businesses. You, dear 
reader, are at the vanguard of the next competitive advantage: design 
thinking. Congratulations for taking this first step. Now, go show the big 
boys what you’re made of.
