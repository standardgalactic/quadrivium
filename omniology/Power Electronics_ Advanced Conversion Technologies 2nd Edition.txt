Preface to the Second Edition
Power Electronics has four categories of which we have systematically introduced in the first edition 
of the book Power Electronics: Advanced Conversion Technologies, published in 2010. In AC/DC 
rectifiers, the first category, we emphasized the analysis of the single-phase diode rectifier with R–C 
load. In DC/DC converters, we recommended the super-lift technique and mathematical modeling 
for power DC/DC converters. In DC/AC inverters, we demonstrated multilevel inverters and men-
tioned the best switching angles. In AC/AC converters we introduced novel topologies.
The first edition of this book has attracted a great deal of attention since publication and has 
strongly stimulated the development of modern power electronics. This book has also been adopted 
as a textbook in many universities; it is for this reason that the text in this book has not been altered 
in any way. In the meantime, we have received large number of feedback from readers around the 
world. In the second edition, we improved the book based on the readers’ suggestions and updated 
the contents to include new examples, solutions, and techniques.
The best switching angles is an increasingly important technique to obtain the lowest total har-
monic distortion (THD) for multilevel DC/AC inverters. This technique solved the long-term problem 
for design engineers on how to choose the switching angles. Therefore in the second edition, this 
technique is explained in more details with methods for the determination of switching angle. It is 
expanded and involved in Chapter 10, which is the authors’ preliminary contribution. Chapter 10 
serves as a modest spur to induce the readers to come forward with their valuable contributions. 
The topic will benefit all DC/AC inverter designers.
ORGANIZATION OF THIS BOOK
This book is organized into 13 chapters. It covers all power electronics areas: AC/DC rectifiers, 
DC/DC converters, DC/AC inverters, and AC/AC converters. In addition, we introduce some AC/
DC/AC and DC/AC/DC converters to enhance the contents of the modern power electronics. These 
general knowledges about the various power electronic areas are introduced in Chapter 1. The AC/DC 
rectifiers are discussed in Chapters 2 and 3. Power factor correction is explained in Chapter 4. DC/DC 
converters are introduced in details in Chapters 5 through 7. DC/AC inverters are investigated in 
Chapters 8 and 9. The novel technique of the best switching angles to obtain the lowest THD for mul-
tilevel DC/AC inverters is presented in Chapter 10. AC/AC converters are introduced in Chapters 11 
and 12. AC/DC/AC and DC/AC/DC converters are demonstrated in Chapter 13.

Preface to the First Edition
This book is aimed at both engineering students and practicing professionals who are specializing 
in power electronics and provides useful and concise information with regard to advanced convert-
ers. It contains more than 200 topologies concerning advanced converters that have been developed 
by the authors. Some recently published topologies are also included. The prototypes presented here 
demonstrate novel approaches that the authors hope will be of great benefit to the area of power 
electronics.
Power electronics is the technology behind the conversion of electrical energy from a source to 
the requirements of the end user. Although it is of vital importance to both industry and the indi-
vidual citizen, it is somewhat taken for granted in much the same way as the air we breathe and the 
water we drink. The energy conversion techniques are now a primary focus of the power electron-
ics community with rapid advances being made in conversion technologies in recent years that are 
detailed in this book along with a look at the historical problems that have now been solved.
The necessary equipment for energy conversion can be divided into four groups: (1) AC/DC rec-
tifiers, (2) DC/DC converters, (3) DC/AC inverters, and (4) AC/AC transformers. AC/DC rectifiers 
were the earliest converters to be developed, and consequently, most of the traditional circuits have 
now been widely published and discussed. However, some of those circuits have not been analyzed 
in any great detail with the single-phase diode rectifier with R–C load being a typical example. 
Recently, there has been a new approach to AC/DC rectifiers that involves power factor correction 
(PFC) and unity power factor (UPF), the techniques of which are introduced in this book.
The technology of DC/DC conversion is making rapid progress and, according to incomplete 
statistics, there are more than 600 topologies of DC/DC converters in existence with the new ones 
being created every year. It would be an immense task to try and examine all these approaches. 
However, in 2001, the authors were able to systematically sort and categorize the DC/DC converters 
into six groups. Our main contribution in this field involves voltage-lift and super-lift techniques for 
which more than 100 topologies are introduced in this book.
DC/AC inverters can be divided into two groups: (1) pulse-width modulation (PWM) inverters 
and (2) multilevel inverters. People will be more familiar with PWM inverters as the voltage source 
inverter (VSI) and current source inverter (CSI). In 2003, details of the impedance-source inverter 
(ZSI) first appeared and a great deal of interest was created from power electronics experts. With its 
advantages so obvious in research and industrial applications, hundreds of papers concerning ZSI 
have been published in the ensuing years. Multilevel inverters were invented in the early 1980s and 
developed quickly. Many new topologies have been designed and applied to industrial applications, 
especially in renewable energy systems. Typical circuits include diode-clamped inverters, capacitor-
clamped inverters, and hybrid H-bridge multilevel inverters. Multilevel inverters overcame the 
drawbacks of the PWM inverter and paved the way for industrial applications.
The traditional AC/AC converters are divided into three groups: (1) voltage-modulation AC/AC 
converters, (2) cycloconverters, and (3) matrix converters. All traditional AC/AC converters can 
only convert a high voltage to a low voltage with adjustable amplitude and frequency. Their draw-
backs are limited output voltage and poor THD. Therefore, new types of AC/AC converters, such 
as subenvelope modulated (SEM) AC/AC converters and DC-modulated AC/AC converters have 
been created. These techniques successfully overcome the disadvantage of high THD. In addition, 
DC-modulated AC/AC converters have other advantages, for instance, multiphase outputs.
Due to the world’s increasing problem of energy resource shortage, the development of renew-
able energy sources, energy-saving techniques, and power supply quality has become an urgent 
issue. There is no time for delay. The renewable energy source systems require a large number of 
converters. For example, new AC/DC/AC converters are necessary in wind-turbine power systems, 
and DC/AC/DC converters are necessary in solar panel power systems.

1 Introduction
Power electronics is the technology of processing and controlling the flow of electric energy by 
supplying voltages and currents in a form that is optimally suited to the end-user’s requirements. 
A typical block diagram is given in Figure 1.1. The input power can be either AC or DC sources. 
A general example is one in which the AC input power is from the electric utility. The output power 
to the load can be either AC or DC voltages. The power processor in the block diagram is usually 
called a converter. Conversion technologies are used to construct converters. There are four types 
of converters: 
•	 AC/DC converters/rectifiers (AC to DC)
•	 DC/DC converters (DC to DC)
•	 DC/AC inverters/converters (DC to AC)
•	 AC/AC converters (AC to AC)
We will use converter as a generic term to refer to a single power conversion stage that may perform 
any of the functions listed earlier. To be more specific, during AC to DC and DC to AC conversion, 
the term rectifier refers to a converter in which the average power flow is from the AC to the DC 
side. The term inverter refers to a converter in which the average power flow is from the DC to the 
AC side. If the power flow through the converter is reversible, as shown in Figure 1.2, we refer to the 
converter in terms of its rectifier and inverter modes of operation.
1.1  SYMBOLS AND FACTORS USED IN THIS BOOK
In the current chapter, we list the factors and symbols used in this book. If no specific description is 
given, the parameters follow the meaning stated here.
1.1.1  Symbols Used in Power Systems
For instantaneous values of variables such as voltage, current, and power, which are functions 
of time, lowercase letters v, i, and p are, respectively, used. They are functions of time perform-
ing in the time domain. We may or may not explicitly show that they are functions of time, for 
example, using v rather than v(t). Uppercase symbols V and I refer to their computed values from 
their instantaneous waveforms. They generally refer to an average value in DC quantities and a 
root-mean-square (rms) value in AC quantities. If there is a possibility of confusion, the subscript 
average or rms is added explicitly. The average power is always indicated by P (Figure 1.1).
Usually, the input voltage and current are represented by vin and iin (or v1 and i1), and the output 
voltage and current are represented by vO and iO (or v2 and i2). The input and output powers are rep-
resented by Pin and PO. The power transfer efficiency (η) is defined as η = PO/Pin.
Passive loads such as resistor R, inductor L, and capacitor C are generally used in circuits. We 
use R, L, and C to indicate their symbols and values as well. All these three parameters and their 
combination Z are linear loads as the performance of the circuit constructed by these components is 
described by a linear differential equation. Z is used as the impedance of a linear load. If the circuit 
consists of a resistor R, an inductor L, and a capacitor C in series connection, the impedance Z is 
represented by

where R is the resistance measured in units of Ω, L is the inductance measured in H, C is the capaci-
tance measured in F, ω is the AC supply angular frequency measured in rad/s, and ω = 2πf where f 
is the AC supply frequency measured in Hz. For the calculation of Z, if there is no capacitor in the 
circuit, j(1/ωC) is omitted (do not take c = 0 and j(1/ωC) = >∞) (Figure 1.2). The absolute imped-
ance Z  and the phase angle φ are

Usually, the input current may not be a pure sinusoidal wave that depends on load. If the input 
voltage supplies a linear load (resistive, inductive, capacitive loads, or their combination), the input 
current i(t) is not distorted but may be delayed in a phase angle φ. In this case, it can be expressed as

Introduction
1.1.3  Factors and Symbols Used in DC Power Systems
We define the output DC voltage instantaneous value as vd and the average value as Vd (or Vd0). A 
pure DC voltage has no ripple; hence, it is called ripple-free DC voltage. Otherwise, a DC voltage is 
distorted, and consists of DC components and AC harmonics. Its rms value is Vd–rms. For a distorted 
DC voltage, the rms value Vd–rms is constantly higher than the average value Vd. The ripple factor 
(RF) is defined as

1.1.4  Factors and Symbols Used in Switching Power Systems
Switching power systems, such as power DC/DC converters, power pulse-width modulation (PWM) 
DC/AC inverters, soft-switching converters, and resonant converters, are widely used in power 
transfer equipment. In general, a switching power system has a pumping circuit and several energy-
storage elements. It is likely an energy container to store some energy during performance. The 
input energy does not flow smoothly through the switching power system from the input source to 
the load. The energy is quantified by the switching circuit and then pumped through the switching 
power system from the input source to the load.
We assume that the switching frequency is f and that the corresponding period is T = 1/f. The 
pumping energy (PE) is used to count the input energy in a switching period T. Its calculation for-
mula is

is the average value of the input current if the input voltage V1 is constant. Usually, the input average 
current I1 depends on the conduction duty cycle.
Energy storage in switching power systems has received much attention in the past. On the con-
trary, there is still no clear concept to describe the phenomena and reveal the relationship between 
the stored energy (SE) and its characteristics.
The SE in an inductor is

Usually, the SE is independent of switching frequency f (as well as switching period T). As inductor 
currents and capacitor voltages rely on the conduction duty cycle k, the SE also relies on k. We use 
SE as a new parameter in further descriptions.
Most switching power systems consist of inductors and capacitors. Therefore, we can define the 
capacitor–inductor stored energy ratio (CIR) as

As described in the previous sections, the input energy in a period T is the PE = Pin × T = VinIin × T. 
We now define the energy factor (EF), that is, the ratio of SE to PE, as

EF is a very important factor of a switching power system. It is usually independent of the conduc-
tion duty cycle and inversely proportional to switching frequency f as PE is proportional to switch-
ing period T.
The time constant τ of a switching power system is a new concept that describes the transient 
process. If there are no power losses in the system, it is defined as 
	
τ=

Introduction
This time constant τ is independent of switching frequency f (or period T = 1/f). It is available to 
estimate the system responses for a unit-step function and impulse interference. If there are power

If there are no power losses, η = 1, Equation 1.35 becomes Equation 1.34. Usually, if the power 
losses (lower efficiency η) are higher, the time constant τ is larger as CIR > 1.
The damping time constant τd of a switching power system is a new concept that describes the 
transient process. If there are no power losses, it is defined as

If there are no power losses, η = 1, Equation 1.39 becomes Equation 1.38. Usually, if the power 
losses (the lower efficiency η) are higher, the time constant ratio ξ is smaller as CIR > 1. From 
this analysis, most switching power systems with lower power losses possess larger output voltage 
oscillation when the converter operation state changes. On the other hand, switching power systems 
with high power losses will possess smoothening output voltage when the converter operation state 
changes.
By cybernetic theory, we can estimate the unit-step function response using the ratio ξ. If the 
ratio ξ is equal to or smaller than 0.25, the corresponding unit-step function response has no oscil-
lation and overshot. However, if the ratio ξ is greater than 0.25, the corresponding unit-step function 
response has oscillation and overshot. The higher the value of the ratio ξ, the heavier the oscillation 
with higher overshot.

1.1.5  Other Factors and Symbols
A transfer function is the mathematical modeling of a circuit and a system. It describes the dynamic 
characteristics of the circuit and the system. Using the transfer function, we can easily obtain the sys-
tem step and impulse responses by applying an input signal. A typical second-order transfer function is

where:
M is the voltage transfer gain (M = VO/Vin)
τ is the time constant (Equation 1.35)
τd is the damping time constant (Equation 1.37)
τd = ξτ (Equation 1.39)
s is the Laplace operator in the s-domain
By using this mathematical model of a switching power system, it is significantly easier to describe 
the characteristics of the transfer function. To appreciate the characteristics of the transfer function 
more fully, a few situations are given in the following.
1.1.5.1  Very Small Damping Time Constant
If the damping time constant is very small (i.e., τd << τ, ξ << 1) and it can be ignored, the value of 
the damping time constant τd is omitted (i.e., τd = 0, ξ = 0). The transfer function (Equation 1.40) 
is downgraded to first order as

impulse interference response is

where U is the interference signal. The interference recovering progress is nearly three times the 
time constant (3τ) and is shown in Figure 1.5 with τd = 0.
1.1.5.2  Small Damping Time Constant
If the damping time constant is small (i.e., τd < τ/4, ξ < 0.25) and cannot be ignored, the value of 
the damping time constant τd is not omitted. The transfer function (Equation 1.40) is retained as a 
second-order function with two real poles (–σ1 and –σ2) as

1.1.5.4  Large Damping Time Constant
If the damping time constant is large (i.e., τd > τ/4, ξ > 0.25), the transfer function 1.40 is a second-

Introduction
In this case, we call the item with radian frequency ω the fundamental harmonic and the items with 
radian frequency nω (n > 1) the higher order harmonics. Draw the amplitudes of all harmonics 
in the frequency domain. We obtain the spectrum in an individual peak. The item a0/2 is the DC 
component.
1.1.6.1  Central Symmetrical Periodical Function
If the periodical function is a central symmetrical periodical function, then all the items with cosine 
function disappear. The FFT remains as

We usually call this function an odd function. In this case, we call the item with radian frequency ω 
the fundamental harmonic and the items with radian frequency nω (n > 1) the higher-order harmon-
ics. Draw the amplitudes of all harmonics in the frequency domain. We obtain the spectrum in an 
individual peak. As it is an odd function, the DC component is zero.
1.1.6.2  Axial (Mirror) Symmetrical Periodical Function

The item a0/2 is the DC component. We usually call this function an even function. In this case, 
we call the item with radian frequency ω the fundamental harmonic and the items with radian 
frequency nω (n > 1) the higher order harmonics. Draw the amplitudes of all harmonics in the 
frequency domain. We obtain the spectrum in an individual peak. As it is an even function, the DC 
component is usually not zero.
1.1.6.3  Nonperiodical Function
The spectrum of a periodical function in the time domain is a discrete function in the frequency 
domain. If a function is a nonperiodical function in the time domain, it is possibly represented by 
Fourier integration. The spectrum is a continuous function in the frequency domain.

1.2  AC/DC RECTIFIERS
AC/DC rectifiers have been used in industrial applications for a long time now. Before the 1960s, 
most power AC/DC rectifiers were constructed using mercury-arc rectifiers. Then the large power 
silicon diode and the thyristor (or SCR—silicon-controlled rectifier) were successfully developed in 
the 1960s. Since then, all power AC/DC rectifiers have been constructed using power silicon diodes 
and thyristors.
By using a power silicon diode, we can construct uncontrolled diode rectifiers. Using a power thy-
ristor, we can construct controlled SCR rectifiers as the thyristor is usually triggered at firing angle 
α, which is variable. If the firing angle α = 0, the characteristics of the controlled SCR rectifier will 
return to those of the uncontrolled diode rectifier. Research on the characteristics of the uncontrolled 
diode rectifier enables designers to get an idea of the characteristics of the controlled SCR rectifier.
A single-phase half-wave diode rectifier is shown in Figure 1.12. The load can be a resistive load, 
inductive load, capacitive load, or back electromotive force load. The diode can be conducting when 
current flows from the anode to the cathode, and the corresponding voltage applied across the diode 
is defined as positive. However, the diode is blocked when the voltage applied across the diode is 
negative, and no current flows through it. Therefore, the single-phase half-wave diode rectifier sup-
plying different load has different output voltage waveform.

22
Power Electronics
There are three important aims for this book: 
•	 Clearing up the historic problems
•	 Introducing updated circuits
•	 Investigating power factor correction (PFC) methods
1.2.1  Historic Problems
Rectifier circuits are easily understood. The input power supply can be single-phase, three-phase, 
and multiphase sine-wave voltages. Usually, the more phases that an input power supplies to a 
circuit, the simpler the circuit operation. The most difficult analysis occurs in the simplest circuit. 
Although a single-phase diode rectifier circuit is the simplest circuit, analysis of it has not been 
discussed in any great detail. In fact, the results presented in many recently published papers and 
books have given the wrong idea.
1.2.2  Updated Circuits
Many updated circuits and control methods have been developed in the last 10 years. However, most 
of these updated circuits and control methods have yet to appear in dedicated books.
1.2.3  Power Factor Correction Methods
PFC methods have attracted the most attention in recent years. Many papers on PFC have been 
published but, as discussed earlier, there is a distinct lack of dedicated textbooks on this subject.
1.3  DC/DC CONVERTERS
DC/DC conversion technology is a vast subject area. It developed very fast and achieved much. 
There are believed to be more than 500 existing topologies of DC/DC converters according to cur-
rent statistics. DC/DC converters have been widely used in industrial applications such as DC motor 
drives, communication equipment, mobile phones, and digital cameras. Many new topologies have 
been developed in the recent decade. They will be systematically introduced in this book.
Mathematical modeling is the historic problem accompanying the development of DC/DC conver-
sion technology. From the 1940s onward, many scholars conducted research in this area and offered 
various mathematical modelings and control methods. We will discuss these problems in detail.
Most DC/DC converters have at least one pump circuit. For example, the buck–boost converter 
shown in Figure 1.13 has the pump circuit S–L. When the switch S is on, the inductor L absorbs 
energy from the source V1. When the switch S is off, the inductor L releases the SE to the load and 
to charge the capacitor C.

23
Introduction
From the example, we recognize that all energy obtained by the load must be a part of the energy 
stored in the inductor L. Theoretically, the energy transferred to the load looks no limit. In any 
particular operation, the energy rate cannot be very high. Consequently, power losses will increase 
sharply and the power transfer efficiency will largely decrease.
The following three important points will be emphasized in this book: 
•	 The introduction of updated circuits
•	 The introduction of new concepts and mathematical modeling
•	 Checking the power rates
1.3.1  Updated Converter
The voltage-lift conversion technique is widely used in electronic circuit design. Using this tech-
nique opened the flood gates for designing DC/DC converters with new topologies that were being 
developed in the last decade.
Furthermore, the super-lift technique and the ultra-lift technique have also been created. Both 
techniques facilitate on increase in the voltage transfer gains of DC/DC converters with the super-
lift technique being the most outstanding with regard to the DC/DC conversion technology.
1.3.2  New Concepts and Mathematical Modeling
DC/DC converters are an element in an energy control system. To obtain satisfactory perfor-
mance of the energy control system, it is necessary to know the mathematical modeling of the 
DC/DC converter used. Traditionally, the modeling of power DC/DC converters was derived from 
the impedance voltage-division method. The idea is that the inductor impedance is sL, and the 
inductor impedance is 1/sC, where s is the Laplace operator. The output voltage is the voltage 
divided by the impedance calculation. Actually, it successfully solves the problem of fundamental 
DC/DC converters. The transfer function of a DC/DC converter has an order number equal to the 
number of energy-storage elements. A DC/DC converter with two inductors and two capacitors 
has a fourth-order transfer function. Even more, a DC/DC converter with four inductors and four 
capacitors must have an eighth-order transfer function. It is hard to believe that it can be used for 
industrial applications.
1.3.3  Power Rate Checking
How can a large power be used in an energy system with DC/DC converters? This represents a very 
sensitive problem for industrial applications. DC/DC converters are quite different from transform-
ers and AC/DC rectifiers. Their output power is limited by the pump circuit power rate.

Power Electronics
The power rate of an inductor pump circuit depends on the inductance, applied current and cur-
rent ripple, and switching frequency. The energy transferred by the inductor pump circuit in a cycle 
T = 1/f is

Therefore, when designing an energy system with a DC/DC converter, we have to estimate the 
power rate.
1.4  DC/AC INVERTERS
DC/AC inverters were not widely used in industrial applications before the 1960s because of 
their complexity and cost. However, they were used in most fractional horsepower AC motor 
drives in the 1970s because AC motors have the advantage of lower cost when compared with 
DC motors, were smaller in size, and were maintenance free. In the 1980s, because of semi-
conductor development, more effective devices such as IGBT and MOSFET were produced, 
and DC/AC inverters started to be widely applied in industrial applications. To date, DC/AC 
conversion techniques can be sorted into two categories: PWM and multilevel modulation. 
Each category has many circuits to implement the modulation. By using PWM, we can design 
various inverters such as voltage-source inverters, current-source inverters, impedance-source 
inverters (ZSI), and multistage PWM inverters. A single-phase half-wave PWM is shown in 
Figure 1.14.
The PWM method is suitable for DC/AC conversion as the input voltage is usually a constant 
DC voltage (DC link). The pulse-phase modulation method is also possible but is less convenient. 
The pulse-amplitude modulation method is not suitable for DC/AC conversion as the input voltage 
is usually a constant DC voltage. PWM operation has all the pulses’ leading edge starting from the 
beginning of the pulse period, and their trailer edge is adjustable. The PWM method is a fundamen-
tal technique for many types of PWM DC/AC inverters such as voltage-source inverters, current-
source inverters, ZSI, and multistage PWM inverters.
Another group of DC/AC inverters are the multilevel inverters (MLI). These inverters were 
invented in the late 1970s. The early MLIs are constructed using diode-clamped and capacitor-
clamped circuits. Later, various MLIs were developed.

Introduction
Three important points will be examined in this book: 
•	 Sorting the existing inverters
•	 Introducing updated circuits
•	 Investigating soft-switching methods
1.4.1  Sorting Existing Inverters
As a large number of inverters exist, we have to sort them systematically. Some circuits have not 
been defined with an exact title and thus mislead readers’ understanding of the particular function.
1.4.2  Updated Circuits
Many updated DC/AC inverters have been developed in the last decade but have not yet been intro-
duced into textbooks. This book seeks to redress that point and show students the new methods.
1.4.3  Soft-Switching Methods
The soft-switching technique has been widely used in switching circuits for a long time now. It 
effectively reduces the power losses of equipment and increases the power transfer efficiency. A few 
soft-switching technique methods will be introduced into this book.
1.5  AC/AC CONVERTERS
AC/AC converters were not very widely used in industrial applications before the 1960s because of 
their complexity and cost. They were used in heating systems for temperature control and in light 
dimmers in cinemas, theaters, and nightclubs, or in bedroom night dimmers for light color and 
brightening control. The early AC/AC converters were designed by the voltage-regulation (VR) 
method. A typical single-phase VR AC/AC converter is shown in Figure 1.15.
VR AC/AC converters have been successfully used in heating and light-dimming systems. One 
disadvantage is that the output AC voltage of VR AC/AC converters is a heavily distorted waveform 
with a poor THD and PF. Other disadvantages are that the output voltage is constantly lower than 
the input voltage, and the output frequency is not adjustable.
Cycloconverters and matrix converters can change the output frequency, but the output voltage is 
also constantly lower than the input voltage. Their THD and PF are also very poor.

Power Electronics
DC-modulated AC/AC converters can easily give an output voltage higher than the input volt-
age, which will be discussed in this book. In addition, the DC-modulated method can successfully 
improve THD and PF.
1.6  AC/DC/AC AND DC/AC/DC CONVERTERS
AC/DC/AC and DC/AC/DC converters are designed for special applications. In recent years, it 
has been realized that renewable energy sources and distributed generations need to be developed 
rapidly because fossil energy sources (coal, oil, gas, etc.) will soon be exhausted. Sources such as 
solar panels, photovoltaic cells, fuel cells, and wind turbines have unstable DC and/or AC output 
voltages. They are usually part of a microgrid. It is necessary to use special AC/DC/AC and DC/AC/DC 
converters to link these sources to the general bus inside the microgrid.
Wind turbines have single-phase or multiphase AC output voltages with variable amplitude and 
frequency as the wind speed varies constantly. As it is difficult to use these unstable AC voltages for 
any application, we need to use an AC/DC/AC converter to convert them to a suitable AC voltage 
(single-phase or multiphase) with stable amplitude and frequency.
Solar panels have DC output voltages with variable amplitude due to the variations of avail-
able sunlight. As it is difficult to use these unstable DC voltages for any application, we need to 
use a DC/AC/DC converter to convert them to a suitable DC voltage with stable amplitude and 
frequency.

2 Uncontrolled AC/DC Rectifiers
Most electronic equipment and circuits require DC sources for their operation. Dry cells and 
rechargeable batteries can be used for these applications, but they only offer limited power 
and unstable voltage. The most useful DC sources are AC/DC rectifiers. The technology of 
AC/DC conversion is a wide subject area covering research investigation and industrial appli-
cations. AC/DC rectifiers convert an AC power supply source voltage to a DC voltage load. 
Uncontrolled AC/DC rectifiers usually consist of diode circuits. They can be sorted into the 
following groups: 
•	 Single-phase half-wave rectifiers
•	 Single-phase full-wave rectifiers
•	 Three-phase rectifiers
•	 Multipulse rectifiers
•	 Power factor correction (PFC) rectifiers
•	 Pulse-width-modulated boost-type rectifiers
As some of the theoretical analysis and calculation results in this book are different from that of 
some published papers and books, the associated underlying historical problems will be brought to 
the attention of the reader by way of ADVICE sections.
2.1  INTRODUCTION
The input of a diode rectifier is AC voltage, which can be either a single- or three-phase voltage, and 
is usually a pure sinusoidal wave. A single-phase input voltage v(t) can be expressed as 
	
v t
V

(2.1)
where:
v(t) is the instantaneous input voltage
V is the rms value
Vm is the amplitude
ω is the angular frequency where ω = 2πf (f is the supply frequency)
Usually, the input current i(t) is a pure sinusoidal wave with a phase shift angle ϕ if it is not distorted 
and is expressed as

where:

I is the rms value
Im is the amplitude
ϕ is the phase shift angle

Power Electronics
In this case, we define the PF as 
	
PF =
φ
cos 	
(2.3)
If the input current is distorted, it consists of harmonics. Its fundamental harmonic can be 
expressed as in Equation 1.17, and the DPF is defined in Equation 1.18. PF is measured as shown in 
Equation 1.19, and the THD is defined as in Equation 1.20.
When a pure DC voltage has no ripple, it is called a ripple-free DC voltage. Otherwise, DC volt-
age is distorted, and its rms value is Vd–rms. For a distorted DC voltage, its rms value Vd–rms is con-
stantly higher than its average value Vd. The RF is defined in Equation 1.24, and the FF is defined 
in Equation 1.25.
2.2  SINGLE-PHASE HALF-WAVE RECTIFIERS
A single-phase half-wave diode rectifier consists of a single-phase AC input voltage and one diode. 
Although it is the simplest rectifier, its analysis is the most complex. This rectifier can supply vari-
ous loads as described in the following subsections.
2.2.1  R Load
A single-phase half-wave diode rectifier with R load is shown in Figure 2.1a, and the input voltage, 
input current, and output voltage waveforms are shown in Figure 2.1b–d, respectively. The output 
voltage is similar to the input voltage in the positive half-cycle and zero in the negative half-cycle.

2.2.2  R–L Load
A single-phase half-wave diode rectifier with R–L load is shown in Figure 2.2a, whereas various 
circuit waveforms are shown in Figure 2.2b–d.
It can be seen that the load current flows not only in the positive half-cycle of the supply voltage 
but also in a portion of the negative half-cycle of the supply voltage. The load inductor SE maintains 
the load current, and the inductor’s terminal voltage changes so as to overcome the negative supply 
and keep the diode forward biased and conducting. Area A is equal to area B in Figure 2.2c. During 
diode conduction, the following equation is available:

This is a transcendental equation with an unknown value of β (Figure 2.3). The term sin(β – ϕ) is 
a sinusoidal function and the term e–(Rβ/ωL) sinϕ is an exponentially decaying function; the operat-
ing point of β is the intersection of sin(β – ϕ) and those terms. The value of β can be obtained 
by using MATLAB® simulation and can be solved by numerical techniques such as iterative 
methods.

34
Power Electronics
2.2.2.1  Graphical Method
Using MATLAB® to solve Equation 2.20, the resultant values of β for the corresponding values of 
ϕ are plotted as a graph shown in Figure 2.4. It can be observed that the graph commences at 180° 
(or π radians) on the β(x) axis and, for small values of ϕ, the characteristic is linear, 
	
β
π
≈
+ φ	
However, for large values of ϕ, the corresponding value of β tends to be 
	
β
π
>
+ φ	
with a terminal value of 2π (or 360°) for purely inductive load.
ADVICE
If L > 0, β > π + ϕ. By using the graph in Figure 2.4, a highly accurate result cannot be 
obtained. (Historic problem: β = π + ϕ.)

2.2.2.2  Iterative Method 1
The operating point setting: If β ≥ π + φ. Let starting point β = π + φ. 
L1: Calculate x = sin(β – ϕ).
Calculate y = –e–(Rβ/ωL) sinϕ.
If x = y, then β is the correct value, END.
If |x| < y, then increment β and return to L1.
If |x| > y, then decrement β and return to L1.
Example 2.1
A single-phase half-wave diode rectifier operates from a supply of V = 240 V, 50 Hz to a load of 
R = 10 Ω and L = 0.1 H. Determine the extinction angle β using iterative method 1.
Solution
From Equation 2.20, ϕ = tan–1 (ωL/R) = 72.34°.
Then, letting β1 = π + ϕ = 252.34°:
Step
β(°)
x = sin(β − ϕ)
y = e−(Rβ/ωL) sin ϕ

Therefore, to satisfy Equation 2.20, the best value is β = 265°.
2.2.2.3  Iterative Method 2
Let βn = π + ϕ. 
L1: Calculate x = sin(β – ϕ).
Calculate y = e–(RP/ωL) sinϕ.
Let x = y and βn+1 = (sin–1 y) + π + ϕ.
If βn+1 = βn then END. Else
Choose βn = βn+1 and return to L1.

2.2.3  R–L Circuit with Freewheeling Diode
The circuit in Figure 2.2a, which has an R–L load, is characterized by discontinuous and high 
ripple current. Continuous load current can result when a diode is added across the load as shown 
in Figure 2.5a.
The diode prevents the voltage across the load from reversing during the negative half-cycle of 
the supply voltage. When diode D1 ceases to conduct at zero volts, diode D2 provides an alternative 
freewheeling path as indicated by the waveforms in Figure 2.5b.
After a large number of supply cycles, steady-state load current conditions are established, and 
the load current is given by

2.2.4  An R–L Load Circuit with a Back emf
A single-phase half-wave rectifier to supply an R–L load with a back emf Vc is shown in Figure 2.6a. 
The corresponding waveforms are shown in Figure 2.6b.
The effect of introducing a back electromotive force Vc into the load circuit of a half-wave rec-
tifier is investigated in this section. This is the situation that would arise if such a circuit were

2.2.5  Single-Phase Half-Wave Rectifier with a Capacitive Filter
The single-phase half-wave rectifier shown in Figure 2.9 has a parallel R–C load. The purpose of 
the capacitor is to reduce the variation in the output voltage, making it more like a pure DC voltage.
Assuming the rectifier works in steady-state, the capacitor is initially charged in a certain DC 
voltage, and the circuit is energized at ωt = 0; the diode becomes forward biased at the angle ωt = α 
as the source becomes positive. As the source decreases after ωt = π/2, the capacitor discharges from 
the discharging angle θ into the load resistor. From this point, the voltage of the source becomes less 
than the output voltage, reverse biasing the diode, and isolating the load from the source. The output 
voltage is a decaying exponential with time constant RC, whereas the diode is off.

2.3  SINGLE-PHASE FULL-WAVE RECTIFIERS
Single-phase uncontrolled full-wave bridge circuits are shown in Figures 2.11a and 2.12a. They 
are called the center-tap (midpoint) rectifier and the bridge (Graetz) rectifier, respectively. Figures 
2.11a and 2.12a appear identical as far as the load is concerned. It can be seen in Figure 2.11a that 
two less diodes are employed, but a center-tapped transformer is required. The rectifying diodes in 
Figure 2.11a experience twice the reverse voltage, as do the four diodes in the circuit of Figure 2.12a. 
Similar to most industrial applications, use the bridge (Graetz) rectifier circuit; further analysis and 
discussion will be based on the bridge rectifier.

2.3.2  R–C Load
Linear and switch-mode DC power supplies require AC/DC rectification. To obtain a smooth out-
put, capacitor C is connected as shown in Figure 2.13.
Neglecting diode forward voltage drop, the peak of the output voltage is 2V. During each half-
cycle, the capacitor undergoes cyclic changes from vd(min) to 2V in the period between ωt = α and 
ωt = π/2, and discharges from 2V to vd(min) in the period between ωt = θ and ωt = π + α. The 
resultant output of the diode bridge is unipolar, but time dependent.

A single-phase full-wave diode rectifier with R–L load is shown in Figure 2.14a, whereas various 
circuit waveforms are shown in Figure 2.14b and c.
If the inductance L is large enough, the load current can be considered as a continuous constant 
current to simplify the analysis and calculations. It is accurate enough for theoretical analysis and 
engineering calculations. In this case, the load current is assumed to be a constant DC current.

3 Controlled AC/DC Rectifiers
Controlled AC/DC rectifiers are usually called controlled rectifiers. They convert an AC power 
supply source voltage to a controlled DC load voltage. Controlled AC/DC conversion technology is 
a vast subject area spanning research investigation to industrial applications. Usually, such rectifier 
devices are thyristors (or silicon-controlled rectifiers), gate-turn-off thyristors, power transistors, 
insulated gate bipolar transistors, and so on. Generally, the device used most is the thyristor (or 
silicon-controlled rectifiers). Controlled AC/DC rectifiers consist of thyristor/diode circuits, which 
can be sorted into the following groups: 
•	 Single-phase half-wave rectifiers
•	 Single-phase full-wave rectifiers with half/full control
•	 Three-phase rectifiers with half/full control
•	 Multipulse rectifiers
3.1  INTRODUCTION
As is the case of the diode rectifiers discussed in Chapter 2, it should be assumed that the diodes 
are replaced by thyristors or other semiconductor devices in controlled rectifiers, which are 
then supplied from an ideal AC source. Two conditions must be met before the thyristor can be 
conducting: 
	
1.	The thyristor must be forward biased.
	
2.	A current must be applied to the gate of the thyristor.
Only one condition must be met before the thyristor can be switched off: The current that flows 
through it should be lower than the latched value, irrespective of whether the thyristor is forward 
or reverse biased.
According to the aforementioned conditions, a firing pulse with a variable angle is then required 
to be applied to the gate of the thyristor. Usually, the firing angle is defined as α. If the firing angle 
α = 0, the thyristor functions as a diode. The corresponding output DC voltage of the rectifier is its 
maximum value. Referring to the results in Chapter 2, properly controlled rectifiers can be designed 
that satisfy industrial application needs.
3.2  SINGLE-PHASE HALF-WAVE CONTROLLED RECTIFIERS
A single-phase half-wave controlled rectifier consists of a single-phase AC input voltage and 
one thyristor. It is the simplest rectifier. This rectifier can supply various loads as described in the 
following subsections.
3.2.1  R Load
A single-phase half-wave diode rectifier with R load is shown in Figure 3.1a; the input voltage, out-
put voltage, and current waveforms are shown in Figure 3.1b–d. The output voltage is the same as 
the input voltage in the positive half-cycle and zero in the negative half-cycle.

3.2.2  R–L Load
A single-phase half-wave diode rectifier with an R–L load is shown in Figure 3.2a, whereas various 
circuit waveforms are shown in Figure 3.2b–d.
It can be seen that load current not only flows in the positive part of the supply voltage but also 
in a portion of the negative supply voltage. The load inductor stored energy (SE) maintains the load 
current, and the inductor’s terminal voltage changes so as to overcome the negative supply and keep 
the diode forward biased and conducting. The load impedance Z is

If the circuit involves an emf or battery Vc, the circuit diagram is shown in Figure 3.3. To guarantee 
that the thyristor is successfully fired on, the minimum firing angle is requested. If a firing angle is

3.3  SINGLE-PHASE FULL-WAVE CONTROLLED RECTIFIERS
Full-wave voltage control is possible with the circuits with an R–L load shown in Figure 3.4a 
and b. The circuit in Figure 3.4a uses a center-tapped transformer and two thyristors, which 
experience a reverse bias of twice the supply. At high powers in which a transformer may not be 
applicable, a four-thyristor configuration as in Figure 3.4b is suitable. The load current wave-
form becomes continuous when the (maximum) phase control angle α is given by

at which the output current is a rectifier sine wave.
For α > ϕ, discontinuous load current flows as shown in Figure 3.4c. At α = ϕ, the load cur-
rent becomes continuous as shown in Figure 3.4d, where β = α + π. A further decrease in α, 
that is, α < ϕ, results in continuous load current that is always greater than zero, as shown in 
Figure 3.4e.

Example 3.3
A full-wave controlled rectifier, shown in Figure 3.4, has an AC input of 240 V (rms) at 50 Hz with 
a load R = 10 Ω and L = 0.1 H in series. The firing angle α is 80°. 
	
a.	Determine whether the load current is discontinuous. If it be, find the extinction angle β 
to within an accuracy of 0.01° using iterative method 2 (Section 2.2.2.3).
	
b.	Derive expressions for current i and output voltage vO, and find the average output 
voltage VO.
Solution
	
a.	The thyristor firing angle α = 80°. As the firing angle α is greater than the load phase 
angle ϕ = tan–1 (ωL/R) = 72.34°, the load current is discontinuous. The extinction angle 
β is >π, but <(π + α) = 260°. The output voltage becomes negative when π ≤ ωt ≤ β.

Usually, the load is an inductive load, that is, R–L load. If the inductance is large enough, the load 
current is continuous for most of the firing angle α, and the corresponding voltage and current 
waveforms are shown in Figure 3.5b. Each thyristor conducts for 120° a cycle. If the load is a pure 
resistive load and the firing angle is 0 < α < π/6, the output voltage and current are continuous, and 
each thyristor is conducted in 120° a cycle. If the firing angle α > π/6 (or 30°), the output voltage and 
current are discontinuous, and each thyristor is conducting in the period between α and 150° a cycle.

As π/6 < α < 5π/6, the output current is always positive.
When α ≥ 5π/6, both the output voltage and current are zero. In this case, all thyristors are 
reversely biased when firing pulses are applied. Therefore, all thyristors cannot be conducting.

3.5  SIX-PHASE HALF-WAVE CONTROLLED RECTIFIERS
Six-phase half-wave controlled rectifiers have two constructions: six-phase with a neutral line circuit 
and double antistar with a balance-choke circuit. The following description is based on the R load 
or R plus large L load.
3.5.1  Six-Phase with a Neutral Line Circuit
If the AC power supply is from a transformer, four circuits can be used. The six-phase half-wave 
rectifiers are shown in Figure 3.7.
The power supply is a six-phase balanced voltage source. Each phase is shifted by 60°.

ducted in 60° a cycle. The firing angle α = ωt − π/3 in the range of 0–2π/3. As the load is an R–L

When the firing angle α is >π/2, the output voltage can have a negative value, but the output current 
can have only a positive value. This situation corresponds to the regenerative state.
These circuits have the following advantages: 
•	 A large output current can be obtained as there are two three-phase half-wave rectifiers.
•	 The output voltage has a lower ripple as each thyristor conducts at 120°.
3.6  THREE-PHASE FULL-WAVE CONTROLLED RECTIFIERS
A three-phase bridge is fully controlled when all six bridge devices are thyristors, as shown in 
Figure 3.9. The frequency of the output voltage ripple is six times the supply frequency. The average

Controlled AC/DC Rectifiers
The equation illustrates that the rectifier DC output voltage VO is positive when the firing angle 
α is <π/2 and becomes negative for a firing angle α > π/2. However, the DC current IO is always 
positive irrespective of the polarity of the DC output voltage.
When the rectifier produces a positive DC voltage, the power is delivered from the supply to the 
load. With a negative DC voltage, the rectifier operates in an inverter mode, and the power is fed 
from the load back to the supply. This phenomenon is usually used in electrical drive systems in 
which the motor drive is allowed to decelerate and the kinetic energy of the motor and its mechani-
cal load is converted to electrical energy and then sent back to the power supply by the thyristor 
rectifier for fast dynamic braking. The power flow in the thyristor rectifier is therefore bidirectional.

3.7  MULTIPHASE FULL-WAVE CONTROLLED RECTIFIERS
Figure 3.11 shows the typical configuration of a 12-pulse series-type controlled rectifier. There are 
two identical three-phase controlled rectifiers to be used. Two six-pulse controlled rectifiers are 
powered by a phase-shifting transformer with two secondary windings in delta and star connec-
tions. Therefore, the phase angle between both secondary windings shifts 30°.

The DC outputs of the rectifiers are connected in series. To dominate lower order harmonics in 
the line current iA, the line-to-line voltage va1b1 of the star-connected secondary winding is in phase 
with the primary voltage vAB, whereas the delta-connected secondary winding voltage va1b1 leads the

3.7.1  Effect of Line Inductance on Output Voltage (Overlap)
We now investigate a three-phase fully controlled rectifier as shown in Figure 3.9a. We partially 
redraw the circuit in Figure 3.13 (only show phase A and phase C). In practice, the cable length from 
phase A to A′ (or C to C′) has an inductance (L). The commutation process (e.g., for ia to replace ic) 
will take a certain time interval. This affects the voltage at point P to neutral point N and the final 
half output voltage is VPN. 
During the commutation process (e.g., for iA to replace iC), Kirchhoff’s voltage law for the com-
mutation loop and Kirchhoff’s current law at point P give the output current IO, which is filtered by a 
large inductance, and this implies that its change is much slower than that of iC and iA. We can write

Thus, the commutation interval duration due to the line inductance modifies the output voltage 
waveform (finite time for current change), and this changes the average output voltage by a reduc-
tion of (3/π)Lω. This can be compensated for by feedforward.
The above-mentioned figure shows how VPN is affected during the commutation interval u. It 
takes the midpoint value between the incoming phase (VAN) and outgoing phase (VCN) voltages. The 
corresponding currents iA and iC can be seen to rise and fall at finite rates. The rate of current change 
will be slower for high values of line electro-magnetic interference (EMI) and certain standards 
limit this rise time.

4 Implementing Power 
Factor Correction in 
AC/DC Converters
Power factor correction (PFC) is the capacity for generating or absorbing the reactive power pro-
duced by a load. Power-quality issues and regulations require rectifier loads to be connected to the 
utility to achieve high power factors (PFs). This means that a PFC rectifier needs to draw close to a 
sinusoidal current in phase with the supply voltage, unlike phase-controlled rectifiers (making the 
PFC rectifier look like a resistive load to the utility).
4.1  INTRODUCTION
Refer to the following formula: 
	
PF=
DPF
THD
1
2
+
	
where:
DPF is the displacement power factor
THD is the total harmonic distortion
We can explain DPF as the fundamental harmonic of the current that has a delay angle θ (or ϕ), 
that is, DPF = cos θ (or cos ϕ). THD is calculated using Equation 1.20. Most AC/DC uncontrolled 
and controlled rectifiers have poor PFs, except for the single-phase full-wave uncontrolled bridge 
(Graetz) rectifier with R load. All three-phase uncontrolled and controlled rectifiers have the input 
current fundamental harmonic delaying its corresponding voltage by an angle 30° plus α, where α is 
the firing angle of the controlled rectifier. Consequently, AC/DC rectifiers naturally have poor PFs. 
To maintain power quality, PFC is necessary. Implementing the PFC means 
•	 Reducing the phase difference between the line voltage and current (DPF ≥ 1)
•	 Shaping the line current to a sinusoidal waveform (THD ≥ 0)
The first condition requires that the fundamental harmonic of the current has a delay angle θ ≥ 0°. 
The second condition requires that the harmonic components are as small as possible. In recent 
research, the following methods have been used to implement PFC: 
	
1.	DC/DC-converterized rectifiers
	
2.	Pulse-width modulation (PWM) boost-type rectifiers
	
3.	Tapped-transformer converters
	
4.	Single-stage PFC AC/DC converters
	
5.	VIENNA rectifiers
	
6.	Other methods

4.2  DC/DC-CONVERTERIZED RECTIFIERS
A full-wave diode rectifier with R load has a high PF. If this rectifier supplies an R–C load, the PF 
is poor. Using a DC/DC converter in this circuit will improve the PF. The PFC rectifier circuit is 
shown in Figure 4.1.
The resistor emulation of the PFC rectifier is carried out by the DC/DC converter. The input 
to the DC/DC converter is a fully rectified sinusoidal voltage waveform. A constant DC voltage 
is maintained at the output of the PFC rectifier. The DC/DC converter is switched at a switching 
frequency fs that is many times higher than the line frequency f. The input current waveform into 
the diode bridge is modified to contain a strong fundamental sinusoid at the line frequency, but with 
harmonics at a frequency several times higher than the line frequency.
As the switching frequency fs is very high in comparison with the line frequency f, the input and 
output voltages of the PFC rectifier may be considered as constant throughout the switching period. 
Thus, the PFC rectifier can be analyzed like a regular DC/DC converter:

Tvv, in a supply period, is shown in Figure 4.2. The high-voltage transfer ratio in the vicinity 
of ωt = 0° and 180° can be achieved by using converters such as boost, buck–boost, or fly-back 
converters.
To prove this technique, a full-wave diode rectifier with R–C load (R = 100 Ω and C = 100 µF) 
and a buck–boost converter is investigated. Before applying any converter, the input voltage and 
current waveforms are shown in Figure 4.3. The fundamental harmonic of the input current delays 
the input voltage by an angle = 33.45°.
The harmonics (fast-Fourier transform [FFT] spectrum) of the input current are shown in 
Figure 4.4.
The harmonics, values are listed in Table 4.1.

A buck–boost converter (refer to Figure 5.7) is used for this purpose. The circuit diagram is shown 
in Figure 4.5.
The input voltage is 311 V (peak)/50 Hz. The duty ratio k is calculated as 20 chopping periods 
for a half-cycle. For one cycle, there are 40 chopping periods (maintain the same duty ratio) corre-
sponding to its frequency of 2 kHz. The inductance value was set as L = 0.6 mH and the capacitance 
value as 800 µF to maintain the output voltage at 200 V. The duty ratio k was calculated to set a 
constant DC output voltage of 200 V (Table 4.2).

Power Electronics
From the earlier investigation, we know that using a buck–boost converter to implement PFC can be 
successful, but the output voltage has a negative polarity. If a P/O Luo-converter or single-ended primary 
inductance converter (SEPIC) or a P/O buck–boost converter is used, we can obtain the P/O voltage.
Example 4.1
A P/O Luo-converter (see Figure 5.11) is used to implement PFC in a single-phase diode rectifier 
with an R–C load. The AC supply voltage is 240 V/50 Hz, and the required output voltage is 200 V. 
The switching frequency is 4 kHz. Determine the duty cycle k in a half supply period (10 ms). Other 
component values for reference are the following: R = 100, Ω = CO = 20 µF, and L1 = L2 = 10 mH.
Solution
As the supply frequency is 50 Hz and the switching frequency is 4 kHz, there are 40 switching 
periods in a half supply period (10 ms). The voltage transfer gain of the P/O Luo-converter is

By using this method, we can obtain the unity power factor (UPF). To obtain UPF, that is, PF = 1,

The DC/DC converter output current required for a UPF, as a function of angle θ, is shown in Figure 4.2.
As the input current to the DC/DC converter is to be shaped, the DC/DC converter is operated 
in a current-regulated mode.
4.3.1  DC-Side Pulse-Width Modulation Boost-Type Rectifier
The DC-side PWM boost-type rectifier is shown in Figure 4.11 in which i1
* is the reference of the 
desired value of the current i1. Here i1
* has the same waveform shape as |vs|. The amplitude of i1
* should 
be able to maintain the output voltage at a desired or reference level idc
* , in spite of the variation on load 
and the fluctuation of line voltage from its nominal value. The waveform of i1
* is obtained by measur-
ing |vs| and multiplying it by the amplified error between idc
*  and vdc. The actual current i1 is measured. 
The status of the switch in the DC/DC converter is controlled by comparing the actual current with i1
*.
Once i1
* and i1 are available, there are various ways of implementing the current-mode control of 
the DC/DC converter.

Implementing Power Factor Correction in AC/DC Converters
4.3.1.1  Constant-Frequency Control
Here, the switching frequency fs is kept constant. When i1 reaches i1
*, the switch in the DC/DC con-
verter is turned off. The switch is turned on by a clock period at a fixed frequency, fs. This method 
is likely an open-loop control. The operation indication is shown in Figure 4.12.
Example 4.2
A boost converter (refer to Figure 5.5) is used to implement PFC in the circuit shown in Figure 4.11a. 
The switching frequency is 2 kHz, L = 10 mH, Cd = 20 µF, R = 100 Ω, and the output voltage 
VO = 400 V. The AC supply voltage is 240 V/50 Hz. Determine the duty cycle k in a half supply 
period (10 ms).
Solution
As the supply frequency is 50 Hz and the switching frequency is 2 kHz, there are 20 switching 
periods in a half supply cycle (10 ms). The voltage transfer gain of the boost converter is

4.3.1.2  Constant-Tolerance-Band (Hysteresis) Control
Here, the constant i1 is controlled so that the peak-to-peak ripple (Irip) in i1 remains constant. With 
a preselected value of Irip, i1 is forced to be within the tolerance band (i1
* + Irip/2) and (i1
* – Irip/2) by 
controlling the switch status. This method is likely to be a closed-loop control. A current sensor is 
necessary to measure the particular current i1 to determine switch-on and switch-off. The operation 
indication is shown in Figure 4.13.
4.3.2  Source-Side Pulse-Width Modulation Boost-Type Rectifiers
In motor drive applications with regenerative braking, the power flow from the AC line is required 
to be bidirectional. A bidirectional converter can be designed using phase angle delay control but 
at the expense of poor input PF and high waveform distortion in the line current. It is possible to 
overcome these limitations by using a switch-mode converter, as shown in Figure 4.14.
The rectifier being the dominant mode of operation, is is defined with a direction. An inductance 
Ls (that augments the internal inductance of the utility source) is included to reduce the ripple in is at 
a finite switching frequency. The four switching devices [Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBTs) 
or Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor (MOSFETs)] are operated in PWM. Their 
switching frequency fs is usually measured in kilohertz. From Figure 4.14, we have

the converter is produced by a PWM that corresponds to a PWM in a linear region. The control cir-
cuit to regulate Vd in Figure 4.14 is shown in Figure 4.16. The reference value V*
d intends to achieve 
a UPF of operation. The amplified error between Vd and V*
d is multiplied by the signal proportional 
to the input voltage vs waveform to produce the reference signal i*
s. A current-mode control such as 
a tolerance band control or a fixed-frequency control can be used to deliver is equal to i*
s. The mag-
nitude and direction of power flow are automatically controlled by regulating Vd at its desired value.
4.4  TAPPED-TRANSFORMER CONVERTERS
A simple method to improve the PF is to use tapped-transformer converters. DC motor variable 
speed control drive systems are widely used in industrial applications. Some applications require 
the DC motor to run at lower speeds. For example, winding machines and rolling mills mostly work 
at lower speeds (lower than their 50% rated speed). If DC motors are supplied by AC/DC rectifiers, 
the lower speed corresponds to lower armature voltage.
Assume that the DC motor-rated voltage corresponding to the rectifier firing angle α is about 10°. 
The firing angle α will be about 60° if the motor runs at half rated speed. In the first case, the DPF 
is about (cos α), that is, DPF = 0.98. In the second case, the DPF is about 0.48. This means that the 
PF is very poor if the DC motor works at lower speed.
A tapped-transformer converter is shown in Figure 4.17a, which is a single-phase controlled 
rectifier. The original bridge consists of thyristors T1–T4. The transformer is tapped at 50% of the 
secondary winding. The third leg consists of thyristors T5–T6, which are linked at the tapped point 
at the middle point of the secondary winding. As the DC motor armature circuit has enough induc-
tance, the armature current is always continuous. The motor armature voltage is 
	
V
V

dO

cosα	
(4.18)
If the motor works at a lower speed, for example, at 45% of its rated speed, the corresponding ­firing 
angle α is about 64°. The output voltage waveform from the original bridge is shown in Figure 4.17b. 
The fundamental harmonic component sine wave must have the delay angle ϕ1 = α = 64° and 
DPF  =  cosα. After Fourier transform analysis and THD calculation, the voltage waveform in 
Figure 4.17b is 0.24. Therefore,

By keeping the same armature voltage, we obtain the voltage from legs 2 and 3, that is, thyristors T1 
and T2 are idled. This means that the input voltage is reduced by half the supply voltage, and the fir-
ing angle α′ is about 27.6°. The output voltage waveform from legs 2 and 3 is shown in Figure 4.17c.

In comparison with the PFs in Equations 4.19 and 4.20, it is obvious that the PF has been signifi-
cantly corrected.
This method is very simple and straightforward. The tapped point can be shifted to any other 
percentage (not fixed at 50%), depending on the applications.
A test rig can be constructed for collecting the measured results. The circuit is shown in 
Figure 4.18. The secondary voltage of the transformer is 230/115 V. The requested output voltage 
is set at 80 V.
If the supply voltage is 230 V, the firing angle is approximately 67°. The output voltage is shown 
in Figure 4.19, and the measured record is shown in Figure 4.20. PF is indicated to be 0.64.
If the supply voltage is 115 V, the firing angle is approximately 39.4°. The output voltage is 
shown in Figure 4.21, and the measured record is shown in Figure 4.22. The indication of the PF 
in it is 0.87.
If the output voltage increases to 103 V and the supply voltage remains at 115 V, the firing angle 
is approximately 1°. The output voltage is shown in Figure 4.23, and the measurement record is 
shown in Figure 4.24. PF is indicated to be 0.98.

4.5  SINGLE-STAGE POWER FACTOR CORRECTION AC/DC CONVERTERS
A double-current synchronous rectifier (DC-SR) converter is a popular circuit that is used in com-
puters. On the contrary, its PF is not so high. However, the single-stage PFC DC-SR converter is 
able to improve its PF nearly to unity. The circuit diagram is shown in Figure 4.25.
The system consists of an AC/DC diode rectifier and a DC-SR converter. Suppose that the out-
put inductors L1 and L2 are equal to each other, L1 = L2 = LO. There are three switches: main 
switch S and two auxiliary synchronous switches S1 and S2. It inherently exhibits high PF because 
the PFC cell operates in continuous conduction mode. In addition, it is also free to have high-
voltage stress across the bulk capacitor at light loads. To investigate the dynamical behaviors, the

Implementing Power Factor Correction in AC/DC Converters
averaging method is used to drive the DC operating point and the small-signal model. A propor-
tional–integral–­differential controller is designed to achieve output voltage regulation despite varia-
tions in line voltage and load resistance.
In power electronic equipment, the PFC circuits are usually added between the bridge rectifier 
and the loads to eliminate high harmonic distortion of the line current. In general, they can be 
divided into two categories: the two-stage approach and the single-stage approach. The two-stage 
approach includes a PFC stage and a DC/DC regulation stage. This approach has good PFC and 
fast output regulations, but the size and cost increase. To overcome the drawbacks, the graft scheme 
is proposed in reference. Many single-stage approaches have been proposed in the literature. They 
integrate a PFC cell and a DC/DC conversion cell to form a single stage with a common switch. 
Therefore, the sinusoidal input current waveform and the output voltage regulation can be simulta-
neously achieved, thereby meeting the requirements of performance and cost.

However, a high-voltage stress exists across the bulk capacitor CB at light loads if a DC/DC cell 
operates in discontinuous current mode. To overcome this drawback, a negative magnetic feedback 
technique has been proposed in the literature. However, the dead band exists in the input current, 
and the PF is thereby degraded. To deal with this problem, the DC/DC cell operates in discontinu-
ous current mode. The voltage across the bulk capacitor is independent of loads, and the voltage 
stress is effectively reduced.
4.5.1  Operating Principles
Figure 4.25 depicts the proposed single-stage high-PFC converter topology. A physical three-wind-
ing transformer has a turns ratio of 1:n:m. A tertiary transformer winding, in series with diode D4, is 
added to the converter for transformer flux resetting. The magnetizing inductance Lm is parallel with 
the ideal transformer. In the proposed converter, both the PFC cell and the DC/DC conversion cell 
are operating in continuous conduction mode. To simplify the analysis of the circuit, the following 
assumptions are made: 
	
1.	The large-valued bulk capacitor CB and the output capacitor CO are sufficiently large enough 
to allow the voltages across the bulk capacitor and the output capacitor to be approximately 
constant during one switching period Ts.
	
2.	All switches and diodes of the converter are ideal. The switching time of the switch and the 
reverse recovery time of the diodes are negligible.
	
3.	The inductors and the capacitors of the converter are considered to be ideal without para-
sitic components.
Based on the switching of the switch and diodes, the proposed converter operating in one switching 
period Ts can be divided into five linear stages as described next. 
Stage 1 [0,t1] (S: on; D1: on; D2: off; D3: off; D4: off; D5: on; D6: on): In the first stage, the 
switch S is turned on. The diodes D1, D5, and D6 are turned on, and the diodes D2, D3, and 
D4 are turned off. Power is transferred from the bulk capacitor CB to the output via the 
transformer.
Stage 2 [t1,t2] (S: off; D1: off; D2: on; D3: on; D4: on; D5: off; D6: off): The stage begins when 
the switch S is turned off. The diodes D2, D3, and D4 are turned on, and the diodes D1, D5, 
and D6 are turned off. The current iLi flows through diode D3 and charges the bulk capaci-
tor CB. Diode D4 is turned on for transformer flux resetting. In this stage, the output power 
is provided by the inductor LO.
Stage 3 [t2,t3] (S: off; D1: off; D2: on; D3: off; D4: on; D5: off; D6: off): The stage begins at t2 
when the input current iLi falls to zero, and thus diode D3 is turned off. Switch S is still off. 
All diodes, except D3, maintain their states as shown in the previous stage. During this 
stage, the voltages –vCB/m and –vO are applied across the inductors Lm and LO, and thus the 
inductor currents continue to decrease linearly. The output power is also provided by the 
output inductor LO.
Stage 4 [t3,t4] (S: off; D1: off; D2: off; D3: off; D4: on; D5: off; D6: off): The stage begins when 
the current iLO decreases to zero, and thus diode D2 is turned off. Switch S is still off. Diode 
D4 is still turned on, and diodes D1, D3, D5, and D6 are still turned off. During this stage, the 
voltage –vCB/m is applied across inductor Lm. The inductor current continues to decrease 
linearly. The output power is provided by the output capacitor CO in this stage.
Stage 5 [t4,t5] (S: off; D1: off; D2: off; D3: off; D4: off; D5: off; D6: off): The stage begins when 
the current iLm falls to zero, and thus diode D4 is turned off. Switch S is still off, and all 
diodes are off. The output power is also provided by the output capacitor CO. The operation 
of the converter returns to the first stage when switch S is turned on again.

4.5.2  Mathematical Model Derivation
In this section, the small-signal model of the proposed converter can be derived by the averag-
ing method. The moving average of a variable, voltage or current, over one switching period Ts is 
defined as the area, encompassed by its waveform and time axis, divided by Ts.
4.5.2.1  Averaged Model over One Switching Period Ts
There are six storage elements in the proposed converter in Figure 4.25. The state variables of the 
converter are chosen as the current through the inductor and the voltage across the capacitor. As both 
PFC cells and DC/DC cells operate in discontinuous current mode, the initial and final values of 
inductor currents vanish in each switching period Ts. From a system point of view, the inductor cur-
rents iLi, iLO, and iLm should not be considered as state variables. Only the bulk capacitor voltage vCB 
and the output capacitor voltage vCO are considered to be state variables of the proposed converter.
For notational brevity, a variable with an upper bar denotes its moving average over one switch-
ing period Ts. With the aid of this definition, the averaged state-variable description of the converter 
is given by

provided with a UPF.
4.5.2.2  Averaged Model over One Half Line Period TL
Based on the derived averaged model described by Equation 4.30 over one switching period Ts, we now 
proceed to develop the averaged model over one half line period TL. As the bulk capacitance and the 
output capacitance are sufficiently large, both capacitor voltages can be considered as constants over TL. 
Therefore, the state equations of the averaged model over one half line period TL can be given by

proposed converter exhibits low voltage stress across the bulk capacitor for a 110 VAC input voltage.
After determining the DC operating point, we proceed to derive the small-signal model linear-
ized around the operating point. To proceed, small perturbations

4.5.3  Simulation Results
The PSpice simulation results presented in Figure 4.27 demonstrate that both PFC and DC/DC 
cells are operating in discontinuous current mode. The input inductor current iLi(t) and the output 
inductor current iLO(t) both reach zero for the remainder of the switching period. Figure 4.28a pres-
ents the bulk capacitor voltage VCB = 149 V, and Figure 4.28b presents the output capacitor voltage 
VCO = 110 V. They are close to the theoretical results VCB = 146.6 V and VCO = 108 V.
4.5.4  Experimental Results
A prototype based on the topology depicted in Figure 4.25 was built and tested to verify the oper-
ating principle of the proposed converter. The experimental results are depicted in the following 
figures. Figure 4.29a presents the rectified line voltage and current. Figure 4.29b presents the input 
line voltage and current. This reveals that the proposed converter has a high PF. According to the 
THD obtained in the simulation results, PF = 0.999.

4.6  VIENNA RECTIFIERS
The VIENNA rectifier can be used to improve the PF of a three-phase rectifier. The critical input 
inductor is calculated for the nominal load condition, and both PF and THD are degraded in the 
low-output power region. A novel strategy implementing reference compensation current is pro-
posed on the basis of the operation principle of the VIENNA rectifier in this section. This strategy 
can realize a three-phase three-level UPF rectifier. With the proposed control algorithm, the con-
verter draws high-quality sinusoidal supply currents and maintains good DC-link voltage regulation 
under wide load variation. Theoretical analysis is initially verified by digital simulation. Finally, 
experimental results of a 1-kVA laboratory prototype system confirm the feasibility and effectivity 
of the proposed technique.
Diode rectifiers with smoothing capacitors have been widely used in many three-phase power 
electronic systems such as DC motor drives and switch-mode power supplies. However, this topol-
ogy injects large current harmonics into utilities, which result in the decrease of PF. Expressions of 
the current THD and the input PF are given as

The international standards presented in IEC 1000-3-2 and EN61000-3-2 imposed harmonic restric-
tions to modern rectifiers that stimulated a focused research effort on the topic of UPF rectifiers. A 
slew of new topologies, including those based on three-level power conversion, have been proposed 
to realize high-quality input waveforms.
Among the reported three-phase rectifier topologies, the three-phase star-connected switch 
three-level (VIENNA) rectifier is an attractive choice because its switch voltage stress is one-half 
the total output voltage. This rectifier with three bidirectional switches, three input inductors, and 
two series-connected capacitors is shown in Figure 4.33.
Each bidirectional switch is turned on when the corresponding phase voltage crosses the zero-
volt point and conducts for 30° of the line voltage cycle. Thus, the input current waveform is well 
shaped and approximately sinusoidal. The input current THD can be as low as 6.6%, and the PF 
can be as high as 0.99. In addition, the bidirectional switches conduct at twice the line frequency; 
therefore, the switching losses are negligible.
However, the optimal input inductance required to obtain such a result is usually large, and this 
technique was proposed for the rectifier operating with a fixed load and a fixed optimal input induc-
tor. Therefore, the DC-link voltage is sensitive to load variation, and high performance is achieved 
within a very limited output power range.
To overcome these drawbacks, some control strategies have been proposed. A control strategy 
that takes into account the actual load level on the rectifier is proposed in reference. With this 
method, high performance can be achieved within a wide output power range. The required opti-
mal input inductance for a prototype rated at 8 kW is about 4 mH. This method is especially suit-
able for medium-to-high-power applications. However, for low-power application (i.e., 1–5 kW), the 
required optimal input inductance should be larger: for example, around 24 mH for a converter with 
rated power 1.5 kW. This can result in a bulky and impractical structure.
The ramp comparison current control presented in reference derives the duty cycle by a com-
parison of the current error with the fixed-frequency carrier signal. The ripple current in the input 
inductor makes the current error noisy, although synchronization is carefully considered. Another

approach that features constant switching frequency was proposed on the basis of integration con-
trol. The input voltage sensors were eliminated in the integration control. However, a significant 
low-frequency distortion can be observed in the input currents. Recently, a synchronous-reference-
frame-based hysteresis current control (HCC) was adopted as the inner loop and DC-link voltage 
control as the outer loop, but a reference-frame transformation was required that increased the 
controller operation time (digital signal processor). A hysteresis current controller was proposed in 
references. The switching signals are generated by the comparison of a reference current template 
(sinusoidal) with the measured main currents. Although this approach is easy to implement, one 
needs to measure the DC current, and the equipment is costly.
The novel control method proposed in this chapter was based on the operation principle of the 
VIENNA rectifier. The VIENNA rectifier is composed of two parts: an active compensation cir-
cuit and a conventional rectifier circuit. The harmonics injected by a conventional rectifier can be 
compensated by the active compensation circuit, which enables the input PF to be increased. The 
average real power consumed by the load is supplied by the source, and the active compensation 
circuit does not provide or consume any average real power. Then the reference compensational 
current can be obtained. The conduction period of bidirectional switches (Sa, Sb, and Sc) is con-
trolled by using HCC. The idea is that a high switching frequency results in the input inductor 
size being effectively reduced. This control method does not need to measure the DC-link current 
and so results in the decrease of the equipment size and cost. Simulation and experimental results 
have shown that the input PF can be significantly improved, and the input current harmonics can 
be effectively eliminated under wide load variation. The proposed control strategy also maintains 
good DC-link voltage.
4.6.1  Circuit Analysis and Principle of Operation
The AC/DC converter topology shown in Figure 4.33 is composed of a three-phase diode rectifier 
with two identical series-connected capacitors and three bidirectional switches (Sa, Sb, and Sc). The 
switches consist of four diodes and a MOSFET to form a bidirectional switch (Figure 4.34).
These bidirectional switches are controlled by using HCC to ensure good supply current wave-
form, constant DC-link voltage, and accurate voltage balance between the two capacitors. In 
Figure 4.33, the voltage sources vsa, vsb, and vsc denote the three-phase AC system. The waveforms 
and the current of phase a (isa) are shown in Figure 4.35.
For the circuit analysis (Figure 4.35), six topological stages are presented, corresponding to a 
half-cycle (0°–180°), which refer to the input voltage vsa as shown in Figure 4.35; for simplicity, only 
the components where current is present are pictured at each of those intervals.
In the interval between 0° and 30° (Figure 4.36a and b), the polarities of the source voltages vsa 
and vsc are positive with that of vsb negative. When the bidirectional switch Sa is on, the source cur-
rent isa flows through Sa, and diodes D5 and D6 are on. The other diodes not shown in Figure 4.36a 
are off. When the bidirectional switch Sa is off, the current isa flowing through the input inductor 
is continued through diode D1 and diodes D5 and D6 are still on. The other diodes not shown in 
Figure 4.36b are off. The current commutation from Sa to D1 is at a certain moment determined by 
HCC. Diodes D5 and D6 offer a conventional rectifying wave. Switch Sa and diode D1 turn on exclu-
sively and offer the active compensation current.

rent isb flows through Sb and diodes D1 and D2 are on. The other diodes not shown in Figure 4.36i are

ues through diode D3, and diodes D1 and D2 are still on. The other diodes not shown in Figure 4.36j

by HCC. Diodes D3 and D2 offer a conventional rectifying wave. Switch Sa and diode D1 turn on 
exclusively and offer the active compensation current.
An active compensation circuit is composed of one of the bidirectional switches and an off-diode 
in the rectifier bridge legs, but the other legs act as a conventional rectifier. So there are two circuits 
in the VIENNA rectifier, namely the conventional rectifier circuit and the active compensation cir-
cuit. Thus, the load average real power is supplied by the source (the same as a conventional recti-
fier), and the active compensation circuit does not provide or consume any real power.
4.6.2  Proposed Control Arithmetic
The proposed controller is based on the requirement that the source currents need to be balanced, 
undistorted, and in phase with the source voltages. The functions of the active compensation circuit 
are to (1) unitize supply PF, (2) minimize average real power consumed or supplied by the active 
compensation circuit, and (3) compensate harmonics and reactive currents. To carry out the func-
tions, the desired three-phase source currents of Equation 4.44 must be in phase with the source 
voltages of Equation 4.45:

where Vm and ϕ are the voltage magnitude and the phase angle of the source voltages, respectively. 
Under the conditions that the load active power is supplied by the source and the active compensa-
tion circuit does not provide or consume any real power, the current magnitude Im needs to be deter-
mined from the sequential instantaneous voltage and real power components supplied to the load. 
According to the symmetrical component transformation for the three-phase rms currents at each

4.6.3  Block Diagram of the Proposed Controller for the VIENNA Rectifier
Figure 4.37 depicts the block diagram of the control circuit based on the proposed approach to fulfill 
the function of the reference compensation current calculator. The source voltages are input to a phase 
locked-loop in which the peak voltage magnitude Vm, the unity voltages (i.e., vsk/Vm), and the period T 
are generated. The average real power of the load consumed is calculated using Equation 4.55 and 
is input to a divider to obtain the desired source current amplitude Im in Equation 4.56. DI denotes 
the calculation of definite integral. The desired source currents in Equation 4.57 and the reference 
compensation currents of the active compensation circuit in Equation 4.58 are computed by using 
the voltage magnitude and the unity voltages.
Once the reference compensation currents are determined, they are input to a current controller 
to produce control signals to the bidirectional switches. The block diagram of the proposed control 
scheme is shown in Figure 4.38. The bidirectional switches are controlled by the HCC technique 
to ensure sinusoidal input current with UPF and DC-link voltage. In addition, as the capacitor volt-
age must be maintained at a constant level, the power losses caused by switching and capacitor 
voltage variations are supplied by the source. The sum of the power losses, psw, is controlled via a 
proportional-integral controller and is then input to the reference compensation current calculator. 
As the rectifier provides continuous input currents, the current stresses on the switching devices are 
smaller and the critical input inductor size can be reduced.
4.6.4  Converter Design and Simulation Results
To verify the performance of the proposed control strategy, a MATLAB®–SIMULINK® prototype 
of the rectifier is developed. A sinusoidal PWM voltage source inverter, which is a very popular 
topology in industry, is used as the DC/AC inverter for the intended rectifier–inverter AC motor 
drive topology (Figure 4.39).

Implementing Power Factor Correction in AC/DC Converters
To illustrate the design feasibility of the proposed converter, a prototype with the following 
specifications is chosen: 
	
1.	Input line-to-line voltage 220 V
	
2.	DC-link reference voltage 370 V
	
3.	Input inductance 5 mH
	
4.	Rated output power 1 kW
AMATLAB–SIMULINK model for the proposed rectifier–inverter structure is developed to per-
form the digital simulation. Figure 4.40 shows the converter input phase current waveform and its 
harmonic spectrum at rated output power operation. The same waveform for a conventional con-
verter is shown in Figure 4.41.
Before improvement, the THD of the rectifier input current was found to be 91.5%, and the input 
PF was 0.72. After improvement, the input current THD was 3.8%, and the input PF was 0.999. 
Thus, with the proposed reference compensation current strategy, the harmonics are effectively 
reduced, and the PF is dramatically increased.
To show the performance of the converter under varying load conditions, it is operated in the 
following and above its rated value. The converter input phase current waveform and its harmonic

0.996, and the input current THD is 4.0%.
The converter input phase current waveform and its harmonic spectrum at 150% rated output 
power are shown in Figure 4.43. The converter input PF is found to be 0.999, and the input current 
THD is 3.7%. It is evident that the proposed control strategy has a good adaptability to different 
load conditions. This strategy can also be used for rectifiers operating at various rated power levels.
The figure illustrates the input phase currents and DC-link voltage waveforms when the con-
verter output power demand changes instantaneously from 50% to 100% of its rated value due to 
load disturbance. The load change was initiated at 0.26 s where the converter was in steady state.

Implementing Power Factor Correction in AC/DC Converters
One can clearly see that the converter exhibits a good response to the sudden load variation. From 
this figure, it can be seen that this proposed control technique has a good adaptability to load varia-
tion (Figure 4.44).
4.6.5  Experimental Results
The control system is implemented using a single-board dSPACE 1102 microprocessor and is devel-
oped under the integrated development of MATLAB–SIMULINK RTW provided by The Math 
Works. A1-kW hardware prototype of the rectifier–inverter structure as shown in Figure 4.39 was 
constructed, and its performance was observed.
The rectifier input current and voltage waveforms before and after improvements are shown in 
Figures 4.45 and 4.46, respectively. The fluke-43 spectrum analyzer with online numerical value 
illustration is used to monitor the waveforms. The input PF is shown online at the upper right-hand 
side of Figures 4.45 and 4.46. Prior to improvement, the input current THD and PF were 91.5% and 
0.72, respectively.
The proposed scheme is able to improve the input current THD to 3.8% and the input PF to 
0.99. There is a remarkable improvement in PF and THD. The experimental results are identical 
to the MATLAB predicted ones calculated on the basis of the waveforms in Figures 4.40 and 4.41. 
­Figures 4.47 and 4.48 show the experimental input current FFT spectrum for a typical conventional 
converter and the proposed converter, respectively.
At 50% rated output power, the converter input PF is found to be 0.99, and the input current THD 
has increased to 4.0%, as shown in Figure 4.49. At 150% rated output power, the converter input PF 
is found to be 0.99, and the input current THD is reduced to 3.7% (Figure 4.50).

Implementing Power Factor Correction in AC/DC Converters
Figure 4.51 shows the DC-link voltage waveforms when the converter output power demand 
changes instantaneously from 50% to 100% of its rated value responding to load disturbance. One 
can see that with the proposed control strategy, the converter exhibits a good response to sudden 
load variation.
To investigate the effect of input inductance, this was varied as well. Under 3 and 7 mH input 
inductances, the converter input currents and voltages are shown in Figures 4.52 and 4.53, respec-
tively. These results illustrate that the proposed converter with bidirectional switches coupled with 
the proposed strategy overcomes most of the shortcomings of the conventional converters such as 
change of input PF due to output power, input inductance, and load torque variations.

5 Ordinary DC/DC Converters
According to certain statistics, there are more than 600 prototypes at present of DC/DC. In their 
book Advanced DC/DC Converters, the authors have systematically sorted them into six categories. 
According to the systematic categorization, the ordinary converters introduced in the current book 
will fall under these generations.
5.1  INTRODUCTION
DC/DC conversion technology is an important area of research and has industrial applications. 
Since the last century, the DC/DC conversion technique has been extensively developed and there 
are now many new topologies of DC/DC converters. DC/DC converters are now widely used in 
communication equipment, cell phones and digital cameras, computer hardware circuits, dental 
apparatus, and other industrial applications. As there are a lot of DC/DC converters, we have sorted 
them into six generations: first- (classical/traditional), second- (multiquadrant), third- (switched-
component), fourth- (soft-switching), fifth- (synchronous rectifier), and sixth- (multielement reso-
nant power) DC/DC converters.
The first-generation DC/DC converters are so-called classical or traditional converters. These 
converters operate in a single-quadrant mode and in a low power range (up to 100 W). As there are 
a large number of prototype converters in this generation, they are further sorted into the following 
six categories: 
•	 Fundamental converters
•	 Transformer-type converters
•	 Developed converters
•	 Voltage-Lift (VL) converters
•	 Super-Lift converters
•	 Ultra-Lift converters
Fundamental converters such as the buck converter, boost converter, and buck–boost converter are 
named after their functions. These three prototypes perform basic functions and therefore will be 
investigated in detail. On account of the effects of parasitic elements, the output voltage and power 
transfer efficiency of these converters are restricted. As a consequence, transformer-type and devel-
oped converters were created.
The VL technique is a popular method that is widely applied in electronic circuit design. Applying 
this technique can effectively overcome the effects of parasitic elements and greatly increase the 
voltage transfer gain. Therefore, these DC/DC converters can convert the source voltage into a 
higher output voltage with a high power efficiency, a high power density, and a simple structure. 
The super- and ultra-Lift techniques are even more powerful methods that are used to increase the 
voltage transfer gain in power series.
The second-generation converters perform two-quadrant or four-quadrant operation with output 
power in a medium range (say, 100–1000 W). These converters are usually used in industrial appli-
cations, for example, DC motor drives with multiquadrant operation. As most second-generation 
converters are still made of capacitors and inductors, they are large in size.

134
Power Electronics
The third-generation converters are called switched-component DC/DC converters; as they are 
made of either capacitors or inductors, they are called switched-capacitor converters or switched-
inductor converters, respectively. They usually perform two-quadrant or four-quadrant operation 
with output power in a high range (say, 1000 W). As they consist of only capacitors or inductors, 
they are small in size.
Switched-capacitor DC/DC converters consist of capacitors only. As switched-capacitors can 
be integrated into power semiconductor integrated circuit chips, they have a limited size and 
work at a high switching frequency. They have been successfully employed in inductorless DC/
DC converters, and this has opened up the way for the construction of converters with a high 
power density. As a consequence, they have received a great deal of attention from research 
workers and manufacturers. However, most switched-capacitor converters in the literature per-
form single-quadrant operation and work in the push–pull status. In addition, their control circuit 
and topologies are very complex due to the large difference between input and output voltages.
Switched-inductor DC/DC converters consist of inductors only and have been derived from 
four-quadrant choppers. They usually perform multiquadrant operation with a very simple 
structure. Two advantages of these converters are simplicity and high power density. No matter 
how large the difference between the input and output voltages, only one inductor is required 
for each switched-inductor DC/DC converter. Consequently, they are widely used in industrial 
applications.
The fourth-generation converters are called soft-switching converters. The soft-switching 
technique involves many methods for implementing resonance characteristics with resonant 
switching a popular method. There are two main groups of fourth-generation converters: zero 
current switching (ZCS) and zero voltage switching (ZVS). As described in the literature, they 
usually perform in single-quadrant operation.
ZCS and ZVS converters have large current and voltage stresses. In addition, the conduction 
duty cycle k and switching frequency f are not individually adjusted. To overcome these draw-
backs, zero-voltage-plus-zero-current-switching and zero-transition converters were developed, 
which implement the ZVS and ZCS techniques in the operation. As the switches turn on and off 
at the moment when the voltage and/or current is equal to zero, the power losses during switch-
ing-on and switching-off become zero. As a consequence, these converters have a high power 
density and high transfer efficiency. Usually, the repeating frequency is not very high, and the 
converter works in the resonance state. As the components of higher order harmonics are very 
low, the electro-magnetic interference (EMI) is low and electro-magnetic susceptibility (EMS) 
and electro-magnetic compatibility (EMC) should be reasonable.
The fifth-generation converters are called synchronous rectifier DC/DC converters. Corresponding 
to the development of microelectronics and computer science, power supplies with low output volt-
age and strong current are widely required in industrial applications. These power supplies provide 
very low voltages (5, 3.3, 2.5, and 1.8–1.5 V) and a strong current (30, 60, and 100–200 A) with a 
high power density and a high power transfer efficiency (88%, 90%–92%). Traditional diode bridge 
rectifiers are not available for this requirement. The new type of synchronous rectifier DC/DC con-
verters can realize these technical features.
The sixth-generation converters are called multielement resonant power converters (RPC). 
There are eight topologies of two-element RPC, 38 topologies of three-element RPC, and 98 
topologies of four-element RPC. Those are widely applied in military equipment and industrial

The DC/DC converter family tree is shown in Figure 5.1. 
In this book, the input voltage is represented by V1 and/or VI (Vin), the output voltage by 
V2 and/or VO, the input current by I1 and/or II (Iin), and the output current by I2 and/or IO. The 
switching frequency is represented by f, and the switching period is represented by T = 1/f. The 
conduction duty cycle/ratio is represented by k, and k is the ratio of the switching-on time over 
the period T. The value of k is in the range of 0 < k < 1.

5.2  FUNDAMENTAL CONVERTERS
Fundamental converters are exemplified by the buck converter, the boost converter, the buck–boost 
converter, and the positive output (P/O) buck–boost converter. Considering the input current 
­continuity, we can divide all DC/DC converters into two main modes: continuous input current 
mode (CICM) and discontinuous input current mode (DICM). The boost converter operates in 
CICM, whereas the buck converter and the buck–boost converter operate in DICM.

5.2.1  Buck Converter
A buck converter is shown in Figure 5.2a. It converts the input voltage into output voltage that is 
less than the input voltage. Its switch-on and switch-off equivalent circuits are shown in Figure 5.2b 
and c.
5.2.1.1  Voltage Relations
When switch S is on, the inductor current increases. For easy analysis in the steady state, we assume 
that the capacitor C is large enough (the ripple can be negligible), namely vC = V2. Therefore, we 
have

For the period of time kT, the inductor current increases at a constant slope (V1 – V2)/L (Figure 5.3). 
The inductor current starts at the initial value Imin and changes to a top value Imax at the end of the 
switch-closure period.
When the switch is off, the inductor current decreases and freewheels through the diode. We 
have the following equations:

The output voltage (capacitor voltage) depends solely on the duty cycle k and the input voltage. 
From Figure 5.3, it can be seen that the input source current i1 (which is equal to switch current is) 
is discontinuous. Consequently, the buck converter operates in DICM.

5.2.1.4  Capacitor Voltage Ripple
The condition that there are no ripples in the capacitor voltage is now relaxed to allow a small ripple. 
This has only a second-order effect on the currents calculated in the previous section, so the previ-
ous results can be used without change.
As noted previously, to have periodic operation, the capacitor current must be entirely alternat-
ing. The graph of the capacitor current needs to be as shown in Figure 5.4 for the continuous induc-
tor current. The peak value of this triangular waveform is (Imax – Imin)/2. The resulting ripple in the 
capacitor voltage depends on the area under the curve of the capacitor current versus time. The 
charge added to the capacitor in a half-cycle is given by the triangular area above the axis:

switching frequency f = 20 kHz, and conduction duty cycle k = 0.6. Calculate the output voltage 
and its ripple in the steady state. Does this converter work in continuous conduction mode (CCM) 
or discontinuous conduction mode (DCM)?

5.2.2  Boost Converter
If the three elements S, L, and D of the buck converter are rearranged as shown in Figure 5.5a, a 
boost converter is created. Its equivalent circuits during switch-on and switch-off are shown in 
Figure 5.5b and c.

From Equation 5.22, we can see that if k is large, the output voltage V2 can be very large. In fact, 
as k approaches unity, the output voltage decreases rather than increasing because of the effect of 
circuit parasitic elements. The value of k must be limited within a certain upper limit (say 0.9) to 
prevent such a problem. Practical limits to this also become important for an increase in the voltage 
transfer gain, for example, 10. The switch may be open for only a very short time (0.1 T as k = 0.9).

The load current value I2 is given by I2 = V2/R, and the average current flowing through the capacitor 
is zero. The instantaneous capacitor current is likely a triangular waveform, which is approximately 
(iL – I2) during switch-off and –I2 during switch-on. From Figure 5.6, the input source current 
i1 = is = iL is continuous. Hence, the buck converter operates in CICM.
5.2.2.3  Continuous Current Condition
When the imin is equal to zero, the minimum inductance can be determined to ensure a continuous 
inductor current. Using Equation 5.26 and solving it, we obtain

5.2.4  Positive Output Buck–Boost Converter
Traditional buck–boost converter is convenient to be used for some applications that require the 
output voltage be either higher or lower than the input voltage. On the contrary, its output voltage 
polarity is negative, which is restricted for many applications, for example, solar energy systems. 
Figure 5.10 shows the circuit of positive output buck–boost converter. The output voltage is calcu-
lated by the formula,

By using this converter, it is easy to obtain a random positive output voltage, higher or lower than, 
or equal to the input voltage. It provides great convenience for industrial applications.
5.3  P/O BUCK-AND-BOOST CONVERTER
Traditional buck–boost converter has negative output (N/O) voltage. In some applications, changing 
the voltage polarity is not allowed. For example, the Li-ion battery is the common choice for most 
portable applications such as mobile phones and digital cameras. With the increasing use of low-
voltage portable devices and increasing requirements of functionalities embedded into such devices, 
efficient power management techniques are needed for a longer battery life. The voltage of a single 
Li-ion battery varies from 4.2 to 2.7 V. A DC/DC converter is needed to maintain the varying volt-
age of the Li-ion battery at a constant value of 3.3 V. This converter needs to operate in both the 
step-up and step-down conditions. Smooth transition from the buck mode to the boost mode is the 
most desired criterion for a longer battery life. A P/O buck-and-boost converter with two indepen-
dent controlled switches is shown in Figure 5.11.
There are three operation modes shown in Figure 5.12: 
•	 Buck operation mode, if V1 is higher than V2
•	 Boost operation mode, if V1 is lower than V2
•	 Buck–boost operation mode, if V1 is similar to V2

Here V2 = 3.3 V for this application.
This converter can work as a buck converter or a boost converter depending on input–output 
voltages. The problem of output regulation with guaranteed transient performances for noninverting 
buck-and-boost converter topology is discussed. Various digital control techniques are addressed, 
which can smoothly perform the transition job. In the first two modes, the operation principles are 
the same as those of the buck converter and the boost converter described in the previous section. 
The third operation needs to be described here.
5.3.1  Buck Operation Mode
When the input voltage V1 is higher than the output voltage V2 (e.g., V1 > 1.03V2, say 3.4 V), the posi-
tive buck-and-boost converter can be operated in the buck operation mode. In this case, the switch 
S2 is constantly open, and the diode D2 will be constantly on. The remaining components are the 
same as those of a buck converter.
5.3.2  Boost Operation Mode
When the input voltage V1 is lower than the output voltage V2 (e.g., V1 > 0.97V2, say 3.2 V), the posi-
tive buck-and-boost converter can be operated in the boost operation mode. In this case, the switch 
S1 is constantly on, and the diode D1 will be constantly blocked. The remaining components are the 
same as those of a boost converter.
5.3.3  Buck-and-Boost Operation Mode
When the input voltage V1 is nearly equal to the output voltage V2 (e.g., 3.2 V < V1 < 3.4 V), the 
positive buck-and-boost converter can be operated in the buck-and-boost operation mode. In this 
case, both the switches S1 and S2 switch on and switch off simultaneously. When the switches are 
on, the inductor current increases: 
	
∆i

When the switches are off, the inductor current decreases:

(5.44)
Hence,

(5.45)
The other parameters can be determined by the corresponding formulae of the normal buck–boost 
converter. Therefore, the positive buck–boost converter operates in buck–boost operation mode, 
and the output voltage keeps positive polarity.
When this converter works in buck operation mode and buck–boost operation mode, its input 
current is discontinuous, that is, it works in DICM.
5.3.4  Operation Control
The general control block diagram is shown in Figure 5.13. It implements two functions: logic con-
trol to select the operation mode and voltage closed-loop control to keep the output voltage constant.

149
Ordinary DC/DC Converters
Refer to Figure 5.13. When the input voltage V1 is higher than the upper limit voltage, for exam-
ple, 1.03Vref (here the upper limit voltage is set as 3.4 V) as the point A in Figure 5.12, the P/O buck–
boost converter operates in the buck mode. When the input voltage V1 is lower than the lower limit 
voltage, for example, 0.97Vref (the upper limit voltage is set as 3.2 V) as the point B in Figure 5.12, 
the P/O buck–boost converter operates in the boost mode. When the input voltage V1 is that between 
the upper and lower limit voltages, for example, 0.97Vref < V1 < 1.03Vref, the P/O buck-and-boost 
converter operates in the buck-and-boost mode.
The output voltage feedback signal compares with the Vref = 3.3 V to regulate the duty cycle k 
to keep the output voltage V2 = 3.3 V. To analyze the performance of the system during operation 
in the buck-and-boost modes and the behavior of the system in transition, the typical parameters 
of the converter are shown in Table 5.1. The voltage source is modeled to act as a single-cell Li-ion 
battery, the voltage of which varies from V1H = 4.2 V when it is fully charged to V1L = 2.7 V when 
it is not charged.
A proportional-integral controller is used for voltage closed-loop control. All logic operations and 
the voltage feedback control diagram of the P/O buck-and-boost converter are shown in Figure 5.14.
The simulation results are shown in Figure 5.15.
A test rig is constructed for experimental testing. The measured results are shown in Table 5.2.

5.4  TRANSFORMER-TYPE CONVERTERS
Transformer-type converters consist of transformers and other parts. They can isolate the input and 
output circuits and have additional voltage transfer gain corresponding to the winding turn’s ratio n. 
After reviewing popular topologies, a few new circuits will be introduced: 
•	 Forward converter
•	 Fly-back converter
•	 Push–pull converters
•	 Half-bridge converters
•	 Bridge converters
•	 Zeta converter
5.4.1  Forward Converter
A forward converter is the first transformer-type converter and is widely applied in industrial 
applications.
5.4.1.1  Fundamental Forward Converter
The forward converter as shown in Figure 5.16 is a transformer-type topology, which consists of a 
transformer and other parts in the circuits. This converter insolates the input and output circuitry. 
Therefore, the output voltage can be applied in any floating circuit. Furthermore, as the secondary 
winding polarity is reversible, it is very convenient to perform N/O and multiquadrant operation.

In this text explanation, the polarity is shown in Figure 5.16, which means that the output voltage 
is positive.
In Figure 5.16, n is the transformer turn’s ratio, and k is the conduction duty cycle. The turn’s ratio 
n can be any value greater or smaller than unity; the conduction duty cycle k is definitely smaller 
than unity.
The equivalent circuits during switching-on and switching-off are shown in Figure 5.17a and b.

The ripple-less condition in the capacitor voltage is now relaxed to allow a small ripple. This has 
only a second-order effect on the currents calculated in the previous section; so the previous results 
can be used without change.
As noted previously, the capacitor current must be entirely alternating to have periodic opera-
tion. The graph of the capacitor current must be as shown in Figure 5.17 for a continuous inductor 
current. The peak value of this triangular waveform is located at (Imax – Imin)/2. The resulting ripple 
in the capacitor voltage depends on the area under the curve of capacitor current versus time. The 
charge added to the capacitor in a half-cycle is given by the triangular area above the axis:

The tertiary winding very much exploits the core magnetization ability and reduces the trans-
former size largely.
5.4.1.3  Switch Mode Power Supplies with Multiple Outputs
In many applications, more than one output is required, with each output likely to have dif-
ferent voltage and current specifications. A forward converter with three outputs is shown in 
Figure 5.21. Each output voltage will be determined by the turn’s ratio n1, n2, or n3. The three 
output voltages are

However, multiple outputs can be readily obtained by using any of the converters that have an 
isolating transformer, by employing a separate secondary winding for each output, as shown in the 
forward converter in Figure 5.21.

5.4.3  Push–Pull Converter
A push–pull converter works in the push–pull state, which effectively avoids the iron core satura-
tion. Its circuit diagram is shown in Figure 5.23. As there are two switches working alternatively, 
the output voltage is doubled. The output voltage is calculated by 
	
V
nkV
O

(5.60)
where n is the transformer turn’s ratio and k is the conduction duty cycle, k = ton/T.

To reduce the primary side in one winding, a half-bridge converter was constructed. Its circuit dia-
gram is shown in Figure 5.24. The output voltage is calculated by
	
V

(5.61)
where n is the transformer turn’s ratio, and k is the conduction duty cycle, k = ton/T.
5.4.5  Bridge Converter
A bridge converter is shown in Figure 5.25. The transformer has a couple of identical secondary 
windings. The primary circuit is a bridge inverter; hence, it is called a bridge converter. As the two 
pairs of the switches work symmetrically with 180° phase-angle shift, the transformer iron core is 
not saturated, and the magnetizing characteristics have been fully exploited. No tertiary winding is 
required. The secondary side contains an antiparalleled diode full-wave rectifier. It is likely that the 
two antiparalleled forward converters work together.

To avoid short circuit, each pair of the switches can be switched on only in the phase angle 0°–180°; 
usually it is set at 18°–162°. The corresponding conduction duty cycle k is in the range of 0.05–0.45.
The circuit analysis is also similar to the forward converter. Some voltage and current waveforms 
are shown in Figure 5.26. The repeating period is T/2 in bridge converter operation, whereas it is T 
in forward converter operation.

5.4.6  Zeta Converter
A zeta converter is a transformer-type converter with a low-pass filter. Its circuit diagram is shown 
in Figure 5.27. Many people do not know its original circuit and mistakenly call a P/O VL Luo-
converter Elemental circuit as a zeta converter. The output voltage ripple of the zeta converter is 
small. The output voltage is calculated by

5.5  DEVELOPED CONVERTERS
All the developed converters are derived from fundamental converters. As there are more compo-
nents, the output voltage ripple is smaller. Five types of developed converters are introduced in this 
section. They are 
•	 P/O Luo-converter
•	 N/O Luo-converter
•	 Double output (D/O) Luo-converter
•	 Cúk-converter
•	 Single-ended primary inductance converter (SEPIC)
5.5.1  P/O Luo-Converter (Elementary Circuit)
A P/O Luo-converter (elementary circuit) is shown in Figure 5.28a. The capacitor C acts as the pri-
mary means of storing and transferring energy from the input source to the output load via the pump 
inductor L1. Assuming the capacitor C to be sufficiently large, the variation of the voltage across the 
capacitor C from its average value VC can be neglected in the steady state, that is, vC(t) ≈ VC, even 
though it stores and transfers energy from the input to the output.

Power Electronics
When the switch S is on, the source current iI = iL1 + iL2. The inductor L1 absorbs energy from the 
source. In the meantime, the inductor L2 absorbs energy from the source and the capacitor C, and both 
currents iL1 and iL2 increase. When the switch S is off, source current iI = 0. Current iL1 flows through 
the freewheeling diode D to the charge capacitor C. The inductor L1 transfers its stored energy (SE) 
to the capacitor C. In the meantime, the inductor current iL2 flows through the (CO – R) circuit and 
freewheeling diode D to keep itself continuous. Both currents iL1 and iL2 decrease. To analyze the 
progress in the circuit’s working, the equivalent circuits in switching-on and switching-off states are 
shown in Figure 5.28b–d.
Actually, the variations of currents iL1 and iL2 are small so that iL1 ≈ IL1 and iL2 ≈ IL2. The charge 
on the capacitor C increases during switch-off:

To investigate the variation of output voltage vO, we have to calculate the charge variation on the

sponds to the area of the triangle with the height of half of ΔiL2 and the width of half of the repeating

5.5.2  N/O Luo-Converter (Elementary Circuit)
The N/O Luo-converter (elementary circuit) and its switch-on and switch-off equivalent circuits 
are shown in Figure 5.32. This circuit can be considered as a combination of an electronic pump 
S–L–D–(C) and a “Π”-type low-pass filter C–LO–CO. The electronic pump injects certain energy to 
the low-pass filter in each cycle. The capacitor C in Figure 5.32 acts as the primary means of storing 
and transferring energy from the input source to the output load. Assuming the capacitor C to be 
sufficiently large, the variation of the voltage across the capacitor C from its average value VC can 
be neglected in the steady state, that is, VC(t) ≈ VC, even though it stores and transfers energy from 
the input to the output.

6 Voltage Lift Converters
The ordinary DC/DC converter has limited voltage-transfer gain. Considering the effects of the 
component called parasitic elements, the conduction duty cycle k can only be 0.1 < k < 0.9. This 
restriction blocks ordinary DC/DC converter voltage-transfer gain increase. The VL technique is a 
common method used in electronics circuitry design to amplify output voltage. By using this tech-
nique in DC/DC conversion technology, we can design, stage by stage, voltage lift (VL) power con-
verters with high voltage transfer gains in arithmetic progression. It opens the way to significantly 
increase the voltage-transfer gain of DC/DC converters. By using this technique, the ­following 
series of VL converters are designed: 
•	 P/O Luo-converters
•	 N/O Luo-converters
•	 D/O Luo-converters
•	 VL Cúk-converters
•	 VL SEPIC
•	 Other VL D/O converters
•	 Switched-capacitorized (SC) converters
6.1  INTRODUCTION
The VL technique is applied to the periodical switching circuit. Usually, a capacitor is charged, 
during switch-on, by a certain voltage, for example, the source voltage. This charged capacitor 
voltage can be arranged on top-up to some parameter, for example, output voltage during switch-
off. Therefore, the output voltage can be lifted higher. Consequently, this circuit is called a self-lift 
circuit. A typical example is the sawtooth wave generator with a self-lift circuit.
Repeating this operation, another capacitor can be charged by a certain voltage that is possibly 
the input voltage or other equivalent voltages. The second capacitor-charged voltage can also be 
arranged on top-up to some parameter, especially the output voltage. Therefore, the output voltage 
can be higher than that of a self-lift circuit. Usually, this circuit is called a relift circuit.
Analogously, this operation can be repeated many times. Consequently, the series circuits are 
called a triple-lift circuit, a quadruple-lift circuit, and so on.
On account of the effect of parasitic elements, the output voltage and power-transfer efficiency of 
DC–DC converters are limited. The VL technique offers a good way of improving circuit character-
istics. After long-term research, this technique has been successfully applied to DC–DC converters. 
Three series of Luo-converters have now been developed from prototypes using the VL technique. These 
converters perform DC–DC voltage increasing conversion with high power density, high efficiency, 
and cheap topology in a simple structure. They are different from other DC–DC step-up converters 
and possess many advantages, including the high output voltage with small ripples. Therefore, these 
converters will be widely used in computer peripheral equipment and industrial applications, espe-
cially for high-output-voltage projects. The contents of the current chapter are arranged as follows: 
	
1.	Seven types of self-lift converters
	
2.	P/O Luo-converters
	
3.	N/O Luo-converters
	
4.	Modified P/O Luo-converters
	
5.	D/O Luo-converters

By using the VL technique, we can easily obtain the other series of VL converters. For example, VL 
Cúk-converters, VL SEPICs, other types of D/O converters, and SC converters.
6.2  SEVEN SELF-LIFT CONVERTERS
All self-lift converters introduced here are derived from developed converters such as Luo-
converters, Cúk-converters, and SEPICs, which were described in Section 5.5. As all circuits are 
simple, usually only one more capacitor and diode are required; the output voltage is higher than the 
input voltage. The output voltage is calculated by

Seven circuits were developed: 
•	 Self-lift Cúk-converter
•	 Self-lift P/O Luo-converter
•	 Reverse self-lift P/O Luo-converter
•	 Self-lift N/O Luo-converter
•	 Reverse self-lift Luo-converter
•	 Self-lift SEPIC
•	 Enhanced self-lift P/O Luo-converter
These converters perform DC–DC voltage increasing conversion in simple structures. In these 
­circuits, the switch S is a semiconductor device [metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor 
(MOSFET), bipolar junction transistor (BJT), insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT), etc.]. It is 
driven by a pulse-width modulation (PWM) switching signal with variable frequency f and conduction 
duty cycle k. For all circuits, the load is usually resistive, that is, R = VO/IO.
The normalized impedance ZN is

where Leq is the equivalent inductance.
We concentrate on the absolute values rather than polarity in the description and calculations 
given in the following. The directions of all voltages and currents are defined and shown in the cor-
responding figures. We also assume that the semiconductor switch and the passive components are 
all ideal. All capacitors are assumed to be large enough that the ripple voltage across the capacitors 
can be negligible in one switching cycle for the average value discussions.
For any component X (C, L, etc.), its instantaneous current and voltage are expressed as iX and vX. 
Its average current and voltage values are expressed as Ix and Vx. The output voltage and current are 
VO and IO; the input voltage and current are VI and II. T and f are the switching period and frequency.

Here, ID refers to the average current iD that flows through the diode D during the switch-off period, 
and not its average current over the whole period.
A detailed analysis of the seven self-lift DC–DC converters is given in the following sections. 
Due to the limit on the length of the book, only the simulation and experimental results of the

should be quite similar to those of the self-lift Cúk-converter.
6.2.1  Self-Lift Cúk-Converter
The self-lift Cúk-converter and its equivalent circuits during the switch-on and switch-off periods 
are shown in Figure 6.1. It is derived from the Cúk-converter. During the switch-on period, S and D1 
are on and D is off. During the switch-off period, D is on and S and D1 are off.

The voltage-transfer gain of the self-lift Cúk-converter is the same as the original boost converter. 
However, the output current of the self-lift Cúk-converter is continuous, with small ripples.
The output voltage of the self-lift Cúk-converter is higher than the corresponding Cúk-converter 
by an input voltage. It retains one of the merits of the Cúk-converter. They both have continuous 
input and output currents in the CCM. As for component stress, it can be seen that the self-lift Cúk-
converter has a smaller voltage and current stresses than the original Cúk-converter.
6.2.1.2  Discontinuous Conduction Mode
The self-lift Cúk-converter operates in the discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) if the current iD 
decreases to zero during switch-off. A special case is seen when iD decreases to zero at t = T, then, 
the circuit operates at the boundary of CCM and DCM. The variation ratio of current iD is 1 when the 
circuit works in the boundary state: 
	
ξ =

where zN is the normalized load R/(fL). The boundary between CCM and DCM is shown in 
Figure 6.3a. The curve that describes the relationship between MB and zN has the minimum value 
MB = 1.5 and k = 1/3 when the normalized load zN is 13.5.
When M > MB, the circuit operates in the DCM. In this case, the diode current iD decreases to 
zero at t = t1 = [k + (1 – k)m]T, where kT < t1 < T and 0 < m < 1.

From the aforementioned equation, we can see that the DCM is caused by the following factors: 
•	 Switching frequency f is too low
•	 Duty cycle k is too small
•	 Inductance L is too small
•	 Load resistor R is too big
In the DCM, current iL increases during switch-on and decreases in the period from kT to (1 – k) mT. 
The corresponding voltages across L are VI and –(VC – VI). Therefore,

The relationship between DC voltage transfer gain M and the normalized load at various k in the 
DCM is also shown in Figure 6.3b. It can be seen that in the DCM, the output voltage increases as 
the load resistance R increases.

During the switch-on period, the voltage across capacitor C1 is equal to the source voltage. As we 
assume that C and C1 are sufficiently large, VC1 = VI.
The inductor current iL increases in the switch-on period and decreases in the switch-off period. 
The corresponding voltages across L are VI and –(VC – VC1). Therefore, kTVI = (1 – k)T (VC – VC1). 
Hence, VO = (1/(1 – k))VI.

C = C1 = CO = 20 µF, R = 40 Ω, f = 50 kHz, and k = 0.5. Calculate the output voltage and the

From the calculations, the variations of iL1, iL2, vC, and vC1 are small. The output voltage vO (also vC1) 
is almost a real DC voltage with very small ripples. On account of the resistive load, the output 
current iO (iO = vO/R) is almost a real DC waveform with very small ripples as well.
6.2.3  Reverse Self-Lift P/O Luo-Converter
The reverse self-lift P/O Luo-converter and its equivalent circuits during the switch-on and switch-

During the switch-on period, S and D1 are on and D is off. During the switch-off period, D is on, 
and S and D1 are off.

During the switch-on period, the voltage across capacitor C is equal to the source voltage and the

6.2.3.2  Discontinuous Conduction Mode
The reverse self-lift P/O Luo-converter operates in the DCM; if the current iD decreases to zero dur-
ing switch-off at t = T, then the circuit operates at the boundary of CCM and DCM. The variation 
ratio of current iD is 1 when the circuit works in the boundary state:

where zN is the normalized load R/(fLeq), and Leq refers to Leq = LLO/(L + LO).
When M > MB, the circuit operates in the DCM. In this case, the diode current iD decreases to 
zero at t = t1 =  [k + (1 – k) m]T, where kT < t1 < T and 0 < m < 1. Here, m is the current filling fac-

In the DCM, current iL increases during switch-on and decreases in the period from kT to (1 – k)mT. 
The corresponding voltages across L are VI and –VC.
Therefore, kTVI = (1 – k)mTVC and VC1 = VCO = VO, VC1 = VI + VC.

6.2.4  Self-Lift N/O Luo-Converter
The self-lift N/O Luo-converter and its equivalent circuits during the switch-on and switch-off 
periods are shown in Figure 6.6. It is the self-lift circuit of the N/O Luo-converter. The function 
of capacitor C1 is to lift the voltage VC to a level higher than the source voltage VI. S and D1 are on 
and D is off during the switch-on period. D is on and S and D1 are off during the switch-off period.
6.2.4.1  Continuous Conduction Mode
In steady state, the average of inductor voltages over a period is zero. Thus, VC = VCO = VO. During 
the switch-on period, the voltage across capacitor C1 is equal to the source voltage. As we assume 
that C and C1 are sufficiently large, VC1 = VI.
The inductor current iL increases in the switch-on period and decreases in the switch-off period. 
The corresponding voltages across L are VI and –(VC – VC1).
Therefore, kTVI = (1 – k)T(VC – VC1).

As all the components are considered to be ideal, the power loss associated with all the circuit ele-
ments is neglected. Therefore, the output power PO is considered to be equal to the input power PIN: 
VOIO = VIII. Thus, II = (1/(1 – k))IO. The capacitor CO acts as a low-pass filter so that ILO = IO.

6.2.6  Self-Lift SEPIC
The self-lift SEPIC and its equivalent circuits during the switch-on and switch-off periods are 
shown in Figure 6.8. It is derived from the SEPIC (with output filter). S and D1 are on and D is off 
during the switch-on period, whereas D is on and S and D1 are off during the switch-off period.
6.2.6.1  Continuous Conduction Mode
In the steady state, the average voltage across inductor L over a period is zero. Thus, VC = VI. During 
the switch-on period, the voltage across capacitor C1 is equal to the voltage across C. As we assume 
that C and C1 are sufficiently large, VC1 = VC = VI.
In the steady state, the average voltage across inductor LO over a period is also zero. Thus, 
VC2 = VCO = VO.
The inductor current iL increases in the switch-on period and decreases in the switch-off period. 
The corresponding voltages across L are VI and –(VC – VC1 + VC2 – VI).

Enhanced self-lift positive output Luo-converters are shown in Figure 6.9. Type A is derived from 
the self-lift positive output Luo-converter in Figure 6.4 with swapping the positions of switch S and 
inductor L (renumbered L to L1).

6.3.1  Relift Circuit
The relift circuit and its equivalent switch-on and switch-off circuits are shown in Figure 6.10, 
which is derived from the self-lift circuit. Capacitors C1 and C2 perform characteristics to lift the 
capacitor voltage VC to a level 2 times higher than the source voltage VI. L3 performs the function of 
a ladder joint to link the two capacitors C1 and C2 and lifts the capacitor voltage VC up.
When switches S and S1 are turned on, the source’s instantaneous current iI = iL1 + iL2 + iC1 + 
iL3 + iC2. Inductors L1 and L3 absorb energy from the source. In the meantime, inductor L2 absorbs 
energy from the source and capacitor C. Three currents iL1, iL3, and iL2 increase. When switches S and 
S1 turn off, the source current iI = 0. Current iL1 flows through capacitor C1, inductor L3, capacitor C2, 
and diode D to charge capacitor C. Inductor L1 transfers its SE to capacitor C. In the meantime, current 
iL2 flows through the (CO – R) circuit, capacitor C1, inductor L3, capacitor C2, and diode D to keep itself 
continuous. Both currents iL1 and iL2 decrease. To analyze the progress of the working of the circuit, 
the equivalent circuits in switch-on and switch-off states are shown in Figure 6.10b–d. Assume that 
capacitors C1 and C2 are sufficiently large, and the voltages VC1 and VC2 across them are equal to VI in 
steady state.
Voltage vL3 is equal to VI during switch-on. The peak-to-peak variation of current iL3 is

Example 6.2
A P/O relift Luo-converter has the following components: VI = 20 V, L1 = L2 = 1 mH, L3 = 0.5 mH, 
and all capacitors have 20 μF, R = 160 Ω, f = 50 kHz, and k = 0.5. Calculate the output voltage 
and the variation ratios ξ1, ξ2, ζ, χ1, ρ, σ1, σ2, and ε in steady state.
Solution
From Equation 6.72, we obtain the output voltage as 
	
V
k V

The variation ratios are ξ1 = 0.2, ξ2 = 0.2, ζ = 0.1, χ1 = 0.1, ρ = 0.0016, σ1 = 0.0125, σ2 = 0.0125, 
and ε = 1.56 × 10–4. Therefore, the variations are small.
From the example, we know the variations are small. Therefore, the output voltage vO is almost 
a real DC voltage with very small ripples. On account of the resistive load, the output current iO(t) 
is almost a real DC waveform with very small ripples as well, and IO = VO/R.
For DCM, referring to Figure 6.10d, we can see that the diode current iD becomes zero during 
switch-off before the next period switch-on. The condition for the DCM is ζ ≥ 1, that is,

That is, the output voltage linearly increases as the load resistance R increases. The output voltage 
versus the normalized load zN = R/fL is shown in Figure 6.12. Larger load resistance R may cause 
higher output voltage in the discontinuous mode.

tor voltage VC up. Currents iC1(t), iC2(t), and iC3(t) are exponential functions. They have large values at 
the moment of switching power on, but they are small because vC1 = vC2 = vC3 = VI in steady state.

6.3.3  Quadruple-Lift Circuit
The quadruple-lift circuit, shown in Figure 6.16, consists of two static switches S and S1; five induc-
tors L1, L2, L3, L4, and L5; six capacitors C, C1, C2, C3, C4, and CO; and seven diodes. Capacitors C1, 
C2, C3, and C4 perform characteristics to lift the capacitor voltage VC to a level 4 times higher than 
the source voltage VI. L3, L4, and L5 perform the function of ladder joints to link the capacitors 
C1, C2, C3, and C4, and lift the output capacitor voltage VC up. Current iC1(t), iC2(t), iC3(t), and iC4(t) 
are exponential functions. They have large values at the moment of power on, but they are small 
because vC1 = vC2 = vC3 = vC4 = VI in steady state.

The boundaries between continuous and discontinuous modes of all circuits are shown in 
Figure 6.20. The curves of all M versus zN suggest that the continuous mode area increases from 
ME via MS, MR, MT to MQ. The boundary of an elementary circuit is a monorising curve, but other 
curves are not monorising. There are minimum values of the boundaries of other circuits that for 
MS, MR, MT, and MQ correspond at k = 1/3.

6.4  N/O LUO-CONVERTERS
N/O Luo-converters perform the voltage conversion from positive to negative voltages using the VL 
technique. They work in the second quadrant with large voltage amplification. Five circuits have 
been introduced in the literature: 
•	 Elementary circuit
•	 Self-lift circuit
•	 Relift circuit
•	 Triple-lift circuit
•	 Quadruple-lift circuit
The elementary circuit was discussed in Section 5.5.2, and the self-lift circuit was discussed in 
Section 6.2.4. Therefore, further circuits will be discussed in this section.
6.4.1  Relift Circuit
Figure 6.21 shows the N/O relift circuit that is derived from the self-lift circuit. It consists of one 
static switch S; three inductors L, L1, and LO; four capacitors C, C1, C2, and CO; and diodes. It can be 
seen that one capacitor C2, one inductor L1, and two diodes D2 and D11 have been added into the relift 
circuit. Circuit C1–D1–D11–L1–C2–D2 is the lift circuit. Capacitors C1 and C2 perform characteristics 
to lift the capacitor voltage VC to a level 2 times higher than the source voltage 2VI. Inductor L1 per-
forms the function as a ladder joint to link the two capacitors C1 and C2 and lift the capacitor voltage 
VC. Currents iC1(t) and iC2(t) are exponential functions δ1(t) and δ2(t). They have large values at the 
moment of power switching on, but they are small because vC1 = vC2 ≅ VI in steady state.
When switch S is on, the source current iI = iL + iC1 + iC2. Inductor L absorbs energy from the 
source, and current iL linearly increases with slope VI/L. In the meantime the diodes D1 and D2

are conducted so that capacitors C1 and C2 are charged by the currents iC1 and iC2. Inductor LO 
keeps the output current IO continuous and transfers energy from capacitor C to the load R, that is, 
iC–on = iLO. When switch S is off, the source current iI = 0. Current iL flows through the freewheel-
ing diode D, capacitors C1 and C2, and inductor L1 to charge capacitor C and enhance current iLO. 
Inductor L transfers its SE to capacitor C and load R via inductor LO, that is, iL = iC1–off = iC2–off = 
iL1–off = ­iC–off + iLO. Thus, the current iL decreases.
The output current IO = ILO because the capacitor CO does not consume any energy in the steady 
state. The average output current is

Example 6.3
An N/O relift Luo-converter has the following components: VI = 20 V, L = L1 = LO = 1 mH, all 
capacitances are equal to 20 μF, R = 160 Ω, f = 50 kHz, and k = 0.5. Calculate the output voltage 
and the variation ratios ξ, ζ, χ1, ρ, σ1, σ2, and ε in steady state.

From Equation 6.128, we obtain the output voltage as

The variation ratios are ξ = 6.25 × 10–4, ζ = 0.04, χ1 = 0.1, ρ = 0.0016, σ1 = 0.04, σ2 = 0.04, and 
ε = 7.8 × 10–5. Therefore, the variations are small.
In the DCM, the diode current iD becomes zero during switch-off before the next period 
switch-on. The condition for DCM is ζ ≥ 1, that is,

The graph of the boundary curve versus the normalized load zN = R/fL is shown in Figure 6.12. It 
can be seen that the boundary curve has a minimum value of 3.0 at k = 1/3.
In this case, the current iD exists in the period between kT and t1 = [k + (1 – k) mR]T, where mR 
is the filling efficiency, and it is defined as

That is, the output voltage linearly increases as the load resistance R increases. Larger load resis-
tance R may cause higher output voltage in the discontinuous mode.
6.4.2  N/O Triple-Lift Circuit
An N/O triple-lift circuit is shown in Figure 6.22. It consists of one static switch S; four inductors L, 
L1, L2, and LO; five capacitors C, C1, C2, C3, and CO; and diodes. The circuit C1–D1–L1–C2–D2–D11–
L2–C3–D3–D12 is the lift circuit. Capacitors C1, C2, and C3 perform characteristics to lift the capaci-
tor voltage VC to a level, 3 times higher than the source voltage VI. L1 and L2 perform the function as 
ladder joints to link the three capacitors C1, C2, and C3 and lift the capacitor voltage VC up. Currents 
iC1(t), iC2(t), and iC3(t) are exponential functions. They have large values at the moment of power 
switching on, but they are small because vC1 = vC2 = vC3 ≅ VI in steady state.

perform the function of ladder joints to link the four capacitors C1, C2, C3, and C4 and lift the output capac-
itor voltage VC. Currents iC1(t), iC2(t), iC3(t), and iC4(t) are exponential functions. They have large values at 
the moment of power switching on, but they are small because vC1 = vC2 = vC3 = vC4 ≅ VI in steady state.

Voltage Lift Converters
Here i is the component number, and n is the stage number. To write common formulae for the 
boundaries between continuous and discontinuous modes and the output voltage for all circuits, 
the circuits can be numbered. The definition is that subscript n = 0 denotes the elementary circuit, 
1 the self-lift circuit, 2 the relift circuit, 3 the triple-lift circuit, 4 the quadruple-lift circuit, and so on. 
Therefore, the voltage-transfer gain in the continuous mode for all circuits is (Figure 6.24)

6.5  MODIFIED P/O LUO-CONVERTERS
N/O Luo-converters perform the voltage conversion from positive to negative voltages using the 
VL technique with only one switch S. This section introduces the technique to modify P/O Luo-
converters that can employ only one switch for all circuits. Five circuits have been introduced in 
the literature: 
•	 Elementary circuit
•	 Self-lift circuit
•	 Relift circuit
•	 Triple-lift circuit
•	 Quadruple-lift circuit
The elementary circuit is the original P/O Luo-converter. We will introduce the self-lift circuit, 
relift circuit, and multiple-lift circuit in this section.
6.5.1  Self-Lift Circuit
The self-lift circuit is shown in Figure 6.26. It is derived from the elementary circuit of the P/O Luo-
converter. In steady state, the average of inductor voltages in a period is zero. Thus,

The inductor current iL increases in the switch-on period and decreases in the switch-off period. The 
corresponding voltages across L are VI and –VC.

6.5.2  Relift Circuit
The relift circuit and its equivalent circuits are shown in Figure 6.27. It is derived from the self-lift 
circuit. The function of capacitor C2 is to lift the voltage vC to a level higher than the source voltage 
VI; inductor L1 performs the function of the hinge of a foldable ladder (capacitor C2) to lift the volt-
age vC during switch-off.

The inductor current iL increases in the switch-on period and decreases in the switch-off period.

6.5.3  Multiple-Lift Circuit
Multiple-lift circuits are derived from relift circuits by repeating the section of L1–C1–D1 multiple 
times. For example, a triple-lift circuit is shown in Figure 6.28. The function of capacitors C2 and C3 
is to lift the voltage VC across capacitor C to a level 2 times higher than the source voltage 2VI, and 
the inductors L1 and L2 perform the function of the hinges of a foldable ladder (capacitors C2 and C3) 
to lift the voltage VC during switch-off.

6.6  D/O LUO-CONVERTERS
Mirror-symmetrical D/O voltages are specially required in industrial applications and computer 
periphery circuits. The D/O DC–DC Luo-converter can convert positive input source voltage to P/O 
and N/O voltages. It consists of two conversion paths. It performs increasing conversion from positive 
to positive and negative DC–DC voltages with high power density, high efficiency, and cheap topology 
in a simple structure. Like P/O and N/O Luo-converters, there are five circuits in this series: 
•	 Elementary circuit
•	 Self-lift circuit
•	 Relift circuit
•	 Triple-lift circuit
•	 Quadruple-lift circuit
The elementary circuit is the original D/O Luo-converter introduced in Section 5.53. We will intro-
duce the self-lift circuit, relift circuit, triple-lift circuit, and quadruple-lift circuit in this section.

Voltage Lift Converters
6.6.1  Self-Lift Circuit
The self-lift circuit shown in Figure 6.30 is derived from the elementary circuit. The positive con-
version path consists of a pump circuit S–L1–D0–C1, a filter (C2)–L2–CO, and a lift circuit D1–C2. The 
negative conversion path consists of a pump circuit S–L11–D10–(C11), an “Π”-type filter C11–L12–C10, 
and a lift circuit D11–C12.
6.6.1.1  Positive Conversion Path
The equivalent circuit during switch-on is shown in Figure 6.31a, and its equivalent circuit during 
switch-off is shown in Figure 6.31b. The voltage across inductor L1 is equal to VI during switch-on 
and –VC1 during switch-off. We have the relation:

Example 6.4
A D/O self-lift Luo-converter has the following components: VI = 20 V, all inductances are 1 mH, 
all capacitances are equal to 20 µF, R = R1 = 160 Ω, f = 50 kHz, and k = 0.5. Calculate the output 
voltage and the variation ratios, and in steady state.

6.6.1.3  Discontinuous Conduction Mode
The equivalent circuits of the DCM’s operation are shown in Figures 6.31c and 6.32c. As we select 
zN = zN+ = zN–, MS = MS+ = MS–, and ζ = ζ+ = ζ–, the boundary between CCM and DCM is ζ ≥ 1 or

Then we have VO = VO+ = VO– = [1 + k2(1 – k)(zN/2)]VI, that is, the output voltage linearly increases 
as the load resistance R increases. Larger load resistance causes higher output voltage in the DCM, 
as shown in Figure 6.34.
6.6.2  Relift Circuit
The relift circuit shown in Figure 6.35 is derived from the self-lift circuit. The positive conversion 
path consists of a pump circuit S–L1–D0–C1, a filter (C2)–L2–CO, and a lift circuit D1–C2–D3–L3–
D2–C3. The negative conversion path consists of a pump circuit S–L11–D10–(C11), a “Π”-type filter 
C11–L12–C10, and a lift circuit D11–C12–L13–D22–C13–D12.
6.6.2.1  Positive Conversion Path
The equivalent circuit during switch-on is shown in Figure 6.36a, and its equivalent circuit during 
switch-off is shown in Figure 6.36b.
The voltage across inductors L1 and L3 is equal to VI during switch-on and –(VC1 – VI) during 
switch-off. We have the following relations:

6.6.2.3  Discontinuous Conduction Mode
The equivalent circuits of the DCM are shown in Figures 6.36c and 6.37c. To obtain the mirror-
symmetrical D/O voltages, we purposely select zN = zN+ = zN– and ζ = ζ+ = ζ–. The freewheeling 
diode currents iD0 and iD10 become zero during switch-off before the next switch-on period. The

That is, the output voltage linearly increases as the load resistance R increases. Larger load resis-
tance may cause higher output voltage in the discontinuous mode as shown in Figure 6.39.
6.6.3  Triple-Lift Circuit
The triple-lift circuit is shown in Figure 6.40.
The positive conversion path consists of a pump circuit S–L1–D0–C1, a filter (C2)–L2–CO, 
and a lift circuit D1–C2–D2–C3–D3–L3–D4–C4–D5–L4. The negative conversion path con-
sists of a pump circuit S–L11–D10–(C11), a “Π”-type filter C11–L12–C10, and a lift circuit 
D11–C12–D22–C13–L13–D12–D23–L14–C14–D13.
6.6.3.1  Positive Conversion Path
The lift circuit is D1–C2–D2–C3–D3–L3–D4–C4–D5–L4. Capacitors C2, C3, and C4 perform charac-
teristics to lift the capacitor voltage VC1 to a level 3 times higher than the source voltage VI. L3 and 
L4 perform the function of ladder joints to link the three capacitors C3 and C4 and lift the capacitor 
voltage VC1 up. Current iC2(t), iC3(t), and iC4(t) are exponential functions. They have large values at 
the moment of power switching on, but they are small because vC3 = vC4 = VI and vC2 = VO+ in the 
steady state.

The circuit C12–D11–L13–D22–C13–D12–L14–D23–C14–D13 is the lift circuit. Capacitors C12, C13, and 
C14 perform characteristics to lift the capacitor voltage VC11 to a level 3 times higher than the source 
voltage VI. L13 and L14 perform the function of ladder joints to link the three capacitors C12, C13, and 
C14 and lift the capacitor voltage VC11 up. Currents iC12(t), iC13(t), and iC14(t) are exponential func-
tions. They have large values at the moment of power switching on, but they are small because

The freewheeling diode currents iD0 and iD10 become zero during switch-off before the next switch-

This boundary curve is shown in Figure 6.42. It can be seen that the boundary curve has a minimum 
value of MT that is equal to 4.5, corresponding to k = 1/3.
In the discontinuous mode, the currents iD0 and iD10 exist in the period between kT and

Capacitors C2, C3, C4, and C5 perform characteristics to lift the capacitor voltage VC1 to a level 4

iC4(t), and iC5(t) are exponential functions. They have large values at the moment of power switching

iC13(t), iC14(t), and iC15(t) are exponential functions. They have large values at the moment of power 
switching on, but they are small because vC12 = vC13 = vC14 = vC15 ≅ VI in the steady state.

increases, as shown in Figure 6.45.

6.6.5.3  Common Parameters
Usually, we select the loads R = R1, L = L11, so that we obtain zN = zN + = zN–. To write common 
formulae for the boundaries between continuous and discontinuous modes and output voltage for all 
circuits, the circuits can be numbered. The definition is that subscript j = 0 denotes the elementary 
circuit; 1, the self-lift circuit; 2, the relift circuit; 3, the triple-lift circuit; 4, the quadruple-lift circuit, 
and so on.

Voltage Lift Converters
The boundaries between continuous and discontinuous modes of all circuits are shown in 
Figure 6.47. The curves of all M versus zN suggest that the continuous mode area increases from ME 
via MS, MR, and MT to MQ. The boundary of the elementary circuit is a monorising curve, but other 
curves are not monorising. There are minimum values of the boundaries of other circuits, which for 
MS, MR, MT, and MQ correspond at k = 1/3.
6.7  VL CÚK-CONVERTERS
The proposed N/O Cúk-converters were developed from the Cúk-converter, as shown in Figure 5.32. 
They are as follows: 
•	 Elementary self-lift circuit
•	 Developed self-lift circuit
•	 Relift circuit
•	 Multiple-lift circuits (e.g., triple-lift and quadruple-lift circuits)
These converters perform positive-to-negative DC–DC voltage increasing conversion with higher volt-
age transfer gains, power density, small ripples, high efficiency, and cheap topology in a simple structure.
6.7.1  Elementary Self-Lift Cúk Circuit
The elementary self-lift circuit is derived from the Cúk-converter by adding the components 
(D1 – C1). The circuit diagram is shown in Figure 6.48. The lift circuit consists of L1–D1–C1, and it 
is a basic VL cell. When switch S turns on, D1 is on and Do is off. When switch S turns off, D1 is off 
and Do is on. The capacitor C1 performs characteristics to lift the output capacitor voltage VCo to a 
level higher than the capacitor voltage VCs.

During the switch-on period, the voltage across capacitor C1 is equal to the voltage across Cs. As Cs 
and C1 are sufficiently large, we have VC1 = VCs = VO.
The inductor current iL increases during switch-on and decreases during switch-off. The corre-
sponding voltages across L are Vin and –(VCs – Vin). Therefore, kTVin = (1 – k)T(VCs – Vin).

6.7.2  Developed Self-Lift Cúk Circuit
The developed self-lift circuit is derived from the elementary self-lift Cúk circuit by adding the 
components (Do–S1) and redesigning the connection of L1. Static switches S and S1 are switched 
on simultaneously. The circuit diagram is shown in Figure 6.49. The lift circuit consists of C1–L1–
S1–D1. When switches S and S1 turn on, D1 is on and Df and Do are off. When S and S1 turn off, D1 
is off and Df and Do are on. The capacitor C1 performs characteristics to lift the output capacitor 
voltage VCo to a level higher than the capacitor voltage VCs.
During the switch-on period, the voltage across capacitor C1 is equal to the voltage across Cs. 
As Cs and C1 are sufficiently large, we have VC1 = VCs = (1/(1 – k))Vin.
The inductor current iL1 increases during switch-on and decreases during switch-off. The cor-
responding voltages across L are VCs and –(VO – VC1). Therefore,

6.7.3  Relift Cúk Circuit
The relift circuit is derived from the developed self-lift Cúk circuit by adding the components (D2–C2–
L2–D3). Static switches S and S1 are switched on simultaneously. The circuit diagram is shown in 
Figure 6.50. The lift circuit consists of L1–D1–C1–D2–C2–L2–D3–S1, and it can be divided into two basic 
VL cells. When switches S and S1 turn on, D1, D2, and D3 are on, and Do is off. When S and S1 turn 
off, D1, D2, and D3 are off, and Do is on. Capacitors C1 and C2 perform characteristics to lift the output 
capacitor voltage VCo to a level 2 times higher than the capacitor voltage VCs. L2 performs the function 
of a ladder joint to link the two capacitors C1 and C2 and lift VCo. To avoid the abnormal phenomena of 
diodes during switch-off, it is assumed that L1 and L2 are the same to simplify the theoretical analysis.
During the switch-on period, both the voltages across capacitors C1 and C2 are equal to the volt-
age across Cs. As Cs, C1, and C2 are sufficiently large, we have

The voltage across L1 is equal to VCs during switch-on. With the second voltage balance, we have 
VL1–off = (k/1 – k) VCs.
The inductor current iL2 increases during switch-on and decreases during switch-off. The cor-
responding voltages across L2 are VCs and –(VO – VC1 – VC2 – VL1–off). Therefore,

6.7.4  Multiple-Lift Cúk Circuit
It is possible to construct a multiple-lift circuit by adding the components (D2–C2–L2–D3). 
Assuming that there are n VL cells, the generalized representation of multiple-lift circuits is shown 
in Figure 6.51. Only two synchronous switches S and S1 are required for each complex multiple-lift 
circuit, which simplifies the control scheme and decreases the cost significantly. Hence, each circuit 
has two switches, (n + 1) inductors, (n + 1) capacitors, and (2n – 1) diodes. It is noted that all induc-
tors existing in the VL cells are the same here for the reasons explained in the relift circuit. All the 
capacitors are sufficiently large. From the foregoing analysis and calculation, the general formulae 
for all multiple-lift circuits can be obtained according to similar steps.

6.7.5  Simulation and Experimental Verification of an Elementary 
and a Developed Self-Lift Circuit
Referring to Figures 6.48 and 6.49, we set these two circuits to have the same conditions: Vin = 10 V, 
R = 100 Ω, L = 1 mH, L1 = 500 µH, Cs = 110 µF, C1 = 22 µF, CO = 47 µF, k = 0.5, and f = 100 kHz. 
According to Equation 6.207, the theoretical value VO of the elementary self-lift circuit is equal to 
20 V. According to Equation 6.208, the theoretical value VO of the developed self-lift circuit is equal 
to 40 V. The simulation results of PSim are shown in Figure 6.52, where curve 1 is for the vO of the 
elementary self-lift circuit and curve 2 is for the vO of the developed self-lift circuit. The steady-state 
values in the simulation identically match the theoretical analysis.
Similar parameters are chosen to construct the corresponding testing hardware circuits. A single 
n-channel MOSFET is used in the elementary self-lift circuit. Two n-channel MOSFETs are used in 
the developed self-lift circuit. The corresponding experimental curves in the steady state are shown 
in Figure 6.53. The curve shown in Channel 1 with 10 V/Div corresponds to the output voltage of

corresponds to the output voltage of the developed self-lift circuit, which is about 37 V. Considering 
the effects caused by the parasitic parameters, we can see that the measured results are very close 
to the theoretical analysis and simulation results.
6.8  VL SEPICs
The proposed P/O SEPICs are developed from SEPIC as shown in Figure 5.33. They are as follows: 
•	 Self-lift circuit
•	 Relift circuit
•	 Multiple circuits (e.g., triple-lift and quadruple-lift circuits)
These converters perform positive-to-positive DC–DC voltage increasing conversion with higher volt-
age transfer gains, power density, small ripples, high efficiency, and cheap topology in a simple structure.
6.8.1  Self-Lift SEPIC
The self-lift circuit is derived from the SEPIC converter by adding the components D1–C1. The 
circuit diagram is shown in Figure 6.54. The lift circuit consists of L1–D1–C1 and is a basic VL cell. 
When switch S turns on, D1 is on and Do is off. When switch S turns off, D1 is off and Do is on. 
Capacitor C1 performs characteristics to lift the output capacitor voltage VCo to a level higher than 
the capacitor voltage VCs.
In the steady state, the average voltage across inductor L over a period is zero. Thus,

During the switch-on period, the voltage across capacitor C1 is equal to the voltage across Cs. As C 
and C1 are sufficiently large, we have VC1 = VCs = Vin.
The inductor current iL increases during switch on and decreases during switch off. The corre-

6.8.2  Relift SEPIC
The relift circuit is derived from the self-lift circuit by adding the components L2–D2–C2–S1. Static 
switches S and S1 are switched on simultaneously. The circuit diagram and equivalent circuits dur-
ing switch-on and switch-off are shown in Figure 6.55. The lift circuit consists of L1–D1–C1–L2–D2–
C2–S1 and can be divided into two basic VL cells. When switches S and S1 turn on, D1 and D2 are on 
and Do is off. When S and S1 turn off, D1 and D2 are off and Do is on. Capacitors C1 and C2 perform 
characteristics to lift the output capacitor voltage VCo to a level 2 times higher than the capacitor volt-
age VCs. L2 performs the function of a ladder joint to link the two capacitors C1 and C2 and lift VCo. 
To avoid the abnormal phenomena of diodes during switch off, it is assumed that L1 and L2 are the 
same, which simplifies the theoretical analysis.
In steady state, both the average voltages across inductors L and L1 over a period equal zero. 
Thus, VCs = Vin.
During the switch-on period, both the voltages across capacitors C1 and C2 are equal to the volt-
age across Cs. As C, C1, and C2 are sufficiently large, we have

The voltage across L1 is equal to VCs during switch-on. With the second voltage balance, we have

responding voltages across L2 are VCs and –(VCo – VC1 – VC2 – VL1–off). Therefore,

6.8.3  Multiple-Lift SEPICs
It is possible to construct a multiple-lift circuit by adding the components L2–D2–C2–S1. Assuming 
that there are n VL cells, the generalized representation of multiple-lift circuits is shown in 
Figure 6.56.
All future active switches can be replaced by passive diodes. According to this principle, only 
two synchronous switches S and S1 are required for each complex multiple-lift circuit, which simpli-
fies the control scheme and decreases the cost significantly. Hence, each circuit has two switches, 
(n + 1) inductors, (n + 1) capacitors, and (2n – 1) diodes. It is noted that all inductors existing in the 
VL cells are the same here for the reasons explained in the relift circuit. All the capacitors are suf-
ficiently large. From the foregoing analysis and calculation, the general formulae for all multiple-lift 
circuits can be obtained according to similar steps. The generalized voltage-transfer gain is

6.8.4  Simulation and Experimental Results of a Relift SEPIC
The circuit parameters for simulation are Vin = 10 V, R = 100 Ω, L = 1 mH, L1 = L2 = 500 µH, 
Cs = 110 µF, C1 = C2 = 22 µF, C0 = 110 µF, and k = 0.6. The switching frequency f is 100 kHz. 
According to Equation 6.212, we obtain the theoretical value VO, which is equal to 50 V. The simula-
tion results of PSim are shown in Figure 6.57, where curves 1–3 are for vO, iL2, and iL1, respectively. 
The steady-state performance in the simulation identically matches the theoretical analysis.

Similar parameters are chosen to construct a testing hardware circuit. Two n-channel MOSFETs 
2SK2267 are selected. We obtained the output voltage value of VO = 46.2 V (shown in Channel 1 
with 10 V/Div) and the capacitor value of VCs = 9.9 V (shown in Channel 1 with 10 V/Div). The cor-
responding experimental curves in the steady state are shown in Figure 6.58. The practical output 
voltage is smaller than the theoretical values due to the effects caused by parasitic parameters. It is 
seen that the measured results are very close to the theoretical analysis and simulation results.
6.9  OTHER D/O VOLTAGE-LIFT CONVERTERS
For all the above-mentioned converters, each topology is divided into two sections: the source section 
including voltage source, inductor L, and active switch S, and the pump section consisting of the rest of 
the components. Each topology can be considered as a special cascade connection of these two sections.
We compare the SEPIC converter to the Cúk-converter; both converters have the same source 
sections and the same voltage-transfer gains with opposite polarities. Hence, a series of novel D/O

converters based on the SEPIC and Cúk-converters can be constructed by combining the two 
­converters at the input side. They are the elementary circuit, the self-lift circuit, and the corresponding 
enhanced series.
6.9.1  Elementary Circuit
Combining the prototypes of the SEPIC and Cúk-converters, we obtain the elementary circuit of 
novel D/O converters, which is shown in Figure 6.59. The positive conversion path is the same as 
that of the SEPIC converter. The negative conversion path is the same as that of the Cúk-converter.

6.9.3  Enhanced Series D/O Circuits
As the positive and negative conversion paths share a common source section that can be regarded 
as a boost converter circuit, we can construct the corresponding enhanced series using the VL 
technique. A series of novel boost circuits is applied into the source section, which transfers much 
more energy to Cs+ and Cs– in each cycle and increases VCs+ and VCs– stage by stage along geometric 
progression.
As shown in Figure 6.61, the source section is redesigned by adding the components Ls1–Ds1–
Ds2–Cs1, which form a basic VL cell and are expressed by boost. The newly derived topology pro-
vides a single-boost circuit enhancement using supplementary components. When switch S turns 
on, Ds2 is on and Ds1 is off. When switch S turns off, Ds2 is off and Ds1 is on. Capacitor Cs1 performs 
characteristics to lift the source voltage Vin. The energy is transferred to Cs+ and Cs– in each cycle 
from Cs1 and increases VCs+ and VCs–. We obtain

6.9.4  Simulation and Experimental Verification of an Enhanced

According to Equation 6.219, we obtain the theoretical values of D/O voltages VO+ and VO–, which are 
equal to 40 and –40 V, respectively. The simulation results of PSim are shown in Figure 6.63, where 
curve 1 is for the vO+ of the positive conversion path and curve 2 is for the vO– of the negative conver-
sion path. The steady-state values in the simulation identically match the theoretical analysis.

Similar parameters are chosen to construct the testing hardware circuit. Only a single n-channel 
MOSFET is used in the circuit. The corresponding experimental curves in the steady state are 
shown in Figure 6.64. The curve shown in Channel 1 with 20 V/Div corresponds to P/O vO+, which 
is about 37 V. The curve shown in Channel 2 with 20 V/Div corresponds to N/O vO–, which is also 
about 37 V. Considering the effects caused by the parasitic parameters, we can see that the measured 
results are very close to the theoretical analysis and simulation results.
6.10  SC CONVERTERS
A switched capacitor is an improved component used in power electronics. Switched capacitors 
can be used to construct a new type of DC–DC converter called the switched-capacitor DC–DC 
converter. Switched capacitors can be integrated into a power IC chip. By using this manufacturing 
technology, we have the advantages of small size and low power losses. Consequently, switched-
capacitor DC–DC converters have a small size, a high power density, a high power transfer effi-
ciency, and a high voltage transfer gain.
Current is supplied to DC–DC converters by a DC-voltage source. The input source current 
can be continuous or discontinuous. In some converters such as buck converters and buck–boost 
­converters, the input current is discontinuous. This is called working in the DICM. In other

converters such as boost converters, the input current is continuous. This is called working in the 
CICM. The VL technique can be applied to the switched capacitor to construct DC/DC converters. 
The idea is that for converters to operate in the DICM, switched capacitors can be charged with the 
source voltage, and energy can be stored during the input current discontinuous period (when the 
main switch is off). They will join the conversion operation during the time the main switch is on, 
and their SE will be delivered through the DICM converters to the load. These converters are called 
SC DC–DC converters.
It is easy to construct SC DC–DC converters. Depending on how many switched capacitors 
need to be used, they are called one-stage SC converters, two-stage SC converters, three-stage 
SC ­converters, and n-stage SC converters. The corresponding circuits are shown in Figures 6.65 
through 6.67.
The one-stage SC converter circuit is shown in Figure 6.65a. The input source voltage is Vin, and 
the output voltage is VO. To simplify the description, we assume that the load is resistive load R. The 
auxiliary switches S1 and S2 are switched on (the auxiliary switch S3 is off) during the switch-off 
period. The switched capacitor C1 is charged with the source voltage Vin. The auxiliary switches S1 
and S2 are switched off, and the auxiliary switch S3 is on during the switch-on period. The equivalent

circuit is shown in Figure 6.65b. Therefore, the equivalent input voltage supplied to the DICM 
­converter is 2Vin. In other words, the equivalent input voltage has been lifted by using the switched 
capacitor.
Analogously, the circuit diagram of the two-stage SC converter is shown in Figure 6.66a, and the 
corresponding equivalent circuit when the main switch is on is shown in Figure 6.66b. It supplies 
3Vin to the DICM converter. The equivalent input voltage is lifted to a level two times higher than 
the supplied voltage Vin.
The circuit diagram of the three-stage SC converter is shown in Figure 6.67a, and the corre-
sponding equivalent circuit when the main switch is on is shown in Figure 6.67b. It supplies 4Vin to 
the DICM converter. The equivalent input voltage is lifted to a level 3 times higher than the supplied 
voltage Vin.
Several circuits will be introduced in this chapter: 
•	 SC buck converters
•	 SC buck–boost converters
•	 SC P/O Luo-converters
•	 SC N/O Luo-converters
Assume that the stage number is n and the voltage-transfer gain of the DICM converter is M. Then, 
in the ideal condition, we obtain the output voltage as

The ideal condition means that the voltage drop across all switches and diodes is zero and the volt-
age across all the SCs has no drop-down when the main switch is off. This assumption is reasonable 
for the investigation. We will discuss the unideal condition operation in Section 6.10.5.
There is another advantage in the input current being continuous. The input current of the origi-
nal DICM converter is zero when the main switch is off. For example, the input current of the one-
stage SC DC–DC converter flows through the auxiliary switches S1 and S2 to the charge capacitor 
C1 when the main switch is off. For the n-stage SC DC–DC converter, each switched capacitor

6.10.1  One-Stage SC Buck Converter
The one-stage SC buck converter is shown in Figure 6.69. The main switch S and the auxiliary 
switch S3 are on and off simultaneously. The auxiliary switches S1 and S2 are off and on separately.
6.10.1.1  Operation Analysis
We assume that the converter works in the steady state and the switched capacitor C1 is fully charged. 
The main switch S is on during the switch-on period, and the auxiliary switch S3 is on simultane-
ously. The voltage V1 is about 2Vin when the main switch S is on. This is the equivalent input voltage 
of 2Vin for supply to the buck converter. Referring to the buck converter voltage-transfer gain M = k, 
we can easily obtain the output voltage as

(6.223)
By using this technique, we can obtain an output voltage that is higher than the input voltage if the 
conduction duty cycle k is >0.5. The output voltage of the original buck converter is always lower 
than the input voltage.
6.10.1.2  Simulation and Experimental Results
To verify the design and analysis, the simulation result is shown in Figure 6.70. The simulation 
condition is that Vin = 20 V, L = 10 mH, C = C1 = 20 µF, f = 50 kHz, R = 100 Ω, and conduction 
duty cycle k = 0.8. The voltage at the top end of the switched capacitor C1 varies from 20 to 40 V. 
The output voltage VO = 32 V, which is the same as the calculation result.

6.10.2  Two-Stage SC Buck–Boost Converter
The two-stage SC buck–boost converter is shown in Figure 6.72. The main switch S and the auxil-
iary switches S3 and S6 are on and off simultaneously. The auxiliary switches S1, S2, S4, and S5 are 
off and on separately.
6.10.2.1  Operation Analysis
We assume that the converter works in the steady state and the switched capacitors C1 and C2 are 
fully charged. The main switch S is on during the switch-on period and the auxiliary switches S3 
and S6 are on simultaneously. The voltage V1 is about 2Vin and the voltage V2 is about 3Vin when the 
main switch S is on. This is the equivalent input voltage of 3Vin for supply to the buck–boost con-
verter. Referring to the buck–boost converter voltage-transfer gain M = –k/(1 – k), we easily obtain 
the output voltage as

By using this technique, we effortlessly obtain a higher output voltage. For example, if k = 0.5, 
the output voltage of the original buck–boost converter is equal to the input source voltage Vin. The 
value of the output voltage of the two-stage SC buck–boost converter is 6 times the value of 
the source voltage.

k = 0.6. The voltage at the top end of the switched capacitor C1 in Figure 6.72 varies from 20 to 40 V. 
The voltage at the top end of the switched capacitor C2 varies from 20 to 60 V. The output voltage

6.10.5.1  Voltage Drop across Switched Capacitors
Referring to the waveform in Figures 6.72, 6.75, and 6.78, we can clearly see the voltage drop 
across the switched capacitors. For an n-stage SC converter, n switched capacitors need to be used. 
In the ideal condition, the total voltage across all switched capacitors should be Vn = nVin.
If all switched capacitors have the same capacitance C, the equivalent capacitance in the switch-
on period is C/n. We assume that the discharging current during the switch-on period is a constant 
value Id, the conduction duty cycle is k, the switching frequency is f, and the switch-on period is 
kT = k/f. Then, we calculate the voltage drop of the last switched capacitor as

The average current flowing through switched capacitors in a period T is zero in the steady state. 
The average input current from the source is Iin = (n + 1)Id. Current Id is the input current of the 
DICM converter. If there are no energy losses inside the DICM converter, we can obtain it as

From Equation 6.234, we can see that the voltage drop is directly proportional to stages n, duty cycle 
k, and output voltage VO. It is inversely proportional to switching frequency f, capacitance C of the 
used switched capacitors, and load R. To reduce the voltage drop for our design, one of the following 
ways can be used: 
•	 Increase the switching frequency f
•	 Increase the capacitance C
•	 Increase the load R
•	 Decrease the duty cycle k

6.10.5.2  Necessity of the Voltage Drop across Switched Capacitors 
and Energy Transfer
Voltage drops across switched capacitors are necessary for energy transfer from the source to the 
DICM converter. Switched capacitors absorb energy from the supply source during the switch-off 
period and release the SE to the DICM converter during the switch-on period. In the steady state, 
the energy transferred by the switched capacitors in a period T is

If we would like to obtain the power transferred to the DICM converter as high, increasing the 
switching frequency f and capacitance C is necessary. From Equation 6.238, helpful methods are 
the following: 
•	 Increase the duty cycle k
•	 Increase the stage number n
•	 Increase the transfer gain M
6.10.5.3  Inrush Input Current
Inrush input current is large for all SC DC–DC converters, as the charging current to the switched 
capacitors is high during the main switch-off period. As an example, the simulation result of the 
inrush input current of a three-stage SC P/O Luo-converter is shown in Figure 6.81.
The load current is very small, namely I = 120/400 = 0.3 A, but the peak value of the input 
inrush current is about 27.3 A. Another phenomenon is that the input inrush current usually does 
not fully occupy the switch-off period. We will discuss how to overcome this phenomenon in 
Section 6.10.5.5.

6.10.5.4  Power Switch-On Process
Surge input current is large for all SC DC–DC converters during the power switch-on process as all 
switched capacitors are not precharged. For example, we show the simulation result of the power-on 
surge input current of a three-stage SC P/O Luo-converter in Figure 6.82.
The peak value of the power-on surge input current is very high, namely about 262 A.
6.10.5.5  Suppression of the Inrush and Surge Input Currents
From Figures 6.81 and 6.82, we can see that the peak inrush input current can be 90 times the 
normal load current, and the peak power-on surge input current can be about 880 times the normal 
load current. This is a serious problem for industrial applications of the SC DC/DC converters. To 
suppress the large inrush input current and the peak power-on surge input current, we set a small 
resistor (the so-called suppression resistor RS) in series with each switched capacitor. The circuit of 
such a three-stage SC P/O Luo-converter is shown in Figure 6.83. The resistance RS is designed to 
have the time constant of the RC circuit compete with the switch-off period.

input current is about 138 A, which is largely reduced.

7 Superlift Converters 
and Ultralift Converter
The voltage lift (VL) technique has been successfully employed in the design of DC/DC converters 
and effectively enhances the voltage-transfer gains of the VL converters. However, the output volt-
age increases in arithmetic progression stage by stage. The super lift (SL) technique is more pow-
erful than the VL technique; its voltage-transfer gain can be a very large value. The SL technique 
implements the output voltage increasing in geometric progression stage by stage. It effectively 
enhances the voltage-transfer gain in power series.
7.1  INTRODUCTION
The SL technique is the most important contribution to DC/DC conversion technology. By apply-
ing this technique, a large number of SL converters can be designed. The following series of VL 
converters are introduced in the current chapter: 
•	 P/O SL Luo-converters
•	 N/O SL Luo-converters
•	 P/O cascaded boost converters
•	 N/O cascaded boost converters
•	 UL Luo-converters
Each series of converters has several subseries. For example, the P/O SL Luo-converters have five 
subseries: 
•	 The main series: Each circuit of the main series has only one switch S, n inductors for 
the nth stage circuit, 2n capacitors, and (3n – 1) diodes.
•	 Additional series: Each circuit of the additional series has one switch S, n inductors for 
the nth stage circuit, 2(n + 1) capacitors, and (3n + 1) diodes.
•	 Enhanced series: Each circuit of the enhanced series has one switch S, n inductors for the 
nth stage circuit, 4n capacitors, and (5n – 1) diodes.
•	 Re-enhanced series: Each circuit of the re-enhanced series has one switch S, n inductors 
for the nth stage circuit, 6n capacitors, and (7n – 1) diodes.
•	 Multiple (j)-enhanced series: Each circuit of the multiple (j times)-enhanced series has 
one switch S, n inductors for the nth stage circuit, 2(1 + j)n capacitors, and [(3 + 2j)n – 1] 
diodes.
To concentrate the voltage enhancement, assume that the converters are working in the steady state 
in the continuous conduction mode (CCM). The conduction duty ratio is k, the switching frequency 
is f, the switching period is T = 1/f, and the load is resistive load R. The input voltage and current 
are Vin and Iin, and the output voltage and current are VO and IO. Assuming that there are no power 
losses during the conversion process, Vin × Iin = VO × IO. The voltage-transfer gain G is given by

7.2  P/O SL LUO-CONVERTERS
We introduce here only three circuits from each subseries. Once the readers grasp the clue, they can 
design the other circuits easily.
7.2.1  Main Series
The first three stages of P/O SL Luo-converters, namely the main series, are shown in Figures 7.1 
through 7.3. To make it easy to explain, they are called the elementary circuit, the relift circuit, and 
the triple-lift circuit, respectively, and are numbered n = 1, 2, and 3, respectively.   
7.2.1.1  Elementary Circuit
The elementary circuit and its equivalent circuits during switch-on and switch-off periods are 
shown in Figure 7.1.
The voltage across capacitor C1 is charged with Vin. The current iL1 flowing through inductor L1 
increases with Vin during the switch-on period kT and decreases with –(VO – 2Vin) during the switch-
off period (1 – k)T. Therefore, the ripple of the inductor current iL1 is

7.2.1.2  Relift Circuit
The relift circuit is derived from the elementary circuit by adding the parts (L2–D3–D4–D5–C3–C4). 
Its circuit diagram and equivalent circuits during switch-on and switch-off periods are shown in 
Figure 7.2. The voltage across capacitor C1 is charged with Vin. As described in the previous section, 
the voltage V1 across capacitor C2 is V1 = [(2 – k)/(1 – k)]Vin.
The voltage across capacitor C3 is charged with V1. The current flowing through inductor L2 
increases with V1 during the switch-on period kT and decreases with –(VO – 2V1) during the switch-
off period (1 – k)T. Therefore, the ripple of the inductor current iL2 is

C3–C4). Its circuit diagram and equivalent circuits during switch-on and switch-off periods are 
shown in Figure 7.3. The voltage across capacitor C1 is charged with Vin. As described in the previ-
ous section, the voltage V1 across capacitor C2 is V1 = [(2 – k)/(1 – k)]Vin, and the voltage V2 across 
capacitor C4 is V2 = [(2 – k)/(1 – k)]2Vin.
The voltage across capacitor C5 is charged with V2. The current flowing through inductor L3 
increases with V2 during the switch-on period kT and decreases with –(VO – 2V2) during the switch-
off period (1 – k)T. Therefore, the ripple of the inductor current iL2 is

Example 7.2
A triple-lift circuit of the P/O SL Luo-converter in Figure 7.3a has Vin = 20 V, all inductors have 
10 mH, all capacitors have 20 µF, R = 1000 Ω, f = 50 kHz, and conduction duty cycle k = 0.6. 
Calculate the variation ratio of current iL1, and the output voltage and its variation ratio.

7.2.2  Additional Series
By using two diodes and two capacitors (D11–D12–C11–C12), a circuit called double/enhance circuit 
(DEC) can be constructed, which is shown in Figure 7.4. If the input voltage is Vin, the output volt-
age VO can be 2Vin or another value higher than Vin. The DEC is very useful to enhance the DC/DC 
converter’s voltage-transfer gain.
All circuits of P/O SL Luo-converters—additional series—are derived from the correspond-
ing circuits of the main series by adding a DEC. The first three stages of this series are shown in 
Figures 7.5 through 7.7. For ease of understanding, they are called the elementary additional circuit, 
the relift additional circuit, and the triple-lift additional circuit, respectively, and are numbered as 
n = 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
7.2.2.1  Elementary Additional Circuit
The elementary additional circuit is derived from the elementary circuit by adding a DEC. Its circuit 
and switch-on and switch-off equivalent circuits are shown in Figure 7.5.
The voltage across capacitor C1 is charged with Vin, and the voltage across capacitors C2 and C11 
is charged with V1. The current iL1 flowing through inductor L1 increases with Vin during the switch-
on period kT and decreases with –(VO – 2Vin) during the switch-off period (1 – k)T. Therefore,

All circuits of P/O SL Luo-converters—enhanced series—are derived from the corresponding cir-
cuits of the main series by adding the DEC in circuits of each stage. The first three stages of this 
series are shown in Figures 7.5, 7.8, and 7.9. For ease of understanding, they are called the elemen-
tary-enhanced circuit, the relift enhanced circuit, and the triple-lift enhanced circuit, respectively, 
and numbered n = 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

7.2.3.2  Relift Enhanced Circuit
The relift enhanced circuit is derived from the relift circuit of the main series by adding the DEC 
in each stage circuit. Its circuit diagram and switch-on and switch-off equivalent circuits are shown 
in Figure 7.8. As described in the previous section, the voltage across capacitor C12 is charged with 
VC12 = [(3 – k)/(1 – k)]Vin.
The voltage across capacitor C3 is charged with VC12, and the voltage across capacitors C4 and 
C21 is charged with VC4,

standing, they are called the elementary re-enhanced circuit, the relift re-enhanced circuit, and the 
triple-lift re-enhanced circuit, respectively, and numbered n = 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

7.2.5  Multiple-Enhanced Series
All circuits of P/O SL Luo-converters—multiple-enhanced series—are derived from the corre-
sponding circuits of the main series by adding the DEC multiple (j) times in circuits of each stage. 
The first three stages of this series are shown in Figures 7.13 through 7.15. For ease of understanding, 
they are called the elementary multiple-enhanced circuit, the relift multiple-enhanced circuit, and 
the triple-lift multiple-enhanced circuit, respectively, and numbered n = 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
7.2.5.1  Elementary Multiple-Enhanced Circuit

To show the advantages of the SL Luo-converters, their voltage-transfer gains can be compared 
with that of other converters: 
Buck converter: G = VO/Vin = k.
Forward converter: G = VO/Vin = kN, where N is the transformer turn’s ratio.
Cúk-converter: G = VO/Vin = k/(1 – k).
Fly-back converter: G = VO/Vin = [k/(1 – k)]N, where N is the transformer turn’s ratio.
Boost converter: G = VO/Vin = 1/(1 – k).

7.3  N/O SL LUO-CONVERTERS
The N/O SL Luo-converters were developed at the same time as the P/O SL Luo-converters. They 
too perform the SL technique. Only three circuits from each subseries will be introduced in this 
section.
7.3.1  Main Series
The first three stages of N/O SL Luo-converters—main series—are shown in Figures 7.17 through 7.19. 
For ease of understanding, they are called the elementary circuit, the relift circuit, and the triple-lift cir-
cuit, respectively, and are numbered n = 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
7.3.1.1  N/O Elementary Circuit
The N/O elementary circuit and its equivalent circuits during switch-on and switch-off periods are 
shown in Figure 7.17.
The voltage across capacitor C1 is charged with Vin. The current flowing through inductor L1 
increases along the slope Vin/L1 during the switch-on period kT and decreases along the slope 
–(VO – Vin)/L1 during the switch-off period (1 – k)T. Therefore, the variation of current iL1 is

The voltage across capacitor C1 is charged to Vin. As described in the previous section, the voltage 
V1 across capacitor C2 is V1 = [1/(1 – k)]Vin.
The voltage across capacitor C3 is charged with (V1 + Vin). The current flowing through inductor L2 
increases along the slope (V1 + Vin)/L2 during the switch-on period kT and decreases along the slope 
–(VO – 2V1 – Vin)/L2 during the switch-off period (1 – k)T. Therefore, the variation of current iL2 is

7.3.1.3  N/O Triple-Lift Circuit
The N/O triple-lift circuit is derived from the N/O relift circuit by twice repeating the parts (L2–D3–
D4–D5–C3–C4). Its circuit diagram and equivalent circuits during switch-on and switch-off periods 
are shown in Figure 7.19.
The voltage across capacitor C1 is charged with Vin. As described in the previous section, the 
voltage V1 across capacitor C2 is V1 = {[(2 – k)/(1 – k)] – 1} Vin = [1/(1 – k)]Vin, and the voltage V2 
across capacitor C4 is

The voltage across capacitor C5 is charged with (V2 + Vin). The current flowing through inductor L3 
increases along the slope (V2 + Vin)/L3 during the switch-on period kT and decreases along the slope 
–(VO – 2V2 – Vin)/L3 during the switch-off period (1 – k)T. Therefore, the variation of current iL3 is

7.3.2  N/O Additional Series
All circuits of the N/O SL Luo-converters—additional series—are derived from the correspond-
ing circuits of the main series by adding a DEC. The first three stages of this series are shown in 
Figures 7.20 through 7.22. For ease of understanding, they are called the elementary additional cir-
cuit, the relift additional circuit, and the triple-lift additional circuit, respectively, and are numbered 
n = 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
7.3.2.1  N/O Elementary Additional Circuit
This circuit is derived from the N/O elementary circuit by adding a DEC. Its circuit and switch-on 
and switch-off equivalent circuits are shown in Figure 7.20.
The voltage across capacitor C1 is charged with Vin. The voltage across capacitor C2 is charged 
with V1 and C11 is charged with (V1 + Vin). The current IL1 flowing through inductor L1 increases with 
the slope Vin/L1 during the switch-on period kT and decreases with the slope –(6.V1 – Vin)/L1 during 
the switch-off period (1 – k)T.

7.3.2.2  N/O Relift Additional Circuit
The N/O relift additional circuit is derived from the N/O relift circuit by adding a DEC. Its circuit 
diagram and switch-on and switch-off equivalent circuits are shown in Figure 7.21.
The voltage across capacitor C1 is charged with Vin. As described in the previous section, the 
voltage across C2 is V1 = [1/(1 – k)]Vin.
The voltage across capacitor C3 is charged with (V1 + Vin), the voltage across capacitor C4 is 
charged with V2, and the voltage across capacitor C11 is charged with (V2 + Vin). The current flowing 
through inductor L2 increases with (V1 + Vin) during the switch-on period kT and decreases with 
–(V2 – 2V1 – Vin) during the switch-off period (1 – k)T. Therefore,

7.3.2.3  Triple-Lift Additional Circuit
This circuit is derived from the N/O triple-lift circuit by adding a DEC. Its circuit diagram and 
equivalent circuits during switch-on and switch-off periods are shown in Figure 7.22.
The voltage across capacitor C1 is charged with Vin. As described in the previous section, the 
voltage across C2 is V1 = [1/(1 – k)]Vin, and the voltage across C4 is

The voltage across capacitor C5 is charged with (V2  +  Vin), the voltage across capacitor C6 is 
charged with V3, and the voltage across capacitor C11 is charged with (V3 + Vin). The current flowing 
through inductor L3 increases with (V2 + Vin) during the switch-on period kT and decreases with 
–(V3 – 2V2 – Vin) during the switch-off period (1 – k)T. Therefore,

7.3.3  Enhanced Series
All circuits of the N/O SL Luo-converters—enhanced series—are derived from the corresponding 
circuits of the main series by adding the DEC in each stage circuit of all series converters.
The first three stages of this series are shown in Figures 7.20, 7.23, and 7.24. For ease of under-
standing, they are called the elementary enhanced circuit, the relift enhanced circuit, and the triple-
lift enhanced circuit, respectively, and are numbered n = 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
7.3.3.1  N/O Elementary Enhanced Circuit

Power Electronics
The first three stages of this series are shown in Figures 7.25 through 7.27. For ease of 
understanding, they are called the elementary re-enhanced circuit, the relift re-enhanced cir-
cuit, and the triple-lift re-enhanced circuit, respectively, and are numbered n = 1, 2, and 3, 
respectively.
7.3.4.1  N/O Elementary Re-Enhanced Circuit
This circuit is derived from the N/O elementary circuit by adding the DEC twice in each stage cir-
cuit. Its circuit and switch-on and switch-off equivalent circuits are shown in Figure 7.25.
The voltage across capacitor C1 is charged with Vin. The voltage across capacitor C12 is charged 
with VC12.
The voltage across capacitor C13 is charged with VC13.

7.4  P/O CASCADED BOOST-CONVERTERS
SL Luo-converters largely increase the voltage-transfer gain in geometric progression. However, 
their circuits are a bit complex. We introduce a novel approach—P/O cascaded boost converters—
that implement the output voltage increasing in geometric progression as well, but with a simpler 
structure. They also effectively enhance the voltage-transfer gain in power law. There are several 
subseries. As described in previous sections, only three circuits of each subseries are introduced.
7.4.1  Main Series
The first three stages of P/O cascaded boost converters—main series—are shown in Figures 5.5, 
7.32, and 7.33. For ease of understanding, they are called the elementary boost converter, two-stage 
circuit, and three-stage circuit, respectively, and are numbered n = 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
7.4.1.1  Elementary Boost Circuit
The elementary boost converter is the fundamental boost converter; it is also introduced in Section 
5.2.2. Its circuit diagram and its equivalent circuits during switch-on and switch-off periods are 
shown in Figure 5.5. The output voltage is

The two-stage boost circuit is derived from the elementary boost converter by adding the parts 
(L2–D2–D3–C2). Its circuit diagram and equivalent circuits during switch-on and switch-off periods 
are shown in Figure 7.32.
The voltage across capacitor C1 is charged with V1. As described in the previous section, the volt-
age V1 across capacitor C1 is V1 = [1/(1 – k)]Vin.
The voltage across capacitor C2 is charged with VO. The current flowing through inductor L2 
increases with V1 during the switch-on period kT and decreases with –(VO – V1) during the switch-
off period (1 – k)T. Therefore, the ripple of the inductor current iL2 is

7.4.1.3  Three-Stage Boost Circuit
The three-stage boost circuit is derived from the two-stage boost circuit by twice repeating the parts 
(L2–D2–D3–C2). Its circuit diagram and equivalent circuits during switch-on and switch-off periods 
are shown in Figure 7.33.
The voltage across capacitor C1 is charged with V1. As described in the previous section, the 
voltage V1 across capacitor C1 is V1  =  [1/(1  –  k)]Vin, and the voltage V2 across capacitor C2 is 
V2 = [1/(1 – k)]2Vin.
The voltage across capacitor C3 is charged with VO. The current flowing through inductor L3 
increases with V2 during the switch-on period kT and decreases with –(VO – V2) during the switch-
off period (1 – k)T. Therefore, the ripple of the inductor current iL3 is

tors have 20 µF, R = 400 Ω, f = 50 kHz, and conduction duty cycle k = 0.6. Calculate the variation 
ratio of current IL1, and the output voltage and its variation ratio.

standing, they are called the elementary additional circuit, the two-stage additional circuit, and the 
three-stage additional circuit, respectively, and are numbered n = 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

7.4.2.2  Two-Stage Boost Additional Circuit
The two-stage additional boost circuit is derived from the two-stage boost circuit by adding a DEC. 
Its circuit diagram and switch-on and switch-off equivalent circuits are shown in Figure 7.35.
The voltage across capacitor C1 is charged with V1. As described in the previous section, the 
voltage V1 across capacitor C1 is V1 = [1/(1 – k)]Vin.
The voltage across capacitors C2 and C11 is charged with V2, and the voltage across capacitor C12 
is charged with VO. The current flowing through inductor L2 increases with V1 during the switch-on 
period kT and decreases with –(V2 – V1) during the switch-off period (1 – k)T. Therefore, the ripple

7.4.2.3  Three-Stage Boost Additional Circuit
This circuit is derived from the three-stage boost circuit by adding a DEC. Its circuit diagram and 
equivalent circuits during switch-on and switch-off periods are shown in Figure 7.36.
The voltage across capacitor C1 is charged with V1. As described in the previous section, the 
voltage V1 across capacitor C1 is V1  =  [1/(1  –  k)]Vin, and the voltage V2 across capacitor C2 is 
V2 = [1/(1 – k)]2Vin.
The voltage across capacitors C3 and C11 is charged with V3. The voltage across capacitor C12 
is charged with VO. The current flowing through inductor L3 increases with voltage V2 during the 
switch-on period kT and decreases with –(V3 – V2) during the switch-off period (1 – k)T. Therefore,

shown in Figure 7.34, which is the same as the elementary boost additional circuit.
7.4.3.2  Two-Stage Double Boost Circuit
The two-stage double boost circuit is derived from the two-stage boost circuit by adding the DEC 
in circuits of each stage. Its circuit diagram and switch-on and switch-off equivalent circuits are 
shown in Figure 7.37.
The voltage across capacitors C1 and C11 is charged with V1. As described in the previous section, 
the voltage V1 across capacitors C1 and C11 is V1 = [1/(1 – k)]Vin. The voltage across capacitor C12 is 
charged with 2V1.
The current flowing through inductor L2 increases with 2V1 during the switch-on period kT and 
decreases with –(V2 – 2V1) during the switch-off period (1 – k)T. Therefore, the ripple of the induc-
tor current iL2 is

7.4.3.3  Three-Stage Double Boost Circuit
This circuit is derived from the three-stage boost circuit by adding the DEC in each stage circuit. 
Its circuit diagram and equivalent circuits during switch-on and switch-off periods are shown in 
Figure 7.38.
The voltage across capacitors C1 and C11 is charged with V1. As described in the previous section, 
the voltage V1 across capacitors C1 and C11 is V1 = [1/(1 – k)]Vin, and the voltage V2 across capacitors 
C2 and C12 is V2 = 2[1/(1 – k)]2Vin.
The voltage across capacitor C22 is 2V2 = [2/(1 – k)]2Vin. The voltage across capacitors C3 and C31 
is charged with V3. The voltage across capacitor C12 is charged with VO. The current flowing through 
inductor L3 increases with V2 during the switch-on period kT and decreases with –(V3 – 2V2) during 
the switch-off period (–k)T. Therefore,

7.4.4  Triple Series
All circuits of the P/O cascaded boost converters—triple series—are derived from the correspond-
ing circuits of the double series by adding the DEC twice in circuits of each stage. The first three 
stages of this series are shown in Figures 7.39 through 7.41. To make it easy to explain, they are 
called the elementary triple boost circuit, the two-stage triple boost circuit, and the three-stage triple 
boost circuit, respectively, and are numbered n = 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
7.4.4.1  Elementary Triple Boost Circuit
From the construction principle, the elementary triple boost circuit is derived from the elementary 
double boost circuit by adding another DEC. Its circuit and switch-on and switch-off equivalent 
circuits are shown in Figure 7.39.
The output voltage of the first-stage boost circuit is V1, V1 = Vin/(1 – k).
The voltage across capacitors C1 and C11 is charged with V1, and the voltage across capacitors C12 
and C13 is charged with VC13 = 2V1. The current iL1 flowing through inductor L1 increases with Vin

7.4.4.2  Two-Stage Triple Boost Circuit
The two-stage triple boost circuit is derived from the two-stage double boost circuit by adding 
another DEC in circuits of each stage. Its circuit diagram and switch-on and switch-off equivalent 
circuits are shown in Figure 7.40.
As described in the previous section, the voltage V1 across capacitors C1 and C11 is V1 = [1/(1 – k)]Vin. 
The voltage across capacitor C14 is charged with 3V1.
The voltage across capacitors C2 and C21 is charged with V2, and that across capacitors C22 and 
C23 is charged with VC23 = 2V2. The current flowing through inductor L2 increases with 3V1 dur-
ing the switch-on period kT, and decreases with –(V2 – 3V1) during the switch-off period (1 – k)T.

7.4.5  Multiple Series
All circuits of P/O cascaded boost converters—multiple series—are derived from the corre-
sponding circuits of the main series by adding the DEC multiple (j) times in circuits of each 
stage. The first three stages of this series are shown in Figures 7.42 through 7.44. For ease of 
understanding, they are called the elementary multiple boost circuit, the two-stage multiple 
boost circuit, and the three-stage multiple boost circuit, respectively, and are numbered n = 1, 
2, and 3, respectively.
7.4.5.1  Elementary Multiple Boost Circuit
From the construction principle, the elementary multiple boost circuit is derived from the elemen-
tary boost converter by adding the DEC multiple (j) times in the circuit. Its circuit and switch-on 
and switch-off equivalent circuits are shown in Figure 7.42.
The voltage across capacitors C1 and C11 is charged with V1, and the voltage across capaci-
tors C12 and C13 is charged with VC13 = 2V1. The voltage across capacitors C1(2j–2) and C1(2j–1) is 
charged with VC1(2j–1) = jV1. The current iL1 flowing through inductor L1 increases with Vin during 
the switch-on period kT and decreases with –(V1 – Vin) during the switch-off period (1 – k)T.

The voltage across capacitors C1 and C11 is charged with V1 = [1/(1 – k)] Vin. The voltage across 
capacitor C1(2j) is charged with (1 + j)V1.
The current flowing through inductor L2 increases with (1 + j)V1 during the switch-on period kT 
and decreases with –[V2–(1 + j)V1] during the switch-off period (1 – k)T. Therefore, the ripple of the

parts (L2–D2–D3–C2). Its circuit diagram and equivalent circuits during switch-on and switch-off 
periods are shown in Figure 7.47.

7.5.2  N/O Additional Series
All circuits of N/O cascaded boost converters—additional series—are derived from the correspond-
ing circuits of the main series by adding a DEC.
The first three stages of this series are shown in Figures 7.49 through 7.51. For ease of understand-
ing, they are called the elementary additional boost circuit, the two-stage additional boost circuit, and 
the three-stage additional boost circuit, respectively, and are numbered n = 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
7.5.2.1  N/O Elementary Additional Boost Circuit
The N/O elementary additional boost circuit is derived from the N/O elementary boost converter by 
adding a DEC. Its circuit and switch-on and switch-off equivalent circuits are shown in Figure 7.49.
The voltage across capacitors C1 and C11 is charged with VC1, and the voltage across capacitor C12 
is charged with VC12 = 2VC1. The current iL1 flowing through inductor L1 increases with Vin during the 
switch-on period kT and decreases with –(VC1 – Vin) during the switch-off period (1 – k)T. Therefore,

7.5.3  Double Series
All circuits of the N/O cascaded boost converters—double series—are derived from the corre-
sponding circuits of the main series by adding the DEC in each stage circuit. The first three stages 
of this series are shown in Figures 7.49, 7.52, and 7.53. For ease of understanding, they are called 
the elementary double circuit, the two-stage double circuit, and three-stage double boost circuit, 
respectively, and are numbered n = 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
7.5.3.1  N/O Elementary Double Boost Circuit
The N/O elementary double boost circuit is derived from the elementary boost converter by adding 
a DEC. Its circuit and switch-on and switch-off equivalent circuits are shown in Figure 7.49, which 
is the same as the elementary boost additional circuit.
7.5.3.2  N/O Two-Stage Double Boost Circuit
The N/O two-stage double boost circuit is derived from the two-stage boost circuit by adding the 
DEC in each stage circuit. Its circuit diagram and switch-on and switch-off equivalent circuits are 
shown in Figure 7.52.
The voltage across capacitors C1 and C11 is charged with V1. As described in the previous section, 
the voltage VC1 across capacitors C1 and C11 is VC1 = [1/(1 – k)]Vin. The voltage across capacitor C12 
is charged with 2VC1.
The current flowing through inductor L2 increases with 2VC1 during the switch-on period kT and 
decreases with –(VC2 – 2VC1) during the switch-off period (1 – k)T. Therefore, the ripple of the induc-
tor current iL2 is

7.5.3.3  N/O Three-Stage Double Boost Circuit
The N/O three-stage double boost circuit is derived from the three-stage boost circuit by adding the 
DEC in each stage circuit. Its circuit diagram and equivalent circuits during switch-on and switch-
off periods are shown in Figure 7.53.
The voltage across capacitors C1 and C11 is charged with VC1. As described in the previous sec-
tion, the voltage VC1 across capacitors C1 and C11 is VC1 = [1/(1 – k)]Vin, and the voltage VC2 across 
capacitors C2 and C12 is VC2 = 2[1/(1 – k)]2Vin.
The voltage across capacitor C22 is 2VC2 = [2/(1 – k)]2Vin. The voltage across capacitors C3 and C31 
is charged with V3. The voltage across capacitor C12 is charged with VO. The current flowing through 
inductor L3 increases with V2 during the switch-on period kT and decreases with –(VC3 – 2VC2) dur-
ing the switch-off period (1 – k)T. Therefore,

7.5.5  Multiple Series
All circuits of the N/O cascaded boost converters—multiple series—are derived from the cor-
responding circuits of the main series by adding the DEC multiple (j) times in each stage circuit. 
The first three stages of this series are shown in Figures 7.57 through 7.59. To make it easy to 
explain, they are called the elementary multiple boost circuit, the two-stage multiple boost cir-
cuit, and the three-stage multiple boost circuit, respectively, and are numbered as n = 1, 2, and 3, 
respectively.
7.5.5.1  N/O Elementary Multiple Boost Circuit
The N/O elementary multiple boost circuit is derived from the elementary boost converter by adding 
the DEC multiple (j) times. Its circuit and switch-on and switch-off equivalent circuits are shown

The SL technique has been paid much more attention as it yields higher voltage transfer gain. 
Good examples are the SL Luo-converters. By using this technique, one can obtain the converter’s

We introduce the ultra lift (UL) Luo-converter as a novel approach of the new technology called the 
UL technique, which produces even higher voltage transfer gains. Simulation results verified our 
analysis and calculation and illustrated the advanced characteristics of this converter.
7.6.1  Operation of the UL Luo-Converter
The circuit diagram is shown in Figure 7.61a, which consists of one switch S, two inductors L1 and 
L2, two capacitors C1 and C2, three diodes, and the load R. Its switch-on equivalent circuit is shown in 
Figure 7.61b. Its switch-off equivalent circuit for the CCM is shown in Figure 7.61c, and the switch-
off equivalent circuit for the discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) is shown in Figure 7.61d.
It is a converter with a very simple structure when compared with other converters. As usual, 
the input voltage and current of the UL Luo-converter are V1 and I1, the output voltage and current 

401
Superlift Converters and Ultralift Converter
are V2 and I2, the conduction duty cycle is k, and the switching frequency is f. Consequently, 
the repeating period T = 1/f, the switch-on period is kT, and the switch-off period is (1 – k)T. 
To concentrate the operation process, we assume that all components except load R are ideal 
ones. Therefore, no power losses are considered during power transformation, that is, Pin = PO or 
V1 × I1 = V2 × I2.
7.6.1.1  Continuous Conduction Mode
Referring to Figure 7.61b and c, we have obtained the result that the current iL1 increases along the 
slope +V1/L1 during the switch-on period and decreases along the slope –V3/L1 during the switch-
off period. In the steady state, the current increment is equal to the current decrement in the whole 
period T. The following relation is obtained:

It is much higher than the voltage-transfer gains of the VL Luo-converter and SL Luo-converter 
in Equations 7.418 and 7.420. Actually, the gain in Equation 7.423 is the consequence of those in 
Equations 7.418 and 7.420. Another advantage is the starting output voltage of 0 V. The curve of the 
voltage-transfer gain M versus the conduction duty cycle k is shown in Figure 7.62.

An UL Luo-converter, shown in Figure 7.61a, has V1 = 20 V, all inductors have 10 mH, all 
capacitors have 20 µF, R = 500 Ω, f = 50 kHz, and conduction duty cycle k = 0.6. Calculate 
the variation ratios of current iL1, current iL2 and voltage vC1, and the output voltage and its

7.6.1.2  Discontinuous Conduction Mode
Referring to Figure 7.61b–d, we have obtained the result that the current iL1 increases along the 
slope +V1/L1 during the switch-on period and decreases along the slope –V3/L1 during the switch-
off period. The inductor current iL1 decreases to zero before t = T, that is, the current becomes zero 
before the switch turns on once again.
The current waveform is shown in Figure 7.63. The DCM operation condition is defined as

It is higher than the voltage-transfer gain during CCM operation as m < 1. It can be seen that the 
voltage-transfer gain GDCM is directly proportional to the normalized impedance ZN, and this is 
shown in Figure 7.64.

Instantaneous values of the voltage and current of each component are very important to describe

7.6.3  Comparison of the Gain to Other Converters’ Gains
The UL Luo-converter has been successfully developed using a novel approach of the new technol-
ogy called UL. Table 7.8 lists the voltage-transfer gains of various converters at k = 0.2, 0.33, 0.5, 
0.67, 0.8, and 0.9. The outstanding characteristics of the UL Luo-converter are very well presented. 
From the comparison, we can clearly see that the UL Luo-converter has very high voltage transfer 
gain: G(k)|k=0.5 = 3, G(k)|k=0.67 = 8, G(k)|k=0.8 = 24, and G(k)|k=0.9 = 99.
7.6.4  Simulation Results
To verify the advantages of the UL Luo-converter, a PSpice simulation method was applied. We 
choose the following parameters: V1 = 10 V, L1 = L2 = 1 mH, C1 = C2 = 1 µF, R = 3 kΩ, f = 50 kHz, 
and conduction duty cycle k = 0.6 and 0.66. The output voltage is V2 = 52.5 and 78 V, correspond-
ingly. The first waveform is the inductor current iL1, which flows through the inductor L1. The second 
and third waveforms are the voltage V3 and the output voltage V2. These simulation results are iden-
tical to the calculation results. The results are shown in Figures 7.65 and 7.66, respectively.

7.6.5  Experimental Results
To verify the advantages and design of the UL Luo-converter and compare them with the simula-
tion results, we constructed a test rig with the following components: V1 = 10 V, L1 = L2 = 1 mH, 
C1 = C2 = 1 μF, R = 3 kΩ, f = 50 kHz, and conduction duty cycle k = 0.6 and 0.66. The output volt-
age is V2 = 52 and 78 V, correspondingly. The first waveform is the inductor current iL1, which flows 
through the inductor L1. The second waveform is the output voltage V2. The experimental results are 
shown in Figures 7.67 and 7.68, respectively. The test results are identical to those of the simulation 
results shown in Figures 7.65 and 7.66, and confirm the calculation results and our design.

8 Pulse-Width-Modulated 
DC/AC Inverters
DC/AC inverters are used to quickly develop knowledge of the power-switching circuits applied 
in industrial applications in comparison with other power-switching circuits. In the twentieth cen-
tury, a number of topologies of DC/AC inverters were created. In general, DC/AC inverters are 
mainly used in an AC motor–adjustable speed drive (ASD). Power DC/AC inverters have been 
widely used in other industrial applications since the late 1980s. Semiconductor manufacture  
development resulted in power devices such as gate turned off transistor (GTO), Triac, bipolar 
transistor (BT), insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT), metal oxide semiconductor field effect 
transistor (MOSFET), and so on in higher switching frequencies (say from tens of kHz up to a 
few MHz). On account of devices such as thyristors (SCRs) with low switching frequency and 
high power rate, the abovementioned devices have low power rate and high switching frequency.
Square-waveform DC/AC inverters were used before the 1980s. Among this equipment, thyris-
tor, GTO, and Triac can be used in low-frequency switching operations. Moreover, high-frequency 
devices, such as power BT and IGBT, were produced. Corresponding equipment implementing the 
pulse-width modulation (PWM) technique has a large range of output voltage and frequency, and 
low total harmonic distortion (THD).
Today, two DC/AC inversion techniques are popular: the PWM technique and the multi-line 
modulation (MLM) technique. Most DC/AC inverters continue to be different prototypes of PWM 
DC/AC inverters. We introduce PWM inverters in this chapter, and MLM inverters in the next.
8.1  INTRODUCTION
DC/AC inverters are used for converting a DC power source into an AC power application. 
They are generally used in the following applications: 
	
1.	Variable voltage/variable frequency AC supplies in an ASD, such as induction motor 
drives, synchronous machine drives, and so on
	
2.	Constantly regulated voltage AC power supplies, such as uninterruptible power supplies
	
3.	Static var (reactive power) compensations
	
4.	Passive/active series/parallel filters
	
5.	Flexible AC transmission systems
	
6.	Voltage compensations
Adjustable-speed induction motor drive systems are widely used in industrial applications. These 
systems require DC/AC power supply with variable frequency, usually from 0 to 400 Hz in frac-
tional horsepower (hp) to hundreds of HP. Today, there are a large number of DC/AC inverters in the 
world market. The typical block circuit of an ASD is shown in Figure 8.1. From this block diagram, 
we see that the power DC/AC inverter produces variable frequency and voltage to implement ASD. 
The PWM technique is different from the pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) and pulse phase 
modulation (PPM) techniques. By implementing this technique, all pulses have adjustable pulse 
width with constant amplitude and phase. The corresponding circuit is called the pulse-width modu-
lator. Typical input and output waveforms of a pulse-width modulator are shown in Figure 8.2. The 
output pulse train has pulses with the same amplitude and different widths, which correspond to the 
input signal at the sampling instants.

8.2  PARAMETERS USED IN PWM OPERATIONS
Some parameters are specially used in PWM operations.
8.2.1  Modulation Ratios
The modulation ratio is usually yielded by a uniformed-amplitude triangle (carrier) signal with 
amplitude Vtri–m. The maximum amplitude of the input signal is assumed to be Vin–m.
We define the amplitude modulation ratio ma for a single-phase inverter as

Pulse-Width-Modulated DC/AC Inverters
A one-leg switch-mode inverter is shown in Figure 8.3. The DC-link voltage is Vd. Two large 
capacitors are used to establish the neutral point N. The AC output voltage from point a to N is 
VAO, and its fundamental component is (VAO)1. We mark (VAO)1 to show the maximum amplitude of 
(VAO)1. The waveforms of the input (control) signal and the triangle signal, and the spectrum of the 
PWM pulse train are shown in Figure 8.4.
If the maximum amplitude (VAO)1 of the input signal is smaller than and/or equal to half the 
DC-link voltage Vd/2, the modulation ratio ma is smaller than and/or equal to unity. In this case, the 
fundamental component (VAO)1 of the output AC voltage is proportional to the input voltage. The volt-
age control by varying ma for a single-phase PWM is split into three areas, as shown in Figure 8.5.
8.2.1.1  Linear Range (ma ≤ 1.0)
The condition (VAO)1  =  ma(Vd/2) determines the linear region. It is a sinusoidal PWM in 
which the amplitude of the fundamental frequency voltage varies linearly with the amplitude

modulation ratio ma. The PWM pushes the harmonics into a high-frequency range around the 
switching frequency and its multiples. However, the maximum available amplitude of the fun-
damental frequency component may not be as high as desired.
8.2.1.2  Overmodulation (1.0 < ma ≤ 1.27)
The condition (Vd/2) < (VAO)1 ≤ (4/π)(Vd/2) determines the overmodulation region. When the ampli-
tude of the fundamental frequency component in the output voltage increases beyond 1.0, it reaches 
overmodulation. In the overmodulation range, the amplitude of the fundamental frequency voltage 
no longer varies linearly with ma.
Overmodulation causes the output voltage to contain many more harmonics in the sidebands as 
compared with the linear range. The harmonics with dominant amplitudes in the linear range may 
not be dominant during overmodulation.

8.2.1.3  Square Wave (Sufficiently Large ma > 1.27)
The condition (VAO)1  >  (4/π)(Vd/2) determines the square-wave region. The inverter voltage 
waveform degenerates from a pulse-width-modulated waveform into a square wave. Each switch 
of the inverter leg in Figure 8.3 is on for one half-cycle (180°) of the desired output frequency.
8.2.1.4  Small mf (mf ≤ 21)
Usually the triangle waveform frequency is much larger than the input signal frequency to obtain 
small THD. For the situation with a small mf ≤ 21, two points have to be mentioned: 
•	 Synchronous PWM: For a small value of mf, the triangle waveform signal and the input 
signal should be synchronized to each other (synchronous PWM). This synchronous PWM 
requires that mf be an integer. The reason for using synchronous PWM is that asynchronous 
PWM (where mf is not an integer) results in subharmonics (of the fundamental frequency) 
that are very undesirable in most applications. This implies that the triangle waveform 
frequency varies with the desired inverter frequency (e.g., if the inverter output frequency 
and hence the input signal frequency is 65.42 Hz and mf = 15, the triangle wave frequency 
should be exactly 15 × 65.42 = 981.3 Hz).
•	 mf ≤ 21 should be an odd integer: As discussed previously, mf should be an odd integer 
except in single-phase inverters with PWM unipolar voltage switching, which will be dis-
cussed in Section 8.7.1.
8.2.1.5  Large mf (mf > 21)
The amplitudes of subharmonics due to asynchronous PWM are small at large values of mf. Therefore, 
at large values of mf, asynchronous PWM can be used in which the frequency of the triangle wave-
form is kept constant, whereas the input signal frequency varies, resulting in noninteger values of 
mf (so long as they are large). However, if the inverter is supplying a load such as an AC motor, the 
subharmonics at zero or close to zero frequency, even though small in amplitude, will result in large 
currents, which will be highly undesirable. Therefore, asynchronous PWM should be avoided.
It is extremely important to determine the harmonic components of the output voltage. Referring 
to Figure 8.4c, we have the fast Fourier transform (FFT) spectrum and the harmonics. Choosing 
the frequency modulation ratio mf as an odd integer and the amplitude modulation ratio ma < 1, we 
obtain the generalized harmonics of the output voltage shown in Table 8.1. 
The root mean square (rms) voltages of the output voltage harmonics are calculated by

where (VO)h is the hth harmonic rms voltage of the output voltage, Vd is the DC-link voltage, and 
(VAO)1/(Vd/2) or (VAO)h/(Vd/2) is tabulated as a function of ma.
If the input (control) signal is a sinusoidal wave, we usually call this inversion sine pulse-width 
modulation (SPWM). The typical waveforms of an SPWM are also shown in Figure 8.4a and b.
Example 8.1
A single-phase half-bridge DC/AC inverter is shown in Figure 8.3 to implement SPWM with 
Vd = 200V, ma = 0.8, and mf = 27. The fundamental frequency is 50 Hz. Determine the rms value 
of the fundamental frequency and some of the harmonics in the output voltage using Table 8.1.

(VO)1 = 141.42 × 0.8 = 113.14V at 50 Hz,
(VO)23 = 141.42 × 0.818 = 115.68V at 1150 Hz,

8.3  TYPICAL PWM INVERTERS
DC/AC inverters have three typical supply methods: 
•	 Voltage source inverter (VSI)
•	 Current source inverter (CSI)
•	 Impedance source inverter (Z-source inverter or ZSI)
Generally speaking, the circuits of various PWM inverters can be the same. The difference 
between them is the type of power supply sources or network, which are voltage source, current 
source, or impedance source.
8.3.1  Voltage Source Inverter
A VSI is supplied by a voltage source. The source is a DC voltage power supply. In an ASD, the DC 
source is usually an AC/DC rectifier. A large capacitor is used to keep the DC-link voltage stable. 
Usually, a VSI has buck operation function. Its output voltage peak value is lower than the DC-link 
voltage.
It is necessary to avoid a short circuit across the DC voltage source during operation. If a VSI takes 
bipolar operation, that is, the upper switch and the lower switch in a legwork to provide a PWM output 
waveform, the control circuit and interface have to be designed to leave small gaps between switch-
ing signals to the upper switch and the lower switch in the same leg. For example, the output voltage 
frequency is in the range of 0–400 Hz, and the PWM carrying frequency is in the range of 2–20 kHz; 
the gaps are usually set at 20–100 ns. This requirement is not very convenient for the control circuit 
and interface design. Therefore, the unipolar operation is implemented in most industrial applications.
8.3.2  Current Source Inverter
A CSI is supplied by a DC current source. In an ASD, the DC current source is usually an AC/DC 
rectifier with a large inductor to keep the current supply stable. Usually, a CSI has a boost operation 
function. Its output voltage peak value can be higher than the DC-link voltage.
As the source is a DC current source, it is necessary to avoid the open circuit across the 
inverter during operation. The control circuit and interface have to be designed to have small 
overlaps between switching signals to the upper and lower switches at least in one leg. For 
example, the output voltage frequency is in the range of 0–400 Hz, and the PWM carrying fre-
quency is in the range of 2–20 kHz; the overlaps are usually set at 20–100 ns. This requirement 
is easy for the control circuit and interface design.
8.3.3  Impedance Source Inverter
A ZSI is supplied by a voltage source or current source via an “X”-shaped impedance network 
formed by two capacitors and two inductors, which is called a Z-network. In an ASD, the DC 
impedance source is usually an AC/DC rectifier. A Z-network is located between the rectifier and the 
inverter. As there are two inductors and two capacitors to be set in front of the chopping legs, there is 

420
Power Electronics
no restriction to avoid the opened or short-circuited legs. A ZSI has the buck–boost operation func-
tion. Its output voltage peak value can be higher or lower than the DC-link voltage.
8.3.4  Circuits of DC/AC Inverters
The commonly used DC/AC inverters are introduced in the following: 
	
1.	Single-phase half-bridge VSI
	
2.	Single-phase full-bridge VSI
	
3.	Three-phase full-bridge VSI
	
4.	Three-phase full-bridge CSI
	
5.	Multistage PWM inverters
	
6.	Soft-switching inverters
	
7.	Impedance-source inverters (ZSI)
8.4  SINGLE-PHASE VOLTAGE SOURCE INVERTER
Single-phase VSIs can be implemented using the half-bridge circuit and the full-bridge circuit.
8.4.1  Single-Phase Half-Bridge Voltage Source Inverter
A single-phase half-bridge VSI is shown in Figure 8.6. The carrier-based PWM technique is applied 
in this inverter. Two large capacitors are required to provide a neutral point N; therefore, each 
­capacitor keeps half of the input DC voltage. As the output voltage refers to the neutral point N, the 
maximum output voltage is smaller than half of the DC-link voltage if it is operating in linear modu-
lation. The modulation operations are shown in Figure 8.5. Two switches S+ and S– in one chopping 
leg are switched by the PWM signal. Two switches S+ and S– operate in an exclusive state with a 
short dead time to avoid a short circuit.
In general, linear modulation operation is considered, so that ma is usually smaller than unity, for 
example, ma = 0.8. Generally, to obtain low THD, mf is usually taken as a large number. For descrip-
tion convenience, we choose mf = 9. To understand each inverter, we show some typical waveforms 
in Figure 8.7.
How to determine whether the pulse width is the clue to the PWM. If the control signal vC is a 
sine-wave function as shown in Figure 8.7a, the modulation is called an SPWM. Figure 8.7b offers 
the switching signal. When it is positive to switch on the upper switch S+, and switch off the lower 
switch S–, vice versa it is to switch off the upper switch S+, and the lower switch S– on. Assume that 
the amplitude of the triangle wave is unity, and the amplitude of the sine wave is 0.8. Referring to 
Figure 8.7a, the sine-wave function is

Note:	 The first pulse width to switch-on and switch-off the switch 
S+ is 1.2861 ms (or 23.15°).
Other pulse widths can be determined from other equations using the iterative method. For a 
PWM operation with large values of mf, readers can refer to Figure 8.8.
Figure 8.7 shows the ideal waveforms associated with the half-bridge VSI. We can find 
the phase delay between the output current and voltage. For a large mf, we see the cross 
points demonstrated in Figure 8.8 with smaller phase delay between the output current and 
voltage.

8.4.2  Single-Phase Full-Bridge Voltage Source Inverter
A single-phase full-bridge VSI is shown in Figure 8.9. The carrier-based PWM technique is applied 
in this inverter. Two large capacitors may be used to provide a neutral point N, but not necessarily. 
As the output voltage is not referring to the neutral point N, the maximum output voltage is possibly 
greater than half the DC-link voltage. If it is operating in linear modulation, the output voltage is 
smaller than the DC-link voltage. The modulation operation is different from that of the single-
phase half-bridge VSI described in the previous subsection. This is shown in Figure 8.13. Four 
switches S1+/S1– and S2+/S2– in two legs are applied and switched by the PWM signal.
Figure 8.10 shows the ideal waveforms associated with the full-bridge VSI. Two sine-waves 
are used in Figure 8.10a, corresponding to the operation of two legs. We can find the phase delay 
between the output current and voltage.
The method to determine the pulse widths is the same as that introduced in the previous section.

Figure 8.12 shows the ideal waveforms associated with the full-bridge VSI. We can find out the 
phase delay between output current and voltage.
As the three-phase waveform in Figure 8.12a does not refer to the neutral point N, the opera-
tion conditions are different from the single-phase half-bridge VSI. The maximum output line-
to-line voltage is possibly greater than half the DC-link voltage. If it is operating in linear 
modulation, the output voltage is smaller than the DC-link voltage. The modulation indication 
of a three-phase VSI is different from that of a single-phase half-bridge VSI in Section 8.4.1, as 
shown in Figure 8.13.

A three-phase full-bridge CSI is shown in Figure 8.14.
The carrier-based PWM technique is applied in this three-phase full-bridge CSI. The main 
objective of these static power converters is to produce AC output current waveforms from a DC

8.7  MULTISTAGE PWM INVERTER
Multistage PWM inverters can be constructed by two methods: multicell and multilevel. Unipolar 
modulation PWM inverters can be considered as multistage inverters.
8.7.1  Unipolar PWM Voltage Source Inverter
In Section 8.4, we introduced the single-phase source inverter operating in the bipolar modulation. 
Referring to the circuit in Figure 8.6, the upper switch S+ and the lower switch S– work together. The 
carrier and modulating signals are shown in Figure 8.7a, and the switching signals for upper switch 
S+ and lower switch S– are shown in Figure 8.7b and c. The output voltage of the inverter is the pulse 
train with both polarities, as shown in Figure 8.7d.
There are some drawbacks to using bipolar modulation: (1) If the inverter is VSI, a dead time has 
to be set to avoid short circuit; (2) the zero output voltage corresponds to the equal pulse width of 
positive and negative pulses; (3) power losses are high as two devices work, and hence efficiency is 
lower; and (4) two devices should be controlled simultaneously.

Pulse-Width-Modulated DC/AC Inverters
In most industrial applications, unipolar modulation is widely used. The regulation and corre-
sponding waveforms are shown in Figure 8.16 with ma = 0.8 and mf = 9. For unipolar regulation,

This regulation method is like a two-stage PWM inverter. If the output voltage is positive, only 
the upper device works and the lower device idles. Therefore, the output voltage only remains as 
the positive polarity pulse train. On the other hand, if the output voltage is negative, only the lower

device works and the upper device idles. Therefore, the output voltage only remains as the negative 
polarity pulse train. The advantages of implementing unipolar regulation are as follows: 
•	 No need to set a dead time.
•	 The pulses are narrow, for example, the zero output voltage requires zero pulse width.
•	 Power losses are low and hence the efficiency is high.
•	 Only one device should be controlled in a half-cycle.
8.7.2  Multicell PWM Voltage Source Inverter
Multistage PWM inverters can consist of many cells. Each cell can be a single-phase or three-phase 
input and a single-phase output VSI, which is shown in Figure 8.17. If the three-phase AC supply is a 
secondary winding of a main transformer, it is floating and isolated from other cells and a common 
ground point. Therefore, all cells can be linked in series or in parallel.
A three-stage PWM inverter is shown in Figure 8.18. Each phase consists of three cells with a 
difference phase-angle shift of 20° to each other.

this multilevel PWM inverter. Figure 8.21 shows the ideal waveforms associated with the multilevel

8.8  IMPEDANCE-SOURCE INVERTERS
ZSI is a new approach of DC/AC conversion technology. It was published by Peng in 2003. The ZSI 
circuit diagram shown in Figure 8.22 consists of an “X”-shaped impedance network formed by two 
capacitors and two inductors, and it provides unique buck–boost characteristics. Moreover, unlike 
VSI, the need for dead time would not arise with this topology. Due to these attractive features, 
it has found its use in numerous industrial applications, including variable speed drives and DG. 
However, it has not been widely researched as a DG topology. Moreover, all these industrial applica-
tions require proper closed-loop controlling to adjust the operating conditions subjected to changes 
in both input and output conditions. On the other hand, the presence of the “X”-shaped impedance 
network and the need for short-circuiting of the inverter arm to boost the voltage would complicate 
the controlling of ZSI. 
8.8.1  Comparison between Voltage Source Inverter and Current Source Inverter
ZSI is a new inverter that is different from traditional VSIs and CSIs. To express the advantages of 
ZSI, it is necessary to compare it with VSI and CSI.
A three-phase VSI is shown in Figure 8.11. A DC voltage source supported by a relatively large 
capacitor feeds the main converter circuit, a three-phase bridge. The V-source inverter has the 
following conceptual and theoretical barriers and limitations.  
	
1.	The AC output voltage is limited in the following, and cannot exceed, the DC link. 
Therefore, the VSI is a buck (step-down) inverter for DC/AC power conversion. For appli-
cations where an overdrive is desirable and the available DC voltage is limited, an addi-
tional DC/DC boost converter is needed to obtain a desired AC output. The additional 
power converter stage increases system cost and lowers efficiency.
	
2.	The upper and lower devices of each phase leg cannot be gated simultaneously either 
by purpose or by electro-magnetic interference (EMI) noise. Otherwise, a shoot-through 
would occur and destroy the devices. The shoot-through problem by EMI noise’s misgat-
ing-on is a major killer to the converter’s reliability. Dead time to block both the upper and 
lower devices has to be provided in the VSI, which causes waveform distortion, and so on.
	
3.	An output LC filter is needed for providing a sinusoidal voltage, contrasted with the CSI, 
which causes additional power loss and control complexity.
A three-phase CSI is shown in Figure 8.14. A DC voltage source feeds the main inverter circuit, a 
three-phase bridge. The DC current source can be a relatively large DC inductor fed by a voltage

source such as a battery, fuel-cell stack, diode rectifier, or thyristor converter. The CSI has the fol-
lowing conceptual and theoretical barriers and limitations. 
	
1.	The AC output voltage has to be greater than the original DC voltage that feeds the 
DC inductor, or the DC voltage produced is always smaller than the AC input voltage. 
Therefore, the CSI is a boost inverter for DC/AC power conversion. For applications 
where a wide voltage range is desirable, an additional DC/DC buck (or boost) converter 
is needed. The additional power conversion stage increases system cost and lowers 
efficiency.
	
2.	At least one of the upper devices and one of the lower devices have to be gated on and 
maintained at any time. Otherwise, an open circuit of the DC inductor would occur and 
destroy the devices. The open-circuit problem caused by the misgating-off of the EMI 
noise is a major concern of the converter’s reliability. Overlap time for safe current com-
mutation is needed in the I-source converter, which also causes waveform distortion, and 
so on.
	
3.	The main switches of the I-source converter have to block the reverse voltage that requires 
a series diode to be used in combination with high-speed and high-performance transis-
tors such as IGBTs. This prevents the direct use of low-cost and high-performance IGBT 
modules and intelligent power modules.
In addition, both the VSI and the CSI have the following common problems: 
	
1.	They are either a boost or a buck converter and cannot be a buck–boost converter. That is, 
their obtainable output voltage range is limited to being either greater or smaller than the 
input voltage.
	
2.	Their main circuits cannot be interchangeable. That is, the VSI main circuit cannot be used 
for the CSI, and vice versa.
	
3.	They are vulnerable to EMI noise in terms of reliability.
To overcome these problems of the traditional VSI and CSI, ZSI was designed, as shown in 
Figure 8.22. It employs a unique impedance network to couple the converter main circuit to the 
power source. ZSI overcomes the above-mentioned conceptual and theoretical barriers and limita-
tions of the traditional VSI and CSI and provides a novel power-conversion concept.
In Figure 8.22, a two-port network that consists of split inductors L1 and L2 and capacitors C1 
and C2 connected in X shape is employed to provide an impedance source (Z-source) coupling the 
converter (or inverter) to the DC source. Switches used in ZSI can be a combination of switching 
devices and diodes such as those shown in Figures 8.11 and 8.14. If the two inductors have zero 
inductance, the ZSI becomes a VSI. On the other hand, if the two capacitors have zero capacitance, 
the ZSI becomes a CSI. The advantages of the ZSI are listed in the following: 
	
1.	The AC output voltage is not fixed lower or higher than the DC-link (or DC source) voltage. 
Therefore, the ZSI is a buck–boost inverter for DC/AC power conversion. For applications 
where overdrive is desirable and the available DC voltage is not limited, there is no need 
for an additional DC/DC boost converter to obtain a desired AC output. Therefore, the 
system cost is low and efficiency is high.
	
2.	The Z-circuit consists of two inductors and two capacitors and can restrict the overvoltage 
and overcurrent. Therefore, the legs in the main bridge can operate in short circuit and 
open circuit in a short time. There are restrictions for the main bridge such as dead time for 
VSI and overlap-time for CSI.
	
3.	ZSI has a function to suppress EMI noise. The shoot-through problem by EMI noise’s 
misgating-on will not damage the devices and the converter’s reliability.

8.8.2  Equivalent Circuit and Operation
A three-phase ZSI used for fuel-cell application is shown in Figure 8.23. It has nine permissible 
switching states (vectors): six active vectors, as a traditional VSI has, and three zero vectors when 
the load terminals are shorted through both the upper and lower devices of any one phase leg (i.e., 
both devices are gated on), any two phase legs, or all three-phase legs. This shoot-through zero state 
(or vector) is forbidden in the traditional VSI, because it would cause a shoot-through. We call this 
third zero state (vector) the shoot-through zero state (or vector), which can be generated in seven 
different ways: shoot-through via any one-phase leg, combinations of any two phase legs, and all 
three-phase legs. The Z-source network makes the shoot-through zero state possible. This shoot-
through zero state provides the unique buck–boost feature to the inverter.
Figure 8.24 shows the equivalent circuit of the ZSI shown in Figure 8.23 when viewed from the 
DC link. The inverter bridge is equivalent to a short circuit when the inverter bridge is in the shoot-
through zero state, as shown in Figure 8.25, whereas the inverter bridge becomes an equivalent 
current source as shown in Figure 8.26 when the inverter bridge is in one of the six active states.

Note that the inverter bridge can also be represented by a current source with zero value (i.e., an 
open circuit) when it is in one of the two traditional zero states. Therefore, Figure 8.26 shows the 
equivalent circuit of the ZSI viewed from the DC link when the inverter bridge is in one of the eight 
nonshoot-through switching states.
All the traditional PWM schemes can be used to control the ZSI, and their theoretical input–output 
relationships still hold. Figure 8.27 shows the traditional PWM switching sequence based on the tri-
angular carrier method. In every switching cycle, the two nonshoot-through zero states are used along 
with two adjacent active states to synthesize the desired voltage. When the DC voltage is high enough 
to generate the desired AC voltage, the traditional PWM of Figure 8.27 is used. Although the DC volt-
age is not enough to directly generate a desired output voltage, a modified PWM with shoot-through 
zero states will be used, as shown in Figure 8.28, to boost voltage. It should be noted that each phase 
leg still switches on and off once per switching cycle. Without changing the total zero-state time inter-
val, the shoot-through zero states are evenly allocated into each phase. That is, the active states are 
unchanged. However, the equivalent DC-link voltage to the inverter is boosted because of the shoot-
through states. The detailed relationship will be analyzed in the next section. It is noted here that the 
equivalent switching frequency viewed from the Z-source network is six times the switching frequency 
of the main inverter, which greatly reduces the required inductance of the Z-source network.

B is the boost factor resulting from the shoot-through zero state. Usually, T1 is greater than T0, that

The buck–boost factor MB is determined by the modulation index M and the boost factor B. The 
boost factor B as expressed in Equation 8.22 can be controlled by the duty cycle (i.e., interval ratio) 
of the shoot-through zero state over the nonshoot-through states of the inverter PWM.
Note that the shoot-through zero state does not affect the PWM control of the inverter, because it 
produces, similarly, zero voltage to the load terminal. The available shoot-through period is limited 
by the zero-state period that is determined by the modulation index.
8.9  EXTENDED BOOST IMPEDANCE SOURCE INVERTERS
In recent years, many researchers have focused, in many directions, on developing ZSIs to achieve 
different objectives. Some have worked on developing different kinds of topological variations, 
whereas others have worked on developing ZSIs into different applications in which control-
ler design, modeling and analyzing its operating modes, and developing modulation methods are 

439
Pulse-Width-Modulated DC/AC Inverters
addressed. Theoretically, ZSI can produce infinite gain like many other DC–DC boosting topolo-
gies; however, in practice this cannot be achieved because of the effects of parasitic components 
in which the gain tends to drop drastically. Conversely, high boost could increase power losses and 
instability. On the other hand, the shoot-through inverter can change its variables to respond the 
increasing gain, which is interdependent with the other variable modulation index that controls the 
output of the ZSI and also imposes limitation on variability and thereby the boosting of output volt-
age. That is, an increase in the boosting factor would compromise the modulation index and result 
in a lower modulation index. Moreover, the voltage stress on the switches would be high due to the 
pulsating nature of the output voltage.
Unlike in the case of DC–DC converters, thus far, researchers of ZSIs have not focused on 
improving the gain of the converter. This results in a significant research gap in the field of ZSI 
development. Particularly, some applications such as solar and fuel cells, in which generated power 
is integrated into the grid, may require high voltage gain to match the voltage difference and also 
to compensate the voltage variations. The effect is significant when such sources are connected to 
415 V three-phase systems. In the case of fuel and solar cells, although it is possible to increase the 
number of cells to increase the voltage, there are other influencing factors that need to be taken into 
account. Sometimes, the available number of cells is limited, or environmental factors could come 
into play due to the shading of some cells from light, which could result in poor overall energy 
catchment. Then with fuel cells, some manufacturers produce fuel cells with a lower voltage to 
achieve a faster response. Such factors could demand power converters with a larger boosting ratio. 
This cannot be realized with a single ZSI. Hence, the current chapter focuses on developing a new 
family of ZSIs that would realize extended boosting capability.
8.9.1  Introduction to Impedance Source Inverter and Basic Topologies
The basic topology of ZSI was originally proposed in reference. This is a single-stage buck–boost 
topology due to the presence of the X-shaped impedance network, as shown in Figure 8.29a, which 
allows the safe shoot-through of inverter arms and avoids the need for dead time (which was needed 
in the traditional VSI). However, unlike the VSI, the original ZSI does not share the ground point 
of the DC source with the converter, and also the current drawn from the source will be discon-
tinuous. These are disadvantages in some applications, and a decoupling capacitor bank at the front 
end may be required to avoid current discontinuity. Subsequently, the ZSI was modified as shown 
in Figure 8.29b and c, where now an impedance network is placed at the bottom or top arm of the 
inverter. The advantage of this topology is that in one topology, the ground point can be shared, and 
in both cases, the voltage stress on the component is much lower compared with that of the traditional 
ZSI. However, the current discontinuity still prevails; an alternative continuous current quasi-ZSI 
(qZSI) is proposed, but this continuous current circuit is not considered in developing new converters. 
In terms of topology, the qZSI has no disadvantage over the traditional topology. In this chapter, a 
discontinuous current qZSI inverter is used to extend the boosting capability. In summary, the pro-
posed qZSIs operate similarly to the original ZSI, and the same modulation schemes can be applied.
8.9.2  Extended Boost Quasi–Impedance Source Inverter Topologies
In the current chapter, four new converter topologies have been proposed. These topologies can be 
mainly categorized into diode- or capacitor-assisted boost topologies and can be further divided 
into continuous current and discontinuous current topologies. Their operation is extensively 
described in subsequent sections. All these topologies can be modulated using the modulation 
methods proposed for the original ZSI. The other advantage of the proposed new topologies is 
their expandability. This was not possible with the original ZSI, that is, if one needs additional 
boosting, another stage can be cascaded at the front end. The new topology would operate with 
the same number of active switches. The only addition would be one inductor, one capacitor,

and two diodes for the diode-assisted case, and one inductor, two capacitors, and one diode for 
the capacitor-assisted case for each new stage added. By defining the shoot-through duty ratio 
(Ds) for each new added stage, the boosting factor can be increased by a factor of 1/(1−Ds) in the 
case of diode-assisted topology. Then the capacitor-assisted topology would have a boosting factor 
of 1/(1−3Ds) compared with 1/(1−2Ds) in the traditional topology. However, similar to the other 
boosting topologies, it is not advisable to operate with very high or very low shoot-through values. 
Moreover, a careful consideration is required when selecting the boosting factor modulation index 
for suitable topology to achieve high efficiency. These aspects need further research and will be 
addressed in a future paper.
8.9.2.1  Diode-Assisted Extended Boost Quasi–Impedance Source 
Inverter Topologies
In this category, two new families of topologies are proposed, namely the continuous current-type 
topology and the discontinuous current-type topology. Figure 8.30 shows the continuous current-
type topology that can be extended to have very high boost by cascading more stages as shown 
in Figure 8.31. This new topology comprises an additional inductor, a capacitor, and two diodes.

The operating principle of this additional impedance network is similar to that found in the cas-
caded boost and Luo-converters. The added impedance network provides the boosting function 
without disturbing the operation inverter.
Considering the continuous current topology and its steady-state operation, we know that this 
converter has three operating states similar to those of traditional ZSI topology. It can be simplified 
into shoot-through and nonshoot-through states. Then the inverter’s action is replaced by a current 
source and a single switch. First, consider the nonshoot-through state, which is represented by an 
open switch. Moreover, diodes D1 and D2 are in the conducting state, and D3 is in the blocking state; 
therefore, the inductors discharge, and the capacitors get charged. Figure 8.32b shows the equivalent 
circuit diagram for the nonshoot-through state.

Pulse-Width-Modulated DC/AC Inverters
By applying Kirchhoff’s voltage law (KVL), the following steady-state relationships can 
be observed: VDC + VL3 = VC3, VL1 = VC1, VL2 = VC2, and Vs = VC3 + VC2 + VL1. Figure 8.32c 
shows the equivalent circuit diagram for the shoot-through state in which it is represented by 
the closed switch, and D3 is in the conducting state, and D1 and D2 diodes are in the blocking 
state in which all the inductors get charged. Energy is transferred from the source to the induc-
tor or from the capacitor to the inductor while the capacitors are getting discharged. Similar 
relationships can be derived as VDC + VL3 = 0, VC3 + VL2 + VC1 = 0, VC3 + VC2 + VL1 = 0, Vs = 0, 
and VC3 + VC2 = VL1. Considering that the average voltage across the inductors is zero and by 
defining the shoot-through duty ratio as Ds and the nonshoot-through duty ratio as DA, in which 
DA + Ds = 1, the following relations can be derived:

Now the boosting factor has increased by a factor of 1/(1−Ds) compared with that of the original 
ZSI. Similarly, steady-state equations can be derived for the diode-assisted extended boost discon-
tinuous current qZSI. Then it is possible to prove that this converter also has the same boosting 
factor as that of continuous current topology. Moreover, the voltage stresses on the capacitors are 
similar, except for the voltage across C3; this can be written as VC3 = Ds/(1−Ds) × VDC. By studying 
these two topologies, it can be noted that with the discontinuous current topology, capacitors are 
subjected to a small voltage stress, and if there is no boosting then the voltage across them is zero. 
Moreover, it is possible to derive the boost factor for the topologies shown in Figures 8.30b and 
8.31b as B = 1/[(1−2Ds)(1−Ds)2].
8.9.2.2  Capacitor-Assisted Extended Boost Quasi–Impedance Source 
Inverter Topologies
Similar to the previous family of extended boost qZSIs, this section proposes another family of 
converters. The difference is that now a much higher boost is achieved with only a simple structural 
change to the previous topology. Now D3 is replaced by a capacitor, as shown in Figure 8.32. In this 
context also, two topological variations are derived as continuous current or discontinuous current 
forms, as shown in Figure 8.33.
In the previous scenario, the steady-state relations are derived using continuous current topol-
ogy; therefore, in this context, the discontinuous current topology is considered. In this case also, 
the converter’s three operating states are simplified into shoot-through and nonshoot-through 
states.
The simplified circuit diagram is shown in Figure 8.34a. First, consider the nonshoot-through state 
shown in Figure 8.34b, which is represented by an open switch. As diodes D1 and D2 are conducting 
the inductors discharge, and the capacitors get charged. Then by applying KVL, the following steady-
state relationships can be observed. VDC + VC3 + VC2 + VC1 = Vs and VDC + VC3 + VC4 + VC1 = Vs,

D2 are in the blocking state, in which all the inductors get charged and energy is transferred from

Similar equations can be derived for the continuous current topology. The only difference 
would be the continuity of source current and the difference in voltage across the C3; now it 
is equal to Vd in which the voltage across the capacitor is much larger than other topology. 
Similarly, it is possible to derive the boost factor for topologies shown in Figure 8.33c and d 
as B = 1/(1−4Ds).
8.9.3  Simulation Results
Extensive simulation studies are performed on the open-loop configuration of all proposed topol-
ogies in MATLAB®/SIMULINK® using the modulation method proposed in reference. However, 
due to space limitations, only a few results are presented. This would validate the operation of 
diode-assisted and capacitor-assisted topologies as well as continuous current and discontinu-
ous current topologies. Here, three cases are simulated. In all the three cases, the input voltage 
is kept constant at 240 V, and a three-phase load of 9.7 Ω resistor bank is used. All DC-side 
capacitors are 1000 µF, and inductors are 3.5 mH. The AC-side second-order filter is used with 
a 10 µF capacitor and a 7 mH inductor. In all the three cases, the converter is operated with zero 
boosting in the beginning, and at t = 250 ms, the shoot-through is increased to 0.25, whereas the 
modulation index is kept constant at 0.7. Figures 8.35 through 8.37 show the simulation results 
corresponding to the topologies shown in Figures 8.30a, 8.31a, and 8.33b. From these figures, it 
is possible to note that in the first two cases, equal boosting is achieved, and the difference is the 
voltage across VC3. This complies with the theoretical finding. From Figure 8.37, it can be noted 
that with the capacitor-assisted topology, a much higher boosting can be achieved with the same 
shoot-through value; also, the voltage across all four capacitors is equal and complies with the 
equations derived in Section 8.9.2. A comprehensive set of simulation results will be presented 
in the full paper.

9 Multilevel and Soft-Switching 
DC/AC Inverters
Multilevel inverters represent a novel method of constructing DC/AC inverters. This idea was 
published by Nabae in 1980 in an IEEE international conference IEEE APEC’80, and the 
same idea was published in 1981 in IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications. Actually, 
multilevel inverters represent a different technique from the pulse-width modulation (PWM) 
method, which consists of vertically chopping a reference waveform to achieve a similar out-
put waveform (e.g., sine wave). The multilevel inverting technique consists of accumulating 
the levels horizontally to achieve the waveform (e.g., sine wave). The soft-switching technique 
was implemented in DC/DC conversion in the 1980s. We would like to introduce this tech-
nique in DC/AC ­inverters as well, in the current chapter.
9.1  INTRODUCTION
Although PWM inverters have been used in industrial applications, they have many drawbacks: 
	
1.	The carrier frequency must be very high. Mr. Mohan nominated mf > 21, which means 
that fΔ > 1 kHz if the frequency of the output waveform is 50 Hz. Usually, to keep the total 
harmonic distortion (THD) small, fΔ is chosen to be 2–20 kHz.
	
2.	The pulse height is very high. In a normal PWM waveform (not multistage PWM), the height 
of all pulses is the DC-link voltage. The output voltage of this PWM inverter has a large 
jumping span. For example, if the DC-link voltage is 400 V, all pulses have the peak value of 
400 V. Usually, this causes a large dv/dt and a strong electro-magnetic interference (EMI).
	
3.	The pulse width would be very narrow when the output voltage has a low value. For exam-
ple, if the DC-link voltage is 400 V, the output is 10 V; the corresponding pulse width 
should be 2.5% of the full pulse period.
	
4.	Items 2 and 3 induce a number of harmonics to produce poor THD.
	
5.	Items 2 and 3 offer very rigorous switching conditions. The switching devices have large 
switching power losses.
	
6.	The inverter control circuitry is complex, and the devices are costly. Therefore, the whole 
inverter is costly.
The multilevel inverter accumulates the output voltage in horizontal levels (layers). Therefore, using 
this technique, the above-mentioned drawbacks of the PWM technique can be overcome because of 
the following features of multilevel inverters: 
	
1.	The switching frequencies of most switching devices are low and are equal to or only few 
times the output signal frequency.
	
2.	The pulse heights are quite low. For an m-level inverter with output amplitude Vm, the pulse 
heights are Vm/m or only few times of it. Usually, this causes a low dv/dt and an ignorable EMI.
	
3.	The pulse widths of all pulses have reasonable values to be comparable with the output signal.
	
4.	Items 2 and 3 cannot induce enough harmonics to produce lower THD.
	
5.	Items 2 and 3 offer smooth switching conditions. The switching devices have small switch-
ing power losses.
	
6.	The inverter control circuitry is comparatively simple, and the devices are not costly. 
Therefore, the whole inverter is economical.

Power Electronics
Multilevel inverters contain several power switches and capacitors. The output voltages of multi-
level inverters are the additions of the voltages due to the commutation of the switches. Figure 9.1 
shows a schematic diagram of one phase leg of inverters with different level numbers. A two-level 
inverter, as shown in Figure 9.1a, generates an output voltage with two levels with respect to the 
negative terminal of the capacitor. The three-level inverter shown in Figure 9.1b generates a three-
level voltage, and the m-level inverter shown in Figure 9.1c generates an m-level voltage. Thus, the 
output voltages of multilevel inverters have several levels. Moreover, they can reach high voltage, 
whereas the power semiconductors must withstand only reduced voltages. 
Multilevel inverters have been receiving increasing attention in recent decades, as they have 
many attractive features as described before. Various kinds of multilevel inverters have been pro-
posed, tested, and installed. 
•	 Diode-clamped (neutral-clamped) multilevel inverters (DCMI)
•	 Capacitors-clamped (flying capacitors) multilevel inverters
•	 Cascaded multilevel inverters (CMIs) with separate DC sources
•	 Hybrid multilevel inverters
•	 Generalized multilevel inverters (GMIs)
•	 Mixed-level multilevel inverters
•	 Multilevel inverters through the connection of three-phase two-level inverters
•	 Soft-switched multilevel inverters
The family tree of multilevel inverters is shown in Figure 9.2. 
The family of multilevel inverters has emerged as the solution for high-power application, as 
implementation via a single power semiconductor switch directly in a medium-voltage network is 
hard work. Multilevel inverters have been applied to different high-power applications, such as large 
motor drives, railway traction applications, high-voltage DC transmissions, unified power flow con-
trollers, static var compensators, and static synchronous compensators. The output voltage of the 
multilevel inverter has many levels, synthesized from several DC voltage sources. The quality of the 
output voltage is improved as the number of voltage levels increases; hence the effort of output filters 
can be decreased. The transformers can be eliminated due to the reduced voltage that the switch 
endures. Moreover, as cost-effective solutions, the applications of multilevel inverters have also been 
extended to medium- and low-power applications such as electrical vehicle propulsion systems, 
active power filters, voltage sag compensations, photovoltaic systems, and distributed power systems.
Multilevel inverter circuits have been investigated for nearly 30 years. Separate DC-sourced 
full-bridge cells were connected in series to synthesize a staircase AC output voltage. The diode-
clamped inverter, also called the neutral-point clamped inverter, was presented in 1980 by Nabae. 
As the neutral-point clamped inverter effectively doubles the device voltage level without requiring 
precise voltage matching, the circuit topology prevailed in the 1980s. The capacitor-clamped multi-
level inverter (CCMI) appeared in the 1990s. Although the CMI was invented earlier, its application

did not prevail until the mid-1990s. The advantages of CMIs were indicated for motor drives and 
utility applications. The cascaded inverter has drawn great interest due to the high demand for 
medium-voltage high-power inverters.
The cascaded inverter is also used in regenerative-type motor-drive applications. Recently, some 
new topologies of multilevel inverters have emerged, such as GMIs, mixed multilevel inverters, 
hybrid multilevel inverters, and soft-switched multilevel inverters. Today, multilevel inverters are 
extensively used in high-power applications with medium-voltage levels such as laminators, mills, 
conveyors, pumps, fans, blowers, compressors, and so on. Moreover, as a cost-effective solution, 
the applications of multilevel inverters are also extended to low-power applications, such as photo-
voltaic systems, hybrid electrical vehicles, and voltage sag compensation, in which the effort of the 
output filter components can become much decreased due to low harmonics distortions of the output 
voltages of the multilevel inverters.
9.2  DIODE-CLAMPED MULTILEVEL INVERTERS
In this category, the switching devices are connected in series to make up the desired voltage rating 
and output levels. The inner voltage points are clamped by either two extra diodes or one high-
frequency capacitor. The switching devices of an m-level inverter are required to block a voltage 
level of VDC/(m − 1). The clamping diode needs to have different voltage ratings for different inner 
voltage levels. In summary, for an m-level diode-clamped inverter, 
•	 Number of power electronic switches = 2(m − 1)
•	 Number of DC-link capacitors = (m − 1)
•	 Number of clamped-diodes = 2 (m − 2)
•	 The voltage across each DC-link capacitor = VDC/(m − 1)
where VDC is the DC-link voltage. A three-level diode-clamped inverter is shown in Figure 9.3a with 
VDC = 2E. In this circuit, the DC-bus voltage is split into three levels by two series-connected bulk 
capacitors, C1 and C2. The middle point of the two capacitors, n, can be defined as the neutral point. 
The output voltage van has three states: E, 0, and −E. For voltage level E, switches S1 and S2 need to 
be turned on; for −E, switches S1, and S2, need to be turned on; and for the 0 level, switches S2 and 
S2′, need to be turned on. 
The key components that distinguish this circuit from a conventional two-level inverter are D1 
and D1′. These two diodes clamp the switch voltage to half the level of the DC-bus voltage. When

both S1 and S2 turn on, the voltage across a and 0 is 2E, that is, va0 = 2E. In this case, D1′, balances 
out the voltage sharing between S1′ and S2′ with S1′ blocking the voltage across C1 and S2′ blocking the 
voltage across C2. Note that the output voltage van is AC, and va0 is DC. The difference between van 
and va0 is the voltage across C2, which is E. If the output is removed between a and 0, then the circuit 
becomes a DC/DC converter, which has three output voltage levels: E, 0, and −E. The simulation 
waveform is shown in Figure 9.4.
Usually, the higher the number of levels, the lower the THD of the output voltage. The switching 
angle decides the THD of the output voltage as well. The THD of the three-level diode-clamped 
inverter is shown in Table 9.1. 
Figure 9.3b shows a five-level diode-clamped inverter in which the DC bus consists of four 
capacitors, C1, C2, C3, and C4. For DC-bus voltage 4E, the voltage across each capacitor is E, and 
each device voltage stress will be limited to one capacitor voltage level E through clamping diodes.

Multilevel and Soft-Switching DC/AC Inverters
To explain how the staircase voltage is synthesized, the neutral point n is considered as the output 
phase voltage reference point. There are five switch combinations to synthesize a five-level voltage 
across a and n.  
•	 For voltage level van = 2E, turn on all upper switches S1−S4.
•	 For voltage level van = E, turn on three upper switches S2−S4 and one lower switch S1′.
•	 For voltage level van = 0, turn on two upper switches S3 and S4 and two lower switches S1′ 
and S2′.
•	 For voltage level van = −E, turn on one upper switch S4 and three lower switches S1′−S3′.
•	 For voltage level van = −2E, turn on all lower switches S1′−S4′.
For a diode-clamped inverter, each output level has only one combination to implement its output 
voltage. Four complementary switch pairs exist in each phase. The complementary switch pair is 
defined such that turning on one of the switches will exclude the other from being turned on. In 
this example, the four complementary pairs are (S1, S1′), (S2, S2′), (S3, S3′), and (S4, S4′). Although 
each active switching device is only required to block a voltage level of E, the clamping diodes 
must have different voltage ratings for reverse voltage blocking. By using D1′ of Figure 9.3b as an 
example, when lower devices S2′−S4′ are turned on, D1′ needs to block three capacitor voltages, or 
3E. Similarly, D2 and D2′ need to block 2E, and D1 needs to block 3E.
The simulation waveform is shown in Figure 9.5.

A seven-level diode-clamped inverter has the waveform shown in Figure 9.6. 
From Figures 9.4 through 9.6, the THD is reduced when the number of levels of the inverter is 
increased. Hence, higher levels of the inverter will be considered to produce the output with less 
harmonic content.
Example 9.1
A diode-clamped three-level inverter is shown in Figure 9.3a. Determine the corresponding 
switching angles, switch status, and THD.
Solution
Refer to Figure 9.4; the switching angles in a cycle are
α1 = 360°/8 = 45°.
α2 = π −α1 = 180°−45° = 135°.
α3 = π + α1 = 180° + 45° = 225°.
α4 = 2π−α1 = 360°−45° = 315°.
The switches referring to Figure 9.3a operate in a cycle (0° to 360°) as follows: 
Turn on the upper switches S2 and the lower switches S1′ in 0°−α1.
Turn on all upper switches S1 and S2 in α1−α2.
Turn on the upper switches S2 and the lower switches S1′ in α2−α3.
Turn on all lower switches S1′−S2′ in α3−α4.

(FLYING CAPACITOR INVERTERS)
Figure 9.7 illustrates the fundamental building block of a phase-leg capacitor-clamped inverter. 
The circuit has been called the flying capacitor inverter with dependent capacitors clamping the 
device voltage to one capacitor voltage level. The inverter in Figure 9.8a provides a three-level out-
put across a and n, that is, van = E, 0, or −E. For the voltage level E, switches S1 and S2 need to be 
turned on; for −E, switches S1′ and S2′ need to be turned on; and for the 0 level, either pair (S1, S1′) or 
(S2, S2′) needs to be turned on. Clamping capacitor C1 is charged when S1 and S1′ are turned on, and 
is discharged when S2 and S2′ are turned on. The charge of C1 can be balanced by proper selection 
of the zero-level switch combination.

Power Electronics
The voltage synthesis in a five-level capacitor-clamped inverter has more flexibility than a diode-
clamped inverter. By using Figure 9.8b as an example, the voltage of the five-level phase leg a output 
with respect to the neutral point n, van, can be synthesized by the following switching combinations:
•	 For voltage level van = 2E, turn on all upper switches S1–S4.
•	 For voltage level van = E, there are three combinations:
•	 S1, S2, S3, S1′: van = 2E (upper C4) − E (C1).
•	 S2, S3, S4, S4′: van = 3E (C3) − 2E (lower C4).
•	 S1, S3, S4, S3′: van = 2E (upper C4) − 3E (C3) + 2E (C2).
•	 For voltage level van = 0, there are six combinations:
•	 S1, S2, S1′, S4′: van = 2E (upper C4) − 2E(C2).
•	 S3, S4, S3′, S4′: van = 2E (C2) − 2E (lower C4).
•	 S1, S3, S1′, S3′: van = 2E (upper C4) − 3E(C3) + 2E(C2) − E(C1).
•	 S1, S4, S2′, S3′: van = 2E (upper C4) − 3E(C3) + E(C1).
•	 S2, S4, S2′, S4′: van = 3E (C3) − 2E(C2) + E(C1) − 2E (lower C4).
•	 S2, S3, S1′, S4′: van = 3E (C3) − E(C1) − 2E (lower C4).
•	 For voltage level Van = −E, there are three combinations:
•	 S1, S1′, S2′, S3′: van = 2E (upper C4) − 3E(C3). 
•	 S4, S2′, S3′, S4′: van = E (C1) − 2E (lower C4).
•	 S3, S1′, S3′, S4′: van = 2E (C2) − E(C1) − 2E (lower C4).
•	 For voltage level van = −2E, turn on all lower switches, S11−S41.
Usually, the positive top level and the negative top level have only one combination to implement 
their output values. Other levels have various combinations to implement their output values. In the 
preceding description, the capacitors with positive signs are in the discharging mode, whereas those 
with negative sign are in the charging mode. By proper selection of capacitor combinations, it is 
possible to balance the capacitor charge.
Example 9.2
A capacitor-clamped three-level inverter is shown in Figure 9.7a. It operates in the equal-angle 
state, that is, the operation time in each level is 90°. Determine the switches’ status and the cor-
responding THD.
Solution
Refer to Figure 9.4; the switching angles in a cycle are 
α1 = 45°
α2 = 135°
α3 = 225°
α4 = 315°.
The switches referring to Figure 9.7a operate in a cycle (0–360°) as follows:
Turn on the upper switches S2 and the lower switches S2′ in 0°–α1. (Or turn on the upper 
switches S1 and the lower switches S1′ in 0°–α1.)
Turn on all upper switches S1 and S2 in α1–α2.
Turn on the upper switches S2 and the lower switches S2′ in α2–α3. (Or turn on the upper 
switches S1 and the lower switches S1′ in α2–α3.)
Turn on all lower switches S1′–S2, in α3–α4.
Turn on the upper switches S2 and the lower switches S2′ in α4–360°. (Or turn on the upper 
switches S1 and the lower switches S1′ in α4–360°.)

9.4  MULTILEVEL INVERTERS USING H-BRIDGE CONVERTERS
The basic structure is based on the connection of h-bridges (HBs). Figure 9.9 shows the power cir-
cuit for one phase leg of a multilevel inverter with three HBs (HB1, HB2, and HB3) in each phase. 
Each HB is supplied by a separate DC source. The resulting phase voltage is synthesized by the 
addition of the voltages generated by the different HBs. If the DC-link voltages of HBs are identical, 
the multilevel inverter is called the CMI. However, it is possible to have different values among the 
DC-link voltages of HBs, and the circuit can be called as the hybrid multilevel inverter. 
Example 9.3
A three-HB multilevel inverter is shown in Figure 9.8. The output voltage is van. It implements as 
a binary hybrid multilevel inverter (BHMI). Explain the inverter working operation, draw the cor-
responding waveforms, and indicate the source voltages arrangement and how many levels can 
be implemented.
Solution
The DC-link voltages of HBi (the ith HB), VDCi, are 2i−1 E. In a three-HB one phase leg, VDC1 = E, 
VDC2 = 2E, VDC3 = 4E.
The operation is listed in the following: 
+ 0: vH1 = 0, vH2 = 0, vH3 = 0.
+ 1E: vH1 = E, vH2 = 0, vH3 = 0.
+ 2E: vH1 = 0, vH2 = 2E, vH3 = 0.
+ 3E: vH1 = E, vH2 = 2E, vH3 = 0.

−3E: vH1 = −E, vH2 = −2E, vH3 = 0.

−7E: vH1 = −E, vH2 = −2E, vH3 = −4E.
As shown in the aforementioned figure, the output waveform, van, has 15 levels. One of the advan-
tages is that the HB with higher DC-link voltage has a lower number of commutations, thereby 
reducing the associated switching losses. The higher switching frequency components, for example, 
insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT), are used to construct the HB with lower DC-link voltages.
9.4.1  Cascaded Equal-Voltage Multilevel Inverters

where E is the unit voltage. Each HB generates three voltages at the output: +E, 0, and −E. This is 
made possible by connecting the capacitors sequentially to the AC side via the three power switches. 
The resulting output AC voltage swings from −3E to 3E with seven levels, as shown in Figure 9.9.

9.5  INVESTIGATION OF TRINARY HYBRID MULTILEVEL INVERTER
THMI has many advantages. Therefore, we would like to analyze carefully its characteristics in 
this section.
9.5.1  Topology and Operation
A single-phase THMI with h HBs connected in series is shown in Figure 9.13. The key feature 
of the THMI is that the ratio of DC-link voltage is 1: 3: · · ·: 3h − 1, where h is the number of HBs. 
The maximum number of synthesized voltage levels is 3h.

Multilevel and Soft-Switching DC/AC Inverters
As shown in Figure 9.13, vHi represents the output voltage of the ith HB. VDCi represents the 
DC-link voltage of the ith HB. A switching function, Fi, is used to relate VHi and VDCi as shown in 
the following equation:

The value of Fi can be either 1 or −1 or 0. For the value 1, switches Si1 and Si4 need to be turned on. 
For the value −1, switches Si2 and Si3 need to be turned on. For the value 0, switches Si1 and Si3 need 
to be turned on or Si2 and Si4 need to be turned on. Table 9.2 represents the relationship between the 
switching function, the output voltage of an HB, and states of switches. 
The output voltage of the THMI, van, is the summation of the output voltages of HBs.

From Equation 9.12, we obtain the relationship between the output voltage of the inverter, van, and 
the values of the switching functions in the THMI with different numbers of HBs. In the case of 
a two-HB THMI, Table 9.3 shows the relationship between the output voltage of the inverter and 
the values of switching functions. The waveforms of a single-phase two-HB THMI are shown in 
Figure 9.14.
The output voltage of a single-phase three-HB THMI has 27 levels. vvH1, vH2, and vH3 can be neg-
ative when van is positive. Table 9.4 shows the relationship between the output voltage of the inverter 
and the values of switching functions in a single-phase three-HB THMI. From Equation  9.11,

Multilevel and Soft-Switching DC/AC Inverters
9.5.2  Proof That the Trinary Hybrid Multilevel Inverter 
Has the Greatest Number of Output Voltage Levels
Among the existing multilevel levels, THMI has the greatest levels of output voltage using the same 
number of components. In this section, first, the theoretical proof for this conclusion is specified; 
then the comparison of various kinds of multilevel inverters is given.
9.5.2.1  Theoretical Proof
This section proves that the THMI has the greatest levels of output voltage using the same number 
of HBs among the multilevel inverters using HBs connected. A phase-voltage waveform is obtained 
by summing the output voltages of h HBs as shown in Equation 9.7.
If the DC-link sources of all HB cells are equal, the multilevel inverter is called the CMI and the 
maximum number of levels of phase voltage is given by 
	
m

(9.14)
On the other hand, if at least one of the DC-link sources is different from the others, the multilevel 
inverter is called the hybrid multilevel inverter. In Section 9.4, the BHMI, the QLMI, and the THMI 
are introduced. Thus, considering that the lowest DC-link source E is chosen as the base value for 
the p.u. notation, the normalized values of all DC-link voltages must be natural numbers to obtain 
a uniform step multilevel inverter, that is,

From Equations 9.14, 9.18, and 9.19, it is possible to verify that hybrid multilevel inverters can gen-
erate a large number of levels with the same number of cells. Moreover, in the THMI, the DC-link 
voltages satisfy

Therefore, the THMI has the greatest levels of output voltages using the same number of HBs 
among the multilevel inverters using HBs connected.
9.5.2.2  Comparison of Various Kinds of Multilevel Inverters
Two kinds of comparisons are presented in this section. In the first comparison, the components are 
considered to have the same voltage rating, E. This comparison is for high-power and high-voltage 
applications, in which the devices connected in series are used to satisfy the requirement of high-
voltage ratings. Table 9.5 shows the comparison between multilevel inverters: DCMI, CCMI, CMI, 
GMI, BHMI, and THMI; m is the number of steps of phase voltage. From Table 9.5, we can find that 
CMI, BHMI, and THMI use fewer components. The CMI, BHMI, and THMI use the same number of 
components. However, in practical systems, the redundancy requirement must be satisfied. THMI uses

fewer components than BHMI and CMI in practical systems as THMI uses less-redundant components. 
Moreover, the THMI uses fewer DC sources than the CMI and BHMI. 
The second comparison is for medium- and low-power applications, in which the voltage rating 
of the main switching components, diodes, and capacitors can be researched easily. Therefore, the 
numbers of the main switching components, diodes, and capacitors are the minimal required val-
ues. Table 9.6 shows the comparison results of DCMI, CCMI, CMI, GMI, BHMI, and THMI. From 
Table 9.6, we can find that the THMI uses the fewest components among these multilevel inverters.
9.5.2.3  Modulation Strategies for Trinary Hybrid Multilevel Inverter
Five modulation strategies for the THMI are investigated: the step modulation strategy, the virtual 
stage modulation strategy, the hybrid modulation strategy, the subharmonics PWM strategy, and the 
simple modulation strategy. As multilevel inverters are used in three-phase systems generally, only 
modulation strategies for the three-phase systems will be investigated here. In the three-phase sys-
tems, the triple-order harmonic components of voltages need not be eliminated by the modulation 
strategies as they can be eliminated by proper connection of three-phase voltage sources and loads. 
In other words, only 5th, 7th, 11th, 13th, 17th, 19th... harmonic components should be eliminated 
by the modulation strategies. In addition, the amplitude of the fundamental component should be 
controlled. The list can be expressed by

The step modulation strategy, the virtual stage modulation strategy, and the simple modulation 
strategy belong to low-frequency modulation strategies. The high-frequency modulation strategies 
used in the hybrid multilevel inverters include the hybrid modulation strategy and the subharmonic 
PWM strategy.
9.5.2.3.1  Step Modulation Strategy
Figure 9.15 shows a general quarter-wave symmetric stepped voltage waveform synthesized by a THMI,

The constrained optimization approach can be used to solve the nonlinear and transcendental set of 
equations. Each equation is regarded as an equational constraint. However, the computational prob-
lems of constrained optimization do not converge easily. As in the actual electric system, there are 
always mismatches and parameter tolerances, lower order harmonics will be small but not exactly 
zero. This gives rise to the idea of transforming the constraint optimization model to a nonconstraint 
one. The nonconstraint optimization is expected to have a better convergence property.
The target function of the new scheme of optimization without equational constraints can be 
written as

(9.29)
Thus, the penalty factors place more emphasis on elimination of lower order harmonics. The 
function fmincon in the MATLAB® optimization toolbox was used to solve this minimization 
problem.
The two-HB THMI can synthesize nine-level output voltage. Figures 9.16 and 9.17 show the 
typical synthesized waveform of the phase leg voltage, line-to-line voltage waveform, and their 
frequency spectrums, as MR is equal to 0.83. The switching angles are 0.1478, 0.3232, 0.5738, and 
0.9970. According to Equation 9.26, the fifth, seventh, and eleventh harmonics of the phase leg 
voltage can be eliminated in the two-HB THMI as shown in Figure 9.16. The THD of the phase leg 
voltage is 9.66%. The triple-order harmonic components do not exist in the line-to-line voltage as 
shown in Figure 9.17. The THD of the line-to-line voltage is 5.91%.
According to Equation 9.25, all switching angles must satisfy the constraint (Equation 9.25). 
If switching angles do not satisfy the constraint, this scheme no longer exists. The theoretical 
maximum amplitude of the fundamental component is 4ςE/π, which occurs as θ1–θh is equal to 
zero. On account of the internal restriction of switching angles, the relative modulation index has 
upper and lower limitations. The limitation of the relative modulation index can be explained using 
Figures 9.18 and 9.19.

470
Power Electronics
As shown in Figure 9.18, when the relative modulation index is less than a certain value, denoted 
by MR (min), θς approaches π/2 and the limitation of the minimum modulation index occurs. 
Similarly, when the relative modulation index is greater than MR(max), θ1 approaches 0 and the 
limitation of the maximum modulation index occurs as shown in Figure 9.19.
For a THMI with h HBs, the maximum number of levels of the phase leg voltage is m, which is 
equal to 3h. The maximum number of the positive/negative phase leg voltage levels is σmax, which

is equal to (m − 1)/2. As mentioned earlier, the relative modulation index MR has limitations. To 
extend to the smaller ranges of the modulation index, the inverter will output fewer voltage levels. 
Consequently, the number of positive/negative voltage levels that the inverter outputs, σ, is smaller 
than the maximum number of the positive/negative levels, σmax. In the step modulation strategy, the 
number of switching angles in the quarter wave of van, ς, is equal to σ. The definition of the relative 
modulation index, MR, is based on σ as shown in Equation 9.26. This definition is easily included 
in Equation 9.25 to express the nonlinear transcendental equation sets that are used to calculate the 
switching angles. In practice, the modulation index, M, is used. M is based on the σmax and can be 
expressed as

The relationship between MR and M can be expressed as

(9.31)
In the two-HB THMI, according to Equation 9.26, the maximum MR is calculated as 0.86 and the 
minimum MR is 0.55 as the levels of output voltage are nine. The range of M is also from 0.55 to 0.86 
with the nine-level output voltage. To extend to the lower modulation index, fewer output voltage lev-
els are synthesized. The range of MR is 0.46–0.83 when the output voltage levels are seven. According 
to Equation 9.31, the range of M is 0.34–0.62 when the output voltage levels are seven. Thus, the 
modulation range is extended to 0.34 by decreasing the levels of output voltage.
Table 9.7 shows the relative modulation index and the modulation index with different output 
voltage levels in the two-HB THMI. First, the minimum and maximum MR are calculated by the 
optimization method. Second, the minimum and maximum M is calculated by using Equation 9.31. 
It is preferable to use more output voltage levels. The last column of Table 9.7 shows the arrange-
ment of M with different output voltage levels. In addition, the maximum limitation of M can reach 
0.94 irrespective of the elimination of the 11th harmonic, as shown in the last row of Table 9.7. 
The scheme of switching angles of the two-HB THMI is shown in Figure 9.20. When the modu-
lation index reaches the lower limitation, such as 0.34, the third switching angle is close to π/2, 
which verifies Figure 9.18. When the modulation index reaches the maximum value 0.86 or 0.94, 
the first angle is close to zero, which verifies Figure 9.19. 
9.5.2.3.2  Virtual Stage Modulation Strategy
In the step modulation strategy, the output voltage levels of the multilevel inverter limit the amount 
of eliminated lower order harmonics. Only three lower order harmonics can be eliminated by the

stages, four more degrees of freedom of switching angles are created such that the 13th, 17th, 19th, 
and 23rd harmonics can be eliminated from the phase leg voltage as shown in Figure 9.22. The 
THD of the phase leg voltage is 10.67%. The triple-order harmonic components of the line-to-line 
voltage do not exist and the harmonics are pushed to 1250 Hz as shown in Figure 9.23. The THD of 
the line-to-line voltage is 7.3%.  
In the virtual stage modulation strategy, the relative modulation index also has upper and lower 
limitations. Compared with the step modulation strategy, the optimal computation of the virtual 
stage modulation strategy endures more unequal restrictions as shown in Equations 9.35 and 9.36. 
When the switching angles do not satisfy these restrictions, the themes of switching angles no lon-
ger exist.
The concept of the relative modulation index can be used in the step modulation strategy by a 
similar method. Table 9.8 shows two cases. One is the nine-level output voltage with two virtual 
stages and the other is the seven-level output voltage with one virtual stage. With the nine-level 
output voltage and two virtual stages, the 5th, 7th, 11th, 13th, 17th, 19th, and 23rd harmonics 
can be eliminated. With the seven-level output voltage and one virtual stage, the 5th, 7th, 11th, 
and 13th can be eliminated. When the output voltage levels are five or three, the virtual stage 
modulation strategy is not applicable in the two-HB THMI as the restriction (Equation 9.36) must 
be violated. Therefore, when M is less than 0.38 in this case, the step modulation strategy will 
be used. With the virtual stage modulation strategy, the scheme of switching angles is shown in 
Figure 9.24.

9.5.2.3.3  Hybrid Modulation Strategy
The hybrid modulation strategy for the hybrid multilevel inverters has been presented, which incor-
porates stepped voltage waveform synthesis in higher power HB cells in conjunction with high-
frequency variable PWM in the lowest power HB cell. Figure 9.25 presents a block diagram of the 
command circuit utilized to determine the command signals of the power devices of all HBs. As 
shown in Figure 9.25, the reference signal of the hybrid multilevel inverter, vref, is the command signal 
of the HB with the highest DC voltage source (VDC,h). This signal is compared with a voltage level 
corresponding to the sum of all smaller DC voltage sources of the hybrid multilevel inverter, σmax,h−1. 
If the command signal is greater than this level, the output of the inverter with the highest DC voltage 
source must be equal to VDC,h. In addition, if the command signal is less than the negative value of 
σmax,h−1, the output of this cell must be equal to −VDC,h, otherwise the output of this cell must be zero.

Power Electronics
The command signal of the ith HB cell is the difference between the command signal of the 
HBi+1 and the output voltage of the HBi+1. In this way, the command signal of the ith cell contains 
information about the harmonic content of the output voltage of all higher voltage cells. This com-
mand signal is compared with a voltage level corresponding to the sum of all voltage sources until 
the HBi−1 (σmax,i−1). In the same way as that presented for the HBh, the output voltage of this cell is 
synthesized from the comparison of these two signals.
Finally, the command signal of HB1 (the lowest power inverter) is compared with a high-
frequency triangle carrier signal, resulting in a high-frequency output voltage. Therefore, the output 
voltage harmonics will be concentrated around the frequency multiples of the switching frequency 
of the inverter with the lowest DC voltage source. Consequently, the spectral response of the output 
voltage depends on the switching frequency of the lowest power inverter, whereas the power pro-
cessing depends on the inverter with the highest DC voltage source.
However, with the hybrid modulation strategy, a voltage waveform must be synthesized to modu-
late at high frequency among all adjacent voltage steps. Only the lower voltage HB can switch at 
high frequency, so the DC voltages must satisfy the following equation:

where * means the normalized value. Therefore, the hybrid modulation strategy can be applied in 
BHMIs and QLMIs. The relationship between the DC voltages of the THMI is shown in Equation 
9.20, so the THMI cannot use the hybrid modulation strategy.
9.5.2.3.4  Subharmonic PWM Strategies
Subharmonic PWM strategies for multilevel inverters employ extensions of carrier-based tech-
niques used for conventional inverters. It has been reported that the spectral performance of a five-
level waveform can be significantly improved by employing alternative dispositions and phase shifts 
in the carrier signals. This concept can be extended to a nine-level case with the available options 
for polarity and phase variation. A representative subharmonic PWM waveform with the nine-level 
phase leg voltage is shown in Figure 9.26. 
If a two-HB THMI is used to synthesize the nine-level phase leg voltage as shown in Figure 9.26b, 
the higher voltage HBs will switch at high frequencies, as the output voltage varies between E and 2E 
or −E and −2E continually in a certain interval. In THMI, it is not appropriate that the higher voltage 
HBs switch at a high frequency. Therefore, the subharmonic PWM is not applicable in THMI.

9.5.2.3.5  Simple Modulation Strategy
The simple modulation strategy is the simplest modulation strategy with which the switching pat-
tern is determined by comparing a reference signal with stages and then choosing the stages most 
close to the reference signal. Figure 9.27 shows an illustration of the simple modulation strategy 
with the nine-level output voltage. 
The advantages of this strategy are a simple control algorithm, high flexibility, and dynamic 
response. The disadvantage of the strategy is that the amplitudes of lower order harmonic components 
are relatively higher. The THMI can generate the greatest voltage levels among all multilevel inverters 
using the same number of components. If the number of voltage levels is high enough, the lower order 
harmonic components of output voltages will be very small with the simple modulation strategy. For 
example, in the case of a four-HB THMI that can generate 81-level voltage, with the simple modulation 
strategy, the amplitude of each lower order harmonic component of the output voltage is less than 0.9% 
of the amplitude of the fundamental component and the THD of the output voltage is less than 2%.
9.5.2.3.6  Several Modulation Strategies
Several modulation strategies have been investigated. With the hybrid modulation strategy and mod-
ulation strategies working with high switching frequencies, such as the subharmonic PWM strategy, 
a voltage waveform must be synthesized to modulate at high frequency among all adjacent voltage 
steps. However, in THMI, it cannot be achieved when only the lowest voltage HB switches at a high 
frequency, which can be derived from Equations 9.20 and 9.37. In other words, if a voltage can be 
synthesized to modulate at high frequency in THMI, the higher voltage HBs must switch at high 
frequency. One of the most important advantages of THMI is that higher voltage HBs can switch at 
lower frequency. Therefore, higher frequency switching of higher voltage HBs is not only unaccept-
able in high-power applications but also violates the main advantage of THMI. Therefore, the hybrid 
modulation strategy and other modulation strategies working with high switching frequencies are not 
applicable in THMI. The low-frequency modulation strategies such as the step modulation strategy 
and the virtual stage modulation strategy are suitable for THMI. In the virtual stage modulation,

additional constraints, such as Equation 9.36 for two-HB THMI, must be added to ensure the higher 
HB switch at lower frequency. In addition, the simple modulation strategy can be used in those 
THMIs that can generate many voltage levels. At the same time, for those THMIs that can generate 
many voltage levels, the space vector modulation can achieve a very good linearity between the mod-
ulation index and the fundamental component of load voltage and eliminate common-mode voltages.
9.5.2.4  Regenerative Power
The DC sources of the THMI can be batteries or bridge rectifiers. Batteries cannot endure a large 
reverse current for a long time, which will damage them. Diode bridge rectifiers cannot permit 
reverse power. Controlled bridge rectifiers can transmit energy to supplies. However, compared with 
simple diode bridge rectifiers, the controlled bridge rectifiers are much more complex and costly 
because of complex control circuits and the higher price of controlled semiconductors.
9.5.2.4.1  Analysis of DC-Bus Power Injection
The switching function is involved in the analysis of DC-bus power injection. The switching func-
tion, F, is shown in Table 9.8. The relationship between the output voltage of an HB, vH, and the 
DC-link voltage of the HB, VDC, can be written as Equation 9.38. The relationship between iDC 
(current flowing through the DC bus) and ian (output current of the THMI) can be also derived as 
Equation 9.39.

9.5.2.4.2  Regenerative Power in THMI
Regenerative power may occur in lower voltage HBs of THMI. Take the example of a two-HB 
THMI. If the step modulation strategy is applied, the restrictions that are added to Equation 9.35 to 
ensure that the power of DC buses is always positive are shown in Table 9.9. With these restrictions, 

480

ranges of the relative modulation index are calculated as shown in Table 9.10. The range of the rela-
tive modulation index decreases greatly when σ is two or three compared with Table 9.10. The range 
of the modulation index is not continuous as shown in the last column of Table 9.10. The regenera-
tive power will occur in the lower voltage HB when M ranges from 0.51 to 0.55 or from 0.33 to 0.44.
Consider that the virtual stage modulation strategy is used in a two-HB THMI. In Table 9.10, two 
cases are analyzed. One is four-level positive/negative output voltage with two virtual stages and the 
other is five-level positive/negative output voltage with one virtual stage. It is possible only for the 
DC bus of the lower voltage HB to have regenerative power. For the first case, the restriction that 
ensures positive power can be written as

9.5.2.4.3  Method for Avoiding Regenerative Power
In the previous subsection, the regenerative power that lower voltage HBs may generate was dis-
cussed. In this section, the methods that are usually used to solve this problem will be introduced. 
A method is proposed that the DC links of lower voltage HBs are supplied with low-power, iso-
lated power sources fed by a common power supply from the highest voltage HB. These power 
sources are bidirectional and a bidirectional DC–DC power supply is used for this purpose. It 
is also possible to use independent output transformers with a common DC supply as shown in 
Figure 9.30. A variation of this configuration was used by ABB in his 16 2 3
(
) Hz substation for 
railroads in Bremen (Germany). In the system described here, the transformers are smaller for 
lower voltage HBs because the voltages are scaled to the power of three. Besides, the switching 
frequency of the transformers connected with lower voltage HBs is lower. Then the transform-
ers connected with lower voltage HBs become smaller for two reasons: voltage and switching 
frequency (Figure 9.29). 
The above-mentioned two methods to solve the problem of regenerative power use additional 
equipment, such as the bidirectional DC/DC converter or output transformers, which increase the 
cost of the inverter system and power losses. A new method is presented to avoid regenerative 
power. This method does not use additional devices. The regenerative power is eliminated by avoid-
ing outputting several null voltage levels, which will be explained with the example of a four-HB 
THMI in the following.
The average power of the DC bus of an HB can be expressed as Equation 9.50. In general, the PF 
angle φ ranges from −π/2 to π/2; so cos(φ) is greater than zero. VDC and Ian are positive. Therefore, 
from Equation 9.50 and Figure 9.27, we can conclude that the reason for the regenerative power is 
the negative segments of vH when the fundamental components of van are positive or the positive 
segments of vH when the fundamental components of van are negative. The segments of vH resulting 
in the regenerative power of the HB are called regenerative segments. The basic idea of eliminat-
ing regenerative power is to avoid outputting several levels of van, which will cause regenerative 
segments in HBs. Table 9.12 shows the voltage levels of van that cause regenerative segments of 
HBs in the case of a four-HB THMI. The voltage levels of van that are not selected to output are 
called null voltage levels. Table 9.12 also shows the priory of null voltage levels. For example, if the

regenerative power occurs in the DC link of the HB1, the voltage level (14) and (−14) are selected 
as null voltage levels first. If the regenerative power still occurs, the voltage levels (17) and (−17) 
are also selected as null voltage levels. With the priory shown in Table 9.12, the null voltage levels 
distribute as evenly as possible, which results in better power quality.
Figure 9.30 shows the flowchart of the algorithm that stabilizes the DC-link voltage of an HB. 
VDC is the DC-link voltage of an HB. VDC, normal is the normal DC-link voltage. VDC, last is the DC-link 
voltage in the previous sampling. Nnull is the number of null voltage levels. In the switch table, the 
voltage levels are set as null or not based on Nnull in Table 9.12. 
With a lower modulation index, the power quality that the THMI outputs is a little bit poorer 
with the proposed control scheme, because more null voltage levels do not devote themselves to the 
output voltage of the THMI. In the case of the four-HB THMI, with up to 81-level output voltage of 
the THMI, the simple modulation strategy as shown in Section 9.5.2 is suitable for the THMI. If the 
simple modulation strategy is used and the new method is applied to eliminate the effect of regen-
erative power, the relationship between the modulation index and the THD is shown in Figure 9.31.

9.5.2.4.4  Summary of the Regenerative Power in THMI
The topology of the THMI has the distinct advantage that less components are used compared with 
the topologies of other multilevel inverters, but the THMI also has the notable disadvantage that the 
power of the lower voltage HBs may be regenerative with a lower modulation index. If the THMI 
feeds an RL or RC load and simple diode bridge rectifiers are used as DC sources, then the regenera-
tive power will cause the DC capacitor voltages to increase, which will damage the devices.
Therefore, basically, the THMI is suitable for two applications. The first is the application of 
reactive power compensation. The average power of the DC link of an HB is zero when the PF 
angle is zero as shown in Equation 9.50, so the problem of regenerative power is avoided. The 
second is the application in which the inverter always runs with a higher modulation index. From 
Table 9.10, we can find that the two-HB THMI runs with step modulation without the problem of 
regenerative power when M ranges from 0.56 to 0.94. From Table 9.11, we can find that the two-
HB THMI runs with virtual stage modulation without the problem of regenerative power when M 
is from 0.62 to 0.92.
However, the inverter is required to work at any modulation index for active load in most cases. 
Two methods have been presented to solve the regenerative power problem. The first uses bidi-
rectional DC/DC converters and the second uses additional output transformers. A new method 
to solve the regenerative power is presented as a cost-effective solution because it does not use 
additional equipment. The DC capacitor voltages of lower voltage HBs are kept stable by the new 
method. The tradeoff is that power quality will decrease a little with lower modulation index.

is used as the main processor, which provides the gate logic signals. In an HB, four metal oxide 
semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFETs), IRF540, are used as the main switches, which 
are connected in a full-bridge configuration. The load is a 23.2 Ω resistor. The total ratio of voltage 
measure is 1:2. The frequency spectrums are analyzed by the fast Fourier transform (FFT) function 
of an oscilloscope. The scale of the Y-axis of the frequency spectrum is 5 dB V/div and that of the 
reference level is 5 dB V.
The switching pattern of the step modulation technique is programed and is loaded to the DSP. 
In the step modulation strategy, when the number of output voltage levels is nine and M is equal 
to 0.83, the switching angles will be 0.14778, 0.32325, 0.57376, and 0.99696. The THMI output 
voltage is shown in Figure 9.32. The frequency is 50 Hz, and the step voltage is about 5 V. The 
frequency spectrum is shown in Figure 9.33. The 5th, 7th, and 11th harmonics are less than 0.028 V 
(−37 dB × 2 V), which means that they are nearly eliminated. This verifies the simulation result as 
shown in Figure 9.16.  
When the number of output voltage levels is seven and M is equal to 0.49, the switching angles 
are 0.44717, 0.9097, and 1.1215. The output voltage of the THMI is shown in Figure 9.34 and 
the frequency spectrum is shown in Figure 9.35. The 5th and 7th harmonics are less than 0.02 V 
(−40 dB × 2 V), which means that they are nearly eliminated.  
When the number of output voltage levels is five and M is equal to 0.32, the switching angles 
are 0.51847 and 1.1468. The output voltage of the THMI is shown in Figure 9.36 and the frequency

means that they are nearly eliminated.  
The switching pattern of the modified virtual stage modulation technique is programmed and

and M is 0.83, the switching angles are 0.13177, 0.33186, 0.52855, 0.6202, 0.91294, 1.0423, 0.57124, 
and 0.96573. The output voltage of the THMI is shown in Figure 9.38 and the frequency spectrum is 
shown in Figure 9.39. The 5th, 7th, 11th, 13th, 17th, 19th, and 23rd harmonics are less than 0.035 V 
(−35 dB × 2 V), which means that they are nearly eliminated. It verifies the simulation result as 
shown in Figure 9.22.  
When the number of output voltage levels is seven and M is equal to 0.49, the switching 
angles are 0.40549, 0.88038, 1.1497, 1.5318, and 1.5082. The output voltage of the THMI is

9.5.3.2  Experiment to Verify the New Method of Eliminating the Regenerative Power
The performance of the methods of eliminating the effect of regenerative power by avoiding output-
ting the null voltage levels is verified by the experiment of a four-HB THMI, in which diode bridge 
rectifiers are used as the DC sources of HBs. The step voltage is 5.9 V. The frequency of the output 
voltage is set at 50 Hz, and the sampling frequency is set at 10 kHz. The inverter has up to 81 output 
voltage levels, so the simple modulation strategy is used as shown in Section 9.5.2. The control algo-
rithm to stabilize the DC-link voltages is shown in Figure 9.25. A TMS320F240 DSP-controlled card 
is used to control the inverter. The configuration of the experimental system is shown in Figure 9.42.
Figure 9.43 shows the waveform of the output voltage of the four-HB THMI with the simple 
modulation strategy when the modulation index is 0.79. The power quality is good due to a large 
number of voltage levels. 
Figure 9.44 shows the output voltage waveform with some null voltage levels when the modula-
tion index is 0.7. From the enlarged figure, we can observe that some voltage levels are not generated. 
Moreover, the step voltages are kept nearly the same, which means that the voltages of DC capacitors

levels of the inverter, the ratio of the DC-link voltages is arranged as 1:3:9:27, so the inverter can 
output 81 voltage levels at each phase. With four HBs per phase, however, a CMI can output only 
nine voltage levels at each phase and a BHMI can output only 31 voltage levels at each phase. The 
more output voltage levels a multilevel inverter has, the more nearly a sinusoidal waveform can be 
synthesized. Therefore, with the trinary hybrid topology, THD can be reduced to a great extent. 
The three phases of the inverter are controlled separately and the operating principle of each phase 
is identical. In the following, the A-phase of the inverter is analyzed. HBak represents the kth HB in the 
A-phase leg of the inverter as shown in Figure 9.47. vH,ak and vC,ak represent the output voltage and the 
DC-link voltage of the HBak, respectively. A switching function, Fak, is used to relate vH,ak and vC,ak as

The value of Fak can be either 1 or −1 or 0. For the value 1, the upper switch of the left leg and the 
lower switch of the right leg in an HB need to be turned on. For the value −1, the lower switch of 
the left leg and the upper switch of the right leg in an HB need to be turned on. For the value 0, the 
upper switches of both legs or the lower switches of both legs need to be turned on. The A-phase

Considering this definition, we can find vectors generated by three-phase voltages, which produce 
zero common-mode voltage as shown in Figure 9.49. The use of only vectors that generate zero

Step 3. v′ref will lie in one of the rectangles defined by two normalized candidate space vectors, 
as shown in the right part of Figure 9.50. The rectangle is identified by the values of the left 
bottom point of the rectangle. v′ref (x, y) lies in the rectangle [floor(x), floor(y)], in which 
floor (α) is the function that rounds the elements of α to the nearest integer that is less than 
or equal to α. In the rectangle [floor(x), floor(y)], there are two normalized voltage vectors, 
[floor(x), floor(y)] and [floor(x)+1, floor(y)+1], if the addition of floor(x) and floor(y) is 
even. The two vectors are [floor(x)+1, y] and [x, floor(y)+1], if the addition of floor(x) and 
floor(y) is odd. Suppose that the reference vector, v′ref (x, y), lies in the rectangle with two 
normalized voltage vectors, v1 and v2. The nearest vector is selected by comparing the dis-
tances of each candidate vector, v1 and v2, with respect to vref, using the following equations:

Multilevel and Soft-Switching DC/AC Inverters
9.5.4.2  DC Sources of H-Bridges
There are three reasons to set DC sources of HBs as bidirectional DC/DC converters in the pro-
posed topology. The first reason is that the bidirectional DC/DC converter can transfer the regenera-
tive power from the HB to the rectifier. In an HB, the output voltage is vH and the current flowing 
through the HB is iH, as shown in Figure 9.51. 
Only the fundamental component of the output current of the inverter is considered as high-
frequency harmonic components do not generate average power. Thus, the average power flowing 
through the DC link of the HB, PH, dc, can be expressed as

where vC is the DC-link voltage of the HB and IH is the amplitude of iH. Here, φ is the angle of PF 
for the fundamental components of vH and iH. In Equation 9.70, if θj is greater than π/2, θj will be set 
as π/2. In general, the PF angle φ ranges from −π/2 to π/2, so cos(φ) is greater than zero. vC and IH 
are positive. Thus, we can conclude from Equation 9.71 that the power of the DC link is negative if

When the inverter feeds the motor, the power of the DC link of the HB with the highest DC volt-
ages is always positive. However, the power of the DC link of other HBs may be negative with 
a lower modulation index. Therefore, the bidirectional DC/DC converter is necessary here to 
transfer the regenerative power of the DC link back to the rectifier to avoid the increase of the 
DC-link voltage.
The second reason is that the variation of the DC-link voltage of an HB is required to be very 
small. For example, the variation of the DC-link voltage of the HB with the DC-link voltage of 27E 
must be less than 0.5/27 = 0.019. Otherwise, the contribution of the HB with a DC-link voltage of 
E for the power quality will be almost nothing. The DC/DC converters with high bandwidth closed-
loop control can stabilize the DC-link voltages of the HBs.
The third reason is that the transformers used in the bidirectional converters are small, cost 
effective, and highly efficient. In other topologies of hybrid multilevel inverters for motor drives, the 
output ports of HBs are connected together by transformers. However, these low-frequency trans-
formers are bulky and have low efficiency. Compared with the configurations with low-frequency 
transformers, the efficiency of the DC/DC converter is higher. The efficiency of the DC/DC con-
verter measured in the low-power experiments is around 90%. In practical high-power applications, 
it can reach 97%, which is much higher than that of the traditional configuration of low-frequency 
transformers and rectifiers.

Power Electronics
Several topologies of bidirectional DC/DC converters were proposed. The topology of a bidi-
rectional DC/DC converter is used in the proposed system shown in Figure 9.52. The transformer 
provides galvanic isolation between the input and the output. The primary side of the converter is 
a half-bridge and is connected to the DC link of a rectifier. All DC/DC converters share a diode 
rectifier as shown in Figure 9.52. The secondary side, connected to the DC link of the HB, forms a 
current-fed push–pull. The converter has two modes of operation. In the forward mode, the DC link 
of an HB is powered by the DC link of the rectifier. In the backward mode, the DC link of an HB 
provides energy to the DC link of a rectifier.
The left part of Figure 9.53 shows the idealized waveforms in the forward mode: Interval t0–t1: 
Switch S2 is off and S1 is on at time t0. A voltage across the primary winding is vCr/2. The body 
diode of switch S4, DS4, is forward biased. The current flow through S1, iS1 contributes to the linearly 
increasing inductor current and the transformer primary magnetizing current. Interval t1–t2: Switch 
S1 is turned off at time t1 and S2 remains on. No power is transferred to the secondary side during this 
dead-time interval as there is zero voltage across the primary side. The energy stored in Lo results 
in the freewheeling of the current iLo, equally through the body diodes DS3 and DS4. Interval t2–t3: 
Switch S2 is turned on at time t2 and S1 remains off. The operation is similar to that during interval

t0–t1, but now DS3 conducts and provides secondary side rectification. Inductor current rises linearly 
again. Interval t3–t4: Switch S2 is turned off at time t2 and S1 remains off. The operation is similar to 
that in the interval t1–t2. Figure 9.54 shows a balancing winding Np1 and two diodes D1 and D2 on the 
primary side of the half-bridge. They maintain the center point voltage at the junction of C1 and C2 to 
one-half of the input voltage and prevent a runaway condition of a staircase situation of the transformer 
core. Np1 has the same number of turns as the winding Np and is phrased in series with it through the 
on time of S1 and S2.  
In the backward mode, the switches S3 and S4 of the current-fed push–pull topology are driven at 
duty ratios greater than 0.5. The converter operation during this mode is shown in the right part of 
Figure 9.53. Interval t0–t1: Switch S3 is turned on and S4 remains on at time t0. NS is subject to a short 
circuit, which causes the inductor Lo to store energy as the DC-link voltage of the HB appears across 
it. iLo ramps up linearly and is shared equally by both S3 and S4. During this interval, C1 and C2 pro-
vide the output power. Interval t1–t2: Switch S4 is turned off and S3 remains on at time t1. The energy 
stored in the inductor during the previous interval is now transferred to the load through DS2 and D1. 
Voltages across Np1 and Np are identical due to their series phasing and equal number of turns. This 
allows simultaneous and equal charging of both C1 and C2 through D1 and DS2, respectively. Interval 
t2–t3: Switch S4 is turned on and S3 remains on at time t2. This interval is similar to the interval t0–t1. The 
duty ratio for S3 is therefore greater than 0.5. Interval t3–t4: Switch S3 is turned off and S4 remains on 
at time t3. The stored energy of Lo is transferred to the primary side of the converter through S4, DS1, 
and D2. The conduction of DS1 and D2 results in equal charging of C1 and C2, respectively. Current-mode 
control is used for both modes of converter operations. Small signal analyses for both modes under mode 
control are performed to generate the transfer functions to design and evaluate the control loop.
9.5.4.3  Motor Controller
The proposed multilevel inverter is used to feed an induction motor. The vector control technique 
is applied to the motor controller. Vector control implies independent control of flux-current and 
torque/current components of the stator current through a coordinated change in the supply voltage 
amplitude, phase, and frequency. As the flux variation tends to be slow, constancy of flux should 
produce a fast torque/current response and finally a fast speed (position) response.
The controller is shown in Figure 9.54, and the current decoupling network in the controller is 
shown in Figure 9.55. To simplify the current decoupling network, the rotor flux orientation is used 
in the current decoupling network. Once the reference d−q current i*
da, i*
qa and flux orientation angle 
θer + γ*
a are known, the DC current controllers are used to translate these commands to v*
da and v*
qa, 
and use Park transformation to translate v*
da and v*
qa to v*α and v*β. The output signal of the motor 
controller, v*α and v*β, will be sent to the inverter controller to control the multilevel inverter to 
provide the appropriate voltages to feed the motor.

9.5.4.4  Simulation and Experimental Results
The performance of the 81-level THMI for the motor drive presented earlier has been verified by 
simulation. The simulation investigations were performed with MATLAB®/Simulink®. The unit 
voltage of the multilevel inverter, E, is set as 10 V. The modulation index is defined as

(9.72)
where |van|1 is the fundamental amplitude of the output voltage. Based on the simulation results, the 
relationship between |van|1 and the modulation index is shown in Figure 9.56.
In the range of very low modulation index, it does not have a very good linear relationship. 
However, due to a great number of voltage steps, the relationship becomes satisfied linearly with 
higher modulation index.
When the inverter drives an induction motor, a command of speed step changes from 715 to 
1430 rpm in 1 ms. Figure 9.57 shows the simulation results of speed, output voltage of the inverter, 
output current of the inverter, DC-link voltages of HBs in the A-phase, and common-mode voltages. 
The speed has a rapid response. The common-mode voltage is always zero except during the short 
transition time. The THD of the output voltage is as low as 1%. Figure 9.58 shows the detailed wave-
forms of the output voltage of inverters. Figure 9.59 shows the simulation results of torque, output 
voltages, and output currents of the inverter, when the reference torque has a step change from 1.29 
to 7.74 Nm. The motor drive system also has a good dynamic response for the step change of torque.

Power Electronics
To verify the performance of the proposed inverter experimentally, a hardware prototype has 
been built in the laboratory. The experimental setup of the proposed control system consists of a 
three-phase, 380 V, 50 Hz, 4 pole, 3-kW induction motor and a power circuit using a THMI. The 
inverter and the motor are controlled using TMS320F240 controller cards. Current-mode controller 
of the DC/DC converters is implemented by UC 3846 and UCC 3804, for the forward mode and 
backward mode, respectively. Figures 9.60 and 9.61 show the waveforms of speed, phase current, 
phase voltage, and line-to-line voltage when the reference speed of the motor has a step change, 
which verify the simulation results as shown in Figure 9.57. Figure 9.62 shows the detailed wave-
forms of phase voltage and common-mode voltage. As shown in Figure 9.62, the phase voltage is 
synthesized by many stable step voltages and the common-mode voltage is almost zero.

Multilevel and Soft-Switching DC/AC Inverters
9.6  OTHER KINDS OF MULTILEVEL INVERTERS
Several other kinds of multilevel inverters are introduced in this subsection.
9.6.1  Generalized Multilevel Inverters
A GMI topology has been presented previously. The existing multilevel inverters, such as DCMIs 
and CCMIs, can be derived from this GMI topology. Moreover, the GMI topology can balance each 
voltage level by itself, regardless of load characteristics. Therefore, the GMI topology provides a 
true multilevel structure that can balance each DC voltage level automatically at any number of 
levels, regardless of active or reactive power conversion, and without any assistance from other 
circuits. Thus, in principle, it provides a complete multilevel topology that embraces the existing 
multilevel inverters.
Figure 9.63 shows the GMI structure per phase leg. Each switching device, diode, or capaci-
tor’s voltage is E, that is, 1/(m − 1) of the DC-link voltage. Any inverter with any number of levels, 
including the conventional two-level inverter, can be obtained using this generalized topology. 
As an application example, a four-level bidirectional DC/DC converter, shown in Figure 9.64, 
is suitable for the dual-voltage system to be adopted in future automobiles. The four-level DC/DC

converter has a unique feature, which is that no magnetic components are needed. From this GMI 
inverter topology, several new multilevel inverter structures can be derived. 
9.6.2  Mixed-Level Multilevel Inverter Topologies
For high-voltage high-power applications, it is possible to adopt multilevel diode-clamped or 
capacitor-clamped inverters to replace the full-bridge cell in a CMI. The reason for doing so is to 
reduce the amount of separate DC sources. The nine-level cascaded inverter requires four separate 
DC sources for one phase leg and 12 for a three-phase inverter. If a three-level inverter replaces the 
full-bridge cell, the voltage level is effectively doubled for each cell. Thus, to achieve the same nine 
voltage levels for each phase, only two separate DC sources are needed for one phase leg and six for 
a three-phase inverter. The configuration can be considered as having mixed-level multilevel cells 
because it embeds multilevel cells as the building block of the CMI.

Multilevel and Soft-Switching DC/AC Inverters
9.6.3  Multilevel Inverters by Connection of Three-Phase Two-Level Inverters
Standard three-phase two-level inverters are connected by transformers as shown in Figure 9.65. In 
order for the inverter output voltages to be added up, the inverter outputs of the three modules need 
to be synchronized with a separation of 120° between each phase. For example, obtaining a three-
level voltage between outputs a and b, the voltage is synthesized by Vab = Va1−b1 + Va1−b1 + Va1−b1. 
The phase between b1 and a2 is provided by a3 and b3 through an isolated transformer. With three 
inverters synchronized, the voltages Va1−b1, Va1−b1, and Va1−b1 are all in phase; thus, the output level is 
simply tripled. 
9.7  SOFT-SWITCHING MULTILEVEL INVERTERS
There are numerous ways of implementing soft-switching methods, such as zero voltage switching 
(ZVS) and zero current switching (ZCS), to reduce the switching losses and to increase efficiency 
for different multilevel inverters. For the CMI, because each inverter cell is a two-level circuit, the 
implementation of soft switching is not at all different from that of conventional two-level invert-
ers. For capacitor- or diode-clamped inverters, however, the choices of soft-switching circuits can 
be found with different circuit combinations. Although ZCS is possible, most literature works pro-
posed ZVS types including the auxiliary resonant commutated pole, the coupled inductor with zero 
voltage transition (ZVT), and their combinations.
9.7.1  Notched DC-Link Inverters for Brushless DC Motor Drive
The brushless DC motor (BDCM) has been widely used in industrial applications because of 
its low inertia, fast response, high power density, and high reliability and because it is mainte-
nance free. It exhibits the operating characteristics of a conventional commutated DC permanent 
magnet motor, but eliminates the mechanical commutator and brushes. Hence many problems 
associated with brushes are eliminated such as radiofrequency interference and sparking, which 
is the potential source of ignition in the inflammable atmosphere. It is usually supplied by a 
hard-switching PWM inverter, which normally has low efficiency as the power losses across 
the switching devices are high. To reduce the losses, many soft-switching inverters have been 
designed.
The soft-switching operation of the power inverter has attracted much attention in the recent 
decade. In electric motor drive applications, soft-switching inverters are usually classified into three

categories, namely resonant pole inverters, resonant DC-link inverters, and resonant AC-link invert-
ers. The resonant pole inverter has the disadvantage of containing a considerably large number of 
additional components, in comparison with other hard- and soft-switching inverter topologies. The 
resonant AC-link inverter is not suitable for BDCM drivers.
In medium-power applications, the resonant DC-link concept offered the first practical and reli-
able way to reduce commutation losses and to eliminate individual snubbers. Thus, it allows high 
operating frequencies and improved efficiency. The inverter is quite simple enough to get the ZVS 
condition of the six main switches only by adding one auxiliary switch. However, the inverter has 
the drawbacks of high voltage stress of the switches, high voltage ripple of the DC link, and the 
frequency of the inverter relating to the resonant frequency. Furthermore, the inductor power losses 
of the inverter are also considerable as current flows in the inductor always. To overcome the draw-
backs of high-voltage stress of the switches, an actively clamped resonant DC-link inverter was 
introduced. The control scheme of the inverter is too complex and the output contains subharmonics 
that, in some cases, cannot be accepted. These inverters still do not overcome the drawbacks of high 
inductor power losses.
To generate voltage notches of the DC link at controllable instants and reduce the power losses 
of the inductor, several quasiparallel resonant schemes were proposed. As a dwell time is gener-
ally required after every notch, severe interferences occur, mainly in multiphase inverters, appre-
ciably worsening the modulation quality. A novel DC-rail parallel resonant ZVT voltage source 
inverter is introduced; it overcomes the many drawbacks mentioned earlier. However, it requires 
two ZVTs per PWM cycle; it would worsen the output and limit the switch frequency of the 
inverter.
On the other hand, the majority of soft-switching inverters proposed in recent years have been 
aimed at the induction motor-drive applications. So it is necessary to study the novel topology of the 
soft-switching inverter and the special control circuit for BDCM drive systems. The current chapter 
proposed a novel resonant DC-link inverter for the BDCM drive system that can generate voltage 
notches of the DC link at controllable instant and width. Moreover, the inverter possesses the advan-
tage of low switching power loss, low inductor power loss, low voltage ripple of the DC link, low 
device voltage stress, and a simple control scheme.
The construction of the soft-switching inverter is shown in Figure 9.66. There is a front 
uncontrolled rectifier to obtain DC supply. The input AC supply can be single phase for low/

medium power or three phases for medium/high power. It contains a resonant circuit, a con-
ventional circuit and a control circuit. The resonant circuit contains three auxiliary switches 
(one IGBT and two fast switching thyristors), a resonant inductor, and a resonant capacitor. All 
auxiliary switches work under the ZVS or ZCS condition. This generates voltage notches of the 
DC link to guarantee that the main switches S1–S6 of the inverter operate in the ZVS condition. 
The fast switching thyristor is the proper device for use as an auxiliary switch. We need not 
control the turn off of a thyristor, and it has higher surge current capability than any other power 
semiconductor switcher. 
9.7.1.1  Resonant Circuit
The resonant circuit consists of three auxiliary switches: one resonant inductor and one resonant 
capacitor. The auxiliary switches are controlled at a certain instant to obtain the resonance between 
the inductor and the capacitor. Thus, the voltage of the DC link reaches zero temporarily (voltage 
notch) and the main switches of the inverter get ZVS condition for commutation.
As the resonant process is very short, the load current can be supposed to be constant. 
The equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 9.67. The corresponding waveforms of the auxiliary 
switches gate signal, resonant capacitor voltage (uCr), inductor current (iLr), and current of switch 
SL (iSL) are illustrated in Figure 9.68. The operation of the ZVT process can be divided into six 
modes.  
Mode 0 (as shown in Figure 9.69a) 0 < t < t0. Its operation is the same as that of the con-
ventional inverter. Current flows from the DC source through SL to the load. The voltage 
across Cr (uCr) is equal to the voltage of the supply (Vs). The auxiliary switches Sa and Sb 
are in the off state.  
Mode 1 (as shown in Figure 9.69b) t0 < t < t1. When it is the instant for phase current com-
mutation or the PWM signal is flopped from “1” to “0,” the thyristor Sa is fired (ZCS turn 
on due to Lr) and IGBT SL is turned off (ZVS turn off due to Cr) at the same time. The 
capacitor Cr resonates with inductor Lr and the voltage across capacitor Cr is decreased.

iLr(t) is zero at t = t1. Then the thyristor Sa is self-turned-off.
Mode 2 (as shown in Figure 9.69c) t1 < t< t2. None of the auxiliary switches is fired, and the 
voltage of the DC link (uCr) is zero. The main switches of the inverter can now be either 
turned on or turned off under ZVS condition during the interval. The load current flows 
through the freewheeling diode D.
Mode 3 (as shown in Figure 9.69d) t2 < t < t3. As the main switches have turned on or turned 
off, the thyristor Sb is fired (ZCS turn on due to Lr) and iLr starts to build up linearly in the 
auxiliary branch. The current in the freewheeling diode D begins to fall linearly. The load 
current is slowly diverted from the freewheeling diodes to the resonant branch. But uCr is 
still equal to zero. We have

At t3, iLr equals the load current IO and the current through the diode becomes zero. Thus, the 
freewheeling diode turns off under zero-current condition.
Mode 4 (as shown in Figure 9.69e) t3 < t < t4. iLr is increased continuously from IO and uCr is 
increased from zero when the freewheeling diode D is turned off. Redefining the initial time, 
we obtain the same equation as Equation 9.74. But the initial conditions are uCr(0) = 0 and

Mode 5 (as shown in Figure 9.69f) t4 < t < t5. When the DC-link voltage is equal to the sup-
ply voltage, the auxiliary switch SL is turned on (ZVS turned on due to Cr). iLr is decreased 
linearly from IO to zero at t5 and the thyristor Sb is self-turned-off.
Then go back to mode 0 again. The operation principle of the other procedure is the same as that of 
a conventional inverter.
9.7.1.2  Design Consideration
The design of the resonant circuit is to determine the resonant capacitor Cr, the resonant inductor Lr, 
and the switching instants of the auxiliary switches Sa, Sb, and SL. It is assumed that the inductance 
of BDCM is much higher than resonant inductance Lr. From the analysis presented previously, the 
design considerations can be summarized as follows:
The auxiliary switch SL works under ZVS condition, the voltage stress is DC power supply volt-
age Vs. The current flow through it is load current. The auxiliary switches Sa and Sb work under the 

509
Multilevel and Soft-Switching DC/AC Inverters
ZCS condition, the voltage stress is Vs/2 and the peak current flow through them is iLr−m. As the 
resonant auxiliary switches Sa and Sb carry the peak current only during switch transitions, they can 
be rated as lower continuous currents.
The resonant period is expressed as Tr = 1/fr = 2π L C
r
r ; for high switching frequency inverters, 
Tr should be as short as possible. For getting the expected Tr, the resonant inductor and capacitor 
values have to be selected. The first component to be designed is the resonant inductor. Small induc-
tance values can yield small Tr, but the rising slope of the inductor current diLr /dt = Vs /2Lr should 
be small to guarantee that the freewheeling diode turns off. For the 600–1200 V power diode, the 
reverse recovery time is about 50–200 ns, and the rule to select an inductor is

Certainly inductance is as high as possible. This implies that a high inductance value is necessary. 
Thus an optimum value of the inductance has to be chosen that would reduce the inductor current 
rise slope, whereas Tr would be small enough.
The capacitance value is inversely proportional to the ascending or descending slope of the 
DC-link voltage. It means that capacitance is as high as possible for the switch SL to get the ZVS 
condition, but as the capacitance increases, more and more energy gets stored in it. This energy 
should be charged or discharged via the resonant inductor; with high capacitance, the peak value 
of the inductor current will be high. The peak value of iLr should be limited to twice the peak load 
current. From Equations 9.75 through 9.82, we obtain

(9.84)
Thus an optimum value of the capacitance has to be chosen that would limit the peak inductor cur-
rent, whereas the ascending or descending slope of the DC-link voltage is low enough.
9.7.1.3  Control Scheme
When the duty of PWM is 100%, that is, when there is no PWM, the main switches of the inverter work 
under commutation frequency. When it is the instant to commutate the phase current of the BDCM, we 
control the auxiliary switches Sa, Sb, and SL, and resonance occurs between Lr and Cr. The voltage of 
the DC link reaches zero temporarily; thus, the ZVS condition of the main switches is obtained. When 
the duty of PWM is less than 100%, the auxiliary switch SL works as a chop. The main switches of the 
inverter do not switch within a PWM cycle when the phase current does not need to commutate. It has 
the benefit of reducing the phase current drop when the PWM is off. The phase current is commutated 
when the DC-link voltage becomes zero. So there is only one DC-link voltage notch per PWM cycle. It 
is very important especially for very low or very high duty of PWM in which the interval between two 
voltage notches is very short, even overlapping, which will limit the tuning range.
The commutation logical circuit of the system is shown in Figure 9.70. It is similar to the con-
ventional BDCM commutation logical circuit except for adding six D flip-flops to the output. Thus, 
the gate signal of the main switches is controlled by the synchronous pulse CK that will be men-
tioned later, and the commutation can be synchronized with the auxiliary switches control circuit. 
The operation of the inverter can be divided into the PWM operation and non-PWM operation. 
	
1.	Non-PWM operation: When the duty of PWM is 100%, that is, when there is no PWM, 
the whole ZVT process (modes 1 through 5) occurs when the phase current commutation 
is ongoing. The control scheme for the auxiliary switches in this operation is illustrated in 
Figure 9.71a. When mode 1 begins, the pulse signal for the thyristor Sa is generated by a 
monostable flip-flop, and the gate signal for IGBT SL is decreased to a low level (i.e., turn 

510
Power Electronics
off the SL) at the same time. Then, the pulse signal for the thyristor Sb and the synchro-
nous pulse CK can be obtained after two short delays (delay1 and delay2, respectively). 
Obviously delay1 is longer than delay2. Pulse CK is generated during mode 2 when the 
voltage of the DC link is zero, and the main switches of the inverter get the ZVS condition. 
Then modes 3 through 5 occur, and the voltage of the DC link is increased to that of the 
supply again.  
	
2.	PWM operation: In this operation, the auxiliary switch SL works as a chop, but the main 
switches of the inverter do not turn on or turn off within a single PWM cycle when the 
phase current does not need to commutate. The load current is commutated when the 
DC-link voltage becomes zero, that is, when the PWM signal is “0” (as the PWM cycle is 
very short, it does not affect the operation of the motor). The control scheme for the auxil-
iary switches in PWM operation is illustrated in Figure 9.71b. 
•	 When the PWM signal is flopped from “1” to “0,” mode 1 begins, the pulse signal for 
the thyristor Sa is generated, and the gate signal for IGBT SL is decreased to a low level. 
But the voltage of the DC link does not increase until the PWM signal is flipped from 
“0” to “1.” Pulse CK is generated during mode 2.
•	 When the PWM signal is flipped from “0” to “1,” mode 3 begins, and the pulse signal 
for the thyristor Sb is generated at the moment (mode 3). Then, when the voltage of 
the DC link is increased to E (the voltage of the supply), the gate signal for IGBT SL is 
flipped to a high level (modes 4 and 5).
Thus, only one ZVT occurs per PWM cycle: modes 1 and 2 for PWM turned off and modes 3 
through 5 for PWM turned on. In addition, the switching frequency would not be greater than the 
PWM frequency.

Multilevel and Soft-Switching DC/AC Inverters
Normally, a drive system requires a speed or position feedback signal to get high speed or position 
precision and to be less susceptible to disturbances of load and power supply. The speed feedback sig-
nal can be derived from a tachometer-generator, an optical encoder, a resolver or a rotor position sen-
sor. Quadrature encoder pulse (QEP) is a standard digital speed or position signal and can be inputted 
to many devices (e.g., the special DSP for the drive system TMS320C24x has a QEP receive circuit). 
The QEP can be easily derived from the rotor position sensor of a BDCM. The converter digital cir-
cuit and interesting waveforms are shown in Figure 9.72. Some single-chip computers have a digital 
counter and may require only direction and pulse signals; thus, the converter circuit can be simpler. 
The circuit can be implemented by a complex programmer logical device and can only occupy the 
partial resources of one chip. The circuit can also be implemented by gate array logic (GAL) IC (e.g., 
16V8) and some D flip-flop IC (e.g., 74LS74). With the circuit, a high-precision speed or position 
signal can be obtained when the motor speed is high or the drive system has a high-ratio speed reduc-
tion mechanism. In high-performance systems, the rotor position sensor may be a resolver or optical 
encoder, with special-purpose decoding circuitry. At this level of control sophistication, it is possible 
to fine-tune the firing angles and the PWM control as a function of speed and load, to improve vari-
ous aspects of performance such as efficiency, dynamic performance, or speed range.

and logical gate. The gate signals of auxiliary switches Sa and Sb in PWM and non-PWM operation 
modes are combined by the OR gate. The gate signal of SL in the two operation modes is combined 
by the AND gate, and the synchronous signal (CK) is combined by a date selector. The middle bot-
tom of the diagram shows the commutation logical circuit of the BDCM (Figure 9.70); it is synchro-
nized (by CK) with the auxiliary switches control circuit. 
Waveforms of the DC-link voltage uCr, resonant inductor current iLr, BDCM phase current, 
inverter output line–line voltage, and gate signal of the auxiliary switches are shown in Figure 9.74. 
The value of the resonant inductor Lr is 10 µH and the resonant capacitor Cr is 0.047 µF; so the 
period of the resonant circuit is about 4 µs. The frequency of the PWM is 20 kHz. From the figure,

we can see that the output of the simulation matches the theoretical analysis. The waveforms in 
Figure 9.74b through h are the same as those in Figure 9.75.  
To verify the theoretical analysis and simulation results, the proposed soft-switching inverter was 
tested on an experimental prototype rated as 
DC link voltage: 240 V
Power of the BDCM: 3.3 hp
Switching frequency: 10 kHz.
A polyester capacitor of 47 nF and 1500 V was adopted as the DC-link resonant capacitor Cr. The 
resonant inductor was of µH/20 A with ferrite core. The design of the auxiliary switches con-
trol circuit was referenced from Figure 9.74. The monostable flip-flop can be implemented by IC 
74LS123, the delay can be implemented by Schmitt Trigger and RC circuit, and the logical gate can 
be replaced by a programmable logical device to reduce the number of ICs.
The waveforms of the voltage across the switch and the current under hard switching and soft 
switching are shown in Figure 9.75a and b, respectively. All the voltage signals come from differ-
ential probes, and there is a gain of 20. For voltage waveform, 5.00 V/div = 100 V/div, which is the 
same for Figure 9.76. It can also be seen that there is a considerable overlap between the voltage and 
current waveforms during the switching under hard switching. The overlap is much less with soft 
switching. 
A serial of key waveforms with the soft-switching inverter is shown in Figure 9.76. The default 
scale is DC-link voltage, 100 V/div, and the current is 20 A/div. The default switching frequency is 
10 kHz. The DC-link voltage is fixed at 240 V. These experimental waveforms are similar to the 
simulation waveforms in Figure 9.74.
9.7.2  Resonant Pole Inverter
The resonant pole inverter is a soft-switching DC/AC inverter circuit and is shown in Figure 9.77. 
Each resonant pole comprises resonant inductor and a pair of resonant capacitors at each phase 
leg. These capacitors are directly connected in parallel to the main inverter switches to achieve 
(ZVS) condition. In contrast to the resonant DC-link inverter, the DC-link voltage remains unaf-
fected during the resonant transitions. The resonant transitions occur separately at each resonant 
pole when the corresponding main inverter switch needs switching. Therefore, the main switches 
in the inverter phase legs can switch independently from each other and choose the commutation 
instant freely. Moreover, there is no additional main conduction path switch. Thus, the normal 
operation of the resonant pole inverter is entirely the same as that of the conventional hard-
switching inverter.

Power Electronics
The auxiliary resonant commutated pole inverter and the ordinary resonant snubber inverter 
provide a ZVS condition without increasing the device voltage and current stress. These inverters 
can achieve real PWM control. However, they require a stiff DC-link capacitor bank that is center-
taped to accomplish commutation. The center voltage of the DC link is susceptible to drift that may 
affect the operation of the resonant circuit. The resonant transition inverter uses only one auxiliary 
switch, the switching frequency of which is much higher than that applied to the main switches. 
Thus, it will limit the switching frequency of the inverter. Furthermore, the three resonant branches 
of the inverter work together and will be affected by each other. A Y-configured resonant snubber 
inverter has a floating neutral voltage that may cause overvoltage failure of the auxiliary switches. 
A delta (Δ)-configured resonant snubber inverter avoids the floating neutral voltage and is suitable 
for multiphase operation without circulating currents between the off-state branch and its corre-
sponding output load. However, the inverter requires three inductors and six auxiliary switches.
Moreover, resonant pole inverters have been applied in induction motor-drive applications. They 
are usually required to change two-phase switch states at the same time to obtain a resonant path. 
It is not suitable for a BDCM drive system as only one switch is needed to change the switching

state in a PWM cycle. The switching frequency of three upper switches (S1, S3, and S5) is different 
from that of three lower switches (S2, S4, and S6) in an inverter for a BDCM drive system. All the 
switches have the same switching frequency in a conventional inverter for induction-motor appli-
cations. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a novel topology of the soft-switching inverter and 
special control circuit for BDCM drive systems. This chapter proposes a special designed resonant 
pole inverter that is suitable for BDCM drive systems and is easy to apply in industry. In addition, 
this inverter possesses the following advantages: low switching power losses, low inductor power 
losses, low switching noise, and a simple control scheme.
9.7.2.1  Topology of the Resonant Pole Inverter
A typical controller for the BDCM drive system is shown in Figure 9.78. 
The rotor position can be sensed by a Hall-effect sensor or a slotted optical disk, providing three 
square-waves with phase shift in 120°. These signals are decoded by a combinatorial logic to pro-
vide the firing signals for 120° conduction on each of the three phases. The basic forward control 
loop is the voltage control implemented by PWM (the voltage reference signal compared with a 
triangular wave or a wave generated by a microprocessor). The PWM is applied only to the lower 
switches. This not only reduces the current ripple but also avoids the need for a wide bandwidth in 
the level-shifting circuit that feeds the upper switches. The three upper switches work under com-
mutation frequency (typically several hundreds of Hz), and the three lower switches work under 
PWM frequency (typically tens of kHz). So it is not important that the three upper switches work 
under soft-switching condition. The switching power losses can be reduced significantly, and the 
auxiliary circuit would be simpler if only three lower switches work under soft-switching condi-
tion. Thus, a special design resonant pole inverter for the BDCM drive system is introduced for this 
purpose. The structure of the proposed inverter is shown in Figure 9.79. 
The system contains a diode bridge rectifier, a resonant circuit, a conventional three-phase 
inverter, and a control circuitry. The resonant circuit consists of three auxiliary switches (Sa, Sb, and 
Sc), one transformer with turn ratio 1:n, and two diodes Dfp and Dr. Diode Dfp is connected in paral-
lel to the primary winding of the transformer, and diode Dr is serially connected with secondary

winding across the DC link. There is one snubber capacitor connected in parallel to each lower 
switch of the phase leg. The snubber capacitor resonates with the primary winding of the trans-
former. The emitters of the three auxiliary switches are connected together. Thus, the gate drive of 
these auxiliary switches can use one common output DC power supply.
In the whole PWM cycle, the three lower switches (S2, S4, and S6) can be turned off in the ZVS 
condition as the snubber capacitors (Cra, Crb, and Crc) can slow down the voltage rise rate. The turn-
off power losses can be reduced and the turn-off voltage spike is eliminated. Before turning on the 
lower switch, the corresponding auxiliary switch (Sa, Sb, or Sc) must be turned on ahead of time. The 
snubber capacitor is then discharged, and the lower switches get the ZVS condition. During phase 
current commutation, the switching state is changed from one lower switch to another (e.g., turn off 
S6 and turn on S2), S6 can be turned off directly in the ZVS condition, and by turning on the auxiliary 
switch Sc to discharge the snubber capacitor Crc, the switch S2 can get the ZVS condition. During 
phase current commutation, if the switching state is changed from one upper switch to another 
upper switch, the operation is the same as that of the hard-switching inverter, as the switching power 
losses of the upper switches are much smaller than that of the lower switches.
9.7.2.2  Operation Principle
For the sake of convenience, to describe the operation principle, we investigate the period of time 
when the switch S1 is always turned on, when switch S6 works under PWM frequency, and when other 
main inverter switches are turned off. As the resonant transition is very short, it can be assumed that 
the load current is constant. The equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 9.80. Where Vs is the DC-link 
voltage, iLr is the transformer primary winding current, uS6 is the voltage drop across the switch S6 
(i.e., snubber capacitor Crb voltage), and IO is the load current. The waveforms of the switches (S6 and Sb) 
gate signal, PWM signal, the main switch S6 voltage drop (uS6), and the transformer primary winding 
current (iLr) are illustrated in Figure 9.81, and the details will be explained next. Accordingly, at the 
instant t0–t6, the operation of one switching cycle can be divided into seven modes.  
Mode 0 (as shown in Figure 9.82a) 0 < t < t0: After the lower switch S6 is turned off, the load 
current flows through the upper freewheeling diode D3, and the voltage drop uS6 (i.e., snub-
ber capacitor Crb voltage) across the switch S6 is the same as that of the DC-link voltage. 
The auxiliary resonant circuit does not operate.

Mode 1 (as shown in Figure 9.82b) t0 < t < t1: If the switch S6 is turned on directly, the capaci-
tor discharge surge current will also flow through switch S6; thus, switch S6 may face the 
risk of a second breakdown. The energy stored in the snubber capacitor must be discharged 
ahead of time. Thus, the auxiliary switch Sb is turned on (ZCS turn on as the current iLr 
cannot change suddenly due to the transformer inductance). As the transformer primary 
winding current iLr begins to increase, the current flowing through the freewheeling diode 
decays. The secondary winding current iLrs also begins to conduct through diode Dr to the 
DC link. Both of the terminal voltages of the primary and secondary windings are equal 
to the DC-link voltage Vs. By neglecting the resistances of the windings
	
and using the transformer equivalent circuit (referred to as the primary side), we obtain

IO. The sum current flowing through switch Sb and diode Dfp is the transformer primary

decays to zero.
Mode 5 t4 < t < t5: The transformer primary winding current decays to zero and the resonant 
circuit idles. This state is probably the same operational state as the conventional hard-
switching inverter. The load current flows from the DC link through the two switches 
S1 and S6, and the motor.
Mode 6 (as shown in Figure 9.82f) t5 < t < t6: The main inverter switch S6 is turned off directly, 
and the resonant circuit does not work. The snubber capacitor Crb can slow down the rising 
rate of uS6, whereas the main switch S6 operates in the ZVS condition. The duration of the

The next period starts from mode 0 again, but the load current flows through the freewheeling diode

another (e.g., turn off S6 and turn on S2), S6 can be turned off directly in the ZVS condition (similar to 
mode 6), and by turning on the auxiliary switch Sc to discharge the snubber capacitor Crc, the switch 
S2 can get the ZVS condition (similar to modes 1 through 4).
9.7.2.3  Design Considerations
It is assumed that the inductance of BDCM is much higher than the transformer leakage inductance. 
From the previous analysis, the design considerations can be summarized as follows: 
	
1.	Determine the value of the snubber capacitor Cr and the parameter of the transformer.
	
2.	Select the main and auxiliary switches.
	
3.	Design the control circuitry for the main and auxiliary switches.
The turn ratio (1: n) of the transformer can be determined ahead of time. Equation 9.90 must satisfy 
	
n > 2	
(9.98)
On the other hand, from Equation 9.96, the transformer primary winding current iLr will take a long 
time to decay to zero if n is too big. So n must be a moderate number. The equivalent inductance of 
the transformer Lr = Ll1 + Ll2/n2 is inversely proportional to the rise rate of the switch current when 
the auxiliary switches are turned on. This means that the equivalent inductance Lr should be big 

523

Lr can be referenced from the rule depicted in reference.

where ton is the turn-on time of an IGBT, and IO max is the maximum load current. The snubber 
capacitance Cr is inversely proportional to the rise rate of the switch voltage drop when the lower 
main inverter switches are turned off. This means that the capacitance is as high as possible to limit 
the rising rate of the voltage to work in the ZVS condition. The selection of the snubber capacitor 
can be determined as

on. With high capacitance, the peak value of the transformer current will also be high. The peak 
value of iLr should be restricted to twice that of the maximum load current. From Equation 9.92,

Three lower switches of the inverter (i.e., S4, S6, and S2) are turned on during mode 3 (i.e., lag the ris-
ing edge of PWM at the time range Δt1 + Δt2 ~ Δt1 + Δt2 + Δt3). To turn on these switches at a fixed 
time (say ΔT1), lagging the rising edge of PWM under various load currents for control convenience, 
the following condition should be satisfied.

For high switching frequencies, Tw should be as short as possible. Select the equivalent inductance 
Lr and the snubber capacitance Cr to satisfy Equations 9.98 through 9.103, and Lr and Cr should be 
as small as possible.
As the transformer operates at high frequency (20 kHz), the magnetic core material can be fer-
rite. The design of the transformer needs the parameters of form factor, frequency, input/output volt-
age, input/output maximum current, and ambient temperature. From Figure 9.60, the transformer

current can be simplified as triangle waveforms and then the form factor can be determined as 2/√3. 
Ambient temperature is dependent on the application field. Other parameters can be obtained from 
the previous section. The transformer only carries current during the transition of turning on a 
switch in one cycle, so the winding can be of a smaller diameter.
The main switches S1–6 work under the ZVS condition; therefore, the voltage stress is equal to the 
DC-link voltage Vs. The device current rate can be load current. The auxiliary switches Sa–c work 
under ZCS or ZVS conditions, whereas the voltage stress is also equal to the DC-link voltage Vs. 
The peak current flowing through them is limited to double maximum load current. As the auxiliary 
switches Sa–c carry the peak current only during switch transitions, they can be rated with a lower 
continuous current rating. The additional cost will not be too much.
The gate signal generator circuit is shown in Figure 9.83. The rotor position signal decode 
module produces the typical gate signal of the main switches. The inputs of the module are rotor 
position signals, rotating direction of the motor, which enable the signal and PWM pulse-train. 
The rotor position signals are three square-waves with a phase shift in 120°. The enable signal is 
used to disable all outputs in case of emergency (e.g., over current, over voltage, and over heat). 
The PWM signal is the output of the comparator, comparing the reference voltage signal with 
the triangular wave. The reference voltage signal is the output of the speed controller. The speed 
controller is a processor (a single chip computer or a digital signal processor), and the PWM signal 
can be produced by software. The outputs (G1–G6) of the module are the gate signals applied to 
the main inverter switches. The outputs G1,3,5 are the required gate signals for the three upper main 
inverter switches.
The gate signals of the three lower main inverter switches and the auxiliary switches can be 
deduced from the outputs G4,6,2 as shown in Figure 9.84. The trailing edge of the gate signals for 
the three lower main inverter switches GS4,6,2 is the same as that of G4,6,2, and the leading edge of 
GS4,6,2 lags G4,6,2 for a short time ΔT1. The gate signals for the auxiliary switches GS4,6,2 have a fixed

are the outputs of monostable flip-flops M4,6,2 with the inputs G4,6,2. The three monostable flip-flops 
M4,6,2 have the same pulse width ΔT2. The gate signals GS4,6,2 are combined by the negative outputs 
of monostable flip-flops M1,3,5 and G4,6,2. The combining logical controller can be implemented by 
a D flip-flop with preset and clear terminals. The three monostable flip-flops M4,6,2 have the same 
pulse width ΔT1. Determination of the pulse widths of ΔT1 and ΔT2 is referenced from the theoreti-
cal analysis in Section 9.7.2.2. To get the ZVS condition of the main inverter switches under various 
load currents, the lag time should satisfy (Figure 9.85)

9.7.2.4  Simulation and Experimental Results
The proposed topology is verified by PSim simulation software. The DC-link voltage is 300 V, and 
the maximum load current is 25 A. The parameters of the resonant circuit were determined from 
Equations 9.98 through 9.104. The transformer turn ratio is 1:4, and the leakage inductances of 
the primary and secondary windings are 6 μH and 24 μH, respectively. Therefore, the equivalent 
transformer inductance Lr is 7.5 μH. The resonant capacitance Cr is 0.047 μF. Then, Δt1 + Δt2 and 
Δt1 + Δt2 + Δt3 can be determined under various load currents IO, as shown in Figure 9.86, consider-
ing the turn-off time of a switch lagging time ΔT1 and the pulse width ΔT2 are set as 2.1 μs and 5 μs, 
respectively. The frequency of the PWM is 20 kHz. Waveforms of the transformer primary winding 
current iLr, the switch S6 voltage drop uS6, PWM, the main switch S6, the auxiliary switch Sb, and 
the gate signal under low and high load currents are shown in Figure 9.86. The figure shows that the 
inverter worked well under various load currents. To verify the theoretical analysis and simulation 
results, the inverter was tested by experiment. The test conditions are 
	
1.	DC-link voltage: 300 V
	
2.	Power of the BDCM: 3.3 hp
	
3.	Rated phase current: 10.8 A
	
4.	Switching frequency: 20 kHz.

and Equations 9.98 through 9.104, the values of inductance and capacitance can be determined. 
Three polyester capacitors of 47 nF/630 V were adopted as the snubber capacitor for the three 
lower switches of the inverter. A high magnetizing inductance transformer with the turn ratio 1:4 
was employed in the experiment. Fifty-two-turn wires with size AWG 15 were selected as primary 
winding, and 208-turn wires with size AWG 20 were selected as secondary winding. The equiva-
lent inductance is about 7 µH. The switching frequency is 20 kHz. The rotor position signal decode 
module is implemented by a 20 leads GAL IC GAL16V8. The monostable flip-flop was set up by 
IC 74LS123, a variable resistor, and a capacitor. With (21) and (22), lag time and pulse width are 
determined to be 2.5 µs and 5 µs, respectively.
The system is tested in light load and full load currents. The voltage waveforms across the main 
inverter switch uS6 and its gate signal in low and high load currents are shown in Figure 9.87a and b, 
respectively. All the voltage signals are measured by a differential probe with a gain of 20; for 
voltage waveform, 5.00 V/div = 100 V/div. The waveforms of uS6 and its current iS6 are shown in 
Figure 9.87c, and dv/dt and di/dt are reduced significantly. The waveforms of uS6 and the transformer 
primary winding current iLr are shown in Figure 9.87d. The phase current is shown in Figure 9.87e.

Power Electronics
It can be seen that the resonant pole inverter works well under various load currents, and there is 
little overlap between the voltage and current waveforms during the switching under soft-switching 
condition; therefore, the switching power losses is low. The efficiency of hard switching and soft 
switching under rated speed and various load torques (p.u.) is shown in Figure 9.88. The efficiency 
improves with the soft-switching inverter. Therefore, the design of the system is successful.  
9.7.3  Transformer-Based Resonant DC-Link Inverter
To generate voltage notches of the DC link at controllable instants and reduce the power losses of 
the inductor, several quasiparallel resonant schemes were proposed. As a dwell time is generally 
required after every notch, severe interferences occur, mainly in multiphase inverters, appreciably 
worsening the modulation quality. A novel DC-rail parallel resonant ZVT voltage source inverter 
is introduced; it overcomes the many drawbacks mentioned earlier. However, it requires a stiff 
DC-link capacitor bank that is center taped to accomplish commutation. The center voltage of the 
DC link is susceptible to drift that may affect the operation of the resonant circuit. In addition, it 
requires two ZVTs per PWM cycle; it would worsen the output voltage and limit the switch fre-
quency of the inverter.
On the other hand, the majority of soft-switching inverters proposed in recent years have been 
aimed at the induction motor drive applications. So it is necessary to conduct research on the novel 
topology of the soft-switching inverter and the special control circuit for BDCM drive systems. This 
chapter proposed a resonant DC-link inverter based on the transformer for the BDCM drive system 
to solve the problems mentioned earlier. The inverter possesses the advantages of low switching 
power loss, low inductor power loss, low DC-link voltage ripple, small device voltage stress, and 
simple control scheme. The structure of the soft-switching inverter is shown in Figure 9.89. The 
system contains a diode bridge rectifier, a resonant circuit, a conventional three-phase inverter, and 
a control circuit. The resonant circuit consists of three auxiliary switches (SL, Sa, and Sb) and cor-
responding built-in freewheeling diodes (DL, Da, and Db), one transformer with turn ratio 1:n, and 
one resonant capacitor. All auxiliary switches work under the ZVS or ZCS condition. It generates

ing in the ZVS condition. 
9.7.3.1  Resonant Circuit
The resonant circuit consists of three auxiliary switches, one transformer, and one resonant capaci-
tor. The auxiliary switches are controlled at a certain instant to obtain the resonance between a 
transformer and a capacitor. Thus, the DC-link voltage reaches zero temporarily (voltage notch) 
and the main switches of the inverter get the ZVS condition for commutation. Since the resonant 
process is very short, the load current can be assumed to be constant. The equivalent circuit of the 
inverter is shown in Figure 9.90. Where Vs is the DC power supply voltage and IO is the load current.

The corresponding waveforms of the auxiliary switches gate signal, PWM signal, resonant capaci-
tor voltage uCr (i.e., DC-link voltage), and the transformer primary and secondary winding currents 
iLr and iSL of a switch (SL) are illustrated in Figure 9.91. The DC-link voltage is reduced to zero and 
then rises to the supply voltage again; this process is called a ZVT process or a DC-link voltage 
notch. The operation of the ZVT process in a PWM cycle can be divided into eight modes.
Mode 0 (as shown in Figure 9.92a) 0 < t < t0: Its operation is the same as the conventional 
inverter. Current flows from the DC power supply through SL to the load. The voltage uCr 
across the resonant capacitor Cr is equal to the supply voltage Vs. The auxiliary switches Sa 
and Sb are turned off.      
Mode 1 (as shown in Figure 9.92b) t0 < t < t1: When it is the instant for phase current com-
mutation or PWM, the signal is flopped from high to low, the auxiliary switch Sa is turned 
on with ZCS (as the iLr cannot suddenly change due to the transformer inductance), and 
switch SL is turned off with ZVS (as it cannot change suddenly due to the resonant capaci-
tor Cr) at the same time. The transformer primary winding current iLr begins to increase 
and the secondary winding current iLrs also begins to build up through the diode Db to the 
DC link. The terminal voltages of primary and secondary windings of the transformer 
are the DC-link voltage uCr and the supply voltage Vs, respectively. Capacitor Cr resonates 
with the transformer, and the DC-link voltage uCr is decreased. Neglecting the resistances 
of windings, using the transformer equivalent circuit (referred to as the primary side), the 
transformer currents iLr and iLrs and the DC-link voltage uCr obey the equation

Mode 3 (as shown in Figure 9.92d) t2 < t < t3: The DC-link voltage uCr is zero. The main 
switches of the inverter can now be either turned on or turned off under the ZVS condition 
during this mode. The load current flows through the freewheeling diode D.
Mode 4 (as shown in Figure 9.92e) t3 < t < t4: As the main switches have turned on or turned 
off, the auxiliary switch Sb is turned on with ZCS condition (as the iLrs cannot suddenly 
change due to the transformer inductance) and the transformer secondary current iLrs starts 
to build up linearly. The transformer primary current iLr also begins to conduct through

load current is slowly diverted from the freewheeling diodes to the resonant circuit. The 
DC-link voltage uCr is still equal to zero before the transformer primary current is greater 
than the load current. The terminal voltages of the transformer primary and secondary 
windings are equal to zero and the DC power supply voltage Vs, respectively. Redefining

At t4, iLr equals the negative load current −IO and the current through the diode D becomes 
zero. Thus, the freewheeling diode turns off under ZCS condition, and the diode reverse 
recovery problems are reduced.
Mode 5 (as shown in Figure 9.92f) t4  <  t  <  t5: The absolute value of iLr is continuously 
increased from IO, and uCr is increased from zero when the freewheeling diode D is turned

condition is uCr(0) = 0, iLr(0) = −IO; neglect the inductor resistance; solving the equation,

The interval is also independent of the load current. As mentioned earlier, n is a number 
slightly smaller than 2; therefore, the interval is also very short.
Mode 7 (as shown in Figure 9.92h) t6 < t < t7: The transformer primary winding current 
iLr decays linearly from the negative load current −IO to zero. Partial load current flows 
through the switch SL. The total current flowing through the switch SL and transformer is 
equal to the load current IO. Redefining the initial time, the transformer winding current 
obeys Equation 9.121 with the initial condition iLr(0) = −IO. The interval of this mode is

9.7.3.2  Design Consideration
It is assumed that the inductance of BDCM is much higher than the transformer leakage inductance. 
From the analysis presented previously, the design considerations can be summarized as follows. 
	
1.	Determine the value of the resonant capacitor Cr and the parameters of the transformer.
	
2.	Select the main switches and auxiliary switches.
	
3.	Design the gate signal for the auxiliary switches.
The turn ratio 1: n of the transformer can be determined ahead of time. From Equation 9.117, n must 
satisfy 
	
n < 2	
(9.124)
On the other hand, from Equations 9.111 and 9.112, it is expected that it is as close to 2 as possible so 
that the duration of mode 2 would not be very long and would be small enough at the end of mode 1.
Normally, n can be selected in the range of 1.7–1.9. The equivalent inductance of the transformer 
Lr = Ll1 + Ll2/n2 is inversely proportional to the rising rate of switch current when the auxiliary 
switches are turned on. This means that the equivalent inductance Lr should be big enough to limit 
the rising rate of the switch current to work in the ZCS condition. The selection of Lr can be refer-
enced from the rule depicted in reference.

where ton is the turn-on time of switch Sa and IOmax is the maximum load current. The resonant 
capacitance Cr is inversely proportional to the rising rate of switch voltage drop when the switch 
SL is turned off. This means that the capacitance is as high as possible to limit the rising rate of the 
voltage to work in ZVS condition. The selection of the resonant capacitor can be determined by

should be limited to twice the peak load current. From Equation 9.119, we obtain

For high switching frequency, Tw should be as short as possible. Select the equivalent inductance Lr

as possible. Lr and Cr selection area is illustrated in Figure 9.93 to determine their values; the valid

The main switches S1–S6 work under the ZVS condition; the voltage stress is equal to the DC 
power supply voltage Vs. The device current rate can be load current. The auxiliary switch SL works 
under the ZVS condition; its voltage and current stress are the same as that of the main switches.

double the maximum load current. As the auxiliary switches Sa and Sb carry the peak current only 
during switch transitions, they can be rated as lower continuous current rating.
The design of gate signal for the auxiliary switches can be referenced from Figure 9.91. The trail-
ing edge of the gate signal for the auxiliary switch SL is the same as that of the PWM; the leading 
edge is determined by the output of the DC-link voltage sensor. The gate signal for the auxiliary 
switch Sa is a positive pulse with a leading edge the same as that of the PWM trailing edge; its width 
ΔTa should be greater than Δt1. From Equation 9.110, Δt1 is maximum when the load current is zero. 
So ΔTa can be a fixed value determined by

9.7.3.3  Control Scheme
When the duty of PWM is 100%, that is, a full duty cycle, the main switches of the inverter work 
under commutation frequency. When it is the instant to commutate the phase current of the BDCM, 
we control the auxiliary switches Sa, Sb, and SL, and resonance occurs between the transformer 
inductor Lr and capacitor Cr. The DC-link voltage reaches zero temporarily; thus ZVS condition of 
the main switches is obtained. When the duty of PWM is less than 100%, the auxiliary switch SL 
works as a chopper. The main switches of the inverter do not switch within a PWM cycle when the 
phase current does not need to commutate. It has the benefit of reducing phase current drop when 
the PWM is off. The phase current is commutated when the DC-link voltage becomes zero. There 
is only one DC-link voltage notch per PWM cycle. It is very important, especially for a very low 
or very high duty of PWM. Otherwise, the interval between two voltage notches is very short, even 
overlapping, which will limit the tuning range.
The commutation logical circuit of the system is shown in Figure 9.94. It is similar to the conven-
tional BDCM commutation logical circuit except for adding six D flip-flops to the output. Thus the gate 
signal of the main switches is controlled by the synchronous pulse CK that will be mentioned later and 
the commutation can be synchronized with the auxiliary switches control circuit (shown in Figure 9.95). 
The operation of the inverter can be divided into PWM operation and full duty cycle operation.  
9.7.3.3.1  Full Duty Cycle Operation
When the duty of the PWM is 100%, that is, a full duty cycle, the whole ZVT process (modes 1 through 7) 
occurs when the phase current commutation is ongoing. The monostable flip-flop M3 will generate 
one narrow negative pulse. The width of the pulse ΔT3 is determined by (Δt1 + Δt2 + T′c), where T′c, 
is a constant considering the turn-on/off time of the main switches. If n is close to 2, Δt2 would be 
very short or uCr would be small enough at the end of mode 1; ΔT3 can be determined by

where Tc is a constant that is greater than T ′c. The data selector makes the output of monostable flip-
flop M3 active. The monostable flip-flop M1 generates a positive pulse when the trailing edge of the M3 
negative pulse is coming. The pulse is the gate signal for the auxiliary switch Sa and its width is ΔTa, 
which is determined by Inequality 9.132. The gate signal for switch SL is flopped to low at the same time. 

537
Multilevel and Soft-Switching DC/AC Inverters
Then mode 1 begins and the DC-link voltage is reduced to zero. Synchronous pulse CK is also gen-
erated by a monostable flip-flop M4, the pulse width ΔTd should be greater than maximum Δt1 (i.e., 
π√LrCr). If the D flip-flops are increasing edge active, then CK is connected to the negative output of 
the M4, otherwise CK is connected to the positive output. Thus the active edge of pulse CK is within 
mode 3 when the voltage of the DC link is zero and the main switches of the inverter get ZVS condi-
tion. The monostable flip-flop M2 generates a positive pulse when the leading edge of the negative 
pulse is coming. The pulse width of M2 is ΔTd, which is determined by Inequality 9.133. Then modes 
4 through 7 occur and the DC-link voltage is increased to that of the supply again. The leading edge of 
the gate signal for the switch SL is determined by the DC-link voltage sensor signal. In other words, in 
full cycle operation when the phase current commutation is ongoing, the resonant circuit generates a 
DC-link voltage notch to let the main switches of the inverter switch under the ZVS condition.

9.7.3.3.2  PWM Operation
In this operation, the data selector makes the PWM signal active. The auxiliary switch SL works as a 
chop, but the main switches of the inverter do not turn on or turn off within a single PWM cycle when 
the phase current does not need to commutate. The load current is commutated when the DC-link 
voltage becomes zero. (As the PWM cycle is very short, it does not affect the operation of the motor.)  
	
1.	When the PWM signal is flopped down, mode 1 begins, and the pulse signal for the switch 
Sa is generated by M1 and the gate signal for the switch SL is decreased to a low level. 
However, the voltage of the DC link does not increase until the PWM signal is flipped up. 
Pulse CK is also generated by M4 to let the active edge of CK get located in mode 3.
	
2.	When the PWM signal is flipped up, mode 4 begins, and the pulse signal for switch Sb is 
generated at the moment. Then, when the voltage of the DC link is increased to supply 
voltage Vs, the gate signal for switch SL is flipped to a high level.
Thus, only one ZVT occurs per PWM cycle: modes 1 and 2 for PWM turning-off, and modes 4 
through 7 for PWM turning-on. Moreover, the switching frequency would not be greater than the 
PWM frequency (Figure 9.96).

9.7.3.4  Simulation and Experimental Results
The proposed system is verified by PSim simulation software. The DC power supply voltage Vs is 
240 V; the maximum load current is 12 A. The transformer turn ratio n is 1:1.8; the leakage induc-
tances of the primary secondary windings are selected as 4 and 12.96 μH, respectively. So the 
equivalent transformer inductance Lr is about 8 μH. The resonant capacitance Cr is 0.1 μF. Switch 
Sa,b gate signal widths ΔTa and ΔTb are set as 3 and 6 μs, respectively. The narrow negative pulse 
width ΔT3 in a full duty cycle is set as 4.5 μs; the delay time for synchronous pulse CK is set as 
3.5 μs. The frequency of the PWM is 20 kHz. Waveforms of the DC-link voltage uCr, the transformer 
primary winding current iLr, the switch SL and diode DL currents iSL and iDL, PWM, and the auxil-
iary switch gate signal under low and high load currents are shown in Figure 9.97. The figure shows 
that the inverter worked well under various load currents. 
To verify the theoretical analysis and simulation results, the proposed soft-switching inverter 
was tested on an experimental prototype. The DC-link voltage is 240 V, the rated phase current 
is 10.8 A, and the switching frequency is 20 kHz. Select 50 A/1200 V BSM 35 GB 120 DN2 dual 
IGBT module as the main inverter switches S1–S6 and the auxiliary switch SL; another switch in the 
same module of SL can be adopted as the auxiliary switch Sa, and 30A/600 V IMBH30D-060 IGBT

can be adopted as the auxiliary switch Sb. With the datasheets of these switches and Equations 9.124 
through 9.127, the value of the capacitance and the parameter of the transformer can be determined. 
A polyester capacitor of 0.1 μF, 1000 V was adopted as the DC-link resonant capacitor Cr. A high 
magnetizing inductance transformer with turn ratio 1:1.8 was employed in the experiment. The 
equivalent inductance is about 8 μH under a short-circuit test. The switching frequency is 20 kHz. 
The monostable flip-flop is set up using IC 74LS123, a variable resistor, and a capacitor. The logical 
gate can be replaced by a programmable logical device to reduce the number of ICs. ΔTa, ΔTb, ΔTc, 
and ΔTd are set as 3 μs, 6 μs, 4.5 μs, and 3.5 μs, respectively.
The system is tested in light and heavy loads. The waveforms of DC-link voltage uCr and the 
transformer primary winding current iLr in low- and high-load currents are shown in Figure 9.97a 
and b, respectively. The transformer-based resonant DC-link inverter works well under various load 
currents. The waveforms of auxiliary switch SL voltage uSL and its current iSL are shown in Figure 
9.97c. There is little overlap between the switch SL voltage and its current during the switching under 
the soft-switching condition; so the switching power losses are low. The waveforms of resonant

10 Best Switching Angles 
to Obtain Lowest Total 
Harmonic Distortion for 
Multilevel DC/AC Inverters
The lowest total harmonic distortion (THD) of multilevel DC/AC inverters from 3- to 81-level is 
derived in this chapter. This kind of multilevel DC/AC inverters can be applied in renewable energy 
systems, electrical vehicles, and other industrial applications.
10.1  INTRODUCTION
Multilevel DC/AC inverters have various structures and many advantages. On the contrary, most 
existing inverters are unable to produce good output AC waveforms because of their poor THD, due 
to that each level switching angle is not carefully arranged. To gain good power quality, we have to 
carefully investigate the switching angle arrangement to obtain the lowest THD.
10.2  METHODS FOR DETERMINATION OF SWITCHING ANGLE
Switching angle is the moment of the level change. Referring to Figure 10.1, for an m-level (m is an 
odd number) waveform in the period 0°–90°, there are 2(m – 1) switching angles to be determined. 
We define those as α1, α2, … , αm−2, αm−1 by the time-sequence. Considering the sine wave is a sym-
metrical wave; the negative half-cycle is centrally symmetrical to its positive half-cycle; the wave 
of the second quarter period is mirror-symmetrical to its positive half-cycle; and the wave of the 
second quarter period is mirror-symmetrical to the wave of its first quadrant period; we define that 
the switching angles in the first quadrant period (i.e., 0°–90°) are main switching angles.
10.2.1  Main Switching Angles
For an m-level (m is an odd number) waveform, there are (m − 1)/2 main switching angles. Referring 
to Figure 10.1, we have relations in the following:

From the analysis, we need only determine the main switching angles. The other switch-

10.2.2  Equal-Phase Method
Equal-phase (EP) method is derived from the simplest idea to averagely distribute the switching 
angles in the area 0 − π. The main switching angles are determined by the formula:

10.2.3  Half-Equal-Phase Method
As the multilevel waveform determined by EP Method looks very narrow similar to a triangle 
waveform, another approach, called half-EP (HEP) method to arrange the main switching angles, 
can obtain the output waveform wider and better. The main switching angles are in the area 0 − π/2, 
which are determined by the following formula:

10.2.4  Half-Height Method
The above-mentioned two methods are able to arrange the main switching angles easily, but the 
output waveform is not a sine wave. According to the sine function, we established a new half-height 
(HH) method to determine the main switching angles. The idea is that when the function value 
increases to the HH of the level, the switch angle is set and thus better output waveform obtained. 
The main switching angles are determined by the formula:

10.2.5  Feed-Forward Method
By using the above-mentioned three methods, we can see that there are wider gaps between the 
positive half-cycle and the negative half-cycle. To reduce the gaps, we established another new 
method, the feed-forward method, to determine the main switching angles by the formula:

10.2.8  Total Harmonic Distortion of Using Different Methods
Comparisons on THD for each method are listed in Table 10.12.
10.3  BEST SWITCHING ANGLES
From Tables 10.1 to 10.12, we can see that THD is reduced when the number of level (m) of inverter 
increases and the HH method is better than other three methods. Hence, higher level of inverter will 
be considered to produce output with less harmonic content. We use MATLAB® software to search 
for the best switching angles in this section, and results (for m = 81) are shown in Table 10.13.

10.3.2  Analysis of the Results of Best Switching Angles Calculation
THD values obtained by using best switching angles from Table 10.13 are listed in the following.
From Table 10.14, the lowest THD value of a multilevel inverter with a level equaling or being 
below 81 is 0.99%. It can be easily observed that the differences between each adjacent level decrease 
gradually with the number of lever increasing. For example, the THD value is dropped by 12.54%

Best Switching Angles to Obtain Lowest THD for Multilevel DC/AC Inverters
when the number of level has been increased from 3 to 5. However, the THD value is dropped by 
only 0.02% when the number of level has been increased from 79 to 81. By applying MATLAB graph 
fitting tool, the relationship between lowest THD and number of level of inverter can be ­estimated as 
equation in the following:

11 Traditional AC/AC Converters
AC/AC conversion technology is an important subject area in research and industrial applications. 
In recent decades, the AC/AC conversion technique has been developed to a great extent. We can 
sort them into two parts. The converters developed in the last century can be called the traditional 
AC/AC converters that are introduced in the current chapter. The new technologies of AC/AC con-
version technology will be introduced in the next chapter.
11.1  INTRODUCTION
A power electronic AC/AC converter accepts electric power from one system and converts it for deliver-
ing it to another AC system with a different amplitude, frequency, and phase. They may be of single- or 
three-phase type depending on their power ratings. The AC/AC converters employed to vary the root 
mean square (rms) voltage across the load at constant frequency are known as AC voltage controllers or 
AC regulators. The voltage control is accomplished either by (i) phase control under natural commutation 
using pairs of Triacs, silicon controlled rectifier (SCRs), or thyristors; or by (ii) on/off control under forced 
commutation using fully controlled self-commutated switches such as gate turn-off thyristors, power 
bipolar transistors, insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs), MOS-controlled thyristors, and so on.
The AC/AC power converters in which the AC power at one frequency is directly converted to an AC 
power at another frequency without any intermediate DC conversion link are known as cycloconverters, 
the majority of which use naturally commutated SCRs for their operation when the maximum output 
­frequency is limited to a fraction of the input frequency. With the rapid advancement of fast acting fully 
controlled switches, the force-commutated cycloconverters or the recently developed matrix ­converters 
(MCs) with bidirectional on/off control switches provide independent control of the magnitude and 
­frequency of the generated output voltage as well as sinusoidal modulation of the output voltage and current.
Although typical applications of AC voltage controllers include lighting and heating control, 
online transformer tap changing, soft-starting, and speed control of pump and fan drives, the cyclo-
converters are used mainly for high-power low-speed large AC motor drives for application in 
cement kilns, rolling mills, and ship propellers. The power circuits, control methods, and the opera-
tion of the AC voltage controllers, cycloconverters, and MCs are introduced in this section. A brief 
review regarding their applications is also given.
The input voltage of a diode rectifier is an AC voltage, which can be single- or three-phase volt-
ages. They are usually a pure sinusoidal wave. For a single-phase input voltage, the input voltage 
can be expressed as

where:
vs is the instantaneous input voltage
Vm is its amplitude
Vrms is its rms value
Traditional AC/AC converters are sorted in three groups: 
•	 Voltage-regulation converters
•	 Cycloconverters
•	 MCs
Each group has single- and three-phase converters.

11.2  SINGLE-PHASE AC/AC VOLTAGE-REGULATION CONVERTERS
The basic power circuit of a single-phase AC/AC voltage converter, as shown in Figure 11.1a, is 
composed of a pair of SCRs connected back-to-back (also known as inverse-parallel or antipar-
allel) between the AC supply and the load. This connection provides a bidirectional full-wave 
symmetrical control, and the SCR pair can be replaced by a Triac in Figure 11.1b for low-power 
applications. Alternate arrangements are as shown in Figure 11.1c with two diodes and two SCRs 
to provide a common cathode connection for simplifying the gating circuit without needing isola-
tion, and in Figure 11.1d with one SCR and four diodes to reduce the device cost but with increased 
device conduction loss. An SCR and diode combination, known as a thyrode controller, as shown in 
Figure 11.1e, provides a unidirectional half-wave asymmetrical voltage control with device econ-
omy but introduces a DC component and more harmonics and, thus, is not very practical to use 
except for a very low power heating load.

Traditional AC/AC Converters
With phase control, the switches conduct the load current for a chosen period of each input cycle 
of voltage, and with on/off control, the switches connect the load either for a few cycles of input 
voltage and disconnect it for the next few cycles (integral cycle control) or the switches are turned 
on and off several times within alternate half-cycles of input voltage (AC chopper or pulse-width 
modulation (PWM) AC ­voltage controller).
11.2.1  Phase-Controlled Single-Phase AC/AC Voltage Controller
For a full-wave, symmetrical phase control, the SCRs T1 and T2 shown in Figure 11.1a are gated at 
α and π + α, respectively, from the zero crossing of the input voltage, and by varying α, the power 
flow to the load is controlled through voltage control in alternate half-cycles. As long as one SCR 
is carrying current, the other SCR remains reverse biased by the voltage drop across the conduct-
ing SCR. The principle of operation in each half-cycle is similar to that of the controlled half-wave 
rectifier, and one can use the same approach for the analysis of the circuit.
11.2.1.1  Operation with R Load
Figure 11.2 shows the typical voltage and current waveforms for the single-phase bidirectional 
phase-controlled AC voltage controller of Figure 11.1a with resistive load. The output voltage and 
current waveforms have half-wave symmetry and thus no DC component.

The fundamental harmonic wave is delayed to the supply voltage by the firing angle α = 60°. 
Therefore, DPF = cosα = 0.5.
From this example, we can recognize the fact that if the firing angle is greater than 90°, it is 
possible to obtain leading power factor (PF).
11.2.1.2  Operation with RL Load
Figure 11.3 shows the voltage and current waveforms for the controller in Figure 11.1a with RL load. 
Due to the inductance, the current carried by the SCR T1 may not fall to zero at ωt = π when the input 
voltage goes negative, and may continue until ωt = β, the extinction angle, as shown in Figure 11.3.

of the SCR depends on the firing delay angle α and the load impedance angle ϕ. The expression for 
the load current IO(ωt) when conducting from α to β can be derived in the same way as that used 
for a phase-controlled rectifier in a discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) by solving the relevant 
Kirchhoff voltage equation:

The angle β, when the current IO falls to zero, can be determined from the following transcendental 
equation obtained by inserting iO(ωt = β) = 0 in Equation 11.7:

the rms value of the current decreases. The rms output voltage is

The fundamental harmonic wave is delayed to the supply voltage by the firing angle α = 60°. 
Therefore, the DPF is given by the equation DPF = cosα = 0.5.
11.2.1.3  Gating Signal Requirements
For the inverse-parallel SCRs as shown in Figure 11.1a, the gating signals of SCRs must be ­isolated 
from one another as there is no common cathode. For R load, each SCR stops conducting at the end 
of each half-cycle, and under this condition, single short pulses may be used for gating as shown in 
Figure 11.2. With RL load, however, this single short pulse gating is not suitable as shown in Figure 11.6. 
When SCR T2 is triggered at ωt = π + α, SCR T1 is still conducting due to the load inductance. By 
the time the SCR T1 stops conducting at β, the gate pulse for SCR T2 has already ceased and T2 will 
fail to turn on, causing the converter to operate as a single-phase rectifier with conduction of only T1. 
This necessitates the application of a sustained gate pulse either in the form of a continuous signal 
for the half-cycle period, which increases the dissipation in the SCR gate circuit and a large isolating 
pulse transformer, or better, a train of pulses (carrier frequency gating) to overcome these difficulties.

As the conduction angle θ cannot exceed π and the load current must pass through zero, the control 
range of the firing angle is ϕ ≤ α ≤ π. With narrow gating pulses and α ≤ ϕ, only one SCR will 
conduct, resulting in a rectifier action as shown. Even with a train of pulses, if α < ϕ, the changes 
in the firing angle will not change the output voltage and current, but both SCRs will conduct for 
the period π with T1 turning on at ωt = π and T2 at ωt + π. This dead zone (α = 0 to ϕ), the duration 
of which varies with the load impedance angle ϕ, is not a desirable feature in closed-loop control 
schemes. An alternative approach to the phase control with respect to the input voltage zero crossing 
has been reported in which the firing angle is defined with respect to the instant when it is the load 
current (not the input voltage) that reaches zero, this angle being called the hold-off angle (γ) or the 
control angle (as marked in Figure 11.3). This method requires sensing the load current, which may 
otherwise be required anyway in a closed-loop controller for monitoring or control purposes.
11.2.1.5  Power Factor and Harmonics
As in the case of phase-controlled rectifiers, the important limitations of the phase-controlled AC 
voltage controllers are the poor PF and the introduction of harmonics in the source currents. As seen 
from Equation 11.3, the input PF depends on α, and as α increases, the PF decreases.
The harmonic distortion increases and the quality of the input current decreases with an increase 
of the firing angle. The variations of low-order harmonics with the firing angle as computed by 
Fourier analysis of the voltage waveform of Figure 11.2 (with R load) are shown in Figure 11.7. Only 
odd harmonics exist in the input current because of half-wave symmetry.

As an alternative to the phase control, the method of integral cycle control or burst firing is used for

time tm with m integral cycles (Figure 11.8). As the SCRs or Triacs used here are turned on at the 
zero crossing of the input voltage and turn off occurs at zero current, supply harmonics, and radio-
frequency interference are very low.

However, subharmonic frequency components may be generated that are undesirable as they

11.2.2.2  PWM AC Chopper
As in the case of the controlled rectifier, the performance of AC voltage controllers can be improved 
in terms of harmonics, quality of output current, and input PF by PWM control in PWM AC chop-
pers. The circuit configuration of one such a single-phase unit is shown in Figure 11.9.
Here, fully controlled switches S1 and S2 connected in antiparallel are turned on and off many 
times during the positive and negative half-cycles of the input voltage, respectively; S1 and S2 pro-
vide the freewheeling paths for the load current when S1 and S2 are off. An input capacitor filter may 
be provided to attenuate the high switching frequency current drawn from the supply and also to 
improve the input PF. Figure 11.10 shows the typical output voltage and load-current waveform for

a single-phase PWM AC chopper. It can be shown that the control characteristics of an AC chop-
per depend on the modulation index k, which theoretically varies from zero to unity. The relation 
between input and output voltages is expressed in Equation 11.16, and the PF is calculated by using 
Equation 11.17. Applying a low-pass filter in the output side of a PWM AC chopper, a good sine 
wave can be obtained.

Analogously, a three-phase PWM chopper consists of three single-phase choppers that are either 
delta connected or four-wire star connected.
11.3  THREE-PHASE AC/AC VOLTAGE-REGULATION CONVERTERS
Three-phase AC/AC voltage controllers have various circuits and configurations.
11.3.1  Phase-Controlled Three-Phase AC Voltage Controllers
Several possible circuit configurations for three-phase phase-controlled AC regulators with star- or 
delta-connected loads are shown in Figure 11.11a–h. The configurations in Figure 11.11a and b can 
be realized by three single-phase AC regulators operating independently of each other, and they 
are easy to analyze. In Figure 11.11a, the SCRs should be rated to carry line currents and withstand 
phase voltages, whereas in Figure 11.11b they should be capable of carrying phase currents and 
withstanding the line voltages. Moreover, in Figure 11.11b the line currents are free from triplen 
harmonics, whereas these are present in the closed delta. The PF in Figure 11.11b is slightly higher. 
The firing angle control range for both these circuits is 0°–180° for R load.
The circuits in Figure 11.11c and d are three-phase three-wire circuits and are difficult to ana-
lyze. In both these circuits, at least two SCRs (one in each phase) must be gated simultaneously to

Traditional AC/AC Converters
cause the controller to start by establishing a current path between the supply lines. This necessi-
tates two firing pulses spaced at 60° apart per cycle for firing each SCR. The operation modes are 
defined by the number of SCRs conducting in these modes. The firing control range is 0°–150°. The 
triplen harmonics are absent in both these configurations.
Another configuration is shown in Figure 11.11e when the controllers are delta connected and the 
load is connected between the supply and the converter. Here, current can flow between two lines 
even if one SCR is conducting, so each SCR requires one firing pulse per cycle. The voltage and 
current ratings of SCRs are nearly the same as those of the circuit in Figure 11.11b. It is also possible 
to reduce the number of devices to three SCRs in delta, as shown in Figure 11.11f, by connecting 
one source terminal directly to one load circuit terminal. Each SCR is provided with gate pulses in 
each cycle spaced 120° apart. In Figure 11.11e and f, each end of each phase must be accessible. The 
number of devices in Figure 11.11f is lower, but their current ratings must be higher.
As in the case of the single-phase phase-controlled voltage regulator, the total regulator cost can 
be reduced by replacing six SCRs by three SCRs and three diodes, resulting in three-phase half-
wave controlled unidirectional AC regulators, as shown in Figure 11.11g and h for star- and delta-
connected loads. The main drawback of these circuits is the large harmonic content in the output 
voltage, particularly the second harmonic, because of the asymmetry. However, the DC components 
are absent in the line. The maximum firing angle in the half-wave controlled regulator is 210°.
11.3.2  Fully Controlled Three-Phase Three-Wire AC Voltage Controller
11.3.2.1  Star-Connected Load with Isolated Neutral
The analysis of the operation of the full-wave controller with isolated neutral as shown in Figure 11.11c 
is, as mentioned, quite complicated in comparison with that of a single-phase controller, particularly 
for an RL or motor load. As a simple example, the operation of this controller is considered here 
with a simple star-connected R load. The six SCRs are turned on in the sequence 1–2–3–4–5–6 at 
60° intervals, and the gate signals are sustained throughout the possible conduction angle.
The output phase voltage waveforms for α = 30°, 75°, and 120° for a balanced three-phase R load 
are shown in Figure 11.12. At any interval, either three SCRs or two SCRs or no SCRs may be on, 
and the instantaneous output voltages to the load are either line-to-neutral voltages (three SCRs on) 
or one-half of the line-to-line voltage (two SCRs on) or zero (no SCR on).
Depending on the firing angle a, there may be three operating modes. 
Mode I (also known as Mode 2/3): 0 < α < 60°. There are periods when three SCRs are 
conducting, one in each phase for either direction and periods when just two SCRs are 
conducting.
For example, with α = 30° in Figure 11.12a, assume that at ωt = 0, SCRs T5 and T6 are conduct-
ing, and the current through the R load in a three-phase is zero, making van = 0. At ωt = 30°, T1 
receives a gate pulse and starts conducting; T5 and T6 remain on and van = vAN. The current in T5 
reaches zero at 60°, turning T5 off. With T1 and T6 staying on, van = (1/2)vAB. At 90°, T2 is turned 
on, the three SCRs T1, T2, and T6 are then conducting and van = vAN. At 120°, T6 turns off, leav-
ing T1 and T2 on, so van = (l/2)vAC. Thus with the progress of firing in sequence until α = 60°, the 
number of SCRs conducting at a particular instant alternates between two and three.
Mode II (also known as Mode 2/2): 60° < α < 90°. Two SCRs, one in each phase, always 
conduct.
For α = 75° as shown in Figure 11.12b, just prior to α = 75°, SCRs T5 and T6 were conducting and 
van = 0. At 75°, T1 is turned on; T6 continues to conduct, whereas T5 turns off as vCN is negative; 
van = (1/2)vAB. When T2 is turned on at 135°, T6 is turned off and van = (1/2)vAC. The next SCR 
to turn on is T3, which turns off T1 and van = 0. One SCR is always turned off when another is 
turned on in this range of a and the output is either one-half line-to-line voltage or zero.

590
Power Electronics
Mode III (also known as Mode 0/2): 90° < α < 150°. When none or two SCRs conduct.
For α = 120° (Figure 11.12c), earlier no SCRs were on and van = 0. At α = 120°, SCR T1 is given 
a gate signal whereas T6 has a gate signal already applied. As vAB is positive, T1 and T6 are 
forward biased, and they begin to conduct and van = (1/2)vAB. Both T1 and T6 turn off when 
vAB becomes negative. When a gate signal is given to T2, it turns on, and T1 turns on again.
For α > 150°, there is no period when two SCRs are conducting, and the output voltage is zero 
at α = 150°. Thus, the range of the firing angle control is 0 ≤ α ≤ 150°.

The control characteristics for these two limiting cases (ϕ = 0 for R load and ϕ = 90° for L load)

11.3.2.2  RL Load
The analysis of the three-phase voltage controller with star-connected RL load with isolated neutral is 
quite complicated as the SCRs do not cease to conduct at voltage zero, and the extinction angle β is to 
be found out by solving the transcendental equation for the case. The Mode II operation, in this case, 
disappears and the operation shift from Modes I to III depends on the so-called critical angle αcrit, 
which can be evaluated from a numerical solution of the relevant transcendental equations. Computer 
simulation either by PSpice program or a switching-variable approach coupled with an iterative pro-
cedure is a practical means of obtaining the output voltage waveform in this case. Figure 11.14 shows 
typical simulation results, using the latter approach for a three-phase voltage-controller-fed RL load 
for α = 60°, 90°, and 105°, which agree with the corresponding practical oscillograms given.
11.3.2.3  Delta-Connected R Load
The configuration is shown in Figure 11.11b. The voltage across an R load is the corresponding line-
to-line voltage when one SCR in that phase is on. Figure 11.15 shows the line and phase currents

The line currents depend on the firing angle and may be discontinuous as shown. Due to the delta

11.4  CYCLOCONVERTERS
In contrast to the AC voltage controllers operating at constant frequency discussed so far, a cyclo-
converter operates as a direct AC/AC frequency changer with an inherent voltage control feature. 
The basic principle of this converter to construct an alternating voltage wave of lower frequency 
from successive segments of voltage waves of higher frequency AC supply by a switching arrange-
ment was conceived and patented in the 1920s. Grid-controlled mercury-arc rectifiers were used in 
these converters installed in Germany in the 1930s to obtain 16 23 Hz single-phase supply for AC 
series traction motors from a three-phase 50 Hz system, whereas, at the same time, a cycloconverter 
using 18 thyratrons supplying a 400-hp synchronous motor was in operation for some years as a 
power station auxiliary drive in the United States. However, the practical and commercial utiliza-
tion of these schemes did not take place until the SCRs became available in the 1960s. With the 
development of large power SCRs and microprocessor-based control, the cycloconverter today is a 
mature practical converter for application in large-power low-speed variable-voltage variable-fre-
quency AC drives in cement and steel rolling mills as well as in variable-speed constant-frequency 
systems in aircraft and naval ships.
A cycloconverter is a naturally commuted converter with the inherent capability of bidirectional 
power flow, and there is no real limitation on its size unlike an SCR inverter with commutation 
elements. Here, the switching losses are considerably low, the regenerative operation at full power 
over the complete speed range is inherent, and it delivers a nearly sinusoidal waveform resulting in 
minimum torque pulsation and harmonic heating effects. It is capable of operating even with the 
blowing out of an individual SCR fuse (unlike the inverter), and the requirements regarding turn-off 
time, current rise time, and dv/dt sensitivity of SCRs are low. The main limitations of a naturally 
commutated cycloconverter (NCC) are (1) limited frequency range for subharmonic-free and effi-
cient operation and (2) poor input displacement/power factor, particularly at low output voltages.
11.4.1  Single-Phase/Single-Phase (Single-Phase Input 
to Single-Phase Output) Cycloconverters
Although rarely used, the operation of a single-phase input to single-phase output (SISO) cyclocon-
verter is useful to demonstrate the basic principle involved. Figure 11.16a shows the power circuit 
of a single-phase bridge-type cycloconverter, which has the same arrangement as that of the dual 
converter.
The firing angles of the individual two-pulse two-quadrant bridge converters are continuously 
modulated here so that each ideally produces the same fundamental AC voltage at its output termi-
nals as marked in the simplified equivalent circuit in Figure 11.16b. On account of the unidirectional 
current-carrying property of the individual converters, it is inherent that the positive half-cycle of the 
current is carried by the P-converter and the negative half-cycle of the current by the N-converter, 
regardless of the phase of the current with respect to the voltage. This means that for a reactive load, 
each converter operates in both the rectifying and inverting region during the period of the associ-
ated half-cycle of the low-frequency output current.
11.4.1.1  Operation with R Load
Figure 11.17 shows the input and output voltage waveforms with a pure R load for a 50 to 16 2
3 Hz 
cycloconverter. The P- and N-converters operate for all alternate TO /2 periods. The output fre-
quency (1/TO) can be varied by varying TO, and the voltage magnitude by varying the firing angle α 
of the SCRs. As shown in the figure, three cycles of the AC input wave are combined to produce one 
cycle of the output frequency to reduce the supply frequency to one-third across the load.
For example, the waveforms of a SISO AC/AC cycloconverter with TO  =  3Ts are shown in 
Figure 11.17. The firing angle α is listed in Tables 11.1 and 11.2 (the blank means no-firing pulse 
applied).

If αP is the firing angle of the P-converter, then the firing angle of the N-converter αN is π – αP, 
and the average voltage of the P-converter is equal to and opposite of that of the N-converter. 
The inspection of the waveform with α remaining fixed in each half-cycle generates a square 
wave having a large low-order harmonic content. A near approximation to sine wave can be 
synthesized by a phase modulation of the firing angles as shown in Figure 11.18 for a 50–10 Hz 
cycloconverter. The harmonics in the load-voltage waveform are fewer when compared with the 
earlier waveform. The supply current, however, contains a subharmonic at the output frequency 
for this case as shown.
Example 11.5
Consider a full-wave SISO AC/AC cycloconverter. The input rms voltage Vs = 140 V/50 Hz and the 
output voltage VO = 90 V/ 16
Hz
23
, and the load is a resistance R with a low-pass filter. Assuming 
that the filter is appropriately designed, only the fundamental component (fO = 16
Hz
23
) remains 
in the output voltage. Tabulate the firing angle (α in the period Ts = 1/fs = 20 ms) of both rectifiers’ 
SCRs in a full period TO = 1/fO = 60 ms, and calculate the phase-angle shift σ in the input voltage 
over the period Ts = 1/fs.

11.4.1.2  Operation with RL Load
The cycloconverter is capable of supplying the loads of any PF. Figure 11.19 shows the idealized out-
put voltage and current waveforms for a lagging-power-factor load in which both the converters are 
operating as rectifiers and inverters at the intervals marked. The load-current lags the output voltage, 
and the load-current direction determines which converter is conducting. Each converter continues 
to conduct after its output voltage changes polarity, and during this period, the converter acts as an 
inverter and the power is returned to the AC source. The inverter operation continues until the other 

599
Traditional AC/AC Converters
converter starts to conduct. By controlling the frequency of oscillation and the depth of modulation 
of the firing angles of the converters (as will be shown later), it is possible to control the frequency 
and the amplitude of the output voltage.
The load current with RL load may be continuous or discontinuous depending on the load phase 
angle ϕ. At light load inductance or for ϕ ≤ α ≤ π, there may be discontinuous load current with 
short zero-voltage periods. The current wave may contain even harmonics as well as subharmonic 
components. Further, as in the case of a dual converter, although the mean output voltages of the 
two converters are equal and opposite, the instantaneous values may be unequal, and a circulating 
current can flow within the converters. This circulating current can be limited by having a center-
tapped reactor connected between the converters or can be completely eliminated by logical control 
similar to the dual converter case in which the gate pulses to the idle converter are suppressed when 
the other converter is active. A zero current interval of short duration is needed between the P- and 
N-converters to ensure that the supply lines of the two converters are not short-circuited.
For the circulating-current scheme, the converters are kept in virtually continuous conduction 
over the whole range and the control circuit is simple. To obtain a reasonably good sinusoidal volt-
age waveform using the line-commutated two-quadrant converters and to eliminate the possibility 
of the short circuit of the supply voltages, the output frequency of the cycloconverter is limited to a 
much lower value of the supply frequency. The output voltage waveform and the output frequency 
range can be improved further by using converters of higher pulse numbers.
11.4.2  Three-Phase Cycloconverters
Three-phase cycloconverters have several circuits. For example, there are the three-pulse cyclocon-
verters, 6-pulse cycloconverters, and 12-pulse cycloconverters.
11.4.2.1  Three-Phase Three-Pulse Cycloconverter
Figure 11.20a shows a schematic diagram of a three-phase half-wave (three-pulse) cycloconverter 
feeding a single-phase load, and Figure 11.20b shows the configuration of a three-phase half-wave 
(three-pulse) cycloconverter feeding a three-phase load. The basic process of a three-phase cyclo-
conversion is illustrated in Figure 11.20c at 15 Hz, 0.6 PF lagging load from a 50-Hz supply. As the 
firing angle α is cycled from 0° at “a” to 180° at “j,” half-a-cycle of output frequency is produced 
(the gating circuit is to be suitably designed to introduce this oscillation of the firing angle). For this 
load, it can be seen that although the mean output voltage reverses at X, the mean output current 
(assumed sinusoidal) remains positive until Y. During XY, the SCRs A, B, and C in the P-converter 
are inverting. A similar period exists at the end of the negative half-cycle of the output voltage when 
D, E, and F SCRs in the N-converter are inverting. Thus, the operation of the converter follows in

Traditional AC/AC Converters
the order of rectification and inversion in a cyclic manner, with the relative durations being depen-
dent on the load power factor. The output frequency is that of the firing angle oscillation, about a 
quiescent point of 90° (the condition when the mean output voltage, given by VO = VdO cosα, is zero). 
For obtaining the positive half-cycle of the voltage, firing angle α is varied from 90° to 0° and then 
to 90°, and for the negative half-cycle, from 90° to 180° and back to 90°. Variation of α within the 
limits of 180° automatically provides for natural line commutation of the SCRs. It is shown that a 
complete cycle of low-frequency output voltage is fabricated from the segments of the three-phase 
input voltage by using the phase-controlled converters. The P- or N-converter SCRs receive fir-
ing pulses that are timed such that each converter delivers the same mean output voltage. This is 
achieved, as in the case of the single-phase cycloconverter or the dual converter, by maintaining 
the firing angle constraints of the two groups as αP = (180° – αN). However, the instantaneous volt-
ages of two converters are not identical, and a large circulating current may result unless limited 
by an intergroup reactor as shown (circulating-current cycloconverter) or completely suppressed 
by removing the gate pulses from the nonconducting converter by an intergroup blanking logic 
(circulating-current-free cycloconverter).
11.4.2.1.1  Circulating-Current-Mode Operation
Figure 11.21 shows typical waveforms of a three-pulse cycloconverter operating with circulating 
current. Each converter conducts continuously with rectifying and inverting modes as shown, and 
the load is supplied with an average voltage of two converters reducing some of the ripple in the 
process, with the intergroup reactor behaving as a potential divider. The reactor limits the circulat-
ing current, with the value of its inductance to the flow of load current being one-fourth of its value 
to the flow of circulating current as the inductance is proportional to the square of the number of 
turns. The fundamental waves produced by both the converters are the same. The reactor voltage 
is the instantaneous difference between the converter voltages, and the time integral of this voltage 
divided by the inductance (assuming negligible circuit resistance) is the circulating current. For a 
three-pulse cycloconverter, it can be observed that this current reaches its peak value when αP = 60° 
and αN = 120°.
11.4.2.1.2  Output-Voltage Equation
A simple expression for the fundamental rms output voltage of the cycloconverter and the required 
variation of the firing angle α can be derived with the assumptions that (1) the firing angle α in suc-
cessive half-cycles is varied slowly resulting in a low-frequency output; (2) the source impedance 
and the commutation overlap are neglected; (3) the SCRs are ideal switches; and (4) the current is 
continuous and ripple-free. The average DC output voltage of a p-pulse dual converter with fixed α is

where r is the ratio (VO1,max/VdO max), called the voltage magnitude control ratio. Equation 11.38 
shows α as a nonlinear function of r (≤1) as shown in Figure 11.22.
However, the firing angle αP of the P-converter cannot be reduced to 0° as this corresponds 
to αN = 180° for the N-converter, which, in practice, cannot be achieved because of allowance 
for commutation overlap and finite turnoff time of the SCRs. Thus, the firing angle αP can be 
reduced to a certain finite value αmin, and the maximum output voltage is reduced by a factor 
cosαmin.

11.4.2.1.3  Circulating-Current-Free-Mode Operation
Figure 11.23 shows the typical waveforms for a three-pulse cycloconverter operating in this mode 
with RL load assuming continuous current operation. Depending on the load-current direction, 
only one converter operates at a time and the load voltage is the same as the output voltage of the 
conducting converter. As explained earlier, in the case of the single-phase cycloconverter, there is 
a possibility of a short circuit of the supply voltages at the crossover points of the converter unless 
care is taken in the control circuit. The waveforms drawn also neglect the effect of overlap due to 
the AC supply inductance. A reduction in the output voltage is possible by retarding the firing angle 
gradually at the points a, b, c, d, and e in Figure 11.23 (this can easily be implemented by reducing 
the magnitude of the reference voltage in the control circuit). The circulating current is completely 
suppressed by blocking all the SCRs in the converter that is not delivering the load current. A cur-
rent sensor is incorporated into each output phase of the cycloconverter that detects the direction of 
the output current and feeds an appropriate signal to the control circuit to inhibit or blank the gating 
pulses to the nonconducting converter in the same way as in the case of a dual converter for DC 
drives. The circulating-current-free operation improves the efficiency and the displacement factor 
of the cycloconverter and also increases the maximum usable output frequency. The load voltage 
transfers smoothly from one converter to the other.
11.4.2.2  Three-Phase 6-Pulse and 12-Pulse Cycloconverters
A six-pulse cycloconverter circuit configuration is shown in Figure 11.24. Typical load-voltage 
­waveforms for 6- (with 36  SCRs) and 12-pulse (with 72  SCRs) cycloconverters are shown in 
Figure 11.25. The 12-pulse converter is obtained by connecting two 6-pulse configurations in series 
and appropriate transformer connections for the required phase-shift. It may be seen that the higher 
pulse numbers will generate waveforms closer to the desired sinusoidal form and thus permit higher 
frequency output. The phase loads may be isolated from each other as shown or interconnected with 
suitable secondary winding connections.

11.4.3  Cycloconverter Control Scheme
Various possible control schemes (analog as well as digital) for deriving trigger signals for control-
ling the basic cycloconverter have been developed over the years.
Output of the several possible signal combinations: It has been shown that a sinusoidal reference 
signal (er = Er sinωOt) at desired output frequency fO and a cosine modulating signal (em = Em cosωit) 
at input frequency fi is the best combination possible for comparison to derive the trigger signals for 
the SCRs (Figure 11.26), which produces the output waveform with the lowest total harmonic dis-
tortion. The modulating voltages can be obtained as the phase-shifted voltages (B-phase voltage for

which shows that the amplitude, frequency, and phase of the output voltage can be controlled by 
controlling corresponding parameters of the reference voltage, thus making the transfer charac-
teristic of the cycloconverter linear. The derivation of the two complementary voltage waveforms 
for the P- or N-group converter blanks in this way is illustrated in Figure 11.28. The final cyclo-
converter output waveshape is composed of alternate half-cycle segments of the complementary 
P- and N-converter output voltage waveforms that coincide with the positive and negative current 
half-cycles, respectively.

Traditional AC/AC Converters
The synchronizing circuit produces the modulating voltages (ea = –Kvb, eb = –Kvc, ec = –Kva), 
synchronized with the mains through step-down transformers and proper filter circuits.
The reference source produces a variable-voltage variable-frequency reference signal (era, erb, erc) 
(three-phase for a three-phase cycloconverter) for comparison with the modulation voltages. Various 
ways (analog or digital) have been developed to implement this reference source as in the case of 
the PWM inverter. In one of the early analog schemes (Figure 11.30) for a three-phase cycloconver-
ter, a variable-frequency unijunction transistor relaxation oscillator of the frequency 6fd triggers 
a ring counter to produce a three-phase square-wave output of frequency (fd), which is used to 
modulate a single-phase fixed frequency (fc) variable amplitude sinusoidal voltage in a three-phase 
full-wave transistor chopper. The three-phase output contains (fc – fd), (fc + fd), (3fd + fc), and so 
forth, frequency components from where the wanted frequency component (fc – fd) is filtered out 
for each phase using a low-pass filter. For example, with fc = 500 Hz and the frequency of the relax-
ation oscillator varying between 2820 and 3180 Hz, a three-phase 0–30 Hz reference output can be 
obtained with the facility for phase sequence reversal.

Power Electronics
The logic and trigger circuit for each phase involves comparators for comparison of the reference 
and modulating voltages and inverters acting as buffer stages. The outputs of the comparators are 
used to clock the flip-flops or latches, outputs of which, in turn, feed the SCR gates through AND 
gates and pulse amplifying and isolation circuit. The second input to the AND gates is from the 
converter group selection and blanking circuit.
In the converter group selection and blanking circuit, the zero crossing of the current at the 
end of each half-cycle is detected and is used to regulate the control signals to either P- or N-group 
converters depending on whether the current goes to zero from negative to positive or positive 
to negative, respectively. However, in practice, the current that is discontinuous passes through 
multiple zero crossings while changing direction, which may lead to undesirable switching of the 
converters. Therefore, in addition to the current signal, the reference voltage signal is also used 
for the group selection, and a threshold band is introduced in the current signal detection to avoid 
inadvertent switching of the converters. Further, a delay circuit provides a blanking period of appro-
priate duration between the converter group switchings to avoid line-to-line short circuits. In some 
schemes, the delays are not introduced when a small circulating current is allowed during cross-
over instants limited by reactors of limited size, and this scheme operates in the so-called dual 
mode—­circulating current as well as circulating-current-free mode for minor and major portions 
of the output cycle, respectively. A different approach to the converter group selection, based on the

Traditional AC/AC Converters
closed-loop control of the output voltage in which a bias voltage is introduced between the voltage 
transfer characteristics of the converters to reduce the circulating current, is discussed.
11.4.3.2  Improved Control Schemes
With the development of microprocessors and PC-based systems, digital software control has taken 
over many tasks in modern cycloconverters, particularly in replacing the low-level reference wave-
form generation and analog signal comparison units. The reference waveforms can easily be gener-
ated in the computer, stored in the electrically programmable read only memory (EPROMs) and 
accessed under the control of a stored program and microprocessor clock oscillator. The analog 
signal voltages can be converted into digital signals by using analog-to-digital converters. The wave-
form comparison can then be made with the comparison features of the microprocessor system. 
The addition of time delays and intergroup blanking can also be achieved with digital techniques 
and computer software. A modification of the cosine firing control, using communication principles 
such as regular sampling in preference to the ­natural sampling of the reference waveform yielding a 
stepped sine wave before comparison with the cosine wave, has been shown to reduce the presence 
of subharmonics (to be discussed later) in the circulating-current cycloconverter and to facilitate 
microprocessor-based implementation, as in the case of PWM inverters.
11.4.4  Cycloconverter Harmonics and Input Current Waveform
The exact waveshape of the output voltage of the cycloconverter depends on (1) the pulse number of 
the converter, (2) the ratio of the output frequency to the input frequency (fO/fi), (3) the relative level 
of the output voltage, (4) load displacement angle, (5) circulating current or circulating-current-free 
operation, and (6) the method of control of the firing instants. The harmonic spectrum of a cyclocon-
verter output voltage is different from and more complex than that of a phase-controlled converter. It 
has been revealed that because of the continuous to-and-fro phase modulation of the converter firing 
angles, the harmonic distortion components (known as necessary distortion terms) have frequencies 
that are sums of, and differences between, multiples of output- and input-supply frequencies.
11.4.4.1  Circulating-Current-Free Operations
A derived general expression for the output voltage of a cycloconverter with circulating current-
free operation shows the following spectrum of harmonic frequencies for the 3-pulse, 6-pulse, and 
12-pulse cycloconverters employing the cosine modulation technique:

where k is any integer from unity to infinity, and n is any integer from zero to infinity. It may be 
observed that for certain ratios of fO/fi, the order of harmonics may be less than or equal to the 
desired output frequency. All such harmonics are known as subharmonics as they are not higher 
multiples of the input frequency. These subharmonics may have considerable amplitudes (e.g., with 
a 50-Hz input frequency and a 35-Hz output frequency, a subharmonic of frequency 3 × 50 to 
4 × 35 = 10 Hz is produced, the magnitude of which is 12.5% of that of the 35-Hz component) and 
are difficult to filter and thus are objectionable. Their spectrum increases with an increase of the 
ratio fO/fi and thus limits its value at which a tolerable waveform can be generated.
11.4.4.2  Circulating-Current Operation
For circulating-current operation with continuous current, the harmonic spectrum in the output 
voltage is the same as that of the circulating-current-free operation except that each harmonic fam-
ily now terminates at a definite term, rather than having an infinite number of components. They are

(11.42)
The amplitude of each harmonic component is a function of the output voltage ratio for the circu-
lating-current cycloconverter and the output voltage ratio as well as the load displacement angle for 
the circulating-current-free mode.
From the point of view of maximum useful attainable output-to-input frequency ratio (fO/fi) 
with the minimum amplitude of objectionable harmonic components, a guideline is available for 
it as 0.33, 0.5, and 0.75 for the 3-, 6-, and 12-pulse cycloconverters, respectively. However, with a 
modification of the cosine wave modulation timings such as regular sampling in the case of only 
circulating-current cycloconverters and using a subharmonic detection and feedback control con-
cept for both the circulating-current and circulating-current-free cases, the subharmonics can be 
suppressed and the useful frequency range for the NCCs can be increased.
11.4.4.3  Other Harmonic Distortion Terms
Besides the harmonics mentioned, other harmonic distortion terms consisting of frequencies of 
integral multiples of desired output frequency appear if the transfer characteristic between the out-
put and reference voltages is not linear. These are called unnecessary distortion terms, which are 
absent when the output frequencies are much less than the input frequency. Further, some practical 
distortion terms may appear due to practical nonlinearities and imperfections in the control circuits 
of the cycloconverter, particularly at relatively lower levels of output voltages.
11.4.4.4  Input Current Waveform
Although the load current, particularly for higher pulse cycloconverters, can be assumed to be sinusoi-
dal, the input current is more complex as it is made up of pulses. Assuming the cycloconverter to be an 
ideal switching circuit without losses, it can be shown from the instantaneous power balance equation 
that in a cycloconverter supplying a single-phase load, the input current has harmonic components 
of frequencies (f1 ± 2fO), called characteristic harmonic frequencies, which are independent of the 
pulse number, and they result in an oscillatory power transmittal to the AC supply system. In the case 
of a cycloconverter feeding a balanced three-phase load, the net instantaneous power is the sum of 
the three oscillating instantaneous powers when the resultant power is constant and the net harmonic 
component is greatly reduced when compared with that of the single-phase load case. In general, the 
total rms value of the input current waveform consists of three components: in-phase, quadrature, and 
harmonic. The in-phase component depends on the active power output, whereas the quadrature com-
ponent depends on the net average of the oscillatory firing angle and is always lagging.
11.4.5  Cycloconverter Input Displacement/Power Factor
The input-supply performances of a cycloconverter such as displacement factor or fundamental 
power factor, input power factor, and the input current distortion factor are defined similarly to those 
of the phase-controlled converter. The harmonic factor for the case of a cycloconverter is relatively 
complex as the harmonic frequencies are not simple multiples of the input frequency but are sums 
of, and differences between, multiples of output and input frequencies.
Irrespective of the nature of the load, leading, lagging, or unity power factor, the cycloconverter 
requires reactive power decided by the average firing angle. At low-output voltage, the average 
phase displacement between the input current and the voltage is large and the cycloconverter has a 
low input displacement and power factor. Besides the load displacement factor and output voltage 

611
Traditional AC/AC Converters
ratio, another component of the reactive current arises due to the modulation of the firing angle in 
the fabrication process of the output voltage. In a phase-controlled converter supplying DC load, the 
maximum displacement factor is unity for maximum DC output voltage. However, in the case of 
the cycloconverter, the maximum input displacement factor (IDF) is 0.843 with unity power factor 
load. The displacement factor decreases with reduction in the output voltage ratio. The distortion 
factor of the input current is given by (I1/I), which is always less than unity, and the resultant power 
factor (=distortion factor × displacement factor) is thus much lower (around 0.76 at the maximum) 
than the displacement factor, which is a serious disadvantage of the NCC.
11.4.6  Effect of Source Impedance
The source inductance introduces commutation overlap and affects the external characteristics of 
a cycloconverter similar to the case of a phase-controlled converter with DC output. It introduces 
delay in the transfer of current from one SCR to another and results in a voltage loss at the output 
and a modified harmonic distortion. At the input, the source impedance causes rounding off of the 
steep edges of the input current waveforms, resulting in a reduction of the amplitudes of higher 
order harmonic terms as well as a decrease in the IDF.
11.4.7  Simulation Analysis of Cycloconverter Performance
The nonlinearity and discrete time nature of practical cycloconverter systems, particularly for dis-
continuous current conditions, make an exact analysis quite complex, and a valuable design and 
analytical tool is digital computer simulation of the system. Two general methods of computer simu-
lation of the cycloconverter waveforms for RL and induction motor loads with circulating-current 
and circulating-current-free operation have been suggested; one of the methods is the crossover 
point method, which is very fast and convenient. This method gives the crossover points (intersec-
tions of the modulating and reference waveforms) and the conducting phase numbers for both P- and 
N-converters from which the output waveforms for a particular load can be digitally computed at 
any interval of time for a practical cycloconverter.
11.4.8  Forced-Commutated Cycloconverter
The NCC with SCRs as devices, discussed so far, is sometimes referred to as a restricted frequency 
changer as, in view of the allowance for the output voltage quality ratings, the maximum output 
voltage frequency is restricted ( fO << fi), as mentioned earlier. With devices replaced by fully con-
trolled switches such as forced-commutated SCRs, power transistors, IGBTs, gate turn-off thyris-
tors, and so on, an FCC can be built in which the desired output frequency is given by fO = |fs – fi|, in 
which fs is the switching frequency, which may be larger or smaller than fi. In the case when fO ≥ fi, 
the converter is called an unrestricted frequency changer (UFC), and when fO ≤ fi, the converter is 
called a slow switching frequency changer. The early FCC structures have been treated comprehen-
sively. It has been shown that in contrast to the NCC, in which the IDF is always lagging, in the 
UFC, the IDF is leading when the load displacement factor is lagging and vice versa, and in slow 
switching frequency changer, the IDF is identical to that of the load. Further, with proper control in 
an FCC, the IDF can be made either unity [unity displacement factor free cycloconverter (UDFFC)] 
with a concurrent composite voltage waveform, or controllable [controllable displacement factor 
free cycloconverter (CDFFC)] in which P- and N-converter voltage segments can be shifted relative 
to the output current wave for controlling the IDF continuously from lagging via unity to leading.
In addition to allowing bilateral power flow, UFCs offer an unlimited output frequency range 
and good input voltage utilization, do not generate input current and output voltage subharmonics, 
and require only nine bidirectional switches (Figure 11.31) for a three-phase to three-phase conver-
sion. The main disadvantage of the structures treated is that they generate large unwanted low-order 

612

input current and output voltage harmonics that are difficult to filter out, particularly for low-output 
voltage conditions. This problem has largely been solved with the introduction of an imaginative 
PWM voltage control scheme, which is the basis of a newly designated converter called the MC 
(also known as the PWM cycloconverter), which operates as a generalized solid-state transformer 
with significant improvement in voltage and input current waveforms, resulting in sine wave input 
and sine wave, as will be discussed in the next subsection.
11.5  MATRIX CONVERTERS
The MC is a development of the FCC based on bidirectional fully controlled switches, incorporating 
PWM voltage control, as mentioned earlier. This technique was developed by Venturine in 1980. 
With the initial progress reported, it has received considerable attention as it provides a good alter-
native to the double-sided PWM voltage source rectifier–inverter having the advantages of being a

Traditional AC/AC Converters
single-stage converter with only nine switches for three-phase to three-phase conversion and inherent 
bidirectional power flow, sinusoidal input/output waveforms with moderate switching frequency, the 
possibility of a compact design due to the absence of DC-link reactive components, and controllable 
input power factor independent of the output load current. The main disadvantages of the MCs devel-
oped so far are the inherent restriction of the voltage transfer ratio (0.866), a more complex control 
and protection strategy, and above all, the nonavailability of a fully controlled bidirectional high-
frequency switch integrated in a silicon chip (Triac, although bilateral, cannot be fully controlled).
The power circuit diagram of the most practical three-phase to three-phase (3ϕ–3ϕ) MC is shown 
in Figure 11.31a, which uses nine bidirectional switches so arranged that any of three input phases can 
be connected to any output phase as shown in the switching matrix symbol in Figure 11.31b. Thus, 
the voltage at any input terminal may be made to appear at any output terminal or terminals, whereas 
the current in any phase of the load may be drawn from any phase or phases of the input supply. For the 
switches, the inverse parallel combination of reverse-blocking self-controlled devices such as Power 
MOSFETs or IGBTs or transistor-embedded diode bridge as shown has been used so far. The circuit is 
called an MC as it provides exactly one switch for each of the possible connections between the input 
and the output. The switches should be controlled in such a way that at any point of time, one and only 
one of the three switches connected to an output phase must be closed to prevent short-circuiting of 
the supply lines or interrupting the load-current flow in an inductive load. With these constraints, it can 
be visualized that from the possible 512 (=29) states of the converter, only 27 switch combinations are 
allowed, as given in Table 11.3, which includes the resulting output line voltages and input phase cur-
rents. These combinations are divided into three groups. Group I consists of six combinations in which 
each output phase is connected to a different input phase. In Group II, there are three subgroups, each 
having six combinations with two output phases short-circuited (connected to the same input phase). 
Group III includes three combinations with all output phases short-circuited.
With a given set of input three-phase voltages, any desired set of three-phase output voltages can 
be synthesized by adopting a suitable switching strategy. However, it has been shown that regardless 
of the switching strategy, there are physical limits on the achievable output voltage with these con-
verters as the maximum peak-to-peak output voltage cannot be greater than the minimum voltage 
difference between two phases of the input.
To have complete control of the synthesized output voltage, the envelope of the three-phase 
reference or target voltages must be fully contained within the continuous envelope of the three-
phase input voltages. The initial strategy with the output frequency voltages as references reported 
the limit as 0.5 of the input, as shown in Figure 11.32a. This value can be increased to 0.866 by 
adding a third harmonic voltage of input frequency (Vi/4) cos 3ωit to all target output voltages and 
subtracting from them a third harmonic voltage of output frequency (VO/6) cos 3ωOt, as shown in 
Figure 11.32b. However, this process involves a considerable amount of additional computations in 
synthesizing the output voltages. The other alternative is to use the space vector modulation (SVM) 
strategy as used in PWM inverters without adding third harmonic components, but it also yields the 
maximum voltage transfer ratio as 0.866.
An AC input LC filter is used to eliminate the switching ripples generated in the converter, and 
the load is assumed to be sufficiently inductive to maintain the continuity of the output currents.
11.5.1  Operation and Control Methods of the Matrix Converter
The converter in Figure 11.31 connects any input phase (A, B, and C) to any output phase (a, b, 
and c) at any instant. When connected, the voltages van, vbn, and vcn at the output terminals are related 
to the input voltages VAO, VBO, and VCO as

Note that the matrix of the switching variables in Equation 11.44 is a transpose of the respective 
matrix in Equation 11.43. The MC should be controlled using a specific and appropriately timed 
sequence of the values of the switching variables, which will result in the balanced output voltages 
having the desired frequency and amplitude, whereas the input currents are balanced and in phase 
(for unity IDF) or at an arbitrary angle (for controllable IDF) with respect to the input voltages. As 
the MC, in theory, can operate at any frequency, at the output or input, including zero, it can be 
employed as a three-phase AC/DC converter, DC/three-phase AC converter, or even a buck–boost 
DC chopper, and thus as a universal power converter.
The control methods adopted so far for the MC are quite complex and are the subject of continu-
ing research. Of the methods proposed for independent control of the output voltages and input 
currents, two are in widespread use and will be reviewed briefly here. They are (1) the Venturini

method based on a mathematical approach of transfer function analysis; and (2) the SVM approach 
(as has been standardized now in the case of PWM control of the DC-link inverter).
11.5.1.1  Venturini Method
Given a set of three-phase input voltages with constant amplitude Vi and frequency fi = ωi/2π, this 
method calculates a switching function involving the duty cycles of each of the nine bidirectional 
switches and generates the three-phase output voltages by sequential piecewise sampling of the 
input waveforms. These output voltages follow a predetermined set of reference or target voltage 
waveforms and with a three-phase load connected, a set of input currents Ii, and angular frequency 
ωi, should be in phase for unity IDF or at a specific angle for controlled IDF.
A transfer function approach is employed to achieve the previously mentioned features by relat-
ing the input and output voltages and the output and input currents as

Traditional AC/AC Converters
The method developed as in the preceding is based on a direct transfer function approach using a 
single modulation matrix for the MC, employing the switching combinations of all three groups in 
Table 11.3. Another approach called the indirect transfer function approach considers the MC as 
a combination of a PWM voltage source rectifier and a PWM voltage source inverter and employs 
the already well-established voltage source rectifier and voltage source inverter PWM techniques 
for MC control, utilizing the switching combinations of only Groups II and III of Table 11.3. The 
drawback of this approach is that the IDF is limited to unity and the method also generates higher 
and fractional harmonic components in the input and output waveforms.
11.5.1.2  The Space Vector Modulation Method
The SVM is now a well-documented inverter PWM control technique that yields high voltage gain 
and less harmonic distortion compared with the other modulation techniques discussed earlier. 
Here, the three-phase input currents and output voltages are represented as space vectors, and the 
SVM is applied simultaneously to the output voltage and input current space vectors. Applications 
of the SVM algorithm to control MCs have appeared in the literature and have been shown to have 
the inherent capability to achieve full control of the instantaneous output voltage vector and the 
instantaneous current displacement angle even under supply voltage disturbances. The algorithm is 
based on the concept that the MC output line voltages for each switching combination can be repre-
sented as a voltage space vector denoted by

Of the three groups in Table 11.3, only the switching combinations of Groups II and III are employed 
for the SVM method. Group II consists of switching state voltage vectors having constant angular 
positions and are called active or stationary vectors. Each subgroup of Group II determines the 
position of the resulting output voltage space vector, and the six state space voltage vectors form a 
six-sextant hexagon used to synthesize the desired output voltage vector. Group III comprises the 
zero vectors positioned at the center of the output voltage hexagon, and these are suitably combined 
with the active vectors for the output voltage synthesis.
The modulation method involves selection of the vectors and their on-time computation. At each 
sampling period Ts, the algorithm selects four active vectors related to any possible combination of 
output voltage and input current sectors in addition to the zero vector to construct a desired refer-
ence voltage. The amplitude and the phase angle of the reference voltage vector are calculated, and 
the desired phase angle of the input current vector is determined in advance. For the computation 
of the on-time periods of the chosen vectors, these are combined into two sets leading to two new 
vectors adjacent to the reference voltage vector in the sextant and having the same direction as the 
reference voltage vector. Applying the standard SVM theory, the general formulae derived for the 
vector on-times, which satisfy, at the same time, the reference output voltage and input current dis-
placement angle, are

The integral value of the reference vector is calculated over one sample time interval as the sum of 
the products of the two adjacent vectors and their on-time ratios. The process is repeated at every 
sample instant.
11.5.1.3  Control Implementation and Comparison of the Two Methods
Both methods need a digital signal processor (DSP)-based system for their implementation. In one 
scheme for the Venturini method, the programmable timers, as available, are used to time out the 
PWM gating signals. The processor calculates the six-switch duty cycles in each sampling interval, 
converts them to integer counts, and stores them in the memory for the next sampling period. In the 
SVM method, an EPROM is used to store the selected sets of active and zero vectors, and the DSP 
calculates the on-times of the vectors. Then with an identical procedure as in the other method, the 
timers are loaded with the vector on-times to generate PWM waveforms through suitable output 
ports. The total computation time of the DSP for the SVM method has been found to be much less 
than that of the Venturini method. Comparison of the two schemes shows that while in the SVM 
method the switching losses are lower, the Venturini method shows better performance in terms of 
input current and output voltage harmonics.
11.5.2  Commutation and Protection Issues in a Matrix Converter
As the MC has no DC-link energy storage, any disturbance of the input-supply voltage will affect 
the output voltage immediately, and a proper protection mechanism has to be incorporated, particu-
larly against over voltage from the supply and over current in the load side. As mentioned, two types 
of bidirectional switch configurations have hitherto been used—one, the transistor (now IGBT) 
embedded in a diode bridge, and the other, the two IGBTs in antiparallel with reverse voltage block-
ing diodes (shown in Figure 11.31). In the latter configuration, each diode and IGBT combination 
operates in only two quadrants, which eliminates the circulating currents otherwise built up in the 
diode-bridge configuration that can be limited by only bulky commutation inductors in the lines.
The MC does not contain freewheeling diodes that usually achieve safe commutation in the case 
of other converters. To maintain the continuity of the output current as each switch turns off, the 
next switch in sequence must be immediately turned on. In practice, with bidirectional switches, a 
momentary short circuit may develop between the input phases when the switches crossover, and one 
solution is to use a semisoft current commutation using a multistepped switching procedure to ensure 
safe commutation. This method requires independent control of each two-quadrant switches, sensing 
the direction of the load current and introducing a delay during the change of switching states.
A clamp capacitor connected through two three-phase full-bridge diode rectifiers involving an 
additional 12 diodes (a new configuration with the number of additional diodes reduced to six using 
the antiparallel switch diodes has been reported) at the input and output lines of the MC serves as a 
voltage clamp for possible voltage spikes under normal and fault conditions.
A three-phase single-stage LC filter consisting of three capacitors in star and three inductors 
in the line is used to adequately attenuate the higher order harmonics and render sinusoidal input

current. Typical values of L and C based on a 415-V converter with a maximum line current of 6.5 A 
and a switching frequency of 20 kHz are 3 mH and 1.5 µF only. The filter may cause a minor phase 
shift in the input displacement angle that needs correction. Figure 11.33 shows typical experimental 
waveforms of the output line voltage and line current of an MC. The output-line current is mostly 
sinusoidal except for a small ripple when the switching frequency is around only 1 kHz.

nent (fO = 10 Hz) remains in the output voltage. Tabulate the firing angle (α in the period 
Ts = 1/fs = 20 ms) of the SCRs of both rectifiers in a full period TO = 1/fO = 100 ms, and 
calculate the phase-angle shift a in the input voltage over the period Ts = 1/fs.

12 Improved AC/AC Converters
Traditional methods of AC/AC converters have been introduced in Chapter 11. All those methods 
have some general drawbacks: 
	
1.	The output voltage is lower than the input voltage.
	
2.	The input-side total harmonic distortion (THD) is high.
	
3.	The output voltage frequency is lower than the input voltage frequency when voltage regu­lation 
and cycloconversion methods are used.
Some new methods to construct AC/AC converters can overcome the above-mentioned drawbacks. 
The following converters are introduced in this chapter: 
•	 DC-modulated single-phase single-stage AC/AC converters
•	 DC-modulated single-phase multistage AC/AC converters
•	 DC-modulated multiphase AC/AC converters
•	 Subenvelope modulation (SEM) method to reduce the THD for matrix AC/AC converters
12.1  DC-MODULATED SINGLE-PHASE SINGLE-STAGE AC/AC CONVERTERS
Single-stage AC/AC converters are the most popular structure widely used in various industrial appli-
cations. These AC/AC converters are traditionally implemented by the voltage regulation technique, 
cycloconverters, and matrix converters. However, they have high THD, low PF, and poor power transfer 
efficiency. A typical single-stage AC/AC converter implemented with voltage regulation technique and 
the corresponding waveforms are shown in Figure 12.1. The devices can be thyristors, insulated gate 
bipolar transistor (IGBTs), and metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFETs). For a 
clear example, MOSFETs are applied in the circuit with a pure resistive load R. The input voltage is

where:

where:
DPF = cos Φ1 is the displacement power factor
THD is the total harmonic distortion
The delay angle Φ1 is the phase delay angle of the fundamental harmonic component
For example, if the firing angle α is 30° (i.e., the fundamental harmonic phase angle Φ1 is 30°), the 
typical values are DPF = cos 30° = 0.866 and THD = 0.15 (or 15%). Therefore, PF = 0.856. The PF 
has a low value. The power vector diagram is shown in Figure 12.1c, in which P is the real power, 
jQ is the reactive power, and S is the apparent power.

Improved AC/AC Converters
DC/DC conversion technology can implement fast response and high efficiency. Our novel 
approach to power factor correction (PFC) is called DC-modulation power factor correction AC/
AC conversion. By using this technique, a high PF can be achieved. A DC-modulated single-stage 
buck-type AC/AC converter is shown in Figure 12.2. 
We assume that the input power supply rms voltage is 240 V with the frequency f = 50 Hz. 
The master switch SM and the slave switch Ss are bidirectional switches. They are working in the 
exclusive states. The DC-modulation switching frequency fm is usually high, say fm  =  20  kHz. 
Therefore, the input power supply voltage is a quasistatic DC voltage (positive or negative value) 
in a DC-modulation period Tm = 1/fm (50 µs). In a DC-modulation period Tm, the input voltage is a 
quasiconstant DC value. Therefore, the converter performs a DC/DC conversion. We can use all the 
conclusions on DC/DC conversion technology in this operation. The key device is the bidirectional 
exclusive switches SM–Ss (even more multi-bidirectional switches) for the DC-modulation operation. 
As the buck converter input current is a pulse train with the repeating frequency fm, a low-pass input 
filter Ls–Cs is required.
12.1.1  Bidirectional Exclusive Switches SM–Ss
The switching devices for bidirectional exclusive switches can be MOSFETs or IGBTs. MOSFETs 
were selected for our design. The bidirectional exclusive switches SM–Ss for the DC-modulation 
operation were designed, and they have the following technical features: 
	
1.	The master switch SM is controlled by a pulse-width modulation (PWM) pulse train, and 
it conducts the input current to flow in the forward direction in the positive input voltage. 
On the other hand, the SM conducts the input current to flow in the reverse direction in 
the negative input voltage.
	
2.	The slave switch Ss is conducted when the master switch SM is switched off exclusively. It 
is the freewheeling device to conduct the current to flow.
Figure 12.3 shows the circuit of the bidirectional exclusive switches SM–Ss for the DC-modulation 
operation. The switching control signal is a PWM pulse train that has an adjustable frequency 
fm and pulse width. The repeating period Tm = 1/fm and the conduction duty cycle k = (pulse 
width)/Tm. 
If some converters require more than one bidirectional exclusive slave switches, the con-
struction of the further Ss needs only to copy/repeat the existing one. If some converters require 
more than one bidirectional slave switches and one synchronously bidirectional slave switch, 
the construction of the synchronously bidirectional slave switch Ss–s needs only to copy/repeat 
the master switch SM. A group comprising a master switch SM with a synchronously bidirec-
tional slave switch Ss–s and two bidirectional exclusive slave switches Ss1 and Ss2 is shown in 
Figure 12.4.

The settling time from one steady state to another is about 2.4τ  =  0.000096  s  =  0.096  ms. 
This time period is much smaller than the power-supply period T = 1/f = 20 ms. The corre-
sponding radian distance is only 1.73°. The statistic average delay angle Φ1 is its 1/e time, that 
is, Φ1 = 0.24z/e = 0.0353 ms or 0.636°, and DPF = cos Φ1 = 0.999938. Consequently, we can 
assume that the output voltage can follow the input voltage waveform.
12.1.3  DC-Modulated Single-Stage Buck-Type AC/AC Converter
The DC-modulated single-stage buck-type AC/AC converter is shown in Figure 12.2. We have to 
investigate the operation during both positive and negative half-cycles of the input voltage.
12.1.3.1  Positive Input Voltage Half-Cycle
When the input voltage is positive, the buck converter operates in the usual manner. The equivalent 
circuits during the switch-on and switch-off periods are shown in Figure 12.5.

The whole-cycle input and output voltage waveforms are shown in Figure 12.7a with conduc-
tion duty cycle k = 0.75. The voltage transfer gain M = VO/Vs versus the DC/DC converter 
conduction duty cycle k is shown in Figure 12.7b. It is easy to obtain the variable output voltage 
with very high PF and high efficiency. 
The whole-cycle input voltage and current waveforms are shown in Figure 12.8a. The spectrum 
of the input current is shown in Figure 12.8b. The spectrum is very clean, and the little distortion 
from the harmonic component IM at 20 kHz is far from the fundamental frequency component Is at 
50 Hz. Its value is only 0.5%, that is, IM/Is = 0.005. Therefore, THD = 1.0000125. Considering that 
DPF = 0.9998, we obtain the final PF as 0.99979. 
12.1.3.4  Simulation and Experimental Results
The simulation and experimental results are shown in the following to verify the design.
12.1.3.4.1  Simulation Results
The DC-modulated buck-type AC/AC converter has the following components: Ls  =  1  mH, 
Cs = 10 µF, L = 10 mH, and C = 3 µF. The conduction duty cycle is selected as k = 0.75. The 
simulation results are shown in Figure 12.9. The output voltage VO = 0.75 × Vs = 150Vrms (the peak 
value is approximately 212 V) with the frequency f = 50 Hz. The waveforms of the input and output 
voltages vs(t) and vO(t) are shown as Channels 1 and 2 in Figure 12.9a. It can be seen that there is no

current IO should be 1 A and the output power PO = VO
2/R = 150 W.  
The input current is measured as Is = 0.95 A (the peak value is approximately 1.34 A) with the 
frequency f = 50 Hz. The waveforms of the input voltage vs(t) and current is(t) are shown as Channels 1 
and 2 in Figure 12.9b. It can be seen that there is almost no phase delay, although there may be about 
3.374° phase-angle delay from our analysis. The fast Fourier transform (FFT) spectrum of the input 
current is shown in Figure 12.9c, and THD = 0.015. The input power Pin = Vs × Is = 190 W. Although 
the theoretical analysis has no power losses for the ideal condition (η = 1), the particular test shows 
that there are power losses, which are mainly caused by the power losses of the switches. From the 
test results, we obtain the final PF as 0.9979 and the power-transfer efficiency η = Po/Pin190/200 = 
0.95 or 95%.
12.1.3.4.2  Experimental Results
The experimental results of the DC-modulated buck-type AC/AC converter are shown in 
Figure 12.10. 
Example 12.2
A buck-type DC-modulated AC/AC converter in Figure 12.2 has input rms voltage vs = 240 V and 
a dimmer load with R = 100 Ω. To adjust the light, the output rms voltage vO varies in the range of 
100–200 V. Calculate the range of the conduction duty cycle k and the output current and power.

12.1.4  DC-Modulated Single-Stage Boost-Type AC/AC Converter
The DC-modulated single-stage buck-type AC/AC converter can only convert an input voltage to a 
lower output voltage. For certain applications, the output voltage is required to be higher than the 
input voltage. For this purpose, the DC-modulated single-stage boost-type AC/AC converter has 
been designed and is shown in Figure 12.11. As the input current is a continuous current, there is no

Its  value  is  only 0.5%, that is, IM/Is  =  0.005. Therefore, THD  =  1.0000125. Considering that 
DPF = 0.9998, we obtain the final PF as 0.99979. 
12.1.4.4  Simulation and Experimental Results
The simulation and experimental results are shown to verify the design.
12.1.4.4.1  Simulation Results
The DC-modulated boost-type AC/AC converter shown in Figure 12.11 has the following compo-
nents: L = 10 mH and C = 3 µF. The conduction duty cycle is selected as k = 0.25. The experimental 
results are shown in Figure 12.16. The output voltage VO = Vs/(1 – k) = 267Vrms (the peak value is 
approximately 377 V) with the frequency f = 50 Hz. The waveforms of the input and output voltages 
vs(t) and vO(t) are shown as Channels 1 and 2 in Figure 12.16a. From the figure, it can be seen that 
there is no phase delay, although there may be about 3.374° phase-angle delay from our analysis. 
The output current IO should be 1.8 A, and the output power PO = V2O/R = 475 W.

The input current is measured as Is = 2.4 A (the peak value is approximately 3.39 A) with 
the frequency f = 50 Hz. The waveforms of the input voltage vs(t) and current is(t) are shown as 
Channels 1 and 2 in Figure 12.16b. From the figure, it can be seen that there is no phase delay, 
although there may be about 3.374° phase-angle phase delay from our analysis in Section 12.1.3.4. 
The FFT spectrum of the input current is shown in Figure 12.16c, and THD = 0.015. The input 
power Pin = Vs × Is = 480 W. Although the theoretical analysis has no power losses for the ideal 
condition (η = 1), the particular test shows the power losses. From the results, we obtain the final PF 
as 0.9979 and the power-transfer efficiency η = Po/Pin = 475/480 = 0.989 or 98.9%.

12.1.5  DC-Modulated Single-Stage Buck–Boost-Type AC/AC Converter
For certain applications, the output voltage is required to be lower and higher than the input volt-
age. For this purpose, the DC-modulated single-stage buck–boost-type AC/AC converter has been 
designed and is shown in Figure 12.18. As the input current is a pulse train with the repeating 
frequency fm, a low-pass filter Ls – Cs is required. We have to investigate the operation during both 
positive and negative half-cycles of the input voltage. 
12.1.5.1  Positive Input Voltage Half-Cycle

The whole-cycle input and output voltage waveforms are shown in Figure 12.21a with the conduction 
duty cycle k = 0.43. The voltage-transfer gain M = VO/Vs versus the DC/DC converter conduction duty 
cycle k is shown in Figure 12.21b. It is easy to obtain the variable output voltage higher or lower than 
the input voltage with very high PF and high efficiency. There is polarity reversal between input and 
output voltages, or a phase-angle shift of 180°. Usually, this phase-angle shift does not affect most 
industrial applications. 
The whole-cycle input voltage and current waveforms are shown in Figure 12.22a. The spectrum 
of the input current is shown in Figure 12.22b. The spectrum is very clean, and the little distortion 
from the harmonic component IM at 20 kHz is far from the fundamental frequency component Is at 
50 Hz. Its value is only 0.5%, that is, IM/Is = 0.005. Therefore, THD = 1.0000125. Considering that 
DPF = 0.9998, we obtain the final PF as 0.99979.

Vs = 0.818 × Vs = 163.6Vrms (the peak value is approximately 231.4 V) with the frequency f = 50 Hz. 
The waveforms of the input and output voltages vs(t) and vO(t) are shown as Channels 1 and 2 in 
Figure 12.23a. It can be seen that there is no phase delay, although there may be about 3.374° phase-
angle delay from our analysis in Section 12.3. The output current IO should be 1.1 A, and the output 
power PO = VO
2/R = 178.5 W. 
The input current is measured as Is = 0.9 A (the peak value is approximately 1.27 A) with the fre-
quency f = 50 Hz. The waveforms of the input voltage vs(t) and current is(t) are shown as Channels 1 
and 2 in Figure 12.23b. It can be seen that there is nearly no phase delay, although there may be 
about 3.374° phase-angle delay from our analysis. The FFT spectrum of the input current is shown 
in Figure 12.23c, and THD = 0.1375. The input power Pin = Vs × Is = 180 W. Although the theoreti-
cal analysis shows no power losses for the ideal condition (η = 1), the particular test shows there are 
power losses, which are mainly caused by the power losses of the switches. From the test results, 
we obtain the final PF as 0.9939 and the power-transfer efficiency η = PO /Pin = 178.5/180 = 0.9917 
or 99.17%.

12.2  OTHER TYPES OF DC-MODULATED AC/AC CONVERTERS
Understanding the clue to the design and construction of the DC-modulated single-stage 
AC/AC converter, we can easily design and construct two-stage AC/AC converters. Some con-
verters have a more complex structure such as Luo-converters, superlift Luo-converters, and 
multistage cascaded boost converters. To offer more information to readers, a DC-modulated 
positive output Luo-converter and a two-stage boost-type AC/AC converter have been 
designed.
12.2.1  DC-Modulated P/O Luo-Converter-Type AC/AC Converter
The DC-modulated P/O Luo-converter-type AC/AC converter is shown in Figure 12.25. Its output 
voltage has the same polarity as the input voltage. 
The P/O Luo-converter has a more complex circuit than the buck–boost converter. An input low-
pass filter is required. The values of all components are shown in the circuit diagram in Figure 12.25. 
The simulation circuit is shown in Figure 12.26. 
The simulation waveforms with k = 0.7 and f = 80 kHz are shown in Figure 12.27.

The DC-modulated positive output Luo-converter-type AC/AC converter shown in Figure 12.25 
has an input rms voltage vs = 240 V and a dimmer load with R = 100 Ω. To obtain the output rms 
voltage, vO varies in the range of 100–400 V (higher and lower than the input voltage). Calculate 
the range of the conduction duty cycle k and the output current and power.

12.4  SUBENVELOPE MODULATION METHOD TO REDUCE THE TOTAL 
HARMONIC DISTORTION OF AC/AC MATRIX CONVERTERS
An AC/AC matrix converter is an array of power semiconductor switches that directly connects a 
three-phase AC source to another three-phase load. It can convert an AC power source with a cer-
tain voltage and frequency to another AC load with variable voltage and variable frequency directly 
without the DC link and the bulk energy storage component. Classical modulation methods, such 
as the Venturini and the sub-voltage modulation (SVM) methods using AC-network maximum-
envelope modulation, implement matrix conversion successfully. However, in the meantime, they 
cause very high THD. This chapter presents a novel approach, the SEM method, to reduce the 
THD of matrix converters effectively. The approach is extended to an improved version of matrix 
converters, and the THD can be reduced further. The algorithm of the SEM method is described in 
detail. Simulation and experimental results are also presented to verify the feasibility of the SEM 
approach. The results will be very helpful for industrial applications.
An AC/AC matrix converter is an array of power semiconductor switches that directly connects 
a three-phase AC source to another three-phase load. This converter has several attractive features 
that have been investigated in recent decades. It can convert an AC power source with a certain volt-
age and frequency to another AC load with variable voltage and variable frequency directly without 
a DC link and a bulk energy storage component. It eliminates a large energy storage component, 
that is, a bulk inductor or an electrolytic capacitor. The structure of the classical 3 × 3 matrix con-
verter is shown in Figure 12.35. The semiconductor switches are marked with SJk, which means that 
the switch is connected between input phase J and output phase k, where J = {A,B,C}, k = {a,b,c}. 
All the switches SJk in matrix converters require a bidirectional-switch capability of blocking volt-
age and conducting current in both directions. On the contrary, there are no such devices available 
now; so discrete devices need to be used to construct suitable switch cells. One option is the diode 
bridge bidirectional switch cell arrangement, which consists of an IGBT (or other full control power 
semiconductor switches) at the center of a single-phase diode bridge. The main advantage is that both 
current directions are carried by the same switching device; therefore, only one gate driver is required

per switch cell. Device power losses are relatively high as there are three devices in each conduction 
path. The current direction through the switch cell cannot be controlled. This is a disadvantage as many 
advanced commutation methods require the current direction of the switch cell to be controllable.
The common-emitter bidirectional switch cell arrangement consists of two IGBTs and two diodes 
in another scheme. The diodes provide the reverse blocking capability. There are several advantages 
to using this arrangement when compared with the diode bridge bidirectional switch cell. First, it is 
possible to independently control the direction of the current. Second, the conduction power losses 
are also reduced as only two devices carry the current. Third, each bidirectional switch cell requires 
an isolated power supply for the gate drive. The switch cell can be connected to a common collec-
tor. The conduction power losses are the same as that of the common-emitter configuration. An 
often-quoted advantage of this method is that only six isolated power supplies are needed to supply 
the gate driver. Therefore, the common-emitter configuration is generally preferred for creating the 
matrix converter bidirectional switch cells.
Normally, the matrix converter is fed by a three-phase voltage source and, for this reason, the 
input terminals should not be in short circuit (rule 1). On the other hand, the load typically has 
an inductive nature and, for this reason, an output phase must never be in an open circuit (rule 2). 
Reliable current commutation between switches in matrix converters is more difficult to achieve 
than in the conventional voltage source inverter (VSI) as there are no natural freewheeling paths. 
The commutation has to be actively controlled at all times with respect to the two basic rules. 
These rules can be visualized by considering just two switch cells and one output phase of a matrix 
converter. It is important that no two bidirectional switches are switched on at any point of time, 
as shown in Figure 12.36a. This would result in line-to-line short-circuiting and the destruction of 
the converter due to rush current. Also, the bidirectional switches for each output phase should not 
all be turned off at any instant, as shown in Figure 12.36b. This would result in the absence of a 
path for the inductive load current, causing rush voltage. These two considerations cause a conflict 
as semiconductor devices cannot be switched instantaneously due to propagation delays and finite 
switching times. There are some successful approaches to avoid these two cases: basic current com-
mutation, current direction-based commutation, relative voltage magnitude-based commutation, 
and soft-switching techniques.

Classical modulation methods, such as the Venturini and the SVM using AC-network maximum-
envelope modulation, implement matrix conversion successfully. However, in the meantime, they 
cause very high THD. This chapter presents a novel approach, the SEM method, to reduce the 
THD for matrix converters effectively. The approach is extended to an improved version of matrix

In the following description, we assume that 
•	 The three phases of the input AC supply are balanced; the input phase voltages are vA, vB, 
and vC.
•	 The input AC supply frequency is fi; the corresponding angular speed is ωi = 2πfi.
•	 The output phase voltages are va, vb, and vc.
•	 The output frequency is fO; the corresponding angular speed is ωO = 2πfO.
•	 The switching frequency is f; the period is T. Usually, f >> fi and fO.
•	 VDC is the imaginary DC-link voltage, corresponding to the maximum-envelope rectifying 
average voltage.
12.4.1  Subenvelope Modulation Method
One commonly used modulation method for matrix converters is maximum-envelope modulation, 
which is shown in Figure 12.37a, that is, the output phase voltage is pulse width modulated between 
the maximum input phase and the minimum input phase. The disadvantages are obvious: the mag-
nitude of the output pulse is the difference between the maximum input phase and the minimum 
input phase; so the output pulse has a high magnitude and a narrow width. Therefore, there are

Improved AC/AC Converters
many high-frequency components in the output voltage, and these will result in very high THD. 
Moreover, there is a high dv/dt, which will induce severe electro-magnetic interference (EMI). 
Actually, in matrix converters, the three output phases can be connected to any input phases. So 
the output phase can be modulated between any two input phases. If the output phase is modulated 
between two adjacent input phases as shown in Figure 12.37b, the pulse magnitude of the output 
voltage can be low. Correspondingly, the high-frequency components of the output voltage can 
be reduced. Thus the THD and dv/dt are also reduced. The input line current pulses are smaller 
and wider, and the THD of the input line current is also reduced. The approach is called the SEM 
method.
The structure of the matrix converter implementing the SEM method is shown in Figure 12.38. 
The matrix converter comprises 18 power semiconductor switches (nine switch cells) so that all 
the output phases can be connected to any input phases with bidirectional current capability. The 
switches are marked with SKjr or SKjf, where K = {A,B,C} is the input phase, j = {a,b,c} is the out-
put phase, r denotes the switch that carries the current from the output to the input (reverse), and 
f denotes the switch that carries the current from the input to the output (forward). It was mentioned 
that the common collector switch cell has the advantage of requiring fewer isolated DC power 
supplies for the gate drives. The nine switch cells (18 switches) constitute the common collector 
configuration. The 18 switches can be divided into six switch groups, SAjr, SBjr, SCjr, SKaf, SKbf, and 
SKcf. Each group comprises three common-emitter switches and uses a common gate drive output 
DC floating power supply. 
12.4.1.1  Measure the Input Instantaneous Voltage
It is necessary to know the instantaneous phase voltage of AC supply. One approach is to mea-
sure the input voltage with three voltage sensors. If the AC supply is a balanced sinusoidal supply, 
one simple approach to get the instantaneous phase voltage is applicable, that is, calculating the 
input voltage in real time. If the magnitude and time base of the three-phase supply are known,

the instantaneous phase voltage can be determined. Thus, a three-phase transformer and a rectifier 
are adopted. The turn ratio of the transformer is n:1. The adoption of the transformer is to insulate 
the control circuit from the power stage. The scaled DC-link voltage VDC/n can be obtained by a 
small rate rectifier and an electrolytic capacitor. To get the time base, a comparator is introduced. 
The input of the comparator can be either of two input phases (such as phase A and phase B). The 
output waveform vcom of the comparator is shown in Figure 12.39. 
At the falling edge of vcom (such as t1), the instantaneous phase voltage of the AC supply can be 
obtained:

12.4.1.2  Modulation Algorithm
A SEM example (only va is illustrated) is shown in Figure 12.40. The output is modulated between 
two adjacent input phases. 
The modulation rule of the example is shown in Table 12.1. vhigh is the smallest one that is greater 
than vra (vra is the reference voltage of the output phase a), vlow is the biggest one that is less than vra, 
that is, the output phase a is connected to two adjacent phases; alternately, the duty cycle of PWM, 
δ, can be determined:

Assume that the output frequency is fO, the magnitude of the reference output phase voltage is VO, the 
angular frequency is ωO = 2πfO, and the initial phase angle is ϕ0. The PWM switching frequency is f 
and the period is T. The modulation algorithm of the system can be accomplished by the following:
ALGORITHM 1
Define the variables θi, and θO, and their initial values are set to zero, that is,
	
θi = 0, θO = 0.
Define array vi[3] to store the input phase voltage.
Define array order[3] to map vi to the input phase, and initialize the array with {1,2,3}, rep-
resenting {A, B,C}.
Do nothing until the first falling edge of the signal vcom appears. When the first falling edge 
appears, for every PWM cycle T, do the following loop: 
	
a.	Calculate the AC power supply voltage vi[1] = vA(kT), vi[2] = vB(kT), vi[3] = vC(kT)

where Vm = πVDC/3 3 is the magnitude of the input phase voltage, which is measured 
from the transformer. If the AC power supply is measured by three voltage sensors, 
this step can be ignored.
	
b.	Sort the voltages vi[1], vi[2], and vi[3] in descending order:
	
i.	 If vi[1] < vi[2], then exchange vi[1] and vi[2] and also exchange order[1] and order[2]; 
else do nothing.
	
ii.	 If vi[1] < vi[3], then exchange vi[1] and vi[3] and also exchange order[1] and order[3]; 
else do nothing.
	
iii.	 If vi[2]  <  vi[3], then exchange vi[2] and vi[3] and also exchange order[2] and 
order[3]; else do nothing.
	
Thus if condition vi[1] ≥ vi[2] ≥ vi[3] is satisfied, then the variable order will also map 
the input phases.

The common-mode voltages have no effect on the output line-to-line voltages but allow the tar-
get outputs to fit within the input voltage envelope with a value of up to 87%, as illustrated in 
Figure 12.42.
The improvement of the voltage ratio is achieved by redistributing the null output states of the 
converter (all output lines connected to the same input line) and is analogous to the similar well-
established technique in conventional DC-link PWM converters. It should be noted that a voltage

12.4.2  24-Switch Matrix Converter
From Figure 12.40, it can be seen that if the reference voltage is greater than zero, the out-
put is modulated between two positive phases or a neutral point and one positive phase, and 
vice versa; then the THD can be further reduced. One example of the modulation is shown in 
Figure 12.43.
The modulation can be accomplished by a 12-switch-cell (24 switches) matrix converter, as 
shown in Figure 12.44. The structure is similar to Figure 12.38 except for adding phase lag from all 
the outputs to the neutral point. The added switches are SOjf and SOjr, where j = {a,b,c} is the output 
phase.
The modulation rule of the example is shown in Table 12.2. 
The modulation algorithm is similar to algorithm 1 except for procedure (d).

(a), (b), and (c) are the same as that of Algorithm 1.
(d) For the value of va, do the following:
	
i.	If va ≥ vi[2], it means that va is between vi[1] and vi[2]; then store the vi[1] to vhigh, and 
store vi[2] to vlow.
	
ii.	Else it means that va is between vi[2] and vi[3]; then store the vi[2] to vhigh, and store vi[3] 
to vlow.
	
iii.	If va > 0 and vlow < 0, then store vlow with zero. It means that va is modulated between 
the neutral point and the lower positive phase that is higher than va.
	
iv.	Else do nothing. It means that va is modulated between two positive phases.
	
v.	If va < 0 and vhigh > 0, then store vhigh with zero. It means that va is modulated between 
the neutral point and one higher negative phase that is lower than va.
	
vi.	Else do nothing. It means that va is modulated between two negative phases.

12.4.3  Current Commutation
We need to investigate current commutation between input phases.
12.4.3.1  Current Commutation between Two Input Phases
The current commutation must obey two rules: avoid two input phases being in short circuit and 
avoid any output phase being in open circuit. Relative voltage magnitude-based commutation will be 
introduced to this system. For one output phase, it is always modulated between two input phases (the 
neutral point is also considered as one phase, so total four phases). When the PWM signal is high, it 
is connected to the smallest input phase (vhigh), which is higher than the reference voltage. When the 
PWM signal is low, it is connected to the largest input phase (vlow), which is lower than the reference 
voltage. For convenience, assume that the output phase is a, vhigh is phase A, and vlow is phase B; then 
the gate signal for one PWM cycle is shown in Figure 12.45a. All switches related to the commuta-
tion are also shown in Figure 12.45b. Switching state transition is also illustrated in Figure 12.45c.
Commutation details are given in the following: 
•	 When the PWM signal is high, switches SAaf, SAar, and SBaf are all turned on. As vA > vB and 
switch SBar is turned off, there is no short circuit for two input phases. The output phase 
current ia always flows through phase A: when ia > 0, ia flows from phase A because of 
vA > vB; when ia < 0, ia flows to phase A because switch SBar is turned off.
•	 When the PWM signal is flopped down, switch SAaf is turned off immediately; the output 
current ia transfers from phase A to phase B, and there is no open circuit in phase a. After a 
short delay td, switch SBar is turned on, and there is no short circuit in the input phases. The 
delay td between each switching event is determined by the device characteristics, such as 
turn-off time of a device.
•	 When the PWM signal is low, switches SAar, SBaf, and SBar are all turned on. As vA > vB and 
switch SAaf is turned off, there is no short circuit in the two input phases. Similarly, the 
output current ia always flows through phase B.
•	 When the PWM signal is flipped up, switch SBar is turned off immediately; the output phase 
current ia transfers from phase B to phase A, and there is no open circuit in phase a. After 
a short delay td, switch SAaf is turned on, and there is no short circuit in the input phases.

666
Power Electronics
12.4.3.2  Current Commutation-Related Three Input Phases
Within a PWM cycle, that is, when the PWM signal is flipped up to a high value, current commuta-
tion takes place only between two adjacent input phases. However, when the PWM signal is flopped 
down to a low value, current commutation may take place among the other two of the three input phases 
and neutral O. For example, before t4 in Figure 12.43, modulation takes place between phases A and O; 
after t4, modulation takes place between phases O and C. We assumed that during the last PWM cycle, the 
modulation takes place between M and N (voltage of M > voltage of N). In the next PWM cycle, phase 
P will be related to the modulation. Then all the possible switching states among M, N, and P are shown 
in Table 12.3, in which State 0 is the initial state of the switches. 
Rewriting the switching state transition in Table 12.4, the functions of modes 1–4 are the same as 
those presented in Table 12.3; mode 5 is the current commutation that takes place only between two 
input phases, in which State 0 is the initial state. State 4 is the destination state. From Table 12.4, it 
can be found that 
•	 For switch SMjf: If the destination state is “1,” then its state is kept unchanged; if the destination 
state is “0,” then its state is always flopped to “0” immediately.
•	 For switch SMjr: If the destination state is “1,” then its state is kept unchanged; if the destination 
state is “0,” then its state is always flopped to “0” in step 4.
•	 For switch SNjf: If the destination state is “1,” then its state is kept unchanged; if the destination 
state is “0,” then its state is always flopped to “0” in step 2.

•	 For switch SNjr: If the destination state is “0,” then its state is kept unchanged; if the destination 
state is “1,” then its state is always flipped to “1” in step 3.
•	 For switch SPjf: If the destination state is “0,” then its state is kept unchanged; if the destination 
state is “1,” then its state is always flipped to “1” immediately.
•	 For switch SPjr: If the destination state is “0,” then its state is kept unchanged; if the destination 
state is “1,” then its state is always flipped to “1” in step 3. 
For all switches SKjf and SKjr, the general switching state transition true table can be summarized as 
Table 12.4. Qfn is the initial state of the switches SKjf, Qrn is the initial state of the switches SKjr, Qfn+1 is 
the destination state of the switches SKjf, and Qrn+1 is the destination state of the switches SKjr.
The state transition can be implemented by a combinational logic circuit by adding three delayed 
PWM signals CK1–CK3, as shown in Figure 12.46. Then the logical equation of the switches SKjf 
and SKjr can be obtained as

12.4.4  Simulation and Experimental Results
The direct phase voltage modulation has a maximum voltage ratio of 50%. The simulation and 
experimental results are based on three-phase voltage modulation methods: 
•	 Modulation I: Maximum-envelope modulation for a conventional 9-switch-cell matrix 
converter.
•	 Modulation II: The SEM method for a conventional 9-switch-cell matrix converter.
•	 Modulation III: The SEM method for a 12-switch-cell matrix converter.
12.4.4.1  Simulation Results
The simulation results of output phase voltage (only phase a is illustrated), output line–line volt-
age, input line current, and their FFT under three modulation methods are shown in Figures 12.47 
through 12.49, respectively. The input phase voltage is 240 V (rms value, the same for the follow-
ing), the frequency is 50 Hz; the output phase voltage is 120 V, the frequency is 100 Hz; and the

converter are reduced significantly.
With the improved ratio modulation, the voltage ratio can reach about 87%. The simulation 
results of the phase voltage, the line–line voltage, and the FFT of the line–line voltage with modu-

12.4.4.2  Experimental Results
To verify the feasibility of the proposed scheme, a 12-switch-cell matrix converter is built up. The 
modulation algorithm is implemented by a digital signal processor (DSP) TMS320F2407, which 
is specially designed for power electronics and electric drive. The DSP comprises a dual 10-bit 
16-channel analog-to-digital convertor, a PWM generator, a digital I/O, and other modules. So the 
DSP can measure input voltages, generate three required PWM signals for three output phases, and 
indicate the peripheral circuit whose phases are to be modulated. The peripheral circuit is to gener-
ate a gate signal for the matrix converter (including current commutation), which is built up by GAL 
PLD, logic gate, monostable flip-flops, and so on. 15 A/1200 V 1MBH15-120 IGBT is adopted as 
main switches. A photo-coupled gate driver, TLP250, is used to implement the gate-driver circuit. 
This gate driver provides a peak output current of 1.5 A. It also isolates the input signal from the 
output, and thus common-mode noise is reduced. An IGBT needs +15 to +20 V voltage to turn on

and –5 to –10 V to turn off. To get the required voltage with single DC power supply, a +7 V stabili-
volte tube (Zener diode) is used to get the required negative turn-off voltage. Thus, the driver circuit 
can provide +17 V for turn-on and –7 V for turn-off with single +24 V output DC power supply.

The experimental results implementing modulations II and III with the same frequency and mag-

13 AC/DC/AC and DC/
AC/DC Converters
AC/DC/AC and DC/AC/DC conversion technologies are a special subject area in research and 
­industrial applications. AC/DC/AC converters are usually applied in synchronous and asynchronous 
AC motor asynchronous speed driver (ASDs). In recent years, they have also been widely used in 
renewable energy systems, especially in wind turbine energy systems. DC/AC/DC converters are 
usually applied in high-­voltage equipment to isolate the source side and the load side. Those are 
also adopted in medium and small power systems such as solar panels, photovoltaic cells, and fuel 
cell energy systems.
13.1  INTRODUCTION
Renewable energy sources have been a hot topic in recent years. Most renewable energy sources 
are DC generation source (DGs). These sources, such as fuel cells, solar panels, photovoltaic cells, 
and wind turbines, are not standard general sources with stable output voltage and frequency. Some 
renewable energy sources are AC voltage sources such as wind turbines. The output AC voltage 
(single-phase or three-phase) of a wind turbine depends on wind speed and other factors. Definitely, 
its output AC voltage amplitude is unstable, and the output frequency and phase are also unstable. 
Consequently, direct use of this output AC voltage of a wind turbine is inconvenient.
The necessity of using an AC/DC/AC converter is given in the following: 
•	 The AC source voltage is unstable.
•	 The AC source frequency is unstable.
•	 The AC source phase number does not match the load requirement.
Some renewable energy sources are DC voltage sources, for example, fuel cells and solar pan-
els. The output DC voltage of a solar panel depends on the weather, temperature, and sunlight. 
Definitely, its output DC voltage and power are unstable. Consequently, direct use of this output DC 
voltage is inconvenient. Normalized DC/DC converters are restricted by the power limitation. DC/
AC/DC converters can transfer large power, and these are better than normal DC/DC converters.
The necessity of using a DC/AC/DC converter is given in the following: 
•	 The DC source voltage is unstable.
•	 The DC source power is unstable.
•	 The DC source impedance does not match the requirement.
13.2  AC/DC/AC CONVERTERS USED IN WIND TURBINE SYSTEMS
Wind turbines are one of the most promising energy sources, which have gained attention in recent 
decades and have penetrated utility systems deeply compared with other renewable sources. On the 
contrary, the output voltage and frequency of wind turbines are unstable as the wind speed is vari-
able. These turbines are installed onshore or offshore, or sometimes as a wind farm where a large 
number of turbines are installed and connected together. A single wind-tower structure is shown in 
Figure 13.1.

678
Power Electronics
German scientist Albert Betz proved that the wind turbine is most efficient when the wind slows 
down to 2v/3 of its speed just before the rotor and decreases to v/3 after the rotor, before regaining 
its original speed v due to surrounding winds. Therefore, Betz’s law states that the maximum power 
that can be extracted from wind is 59% of the total power available in the wind, ignoring mechani-
cal and aerodynamic losses. Wind turbines transfer the linear moving wind energy into rotational 
energy by the function
	
P
R v Cp
= 0 5
2
3
. ρπ
	
(13.1)
where:
P is the power
ρ is the air density
R is the turbine radius
v is the wind speed
Cp is the turbine power coefficient
Cp is a function only of the tip speed ratio λ, where the variation of Cp with λ is given. The tip speed 
has to be maintained at an optimal value to extract maximum power.
Typically, wind turbines consist of three aerodynamically designed blades that are positioned in 
the horizontal axis, and the whole system is mounted on a tower. The rotational mechanical energy 
is converted into electrical energy by using a generator. In some cases, energy is transmitted through 
a gearbox to change the speed. Basically, wind turbines are controlled mechanically, by either pitch 
controlling or stall controlling. Pitch controlling is more complex when the wind speed is con-
tinuously measured, and blades are adjusted accordingly to capture energy efficiently. Moreover, it 
would protect the turbine from high wind speeds. This control method is more efficient compared 
with stall control. The stall-controlled blades are fixed at a constant pitch angle that is not changed 
during the operation. Stall is a simple aerodynamic effect that separates airflow from the aerofoil 
when the turbine runs at a constant speed, and when the wind speed increases. This changes the 
angle of attack and limits the wind power captured, thereby protecting the turbine from high wind 
speeds. However, due to the randomness of wind availability and also when these wind turbines are 
operated to capture maximum power, the operating voltage and frequency tend to vary, making the 
output unsuitable for grid connection demanding power conditioning before being consumed.

AC/DC/AC and DC/AC/DC Converters
There are many generator topologies that are commonly used in wind turbines such as induc-
tion generators, synchronous generators, and permanent magnet synchronous generators. Some 
generators are connected directly to the grid, whereas others use power electronic interfaces. 
Power electronic interfaces have to be selected depending on the generator used and the adopted 
controlling method. In general, induction generators are used with fixed-speed wind turbines, and 
power is limited mechanically with pitch or stall controlling. The other type is the variable-speed 
wind turbine that controls the pitch and uses a power electronic interface at the output of the gen-
erator (which can be a synchronous generator, a permanent magnet synchronous generator, or a 
doubly fed induction generator). There are different power electronic converter topologies that are 
employed in interfacing these wind generators to overcome problems of variation in frequency and 
voltage. In the case of synchronous generators, full-rated power electronic converters are used. 
Usually, they can be AC to DC converters followed by inverters or simple rectifiers followed by 
DC to DC converters and then inverters. For induction generators, there are two possibilities: They 
can have AC to DC converters followed by DC to AC inverters in both the stator and rotor or only 
AC to DC inverters followed by DC to AC inverters connected in the rotor of induction generators. 
In summary, all these topologies use a combination of two or more power electronic converters, 
making the overall process inefficient and difficult to control, as identified in the first section of 
this chapter. This leaves space for the development of single-stage topologies in integrating wind 
power-generating systems.
The output AC voltage of a wind turbine can be single phase, three phase, or multiphase. Its 
output voltage and frequency are usually not stable. Some industrial applications require AC/AC 
converters to transfer an unstable AC energy source to a stable AC load. Most AC/AC converters 
are not suitable for these applications. We need to use AC/DC/AC converters to implement the 
work.
13.2.1  Review of Traditional AC/AC Converters
Traditional AC/AC converters have been introduced in Chapter 11. There are three methods to 
implement AC/AC conversion: 
•	 VR converters
•	 Cycloconverters
•	 MCs
VR converters are usually used in applications with a stable input AC source, unchanged output 
frequency (fundamental harmonic frequency), and adjustable output voltage. These converters 
have the following advantages: simple structure, lower cost, and easy control. The drawbacks are 
poor PF, heavily distorted waveform (poor THD), low power transfer efficiency, and low-voltage 
transfer gain.
Cycloconverters are usually used in applications with a stable input AC source and adjustable 
output voltage and output frequency (lower than half of the input frequency). These converters 
have the following advantages: good PF, slightly distorted waveform (good THD), and adjustable 
output voltage and frequency. The drawbacks are complex structure, complex control circuitry, 
higher cost, and low efficiency. The output voltage and frequency are lower than the input voltage 
and frequency.
MCs are usually used in applications with a stable input AC source. These converters have the 
following advantages: adjustable output voltage and frequency, simple structure, and lower cost. 
Although the maximum output voltage is lower than 0.866 times the input voltage, the output volt-
age can be easily adjustable. The output frequency can be either higher or lower than the input fre-
quency. The drawbacks are poor PF, heavily distorted waveform (poor THD), bidirectional switches 
required, heavy network pollution, and complex control circuitry.

13.2.2  New AC/DC/AC Converters
AC/DC/AC converters can absorb the energy from a random input AC voltage source with unstable 
voltage and frequency to a fixed DC-link voltage (AC/DC conversion) and then convert the energy 
to a required AC output voltage with adjustable frequency and voltage (DC/AC conversion). The 
uncertainty of the input voltage from a random input AC voltage source has been dispelled by a con-
trolled AC/DC converter, the output DC voltage of which is DC-link voltage. The DC-link voltage 
is stable and can be used for DC/AC inverters. The typical application is ASD. In this subsection, 
we introduce four circuits: 
•	 AC/DC/AC boost-type converters
•	 Three-level AC/DC/AC converters
•	 Two-level AC/DC/AC impedance source inverter (ZSI)
•	 Three-level diode-clamped AC/DC/AC ZSI
13.2.2.1  AC/DC/AC Boost-Type Converters
An AC/DC/AC boost-type converter is shown in Figure 13.2. The input AC source may be a single- 
or three-phase energy source with unstable voltage and frequency. If it is a wind turbine, its voltage 
can vary in ±25%, and its frequency can change in ±15%. The AC/DC converter has two blocks. 
The first block is an AC/DC rectifier, which can be a diode rectifier. Its output DC voltage is unstable 
with high efficiency, but independent of frequency. It may rarely be a controllable rectifier, and the 
output DC voltage can be slightly stable with lower efficiency, but independent of frequency as 
well. The second block is a boost DC/DC converter. It can convert an unstable DC voltage to a fixed 
DC-link voltage, for example, 660-V DC.
The real-end block is a DC/AC inverter. Usually, it is a VSI with three-phase output AC voltage 
with 400 V/60 Hz.
A particular circuit diagram is shown in Figure 13.3.

AC/DC/AC and DC/AC/DC Converters
Example 13.1
A wind turbine has three-phase output voltage 230 V ± 25% and frequency 60 Hz ± 15%; the 
power rate is 5 kW. The end user is a three-phase load with voltage 400 V. Design an AC/DC/AC 
boost-type converter for this application.
Solution
Use a diode rectifier to rectify the input AC voltage to an unstable output DC voltage; the 
efficiency η can be 92%–97%. The wind turbine three-phase output voltage is 230 V ± 25% 
independent of the frequency 60  Hz  ±  15%. The rectified output DC voltage can be 
311 V ± 25%, that is, 233–389 V DC.
Use a boost DC/DC converter to convert the unstable 233–389 V DC to a fixed 660 V DC, that 
is, Vin is 233–389 V and VO is 660 V DC. VO is the fixed DC-link voltage. The corresponding duty 
cycle k can be set in the range of

A three-phase three-level diode-clamped voltage source DC/AC inverter converts the DC-link 
voltage into the load.
Usually, if the single-phase wind turbine output voltage has smaller voltage variation, for exam-
ple, ±5%–10%, and the applications are not so serious, we can directly link the AC/DC rectifier 
to the DC/AC diode-clamped inverter. Therefore, this is the simplest AC/DC/AC converter, but it 
works well and is easily controlled.

states can be used to provide some degrees of freedom.

13.2.3  Two-Level AC/DC/AC ZSI
A two-level AC/DC/AC ZSI is shown in Figure 13.7. A front-end diode rectifier is competitively 
appealing because of its low cost, albeit at the expense of a loss in controllability at its AC input 
regardless of the DC/AC inverter topology connected after the front-end rectifier. In addition, using 
a passive diode rectifier is known to constrain the converter to operate in only the forward power 
transfer mode and generally support only voltage buck or boost operation, which to some extent 
constrains its disturbance (e.g., voltage sag and surge) ride-through ability.
The real end is formed by cascading a two-level Z-source DC/AC inverter as depicted in 
Figure 13.7. The ZSI allows the system output voltage to be stepped down or up as desired by 
inserting a unique X-shaped LC impedance network, comprising two inductors and two capaci-
tors, between the rectifier and inverter circuitries. On the diode rectifier AC input side, three small 
delta-connected filter capacitors are added for filtering the three-phase AC input currents so as to 
eliminate frequent high current peaks that are drawn by traditional diode rectifiers with large DC 
capacitive storages. The proposed ZSI therefore appears as a compromising solution between the 
traditional AC/DC/AC diode-front-end converter and the back-to-back controlled converter, as it 
supports voltage buck–boost operation at a low cost, while constrained by its unidirectional energy 
conversion and a less than perfect input current waveform, which is still harmonically less distorted 
as compared with that drawn by a traditional diode rectifier.
13.2.4  Three-Level Diode-Clamped AC/DC/AC ZSI
A three-level diode-clamped AC/DC/AC ZSI is shown in Figure 13.8. This three-level AC/DC/AC 
ZSI can produce a harmonically less distorted three-level output waveform with the use of only 
minimal passive and semiconductor components for implementation. Specifically, the proposed 
converter uses only six diodes for its AC/DC rectification and only a single X-shaped LC impedance 
network for performing its buck–boost operation with no increase in its front-end element count as 
compared with that needed by the two-level converter documented earlier in Figure 13.7. On its AC 
output end, the proposed converter uses a three-level DC/AC inverter, which can be of either NPC 
or DC-link cascaded topology. Although not intuitively obvious, the neutral potential needed by 
the three-level inverter circuitry can uniquely be tapped from the wye-connected filter capacitors 
placed before the front-end diode rectifier for input current filtering.
The real end is a three-level diode-clamped Z-source DC/AC inverter as depicted in Figure 13.8. 
The resulting AC/DC/AC converter therefore offers a low-cost alternative that can ride through 
deep voltage sags, while producing an improved three-level voltage waveform for powering the 
externally connected AC load.

13.2.5  Linking a Wind Turbine System to a Utility Network
DG sources do not usually have standard and stable output voltage and frequency. A wind turbine is 
a typical example, although it is an AC voltage source. To link its output power to a utility network, 
an AC/DC/AC converter is necessarily required to implement the synchronization. The following 
are the synchronization conditions for an AC generator to link to a utility network: 
•	 The output voltage amplitude of the AC generator is the same as the voltage amplitude of 
the utility network.
•	 The frequency of the AC generator is the same as the frequency of the utility network.
•	 The voltage phase of the AC generator is the same as the voltage phase of the utility 
network.
To link a wind turbine system to a utility network, the AC/DC/AC inverter has to adjust its output 
voltage, frequency, and phase angle. If one carefully controls the DC/AC inverter, the synchroniza-
tion condition is not difficult to achieve.
13.3  DC/AC/DC CONVERTERS
There are more than 600 topologies of DC/DC converters existing for DC voltage conversion. 
Usually, this is enough for research and industrial applications. A DC/AC/DC converter is required 
for some special applications such as high power transformation.
13.3.1  Review of Traditional DC/DC Converters
Three traditional converters are the buck converters, boost converters, and buck–boost converters. 
They have the simplest structure and a clear operation process. One inductor plays the role of a 
pumping circuit. The maximum power transferred from the source to the load is restricted by the PE.
For example, a buck converter as shown in Figure 13.9a converts the energy from source V1 to 
load R (the voltage is V2). The inductor current increases when switch S is on and decreases when 
switch S is off. In the steady state, the inductor current changes from Imin to Imax when switch S is on

It is verified.
The same operation is available for boost and buck–boost converters. From this example, we 
know that the power delivered from source to load is restricted by the pumping circuit.
13.3.2  Chopper-Type DC/AC/DC Converters
To increase the power delivered from source to load, we need to avoid using an inductor-pumping 
circuit. A good way is to apply the choppers to chop the DC source voltage to the AC pulse train 
and then rectify the AC waveform back to DC voltage. The rectifier can be diode rectifiers or a 
transformer and diode rectifiers. Figure 13.10 shows a DC/AC/DC converter with a dual-polarity 
chopper and a diode rectifier circuit. The chopper has two pairs of switches (S1+, S2–) and (S2+, S1–). 
Each pair of switches switch on and switch off simultaneously. The output AC voltage vAC is an AC 
voltage with positive and negative peak values, +vin and –vin. A diode rectifier (D1–D4) is applied to 
rectify the AC voltage vAC to the DC output voltage vO.
By using this DC/AC/DC converter, the power delivered from source vin to load has no restriction 
as there is no pumping circuit. The output voltage vO is lower than the input voltage vin. The switch-
ing duty cycle of the pair (S1+, S2–) is k1, and the pairs switching duty cycle of the pair (S2+, S1–) is k2. 
Usually, k1 + k2 ≤ 1. The output voltage vO is

We can add a transformer in the circuit and then obtain random output voltage depending on the

and a transformer and diode rectifier circuit. By using this DC/AC/DC converter, the power deliv-
ered from source vin to load has no restriction as there is no pumping circuit. The output voltage vO 
can be higher or lower than the input voltage vin.

The switching duty cycle of the pair (S1+, S2–) is k1, and the pairs switching duty cycle of the pair 
(S2+, S1–) is k2. Usually, k1 + k2 ≤ 1. The transformer winding turn’s ratio is n; n can be greater or 
smaller than unity. If the turn’s ratio is greater than unity, it is very easy to obtain the output voltage 
vO that is higher than the input voltage vin. The output voltage vO is

t = k1T to T, the main switches S1 and S2 switch off. The auxiliary switches S5 and S6 switch on in 
the period k2T. In the meantime, the auxiliary switches S3 and S4 must switch off. We can arrange 
the main switches S1 and S2 to be switched on at t = 0 to k1T, and the auxiliary switches S5 and S6 
switch on at t = 0.5T to (0.5 + k2)T. The auxiliary switches S3 and S4 can switch on from t = 0 to 
0.5T. In other words, the auxiliary switches S3 and S4 can switch on simultaneously with the main 
switches S1 and S2 but may not necessarily switch off simultaneously with the main switches S1 
and S2. The auxiliary switches S3 and S4 can switch off at any moment from t > 0 to 0.5T. Usually, 
(k1 + k2) ≤ 1. 
The corresponding waveforms are shown in Figure 13.12b.
We can add a transformer in the circuit and then obtain random output voltage depending 
on the transformer turn-ratio. Figure 13.13 shows the DC/AC/DC converter with a switched 
capacitor and a transformer and diode rectifier circuit. By using this DC/AC/DC converter, 
the power delivered from source vin to load has no restriction as there is no inductor-pumping 
circuit. The output voltage vO can be higher or lower than the input voltage vin. The trans-
former winding turn’s ratio is n; n can be greater or smaller than unity. If the turn’s ratio n is 
greater than unity, it is very easy to obtain the output voltage vO that is higher than the input 
voltage vin.

13.3.3.2  Three-Stage Switched-Capacitor DC/AC/DC Converter
By using more switched capacitors, we can design other switched-capacitor DC/AC/DC converters. 
A three-stage switched-capacitor DC/AC/DC converter is shown in Figure 13.14.
This three-stage switched-capacitor DC/AC/DC converter has three switched capacitors C1, C2, 
and C3, and input voltage vin, middle AC voltage vAC, and output DC voltage vO. The switching fre-
quency is f, and the corresponding period is T = 1/f. The conduction duty cycle of the main switches 
S1, S2, and S3 is k1. Therefore, the main switches S1, S2, and S3 switch on during the period k1T to 
provide AC voltage vAC = 2vin. In the meantime, the auxiliary switches S4–S7 switch on to change 
the switched capacitors C1 and C2 (voltages vC1 and vC2) to source voltage vin. From t = k1T to T, the 
main switches S1–S3 switch off. The auxiliary switches S10–S12 switch on from t = 0.5T (in the period 
k2T) to provide AC voltage vAC = –2vi. In the meantime, the auxiliary switches S8 and S9 switch on 
to charge the switched capacitor C3 to source voltage vin. The auxiliary switches S4–S7 must switch 
off in this period. We can arrange the main switches S1–S3 to be switched on at t = 0 to k1T, and 
the auxiliary switches S10–S12 switch on at t = 0.5T to (0.5 + k2)T. The auxiliary switches S4–S7 can 
switch on from t = 0 to 0.5T. In other words, the auxiliary switches S4–S7 can switch on simulta-
neously with the main switches S1–S3 but may not necessarily switch off simultaneously with the

main switches S1–S3. The auxiliary switches S4–S7 can switch off at any moment from t > 0 to 0.5T. 
Similarly, the auxiliary switches S8 and S9 can switch off at any moment from t > 0.5T to T. Usually,

The corresponding waveforms are shown in Figure 13.14b.
We can add a transformer in the circuit and then obtain random output voltage depending on the 
transformer turn-ratio. Figure 13.15 shows the DC/AC/DC converter with a three-stage switched 
capacitor and a transformer and diode rectifier circuit. By using this DC/AC/DC converter, the 
power delivered from source vi to load has no restriction as there is no inductor-pumping circuit. The 
output voltage vO can be higher or lower than the input voltage vi. The transformer winding turn’s 
ratio is n; n can be greater or smaller than unity. If the turn’s ratio n is greater than unity, it is very 
easy to obtain the output voltage vO, which is higher than the input voltage vi.
The corresponding waveforms are shown in Figure 13.15b.
It is possible to design other odd number (n is the odd number, m > 3) stage switched-capacitor 
DC/AC/DC converters. (m – 1)/2 switched capacitors and the source voltage supply the positive half-cycle

of the intermediate AC voltage; other (m + 1)/2 switched capacitors supply the negative half-cycle of the 
intermediate AC voltage.
13.3.3.3  Four-Stage Switched-Capacitor DC/AC/DC Converter
It is possible to design even number (n is the even number, m ≥ 2) stage switched-capacitor 
DC/AC/DC converters. Considering the symmetry of the intermediate AC voltage, half of the 
switched capacitors (m/2 switched capacitors) supply the positive half-cycle of the intermedi-
ate AC ­voltage; the other half of the switched capacitors supply the negative half-cycle of the 
intermediate AC ­voltage. The source voltage can only be used to change the two groups of 
switched capacitors alternatively. Figure 13.16 shows the four-stage switched-capacitor DC/
AC/DC converter.
When t  =  0, the switches S5–S8 switch on to charge capacitors C1 and C2 to the source 
­voltage vi. The switches S12–S14 switch on, and the capacitors C3 and C4 supply +2vi to vAC in the 
period of k1T. When t = 0.5T, the switches S1–S4 switch on to charge the capacitors C3 and C4 to

vAC in the period of k2T. The waveforms are shown in Figure 13.16b. After the diode rectifier, we 
obtain the output voltage vO. 
We can still add a transformer in the circuit to enlarge the output voltage. A four-stage switched 
capacitor with a transformer DC/AC/DC converter is shown in Figure 13.17. The waveforms are 
shown in Figure 13.17b.
