Preface 
This is a renewal-theoretic analysis of a class of single-item (s, S) 
inventory systems. Included, in a unified exposition, are both con-
tinuous and periodic review systems under fairly general random de-
mand processes. The monograph is complete in the sense that it 
starts from the derivation of the time dependent and stationary dis-
tributions of basic stochastic processes related to these systems and 
concludes with the construction and testing of simple, distribution-
free approximations for optimal control policies. However, it is rather 
incomplete as an account of single-item inventory systems in that it 
narrowly focuses on systems with full backlogging of unfilled demand 
and constant lead times, through what has come to be known as 
stationary analysis. 
The level is intermediate, and the style is informal. Some prior 
knowledge of probability theory and inventory control is assumed on 
the part of the reader. Given these, the monograph is self-contained. 
Extensive use is made ofrenewal-theoretic concepts and results; these 
are reviewed in Chapter 2. 
The text relies heavily on my previously published work on the 
subject. Over the years, this research has been supported by the Sci-

entific and Technical Research Council of Turkey, National Research 
Council of Canada (1978-79, A3074), Management Research Center 
of the University of Wisconsin- Milwaukee, and the National Science 
Foundation (ECS-8011916). I am grateful to Dr. Diptendu Sinha of 
the University of Notre Dame for his very substantial help in compu-
tational work and to Dr. D. J. McConalogue of the Delft University 
of Technology for providing us with his algorithm and software for 
its implementation. 
A prepublication draft of the monograph was used as lecture 
notes for a graduate course on inventory theory at the Industrial 
Engineering Department of Bilkent University. I thank my students,

Introduction 
This monograph is about a class of single-item (s, S) inventory sys-
tems that can be investigated through renewal theory. These systems 
are characterized by: 1) independent, identically distributed (Li.d.) 
batch sizes (quantities demanded) separated by Li.d. interdemand 
times, 2) full backlogging of unfilled demand, and 3) a constant pro-
curement lead time. The first two representations give rise to a sim-
ple regenerative structure, and the constant rather than random lead 
times result in additional simplifications. Included are both continu-
ous review and periodic review systems, with the latter being treated 
as a special case of the former. 
For the continuous review system, let Xn be the length of the n-th 
interdemand time and Yn the size of the n-th demand. Let L 2:: 0 
denote the length of the lead time. At time t, inventory on hand is 
f( t) and inventory position is fp( t). The latter is defined as the stock 
on hand plus on order minus backorders. The control policy is an 
(s, S) policy that operates on the inventory position. Thus, whenever 
fp(t) < s, an order of size S - fp(t) is placed which arrives L time 
units later. Clearly, there could be several orders outstanding during 
a lead time (Figure 1.1). In terms of inventory costs, we impose a 
simple structure on the system involving a fixed setup (ordering) cost

J( and linear holding and shortage costs with respective rates hand 
p ($/unit/unit time). 
The continuous review system described above was first investi-
gated under constant lead times by Beckman (1961). Among more 
recent work, the most relevant ones for our purposes are Tijms (1972) 
and Stidham (1977, 1986). Our treatment is based in part on Sahin 
(1979, 1982, 1988a, 1988b) and Sahin and Sinha (1987). 
For the periodic review system, let Yn be the demand during 
the n-th period. The sequence {Yn , n = 1,2, ... ,} is i.i.d. It is 

3 
assumed that the lead time is an integral multiple of the common 
period length which in turn is regarded as unity. The control policy 
is again an (s, S) policy operating on the inventory position at the 
end of each period. Period ends are review points. If the inventory 
position at a review point is < s, an order is placed to raise it to 
S. Otherwise, no action is taken. The order placed arrives after L 
periods. There is a fixed ordering cost J(; holding and shortage costs 
are linear and are charged against period ending inventories at rates 
hand p ($funitfperiod) respectively (Figure 1.2a). 
Following Arrow et al. (1951, 1958), the periodic review model 
has been investigated by many authors. Optimality of (s, S) type 
policies for the corresponding multi-period dynamic model was es-
tablished by Scarf (1960). He showed that if the procurement cost 
is of the form J( + cz, z > 0, where J( is the fixed charge and c 
the unit cost, and if the one period expected holding plus shortage 
cost function is convex, then the optimal policy for period n is an 
(sn' Sn) policy. Scarf's proof was extended to non-differentiable cost 
functions by Zabel (1962), and, an alternative proof under slightly 
different conditions was provided by Veinott (1966). For the station-
ary model of interest to us, Iglehart (1963) showed that under Scarf's 
assumptions, the sequences {sn,n = 1,2, ... } and {Sn, n = 1,2, ... } 
converge to limit points sand S which form the optimal policy for the 
infinite-horizon problem. Some of this literature is reviewed below. 
The periodic review model can be handled as a special case of the 
continuous review model introduced above (cf. Stidham, 1986). Since 
the inventory position is reckoned and holding and shortage costs are 
charged at the end of each period, we may assume without any loss 
that the total demand of a period is realized in one batch at the be-
ginning of the period, immediately following any order receipt. The 
inventory position then remains the same until the end of the period. 
In this version of the periodic review system, an order will be placed 
if and only if the inventory position has been below s throughout the 
previous period. To reconcile this with the order-triggering mecha-
nism of the continuous review system, we may assume, again without 
any loss, that an order is placed whenever the inventory position falls

below s but that one period is added to the original lead time. With 
reference to the original system, this amounts to placing the orders 
at the beginning, rather than at the end, of the period in which the 
inventory position falls below s, but adding a period to the original 
lead time. With these conventions, the periodic-review system is 
effectively equivalent to the continuous-review system with constant 
interdemand times (Figure 1.2b). Since in the modified system the 
inventory position remains constant during a period, the lump sum 
charging of holding and shortage costs can be replaced by continuous 
charging as in the continuous review model. 
These observations (cf. Stidham, 1986) enable us to provide a 
unified treatment of a general class of inventory systems. Assump-
tions made on the demand process and the cost structure guarantee 
the optimality of an (s, S) type policy. This and the assumption 
of full backlogging in turn give rise to a regenerative structure that 
is exploited throughout the monograph. For completeness, we first 
establish the fact that the form of the optimal policy is (s, S) by 
reviewing the classical literature on periodic review systems. The 
results are then extended to continuous review systems. 
1.1 
Optimality of (s, S) Policies 
The classical multi period model (cf. Arrow et al., 1951) is based on 
the assumption that demands in successive periods are Li.d. ran-
dom variables, shortages at the end of any period (except the last) 
must be made up, and holding and shortage costs are incurred with 
respect to period ending inventory levels. The one-period expected 
holding and shortage cost function is assumed convex, and the setup 
(ordering) cost is independent of the order size. A constant lead time, 
assumed to be an integral multiple of the period length, is allowed as 
an extension of the basic model with immediate deliveries. The ob-
jective is the minimization of the expected total discounted cost over 
a planning horizon of n periods. The approach is through dynamic 
programming based on backward recursion where period n refers to 

6 
CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 
an n-period problem (Le., n periods left to go). 
Although this approach has been the basis for a number of algo-
rithms that are designed to compute optimal inventory control poli-
cies, its main utility is in the determination of the form of these poli-
cies. For this purpose, we first consider the finite-horizon problem 
under immediate deliveries. The discussion is then extended to the 
infinite-horizon problem, positive lead times and continuous review 
systems. 
1.1.1 
The Finite-Horizon Problem 
For the n-period problem the procurement cost function III every 
period is assumed to be of the form: 
c( z) = { J( + cz, 
0, 
z > 0, 
z = 0, 
(1.1 ) 
where c is the unit cost and J( the setup cost. We note in the sequel 
that both parameters may be allowed to vary from period to period 
(under a monotonicity condition for setup costs) without altering the 
main conclusion of this section that (s, S) policies are optimal. The 
one-period expected loss function is: 
j
loY h(y - x)b(x)dx + l co p(x - y)b(x)dx , 
f(y) = 
looo p(x - y)b(x)dx 
y ~ 0, 
y < 0, 
(1.2) 
where y is the quantity on hand after ordering at the beginning of 
a period h(.) and p(.) are the inventory holding and shortage cost 
functions, respectively, and b(x), x ~ 0, is the p.d.f of demand during 
a period. 
Let En( u) denote the total cost of following an optimal policy for 
the n-period problem. It is seen that En( u) satisfies the functional 

1.1. OPTIMALITY OF (S, S) POLICIES 
7 
equation: 
En(u) = miny~u {c(y - u) + r(y) + a 1
00 En-I(y - x)b(x)dx}, 
n = 1,2, ... , 
(1.3) 
where Eo(u) == 0, c(.) is the procurement cost function given by (1.1), 
and 0 ~ a ~ 1 is the discount factor. 
Scarf's original proof of the optimality of (s, S) policies was based 
on an interesting concept of convexity, that he called K - convexity, 
in relation to the function: 
Gn(y) = cy + r(y) + a 1
00 En-I(y - x)b(x)dx. 
(1.4) 
Definition 1.1 A differentiabiel function g(x) is K -convex for K ~ 
o if K + g(a + x) ~ g(x) + ag'(x) for a ~ 0 and -00 < x < 00. 
It is seen that O-convexity is equivalent to ordinary convexity. It 
also follows from the definition that 1) if g(x) is K-convex then it 
is M-convex for M ~ K, 2) if gl(X) is KI-convex and g2(X) is K 2-
convex, then algl(x) + a2g2(x) is (aIKI + a2K2)-convex for al ~ 0, 
a2 ~ O. This last property extends to sums and integrals. 
Theorem 1.1 (Scarf, 1960) If r(y) is convex then Gn(y) is K-
convex. 
Corollary 1.1 Under the assumption of Theorem 1.1, the optimal 
policy for the n-period problem is characterized by a pair of critical 
numbers (sn' Sn), Sn < Sn: if u > Sn, order Sn - u, if u > Sn, do not 
order where u is the quantity on hand before ordering at the beginning 
of period n. Sn is the value of y that minimizes Gn(y) and Sn is 
defined as the smallest number that satisfies Gn(sn) = Gn(Sn) + K. 
1 If differentiability is not assumed, g' (x) is replaced in the definition by [g( x)-
g(x-b)]/b, b ~ O. In what follows, we assume differentiability but this assumption 
can be removed (Zabel, 1962). 

8 
CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 
These follow from Theorem 1.1 because the condition for K-
convexity of Gn(x), that is: 
K + Gn(a + x) ~ Gn(x) + aG~(x), a ~ 0, 
(1.5) 
rules out the type of shape for Gn(y) that is seen in Figure 1.3a. In 
that case, we would order up to Sn if Y < Snl, we would not order if 
Snl :S Y :S Sn2, order if Sn2 :S Y :S Sn3, and would not order if Y > Sn3. 
Thus the optimal policy would have been specified by four critical 
numbers. On the other hand, an example for the shape of Gn(y) that 
is allowed by condition (1.5) is se~n in Figure 1.3b. Here, the optimal 
policy is of (s, S) type as constructed above. 
Proof of Theorem 1. If r(y) is convex, then G1(y) = cy + r(y) 
is convex, therefore K-convex by property 1 we noted above of a K-
convex function. Assume Gn(y) is K-convex. It follows from (1.4) 
and property 3 that Gn+1(Y) is aK-convex, therefore K-convex if 
Jo= En(Y - x)b(x)dx is K-convex. In turn, again by property 3, this 
integral is K-convex if En(Y) is. 
Since Gn(y) is K-convex by the induction assumption, the optimal 
n-th period policy is (sn, Sn). Therefore: 
(1.6) 
First, for u ~ Sn, En(u) is K-convex as it is the sum of a linear 
and a K-convex function. Second, for a > 0 arbitrary but fixed and 
u < Sn < u + a, we have:

miny~u {c(y - u) + r(y) + a loo En-1(y - x)b(x)dx} 
< c(a) + r(u + a) + a loo En-1(u + a - x)b(x)dx 
c(a) + En(u + a). 
(1.7) 
The inequality is due to the fact that y = u + a is not necessarily 
optimal. The third line follows since the optimal policy is not to order 
when u + a> Sn. By definition, En(u) is I(-convex if I( + En(u + 
a)-En(u)-aE~(u) = I( +En(u+a)-En(u)+ca ~ 0 where we used 
E~(u) = -c for u < Sn by (1.6). This holds in view of (1.7) where 
c( a) = J( + ca. This shows that En( u) is I( -convex and completes 
the proof of the theorem. 
Scarf's theorem and proof extends immediately to non-stationary 
costs and demand distributions. Clearly, dependence on the period 
of the loss function or the demand distribution (Le., r n(Y) instead of 
r(y) and bn ( x) instead of b( x)) does not alter the proof or the conclu-
sion, provided that r n(Y) is convex for each n and period demands 
are independent random variables. Also, since g( x) is I(-convex if 
it is M-convex where Jv[ :S J(, the set-up costs and discount factors 
may also vary from period to period so long as I( n ~ anI( n-l' 
Aside from these obvious extensions, Veinott (1966) provided an 
alternative proof of optimality of (s, S) type policies for the n-period 
inventory problem under different assumptions. He replaced the con-
vexity assumption on the one-period loss function by the weaker as-
sumption of quasi- convexity (i.e., r(x) is unimodal). More impor-
tantly, he extended the class of problems for which there is an optimal 
(s, S) policy. In addition to complete backlogging, this class includes 
models in which the excess demand is partially or completely lost (see 
also Veinott and Wagner, 1965). 

1.1. OPTIMALITY OF (8,8) POLICIES 
1.1.2 
The Infinite-Horizon Problem 
and Stationary Policies 
11 
Limi ting behavior of the optimal cost functions En (x) and policy 
sequences {8n} and {sn} was first investigated by Iglehart (1963). 
He showed that 8 1 ::; 8 n ::; M < 00 and 2s1 -
81 < Sn, n =2,3, ... , 
provided that G1(x), assumed convex, attains its minimum at 81 < 
00. (Otherwise the optimal policy is never to order.) Using these 
bounds, he proved the following result. 
Theorem 1.2 (Iglehart, 1963) Limn-+aoEn(x) = E(x) exists and 
the convergence is uniform in any finite interval. 
As a corollary to this theorem, it can be seen that the limit func-
tion E( x) satisfies the functional equation 
E(u) = miny~u{c(y - u) + r(y) + a lao E(y - x)b(x)dx} 
Also 
limn-+coGn(y) == G(y) = cy + r(y) + Q 1
00 E(y - x)b(x)dx 
attains its minimum at every limit point 8 of the sequence {8n }. 
Since it is the limit of K-convex functions, G(y) is also K-convex, 
and any limit point s of the sequence {sn} satisfies G( s) = K + G(8) 
where 8 is a limit point ofthe sequence {8n }. The optimal policy for 
the infinite-horizon problem is therefore of (s, 8) type. 
However, convexity of r(y) and other assumptions made above 
for the n-period model are not sufficient to guarantee that G(x) has 
a unique minimum. This becomes an issue in actual computations of 
optimal policies as we shall see in Chapter 4. 

12 
CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1.3 
Positive Lead Times, 
Continuous Review Systems 
Under the assumptions of the classical model, (s, S) policies remain 
optimal in the presence of a constant, positive lead time between 
the placement of a replenishment order and its receipt. This delay, 
denoted by L, is assumed to be an integral multiple of the period 
length. Thus an order placed at the beginning of period n is received 
at the beginning of period n + L. (In this section, we number the 
periods forward.) We assume n ~ L. 
Using a convention of Beckman (1965), we can charge the system 
in period n, as a function of the inventory position, the expected cost 
in period n + L, discounted for L periods. This is workable because 
all orders that are outstanding at the beginning of period n would 
have arrived by period n + L, and no order placed after period n 
would arrive by period n + L. Thus the inventory on hand at the 
beginning of period n + L is determined by inventory posi tion at the 
beginning of period n and demand during the lead time. In view of 
this observation, it is seen that the optimality of (s, S) policies, oper-
ating on inventory position, extends to the case of constant, positive 
lead times. 
Optimality of (s, S) policies also extends to the continuous re-
view system introduced at the beginning of the chapter. This system 
can be regarded as a periodic review system with random period 
lengths {Xn , n = 1,2, ... }. The inventory position remains the same 
throughout a period; it is depleted by batch demands at period ends. 
These modifications are inessential, however, to the proof of optimal-
ity of (s,S) policies, provided that the sequences {Xn} and {Yn} of 
period lengths and periodic demands are pairwise independent. Also, 
we can replace the discrete charging of holding and shortage costs at 
the end of a period with continuous charging during a period as a 
function of inventory position. Again the proof of optimality is not 
affected provided that the holding and shortage cost rate functions 
are convex. 

1.2. STATIONARY ANALYSIS 
13 
In terms of continuous review systems with constant, positive lead 
times, Beckman's convention still works. Although the lead time is 
not now an integral multiple of the length of a period, inventory on 
hand at time t + L, t ~ L, will still be equal to inventory position at 
time t minus the demand during (t, t + L] (see Section 3.2). There-
fore, we can again charge the system at time t, as a function of the 
inventory position, the expected cost rate at time t + L. 
Finally, we note that the expected discounted cost criterion can be 
replaced by the expected total cost (a = 1) or the expected average 
cost criterion for the finite-horizon models. In what follows we will 
be concerned exclusively with the infinite-horizon, stationary model 
under the long-run average cost criterion. 
1.2 
Stationary Analysis 
Having established the optimality of (s, S) type policies, the next 
problem is the determination of an optimal (s, S) policy. Tradition-
ally, there have been two main approaches here. The first is based on 
the dynamic programming formulation of the previous section in a 
computational setting. This approach is used exclusively for the peri-
odic review version of the model. It has been well-explored since the 
mid 1960s within the framework of Markov decision process (MDP) 
models. It can be applied to problems with a finite or infinite plan-
ning horizon, under one of a wide range of optimization criteria, using 
stationary or time-varying data. A number of efficient computational 
algorithms are also available for the solution of these models (cf. Hey-
man and Sobel, 1984). However, the MDP approach is not routinely 
applicable in actual practice, except in situations where the setup 
cost can be ignored (i.e., c(z) = cz in (1.1)). In this case, under a 
set of mild assumptions, the periodic review model admits a myopic 
optimal policy. This amounts to the reduction of the multi period dy-
namic problem to a forward sequence of one-period, static problems 
of the classical newsboy type. (See Heyman and Sobel, 1984, Chapter 
3.) 

14 
CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 
The second approach has come to be known as stationary anal-
ysis. It involves the determination of the limiting distribution of 
on-hand inventory under an (s, S) policy. Using this distribution, an 
expected cost rate function is constructed with sand S as decision 
variables. Minimization of this function then determines the opti-
mal (s, S) policy. The approach is applicable to both periodic and 
continuous review systems. In fact, as pointed out before, the peri-
odic review system can be viewed as a special case of the continuous 
review system. 
1.2.1 
Renewal Theory and Inventory Distributions 
Stationary analysis of the inventory systems introduced at the be-
ginning of this chapter is greatly helped by renewal theoretic con-
cepts. We review these2 in chapter 2. Under the assumptions made 
about the demand process, the sequences {Xn' 
n = 1,2, ... } and 
{Yn , n = 1,2, ... } representing interarrival times and demand batch 
sizes form independent renewal processes. We denote by N(u, u + t) 
the number of arrivals (demands) during (u,u + t], and by R(t) and 
r( t) the renewal function and the renewal density, respectively, of the 
sequence of demand batch sizes. Also, if D( u, u + t) represents the 
total demand during (u,u + t], {D(u,u + t), t 2: O} is a cumulative 
renewal process. Inventory cycles are defined as first passage times 
(of the level S - s) of this process. Under the assumption of complete 
backlogging, they in turn form a renewal process. Thus the inventory 
position process {Ip(t), t 2: O} is regenerative (see Figure 1.1). Each 
time an order is placed, an inventory cycle ends, inventory position 
is raised to S, and a new cycle of the same probabilistic structure 
begins. 
Time-dependent and limiting distributions of {Ip(t), t 2: O} can 
be determined easily by conditioning on its imbedded renewal process 
of inventory cycles (section 3.1). For the process {I(t), t 2: O} that 
2Chapter 2 provides an informal review of what is needed in renewal theory. It 
also contains some new material. Readers not familiar with basic renewal theory 
may wish to refer to Chapter 2 as they read the rest of this chapter.

represents on-hand inventory, the easiest way is to proceed on the 
basis of the relationship I( t + L) = Ip( t) - D( t, t + L) which holds 
under the assumption of constant lead times. Note that D(t, t + 
L) represents the total demand during a lead time that does not 
necessarily start with an arrival point. (If u is an arrival point, we 
write N( u, u + t) == N(t) and D( u, u + t) == D(t).) This leads to 
a complication in that the processes {Ip(t), 
t ~ O} and {D(t, t + 
L), t ~ O} are not, in general, independent. Independence holds 
in finite time only when the interarrival time distribution is negative 
exponential. Accordingly, to obtain the distribution of I(t), one needs 
the joint distribution of Ip(t) and D(t, t + L). This in turn depends 
on the joint distribution of N(t) and N(t,t + L), representing the 
numbers of occurrences in the demand process during (0, t] and (t, t + 
L]. This joint distribution is given in section 2.1. (It is extended in 
section 6.1 to the joint distribution of N(t), N(t,t + u), and N(t + 
u, t+u+v) for the study of systems with two-shipment order arrivals.) 
Based on this background, we determine in section 3.2 the time-
dependent and limiting distributions of {Ip(t), D(t, t + L)}, I(t) and 
D(t, t + L). One consequence of the results obtained is that Ip(t) and 
D( t, t + L) are asymptotically independent. Thus if we denote by Ip 
and J5(L) the inventory position and demand during a lead time in a 
stationary process, their marginal distributions can be combined in 
accordance with I = Ip - J5(L) to obtain the limiting distribution of 
on-hand inventory. 
The stationary distribution of inventory position turns out to be 
independent of the interarrival time distribution; it depends only on 
the renewal function R(t) and the renewal density r(t) of the sequence 
{Yn , n = 1,2, ... } of batch sizes. This has a simplifying effect on the 
optimization problems (that we discuss in chapters 4 and 5) in zero-
lead-time systems where I(t) == Ip(t). On the other hand, the limiting 
distribution of the lead time demand depends on the distributions of 
both interarrival times and demand batch sizes. 
The complicated form of the lead time demand distribution is 
the main cause of the difficulties encountered in the optimization of 

16 
CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 
inventory systems with positive lead times. To overcome such diffi-
culties, this distribution is sometimes approximated in the literature 
by a suitable distribution. In this context, the normal distribution 
is often found useful, its relevance being assured by the central limit 
theorem when the lead time is reasonably large (i.e., as compared to 
the mean interarrival time.) Other distributional forms can be used 
to obtain a better approximation than that can be provided by the 
normal distribution. However, any such choice should be based on 
conceptually firm grounds, not on arbitrary choices. 
1.2.2 Derived Measures-The Cost Rate Function 
Time-dependent and limiting distributions of inventory position, 
lead time demand and on-hand inventory provide a wealth of infor-
mation about the operating characteristics of the inventory systems 
under consideration. They also form the basis for the construction 
of a number of other distributions and measures of effectiveness that 
arise in relation to certain design and control problems. This wealth 
of information is not available through the dynamic programming 
approach outlined before. 
Of all the different secondary measures that can be defined, we 
emphasize in what follows the stationary fill rate and the cost rate 
function. Distribution of the customer waiting time is also discussed 
in section 3.3 as a topic of independent interest. 
The stationary fill rate, F(O), is the probability in steady state 
that on-hand inventory is positive. Its complement, F(O), is the 
stationary stockout probability. Behavior of the fill rate as ~ = S - s 
varies will be of considerable interest in the sequel in relation to 
optimization problems. We show in section 3.3 that F(O) is monotone 
increasing in ~ if the expected cycle length (Le., l+R(~)) is log-
concave in~. For the continuous review system under immediate 
deliveries, this condition turns out to be also necessary. That the 
fill rate is monotone increasing in ~ may appear to be self-evident 
without any condition. Unfortunately, such is not the case and the 

1.2. STATIONARY ANALYSIS 
17 
condition that the expected cycle length be log-concave is not a weak 
one. The same condition also arises as a unimodality condition for 
the stationary cost rate function (cf. Stidham, 1977, 1986). 
The most common measure of effectiveness used in relation to the 
models under consideration is the stationary cost rate function that is 
obtained by imposing a cost structure on the system in steady state. 
In what follows, we choose a simple representation involving a fixed 
ordering cost and linear holding and shortage costs. The cost rate 
function then represents the total cost (ordering, holding, and back-
logging) per unit time in steady state over an infinite horizon. As we 
noted before, if we ignore the ordering cost, myopic policies turn out 
to be optimal over an infinite horizon (or over a finite horizon with an 
appropriate salvage value) under an average cost or a discounted total 
cost criterion. Positive ordering (setup) cost is therefore an essential 
complication. vVe choose a time-average cost criterion, although a 
discounted total cost criterion is also possible. 
As mentioned, a sufficient condition for the unimodality of the 
cost rate function is that l+R(x) be log-concave (Stidham, 1977, 
1986). Unfortunately, this condition excludes large classes of demand 
distributions that may arise in practice. Also, it is not a necessary 
condition for unimodality except when the lead time is zero in the 
continuous review system. On the other hand, when this condition 
holds, the cost rate function is unimodal for any set of values for 
the ordering, holding, and shortage cost parameters. One suspects 
that the condition that induces unimodality in this sense should also 
result in other nice properties. Actually, unimodality of the cost rate 
function turns out to be equivalent to the property that the fill rate 
is monotone increasing in Ll, and to the property that the optimal 
reorder point for a given Ll is monotone decreasing in Ll. All these 
properties hold if 1 + R( x) is log-concave. These facts are proved in 
Chapter 4. 

18 
CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 
1.2.2 
Exact and Approximately Optimal Policies 
The stationary optimal (s, S) policy can be determined in principle by 
finding the global minimum of the cost rate function. However, com-
putational difficulties make the exact models unattractive in practice. 
This has motivated several approaches for the determination of ap-
proximately optimal (s, S) policies that require less computational ef-
fort and demand information. Most of these approaches are still too 
complicated for practical implementation, however. One exception 
is the power approximation for periodic review systems (Ehrhardt, 
1979; Ehrhardt and Mosier, 1984), which is distribution-free and eas-
ily computable. 
In order to be widely usable in practice, any approximation must 
fulfill two general requirements: 1) it must be accurate for a pre-
specified, wide range of parameter settings, and 2) it must be distribu-
tion-free and easily computable. In relation to the first requirement, it 
should be emphasized that by accurate we mean practically the same 
as the optimal policy. Under most parameter settings, the cost rate 
function turns out to be flat around its global minimum. Accordingly, 
an approximation error of more than one or two percent relative cost 
increase should be considered excessive. It is important that the 
range of parameter values for which such accuracy is achieved by an 
approximation is specified. Clearly, any approximation will perform 
well under some parameter settings and fail under others. 
In view of these considerations, perhaps the most promising ap-
proach to developing accurate approximations to stationary control 
policies that require minimal computational effort and demand infor-
mation is the one based on asymptotic renewal theory (cf. Roberts, 
1962; Ehrhardt, 1979; Ehrhardt and Mosier, 1984; Tijms and Gron-
evelt, 1984; Sahin and Sinha, 1987). In Chapter 5, we review some 
of these approximations. Our primary concern in section 5.1 is with 
the identification of simple, distribution-free conditions under which 
asymptotic approximations are accurate for continuous and periodic 
review systems with zero lead times. Under these conditions, we 
compare the performances of various approximations with those of 

1.2. STATIONARY ANALYSIS 
19 
the optimal policies using gamma, Weibull, truncated normal, inverse 
Gaussian, and log-normal distributions for demand. In addition to 
the approximations developed in the monograph, we test in Chap-
ter 5 the accuracy of the modified power approximation of Ehrhardt 
and Mosier (1984) using a wide range of demand distributions and 
parameter settings. 
As noted above, computational problems are more serious for pos-
itive lead times due to the complicated form of the lead time demand 
distribution. Substitution of a more tractable approximating dis-
tribution is often accompanied in the literature by other simplifica-
tions, involving the measure of effectiveness being used. Most of these 
are ad-hoc adjustments achieved by droping certain terms that are 
deemed insignificant. These simplifications are often unnecessary as 
they do not really simplify the computational problem. 
In section 5.2, we discuss the computation and vaidation of opti-
mal policy approximations under positive lead times that are based 
on: 1) the replacement in the cost rate function of the renewal func-
tion R( x) with its linear asymptote, and 2) the normal distribution 
for the lead time demand distribution as an asymptotic approxima-
tion for large lead times. The first represents a continuation of the 
approach used for the zero lead time model. The second involves the 
fitting of a normal distribution to the asymptotic mean and variance 
of the lead time demand distribution. 
To validate the various approximations and some of the theo-
retical findings, it is also necessary to compute the corresponding 
optimal policies. These computations are based on simple search 
routines that exploit the sufficient optimality conditions established 
in Chapter 4. Also required for this process is the accurate numerical 
computation of the renewal function and related measures. For this 
purpose, we use the generalized cubic splining algorithm of McCona-
logue (1981) which is basically designed to compute convolutions of 
a probability distribution. The renewal function is computed from 
the series representation with an appropriate convergence criterion. 
Other renewal-theoretic functions and terms that appear in the cost

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 
rate function and the optimality conditions are computed by inte-
grating the appropriate spline representations. 
1.2.3 
Special Cases and Generalizations 
Important simplifications can be achieved and sharper results can be 
obtained when the lead time is zero or when all batch sizes are unity 
(i.e., the unit-demands model). For the continuous review system 
with immediate deliveries, it turns out that the fill rate is monotone 
increasing in ~, the optimal reorder point for given ~ is monotone 
decreasing in ~ and the cost rate function is unimodal for all possible 
values of the cost parameters if and only if 1 + R( x) is log-concave 
(section 4.2.1). Log-concavity of 1 + R(x) was first shown to be both 
necessary and sufficient for the unimodality of the cost rate function 
in Stidham (1977). This condition is not necessary for periodic review 
systems and systems with positive lead times. In periodic review 
systems with zero lead times, unimodality of the cost rate function 
and the monotonicity of the fill rate and the reorder level prevail 
also under the condition that the renewal density r( x) is concave 
increasing (section 4.2.2). Note that if r(x) is monotone decreasing 
then R( x) is concave and therefore log-concave. However, if r( x) 
is increasing then R( x) is convex (increasing) and need not be log-
concave. Optimization of continuous and periodic-review systems 
under zero lead times is considered in detail in Chapter 5. 
In unit-demand systems, orders can be placed precisely when the 
inventory position reaches the reorder point. This reduces the (s, S) 
policy effectively to a reorder-point, order-quantity policy. Another 
feature that is also unique to these systems is the fact that the sta-
tionary distribution of inventory position is uniform. Together with 
a constant procurement lead time, these characteristics imply, as we 
show in Chapter 4, a unimodal cost rate function without additional 
assumptions. As a consequence, optimization of the stationary unit-
demands model is almost trivial (section 5.1.1). In the case of positive 
lead times, we approximate in section 5.2.1 the lead time demand dis-
tribution by a normal distribution with the same mean and variance 

1.2. STATIONARY ANALYSIS 
21 
as the stationary distribution of lead time demand. The same ap-
proximation is also used for the optimization of the general model in 
section 5.2.2. 
In Chapter 6, we consider some extensions of the basic continuous-
review model. These include systems where an order may arrive 
in two shipments, systems with ordering delays, and systems with 
random lead times. In spite of the fact that an (s, S) policy may 
no longer be optimal for these systems, our discussion is limited to 
their operating characteristics under an (s, S) policy. The first two 
extensions are generalizations of the recent works of Moinzadeh and 
Lee (1989) and Weiss (1988). For the model with random lead times, 
we use an approach based on Finch (1961) (cf. Sahin, 1983a) to 
construct a formal solution for the general model and obtain explicit 
results in some special cases. 

Chapter 2 
Renewal Theory 
Background 
A renewal process may be defined as a sequence {Xn' n = 1,2, ... } of 
independent, identically distributed random variables that are placed 
one after another. We may think of Xn as the interval from the n-1st 
to the n-th occurrences of an event, although Xn may have nothing to 
do with time and may not separate events as such. In this chapter, 
we provide an informal review of the basic concepts and results in 
renewal theory and introduce the interval distributions of interest in 
the sequel. We also report some new results, both theoretical and 
empirical, that are required for later use. 
2.1 
Basic Theory 
Consider the sequence { X n , n = 1,2, ... } of independent, identically 
distributed random variables. Let 
G(x) = P[Xn ~ x], n = 1,2, ... x ~ 0, 
(2.1) 

24 
CHAPTER 2. RENEWAL THEORY BACKGROUND 
denote the common c.dJ. of the sequence. We assume that G( x) 
is absolutely continuous with p.dJ. g( x). This assumption is not 
restrictive as there is a parallel theory involving discrete represen-
tations. We denote by Jl and a 2 the mean and variance of G( x). 
Define 
Sn = Xl + X 2 + ... + X n, n = 1,2, .... 
(2.2) 
If Xn is interpreted as the time interval separating the n-1st and n-th 
occurrences of an event, then Sn would be the waiting time until the 
n-th occurrence. A renewal process may be defined, alternatively, as 
the sequence { Sn, n = 1,2, ... } of partial sums. Clearly, E[Sn] = nJl 
and Var[Sn] = na2• The c.dJ. and p.d.f. of Sn can be expressed in 
terms of the convolutions of G(x) and g(x)j thus we have 
Gn(x) = P[Sn ~ x] = lax Gn-l(x - u)g( u)du, n = 2,3, ... , 
(2.3) 
gn(x) = lax gn-I(X - u)g(u)du, n = 2,3, ... , 
(2.4) 
with GI(x) == G(x) and gl(X) == g(x). 
2.1.1 
Number of Renewals 
Appealing to the events separated by intervals interpretation, let 
N(t) denote the number of occurrences during (0, t] where the ori-
gin coincides with an occurrence that is not counted. Evidently: 
{N(t) < n} 
¢::=} {Sn > t}. Therefore, P[N(t) < n] = 1 - Gn(t), 
and: 
P[N(t) = n] = Gn(t) - Gn+! (t), n = 0,1,... . 
(2.5) 
where Go(t) = 1 if t ~ ° 
and Go(t) = ° 
if t < 0. This establishes the 
distribution of the number of occurrences over time. 
More generally, we may define N( u, u + t) as the number of occur-
rences during (u, u + t] where u ~ ° 
is not necessarily an occurrence 
point. N( u, u + t) == N(t), if u is an occurrence point. Let 
w(u,tjn,k) = P[N(u) = n,N(u,u+t) = k], 
u ~ 0, t ~ 0, n, k = 0,1, ... , 
(2.6) 

2.1. BASIC THEORY 
25 
denote the joint distribution of the numbers of occurrences during 
(0, uJ and (u, u + tJ. We have: 
Lemma 2.1 
w( u, t; n, k) = 
1 - G( u + t), 
n = 0, k = 0, 
loU gn(y)[l - G( u + t - y)Jdy, n ~ 1, k = 0, 
lot g( U + y)[Gk-l(t - y) - Gk(t - y)Jdy, 
n = 0, k ~ 1, 
l:o gn(X) l~og(U - x + y) 
{Gk-l(t - y) - Gk(t - y)}dy dx, 
n ~ 1, k ~ l. 
(2.7) 
Proof For n = k = 0, we must have the first interval extend beyond 
u + t. For n ~ 1, k = 0, the n-th occurrence must take place before 
u (with probability gn(y)dy, y < u) followed by an occurrence-free 
interval of length at least u + t - y. For n = 0, k ~ 1, we need the 
first interval terminating after u, say at u+y, y < t (with probability 
g(u+y)dy) followed by exactly k-1 occurrences during t-y. Finally, 
for n ~ 1, k ~ 1, the n-th occurrence must take place before time u, 
with probability gn(x)dx, x < u; the following interval should be of 
length> u-x, say u-x+y, y < t (this has probability g(u-x+y)dy) 
and, there must occur exactly k - 1 events during t - y. 
The distribution of N( u, u + t) can be obtained from (2.7) as a 
marginal distribution. If we let 
00 
k(t) = L gn(t), t ~ 0, 
(2.8) 
n=l 
we find 
P[N(u,u+t) = OJ = 1-G(u+t)+ lou k(y)[l-G(u+t-y)Jdy, (2.9) 

26 
CHAPTER 2. RENEWAL THEORY BACKGROUND 
and, for k ~ 1: 
P[N( u, u + t) = k] = lot g( U + y)[Gk-l (t - y) - Gk(t - y)]dy 
+ 1:0 k(x) l~u g(u - x + y)[Gk-l(t - y) - Gk(t - y)]dy dx . 
(2.10) 
Note that for u = 0, these reduce to (2.5). 
2.1.2 
Renewal Function and Renewal Density 
Let K(t) denote the expected number of occurrences during (0, t]. 
We have, by (2.5): 
00 
K(t) = L n[Gn(t) - Gn+1 (t)] 
n=O 
00 
(2.11) 
K(t) is called the renewal function. Its first derivative, given by (2.8), 
is the renewal density. Since gn( t)dt is the probability that the n-th 
occurrence takes place during (t, t + dt], k(t)dt can be interpreted as 
the probability that an occurrence takes place during (t, t + dt]. This 
observation helps verify the following integral equation on k(t): 
k(t) = g(t) + lot k(u)g(t - u)du. 
(2.12) 
For in order to have a renewal at time t, either the first interval must 
terminate at about t, with probability g(t)dt, or there must be a 
renewal before t, say at u, with probability k( u )du, followed by an 
interval of length t - u. On integrating both sides of (2.12), we obtain 
a similar integral equation on the renewal function K(t); thus: 
K(t) = G(t) + lot K(t - u)g(u)du. 
(2.13) 

2.1. BASIC THEORY 
27 
Another measure of interest, the variance of the number of oc-
curences over time, can be expressed in terms of the renewal function 
and the renewal density as: t 
Var[N(t)] = 2 lot K(u)k(t - u)du + K(t) - K2(t). 
(2.14) 
2.1.3 
Recurrence Times 
In addition to the renewal density, renewal function and the variance 
function, it becomes necessary in many applications to characterize 
the random variables representing the time until the next renewal 
point and the time since the last renewal point at time t. These are 
commonly referred to as backward and forward recurrence times. 
Let Ut and vt denote, respectively, the backward and forward 
recurrence times at time t. Denote by Ut( x) and Vt( x) their p.d.f. 's 
and by Ut ( x) and vt( x) their c.d.f's. If there is no occurrence during 
(0, t], then Ut = t; thus: P[Ut = t] = 1 - G(t). For x < t, the p.d.f. 
of Ut is given by: 
Ut ( x) = k (t - x) [1 - G ( x )] , x < t. 
(2.15) 
To verify this, note that in order for Ut to be about x, x < t, there 
must be a renewal at about t - x, followed by an interval of length 
at least x. Similarly, the density function of vt can be written as: 
Vt(x) = g(t + x) + lot k(t - u)g(u + x)du. 
(2.16) 
For vt would be about x if either the first interval terminates at about 
t + x, or there is an occurrence at about t - u, followed by an interval 
of length about u + x, 0 < u < t. 
t Let II(z,8) = =::0 zn fooo e-et[Gn(t) - Gn +1(t)]dt, Izl:::; 1, Re(8) > O. 
We have II(z,8) = [1 - ..,(8)]/[8[1 - z..,(8)]], where ..,(8) = fooo e-etg(t)dt. This 
results in d2 II(z, 8)/dz2 Iz=1 = 2..,2(8)/[8(1 - ..,(8))2] as the Laplace transform of 
E[N 2(t)] - E[N(t)]. The result follows on inversion and from the definition of 
varIance. 

28 
CHAPTER 2. RENEWAL THEORY BACKGROUND 
2.1.4 
Examples 
The above distributions and measures can be expressed in explicit, 
easily computable forms for exponential and exponential-related in-
terval distributions. These include the mixed-exponential and Er-
lang distributions and the wider class of phase-type distributions (cf. 
Neuts, 1981, Ch. 2). However, there are computational difficulties in 
other cases. To compute the renewal function or the renewal density, 
for example, either an infinite series of iterated convolutions of G( x) 
or g(x) must be evaluated or an integral equation of the type (2.12) 
must be solved. We discuss these issues in Section 2 in relation to a 
number of interval distributions of practical interest. Here, we review 
some classical examples for illustration. 
1. Exponential Intervals 
For g( x) = Ae-AX, x ~ 0, we have: 
(2.17) 
Therefore: 
(2.18) 
and the renewal process reduces to the Poisson process. It is easily 
seen that P[Ut = t] = e-At, Ut(x) = Ae-AX, x < t, and Vt(x) = 
Ae-AX, x ~ 0. Thus Vt( x) == g( x) for every t, a property enjoyed 
only by the Poisson process. 
Also easily verifiable are the results that k(t) = A and K(t) = At. 
Thus the renewal density is constant and the renewal function IS 
linear-properties that are also unique to the Poisson process. 
2. Erlang Intervals 
Forg(x) = A2xe-AX , x ~ O,wefind: k(x) = A(1-e-2AX)/2, 
and K(x) = (2AX - 1 + e-2AX)/4. Results that are relatively easy 

2.1. BASIC THEORY 
29 
to compute can also be obtained for the k-stage Erlang distribution 
with p.d.f.: 
(AX )k-l 
g( x) = Ae-AX (k _ I)!' x ~ 0, 
(2.19) 
which is a special gamma density with k ~ 1 integer. It is easy to 
see that this is the p.d.f. of the sum of k Li.d. random variables 
with a common exponential distribution. A further generality, which 
again produces easily computable results, is obtained by allowing the 
parameter A of the exponential distribution to change. Thus the 
renewal interval is the sum of k independent stages, the i-th having 
an exponential distribution with parameter Ai. 
3. Mixed-Exponential Intervals 
For g(x) = 71'Ale-A1X + (1-7l')A2e-A2x, x ~ 0, 0 ~ 71' ~ 1, we 
find: 
(2.20) 
where J.L = 71'jAl + (1- 7l')/A2, Cl = 7l'(1-7l')(Al- A2)2/(AIA2) and 
C2 = AlA2J.L. 
More generally, results for all renewal-theoretic measures can be 
developed without much difficulty for the k-stage mixed-exponential 
p.d.f.: 
k 
k 
g(x) = 'L:7I'iAie-AiX, x~O, 'L:7l'i=1. 
(2.21) 
i=l 
i=l 
If 7l'i > 0 then the stages are in parallel; with probability 7l'i, the only 
stage traversed is stage i, having an exponential distribution with pa-
rameter Ai . If, on the other hand, we chose 7l'j = TIi:f:j Ai/(Ai - Aj), 
then (2.21) becomes the p.d.f. of the sum of k independent, expo-
nential random variables, the generalization noted in the previous 
example with k stages in series. 
The form (2.21) is thus associated with the well-known method of 
stages employed in the study of non-Markovian processes (cf. Cox and 
Smith, 1961). It allows for considerable flexibility and computational 

30 
CHAPTER 2. RENEWAL THEORY BACKGROUND 
facility in applications. (For more recent related work, see Whitt, 
1982). In turn, the p.d.f. (2.21) is a member of the class of phase-
type distributions, introduced and widely applied by Neuts (1981), 
that are again constructed through exponential forms. 
2.1.5 
Monotonicity Properties 
In this section, we note some monotonicity properties of the renewal 
function and related measures that we shall use in the sequel. Un-
fortunately, very little can be said about these properties, on general 
grounds, beyond the fact that K(x) is monotone increasing. How-
ever, if G(x) belongs to the class of decreasing failure rate (DFR) 
distributions, then k(x) turns out to be monotone decreasing. 
A random variable, X with c.d.f. G(x) is said to have a DFR 
distribution on x ~ 0 if the failure rate (or the hazard rate) given by 
g(x) 
h(x) = 1 - G(x)' 
(2.22) 
is monotone decreasing on x ~ o. Increasing failure rate (IFR) dis-
tributions are defined in a similar way. Thus G( x) is IFR if h( x) 
is monotone increasing. It can be seen that the two-stage mixed-
exponential distribution of Example 3 above, and, in general, the k-
stage mixed-exponential distribution having p.d.f. (2.21) with 1ri > 0 
are DFR distributions, while the 2-stage Erlang distribution of Ex-
ample 2 is IFR. In the case of the exponential distribution, h( x) = oX 
satisfies both properties simultaneously. The theory of distributions 
with monotone failure rates is developed in Barlow et al. (1963) (see 
also Barlow and Proschan, 1975). 
We now state and sketch the proof of a result due to Brown (1980). 
Lemma 2.2 If G(x) is DFR then k(x) is monotone decreasing on 
x ~ 0 and J( (x) is concave. 

2.1. BASIC THEORY 
31 
Proof Through a complicated construction, Brown (1980) shows that 
if G( x) is DFR, then both Ut and Vt are stochastically increasing in 
t; that is, 
P[Ut :S x] > P[Ut+s :S x], s ~ 0, 
(2.23) 
and similarity for Vt. On the other hand, we can see by (2.12), (2.15), 
and (2.22) that 
k(t) = E[h(Ut )]. 
(2.24) 
N ow since h( x) is decreasing and Ut is stochastically increasing, it 
follows that h( Ut ) is stochastically decreasing and k( t) is decreasing. 
This in turn implies that K( t) is concave. 
As an example, it can be seen that the renewal density of the 
mixed-exponential distribution of Example 3 above is decreasing. 
This is clear in the case of two stages; it also holds for p.dJ. (2.21) 
with 7ri > o. 
The above result relates the monotonicity of the failure rate func-
tion to that of the renewal density for the DFR class. Unfortunately, 
G( x) IFR does not imply that k( x) is increasing. And little else is 
known about the extent to which the monotonicity properties of a 
distribution function are inherited in some way by its renewal pro-
cess. The monotonicity of the renewal density, when it prevails, is 
more easily related to the stochastic monotonicity of the forward and 
backward recurrence times. To this end, we have the following. 
Lemma 2.3 Ut and Vt are stochastically decreasing (increasing) in 
t ~ 0 if k( t) is increasing (decreasing) in t ~ o. 
Proof We have by (2.15), for s ~ 0, x < t: 
P[Ut :S x] - P[Ut+s :S x] = lox [1 - G( u)][k(t - u) - k(t + s - u)]du. 
(2.25) 
Clearly, this is :S 0 (~ 0) and therefore Ut is stochastically de-
creasing (increasing) if k(t) is increasing (decreasing). For Vt, we have 

32 
CHAPTER 2. RENEWAL THEORY BACKGROUND 
from (2.16): 
P[vt ~ x] = K(t+X)-K(t)[l-G(X)]-lox K(t+x-u)g(u)du, (2.26) 
and 
rt 
rt+x 
Vt(x)=g(t+x)+ Jo k(u)g(t+x-u)du± Jo 
k(u)g(t+x-u)du 
t+x 
= k(t + x) - Jt 
k(u)g(t + x - u)du. 
(2.27) 
From (2.26) we get 
d 
dtP[vt ~ x] = Vt(x) - k(t)[l - G(x)]. 
(2.28) 
If k( t) is increasing, then (2.27) implies 
Vt(X) 2: k(t + x)[l - G(x)] 2: k(t)[l - G(x)], 
(2.29) 
and by (2.28) vt is stochastically decreasing. If k( t) is decreasing, 
then(2.27) implies 
Vt(X) ~ k(t + x)[l- G(x)] ~ k(t)[l - G(x)], 
(2.30) 
and by (2.28) vt is stochastically increasing. 
These properties can easily be verified on the examples 2 and 3 
above where the renewal densities are monotone. 
The last monotonicity result that we shall need in the sequel con-
cerns the ratio 4>(t) == K(t)/k(t). In general, not much can be said 
about the shape of 4>(t). Below is a sufficient condition for it to be 
increasing. 
Lemma 2.4 <fJ( t) is increasing in t 2: 0 if k( t) is decreasing or con-
cave increasing in t 2: o. 

2.1. BASIC THEORY 
33 
Proof As K(t) is increasing, that ¢(t) is increasing in t ~ 0 if k(t) 
is decreasing is clear. Assume that k( t) is concave increasing. Then, 
K(t) is convex and ¢(t) is pseudoconvext on t > o. The latter follows 
easily from definitions. For since K(t) is convex and k(t) is concave, 
we have for any tl, t2: 
(2.31) 
and 
(2.32) 
To show (tl - t2)¢'(t2) ~ 0 =? ¢(tt) ~ ¢(t2), we note that, provided 
k(t2) > 0, the first inequality means: 
(2.33) 
If we use (2.31) and (2.32) in this, we find K(tl)k(t2) ~ K(t2)k(tt) 
or ¢(tl ) ~ ¢(t2) as required and ¢(t) is pseudo convex on t > o. 
Since ¢(O) = 0 and ¢(t) ~ 0, t ~ 0, ¢(t) cannot decrease on 
t > 0 as this would contradict its pseudoconvexity. This completes 
the proof. 
For the mixed-exponential distribution of Example 3 with any 
number of stages, k( t) is decreasing and for the 2-stage Erlang distri-
bution of Example 2, k( t) is concave increasing. Therefore, K( t)/ k( t) 
is increasing in both cases. 
2.1.6 
Cumulative and Delayed Processes 
The cumulative renewal process is constructed by associating with the 
n-th interval, X n , of a renewal process a second random variable, Yn . 
The second sequence, {Yn , n = 1,2, ... }, is also assumed to be i.i.d. 
t A real valued differentiable function </I(t) is said to be pseudo convex on an 
open convex set X if (iI - t2)t'V</I(t2) ~ 0 implies </I(t1) ~ </I(h) for any iI EX, 
hEX (Mangasarian, 1965). Every local minimum of a pseudo convex function is 
also global (see, for example, Avriel, 1976, Ch.6). 

34 
CHAPTER 2. RENEWAL THEORY BACKGROUND 
and may be considered to form a renewal process by itself. In general, 
the two sequences need not be independent; pairwise independence 
of {Xn, Yn, n = 1,2, ... } is sufficient for tractability. Also, random 
variables of the second sequence may be allowed to take any real 
value. However, we shall restrict ourselves to independent sequences 
of non-negative valued random variables. We denote by F( x), x ~ 0, 
the common c.d.f. of the second sequence. 
We may think of Yn as the reward received at the i-th occurrence 
of the renewal process {Xn' n = 1,2, ... }. One quantity of interest 
is the cumulative reward over time. This can be expressed, with 
reference to the interval (0, t], as: 
N(t) 
Z ( t) = 2: Yn , t ~ 0. 
(2.34) 
n=l 
The process {Zt, 
t ~ o} is called a cumulative renewal process, a 
compound renewal process, or a renewal reward process. The distribu-
tion function of Z(t) can be determined through the first principles 
to be: 
00 
P[Z(t) ::; xJ = 2: P[N(t) = nJP[Z(t) ~ xIN(t) = nJ 
n=O 
00 
= 2: [Gn(t) - Gn+1(t)JFn(x), t ~ 0, x ~ 0. 
n=O 
It can also be seen that E[Z(t)J = ]((t) E[YnJ and 
Var[Z(t)J = ]((t) Var[YnJ + (E[yn])2Var[N(t)J. 
(2.35) 
(2.36) 
A compound renewal process will be used in the sequel to describe 
the demand process. Thus if {Xn, n = 1,2, ... } represents the inter-
demand times (interarrival times of costumers) and {Yn , n = 1,2, ... } 
the batch sizes demanded, then Z(t) would be the total demand dur-
ing (0, tJ. In this context and in other applications, it becomes also 
necessary to characterize the time until Z( t) exceeds, for the first 

2.1. BASIC THEORY 
35 
time, a given quantity. Thus, let Tw = inf{t: Z(t) > w}. This is 
the first passage time of level w. Clearly, {Tw ~ x} {:} {Z(x) 2:: w}. 
Therefore: 
00 
P[Tw ~ xl = 1- 2:)Gn(X)-Gn+1(x)lFn(w), w 2:: 0, x 2:: o. (2.37) 
n=O 
It turns out that 
00 
E[Twl = IL L Fn(w) = 1L[1 + Q(w)], 
(2.38) 
n=O 
where Q(t) is the renewal function associated with the sequence 
{Yn , 
n = 1,2, ... }. Note that in this case the renewal process does 
not refer to time. 
In what follows, we shall also need the joint distribution of Tw and 
Vw, the latter being the forward recurrence time at time w, defined 
with respect to the renewal process {Yn , 
n = 1,2, ... }. vVe denote 
the related joint density by: 
£w(x, y)dx dy = P[x < Tw ~ x + dx, y < Vw ~ Y + dy], 
x 2:: 0, y 2:: o. 
It can be seen that: 
(2.39) 
(2.40) 
The delayed renewal process is constructed by treating the first 
interval of an ordinary renewal process as exceptional. Thus the 
sequence {Xn' n = 1,2, ... } is still mutually independent; however, 
P[XI ~ xl = G(x) is different from the common distribution G(x) 
of the subsequent intervals for n 2:: 2. Such processes are of both 
theoretical and applied interest. They arise naturally, for example, if 
the origin does not coincide with an occurrence. 
Allowances can be made easily in the above developments to de-
rive the corresponding expressions for a delayed process. If * denotes

CHAPTER 2. RENEWAL THEORY BACKGROUND 
convolution, we can see, for example, that: 
(2.41) 
and 
00 
K(t) = L G * G n - 1(t), t ~ O. 
(2.42) 
n=O 
Also, the integral equation (2.12) now takes the form 
k(t) = g(t) + lot k(u)g(t - u)du, 
(2.43) 
and the recurrence time distributions are modified accordingly. 
2.1. 7 
Renewal Equation and Regenerative Processes 
Consider the integral equation 
¢(t) = q(t) + lot ¢(t - u)dG( u), t ~ 0, 
(2.44) 
where ¢( t) and q( t) are functions that are bounded over finite inter-
vals and G( t) is a distribution function as before. This equation is 
generally referred to as the renewal equation; it arises very frequently 
in connection with the theory and application of renewal processes. 
Given q(t) and G(t), we are interested in its solution and the behav-
ior of this solution as t ---+ 00. Regarding the former, the following is 
well-known (cf. Feller, 1966, p. 183). 
Lemma 2.5 The renewal equation (2.44) has the umque solution 
given by: 
¢(t) = q(t) + lot k(u)q(t - u)du, 
where k(.) is the renewal density induced by G(.). 
(2.45) 

2.1. BASIC THEORY 
37 
Proof Denote a convolution by *. On substituting (2.45) in (2.44) 
we find q * k = q * (g + g * k) which holds in view of (2.12). Therefore, 
(2.45) satisfies (2.44). To show uniqueness, suppose that, in addition 
to q + k * q, q + r is another solution to (2.44). Then the difference 
h == r - k * q must satisfy h = g * h. This implies on iteration that 
h = gn * h for all n where gn is the n-fold convolution of the p.d.f. g. 
However, since gn ( x) -+ 0 as n -+ 00 for any finite x, gn * h --+ 0 as 
n -+ 00. Therefore, gn * h = 0 for all nand h = o. 
We shall review some consequences of the renewal equation in 
terms of the asymptotic behavior of a renewal process in the next 
section. Here, we first give an application to the determination of the 
moments of the forward recurrence time distribution. These moments 
will be required in relation to the random lead time model of Chapter 
6. Clearly, they can be computed from the p.d.f. given by (2.16). 
However, the following result, reported in Coleman (1982), provides 
a more convenient representation. 
Lemma 2.6 Moments of the forward recurrence time distribution 
are given by: 
E[Vt] = E[(X - t)n] + lot {E[(X - u)n] - (-u)n}k(t - u)du, 
t 2 0, n = 1,2, ... 
(2.46) 
where P[X:S; x] = G(x). 
Proof By conditioning on the time of the first renewal, we can write: 
E[vT] = lot E[~~ulg( u )du + 1
00 
( u - t)n g( u )du 
= E[(X - t)n] + lot{E[~~u] - (u - tt}g(u)du 
(2.47) 
This is a renewal equation with ¢(t) = E[~n] - (-t)n and q(t) = 
E[(X - t)n] - (_t)n. Its solution is (2.46). 
The renewal equation arises naturally in the study of regenemtive 
stochastic processes (Smith, 1955). In many cases, we can identify 

38 
CHAPTER 2. RENEWAL THEORY BACKGROUND 
a renewal process, say {Tn' n = 1,2, ... }, imbedded in a stochastic 
process of interest. The stochastic process regenemtes itself at each 
renewal epoch in the sense that its behavior during T m for any m, 
is a probabilistic replica of its behavior during TI . For example, the 
process {Ip(t), t ~ O} of Chapter 1, where Ip(t) is the inventory 
position at time t, is a regenerative process. Each time an order 
is placed, the inventory position is raised to S, and the process is 
regenemted. The sequence ofi.i.d. intervals between successive orders 
(i.e., inventory cycles) forms the imbedded renewal process. 
Consider a regenerative process, {J(t), t ~ O}, with state space 
E. Let G(.) be the common c.d.f. of the intervals of its imbedded 
renewal processes {Tn' n = 1,2, ... }. Define for any x E E: 
Q(t,x) = P[T1 > t, J(t) ~ x], t ~ 0, 
(2.48) 
and 
M(t,x) = P[J(t) ~ x], t ~ O. 
(2.49) 
By conditioning on the first renewal epoch of the imbedded renewal 
process, it is easy to verify that the function M satisfies the renewal 
equation: 
M(t,x) = Q(t,x) + fat g(u)M(t - u,x)du, 
(2.50) 
which by Lemma 2.5 has the unique solution: 
M(t,x) = Q(t,x) + fat k(u)Q(t - u,x)du. 
(2.51) 
These representations will be used extensively in the sequel. (For 
a more formal account of regenerative processes, see, for example, 
Cmlar, 1975, pp. 293-302.) 
2.1.8 
Asymptotic Results 
As n ~ 00, the distribution of the partial sum Sn defined by (2.2) 
tends to a normal distribution with mean nJL and variance n0'2. This 

2.1. BASIC THEORY 
39 
follows from the central limit theorem; thus: 
(2.52) 
where cI> (x) is the standard normal c.dJ. Using the relation P[ N (t) < 
n] = P[Sn > t], it can be seen that N(t) also has an asymptotic 
normal distribution with mean tf J.L and variance tcr2 f J.L3. 
Of more significance for our purposes are the limiting behavior 
of the solution of a renewal equation and its implications in terms 
of asymptotic results. We now state a number of well-known facts 
that we shall use in the sequel. (For proofs that are omitted, see, for 
example, Feller, 1966, pp.346-357.) Most of the classical asymptotic 
results can be obtained from the following lemma that refers to (2.44) 
and (2.45). (As before, J.L and cr2 are the mean and variance of G(.).

integrable, t then 
1 loco 
lim fj>(t) = -

(2.53) 
There is a paralllel result if G(.) is arithmetic. The condition on 
q(.) is not restrictive for our purposes. It is not needed if q(.) is a 
continuous function vanishing outside a finite interval, or if q(.) is 
monotone and integrable in the ordinary sense. It is introduced to 
exclude functions that can oscillate widely at infinity, in which case 
(2.53) may not hold. 
When cr2 < 00, we have the following asymptotic result: 
t For h > 0 fixed, denote by mn and mn, the min. and max. respectively of 
q(t) in the interval (n -l)h ::; t :::; nh. Define the upper and lower Riemann Sums 
7i = h L: mn and !l. = h L: mn' Then, q(t), t ~ 0, is directly Riemann integrable 
if the two sums converge absolutely and if (T -
!l. < I: for h sufficiently small (cf. 
Feller, 1966, p. 348).

We shall find the asymptotic approximation to the renewal func-
tion provided by (2.54) particularly useful in constructing approxi-
mations to stationary optimal control policies in Chapter 5. Higher 
order asymptotic approximations have also been reported in the lit-
erature. Carlsson (1983) shows, for example, that if G(t) is strongly 
non-Iatticet with finite moments of integer order m :::: 2, then: 
t G(t) is strongly non-lattice if liml91_oinfll - 1(8)1 > 0 where 1(8) is the 
characteristic function of G(t).

Thus, both recurrence time densities have the same limiting form. If 
we use (2.60) as the p.d.f. of the first interval, an interesting delayed 
renewal process arises. For P[XI ::; x] = 
~ I;[l - G(u)]du, and 
P[Xn ::; x] = G(x), n 2:: 2, we find that k(t) = lilt and 1lt(X) = 
Vt(x) = [1- G(x )]/ JL. Thus the renewal and recurrence time densities 
coincide with their limiting forms for t 2:: o. Such a renewal process 
is called an equilibrium renewal process. 
2.2 
Computational Issues 
As we noted earlier, the various functions and measures of a renewal 
process admit easily computable forms only for interval distributions 
that are certain mixtures of exponentials. In other cases, which in-
clude wide classes of distributions of practical interest, the compu-
tational effort must be based on numerical methods and approxima-
tions. In this section, we consider some distributions that fall into 
the second group. These distributions will be used in the numerical 
examples of Chapter 5 to represent demand batch sizes in the con-
tinuous review model and periodic demands in the periodic review 
model. 

42 
CHAPTER 2. RENEWAL THEORY BACKGROUND 
2.2.1 
Interval Distributions 
The interval distributions of interest are the gamma (GA), Weibull 
(WL), truncated normal (TN), inverse Gaussian (IG), and log-normal 
(LN) distributions. Baxter et al. (1982) have compiled extensive 
tables of the renewal function, its integral, and the variance function 
for renewal processes based on these distributions. This work as well 
as most of our computations in this section and in Chapter 5 are in 
turn supported by an algorithm of McConalogue (1981). We outline 
this algorithm in the next part. The distributions in question are 
all parametrizable by a shape parameter and a scale parameter. The 
p.d.f. of the gamma distribution is: 
( ) _ 
1 
O'-I-~ 
gx -,8O'f(a)x 
e 
,x>O, 
(2.61) 
where a > 0 is the shape parameter and ,8 > 0 the scale parameter. 
Moments of the distribution are: 
(k) 
kf(k + a) 
J.L 
=,8 
f(a) , k = 1,2, .... 
(2.62) 
Note that for integer values of its shape parameter, the gamma dis-
tribution reduces to the Erlang distribution of Example 2 above. 
The gamma distribution exhibits different characteristics depend-
ing on the value of its shape parameter. For a < 1 , the coefficient 
of variation, c, is > 1, the distribution is DFR, and g(x) is monotone 
decreasing on x ~ 0 with an infinite singularity at the origin. For 
a = 1, we have c = 1 and the distribution reduces to the exponential 
distribution. For a > 1, we get c < 1 and the distribution is IFR. 
As a ~ 1 increases, c decreases and the shape of g( x) changes from 
positively skewed to symmetrical. 
Most of these properties are also exhibited by the Weibull distri-
bution with p.d.f.:

and moments 
JL(k) = fJkr(l + ~), k = 1,2, .... 
Q 
(2.64) 
Again, Q > 0 is a shape parameter and f3 a scale parameter. Of 
the properties mentioned above for the gamma distribution, the only 
difference in the case of the Wei bull is that as a increases g( x) changes 
from positively skewed to negatively skewed. 
The truncated normal distribution with parameters Q and f3 has 
the p.d.f.: 
(2.65) 
where cp(x) is the c.d.f. of the standard normal distribution. Note 
that if X has a TN distribution with parameters Q and fJ, then Y = 
XI fJ has a TN distribution with parameters QI fJ and 1. This means 
that fJ is a scale parameter ofthe distribution; Q is a shape parameter. 
The moments are given by: 
(2.66) 
where 
1 1

h(x)= ~ 
k' 
e 
2 duo 
y27r x 
. 
(2.67) 
As in the case of the GM and WL distributions, the TN p.d.f. is 
also unimodal, and, like the GM density, it is positively skewed. As 
the shape parameter Q increases, c decreases and g( x) becomes more 
and more peaked, but it remains positively skewed. 
Another unimodal and positively skewed p.d.f. is provided by the 
inverse Gaussian distribution where: 
(2.68) 

44 
CHAPTER 2. RENEWAL THEORY BACKGROUND 
The mean and variance are J.L and J.L3 I A. If we make the transforma-
tion, a = AI J.L, (3 = J.L2 I A and Y = XI (3, then 
[!;

( x-a)2 
g( X) = 
--e- ~ , X > o. 
27rX 3 
Thus, a > 0 is a shape parameter and (3 is a scale parameter. 
(2.69) 
The last member of our set is the lognormal distribution with 
p.d.f: 
(2.70) 
and moments: 
(k) 
k.H 1k2 p2 
J.L

If we put f3 = eA and Y = XI f3, then 
1 
_1 (!£.a..E)2 
g(x) = xpj2;e 2 
P 
,x > o. 
(2.72) 
Therefore f3 is a scale parameter and p2 == a is a shape parameter. 
The densi ty function is very close to the normal density for small a. 
As a increases so does c and the skeweness increases rapidly. 
Thus, all five distributions are parametrizable with a shape pa-
rameter and a scale parameter, generally denoted by a and f3, re-
spectively. In what follows, we shall carry out the computations for 
f3=1. 
The corresponding results for other scale parameter values 
will be obtainable by simple transformations. Using the scale pa-
rameter f3 as the first argument in notation, we have by definition: 
G(f3jx) = G(ljxlf3), X ~ 0, and g(f3jx) = g(ljxlf3)If3. It follows 
that J.L(f3) = f311(1), a2(f3) = f32a2(1) and c(f3) = c(1). Thus the 
coefficient of variation is invariant under the scale parameter. 
For convolutions of G( Wj x), we have: 
G2((3j x) = lox G((3j x - u )g(f3j u )du 
r/fJ 
= Jo 
G(1jxlf3- u)g(lju)du = G2(1jxlf3)· 
(2.73)

It follows by induction that Gk(j3;X) = Gk(l;x/j3), 
k = 1,2, .... 
Consequently, for the renewal function and related quantities, we 
have: K(j3;x) = K(l;x/j3), x ~ 0, k(j3;x) = k(l;x/j3)/j3, x ~ 0, 
Vt(j3;x) = Vt/{3(l;x/j3)/j3, t ~ 0, x ~ 0, and Ut(j3;x) = Ut/f3(l;x/j3) 
/13, t ~ 0, x ~ 0. Similar relations for other quantities can also be 
developed from these. 
2.2.2 
Shape of the Renewal Function 
For distributions considered above, computation of the renewal func-
tion and related quantities must be based on numerical methods. 'vVe 
used the generalized cubic splining algorithm of McConalogue (1981). 
As its predecessor, due to Cleroux and McConalogue (1976), this al-
gorithm provides a general approach to the numerical evaluation of 
the various renewal-theoretic functions and measures. The essence of 
the algorithm is the approximation of the n-fold convolution Gn(t) 
by a cubic-spline function. The interval [O,t] is divided into m pan-
els of equal width, and Gn(t) is approximated by a different cubic 
function in each panel. The approximation for Gn+1 (t) is obtained, 
recursively, from Gn(t). (For details, see Cleroux and McConalogue, 
1976; and McConalogue, 1978.) 
The generalized algorithm allows g(t) to be unbounded near the 
origin (but assumes that gn(t) is bounded for n ~ 2). This permits 
the treatment of both the gamma and the Weibull distributions for 
shape parameter values less than 1. The algorithm also yields better 
accuracy near the origin when g(t) is bounded. Using this algorithm, 
Baxter et al. (1982a,b) computed and tabulated the renewal function, 
its integral, and the variance function for renewal processes generated 
by the above distributions. They computed the renewal function 
through (2.11) with appropriate convergence criteria on Gn(t), and 
K(t) relative to its linear asymptote. The variance function was 
computed from (2.14) and the integral of K(t) by directly integrating 
the spline representation. For the renewal function, they report an 
accuracy level of four to six decimal figures. Although Baxter et al. 
tables are very extensive, we were not able to use them directly for 

46 
CHAPTER 2. RENEWAL THEORY BACKGROUND 
most of our work (cf. Chapter 5). However, in the treatment of the 
distributions selected, and in the implementation of the algorithm, we 
followed the same approaches, procedures, and convergence criteria 
as in the above references. 
It is clear that the properties of a distribution (moment char-
acteristics, shape, aging, etc.) will be reflected in some fashion by 
its renewal process. However, the underlying relationships are not 
well-understood except, as noted earlier, in the case of the DFR class 
and its close relatives. Of particular interest to us in what follows 
is the shape of the renewal function and the rapidity with which it 
approaches its linear asymptote. Unfortunately, given a distribution, 
there is no general analytic means of characterizing the shape of its 
renewal function. Conversely, it is not clear as to what class of distri-
butions are implicated by a given assumption on the shape of K(x) 
or k(x). The same is true of the rate of approach of K(x) to its 
asymptote. 
In general, in approaching its limit 1/ j.L, the renewal density k( x) 
may be monotone (increasing or decreasing) or it may oscillate. In the 
first case the renewal function would be convex or concave increasing 
while in the second case it would oscillate around its linear asymptote. 
The latter would mean that K(t) - t/j.L may not be monotone, not a 
favorable observation for the accuracy of asymptotic approximations 
through (2.54). On general grounds, oscillations may arise when G(x) 
has small dispersion (Le. c < 1). For then k(t) = 2:1' gn(t) will tend 
to be larger near t = j.L, 2j.L, ... and smaller near t = 0, 1.5j.L, ... (cf. 
Cox, 1962). 
Computed through McConalogue's algorithm, shapes of the re-
newal function typical of the distributions introduced above are seen 
in Figures 2.1 to 2.5. In all cases the scale parameter f3 was taken 
as unity and the shape parameter a was varied to generate different 
shapes and rates of approach to the linear approximation. As antic-
ipated by Lemma 2.2, the renewal function is concave for the DFR 
gamma and Weibull distributions (a < 1). We found that K(t) is 
nearly concave, save for a possibly convex shape very near the origin,

also for the inverse Gaussian distribution with a < 1. For these three 
distributions, as a > 1 is increased, K(t) becomes initially convex 
and then oscillatory. 
For the truncated normal distribution, as a increases (from -2), 
the renewal function changes from a convex to an oscillatory shape. 
For the lognormal distribution, K(t) is oscillatory, following a convex 
start, for small values of the shape parameter. Oscillations disappear 
by about a = 0.8. For a ~ 1, K(t) is concave, with extremely slow 
convergence to the linear asymptote when a > 1.5.

CHAPTER 2. RENEWAL THEORY BACKGROUND 
2.2.3 
Accuracy of Asymptotic Approximations 
The above observations on the shape of the renewal function indicate 
that the accuracy of the asymptotic approximation is contingent on 
a number of factors. Important among these are the presence of 
oscillations (small dispersion) and a low rate of approach to the linear 
asymptote (high dispersion). From a practical point of view, it would 
be very useful if these could be made more precise so that one knows 
how large a t is large enough for sufficient accuracy. To this end, we 
now let: 
and define: 
J(t) = IK(t) - [t/ J-l + (c 2 -
1)/2]1 
K(t) 
p(f)=inf{p: J(PJ-l)=f, 
J(t)~f, t~PJ-l}, 
(2.74) 
(2.75) 
where the relative error f > 0 is arbitrary but fixed. By a large 
enough t, we now mean t ~ p( f)J-l. This definition is in view of the 
fact that IK(t) - t/J-l1 may not be monotone decreasing as we have 
seen in the above examples. If IK(t) - t/ J-li is monotone decreasing, 
then p(f) can be defined simply by J(p(f)J-l) = f, 
Using McConalogue's algorithm, we computed the convergence 
measure p( f) for all the distributions discussed above. The results 
are presented in Table 2.1 for f = 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10 in columns 
headed by p. It is seen that, generally speaking, p( f) decreases as 
c increases to about 0.8 and then it increases with c. Increasing 
p(f) with increasing c > 1 can be explained by the higher order 
asymptotic result noted above (cf. 2.59). The third and fourth terms 
in that expression imply that the rate of convergence of K (t) would 
be affected by the shape of g( t), the location of its mode and the 
prominence of its upper tail. These influences are also reflected in 
the coefficient of variation. On the other hand, increasing p( f) with 
decreasing c < 1 is due to oscillations of K(t). 
Motivated by these observations, we tried a polynomial approxi-
mation to p( f) through c. A second degree polynomial of the form;

turned out to provide satisfactory fits. Convergence measures esti-
mated by individual fits (separately for each distribution) are given 
in Table 2.1 in columns headed by PI 
vVe also tried several combined fits. Examination of the plots of 
p( €) showed a similar shape for all distributions for about c < 0.9. 
However, three different shapes were observed for c > 0.9. In this 
range, convergence measures for LN were considerably larger in value 
than those for GM and WL; results for IG and TN fell somewhere in 
between. Estimates based on grouping GM and WL and TN and IG 
were similar to Pl. 
As GM and WL distributions with a < 1 are somewhat excep-
tional, having densities with infinite singularities at the origin, we 
also tried a combined fit after deleting these. The remaining distri-
butions, including GM and WL with a > 1, have unimodal densities 
with modes at t > O. Results of this combined fit are also shown in Ta-
ble 2.1 under column headings P2. They again show good agreement 
with the exact results. Coefficients of the approximating polynomials 
are given in Table 2.2. It is interesting to note that, except for the 
LN distribution, K(t) can be approximated by its linear asymptote 
with a small relative error even for small to moderate values of t, as 
measured in units of fl. It is also interesting that most of the variation 

2.2. COMPUTATIONAL ISSUES 
53 
in p can be explained by c. In most applications, f need not be too 
small. In the applications reported in Chapter 5, sufficient accuracy 
is achieved for f = 0.20 which results in even smaller p values. 
Table 2.2 is based on a larger set of observations than those seen 
in Table 2.1. However, a restriction was c < 2. This is due to the 
fact that larger coefficients of variation for which p( E) is computable 
are produced only by the LN distribution. McConalague's algorithm 
is unable to cope with GM and WL distributions with a < 0.5 for 
which c > 2 also. 
We emphasize that all the distributions considered are parametriz-
able in terms of a scale and a shape parameter. Therefore, both c 
and p( E) depend only on the shape parameter. In terms of scal-
ing, note that J(~;t) = 
J(l;t/~), J(~;PJl(~)) = J(l;pJl(l)), and 
p( w; f) = p(l; E). Thus,' in addition to c, p is also invariant under 
the scale parameter. Furthermore, with the elimination of the DFR 
gamma and DFR Weibull distributions, all the densities have the 
same unimodal shape with modes at x > O. Within this class, the 
approximation P2 should be useful in practice by providing an imme-
diate indication of whether the asymptotic approximation would be 
sufficiently accurate. Outside this class, however, the approximations 
suggested may be totally inadequate. For example, the convergence 
measure for a renewal process governed by a mixed-exponential dis-
tribution as in (2.21) cannot be well-approximated by c alone. This 
distribution cannot be parametrized as above. In fact, it admits dif-
ferent parameter configurations under which the mean and variance 
remain the same but the measure of convergence vary substantially. 

Chapter 3 
Operating Characteristics 
This chapter is concerned with the time-dependent and stationary 
behavior of the inventory systems introduced in Chapter 1. Details 
are given for the continuous review system under a compound renewal 
demand process. The periodic review system is treated as a special 
case, following the correspondence explained in Chapter 1. Included 
in the analysis are the stochastic processes representing inventory 
position, inventory on hand, and demand during a lead time. The 
investigation is based on the joint distribution of inventory position 
and demand during a lead time. Time dependent and stationary 
distributions of lead time demand, inventory position and inventory 
on hand are derived in section 3.2 from this joint distribution. Section 
3.3 is concerned with certain stationary measures of interest that can 
be constructed from the distributions obtained before. Important 
among these are the probability that on hand inventory is positive 
(the fill rate), the cost rate function, and the distribution of the 
customer waiting time. The chapter is concluded with a discussion 
of two special cases. This includes an independent treatment of the 
unit demands model and the specialization of some of the results to 
the periodic review mode. 
For the general model under continuous review, we denote by

A( x), x ~ 0, the interdemand time c.d.f with mean Pa and by 
B(x), x ~ 0, the batch size c.dJ. with mean Pb, variance a~ and co-
efficient of variation Cb. Both distributions are regarded as absolutely 
continuous for convenience with p.d.f. 's a( x) and b( x), respectively. 
Inventory position and inventory on hand at time t are denoted by 
Ip(t) and I(t), respectively. L ~ 0 is the length of the constant lead 
time, S ~ 0 is the order-up-to level, and, s, which is allowed to be 
negative, is the reorder point. We write .6. = S - s and assume .6. ~ 0 
for a meaningful control policy. 
3.1 
Inventory Position 
According to our assumptions on the demand process, the sequence of 
interarrival times forms a renewal process. We denote by N( T, T + u) 
the number of occurrences in this process during (T, T + u]. If T is an 
arrival point, then N(T,T + u) == N(u) and 
P[N(u) = n] = An(u) - An+1(u), n = 0,1,.... 
(3.1) 
A second renewal process may be constructed through the Li.d. se-
quence of batch sizes. \Ve let 
00 
(3.2) 
and 
(3.3) 
denote the related renewal function and renewal density. Note that 
this process does not refer to time. R( x), for exam pIe, represents the 
expected number of customers whose demand can be fully satisfied 
with quantity x. 
Let D( T, T+ u) represent the cumulative demand during (T, T + u]. 
{D( T, T + u), u ~ O}, T ~ 0, is a delayed cumulative renewal process

(cf. Section 2.1.6). If T is an arrival point, then D(T,T +u) == D(u) 
and

P[D(u) ~ x] = L:[An(u) - An+1(u)]Bn(x), u;::: 0, x;::: O. 
(3.4) 
n=O 
If we start observing the inventory position immediately after an 
order (t = 0), we have a well-defined stochastic process {Ip(t), t;::: O} 
with Ip(O) = S (Figure 1.1). Instants at which the inventory position 
is raised to S are the regeneration points of this process. The length 
of time between two successive such points is an inventory cycle. Let 
Jp(t,x)dx = P[x < Ip(t) ~ x + dx], t;::: 0, s ~ x ~ S, 
(3.5) 
and 
Jp(x) = lim Jp(t,x), x;:::O. 
t-+oo 
(3.6) 
Also, denote by Ip the inventory position in a stationary process. We 
have the following result. 
Theorem 3.1 
P[Ip(t) = S] = 1 - A(t) + lot m(t - u)[l - A( u)]du,

CHAPTER 3. OPERATING CHARACTERISTICS 
Proof If Tn denotes the length of the n-th cycle, then {Tn, 
n = 
1,2, ... } is a renewal process. Denote by C(x), c(x), and m(x), re-
spectively, the c.d.f. and p.d.f. of the cycle lengths and the related 
renewal density. We see that {Tn > x} if and only if {D( x) < ~}, 
~ == S - s. It follows from (3.4) that 
00 
C(x) = 1 - L:)An(x) -
An+1(x)]Bn(~), x 2: o. 
(3.11) 
n=O 
The corresponding p.d.f. is (3.10) and the renewal density is deter-
mined by (3.9). 
The theorem now follows by conditioning on the renewal process 
of cycles. For (3.7), by conditioning on TI, we can write: 
P[Ip(t) = S] = 1 - A(t) + lot c( u)P[Ip(t - u) = S]du. 
(3.12) 
This is a renewal equation with solution (3.7) (cf. Lemma 2.5). The 
expression for fpC t, x) follows from a similar argument. 
Corollary 3.1 For the limiting distribution of inventory position, we 
have:

(3.14) 
Proof The expected cycle length is given by: 
E[Tn] = 1
00[1- C(x)]dx = J.La[1 + R(~)]. 
(3.15) 
It follows, by (2.69), that 
(3.16) 
If we pass to limits as t -t 00 in (3.7) and (3.8), we obtain (3.13) and 
(3.14), on account of Lemma 2.6. 

3.2. INVENTORY ON HAND AND LEAD TIME DEMAND 
59 
Note that the interarrival time distribution has no effect on the 
limiting distribution of inventory position. Note also that the more 
natural initial condition, Ip(O) = y, 
s < Y < S, introduces only 
minor complications in the above developments. {Tn' n = 1,2, ... } 
would then define a delayed renewal process with the distribution of 
Tl being different (y - s instead of ~ in (3.6)). If m( x) is the renewal 
density for this delayed process, then we have: 
P[Ip = Y] = 1 - A(t), 
(3.17) 
P[Ip(t) = S] = lot m(t - u)[l- A(u)]du, 
(3.18) 
and

(3.19) 
On passing to limits as t -* 00 we obtain the same limiting distribu-
tion (3.13), (3.14). 
3.2 
Inventory On Hand and 
Leadtime Demand 
To discuss the distribution of inventory on hand in finite time, we take 
Ip(O) = S, immediately after a replenishment order, and concentrate 
on the characterization of I( t + L) for t ~ O. First, let O( t) denote 
total outstanding orders at time t and M (t, t + L) the total addition 
to inventory during (t, t + L]. 
We have I(t) = Ip(t) - O(t) and 

60 
CHAPTER 3. OPERATING CHARACTERISTICS 
I(t+L) = I(t)+M(t,t+L)-D(t,t+L). O(t) must be converted to 
inventory over (t, t + Ll; that is, O(t) = M(t, t + L). These relations 
imply: 
I(t + L) = Ip(t) - D(t, t + L). 
(3.20) 
In view of this observation, 1(0) is irrelevant for I(t + L), t ~ 
O. It would be needed only to determine I( u), 
0 S; u < L. For 
this purpose, timing and magnitudes of outstanding orders at time 
o would have to be specified also, as part of the initial conditions. 
For example, if there is only one outstanding order of magnitude y 
at time 0, due to arrive at time r < L, and if 1(0) = z, z + y = S, 
then I(u) = z - D(u) for u < rand I(u) = S - D(u) for r S; u < L. 
It follows that P[I(u) S; xl = 1 - P[D(u) S; z - x], x S; z, u < r, 
and P[I(u) S; xl = 1- P[D(u) S; S - xl, x S; S, r S; u < L. 
To determine the distribution function of I(t+L), t ~ 0, we need 
the joint distribution of Ip( t) and D( t, t + L). These two processes are 
independent if and only if the demand process is compound Poisson 
(Le., A(x) is the exponential distribution). In this special case, the 
marginal distribution of the inventory position can be combined with 
the distribution of the lead time demand in accordance with (3.20). 
For the joint distribution in question in the general case, we define: 
q(t, L; x, y)dxdy == P[x < Ip(t) S; x + dx, y < D(t, t + L) S; y + dy], 
s S; x < S, y > 0, 
(3.21 ) 
qo(t, L; S, 0) = P[Ip(t) = S, D(t, t + L) = 0], 
(3.22) 
ql(t,L;S,y)dy = P[Ip(t) = S, y < D(t,t + L) S; y + dy], y> 0, 
(3.23) 
and 
q2(t,L;x,0)dx = P[x < Ip(x) S; x + dx, D(t,t + L) = 0], s S; x < S. 
(3.24) 
We now prove the following theorem. 
Theorem 3.2 The joint distribution of I(t) and D(t,t+L) is given

y > 0, we obtain, again by conditioning on 
the renewal process of inventory cycles, that: 
q(t, L; x, y)dxdy 
= P [S - x - dx < D ( t) ~ S - x, y < D ( t, t + L) ~ y + d y]

(3.30) 
The conditional probability above equals bn(S - x )bk(Y) dx dy, and 
the probability of the condition, P[N(t) = n, N(t, t + L) = k] == 
w(t, Lj n, k), is given by (2.9). This results in (3.25). Other results 
follow from similar arguments. 
Time dependent and limiting distributions of inventory position, 
demand during a lead time and inventory on hand can be obtained 
from Theorem 3.2. We have already characterized the inventory po-
sition in section 3.2. For demand during a lead time, D( t, t + L), we 
write 
h(t,Ljy)dy = P[y < D(t,t + L) ~ y + dy],y > 0, 
(3.31) 
and 
h(Lj y) = lim h(t, Lj y).

(3.32) 
Corollary 3.2 The time-dependent distribution of the lead time de-
mand is given by:

(3.36) 
Note that in (3.33)-(3.34), the time interval of length L com-
mences at an arbitrary epoch t, not necessarily immediately follow-
ing a demand. Another immediate consequence of Theorem 3.2 is the 
joint distribution of inventory position and lead time demand for a 
stationary process. On passing to limits as t -
00 and appealing to 
Lemma 2.6, we find: 
Corollary 3.4 The limiting joint distribution of inventory position 
and demand during a lead time is given by: 
r(S - x)

q2(Ljx,0) = !la[l+R(~)]io [l-A(u+L)]du, ss,x<S. (3.40) 
If we compare these with the limiting marginal distributions given by 
(3.13)-(3.14) and (3.35)-(3.36), we discover the following. 
Corollary 3.5 The inventory position at time t, Ip(t), and demand 
during (t, t + LJ, D(t, t + L), are asymptotically independent. 
Finally, we give the time-dependent and limiting distributions of 
on-hand inventory. The former is obtained from Theorem 3.2 through 
relationship (3.20). The latter follows either on passing to the limits 
or on combining the corresponding marginal distributions in accor-
dance with 1= Ip-D(L), the stationary version of (2.20). We denote 
the p.d.f.'s of I(t) and I by J(t,x) and J(x). 
Corollary 3.6 The time-dependent distribution oj on-hand inven-
tory is given by:

3.3 
Measures of Effectiveness 
Distributions derived in the previous sections can be used to con-
struct several measures related to the time dependent and stationary 
behavior of the inventory system under study. In this section we con-
struct a number of stationary measures. We also derive the stationary 
distribution of the customer waiting time by independent arguments. 
(Recall that s is allowed to be negative.) 
3.3.1 
Means and Variances 
Starting with the inventory position, from (3.13)-(3.14) we have: 
(3.45) 
and 
Var[I] = ~2 + 2R(~) _ [~ + R(~)]2 
P 
1 + R(~) 
1 + R(~) , 
(3.46) 
where R(x) = J: R(u)du and R(x) = Jrf R(u)du. 

66 
CHAPTER 3. OPERATING CHARACTERISTICS 
Similarly, for demand during a lead time we find from (3.35)-
(3.36): 
E[b(L)] = Jib L, 
(3.47) 
Jia 
(2) 
L 
Var[b(L)] = ~[L + 2R(L)] - (~)2. 
(3.48) 
Jia 
Jia 
On account of I = Ip - beL), we then have 
E[I] = E[Ip] - E[b(L)]. 
And, since Ip and beL) are independent (cf. Corollary 3.5) 
Var[I] = Var[Ip] + Var[b(L)]. 
In addition, the expected on hand positive stock is: 
(3.49) 
(3.50) 
S 
H(L, S) + fS reS - u)H(L, u)du 
[ +] _ f

E I 
= Jo xdF x -
1 + R(~) 
, 
3.51 
where [s]+ = max(s,O), and the expected outstanding backorders is 
given by: 
E[I-] == 1°00 x dF(x) = E[I] - E[I+]. 
(3.52) 
These follow from (3.43)-(3.44). 
3.3.2 
The Fill Rate 
The stationary probability that on hand inventory is positive is ob-
tained from (3.43)-(3.44) to be: 
H(L, S) + 1S reS - u)H(L, u)du 
P[I> 0] == 1 - F(O) = 
[s]+ 
(3.53) 
1 + R(~) 
This measure is generally referred to as the fill rate. Clearly, F(O) is 
the stockout probability. 

3.3. MEASURES OF EFFECTIVENESS 
67 
Behavior of 1 - F(O) as ~ varies will be of some interest in the 
sequel both for an arbitrary s and for s = O. Especially in the latter 
case, it is intuitively clear that a larger .6. would increase the lengths 
of time during which I > O. It is also clear in this case, provided 
that there is no more than one outstanding order during a lead time, 
that the lengths of time during which I < 0 are all equal to L in-
dependently of.6.. Consequently, 1 - F(O) should be increasing in 
.6.. Unfortunately, when there are more than one outstanding order 
during a lead time, stockout spells may also increase in length as ~ 
is increased, depending on the characteristics of the demand process. 
Thus, 1- F(O) may decrease in ~ over one or more intervals. The sit-
uation is even more complicated when s 1= O. It turns out for L = 0, 
s < 0, for example, that 1 - F(O) is monotone increasing in ~ only 
under a rather restrictive condition on the demand process. At this 
point, we note the following result. 
Lemma 3.1 1 - F(O) is monotone increasing in .6. if 1 + R(~) is 
log-concave (i.e., log(l + R(~)) is concave}. 
Proof We have I = Ip - D(L) where, according to Corollary 3.5, Ip 
and D(L) are independent. Clearly, P[I > 0] = P[Ip > D(L)]. On 
the other hand, it follows from (3.13)-(3.14) that 
1 + R(S - x) 
P[Ip > x] = 
1 + R(.6.) , x ~ s. 
(3.54) 
It is seen that this measure is increasing in .6. if 1'( S - x) /[1 + R( S -
x)] > 1'(.6.)/[1 - R(.6.)] or d/d~ log[l + R(S - x)] > d/d~ log[l+ 
R(.6.)] which holds if 1 + R(x) log-concave. 
Implications of the log-concavity of l+R(x) to optimization prob-
lems in inventory systems and related areas were examined by Stid-
ham (1975, 1986). (Recall that }.La[l + R(.6.)] is the expected cycle 
length.) Although log-concavity is a weaker assumption than concav-
ity, there is no distribution of practical interest with log-concave but 
not concave renewal function. 

68 
CHAPTER 3. OPERATING CHARACTERISTICS 
3.3.3 
Customer Waiting Time 
An important service level measure for systems with backlogging is 
the customer waiting time. Here we consider the actual waiting time 
of a customer who arrives at a given time. We define this time, in 
the presence of continuously distributed batch demands, as measured 
from the time of arrival of a customer to the time at which his demand 
is completely filled. Working with a discrete batch size distribution, 
Kruse (1981) uses a more refined waiting time concept, defined sep-
arately for each unit of the batch demanded. In what follows, we 
shall allow s to be negative; Kruse (1981) requires in a discrete state 
process that s ~ -1 which in turn implies that no one waits more 
than L. 
Let Wet) denote the waiting time of a customer who arrives at 
time t and write limt--+oo P[W(t) ~ y] == P[lV ~ y]. We now prove 
the following results: 
Theorem 3.3 
00 
P[W ~ y] = ~

(3.57) 

3.3. MEASURES OF EFFECTIVENESS 
69 
Proof First, observe that a customer who arrives at time t, demand-
ing X, and who finds Ip( t-) 2: X, will wait ~ y < L if and only 
if Ip(t + y - L), which will be available for issue by time t + y, less 
D(t + y - L, t-) is larger than X. In symbols: 
{W(t) ~ y} {:} {Ip(t+y-L)-D(t+y-L,t-) 2: X}, y < L. (3.58) 
Note that since t is a demand point, looking backward from t, D(t + 
Y - L, t-) has the same distribution as D(L - y) which in turn is 
given by (3.4). It follows, for a stationary process, that: 
P[W ~ yilp = u,X = x] = P[D(L - y) ~ u - x], 
(3.59) 
where y < L, [8]+ ~ u ~ S and x ~ u. Therefore: 
P[W ~ Yllp(u)] = lou P[D(L - y) ~ u - x]b(x)dx, 
(3.60) 
and 
P[W ~ y] = 1 + ~(ti) {loS P[D(L - y) ~ S - x]b(x)dx 
+ is 
r(S - u) l u P[D(L - y) ~ u - x]b(x)dxdu}, y < L, 
u=[s]+ 
x=o 
(3.61) 
where we used (3.13)-(3.14). The result (3.55) follows on substituting 
(3.4). 
To complete the construction of the distribution, we now distin-
guish two cases. If 8 2: 0 so that no customer waits more than L, 
then P[W ~ L] = 1. This observation or the following argument 
establishes the probability concentration at L. 
P[W = Lllp = u] = 1 - B(u), u 2: 0, 
(3.62) 
P[W = L] = 1+~(6.) {[1- B(S)] + is r(S - u)[l - B( u)]du}, 
82:0. 
(3.63)

CHAPTER 3. OPERATING CHARACTERISTICS 
For s < 0, a similar argument produces:

(3.64) 
Note that (3.56) includes both (3.63) and (3.64). 
For s < 0, we also have the possibility that W > L. This occurs 
when an arrival at time t finds 0 > Ip(t+) > s. Such a customer would 
have to wait until the next order placement time plus L. Accordingly: 
P[L < W ~ y] = I+~(~) 1° reS - u)P[D(y - L) > u - s]du, 
y> L, s ~ o. 
(3.65) 
(3.57) follows with (3.4). This completes the proof. 
In closing this section, we note that for s < 0, (3.55)-(3.56) imply 
that 
P[W < L] = 1 + R(S) 
s <_ 0,

3.3.4 
The Cost Rate Function 
The most common measure of effectiveness used in relation to the 
model under consideration is the stationary cost rate function that is 
obtained by imposing a cost structure on the system in steady state. 

3.4. SPECIAL CASES 
71 
We choose a simple representation involving a fixed ordering cost of 
J( dollars per order, and linear holding and shortage costs with rates 
hand p dollars per unit per unit time, respectively. The expected 
total cost per unit time in steady state can be expressed as:

Special Cases 
In this section we discuss two important special cases of the model 
presented above: systems with unit demands (Le., each demand is 
for a single item) and systems under periodic review. 
3.4.1 
Unit Demands 
The first systematic investigation of an inventory system under unit 
demands separated by LLd. interdemand times was given by Finch 
(1961) as a special case of a model with random lead times, and by 
Beckman (1961) as a special case of a model with discrete random

CHAPTER 3. OPERATING CHARACTERISTICS 
batch sizes. An independent study of the model under the assumption 
of immediate deliveries is found in Sivazlian (1974). The model is 
also included, at least formally, as a special case of the more general 
systems studied in the previously cited references. 
Consistent with the earlier representations, we will use the con-
vention that whenever Ip(t) = s - 1, a replenishment order of size 
~+1 is placed, thus raising the inventory position to S where s, S, 
and ~ = S - s are now integers; s is allowed to be negative as before. 
The alternative would be to place orders of size ~ whenever Ip(t) = s. 
However, this is inconsistent with our earlier convention of ordering 
S - Ip( t) whenever Ip( t) < s in the case of a continuous-state process. 
In either case, note that the reorder point, order-up-to-level policy is 
reduced, effectively, to a reorder-point, order-quantity policy. 
Another feature that is also unique to the case of unit demands 
is that the stationary distribution of inventory position turns out to 
be uniform. Together with a constant procurement lead time, this 
implies, as we show in the sequel, a unimodal cost rate function that 
facilitates the determination of optimal policies. These characteris-
tics, and the prevalence of the model in practice, such as in the retail 
business of consumer durables, justify a separate treatment. In this 
part, we provide, without proof, the unit-demand-size versions of the 
results obtained so far. Optimality conditions, optimal policies, and 
approximations will be discussed in the sequel, again as special cases 
of the corresponding more general findings. 
We first note that the representation of unit batch sizes by b(l) = 
1 immediately implies that r(j) = 1, j = 1,2, ... , and R(j) = j for 
the renewal density and function defined through batch sizes. 
For the time dependent and stationary joint distributions of in-
ventory position and demand during a lead time, let q(t,L;n,m) = 
P[Ip(t) = n, D(t, t+L) = m], and q(L; n, m) = limt-+oo q(t, L; n, m) == 
P[Ip = n,iJ(L) = m]. We have: 

3.4. SPECIAL CASES 
73 
Theorem 3.4 
q(t,L;n, m) = w(t,L; S - n,m) + lot m(t - u)w(u,L; S - n,m)du, 
(3.71) 
where w(u,L;n,m) is given by (2.16) and m(t) is the solution oj 
Also, 
q(n, m) = 
m(t) = a.6.+1(t) + lot a.6.+1(t - u)m(u)du. 
(3.72) 
J.la[l\.6.]loL[1- A(u)][Am_1(L - u) - Am(L - u)]du, 
m? 1 
J.la[l\.6.] la'X! [1 - A( u + L )]du, m = O. 
(3.73) 
Proof of (3.71) follows the same arguments as in Theorem 3.2. Recall 
that w(u,L; n, m) = P[N(u) = n, N(u,u + L) = m] where N(u,u + 
t) == D(u,u+t) is the total demand during (u,u+t]. As before, if u is 
an arrival point, we write D( u, u+t) == D(t); this has the distribution: 
P[D(t) = n] = An(t) - An+1(t), n = 0,1, .... We also note that 
m(t) is the renewal density of the renewal process of inventory cycles; 
a.6.+1 (t), the ~ + 1st convolution of the interarrival density function, 
is the interval density of this renewal process. Correspondingly, the 
expected cycle length is fla [1 + .6.]. 
As corollaries to Theorem 3.4, we next give the distributions of 
inventory position and demand during a lead time. 
Corollary 3.8 Let P[Ip(t) = n] == Jp(t, n), then 
P[D(t) = S - n] + lot m(t - u) 
P[D(u) = S - n]du, s:S; n < S, 
(3.74) 
1 - A(t) + lot m(t - u)[1 - A(u)]du, n = S. 

74 
CHAPTER 3. OPERATING CHARACTERISTICS 
and 
(3.75) 
Thus the stationary distribution of inventory position is uniform 
over the set {8, S + 1, ... , S}. If the control policy called for ordering 
whenever Ip(t) = s, rather than when Ip(t) = s - 1 as above, this 
distribution would have been uniform over the set {s + 1,8 + 2, ... , S}. 
Richards (1975) proved that if demands are generated by a renewal 
process, then fp(n) is uniform under an (8, S) policy if and only if 
demands are of unit size. 
Corollary 3.9 Time dependent and stationary distributions of de-
mand during a lead time are given, respectively, by: 
~ 
t 
h(t,L;m) = 2:)w(t,L;n,m) + la m(t - u)w(u,L;n,m)du], 
n=O

(3.76) 
and 
h(L,m) = 1

/La Jo 
..l. roo [1 - A( u + L )]du, 
/La Jo 
m= O. 
(3.77) 
For later reference, we also note the c.d.f. corresponding to the lim-
iting density (3.77) to be: 
H(L,m) = 1- ~ rL[1_ A(u)]Am(L - u)du, m ~ O. 
/-La Jo 
(3.78) 
In all these expressions the time interval of length L commences 
at an arbitrary epoch t, not necessarily at a demand point. We also 

3.4. SPECIAL CASES 
75 
see, from (3.73), (3.75), and (3.77) that Ip(t) and D(t, t + L) are 
asymptotically independent. 
The time dependent distribution of on-hand inventory is obtained 
from Theorem 3.4 and the relation I(t + L) = Ip(t) - D(t, t + L). 
The limiting distribution follows either on passing to the limits or on 
combining the corresponding marginal distributions in accordance 
with 1= Ip - D(L). We have: 
Corollary 3.10 
s 
f(t+L,n) =

q(t, L; k, k-n), t ~ 0, -00 < n :S S, (3.79)

In terms of measures of effectiveness, most of the results reported 
in part 3.3 can be easily specialized to the case of unit demands on 
substituting R(j) = j. For the fill rate, we have:

3.4.2 
The Periodic Review Model 
Recall from Chapter 1 that in the periodic review version of the model 
the lead time is an integral multiple of the period length which in turn 
is regarded as unity. Demands in successive periods are Li.d. random 
variables with c.d.f. B(x) which is assumed to be continuous with 
p.d.f. b( x). If D( L) is the lead time demand, we have: 
P[D(L) ~ x] = BL(X), x ~ 0, L ~ o. 
(3.88) 
with the corresponding density function bL(X). The lead time demand 
is always characterized by (3.88) as every lead time starts and ends 
at the beginning (or end) of a period. 

3.4. SPECIAL CASES 
77 
According to the observations made in Chapter 1, regarding the 
equivalency of the periodic review model to a properly specialized 
continuous review model, if, in the foregoing we take JI(L, x) == 
BL(X), h(L,x) = h(x), A(x) = 1 if x ~ 1, A(x) = 0 if x < 1, 
and replace L by L + 1, we should obtain the corresponding results 
for the periodic review system. Although the specialization to con-
stant interdemand times violates the continuity assumption on A( x), 
this flexibility can be added to the formalism. 
U sing the transformations noted above, the stationary distribu-
tion of on hand inventory can be obtained from (3.43). Clearly, 
P[I = S] = P[D(L) = 0] = 0, and: 
f(x) = l+A(ll) [bL+1(S - x) + fS 
r(S - U)bL+l(U - x)du], 
Jmax(x,s) 
-00 < x ~ s. 
(3.89) 
The renewal function R( x) and its density r( x) now correspond to 
the renewal process formed by the periodic demand sequence with 
common p.d.f. b( x). Putting L = 0 in the above, the p.d.f. of the 
inventory position turns out to be: 
r(S - x) 
1 + R(~)' 
Vll(S - x) 
1 + R(~)' 
s ~ x ~ S, 
(3.90) 
x ~ S, 
where Vll(U) is the p.d.f. of the forward recurrence time given by 
(2.19). 
For measures of effectiveness, the results of section 3.3 remain 
valid under the above transformations, and with /La == 1, E[..o(L)] == 
E[D(L)] == /LbL, Var[..o(L)] == Var[D(L)] = alL, H(L,x) == BL+l(X) 
and H(L, x) == BL+l (x) = It BL+l (u)du. In particular, we rewrite 
below the expression for the cost rate function and provide an equiv-
alent form for it for later reference. We have, from (3.69)-(3.70) that 
N(s,~) 
E(s,~) = 1 + R(~) + /LbP(L + 1), 
(3.91) 

78 
CHAPTER 3. OPERATING CHARACTERISTICS 
where 
N(s,~) = J( - p[S + sR(~) + R(~)) 
+(p+ h)[BL+1(S) + rS r(S - U)BL+l(U)du). 
J[s] + 
(3.92) 
An alternative form of N(s,~) is obtained by noting that the expres-
sion inside the last brackets can be written as: 
I 
laS r(S - U)BL( u)du, 
las V6.(s - x)fh(u)du + is r(S - u)BL(u)du, 
s ~ 0, 
(3.93) 
s ~ o. 

Chapter 4 
Optimality Conditions 
This chapter is mainly concerned with the optimality conditions rel-
ative to the cost rate function E( 8, .6.). We also establish some useful 
bounds on the optimal policy. Most of the results are again given 
for the general model under continuous review which includes the 
periodic review model as a special case. Results for two other special 
cases, involving immediate deliveries and unit demands, are provided 
separately in section 4.2. 
A sufficient condition for the unimodality, in general, of E(8, .6.), 
is that 1 + R( x) be log-concave (Stidham, 1977, 1986). This excludes 
large classes of demand distributions that arise in practice. Also 
it is not a necessary condition for E(8,.6.) to be unimodal except 
when L = O. The chapter provides a simplified exposition of these 
facts. Log-concavity of 1 + R(x) may appear to be an unexpectedly 
strong condition for E(8,.6.) to be unimodal. But, in fact, when 
this condition holds, the cost rate function is unimodal for any set 
of values for cost parameters J(, hand p. Otherwise, it is easy to 
establish, for example, that E( 8,.6.) is unimodal if J( is large enough. 
One suspects that the conditions that induce E( 8,.6.) to be uni-
modal in the above sense should also result in other nice properties. 

80 
CHAPTER 4. OPTIMALITY CONDITIONS 
We prove in the sequel that the unimodality in question is equivalent 
to the property that the fill rate 1 - F(O) is monotone increasing in 
.6., which in turn is equivalent to the property that the optimal s for 
a given .6. is monotone decreasing in .6.. Anyone of these properties 
may appear to be self-evident without any condition; unfortunately, 
such is not the case. 
4.1 
The General Case 
First, we note that for any given .6. ~ 0, E( s,.6.) is convex in s, for 
we have from (3.69) that: 
82E(s,.6.) 
p+h 
rS 
8s2 
= 1+ R(.6.)[h(L,s) + J[sj+ r(S-u)h(L,u)du] > O. (4.1) 
However, E(s,.6.) is not, in general, convex or pseudoconvex on .6. ~ 
O. The necessary conditions for optimality, 8E/8s = 0, 8E/8.6. = 0, 
can be written as: 
1 
rS 
p 
1 + R(.6.) [H(L, S) + J[sj+ reS - u)H(L, u)du] = p + h' 
( 4.2) 
and 
p[.6. + R(.6.)] _ rS [1 + R(S _ u)]H(L, u)du = _k_. 
(4.3) 
p + h 
J[sj+ 
P + h 
For .6. ~ 0 given, let SO(.6.) minimize E(s, .6.); that is: 
E(sO(.6.),.6.) ~ E(s,.6.), -00 < s < 00. 
(4.4) 
By convexity in s of E(s, .6.), SO(.6.) is unique and is determined by 
(4.2). Let 
1 
rt1 
1(.6.) = 1 + R(.6.) [H(L,.6.) + Jo r(.6. - u)H(L, u)du], 
and define .6.1 by: 
P 
1(.6.t) = --h' 
p+ 
We have the following result for the sign of SO(.6.).

Proof The Lemma is an extension of Lemma 1 of ~ahin (1982). It can 
be seen that E( s, 6.) is increasing in s for s large enough. It follows, 
due to convexity of E(s, 6.) in s that if a/as E(s,6.)18=0 > (=)( < 
)0, that is if J(6.) > (=)( <)p/(p + h), then SO(6.) < (= )(»0 and 
conversely. Clearly, 6. is unique for every p/(p + h) ~ 0 if and only 
if J(6.) is monotone increasing on 6. ~ o. The inequality (4.7) is the 
necessary and sufficient condition for J( x) to be monotone increasing 
in x. This is obtained by using (3.35) - (3.36) in d/ dx J( x) ~ o. The 
latter can be written as:

The inequality (4.7) follows. 
Condition (4.7) is clearly satisfied for the special case of L = 0 
which results in Cn = 0 and (4.7) holds as equality. Note also that 
I(~) == 1"(0) for an inventory system operating under a (O,~) policy 
where 1"(0) is the fill rate given by (3.53). According to Lemma 
3.1,1'(0) is increasing in ~ (for any s) if 1 + R(x) is log-concave on 
x ~ O. Therefore, I( ~) is increasing in ~ and (4.7) is satisfied under 
the same condition. Finally, for the periodic review version of the 
model, A(x) = 1, x ~ 1, A(x) = 0, x < 1, and L -+ L + 1 imply 
Cn = 0, n ::; L, Cn = 1, n > L. In this case (4.7) holds when L = O. In 
general (4.7) poses an interesting characterization problem that has 
not yet been completely resolved. 

4.1. THE GENERAL CASE 
83 
Next, we record another useful result that was also noted in Sahin 
(1982). 
Lemma 4.2 For I(tJ.) ~ p/(p+ h) we have: 
Proof For I(tJ.) ~ p/(p + h), we have SO(tJ.) ~ 0 by Lemma 4.l. 
On comparing (3.53) with (4.3), we find that under any policy of the 
form (SO(tJ.),tJ. + SO(tJ.)), tJ. ~ 0, we have 
F(O) == P[I ~ OJ = h/(p + h). 
(4.10) 
On the other hand, we can state, for any s ~ 0, tJ. ~ 0 that 
{D(L) ~ s}:::;. {I> O}:::;. {D(L) ~ s + tJ.}. 
(4.11) 
Both implications follow from I = Ip - D(L) and s ~ Ip ~ S. The 
lemma follows from (4.10) and (4.11). 
\Ve are now in a position to establish .6.1, under the condition of 
its uniqueness, as a bound on .6.* and S*. For this purpose we define: 
M(tJ.) = k+ lail [l+R(tJ.-U)]{hH(L,U)-P[l-H(L,U)]}dU. (4.12) 
Theorem 4.1 Assume that condition (4.7) holds, then tJ. * > (= ).6. 1 , 
and S* > (=)tJ. 1 if and only if M(tJ.I) > (=)0. 
Proof We first show that M(.6.I) ~ 0 implies tJ.* ~ tJ. 1 . This part 
of the proof is based on the observation that N(sO(.6.),.6.) in (3.70) 
is monotone decreasing on 0 ~ .6. ~ .6.1. By Lemma 4.1, SO(.6.) ~ 0 
in this region and is determined by (4.2). For simplicity, we write 
SO(tJ.) == sand dsO(tJ.)/dtJ. == s'. We have: 
d 
dtJ. N(s, tJ.) 
= 
-p{(1 + s')[l + R(tJ.)J + sr(tJ.)}

r(~)[(p + h )JI(L, S) - ps] 
~ sr(~)[(p+ h)H(L,s) - p] ~ 0, 
( 4.13) 
where we used (4.2), the fact that JI(L,s) ~ sH(L,s), and Lemma 
4.2. 
Since R(~) is monotone increasing on ~ ~ 0, and, as shown 
above, N(s,~) is monotone decreasing on 0 ~ ~ ~ ~1' E(s,~) 
would be monotone decreasing on 0 ~ ~ ~ ~1 if N(s,~) ~ 0 in 
this region. As SO(~t) = 0 by Lemma 4.2, we have N(sO(~t)'~l) = 
M(~l) where M(~) is given by (4.12). Since M(~l) ~ 0 by assump-
tion, it follows that ~* ~ ~1 and, by Lemma 4.1, s* ~ o. 
Next we show that ~* ~ ~1 implies .Af(~l) ~ o. For ~* ~ ~b 
we have s* ~ 0 by Lemma 4.1. If we use (4.3) in (3.69) we find: 
( 4.14) 
On the other hand, consider 
(4.15) 
M(~l) < 0 implies E(O,~d < E(s*,~*) which is a contradiction; 
we must have M(~l) ~ o. We note that if M(~d = 0, then s* = 0 
and ~* = ~1 are optimal by (4.14)-(4.15). Conversely, if (0'~1) is 
the optimal policy, then (4.3) in (3.70) implies M(~l) = O. 
We have thus far proved that ~ * > (= )~1 if and only if 1v[( ~1) > 
(= )0. To complete the proof of the theorem, we now show that ~ * > 

4.1. THE GENERAL CASE 
85 
(= )~l if and only if S* > (= )~l' For this purpose, assume first that 
~* ~ ~l' We have s* :::; 0 by Lemma 4.1. From (4.2), ~* satisfies 
Q(S*) 
_ _ p_ 
I + R(~*) -
p + h' 
( 4.16) 
and, from Lemma 4.2, ~l is determined by 
where 
Q(~l) 
_ _ p_ 
I + R(~l) - P + h' 
(4.17) 
Q(x) = H(L,x) + fox rex - u)H(L,u)du. 
(4.18) 
It is seen that Q( x) is monotone increasing in x, for 
ddxQ(x) = h(L,x)+r(x)H(L,O)+ fox r(x-u)h(L,u)du ~ 0. (4.19) 
Consequently, by (4.16)-(4.17), ~* > (=)~l implies S* > (=)~l' 
Finally, assume ~* < ~l' We have s* > 0 by Lemma 4.1. For 
~ < ~b let sO(~) > 0 be determined by (4.2). Using implicit 
differentiation, we find: 
~sO(~) = _ q(s,~) + r(~)[H(L,s) - p/(p+ h)] 
d~ 
q(s,~) 
(4.20) 
where 
q(s,~) = h(L,S) + is res - u)h(L,u)du. 
(4.21) 
Since S = ~ + s, letting SO(~) = ~ + sO(~), we have: 
d~ SO(~) = 1 + d~ sO(~) 
= r(~)[p/(p+ h) - H(L,s)] > ° 
(4.22) 
q(s,~) 
-
where the inequality follows from Lemma 4.2. Consequently SO(~) 
is increasing in ~ on 0 :::; ~ :::; ~l' On the other hand, we have by 

86 
CHAPTER 4. OPTIMALITY CONDITIONS 
Lemma 4.1 that SO(~l) = 0, therefore SO(~d = ~1. It follows that 
SO(~) < ~1 on 0 ~ ~ < ~1 and S* < ~1. This completes the proof 
of the theorem. 
Theorem 4.1 and Lemma 4.1 together imply that if 1\1(~1) > 0 
then s* < 0 and ~* > S* > ~I, if M(~l) < 0 then s* > 0 and 
~* < S* < ~I, and if M(~l) = 0 then s* = 0 and ~* = ~1. Thus ~l 
is either a lower or an upper bound on ~ * and S*. These observations 
have important implications to the computation and approximation 
of optimal policies. We now give a sufficient optimality condition 
that is also useful in computations when E( s, ~) is not unimodal. 
Theorem 4.2 Assume condition 4.7 holds. If(s, A) and (8', ~), s ~ 
8', both satisfy the necessary optimality conditions, then E(s,A) ~ 
E(8',~). 
Proof First, assume M(~l) ~ 0 so that s* ~ O. Let (s, A) and 
(s,~), 8' ~ s ~ 0, both satisfy the necessary conditions (4.2)-(4.3). 
On using (4.3) in (3.69) we find, as asserted, that: 
E(s, A) = p[Pb L - s] ~ p[/Lb L - 8'] = E(s, ~). 
Pa 
/La 
( 4.23) 
Next assume M(~d ~ O. Let s ~ 8' ~ 0 both satisfy the necessary 
optimality conditions. By a similar substitution as above, we find: 
E(s, A) = -ps + (p + s)Ji(s) + p/Lb L 
/La 
~ -p8' + (p + h)Ji(s) + p/Lb L = E(8', ~). 
/La 
(4.24) 
The inequality follows from the observation that J(s) == -ps + (p + 
h)Ji(L,s), where s == SO(~) is decreasing in s as dJ/ds = -p+ (p+ 
h)H(L,s) ~ 0 by Lemma 3. 
Our next concern is with the unimodality of E(s,~). Because of 
convexity in s for every ~ ~ 0, it is sufficient to consider the shape 

4.1. THE GENERAL CASE 
87 
of E(sO(~),~) on ~ ~ O. It turns out that the cost rate function 
is unimodal if and only if SO(~) is monotone decreasing in ~ or, 
equivalently, if and only if F(O) is monotone increasing in ~. 
Theorem 4.3 The following statements are equivalent on ~ ~ 0: 
1. E(sO(~),~) is unimodal (pseudoconvex) for every p ~ 0, h ~ 0 
(p + h > 0), and k ~ 0; 
2. SO(~) is monotone decreasing in ~; 
3. 1 - F(O) is monotone increasing in ~. 
Proof We have from (4.2) and (3.53) that: 
dsO(~) = _ of(O) JOF(O) 
d~ 
o~ 
as 
( 4.25) 
Since oP(O)j as ~ 0, we conclude that 2. and 3. are equivalent. 
To complete the proof, we may regard the left-hand-side, <1>(~), 
of (4.3) a function of ~ only, with s == SO(~) determined from (4.2). 
Since <1> (0) = 0, it is clear that E( SO (~), ~) is unimodal for every 
p, hand k if and only if <1>(~) is monotone increasing on ~ ~ O. 
dj d~ <1>( ~) > 0 can be written, after substituting (4.2) as: 
d 
{S'[P!h -H(L,s)]<O ,if s~O, 
d~ <1>(~) > 0 {} 
s' < 0 
, if s < O. 
( 4.26) 
The equivalence of 1. and 2. then follows from Lemma 4.2. 
Theorem 4.3 may be useful in many cases to establish the uni-
modality of E(s,~) through the monotonicity of F(O) or of SO(~). 
In view of Lemma 3.1, one immediate consequence is the following. 
Corollary 4.1 E(s,~) is unimodal if 1 + R(x) is log-concave on 
x ~ O. 

88 
CHAPTER 4. OPTIMALITY CONDITIONS 
This result is proved in Stidham (1986) through separate argu-
ments for systems with convex holding and shortage costs. Under 
a slightly stronger assumption-that R( x) is concave-a proof that is 
more in line with the above developments was given in gahin (1982). 
Unfortunately, 1 + R( x) is not concave or log-concave for many distri-
butions of practical interest. The only general class of distributions 
that are included are the class of Decreasing Failure Rate (DFR) 
distributions. It should be emphasized, however, that the results ob-
tained above are not conditional on the specific values of p, hand k. 
It is clear that E(s,.6.) may be convex or pseudo convex in a given 
situation under some values of these parameters without additional 
assumptions. 
Sharper results can be obtained when L = ° 
or when batch sizes 
are all unity. We now take these up in turn.

Continuous Review 
For the continuous review model, L = °

in chapter 3 and in this chapter, we find:

We also observe that 1(.6..) = 1 (d. equation (4.5)) and the necessary 
optimality conditions, from (4.2)-(4.3), are: 
1 + R(S) 
_p_ 
1+ R(.6..) -
h + p' 
(4.29) 
and 
p[.6.. + R(.6..)]- (p + h)[S + R(S)] = k. 
(4.30) 
The following are easy consequences of these and the related re-
sults proved above. 
Corollary 4.2 SO(.6..) ~ 0 for .6.. ~ 0 and s* ~ o. 
Corollary 4.3 I-F(O) is monotone increasing in.6.., SO(.6..) is mono-
tone decreasing in .6.., and E(sO(.6..),.6..) is unimodal for all p ~ 0, 
h ~ 0 (p+ h > 0), and k ~ 0 if and only ifl+ R(x) is log-concave. 
Corollary 4.2 follows from Lemma 4.1 and the fact that 1(.6..) = 1 
for L = O. In Corollary 4.3, the statement that 1 - F(O) is monotone 
increasing if and only if 1 + R(x) is log-concave follows from (4.27). 
The rest are then implied by Theorem 4.3. Log-concavity of 1 + R( x) 
was first shown to be both necessary and sufficient in Stidham (1977) 
for the unimodality of E( s,.6..) in the case of zero lead times. This 
condition is sufficient but not necessary for L > O. 
4.2.2 
Periodic Review 
For the periodic review system under immediate deliveries, results 
of section 4.2 on the fill rate and the cost rate function specialize to 
L = 0 as follows.

Recall that lit ( x) is the c.dJ. of the forward recurrence time at 
time t, denoted by lit, of the renewal sequence of periodic demands (cf. 
Section 2.1.3). Therefore, V~ represents the excess or the overshoot 
with respect to level ~ caused by a period demand that triggers an 
order. Expressions for lIt(x) and its p.d.f. Vt(x) are given in (2.25) 
and (2.19)-(2.36). 
We next show that E(s,~) is unimodal under a weaker condition 
than the log-concavity of 1 - R( x). 
Theorem 4.4 1 - F(O) is increasing in ~ if 1 + R( x) is log-concave 
or if r( x) is concave increasing. 
Proof That 1 - F(O) is increasing in ~ if 1 + R( x) is log-concave 
follows from Lemma 3.1. Assume therefore that r( x) is concave in-
creasing.

The last inequality holds if R(x)/r(x) is increasing in x 2: O. This is 
assured by Lemma 2.4. 
As a consequence of Theorems 4.3 and 4.4, we can now state the 
following. 
Corollary 4.4 sO(~) is monotone decreasing in!:l. and E(so(!:l.),~) 
is unimodal (pseudoconvex) on !:l. ~ 0 for all p ~ 0, h 2: 0 (p+ h > 0) 
and J( 2: 0, if 1 + R( x) is log-concave or r( x) is concave increasing. 
Accordingly, contrary to continuous review systems with zero lead-
times, log-concavity of 1 + R(x) is not necessary for the unimodality 
of the cost rate function in periodic review systems with zero lead 
times. The same is also true for continuous and periodic review sys-
tems with positive lead times. 
As a simple example, consider the demand density b( x) = .x2xe- h
, 
x ~ O. The renewal density and the renewal function are given in 
Section 2.1.4. It can be seen that r( x) is concave increasing and The-
orem 4.4 and its corollary apply. But 1 + R( x) is not concave or 
log-concave on x ~ o.

Unit Demands 
For the model of section 3.1.4 under unit demands, we have 1 + 
R( /1) = 1 + /1 which is concave, therefore log-concave. Accordingly, 
the requirement of Lemma 3.1 is formally satisfied. However, separate 
proofs are required for the corresponding results on the shapes of 
1 - F(O) and E(s, /1). It is easy to see that 1 - F(O) is monotone 
increasing in /1. For on using (3.81) we have:

The inequality follows from the facts that H(j) < H(S -1), j < S -1, 
and L:f~[~-1]+ = S :s; /1 + 1 if s :s; 0, = /1 + 1 if s > O. 
This finding anticipates that E( s, /1) is unimodal without addi-
tional assumptions. This in fact holds as we next show.

In view of (4.45) and (4.46), we conclude that E( s, Ll) is point-
wise convex. Therefore, the necessary optimality conditions are also 
sufficient. These conditions are: D~E(s,Ll) ~ 0, D~E(s,Ll-1) < 0, 

94 
CHAPTER 4. OPTIMALITY CONDITIONS 
DsE(s,~) ~ 0, and DsE(s -1,~) < 0; they can be written as (4.41) 
and (4.42). This completes the proof. 
Finally, we note the counterpart of Lemma 4.1 which is useful in 
computational work.

Proof Let ~ ~ 0 be arbitrary but fixed. From convexity, it follows 
that the reorder point s that minimizes E(s,~) is negative if and 
only if DsE(s,~)ls=o > O. This amounts to <.p(~) > p/(p + h). The 
corollary follows from the fact that <.p( ~) is monotone increasing in

In particular, in the case of immediate deliveries, we have H( L, n) = 
1, n ~ 0; therefore <.p(~) = 1 for ~ ~ 0, s* ::; o. 

Chapter 5 
Optimal Policies and 
Approximations 
For the inventory systems investigated in the previous chapters, the 
stationary optimal policy can be determined in principle by finding 
the global minimum of the corresponding cost rate function. (For 
previous work in this area, see, for example, Veinott and Wagner, 
1965; Archibald and Silver, 1978; and Federgruen and Zipkin, 1984). 
However, computational difficulties make the exact models unattrac-
tive in practice. This has motivated several approaches for the de-
termination of approximately optimal (8, S) policies that require less 
computational effort and demand information. For continuous review 
systems, most of the earlier work was confined to the unit demands 
case under an order-quantity, reorder-point policy. This literature is 
based on approximations derived by Hadley and Whitin (1963) and 
·Wagner (1969) which require the simultaneous iterative solution of 
two equations (cf. Gross and Tnce, 1975; Gross, Harris and Roberts, 
1972; Nahmias, 1976; and others). For periodic review systems, ap-
proximately optimal policies that require little computational effort 
were proposed previously by Naddor (1975, 1980), Ehrhardt (1979), 
Ehrhardt and Kastner (1980), Ehrhardt and Mosier (1984), Freeland 
and Porteus (1980), Federgruen and Zipkin (1983), and others. These 
and other approaches have been reviewed by Porteus (1985). 

96 
CHAPTER 5. OPTIMAL POLICIES 
Although reduced significantly, the computational effort required 
for the implementation in practice of most of these approximations is 
still discouraging. One exception is the Power Approximation for pe-
riodic review systems (Ehrhardt, 1979; Ehrhardt and Mosier, 1984) 
which is distribution-free and easily computable. Its accuracy is ques-
tionable, however, under some parameter configurations (see part 
5.1.3 below). 
In order to be widely usable in practice, any approximation must 
fulfill two general requirements: 1) it must be accurate for pre-spec-
ified and wide range of parameter values, and 2) it must be distri-
bution-free and easily computable. In relation to the first requirement, 
it should also be emphasized that by accurate we mean practically the 
same as the optimal policy. As in most cases the cost rate function is 
rather flat around its global minimum, an approximation error that 
results in more than one or two percent relative cost increase should 
be considered excessive. It is important that the range of parameter 
values for which such accuracy is achieved by the approximation is 
also specified as an integral part of the approximation. Clearly, any 
approximation will perform well under some scenarios and fail under 
others. 
In view of these considerations, perhaps the most promising ap-
proach to developing accurate approximations to stationary control 
policies that requires minimal computational effort and demand infor-
mation is the one based on asymptotic renewal theory (cf. Roberts, 
1962; Ehrhardt, 1979; Ehrhardt and Mosier, 1984; Tijms and Gron-
evelt, 1984; Sahin and Sinha,1987). In this chapter, we will review 
some of these approximations. Following a brief look at the unit de-
mands case, our primary concern in section 5.1 will be with the iden-
tification of simple, distribution-free conditions under which asymp-
totic approximations are accurate for continuous and periodic review 
systems with zero lead times. 
Under these conditions, we will compare the performances of var-
ious approxim'ations with those of the optimal policies using gamma, 
Weibull, truncated normal, inverse Gaussian, and log-normal distri-

5.1. IMMEDIATE DELIVERIES 
97 
butions for demand. In section 5.2, we will extend these approxima-
tions to positive lead times under the additional simplification that 
the lead time demand distribution is approximately normal. 
5.1 
Immediate Deliveries 
For L = 0 the models and computational problems are much simpler. 
The case is of practical interest when the lead time is negligible. We 
begin with unit demands, followed by batch demands and periodic 
review systems. 
5.1.1 
Unit Demands 
Recall from section 4.3 that the cost rate function is pointwise convex 
and that s* < 0 in the case of immediate deliveries. For L = 0, the 
optimality conditions (4.41)-(4.42) are reduced to: 
1 + S* > p[l + ~ *] > S* 
p+h 
-
, 
(5.1) 
2 
~* > 2k - (p+ h)s*(l- s*) ~ ~* 
+ 
h(l + ~*) 
(5.2) 
Thus the optimal policy is distribution-free. (Actually it only depends 
on the mean interdemand time through k = J(//-la.) And, it can be 
very easily computed by a simple algorithm. Some examples are 
provided by Table 5.1 where we parametrized by: 
p/h: 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 20 
2J(//-lah: 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 
Note that the order size is ~* + 1 and the reorder point is s* -1, due 
to our convention of ordering up to S* when the inventory position 
is < s*(= s* - 1).

5.1.2 
Batch Demands 
For the continuous review system with batch demands, the cost rate 
function is given by (4.28) and the optimality conditions by (4.29)-
(4.30). We also know in this case that 8* ::; 0 (Corollary 4.2) and if 
there are multiple solutions to the optimality conditions, the one with 
the largest 8 represents the global minimum (Theorem 4.2), subject 
to condition (4.7). 
When it holds, the last result reduces the optimal policy compu-
tations to a one-dimensional search process. Starting from a suitable 
initial 8(0) < 0, for example, trial values of 8 can be generated by 
8(n) = s(n-l) -
En where En > 0 is a suitable step size. At each it-
eration ~ 
(n) can be computed from (4.29). If (4.30) also holds, then 
(8(n),~(n)) is optimal. Note that for a given 8(n), ~(n), computed 
from (4.29) or (4.18), may not be unique. But, in any event, the 
~ (n) value that together with 8(n), also satisfies the other condition 
is optimal. According to Corollary 4.3, the optimality conditions are 
also sufficient if the renewal function of the batch size distribution is 
log-concave. 
\Ve have used this algorithm successfully with the gamma, Weibull, 
truncated normal, inverse Gaussian, and lognormal batch size distri-
butions. As noted at the beginning of Chapter 4, E( 8, ~) is convex 
in 8 for ~ ~ 0 fixed. For fixed 8, on the other hand, E( 8, ~) assumed 
different shapes as a function of Ll and of the other parameter val-
ues. Three of the most frequently encountered shapes are shown in 
Figures 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3 for 8 = O. The convex shape seen in Figure 
5.1 is typical of DFR gamma and Weibull distributions (for which 
R(x) is concave), irrespective of other parameter values; and of all 
distributions for k large enough. What is large enough depended, 
however, on the distribution and the shape parameter value. For the 
gamma distribution, for example, the shape in Figure 5.1 prevailed 
for a = 2 even when k = 10. For a = 7, however, the shape of 
E(O,~) was of the Figure 5.2 type all the way to k = 100. Generally 
speaking, high coefficients of variation (> 1) induced the Figure 5.1 
shape, lower dispersion (0.3 < Cb < 1) resulted in shapes like in Fig-

ure 5.2 and lowest values of Cb( < 0.3) were associated with the shape 
seen in Figure 5.3. Higher values of k (= J(/Jla) had a moderating 
effect on the shape of the cost rate function (i.e., Figure 5.2 rather 
than 5.3 or 5.1 rather than 5.2). 
These observations are based on a scale parameter value of (3 = 1 
in all distributions. They remain valid, however, for other values of (3. 
Values of the cost rate function and the control parameters under any 
scale parameter (3 can be related to their corresponding values under 
(3 = 1. For this we refer to the relations noted at the end of section 
2.2.1. (As in that section, we modify the notation in an obvious way 
to emphasize certain relationships.) Since R((3; x) = R(1; x / (3) and 
R((3;x) = (3R(l;x/(3), we find from (4.28) that: 
E((3;s,tl,k) = (3E(l;s/(3,tl/(3,k/(3). 
(5.3) 
It follows that s*((3;k) = (3s*(l;k/(3), tl*((3;k) = (3tl*(l;k/(3), and 
E*((3;k) = (3E*(l;k/(3). Thus the optimal values of both control

parameters and the cost rate function under an arbitrary scale pa-
rameter (3 and setup cost ]( are simply (3 times the corresponding 
quantities under (3 = 1 and setup cost ](1(3. 
The cost rate function (4.28) (s ~ 0) can be approximated by 
replacing, for S large enough, R(b..), R(S) and R(b..) by their asymp-
totic approximations (cf. (2.70)):

According to our findings in part 2.2.3, these approximations would 
be accurate for the class of distributions under consideration (and 
for others with similar characteristics) if sa ~ p( f )Ilb for a sui table 
f> O. Note that since b..a > sa, if sa is large enough in this sense, 
so is b..a; and sa, ,6. a , and sa are all accurate. The most suitable 
value for f among the set {0.01, 0.05, 0.10, 0.20} turned out to be 
0.20. This selection was based on extensive comparative numerical 
work; it represents a conservative choice (cf. Sinha, 1985). Using the 
approach discussed in part 2.2.3, the convergence measure p(0.20) 
was then estimated to be: 
p(0.20) = 1.615cl- 2.397cb + 1.353.

Thus, if 
sa 2: p(.20)/-lb, 
(5.10) 
then the approximations (5.6), (5.7) and (5.8) are expected to be 
accurate. Evidently, both the approximation and the accuracy con-
dition are distribution free; they depend on the mean interdemand 
time {La 
(k = I(j /-la) and the first two moments of the batch size 
distribution. 
If (sa,.6. a) are accurate in the above sense then - psa is a good 
approximation for E( s* ,.6. *) = -ps* of the zero lead time model (cf. 
(4.10)). Since E(O,O) = k, the stay-out-of-business condition can be 
approximated by: 
(5.11) 
Thus, if (5.11) holds, then sa = ~a = O. However, this should be con-
tingent on condition (5.10), for otherwise sa may not be sufficiently 
accurate. Based on these, an algorithm for asymptotic approxima-
tions can be described as follows: 
1. Compute sa from (5.8). 
2. If (5.10) does not hold, then the approximations may not be 
accurate. 
3. If (5.10) holds, compute sa from (5.6). 
4. If sa ~ -kip, then take sa = .6.a = 0; the item need not be 
stocked. 
5. If sa > -kip, then sa and ~a, computed (5.7), will be accurate. 
Performance of the approximate control policy (sa,.6. a) has been 
tested extensively, using the demand batch size distributions men-
tioned above. Some results for p ---+ 00 are presented in Table 5.2. 
Note, from part 4.2.1 that as p ---+ 00, s* ---+ 0, and .6.* is obtained

so that the optimization problem is one-dimensional. The same prob-
lem arises by restricting s to non-negative values so that s* = 0 when 
L = 0 (cf. Sahin and Sinha, 1987). It can be seen that the asymptotic 
approximation for ~ * in this case is:

and that limp --+oo sa = limp --+oo ~ a = ~(s=O)' as expected. Table 5.2 
is based on ~(s=O)' ~(s=O)' the accuracy condition: 
(5.14) 
which corresponds to (5.10), and the do not stock condition: 
(5.15) 
This latter condition is obtained from the optimality condition f) / f)~ 
E(O,~) = 0 which implies: 
E(~*) = h[l + R(~*)l ~ h[~* + /I C 1 
r(~ *) 
rb b, 
(5.16) 
where we used the asymptotic approximations for Rand r. 
The measure used in assessing the performances of the various 
approximations was the relative cost increase due to approximation, 
computed from: 
(5.17) 
We noted above that if f3 is a scale parameter of the batch size 
distribution B( x), then (with an appropriate modification in our 
notation) E*(f3;k) = f3E*(l;k/f3). 
Similarly, it can be seen that 
Ea(f3;k) = f3Ea(l;k/f3). This follows from ~a(f3;k) = f3~a(l;k/f3) 
and sa(f3; k) = f3sa(l; k/ (3) which in turn implied by (5.7) or (5.13) 

5.1. IMMEDIATE DELIVERIES 
107 
and (5.16), respectively. Consequently, RE(f3; k) = RE(l; k/ (3) and 
the performance of (~a (f3; k), sa (f3; k)) is the same as the performance 
of(~a(l; k/(3), sa(1;k/f3)). 
Cases for which ~a is imaginary, or the accuracy condition (5.14) 
is not satisfied are marked n.a. in Table 5.2. For all other param-
eter values, ~ 
a is large enough to be a good approximation for ~ *. 
These include the cases for which ~a = 0, as induced by condition 
(5.15). Because of the use of asymptotic approximations in its con-
struction, (5.15) should be applicable in approximating the do not 
stock condition essentially when ~a is large enough in the sense of 
condition (5.14). However, condition (5.15) was generally applicable 
in predicting ~* = 0, even when (5.14) did not hold. Also, for most 
of the cases examined ~* = 0 when ~a was negative or imaginary. 
In spite of these, Table 5.2 is filled conservatively by accepting ~a as 
accurate only on the basis of (5.14). 
The important conclusion from Table 5.2 is that ~(s=O) is appli-
cable and accurate under most parameter configurations of practi-
cal interest. Applicability of the approximation deteriorates quickly, 
however, when Cb > 1.5. When condition (5.14) holds, the approxi-
mations are practically the same as the optimal policies. Results for 
a set of values of J( / Itah are presented in more detail in Appendix 
1. These include the exact and approximate policies, and the corre-
sponding approximation errors. 
The degree of accuracy of the approximations computed from 
(5.6)-(5.7) for finite p should be the same as those for p -- 00, in 
the sense that whenever the accuracy condition (5.10) holds (sa, ~a) 
should be practically the same as (s*, ~ *). This observation is based 
on the extensive numerical work performed on the periodic review 
model, as reported in the next part. However, the range of applica-
bility of the approximations will be reduced in that condition (5.10) is 
a stronger condition than (5.14). This is clear from (5.8) because sa 
is increasing in p. In spite of this negative effect, condition (5.10) is 
still weak enough to hold for most parameter configurations of prac-
tical interest. Table 5.3 presents these configurations in terms of the 

108 
CHAPTER 5. OPTIMAL POLICIES 
values of q, pjh and the lower bound on Kjhf1af1b for which condi-
tion (5.10) holds. The latter is the average set up cost per unit per 
unit time, measured in units of h. 
5.1.3 
Periodic Review 
The idea of using renewal-theoretic asymptotic approximations for 
the optimal stationary periodic review policies goes back to Roberts 
(1962). In terms of the zero-lead-time model, he showed that if K ----+ 
00 and p ----+ 00, in such a way as to keep s* fixed, then: 
(5.18) 
Thus if ~ * is large enough, then it can be approximated by the 
economic order quantity which requires only the expected demand. 
Complete demand distribution is still needed, however, to compute 
an approximation for s* from: 
1
00 
h~* 
(x - s*)b(x)dx = -h- + o(~*). 
s· 
+ p 
(5.19) 
To eliminate this need, Wagner (1975) modified the approximations 
by substituting a normal distribution for the actual demand distri-
bution. More recently, Ehrhardt (1979) and Ehrhardt and Mosier 
(1984) used regression analysis to fit approximations of the above 
form to a set of known optimal policies. 
From a practical point of view, the critical question, as in part 
5.1.2, is: how large is large enough for K and p and in what relation-
ship should they grow? These questions were addressed in ~ahin and 
Sinha (1987) through a new set of approximations based on asymp-
totic renewal theory. In this part we discuss these approximations 
and their accuracy. 
We begin by specializing some of the results we proved in section 
4.1 to periodic review systems under immediate deliveries. First,

CHAPTER 5. OPTIMAL POLICIES 
by Lemma 4.1 and the discussion following its statement, we know 
that sO(~) > (=)0 if and only if ~ < (= )~1 where ~1 is uniquely 
determined by R(~t) = p/h. The latter characterization follows from 
(4.3) which for the periodic review system with L = 0 takes the form: 
1

R(A ) = --h'

(5.20) 
Theorem 4.1 then implies that ~ * > (= )~1 and S* > (= )~1 if and 
only if: 
(5.21) 
Consequently, if M(~l) > 0 then s* < 0 and ~* > S* > ~t, and if 
M(~t) ~ 0 then s* ;::: 0 and ~* ~ S* ~ ~1' We now consider the 
consequences of these in turn. 
For M(~l) > 0, since ~1 is a lower bound on S* and ~*, if ~1 
is large then so are S* and ~ *. Also, s* < 0 and the optimality 
conditions are given by (4.36)-(4.37). In terms of the convergence 
measure introduced above, ~1 is large if ~1 ;::: I-lbP( E) for a suitable 
Eo It can then be approximated by using the asymptotic form of R(t) 
in R(~l) = p/h. This results in 
(5.22) 
Also, on substituting the asymptotic form of R(t) in M(~l) > 0, we 
find: 
T.' 
h~i 
.I\. >--. 
21-lb 
(5.23) 
Putting these together with ~1 ;::: I-lbP( E), we obtain: 
(5.24 ) 
where Cb = (1+ct)/2. The right-hand-side inequality implies AI(~t) 
> 0, so that s* < 0 and ~* > S* > ~1' while the left-hand-side 
inequality stipulates what constitutes a large enough p to ensure that 
~1 is large. 

5.1. IMMEDIATE DELIVERIES 
111 
In emprical evaluations of the approximations and their accuracy 
conditions, the left-hand-side condition for large ~1 turned out to be 
too stringent. Note that the lower bound in question decreases with 
increasing f. However, even for f = 0.20, this condition excluded pa-
rameter configurations resulting in highly accurate approximations 
and larger f values were not consistently appropriate. As an alterna-
tive, we used the condition: 
(5.25) 
to identify large p (and ~1). This is obtained by approximating 
R(~l) by ~dJ-lb in R(~l) = p/h. 
Under these stipulations, if we replace the renewal function and 
its integral in the optimality conditions (4.36) and (4.37) by their 
asymptotic approximations, and solve the resulting system, we obtain 
the following approximations for (s*, ~ *): 
(5.26) 
(5.27) 
where 
(5.28) 
These approximations are distribution-free and easily computable. 
For M(~l) :::; 0, we have s* ~ 0 and ~1 ~ S* ~ ~*. Therefore, 
if ~ * is large, then so are S* and ~1. On using the asymptotic ap-
proximations for R(t) and R(t) (cf. (5.4) and (5.5)) and the limiting 
form of the forward recurrence time distribution (cf. 2.60) in the 
optimality conditions (4.34)-(4.35), we find:

Note, however, that (5.33) is not sufficientfor the accuracy of (sa,.6.a). 
It may be that .6.* is small and .6. a is inaccurate and large in the sense 
of (5.33). Choice of an appropriate value for f as well as the validity of 
these accuracy conditions are based on the empirical considerations 
that follow. 
As we note below, (5.29)-(5.30) can be solved iteratively through 
a modest computational effort. However, as opposed to the case of 
M(.6.1) > 0, determination of (sa, .6.a) is not explicit when .1\1(.6.1 ) < 
o and the full demand distribution is still required. A simplification 
can be obtained by noting that:

sa, it is distribution-free and easily computable. 
The power approximation of Ehrhardt (1979) and the revised 
power approximation of Ehrhardt and Mosier (1984) are also based 
on asymptotic renewal theory. Expressions (5.18) and (5.19) are used 
to design regression models which are then fitted to a grid of 288 
inventory items with known optimal policies, computed under the 
assumptions of Poisson and negative binomial demand distributions. 
A fixed lead time of L ~ 0 periods is allowed between the placement 
and delivery of an order. For L = 0, the revised power approximation 
is: 
0.183 
ST = 0.973j.lb + (1.063 - 2.192z + --)ab, 
z 
~T = 1.30Jl~.494(1 + Cl)0.166(~ )0.506, 
where z = [h~r /pab]l/2. 
(5.36) 
(5.37) 
Using the gamma, Wei bull , truncated normal, inverse Gaussian 
and the lognormal distributions, this time in describing periodic de-
mands, we undertook a comprehensive evaluation of the approxima-
tions reported above. As before, it turns out that we could restrict 
ourselves, without any loss, to a scale parameter value of one in 
all these distributions. It can be seen, again, that E(f3; s,~, K) = 
f3E(l;s/f3,~/f3,K/f3). Therefore, s*(f3;K) = f3s*(l;K/f3), ~*(f3;K) 
= f3~*(l;K/f3), and E*(f3;K) = f3E*(l;K/f3). These also hold for 
(sa, ~a), determined by either of (5.26)-(5.27), (5.29)-(5.30), (5.29)-
(5.35), and for (sr, ~T). For example, it is seen from (5.26)-(5.27) 
that Ilb(f3) = f3Jlb(l) and Cb(f3) = Cb(l) imply A(f3;K) = A(1;K/f3). 
Therefore, sa(f3;K) = f3sa(1;K/f3), ~a(f3;K) = f3~a(1;K/f3). This 
ability to restrict 13 to 1 without losing information made it possible 
to carry out the computations for wide ranges of the shape parameter 
values of each of the distributions in the set. The shape parameter 
values used and the corresponding means (13 = 1) and coefficients 
of variation were as in Table 2.1. The upper and lower limits on 
shape parameter values were chosen to include most contingencies 
that may arise in practice. It is unlikely that outside these limits the 
distributions in question would arise as demand distributions. 

114 
CHAPTER 5. OPTIMAL POLICIES 
Determination of the optimal policies requires the accurate com-
putation of the renewal function and certain integrals that involve 
the renewal function. 
As mentioned previously, for this purpose 
we used the generalized cubic splining algorithm of McConalogue 
(1981) which is basically designed to compute convolutions Bn(x) of 
a distribution. The renewal function is then computed from R( x) = 
Ll Bn(x), with an appropriate convergence criterion on Bn(x) and 
other renewal-theoretic functions and terms that appear in the cost 
rate function and the optimality conditions are computed by inte-
grating the spline representation of Bn (x) or of R( x ). 
Theorem 4.2 reduces the computation of the optimal policies to a 
simple search procedure that could be started from a suitable upper 
bound on s*. If M(.6.I) ~ 0, then 0 is an upper bound. If M(.6.t) > 0, 
then s+ is an upper bound, as determined from B(s+) = p/(p + h); 
this follows from Lemma 4.2. In the first case we started from the 
initial approximation (0, .6.t), which satisfies (4.36), and in the second 
case from (s+,O), which satisfies (4.34). We then iterated through 
sen) = S(n-I) - On where On > 0 is a suitable step size. At each 
iteration, given Sen), .6.(n) was computed from (4.34) or (4.36). If 
(4.35) or (4.37) also held, (s(n),.6.(n)) was identified as the optimal 
policy. 
Computation of the power approximation and the asymptotic ap-
proximation when M(.6.I) > 0 are immediate. When M(.6. I) < 0, the 
asymptotic approximation can be computed as the simultaneous iter-
ative solution of (5.29)-(5.30) or (5.29)-( 5.35) by an algorithm similar 
to the well-known algorithm of Hadley and Whitin (1963). We may 
regard (5.29)-(5.30), for example, as equations in sand .6., with it-
erative solutions (s(n), .6.(n)), n = 0,1, ... , and simultaneous solution 
(sa, .6.a). By iterative solutions we mean .6. = .6.(n) is the solution 
of (5.30) for s = s(n), and s = s(n+1) is the solution of (5.30) for 
.6. = .6.(n), iteratively for n = 0,1, .... As determined by (5.29), s is 
monotone decreasing in .6.; and, as determined by (.5.30), .6. is mono-
tone decreasing in s. The first observation is evident. The second 
can be seen from d.6./ds < 0 which holds provided .6. > o. Also, for 

5.1. IMMEDIATE DELIVERIES 
115 
8(0) = 0 we can obtain from (5.30): 
(5.38) 
which can be seen to be ~ 0 under condition (5.32). For s(l) ~ 0 we 
need (1 + p/h - Cb)Pb -
,6.(0) ~ 0 which also holds under condition 
(5.32). Consequently, if we start with s(O) = 0 and ,6.(0), we have 
s(1) ~ O. The monotonicity properties noted above then imply that 
{,6.(n) , 
n ~ O} is decreasing and {s(n), 
n ~ O} increasing. These 
sequences converge to (sa, ,6. a) quite rapidly. 
The performance measure used in the evaluation of all approxi-
mations was the relative cost increase under the approximate policy, 
given by (5.17). As in the continuous review case, it can be seen 
that RE(f3; K) = RE(l; K / f3) for all the approximations given above. 
Therefore, their performances under the demand distribution B(f3; x) 
and setup cost K are the same as their respective performances under 
B(l;x) and K/f3. 
As noted before, the shape parameter values used in demand dis-
tributions were as in Table 2.1. The cost parameter settings were: 
p/h: 
1, 2, 
3, 
5, 
10, 
20 
K / h: 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 
These resulted in 1,080 cases. For each case we computed the opti-
mal policy and the three approximations given above and their costs 
and relative errors. In terms of the convergence measure p( f), the 
most appropriate values for f, chosen by trial and error from the 
set {0.01, 0.05, 0.10, 0.20} were f = 0.20 in condition (5.25) and 
f = 0.10 in condition (5.33). Using the polynomial approximations 
for p(.20) and p(.10), introduced in section 2.2.3, an algorithm for 
asymptotic approximations can be outlined as follows: 
1. If 
~ ~ 1.353 - 2.397q + 1.615c~, 
(5.39) 
wher'e Cb is the demand coefficient of variation, go to step 2.; other-
wise, (sa,,6. a) may not be accurate.

2. If

2I( 
h -

( 5.40) 
where Cb = (1 + c~)/2, then sa ~ 0 (s* ~ 0) and (sa,~a), computed 
from (5.26)-(5.27) will be accurate. 
3. 
If (5.40) holds as >, then sa > 0 (s* > 0) and (sa,~a), 
computed from (5.26)-(5.29) or (5.29)-(5.35) will be accurate, provided 
that 
~a 
-
~ 1. 720 - 3.383cb + 2.4 79c~; 
/-Lb 
otherwise, (sa, ~ a) may not be accurate. 
(5.41) 
The right-hand-side of (5.39) is p( .20) and that of (5.41) is p( .10) (> 
p(.20)). The reason for the relevance of two different measures of 
convergence is that (5.39) is a condition for the lower bound ~l 
of ~*(~ ~a) to be large, while (5.41) is a condition for ~a itself 
to be large. Note that in addition to implying accurate (sa,~a) 
when (5.40) holds, condition (5.39) is necessary for the accuracy of 
(5.40). For if (5.39) does not hold (~l is not large enough) then 
there is no assurance that (5.40) will correctly predict the sign of s*. 
Note also that for p/h = 1,2, and 3 respectively, (5.39) holds when 
Cb < 1.32, 1.72, and 2, and that for Cb = 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5, (5.41) 
holds when ~a / /-Lb > 0.65,0.82,2.22. Thus both conditions are weak 
enough to be generally applicable. Regions of accuracy of asymptotic 
approximations for Cb = 0.25(0.25)2.00 are shown in Table 5.4. 
Performances of the asymptotic approximation computed with 
the above algorithm (using (5.29)-(5.30) when (5.40) holds as » and 
the power approximation computed from (5.36)-(5.37) are summa-
rized in Table 5.5. In terms of the performance measure RE, both 
approximations performed well in 936 cases that exclude only the IG 
distribution with j3 = 20.0 and the LN distribution with j3 ~ 1.5. 
These represent (with very few exceptions) cases for which the accu-
racy conditions are satisfied. Performance of the asymptotic approx-
imation, however, was much better than the power approximation.

and their relative errors are given in Appendix 2 for some parameter 
configurations. 
Condition (5.39) was violated in 84 (out of 1,080) cases. Most 
of these (60) occurred under LN, 0: = 2,3. Other violations were 
under LN, 0: = 1.5, pjh = 1,2; WL, 0: = 0.6, pjh = 1; and IG, 
0: = 0.5, pj h = 1. Most of these latter are rather extreme cases 
that are unlikely to arise in practice. When condition (5.39) held, so 
that ~1 was large enough, (5.40) correctly predicted the sign of s* in 
all except 40 cases. In all the failures, the inequality in (5.40) held 
as :::; while s* > O. Most failures were inconsequential, however, in 
that both s*(> 0) and sa( < 0) were close to zero and the accuracy 
of (sa, ~ a) was not measurably affected. (In 32 out of 40 failures 
we found s* < 0.5; and, s* = 1.43 (> 1) in only one case). When 
condition (5.39) was satisfied and (5.40) held as >, indicating large 
~1 and s* > 0, the accuracy condition (5.41) was satisfied in all 
but 38 cases. Most of the violations (29) occurred under IG, 0: 2: 8 
and LN, 0: = 2.0. Thus both accuracy conditions were satisfied and 
condition (5.40) was successful in most of the cases we examined. 
Violations were confined to larger demand coefficients of variation 
than about 2.0 and to extreme parameter configurations. 
In almost all cases satisfying the accuracy conditions, the asymp-
totic approximation (sa, ~a), computed from (5.26)-(5.27) and (5.29)-
(5.30), was practically the same as the optimal policy. In these cases, 
the revised power approximation (ST, ~T) also performed well in terms 
of the performance measure RE. However, at times (ST, ~T) was con-
siderably different from the optimal policy (see Appendix 2). When 
s* > 0 and (sa, ~ a) is computed from (5.29)-( 5.35), so that (given sa) 
~ 
a is distribution-free, the asymptotic approximation was again ex-
tremely accurate under the same conditions. However, when pj h was 
large (i.e., 2: 10) and Kjh was small (i.e., :::; 10), (5.29)-(5.35) some-
times failed to produce a solution with ~a > 0; this was encountered 
in 28 cases. 
In conclusion, the approximations we examined in this section are 
highly accurate when Cb < 2.0. When the accuracy conditions given 

120 
CHAPTER 5. OPTIMAL POLICIES 
above hold, (Sa, ~ a) is nearly the same as (S*, ~ *). When Cb > 2.0, 
the range of applicability is reduced (Le., LN demand with a > 1.5). 
When Cb is very small and f.Lb is large (Le., IG demand with a ~ 12.0) 
this range is again reduced. 
5.2 
Positive Lead Times 
Computational problems are more serious for L > 0, due to the com-
plicated form of the lead time demand distribution H( L, x). Addi-
tional simplifications are needed to devise algorithms that are usable 
in practice. The most prevalent of these simplifications has been 
the approximation of the lead time demand distribution by a normal 
distribution. Other distributions (gamma, Weibull, etc.) have also 
been proposed in the literature as approximating distributions. Use 
of the normal distribution can be justified on the basis of the central 
limit theorem in situations where L is sufficiently large. However, 
the determination of what constitutes a large enough L must again 
be based on empirical considerations. 
In the literature, substitution of a more tractable distribution for 
the lead time demand distribution is often accompanied by other sim-
plifications involving the measure of effectiveness being used. Most 
of these are ad hoc adjustments achieved by dropping certain terms 
that are deemed insignificant. From an algorithmic point of view 
these types of approximation are often unnecessary as they do not 
really simplify the computational problem. They could also be coun-
terproductive as pointed out in Zipkin (1986). 
In this section, we discuss the computation and validation of ap-
proximations that are based on: 1) the replacement of the renewal 
function (of the underlying demand sequence) by its linear asymptote, 
and 2) the use of the normal distribution for the lead time demand 
distribution as an asymptotic approximation for large L. The first 
represents a continuation of the approach of the previous section; it is 
expected to yield accurate results under similar conditions. Clearly, 

5.2. POSITIVE LEAD TIMES 
121 
this simplification is not required for the unit demands model. The 
second is based on fitting a normal distribution to the asymptotic 
mean and variance of the lead time demand distribution for large L. 
This approach is similar to the one used in Tijms and Groenevelt 
(1984) for the approximation of the reorder point through service 
level constraints. In what follows we develop algorithms for the com-
putation of these asymptotic approximations, based on the first two 
moments of the underlying distribution(s), and identify their accu-
racy conditions. We first discuss the unit demands case. This is 
followed by the general model that includes both the continuous and 
the periodic review modes. 
5.2.1 
Unit Demands 
If we denote by J-Lh and (Th the mean and the standard deviation of the 
stationary distribution of demand during a lead time, we find from 
(3.77-3.78) that: 
J-Lh = L/J-La 
(5.42) 
and 
(5.43) 
Note that the coefficient of variation is: 
(.5.44 ) 
where Ca is the interarrival time coefficient of variation. Clearly, for 
L > J-La, which should normally hold, the lead time demand is rela-
tively less variable than the interarrival time. 
\Ve now approximate the lead time distribution by a normal dis-
tribution with mean (5.42) and standard deviation (5.43). Appealing 
to the optimality conditions (4.41-4.42), which are necessary and suf-
ficient, approximations for optimal policies could then be computed 
through a simple search routine. 

122 
CHAPTER 5. OPTIMAL POLICIES 
Actually, the exact results are not difficult to compute in the unit 
demands case provided that H(L, m) can be expressed in closed form. 
For example, if A(x) is Erlang with parameters ,X and k (cf. p.d.f. 
(2.19)), then the lead time demand c.d.f. is seen to be: 
e->'L (m+l)k-l j ('xL)i 
H(L,m) = -k-
.2: ?= -i!-' 
J=mk 
t=O 
(5.45) 
Computationally, the use of this form in (4.41-4.42) is not much more 
complicated or inefficient than the use of the normal c.dJ. In both 
cases the search routine could be made very efficient. The difficulty 
with the exact computations arises when H(L,m) could be computed 
only by numerical means. For example, if A( x) is one of the distribu-
tions considered in the previous section, the convolutions of A( x) and 
therefore H(L,m) must be computed numerically. There is also the 
additional consideration that the form of the interarrival distribution 
may not be known. The approximations suggested above require only 
its mean and variance. 
Exact and approximate policies are compared in Table 5.6 under 
a set of parameter settings. The exact results represent gamma in-
terarrival times (cf. (5.45)). It is seen that the approximations are 
satisfactory even for L = Ila; and they improve with increasing Lilla' 
5.2.2 
The General Case 
vVe now extend the analysis to continuous review systems under batch 
demand and to periodic review systems. vVe need the additional 
simplification of replacing the renewal function R( x) of the underlying 
demand sequence by its linear asymptote x /Ilb + (cG - 1) /2. It can 
be seen that with this change the cost rate function is unimodal and 
thus the optimality conditions (4.2-4.3) have a unique solution. (Note 
that 1+R(x) = Cb+X/llb (Cb = (1+cl)/2) is concave and therefore 
log-concave so that the main requirement of unimodality that we 
discussed in Chapter 4 is met.)

5.2. POSITIVE LEAD TIMES 
125 
For the purposes of this section, we rewrite the optimality condi-
tions as: 
rS-[s]+ 
H(L,[sJ+)[1 + R(S - [sJ+)J + Jo 
[1 + R(u)Jh(L,S - u)du 
1 + R(~)

( 5.46) 
p[~ + ~~)J _ (-[s]+ [1 + R(u)JH(L,S - u)du = ~h' (5.47) 
p + 
Jo 
P + 
where [s J+ = max ( s, 0). For the renewal function R(.) and its integral 
R(.) we now use the approximations (5.4) and (5.5). In addition, we 
regard H(L,.) as the normal c.dJ. and h(L,.) the normal p.dJ., and 
denote by ILh and a~ the corresponding mean and variance. If <I> ( x) 
and </>( x) denote the standard normal c.dJ. and p.dJ., then it is well 
known that: 
1
00 u¢(u)du = ¢(x), 
(5.48) 
and 
1
00 u2¢(u)du = 1 - <I>(x) + x¢(x). 
(5.49) 
U sing these identities, the integral terms in (5.46) and (5.47) can be 
worked out as: 
rS-[s]+ 
Jo 
[1 + R( u)Jh(L, S - u)du ~

(Cb + S:::h [H(L,S) - H(L,[8J+)J -

The mean and the variance of the stationary distribution of the 
lead time demand are given by (3.47) and (3.48). For L large enough, 
if we approximate R( L) as before, we find the following approxima-
tion for the variance: 
(5.55) 
The coefficient of variation is: 
c2(1 + c2 ) 
Ch ~ Cb 
1 + a L / /-la b • 
(5.56) 
An algorithm for the simultaneous iterative solution of (5.46)-(5.47) 
is tested under a limited range of parameter settings. The exact 
policies for test cases were computed using exponential, gamma and 
mixed-exponential distributions for interarrival times and batch sizes 
(cf. 
~ahin and Kilari, 1984). A comprehensive assessment of the 
accuracy of these approximations is not yet available. However, it 
appears that the accuracy is reasonably good when Ch < 1, but may 
deteriorate very rapidly with increasing Ch for Ch > 1. Note that 
Ch < 1 only if Cb < 1. Some examples are presented in Table 5.7. 
Finally, we note that the approximations described above are also 
applicable to the periodic review system. As before, the only adjust-
ments needed are /-la = 1, O'~ = 0 and L + 1 (integer) instead of L. 
We then have O'h = (L + 1 )O'b and Ch = Cb.

Extensions 
In this chapter, we consider the operating characteristics of three 
extensions of the basic model: (1) systems where an order may arrive 
in two shipments, (2) systems with ordering delays, and (3) systems 
with random lead times. 
6.1 
Two-shipment Order Arrivals 
In some applications, orders may not be received in full in a single 
installment after a given lead time. This could be due to the inabil-
ity or unwillingness of the supplier to fill an order completely with 
one shipment, or to an attempt to improve service by shipping an 
order in two installments. A follow-up shipment may also be used to 
replace the defectives found in the first shipment. Defectives could 
be produced by the manufacturing processes of the supplier, or these 
could be items damaged (or lost) in transit. 
Moinzadeh and Lee (1989) consider a system like the one de-
scribed above under the assumption of unit demands generated by a 
Poisson process. Here we present a generalization of their model to 

130 
CHAPTER 6. EXTENSIONS 
an arbitrary interarrival time distribution, while, retaining the unit-
demands assumption. Specifically, we assume that a random part, 
say 0, of an order of size ~ + 1 is received after a lead time of 
L. (Recall that in the unit demands case our convention is to order 
~ + 1 when the inventory position reaches down to s -
1. ) Let 
e(j), 
j = 0,1, ... , ~ + 1, denote the conditional probability mass 
function of this first installment given that the order size is ~ + 1. 
The balance, ~ + 1-0, is then received after an additional delay of f 
time units. We retain the other assumptions of the basic continuous 
review model, including full backlogging and the notation introduced 
before. 
It should be noted that the inventory position (= on hand, plus 
on order minus backorders) is unaffected by the above complication 
in order deliveries. Order points are still regeneration points of the 
{Ip(t), t 2: O} process; and the marginal distributions of Ip(t) and 
Ip remain to be (3.74) and (3.75). However, the relationship between 
inventory on hand and inventory position is now more complicated. 
Following Moinzadeh and Lee (1989), this relationship can be ex-
pressed as follows. (As before, we denote by D(t, t + u) == N(t, t + u) 
the quantity demanded during (t, t + u], where t is not necessarily an 
arrival point; and write N(u) == N(t,t + u) ift is an arrival point.) 
_ { Ip(t) - D(t,t + L + f) , if Ip(t) - D(t,t + f) 2: s 
I(t+L+f) -
Ip(t) - D(t, t + L + f) 
+V(t,t+f) ,if Ip(t)-D(t,t+f)<s 
(6.1) 
where Vet, t + u) represents the units received through the first ship-
ments of the orders placed during (t, t + u]. This relationship is easily 
verified by noting that if Ip(t) - D(t, t + f) 2: s, so that no order is 
placed during (t,t+f], then the top relationship holds. For any order 
placed before t would have been delivered in full by t + L + f, and 
no part of any order placed after t + f would have been delivered by 
t+ L +f. In the contrary case, there will be one or more orders placed 
during (t, t + fl. And the first shipment of these, but not the second 
shipments, would have arrived by t + L + f. 

6.1. TWO-SHIPMENT ORDER ARRIVALS 
131 
The random variable V(t, t + £) can be expressed as 
M 
V(t,t+f)=L:Oi 
(6.2) 
i=1 
where Oi, 
i = 1,2, ... , M are the i.i.d. first shipments received of 
orders placed during (t, t + £) and M = M(t, t + f) is the number of 
such orders. Since the order size is the same (= 6. + 1) in each order, 
this number is: 
M( 
Ii)_ LS-Jp(t)+D(t,t+£)J 
t, t + -t-
-
6. + 1 
(6.3) 
where Lx J represents the integer part of x. Note that the numerator 
in (6.3) is the total deficit (with respect to S) in inventory position 
during (t, t+£]. The random variables that define J(t) by (6.1) are not 
independent except when the demand process is Poisson; this special 
case is examined in Moinzadeh and Lee (1989). For the general case, 
we need the joint distribution: 
i 
=i(t,u,v;n,k,i) 
= P[N(t) = n, N(t,t + u) = k, N(t + u,t + u + v) = iJ, 
t,u,v ~ 0, n,k,i ~ 0. 
(6.4) 
This is obtained by an obvious extension of Lemma 2.1 as follows.

i =

n ~ 0, k = 0, i = 0, 
(6.5d) 
where ao(x) = ° 
if x> ° 
and ao(O) = 1. 
The joint distributions of Ip(t), D(t, t + f) and D(t + f, t + f + L) 
can now be written down by conditioning on the renewal epochs of 
the process {Ip(t), t ~ O}. For t ~ 0, f ~ 0, L ~ 0, and n, k, i ~ 0, 
we define: 
q(t,f,Ljn,k,i) = P[Ip(t) = n, D(t,t+f) = k, D(t+f,t+f+L) = i] 
(6.6) 
and let 
q(n,k,i) == P[Ip = n, D(f) = k, D(f,f + L) = i] 
= lim q(t, 1, Lj n, k, i). 
t_oo 
(6.7) 
For the time-dependent distribution, we have: 
q(t,f,Ljn,k,i) = ,(t,f,LjS - n,k,i) 
+ lot m(t - u),(u,f,LjS - n,k,i) du 
(6.8) 
where m( u) is the renewal density of inventory cycles defined by 

6.1. TWO-SHIPMENT ORDER ARRIVALS 
133 
(3.72). On passing to the limits, and writing q == q( n, k, i), we obtain: 
q= 
lLa[l+11 L:o[l - A(£ - w)] 
[Ai-l(L - w) - Ai(L - w)] dw,

k ~ 1, i = 0, 
lLa[l+1110
00 [1 - A( u + L + f)] du, 
k = 0, i = 0. 
(6.9) 
Since {fp(t), t ~ O} process is not affected by order splitting, 
the stationary distribution of inventory position remains to be the 
uniform distri bu tion 1/ (1 + ~) over {s, s + 1, ... , S} (cf. Corollary 
3.8). In view of this, (6.9) implies that fp(t) and (D(t, t + f), D(t + 
i, t + i + L)) are asymptotically independent, as anticipated also by 
Corollary 3.5. 
The relationship (6.1) and the joint distributions (6.8) and (6.9) 
can now be used to construct the time dependent and stationary 
distributions of on hand inventory. For the former, we have, for 

134 
CHAPTER 6. EXTENSIONS 
j 5, s: 
P[I(t + L + C) = j] = 
2: P[I(t+L+C) =jllp(t) = n,D(t,t+C) = k,D(t+C,t+C+L) 
n,k,i 
= i]P[Ip(t) = n,D(t,t+C) = k,D(t+£,t +C+ L) = i] 
(6.10) 
In view of (6.1), we can write: 
S 
n-jVs 
P[I(t + L + C) = j] = 2: 2: q(t,C,L;n,k,n - j - k) 
n=jvs k=O 
(6.11) 
S 
00 
i2 
+2: 2: 2: em·(j - n + k + i)q(t,C, L; n, k, i) 
where m* = L(k + S - n)j(!:::.. + l)J, em.(.) is the m*th convolution 
of e(.), il = [n - j - k]+, and i2 = S - j - modfl+1(k + S - n). 
(jVs = max(j,s), [x]+ = max(x,O), LxJ =greatest integer contained 
in x, modx(y)=remainder of y divided by x.) The lower limit on 
i is so that the argument of em .(.) is nonegative. The upper limit 
on i expresses the requirement that the sum of m* first shipments 
cannot contain more than m*(!:::.. + 1) units. That is: j - n + k + i 5, 
L(k + S - n)j(!:::.. + l)J(!:::.. + 1) = k + S - n - modfl+1(k + S - n). 
On passing to the limits in (6.11) and rewriting the second sum of 
the second term in a more convenient form, we find the stationary 
distribution of inventory on hand to be: 
S 
n-jVs 
f(j) = 2: 2: q(n,k,n - j - k) 
n=jvs k=O 
S 
00 
k2 
i2 
(6.12) 
+ 2: 2: 2: 2: em+1(j - n + k + i)q(n,k,i), j 5, S. 
n=s m=O k=kl i=il 
where q(n,k,i) are given by (6.9), kl = n+m(!:::"+l)-s+l, k2 = n+ 
(m+1)(!:::"+1)-jVs, il = [n-j-k]+, and i2 = (m+1)(!:::..+1)+n-j-k. 
As suggested in Moinzadeh and Lee, one possible application of 
the model is to situations where the first shipment is inspected for 
quality, and any defectives found are replaced by the manufacturer

through a second shipment. If the proportion of defective items 
turned out by the manufacturing processes of the supplier is p, then, 
given ~ + 1, the number of items accepted of the first shipment will 
have a binomial distribution with parameters 1-p and ~ + 1. Assum-
ing independence, the total number accepted in m first shipments will 
also have a binomial distribution with parameters 1-p and m(~+1); 
that is: 
em(i) = ( m(~.+ 1) )(1- p)ipm(.:l+1)-i, m ~ 1, 0::; i ::; m(~ + 1).

(6.13) 
with this specification, the model can be used to relate quality control 
to inventory policy. 
6.2 
Ordering Delays 
In this section we consider an extension of the basic model where 
there is a difference between the time an order is indicated (Le. , 
fp( t) < s) and the time the order is actually placed. This difference 
may be significant in some cases due to delays caused by setup times 
for a production process or to non-routine order processing that may 
include vendor selection. More specifically, we will allow for a delay 
of random length before the placement of each order. Such delays 
will be assumed to be mutually independent random variables, with 
common distribution E(x), x ~ 0, that are also independent of the 
demand process. 
Without further assumptions, the complication introduced above 
destroys the simple regenerative structure of the {fp(t), 
t ~ O} 
process. First, since the inventory position may be further depleted 
during an order delay, it may not be restored to S when the order is 
finally placed. In order to avoid this difficulty, we will assume that 
at the time of the placement of an order, its size is adjusted to cover 
any additional inventory depletion during the delay. Thus at the 
time it is placed, an order raises the inventory position to S. Second, 
because of random delays that operate independently of the demand 

136 
CHAPTER 6. EXTENSIONS 
process, points of order placement will not coincide with demand 
points. As a result, each inventory cycle will start with an incomplete 
interval (a forward recurrence time) relative to the demand incidence 
process. In order to get back to a renewal process of cycles, we 
will also assume that the inter arrival time distribution is negative 
exponential; thus A( x) = 1 - e- AX , 
x ~ O. Both assumptions are 
introduced by Weiss (1988) who studied the lost-sales version of the 
model (i.e. , no backlogging) under the additional assumptions of unit 
demands and immediate deliveries following order placements. In this 
section, we allow for backordering, non-zero delivery lead times and 
arbitrarily distributed demand batch sizes. (For convenience, we shall 
retain the notation A(.) for the interarrival time distribution, with the 
understanding that it now represents the exponential distribution.) 
To characterize the inventory position, let Ip(O) = S and define: 
UI = inf{t: Ip(t) < s} 
(6.14) 
and 
(6.15) 
where WI is an order delay time with c.dJ. E(.). Evidently, an order 
is indicated at time UI and placed at time TI where TI is the length of 
the first cycle. In general, let Un be the waiting time until the next 
order-trigger point, measured from an order placement point, and 
Tn = Un + Wn the length of the n - th cycle. Under the assumptions 
made, {Un, 
n = 1,2, ... } and {Tn' 
n = 1,2, ... } are those ofi.i.d. 
random variables. We have 
00 
P[Un ::; tJ = 1 - 2.:)Ak(t) -
Ak+I(t)JBk(~)' 
(6.16) 
k=O 
and 
P[Tn ::; tJ = lot P[Un ::; uJ dE(t - u). 
(6.17) 
It follows that 
(6.18) 

6.2. ORDERING DELAYS 
137 
where Ile = E[Wn], Ila = A-I, and, as before, R(.) is the renewal 
function of the renewal process defined by demand batch sizes. Recall 
also that VLl is the forward recurrence time at time Ll of this renewal 
process. The joint density function, £Ll(X, y), of U1 and VLl is given 
by (2.40). 
Consider now the renewal process {Tn' n = 1,2, ... }. Letm(t), t ~ 
0, denote its renewal density, as characterized by the interval distri-
bution (6.17). It can be seen that 
P[Ip(t) = S] = 1- A(t) + lot m(t - u)[l- A(u)] du, 
(6.19) 
and, the density function of Ip(t) is: 
00 
i:[An(t) - An+1(t)]bn(S - x) 
n=l 
+ E 
bn(S - x) lot m(t - u)[An(u) - An+1(u)]du,

n=O 
l:~x bn(s - x - Z)£Ll( u, z)dz du dy, x < s, 
(6.20) 
where bo(x) = 0 if x > 0 and bo(O) = 1. The expression for x < s 
follows from the observation that, given Un = u and VLl = y, 0 ~ 
u ~ t, 0 ~ Y ~ s - x, for example, we should have a total demand 
of about s - y - x, resu:ting from n ~ 0 withdrawals, and no order 
placement during t - u. The inventory position at time t will then 
be about x < s. Note that for n = 0, the first term of the expression 

138 
CHAPTER 6. EXTENSIONS 
for x < s, for example, reduces to: 
lot £Ll(U,S - x)[l + A(t - u)][l- E(t - u)]du, 
to account for the event: {u < u(n) ~ u+du, s-x < VLl ~ s-x+dx, 
no demand during (0, t - u], no order placement during (0, t - un. 
On passing to the limits, the stationary distribution of the inven-
tory position is obtained as: 
P[Ip = 5] = it;n] 
(6.21)

where VLl(Z), the forward recurrence time density, is given by (2.16), 
and E[Tn] by (6.18). Since A(.) is the exponential distribution, /-La = 
A -1, and the expression for x < s reduces to 
As an example, consider the case of unit demands (Le., a Poison 
demand process) which implies r(.) = 1, and bn(j) = 1 if n = j. 
Further, let P[Wn = 0] = 11" and P[Wn = w] = 1 -
11". 
Thus, a 
proportion, 1 -
11", of orders are delayed by w units of time. Then, 
/-Le = w(l -
11"), and we find:

6.3. RANDOM LEAD TIMES 
139 
Note that, as opposed to the case in section 6.1 of multiple ship-
ments, the ordering delays do not complicate the relationship between 
inventory position and inventory on hand. As for the basic model, 
the two processes are still related by (3.20), and, under the assump-
tion of a compound Poisson demand process, the results of Section 
3.2 could easily be adopted to the present case. In particular, the 
stationary distribution of on hand inventory is given by the density 
function (3.43), with Jp(x) as in (6.23) and 
00 
(AL)k 
h(L, y) = E 
e->'L~bk(Y). 
(6.25) 
(Note that P[I = S] = e->.L P[Ip = S] .) With this modification, the 
analysis could be extended to measures of effectiveness and optimiza-
tion problems. 
6.3 
Random Lead Times 
Lead time unreliability is known to have a critical impact on stocking 
levels and costs (cf. Gross and Soriano 1969). In spite of this, an-
alytical and optimization results are generally lacking for inventory 
systems with random lead times, due to certain modeling difficulties. 
As opposed to the constant lead times case, there is no guarantee that 
all the outstanding orders will arrive in the same sequence as they 
are placed. This rules out any simple relationship between inventory 
position and on hand inventory; and the random lead time case can-
not be treated as a simple generalization of the constant lead time 
model. Put differently, if the lead times are regarded as independent 
random variables (i. e. ,the multi-supplier case) then orders can 
cross; if the orders are not allowed to cross (i.e., the single-supplier 
case) then the lead times cannot be independent. 
Discussion of the continuous review model with random lead times 
goes back to Karlin and Scarf (1958), Scarf (1958), and Galliher, 
Morse and Simond(1959). These earlier studies were based largely on 
analogies to queuing theory and limited to exponential lead times and 

140 
CHAPTER 6. EXTENSIONS 
Poisson demand processes. In later studies that did not rely heavily 
on queuing, the modeling dilemma was circumvented by assumptions. 
Hadley and Within (1963), for example, studied the impact of random 
lead times on a range of continuous and periodic review models under 
the assumption that lead times are independent but that orders do 
not cross. This assumption was also used by Kaplan (1970), Urbach 
(1977), and others. Another way out of the dilemma was suggested 
by Washburn (1973) who assumed that items are not interchangable, 
thus decoupling the orders so that it becomes immaterial whether 
they cross or not. 
In this section, we provide a brief account of the continuous re-
view model under random lead times. We assume that lead times 
are LLd. random variables that are also independent of the demand 
process. The approach we use is a generalization of Finch (1961) 
who provided the earliest exact analysis of the unit demands case 
without artificial assumptions. We confine our attention to the char-
acterization of the time dependent and limiting behavior of on hand 
inventory. We retain the previous notation and conventions with few 
exceptions. We assume that the demand batch sizes are discrete with 
c.dJ. B(j), j = 0,1, ... , and p.dJ. b(j), j = 0,1, .... Also, although 
the control policy is again an (s, S) policy, in view of discrete demand 
batches we now use the convention that an order is placed to raise 
the inventory position to S whenever Ip(t) ~ s (rather than Ip(t) < s, 
as before). The procurement lead time distribution is L(x), x ~ 0. 
Finally, instead of on hand inventory I(t), we focus on the inventory 
deficit S - I(t); we define: 
p(t,j) = P[S - I(t) = j], t ~ 0, j = 0,1, ... , 
(6.26) 
and 
p(j) = lim p(t,j), j = 0,1, .... 
t-oo 
(6.27) 
As before, let D(t) be the total demand during (0, t], immediately 
following a withdrawal; thus: 
00 
h(t,k) == P[D(t) = k] = I)An(t)-An+1(t)]bn(k), t ~ 0, k = 0,1, ... 
(6.28) 

6.3. RANDOM LEAD TIMES 
141 
Time points at which the inventory position is raised to S again form 
a renewal process with interval (cycle) distribution. 
00 
C(x) == P[Tn ~ x] = L 
An(x)[Bn-l(~ -1) -
Bn(~ - 1)], x ~ 0, 
n=l 
(6.29) 
where .6. = S - s ~ 1. It follows that E[Tn] = J1a[l -
R(~ - 1)] 
where R(j) = I:~=1 Bn(j), j = 0,1, ... , is the renewal function of 
the renewal process formed by discrete batch sizes. The joint density 
of V~, the forward recurrence time at time ~, of this renewal process 
and the cycle length Tn is: 
00 
~-1 
f~(x,k)=Laj(x)Lbj-l(i)b(~-i+k), x~o, k=O,l, ... , 
j=l 
i=O 
(6.30) 
which is a version of (2.35) for discrete batch size distribution. Mo-
ments of the forward recurrence time distribution at .6. are given, by 
Lemma 2.2, as: 
00 
~ 
00 
E[vR] = L(j - .6.tb(j) + L 
r(~ - i)[L.:(j - i)b(j) - (-in, 
j=O 
i=l 
j=O 
n = 1,2, .... 
(6.31) 
We denote the n-th binomial moment of the distribution of V~ by 
~(n); we have: 
~(n) = I=( ~ )P[V~ = k] = t uk,nE[vR], n = 1,2, ... , 
(6.32) 
k=n 
k=l 
where Uk,n are the Stirling numbers of the second kind. Similarly, we 
define 
00 
k 
1](n)(x)=L( 
)f~(x,k), x~O, n=1,2, .... 
k=n n 
(6.33) 
Following these preliminaries, we now characterize the distribu-
tion p(t,j), t ~ 0, j = 0,1, ... , of inventory deficit at time t. By 

142 
CHAPTER 6. EXTENSIONS 
conditioning on the first renewal epoch of the renewal process formed 
by inventory cycles, we can see that these probabilities satisfy the 
system of equations: 
p(t,j) = h(t,j) + lot L(t - x)p(t - x,j)dC(x), j = 0, 1, ... ,~ - 1,

00 
II ( t, z) = L zi p( t, j), 
i=O 
and 
00 
A(t, z) = L zi f.D.(t,j), 
j=O 
we obtain from (6.34) and (6.35) that

Explicit results can be obtained for the limiting distribution, if the
