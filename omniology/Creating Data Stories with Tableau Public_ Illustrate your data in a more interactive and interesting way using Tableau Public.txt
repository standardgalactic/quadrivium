About the Author
Ashley Ohmann started her career in technology as a Flash and HTML 
developer at the Emory University School of Medicine while studying Classics as an 
undergraduate at Emory University. After learning how to write SQL to help create 
a fraud detection system for a client, she pursued information management and data 
analytics as a vocation. While working for a multinational manufacturing company, 
she was asked to evaluate Tableau Desktop and Tableau Server; consequently, her 
team became one of the first to implement the suite of tools for their enterprise.
Ashley's career with Tableau's products has included work as a consultant, trainer, 
and a professional services practice director. She is a frequent contributor to the San 
Francisco and Phoenix Tableau User Groups.
A native of Highlands, NC and Atlanta, GA, Ashley is a proud alumna of Rabun 
Gap – Nacoochee School. She also studied German and Chemistry at Mount Holyoke 
College before graduating from Emory. Ashley's roots go back to south Georgia; 
she grew up listening to the stories of her large extended family, which inspired her 
to spend her career helping other people learn how to tell their own stories using a 
variety of media. Currently, she lives in the Pacific Northwest with her family, where 
they enjoy skiing, the beauty of God's great creation, and practicing permaculture on 
their 10 acre farm.

Acknowledgments
There are many amazing people who have encouraged and inspired me on this 
journey with Tableau. My husband and son have sacrificed countless weekends  
so that I could write, and they have been amazingly supportive.
In 2011, my manager, Sandeep Sivadas, asked me to use Gartner's Magic Quadrant 
to evaluate which BI tool would best fit our needs. After many downloads, tests, 
and phone calls with John Jensen, Mike Kravec, and Jeremy Walsh, all from Tableau, 
we selected Tableau Desktop and Server, and with Sandeep's leadership, we truly 
changed our organization with it. (Thank you, Sandeep!).
There are many Tableau User Group leaders who have created and sustained 
communities of users and encouraged me to present and later become a leader. 
Thanks to the crew at ATUG; John and Susana at SFBATUG; Michael at PHXTUG; 
and Lauren Rogers, who has grown the TUG network so phenomenally well and  
sets a high bar for excellence.
None of this would have been possible without the people at Tableau who design 
and create the products—and the partner network—with a constant focus on  
helping other people see and understand their data. Thank you all for executing  
a world-changing vision.
Lastly, thanks to my parents, who encouraged me to start writing 20 years ago  
and always made sure I had the tools and encouragement to let my light shine.

Preface
Tableau Software is on a mission to help people see and understand their data. 
Tableau Public, which is their free tool that allows anyone to publish interactive 
visualizations in the cloud, is a tremendous step toward democratizing data by 
providing tools to data journalists, bloggers, and hobbyists that previously would 
have been available only through corporate IT departments.
When we initially started off this project, our goal was to describe the features of 
Tableau Public so that you can create your own stories with data and then share them 
with the community. We also wanted to provide examples of how members of the 
online community have used Tableau Public to draw attention to important issues of 
our time. In the intervening months, many things have transpired: in addition to the 
important features in Tableau version 9.x, the online community has multiplied in 
size, about 500,000 people a day use Tableau Public, as of this writing, and the Tableau 
Foundation was established. Its mission is to use data to make a tangible difference 
in the world through the involvement of data volunteers and by granting software 
licenses to non-profit organizations that are dedicated to improving public health and 
the lives of underprivileged populations around the world.
Tableau Public is only as good as the people using it, and as we progressed on our 
own journeys with Tableau Public, we became engrossed in the data stories and 
dialogue that people have created and curated, particularly those of the Tableau 
foundation volunteers and others that have the express purpose of using data for 
good. We have attempted to provide guidelines for you on how to craft a compelling, 
rich story with data that enlightens others. Our examples focus on variations of the 
World Bank indicators, and by the end of this book, we have crafted an example 
dashboard that focuses on an issue that impacts everyone.

Getting Started with  
Tableau Public
Making sense of data is a valued service in today's world. It may be a cliché, but 
it's true that we are drowning in data and yet, we are thirsting for knowledge. The 
ability to make sense of data and the skill of using data to tell a compelling story is 
becoming one of the most valued capabilities in almost every field, which includes 
business, journalism, retail, manufacturing, medicine, and public service. Tableau 
Public (for more information, visit www.tableaupublic.com), which is Tableau 
Software's free Cloud-based data visualization client, is a powerfully transformative 
tool that can be used to create rich, interactive, and compelling data stories. It's a 
great platform if you wish to explore data through visualization. It enables your 
consumers to ask and answer questions that are interesting to them.
This book is written for people who are new to Tableau Public and who would 
like to learn how to create rich, interactive data visualizations from publicly 
available data sources that they then can easily share with others. Once you publish 
visualizations and data to Tableau Public, they are accessible to, and can be viewed 
and downloaded by, everyone. A typical Tableau Public data visualization contains 
public data sets such as sports, politics, public works, crime, census, socioeconomic 
metrics, and social media sentiment data. You can also create and use your own data. 
Many of these data sets are either readily available on the Internet, or can be accessed 
via a public records request or search (if they are harder to find, they can be scraped 
from the Internet). You can now control who can download your visualizations and 
data sets, which is a feature that was previously available only to paid subscribers. 
Tableau Public currently has a maximum data set size of 10 million rows and/or 10 
GB of data.

In this chapter, we will walk through an introduction to Tableau, which includes the 
following topics:
•	
A discussion on how you can use Tableau Public to tell your data story
•	
Examples of organizations that use Tableau Public
•	
Downloading and installing the Tableau Public software
•	
Logging in to Tableau Public
•	
Creating your own Tableau Public profile
•	
Discovering the Tableau Public features and resources
•	
Having a look at the author profiles and galleries section of the Tableau 
website so that we can browse other authors' data visualizations (this is a 
great way to learn and gather ideas on how to best present data)
A Tableau Public overview
Tableau Public allows you to tell your data story and create compelling and interactive 
data visualizations that invite discovery and education. Tableau Public is sold at 
a great price—free. It allows you as a data storyteller to create and publish data 
visualizations without learning how to code or having special knowledge about 
web publishing. In fact, you can publish data sets of up to 10 million rows or 10 GB 
to Tableau Public in a single workbook. Tableau Public is a data discovery tool. It 
should not be confused with enterprise-grade business intelligence tools, such as 
Tableau Desktop and Server, QlikView, and Cognos Insight. Those tools integrate with 
corporate networks and security protocols as well as server-based data warehouses. 
Data visualization software is not a new thing. Businesses have used software 
to generate dashboards and reports for decades. The new twist comes with data 
discovery tools, such as Tableau Public. Journalists and bloggers who would like to 
augment their reporting of static text and graphics can use these data discovery tools, 
such as Tableau Public, to create compelling, rich data visualizations, which may 
consist of one or more charts, graphs, tables, and other objects that can be controlled by 
readers to allow for discovery.
The people who are active members of the Tableau Public community have a few 
primary traits in common— they are curious, generous with their knowledge and 
time, and enjoy conversations that relate data to the world around us. Tableau Public 
maintains a list of blogs of data visualization experts who use Tableau Software.
In the following screenshot, Tableau Zen Masters Anya A'hearn of Databrick and 
Allan Walker used data on San Francisco bike sharing to show the financial benefits 
of Bay Area Bike Share, a city-sponsored 30-minute bike sharing program, as well 
as a map of both the proposed expansion of the program and how far a person can 
actually ride a bike in half an hour.

This dashboard is featured in the Tableau Public gallery because it relates data to 
users clearly and concisely. It presents a great public interest story (commuting more 
efficiently in a notoriously congested city) and then grabs the viewer's attention with 
maps of current and future offerings. The second dashboard within the analysis 
is significant, as well. The authors described the Geographic Information Systems 
(GIS), the tools that they used to create innovative maps, as well as the methodology 
that went into the final product so that the users who are new to the tool can learn 
how to create a similar functionality for their own purposes:

As humans, we relate our experiences to each other in stories, and data points are 
an important component of stories. They quantify phenomena and, when combined 
with human actions and emotions, can make them more memorable. When authors 
create public interest story elements with Tableau Public, readers can interact with 
the analysis, which creates a highly personal experience and translates into increased 
participation and decreased abandonment. It's not difficult to embed Tableau Public 
visualizations into websites and blogs. It is as easy as copying and pasting the 
JavaScript that Tableau Public automatically renders for you.
Using Tableau Public increases accessibility to stories too. You can view data stories 
on any mobile device with a web browser and then share it with friends via social 
media sites such as Twitter or Facebook using Tableau Public's sharing functionality. 
Stories can be told with text as well as popular and tried-and-true visualization 
types such as maps, bar charts, lists, heat maps, line charts, and scatterplots. Maps 
are particularly easier to build in Tableau Public than most other data visualization 
offerings because Tableau has integrated geocoding (down to the city and postal 
code) directly into the application. Tableau Public has a built-in date hierarchy 
that makes it easy for users to drill through time dimensions just by clicking on a 
button. One of Tableau Software's taglines, Data to the People, is a reflection not only 
of the ability to distribute analyses sets to thousands of people at once, but also of 
the enhanced abilities of nontechnical users to explore their own data easily and 
derive relevant insights for their own community without having to learn a slew of 
technical skills.
Telling your story with Tableau Public
The Tableau Software was originally imagined in the Stanford University Computer 
Science department, where a research project sponsored by the U.S. Department of 
Defense was launched to study how people can rapidly analyze data. This project 
merged two branches of computer science—the understanding of data relationships 
and computer graphics. This mash-up was discovered to be the best way for people 
to understand and sometimes digest complex data relationships rapidly and, in 
effect, help readers consume data. This project eventually moved from the Stanford 
campus to the corporate world, and Tableau Software was born. The usage and 
adoption of Tableau has since skyrocketed. At the time of writing this book, Tableau 
is the fastest growing software company in the world and now, Tableau competes 
directly with older software manufacturers for data visualization and discovery, 
such as Microsoft, IBM, SAS, Qlik, and Tibco, to name a few.

Tableau Software's flagship program, Tableau Desktop, is a commercial software 
used by many organizations and corporations throughout the world. Tableau Public 
is the free version of Tableau's offering, and it is typically used with nonconfidential 
data either from the public domain or the one that we collected ourselves. This free 
public offering of Tableau Public is truly unique in the business intelligence and data 
discovery industry. There is no other software like it—powerful, free, and open to 
data story authors.
There are a few terms in this book that might be new to you. You, as an 
author, will load your data into a workbook, which will be saved into 
the Tableau Public Cloud.
A visualization is a single graph. It, typically present on a worksheet. 
One or more visualizations can be on a dashboard, which is where 
your users will interact with your data.
One of the wonderful features about Tableau Public is that you can load data and 
visualize it on your own. Traditionally, this has been an activity that was undertaken 
with the help of programmers at work. With Tableau Public and new blogging 
platforms, nonprogrammers can develop data visualization, publish to the Tableau 
Public website, and embed the data visualization on their own website. The basic 
steps to create a Tableau Public visualization are as follows:
•	
Gather your data sources, usually in a spreadsheet or a .csv file
•	
Prepare and format your data to make it usable in Tableau Public
•	
Connect to the data and start building data visualizations (charts, graphs, 
and other objects)
•	
Save and publish the data visualization to the Tableau Public website
•	
Embed your data visualization in your web page by using the code that 
Tableau Public provides
Tableau Public is used by some of the leading news organizations across the world, 
including The New York Times, The Guardian (UK), National Geographic (US), the 
Washington Post (US), the Boston Globe (US), La Informacion (Spain), and Época (Brazil). 
In the following sections, we will discuss installing Tableau Public. Then, we will 
take a look at how we can find some of these visualizations out there in the wild so 
that we can learn from others and create our own original visualizations.

Tableau Public Interface 
Features
The user interface for Tableau Public was created to be simple and intuitive. It comes 
with three primary features (as discussed in Chapter 1, Getting Started with Tableau 
Public), namely connecting to data, opening your work, and discovering Tableau 
Public. Since Tableau Public is a tool for data discovery as well as data visualization, 
the interface is designed to encourage discovery through the drag-and-drop features 
for data. The user interface for Tableau Public is segmented into separate areas, 
namely data elements, cards, shelves, and the canvas. The data is also divided into 
two general categories—dimensions and measures. By understanding how data 
interacts with the user interface, you can design, configure, and polish chart objects 
that will be built into worksheets. These worksheets can then be assembled into one 
or more dashboards.
In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:
•	
The Tableau Public user interface
•	
The side bar, including the Data window and the Analytics pane
•	
The toolbars and menus
•	
The Columns, Rows, and Filters shelves
•	
The Marks card
•	
The Filters and Pages shelves
•	
The ShowMe card

Touring the Tableau Public user interface
•	
In the previous chapter, we discussed how to download and install Tableau 
Public. We also saw what the start screen looks like and how you can use it 
to connect to data, explore your own work or that of others, or discover how 
to use the tool. On opening either a data file or an existing workbook with 
Tableau Public, you will see the worksheet view.
There can be one or more worksheets in a workbook. Tableau Public 
extends this further by allowing you to place one or more worksheets 
in a dashboard, with all of this contained within the workbook.
The starting point that appears when opening a new Tableau workbook is the 
worksheet view. This is the working area where you can build your dashboard.  
Let's take a quick look at it.
The visualization shown in the following screenshot uses data from the Federal 
Aviation Administration (FAA) on every commercial flight at the domestic airports 
of the United States in March 2015 to average the departure delay (in minutes) for 
every weekday. You can download this data from http://www.transtats.bts.
gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=236&DB_Short_Name=On-Time. Also, you 
can download the companion Tableau Public workbook from the profile of this book 
at https://public.tableau.com/profile/tableau.data.stories#!/. We will 
use this workbook to explore parts of the Tableau Public interface, as shown in the 
following screenshot:

The side bar
Our discussion about the parts of the user interface starts with the side bar because it 
contains both the Data window and the Analytics pane. First, we will talk about the 
Data pane. After that, we will discuss the Analytics pane.
The Data pane
The Data pane is where your data sources load. In addition to listing the fields in 
your data source either alphabetically or by folder, the Data pane includes visual 
cues that tell you the type of each field. The following screenshot shows the visual 
cues of the Data pane:

Chapter 2
[ 21 ]
Tableau Public scans the contents of your data source, groups 
fields into Dimensions, and Measures according to their field 
type. Before you start working with your data, you should look 
through the fields in the Dimensions and Measures panes to 
make sure that each field is in the proper place.
The Data pane has the following five different sections:
1.	 The data source name (1): When you load data, you should provide the data 
source with a name that identifies the contents, because that is what you and 
your consumers will see when they download your workbook from Tableau 
Public. Once you have added several data sources, you can condense their 
window in order to save space and then select different sources from the 
drop-down menu.
2.	 The Dimensions pane (2): This includes categorical fields with qualitative 
data. The Dimensions pane typically consists of a string field, a date field, 
and a field that has geographical attributes, as well as unique identifiers, such 
as ID fields.
3.	 The Measures pane (3): This usually includes quantitative fields with 
numerical data that can be aggregated. Tableau Public will automatically 
group numerical fields, except the ones with the ID string in the name as 
measures.
4.	 The Sets pane (4): This includes user-defined, custom fields that interact just 
like dimensions and measures do. Sets pane can also create subsets of data 
that you can use just like dimensions.
5.	 The Parameters pane (5): This includes dynamic placeholders that can 
replace constant values in calculated fields and filters. Parameters are unique 
to a workbook and not a data source. You'll see the parameters available in 
your workbook no matter which data source you are viewing.
From the Data pane, you can can create fields for the Data window, as follows:
1.	 Right-click on the data source to edit it.
2.	 Click on the View Data icon to see a sample of your data set.
3.	 Click on the search icon (the little magnifying glass) to search for fields.
4.	 Click on the arrow that points downwards, which is the Context menu, to 
create calculated fields, parameters, and change the sort/view options for the 
Data window.

Visual cues
Within the Data pane, each field name is displayed, but there is also a visual cue that 
tells you what type of field it is. Field types determine the function and capability of 
joining data sources. In addition to showing the field type, Tableau Public allows you 
to change a field's type by right-clicking on it and selecting the Change Data Type 
option. The following list shows the fields and their descriptions:
•	
The Abc field: This indicates that the field is a string field, which means that 
the contents of the field may include letters, special characters, or numbers
•	
The calendar icon: This indicates a date, datetime, or time field
•	
The # sign: This indicates a numeric field that can have any type of native 
numeric format, from bigint to decimal
•	
The globe icon: This icon indicates that the field has geographic attributes
•	
The paper clip icon: This indicates that the field is a group that you have 
created in Tableau Public
•	
The Venn diagram icon: This indicates a set
The parameters have their own data types, which can 
be established when you create them.
The Analytics pane
The Analytics pane is next to the Data pane. You can access it by clicking on its 
header. It provides you with the ability to add summaries, average lines, constant 
lines, distribution bands, medians, boxplots, forecasts, and other visual analytics to 
your visualization. You can then customize and edit them by using the reference line 
and formatting user interfaces.
The Analytics that you can add are dependent on the data elements in your 
visualization, which include the following:
•	
Summarized Analytics: This includes the following elements:
°°
A constant line: This is an integer on an axis that you can input
°°
An average line: This displays the mean of the measure that you have 
selected either across the table, pane, or cell
°°
Median line with 25% and 75% quartiles: This creates a median 
reference line and a quartile distribution band that you can edit
°°
A box plot
°°
Totals and subtotals

Modeling: This includes the following elements:
°°
Average (or mean) with confidence intervals
°°
Trend lines with the most commonly used models (such as linear, 
exponential, and so on)
°°
Forecast
•	
Custom: With the help of this element, you can add custom reference lines 
and distribution bands as well as box plots, which can also be used by  
right-clicking on an axis
In the following screenshot, we added the average delay in minutes per day to the 
graph as a reference line by performing the following operations:
1.	 Click on Analytics to see the Analytics pane.
2.	 Drag Average Line to the y axis, which is the vertical axis.
3.	 Select Table as the scope, as shown in the following screenshot:
Menus and toolbars
The menus in Tableau Public are arranged and named in a way that is similar  
to those in other modern applications. Their primary uses are shown in the  
following screenshot:

Canvas and Column/Row shelves
Tableau Software has a user interface that is very different from that of the older 
reporting or data analysis tools that you may have used at work or in school. It uses 
a methodology of dragging and dropping objects for most of the functions that you 
need to perform to build a visualization. The areas of the workspace where you place 
objects are called Shelves and Cards. Many of the tasks in this book instruct you to 
drag a field to the Columns or Rows shelf.
The far right side of the screen is called the canvas area. It is where sheet objects, 
such as a chart, are built. The chart area itself starts out blank, and you must drag 
the fields that you want to analyze to an axis, header, or the Columns or Rows shelf, 
which also determines on which axis or header the field appears.

In the following screenshot, we have highlighted the Columns and Rows shelves, the 
canvas, the Marks card, the Filters shelf, and the Pages shelf. This screenshot shows 
how the workspace looks before we add fields to it, and the description is as follows:
•	
The Columns Shelf (1) is where you put fields that you want on the 
horizontal header or the x axis, that is, the axis that goes from left to right. 
The Rows shelf is where you put fields that you want on the y axis.
•	
The Canvas (2) has three places where you can drop fields, namely the x 
axis/header, the y axis/header, and the visualization space itself.
•	
The Marks card (3) includes the controllers that are used to mark color, size, 
text label, and shape. In addition to this, the level of the Detail and Tooltip 
controllers allows you to control the appearance of the visualization. You 
can change the mark type for each individual axis as well as control the size, 
color, label, and shape. (Since the Marks card is critical to the function of the 
visualization, we will describe it in depth in the next section).
•	
The Filters shelf (4) is where you put fields that you want to use to limit the 
values included in your visualization. After dragging a field onto the Filters 
shelf, you can select values in the dialog box of that data element's Filters shelf.

The Pages shelf (5) allows users to progress through your visualization based 
on the fields that you put on it. For instance, you can use a date field on the 
Pages shelf, and your users can click on changes over time without having to 
manually select the subsequent values.
Using the Columns and Rows shelves
As discussed earlier, the fields that you place on the Columns and Rows shelves will 
appear either on the x and y axis, or the row or column headers of the visualization 
respectively. The following are a few new concepts related to the uses of these 
shelves:
•	
Once a field is on the shelf, it is referred to as a pill, or an active field
•	
A pill on a shelf has a context menu
The context menu can be opened by clicking on the 
small arrow that point downwards.
•	
Instances of fields that are discrete will appear in blue, and continuous fields 
will appear in green. The following is a description of both these fields:
°°
Discrete fields have specific values, and the range of values is finite
°°
Continuous fields, on the other hand, have an infinite range of values 
with infinite possibilities
•	
The Information Lab blog does a great job explaining the differences in 
Tableau Public; you can have a look at the explanation by visiting http://
www.theinformationlab.co.uk/2011/09/23/blue-things-and-green-
things/
•	
In case you have multiple pills on a shelf, the discrete pills appear first 
because they are used to group fields, and the continuous pills appear second 
because they are used to measure fields

The following screenshot shows an example of a basic graph that we created:
In order to create the graph shown in the preceding screenshot, we will perform the 
following steps:
1.	 Drag Flight Date to the Columns shelf from the Dimensions pane.
2.	 Choose WEEKDAY as the part of the data that we want to show.
3.	 Add a set that we created that groups airlines by the criteria that  
we established.

4.	 When we drag the Flight Date field and the set to the Columns shelf, they 
both appear in the column headers. Drag the Delay minutes from the 
Measures pane to the Rows shelf.
5.	 When you do this, it defaults to aggregating as a SUM. Click on the Context 
menu of the pill and change the aggregation to Average.
Next, we will discuss how to use the Marks card to add color and labels.
Using the Marks card
Another Tableau invention is the use of cards. Cards are containers for various 
controllers: which are dialogs in the Tableau workspace that allow various data 
elements and components to be configured. The most important card is the Marks 
card, which is in the most current version of Tableau Public. It has combined various 
controllers into one.
The Marks card is a compact yet highly functional area of the worksheet view that 
contains different controllers for data element chart properties (these data points on 
a chart are called marks). To use the Marks card, drag and drop data elements onto 
a corresponding shelf (such as Colors, Label, and Size). This will change the chart 
visualization by changing the chart mark properties.
The different controllers on the Marks card, which are commonly referred to as 
shelves, include the following:
•	
Colors: This changes the colors of marks in the chart (such as bar or line 
colors). In our example, the Set that shows whether an airline is in the top 
five worst airlines according to their average delay time is on the Color shelf.
•	
Size: This configures the sizes of data points or elements in charts.
•	
Label/Text: This adds a label to the chart for data points, bars, groupings, 
or lines. In our example, the percentage difference in average delay time 
between the top five worst airlines and all the others is on the Label shelf.

•	
Details: This adds details to the chart or data points, allowing you to keep 
the main structure of the chart. However, it further categorizes it in detail 
and with more granularity. For example, if we add Unique Carrier to the 
Detail shelf, our visualization will aggregate the average departure time by 
day for each Unique carrier, which means that there is now a bar segment  
for each carrier, and the story that our graph tells will change dramatically, 
as shown in the following screenshot:
•	
Tool Tip: This allows you to add context and calls to action, which are critical 
for telling stories because they instruct users how to progress to the next step 
and they better illustrate how a data point relates to a user's interests.
•	
Shape: This sets the data point shape in the chart visualization.
•	
Path: This is typically used for routes on a map. This controller allows a path 
to be sequentially built and placed on a map visualization. This is commonly 
seen in tornado and hurricane tracking maps visualizations.

Once a field is on a shelf on the Marks card, it shows up under the shelves with  
a small icon for the shelf type followed by the field name, as shown in the following 
screenshot:
You can change the shelf on which a field is placed by clicking on the small icon 
and then selecting the shelf to which you'd like to move the field, as shown in the 
previous screenshot.
The Filters and Pages shelves
The Filters shelf is where you drag fields to limit the data points that your users 
see in your visualization. When you drag it to the Filters shelf, Tableau Public will 
prompt you to filter a field according to its type.
You can also filter a visualization based on the inclusion in a Data set. If you want 
to show the filters to users, you can right-click on the fields in the data window to 
Show Quick Filters as well. We will describe filtering in depth in future chapters.
In the following screenshot, we have added WEEK(Flight Date) to the Pages shelf. 
The controller appears here. We can set the speed at which the visualization changes. 
In the Tableau Public desktop client, the visualization will progress sequentially once 
you click on the Play button. However, online, it will not progress automatically. 
Your user will need to click on the Play button to proceed.

[ 32 ]
Since the functionality is limited online and that is where your users will interact 
with your work, we will condense the discussion of the Page shelf:
The workspace control tabs of Tableau Public
The tabs at the bottom of the Tableau Public screen are either sheet or dashboard 
tabs. The tabs with a series of rows and a column on them are sheet tabs, where you 
can design objects that fit on one sheet. The tabs with a rectangle divided into four 
quadrants are dashboard tabs, where you can add one or more sheets in order to 
form a unified dashboard. When you click on one of the new (blank) worksheet or 
dashboard tabs, that tab opens and names the sheet or dashboard the next sequential 
name, such as Sheet 3 or Dashboard 2. The sheet or dashboard is blank when you 
first open a new tab.

[ 33 ]
A dashboard is really just a group of worksheets on the same page. 
You can assemble a dashboard after creating the various component 
worksheets that it will contain. Dashboards are assembled and 
configured by using the Dashboard tabs in Tableau Public, which are 
available in the lower row of the tabs in the Tableau Public interface.
The lower-right hand side of the Tableau Public interface also contains three 
workspace control tabs, as shown in the following screenshot:
Let's take a look at each of these tabs:
•	
Show Sheet Sorter: This shows the sheets in your workbook and allows you 
to reorder them easily
•	
Show Filmstrip: This shows the visualization with the thumbnails of other 
worksheets, which is shown in the previous screenshot
•	
Show Tabs: This shows the default view of the visualization and the named 
tabs of other worksheets, as shown in the previous screenshot
The Show Me tool
A very useful tool in Tableau Public is the Show Me tool, which is available as a 
floating window when you click on the Show Me button on the upper-right hand 
side of the Tableau Public interface. 
www.it-ebooks.info

This tool, as shown in the following screenshot, is a helpful aid when you wish to 
select various chart types that can be used with your data:
The Show Me tool is an optional tool. Charts can be 
created without any help from this tool.
The Show Me tool also contains a list of tips to add data to shelves and cards, such as 
the number of dimensions and measures necessary to create the desired chart type.
The Show Me tool also suggests graph types based on the view that the user has 
created and/or the fields that the user has selected from the Data window. Based on 
the selections and the chart type selected in Show Me, the tool also instructs the user 
what field types are needed to create a certain graph type.
For example, selecting a continuous date field will make the Show Me tool prompt 
the suggestion of a line graph. Selecting a geocoded or latitude/longitude field will 
make it prompt the selection of a geographic map.

In Chapter 4, Visualization - Tips and Types, we will discuss the Show Me tool in detail 
and have an overview of the chart types that are available in Tableau Public. Many of 
these chart types are covered by the Show Me tool suggestions.
The Show Me tool dialog does not auto-hide once the user makes 
a selection from it. Click on the Show Me button again to hide the 
Show Me tool dialog.
Summary
In this chapter, we learned the Tableau Public user interface, from the welcome screen 
to the worksheet and dashboard tab views. We discussed the concepts of shelves and 
cards, walked through an example of how the Marks card affects a data visualization, 
and had a look at how to create a dashboard from the various worksheets created in a 
Tableau Public workbook. Lastly, we discussed the Show Me tool and how it can aid 
you in choosing appropriate data visualization types for your data.
In the next chapter, we will discuss the various chart types that you can create in 
Tableau Public and what some of the best practices and uses are for the chart types.

Connecting to Data
Visualizations depend on the data in them, and however aesthetically pleasing your 
visualization might be, it may be misleading or even wrong, unless the data has been 
formatted, aggregated, and properly represented.
This chapter discusses the major elements of finding, cleansing, understanding, 
formatting, and aggregating data that you will need to understand in order to produce 
accurate visualizations that tell compelling stories, including the following elements:
•	
Where you can get publicly available data and how to use it
•	
What tables and databases are
•	
The data formats that Tableau Public connects to
•	
Databases, tables, dimensions, facts, and field formats and conventions
•	
Preparing data to load it into Tableau
•	
Connecting to the data from Tableau Public
•	
Using the data interpreter
•	
Pivoting fields
Public data
The data sets that are publicly available or the ones that you have compiled on your 
own, are ideal for Tableau Public. Since all users will be able to download this data 
and create their own visualizations once you have published your workbook, your 
data set should not contain information that may be considered sensitive, which can 
be anything that can be used to identify a private individual or reveal confidential 
corporate information or intellectual property.

Connecting to Data
[ 38 ]
Public data is readily available online. Tableau Public maintains a catalog of publicly 
available data. Much of this data is produced by various governments, economic 
groups, and sports fans, along with a link to, and a rating for each source. This catalog 
is updated monthly, and it is a great introduction to using publicly available data.  
You can find it at http://public.tableau.com/s/resources.
The Google Public Data Explorer has a large collection of public data, including 
economic forecasts and global public health data. This tool is unique because it 
allows users to make simple visualizations from all the original data sources without 
having to investigate the source data, though most of it is available by linking 
available resources.
There are several tools available for the scraping of data from public sites too, such 
as ScraperWiki, import.io, and IFTTT, among others. These industries and such tools 
pertaining to the industry evolve rapidly. Therefore, we will not discuss any specific 
tool. Social media applications, such as Twitter, have made it possible for individuals 
and companies to build application programming interfaces (APIs) to connect to 
their data streams. This is useful for nonprogrammers because it's often free of cost 
if you wish to scrape data about specific topics, hashtags, or users with a minimal 
amount of coding.
Not all data is public data, and it's very important to determine whether a data 
set is public before using it. None of us wants to end up being sued, with a ruined 
reputation, or as a victim. If your source data set has identifying characteristics, first 
and last name, address, and financial, geolocation, medical, or federally or state 
protected data, it should be removed or de-identified and then saved separately 
before saving the visualization to Tableau Public (or not used at all). Each state has 
guidelines on what is considered protected information, and it's a good idea to check 
the restrictions in case there's even the slightest chance that your data set has sensitive 
information in it.
Additionally, data from a corporation should never be used unless the corporation 
has given the permission to use it. (Did we mention lawsuits? Being fired also isn't 
any fun.)
Tables and databases
Once you have found the data set that's ideal for your visualization, it's helpful to 
know how data stores are structured and what the different terms are.
Data is stored in tables. A table is an array of items, and it can be as simple as a 
single word, letter, or number, or as complicated as millions (or more) of rows of 
transactions with timestamps, qualitative attributes (such as size or color), and 
numeric facts, such as the quantity of the purchased goods.

Chapter 3
[ 39 ]
Both a single text file of data and a worksheet in an excel workbook are tables, though 
this may not be apparent. When grouped together in a method that has been designed 
to enable a user to retrieve data from them, they constitute a database. Typically, when 
we think of databases, we think of the Database Management Systems (DBMS) and 
languages that we use to make sense of the data in tables, such as Oracle, Teradata, or 
Microsoft's SQL Server. Currently, the Hadoop and NoSQL platforms are very popular 
because they are comparatively low-cost and can store very large sets of data, but 
Tableau Public does not enable a connection to to these platforms. They are considered 
enterprise tools that should be used with Tableau Desktop Professional. Therefore,  
our discussion about these tools is limited.
Tableau Public is designed in such a way that it allows users in a single data 
connection to join tables of data, which may or may not have been previously related 
to each other, as long as they are in the same format. In other words, multiple CSV 
files or worksheets can be joined in the same excel workbook. Then, users can specify 
the conditions under which they need to retrieve data from the tables and how to 
aggregate it (examples are given in following section). Thus, that data connection 
becomes a de-facto database.
The most common format of publicly available data is in a text file or a  
Character-Separated Values (CSV) file. CSV files are useful because they are  
simple. The rows of data, which may or may not contain a header row, are separated 
by line breaks. The fields within each row can be separated by a character. Typically, 
this character is a comma, pipe, or tab. Commas present difficulties because the 
content of the fields can contain them, which causes the text to shift into a  
new column.
Many public data sources do allow data to be downloaded as Excel documents. The 
World Bank has a comprehensive collection, and we will demonstrate the connective 
capabilities of Tableau Public using one of its data products. Tables can be joined in 
Tableau Public by manually identifying the common field among the tables.
The data sources that Tableau Public 
connects to
Tableau Public connects to four different data sources, namely Access, Excel, text 
file (CSV or TXT), and OData; the first two data sources are bundled with Microsoft 
Office (in most cases), and the second two are freely available to everyone, regardless 
of the operating system that they are using. Text files are the default source of origin 
for most of the data that we will discuss, and anyone can create and distribute them.

Connecting to Data
[ 40 ]
Tableau Public does not connect to enterprise tools such as Teradata, Oracle, or 
Hadoop, and it does not connect to SQL Server Management Studio, though it does 
connect to flat files' output from these tools and other Online Analytical Processing 
(OLAP) systems. SQL Server Management Studio is free for noncommercial use, and 
it's common to use it to design basic star schemas and clean noncommercial data. 
Tableau Public is free because it's assumed that people use it only for their personal 
endeavors and not projects that generate revenue for their employers. If this is not 
the case, they should upgrade to the Tableau Desktop Professional edition.
The databases, tables, dimensions, facts, 
field formats and conventions
Data that is retrieved from different sources will invariably have different structures. 
Some of these data resources need more formatting than others in order to turn them 
into clean, usable tables.
As previously mentioned, a table might be as simple as having a single digit in  
a text file. As long as users know what that digit represents, they can assign a 
qualitative or quantitative value to it. Imagine a situation where you are collecting 
rainfall measurements. Entering the amount of rainfall as subsequent rows of text 
into a new file constitutes a table.
The amount of rainfall is a measure; it is a quantitative fact. A dimension is a field 
that contains qualitative data. In this case, both the time of the day and the location 
of the measurement will be dimensions. Dimensions are typically formatted as date, 
string, or character fields, while measures are formatted as numbers. Text files do 
not have field formats, which are considered metadata, but Microsoft Excel and 
Microsoft Access do contain this information.
It's important to make sure that the formats for fields of the same type 
(the date or the primary/foreign key) are consistent between worksheets 
in a workbook or tables in an Microsoft Access database, because Tableau 
Public automatically joins only the fields with the same format and the 
exact same name (including capitalization). If your field names are not the 
same but they should be joined using join conditions, you can join them 
manually.

Another common dimension is a unique identifier, which assigns a non repetitive 
value to each object in a set. A phone number is a unique identifier as it is related to 
only one phone at a time. The same is the case with a social security number. Within a 
data set, a person's name will be considered a unique identifier if it is not repeated; if 
it were, then a different unique identifier would be used to identify individual people. 
Thus, it's common to use numerical fields as primary keys for individuals, and these 
numerical fields can be used across multiple tables and across different dimensions.
Tables need to be structured so that the field names (dimensions and facts) go across 
and the rows of data (the dimension values and measure facts), go down the table. 
There are some databases that transpose data because their querying engines are 
optimized to search across columns rather than down the rows, but most DMBSes 
are not columnar, and Tableau is not built to search rows.
The following table is a great example of a table that is structured properly. This is 
the 2012 NFL performance data that is freely available:
Each column is a field; the dimensions are Player and Team, and the measures are 
Receptions, Yards, and Average. The primary key is Player. There is only one row 
for each player. Team is the foreign key, as it may be the primary key in other tables, 
such as the aggregations by team.

Conversely, knowing what not to do is as instructive as knowing what to do.  
The following table, which shows the population (in millions) by country,  
is a good example of what not to do:
The problem with this table is that the years, which actually are qualitative 
descriptions of when each population measurement was made, are used as separate 
columns even though the year is a dimension and should run down the page. (Dates 
are dimensions too and not facts, because they describe something qualitative). If we 
loaded this table in Tableau Public, we would see a separate measure field for each 
year because Tableau Public recognizes each column as a distinct field. (In one of the 
following examples, we will use Tableau Public's new data interpreter to structure 
the data source properly).
The correct structure for this table will have three columns, namely [Country], 
[Year], and [Population], with a separate row for each combination of country 
and year.
Connecting to the data in Tableau Public
Tableau Public has a graphical user interface (GUI) that was designed to enable 
users to load data sources without having to write code. Since the only place to save 
Tableau Public documents is in Tableau's Cloud, data sources are automatically 
extracted and packaged with the workbook. (The ability to save extracts as separate 
documents or open extracts and share them with different users is a feature of 
Tableau Desktop Professional).

Connecting to data from a local file, that is, an access, excel, or text file saved on  
your computer, takes several steps that have little variability by data source, which 
will be illustrated as follows with detailed screenshots:
1.	 Click on the Connect to Data Link option from the Data menu.
2.	 Select the data source type.
3.	 Select the file or website to which you want to connect.
4.	 For a Microsoft Access, Microsoft Excel, or a text file, determine whether  
the connection is to one table or multiple tables or it requires a custom  
SQL connection:
°°
If the connection is to one table, select the table.
°°
If the connection is to multiple tables, select the option for the 
connection to multiple tables and identify the join conditions.  
We will discuss this in detail in the next section.
°°
Alternatively, you can type or paste a custom SQL.
5.	 When all the selections have been made, click on Ok.
Now that you have learned what data sources look like and how they are structured, 
we will give you a couple of examples of data connections.
In the first exercise, we will connect to the World Bank's environment indicators.  
You can download this data, which is formatted either for Microsoft Excel or as a  
text file, at www.worldbank.org.
This data source is not formatted properly, which is shown in the following 
screenshot. It has a spacer row between the top of the worksheet and the headers' 
rows, and the years in which the measurements were taken were distributed as 
columns rather than individual dimensional values in a row.
Once we connect to the file, we will use Tableau Public's new data interpreter to 
clean up and pivot the rows:

The data source user interface
Before loading data, it's important to know what the different parts of the data 
connection user interface are. The Tableau Public 9.x user interface that is used for 
the connection to data is shown in the following screenshot. Don't forget that the 
Start button remains in the upper-left corner of the UI. You can click on it from  
either the data source window or a worksheet to get back to the Start menu:
The parts of the user interface and their descriptions are as follows. The parts have

to Tableau Public:
1.	 Open a new instance of Tableau Public.
2.	 From the Connect pane, click on the data file type to which you'd like  
to connect. In this case, we are using an excel file.
3.	 Browse to the file to which you would like to connect.
4.	 Drag a table from the list of tables, which is a list of different worksheets  
in this case, along with the workbook onto the workspace.

below the workspace, but at least with this data set, there is no complete  
set of field headers. We will edit the data source by using the data  
interpreter in the next exercise.
The name of the data source is showing a concatenation of the name of the workbook 
and the table name. Click on it (in the previous screenshot, it's A) to give the data 
source a good name. Remember that anything that you publish on Tableau Public is 
available for other people to download, and since they aren't able to see the actual 
origin of your data source, it's a good idea to give it an explicit name so that there  
are no errors of attribution.

Using the data interpreter
Tableau Public 9.x has a new feature that is designed to reduce the amount of 
transformation that you need to do to your data sources. The data interpreter 
automatically detects where the first row of headers or data is in a Microsoft Excel 
data file, and if there are empty or semi-structured rows before the data, it can 
remove them. (The data interpreter does not work with text files.)
The following data source has the following major errors in it:
•	
There are two rows of mostly blank, non-data values before the first row  
of the valid data; we will use the data interpreter to fix this
•	
The years in which the measurements were taken should be going down a 
column rather than across the columns; we will pivot the data in the next 
exercise to fix this
We will use the data interpreter to fix the first problem. In the following screenshot, 
you will see that Tableau Public has suggested that we use the data interpreter.  
The steps are as follows:
1.	 Under the workspace, note that Tableau Public has recognized that the 
data might not be formatted properly and has suggested using the data 
interpreter. Click on the button that says Turn on:

[ 47 ]
2.	 Now that the data interpreter is on, you can review the results in the 
following screenshot and see how the data was transformed:
The two rows of garbage are now gone, and the field headers are populating 
properly. We still need to resolve the issue of the date dimension going across the 
columns rather than down a column. We can resolve this by pivoting the data.
Pivoting data
Pivoting data is a capability designed to help you resolve issues within data sources, 
like in the previous example, where the date dimension is not formatted properly.
By highlighting the headers, you can pivot them from columns into rows by 
performing the following steps:
1.	 Highlight the field headers that you need to pivot. In this case, we click on 
1960 and scroll all the way to the right, holding down the Shift key as we 
select columns.
2.	 Right-click on a selected header and choose Pivot.
3.	 The pivoted fields now have transformed into two new columns—the 
headers that you selected appear as values in a new column called  
pivot field names, and the measures now appear in a field called  
pivot field values.
4.	 Right-click on the headers for each of these fields and rename them. We 
renamed Pivot field names to Year and Pivot field values to Measure.

5.	 Check out the following modified data source. It is now formatted properly, 
but there is one issue—the numerous rows with null values. We will edit 
those in the next exercise:
Filtering data sources
It's reasonable to expect that you won't need to load all the data in the data source. 
It is important to load only what you need because the more the data in the data 
source, the slower it will be. In the current example that we are using, there are  
many rows with null values. The reason that they have null values is that for the 
selected measure, no measurement was taken for certain time periods.
The null values are different from measurements of zero. Values of 
zero mean that a measurement was taken and the value was zero. 
Null means that no measurement was taken.
We have no reason to load rows with null values. Therefore, we can filter them  
as follows:
1.	 In the upper-right corner under Filters, click on Add.
2.	 Click on Add again.
3.	 Select the field that you wish to filter. (We filtered on Measure).
4.	 Since Measure is a measure and not a dimension, we see a continuous 
spectrum of values. But we want to include everything except null values.
5.	 Click on the Special button on the upper-right side.
6.	 Click on Non-null values.
7.	 Click on OK.
8.	 Click on OK again.
The data source shows values of zero, but not null. The data source is 
almost complete. The only item that is remaining before we can start 
using filter is joining it with another table in the same data source.

Joining tables
In this exercise, we will join the fact table with a dimension of the countries so  
that we can group the countries by region. A join is a logic statement in which you 
tell Tableau's data engine how two tables are related to each other. There are two 
parts to it, the join types (the left join, inner join, right join, or outer join) and the  
join conditions.
•	
The left join: This keeps all the records from the left (or first) table and the 
corresponding records from the right (or second) table.
•	
The inner join: This keeps only the records from both the tables that match 
the join condition.
•	
The right join: It is the opposite of the left join; it keeps all the records from 
the right table and only the corresponding records from the left table. Outer 
joins keep all the fields from all the tables.
The availability of join types depends on your data source. For this 
data source, we can create an inner join or a left join.
A join condition is where you tell Tableau Public's data engine, which is functioning 
as a database management system in this case, how the two tables are related. In 
order to join tables, you need to have at least one field whose contents occur in both 
tables. In the following example, we will join our tables by the country name so that 
we can see the corresponding region for each country.
Tableau Public will automatically join your tables on the first fields 
that occur alphabetically in both the tables and have the exact same 
field name and field type.
In order to add new tables, you need to drag them from the list of tables on the left 
into the workspace next to the existing tables:
1.	 Drag the Country Metadata table into the workspace and drop it next to  
the Environmental Fact Table.
2.	 Tableau Public automatically detects the field that occurs first in both data 
sources alphabetically and has the following properties:
°°
The exact same field name, including capitalization and punctuation
°°
The same field type

3.	 You can view and edit the Join details by clicking on the Venn diagram  
icon between the tables, as shown in the following screenshot. In this case, 
our data sources are joined by Country Code, which is correct. In order to 
select different fields, click on the name of the joined field and replace it  
with someone more appropriate:
4.	 When you are satisfied that the join condition is correct, click on the Venn 
diagram icon again.
The additional fields, with their source table name appended in 
parentheses, are included in the data set below the workspace.
5.	 Just because a field is included in a join condition, it does not mean that  
you need to load it in the workbook. You also do not need duplicates 
of existing fields. For that reason, click on the Country Name (Country 
Metadata) and Country Code (Country Metadata) fields, which already 
occur in the fact table, and from their context menus, select Hide, as  
shown in the following screenshot:
6.	 If you would like to see the fields that you have hidden, click on the checkbox 
next to the Show Hidden Fields text above the data source.

The data source is now ready to be used in a visualization. To create a visualization, 
click on a sheet number or name in the ribbon at the bottom. If you'd like to get back 
to the data source, you can click on the data source icon from any worksheet.
When you load a new data source, the following are some of the several items that 
you should check before you can use it:
•	
Confirm that all the dimensions, are in fact in the Dimensions pane, rather 
than in the Measures pane
•	
Confirm that the data source types of all the fields are correct. For instance,  
in this data source, Year is formatted as a string, but it really should be  
a number
•	
We can change the data type by right-clicking on the field, selecting Change 
Data Type, and choosing Number (Whole)
Connecting to web-based data sources
The steps required to connect to OData are different from the steps required to 
connect to the previously mentioned sources because they involve web servers and 
network security. These steps are a subset of the steps in Desktop Professional that 
are used to connect to a server:
1.	 Enter the URL of the website.
2.	 Select the authentication method.
3.	 Establish the connection.
4.	 Name the data source.

Another big difference between using local sources and online sources is that while 
the local sources can be refreshed with just a right-click on the data source name, 
online sources must connect to the website, which needs to be refreshed.
In order to refresh a web-based data source, perform the following steps:
1.	 Right-click on the data source name in the data pane.
2.	 Click on Edit Connection.
3.	 In the previous dialog box, which will be populated with the connection 
parameters, click on the Connect button in step 3 of the preceding list. It 
isn't necessary to repopulate the connection parameters or create a new 
connection to refresh the data.

source to graph the average CO2 emissions per capita by region since 1980:
Summary
In this chapter, you learned one of the most critical concepts of using Tableau 
Public and producing accurate, informative data visualizations—connecting to, 
transforming, and loading data. The precepts that we discussed, such as making  
sure that your data source is clean and formatted properly, are relevant to working 
with data.
In the next chapter, we will discuss the different types of visualizations that  
you can make with your data and how to use each type correctly and in the  
most compelling manner.

Visualization – Tips  
and Types
A journalist or blogger who uses Tableau Public must convert data to visualizations 
so that readers can quickly understand large quantities of data that have been 
distilled down to a single graphic. The role of an author is data abstraction, the 
conversion of real-life data into visual cues (primitives, as some people who work 
in the field of data science call them), such as colors, shapes, lengths, and positions. 
The role of your reader is to do the reverse, consume data primitives and convert 
them back into real-life things, events, and phenomenon. If you have done a poor job 
choosing the elements of your data visualization, your readers will have a difficult 
time relating your visualization to the real world, which means that the story that 
you're telling isn't as compelling as it should be. Your visualization will not have the 
value that you wanted, because the connection between the data visualization and 
the underlying data has been broken.
Before you create a visualization for people to utilize, there are several considerations 
that go into the design. The following are some of these considerations:
•	
The purpose of the visualization: Which questions should it answer?
•	
Content: What should be included? (Start small, as less is often more).
•	
The visualization structure: What do you actually want to measure or show?
•	
The readers' platform: How have your readers approached your questions 
before? Which tools have they used to do so?
In this chapter, we will discuss the following topics:
•	
The lifecycle of visualization
•	
Iterative design and what it means
•	
Creating visualizations and visual perceptions

An overview of the development lifecycle
Perform the following steps to develop a high-quality, compelling visualization:
•	
The first step is to devise a purpose for the visualization—a question that you 
would like the data to answer—and envision the possible visualization types 
that can best answer that question.
•	
Next, define the content and find your relevant data; determine how much 
data should be shown and the level of details required. A large part of your 
visualization project should be spent on finding and cleansing data. Do not 
skimp on this step, because it will make your visualization more clear and 
useful to readers. You may have to scrape data from the Internet or combine 
it from multiple sources.
•	
Wherever you get your data, make sure that you have both validated and 
attributed it properly.
We surveyed a few experts in Tableau Public, and anecdotally, 
they estimate that they spend 70% to 80% of their total 
development time building data sources.
•	
The third step (with respect to this book) is to try various view chart types 
using the Show Me feature of Tableau Public. Try various view types to 
answer the question, experiment with various views, add or subtract data, 
manipulate components, and explore the question in greater detail or find 
other questions.
•	
The next step in building a visualization is considering the platform—print, 
desktop, laptop, tablet, and smartphone. The medium that your consumers 
use to interact with your visualizations and develop insights is critical.
•	
The last step is publishing your work, or delivering content to your 
visualization consumers. Your data visualization should start a conversation. 
So expect feedback.

Ten visualization tips
Data visualization is an art and a science. Much has been researched, studied, and 
published on the topic of what a great visualization is composed of. In this section, 
let's attempt to clarify some of these findings via some brief explanations, as shown 
in following list. As with everything in life, your mileage may vary, and there are 
always exceptions to rules. However, consider these general rules as condensed, 
combined, and paraphrased here as compared to the industry standards and 
academic research as you develop visualizations:
•	
Readers should be able to understand data visualization quickly. Make 
it easy for your consumer to read your data visualization. Don't use font 
sizes that are less than 10 pt if you can manage it, and use common fonts 
that are designed for ease of use. The key is that visualizations are not too 
flashy, complex, or artistic just for the sake of it. Do not use 3D in any way, 
it distracts and can mislead readers by distorting data. Follow the form over 
function principle, and the amount of time required to understand the data 
will work itself out.
•	
Consider the format for the reader. Print, computer screens, and mobile 
devices use large fonts for titles, and consider the format of consumers' 
devices. Scrolling is not good in most cases, and you should manage white 
space carefully.
•	
Every element should have a reason for being in a virtualization. Choose 
colors carefully. Use colors for categories instead of quantities; don't use 
colors randomly. Shapes, colors, legends, and labels should add to the 
understanding of the visualization.
•	
Be consistent in the placement of objects, elements, and colors. Your work 
is your digital brand, it literally is your product. Your consumers may not 
know you in person. Their perception of you and your skills is determined 
by how they relate to your visualizations. Do not use variety for variety's 
sake. The organization of elements and colors is important, as it helps readers 
navigate through the visualization.
•	
Use the correct context for data and consistent axes for elements on a chart. 
Help readers understand the data and what they are looking at. Do not 
mislead readers by using mismatched axes for charts that compare the same 
measure, nonzero axes, and other misleading tactics.
•	
Simplicity comes from clarity, and this helps readers understand data. Keep 
it simple! Some data sets are inherently complex. In such cases, try to show a 
part of the data set, or break up the visualizations to show the various aspects 
of the data. Be clear in your organization and approach, and simplicity (for 
readers) will follow.

Visualization – Tips and Types
[ 56 ]
•	
Consider calculating differences for readers instead of plotting multiple lines 
or bars in an effort to show the comparisons and differences. For example, a 
line chart of the city budget versus the city expenditures may be interesting, 
but an even better option is to use a bar chart, with a baseline set to the 
budget and bars above or under the baseline. Alternatively, you can set 
reference lines in a chart by using mean or target values.
•	
Choose the best type of view (chart) for the data. Read the following sections 
and understand the key elements of every major chart type and what the 
main objectives of each chart type are.
•	
Understand the different visualization primitives (color, length, area, shapes, 
position, direction, and angle) and how humans perceive them in terms of 
data visualization.
•	
Experiment with the Tableau Public Show Me feature to choose a view type 
and make changes of your own, such as selecting the shelf items that you 
need to include, and their characteristics. Experiment and refine, and think in 
terms of a visualization cycle of exploration rather than a linear route from 
data to visualization creation.
The perception of visual clues
Our brains interpret visual signals in specific, predictable ways, and modern user 
interfaces and consumer products are based on extensive study in this area. The way 
we interact with visual signals was first formally studied and discussed by William 
Cleveland and Robert McGill (at the time, with AT&T Laboratories) in their seminal 
paper named Graphical Perception: Theory, Experimentation, and Application to the 
Development of Graphical Methods, as published in the Journal of the American Statistical 
Association in September 1984. This paper is readily available via a quick Internet 
search, and it is worth a quick read.
In addition to Cleveland and McGill, who were statistical scientists (and later 
professors) focused on researching how we process visual cues, Stephen Few has 
written extensively on this topic in his books and on his blog, which can be viewed 
by visiting http://www.perceptualedge.com/.
The authorities on this matter have concluded that the human brain correctly 
perceives numerical values in a way that is different from how it perceives various 
visual primitives.

WWW.EBOOK777.COM

Chapter 4
[ 57 ]
In the descending order of accuracy, visual primitives are as follows:
•	
Position: This shows how marks relate to an axis, like in a scatter plot.
•	
The bar or line length: This is why line graphs and bar graphs remain the 
first and the most popular forms of data visualization.
•	
Angle: This should be used sparingly, as the human brain actually is not good 
at differentiating angles within a circle. Pie charts are effective if you wish to 
communicate measures as long as about five dimensions are included and the 
slides are labeled with their respective percentages of the whole.
•	
Area: It's actually fairly difficult for us to differentiate numerical values  
from each other based on the size of a shape. Therefore, you should use 
bubble graphs and tree maps sparingly and label them properly when you 
do use them.
•	
Saturation and hue: These are the worst primitives that you can use to 
encode numerical values because not only are a significant number of readers 
color-blind, but also they are used inconsistently and designed for perception 
rather than judging.
•	
Color: This is best used for categorization into groups rather than to measure 
quantity. However, you can use it effectively in heat maps and highlight 
tables, as long as you are using it properly and labeling the values.
Your mileage may vary, but consider the hierarchy of visual clue perception 
carefully. Some conservative data authors will try to stick to scatter plots, line charts, 
and bar charts (and their derivative chart types) almost exclusively and avoid most 
other charts such as pie charts, bubble charts, and heat maps.
Leveraging your understanding of how our brains interpret visual clues will help 
you select the proper chart type. Fortunately, there is a built-in assistant in Tableau 
Public called Show Me that will help you choose a chart type based on the data 
elements (measures and dimensions) that you select.

Using the Show Me tool to create charts
Tableau Public has a great tool embedded into the software called Show Me  
(or the Show Me button). This tool is an expression of Tableau Software's vision  
of self-service analysis because it allows largely nontechnical users to develop  
useful graphs and charts based on their data. The Show Me button is at the top 
right-hand side of the Tableau Public interface. Clicking on this button opens the 
Show Me dialog box (with 24 chart type icons in Tableau Public 9.x), as seen in the 
following screenshot:
The Show Me tool suggests graph types based on the view that the user has created 
and/or the fields that the user has selected from the Data window or the shelf areas.
Only the graph icons that fit the data types available or selected are 
enabled. For example, none of the geographic maps on icon row 
number 2 are enabled, because there is no geographic data in the 
data set used to make this screenshot.
The Show Me tool also tells you which additional field types you need to select in 
order to create a specific visualization, which is a great way to learn.
To use the Show Me tool, select one or more dimensions or measures from the  
Data window and then click on the Show Me button in the upper right of the 
Tableau window to see the suggestions in the Show Me dialog box. The following 
are some examples:

•	
Selecting a continuous date field will prompt the suggestion of a line graph
•	
Selecting a geographical field will prompt the selection of a map
You can't auto-hide the Show Me dialog box once it is displayed and 
the user has made a selection from it. Click on the Show Me button 
again to hide the Show Me dialog box.
In addition to creating new visualizations using the Show Me card, you can modify 
the existing graph. When you select a new graph type from one of the highlighted 
buttons, Tableau Public will change your visualization for you, and by doing so, it 
might remove fields on the visualization that aren't part of the new one.
Show Me contains 24 chart types in Tableau Public 9.x, but many more advanced 
or customized charts can also be created by adding different data elements and 
tweaking the existing chart that you have built. Items that help users better 
understand the data include tool tips, trend lines, color indicators, row separators, 
and reference lines. We will explore these additions in detail later in the chapter.
Answering questions using Show Me 
chart types
Of the many chart types available in the Show Me tool in Tableau Public 9.x, there 
are several common chart types that are frequently used—tables, line charts, bar 
charts, geographic maps, and scatter charts. Pie charts are often used in popular 
culture, particularly in infographics, but you should use them sparingly and always 
label the slices with the percent of the total.
Charts and graphs exist to answer questions, and some charts can naturally answer 
certain types of questions better than other charts.
The following sections discuss in detail some important chart types offered in 
Tableau Public, but this is not a comprehensive list due to limitations pertaining 
to space in this book. In order to help you learn how to construct different 
visualizations, the screenshots in these sections include the placement of  
different fields on the shelves and cards of the workspace.

About dimensions and measures
In Chapter 3, Connecting to Data, we discussed dimensions and measures in detail. 
Let's bring up a few more points so that we understand the chart creation process a 
little better. Tableau Public separates data source into dimensions (qualitative fields) 
and measures (quantitative fields).
When you drag a field onto a worksheet, its new instance is called a pill. The dimensions 
and discrete fields will be blue, while continuous measures will be green pills. Each of 
these pills has a right-click on the shortcut context menu and can have icons on them that 
correspond to the Marks card shelves that they belong, to as well as the set and group 
icons (if they are part of a group or set).
When we use a dimension, Tableau Public creates column or row headers for a 
chart (view). On the contrary, measures typically create an axis in the chart in case 
the measure is classified as continuous, as described in the next section of this 
chapter. Measures can be aggregated (mathematical calculations such as summation, 
averaging, counting, and so on) based on the selected aggregation function (SUM, AVG, 
COUNT, and so on) for each item in the dimension used in the chart.
Tableau Public automatically determines whether a data field is a dimension or a 
measure, but sometimes, the software makes mistakes. For instance, if your data 
source has numeric unique identifiers, such as account numbers, then they will 
be grouped as measures by default, unless the field name contains the ID string. 
In this case, you can change a data element to either a dimension or measure by 
dragging it to the correct pane in the Data window (to the Dimensions pane or 
the Measures pane). It is more likely that you will have to convert measures into 
dimensions (because all numeric values are not measures). To convert a measure 
into a dimension, you can either drag it to the Dimensions pane or right-click on the 
measure and select Convert to Dimension from the shortcut context menu. If this 
conversion is needed for only one chart, you can locally convert the measure on a 
shelf in the same manner (by selecting the Convert to Dimension command from the 
shortcut context menu).
Continuous and discrete dimensions and 
measures
As learned in the previous section, all data elements are classified in Tableau Public 
as either a dimension or a measure. These dimensions and measures are further 
classified into continuous or discrete elements.
www.it-ebooks.info
WWW.EBOOK777.COM

Chapter 4
[ 61 ]
The data elements in the Data window and on the shelves in Tableau Public are 
either light green or light blue in color. The green color indicates that a data element 
is set to continuous, and the blue data elements are set to discrete elements. A green 
or blue outline will also appear when selecting the corresponding continuous or 
discrete data elements. When you are building charts in Tableau Public and adding 
dimensions and measures to the Columns and Rows shelves, the continuous data 
items (usually measures) will create axes, and the discrete elements will create row 
or column headers.
Discrete and continuous designations for data elements affect how graph elements 
are built and marks and axes are rendered. For example, a continuous date 
dimension used in a line chart will create a traditional, unbroken line chart. Using a 
discrete date dimension will create a line chart with segmented panes, that is, lines 
that are broken apart with each change in the date part. For instance, for a graph that 
shows years and months, the lines will break between each year. Using continuous 
measures on the Color shelf will result in a color gradient being used in the chart, 
with the hue or color in proportion corresponding to the value of the measure. If a 
discrete measurement is used on the Color shelf, the color will not be a gradient but 
separate colors (this is generally fine for dimensions on the Color shelf, but not for 
measures). Have a look at the following screenshot to see the difference between 
using a discrete color and a continuous color.
In this example, we're using a continuous measure to color each cell. Note that on 
the Marks card, AVG(Measure) is green. This means that it's continuous. Region, as 
compared to AVG(Measure), is blue because it's a discrete dimension (check out the 
next screenshot):

Visualization – Tips and Types
[ 62 ]
We converted AVG(Measure), which is the average CO2 emissions per capita in 
2010, into a discrete number by clicking on its context menu on the Marks card and 
then selecting Discrete, as shown in following screenshot. This version assigns a 
unique color to every numerical value:
Similarly, if a continuous measure is used on the Size shelf, the sizes of the graph 
marks such as circles, squares, or other shapes, will be in proportion to the value of the 
measure. Discrete measures used in the Size shelf can have a more pronounced size 
variation, but you can experiment with changing the continuous or discrete settings for 
measures and dimensions to better understand their effect on the chart. In my opinion, 
using discrete measures on the Size shelf can sometimes yield good results.
Measures and dimensions can be converted from continuous elements to discrete  
and vice versa. This allows you to experiment and customize the chart view. Quite 
often, you will convert continuous elements to discrete elements, as you will also  
often convert measures to dimensions. You can convert continuous elements to 
discrete ones by right-clicking on the date element and selecting the Convert to 
Discrete menu option. Also, when you move a data element from the Measures pane 
in the Data window to the Dimensions pane, it will typically convert the date element 
from continuous to discrete.

Chapter 4
[ 63 ]
Just like changing data items from measures to dimensions only in one chart, you 
can also change from continuous to discrete for only the desired chart instead of 
making the change globally for all the charts and worksheets in the workbook.
Selecting aggregation types for measures
Measures can be aggregated. These numeric values can be added, counted, and 
averaged, and the median can be chosen. In addition, the aggregation types that are 
available in Tableau Public also include statistical functions such as maximum and 
minimum selection, variance, standard deviation, and percentile. The most common 
aggregation types used in journalism and blogging are sum (addition), average, and 
count. The count aggregation is useful when you have a data source with rows that 
have an ID field, such as the FIPS ID, which is a numerical identifier for a specific 
geographic area, such as a county. To get a count of records, use Count(ID), where 
the ID is the specific ID name in your data source. Extending this example, you can 
also use Count(Distinct) when you only want a count of every unique ID and don't 
want to count the repeating IDs.
Selecting the aggregation type for measures can be done by right-clicking on a 
measure from the context menu, choosing the Measure command, and clicking on 
the desired aggregation type. You can also access aggregations from the drop-down 
menu by clicking on the tiny arrow on the right-hand side of the data element pill. 
The following is a screenshot of the full aggregation menu that is available from a 
measure pill's right-click on the shortcut context menu:

Swapping and sorting
Columns and rows can be swapped (one for another) by using the Swap button in 
the menu bar. Items on shelves can also be moved manually among shelves and to 
and from the Data window. Dimensions and measures can be duplicated by pressing 
Ctrl key and dragging to a new or the same shelf. This is helpful when changing 
aggregations for a duplicate date element or part of the date (such as changing year 
to month).
Similarly, you can sort fields in the following three ways:
•	
Right-click on the field in the Data window, click on Default Properties, and 
select Sort, which sets the default sort order but does not allow you to sort by 
a measure
•	
Click on the context menu of a pill on your visualization and select Sort
•	
Click on the ascending or descending sort buttons in the toolbar, or hover 
over a header and click on the appropriate icon
For instance, in the following screenshot, the countries in each region are sorted in 
the descending order by the CO2 emissions per capita. If you click on the quick sort 
icon that we have highlighted, the countries in each region will be sorted again in an 
alphabetical order. Conversely, when you hover over the x axis and click on the sort 
button, they will be sorted in the ascending order by the measure being used:
Types of visualization
There are many different types of visualization that you can create in Tableau Public, 
and we will focus on several of the most effective ones in detail. There are some that 
you should not use without practice, careful construction, and deliberate labels, such 
as bubble graphs, tree maps, and word clouds. We will not cover those here, since 
they have very limited uses.

Line graphs
Line graphs show data trends over time. Line charts, along with bar charts, are the 
most popular chart types used in data visualizations. For this type of time series 
chart, place a time or date dimension on the Columns shelf and a measure on the 
Rows shelf (the horizontal line chart is the most commonly used/useful line chart).
Line charts can then be modified and made more complex by adding a dimension 
on the Color shelf, which adds one or more additional lines to the chart. You can 
add different measures to the Color shelf as well and measures or dimensions on the 
Size shelf. But usually, adding too much complexity to the graph detracts from the 
understanding of the data. The following steps will help you create a line graph:
1.	 Create a line graph that shows the average military expenditures as a 
percentage of the GDP between 2000 and 2010 by loading the World Bank 
Indicators data.
2.	 Then, drag Date to the Columns shelf from the Dimensions pane.
3.	 Drag Region from the Dimensions pane to the Color shelf.
4.	 Drag Military Expenditures (% GDP) from the Measures pane to the  
Rows shelf.
5.	 Click on the context menu on the pill for Military Expenditures (% GDP) 
and select average the measure, as shown in the following screenshot:

From this line graph, we learned that the Middle East has had the most fluctuation in 
its average military spending over the past 15 years.
Continuous versus discrete date-time elements
This section on line charts is a good place to discuss continuous versus discrete 
date-time elements. Line charts can be set up either with a continuous time series, 
or a discrete time series. Most line charts used for visualizations are continuous and 
unbroken, as the one in this section is. However, time can also be set as discrete, and 
this will break apart the time series into sections (also called panes or panels), such as 
by year, quarter, and month. Dashboards are sometimes developed with a discrete 
time series to allow for a fast comparison of quarters or months. A time-data element 
can be set as discrete or continuous by right-clicking on the date-time data element 
and setting it to continuous or discrete. Doing so will radically change the line chart 
by switching to either a continuous line or a broken line based on the parts of the date 
selected. Most journalists and bloggers who use Tableau Public will want to use the 
continuous feature of date-time data to create unbroken line graphs, but experiment 
with continuous and discrete to check whether it adds value for your readers.
Tables
Tables are usually created to show a fine level of detail for your data. In most 
business organizations, people have traditionally consumed analytics created in 
tabular reports, which can be highly inefficient. Tables display counts or measures 
relative to categorical variables, such as department spending, the number of college 
graduates in a city, pollution levels in a stream, and so on. They are useful when 
you wish to look up individual data point values and compare them across one or 
more levels of dimensional detail. Tables are the most effective when they are used 
at a high level and they contain data summaries rather than very long and detailed 
tables. You should also add filters to table charts to narrow down the data displayed 
to give readers a focus point. Tables are often called crosstabs. Pivot tables are a 
specific type of table; they are not discussed here.
There are three table views in Tableau—text tables (sometimes called crosstabs), 
highlight tables, and heat maps. Any of these three chart types can be selected  
and modified easily from one chart to another, or added to and varied as needed. 
The text table is a good place to start experimenting when building a table.

The tables on the US government's spending were obtained from Tableau 
Software. Download the Tableau Public workbook from Tableau by 
visiting http://tinyurl.com/1962-2012spending and download 
the source data from Tableau Software by visiting http://tinyurl.

Text tables are common tables, as seen in excel, for instance. This type of chart 
is available for creation from the top row of the Show Me tool. The following 
screenshot is an example of a text table. This is a simple table that shows the US 
government's spending as a percentage of the total spending per Department, for 
the US President's administration. For the table, we set the SUM(Percent of Total 
Spending) to the Text shelf, and this exposes the numeric values in the table rows 
and columns.
Note that the details of the spending (the numeric values) are easily seen, and 
there is no highlighting or context around the values (in terms of telling the reader 
whether the numbers are high or low). No shape or color marks are used. Also note 
that we set up various filters on the Filter shelf for this table view, including filters 
for only the top spending departments, and also limited to the last three presidential 
administrations (Clinton, Bush, and Obama). Because the data is only current 
through 2012 (and Obama started his first presidential term in 2009), we also set up 
a filter for Administration Year and filtered to show only years 1 to 4 corresponding 
to each president's 4-year term of office. This lets us compare equal numbers of years 
for each president:

The heat maps are tables that are used to communicate visual cues such as shape and 
area by referring to up to two quantity measures. The larger the shape (and usually, 
the deeper the color), the higher the measure value. This type of chart is available 
for creation from the top row of the Show Me tool. The following graphic is an 
example of a heat map, with the SUM(Spending) on the Color shelf (in this case, 
the darker the red color gradient, the more dollars were spent) and the SUM(% of 
Total Spending) is tied to the Size shelf (this controls the size of the square). In this 
case, the larger the square, the more the percentage of the total spending for each 
government department during successive US presidential administrations. The 
actual values of spending are obscured here so that the reader is not able to quickly 
compare the actual values.
The colors used can be easily customized for each graph by double-clicking on the 
gradient color bar titled SUM(Spending). The shape can be customized by selecting 
another shape in the dropdown list under the Marks title section. Filters that 
were similar to the Text table were set up. But this time, no filtering for presidents 
was created. All the presidents listed in the source data set are represented, from 
Kennedy to Obama, as shown in the following screenshot:

Highlight tables are often thought of as heat maps to the industry, as they use color 
gradient depth, saturation, or hue to highlight a quantity measure (such as highs and 
lows). The difference between a highlight table and a heat map is the lack of shape 
and size marks and the ability to see the underlying details in the highlight table. 
The following screenshot is an example of a highlight table. Note that the darker the 
color hue, the greater the percentage of spending to the total. The SUM(% of Total 
Spending) is duplicated in the Marks card for both the Color shelf and the Text 
shelf. This allows the color hue to be affected in proportion to the numeric value and 
also lets the value itself be shown in the rows and columns.
The colors used, and the other borders and elements, are completely customizable in 
the tables described in this section. The colors of this chart can be easily customized 
for each graph by double-clicking on the gradient color bar titled (in this case) 
SUM(% of Total Spending). The filters that have been created are identical to the 
first table named the Text table in this chapter section:

Bar charts
Bar charts are used to compare values and are perhaps the most useful of the  
chart types. Bar charts allow you to compare values across categorical dimensions 
(such as age groups, sex, race, cities, states, expense categories, departments, and 
so on; the list is endless), but they do not display the underlying data details as can 
be done in a table. Bar charts are used to compare values across dimensions. As we 
discussed in an earlier section in this chapter, length can be easily and naturally 
interpreted by readers. Therefore, bar charts are one of the more commonly used  
and appreciated charts used today.
The global population data used in the following section was 
downloaded from the World Bank by visiting http://data.
worldbank.org/data-catalog/Population-ranking-
table.
There are several types of bar charts in Tableau—horizontal bars, stacked bars  
(they compare parts to a whole and are the same as pie charts), side-by-side bars 
(they compare two categories), Gantt charts, histograms (they measure the frequency 
of events and plot distribution diagrams), and bullet graphs (a relatively new 
compact chart invented by Stephen Few, a visualization expert; you should become 
familiar with his work). In this section, we will only talk about a couple of these bar 
charts, but I invite you to experiment on your own and learn about these other chart 
types if you find them appealing.
The following screenshot shows a horizontal bar chart that depicts the top 10 
countries by population. The chart reveals that China and India are the two largest 
countries by population (with over 1 billion citizens each), followed by the USA, 
Indonesia, and other countries with a much lower population:

Some key design elements that should be pointed out in the previous horizontal  
bar chart are we used Country as the dimension and SUM(Population) as the 
measure. To limit the graph to the top 10 countries in terms of population, we  
added the Country field to the Filters shelf and chose to filter the top 10 countries  
by population in the descending order, as shown in the following screenshot:
After filtering the data to get information about the top 10 countries in the year 
2010, we sorted the bars by clicking on the quick-sort button on the x axis to sort the 
countries in descending order by total population.

The chart shown in the following screenshot is a stacked bar chart. In this chart, 
we have pivoted several fields in the previous two exercises to show, by region, the 
10 most populous countries in the world. The stacked bar chart is a part-to-whole 
comparison chart that often works better than a pie chart because it relies on the 
bar's lengths rather than an interpretation of the angles:
Stacked bar charts are best used when there are just a few different dimensions, 
because too many dimensions and corresponding colors are difficult to interpret.  
We created this stacked bar chart by performing the following steps:
1.	 Drag the Region field from the Dimensions pane to the Columns shelf.
2.	 Drag Population: Total(count) from the Measures pane to the Rows shelf.
3.	 Maintain the filters on Year for 2010 and the top 10 countries according to the 
total population.
4.	 Drag Country from the Dimensions pane to the Color shelf.
5.	 Click on the Color shelf on the Marks card and add a black border,  
which separates the bars more definitively.
6.	 Clicked on the ABC icon in the toolbar to see the mark labels.

Geographic maps
Geographic maps are a useful chart type that can answer various questions related to 
locations. Before you select this chart type, consider the fact that having geographic 
data elements such as longitude, latitude, state, county, city names, or addresses 
does not mean that you have to use them in every case. Sometimes, a bar chart or 
another chart type can express a data story as well as a geographic map in, case map 
data does not actually add value. For example, sometimes it is better to group states, 
counties, or cities into regions and treat those as categories by using bar charts.
Tableau Public has a powerful geocoding function that is built-in and requires 
no additional programming (though many third-party providers exist for more 
robust maps with street and topographic map support). Geocoding is the process of 
recognizing geographic data, such as addresses, cities, counties, state country names, 
latitude, longitude, and so on, with the help of software and automatically encoding 
text strings and numeric values as geographic dimensions.
We built the following map to show the maximum life expectancy by country in the 
World Bank Indicators data set by performing the following steps:
1.	 Multi-select Country in the Dimensions pane and Life Expectancy at Birth 
(total) in the Measures pane.
2.	 Click on the Show Me card.
3.	 Select the filled map.
4.	 On the Marks card, click on the context menu for Life Expectancy at 
Birth (Total) and change it to a maximum, which means that it shows the 
maximum value for each country within the data set.

5.	 Click on the context menu for the Color Legend, click on Edit, and select 
a color palette that's friendly to people who are color-blind, as shown in 
following screenshot:
From this map, we learned that the countries of central Africa have relatively worst 
life expectancies in the world.
When the data is loaded in Tableau Public, the software automatically encodes 
geographic fields with their average latitude and longitude. When you select one 
of these newly encoded fields, a small globe icon will be associated with the data 
element. You can click on one of the map icons on the Show Me dialog box, or you 
can double-click on any of those fields to add it to the visualization pane. The filled 
map icon is the most commonly used one for data visualizations.
Scatter plots
Scatter plots are a type of chart that show relationships between two measures to 
establish correlations and comparisons, find trends in data, and expose outliers. 
Scatter plots are one of the most effective forms of communicating mathematical 
relationships, and they are one of the seven basic tools of quality control.
www.it-ebooks.info
WWW.EBOOK777.COM

free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 4
[ 75 ]
You can build a scatter plot by adding a measure to the Rows shelf and a measure to 
the Columns shelf, or double-clicking on each of the measures in succession—the first 
measure will be placed on the Rows shelf and the second one on the Columns shelf. 
You can swap the measures (rows swapped with columns) by pressing the Ctrl key 
and clicking on the measures and select the Swap menu command icon. Alternatively, 
you can right-click and click on Swap on the shortcut context menu. Then, add one 
or more dimensions to the Marks card, dragging various dimensions to the various 
shelves, such as Color, Size, or Shape. This will put the scattered measures in context 
with the dimensions and allow for an analysis of the relationships.
Aggregation of the measures plays an important role here. The default behavior of 
Tableau Public is to aggregate measures (for example. by using sums or averages). 
This may be fine for most analyses, but you may want a clearer picture (or you may 
want to expose outliers) by looking at all the data points. You can override this 
aggregation behavior by disaggregating the data, which will display all the values in 
the data source for that measure. To do so, go to the Start button and select Analysis. 
Then, click on Aggregate Measures and deselect that menu command. Note that 
disaggregation may remove the information displayed from the tool tip when 
hovering over a data point. You can add the contextual values displayed in the tool 
tip by dragging dimensions and measures from the Data window to the Detail or 
Tooltip shelves in the Marks card.
If too many values are displayed, you can add the measures to the Filters shelf and 
set parameters in the filter dialog box to limit the number of data points (marks) that 
are being shown.
We created the scatter plot shown in the following screenshot, which shows the 
relationship of GDP and mobile phone users between 2000 and 2010 in Asia by 
country from the World Bank Indicators data, by performing the following steps:
1.	 Drag Finance: GDP (current. USD) to the Columns shelf, which puts it on 
the x axis and makes it the independent variable.
2.	 Drag Business: Mobile Phone Subscribers from the Measures pane to the 
Columns shelf, which makes it the dependent variable.
3.	 Drag Date from the Dimensions pane to the Color shelf.
4.	 Click on the context menu for the Color legend and assign the Cyclic  
color palette.
5.	 Drag Region to the Filters shelf and select Asia.
6.	 Drag Country to the Label shelf.
7.	 Drag Population: Urban (count) to the Size shelf on the Marks card, which 
further encodes the default circles with the relative urban populations.

[ 76 ]
From this, we learned that the relationship between the GDP and Mobile phone 
subscribers in China is linear and that in other countries such as Japan, it is relatively 
consistent. It is also not surprising that the urban population of China is the largest, 
since it has the largest population. In the next chapter, you will learn how to create 
calculated fields that show you the percentage of the total that is urban rather than 
just a discrete number.
Pie charts
Pie charts allow you to show the composition of parts to a whole, like slices in a pie. 
Pie charts should be used sparingly because humans cannot interpret angles and 
area that well. Noted visualization experts, including Stephen Few and Edward Tufte, 
are generally against using pie charts, except in limited circumstances. It is often said 
for data, authors consider using a stacked bar chart instead.
That being said, pie charts can sometimes be used effectively under certain 
circumstances. Limit the number of slices to 5 (at the most), and make sure that the 
slices are not too small and are visible. You can use pie charts effectively to give a 
general sense of how one dimension compares to another, but don't use it to report 
measures that are close in value. It is too difficult for people to interpret when 
the measures (the pie slices) are of similar sizes. Tableau Public, unlike other data 
visualization software packages, does not support 3D pie charts and drill-downs into 
pie slices. This is a good thing because these characteristics lead to confusing and 
misleading pie charts.

2.	 Drag Region to the Color shelf.
3.	 Click on the context menu on the Color shelf to change the color palette

6.	 Drag both Region and Business: Mobile Phone Subscribers to the Label 
shelf on the Marks card.
7.	 Click on the context menu for Business: Mobile Phone Subscribers on the 
Label shelf of the Marks card, select Quick Table Calculation, and choose 
Percent of Total.
8.	 Filter Date by setting it to 2010.

This pie chart shows that half of the mobile phone users in the world are in Asia. 
The pie chart is easy to use, and it does not mislead users. It provides them with the 
context that they need to sort through the information points quickly.
Using groups and sets
It can be useful to group dimension members into groups to report on these groups, 
as compared to others. For example, in the Life Expectancy Map that we built earlier, 
it might be helpful to add Canada, USA, and Mexico into a group or set named 
North American Countries.
A group is a simple set that is composed of the dimension members that you choose. 
In the following example, we set up the North American group by performing the 
following steps:
1.	 Right-click on the Country field in the Dimensions pane.
2.	 Select Create and then choose Group from the context menu.
3.	 Give the group a name.
4.	 Manually select the three countries that we want to put into the group.
5.	 Click on the Group button and then name the group.
6.	 Click on OK.
Note that the group field appears at the bottom of the Dimensions pane. It is 
considered to be metadata. It exists in the Tableau Public workbook, but it does not 
appear in your original data source.

In the following example, we added the group to the Color shelf on the Marks card 
of the map. Countries are colored by their membership in the group. Either they are 
in, or they are out, as shown in the following screenshot:
Similarly, we can create a set that groups members of a dimension by their adherence 
to the criteria that you establish.
We can create a set that identifies the top 25 countries by life expectancy, which will 
be used again to modify the map, from the World Bank indicators data source by 
performing the following steps:
1.	 Right-click on the Country field in the Dimensions pane.
2.	 Click on Create and then select Set.
3.	 Rename the Set to Country Set.
4.	 Click on the Condition tab rather than manually selecting the members  
of the Set so that it will be updated if and when we get new data.

5.	 Create a condition that includes the top 25 countries by Health: Life 
Expectancy at Birth (total years).
6.	 Click on OK, as shown in the following screenshot:

top of the field on the Color shelf on the Marks card, thus replacing it. Countries that 
are in the top 25 countries filtered according to life expectancy are colored blue, and 
all the others are gray, as shown in the following screenshot:

Summary
In this chapter, we discussed the processes that are the best if you want to design 
charts, from understanding the requirements, to data discovery, through to an 
iterative discovery cycle. We discussed the best practices in chart design and data 
visualization, reviewed the chart types that best answer which types of questions, 
and explored data dimensions and measures. We also discussed the different 
impacts that discrete and continuous data elements have on visualizations.  
Lastly, we talked about the use of reference and trend lines in views.
In the next chapter, we will talk about how to create calculated fields and table 
calculations.

Calculations
The data sources that you query to tell stories do not always have all the data points 
that you need. If they did, someone else would have told the story already. Tableau 
Public's data engine allows you to create new mathematical calculations of varying 
complexity, from basic multiplication functions to sophisticated aggregations with 
specific levels of detail that add color, context, and key insights to your data stories.
In this chapter, we will discuss how to develop new insights for users by 
understanding and implementing different types of calculated fields. We will use 
several data sources that we have connected to previously, in order to help you 
understand the following functions:
•	
Creating and editing calculated fields
•	
Types of calculations
•	
Number functions
•	
String functions
•	
Date functions
•	
Type conversions
•	
Aggregate functions
•	
Logic functions
•	
Blending data sources
Throughout this chapter, we will present and discuss error messages that you are 
likely to encounter. We cannot emphasize enough that, especially when presenting 
information to others using a tool that might be new to them, substance is more 
important than style. Also, it's very difficult to rebuild credibility once it's  
been compromised.
The next chapter focuses on Level of Detail calculations and table calculations. They 
both are big topics that build on the capabilities that you will learn in this chapter.

In this chapter, we will use a data set of major global floods since 1985,  
which was found on Tableau Public's resources page. The original source is  
at http://floodobservatory.colorado.edu/Archives/index.html.
Creating calculated fields
A calculated field that you create exists only in your data source in Tableau Public; it 
does not exist in the file that you originally queried, which is the reason behind why 
you are creating it in the first place. In the following examples, we will be creating 
calculated fields in a data set of floods. The fields that we create will show up in the 
Dimensions or Measures pane in the Data window in Tableau Public depending on 
their type of field, with the equals sign (=) next to them.
In Tableau Public, there are several ways to create a calculated field. The following 
steps will guide you:
1.	 From the Analysis menu, select Create Calculated Field.
2.	 Click on the Context menu of the data source and then select Create 
Calculated Field.
3.	 Right-click on a field in the Dimensions or Measure pane of a data source. 
Select Create and then choose Calculated Field.
Tableau Public has a new calculated field dialog box in version 9.x, which is a 
significant improvement over the previous versions. When it's open, you can 
perform functions on your visualization, and if you want to add fields to a 
calculation, you can drag them into the dialog box from the Data window.
You also can resize the dialog box and show or hide the list of functions.
The following screenshot shows the dialog box along with descriptions of each fields:

List of function types, which can be used to filter the list of functions. 
The options, which will be explored in detail later in this chapter, are 
as follows:

•	
Type Conversion
•	
Logical
•	
Aggregate
•

•	
Filter box (here, you can type in the name of the function type 
that you would like to see)
•	
Information box (5): Here, you can see the name of the function, what it 
does, and an example.
•	
Button (6): This can be used to hide the function list.
•	
The Apply and OK buttons (7): These buttons apply changes that you have 
made to the visualization and then close the window respectively.
•	
Messages (8): This tells you when your calculation is valid, when there are 
errors, and what the error is.
•	
The calculation itself (9): Tableau Public 9.x is intelligent. When you start 
typing in a field name, it will suggest all the fields that include the string that 
you are typing. You can hit the Tab key or click on its suggestion to populate 
the field. Alternatively, you can drag fields from the Dimensions and 
Measures pane, of both your current data source and others data sources  
that you have loaded into your workbook, to create new fields.

The parts of the formula include fields, mathematical operators, functions, and often 
parameters as shown in the following screenshot:
Editing calculated fields
Once you have created a calculated field that is valid, you can edit it by right-clicking 
on it in the window in which it appears and then selecting Edit. You can also rename 
calculated fields (as well as fields native to your data source) by right-clicking on 
them and selecting Rename.
Types of calculations
There are several types of calculations that you can create, as listed previously. 
Some of them are common to other data management tools, but some, such as user 
calculations, are unique to Tableau Public.
When creating calculated fields, the functions that you can apply on a field depends 
on the type of that field. For instance, you can't perform multiplication functions on a 
string field (even if it contains only numbers) without first converting it to a numeric 
field. Similarly, you can't concatenate numeric values without first converting them 
to strings.
Basic mathematical functions, such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), 
division (/), and exponents (^), are created by typing the standard operators into the 
dialog box.
You can add functions by typing their names or filtering the list of functions to 
the appropriate group, or name, and then double-clicking on the best choice. The 
different types of functions that you can perform in Tableau Public are as follows:
•	
Number: This includes geometric, trigonometric, and rounding functions, 
among others
•	
Strings: This includes options to find characters, measure string length, split 
and parse fields, and match character strings

Chapter 5
[ 87 ]
•	
Date: This includes functions for duration, the addition and subtraction of 
dates, the truncation of dates, and the identification of date parts
•	
Type conversion: This allows you to convert fields into different types 
without modifying the metadata of the source field
•	
Logical: This includes the powerful IF, CASE, and ISNULL and allows you  
to tell Tableau Public how to group fields or relate them to parameters
•	
Aggregate calculations: These are the most commonly used functions;  
they include sum, count, avg, min, max, and median
•	
User functions: These are more commonly used for Tableau Server rather 
than Tableau Public; they allow you to create calculated fields that operate  
on usernames or groups

Table calculation: This will be detailed in the next chapter; it allows you  
to compute aggregations based on data points that are visible in the  
current window
The number functions
Number functions include several functions that you may be familiar with owing 
to working with applications such as ROUND and ABS. Many of us may not have 
used several of these functions, such as the trigonometric and exponential functions, 
since our high school math class. There are some number functions that we will use 
extensively, such as MIN and MAX, while there are others that have limited uses, 
such as the geometric and trigonometric functions.
Number functions include the following, in order of decreasing precedence:
•	
ABS: This takes the absolute value of a number. It is commonly found in  
the denominator of table calculations.
•	
CEILING: This rounds up a decimal to its nearest integer and is the  
opposite of INT.
•	
FLOOR: This rounds a decimal down to its nearest integer.
•	
MAX and MIN: These take the maximum and minimum values in a 
sequence respectively. They are also considered to be string functions.
•	
ROUND: This allows you to specify how many decimals to round up  
a float number to.
•	
ZN: This is predominantly found in table calculations. It tells Tableau Public 
that if a numeric field has a NULL value, you want to replace it with zero.
•	
DIV: This produces the whole number product of a division statement.
•	
PI: This produces the numeric value of pi.

•	
SIGN: This produces a numeric value (1, 0, or 01) based on the input, which 
may be positive, zero, or negative respectively.
•	
Trigonometric and geometric functions: These are largely beyond the 
scope of this book. These functions include ACOS, ASIN, ATAN, ATAN2, 
COS, COT, DEGREES, RADIANS, SIN, and TAN as well as HEXBINX and 
HEXBINY.
•	
Exponential and logarithmic functions: These functions include EXP, LN, 
LOG, POWER, SQRT, and SQUARE.
The date functions
The date functions are useful for a variety of tasks, such as identifying the elapsed 
time between two events or a part of a date.
Many date functions in Tableau Public operate on dateparts. Dateparts are the  
small units of measurement of dates, such as a year, quarter, month, week, day, and 
the units of time, such as an hour, a minute, and a second. Writing date functions 
in Tableau Public is similar to writing date functions in ANSI SQL or Microsoft 
Excel with a big difference—dateparts need to be spelled out and enclosed in single 
quotation marks, which is a relatively simple design and use of punctuation for a 
programming language.
The most commonly performed analysis is the measurement of change over time, 
and the prevalence of date functions is high. Therefore, it is worth the time and  
effort to master them early on in your work with Tableau Public.
The date functions include the following functions:
•	
DATEADD: This adds numeric values, which can be hard-coded or variable,  
in a specific number of dateparts to a date.
•	
DATEDIFF: This calculates the elapsed number of specified dateparts 
between two dates.
•	
DATENAME: This produces the name of the specified datepart of a date. 
An example that demonstrates the implementation of this function is, 
DATENAME('month', #7/21/2015#) = "July".
•	
DATEPARSE: This turns a string into a date in the format that you specify.

[ 89 ]
•	
DATEPART: This is similar to DATENAME. It returns the datepart of a 
specified date but returns a numeric value. An example that demonstrates the 
implementation of this function is, DATEPART('month', #7/21/2015#) = 7.
•	
DATETRUNC: This rounds up a date to the first date of the datepart that 
you specify. An example that demonstrates how to implement this function 
is, DATETRUNC('month, #7/21/2015#) = '7/1/2015'.
•	
DAY: This returns the day of the month of a given date. An example that 
demonstrates how to implement this function is, DAY(#7/21/2015#) = 21.
•	
ISDATE: This tests whether a string that you enter is actually a date and 
produces a Boolean value (true or false).
•	
MONTH: This produces the numerical month of a date.
•	
TODAY and NOW: These produce the date and datetime of the current 
moment by using the time settings on your computer.
•	
YEAR: This produces the year of the current date.
In the following example, we will use the floods data to determine the number of  
years that have elapsed since the last major flood. Most of the countries have had  
many floods and not just one. Therefore, we used the maximum value of Date Began, 
which is the most recent date in the data set, and compared it with today's date.
We could have omitted the max from the Date Began, but for each country, Tableau 
Public would have then aggregated the elapsed time per country, and we really 
wanted to know how long it has been since the most recent flood, as shown in  
the following screenshot:

Type conversions
We will begin with type conversions because you cannot create properly  
functioning calculated fields without having the fields in the right format. For 
instance, aggregations work on numeric fields, string functions work on strings,  
and date functions work on dates. Tableau Public automatically identifies the type  
of field based on its contents, but this may not meet your needs to aggregate or  
create calculations. Publicly available data sources, such as the ones available at 
http://public.tableau.com/s/resources, often have issues with either the 
format or the quality of the data. This will make it necessary for you to convert fields 
into different types, and it is quite likely that you will need to strip bad data and  
identify replacement values as well.
If you are familiar with relational database management, you are probably aware 
that there are many different field types, some of which are used to govern the field 
length within a database. Tableau Public focuses on the three primary field types, 
namely; string, which can be anything; numeric fields, which include integers and 
float fields; and datetime fields; which include the DATETIME, DATE, and TIME 
field formats.
You can convert a field to another type by creating a calculated field and wrapping 
it in the appropriate function. In case fields are of the same parent form or are 
interchangeable, you can right-click on the field name, select Change Data Type,  
and then choose the appropriate type. If you do need to change the format manually, 
you can use the following functions:
•	
DATE: This converts the strings that you specify (whether you enter them 
yourself or they are predefined) into date fields, which can then be used to 
drill through hierarchies.
•	
DATETIME: This converts a field or string into a datetime field, which is a 
date plus a timestamp.
•	
FLOAT: This converts integers into decimal numbers. This function works 
only on numeric formats.
•	
INT: This takes the whole number of a numeric expression by rounding  
up to the nearest whole number.
•	
MAKEDATE: This formats an entry for a year, month, and day into the 
MM/DD/YYYY format as a proper date. It also accepts fields for the 
datepart variables.

Chapter 5
[ 91 ]
•	
MAKEDATETIME and MAKETIME: These functions accept proper 
dateparts, just like MAKEDATE, to convert variable or hard-coded  
sequences into the appropriate field types.
•	
STR: This turns a sequence of characters, numbers, letters, or special 
characters into strings.
The string functions
The string fields are often the richest in data source as they include other fields 
with free text, but they can also have the lowest data quality. The string functions 
in Tableau Public empower you to perform splice, trim, find, replace, match, 
reformat, and concatenate functions.
We will use several of these functions to clean up the floods data source, which  
was assembled manually and has several data quality issues.
The following are some of the most useful functions that we will use:
•	
CONTAINS: This has a Boolean output. It tests whether a field contains  
the specified string.
•	
FIND: This finds the place where a string of characters is located within  
a field.
•	
LEFT, MID, and RIGHT: These often work in conjunction with FIND and 
LEN when extracting fixed or variable strings of characters from a field.
•	
LEN: This produces the length of a field.
•	
MIN and MAX: These are commonly used on numeric fields. They produce 
the numerically minimum or maximum values in sequences respectively.
•	
The REGEX expressions: These features were introduced in Tableau Public 
9.0. They extract, match, and replace variable strings within fields and are 
similar to the LIKE function in ANSI SQL.
•	
REPLACE: This replaces a sequence with a specified value.
•	
TRIM, LTRIM, and RTRIM: These trim leading or lagging spaces from  
a string.
•	
UPPER and LOWER: These are commonly used to normalize the contents  
of a field.

The Tableau Public does not have the PROPER function that both 
ANSI SQL and Microsoft Excel use to impose proper capitalization 
on inconsistently capitalized fields.
In the next few examples, as shown in the following screenshot, we will use the 
TRIM and REGEX functions to repair the quality of the most varied misspellings  
of several countries. It looks like many of the values in the Country Name source 
field have spaces on either side of the primary value, which is not great and it's 
something that we need to fix:
This is helpful. We now have fewer unique entries for country names than before, 
but bad characters are still present in the data-set.
There are two options for the replacement of characters in a string, namely  
REPLACE and REGEXP_REPLACE:
•	
REPLACE: This requires you to enter the string to be searched, the exact 
pattern to be replaced, and the replacement value. The advantage of using 
REPLACE is that it is easy to learn and execute. The disadvantage is that 
Tableau Public can search and replace only one string at a time.
•	
REGEXP_REPLACE: This is a robust function, and while it takes practice 
to master it, this is widely used in different programming languages. It is a 
type of regular expression. Among the technical users of Tableau Public, the 
introduction of regular expressions in 9.x was highly anticipated because the 
search pattern allows a high degree of variability. You can enter a specific 
letter, number, or special character as the pattern that you need to search,  
or you can tell Tableau Public to find letters, numbers, or a variety of special 
characters. You can also ask Tableau Public to find a combination of these.
www.it-ebooks.info
WWW.EBOOK777.COM

Chapter 5
[ 93 ]
Regular expressions are efficient, and they require less hard-coding than the 
REPLACE function. This means that you will need to modify them less as your  
data set changes. This is important with data sets that you (or other people) are 
compiling because humans inevitably introduce errors. Anyone can fat-finger a 
country name when they're entering data.
The regular expression that we entered includes the string to search (Country 
source), the pattern to search, which is entered in quotation marks, and the 
replacement, which is blank, as shown in the following screenshot:
The pattern that we entered, which is also called a token, has several parts. This is 
shown in the following screenshot:
Everything within the quotation marks is a token. Working from the outside, the plus 
sign asks Tableau Public to match any of the expressions inside the brackets. Within 
the brackets, there are two expressions that need to be found, namely a period and a 
letter d. These expressions are very different from each other; the period is a literal, 
which means that we want Tableau Public to find all the periods. The d is a variable, 
and it means that we want Tableau Public to find numbers.
The two expressions, namely the period and the d variable, are preceded by a 
backslash. This is an escape. The concept of escapes is beyond the scope of this book. 
However, it is critical to master them if you want to learn how to structure data 
because they tell programming applications where to break apart long strings of 
variable characters, such as URLs. In this case, they ask Tableau Public to look for 
exactly the expression that we have entered.

The aggregate functions
Aggregation functions in Tableau Public are performed typically on numeric 
fields. In this section, we will show you how to use the default aggregations on 
visualizations as well as how to use them in calculated fields.
The following are the aggregate functions that are available for you to apply on  
a field are also available in the calculated field dialog box. Tableau Public has 
arranged them in order from the greatest to the least commonly used functions  
for the visualization as follows:
•	
SUM: This adds up the values within a partition
•	
Average: This sums the measure and divides it by the number of dimension 
members in the partition
•	
Median: This provides the measure value that's halfway between the greatest 
and least values
•	
COUNT and COUNTD: These count the number of dimension members  
and the number of distinct dimension members respectively; they are 
typically performed on dimensions rather than measures
•	
Minimum and Maximum: These take the least and greatest values in the 
partition respectively
•	
Percentile: This provides the numeric value at which a percentage of the 
partition that you specify falls beneath (we'll use this for several examples)
•	
Standard Deviation: This is the square root of the variance for a data set,  
and it is the unit of measurement of distance from the mean within a data  
set; it is commonly represented by the Greek letter, sigma
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 5
[ 95 ]
•	
Variance: This is the average distance from the mean value, and it's used to 
measure the distribution of a data set
The variance and standard deviation are two of the basic measurements 
in statistics. Advanced statistics in Tableau Public are beyond the scope 
of this book, but if you understand the concepts, you will find that 
there are several capabilities within Tableau Public that provide rich 
statistical functionality.
The most basic aggregation is a sum, and it's the default for numeric fields in 
Tableau. The second and third most basic aggregations are counts and averages. 
When you add a measure to a visualization, Tableau Public automatically sums it. 
In the following example, which uses the data on global floods that we referenced 
earlier, we do the following three things to create a map:
1.	 Double-click on Country in the Dimensions pane to create a symbol map.
2.	 Double-click on SUM(Affected sq km) in the Measures pane to change the 
map into a filled map.
3.	 Right-click on the Context menu for the color legend. Change it to a reversed 
orange-blue diverging color spectrum so that the higher numbers represent 
greater flood damage, as shown in the following screenshot:
www.it-ebooks.info
WWW.EBOOK777.COM

Calculations
[ 96 ]
Note that on the Marks card, Affected sq km is summed. Therefore, you see the 
total area affected for each country in the whole data set. There is a major flaw with 
this method of aggregation, it is not normalized. It would be more useful to have 
a rate, such as the average area affected per flood, or to add context by creating an 
aggregation that tells you the percentage of the total area that was affected. For 
instance, we know that in Pakistan, there were catastrophic floods in 2010, and  
China traditionally also has had severe floods. However, these countries are in  
blue, which seemingly indicates that their floods were less severe.
Let's start changing aggregations, and thus add context and reduce the likelihood 
that someone will misinterpret our visualization, by changing the Measure  
function to an Average function. The easiest way to do this is by performing  
the following steps:
•	
Click on your aggregation context menu.
•	
Click on Measure(SUM).
•	
Click on Average.
Changing this measure to an Average will average the square kilometers of all of  
the rows related to each country. This means that if there were three floods in the  
US and they affected 1 million, 2 million, and 3 million square kilometers 
respectively, then the average would be 2 million.
If you would like to set the default aggregation for a field, you 
can right-click on it in the Measures pane, click on Default 
Properties, select Aggregation, and select the appropriate 
aggregation for your needs.
The result is a visualization that shows much more appropriate context. From this, 
we can gauge the average severity in terms of the total area affected by each flood in 
every country. In the next chapter, we will rank the countries, which adds even more 
context and relates them to each other for the user.
We added the number of records as well as the sum of the affected square miles to 
the tooltip so that when you roll over a country, you see the total number of floods, 
the total area affected, and the average area affected by each flood, as shown in the 
following screenshot. Using a tooltip is a great way of adding context, which is the 
art of relating two data points to each other and to the consumer:

The logic functions
Logic functions enable you to tell Tableau Public what to do when certain conditions 
are met. They are also known as conditional statements. The format is commonly 
referred to as IF THEN ELSE. You, as a programmer, ask Tableau to test whether a 
row of data meets a certain condition. If it does meet the condition, then there is an 
output, which can be another field, a discrete number, or a string. If the condition is 
not met, then you want a different output.
There are several logic functions in Tableau. Some of these functions are sub-
functions or parts of others. We will focus on the following major functions:
•	
IF, followed by THEN, ELSE-IF, or ELSE: This tests whether a condition  
is met and show the result if it is met as well as other conditions that need  
to be tested and results that need to be produced in case none of the 
conditions are met.
•	
The IIF statement: This tests for a minimum of one condition and then 
provides the results when the condition is or is not met. It follows the same 
format as that of IF in Microsoft Excel.
•	
The IFNULL function: This identifies what Tableau Public should do in  
case a value is null. This is particularly useful for aggregations of dirty  
data sets, which are very common.
www.it-ebooks.info
WWW.EBOOK777.COM

Calculations
[ 98 ]
•	
The CASE statement: This tells Tableau Public what to do when a parameter 
or a string field has a very specific value. Unlike the CASE statements in 
ANSI SQL, Tableau Public does not accept aggregations in these.
•	
AND, OR, and NOT: These link or negate conditions that need to be met.
•	
END: This is critically important, as it terminates the loops of the IF and 
CASE statements. Tableau Public will tell you in case you need to add it and 
have not done so.
The IF statements are very useful. You can use them to group members and set 
thresholds, among many other uses. The condition that needs to be met can be a 
variety of things. In the first example, we will create a new measure in a transformation 
of the World Bank indicator data that we have extracted and transformed, and it's 
called population and land data.
We will create a new measure that gives us the total land area of a country. We want to 
use this measure to determine the percentage of each country's area that was flooded, 
but this measure does not exist in the Floods data, but it does exist in the Population 
and Land Data. Later in this chapter, we will blend the data sources to create a 
calculated field that uses it in the denominator.
The Population and Land Data does not have a metric called total area. The way the 
data source is structured, the measures are in rows and not columns, with a field 
representing the corresponding metric value, as shown in the following screenshot. 
We need to create a calculated field that states that if Indicator Name is Land area 
(sq. km), then we want the Indicator Value to appear as follows:
www.it-ebooks.info
WWW.EBOOK777.COM

free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 5
[ 99 ]
In order to do this, we will follow these steps:
1.	 Create a new calculated field in the Population and Land Data source by 
clicking on the Context menu in the Data window and selecting Create 
Calculated Field.
2.	 Name the calculated field Area of Country.
3.	 Start an IF statement that says that if the Indicator Name is Land area  
(sq. km), then Tableau Public should use Indicator Value. Otherwise,  
it should use 0.
4.	 End the statement.
5.	 Validate that there are no error messages.
6.	 Click on OK. The result is shown in the following screenshot:
In this statement, if we did not include the ELSE statement, then the products of 
the field would be null for every value of Indicator Value that isn't specified, and 
we do not want nulls, because performing any kind of mathematical operation on a 
null value results in a null value even when you're adding or multiplying it by valid 
numbers. So, we included else 0, even though we did not necessarily need to do so, 
in order to preserve the integrity of the data set.
Another good use of an IF statement is to create groups or establish performance 
thresholds. In the World Bank Indicators data source, there is a field that identifies 
the percentage of its GDP that each country spends on public health. The first 
quartile is at five percent, the median is at seven percent, and the upper quartile is at 
nine percent. In the following example, we will use mathematical functions to group 
the countries according to what their average expenditure on public health is. (You 
can download this data set from www.worldbank.org).
www.it-ebooks.info
WWW.EBOOK777.COM

Calculations
[ 100 ]
In this example, we have hard-coded the values in the inequalities, which means that 
the thresholds used for the groups are not dynamic. In the next chapter, we will use 
window calculations to make them dynamic.
We created a simple box plot that shows the maximum health expenditure as a 
percentage of the GDP per country in 2010. Since we put Country on the Detail  
shelf, Tableau Public graphs one mark per country. In the calculated field, we  
even accounted for null values, as represented in the ELSE statement. Then, we  
put this new calculated field on the Color shelf of the box plot, as shown in the 
following screenshot:
Perform the following steps to create this graph:
1.	 Add Health: Health expenditure, total (% GDP) to the Columns shelf.
2.	 From the Analysis menu, deselect Aggregate Measures.
3.	 Drag Date to the Filters shelf and select YEAR.
4.	 Filter YEAR to 2010.
5.	 Drag Military: Expenditures (% GDP) to the Size shelf.
6.	 Drag Country to the Detail shelf on the Marks card.
7.	 Create a new calculated field called Health Expenditure Quartile,  
and provide Tableau Public with several conditions to test.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 5
[ 101 ]
We wrote the conditions in a specific order so that for each country, 
the accurate value is the output.
8.	 Drag the new field named Health Expenditure Quartile to the Color shelf.
9.	 Adjust the colors so that the lower quartiles are in red and the upper 
quartiles are in blue.
This IF statement is similar to the two other types of logic statements in Tableau 
Public, namely IIF and CASE.
The structure of IIF is the same as that of the IF statements in excel, and it's very 
similar to the IF statement that we just created in that you are asking Tableau Public 
to test a condition and then provide the results according to the logical outcome, 
which can be either true or false. In the following example, we will ask Tableau 
Public whether the last letter of the name of each country is A.
There are two possible outcomes—yes, the condition is met, and no, it is not met.  
We tell Tableau Public what value to use for each possible outcome. We can use a 
string, a number, another field or aggregation, or even nothing at all.
In the following example, which is for demonstration purposes, we ask Tableau 
Public to test whether each country name in the global major floods data, which was 
trimmed in the section on string functions, ends with the letter A. If the condition is 
met, the result should be blank (which is different from NULL), but in case it is not 
met, then the outcome should be the last letter of the country:

Blending data sources
If you want to create a calculated field that produces the percentage of the total land 
flooded during an event, we need to use a data source that has this information in 
it. Most stories need more than one data source. When you are adding in secondary 
data sources, it's important to know what the level of aggregation is if you have 
joined data sources with different levels of aggregation and have not accounted 
for that when blending them because if you fail to do so, you might get the wrong 
results in your calculated fields.
The flood data is aggregated at the event level. This means that for every major flood, 
we have summarized data—the start date, end date, location, total land area affected, 
and so on. This is moderately granular data. If it were even more summarized, it 
might be summed up as floods per year per country.
We want to know the total percent of land flooded each year, and for this, we will 
assume that the area of each country is static throughout time. So, we created a new 
data source. We filtered the World Bank indicators data (available at http://data.
worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators/) in this data 
source to include only the indicators pertaining to the land area or population. The 
World Bank indicator data is aggregated by country by year, which is not the same 
level of aggregation as that of the data on floods; it is higher. So, in our calculated 
field, which will sum the total area flooded and then divide it by the total area of 
each country, we will need to tell Tableau how to aggregate the total area of each 
country. Otherwise, we will get the wrong results.
First, we need to join the data sources. In the companion workbook, which can 
be found at [X], we have a data source called Population and Land Data. This is 
the version of the World Bank indicators that we have filtered. It has only four 
dimensions, in this case, we have three, Country, Indicator Name, and Year. The 
data source on floods has Country Name and several other date fields. We want to 
join on Country name, as shown in the following screenshot:
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 5
[ 103 ]
If we look at the Population and Land Data source, we do not see any of the gray 
chain links next to our dimensions that indicate that the fields are linked. There's 
a reason behind this. The names of the fields are not exactly the same. In order for 
Tableau Public to identify the join conditions automatically, the field names need 
to be exactly the same, with both capitalization, punctuation, and content. The field 
types need to be exactly the same as well.
From the Data menu, we can create a join on Country name in the Floods, as follows:
1.	 Click on Edit Relationships.
2.	 In the Edit Relationships dialog box, which is shown in the following 
screenshot, ensure that the appropriate data source is selected as the  
primary data source, which is the data source from which the first field  
is added to the visualization.
3.	 Select the appropriate secondary data source.
4.	 Click on the Custom radio button in case it is not selected by default.  
In this case, there are no automatic joins. Therefore, Tableau Public  
assumes that we need custom joins.
5.	 Click on Add:

Next, we need to tell Tableau Public that the Country Name field in the major  
global floods data, which was created to remediate data quality issues, is the  
same as the Country field in the major global floods data source, as shown in  
the following screenshot:
You can create only one custom join at a time. So for instance, if you would like 
to add more joins, such as a date field, you need to add each one individually by 
clicking on the OK button and then clicking on the Add button again, which we  
did in order to add a second join on the year of the event.
Note the small arrow next to the Began field, which is above Country Name.  
This field allows you to establish a join condition on a specific date part. Since  
we also wanted to join the data sources on the year of the flood event, we expanded 
the list to see the appropriate dateparts, clicked on Year, and then selected Year in 
the secondary data source.
We clicked on OK again to return to the visualization, which is still the map that  
we created that shows the average flooded land.
The view is now different. Looking at the Data window for the Population and Land 
Data source, you will see that that there are two chain links, the chain link for Country, 
and the following is orange. Because the linking field is a part of the visualization, you 
will see that Country Name is on the Detail shelf on the Marks card. However, Year 
has a gray, broken chain link because it is not a part of the visualization. If you want it 
to be used in the calculated fields, click on the gray chain link to activate the join. Even 
though the field might not be on the visualization, it still be a part of calculations using 
fields from its data source, as shown in the following screenshot:

We can create a calculated field that produces the average amount of land in each 
country that was flooded. In this case, since some countries might have had major 
floods that add up to more than 100 percent of the total flooded land, we will create 
the maximum percent of land flooded, as shown in the following screenshot:
In order to create this calculation, perform the following steps:
1.	 Create a new calculated field in the major global floods data source.
It is important that the place where we create the new calculated field 
determines the data source that is the primary data source.

Calculations
[ 106 ]
2.	 Name the field.
3.	 Add Affected sq km to the numerator by dragging it into the dialog box.
4.	 Wrap it in a max function.
5.	 Add a division sign (/) because we want to divide it by the total area of  
the country.
6.	 Click on the Population and Land Data source and drag Area of Country to 
the denominator.
7.	 The denominator is automatically summed. You can change the sum to 
whatever aggregation you would like, but if you do not aggregate the fields 
that are from the secondary data sources, you will get error messages.
8.	 Change the aggregation of the field from the secondary data source, which  
is the field whose name is preceded by its data source name. This is similar  
to a SQL query that is used to find out an average. The reason behind why  
we did this is that for every record in the partition, Tableau Public needs to 
know what to do with the denominator. If we sum it, we will not have the 
proper calculation.
Check out the correct calculated field, It's important to learn how to handle errors. 
The next two errors are very common and are as follows:
•	
The following screenshot shows that we cannot mix aggregate and  
non-aggregate arguments with this function, with the division function 
highlighted. This means that in a calculated field, both arguments must be 
aggregated. We can resolve this by aggregating the numerator or by using 
the ATTR function on it. ATTR tells Tableau to use the discrete value for it:

•	
All fields must be aggregate or constant when using table calculation 
functions or fields from multiple data sources. This means that the 
denominator, which is from a secondary data source, must be aggregated. 
Tableau Public requires this so that it knows how to aggregate. We resolved 
this by placing the AVG function around the denominator and adding an 
aggregation to the denominator:
Summary
In this chapter, we explored the different data types in Tableau Public. You learned 
how to create various types of calculated fields, which enable you to create new 
metrics and tell stories that are relevant and impactful to users.
In the next chapter, we will build on these capabilities to create Level of Detail 
calculations and table calculations.

Level of Detail and  
Table Calculations
In the previous chapter, you learned how to use custom calculations to create new 
fields that add context and insights to the story that you are telling with Tableau 
Public. In this chapter, we will discuss how you can use table calculations and level 
of detail calculations to enhance the comparisons that you are making with the data. 
We will build on several of the calculations that we have created to show you how to 
make them more dynamic and contextual.
The table calculations are different from the traditional calculations because they  
are performed locally on the data in the cache, that is, the data that Tableau Public 
has used to create the visualization. Not all data that is in your data set is in use all 
the time. The data in the cache is what Tableau Public is using in the memory to 
render your visualization. Therefore, the data that you have filtered out will not be 
included in the table calculations.
Level of detail calculations, which are a new feature in Tableau 9.x, allow you to  
tell Tableau Public at exactly which dimensional level you want the calculations to  
be aggregated. We are discussing them along with table calculations because some  
of the concepts are very similar.
Table calculations have the following major functions:
•	
Calculating change over time as a relative percentage
•	
Calculating the percentage of a whole attributed to a  
one-dimensional member
•	
Calculating change relative to other members of a dimension
•	
Distinguishing the maximum or minimum values in a partition
•	
Moving calculations, such as averages and sums

[ 110 ]
•	
Running calculations, such as running sums, that are used for waterfall  
and Pareto graphs
The following are the level of detail calculations that Tableau Public enables you  
to do:
•	
Fix the level of aggregation
•	
Include specific dimensions, that may not be present on the visualization,  
in calculations
•	
Exclude specific dimensions, that are present on the visualization, from 
specific calculations
In this chapter, we will discuss the following table calculations:
•	
Creating quick table calculations
•	
Addressing and partitioning table calculations
•	
Changing over time
•	
Editing table calculations
•	
Moving averages – window max and running max
•	
Ranks and percentiles
•	
Difference from the average
The level of detail calculation concepts that we will discuss involve fixing, including, 
and excluding dimensions, as well as nesting calculations and limitations. A brief 
exercise on editing fields in the shelf is also included in this chapter.
About data sources
We will continue using the World Development Indicators data source, as some of 
these examples will be included in the dashboard that we will develop later in this 
book. You can download the data from the World Bank by visiting http://data.
worldbank.org/products/wdi.
Creating quick table calculations
Tableau Public has a feature that enables the rapid creation of a table calculation. 
After dragging a field onto the visualization, typically a measure, you can aggregate 
and perform table calculations on dimensions, or click on its context menu and select 
Quick Table Calculation. There is one limitation to this—table calculations cannot 
be created on fields that have forecasting turned on.

Chapter 6
[ 111 ]
The following are some of the many different types of quick table calculations, 
though not all of them are available at the same time, and the options vary by the 
type of dimensions and measures that are also on the visualization:
•	
Running total
•	
Difference
•	
Percent difference
•	
Percent of total
•	
Rank
•	
Percentile
•	
Moving average
•	
Year to date (YTD) total
•	
Compound growth rate
•	
Year over year growth
•	
Year to date (YTD) growth
Once you have created a table calculation, you can edit it by either clicking on the 
Context menu on the pill, or right-clicking on it. For each unique table calculation, 
we will explain how to modify it and what the components of the formula mean.
Changing over time
One of the questions that we commonly ask about data is, how has performance 
changed over time? This helps us understand how events of decisions affect 
outcomes. While understanding the relationship between discrete numbers is 
helpful, it's even more useful to understand the rate of change, or the percentage 
change over time. The reason why it's important to understand the rate of change 
is that, while discrete numbers may appear to be increasing, the actual percentage 
change from year to year may be declining.
In the following example, we will discuss how to graph the amount of remittances 
over time and we will create a quick table calculation that shows the percent difference:
1.	 On a new worksheet, using the World Development Indicators data source, 
drag Year from the Dimensions pane to the Columns shelf.
2.	 Drag Remittances (USD) from the Measures pane to the Rows shelf.
3.	 Exclude years before 1980 by using your preferred method. We selected them 
on the x axis, hovered over pill, and selected Exclude.

[ 112 ]
4.	 We now have a basic line graph that shows change over time, but we're 
missing context. While we can see that Remittances have gone up and down, 
we know nothing about how they relate to the economy of the region or its 
population.
5.	 We can edit the measure to produce a rate per capita. We will do this by 
editing it in the shelf, which is a new feature in Tableau 9.x, and adding the 
total population to the denominator (editing in the shelf is a good option for 
simpler aggregations).
6.	 On the Rows shelf, click on the pill for the measure to see the Context menu 
and select Edit in Shelf.
7.	 Enter a division sign after the closing parenthesis, and from the Measures 
pane, drag Total Population to the right of the division sign so that it is in 
the denominator, as shown in the following screenshot:
Since the Remittances (USD) is summed, we need to sum Total 
Population. In a calculated field, both fields must be aggregated or 
disaggregated. We could disaggregate, but that would give us the 
average per country within each region, and when those numbers 
are added up, they will not represent the data accurately.
8.	 In order to give the new field a name, drag it from the Rows shelf to the 
Measures pane, which does not seem intuitive. When prompted, name it 
Remittances per Capita.
9.	 We can create a quick table calculation that shows change over time by  
right-clicking on the Remittances per Capita field on the Label shelf, 
selecting Quick Table Calculation from the context menu, and then  
selecting Percent Difference.
The pill for Remittances per Capita on the Rows shelf now has a 
small delta sign to the right of the name, which signifies that it is a 
table calculation.
10.	 Change the mark type for Remittances per Capita to a bar.

11.	 You can create more context by adding another reference point, namely 
the GDP. Drag GDP (current USD) to the secondary y axis, as shown in 
following screenshot, and then drop it when the secondary y axis has a 
dashed, horizontal line:
12.	 Right-click on the y axis for GDP (current USD), click on the Mary type,  
and select Line.
13.	 The following screenshot shows the fluctuation in remittances, as it relates 
to the global GDP. In 2009, when the global economy was reset, the GDP 
dropped, and so did the remittances:

Compute using
The graph from the previous exercise calculates the percentage difference from year 
to year, which means that the value for each year is being computed relative to the 
previous year. We can ask Tableau Public to calculate the percentage difference 
from different years by clicking on the Context menu for a table calculation of this 
type, and then selecting Relative to. We can calculate the change from the first, next, 
previous (the default one), or last values in a partition.
In the following graph, which is a revision of the previous one, the bar height for 
each year shows the aggregated percentage difference in Remittances per Capita 
since 1980, which is the first year in the visualization. You can do this by performing 
the following steps:
1.	 Click on the Context menu for the Remittances per Capita field on the  
Rows shelf.
2.	 Click on Relative to.
3.	 Select First, as shown in the following screenshot:
Then, perform the same calculation on GDP (current USD). We changed its use on 
the Rows shelf into a quick table calculation for the percentage difference and set it 
to Relative to for the First value in the partition.
We took one extra step—we right-clicked on the secondary y axis, where the GDP 
(current USD) table calculation resides, and selected Synchronize Axis so that the 
axis ranges of both the y axes are the same. This is an important step because we 
want to make sure that the consumers do not perceive a relationship that is  
different from the one that we intend to communicate.
In the following graph, you will see that just around the turn of the century, the  
GDP rate of change since 1980 slowed down, and the rate of change of Remittances 
per Capita overtook it:

Moving average
The moving average is a powerful table calculation because it gives you the ability  
to determine how many previous and future values are included in an average.
For instance, we can change the percent difference table calculation that we 
performed on Remittances per Capita by performing the following steps:
1.	 Click on the Context menu of Remittances per Capita on the Rows shelf.
2.	 Click on Clear Table Calculation.
3.	 Click on the Context menu of Remittances per Capita again, select Quick 
Table Calculation, and then choose Moving Average.
We cleared the table calculation for GDP (current USD) in the following graph  
as well.

[ 116 ]
The following graph shows the moving average of Remittances per Capita since  
1980 versus the GDP:
One thing that we don't know is exactly how smooth the line is. The term "smooth" 
means that more than one value is included in the calculation, and if we edit the 
table calculation, we can control the smoothing. You can also create a parameter  
that gives users a control over the smoothing. More on this will be discussed later  
in the book.
Editing table calculations
So far, we have used only the default settings for the table calculations that we have 
created. Tableau Public gives us several capabilities. Right-clicking on the pill for the 
moving average of Remittances per Capita shows us the following options that are 
available for this field:
•	
Calculation Type: We can change the type of calculation via this  
option. Tableau Public automatically creates a different calculated  
field depending on our selection, and the options available in this  
user interface also vary based on the selection.
www.it-ebooks.info
WWW.EBOOK777.COM

Chapter 6
[ 117 ]
•	
Summarize values using: This gives us the option to select the  
aggregation type. Ours is a SUM, but we can use AVG, MIN,  
and MAX in this type of calculation.
•	
Moving along (or Compute using, with other table calculation types): This 
allows us to address the table calculation. In this example, we have only three 
options, namely Table (Across), Cell, or Date. The default is to compute by 
going across the table, which means that Tableau Public computes the values 
by going from left to right or top to bottom, depending on the location of the 
dimensions and measures.
•	
When you click on the drop-down list, you can customize the way the field is 
computing by telling Tableau Public which fields to Compute using the first 
field, then the second, and so on. In the following screenshot, we have only 
one dimension, namely Year, in use. In case there were others, they would 
appear in the Partitioning pane, and we could add them to the Addressing 
pane and then sort them again. More on this will be discussed later.
•	
The dimensions that we do not select for Compute using are used for 
partitioning, which is called grouping:

Level of Detail and Table Calculations
[ 118 ]
The next feature allows you to tell Tableau Public how many previous and future 
values to include, and you can also determine whether the current values should  
be included. Lines that are smoother include more previous and future values as 
shown in the following screenshot:
•	
Null if there are not enough values, when selected, does not compute  
marks for places when there are not enough values. For instance, if you  
select this for this particular calculation, then the first two years in the 
visualization will not show a line.
•	
Perform a secondary calculation on the result gives you the power to add 
additional table calculations. For instance, if this were a running sum that 
shows the cumulative total, we can use a percentage of the total secondary 
calculation to show the percentage accumulated for each year instead of the 
discrete number.
Manually editing table calculations
Learning how to edit table calculations yourself is an advanced capability, but  
it gives you the opportunity to create rich metrics, such as the percent difference 
from an average.
In the first example, we will modify the running sum of Remittances per Capita  
so that it includes the preceding and next three values, which can be done from the 
edit table calculation dialogue by entering those numbers in their respective places.
In the second example, we will modify the Remittances per Capita percent 
difference table calculation to show the percent difference from the average.

Chapter 6
[ 119 ]
Let's begin with the first example. We'll modify the running sum in the  
following way:
1.	 In order to edit the table calculation, duplicate the sheet on which we created 
the original moving average worksheet, which maintains the integrity of the 
work that we have already done.
2.	 Then, drag the pill for the moving average of Remittances per Capita  
from the Rows shelf to the Measures shelf, which prompts us to rename  
it. Let's call it Smoother Remittances per Capita.
3.	 The original table calculation, as shown in the following screenshot,  
has one function, one expression, a start offset, and an end offset:
°°
The WINDOW_AVG function tells Tableau Public that the field can  
be addressed and we want it to apply the AVG function to the values
°°
The expression, in this case, is the field on which the calculation  
is operating
°°
The start offset, by default, is two places prior to end offset and 
hence, it has the negative sign
°°
The end offset, by default, is at the current value, as shown in  
the following screenshot:
4.	 Modify this calculated field to include three previous and three future values 
by replacing -2 and 0 with 3 and 3 respectively, as shown in the following 
screenshot. You can also create an integer parameter and allow users to set 
the number. We will show you how to do that in the chapter on parameters:
www.it-ebooks.info
WWW.EBOOK777.COM

Level of Detail and Table Calculations
[ 120 ]
The result is a calculated field that is much smoother than the original one.
In the second example, we'll calculate the percentage difference from the average 
Remittances per Capita. First, we will show you the original calculated field, and 
then, we'll show the changes that we made.
We duplicated the sheet on which we were working and then dragged the 
percent differences of the Remittances per Capita field to the Measures pane,  
where we renamed it to Remittances per Capita % Diff from Avg, as shown  
in the following screenshot:
In the formula box, Tableau Public calculates the value for each year, subtracts the 
value of the first year from it, and divides it with the value for the first year.
The following are a few new functions in this formula:
•	
ZN: This means that Tableau Public uses 0 if the value is null.
•	
LOOKUP: This finds a value specified by an offset from the current value.  
In this case it's -1, which means the previous value, but it could be anything. 
The other values are the FIRST() and LAST() functions.
•	
ABS: This takes the absolute value of the previous value. When writing table 
calculations, you should always use ZN and ABS, even if you think you 
don't need them at the time, because you do not necessarily know what will 
be in your data set in the future.
In order for this to be the percent difference from the average, change the references 
to the first value to the references to the WINDOW_AVG.
•	
Replace LOOKUP with WINDOW_AVG.
•	
Then, delete both instances of the string and the FIRST() function, because 
in this case, the WINDOW_AVG does not need an offset, like we had in the 
previous exercise. We want to use the average for the whole partition.

The new formula looks like the one shown in the following screenshot:
Ranking
Our examples so far have focused on comparing measures that occur along a 
time continuum. Table calculations are useful for a comparison between different 
dimensions as well. Ranking by discrete numbers, as well as percentiles, is powerful. 
Many people want to know the top or bottom number of members in a dimension. 
In the next example, the final product shows the bottom 20 percent of the countries 
in each region according to their availability of improved water sources, and each 
country will be colored by its percentile of life expectancy.
Start off by creating a basic bar graph from the World Development Indicators data 
source that shows the maximum percentage of a country's population that has access 
to improved water sources. Drag Region and Country to the Rows shelf. Then, 
when we drag Improved Water Source (%) to the Columns shelf, we aggregate it 
as a maximum rather than a sum. Select MAX based on the assumption that unless 
there's a major natural disaster (such as floods and earthquakes, which were used as 
data points in the previous chapter) or war, it's unlikely that the access to clean water 
will decrease.
Then, sort the countries in the ascending order by clicking on the sort icon on the  
x axis.
The real ranking tasks begin here, with the label. The objective is to show the  
bottom 20 percent by region. So, we need to do several things along the way that 
help explain the ranking functionality. Perform the following steps:
1.	 Drag Improved Water Source (%) to the Label shelf.
2.	 Then, click on it and select Quick Table Calculation.
3.	 The Quick Table Calculation that we selected is Rank. Then, drag the field  
to the Measures pane and rename it to Country Rank – Water.

4.	 Check out the snippet of the visualization in the following screenshot; each 
country is ranked in the descending order by the percentage of citizens who 
have access to clean drinking water:
5.	 Note that the countries are ranked as a part of the whole table. We would  
like to rank them by region. Therefore, click on the pill, which is present on 
the Label shelf, select Compute using, and choose Pane (down).
6.	 To the lower-right of the visualization, there is an indicator that we have 
several null values. This is because some of the countries have not reported 
these data points. Click on the indicator to exclude the countries with null 
values.
7.	 There are other functions, such as INDEX(), that perform similar tasks, except 
that INDEX() actually produces the row number in the partition and not the 
rank. If you change the sort order of the countries shown, the labels stay the 
same; wherever you see Somalia, it will be ranked 53 in Africa.
The next task is to show the bottom 20 percent of the countries. Showing the top 20 
percent would not add much value since the measure cannot exceed 100 percent of 
the population. In order to do this, we created a new calculated field called Percentile 
Filter, and told Tableau that we want to know whether the percentile of each country 
is less than 2. This means that it's in the bottom 20 percent of all the countries in its 
partition. Then, define the partition. The default is that the entire table is the partition, 
but we want each pane to be the partition.
The filter shown in the following screenshot has three possible results, namely true, 
false, and null, which makes it a Boolean field that shows up with a T|F icon in the 
data window. Since we excluded the nulls, we will not get null values:

In order to make sure that the total ranking of the countries in each region and 
showing only the bottom 20 percent, perform the following steps:
1.	 Click on Default Table Calculation.
2.	 Select Country.
3.	 Click on OK.
4.	 Click on OK again.
5.	 Drag the field to the Filters shelf.
6.	 Select TRUE.
You can also allow users to see the percentage of their preference by creating a 
parameter with a data type of float and a rank from 0 to 1.00 that replaces the  
hard-coded .2 in the formula, as shown in previous screenshot.
There are several functions within Tableau Public for ranking, and except for  
RANK_PERCENTILE, the other functions vary only in the way they use unique  
or duplicate ranking values.
Window versus running functions
We have briefly discussed the WINDOW functions already. There's also another type of 
function, called the RUNNING function. The WINDOW functions have specific partitions, 
that is, they measure either the whole table, pane, or cell, or from a specific number 
of previous or future values. Alternatively, the RUNNING function compares all the 
values before the current value in the partition.

In the following example, we graphed the average percentage of the GDP that was 
from high-tech exports by region and by year in the World Development Indicators 
data source. This is a simple spark bar graph. We have hidden the header for the y 
axis in this graph.
We created a calculated field that, for each year, tests whether the average High Tech 
Exports as a percentage of the GDP is equal to the running maximum, that is, is the 
value for any year higher than all the years before it. The results are true and false,  
as shown in the following screenshot:
The RUNNING_MAX function, which is one of several RUNNING functions, does not 
have the start and end offsets like the WINDOW functions. However, you still need to 
address it.
A note on addressing
The following table calculation computes across the pane. You can also set it  
to Compute using Year. Year is the field along the x axis. Addressing the table 
calculation across the pane tells it to compute across the x axis and then to use other 
fields on the visualization, such as Region, as the partition or group. So, this field is 
addressed across year, and the calculation is performed for each Region.
Add the Region field to the Color shelf in the visualization and then format the  
true values so that they are blue, and format the false values so that they are orange, 
as shown in the following screenshot:

The level of detail calculations
The level of detail calculations (LOD) enable you to tell Tableau Public at exactly 
which dimensional level you would like to aggregate without having to place that 
dimension on the visualization. Additionally, you can include or exclude dimensions 
in the calculations and create calculations that include all the underlying data.

Level of Detail and Table Calculations
[ 126 ]
The following are the three types of LOD calculations:
•	
FIXED: This computes a value for the dimension that you specify
•	
INCLUDE: This computes at a dimensional level and is not included  
in the visualization itself
•	
EXCLUDE: This excludes a dimension that is a part of the visualization
LOD has a big caveat. While you can perform table calculations on them and create 
aggregations and functions within them, you cannot include table calculations in them.
A FIXED LOD calculation
Each LOD calculation has the following three features that are different from those 
that we have discussed before:
•	
The LOD expression type: In this case, the LOD expression type is FIXED
•	
The Dimension on which the calculation is operating (you can add 
dimension levels, which should be arranged in the increasing order of 
granularity by separating them with a comma): In this case, it is Region
•	
The Aggregation: In this case, it is COUNTD([Country Name])
Note that the entire expression is enclosed in curly braces, as shown in the following 
screenshot. The LOD calculations are the only instances in Tableau Public where you 
will use curly braces:
This field provides us with the unique number of countries in each region, even 
though 80 percent of these countries are filtered out. This provides great context.
In the following example, we will discuss:
1.	 Add this field, which is a measure, to the Rows shelf to the right of Country.
2.	 Then, click on its Context menu and select Discrete instead of continuous so 
that it becomes a dimension.

3.	 Drag the field so that it's to the right of Region and to the left of Country, as 
shown in the following screenshot:
This visualization shows us the bottom 20 percent of the 53 countries in Africa in the 
data set. It would be even more helpful to know what the overall access to improved 
water sources is in each region and not just by country.
The following are a few issues that we need to overcome with virtualization:
•	
The data is not necessarily set up for this.
•	
The granularity of the data is at the country level, and we only know the 
percentage in each country that has access to clean water. We don't know  
the discrete number.
•	
We do not have the totals by region. We need to determine the overall 
number of people with access to clean drinking water, and then we need  
to divide this number by the population of each region.
The INCLUDE and nested LOD calculations
In the following example, we will show you how to solve some problem by using an 
INCLUDE LOD calculation nested within a FIXED LOD calculation, and each will be 
aggregated. This is an issue that most people have had to solve by using data sources 
with different levels of aggregation, which takes a lot of time to develop and render 
in Tableau Public.
Create a new field within the World Development Indicators data source and name it 
Population with Access to Improved Water. It's kind of a long name, but we want to 
ensure that no one misunderstands the metric.

Level of Detail and Table Calculations
[ 128 ]
So, here's our approach to calculating the overall percentage of each region with 
access to clean water:
•	
The primary LOD type is FIXED at the Region level.
•	
The numerator (enclosed in the red box shown in the following screenshot) 
adds up the total population that has access to clean water.
•	
The secondary LOD type is INCLUDE at the Country Name level. We  
are using INCLUDE because we want to roll up the country-level data  
to the region.
Rationale: For every country, we need to know the total population that has access 
to the sources of clean water. We have the percentage of the population. So, we need 
to multiply the maximum percentage with the total population to get the number of 
people who have access to clean water.
•	
The denominator (enclosed in the blue box in the following screenshot)  
is the total population. We need to know the total population by region.  
So, we add up the total population of each country.
•	
We will use the INCLUDE function at the Country Name level and then use 
the MAX aggregations. The granularity of the data is at the Year level. We 
are not including Year, because that would produce the population at the 
Country Name and Year level. We just want the total population of each 
country, as shown in the following screenshot:

This is a long field, but it accomplishes what has been difficult before, namely 
aggregating at multiple dimensional levels in one calculation without duplications, 
and aggregating records that are not a part of the visualization.
Add this field to the Rows shelf of the previous bar chart, turn it into a discrete field, 
and drag it to the left of Country Name, just as we did for Country Count.
Also, right-click on the new calculated field, click on Default Properties, and then 
select Format so that we can set the number format as a percentage.
Here's the finished product. Only 69 percent of the people in Africa have access to 
clean drinking water:
Summary
In this chapter, you learned how to create quick table calculations to add depth and 
context to your visualizations. You also learned how to edit table calculations, how  
the different types of table calculations function, and how to address table calculations 
and create them manually. One of the important features of data analysis is the 
comparison of a data point to the others around it so that users understand the  
context of its performance. You learned how to create a basic, and advanced level of 
detail calculations to aggregate data points that are not visible, and to aggregate at 
multiple dimensional levels as well.
In the next chapters, which focus on mapping and parameters, we will discuss  
using many of the concepts that you learned here to give control to your users  
and illustrate compelling, rich stories with contextually curated visualizations.

Dashboard Design and 
Styling
The purpose of a dashboard is to tell a story. In the scheme of human history, 
hieroglyphs, the Bible, epic poems, theatre, comic books, and even social media are  
a few of the many different media through which we recount events to each other. 
All stories have one of the several primary purposes, to teach values or historical 
lessons, create culture, motivate people to take action, or entertain, to name a few.
Knowing the purpose of the story that you are telling is imperative to making it 
memorable. Good stories have several important attributes, which should be kept in 
mind when you are working. Some of these attributes are as follows:
•	
They're simple and focused
•	
They create an emotional response
•	
Listeners can relate to the actors in them
•	
They have good, real data
It's a good idea to take a few minutes to think about the story that you want to tell 
before you even create a new dashboard. Think about the stories that are the most 
memorable to you and the data points in them. Then, put yourself in the place of 
your listener. Design with your listener in mind. If you can develop a list of the top 
three data questions that you think are most important to your listener and then 
design a dashboard that focuses on answering them simply and evocatively, then 
your dashboard will likely be impactful.

With Tableau Public, you can tell stories in a variety of ways—with individual 
visualizations, well-formed dashboards, and story points. You can also integrate 
your work in Tableau Public into other tools by using the JavaScript API (which is 
beyond the scope of this book). But just because there are many tools and options 
at your disposal, it does not mean that you should make your dashboards overly 
complicated. It's actually just the opposite. Good journalism focuses on keeping 
stories simple, and you should use the same ethos with your stories. Just because you 
can do something doesn't mean that you should do it.
It truly applies well to designing dashboards; less is more. Knowing your user and 
their questions is fundamental to a good design, and everything else flows from that.
In Tableau Public, you can make a dashboard from one or more visualizations, and 
you can add images, free text, filters, legends, parameters, links, and even embedded 
web pages. All of these capabilities are designed to enable you to create a data 
story that has the right context for your dashboard, both for the consumer and for 
its relativity to other events and data elements. While you can publish individual 
worksheets to Tableau Public, we encourage you to organize your work into 
dashboards so that you can guide your user through a complete story.
In this chapter, we will discuss some best practices for dashboard creation,  
the elements of a dashboard, and how to navigate the dashboard worksheet.  
The following topics will be discussed in this chapter:
•	
The design process
•	
Best practices of dashboard design
•	
The elements of a successful dashboard
•	
Creating a dashboard
•	
Adding context with titles, images, links, and tooltips
In the next chapter, we will discuss dashboard filters, actions, and parameters,  
and after that, we will discuss publishing your work to Tableau Public.
The dashboard design process
The purpose of Tableau Public is to help you tell data stories interactively. 
Dashboard design, like view design, should tell a concise story that flows from one 
element to the next. When you are first starting your journey of dashboard design in 
Tableau Public, you should expect it to be an iterative process in which you design 
dashboards and revise them over time, often with input from other people. You 
might also find it helpful to draw out dashboards before building them in Tableau 
Public. Leave room and time for experimentation when building your dashboard.

You may find that more views, or different views, are needed in order to tell your 
story. Pulling various views together into a dashboard sometimes exposes flaws in 
the initial design. In that case, go back and change or add to your views, and then 
come back to the dashboard design process.
Best practices for dashboard design
Dashboard design should highlight data and decoration should be limited, to add to 
a reader's understanding. Much has been written about dashboard design for data 
visualization. The following are some key points that you should consider when 
designing dashboards:
•	
Keep it simple: Your dashboard needs to answer only one question. If you 
can construct it so elegantly that it answers several questions, that's great, but 
according to Stephen Few, the maximum number of data points that any of us 
can remember at once is three.
•	
Keep in mind the audience: Consider what devices will be used to read or 
consume the data story and content.
•	
The method of consumption: Will users interact with virtualization on their 
computer, mobile phone, or tablet? Size your dashboard accordingly.
•	
Performance: Like any other web application, the amount of time it takes for 
a consumer to get what they need is a major factor of performance. Design 
your visualizations and data sources so that they perform efficiently.
•	
Start big and end small: Always place the most aggregated (macro) data 
points or summary metrics on the upper left, and guide users to granular, 
actionable data points.
•	
Use colors, graphics, and fonts that are appropriate for your subject matter 
and consumers. Choose a simple, single color or complementary palette 
colors. Consider red-green color blindness and improve accessibility. Remove 
all non-data ink except labels, limited titles, and bare-bones instructional 
text. Additionally, you can create your own custom color palettes in Tableau 
Public fairly easily. Use labels, titles, and simple instructional text for the 
dashboard, and format tooltips so that they add context and calls to action 
for your users.

For the dashboard that we are using in this chapter, we created a rough wireframe 
in Microsoft Visio. We'll refer to it throughout this chapter so that you can see how 
the functional elements that we are discussing will be included in the final design. 
It's fairly common for people to draw out the designs that they would like to build 
in Tableau Public. Also, it's a great way to keep your objectives in perspective when 
laying out the dashboard in Tableau Public.
Our sample dashboard, which will be included in a blog post at www.dataviz.
ninja, follows the Rule of Thirds—after adding the title to the dashboard, the three 
primary visualizations, namely aggregated data, change over time, and granular 
details, will consume about one-third of the total space, as shown in the following 
screenshot. We have also provided space for filters and color legends, and we will 
continue to use this dashboard design concept in the following two chapters, which 
cover filtering and publishing:

Creating a dashboard
Creating a Tableau Public dashboard is a process of adding the various elements 
(starting with worksheets), onto the dashboard canvas, adding titles, configuring 
filters, titles, and layout, and then modifying the behavior of the dashboard.
Now, we will build a dashboard from simple visualizations that were created by 
using the Climate Change data that was published by the World Bank and which 
is available at http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/climate-change. 
It's structured in a way that is similar to that of the other data sources that we are 
using. You can download the sample dashboards from https://public.tableau.
com/views/Chaper7-Dashboards/CO2EmissionsDashboard. We will use the data 
sources that we have discussed in the previous chapters to build sample dashboards 
so that you can download the source files to practice.
Our workbook includes a summary map of carbon dioxide emissions by country 
in 2008, as well as a line graph that shows change over time as regards the total 
emissions and emissions per capita by region. Lastly, it contains a heat map that 
shows the foreign aid distributed for generic programs by the United States by year.
The objective of this section is to build a dashboard that allows users to navigate 
from high-level areas of interest, that is, outliers, to more detailed data to identify 
causation.
To start the dashboard creation process, click on the dashboard tab at the bottom of 
the Tableau Public interface. The dashboard tab is the tab with an icon of a rectangle 
divided into four quadrants, which is outlined in the following screenshot.
You can also browse Dashboard | New Dashboard from the Menu bar:
When you select the dashboard tab, the dashboard view is displayed. This is the 
interface that allows you to build and configure dashboards from the worksheets 
that you have already created in this workbook. To the left of the window are 
the available worksheets. From the left side of the window, you can also add to 
the dashboard various supporting elements such as text boxes, labels, web page 
windows, and images. To the right is the canvas area of the dashboard, where sheets 
and objects are dragged to, arranged, and configured.

The dashboard tab interface
The dashboard interface is similar to the worksheet workspace in many ways.  
In the following screenshot, we have identified its several key areas.
Like the worksheet view, the dashboard has the following elements:
•	
The menus and toolbar, which are placed horizontally across the top  
of the page
•	
The Dashboard pane on the left, where you can determine the exact 
composition of your dashboard
•	
The canvas, where you will drag worksheets and other visual elements
We have numbered the elements on the dashboard, as shown in the following 
screenshot. They are as follows:
•	
A list of worksheets (1) that have not been hidden and which are sorted 
according to the order in which they are arranged in your workbook
•	
Containers and objects (2) that can be dragged onto your dashboard to 
increase the integrity of the design
•	
A controller (3) for new objects
•	
A hierarchy of dashboard objects (4) that can be used for navigation
•	
A controller (5) for the dashboard size
•	
The canvas (6) where you will compose the dashboard
If you are creating a new dashboard, the canvas will be blank. If you open an existing 
dashboard, the various existing dashboard elements will be displayed on the canvas. 
The following screenshot shows the dashboard interfaces:

It's important to keep in mind the purpose of your dashboard. We are building a 
dashboard that tells the story of carbon dioxide emissions over time. The dashboard 
should allow users to navigate to the areas of interest and then understand the 
factors of consumption.
The dashboard will have the following key elements, which were previously 
discussed:
•	
Title, so that our users know what they are viewing
•	
At least one visualization with data and proper context is required so that 
different data points relate to each other and to the user
•	
A call to action (conclusion) is also needed so that users know how to explore 
the details within the dashboard or go to another web page

In order to build this dashboard, we will start with a single visualization, which is 
the visualization with summary data in this case. Drag a sheet onto the canvas by 
hovering over the visualization that you want to add, pressing the left mouse button, 
and dragging it onto the canvas, as depicted in the following screenshot. You can 
also double-click on the worksheet name.
If you wish to remove a worksheet from the dashboard, click on the title of  
the visualization until a grey container bar appears at the top border of the 
visualization. Then, right-click on the grey bar. Select Remove from Dashboard  
from the shortcut menu:
The result, as shown in the following screenshot, shows the map that we created. 
This map shows the CO2 emissions per capita in 2008, which was taken from the 
World Bank official website. Each country is colored by its relative percentile in the 
data set, and the label shows the CO2 emissions per capita.

However, users don't know all of that yet:
Tableau Public automatically added the following two elements:
•	
The worksheet name as the title
•	
The color legend in a vertical layout container to the right
In order to compose an empathetically designed user experience with proper context, 
we need to use layout containers to rearrange the dashboard and create a flow of 
both navigation and information, that is, a data story. The next section discusses 
layout objects, and we will show examples of how to use them.

Layout objects
Tableau Public has several different layout objects that you can add to your 
dashboard to control the composition.
Objects are versatile, and you can use them to reflect the overall theme of your 
graphic composition. From the context menu of an object, you can perform the 
following tasks:
•	
Format it with borders and background colors
•	
Remove it
•	
Set it as a floating or tiled object
•	
Deselect it
•	
Remove it from the dashboard
You can set the height and width attributes for floating objects, just like you can  
for worksheets that you have added (and for the dashboard as a whole, which is 
highly encouraged).
The following objects can be added to your dashboard:
•	
Horizontal layout containers: You can drag worksheets that you want next to 
each other into these containers.
•	
Vertical layout containers: You can drag other objects and worksheets that 
you want to stack from top to bottom into these containers.
•	
Text objects: These can be used to add titles and calls to action. Though you 
can't add field tokens to text objects, you can add parameter tokens, which 
will be discussed in depth in the next chapter.
•	
Images: You can use these to browse logos or branding elements that add 
richness to your dashboard. You can also use images as links to web pages, 
since each image can have a URL attribute.
•	
Web page objects: These can be used to add content from the Internet.  
You can even create dynamic content, which will be covered in the next 
chapter too.
•	
Blank objects: These objects can be used to control space. Blank containers  
are transparent. So, the background colors that you are using will show 
through them.

[ 141 ]
In the section of the dashboard pane that says New objects, the 
default object is set to Tiled. You should leave it there until you are 
comfortable with dashboard design. Each new object that you add 
to your dashboard will have this setting, and though you can easily 
change the attribute for individual sheets on a dashboard, it's best to 
keep things simple in the beginning. The Tiled automatically aligns 
objects to the dashboard grid, and floating adds new objects to the 
dashboard that are detached from the dashboard grid.
When you add objects, like worksheets, into a horizontal or vertical layout container, 
the widths and heights of the objects will be sized automatically, unless you specify 
otherwise. In case you're using actions, which will be discussed in the next chapter, 
it's particularly useful to use containers for sizing automatically.
Setting the size of dashboard elements
Usually, dashboard elements such as containers can be set by manipulating the 
border handles of each container and resizing them to a suitable size. Tableau Public 
also offers a Size feature, as shown in the following screenshot, that allows for more 
control in the positioning and sizing of these dashboard elements:
The dashboard element must be in the floating mode so that it can 
be sized and positioned. In case the container or element is not 
already in the floating mode, it can be set to floating by clicking on 
the dashboard element and checking off the Floating checkbox, as 
shown in the previous screenshot.
To change the positioning of the dashboard element, enter the x and y coordinates 
(this will take some trial and error) in the corresponding Pos: fields, or scroll up and 
down with the arrows for fine correction. To change Size, enter the width (w) and 
height (h) values in the corresponding fields using the up and down arrows for  
fine adjustment.

[ 142 ]
In the Size section of the Tableau Public controls on the left side of the dashboard, 
you can also choose to show the title of a particular chart by selecting or deselecting 
the Show Title checkbox. You must first select the dashboard element either in the 
dashboard, or in the Layout section of the Tableau Public controls. To show or hide 
the title of the dashboard, you can click on the Dashboard field in the Layout section 
and select or deselect Show Title. This may also be done, as described earlier in this 
chapter, by using the Dashboard | Show Title menu command.
Sizing the dashboard
Tableau Public presents many size options for the entire dashboard. This feature 
helps you select a size either for a blog or other website, or optimized for a tablet 
computer. To set the dashboard size, click on Dashboard in the Layout section of the 
Tableau Public controls.
There is also an option to resize the entire dashboard. For example, you may  
find that scrollbars appear to the right, or at the bottom of the dashboard, that 
you don't want to see. Alternatively, you may prefer matching the dashboard to a 
standard web page or computer desktop size. Again, in the Layout section, select 
Dashboard, or ensure that no worksheet or other elements are selected on the 
dashboard itself. The Size section presents a drop-down menu with a variety of 
dashboard size options.
Many sizing options are available for selection depending on your needs. Blog,  
iPad, Laptop, Desktop, Exactly, and Automatic are some of the typical settings.  
It will take some trial and error to properly size a dashboard for your needs.
It is important to consider the methods in which you will be publishing your 
dashboard. If you are publishing your dashboard to your blog, you need to make 
sure that it properly fits into the layout that you have selected.
Building a dashboard
In order to build a sample dashboard, which has a title, aggregate data, change over 
time, detailed data, and proper context, as shown at https://public.tableau.

Perform the following steps to build the dashboard:
1.	 Create a new dashboard by clicking on the dashboard creation icon in  
the filmstrip.
2.	 Name it CO2 Emissions Dashboard; the name is important because it will be 
part of the URL for the workbook.
3.	 Size the dashboard so that it fits a blog, as shown in the following screenshot. 
This size fits in a typical WordPress blog, and it is also narrower than most 
mobile devices and laptops. Therefore, the size will work well for users of 
multiple devices:
4.	 We added containers knowing that we wanted to have a title, aggregate data, 
supporting details, and conclusions. We added a vertical layout container 
so that our visualizations and objects will stack on top of each other. The 
following steps will guide you to add data-map in the layout container:
1.	 We dragged the aggregated data-map of CO2 Emissions per Capita 
into the vertical layout container.
2.	 We then dragged the next worksheet, Emissions Over Time, into the 
very bottom of the vertical layout container so that the worksheet and 
the map would be automatically sized.
3.	 We dragged the worksheet from the Dashboard pane to the bottom 
of the container and dropped it when we saw the wide gray border, 
as shown in the following screenshot:

5.	 We assessed that the dashboard shown in the following screenshot isn't 
pretty. It still needs a title, and it should be rearranged:
6.	 We added a title before rearranging it, by performing the following steps:
1.	 Drag a Text object to the very top of the vertical layout container 
above the map.
2.	 Populate the title (Carbon Dioxide Emissions by Country in 2008) 
and then format it in 18 pt black Arial, which is wide enough to fit in 
the screen.

7.	 The layout needs some work. Color legends need to move closer to their 
respective visualizations, and we need to change it so it can be fitted in some 
visualizations, as shown in the following screenshot:
8.	 Move the Percentile color legend for the map by performing the  
following steps:
1.	 Click on it to select it.
2.	 Click on its context menu.
3.	 Change it to floating.
9.	 Move it below the center of the map (we will move it again later).
10.	 We decided to remove the color legend for Region altogether.
11.	 Remove the size legend for Avg. Once we have actually used a bar in the 
heat map; you can check it out by clicking on it.
12.	 We removed the last color legend, which is for the heat map. The colors are 
used to indicate rank, and they follow the same color scheme as that of the 
map (brown is bad, and blue is good).
13.	 Adjust the fit of the containers as:
°°
The heat map needs to be fit differently. Therefore, click on its context 
menu, select Fit, and choose Fit Width.

[ 146 ]
14.	 Next, add titles by performing the following steps:
15.	 Add a text object above the line graph; the title should be highly descriptive. 
It tells our users exactly what they are looking at, and it also tells them how 
to get more details. We used 14 pt black Arial font for the main title, and the 
call to action (that is, the text that tells the user what to do) is in 10 pt gray 
Arial, as shown in the following screenshot:
You can also add an image above the line graph. We added an 
image of a simple gray line that we created in Microsoft Paint and 
then saved as a bitmap.
°°
We also added a floating title for the heat map because we had extra 
horizontal space but less vertical space. We used the same fonts as 
that of the previous title and added a light gray shade so that it's 
visually separated from the graph itself.
16.	 Add more context with tooltips and labels; it's important for users to know 
exactly what they are looking at, how the data points relate to each other, and 
how it relates to them. You can modify the tooltip for the map by performing 
the following steps:
1.	 Click on Map Visualization to select it.
2.	 Click on the Worksheet menu.
3.	 Select Tooltip.
4.	 Modify the contents and font so that they add obvious context and 
do not require users to do a lot of work to figure out what they are 
viewing, as shown in the following screenshot:
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 7
[ 147 ]
5.	 Repeat these steps for other visualizations. Make sure that you use 
the same font face and size in each tooltip. Consistency of design is 
critical.
6.	 Modify the data labels, particularly for the line graph.
7.	 Navigate to the worksheet, and place the appropriate fields on the 
Label shelf in case they were not there already.
17.	 Format dashboard so that the right emphasis is created.
Change their location relative to each other on the dashboard so that they are all 
legible by clicking on individual labels and then dragging them elsewhere.
We felt comfortable making custom placements because we do not have a  
filter on the dashboard. (We will discuss filters in the next chapter.) We are  
confident that, with a specific size of the dashboard, the labels will always  
appear where we placed them.
If you want to undo custom placements, you can right-click on the label and select 
undo the custom location, as shown in the following screenshot:
°°
Adjust the size of the dashboard to 540 x 900 pixels because it appears 
compressed. Unfortunately, this means that we'll have a vertical 
scroll bar when not using a studio monitor, but we needed to make 
sure that the visualizations were legible. It's better to have a vertical 
scroll bar than a cramped dashboard. If no one can read it, it's a waste 
of time and effort.

Summary
In this chapter, we discussed best practices of dashboard design as well as how to 
build an empathetically designed user experience that tells a concise story with data. 
You also learned that Tableau Public dashboards are composed of one or more sheets 
(chart visualizations) with added elements such as text, captions, and interactivity 
such as filters and actions. Dashboards may also contain, or open web pages and can 
pass dashboard information into the web page in some instances.
Keep in mind that a good dashboard design helps you convey a pertinent message 
to the reader. Have a goal in mind pertaining to what you wish to get across 
to the readers. Elements of a good dashboard design start with good data and 
visualizations, and these visualizations come together in an aesthetically pleasing, 
intuitive dashboard that helps users tease out conclusions and discoveries of their 
own. Knowing your audience is critical to dashboard design.
In the next chapter, we will explore filters and actions, which are important tools in 
adding interactivity to dashboards.

Filters and Actions
Dashboard filters and actions in Tableau Public enable users to precisely select the 
information that they would like to explore, which is powerful. Selecting what's 
interesting makes a data story personal and relevant to users; all of this is done 
without shifting their attention or their mouse away from the dashboard. Filters  
and actions create true interactivity. They also give you, as an author, the ability  
to connect disparate sources of data or web pages to complete user experience.
In this chapter, we will discuss the following topics:
•	
Adding and using Quick Filters
•	
Filtering the Data sources with parameters
•	
Filtering the Data sources with controller worksheets
•	
Highlighting actions
•	
Action Filters
•	
URL Actions
Adding and using Filters
Filters are designed to meet several needs of your users; the following are some of 
these needs:
•	
Limiting the scope of an analysis
•	
Allowing users to view only what interests them
•	
Removing outliers

Filters and Actions
[ 150 ]
Using a filter to limit the data that is extracted into your workbook improves the 
performance of the workbook. However, the following are the two disadvantages  
of using filters on dashboards:
•	
Using many filter actions with multiple Dimension members can slow down 
a dashboard's performance.
•	
Filters can be applied to only one data source at a time. So, in case multiple 
data sources are being used on one dashboard, you'll need to use parameters 
or controller worksheets to filter all of them.
In this chapter, we will use the dashboard that we created in the previous chapter. 
You can download the finished product by visiting https://public.tableau.com/
views/Chaper7-Dashboards/CO2EmissionsDashboard?:embed=y&:display_
count=yes&:showTabs=y. The dashboard uses only one data source at this point. As 
we progress through this chapter, we'll add another dashboard along with a fourth 
visualization.
Adding Filters to worksheets
In the dashboard that we are using, we have already filtered the map to show only the 
data for 2008, which is a blue pill on the Filters shelf, because it is a discrete number. 
You will also see that there are green pills for Latitude and Longitude. Both of these 
pills are continuous numbers, and they are included on the Filters shelf because we 
filtered out the null values, as shown in the following screenshot:
If a field is not already on the Filters shelf, you can drag it there from the Data 
window. Alternatively, you can create a Quick Filter by right-clicking on it in 
the Data window and selecting Show Quick Filter, as shown in the following 
screenshot. Tableau Public will then display the Quick Filter on the upper  
right-hand side of the workspace, but you can easily move it around the  
worksheet, as shown in the following screenshot:

For instance, if a field is a part of a visualization and it's on the Rows or Columns 
shelf, the Marks card, or anywhere else, you can click on its Context menu and  
select Filter.
There is a catch to adding filters. If a field is not on the Filters shelf of a worksheet, 
you won't be able to add it as a filter on the dashboard. In the following screenshot, 
we navigated to the worksheet in the workbook that has the map on it and added the 
filter there. In the next section of this chapter, we will go back to the dashboard and 
add the Quick Filter.
To add a Quick Filter for Region, perform the following steps:
1.	 Right-click on Region in the Data window.
2.	 Click on Show Quick Filter.
3.	 Then, it's time to make a selection. With a discrete field such as Region, you 
will see the dimension members that you can choose. The Filters dialog box 
is shown in the following screenshot:

4.	 In the General tab, we can perform the following operations, as shown in the 
preceding screenshot:
°°
Select from list (A): This uses either a custom list of values, or all  
the values.
°°
The search box (B): We can search for a text string that is present in a 
dimension member.
°°
Checkboxes (C): Click on the checkboxes next to the dimensions that 
we want to keep or exclude.
°°
The filter (D): This sets the filter to show fewer values, which 
means that it shows the values that are automatically limited by the 
selections of other filters, and it doesn't show all the discrete values in 
the field.
°°
All or None (E): You can select All or None, as required.
°°
Exclude (F): This excludes the values that we have selected. If you are 
excluding values, be careful when exposing the filter to users. They 
might need some extra instructions about what the exclusion means 
and how to use it.
°°
Summary (G): This shows a summary of your selection.
°°
Reset (H): This resets all values.
°°
OK, Cancel, and Apply (I): Click on Apply and then on the OK 
button to filter and set worksheet.
5.	 In our example, we selected all the values and then deselected Aggregates.
6.	 Then, we clicked on OK.
The pill for Region (which is blue because it's a discrete field) is now in the Filters 
shelf. When you go back to the dashboard, you can add it to the worksheet.
The other Filter tabs allow you to further specify the members that you want to 
retain or exclude in the analysis. You can perform the following operations:
1.	 Establish the conditions that need to be met
2.	 Use formulas to determine the members that you want to include
3.	 Include the top or bottom members by a certain metric
This works particularly well in graphs other than maps because users are often only 
concerned with the best and worst performers.

Adding Quick Filters to a dashboard
If your worksheet is already on the dashboard, the new filter will not appear there 
automatically. The dashboard is laid out in a vertical column for the most part, and 
we do not have filters on it. Its top looks like the following screenshot:
We want to add the Region Quick Filter to the dashboard and then apply it to 
the other worksheets on the dashboard. When we add a filter (or a legend) to a 
dashboard that we have arranged very specifically, Tableau Public will automatically 
add a vertical layout container on the far right. Don't be alarmed by this. You can 
move filters and legends to the locations you want them to be in.
If a field is already a part of a visualization that is on a dashboard because it is one 
of the fields that is being displayed on the Detail or Tooltip shelves, you can add 
it to the dashboard by clicking on the Context menu for the visualization and then 
selecting it from the list of the Quick Filter options.
In the next few exercises, we will discuss the following topics:
•	
Adding the Region Quick Filter to the dashboard
•	
Formatting it to be a drop-down list
•	
Setting it to show only the relevant values
•	
Applying it to all the worksheets on the dashboard
•	
Moving it so that it's in the same container as that of the title of the dashboard

In order to add and modify the Quick Filter, perform the following steps:
1.	 Select the map worksheet on the dashboard by either clicking on the ocean in 
the map, or selecting it from the list of worksheets in the Dashboard menu to 
the left of the dashboard.
2.	 Click on the Context menu.
3.	 Hover the pointer of the mouse over the Quick Filters and click on Region, 
as shown in the following screenshot:
4.	 The Region filter will appear in a Vertical Layout Container to the far right 
of the dashboard. We'll move it later. It's important to be mindful of unused 
white space.
5.	 Now, we will change the format of the quick filter. There are many options, 
and we want the most compact one, which is a multi-select drop-down 
list. Click on the Context menu of the filter and change it to show Multiple 
Values (Dropdown).
6.	 There are many other modifications that we can make by clicking on the 
Context menu of the filter. Click on the Context menu again.
7.	 Click on Only Relevant Values so that it shows only the Regions that meet 
the conditions of the other filters.
8.	 Apply it to the other worksheets on the dashboard that are using the same 
data source. From the Context menu, click on Apply to Worksheets.
9.	 In the Apply Filter to the Worksheets [Region] dialog box, click on All on 
Dashboard, as shown in the following screenshot, and then click on OK. 
Keep in mind that this only applies Quick Filters to worksheets using the 
same data source:

[ 155 ]
The other modifications that you can make from the Context menu of the filter  
and which add polish and specificity to your dashboard, are as follows:
•	
Applying Quick Filters to worksheets allows authors to select the sheets  
to which the filter applies, where all the worksheets are using the same  
data source
•	
Formatting Quick Filters gives authors control over the font faces and styles 
used in the title and the list of values
•	
Customizing Quick Filters can remove or show the All option
•	
Showing, hiding, or editing the title can prompt users to take action
•	
Changing the display of the filter, whether it's radio buttons for short lists  
or multiple value drop-down lists for longer lists, enables authors to select 
the best format for both the data and consumers
•	
Showing relevant values, also known as cascading filters, is a great way of 
simplifying the filtering experience for consumers so that selections in a filter 
determine the contents of another
Formatting the filter box so that it has a floating or fixed width is another feature that 
gives authors control over the appearance of worksheet.

Moving the Quick Filter
The quick filter is still present in the vertical container to the right that Tableau 
Public automatically created for it. If you have several Quick Filters and Legends, 
it's perfectly fine to leave them in the container. Just be conscious of how you are 
using white space.
We plan to add a parameter later, but for now, we want to put this quick filter next to 
the title for the dashboard. The title is in a horizontal layout container already, which 
means that we can put other objects next to it.
1.	 In order to drag the Quick Filter into the same horizontal layout container 
with the title, select the Quick Filter by clicking on it.
2.	 Hover the pointer of the mouse over the center of the Quick Filter. You can 
click on the area with the white hashes, which is outlined by a red box, as 
shown in the following screenshot:
3.	 When you get the white crosshair mouse, click on it and drag the filter into 
the horizontal layout container shared by the title for the dashboard. You will 
know that it is in the right place when the right border of the container has a 
shadow, as shown in following screenshot, and emphasized by the red box, 
as shown in the preceding screenshot:
4.	 Note that the Vertical Layout Container has disappeared on its own.
5.	 Change the filter values and see how the dashboard display changes.

Filtering across Data sources with 
parameters
Although the Quick Filter can be applied to the worksheets using its data source,  
it can't be applied to worksheets using other data sources. In order to filter multiple 
data sources with one list, we need either a reference table or a parameter.
While you can use parameters for many important functions, such as determining 
which worksheets appear on a dashboard, there are some disadvantages:
•	
Only one value can be selected at a time
•	
The list of values for static parameters, and they need to be maintained 
manually
•	
Parameters are related to the Data sources through the use of calculated 
fields, which can be complicated to maintain
In the next few exercises, we will accomplish several tasks via the creation of three 
parameters. We will create parameters that integrate with calculated fields to:
•	
Show a single year in one graph and a range of years in another graph
•	
Filter across multiple Data sources
•	
Allow users to select the detail that needs to be explored
There are a couple of key concepts about parameters that you should keep in mind 
as we go through this chapter:
1.	 Each parameter is unique to a workbook and not to a Data source.
You can copy parameters from one workbook 
to another without issues because they are not 
dependent on data sources.
2.	 Each parameter has a name, data type, format, and value.

Chapter 8
[ 159 ]
The first task that we need to accomplish by creating a parameter involves using a 
Year filter for the dashboard. Two of the visualizations, namely the map and the line 
graph, have a Time dimension. We want to create a filter from which users can select 
the year. When a user selects a year, the map will be filtered to show only that year, 
but the line graph will show five years on either side of dashboard.
In order to build this functionality, we will need to create three new elements.  
The descriptions of these elements are as follows:
•	
The Year parameter: This has a data type of INT and a range of values
•	
A Calculated field: This will be used as a filter on the map so that the year 
that we are showing in the map matches the selection from the parameter
•	
A Second Calculated field: This will be used as a filter on the line graph that 
allows five years on either side of the selected year
Let's create a Year parameter by performing the following steps:
1.	 Create a new parameter by clicking on the Context menu in the Data 
window or by right-clicking on the white space in the Data window and 
selecting Create Parameter.
2.	 Give the parameter a name that represents what you want users to do. 
Ensure that the name does not match any of the field names in your data 
source. Otherwise, this will cause issues.
3.	 We named our parameter Select a Year.
4.	 Select the data type of the parameter. When you are using a parameter in a 
Calculated field, you can convert it to different types. We want ours to be a 
string because Year is a string field in the Data source.
5.	 If we had selected a different type of field, we would have had to format it 
accordingly. One of the reasons why we left it as a string is that we won't be 
running the risk of displaying improperly formatted values.

6.	 Select List for the Allowable values, as shown in the following screenshot:
7.	 You have the option of populating the list from your own list of values  
or from one of the fields in either of the two Data sources.
The parameter lists are not updated dynamically from 
the fields.
8.	 Click on the Add from Field button and then select the Year field.
You only see fields of the same data type as a 
parameter. If there were multiple data sources in the 
workbook, you would see the others as well.

9.	 Now, the list of values matches that of the source field from the Data 
source. But from the bottom of the list of values, remove the years after 2008 
because the data collected for these years is not complete. You can do this by 
hovering the pointer of the mouse over the row and clicking on the X that 
appears to the right of a values, as shown in the following screenshot:
10.	 Also, keep in mind that Tableau is case-sensitive, which means that the 
contents of the parameter list must match the contents of the field list.
11.	 The final parameter has been set to a default of 2008, as shown in the 
following screenshot:
12.	 Now, click on OK.

Using parameters as Filters
You now have a parameter that you can use to filter certain fields. In the following 
steps, we will create two new calculated fields—the first will filter the map to show 
only the Year selected, and the second will filter the line graph to show five years on 
either side of the Year selected:
1.	 On the map's worksheet, the first task is to create a new Calculated field 
called Map Year Filter.
2.	 The formula is simple; it is Boolean expression, and it tells Tableau Public 
that we want only the Year values that map the parameter selection, as 
shown in the following screenshot:
3.	 Remove the filter on the Year field, which is a blue pill on the Filters shelf.
4.	 Drag this new field from the Dimensions pane to the Filters shelf and  
select True.
5.	 Apply this filter to the Region KPIs worksheet.
6.	 Right-click on the Select a Year parameter, which is below the Measures in 
the Data window, and show the parameter control.
Next, we will create a Calculated field for the line graph that filters to show five 
years on either side of the parameter.

Chapter 8
[ 163 ]
Open the worksheet with the line graph, perform the following steps to create a 
Calculated field:
1.	 Create a new Calculated field and name it Year +-.
2.	 In the following screenshot, we used a formula to convert both the parameter 
and field to integers so that we can perform mathematical functions on them. 
If you want to, you can create another parameter to allow users to input the 
number of years that they would like to see on either side and then replace 
the instances of 5 with it:
3.	 Click on OK.
4.	 Add this new field from the Measures pane to the Filters shelf and select True.
Now, we will return to the dashboard and continue making modifications. 
The first thing that we want to do is show the parameter.
5.	 From the Context menu for the map worksheets on the dashboard, click on 
Parameters and then click on the Select a Year parameter.
6.	 The parameter automatically appears next to the Region Quick Filter. 
It would look better if the two were stacked. So, add a Vertical Layout 
Container to the Horizontal Container with the header and filter, and then 
move the Filter and parameter into it.
7.	 Add an extra 100 pixels of height to the dashboard.

Modifying titles
We can modify the header of the dashboard to reflect the selection of a year as 
well. The title is hard-coded to identify CO2 emissions from 2008, but if we select a 
different year from the parameter, such as 2005, then we need to ensure that the title 
is updated.
We can add the parameter to the title by performing the following steps:
1.	 Double-click on the title.
2.	 Delete the hard-coded reference to 2008.
3.	 Click on the Insert button.
4.	 Select the parameter that we want to add, as shown in the following 
screenshot:
Since this title is actually a text object on the dashboard and not a specific worksheet 
title, we cannot insert field values, but we can insert parameters. It's always a good 
idea to make it very obvious what your user is looking at so that they don't run the 
risk of assuming the wrong thing.
Filtering across multiple Data sources with 
parameters
Parameters are useful when you need to filter across multiple Data sources. We loaded 
a second Data source, which contains data related to the foreign aid given to various 
countries by the United States since 1948, into our workbook. There are several fields 
that have the same name, namely Region, Country, and Year. We created a simple 
bar graph that shows the total aid in dollars over a period of time on a new worksheet 
called Aid Graph.
www.it-ebooks.info
WWW.EBOOK777.COM

free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 8
[ 165 ]
We created a filtering field for this visualization that shows only the Year selected 
in the parameter and the 30 years before it. In this case, we're using the same Year 
parameter that is being displayed on the dashboard. We also created a Calculated 
field, referencing it in the Foreign Aid Data sources, and then added it to the 
Filters shelf, just like we did on the map and line graph, as shown in the following 
screenshot:
We will create a new parameter that allows users to select the visualization that they 
wish to view in the third of the last workbook, which is where we show granular 
details. Currently, the Region KPIs worksheet is displayed there, but we would like 
to provide users with the option of deciding what to see in the workbook.
In order to do this, we will create a new parameter. Then, we will create a Calculated 
field that can be used as a filter in each Data sources.
Let's create a parameter by performing the following steps:
1.	 Create a new parameter and name it Select Granular Details, which is a 
string with a list of two possible values.
2.	 We have capitalized these two values carefully because Tableau Public is 
case-sensitive. We will include following values in a Calculated field in the 
next step. The values are shown in the following screenshot:

3.	 Click on OK.
4.	 In the Foreign Aid Data source, create a new Calculated field. This field 
will use a case statement to create a string output based on the parameter's 
selection.

Chapter 8
[ 167 ]
5.	 We named the field Granular Selection Filter, and we wrote a case statement 
that states that if Region Emission KPIs is selected, then the output is 
emissions; otherwise, it's Foreign Aid. If there were more than two values, 
then we would have another condition, as shown in the following screenshot:
6.	 Click on OK.
7.	 Add the Granular Selection Filter field to the Filters shelf of the Aid Graph.
8.	 The string value that corresponds to the current value of the parameter will 
be displayed in the Filter list. Select it and click on OK.
9.	 Select Show Parameter Control and select the other value. The graph should 
now appear.
10.	 Right-click on the Granular Selection Filter field and select Copy. We'll paste 
it exactly as is into the Data source that contains the other worksheet on that 
we want to work.
11.	 Go to the Region KPIs worksheet. In the Dimensions pane, right-click  
on it and select Paste. The field that you just created now exists in both the 
data sources.
12.	 Right-click on the Select Granular Details parameter and select Show 
Parameter Control. You have to do this on every sheet on which you'd  
like to see it.
13.	 Ensure that the value selected corresponds to the graph that you're viewing.

14.	 Drag the Granular Selection Filter field to the Filters shelf and select 
emissions, as shown in the following screenshot:
15.	 Click on OK.
Now, we can go back to the dashboard and add the parameter and the new 
visualization.
We will stack the visualizations into a Vertical Layout Container, and we will hide 
the title of each so that no space is unnecessarily taken up when it isn't selected. 
Then, we will modify the space in the title names of account for the parameter 
selection by performing the following steps:
1.	 First, add a Vertical Layout Container to the bottom of the dashboard and 
add the Region KPIs and Aid Dollars worksheets into it.
2.	 When you do this, the the parameters that appear in these worksheets will be 
added to the container with the filter and parameter at the top.
3.	 Add a Horizontal Layout Container within the new Vertical Layout 
Container.
4.	 Change the title for this area so that it is not floating and drag it into the 
Horizontal Layout Container.
5.	 Drag the parameter from the top into the Horizontal Layout Container  
as well.
6.	 Modify the text for the title so that it represents exactly what we can see in 
the following screenshot:

[ 169 ]
7.	 Right-click on the title for the Aid Graph and hide it.
8.	 Note that when you change the parameter value, both the title and the 
visualization change.
9.	 If you're having issues with the visualizations changing properly, the 
first thing that you need to check is the capitalization and spelling in the 
case statement. It's fairly common to make mistakes when writing these 
statements. Therefore, you should check them to ensure that you have 
written conditions that match the parameter values perfectly:
Actions
There are three types of actions that you can create on dashboards to add context, 
relevance, and specificity for your users, namely Highlight, Filter, and URL.
The following list describes these three action types:
•	
Highlight actions: These draw attention to marks related to selections in a 
visualization without filtering other data points on the visualization.
•	
Filter actions: These show only the selections made in a source visualization. 
They can be set up in such a way that when the marks in the source sheet are 
deselected, the target visualization shows all the marks, shows the filtered 
marks, or excludes all the marks.
•	
URL actions: These allow you to link to generic URLs or dynamically add 
selected field values into URLs to link Tableau Public dashboards to external 
resources. As an example, we'll show you how to insert a country's name into 
a URL to directly link to its page on the World Bank's website.

Filters and Actions
[ 170 ]
Highlight actions do not filter visualizations, they only draw attention. URL actions 
link to external websites. Therefore, they don't have implications in dashboard 
performance. Filter actions have the following benefits:
•	
They are comparably faster than Quick Filters. Tableau Public does not need 
to scan the contents of a field before they can function.
•	
They can filter across multiple data sources without setting up join 
conditions ahead of time, which will be explored later on in this chapter.
•	
They allow users to select and view only the granular data that's important  
to them.
Actions have a disadvantage. For a novice author, maintaining actions can be  
time-consuming. The actions that we will use in the following exercises are designed 
to allow users to filter all the visualizations to show only the countries that interest 
them. Then, we'll add a URL action that links to the World Bank's web page for every 
individual country.
In the dashboard, we have a map that shows every country for which we have data. 
We have filters for time and other geographic dimensions. Therefore, we have an 
opportunity to do the following two things with the countries:
•	
We can create a filter action that limits the selections in other worksheets to 
the countries that a user has selected
•	
We can create a URL action that allows a user to see the World Bank's web 
page for each country
The first task involves creating the Filter action that runs when a user selects a 
country from the map by performing the following steps:
1.	 On the dashboard, click on the Dashboard menu and then click on Actions.
2.	 Click on Add Action, and then click on Filter.
3.	 Name the action Filter on Country. It's important to name actions according 
to their functions so that when you are editing and testing them later, you 
know where to look first.

4.	 For the source, select the CO2 Emissions per Capita sheet on the dashboard.
5.	 Run the action on Select. Thus, when a user clicks on a field, its correlated 
marks in the target sheet will be highlighted. The alternatives are running 
the action when a user hovers over a mark or showing a hyperlink to run the 
action when a user rolls over Menu. We will use Menu for the URL action.
6.	 Target all the sheets on the dashboard except for the CO2 Emissions per 
Capita sheet.
7.	 Leave the default values to clear the selection. If we had worksheets that we 
wanted to hide until someone made a selection, which is a great option, we 
would have excluded all values.
8.	 Next, we need to establish the fields on which we want the filter to run. 
When a user clicks on a country, the value for that country is used as a filter 
for other sheets.
In case you left the setting on All Fields, then all the attributes of the mark 
will be passed as a filter, but only to fields of the same name. For example, if 
you were going through the values for region and country, then each sheet 
with those exact same field names and values would be filtered.
Since we have a secondary Data source, specifically the Foreign Aid data, 
that does not have the same field name for each country (though the values 
are the same) and has completely different values for the Region field, we 
need to establish targets.
9.	 Click on the Selected Fields radio button. Though using specific fields can 
potentially cause the dashboard to run more slowly with very large data sets, 
we need to establish the fields on which we need to join the Data sources.

10.	 Click on Add Filter. Since the action is running from a sheet using the World 
Bank Climate Change data source, it is the default for the source. Pick the 
Country Name field. Then, for the target, select the same Data source and 
field. This tells Tableau Public that for sheets that use this Data source, use 
the Country Name field as both the source and target. Check out the result in 
the following screenshot:
11.	 Click on OK.
12.	 Click on Add filter again. Select the Country Name field again as the source, 
but for the target, select the Foreign Aid Data sources and then select the 
Country field as the target.

If we were to add additional visualizations to this dashboard, they 
automatically would become targets of the actions that we have 
established. For this reason, it's wise to wait until you have added 
everything of interest to the dashboard before creating actions.
URL actions
URL actions are useful when you wish to connect users to external and auxiliary 
data, whether it's from a public interest website or to a related dashboard. In the next 
example, you will create a URL action that allows users to view the World Bank's 
website for each country.
The URL action that you will build will append the name of each country as a 
variable to the root URL for the World Bank's well-organized websites.
The root URL is http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/, and in order to get to 
a specific country, such as South Africa, you need to add the country name so that it 
looks like http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/southafrica.
There is one issue—there are no spaces in the country names in the URL and yet, 
there are spaces in the country names in the data source.
So first, create a Calculated field that removes the space in each Country name so 
that we can append it as a token to the URL.

To remove and append the Country name with a URL, perform the following steps:
1.	 Go to the Map worksheet and create a Calculated field in the Data source.
2.	 Name the Calculated field CountryName.
3.	 In the Calculated field, write a formula that uses the Replace function to 
remove the spaces in the Country field, as shown in the following screenshot. 
You need to remove the spaces because in the URL, for each country, there 
are no spaces. Different websites treat spaces differently, depending on their 
information management strategy and encoding; others might replace spaces 
with %20:
4.	 Add this field to the Detail shelf on the sheet.
5.	 Note that the percentile table calculation that generates the color for each 
country no longer seems to work because it was addressing only by Country 
Name before and it wasn't partitioned (or grouped) by any other values.
6.	 In order to solve this problem, click on the context menu for the field on the 
Color shelf.

13.	 Name the URL action with the text that will prompt users to perform a 
specific action, such as Click on Here for Country Data. You want the result 
to be very obvious because this action will be a Menu action, which means 
that the name of the action will appear as a call to an action at the bottom of 
the tooltip, as shown in the following screenshot:
14.	 Select CO2 Emissions per Capita as the source sheet.
15.	 Run the action on Menu.
16.	 Paste the root URL for the World Bank into the URL box. Then, click on the

Summary
In this chapter, you learned how to use Quick Filters and Dashboard Actions not 
only to provide greater interactivity for users, but also to provide an efficient user 
experience. You also learned how to create parameters to filter single and multiple 
data sources, as well as to govern the visualizations that appear on a dashboard. You 
studied the implications in dashboard performance when using different methods of 
filtering, all of which will give your dashboard users a greater control over the data 
points that they choose to explore. It will also create a more personal, relevant, and 
compelling data story.
In the next chapter, we will discuss publishing your work, which is the last step to 
creating and distributing your work in Tableau Public.

Publishing Your Work
Publishing your work on the Cloud with Tableau Public is the core of the 
application's value proposition, and with Tableau Public 9.0, it's easy to save and 
share your work. There's more to publishing than just locating a file on a web server. 
Publishing your work and managing your author and workbook profiles is the best 
way of helping people browse through your visualizations to create more personal 
connections with your data story. When people are personally connected and relate 
to you and your work as a human, they are more likely to share it.
In this section, we'll discuss the following topics:
•	
Saving your work and logging in to Tableau Public
•	
Opening your work from the Cloud on your computer
•	
Managing your profile
•	
Viewing your work online
•	
Sharing your work with others
•	
Managing workbook details
Saving your work and logging in to 
Tableau Public
Since Tableau Public does not have autosave, we recommend that you save to the 
Cloud frequently.

In the File menu, you can save your work by clicking on the Save to Tableau 
Public... option, which is present halfway down the list. Alternatively, you can use 
the same shortcut keys that other applications use (Ctrl + S):
Once you opt to save your work, you will need to sign in to Tableau Public. Use the 
same credentials that you used to download Tableau Public initially, as shown in the 
following screenshot:
Once you have signed in successfully, you can save your work on the Cloud with a 
name of your choice.

Giving your analysis a good name is critical. First, it's the title that other people 
will see when they look at your profile on Tableau Public. Also, the name of the 
workbook and individual dashboards are a part of the URL of the file. It's important 
not to include special characters, such as ampersands, question marks, and periods, 
because they can disrupt the format of the URL. It's fine to include numbers though. 
You can name your workbook as shown in following screenshot:
If you want to replace an existing file with the one that you have opened now, you 
can perform the following steps:
1.	 Select Save to Tableau Public As... from the File menu.
2.	 From the dropdown list of the existing files, select the file that you want to 
overwrite.
3.	 Click on Save.
Opening work from the Cloud
If you'd like to make changes to your work, you need to perform the following steps:
1.	 Open Tableau Public on your computer.
2.	 Navigate to the Tableau Public home screen.
3.	 Click on the orange Open from Tableau Public link on the upper-right 
corner.
4.	 Log in with the credentials that you used to create your account, which was 
covered previously in this chapter.

Managing your profile
In order to view your work on the Internet, you need to go to Tableau Public's 
website and log in. From there, you can share your work with others, download it, 
promote it on social media, and also delete it, should the need arise.
1.	 On your Internet browser, go to http://public.tableau.com.
2.	 In the upper-right corner, click on SIGN IN, as shown in the following 
screenshot:
3.	 Enter the credentials that you used to create your account.

The destination page that you reach when you login is your profile page. This is 
where all the dashboards that you created are organized. It is also a great place 
for you to add information about yourself. You can add links to your Twitter and 
LinkedIn accounts as well as the blogs or corporate websites that you would like to 
promote. (It's important to make sure that you have the permission before presenting 
URLs of organizations of which you're not an associate).
My profile is shown in the following screenshot:
You can change settings related to specific workbooks by hovering over them.  
As your catalogue of work grows, you should curate it by being selective about 
which visualizations are featured.
When you roll over any of the thumbnails for a specific visualization, you can do 
several things; the following are a few of these things:
1.	 First, on the upper right-hand side, select MAKE FEATURED to make it  
the featured visualization, which will move it to the upper-most left spot  
on your profile.
2.	 On the upper right-hand side, you can change the visibility settings.

This does not prevent people from searching for your visualization, 
and you also cannot control the permissions regarding who can see it.
3.	 On the lower right-hand side, you can delete workbooks. This is a good idea 
in case you would like to delete the earlier iterations of a finished product, 
but keep in mind that you don't have the file saved on your computer. So, be 
judicious when using the Delete button.
4.	 On the lower right-hand side, you will see the workbook name and the 
number of views that it has.
A view is each visit to the page by a browser. So, if you go to the 
workbook five times a day, that's five views. Note that this is not the 
number of unique visitors.
5.	 Then, above the workbook name, you can download the workbook.
6.	 At the center, you have the View option in case you wish to view the 
workbook, as shown in the following screenshot:
Viewing your work online
When you view a workbook, you have several options at the top of the page.

From left to right, you can perform the following tasks:
•	
Go back to your profile
•	
Keep on clicking and go through other workbooks
•	
Edit the details of the workbook that you have opened
•	
Download the workbook, as shown in following screenshot:
If you scroll to the bottom of the dashboard, you have the following additional 
controls:
1.	 Undo, Redo, and Reset any changes that you have made. For instance, if you 
have filtered your workbook and want to revert to the original state, just click 
on the Reset button.
2.	 Share your work in the following way:
°°
You can share the Current View, which includes filter conditions or 
parameter selections. Alternatively, you can share the Original View.
°°
Embed Code allows you to copy an automatically generated block of 
HTML that you can use to embed the visualization on another web 
page. This code identifies the viewing attributes of your workbook, 
such as whether the toolbars are showing, the height and width 
of the workbook, and its title. For instance, if you want to embed 
the dashboard on your blog, you just need to copy the code. Then, 
in the management console of your blog, either insert the code 
directly, or create and then insert a snippet of HTML. If you have the 
capabilities, you can utilize Tableau Public's JavaScript API to embed 
the visualization in a webpage and then allow users to interact with it 
through web objects that are native to the source page. That's beyond 
the scope of this chapter though.

°°
To share the workbook with others, you can copy the link as well as 
simply highlight and copy the text and then paste it into a new e-mail 
in the tool of your choice.
°°
You also can share the workbook on Twitter or Facebook by clicking 
on either of the two buttons that open a pop-up on your browser 
and ask you to enter your credentials for the medium that you have 
selected, as shown in the following screenshot:
When you share your work via Twitter or Facebook, the description that you enter 
in the workbook details will automatically be populated, as shown in following 
screenshot. You can always change the description and remove the via @tableau 
string, but it's much more likely that people will find your tweet if you leave that tag:

Managing workbook details
The information that you provide about your work is important; it's the first part 
of the story that you're telling that people will take in. The workbook name is 
important, and so is the description and additional links.
If you scroll down the page past the Share button, you will see the workbook title  
as well as a link that allows you to edit the workbook details, as shown in the 
following screenshot:
Now, perform the following steps:
1.	 Make sure that the Title of the workbook says exactly what you want to 
appear on your profile.
2.	 Add a Permalink. Though this isn't required, it's a good way to promote 
your blog.
3.	 Enter a good description in the Description. This is the text that search 
engines will index. Also, if you want people to tweet your work, then you 
need to enter a description that's 82 characters or less, because the link that 
Tableau generates for your workbook will consist of 62 characters.
4.	 Toolbar Settings typically include control buttons as well as a link to your 
author profile. If you choose not to include those, then the HTML generated 
to embed your work will be adjusted.
5.	 An additional setting that you can adjust is Show workbook sheets as tabs. 
If all the worksheets in your workbook are on your dashboard and you have 
hidden them, then you don't need to select this.

Summary
In this chapter, you learned how to save your work to the Web as well as how to 
manage your Tableau Public profile and workbook attributes to help you showcase 
and share your work effectively.
This chapter concludes our discussion of creating data stories in Tableau Public. 
Throughout the previous eight chapters, we progressed through the basics of 
the tool, data analysis, and different visualization types, all the way through 
sophisticated calculations and parameters. You now have the skills to create rich, 
relevant, and compelling data stories from which others can learn, get inspired, and 
find the information that they need to improve their own lives and those of others.

About Packt Publishing
Packt, pronounced 'packed', published its first book, Mastering phpMyAdmin for Effective 
MySQL Management, in April 2004, and subsequently continued to specialize in publishing 
highly focused books on specific technologies and solutions.
Our books and publications share the experiences of your fellow IT professionals in adapting 
and customizing today's systems, applications, and frameworks. Our solution-based books 
give you the knowledge and power to customize the software and technologies you're using 
to get the job done. Packt books are more specific and less general than the IT books you have 
seen in the past. Our unique business model allows us to bring you more focused information, 
giving you more of what you need to know, and less of what you don't.
Packt is a modern yet unique publishing company that focuses on producing quality,  
cutting-edge books for communities of developers, administrators, and newbies alike.  
For more information, please visit our website at www.packtpub.com.
Writing for Packt
We welcome all inquiries from people who are interested in authoring. Book proposals should 
be sent to author@packtpub.com. If your book idea is still at an early stage and you would 
like to discuss it first before writing a formal book proposal, then please contact us; one of our 
commissioning editors will get in touch with you. 
We're not just looking for published authors; if you have strong technical skills but no writing 
experience, our experienced editors can help you develop a writing career, or simply get some 
additional reward for your expertise.
