Important Things to Remember in Linux
• Linux has super-user account called root
• root is the most powerful account that can create, modify, delete 
accounts and make changes to system configuration files
• Linux is case-sensitive system
• ABC is NOT same as abc
• Avoid using spaces when creating files and directories
• Linux kernel is not an operating system.  It is a small software within Linux 
operating system that takes commands from users and pass them to system 
hardware or peripherals
• Linux is mostly CLI not GUI
• Linux is very flexible as compared to other operating systems.

There are 2 types of access
1.
Console
2.
Remote
The console is a direct access to an operating system when it is 
connected through VGA, HDMI, DVI etc.

The 2nd type of access is remote where you connect to your operating system 
remotely over the network 
RDP
Sharing
Putty
Client
Linux to Linux
SSH 192.168.1.5

Important:
Windows 10 or newer version
SSH built-in client
ssh 192.168.1.5

Download and Install Putty
By: Imran Afzal

If you are using Windows 10 or newer version 
then you do NOT have to download or install Putty

Putty is a software which allows you to connect from a Windows system to 
Linux system remotely
192.168.1.5

Access to Linux from MAC
By: Imran Afzal
• Open a terminal on your MAC
• Run the following command
• # ssh –l iafzal 192.168.1.5

By: Imran Afzal
Access Linux via Putty or SSH

Linux
ssh 192.168.1.5
ssh –l iafzal 192.168.1.5

•
The newer version of CentOS might not have the ifconfig command, therefore, use 
“ip addr” command instead
•
To use ifconfig in 7.5 or later version then run = “yum install net-tools”

Introduction to Filesystem

By: Imran Afzal
www.utclisolutions.com
• Operating system stores files and directories in an organized and 
structured way
• System configuration file = Folder A
• User files = Folder B
• Log files = Folder C
• Commands or scripts = Folder D and so on
• There are many different types of filesystems.  In general, improvements 
have been made to filesystems with new releases of operating systems and 
each new filesystem has been given a different name
• e.g. ext3, ext4, xfs, NTFS, FAT etc.

File System Structure
By: Imran Afzal
www.utclisolutions.com

File System Structure and its Description
/boot
Contains file that is used by the boot loader (grub.cfg)
/root
root user home directory.  It is not same as /
/dev
System devices (e.g. disk, cdrom, speakers, flashdrive, keyboard etc.)
/etc
Configuration files
/bin /usr/bin
Everyday user commands
/sbin /usr/sbin
System/filesystem commands
/opt
Optional add-on applications (Not part of OS apps)
/proc
Running processes (Only exist in Memory)
/lib usr/lib
C programming library files needed by commands and apps
strace -e open pwd
/tmp
Directory for temporary files
/home
Directory for user
/var
System logs
/run
System daemons that start very early (e.g. systemd and udev) to store
temporary runtime files like PID files
/mnt
To mount external filesystem. (e.g. NFS)
/media
For cdrom mounts.

Navigating File System
• When navigating a UNIX filesystem, there are a few important commands:
"cd”
"pwd”
"ls“
• "cd" stands for change directory.  It is the primary command for moving you around the filesystem.
• “pwd” stands for print working directory.  It tells you where you current location is.
• “ls” stands for list.  It lists all the directories/files within a current working directory
• Using of TAB key to auto-complete

The second column is the number of hard links to the file. For a 
directory, the number of hard links is the number of immediate 
subdirectories it has plus its parent directory and itself

Linux File Types
By: Imran Afzal

What is Root?
• There are 3 types of root on Linux system
1.
Root account:  root is an account or a username on Linux machine and it is the 
most powerful account which has access to all commands and files
2.
Root as /:  the very first directory in Linux is also referred as root directory
3.
Root home directory:  the root user account also has a directory located in 
/root which is called root home directory

Changing Password
• You should change your initial password as soon as you login
Command = passwd userid
Old password: - enter your current password 
New password: - enter your new password 
Retype new password: - re-enter your new password 
By: Imran Afzal

File System Paths
• There are two paths to navigate to a filesystem
Absolute Path
Relative Path
• An absolute path always begins with a "/".  This indicates that the path starts at the root directory.  An 
example of an absolute path is 
cd /var/log/httpd
• A relative path does not begin with a "/".  It identifies a location relative to your current position. An 
example of a relative path is:
cd /var
cd log
cd httpd

Creating Files and Directories
• Creating Files
touch
cp
vi 
• Creating Directories
mkdir
By: Imran Afzal

Copying Directories
• Command to copy a directory
• cp
• To copy a directory on Linux, you have to execute the “cp” command with the “-R” 
option for recursive and specify the source and destination directories to be copied
• cp -R <source_folder> <destination_folder>

Find Files and Directories
•Two main commands are used to find 
files/directories
•find
•locate
By: Imran Afzal

By: Imran Afzal
Difference Between find and locate 
• locate uses a prebuilt database, which should be regularly 
updated, while find iterates over a filesystem to locate files. 
Thus, locate is much faster than find , but can be inaccurate 
if the database (can be seen as a cache) is not updated
• To update locate database run updatedb

WildCards
•A wildcard is a character that can be used as a 
substitute for any of a class of characters in a 
search
• * - represents zero or more characters
• ? - represents a single character
• [] - represents a range of characters
By: Imran Afzal

Soft and Hard Links
• inode = Pointer or number of a file on the hard disk
• Soft Link = Link will be removed if file is removed or renamed
• Hard Link = Deleting renaming or moving the original file will not affect the 
hard link 
• ln 
• ln -s
