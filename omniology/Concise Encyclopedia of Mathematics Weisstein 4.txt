Quartic 
Curve 
A general 
plane 
quartic 
curve is a curve of the form 
Ax4 + By4 + Cx3y + Dx2y2 
+ Ezy3 
+ Fx3 + Gg3 
+Hx2y+Izy2+Jx2+Ky2+Lxy+Mx+Ny+O=0.

The 
incidence 
relations 
of the 28 bitangents 
of the gen- 
eral quartic 
curve 
can be put 
into 
a ONE-TO-ONE 
cor- 
respondence 
with 
the vertices 
of a particular 
POLYTOPE 
in 7-D space (Coxeter 
1928, Du Val 1931). 
This 
fact is 
essentially 
similar 
to the discovery 
by Schoutte 
(1910) 
that 
the 27 SOLOMON'S 
SEAL LINES 
on a CUBIC 
SUR- 
FACE can’be 
connected 
with 
a POLYTOPE 
in 6-D space 
(Du Val 1931). 
A similar 
but less complete 
relation 
ex- 
ists between 
the tritangent 
planes 
of the canonical 
curve 
of genus 4 and an 8-D POLYTOPE 
(Du Val 1931). 
The maximum 
number 
of DOUBLE 
POINTS 
for a 
generate 
quartic 
curve is three.

(Smith

The

from 
the general

The

Q2 for those u such that 
q2 = 4(u - #u2

(3% 
where use has been made 
of

so (15) becomes 
(17) 
Xl

+x4 
=

(34) 
(which 
follows 
since a3 = 0), and

The quater-

known 
as HYPERCOMPLEX

and 
denoted 
IHE. While 
the quaternions 
are

The quaternions 
3~1, 43, &j, 
and MC form a non-Abelian 
GROUP 
of order 
eight 
(with 
multiplication 
as the group 
operation) 
known 
as Qs. 
The 
quaternions 
can be written 
in the form 
(Note 
that 
here, U is used to denote 
the IDENTITY 
MA- 
TRIX, 
not 
I.) 
The 
matrices 
are closely 
related 
to the 
PAULI 
SPIN 
MATRICES 
ox, uY, gz, combined 
with 
the 
IDENTITY 
MATRIX. 
From 
the 
above 
definitions, 
it fol- 
lows that 
a = al 
+a2i+a3j+ 
a4k. 
(19) 
The 
conjugate 
quaternion 
is given 
by 
a*

I2 = -u

K2 = -U.

The 
sum of two quaternions 
is then 
a+b 
= (al+bl)+(a2+b2)i+(a3+b3)j+(a4+b4)k, 
(21) 
Therefore 
I, J, and K are three 
essentially 
different 
so- 
lutions 
of the matrix 
equation 
and the product 
of two quaternions 
is 
ab = (albl

be considered

Queens Problem 
1495 
In fact, 
the product 
of two quaternion 
norms 
immedi- 
ately 
gives the EULER 
FOUR-SQUARE 
IDENTITY. 
A rotation 
about 
the UNIT VECTOR fi by an angle 
8 can 
be computing 
using 
the quaternion 
q = (s,v) 
= (cos(@),Csin($)) 
(28) 
(Arvo 
1994, Hearn 
and Baker 
1996). 
The components 
of 
this 
quaternion 
are called 
EULER PARAMETERS. After 
rotation, 
a point 
p = (0, p) is then 
given 
by 
P’ 
= 
qpq-l 
= 
qpq’, 
(29) 
since n(q) 
= 1. A concatenation 
of two rotations, 
first 
~1 and then 
q2, can be computed 
using 
the identity 
qa(q1Pqf)d 
= (QZQl)P(&~) 
= kwldPhld*

(Goldstein 
1980).

Queens 
Problem 
What 
is the maximum 
number 
of queens 
which 
can be 
placed 
on an TX x n CHESSBOARD such that 
no two attack 
one another? 
The 
answer is n queens, 
which 
gives eight 
queens 
for the usual 
8 x 8 board 
(Madachy 
1979). 
The 
number 
of different 
ways the n queens 
can be placed 
on 
an n x n chessboard 
so that 
no two queens 
may attack 
each other 
for the first few n are 1, 0, 0, 2, 10, 4, 40, 92, 
. . . (Sloane’s 
AOOOl70, 
Madachy 
1979). 
The 
number 
of 
rotationally 
and reflectively 
distinct 
solutions 
are 1, 0, 
0, 1, 2, 1, 6, 12, 46, 92, . l . (Sloane’s 
AO02562; 
Dudeney 
1970; 
p. 96). 
The 
12 distinct 
solutions 
for n = 8 are 
illustrated 
above, 
and the 
remaining 
80 are generated 
by ROTATION and REFLECTION (Madachy 
1979).

The

(1970, 
pp* 95-96) 
gave the following 
results 
for the number 
of 
distinct 
arrangements 
IV& 
n) of 1Tc queens 
attacking 
or

of an n x n board

Vardi 
(1991) 
generalizes 
the 
problem 
from 
a square 
chessboard 
to one with 
the topology 
of the TORUS. 
The 
number 
of solutions 
for n queens 
with 
n ODD 
are 1, 0, 
10, 28, 0, 88, . . . (Sloane’s 
AOO7705). 
Vardi 
(1991) 
also 
considers 
the toroidal 
“semiqueens” 
problem, 
in which 
a semiqueen 
can move 
like a rook 
or bishop, 
but only on 
POSITIVE 
broken 
diagonals. 
The 
number 
of solutions 
to 
this problem 
for n queens 
with 
n ODD 
are 1, 3, 15, 133, 
2025, 
37851,... 
(Sloane’s 
AO06717), 
and 0 for EVEN 
n. 
Chow 
and 
Velucchi 
give 
the 
solution 
to the 
question, 
“How 
many 
different 
arrangements 
of k queens 
are pos- 
sible on an order

Quicksort 
The 
fastest 
known 
SORTING 
ALGORITHM 
(on average, 
and for a large number 
of elements), 
requiring 
O(n lg n) 
steps. 
Q . k 
t 
UIC sor 
is a recursive 
algorithm 
which 
first 
partitions 
an array 
{ui}FE1 
according 
to several 
rules 
(Sedgewick 
1978) : 
Some 
key v is in its final 
position 
in the array 
(i.e., 
if it is the jth 
smallest, 
it is in position 
aj)* 
All the elements 
to the left of aj are less than or equal 
to aj. 
The 
elements 
al, 
~2, . . . , aj-1 
are called 
the 
“left 
subfile.” 
All 
the elements 
to the right 
of aj are greater 
than 
or equal 
t0 
Ujm 
The elements 
aj+l, 
. . . , a, are called 
the “right 
subfile Y’ 
Quicksort 
was invented 
by 
Hoare 
(1961, 
1962), 
has 
undergone 
extensive 
analysis 
and 
scrutiny 
(Sedgewick 
1975, 
1977, 
1978), 
and 
is known 
to be about 
twice 
as 
fast as the next fastest 
SORTING 
algorithm. 
In the worst 
case, however, 
quicksort 
is a slow n2 algorithm 
(and for 
quicksort, 
“worst 
case” corresponds 
to already 
sorted).

Quintic

A quintic

is an ALGEBRAIC SURFACE of degree 
5. Togliatti 
(1940, 
1949) 
showed 
that 
quintic 
surfaces 
having 
31 ORDINARY DOUBLE POINTS 
exist, 
although 
he did not explicitly 
derive 
equations 
for such surfaces. 
Beauville 
(1978) 
subsequently 
proved 
that 
31 double 
points 
was the maximum 
possible, 
and quintic 
surfaces 
having 
31 
ORDINARY 
DOUBLE 
POINTS 
are therefore 
sometimes 
called 
TOGLIATTI

Quota

A generalization

of quotas 
(90, . l . , qn} specifies, 
according 
to the number 
of votes, 
how many 
votes 
an alternative 
needs to win 
(Taylor 
1995). 
The 
quota 
system

a tie unless 
for some 
k, there 
are exactly 
k tie votes 
in the profile 
and one of the alternatives 
has at least qk votes, in which

The

N on X is the

if Q :

X/w 
denotes 
the MAP that 
sends each point

its EQUIVALENCE CLASS in X/N, 
the topology

Rabin-Miller 
Strong 
Pseudoprime 
Test 
A PRTMALTTY TEST 
which 
provides 
an efficient 
proba- 
bilistic 
ALGORITHM 
for determining 
if a given number 
is 
PRIME. 
It is based on the properties 
of STRONG 
PSEU- 
DOPRIMES. Given 
an ODD INTEGER rz, let n = 2’s+l 
with 
s ODD. 
Then 
choose 
a random 
integer 
a with 
l<a<n-1. 
If&=1 
(modn)orP~--1 
(modn) 
forsomeO<j<r- - 
- 
1, then n passes the test. 
A PRIME 
The 
test 
is very 
fast and 
requires 
no more 
than 
(1 + 
o(l)) 
lg n multiplications 
(mod 
n), where LG is the LOG- 
ARITHM 
base 2. Unfortunately, 
a number 
which 
passes 
the test 
is not 
necessarily 
PRIME, 
Monier 
(1980) 
and 
Rabin 
(1980) 
have shown 
that 
a COMPOSITE 
NUMBER 
passes the test for at most 
l/4 
of the possible 
bases a.. 
The 
Rabin-Miller 
test 
(combined 
with 
a LUCAS 
PSEU- 
DOPRTME 
test) 
is 
the 
PRIMALITY 
TEST 
used 
by 
Mathematic@ 
versions 
2.2 
and 
later 
(Wolfram 
Re- 
search, 
Champaign, 
IL). 
As of 1991, the combined 
test 
had been proven 
correct 
for all n < 2.5 x lOlo, 
but not 
beyond. 
The 
test potentially 
could 
therefore 
incorrectly 
identifyalarge 
COMPOSITE NUMBER as PRIME (but not 
vice versa). 
STRONG PSEUD~PRTME tests have been’sub- 
sequently 
proved 
valid 
for every number 
up to 3.4 x 10r4.

The symbol 
e 
used to indicate 
a root 
is called 
a radi- 
cal. The expression 
e 
is therefore 
read 
“2 radical 
n,” 
or “the 
nth 
ROOT 
of 2.” 
n = 2 is written 
fi 
and is 
called 
the SQUARE 
ROOT 
of 2. 
n = 3 corresponds 
to 
the CUBE 
ROOT. 
The 
quantity 
under 
the root 
is called 
the RADICAND.

A radical 
integer 
is a number 
obtained 
by closing 
the IN- 
TEGERS 
under 
ADDITION, 
DIVISION, 
MULTIPUCATION, 
SUBTRACTION, 
and 
ROOT 
extraction. 
An example

such a number 
is fi

The 
radical 
integers 
are a subring 
of the ALGEBRAIC 
INTE- 
GERS. If there 
are ALGEBRAIC 
INTEGERS 
which 
are not 
radical 
integers, 
they 
must 
at least be cubic.

Given 
a straight

segment 
Al so that 
the track 
bows into 
a circular 
ARC. 
Find 
the maximum 
displacement

track. 
The PYTHAGOREAN THEOREM gives 
R2 = x2 + (;q2,

But 
R is simply 
x + d, so 
R2 = (x + d)2 =x2 
+2xd+d”.

Solving 
(1) and (2) for CC gives

Expressing 
the length

Ramsey 
Number 
The 
Ramsey 
number 
R(m, 
n) gives the solution 
to the 
PARTY 
PROBLEM, 
which 
asks the minimum 
number 
of 
guests 
R(m, 
n) that 
must 
be invited 
so that 
at least m 
will know each other 
(i.e., there 
exists a CLIQUE 
of order 
m) 
or at least 
n will 
not 
know 
each other 
(i.e., 
there 
exists 
an independent 
set of order 
n). 
By symmetry, 
it 
is true 
that 
R(m,n) 
= R(n,m). 
(1) 
It also must 
be true 
that 
R(2,m) 
= m. 
(2) 
A generalized 
Ramsey 
number 
is written 
and 
is the 
smallest 
INTEGER 
R such’ that, 
no matter 
how each n-element 
SUJBSET of an r-element 
SET are 
colored 
with 
k colors, 
there 
exists an i such that 
there 
is 
a SUBSET 
of size mi, 
all of whose n-element 
SUBSETS are 
color 
i. The 
usual 
Ramsey 
numbers 
are.then 
equivalent 
to R(m, 
n) = R(m, 
n; 2). 
Bounds 
are given 
by 
R(k 
- 1,E) + R(k,E 
- 1) - 1 
for R(k 
- 1,Z) and 
R(W) 
< - 
R(k, 
2 - 
1) even 
(4) 
R(k 
- 1,Z) + R(k,Z 
- 1) 
otherwise 
and 
R(k, 
k) < 4R(k 
- 2, k) + 2 
- 
(5) 
(Chung 
and 
Grinstead 
1983). 
Erd6s 
proved 
that 
for 
diagonal 
Ramsey 
numbers 
R(k, 
k) , 
k2”i2 
eJZ 
=c R(k, 
k). 
(6) 
This 
result 
was subsequently 
improved 
by a factor 
of 2 
by Spencer 
(1975). 
R(3, 
k) was known 
since 1980 to be 
bounded 
from 
above 
by c2k2/ 
In k, and 
Griggs 
(1983) 
showed 
that 
c2 = 5/12 
was an acceptable 
limit, 
J.-H. 
Kim 
(Cipra 
1995) 
subsequently 
bounded 
R(3, k) by a 
similar 
expression 
from 
below,

A

For 
each 
m,n 
E N with

2 2, there 
exists 
a least 
INTEGER 
R(m,n) 
(the 
RAMSEY

such that 
no matter 
how the COMPLETE

The 
theorem 
can be equivalently 
stated 
that, 
for all E N, there 
exists 
an n f N such that 
any

Let IV steps of equal 
length 
be taken 
along 
a LINE. 
Let 
p be the probability 
of taking 
a step to the right, 
Q the 
probability 
of taking 
a step to the left, 
721 the number 
of steps taken 
to the right, 
and n2 the number 
of steps 
taken

The quantities 
p, Q, n1, n2, and IV are 
related 
by

Now examine

There

(z)

The

In a PLANE, 
consider 
a sum 
of IV 2-D 
VECTORS 
with 
random 
orientations. 
Use PHASOR 
notation, 
and let the 
phase 
of each

be RANDOM. 
Assume 
N 
unit

in an arbitrary 
direction 
(i.e., 
with 
the 
angle 
8 uniformly 
distributed 
in [0,27r) 
and 
not on a 
LATTICE), 
as illustrated 
above.

Each

so both 
Bj

with

and their 
difference 
is also a random 
variable. 
Averaging 
over this distribution, 
which has equally

yields 
an expectation

The 
eight 
types 
of rational 
double 
points 
(the 
& 
type 
being 
the 
one excluded) 
can occur 
in only 
20 combi- 
nations 
on a CUBIC 
SURFACE 
(of which 
Fischer 
1986 
gives 
19): 
AI, 
2A1, 
3A1, 
Qh, 
A2,

and 
& 
(Looijenga

In particular, 
on a CUBIC SURFACE, precisely 
those con- 
figurations 
of rational 
double 
points 
occur for which the 
disjoint 
union 
of the 
COXETER-DYNKIN 
DIAGRAM 
is 
a SUBCRAPH of the COXETER-DYNKIN 
DIAGRAM &. 
Also, 
a surface 
specializes 
to a more 
complicated 
one 
precisely 
when its graph 
is contained 
in the graph 
of the 
other 
one (Fischer 
1986).

Rational 
Point 
A K-rational 
point 
is a point 
(X, Y) on an ALGEBRAIC 
CURVE, 
where X and Y are in a FIELD 
K. 
The 
rational 
point 
may 
also be a POINT 
AT INFINITY. 
For example, 
take 
the ELLIPTIC 
CURVE 
Y2 =X3+X+42 
and homogenize 
it by introducing 
a third 
variable 
2 so 
that 
each term 
has degree 
3 as follows: 
ZY2 
= X3 + XZ2 
+ 42Z3. 
Now, 
find 
the points 
at infinity 
by setting 
2 = 0, ob- 
t aining 
0 = x3. 
Solving 
gives 
X 
= 0, Y equal 
to any value, 
and 
(by 
. definition) 
2 = 0. Despite 
freedom 
in the choice 
of Y, 
there 
is only 
a single 
PRINT 
AT INFINITY 
because 
the 
two triples 
(Xl, 
Yl, 
Zr), 
(X2, 
Y2, 22) 
are considered 
to be equivalent 
(or identified) 
only 
if one is a scalar 
RaY 
multiple 
of the other. 
Here, 
(0, 0, 0) is not considered 
to be a valid 
point. 
The 
triples 
(a, b, 1) correspond 
to the ordinary 
points 
(a, b), and the 
triples 
(a, b, 0) 
correspond 
to the POINTS 
AT INFINITY, 
usually 
called 
the LINE 
AT INFINITY. 
The 
rational 
points 
on ELLIPTIC 
CURVES 
over the GA- 
LOIS FIELD 
GF(q) 
are 5, 7, 9, 10, 13, 14, 16,

Theorem 
Each row and each column 
in the GROUP 
multiplication 
table 
lists 
each of the 
GROUP 
elements 
once and only 
once. 
From 
this, 
it follows 
that 
no two elements 
may 
be in the identical 
location 
in two rows or two columns. 
Thus, 
each row and each column 
is a rearranged 
list of 
the GROUP 
elements.

Rectangle 
Function 
The 
rectangle 
function 
II(z) 
is a function 
which 
is 0 
outside 
the 
interval 
[ - 1,1] 
and 
unity 
inside 
it. 
It 
is 
also called 
the GATE FUNCTION, PULSE FUNCTION, 
or 
WINDOW 
FUNCTION, and is defined 
by 
then 
Q is the n-adic 
reside of p, i.e., Q is an n-adic 
residue 
of p IFF xn = Q (mod 
p) is solvable 
for x:. 
The first case to be considered 
was n = 2 (the QUADRA- 
TIC RECIPROCITY THEOREM), ofwhich 
Gauss gave the 
first 
correct 
proof. 
Gauss 
also solved 
the 
case n = 3 
(CUBIC RECIPROCITY 
THEOREM) using 
INTEGERS of 
the 
form 
a + bp, when 
p is a root 
if x2 + x + I = 
0 
and a, b are rational 
INTEGERS. Gauss 
stated 
the case 
n = 4 (QUARTIC 
RECIPROCITY THEOREM) using 
the 
GAUSSIAN INTEGERS.

There

Recurring 
Digital 
Invariant 
To define 
a recurring 
digital 
invariant 
of order 
k, com- 
put2 
the sum of the kth powers of the digits 
of a number 
n. If this 
number 
n' is equal 
to the original 
number 
n, 
then 
n = 
n' is called 
a ~-NARCISSISTIC NUMBER. 
If 
not, 
compute 
the sums 
of the Jzth powers 
of the digits 
of n’, 
and so on. 
If this 
process 
eventually 
leads back 
to the original 
number 
n, the smallest 
number 
in the se- 
quence 
{n, n’, d, 
. . .} is said to be a k-recurring 
digital 
invariant. 
For example, 
55: 53+53 
= 250 
250:23 
+53 +03 = 133 
133 :13 + 33 +33 = 55, 
so 55 is an order 
3 recurring 
digital 
invariant. 
The 
fol- 
lowing 
table

digital 
invariants 
of orders 
2 to 10 (Madachy

Recursion 
A recursive 
process is one in which objects 
are defined 
in 
terms 
of other 
objects 
of the same type. 
Using 
some sort 
of RECURRENCE RELATION, the entire 
class of objects 
can then be built 
up from 
a few initial 
values and a small 
number 
of rules. 
The 
FIBONACCI NUMBERS are most 
commonly 
defined 
recursively. 
Care, 
however, 
must 
be 
taken 
to avoid 
SELF-RECURSION, in which 
an object 
is 
defined 
in terms 
of itself, 
leading 
to an infinite 
nesting.

Recursive 
Function 
A recursive 
function 
is a function 
generated 
by (1) ADDI- 
TION, 
(2) MULTIPLICATION, 
(3) selection 
of an element 
from 
a list, 
and 
(4) determination 
of the truth 
or fal- 
sity of the INEQUALITY a < b according 
to the technical 
rules: 
1. If F and the sequence 
of functions 
G1, . . . , G, 
are 
recursive, 
then 
so is F(G1,. 
. . , Gn). 
2. If F is a recursive 
function 
such that 
there 
is an z 
for each a with 
H(a, 
s) = 0, then 
the smallest 
zc can 
be obtained 
recursively. 
A TURING MACHINE is capable 
of computing 
recursive 
functions.

the reflection 
in 2- or 3-D SPACE consists 
of making 
the

Reflection 
Property 
In the 
plane, 
the reflection 
property 
can be stated 
as 
three 
theorems 
(Ogilvy 
1990, pp. 73-77): 
1. The LOCUS of the center 
of a variable 
CIRCLE, tan- 
gent to a fixed CIRCLE and passing 
through 
a fixed 
point 
inside 
that 
CIRCLE, is an ELLIPSE. 
2. If a variable 
CIRCLE is tangent 
to a fixed 
CIRCLE 
and 
also passes 
through 
a fixed 
point 
outside 
the 
CIRCLE, then 
the LOCUS of its moving 
center 
is a 
HYPERBOLA. 
Reflection 
Property 
3. If a variable 
CIRCLE is tangent 
to a fixed straight 
line 
and also passes through 
a fixed point 
not on the line, 
then 
the LOCUS of its moving 
center 
is a PARABOLA.

Polyhedron 
A polyhedron 
is said to be regular 
if its FACES and VER- 
TEX FIGURES are REGULAR (not 
necessarily 
CONVEX) 
polygons 
(Coxeter 
1973, 
p. 16). 
Using 
this 
definition, 
there 
are a total 
of nine 
regular 
polyhedra, 
five being 
the CONVEX 
PLATONIC SOLIDS 
and four being 
the CON-

KEPLER-P• INSOT SOLIDS. 
However, 
the term 
“regular 
polyhedra,, 
is sometimes 
used to refer 
exclusively 
to the CONVEX PLATONIC SOLIDS. 
It 
can be proven 
that 
only 
nine 
regular 
solids 
(in the 
Coxeter 
sense) exist 
by noting 
that 
a possible

are 
the

of

This 
gives 
three

Prime 
Two integers 
are relatively 
prime 
if they 
share no com- 
mon 
factors 
(divisors) 
except 
1. 
Using 
the 
notation 
(m,n) 
to denote 
the 
GREATEST 
COMMON 
DIVISOR, 
two integers 
m and n are relatively 
prime 
if (m, n) 
= 
1. Relatively 
prime 
integers 
are sometimes 
also called 
STRANGERS 
or COPRIME 
and are denoted 
nz L n. 
and n, (m, n) = k, can be interpreted 
as the number 
of 
LATTICE 
POINTS 
in the PLANE 
which lie on the straight 
LINE 
connecting 
the VECTORS 
(0,O) and (m, n) (exclud- 
ing (m, n) itself).

number

Given 
three

the probabil- 
ity that 
no common 
factor 
will

them 
all is

= 0.832..

where 
C(3) is API?RY'S

Remainder 
In general, 
a remainder 
is a quantity 
“left 
over” 
after 
performing 
a particular 
algorithm. 
The 
term 
is most 
commonly 
used to refer to the number 
left over when two 
integers 
are divided 
by each other 
in INTEGER 
DIVISION. 
For example, 
55\7 
= 7, with a remainder 
of 6. Of course 
in real 
division, 
there 
is no such thing 
as a remainder 
since, for example, 
55/7 
= 7 + 6/7. 
The 
term 
remainder 
of a CONGRUENCE. 
is also sometimes 
to the RESIDUE

Residue 
Class 
so 
The residue 
classes of a function 
f(z) 
mod 
rz are all pos- 
sible values of the RESIDUE f(z) 
(mod 
n). 
For example, 
the residue 
classes of z2 (mod 
6) are { 0, I, 3,4}, 
since 
o2 E 0 (mod 
6) 
l2 z 1 (mod

32 s 3 (mod 
6) 
42 G 4 (mod 
6) 
are all 
the 
possible 
residues. 
A COMPLETE RESIDUE 
SYSTEM is a set of integers 
containing 
one element 
from 
each class, so in this 
case, (0, 1,9,4} 
would 
be a COM- 
PLETE RESIDUE SYSTEM.

with 
many 
different 
meanings. 
It can refer to resolution 
of equations, 
reso-

(in ALGEBRAIC GEOMETRY), reso- 
lution 
of modules 
or more 
sophisticated 
structures, 
etc. 
In a BLOCK DESIGN, a PARTITION 22 of a BIBD’s

B into PARALLEL CLASSES, each of which 
in 
turn 
partitions

Resonance 
Overlap 
* 
Isolated 
resonances 
in 
a DYNAMICAL 
SYSTEM 
can 
cause considerable 
distortion 
of preserved 
TORI 
in their 
NEIGHBORHOOD, 
but 
they 
do not introduce 
any CHAOS 
into 
a system. 
IIowever, 
when two or more 
resonances 
are simultaneously 
present, 
they 
will 
render 
a system 
nonintegrable. 
Furthermore, 
if they 
are 
sufficiently 
“close” 
to each other, 
they will 
result 
in the appearance 
of widespread 
(large-scale) 
CHAOS. 
To 
investigate 
this 
problem, 
Walker 
and 
Ford 
(1969) 
took 
the integrable 
Hamiltonian 
Ho(h,Iz) = 11 + 12 - -r; - 31112 + Iz2 
and investigated 
the effect of adding 
a 2:2 resonance 
and 
a 3:2 resonance 
H(I$) 
= Ho(I) + a1112 cos(281 - 282) 
+@A 
3’212 
COS( 201 - 382). 
At low energies, 
the resonant 
zones are well-separated. 
As the energy 
increases, 
the zones overlap 
and a “macro- 
scopic 
zone of instability” 
appears. 
When 
the overlap 
starts, 
many 
higher-order 
resonances 
are also involved 
so fairly 
large 
areas of PHASE 
SPACE 
have their 
TORI 
destroyed 
and the ensuing 
CHAOS 
is “widespread” 
since 
trajectories 
are now free to wander 
between 
regions 
that 
previously 
were separated 
by nonresonant 
TORI. 
Walker 
and Ford 
(1969) 
were able 
to numerically 
pre- 
dict 
the energy 
at which 
the overlap 
of the resonances 
first 
occurred. 
They 
plotted 
the 
&-axis 
intercepts 
of 
the inner 
2:2 and the outer 
2:3 separatrices 
as a func- 
tion 
of total 
energy. 
The 
energy 
at which 
they 
crossed 
was found 
to be identical 
to that 
at which 
2:2 and 2:3 
resonance 
zones began 
to overlap.

of n elements,

string 
ala2 . . . a, 
in 
which 
each 
character 
gives 
the

which 
the corresponding 
el- 
ement 
belongs 
is called 
the restricted 
growth

(or 
sometimes 
the RESTRICTED

FUNCTION). 
For 
example, 
for the SET PARTITION 
{{l}, 
{2}, {3,4}}, 
the 
restricted 
growth 
string 
would 
be 0122. 
If the BLOCKS 
are “sorted” 
so that 
al = 0, then 
the restricted

satisfies 
the INEQUALITY 
ai+l

Extrapolation 
The consideration 
of the result 
of a numerical 
calculation 
as a function 
of an adjustable 
parameter 
(usually 
the

The function 
can then be fitted 
and evaluated 
at h = 
0 to yield 
very 
accurate 
results. 
Press 
et al. 
(1992) 
describe 
this 
process 
as turning

Riemann 
Hypothesis 
First 
published 
in Riemann 
(1859), 
the 
Riemann 
hy- 
pothesis 
states 
that 
the 
nontrivial 
ROOTS 
of the RIE- 
MANN ZETA FUNCTION 
where 
s E c (the COMPLEX NUMBERS), all lie on the 
“CRITICAL 
LINE” 
!X[s] = 
l/2, 
where 
$Z[Z] denotes 
the 
REAL PART of Z. The Riemann 
hypothesis 
is also known 
as ARTIN'S CONJECTURE. 
In 1914, Hardy 
proved 
that 
an INFINITE 
number 
of val- 
ues for s can be found 
for which c(s) = 0 and !J?[s] = l/Z. 
However, 
it is not known 
if all nontrivial 
roots 
s satisfy 
!R[s] = l/2, 
so the conjecture 
remains 
open. 
Andrk 
Weil 
proved 
the Riemann 
hypothesis 
to be true for field func- 
tions 
(Weil 
1948, Eichler 
1966, Ball 
and Coxeter 
1987). 
In 1974, 
Levin 
showed 
that 
at least 
l/3 
of the 
ROOTS 
must 
lie on the CRITICAL 
LINE (Le Lionnais 
1983), 
a 
result 
which 
has since 
been 
sharpened 
to 40% 
(Vardi 
1991, p. 142). 
It is known 
that 
the zeros are symmetri- 
cal placed 
about 
the line 
S[s] = 0. 
al. 1994). 
It is also equivalent 
to the assertion 
that 
for 
some constant 
c, 
1 Li(a) 
- n(x)1 
5 c& 
lnx, 
(2) 
where Li(x) 
is the LOGARITHMIC INTEGRAL and K is the 
PRIME COUNTING FUNCTION (Wagon 
1991). 
The hypothesis 
was computationally 
tested 
and found 
to 
be true 
for the first 2 x 108 zeros by Brent 
et al. (1979), 
a limit 
subsequently 
extended 
to the first 
1.5 x 10’ + I 
zeros by Brent 
ef al. (1979). 
Brent’s 
calculation 
covered 
zeros u + it in the region 
0 < t < 81,702,130.19. 
There 
is also a finite 
analog 
of the 
Riemann 
hypothe- 
sis concerning 
the 
location 
of zeros for function 
fields 
defined 
by equations 
such as 
ay’ + bz” 
+ c = 0. 
(3) 
This 
hypothesis, 
developed 
by Weil, 
is analogous 
to the 
usual 
Riemann 
hypothesis. 
The number 
of solutions 
for 
the particular 
cases (2, m) = (2,2), 
(3,3), 
(4,4), and (2,4) 
were known 
to Gauss.

Integral 
The 
Riemann 
integral 
is the 
INTEGRAL

en- 
countered 
in CALCULUS 
texts and used by physicists 
and 
engineers. 
Other 
types 
of integrals 
exist 
(e.g., the LEB- 
ESGUE INTEGRAL), 
but 
are unlikely 
to be encountered 
outside 
the confines 
of advanced 
mathematics 
texts. 
The 
Riemann 
integral 
is based 
on the JORDAN MEA- 
SURE, and defined 
by taking 
a limit 
of a RIEMANN SUM,

where a 5 x 2 b and xi, 
yz, and zz are arbitrary 
points 
in the intervals 
Axk,

respectively. 
The 
value max Axk 
is called 
the MESH 
SIZE of a partition 
of 
the interval 
[a, b] into 
subintervals 
ax,. 
As an example 
of the application 
of the Riemann 
integral

find the AREA

the curve y = xf from

(6, b) into

so Axk

Mapping 
Theorem 
Let 
~0 be a point 
in a simply 
connected 
region 
R # C. 
Then 
there 
is a unique 
ANALYTIC FUNCTION 
w = f(z) 
mapping 
R one-to-one 
onto 
the DISK Iw 1 < 1 such that 
f(zo) 
= 0 and f'(zo) 
= 0. The COROLLARY guarantees 
that 
any two simply 
connected 
regions 
except 
Ik2 can be 
mapped 
CONFORMALLY onto each other.

The 
value 
for c( 2) can be found 
using 
a number 
of dif- 
ferent techniques 
(Apostol 
1983, Choe 
1987, Giesy 1972, 
Holme 
1970, Kimble 
1987, Knopp

1973, 
Sim- 
mons 
1992, Stark 
1969, Stark 
1970, Yaglom 
and Yaglom 
1987). 
The 
problem 
of finding 
this 
value 
analytically 
is sometimes 
known 
as the BASLER 
PROBLEM 
(Castel- 
lanes 
1988). 
Yaglom 
and Yaglom 
(1987), 
Holme 
(1970), 
and Papadimitrou 
(1973) 
all derive 
the result 
from 
DE 
MOIVRE’S 
IDENTITY 
or related 
identities. 
Consider 
the FOURIER 
SERIES 
of f(x)

f(x) = +o + x

(49) 
(47) 
where 
the 
latter 
is true 
since 
the

is ODD. 
Therefore, 
the FOURIER

Riemannian 
Geometry 
The 
study 
of MANIFOLDS having 
a complete 
RIEMAN- 
NIAN METRIC. 
Riemannian 
geometry 
is a general 
space 
based on the LINE ELEMENT 
ds = F(x’, 
. . . , xn; dx’, 
. . l , dxn), 
with 
F(x,y) 
> 0 for y # 0 a function 
on the 
TANGENT 
BUNDLE 
TM. 
In addition, 
F is homogeneous 
of degree 
I in y and of the form 
F2 x gij (2) 
dxi dx’ 
(Chern 
1996). 
If this restriction 
is dropped, 
the resulting 
geometry 
is called 
FINSLER 
GEOMETRY.

Riffle 
Shuffle 
A SHUFFLE, also called a FARO SHUFFLE, in which 
a 
deck of 2n cards is divided 
into two HALVES which are 
then 
alternatively 
interleaved 
from 
the 
left 
and 
right 
hands 
(an “in-shuffle”) 
or from 
the right 
and left hands 
(an “out-shuffle”). 
Using 
an “in-shuffle,” 
a deck origi- 
nally 
arranged 
as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 would 
become 
5 1 6 2 7 
3 8 4. Using 
an “out-shuffle,” 
the deck order 
would 
be- 
come 1 5 2 6 3 7 4 8. Riffle 
shuffles are used in card tricks 
(Marlo 
1958ab, 
Adler 
1973), 
and 
also in the 
theory 
of 
parallel 
processing 
(Stone 
1971, Chen 
et al. 1981). 
In general, 
card 
k moves 
to the position 
originally 
oc- 
cupied 
by the 
2kth 
card 
(mod 
2n + l)* 
Therefore, 
in- 
shuffling 
2n cards 2n times 
(where 
2n + 1 is PRIME) re- 
sults in the original 
card order. 
Similarly, 
out-shuffling 
2n cards 2n - 2 times 
(where 
2n - 
1 is PRIME) 
results 
in the original 
order 
(Diaconis 
et al. 1983, Conway 
and 
Guy 
1996). 
A mazingly, 
this 
means 
that 
an ordinary 
is returned 
to its original 
order 
after 8 
deck of 52 cards 
out-shuffles. 
Morris 
(1994) 
further 
discusses 
aspects 
of the perfect 
riffle 
shuffle 
(in which 
the 
deck 
is cut exactly 
in half 
and cards are perfectly 
interlaced). 
Ramnath 
and Scully 
(1996) 
give an algorithm 
for the shortest 
sequence 
of in- 
and out-shuffles 
to move 
a card from 
arbitrary 
position 
i to position 
j, Thi .s algorithm 
works 
for any deck with 
an EVEN number 
of cards and is O(log 
n)*

It is

found 
it as the Lo-

triangle, 
the MIDPOINT 
of the HYPOTENUSE 
is equidistant 
from 
the three VERTICES (Dunham 
1990). 
This 
can be proved 
as follows. 
Given 
AABC, 
let M 
be the MIDPOINT 
of AB 
(so that 
AM 
= BM). 
Draw 
DMJ)CA, 
then 
since 
ABDM 
is similar 
to ABCA, 
it 
follows 
that 
BD 
= 
DC. 
Since 
both 
ABDM 
and 
ACDM 
are right 
triangles 
and 
the corresponding 
legs 
are equal, 
the HYPOTENUSES are also equal, 
so we have 
AM 
= B&f 
= CM 
and the theorem 
is proved.

Rigid 
A FRAMEWORK is rigid 
IFF continuous 
motion 
of the 
points 
of the 
configuration 
maintaining 
the 
bar 
con- 
straints 
comes 
from 
a family 
of motions 
of all EUCLID- 
EAN SPACE which 
are distance-preserving. 
A GRAPH G 
is (generically) 
d-rigid 
if, for almost 
all 
(i.e., 
an open 
dense set of) CONFIGURATIONS ofp, 
the FRAMEWORK 
G(p) 
is rigid 
in IP. 
One of the first results 
in rigidity 
theory 
was the RIGID- 
ITY THEOREM by Cauchy 
in 1813. 
Although 
rigidity 
problems 
were of immense 
interest 
to engineers, 
inten- 
sive mathematical 
study 
of these types 
of problems 
has 
occurred 
only relatively 
recently 
(Connelly

Rigidity 
Theorem 
If the 
faces of a conwex POLYHEDRON were made 
of 
metal 
plates 
and 
the EDGES were replaced 
by hinges, 
the POLYHEDRON would 
be RIGID. 
The 
theorem 
was 
stated 
by Cauchy 
(1813), 
although 
a mistake 
in this pa- 
per went unnoticed 
for more 
than 
50 years. 
An example 
of a concave 
“FLEXIBLE 
POLYHEDRON" (with 
18 trian- 
gular 
faces) for which 
this is not true was given 
by Con- 
nelly 
(1978), 
and a FLEXIBLE POLYHEDRON with 
only 
14 triangular 
faces was subsequently 
found 
by Steffen 
(Mackenzie 
1998). 
A ring 
that 
is COMMUTATIVE under 
multiplication, 
has 
a unit 
element, 
and has no divisors 
of zero is called 
an 
INTEGRAL DOMAIN. A ring 
which 
is also a COMMUTA- 
TIVE multiplication 
group 
is called 
a FIELD. 
The 
sim- 
plestrings 
are the INTEGERS Z, POLYNOMIALS I&land 
I& 
y] in one and two variables, 
and SQUARE 
nxn 
REAL 
MATRICES. 
Rings 
which 
have been investigated 
and found 
to be of 
interest 
are usually 
named 
after one or more 
of their 
in- 
vestigators. 
This 
practice 
unfortunately 
leads to names 
which 
give very little 
insight 
into 
the relevant 
properties 
of the associated 
rings.

Whenever

(i.e., 
n 2 k > 0 or k > 0 > n), the Roman 
coefficient 
agrees 
with 
it. However, 
the Roman

are defined 
for

Roman 
Numeral 
A system 
of numerical 
notations 
used by the Romans. 
It 
is an additive 
(and subtractive) 
system 
in which 
letters 
are used to denote 
certain 
“base” 
numbers, 
and 
arbi- 
trary 
numbers 
are then 
denoted 
using 
combinations 
of 
symbols.

For example, 
the number 
1732 would 
be denoted 
MD- 
CCXXXII. 
One 
additional 
rule 
states 
that, 
instead 
of 
using four symbols 
to represent 
a 4, 40, 9, 90, etc., such 
numbers 
are instead 
denoted 
by preceding 
the symbol 
Roman Surface 
for 5, 50, 10, 100, etc., with a symbol 
indicating 
subtruc- 
tion. 
For example, 
4 is denoted 
IV, 
9 as IX, 
40 as XL, 
etc. 
However, 
this 
rule is generally 
not followed 
on the 
faces of clocks, 
where 1111 is usually 
encountered 
instead 
of IV. 
Roman 
numerals 
are encountered 
in the release 
year for 
movies 
and occasionally 
on the numerals 
on the faces of 
watches 
and clocks, 
but 
in few other 
modern 
instances. 
They 
do have the advantage 
that 
ADDITION 
can be done 
“symbolically” 
(and without 
worrying 
about 
the “place” 
of a given 
DIGIT) 
by simply 
combining 
all the symbols 
together, 
grouping, 
writing 
groups 
of 5 Is as V, groups 
of 2 Vs as X, etc. 
Roman 
Surface 
A QUARTIC 
NONORIENTABLE 
SURFACE, 
also known 
as 
the 
STEINER 
SURFACE. 
The 
Roman 
surface 
is one of 
the three possible 
surfaces 
obtained 
by sewing a MOBIUS 
STRIP to the edge of a DISK. 
The other 
two are the BOY 
SURFACE 
and 
CROSS-CAP, 
all of which 
are homeomor- 
phic 
to the REAL 
PROJECTIVE 
PLANE 
(Pinkall 
1986). 
The 
center 
point 
of the 
Roman 
surface 
is an 
ordi- 
nary 
TRIPLE 
POINT 
with 
(fl,O,O) 
= 
(O,ff,O) 
= 
(O,O, fl), 
and 
the 
six endpoints 
of the 
three 
lines 
of 
self-intersection 
are singular 
PINCH 
POINTS, 
also known 
as WHITNEY 
SINGULARITIES. 
The 
Roman 
surface is es- 
sentially 
six CROSS-CAPS 
stuck 
together 
and contains 
a 
double 
INFINITY 
of CONKS. 
The 
Roman 
surface 
can given 
by the equation 
(~~+y~+z~-k~)~ 
= [(z-k)2 
-2a:2][(z+k)2-2y2].

Solving 
for z gives the pair

Setting

Rook 
Number 
The 
rook 
numbers 
rf 
of an n x n BOARD B are the 
number 
of subsets 
of size n such that 
no two elements 
have the same first or second 
coordinate. 
In other 
word, 
it is the number 
of ways of placing 
n rooks 
on B such 
that 
none 
attack 
each 
other. 
The 
rook 
numbers 
of a 
board 
determine 
the rook 
numbers 
of the complemen- 
tary 
board 
B, 
defined 
to be d x d\B. 
This 
is known 
as the ROOK RECIPROCITY 
THEOREM. 
The

Rooks 
Problem 
The 
rook 
is a CHESS 
piece 
which 
may 
move 
any num- 
ber of spaces either 
horizontally 
or vertically 
per move. 
The maximum 
number 
of nonattacking 
rooks which may 
be placed 
on an n x n CHESSBOARD 
is n. 
This 
arrange- 
ment 
is achieved 
by placing 
the rooks 
along 
the diagonal 
(Madachy 
1979). 
The 
total 
number 
of ways of placing 
n nonattacking 
rooks 
on an n x n boar,d is n! (Madachy 
1979, p. 47). The number 
of rotationally 
and reflectively 
inequivalent 
ways of placing 
n nonattacking 
rooks 
on 
an n x 
n board 
are 1, 2, 7, 23, 115, 694, 
l . . (Sloane’s 
A000903; 
Dudeney 
1970, 
p. 96; Madachy 
1979, pp. 46- 
54). 
The 
minimum 
number 
of rooks 
needed 
to occupy 
or at- 
tack all spaced on an 8 x 8 CHESSBOARD 
is 8, illustrated 
above 
(Madachy 
1979). 
Consider 
an n x n chessboard 
with 
the restriction 
that, 
for every 
subset 
of { 1, . . . , n}, 
a rook 
may 
not 
be put 
in column 
s + j (mod 
n) when on row j, where the rows 
are numbered 
0, 1, . . . , n - 1. 
Vardi 
(1991) 
denotes 
the number 
of rook 
solutions 
so restricted 
as rook@, 
n). 
rook({l), 
> 
n 
is simply 
the 
number 
of DERANGEMENTS 
on n symbols, 
known 
as a SUBFACTORIAL. 
The first few 
values 
are 1, 2, 9, 44, 265, 1854, 
. . . (Sloane’s 
A000166). 
rook({l, 
21, 
) 
n 
is a solution 
to the MARRIED 
COUPLES 
PROBLEM, 
sometimes 
known 
as MI~NAGE 
NUMBERS.

Root 
The roots 
of an equation 
f(x) -0 
(1) 
are the values 
of z for which 
the equation 
is satisfied. 
The FUNDAMENTAL 
THEOREM 
OF ALGEBRA 
statesthat 
every 
POLYNOMIAL 
equation 
of degree 
n has exactly 
72 
roots, 
where some roots 
may have a multiplicity 
greater 
than 
1 (in which 
case they 
are said to be degenerate). 
To find the nth 
roots 
of a COMPLEX 
NUMBER, 
solve the 
equation 
zn = w. Then 
zn = /xl”[cos(n8)+isin(d)] 
= lull (cos~+isin$),

Rubik’s 
Cube 
A 3 x 3 x 3 CUBE 
in which the 26 subcubes 
on the outside 
are internally 
hinged 
in such a way that 
rotation 
(by a 
quarter 
turn 
in either 
direction 
or a half turn) 
is possible 
in any plane 
of cubes. 
Each 
of the six sides is painted 
a distinct 
color, 
and the goal of the puzzle 
is to return 
the cube to a state 
in which 
each side has a single 
color 
after it has been randomized 
by repeated 
rotations. 
The 
PUZZLE 
was invented 
in the 
1970s 
by the 
Hungarian 
Erno 
Rubik 
and sold millions 
of copies 
worldwide 
over 
the next 
decade. 
The 
number 
of possible 
positions 
of Rubik’s 
cube is 
8!12!38212 
203.2 
= 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 
(Turner 
and Gold 
1985). 
Hoey showed using the P~LYA- 
BURNSIDE 
LEMMA 
that 
there 
are 901,083,404,981,813,- 
616 positions 
up to conjugacy 
by whole-cube 
symme- 
tries. 
Algorithms 
exist for solving 
a cube from an arbitrary 
ini- 
tial 
position, 
but 
they 
are not necessarily 
optimal 
(i.e., 
requiring 
a minimum 
number 
of turns). 
The 
maximum 
number 
of turns 
required 
for an arbitrary 
starting 
po- 
sition 
is still 
not 
known, 
although 
it is bounded 
from 
above. 
Michael 
Reid 
(1995) 
produced 
the best 
proven 
bound 
of 29 turns 
(or 42 “quarter-turns”). 
The 
proof 
involves 
large tables 
of “subroutines” 
generated 
by com- 
puter. 
However, 
Dik 
Winter 
has produced 
a program 
based on 
work by Kociemba 
which 
has solved 
each of millions 
of 
cubes in at most 21 turns. 
Recently, 
Richard 
Korf 
(1997) 
has produced 
a different 
algorithm 
away from 
for cubes up to 18 moves 
which 
is practical 
solved. 
Out 
of 10 
randomly 
generated 
cubes, one was solved 
three 
required 
17 moves, 
and six required 
in 
18 
16 moves, 
moves.

A 
method 
of integrating 
ORDINARY 
DIFFERENTIAL 
EQUATIONS 
by using 
a trial 
step 
at the 
midpoint 
of 
an interval 
to cancel 
out 
lower-order 
error

The 
second-order 
formula 
is 
h = hf (Xn,Yn) 
k2 = hf(xn + ;h, yn + $1) 
yn+l 
= 
yn 
+ 
b 
+ 
o(h3), 
and the fourth-order 
formula 
is 
h = hf (xn, yn) 
kz = hf(xn + +h,yn 
+ $1) 
h 
= hf(xn 
+ +h,yn 
+ $ka) 
JE4 = hf (xn + h, yn + kg)

(Press 
et al. 1992). 
This 
method 
is reasonably 
simple 
and robust 
and is a good general 
candidate 
for numerical 
solution 
of differential 
equations 
when combined 
with an 
intelligent 
adaptive

Russian 
Roulette 
Russian 
roulette 
is a GAME 
of chance 
in which 
one or 
more 
of the six chambers 
of a gun are filled 
with bullets, 
the magazine 
is rotated 
at random, 
and the gun is shot. 
The 
shooter 
bets on whether 
the chamber 
which 
rotates 
into 
place 
will 
be loaded. 
If it is, he loses not 
only 
his 
bet but his life. 
A modified 
version 
is considered 
by Horn 
et al. (1996) 
and Blom 
(1989). 
In this variant, 
the revolver 
is loaded 
with a single 
bullet, 
and two duelists 
alternately 
spin the 
chamber 
and fire at themselves 
until 
one is killed. 
The 
probability 
that 
the first 
duelist 
is killed 
is then 
6/11.

Paradox 
Consider 
a game 
in which 
a player 
bets on whether 
a 
given 
TOSS of a COIN 
will 
turn 
up heads or tails. 
If he 
bets 
$1 that 
heads 
will 
turn 
up on the first 
throw, 
$2 
that 
heads 
will 
turn 
up on the second 
throw 
(if it did 
not turn 
up on the first), 
$4 that 
heads will 
turn 
up on 
the third 
throw, 
etc., his expected 
pa&is 
i(l) 
+ 32) 
+ 34) 
+. 
. . = 3 + + + f +. 
l 
l = 00. 
Apparently, 
the first 
player 
can be in the hole 
by any 
amount 
of money 
and still 
come 
out ahead 
in the end. 
This 
PARADOX 
was 
first 
proposed 
by Daniel 
Bernoulli. 
The 
paradox 
arises as a result 
of muddling 
the distinc- 
tion 
between 
the amount 
of the final 
payoff 
and the net 
amount 
won in the game. 
It is misleading 
to consider 
the payoff without 
taking 
into 
account 
the amount 
lost 
on previous 
bets, 
as can be shown 
as follows. 
At the 
time 
the player 
first 
wins (say, on the nth 
toss), he will 
have lost 
n-l 
>: 
2 k-l 
= y-1 
- 1 
k=l 
dollars. 
In this toss, however, 
he wins 2”-l 
dollars. 
This 
means 
that 
the net gain for the player 
is a whopping 
$1, 
no matter 
how many 
tosses it takes 
to finally 
win. 
As 
expected, 
the 
large 
payoff 
after 
a long 
run 
of tails 
is 
exactly 
balanced 
by the large 
amount 
that 
the player 
has to invest. 
In fact, 
by noting 
that 
the 
probability 
of winning 
on 
the nth 
toss is 1/2n, 
it can be seen that 
the probability 
distribution 
for the number 
of tosses needed 
to win is 
simply 
a GEOMETRIC 
DISTRIBUTION 
with p = l/2.

sarkovskii’s 
Theorem 
Order 
the NATURAL 
NUMBERS 
as follows: 
Nowlet 
F bea C~NTINUUUS 
FUNCTIUN 
fromthe 
REALS 
to the REALS 
and suppose 
p + 4 in the above 
ordering. 
Then 
if F has a point 
of LEAST 
PERIOD 
p, then 
F also 
has a point 
of LEAST 
PERIOD 
4. 
A special 
case of this general 
result, 
also known 
as Sar- 
kovskii’s 
theorem, 
states 
that 
if a CONTINUOUS 
REAL 
function 
has a PERIODIC 
POINT 
with 
period 
3, then 
there 
is a PERIODIC 
POINT 
of period 
n for every 
IN- 
TEGER 
n. 
A converse 
to $arkovskii’s 
theorem 
says that 
if p + q 
in the above 
ordering, 
then 
we can find a CONTINUOUS 
FUNCTION which 
has a point 
of LEAST 
PERIOD 
q, but 
does not 
have 
any points 
of LEAST 
PERIOD 
p (Elaydi 
1996). 
For example, 
there 
is a CONTINUOUS 
FUNCTION 
with 
no points 
of LEAST 
PERIOD 
3 but having 
points 
of 
all other 
LEAST 
PERIODS.

Scherk’s 
Minimal 
Surfaces 
A class 
of MINIMAL 
SURFACES discovered 
by Scherk 
(1834) 
which were the first new surfaces discovered 
since 
Meusnier 
in 1776. 
Scherk’s 
first 
surface 
is doubly 
peri- 
odic. 
Scherk’s 
second 
surface, 
illustrated 
above, 
can be 
written 
parametrically 
as 
it: = 2E[ln(l 
+ rP> 
- ln(1 - reis)] 
y = %[4i tan-l 
(Tei”)] 
z = !R {Zi(- 
ln[l 
- r2e2iB] + ln[l 
+ r2e2is])} 
for 8 E [0,27r), 
and 
r f 
(0,l). 
Scherk’s 
first 
surface 
has been observed 
to form 
in layers of block 
copolymers 
(Peterson 
1988).

The

can be used 
in the neighborhood 
of 
degenerate 
multiple 
roots 
while 
still 
providing 
a guar-

rate. 
Almost

root-finding 
methods 
can be considered 
as special 
cases of SchrSder’s 
method.

that 
papers

could 
be evaluated 
quickly 
by looking 
for a citation

if the reference 
were 
missing, 
the paper 
probably 
consisted 
of a rediscovery

due to Schrijder

For

no matter 
how the 
set of INTEGERS less than 
Ln!e] 
(where

is partitioned 
into 
JC classes, 
one 
class must 
contain 
INTEGERS z, 
y, z such 
that 
x+Y 
= z, where 
z and y are not

The 
Schur 
numbers 
are the numbers 
in the partition- 
ing of a set which 
are guaranteed 
to exist by SCHUR'S 
LEMMA. Schur numbers 
satisfy 
the inequality 
s(k) 
2 c(315)k’5 
for Iz > 5 and some constant 
c. SCHUR'S THEOREM also 
shows that 
44

where 
R(n) 
is a RAMSEY NUMBER.

for any KNOT. 
The

Yemiring 
A semiring 
is a set together 
with 
two BINARY 
OPERA- 
TORS S(+, 
*) satisfying 
the following 
conditions: 
1. Additive 
associativity: 
For all a, b, c E S, (a+b)+c 
= 
a+(b+c), 
2. Additive 
commutativity: 
For all a, b E S, a + b = 
b + a, 
3. Multiplicative 
associativity: 
For all a, b, c f S, (a I 
b) * c = a* (b*c), 
4. Left 
and right 
distributivity: 
For all a, b, c E S, a * 
(b+c) 
= (u*b)+(u*c) 
and (b+c)*a 
= (b*a)+(c*u). 
Thus 
a semiring 
is therefore 
a commutative 
SEMIGROUP 
under 
addition 
and a SEMIGROUP 
under 
multiplication. 
A semiring 
can be empty.

Separation 
Two distinct 
point 
pairs AC and BD 
separate 
each other 
if A, B, C, and D lie on a CIRCLE 
(or line) 
in such order 
that 
either 
of the arcs (or the line segment 
AC) 
contains 
one but 
not 
both 
of B and 
D. 
In addition, 
the point 
pairs separate 
each other 
if every CIRCLE 
through 
A and 
C intersects 
(or coincides 
with) 
every 
CIRCLE 
through 
B and D. 
If the point 
pairs 
separate 
each other, 
then 
the symbol 
AC//BD 
is used. 
Separation 
of Variables 
A method 
of solving 
partial 
differential 
equations 
in a 
function 
+ and variables 
Z, y, . . . by making 
a substi- 
tution 
of the form 
qx, 
y, 
l 
l l 
) 
= 
X(x)Y(y)

, 
breaking 
the resulting 
equation 
into a set of independent 
ordinary 
different 
ial equations, 
solving 
these for X (x) , 
Y(Y), 
l 
’ 
’ 
1 and then plugging 
them 
back into the original 
equation. 
This 
technique 
works because 
if the product 
of functions 
of independent 
variables 
is a constant, 
each 
function 
must 
separately 
be a constant. 
Success requires 
choice 
of an appropriate 
coordinate 
system 
and may not be at- 
tainable 
at all depending 
on the equation. 
Separation 
of 
variables 
was first used by L’Hospital 
in 1750. 
It is espe- 
cially 
useful in solving 
equations 
arising 
in mathematical 
physics,suchas 
LAPLACE'S 
EQUATION, 
the HELMHOLTZ 
DIFFERENTIAL 
EQUATION,

the

Series 
A series is a sum of terms 
specified 
by some rule. 
If each 
term 
increases 
by a constant 
amount, 
it is said to be an 
ARITHMETIC 
SERIES. If each term 
equals 
the previous 
multiplied 
by a constant, 
it is said 
to be a GEOMET- 
RIC SERIES. A series usually 
has an INFINITE’ 
number 
of terms, 
but the phrase 
INFINITE 
SERIES 
is sometimes 
used for emphasis 
or clarity. 
If the sum of partial 
sequences 
comprising 
the first few 
terms 
of the series does not 
converge 
to a LIMIT 
(e.g., 
it oscillates 
or approaches 
&oo), 
it is said to diverge. 
An example 
of a convergent 
series is the GEOMETRIC

A number 
of methods 
known 
as CONVERGENCE TESTS 
can be used to determine 
whether 
a given 
series con- 
verges. 
Although 
terms 
of a series can have either 
sign, 
convergence 
properties 
can often 
be computed 
in the 
“worst 
case” of all terms 
being 
POSITIVE, and then 
ap- 
plied 
to the particular 
series at hand. 
A series of terms 
un is said to be ABSOLUTELY 
CONVERGENT if the series 
formed 
by taking 
the absolute 
values 
of the un, 
>1 l”A 
converges. 
An especially 
strong 
type 
of convergence 
is called 
UN- 
IF0 RM CONVERGEW E, and series which 
are uniformly 
convergent 
have particularly 
“nice” 
properties. 
For ex- 
ample, 
the sum 
of a UNIFORMLY CONVERGENT series 
of continuous 
functions 
is continuous. 
A CONVERGENT 
SERIES can be DIFFERENTIATED 
term 
by term, 
provided 
that 
the functions 
of the series have continuous 
deriva- 
tives and that 
the series of DERIVATIVES is UNIFORMLY 
CONVERGENT. Finally,a 
UNIFORMLY CONVERGENT 
se- 
ries of continuous 
functions 
can be INTEGRATED 
term 
by 
term. 
For a table 
listing 
the COEFFICIENTS for various 
series 
operations, 
see Abramowitz 
and Stegun 
(1972, 
p. 15). 
While 
it can be difficult 
to calculate 
analytical 
expres- 
sions for arbitrary 
convergent 
infinite 
series, 
many 
al- 
gorithms 
can handle 
a variety 
of common 
series types. 
The program 
Mathematics@ 
(Wolfram 
Research, 
Cham- 
paign, 
IL) 
implements 
many 
of these algorithms. 
Gen- 
eral techniques 
also exist 
for computing 
the numerical 
values 
to any but 
the most 
pathological 
series (Braden 
1992).

Set 
A set is a FINITE 
or INFINITE 
collection 
of objects. 
Older 
words 
for set include 
AGGREGATE and CLASS. Russell 
also 
uses the 
term 
MANIFULD 
to refer 
to a set. 
The 
study 
of sets and 
their 
properties 
is the object 
of SET 
THEORY. 
Symbols 
used 
to operate 
on sets include 
A 
(which 
denotes 
the EMPTY SET 0), v = (which 
denotes 
the POWER SET of a set), 
n (which 
means 
“and” 
or 
INTERSECTION), 
and U (which 
means 
“or” 
or UNION).

The NOTATION AB, where 
A and l3 are arbitrary 
sets, 
is used to denote 
the 
set o MAPS from 
B to A. 
For 
example, 
an element 
of X d would 
be a MAP from 
the 
NATURAL NUMBERS N to the set X. 
Call 
such a func- 
tion 
f, then 
f(l), 
f(2), 
etc., 
are elements 
of X, 
so call 
them 
~1, 22, etc. 
This 
now looks 
like a SEQUENCE of el- 
ements 
of X, so sequences 
are really 
just functions 
from 
N to X. 
This 
NOTATION is standard 
in mathematics 
and is frequently 
used in symbolic 
dynamics 
to denote 
sequence 
spaces.

Sexy Primes 
Since 
a PRIME 
NUMBER 
cannot 
be divisible 
by 2 or 3, 
it must 
be true 
that, 
for a PRIME 
p, p E 6 (mod 
1,5). 
This 
motivates 
the definition 
of sexy primes 
as a pair 
of primes 
(p, q) such that 
p - q = 6 (“sexy” 
since 
“sex” 
is the Latin 
word for “six.“). 
The 
first 
few sexy prime 
pairs are (5, ll), 
(7, 13), (11, 17), (13, 19), (17, 23), (23, 
29),

and A046117). 
Sexy constellations 
also exist. 
The first few sexy triplets 
( i.e., 
numbers 
such 
that 
each 
of (p,p 
+ 6, p + 12) is 
PRIME 
but p + 18 is not PRIME) 
are (7, 13, 19), (17, 23,

(31, 37, 43), 
(47, 
53, 59), 
l . . (Sloane’s 
A046118, 
A046119, 
and A046120). 
The first few sexy quadruplets 
are (11, 17, 23, 29), 
(41, 47, 53, 59), 
(61, 67, 73, 79), 
(251,

. . . (Sloane’s 
A046121,

Sexy 
quadruplets 
can only 
begin 
with 
a PRIME 
ending 
in a “1.” 
There 
is only 
a sin- 
gle sexy quintuplet, 
(5, 11, 17, 23, 29), since every fifth 
number 
of the form 6~k 
1 is divisible 
by 5, and therefore 
cannot

Sharing 
Problem 
A problem 
also known 
as the POINTS PROBLEM or UN- 
FINISHED GAME. 
Consider 
a tournament 
involving 
k 
players 
playing 
the same game 
repetitively. 
Each 
game 
has a single 
winner, 
and 
denote 
the number 
of games 
won by player 
i at some juncture 
wi. The 
games 
are in- 
dependent, 
and the probability 
of the ith player 
winning 
a game 
is pi. 
The 
tournament 
is specified 
to continue 
until 
one player 
has won n games. 
If the tournament 
is 
discontinued 
before 
any player 
has won n games 
so that 
wi < n for i = 1, . . . , k, how should 
the prize 
money 
be shared 
in order 
to distribute 
it proportionally 
to the 
players’ 
chances 
of winning? 
For player 
i, call the number 
of games 
left to win Q = 
n- 
wi > 0 the “quota.” 
For two players, 
let p = p1 and 
q = pz = I - p be the probabilities 
of winning 
a single 
game, 
and 
a E ~1 = n - w1 and b = ~2 = n - w2 be 
the number 
of games 
needed 
for each player 
to win the 
tournament. 
Then 
the stakes 
should 
be divided

Shuffle 
The 
randomization 
of a deck 
of CARDS 
by repeated 
interleaving. 
More 
generally, 
a shuffle 
is a rearrange- 
ment 
of the 
elements 
in an ordered 
list. 
Shuffling 
by 
exactly 
interleaving 
two halves of a deck is called 
a RIF- 
FLE SHUFFLE. 
Normal 
shuffling 
leaves gaps of different 
lengths 
between 
the two layers 
of cards and so random- 
izes the order 
of the cards. 
A deck of 52 CARDS 
must 
be shuffled 
seven times 
for it 
to be randomized 
(Aldous 
and Diaconis 
1986, Bayer 
and 
Diaconis 
1992). 
This 
is intermediate 
between 
too 
few 
shuffles 
and the 
decreasing 
effectiveness 
of many 
shuf- 
fles. 
One 
of Bayer 
and 
Diaconis’s 
randomness 
CRITE- 
RIA, 
however, 
gives 
3 Ig k/2 
shuffles 
for a k-card 
deck, 
yielding 
U-12 
shuffles 
for 52 CARDS. 
Keller 
(1995) 
shows that 
roughly 
Ink: shuffles 
are needed 
just 
to ran- 
domize 
the bottom 
card.

Siegel’s 
Paradox 
If a fixed 
FRACTION 
or: of a given 
amount 
of money 
P is 
lost, 
and then 
the same FRACTION z of the remaining 
amount 
is gained, 
the result 
is less than 
the original 
and 
equal to the final amount 
if a FRACTION II= is first gained, 
then 
lost. 
This 
can easily 
be seen from 
the fact that 
[P(l- 
x)](l+ 
2) = P(1 
- x2) < P 
[P(l+ 
x)1(1-

Find

Continue

The 
numbers 
remaining 
are PRIME. 
This 
procedure 
is illus- 
trated 
in the above 
diagram 
which 
sieves up to 50, and 
therefore 
crosses out 
PRIMES 
up to 
1 mI 
= 7. If the 
procedure 
is then 
continued 
up-to 
r~r then 
the number 
of cross-outs 
gives the number 
of distinct 
PRIME 
factors 
of each number.

Let

a g-algebra 
F is a nonempty 
collection 
of SUBSETS of X such that 
the following 
hold: 
1. The EMPTY SET isin 
F. 
2. If A is in F, then 
so is the complement 
of A. 
3. If 
A, 
is a SEQUENCE 
of elements 
of F, then 
the 
UNION of the A,s is in F. 
If S is any collection 
of subsets 
of X, then 
we can always 
find a g-algebra 
containing 
S, namely 
the POWER SET 
of X. 
By taking 
the INTERSECTION 
of all c-algebras

S, we obtain 
the smallest

We

Significant 
Digits 
When 
a number 
is expressed 
in SCIENTIFIC 
NOTATION, 
the number 
of significant 
figures 
is the number 
of DIG- 
ITS needed 
to express 
the number 
to within 
the uncer- 
tainty 
of measurement. 
For example, 
if a quantity 
had 
been 
measured 
to be 1.234 * 0.002, 
four figures 
would 
be significant. 
No more 
figures 
should 
be given 
than 
are allowed 
by the uncertainty. 
For example, 
a quantity 
written 
as 1.234 * 0.1 is incorrect; 
it should 
really 
be 
written 
as 1.2 * 0.1. 
The number 
of significant 
figures 
of a MULTIPLICATION 
or DIVISION 
of two or more 
quantities 
is equal 
to the 
smallest 
number 
of significant 
figures 
for the quantities 
involved. 
For ADDITION 
or MULTIPLICATION, 
the num- 
ber of significant 
figures 
is determined 
with the smallest 
significant 
figure 
of all the quantities 
involved. 
For ex- 
ample, 
the sum 10.234 + 5.2 + 100.3234 
is 115.7574, 
but 
should 
be written 
115.8 (with 
rounding), 
since the quan- 
tity 
5.2 is significant 
only 
to *O.l.

Also

If two

ILAR 
figures 
lie in the plane 
but 
do not 
have parallel 
sides (they 
are not 
HOMOTHETIC), 
there 
exists 
a cen- 
ter of similitude 
which 
occupies 
the 
same 
homologous 
position 
with 
respect 
to the two figures. 
The 
LOCUS 
of 
similitude 
centers 
of two nonconcentric 
circles is another 
circle having 
the line joining 
the two homothetic 
centers 
as its DIAMETER. 
There 
are a number 
of interesting 
theorems 
regarding 
three 
CIRCLES 
(Johnson 
1929, pp. 151-152). 
The 
external 
similitude 
centers 
of three 
circles 
are 
COLLINEAR. 
Any 
two internal 
similitude 
centers 
are COLLINEAR 
with 
the third 
external 
one. 
If the center 
of each circle 
is connected 
with 
the in- 
ternal 
similitude 
center 
of the other 
three 
[sic], the 
connectors 
are CONCURRENT. 
If one center 
is connected 
with 
the 
internal 
simil- 
itude 
center 
of the 
other 
two, 
the others 
with 
the 
corresponding 
external 
centers, 
the 
connectors 
are 
CONCURRENT.

Two

are HOMOTHETIC 
if they 
are related 
by a 
DILATION 
(a dilation 
is also known 
as a HOMOTHECY). 
This 
means 
that

Simple 
harmonic 
motion 
refers to the periodic 
sinusoidal 
oscillation 
of an object 
or quantity. 
Simple 
harmonic 
motion 
is executed 
by any quantity 
obeying 
the 
DIF- 
FERENTIAL EQUATION 
55 + wo2z = 0, 
(1) 
where 
5 denotes 
the second 
DERIVATIVE 
of z with 
re- 
spect to t, and wo is the angular 
frequency 
of oscillation. 
This 
ORDINARY 
DIFFERENTIAL 
EQUATION 
has an irreg- 
ular 
SINGULARITY 
at 00. The 
general 
solution 
is 
LC = Asin 
+ Bcos(wot) 
(2) 
= Ccos(wot 
+ @, 
(3) 
where 
the 
two constants 
A and 
B 
(or C and 
4) are 
determined 
from 
the initial 
conditions. 
Many 
physical 
systems 
undergoing 
small 
displacements, 
including 
any objects 
obeying 
Hooke’s 
law, exhibit 
sim- 
ple harmonic 
motion. 
This 
equation 
arises, for example, 
in the analysis 
of the 
flow of current 
in an electronic 
CL 
circuit 
(which 
contains 
a capacitor 
and 
an induc- 
tor). 
If a damping 
force such as Friction 
is present, 
an 
additional 
term 
pli: must 
be added 
to the DIFFERENTIAL 
EQUATION 
and motion 
dies out over time. 
Adding 
a damping 
force proportional 
to 5, the first de- 
rivative 
of 61; with respect 
to time, 
the equation 
of motion 
for damped 
simple 
harmonic 
motion 
is 
2 + p2 + “02Z 
= 0, 
(4 
where p is the damping 
constant. 
This 
equation 
arises, 
for example, 
in the 
analysis 
of the flow of current 
in 
an electronic 
CLR 
circuit, 
(which 
contains 
a capacitor, 
an inductor, 
and a resistor). 
This 
ORDINARY 
DIFFER- 
ENTIAL EQUATION can be solved 
by looking 
for trial 
solutions 
of the 
form 
2 = 
ert. 
Plugging 
this 
into

gives 
(r2 + @r + uo2)ert

r2 + pr + Ldo2 = 0.

The

2. a=

critically

3. or < 0 is NEGATIVE:

If a periodic 
(sinusoidal)

term 
is added 
at angular 
frequency 
w, the same 
three

regimes 
are again 
obtained. 
Surprisingly, 
the resulting

is still 
pe- 
riodic 
(after 
an initial 
transient 
response, 
corresponding 
to the solution 
to the unforced 
case, has died out), 
but it 
has an amplitude 
different 
from 
the forcing

Critical

The above

The

(A, B) = (l,O), 
the dot-dashed 
for (0, l), and the dotted 
for (l/2,

In order

use of the identity - p(t)

(t>

(16) 
Since we have p(t)

dt simplifies 
to eB2Y

becomes

We are interested 
in the realsolutions. 
Since we are deal- 
ing 
here with 
a linear 
homogeneous 
ODE, 
linear 
sums 
of LINEARLY INDEPENDENT solutions 
are also solutions. 
Since we have a sum of such solutions 
in (64), it follows 
that 
the IMAGINARY and REAL PARTS separately 
satisfy 
the ODE 
and are therefore 
the solutions 
we seek. 
The 
constant 
in front 
of the sine term 
is arbitrary,

identify 
the solutions 
as 
x1 = e-(P’2)t cos(yt)

Simplex 
Method 
A method 
for solving 
problems 
in LINEAR 
PROGRAM- 
MING. 
This 
method, 
invented 
by G. B. Dantzig 
in 1947, 
runs along 
EDGES 
of the visualization 
SOLID 
to find the 
best answer. 
In 1970, 
Klee 
and Minty 
constructed 
ex- 
amples 
in which 
the simplex 
method 
required 
an expo- 
nential 
number 
of steps, 
but 
such cases seem never 
to 
be encountered 
in practical 
applications. 
A muchmoreefficient 
(POLYNOMIAL-time) 
ALGORITHM 
was 
found 
in 1984 by N. Karma&r. 
This 
method 
goes 
through 
the middle 
of the 
SOLID 
and then 
transforms 
and warps. 
It offers many 
advantages 
over the simplex 
method 
(Nemirovsky 
and Yudin 
1994).

Objects

When

defining 
HOMOLOGY 
is particularly

in fact, combinatorial 
because 
of its finite/counting

A CONNECTED 
DOMAIN 
is said to be simply 
connected 
(also called 
l-connected) 
if any simple 
closed curve 
can 
be shrunk 
to a point 
continuously 
in the set. 
If the 
domain 
is CONNECTED 
but 
not 
simply, 
it is said to be 
MULTIPLY 
CONNECTED. 
A SPACE S is simply 
connected 
if it is O-connected 
and 
if every MAP 
from 
the ~-SPHERE 
to S extends 
continu- 
ously 
to a MAP 
from 
the Z-DISK. 
In other 
words, every 
loop 
in the SPACE is contractible.

Simson 
Line 
The 
Simson 
line 
is the LINE containing 
the feet of the 
perpendiculars 
from 
a point 
on the CIRCUMCIRCLE of 
a TRIANGLE 
to the 
sides 
(or their 
extensions) 
of the 
TRIANGLE. 
The 
Simson 
line is sometimes 
known 
as the 
WALLACE-SIMSON LINE, since it does not appear 
in any 
work of Simson 
(Johnson 
1929, p. 137). 
The ANGLE between 
the Simson 
lines 
of two points 
P 
and P’ 
is half the ANGLE of the arc PP’. 
The 
Simson 
line of any VERTEX is the ALTITUDE through 
that 
VER- 
TEX. The 
Simson 
line 
of a point 
opposite 
a VERTEX is 
the corresponding 
side. 
If !FlTz5?3 is the Simson 
line of a 
pqint 
T of the CIRCUMCIRCLE, then the triangles 
T5F1~2 
and TA2Al 
are directly 
similar.

Singular 
Point 
(Function) 
Singular 
points 
(also 
simply 
called 
“singularities”) 
are 
points 
zo in the 
DOMAIN 
of a FUNCTION 
f 
where 
f 
fails to be ANALYTIC. 
ISOLATED SINGULARITIES may 
be classified 
as ESSENTIAL SINGULARITIES, POLES, or 
REMOVABLE SINGULARITIES. 
ESSENTIAL SINGULARITIES 
der. 
are PoLES of 
INFINITE 
or- 
A POLE 
of order 
n is a singularity 
zo of f(z) 
for which 
the function 
(z - zo)“f( 
z is nonsingular 
and for which 
) 
( z - zo)kf(z) 
is singular 
for k = 0, 1, . . , , 72 - 1. 
REMOVABLE SINGULARITIES are singularities 
for which 
it is possible 
to assign 
a COMPLEX NUMBER in such a 
way that 
f(z) 
b ecomes 
ANALYTIC. 
For example, 
the 
function 
f(z) 
= X"/Z has a REMOVABLE SINGULARITY 
at 0, since f(z) 
= z everywhere 
but 
0, and f(z) 
can be 
set equal 
to 0 at z = 0. REMOVABLE SINGULARITIES are 
not POLES. 
The 
function 
f(z) 
= 
csc(l/z) 
has POLES at 
z 
= 
1/(2rn), 
and a nonisolated 
singularity 
at 0.

A method

directly 
from

of the

The 
method 
is effec- 
tive 
and 
easily 
implemented, 
but 
usually 
slower 
than 
ZEILBERGER'S 
ALGORITHM. 
Given 
a sum

proceeding 
as follows 
(Petkovgek 
et al. 1996, p, 59): 
Fix trial 
values 
of I and J. 
Assume 
a recurrence 
formula 
of the 
above 
form 
where 
a&) 
are to be solved 
for. 
Divide 
each 
term 
of the 
assumed 
recurrence 
by 
F(n, 
k) and reduce 
every ratio 
F(n-j, 
k -i)/F(n, 
k) 
by simplifying 
the ratios 
of its constituent 
factorials 
so that 
only 
RATIONAL 
FUNCTIONS 
in n and

main. 
Put 
the resulting 
expression 
over a common 
DENOM- 
INATOR, then 
collect 
the numerator 
as a POLYNOM- 
IAL in k:. 
Solve the system 
of linear 
equations 
that 
results 
af- 
ter setting 
the coefficients 
of each power 
of k in the 
NUMERATOR to 0 for the unknown 
coefficients

If no solution 
results, 
start 
again 
with

Under 
suitable 
hypotheses, 
a “fundamental 
theorem” 
(Verbaten 
1974, Wilf 
and Zeilberger 
1992, Petkovgek 
et 
al. 1996) guarantees 
that 
this algorithm 
always succeeds 
for large enough 
1 and J (which 
can be estimated 
in ad- 
vance). 
The 
theorem 
also generalizes 
to multivariate 
sums 
and to q- and multi-q-sums

1992, PetkovSek

Siteswap 
A siteswap 
is a sequence 
encountered 
in JUGGLING 
in 
which 
each term 
is a POSITIVE integer, 
encoded 
in BI- 
NARY. The 
transition 
rule 
from 
one term 
to the next 
consists 
of changing 
some 0 to 1, subtracting 
1, and then 
dividing 
by 2, with 
the constraint 
that 
the DIVISION 
by 
two must 
be exact. 
Therefore, 
if a term 
is EVEN, the bit 
to be changed 
must 
be the units 
bit. 
In siteswaps, 
the 
number 
of l-bits 
is a constant. 
Each 
transition 
is characterized 
by the bit 
position 
of 
the toggled 
bit 
(denoted 
here by the numeral 
on top of 
the arrow). 
For example, 
111~10011~10115‘10101L1011~111 
~1000113\10101~1110~1114-r1011.. 
. 
The 
second 
term 
is given 
from 
the 
first 
as follows: 
000111 
with 
bit 
5 flipped 
becomes 
100111, 
or 39. 
Sub- 
tract 
1 to obtain 
38 and 
divide 
by two to obtain 
19, 
which 
is 10011.

Skewness 
The degree 
of asymmetry 
of a distribution. 
If the distri- 
bution 
has a longer 
tail 
less than 
the 
maximum, 
the 
function 
has NEGATIVE skewness. 
Otherwise, 
it has 
POSITIVE skewness. 
Several 
types 
of skewness 
are de- 
fined. 
The FISHER SKEWNESS is defined 
by 
Sklar’s 
Theorem 
Let H be a 2-D distribution 
function 
with 
marginal 
dis- 
tribution 
functions 
F and G. Then 
there 
exists 
a COP- 
ULA G such that

p1 
(1) 
where ~3 is the third 
MOMENT, and 
~2~‘~ 
E 0 is the 
STANDARD DEVIATION. 
The 
PEARSON SKEWNESS 
is 
defined 
by 
p1 = (5)’ 
=y12. 
The 
MOMENTAL 
SKEWNESS is defined 
by 
(2 
H(x, Y> = W(x)7 
G(Y)>-

Conversely, 
for any univariate 
distribution 
functions 
F 
and 
G and 
any COPULA C, the 
function 
H 
is a two- 
dimensional 
distribution 
function 
with 
marginals 
F and 
G. 
Furthermore, 
if F and G are continuous, 
then 
C is 
unique.

The

Smale 
Horseshoe 
Map 
The 
basic topological 
operations 
for constructing 
an AT- 
TRACTOR consist 
of stretching 
(which 
gives sensitivity 
to 
initial 
conditions) 
and folding 
(which 
gives the attrac- 
tion). 
Since 
trajectories 
in PHASE SPACE cannot 
cross, 
the repeated 
stretching 
and folding 
operations 
result 
in 
an object 
of great 
topological 
complexity. 
The 
Smale 
horseshoe 
map 
consists 
of a sequence 
of op- 
erations 
on the unit 
square. 
First, 
stretch 
by a factor 
of 
2 in the CC direction, 
then 
compress 
by 2a in the y direc- 
tion. 
Then, 
fold 
the rectangle 
and fit it back 
into 
the 
square. 
Repeating 
this 
generates 
the horseshoe 
attrac- 
tor. 
If one looks 
at a cross-section 
of the final 
structure, 
it is seen to correspond 
to a CANTOR SET.

Smarandache 
Near-to-Primorial 
Function 
SNTP(n) 
is the smallest 
PRIME 
such that 
p# - 1, p#, 
or p# + 1 is divisible 
by n, where p# 
is the PRIMORIAL 
of p. 
Ashbacher 
(1996) 
shows that 
SNTP(n) 
only exists 
1. If there are no square 
or higher 
powers in the factor- 
ization 
of n, or 
2. If there 
exists 
a PRIME 
Q < 
p such that 
nl(q# 
* 
l), 
where 
p is the 
smallest 
power 
contained 
in the 
factorization 
of n. 
Therefore, 
SNTP(n) 
d oes not exist 
for the SQUAREFUL 
numbers 
n 
= 
4, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 20, 24, 25, 27, 28, . . . 
(Sloane’s 
A002997) 
The 
first 
few values 
of SNTP(n), 
where 
defined, 
are 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 5, 7, . . . (Sloane’s

Smarandache 
Paradox 
Let 
A be some 
attribute 
(e.g., 
possible, 
present, 
per- 
fect, etc.). 
If all is A, then 
the non-A 
must 
also be A. 
For example, 
“All 
is possible, 
the impossible 
too,” 
and 
“Nothing 
is perfect, 
not even the perfect.”

Smith 
Number 
A COMPOSITE 
NUMBER 
the 
SUM 
of whose 
DIGITS 
is 
the 
sum 
of the DIGITS 
of its PRIME 
factors 
(excluding 
1). (The 
PRIMES 
are excluded 
since they trivially 
satisfy 
this 
condition). 
One example 
of a Smith 
number 
is the 
BEAST 
NUMBER 
666 = 2 .3 - 3 - 37, 
since 
6+6+6=2+3+3+(3+7)=18. 
Another 
Smith 
number 
is 
4937775 
= 3 
l 5.5 
- 65837, 
since 
4+9+3+7+7+7+5 
= 3+5+5+(6+5+8+3+7) 
= 42. 
The 
first 
few Smith 
numbers 
are 4, 22, 
27, 
58, 
85, 
94,

(Sloane’s

There 
are 360 Smith 
numbers 
less than 
lo4 
and 29,928 
2 106. 
McDaniel 
(1987a) 
showed 
that 
an 
infinite 
number 
exist. 
Smooth 
Number 
A generalized 
&Smith 
number 
can also be defined 
as 
a number 
m 
satisfying 
Sp(m) 
= 
M(m), 
where 
SP is 
the 
sum 
of prime 
factors 
and 
S is the sum 
of digits. 
There 
are 47 l-Smith 
numbers, 
21 2-Smith 
numbers, 
three 
3-Smith 
numbers, 
and one 7-Smith, 
g-Smith, 
and 
14-Smith 
number 
< 1000. 
A Smith 
number 
can be constructed 
from every factored 
REPUNIT 
R,. 
The 
largest 
known 
Smith

is

Smooth 
Manifold 
Another 
word for a Coo (infinitely 
differentiable) 
MAN- 
IFOLD. 
A smooth 
manifold 
is a TOPOLOGICAL 
MANI- 
FOLD together 
with 
its 
“functional 
structure” 
(Bredon 
1995) 
and 
so differs 
from 
a TOPOLOGICAL 
MANIFOLD 
because 
the notion 
of differentiability 
exists on it. Every 
smooth 
manifoldisa 
TOPOLOGICAL 
MANIFOLD, 
but not 
necessarily 
vice versa* 
(The 
first nonsmooth 
TOPOLOG- 
ICAL 
MANIFOLD 
occurs in 4-D.) 
In 1959, Milnor 
showed 
that 
a 7-D 
HYPERSPHERE 
can be made 
into 
a smooth 
manifold 
in 28 ways.

Smooth 
Number 
An INTEGER 
is k-smooth 
ifit 
has no PRIME 
FACTORS 
> k. The probability 
that 
a random 
POSITIVE 
INTEGER 
5 n is k-smooth 
is $(n, 
Ii)/ n, where 
$(n, 
k) is the num- 
ber of k-smooth 
numbers 
< n. This 
fact is important 
in

because 
it is related 
to the num- 
ber of random 
numbers 
which 
must 
be examined 
to find 
a suitable 
subset 
whose product 
is a square. 
Since 
about 
r(k) 
J& smooth 
numbers 
must 
be found 
(where 
n(k) 
is the 
PRIME 
COUNTING 
FUNCTION), 
the 
number 
of random 
numbers 
which 
must 
be examined 
is about 
n(k)n/qb(n, 
k). 
But 
because 
it 
takes 
about 
r(k) 
steps to determine 
if a number 
is k-smooth 
using 
TRIAL 
DIVISION, 
the expected 
number 
of steps needed 
to find 
a subset 
of numbers 
whose product 
is a square 
is - [~(~>]2n/$(w 
(P omerance 
1996). 
Canfield 
et al. 
(1983) 
showed 
that 
this function 
is minimized 
when 
k - exp(+Jlnnlnlnn) 
and that 
the minimum 
value 
is about 
exp(2dlnnlnlnn).

Choice 
Theory 
The 
theory 
of analyzing 
a decision 
between 
a collection 
of alternatives 
made 
by a collection 
of n voters with 
sep- 
arate 
opinions. 
Any 
choice 
for the entire 
group 
should 
reflect 
the desires 
of the individual 
voters 
to the extent 
possible. 
Fair 
choice 
procedures 
usually 
satisfy 
ANONYMITY 
(in- 
variance 
under 
permutation 
of voters), 
DUALITY 
(each 
alternative 
receives 
equal 
weight 
for a single 
vote), 
and 
MONOTONICITY 
(a change 
favorable 
for X does not hurt

Given 
three

points 
A, B, and C, let three 
CIR- 
CLES be drawn, 
one centered 
about 
each point 
and each 
one tangent 
to the other 
two. 
Call the RADII 
pi (~3 = a', 
r1 = b', r2 = c’). 
Then 
the CIRCLES 
satisfy 
a’ + b’ = c 
(1) 
a’ + c’ = b 
(2) 
b’ + cl = a, 
(3) 
as shown in the diagram 
below.

for the RADII 
then

As can be seen from 
the first figure, 
there 
exist 
exactly 
two nonintersecting 
CIRCLES which 
are TANGENT to all 
three 
CIRCLES. 
These 
are called 
the inner 
and 
outer 
Soddy 
circles 
(S and S’, respectively), 
and their 
centers 
are called 
the inner 
and outer 
SODDY POINTS. 
The 
inner 
Soddy 
circle 
is the 
solution 
to the 
FOUR 
COWS PROBLEM. The 
center 
S of the inner 
Soddy 
cir- 
cle is the EQUAL DETOUR POINT, and 
the 
center 
of 
the outer 
Soddy 
circle S' is the ISOPERIMETRIC POINT 
(Kimberling 
1994). 
Frederick 
Soddy 
(1936) 
gave the FORMULA for finding 
the RADII 
of the Soddy 
circles 
(~4) given 
the RAW ri 
(i = 1, 2, 3) of the other 
three. 
The 
relationship 
is 
2(Q2 
+ 
E22 
+c32 
+ 
E42) 
= 
(El 
+ 
E2 
+E3 
+E4)2, 
(14) 
where 
ei E &ni 
= fl/ri 
are the so-called 
BENDS, de- 
fined 
as the signed 
CURVATURES of the CIRCLES. If the 
contacts 
are all external, 
the signs are all taken 
as POS- 
ITIVE, whereas 
if one circle 
surrounds 
the other 
three, 
the 
sign of this 
circle 
is taken 
as NEGATIVE (Coxeter 
1969). 
Using 
the QUADRATIC FORMULA to solve for c4, 
expressing 
in terms 
of radii 
instead 
of curvatures, 
and 
simplifying 
gives 
f 
TlT2T3 
r4 
= 
T2T3 
+7'&'2 
+7'3)f 
2 
IT2r3(T1 
+T2 
+ 
f3)' 
(15) 
Here, 
the NEGATIVE solution 
corresponds 
to the outer 
Soddy 
circle 
and the P~SITXVE one to the inner 
Soddy 
circle. 
This 
FORMULA 
is called 
the DESCARTES CIRCLE THE- 
OREM since it was known 
to Descartes. 
However, 
Soddy 
also extended 
it to SPHERES. Gosper 
has further 
ex- 
tended 
the result 
to n + 2 mutually 
tangent 
n-D 
HY- 
PERSPHERES, whose CURVATURES satisfy 
For (at least) 
n = 2 and 3, the RADICAL equals 
where V is the CONTENT of the SIMPLEX whose vertices 
are the centers 
of the n+ 
1 independent 
HYPERSPHERES. 
The RADICAND can also become 
NEGATIVE, yielding 
an 
IMAGINARY fin+l. 
For 
n = 
3, this 
corresponds 
to a 
sphere 
touching 
three 
large 
bowling 
balls 
and 
a small 
BB, 
all mutually 
tangent, 
which 
is an impossibility. 
I3ellew 
has derived 
a generalization 
applicable 
to a CIR- 
CLE surrounded 
by n CIRCLES which 
are, in turn, 
cir- 
cumscribed 
by another 
CIRCLE. The 
relationship 
is 
[ ( 
n ~,-l)~+l]$~~+n(3n~~~-2n-6)~,~(~,_1)~ 
= 
i=l 
1 
[ ( 
n cn - 1) + II2 x {n(c, - 1)” + l] x 
Ki 
-- 
z- 1 
+ncn(cn 
- l)(ncn2 
+ (3 - n)c, 
- 4])}, 
(19) 
where 
G-b = csc 
T 
. 
( 
> 
n 
(20) 
For 72 = 3, this simplifies 
to the Soddy 
formula.

Solenoidal 
Field 
A solenoidal 
VECTOR 
FIELD 
satisfies 
V-B=0 
(1) 
for every VECTOR 
B, where V-B 
is the DIVERGENCE. 
If 
this condition 
is satisfied, 
there exists a vector 
A, known 
as the VECTOR 
POTENTIAL, 
such that 
B=VxA 
1 
(2) 
where 
V x A is the CURL. 
This 
follows 
from 
the vector 
identity 
V-B= 
V.(Vx 
A) =O. 
(3) 
If A is an IRROTATIONAL 
FIELD, 
then

If u and v are irrotational, 
then

The 
quantity 
where 
Vu 
function

is the GRADIENT, is always 
solenoidal. 
For a

it 
follows 
that

All

Schoutte

showed that 
the 27 lines can be put into

correspondence 
with 
the 
vertices 
of a 
particular 
POLYTOPE in 6-D space in such a manner 
that 
all incidence 
relations 
between 
the lines are mirrored 
in 
the connectivity 
of the POLYTOPE and 
conversely 
(Du

A similar 
correspondence 
can be made 
be- 
tween the 28 bitangents 
and a 7-D POLYTOPE (Coxeter 
1928) 
and between 
the tritangent

Solvable 
Group 
A solvable 
group 
is a group 
whose composition 
indices 
are all PRIME NUMBERS. Equivalently, 
a solvable 
is a 
GROUP having 
a “normal 
series” 
such that 
each 
“nor- 
mal factor” 
is ABELIAN. The term 
solvable 
derives 
from 
this type of group’s 
relationship 
to GALOIS'S THEOREM, 
namely 
that 
the SYMMETRIC 
GROUP S, is insoluble 
for 
n > 5 while 
it is solvable 
for n = 1, 2, 3, and 4. As a 
- 
result, 
the POLYNOMIAL equations 
of degree 
2 5 are not 
solvable 
using finite 
additions, 
multiplications, 
divisions, 
and root 
extractions.

Sophie 
Germain 
Prime 
A PRIME 
p is said to be a Sophie 
Germain 
prime 
if both 
p and 2p + 1 are PRIME. 
The 
first few Sophie 
Germain 
primes 
are 2, 3, 5, 11, 23, 29, 41, 53, 83, 89, 113, 131, 
. . . (Sloane’s 
A005384). 
Around 
1825, Sophie 
Germain 
proved 
that 
the first case 
of FERMAT'S 
LAST 
THEOREM 
is true 
for such primes, 
i.e., 
if p is a Sophie 
Germain 
prime, 
there 
do not exist 
INTEGERS 
x, y, and z different 
from 0 and not multiples 
of p such that 
xp+yp=zp. 
Sophie 
Germain 
primes 
p of the 
form 
p = 
k . 2n - 
1 (which 
makes 
2p + 1 a PRIME) 
are 
COMPOSITE 
MERSENNE 
NUMBERS. 
Since 
the largest 
known 
COM- 
POSITE 
MERSENNE 
NUMBER 
is AI, 
with 
p = 39051 
x

Sorites 
Paradox 
Sorites 
paradoxes 
are a class of paradoxical 
arguments 
also 
known 
as little-by-little 
arguments. 
The 
name 
“sorites” 
derives 
from 
the 
Greek 
word 
sores, 
meaning 
“pile” 
or “heap” 
. Sorites 
paradoxes 
are exemplified 
by 
the problem 
that 
a single 
grain 
of wheat 
does not com- 
prise 
a heap, 
nor do two grains 
of wheat, 
three 
grains 
of wheat, 
etc 
However, 
at some 
point, 
the 
collection 
of grains 
becomes 
large 
enough 
to be called 
a heap, 
but 
there 
is apparently 
no definite 
point 
where this 
occurs.

Sorting 
is the rearrangement 
of numbers 
(or other 
or- 
derable 
objects) 
in a list into 
their 
correct 
lexographic 
order. 
Alphabetization 
is therefore 
a form 
of sorting. 
Because 
of the extreme 
importance 
of sorting 
in almost 
all database 
applications, 
a great 
deal of effort 
has been 
expended 
in the creation 
and analysis 
of efficient 
sorting 
algorithms.

Space 
The concept 
of a space is an extremely 
general 
and im- 
portant 
mathematical 
construct. 
Members 
of the space 
obey 
certain 
addition 
properties. 
Spaces 
which 
have 
been investigated 
and found 
to be of interest 
are usually 
named 
after 
one or more 
of their 
investigators. 
This 
practice 
unfortunately 
leads 
to names 
which 
give very 
little 
insight 
into the relevant 
properties 
of a given space. 
One of the most 
general 
type 
of mathematical 
spaces is 
the TOPOLOGICAL SPACE.

Curve 
A curve which may pass through

of 3-D space, 
as contrasted 
to a PLANE 
CURVE which 
must 
lie in a 
single PLANE. Von Staudt 
(1847) 
classified 
space curves 
geometrically 
by considering 
the curve

at to = 0 and assuming 
that 
the parametric 
functions 
q&(t) for i = I, 2, 3 are given 
by POWER SERIES which 
converge 
for small 
t. 
If the 
curve 
is contained 
in no 
PLANE for small 
t, then 
a coordinate 
transformation 
puts the parametric 
equations 
in the normal 
form 
for integers

Space-Filling 
Polyhedron 
A space-filling 
polyhedron 
is a POLYHEDRON which 
can 
be used to generate 
a TESSELLATION of space. 
There 
exists 
one 
16-sided 
space-filling 
POLYHEDRON, but 
it 
is unknown 
if this 
is the 
unique 
f6-sided 
space-filler. 
The 
CUBE, RHOMBIC 
DODECAHEDRON, 
and 
TRUN- 
CATED OCTAHEDRON are space-fillers, as are the ELON- 
GATED DODECAHEDRON and hexagonal 
PRISM. These 
five solids are all “primary” 
PARALLELOHEDRA (Coxeter 
1973). 
P. Schmitt 
discovered 
a nonconvex 
aperiodic 
polyhedral 
space-filler 
around 
1990, 
and 
a convex 
POLYHEDRON 
known 
as the 
SCHMITT-CONWAY 
BIPRISM which 
fills 
space only 
aperiodically 
was found 
by J. H. Conway 
in 
1993 (Eppstein).

Spectrum 
(Operator) 
Let 
T be an OPERATOR on a HILBERT SPACE. The 
spectrum 
o(T) 
of T is the set of X such that 
(T - AI) 
is not 
invertible 
on all 
of the HILBERT SPACE, where 
the As are COMPLEX NUMBERS and I is the IDENTITY 
OPERATOR. The 
definition 
can also be stated 
in terms 
of the resolvent 
of an operator 
p(T) 
= {X : (T - x1) is invertible}, 
and then 
the spectrum 
is defined 
to be the complement 
of p(T) 
in the COMPLEX PLANE. The 
reason 
for doing 
this 
is that 
it is easy to demonstrate 
that 
p(T) 
is an 
OPEN SET, which 
shows that 
the spectrum 
is closed.

A sphere 
is defined 
as the set of all points 
in R3 which 
are a distance 
T (the 
4‘R~~~~~77) 
from 
a given 
point 
(the 
“CENTER”‘)~ 
Twice 
the RADIUS 
is called 
the DIAMETER, 
and pairs 
of points 
on opposite 
sides of a DIAMETER 
are 
called 
ANTIPODES. 
The 
term 
“sphere” 
technically 
refers 
to the outer 
surface of a “BUBBLE,” 
which is denoted 
!?. 
However, 
in common 
usage, the word sphere is also used 
to mean 
the 
UNION 
of a sphere 
and 
its INTERIOR 
(a 
“solid 
sphere”), 
where 
the 
INTERIOR 
is called 
a BALL. 
The 
SURFACE 
AREA 
of the sphere 
and VOLUME 
of the 
BALL 
of RADIUS 
T are given 
by 
RADIUS 
T, then 
a solid 
BALL 
is obtained.

The generalization 
of a sphere 
in 72 dimensions 
is called 
a 
HYPERSPHERE.

Xl2 + Q2 + . . . + xn2 = T2.

The 
distribution 
of ANGLES 
for random 
rotation 
of a 
sphere 
is 
P(0) 
= 2 sin’(iQ), 
7T 
(25) 
giving 
a MEAN 
of n/2 
+ 217~ 
To pick 
a random 
point 
on the surface of a sphere, 
let u 
and v be random 
variates 
on [0, 11. Then 
0 = 27ru 
(26) 
4 
-1 
= 
cos 
(2 v - 1). 
(27) 
This 
works since the SOLID 
ANGLE 
is 
dSt = sin 4 de d+ = d0 d(cos 4). 
(28) 
Another 
easy way to pick 
a random 
point 
on a SPHERE 
is to generate 
three 
gaussian 
random 
variables 
2, y, and 
z. Then 
the distribution 
of the vectors 
1 
d x2 + y2 + x2 
X [I 
Y z 
(29) 
is uniform 
over the surface 
s2. 
Another 
method 
is to 
pick 
z from 
a UNIFORM 
DISTRIBUTION 
over [-l,l] 
and 
0 from 
a UNIFORM 
DISTRIBUTION 
over 
[0,2~). 
Then 
the points 
(30) 
are uniformly 
distributed 
over S2. 
Pick 
four points 
on a sphere. 
What 
is the probability 
that 
the 
TETRAHEDRON 
having 
these 
points 
as VER- 
TICES 
contains 
the CENTER 
of the sphere? 
In the 1-D 
case, the probability 
that 
a second point 
is on the oppo- 
site side of l/2 
is l/2. 
In the 2-D case, pick 
two points. 
In order 
for the 
third 
to form 
a TRIANGLE 
containing 
the CENTER, 
it must 
lie in the quadrant 
bisected 
by a 
LINE 
SEGMENT 
passing 
through 
the center 
of the CIR- 
CLE and the bisector 
of the two points. 
This 
happens 
for one QUADRANT, 
so the probability 
is l/4. 
Similarly, 
for a sphere 
the probability 
is one OCTANT, 
or l/8. 
Pick 
two points 
at random 
on a unit 
sphere. 
The 
first 
one can be assigned 
the 
coordinate 
(0, 0, 1) without 
loss of generality. 
The 
second 
point 
can be given 
the 
coordinates 
(sin 4, 0 cos 4) with 
8 E 0 since 
all 
points 
with the same 4 are rotationally 
identical. 
The distance 
between 
the two points 
is then 
T- 
COS~~)~ = &G&i 
= 2 sin( +$). 
(31) 
Because 
the surface 
AREA 
element 
is 
do = sin@dBd4, 
(32) 
the probability 
that 
two points 
are a distance 
T apart 
is

Sphere 
Eversion 
Smale 
(1958) 
proved 
that 
it is mathematically 
possible 
to turn 
a SPHERE 
inside-out 
without 
introducing 
a sharp 
crease at any point. 
This 
means 
there is a regular 
homo- 
topy 
from 
the standard 
embedding 
of the Z-SPHERE 
in 
EUCLIDEAN 3-space 
to the mirror-reflection 
embedding 
such that 
at every stage 
in the homotopy, 
the sphere is 
being 
IMMERSED in EUCLIDEAN SPACE. This 
result 
is 
so counterintuitive 
and 
the proof 
so technical 
that 
the 
result 
remained 
controversial 
for a number 
of years. 
In 1961, Arnold 
Shapiro 
devised 
an explicit 
eversion 
but 
did not publicize 
it. 
Phillips 
(1966) 
heard 
of the result 
and, in trying 
to reproduce 
it, actually 
devised 
an inde- 
pendent 
method 
of his own. 
Yet another 
eversion 
was 
devised 
by Morin, 
which 
became 
the basis for the movie 
by Max 
(1977). 
Morin’s 
eversion 
also produced 
explicit 
algebraic 
equations 
describing 
the process. 
The 
origi- 
nal 
method 
of Shapiro 
was subsequently 
published 
by 
Francis 
and Morin 
(1979).

Packing 
Let q denote 
the PACKING 
DENSITY, 
which 
is the frac- 
tion 
of a VOLUME 
filled 
by identical 
packed 
SPHERES. 
In 2-D (CIRCLE 
PACKING), 
there 
are two periodic 
pack- 
ings for identical 
CIRCLES: 
square 
lattice 
and hexagonal 
lattice. 
Fejes T&h 
(1940) 
proved 
that 
the hexagonal 
lat- 
tice is indeed 
the densest 
of all possible 
plane 
packings 
(Conway 
and Sloane 
1993, pp. 8-9). 
In 3-D, 
there 
are three 
periodic 
packings 
for identical 
spheres: 
cubic 
lattice, 
face-centered 
cubic 
lattice, 
and 
hexagonal 
lattice. 
It was hypothesized 
by Kepler 
in 1611 
that 
close packing 
(cubic 
or hexagonal) 
is the densest 
possible 
(has the greatest 
q), and this assertion 
is known 
as the KEPLER 
CONJECTURE. 
The 
problem 
of finding 
the densest 
packing 
of spheres 
(not necessarily 
periodic) 
is therefore 
known 
as the KEPLER 
PROBLEM. 
The KE- 
PLER 
CONJECTURE 
is intuitively 
obvious, 
but the proof 
still 
remains 
elusive. 
However, 
Gauss 
(1831) 
did prove 
that 
the face-centered 
cubic 
is the densest 
lattice 
pack- 
ing in 3-D (Conway 
and Sloane 
1993, p. 9). This 
result 
has since been extended 
to HY~ERSPHERE 
PACKING. 
In 3-D, face-centered 
cubic 
close packing 
and hexagonal 
close packing 
(which 
is distinct 
from 
hexagonal 
lattice), 
both 
give 
7r 
v=3Jz 
= 74.048%. 
(1) 
For packings 
in 3-D, C. A. Rogers 
(1958) 
showed 
that 
q < fi(cos-1 
5 - +) 
=z: 77.96355700% 
(2) 
(Le Lionnais 
1983). 
This 
was subsequently 
improved 
to 
77.844% 
(Lindsey 
1986), 
then 
77.836% 
(Muder 
1988). 
However, 
Rogers 
(1958) 
remarks 
that 
“many 
mathe- 
maticians 
believe, 
and all physicists 
know” 
that 
the ac- 
tual 
answer is 74.05% 
(C onway 
and Sloane 
1993, p. 3). 
“Random” 
close 
packing 
in 3-D 
gives 
only 
7 ==: 64% 
(Jaeger 
and Nagel 
1992).

Hexagonal 
close packing 
must give the same values, 
since 
sliding 
one sheet 
of SPHERES 
cannot 
affect the volume 
they 
occupy. 
To verify 
this, 
construct 
a 3-D diagram 
containing 
a hexagonal 
unit 
cell with 
three 
layers. 
Both 
the top 
and the 
bottom 
contain 
six l/6-SPHERES 
and 
one HEMISPHERE. 
The total 
number 
of spheres in these 
two rows is therefore 
2(6+ + 1;) 
= 3. 
(6) 
The 
VOLUME 
of SPHERES 
in the middle 
row 
cannot 
be 
simply 
computed 
using 
geometry. 
However, 
symmetry 
requires 
that 
the piece 
of the SPHERE 
which 
is cut off 
is exactly 
balanced 
by an extra 
piece on the other 
side. 
There 
are therefore 
three 
SPHERES 
in the middle

for a total 
of six, and a total

If we had actually

use the SPHERICAL CAP equation

The 
rigid 
packing 
with 
lowest density 
known 
has q z 
0.0555 
(Gardner 
1966). 
To be RIGID, 
each SPHERE 
must 
touch 
at least 
four others, 
and the four contact 
points 
cannot 
be in a single 
HEMISPHERE 
or all on one equator. 
If spheres 
packed 
in a cubic 
lattice, 
face-centered 
cu- 
bic lattice, 
and hexagonal 
lattice 
are allowed 
to expand, 
they 
form cubes, 
hexagonal 
prisms, 
and rhombic 
dodec- 
ahedra. 
Compressing 
a random 
packing 
gives polyhedra 
with 
an average 
of 13.3 faces (Coxeter 
1958, 
1961).

Let two spheres of RADII R and T be located 
along 
the X- 
AXIS centered 
at (O,O, 0) and (d, O,O), respectively. 
Not 
surprisingly, 
the analysis 
is very 
similar 
to the case of 

Sphere-Sphere 
Intersection 
Spherical Bessel Differential 
Equation 
1687 
the 
CIRCLE-CIRCLE 
INTERSECTION. 
The 
equations 
of 
the two SPHERES 
are 
x2 + y2 + x2 = R2 
(x - d)2 + y2 + z2 = r2. 
(1) 
(2) 
Combining 
(1) and (2) gives 
(x - d)2 + (R2 - x2) = r2. 
(3) 
Multiplying 
through 
and rearranging 
give 
x2 - 2dx + d2 -x2 
=r2-R2. 
(4) 
Solving 
for x gives 
d2 - r2+R2 
X= 
2d 
* 
(5) 
The 
intersection 
of the 
SPHERES 
is therefore 
a curve 
lying 
in a PLANE 
parallel 
to the yz-plane 
at a single 
x-coordinate. 
Plugging 
this back into 
(1) gives

(7) 
The 
VOLUME 
of the 
3-D 
LENS 
common 
to the 
two 
spheres 
can be found 
by adding 
the 
two 
SPHERICAL 
CAPS. 
The 
distances 
from 
the SPHERES' 
centers 
to the 
bases of the caps are 
dl = x 
d2 =d-x, 
(8) 
(9) 
so the heights 
of the caps are 
hl = R - dl = 
(T - R + d)(r 
+ R - d) 
2d 
(10) 
h2 = T - d2 = 
(R-r+d)(R+r-d) 
2d 
. 
(11) 
The 
VOLUME 
of a SPHERICAL 
CAP 
of height 
h’ for a 
SPHERE 
of RADIUS 
R’ is 
V(R’,h’) 
= $tht2(3R’ 
- h’). 
(12) 
Letting 
RI 
= R and R2 = T and summing 
the two caps 
gives 
V = V(&,h)+ 
V(R2,hz) 
T(R+ 
r - d)2(d2 
+ 2dr - 3r2 + 2dR + 6rR 
- 3R2) 
- - 
12d 
l 
(13) 
This 
expression 
gives V = 0 for d = T + R as it must. 
In the special 
case T = R, the VOLUME 
simplifies 
to 
V = +(4R 
+ d)(2R 
- d)2.

the force

Assume 
the

the standard

Cap 
A spherical 
cap is the region 
of a SPHERE which 
lies 
above 
(or below) 
a given 
PLANE. If the PLANE passes 
through 
the CENTER of the SPHERE, the cap is a HEMI- 
SPHERE. Let the SPHERE have RADIUS 
R, then the VOL- 
UME of a spherical 
cap of height 
h and base RADIUS a is

Unfortunately, 
the 
convention 
in which 
the symbols 
8 
and 4 are reversed 
is frequently 
used, especially 
in phys- 
ics, leading 
to unnecessary 
confusion. 
The 
symbol 
p is 
sometimes 
also used in place 
of T. Arfken 
(1985) 
uses 
(T, 4,0), 
whereas 
Beyer 
(1987) 
uses (p, 8,@. 
Be very 
careful 
when consulting 
the literature. 
In terms 
of the 
so-called 
CONTACT ANGLE (the 
angle 
between 
the normal 
to the sphere 
at the bottom 
of the 
cap and the base plane) 
R-h-Rsin0 
(6) 
In this 
work, 
the symbols 
for the azimuthal, 
polar, 
and 
radial 
coordinates 
are taken 
as 8, 4, and T, respectively. 
Note 
that 
this 
definition 
provides 
a logical 
extension 
of 
the 
usual 
POLAR COORDINATES notation, 
with 
8 re- 
maining 
the 
ANGLE 
in the Q-PLANE 
and 4 becoming 
the ANGLE out of the PLANE.

Consider 
a cylindrical 
box enclosing 
the cap so that 
the 
top of the box is tangent 
to the top of the SPHERE. Then

so the hollow

the cap and box is given

If a second PLANE cuts the cap, the resulting 
SPHER- 
ICAL 
FRWSTUM is called 
a SPHERICAL SEGMENT. The 
SURFACE AREA of the spherical 
cap is given by the same 
equation 
as for a general

A spherical

is the 
solid 
defined 
by cutting 
a 
SPHERE with 
a pair 
of PARALLEL PLANES. It 
can be 
thought 
of as a SPHERICAL CAP with the top truncated,

corresponds 
to a SPHERICAL 
FRUSTUM. The 
the spherical 
segment 
(excluding 
the bases) is 
called

Call 
the RADIUS of the SPHERE R and 
the 
height 
of 
the segment 
(the distance 
from 
the plane 
to the top of

h. Let the RADII 
of the lower and upper 
bases 
be denoted

Call 
the distance

of the segment 
d, and the height

Problem 
In a rectangular

(a CUBOID) 
with 
dimensions 
30’ x 
12’ x 12’, a spider 
is located 
in the middle 
of one 12’ x 12’ 
wall one foot away from the ceiling. 
A fly is in the middle 
of the opposite 
wall one foot away from 
the floor. 
If the 
fly remains 
stationary, 
what 
is the shortest 
distance 
the 
spider 
must 
crawl to capture 
the fly? 
The 
answer, 
40’, 
can be obtained 
by “flattening” 
the walls 
as illustrated 
above.

the

obtained 
by cutting 
a TORUS 
by a 
PLANE which is PARALLEL to the line through 
the center 
of the HOLE of the TORUS (MacTutor). 
In the FORMULA of the curve

above, 
the TORUS 
is formed 
from 
a CIRCLE of RADIUS a whose center 
is 
rotated 
along 
a CIRCLE of RADIUS T. The 
value 
of c 
gives the distance 
of the cutting 
PLANE from 
the center 
ofthe 
TORUS. 
When 
c =

curve 
consists 
of two CIRCLES of 
RADIUS a whose 
centers 
are at (T, 0) and 
(-T,

If

of one point

while 
if c > T + a, no point

Squarable 
An object 
which 
can be constructed 
by SQUARING 
is 
called 
squarable. 
Square 
1 
The 
term 
square 
is sometimes 
used 
to mean 
SQUARE 
NUMBER. 
When 
used in reference 
to a geometric 
figure, 
however, 
it means 
a convex 
QUADRILATERAL 
with 
four 
equal 
sides at RIGHT 
ANGLES 
to each other, 
illustrated 
above. 
The 
PERIMETER 
of a square 
with 
side length 
a is 
L = 4a 
(1) 
and the AREA 
is 
A = a2. 
(2) 
The 
INRADIUS 
T, CIRCUMRADIUS 
R, and 
AREA 
A can 
be computed 
directly 
from 
the 
formulas 
for a general 
regular 
POLYGON 
with 
side length 
a and n = 4 sides, 
R= 
$acsc 
; 
= +-Jz, 
( 
> 
(4) 
A= 
= u2* 
(5) 
The length 
of the DIAGONAL 
of the UNIT 
SQUARE 
is fi, 
sometimes 
known 
as PYTHAGORAS’S 
CONSTANT. 

Square 
The AREA of a square 
inscribed 
inside 
a UNIT SQUARE 
as shown 
in the above 
diagram 
can be found 
as follows. 
Label 
2 and y as shown, 
then 
x2 + y2 = T2 
(dl 
+ r2 - 2)2 + y2 = 1. 
Plugging 
(6) into 
(7) gives 
(JS 
- x)2 + (2 
- x2) = 1. 
Expanding 
x2 - 2z~+rz+1+r2+T2-X2=1 
and solving 
for cc gives 
T2 
x=&T7’ 
Plugging 
in for y yields 
y=~Gy&. 
The 
area of the shaded 
square 
is then 
&(Jg--l--y)2=~ 
(Detemple 
and Harold 
1996).

The STRAIGHTEDGE and COMPASS construction 
of the 
square 
is simple. 
Draw 
the line 
OpO and 
construct 
a 
circle 
having 
Opa as a radius. 
Then 
construct 
the per- 
pendicular 
OB 
through 
0. 
Bisect 
p&B 
and p@B 
to 
locate 
PI 
and p2, where 
PA is opposite 
PO. 
Similarly, 
Square Bracket Polynomial 
1707 
construct 
ps and 
p4 on the 
other 
SEMICIRCLE. 
Con- 
necting 
PI PzP3P4 
then 
gives a square. 
As shown by Schnirelmann, 
a square 
can be INSCRIBED 
in any closed 
convex 
planar 
curve 
(Steinhaus 
1983). 
A 
square 
can also be CIRCUMSCRIBED about 
any 
closed 
curve 
(Steinhaus 
1983). 
An infinity 
of points 
in the interior 
of a square are known 
whose distances 
from 
three 
of the corners 
of a square 
are 
RATIONAL NUMBERS. Calling 
the distances 
a, b, and c 
where 
s is the side length 
of the square, 
these solutions 
satisfy 
(s2 + b2 - a’)’ 
+ (s2 + b2 - c”)” = (2bsj2 
(13) 
(Guy 
1994). 
In this 
problem, 
one of a, b, c, and 
s is 
DIVISIBLE by 3, one by 4, and one by 5. It is not known 
if there 
are points 
having 
distances 
from 
all fozlr corners 
RATIONAL, but 
such a solution 
requires 
the additional 
condition 
a2 +c2 
= b2 +d2. 
(14) 
In this problem, 
s is DIVISIBLE by 4 and a, b, c, and d 
are ODD. If s is not DIVISIBLE by 3 (5), then 
two of a, 
b, c, and d are DIVISIBLE by 3 (5) (Guy 
1994).

We can similarly 
examine 
the allowable 
last two digits 
by writing 
abclo as 
n = 1OOa + lob + c, 
(5) 
so 
n2 = (100~ + lob + c)~ 
= 104a2 + 2(1000ab 
+ looac 
+ 10bc) + 100b2 + c2 
- - ( 104a2 + 2000ab + 100~ 
+ 100b2) + 20bc + c2, 
(6) 
so the last two digits 
are given 
by 2Obc+ c2 = c(20b + c). 
But 
since the last digit 
must 
be 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, or 9, the 
following 
table 
exhausts 
all possible 
last two digits.

In general, 
the ODD 
squares 
are congruent 
to 1 (mod 
8) 
(Conway 
and Guy 1996). 
Stangl 
(1996) 
gives an explicit 
formula 
by which the number 
of squares 
s(n) in & 
(i.e., 
mod 
n) can be calculated. 
Let 
p be an ODD 
PRIME. 
Then 
s(n) 
is the MULTIPLICATIVE 
FUNCTION 
given 
by 
s(2) = 2 
s(p) = i(Pf 
1) 
(P # 2) 
s(p”) = +(p” -p+2) 
(PM 
(7) 
(8) 
(9) 
(10) 
for n even 
for n odd 
s(p”) 
= 
for n > 3 even 
- 
for n > 3 odd. 
- 
(11) 
s(n) 
is related 
to 
the 
number 
q(n) 
of 
QUADRATIC 
RESIDUES 
in Z, 
by 
4CP”l 
= s(p”) 
- s(p”-“) 
(12) 
for n > 3 (Stangl 
1996).

For a perfect 
square 
n, 
(n/p) 
= 
0 or 1 for all 
ODD 
PRIMES 
p < n where 
(n/p) 
is the 
LEGENDRE 
SYMBOL. 
A number 
n which 
is not 
a perfect 
square 
but 
which 
satisfies 
this relationship 
is called 
a PSEUDOSQUARE. 
The 
minimum 
number 
of squares 
needed 
to represent 
the numbers 
1, 2, 3, 
l . . are 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 1, 2, . . . 
(Sloane’s 
A002828), 
and the number 
of distinct 
ways to 
represent 
the numbers 
1, 2, 3, . l . in terms 
of squares 
are 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, . . l 
(Sloane’s 
A001156). 
A brute-force 
algorithm 
for enumerating 
the square per- 
mutations 
of n is repeated 
application 
of the 
GREEDY 
ALGORITHM. 
However, 
this 
approach 
rapidly 
becomes 
impractical 
since 
the number 
of representations 
grows 
extremely 
rapidly 
with 
n, as shown 
in the following 
ta- 
ble.

Every

integer 
is expressible 
as a SUM 
of (at 
most) 
9w 
= 4 square 
numbers 
(WARING'S

l 
. 
), 
so 49 need never 
be used.) 
Furthermore, 
an 
infinite 
number 
of n require 
four 
squares 
to represent 
them, 
so the related 
quantity 
G(2) 
(the least INTEGER 
n such that 
every POSITIVE INTEGER beyond 
a certain 
point 
requires 
G(2) 
squares) 
is given 
by G( 2) = 4. 
Numbers 
expressible 
as the sum of two squares are those 
whose PRIME FACTORS are of the form 
4/~ - 1 taken 
to 
an EVEN POWER. Numbers 
expressible 
as the sum of 
three 
squares 
are those 
not 
of the form 
4k(8Z + 7) for 
k, 2 > 0. The following

The 
FERMAT 4n + 1 THEOREM guarantees 
that 
every 
PRIME of the form 
4n+ 
1 is a sum of two SQUARE NUM- 
BERS in Only one way. 
There 
are only 
31 numbers 
which 
cannot 
be expressed 
as the sum 
of distinct 
squares: 
2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 15, 
18, 19, 22, 23, 24, 27, 28, 31, 32, 33, 43, 44, 47, 48, 60, 
67, 72, 76, 92, 96, 108, 112, 128 (Sloane’s 
A001422; 
Guy 
1994). 
All 
numbers 
> 188 can be expressed 
as the sum 
of at most 
five distinct 
squares, 
and only 
and 
124 = 1 + 4 + 9 + 25 + 36 + 49 
(13) 
188 = 1 + 4 + 9 + 25 + 49 + 100 
(14) 
require 
six distinct 
squares 
(Bohman 
et al. 1979; 
Guy 
1994, p. 136). 
In fact, 188 can also be represented 
using 
seven distinct 
squares: 
188 = 1 + 4 + 9 + 25 + 36 + 49 + 64. 
(15) 
The following 
table 
gives the numbers 
which can be rep- 
resented 
in W different 
ways as a sum of S squares. 
For 
example, 
50 = l2 + 72 = 52 +52 
can be represented 
in two ways (W = 2) by two squares 
(S = 2).

(Dickson

If

CATALAN'S CONJECTURE states 
that

consecutive 
POWERS (excluding 
0 and

i.e., 
the only

PROBLEM. This 
CONJECTURE has not yet been proved 
or refuted, 
although 
R. Tijdeman 
has proved 
that 
there 
can be only 
a finite 
number 
of exceptions 
should 
the 
CONJECTURE 
not 
hold. 
It is also known 
that

A square 
number 
can 
be 
the 
concatenation 
of two 
squares, 
as in the 
case 16 = 
42 and 
9 = 
32 giving 
169 = 132. 
It is conjectured 
that, 
other 
than 
102n, 
4 x 102” 
and 
9 x 102n, 
there 
are only 
a FINITE 
number 
of squares 
n2 having 
exactly 
two distinct 
NONZERO 
DIGITS 
(Guy 
1994, 
p. 262). 
The 
first 
few such n are 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 
11, 12, 15, 21, 
l . l (Sloane’s 
A016070), 
corresponding 
to 
n2 of 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 121, . . , (Sloane’s 
A016069). 
The 
following 
table 
gives the first 
few numbers 
which, 
when 
squared, 
give numbers 
composed 
of only 
certain 
digits. 
The 
only 
known 
square 
number 
composed 
only 
of the 
digits 
7, 8, and 
9 is 9.

Pyramid 
A square 
pyramid 
is a PYRAMID 
with 
a SQUARE base. 
If the top of the pyramid 
is cut off by a PLANE, a square 
PYRAMIDAL 
FRUSTUM is obtained. 
If the 
four 
TRI- 
ANGLES of the square 
pyramid 
are EQUILATERAL, 
the 
square 
pyramid 
is the “regular” 
POLYHEDRON known 
as 
JOHNSON SOLID JI and, 
for side length 
a, has height 
h = @L 
(1) 
Using 
the equation 
for a general 
PYRAMID, the VOLUME 
of the “regular” 
is therefore 
V= 
ihAb 
= @a”. 
(2) 
If the apex of the pyramid 
does not lie atop 
the center 
of the base, then 
the SLANT HEIGHT is given 
by 
S= 
h2 + $u2, 
(3) 
where h is the height 
and a is the length 
of a side of the 
base.

Consider 
a HEMISPHERE 
placed 
on the base of a square 
pyramid 
(having 
side lengths

h) . Further, 
let the hemisphere 
be tangent 
to the four 
apex 
edges. 
Then 
what 
is the volume 
of the HEMISPHERE 
which 
is

The

as conjectured 
by Lucas 
(1875,

proved 
by Watson 
(1918). 
The

to solving 
the D~OPHANTINE 
EQUATION 
y2 = ix(x

an elementary

TRIANGULAR

are z = -1, 
0, 1, 5, 6, and 85 (Guy

TETRAHE-

A square 
root 
of z is a number 
T such that 
r2 = 2. This 
is written 
1” = 2 li2 
(x to the 
l/2 
POWER) 
or T = &. 
The 
square 
root 
function 
f(z) 
= fi 
is the INVERSE 
FUNCTION of f(z) 
= 
x2. 
Square 
roots 
are also called 
RADICALS or SURDS. A general 
COMPLEX NUMBER z 
has two square roots. 
For example, 
for the real P~SXTIVE 
number 
z = 9, the two square 
roots 
are fi 
= k3, 
since 
32 = (-3y 
= 9. Similarly, 
for the real NEGATIVE num- 
ber x = -9, 
the two square 
roots 
are G 
= 4~34 where 
i is the IMAGINARY NUMBER defined 
by i2 = -1. 
In 
common 
usage, 
unless otherwise 
specified, 
“the” 
square 
root 
is generally 
taken 
to mean 
the POSITIVE square 
root

In general, 
the CONTINUED FRACTIONS of the square 
roots 
of all POSITIVE integers 
are periodic. 
The

by 
Jx=

As can be seen in the above figure, 
the IMAGINARY PART 
of the complex 
square 
root function 
has a BRANCH CUT 
along 
the NEGATIVE real axis. 
A NESTED RADICAL of the form 
da 
& bfi 
can some- 
times 
be simplified 
into 
a simple 
square root by equating 
I/a*b&=Jd*&* 
(2) 
Squaring 
gives 
afb&=d+ef2&, 
(3) 
so 
a=d+e 
(4 
b2c = 4de. 
Solving 
for d and e gives 
(5 ) 
A sequence 
of approximations 
a/b to G 
can be derived 
by factoring 
a2 - nb2 = ztl 
(7) 
( h 
w ere 
-1 
is possible 
only 
if -1 
is a QUADRATIC 
RESIDUE of n). 
Then 
(a+b&)(a-bfi)=fl 
(8) 
(a + bfi)“(a 
- b&i)” 
= (*l)k 
= rtl, 
(9) 
and 
(l+fiy=l+fi 
(10) 
(1+fi)2 
= (1-t n) + 2fi 
(11) 
(1 + fi)(a 
+ bfi) 
= (a + bn) + fi 
(a + b). (12) 
Therefore, 
a and b are given 
by the RECURRENCE RE- 
LATIONS 
ai = ai- 
-/- bi-ln 
bi = ai-1 
+ bivl 
(13) 
(14) 
with 
al = bl = 1. The error

This 
ALGORITHM is sometimes 
known 
as the BHASKA- 
RA-BROUCKNER ALGORITHM. 
For the case n = 2,this 
gives the convergents 
to t/z as 1, 3/2, 
7/5, 
17/12, 
41/29, 
99170,

Another 
general 
technique 
for deriving 
this 
sequence, 
known 
as NEWTON'S ITERATION, 
is obtained 
by letting 
zc = Jn. 
Then 
x = n/x, 
so the SEQUENCE 
2-k=;(2*-I+$-) 
(17) 
converges 
quadratically 
to the

The

Squarefree 
A 
number 
is 
said 
to 
be 
squarefree 
(or 
sometimes 
QUADRATFRH; 
Shanks 
1993) 
if its PRIME 
decomposi- 
tion 
contains 
no repeated 
factors. 
All PRIMES 
are there- 
fore trivially 
squarefree. 
The 
squarefree 
numbers 
are 1, 
2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, , . . (Sloane’s 
AOO5117). 
The 
SQUAREFUL 
numbers 
(i.e., 
those 
that 
contain 
at 
least 
one square) 
are 4, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 20, 24, 25, , , . 
(Sloane’s 
AO13929). 
The asymptotic 
number 
Q(n) 
of squaxefree 
numbers 
< n 
- 
is given 
by 
(1) 
(Hardy 
and Wright 
1979, 
pp. 269-270). 
Q(n) 
for 72 = 
10, 100, 1000, 
. . . are 7, 61, 608, 6083, 
60794, 
607926, 
while 
the 
asymptotic 
density 
is l/5(2) 
= 6/,rr2 E

((n) 
is the RIEMANN 
ZETA FUNCTION. 
The

1) 
k 
- 
if n is product 
of k distinct 
primes, 
(2) 
so p(n) 
# 0 indicates 
that 
n is squarefree. 
The asymp- 
totic 
formula 
for Q(z) 
is equivalent 
to the formula 
(3) 
n=l 
(Hardy 
and Wright 
1979, p. 270) 
There 
is no known 
polynomial-time 
algorithm 
for recog- 
nizing 
squarefree 
INTEGERS 
or for computing 
the square- 
free part 
of an INTEGER. 
In 
fact, 
this 
problem 
may 
be no easier 
than 
the 
general 
problem 
of integer 
fac- 
torization 
(obviously, 
if an integer 
n can be factored 
completely, 
n is squarefree 
IFF 
it 
contains 
no dupli- 
cated 
factors). 
This 
problem 
is an import 
ant unsolved 
problem 
in NU MBER I THEORY 
because 
camp uting 
the 
RING 
of integers 
of an algebraic 
number 
field 
is re- 
ducible 
to 
computing 
the 
squarefree

The three different

the 
three possible 
relative 
sizes of a and c. c > a corresponds 
to the RING 
TORUS 
shown above, 
c = a corresponds 
to 
a HORN

which 
touches 
itself 
at the point 
(0, 0, 
0), and 
c < a corresponds 
to a self-intersecting 
SPIN- 
DLE TORUS 
(Pinkall 
1986). 
If no specification 
is made, 
“torus” 
is taken 
to mean

A star 
polygon 
&L 
{ I 
5 
with p,q POSITIVE INTEGERS, is 
a figure 
formed 
by connecting 
with 
straight 
lines 
every 
qth 
point 
out 
of p regularly 
spaced 
points 
lying 
on a 
CIRCUMFERENCE. The number 
qis 
called 
the DENSITY 
of the star 
polygon. 
Without 
loss of generality, 
take 
4 < P/2. 
The 
usual 
definition 
(Coxeter 
1969) requires 
p and Q to 
be RELATIVELY PRIME. However, 
the star polygon 
can 
also be generalized 
to the STAR FIGURE (or “improper” 
star 
polygon) 
when 
p and 
q share 
a common 
divisor 
(Savio 
and 
Suryanaroyan 
1993). 
For such a figure, 
if 
all points 
are not connected 
after 
the first pass, i.e., if 
(p, q) # 1, then 
start 
with 
the first 
unconnected 
point 
and repeat 
the procedure. 
Repeat 
until 
all points 
are 
connected. 
For 
(p,q) 
# 
1, the 
{p/q} 
symbol 
can be 
factored 
as 
(1) 
where 
P 
pt _= ; 
to give rz {p’/q’} 
figures, 
each rotated 
by 27r/p radians, 
or 360” /p. 
If q = 1, a REGULAR POLYGON {p} 
is obtained, 
Spe- 
cial 
cases of {p/q} 
include 
{5/2} 
(the 
PENTAGRAM), 
{6/2} 
(the HEXAGRAM, or STAR OF DAVID), {8/2} 
(the 
STAR OF LAKSHMI), 
{8/3} 
(the 
OCTAGRAM), 
{10/3} 
(the DECAGRAM), and {12/5} 
(the DODECAGRAM). 
The 
star polygons 
were first 
systematically 
studied 
by 
Thomas 
Bradwardine.

Statistical 
Test 
A test used to determine 
the statistical 
SIGNIFICANCE 
of an observation. 
Two main 
types 
of error 
can occur: 
1. A TYPE I ERROR occurs when a false negative 
result 
is obtained 
in terms 
of the NULL HYPOTHESIS by 
obtaining 
a false 
positive 
measurement. 
2. A TYPE II ERROR occurs when a false positive 
result 
is obtained 
in terms 
of the 
NULL 
HYPOTHESIS 
by 
obtaining 
a false 
negative 
measurement. 
The probability 
that 
a statistical 
test will be positive 
for 
a true 
statistic 
is sometimes 
called 
the test’s 
SENSITIV- 
ITY, and the probability 
that 
a test will be negative 
for 
a negative 
statistic 
is sometimes 
called 
the SPECIFICITY. 
The following 
table 
summarizes 
the names 
given 
to the 
various 
combinations 
of the 
actual 
state 
of affairs 
and 
true 
negative 
result 
specificity 
false positive 
result 
1 - specificity 
Multiple-comparison 
corrections 
to statistical 
ests 
are 
used when several 
statistical 
tests are being 
performed 
simultaneously. 
For 
example, 
let’s 
suppose 
you were 
measuring 
leg length 
in eight 
different 
lizard 
species and 
wanted 
to see whether 
the MEANS of any pair were dif- 
ferent. 
Now, there are 8!/2!6! 
= 28 pairwise 
comparisons 
possible, 
so even if all of the population 
means 
are equal, 
it’s 
quite 
likely 
that 
at least 
one pair 
of sample 
means 
would 
differ 
significantly 
at the 
5% level. 
An ALPHA 
VALUE of 0.05 is therefore 
appropriate 
for each individ- 
ual comparison, 
but not for the set of all comparisons. 
In order 
to avoid 
a lot of spurious 
positi 
VALUE therefore 
needs to be lowered 
to 
.ves, the ALPHA 
for the 
number 
of 
rection 
for 
comparisons 
being 
performed. 
This 
is a cm- 
multiple 
comparisons. 
There 
are many 
differ- 
ent ways to do this. 
The 
simplest, 
and the most 
conser- 
vative, 
is the BONFERRONI CORRECTION. 
Tn practice, 
more 
people 
are more 
willing 
to accept 
false positives 
(false 
rejection 
of NULL HYPOTHESIS) than 
false neg- 
atives 
(false 
acceptance 
of NULL HYPOTHESIS), so less 
conservative 
comparisons 
are usually 
used.

The

method 
starts 
at a point

and, 
as many 
times 
as 
needed, 
moves 
from

by minimizing 
along 
the line extending 
from 
Pi 
in the direction 
of -Of (Pi), 
the local

This 
method 
has the severe 
drawback 
of requiring 
a great 
many 
iterations 
for func- 
tions 
which have long, 
narrow 
valley 
structures. 
In such 
cases, a CONJUGATE GRADIENT METHOD is preferable.

Steiner 
Chain 
Steiner ‘s Ellipse 
1729 
Steiner 
Chain 
Given 
two nonconcentric 
CIRCLES 
with 
one interior 
to 
the other, 
if small 
TANGENT CIRCLES can be inscribed 
around 
the region 
between 
the two CIRCLES such that 
the final 
CIRCLE is TANGENT to the first, the CIRCLES 
form 
a Steiner 
chain. 
The 
simplest 
way to construct 
a Steiner 
chain 
is to per- 
form 
an INVERSION on a symmetrical 
arrangement 
on n 
circles packed 
between 
a central 
circle 
of radius 
b and an 
outer 
concentric 
circle 
of radius 
a. In this arrangement, 
(1) 
so the ratio 
of the radii 
for the small 
and large 
circles 
is 
(2) 
To 
transform 
the 
symmetrical 
arrangement 
into 
a 
Steiner 
chain, 
find 
an INVERSION CENTER which 
trans- 
forms two centers 
initially 
offset by a fixed distance 
c to 
the same point. 
This 
can be done by equating 
k2X 
k2(x 
- c) 
~ 
- 
x:2 - a2 - 
(x 
- 42 - 
b2 
’ 
(3) 
giving 
the offset of the inversion 
center 
from 
the large 
circle’s 
center 
as 
X= 
a2 - b2 + c2 * &a” 
- b2 + c2)2 - 4a2c2 
. 
(4 
Plugging 
in a fixed 
value 
of a fixes 
b, which 
therefore 
determines 
II: for a given c. Equivalently, 
a Steiner 
chain 
results 
whenever 
the INVERSIVE DISTANCE between 
the 
two original 
circles 
is given 
by 
&=2ln[sec(z) 
+tan(E)] 
(5) 
=2ln[,,,(:+&)] 
(6) 
(Coxeter 
and Greitzer 
1967). 
The 
centers 
of the circles 
in a Steiner 
chain 
lie on an ELLIPSE (Ogilvy 
1990, p. 57).

Problem 
Given

with the 
which 
connect 
the points. 
shortest 
The seg- 
ments 
need 
not necessarily 
be straight 
from 
one point 
to another. 
For three 
points, 
if all ANGLES 
are less than 
120”, 
then 
the line segments 
are those 
connecting 
the three 
points 
to a central 
point 
P which 
makes 
the 
ANGLES 
(A) PB, 
(B) PC, 
and 
(C) PA 
all 120”. 
If one ANGLE 
is greater 
that 
120”, 
then 
P coincides 
with 
the offending 
ANGLE. 
For four points, 
P is the intersection 
of the two diago- 
nals, 
but 
the required 
minimum 
segments 
are not nec- 
essarily 
these diagonals. 
A modified 
version 
of the problem 
is, given 
two points, 
to find the segments 
with 
the shortest

con- 
nect ing the points

Steiner 
Surface 
Steiner’s 
Theorem 
A projection 
of the VER~NESE SURFACE 
into 3-D (which 
must 
contain 
singularities) 
is called 
a Steiner 
surface. 
A classification 
of Steiner 
surfaces 
allowing 
complex 
parameters 
and projective 
transformations 
was accom- 
plished 
in the 
19th 
century. 
The 
surfaces 
obtained 
by 
restricting 
to real parameters 
and transformations 
were 
classified 
into 
10 types 
by Coffman 
et al. (1996). 
Ex- 
amples 
of Steiner 
surfaces 
include 
the ROMAN SURFACE 
(Coffman 
type 
1) and 
CROSS-CAP 
(type 
3). 
Let LINES x and y join 
a variable 
point 
on a CONIC SEC- 
TION to two fixed 
points 
on the same CONIC SECTION. 
Then 
x and y are PROJECTIVELY related. 
see also CONIC SECTION, 
PROJECTION 
Steiner 
Triple 
System 
Let X be a set of 21 > 3 elements 
together 
with 
a set B 
- 
of 3-subset 
(triples) 
of X such that 
every 
Z-SUBSET 
of 
X occurs 
in exactly 
one triple 
of B. 
Then 
B is called 
a 
Steiner 
triple 
system 
and is a special 
case of a STEINER 
SYSTEM 
with 
t = 2 and JG = 3. A Steiner 
triple 
system 
SC 1 - 
S(v, k = 
- 
3, X = 
1) of order 
v exists 
IFF v = 
1,; 
(mod 
6) 
(Kirkman 
1847). 
In 
addition, 
if Steiner 
triple 
systems 
S1 and Sz of orders 
~1 and 212 exist, 
then 
so does a Steiner 
triple 
system 
S of order 
~1212 (Ryser 
1963, p* 101). 
The 
Steiner 
surface 
of type 
2 is given 
by the 
implicit 
equation 
x2y2 
- x2z2 
+ y2z2 - xyx 
= 0, 
and 
can be transformed 
into 
the 
ROMAN 
SURFACE or 
CROSS-CAP by a complex 
projective 
change 
of coordi- 
nates 
(but 
not 
by a real 
transformation). 
It 
has two 
pinch 
points 
and three 
double 
lines and, 
unlike 
the RO- 
MAN SURFACE or CROSS-CAP, is not 
compact 
in any 
affine neighborhood. 
The 
Steiner 
surface 
of type 
4 has the implicit 
equation 
Y2 - 2xy2 - XL2 + x2y2 + X2L2 - z4 = 0, 
1 and two of the three 
double 
lines 
of surface 
2 coincide 
along 
a line 
where 
the two noncompact 
“components” 
are tangent.

Steiner 
System 
A Steiner 
system 
is a set X of ‘u points, 
and a collection 
of subsets 
of X of size k (called 
blocks), 
such that 
any 
t points 
of X 
are in exactly 
one of the 
blocks. 
The 
special 
case t = 2 and k = 3 corresponds 
to a so-called 
STEINER TRIPLE SYSTEM. For a PROJECTIVE PLANE, 
V = n2 + n + 1, k = n + 1, t = 2, and the blocks 
are 
simply 
lines.

one eye to view each image, 
a stereogram 
is not

St iefel 
Manifold 
The 
Stiefel 
manifold 
of ORTHONORMAL k-frames 
in Iw” 
is the collection 
of vectors 
(~1, . . . , wk) where wi is in Iw” 
for alli,andthe 
k-tuple 
(~11, . . ..v~)is 
ORTHONORMAL. 
This 
is a submanifold 
of Rnlc, 
having 
DIMENSION nk - 
(k + l)k/2. 
Sometimes 
the 
“orthonormal” 
condition 
is dropped 
in 
favor of the mildly 
weaker condition 
that 
the k-tuple 
(WI, 
“‘1 
vh) is linearly 
independent. 
Usually, 
this 
does not 
affect the applications 
since Stiefel 
manifolds 
are usually 
considered 
only 
during 
HOMOTOPY THEORETIC consid- 
erations. 
With 
respect 
to HOMOTOPY THEORY, the 
two definitions 
are more 
or less equivalent 
since GRAM-

Stiefel-Whitney 
Class 
The ith 
Stiefel-Whitney 
class of a REAL VECTOR BUN- 
DLE (or TANGENT BUNDLE or a REAL MANIFOLD) is in 
the ith 
cohomology 
group 
of the base SPACE involved. 
It is an OBSTRUCTION to the existence 
of (n - i + 1) 
REAL linearly 
independent 
VECTOR FIELDS on that 
VECTOR BUNDLE, where 
n is the 
dimension 
of the 
FIBER. Here, OBSTRUCTION means 
that 
the ith 
Stiefel- 
Whitney 
class being 
NONZERO implies 
that 
there 
do not 
exist 
(n - i + 1) everywhere 
linearly 
dependent 
VECTOR 
FIELDS (although 
the Stiefel-Whitney 
classes are not al- 
ways the OBSTRUCTION). 
In particular, 
the nth 
Stiefel-Whitney 
class is the ob- 
struction 
to the existence 
of an everywhere 
NONZERO 
VECTOR FIELD, and the first 
Stiefel-Whitney 
class of a 
MANIFOLD is the obstruction 
to orientability.

Stiefel-Whitney 
Number 
The 
Stiefel-Whitney 
number 
is defined 
in terms 
of the 
STIEFEL-WHITNEY 
CLASS of a MANIFOLD 
as follows. 
For any collection 
of STIEFEL-WHITNEY 
CLASSES such 
that 
their 
cup 
product 
has the 
same 
DIMENSION as 
the MANIFOLD, 
this 
cup product 
can be evaluated 
on 
the MANIFOLD'S FUNDAMENTAL 
CLASS. 
The 
result- 
ing number 
is called 
the PONTRYAGIN NUMBER for that 
combination 
of Pontryagin 
classes. 
The 
most 
important 
aspect 
of Stiefel-Whitney 
numbers 
is that 
they 
are COBORDISM invariant. 
Together, 
PON-

determine 
an ori- 
ented MANIFOLD% COBORDISM class.

Stirling’s 
Approximation 
Stirling’s 
approximation 
gives an approximate 
value 
for 
the FACTORIAL function 
n! or the GAMMA FUNCTION 
P(n) 
for n >> 1. 
The 
approximation 
can most 
simply 
be derived 
for n an INTEGER by approximating 
the sum 
over the terms 
ofthe 
FACTORIAL with 
an INTEGRAL,SO

using 
the integral

inition 
of the FACTORIAL,

Note 
that

(3) 
The 
integrand 
is sharply 
peaked 
with 
the contribution 
important 
only 
near 
x = n. 
Therefore, 
let x E n + 6 
where t < n, and write 
ln(xnCx) 
= nlnx 
- x = nln(n+i$) 
- (n+c).

Now, 
ln(n + 0 =ln[n(l+i)]

Stokes’ Theorem 
1743 
Stochastic 
Matrix 
A Stochastic 
matrix 
is the transition 
matrix 
for a finite 
MARKOV CHAIN, 
also called 
a MARKOV 
MATRIX. 
El- 
ements 
of the matrix 
must 
be REAL 
NUMBERS 
in the 
CLOSED 
INTERVAL [0, 11. 
A completely 
independent 
type 
of stochastic 
matrix 
is 
defined 
as a SQUARE MATRIX withentriesin 
a FIELD 
F 
such that 
the sum of elements 
in each column 
equals 
1. 
There 
are two nonsingular 
2 x 2 STOCHASTIC MATRICES 
over Zz (i.e., the integers 
mod 
2), 
[i q and [Yl ;I- 
There 
are six nonsingular 
stochastic 
3 x 3 MATRICES 
over Z3, 
In fact, the set S of all nonsingular 
stochastic 
n x n ma- 
trices 
over a FIELD 
F forms 
a GROUP 
under 
MATRIX 
MULTIPLICATION. 
This 
GROUP 
is called 
the STOCHAS- 
TIC 
GROUP.

from 
some PROBABILITY SPACE 
(S,S,

into 
a STATE SPACE (S’,S’).

Stochastic 
Resonance 
A stochastic 
resonance 
is a phenomenon 
in which 
a non- 
linear 
system 
is subjected 
to a periodic 
modulated 
signal 
so weak as to be normally 
undetectable, 
but it becomes 
detectable 
due to resonance 
between 
the weak determin- 
istic signal 
and stochastic 
NOISE. 
The earliest 
definition 
of stochastic 
resonance 
was the 
maximum 
of the 
out- 
put signal 
strength 
as a function 
of NOISE

and 
Gammaitoni

A COMPISETE

(Monier

A strong

to the base a is also an EULER

to the base a (Pomerance

The 
strong 
pseudoprimes 
include 
some 
EULER

There 
are 4842 strong

The

test for k = 2, 3, 5 correctly 
identifies 
all

only 
13 exceptions, 
and if 
7 is added, 
then 
the only 
exception 
less than 
2.5 x lOlo 
is 315031751. 
Jaeschke 
(1993) 
showed 
that 
there 
are 
only 
101 strong 
pseudoprimes 
for the bases 2, 3, and 
5 less than 
1012, nine 
if 7 is added, 
and none 
if 11 is 
added. 
Also, 
the bases 2, 13, 23, and 1662803 
have no 
exceptions 
up to 1012. 
If n is COMPOSITE, 
then there 
is a base for which n is not 
a strong 
pseudoprime. 
There 
are therefore 
no “strong

Let 
C be a curve, 
let 
0 be a fixed 
point 
(the 
POLE), 
and let 0’ 
be a second 
fixed 
point. 
Let 
P and P’ 
be 
points 
on a line 
through 
0 meeting 
C at Q such that 
P’Q 
= QP 
= QO’. 
The 
LOCUS 
of P and P’ 
is called 
the 
strophoid 
of C with 
respect 
to the 
POLE 
0 
and 
fixed point 
0’. 
Let C be represented 
parametrically 
by 
(fW9W 
and let 0 = ( zo,yo) 
and 0’ = (xl,y& 
Then 
the equation 
of the strophoid 
is 
x=ff

The name 
strophoid 
means 
“belt 
with 
a twist,” 
and was 
proposed 
by Montucci 
in 1846 (MacTutor 
Archive). 
The 
polar

If a =

the 
curve 
is a RIGHT STROPHOID.

Sturm 
Function 
Given 
a function 
f(z) 
G fo(z), 
write 
fi 
E f’(z) 
and 
define 
the Sturm 
functions 
by 
&L(x) = - 
{ 
h-2(4 
-h-Ax) 
[*I} 
> 
(1) 
where P(4lQ(x)l 
is a polynomial 
quotient. 
Then 
con-

chain 
of Sturm 
functions, 
fo

fi 
fl =qxf2---3 
f2 
=f?2f3-f4 
(2) 
f s-2 
= qs-2fs-1- 
fs, 
known 
as a STURM 
CHAIN. 
The 
chain 
is terminated 
when a constant 
-fs(x) 
is obtained. 
Sturm 
functions 
provide 
a convenient 
way for finding 
the number 
of real roots 
of an algebraic 
equation 
with 
real 
coefficients 
over a given 
interval. 
Specifically, 
the 
difference 
in the 
number 
of sign 
changes 
between 
the 
Sturm 
functions 
evaluated 
at two points 
x = a and x = b 
gives the number 
of real roots in the interval 
(a, b). This 
powerful 
result 
is known 
as the STURM 
THEOREM. 
As a specific 
application 
of Sturm 
functions 
toward 
find- 
ing POLYNOMIAL 
ROOTS, 
consider 
the function 
fo(x) 
= 
X5 - 3x - 1, plotted 
above, 
which 
has roots 
-1.21465, 
-0.334734, 
0.0802951& 
1.32836& 
and 
1.38879 
(three 
of 
which 
are real). 
The 
DERIVATIVE 
is given 
by f’( 2) = 
5x4 - 3, and the STURM 
CHAIN 
is then 
given 
by 
fo = x5 -3X-l 
(3) 
fi = 5x4 - 3 
(4) 
f2 = ;(12a:+5) 
(5) 
59083 
f3 
= 
- 20736' 
(6) 
The following 
table 
shows the signs of fi and the number 
of sign changes

Sum 
A sum 
is the 
result 
of an ADDITION. 
For 
example, 
adding 
1, 2, 3, and 4 gives the sum 10, written 
1+2+3+4=10. 
(1) 
The 
numbers 
being 
summed 
are called 
ADDENDS, 
or 
sometimes 
SUMMANDS. 
The 
summation 
operation 
can 
also be indicated 
using 
a capital 
sigma 
with 
upper 
and 
lower limits 
written 
above 
and below, 
and the index 
in- 
dicated 
below. 
For example, 
the 
above 
sum 
could 
be 
written 
4

k=l 
= 10. 
(2) 
A simple 
graphical 
proof 
of the sum 
CLE1 
k = n(n + 
1)/2 can also be given. 
Construct 
a sequence 
of stacks of 
boxes, each 1 unit 
across and Fz units 
high, 
where k = 1, 
2, . . . . n. 
Now 
add a rotated 
copy 
on top, 
as in the 
above figure. 
Note 
that 
the resulting 
figure 
has WIDTH 
n and HEIGHT 
n + 1, and so has AREA 
n(n + l)- 
The 
desired 
sum is half this, 
so the AREA 
of the boxes in the 
sum is n(n 
+ 1)/2. 
S ince the boxes 
are of unit 
width, 
this is also the value 
of the sum. 
The

Surface 
The 
word 
“surface” 
is an important 
term 
in 
mathe- 
matics 
and is used in many 
ways. 
The 
most 
common 
and straightforward 
use of the word 
is to denote 
a Z-D 
SUBMANIFOLD of3-D 
EUCLIDEAN SPACE. Surfaces 
can 
range 
from 
the very complicated 
(e.g., FRACTALS such 
as the MANDELBROT SET) to the very simple 
(such as 
the PLANE). More 
generally, 
the word 
%urface” 
can be 
used to denote 
an (n - 1)-D SUBMANIFOLD of an n-D 
MANIFOLD, or in general, 
any 
co-dimension 
1 subob- 
ject 
in an object 
(like 
a BANACH SPACE or an infinite- 
dimensional 
MANIFOLD). 
Even simple 
surfaces 
can display 
surprisingly 
count erin- 
tuitive 
properties. 
For example, 
the SURFACE OF REVO- 
LUTION ofy 
= l/11: around 
the X-AXIS for z 2 1 (called 
GABRIEL'S 
HORN) 
has FINITE 
VOLUME but INFINITE 
SURFACE AREA.

Surface 
Area 
Surface 
area is the AREA of a given 
surface. 
Roughly 
speaking, 
it is the 
“amount” 
of a surface, 
and has units 
of distance 
squares. 
It 
is commonly 
denoted 
S for a 
surface 
in 3-D, or A for a region 
of the plane 
(in which 
case it is simply 
called 
“the” 
AREA). 
If the surface 
is PARAMETERIZED 
using 
u and V, then 
S=

IT, 
x T,\ 
du 
dv, 
(1) 
S 
where T, 
and TV are tangent 
vectors 
and a x b is the 
CROSS PRODUCT. 
The 
surface 
area given 
by rotating 
the curve 
y = f(z) 
from 
x = a to x = b about 
the s-axis 
is 
S= 
s 
a Zrf(x)dmdx. 
(2) 
b 
If z = f (x, y) is defined 
over a region 
R, then 
s=//&)2+($)2+ldA, 
(3) 
where the integral 
is taken 
over the entire 
surface. 
The 
following 
tables 
gives surface 
areas for some 
com- 
mon SURFACES. In the first table, 
S denotes 
the lateral 
surface, 
and in the second, 
T denotes 
the total 
surface. 
In both 
tables, 
T denotes 
the RADIUS, h the height, 
p 
the base PERIMETER, and s the SLANT HEIGHT (Beyer 
1987).

Surface 
of Revolution 
(Gray 
1993). 
A surface of revolution 
is a SURFACE generated 
by rotat- 
ing a 2-D CURVE about 
an axis. 
The 
resulting 
surface 
therefore 
always has azimuthal 
symmetry. 
Examples 
of 
surfaces of revolution 
include 
the APPLE, CONE (exclud- 
ing the base), CONICAL FRUSTUM (excluding 
the ends), 
CYLINDER 
(excluding 
the 
ends), 
DARWIN-DE SITTER 
SPHEROID, GABRIEL'S HORN, HYPERBOLOID, LEMON, 
OBLATE SPHEROID,PARABOLOID, 
PROLATE SPHEROID, 
PSEUDOSPHERE, SPHERE, SPHEROID, and TORUS (and 
its generalization, 
the TOROID). 
PAPPUS'S CENTROID THEOREM gives the VOLUME of a 
solid 
of rotation 
as the cross-sectional 
AREA times 
the 
distance 
traveled 
by the centroid 
as it is rotated. 
CALCULUS OF VARIATIONS canbeusedtofindthecurve 
from 
a point 
(xl, ~1) to a point 
(x2, ~2) which, 
when 
revolved 
around 
the X-AXIS, 
yields 
a surface of smallest 
SURFACE AREA A (i.e., 
the MINIMAL 
SURFACE). This 
is equivalent 
to finding 
the MINIMAL 
SURFACE passing 
through 
two circular 
wire frames. 
The AREA element

which 
is called

a CATENOID. The 
two constants 
a and b are determined 
from 
the two implicit 
equations 
which 
cannot 
be solved 
analytically. 
(27) 
(28) 
The 
general 
case is somewhat 
more 
complicated 
than 
this solution 
suggests. 
To see this, consider 
the MINIMAL 
SURFACE between 
two rings 
of equal 
RADIUS yo. With- 
out loss of generality, 
take the origin 
at the midpoint 
of 
the two rings. 
Then 
the 
two endpoints 
are located 
at 
(-07 
Yo) and (x0, Yo), and 
Yo = acosh 
(F) 
= .cosh(e) 
l 
(29) 
But 
cosh(-x) 
= cash(x), 
so 
cash(F) 
= cash (=$J 
l 
(30) 
Inverting 
each side 
-50 
- b = -20 
+ b, 
(31) 
so b = 0 (as it must 
by symmetry, 
since we have chosen 
the origin 
between 
the two rings), 
and the equation 
of 
the MINIMAL SURFACE reduces 
to 
(32) 
At the endpoints 
but 
for certain 
values 
of x0 and 
yo, this 
equation 
has 
no solutions. 
The 
physical 
interpretation 
of this 
fact is 
that 
the surface 
breaks 
and forms 
circular 
disks 
in each 
ringtominimize 
AREA. CALCULUS OF VARIATIONS can- 
not be used to find such discontinuous 
solutions 
(known 
in this 
case as GOLDSCHMIDT SOLUTIONS). 
The 
mini- 
mal 
surfaces 
for several 
choices 
of endpoints 
are shown 
above. 
The 
first 
two cases are CATENOIDS, while 
the 
third 
case is a GOLDSCHMIDT SOLUTION. 
To find 
the 
maximum 
value 
of xo/yo 
at which 
CATE- 
NARY solutions 
can be obtained, 
let p s l/a. 
Then 
(31) 
gives 
YOP = cosh(pxo). 
(34) 
Now, 
denote 
the maximum 
value 
of x0 as x& 
Then 
it 
will be true that 
dxo/dp 
= 0. Take 
d/dp 
of (34), 
yo = sinh(pxo) 
(xo+p$). 
Now 
set dxo/dp 
= 0 
yo = x0 sinh(pxg). 
From 
(34), 
pyo* 
= cosh(pxo*). 
Take 
(37) + (36), 
px; 
= coth(px;). 
Defining 
u = pxo* , 
u = cothu. 
(35) 
(36) 
(37) 
(38) 
(39) 
This 
has solution 
u = 
1.1996789403 
l . .* 
From 
(36), 
yap 
= coshu. 
Divide 
this 
by (39) to obtain 
yo/xo 
= 
sinh u, so the maximum 
possible 
value 
of xo/yo 
is 
X0 - 
- csch u = 0.6627434193.

Some 
caution 
is needed 
in solving 
(33) for a. If we take 
x0 = l/2 
and yo = 1 then 
(33) becomes 
(45) 
which 
has two solutions: 
al = 0.2350,. 
. (“deep”), 
and 
a2

I-Iowever, 
upon

these

x0 =

we find 
A1 = 6.8456.

A2

true minimal

Surface 
of Section 
A surface 
(or “space”) 
of section 
is a way of presenting 
a 
trajectory 
in n-D PHASE SPACE in an (n- 
1)-D 
SPACE. 
l3y picking 
one phase element 
constant 
and plotting 
the 
values 
of the 
other 
elements 
each time 
the selected 
el- 
ement 
has the 
desired 
value, 
an intersection 
surface 
is 
obtained. 
If the equations 
of motion 
can be formulated 
as a MAP in which 
an explicit 
FORMULA gives the values 
of the other 
elements 
at successive 
passages through

Suslin ‘s Theorem 
Swastika 
Plotting 
I, from 
a LZFE EXPECTANCY table 
on a loga- 
rithmic 
scale versus z gives a curve known 
as a survivor- 
ship curve. 
There 
are three 
general 
classes of survivor- 
ship curves, 
illustrated 
above. 
Type 
I curves 
are typical 
of populations 
in which 
most 
mortality 
occurs 
among 
the elderly 
(e.g., 
hu- 
mans 
in developed 
countries). 
Type 
II 
curves 
occur 
when 
mortality 
is not depen- 
dent 
on age (e.g., 
many 
species 
of large 
birds 
and 
fish). 
For an infinite 
type 
II 
population, 
eo = el = 
l 
- 
‘? but this 
cannot 
hold 
for a finite 
population. 
Type 
III 
curves occur 
when juvenile 
mortality 
is ex- 
tremely 
high 
(e.g., plant 
and animal 
species produc- 
ing many 
offspring 
of which 
few survive). 
In type 
III 
populations, 
it is often 
true 
that 
ei+l 
> ei for 
small 
i. In other 
words, 
life expectancy 
increases 
for 
individuals 
who survive 
their 
risky 
juvenile 
period.

Swinnerton-Dyer 
Conjecture 
In the early 
196Os, B. Birch 
and H. P. F. Swinnerton- 
Dyer 
conjectured 
that 
if a given 
ELLIPTIC 
CURVE 
has 
an infinite 
number 
of solutions, 
then 
the associated 
L- 
function 
has value 
0 at a certain 
fixed 
point. 
In 
1976, 
Coates 
and Wiles 
showed that 
elliptic 
curves with 
COM- 
PLEX 
multiplication 
having 
an infinite 
number 
of solu- 
tions 
have 
L-functions 
which 
are zero at the relevant 
fixed 
point 
(COATES-WILES 
THEOREM), 
but they 
were 
unable 
to prove 
the 
converse. 
V. Kolyvagin 
extended 
this 
result 
to modular 
curves.

Function 
A symmetric 
function 
on n variables 
~1, 
. . , , X~ is a 
function 
that 
is unchanged 
by any PERMUTATION 
of its 
variables. 
In most 
contexts, 
the term 
“symmetric 
func- 
tion” 
refers to a polynomial 
on n variables 
with 
this fea- 
ture 
(more 
properly 
called 
a “symmetric 
polynomial”). 
Another 
type 
of symmetric 
functions 
is symmetric 
ra- 
tional 
functions, 
which 
are the 
RATIONAL 
FUNCTIONS 
that 
are unchanged 
by PERMUTATION 
of variables.

The symmetric

symmetric 
ra-

can be expressed 
as polynomials 
(re- 
spectively, 
rational 
functions) 
in the ELEMENTARY SYM- 
METRIC

This 
is called 
the FUNDAMENTAL 
THEOREM OF SYMMETRIC FUNCTIONS. 
A function 
f(z) 
is sometimes 
said to be symmetric 
about 
the ~-AXIS if f(-z) 
= f ( 2). 
Examples 
of such func- 
tions 
include 
1x1 (the ABSOLUTE VALUE)

Symmetry 
An intrinsic 
property 
of a mathematical 
object 
which 
causes it to remain 
invariant 
under 
certain 
classes 
of 
transformations 
(such as ROTATION, 
REFLECTION, 
IN- 
VERSION, 
or more 
abstract 
operations). 
The mathemat- 
ical study 
of symmetry 
is systematized 
and formalized 
in the extremely 
powerful 
and beautiful 
AREA of math- 
ematics 
called 
GROUP 
THEORY. 
Symmetry 
can be present 
in the form 
of coefficients 
of 
equations 
as well as in the physical 
arrangement 
of ob- 
jects. 
By classifying 
the symmetry 
of polynomial 
equa- 
tions 
using 
the machinery 
of GROUP 
THEORY, 
for ex- 
ample, 
it is possible 
to prove 
the unsolvability 
of the 
general 
QUINTIC 
EQUATION. 
In physics, 
an extremely 
powerful 
theorem 
of Noether 
states 
that 
each symmetry 
of a system 
leads to a phys- 
ically 
conserved 
quantity. 
Symmetry 
under 
TRANSLA- 
TION 
corresponds 
to momentum 
conservation, 
symme- 
try 
under 
ROTATION 
to angular 
momentum 
conserva- 
tion, 
symmetry 
in time 
to energy 
conservation, 
etc.

Synergetics 
Synergetics 
deals with 
systems 
composed 
of many 
sub- 
systems 
which 
may 
each be of a very 
different 
nature. 
In particular, 
synergetics 
treats 
systems 
in which 
cu- 
operation 
among 
subsystems 
creates 
organized 
struc- 
ture 
on macroscopic 
scales 
(Waken 
1993). 
Examples 
of problems 
treated 
by synergetics 
include 
BIFURCA- 
TIONS, 
phase transitions 
in physics, 
convective 
instabili- 
ties, coherent 
oscillations 
in lasers, 
nonlinear 
oscillations 
in electrical

OF TANGENTS 
Tangle 
A region 
in a KNOT or LINK projection 
plane 
surrounded 
by a CIRCLE such that 
the KNOT or LINK crosses the 
circle exactly 
four times. 
Two tangles 
are equivalent 
if a 
sequence 
of REIDEMEISTER MOVES can be used to trans- 
form 
one into 
the other 
while 
keeping 
the 
four 
string 
endpoints 
fixed 
and not allowing 
strings 
to pass outside 
the CIRCLE. 
The 
simplest 
tangles 
are the 
m-tangle 
and 
O-tangle, 
shown 
above. 
A tangle 
with 
n left-handed 
twists 
is 
called 
an n-tangle, 
and one with 
n right-handed 
twists 
is called 
a -n-tangle. 
By placing 
tangles 
side by side, 
more complicated 
tangles 
can be built 
up such as (-2, 
3, 
Z), etc. 
The 
link 
created 
by connecting 
the ends of the 
tangles 
is now described 
by the sequence 
of tangle 
sym- 
bols, known 
as CONWAY'S KNOT NOTATION. 
If tangles 
are multiplied 
by 0 and then 
added, 
the resulting 
tangle 
symbols 
are separated 
by commas. 
Additional 
symbols 
which 
are used are the period, 
colon, 
and asterisk. 
Amazingly 
enough, 
two tangles 
described 
in this NOTA- 
TION are equivalent 
IFF the CONTINUED FRACTIONS of 
the form 
1 
2+- 
1 
3+- 
-2 
are equal 
(Burde 
and Zieschang 
1985)! 
An ALGEBRAIC 
TANGLE is any tangle 
obtained 
by ADDITIONS and MUL- 
TIPLICATIONS of rational 
tangles 
(Adams 
1994). 
Not all 
tangles 
are ALGEBRAIC.

CONJECTURE 
Taniyama-Shimura 
Conjecture 
A conjecture 
which 
arose 
from 
several 
problems 
pro- 
posed 
by 
Taniyama 
in 
an 
international 
mathematics 
symposium 
in 
1955. 
Let 
E 
be an ELLIPTIC 
CURVE 
whose 
equation 
has INTEGER 
COEFFICIENTS, 
let N be 
the CONDUCTOR of E and, for each 72, let a, be the num- 
ber appearing 
in the L-function 
of E. 
Then 
there 
exists 
a MODULAR 
FORM 
of weight 
two 
and 
level 
Iv which 
is 
an eigenform 
under 
the 
HECKE 
OPERATORS 
and has 
a 
FOURIER 
SERIES 
&& 
The conjecture 
says, 
in effect, 
that 
every 
rational 
ELLIP- 
TIC CURVE 
is a MODULAR 
FORM 
in disguise. 
Stated 
for- 
mally, 
the conjecture 
suggests 
that, 
for every 
ELLIPTIC 
CURVE y2 = Ax3 +Bz2 +CX+ 
D over the RATIONALS, 
there 
exist 
nonconstant 
MOKKAR 
FUNCTIONS f(x) 
and 
g(z) 
of the same 
level 
N such 
that 
[ml2 = 4dz)l2 + Cd4 + D- 
Equivalently, 
for 
every 
ELLIPTIC 
CURVE, there 
is 
a 
MODULAR FORM with the same DIRICHLET 
L-SERIES. 
In 1985, 
starting 
with 
a fictitious 
solution 
to FERMAT'S 
LAST THEOREM, G. Frey 
showed 
that 
he could 
create 
an unusual 
ELLIPTIC 
CURVE 
which 
appeared 
not 
to be 
modular. 
If the curve 
were 
not modular, 
then 
this 
would 
showthatif 
FERMAT'S 
LAST THEOREM 
were 
false,then 
the 
Taniyama-Shimura 
conjecture 
would 
also 
be false. 
Furthermore, 
if the Taniyama-Shimura 
conjecture 
were 
true,then 
so would 
be FERMAT'S LAST THEOREM! 
However, 
Frey 
did not 
actually 
prove 
whether 
his curve 
was 
modular. 
The 
conjecture 
that 
Frey’s 
curve 
was 
modular 
came 
to be called 
the 
“epsilon 
conjecture,” 
and 
was 
quickly 
proved 
by 
Ribet 
(RIBET'S 
THEOREM) 
in 
1986, 
establishing 
a very 
close 
link 
between 
two 
math- 
ematical 
structures 
(the 
Taniyama-Shimura 
conjecture 
and FERMAT'S 
LAST 
THEOREM) 
which 
appeared 
previ- 
ously 
to be completely 
unrelated. 
As of the 
early 
199Os, 
most 
mathematicians 
believed 
that 
the Taniyama-Shimura 
conjecture 
was 
not accessi- 
ble to proof, 
However, 
A. Wiles 
was 
not one of these. 
He 
attempted 
to establish 
the 
correspondence 
between 
the 
set of ELLIPTIC 
CURVES 
and the set of modular 
elliptic 
curves 
by showing 
that 
the number 
of each was 
the same. 
Wiles 
accomplished 
this 
by “counting” 
Galois 
represen- 
tations 
and 
comparing 
them 
with 
the number 
of mod- 
ular 
forms. 
In 1993, 
after 
a monumental 
seven-year 
ef- 
fort, 
Wiles 
(almost) 
proved 
the Taniyama-Shimura 
con- 
jecture 
for special 
classes 
of curves 
called 
SEMISTABLE 
ELLIPTIC CURVES. 

1786 
Tank 
Tau Conjecture 
Wiles 
had tried 
to use horizontal 
Iwasawa 
theory 
to cre- 
ate a so-called 
CLANS NUMBER formula, 
but was initially 
unsuccessful 
and therefore 
used instead 
an extension 
of 
a result 
of Flach 
based 
on ideas from 
Kolyvagin. 
How- 
ever, 
there 
was a problem 
with 
this 
extension 
which 
was discovered 
during 
review 
of Wiles’ 
manuscript 
in 
September 
1993. 
Former 
student 
Richard 
Taylor 
came 
to Princeton 
in early 
1994 to help 
Wiles 
patch 
up this 
error. 
After 
additional 
effort, 
Wiles 
discovered 
the rea- 
son that 
the Flach/Kolyvagin 
approach 
was failing, 
and 
also discovered 
that 
it was precisely 
what had prevented 
Iwasawa 
theory 
from 
working. 
With 
this 
additional 
insight, 
he was able 
to success- 
fully 
complete 
the 
erroneous 
portion 
of the 
proof 
us- 
ing Iwasawa 
theory, 
proving 
the SEMISTABLE case of the 
Taniyama-Shimura 
conjecture 
(Taylor 
and Wiles 
1995, 
Wiles 
1995) 
and, 
at the 
same 
time, 
establishing 
FER- 
MAT'S LAST THEOREM as atruetheorem.

The parametric

with 
the following 
story 
told 
about 
Ramanujan 
by G. H. Hardy. 
“Once, 
in the taxi 
from 
London, 
Hardy 
noticed 
its number, 
1729. 
He must 
have 
thought 
about 
it a little 
because 
he entered 
the room 
where Ramanujan 
lay in bed and, 
with 
scarcely 
a hello, 
blurted 
out his disappointment 
with 
it. 
It was, he de- 
clared, 
‘rather 
a dull number,’ 
adding 
that 
he hoped 
that 
wasn’t 
a bad omen. 
‘No, 
Hardy,’ 
said Ramanujan, 
‘it is 
a very 
interesting 
number. 
It 
is the smallest 
number 
expressible 
as the sum 
of two [POSITIVE] 
cubes 
in two 
different 
ways”’ 
(Hofstadter 
1989, 
Kanigel 
1991, 
Snow 
1993). 
However, 
this property 
was also known 
as early 
as 1657

Hardy

show that 
the 
number 
of such sums can be made 
arbitrarily 
large but, 
updating 
Guy

with Wilson’s

the least ex- 
ample

A Taylor

is a series

A 1-D Taylor 
series is an expansion 
of a

the expansion 
is known 
as a MACLAURIN

The

In tensor 
notation, 
a vector 
v would 
be written 
ui, where

Tensor 
notation 
can provide 
a very concise 
way of writ- 
ing 
vector 
and 
more 
general 
identities. 
For example, 
in tensor 
notation, 
the DOT 
PRODUCT 
u 9 v is simply 
written 
u-v 
= uivi, 
(1) 
where 
repeated 
indices 
are 
summed 
over 
(EINSTEIN 
SUMMATION) 
so that 
uizfi stands 
for ulul 
+ . , , + umwma 
Similarly, 
the CROSS PRODUCT 
can be concisely 
written 
as 
U 
X 
V 
= 
EijkU 
j 
k 
V

Erdes 
and Graham 
(1980) 
conjectured 
that 
no POWER 
of 2, 2”, 
is a SUM 
of distinct 
powers 
of 3 for n > 8. 
This 
is equivalent 
to the requirement 
that 
the ternary 
expansion 
of 2n always 
contains 
a 2. 
This 
has been 
verified 
by Vardi 
(1991) 
up to n = 2.320. 
N+ J. A. Sloane 
has conjectured 
that 
any 
POWER 
of 2 has a 0 in its 
ternary 
expansion 
(Vardi 
1991, p* 28).

Tetrahedron 
A 
The regular 
tetrahedron, 
often simply 
called 
“the” 
tetra- 
hedron,isthe 
PLATONIC SOLID pl with four VERTICES, 
six EDGES, and four 
equivalent 
EQUILATERAL 
TRIAN- 
GULAR 
faces (4{3}). 
It is also UNIFORM 
POLYHEDRON 
&. 
It is described 
by the SCHL;~FLI SYMBOL {3,3} 
and 
the WYTHOFF SYMBOL is 3 12 3. It is the prototype 
of 
the TETRAHEDRAL 
GROUPQ, 
The 
tetrahedron 
is its own 
DUAL 
POLYHEDRON. 
It 
is the 
only 
simple 
POLYHEDRON with 
no DIAGONALS, 
and 
cannot 
be 
STELLATED. 
The 
VERTICES of 
a 
tetrahedron 
are given 
by 
(O,O,&), 
(0, ?#,-ifi), 
(-&--i&&i&), 
and 
(l/z,--i&,-i&), 
or by 
(0, 0, 0), (0, 1, l), 
(1, 0, l), 
(1, 1, 0). In the latter 
case, 
the face planes 
are 
x+y+x=2 
(1) 
x-y-x=0 
(2) 
-x+y-x=0 
(3) 
x+y-x=0. 
(4) 
Let a tetrahedron 
be length 
a on a side. 
The VERTICES 
are located 
at (x, 0, 0), (-d, 
&a/2, 
0), and 
(0, 0, h). 
From 
the figure,

The 
height 
is

J 
(8) 
The CIRCUMRADIUS R is found 
from 
x2 -+ (h - RI2 
= R2 
(9) 
x2 + h2 -2hR+R2 
= R2. 
(10) 
Solving 
gives 
h

(11) 
The INRADIUS T is

0.20412a, 
(12) 
which 
is also 
T=

(13) 
The MIDRADIUS is 
p=Jsdz=a 
i&s

z 0.35355a. 
Plugging 
in for the VERTICES 
(a&,0,0),(-@z,+,O) 
gives 
(14) 
1 and (O,O, @z). 
(15) 
Since a tetrahedron 
is a PYRAMID with a triangular 
base, 
V = +Abh, 
and 
V=

By slicing 
a tetrahedron 
as shown above, 
a SQUARE 
can 
be obtained. 
This 
cut divides 
the tetrahedron 
into 
two 
congruent 
solids 
rotated 
by 90”. 
Now consider 
a general 
(not 
necessarily 
regular) 
tetra- 
hedron, 
defined 
as a convex 
POLYHEDRON consisting 
of 
four 
(not necessarily 
identical) 
TRIANGULAR 
faces. Let 
the tetrahedron 
be specified 
by its VERTICES at (xi, yi) 
wherei= 
1, . . . . 4. Then 
the VOLUME is given 
by

Specifying 
the tetrahedron 
by the three 
EDGE 
vectors 
a, b, and c from 
a given VERTEX, the VOLUME 
is 
V= 
$la-(b 
x c)l. 
.

If the faces are congruent 
and the sides have lengths 
a, 
b, and c, then 
V= 
J 
(a2 -I- b 2 - c2)(a2 + c2 - b2)(b2 +c2 
- a2) 
72 
(20) 
(Klee 
and Wagon 
1991, 
p. 205). 
Let 
a, b, c, and 
d be 
the areas of the four faces, and define 
where 
Ljk 
means 
here the ANGLE between 
the PLANES 
formed 
by the FACES j and k, with 
VERTEX 
along 
their 
intersecting 
EDGE. Then 
a2 = b2+c2+d2-2cdcosB-2bdcosC-2bccosD.

Thue-Morse 
Sequence 
The INTEGER SEQUENCE (also called 
the MORSE-THUE 
SEQUENCE) 
01101001100101101001011001101001... 
(1) 
(Sloane’s 
A010060) 
which 
arises 
in the 
THUE-MORSE 
CONSTANT, It can be generated 
from the SUBSTITUTION 
MAP 
0 -+ 01 
(2) 
1 -+ 10 
(3) 
starting 
with 
0 as follows: 
0-+01+0110+01101001-+.... 
(4) 
Writing 
the sequence 
as a POWER SERIES over the GA- 
LOIS FIELD 
GF(2), 
F(x) 
= 0 + 12 + 1x2 + ox3 + 1X4 + . . . , 
(5) 
then 
F satisfies 
the quadratic 
equation 
(1-t 
z)F2 
+ F = * 
(mod 
2). 
(6) 
This 
equation 
has two solutions, 
F and 
F’, 
where 
F’ is 
the complement 
of F, i.e., 
F+F’= 
1 
1+ 
x + X2 + x3 + . . . = - 1+x’ 
(7) 
which 
is consistent 
with 
the formula 
for the sum of the 
roots 
of a quadratic. 
The 
equality 
(6) can be demon- 
strated 
as follows. 
Let 
(abcdef. 
. . ) be a shorthand 
for 
the POWER series 
a + bx + cx2 + dx3 -I- . . . , 
(8) 
so F(x) 
is (0110100110010110.. 
.)* 
To get 
F2, 
simply 
use the rule for squaring 
POWER SERIES over GF(2) 
(A+ 
B)2 
= A2 + B2 (mod 
2), 
(9) 
which 
extends 
to the simple 
rule for squaring 
a POWER 
SERIES 
(ao+tqx+a2x2+. 
. J2 = ao+a1x2+a2x4+. 
l . (mod 
2), 
(10) 
i.e., space the series out by a factor 
of 2, (0 1 1 0 1 0 0 
1 
l . l ), and insert 
zeros in the 
ODD 
places 
to get 
F2 = (0010100010000010.. 
.). 
(11) 
Then 
multiply 
by x (which 
just 
adds a zero at the front) 
to get 
xF2 
= (00010100010000010.. 
l ). 
(12) 
Adding 
to F2 gives 
(1 +x)F2 
= (0011110011000011.. 
.)* 
(13) 
This 
is the first 
term 
of the quadratic 
equation, 
which 
is the Thue-Morse 
sequence 
with 
each term 
doubled 
up. 
The next 
term 
is F, 
so we have 
(l+ 
x)F2 
= (0011110011000011.. 
l ) 
(14) 
F = (0110100110010110.. 
.).

Thue Sequence 
Thurston’s 
Geometrization 
Conjecture 
The 
sum 
is the 
above 
two sequences 
XORed 
together 
(there 
are 
no 
CARRIES 
because 
we’re 
working 
over 
GF(2)), 
giving 
(1+ 
z)F2 
+ F = (0101010101010101 
l . l ). 
(16) 
We therefore 
have 
(l+ 
x)F2 + F = + 
=x+x~+x~+x~+x’+x~~+... 
(mod2). 
(17) 
The 
Thue-Morse 
sequence 
is an example 
of a cube- 
free 
sequence 
on 
two 
symbols 
(Morse 
and 
Hedlund 
1944), 
i.e., it contains 
no substrings 
of the form 
VVVVW, 
where 
W is any WORD. 
For example, 
it does not 
con- 
tain 
the 
WORDS 
000, 
010101 
or 010010010. 
In 
fact, 
the 
following 
stronger 
statement 
is true: 
the 
Thue- 
Morse 
sequence 
does not 
contain 
any substrings 
of the 
form 
WWa, 
where 
a is the 
first 
symbol 
of VV. 
We 
can 
obtain 
a SQUAREFREE 
sequence 
on 
three 
sym- 
bols 
by doing 
the 
following: 
take 
the 
Thue-Morse 
se- 
quence 
0110100110010110.~~ 
and look 
at the sequence 
of WORDS 
of length 
2 that 
appear: 
01 11 10 01 10 00 
01 11 10 . ..* 
Replace 
01 by 0, 10 by 1, 00 by 2 and 
11 by 2 to get the following: 
021012021. 
l . . Then 
this 
SEQUENCE 
is SQWAREFREE 
(Morse 
and Hedlund 
1944). 
The 
Thue-Morse 
sequence 
has important 
connections 
with 
the 
GRAY 
CODE.

Thurston’s 
Geometrization 
Conjecture 
Thurston’s 
conjecture 
has to do with 
geometric 
struc- 
tures 
on 3-D 
MANIFOLDS. 
Before 
stating 
Thurston’s 
conjecture, 
some 
background 
information 
is useful. 
3- 
dimensional 
MANIFOLDS 
possess 
what 
is known 
as a 
standard 
2-level 
DECOMPOSITION. 
First, 
there 
is the 
CONNECTED 
SUM DECOMPOSITION, 
whichsaysthatev- 
ery COMPACT 
3-MANIFOLD 
is the 
CONNECTED 
SUM of 
a unique 
collection 
of PRIME 
&MANIFOLDS. 
The 
second 
DECOMPOSITION 
is the 
JACO-SHALEN- 
JOHANNSON 
TORUS 
DECOMPOSITION, 
whichstatesthat 
irreducible 
orientable 
COMPACT 
&MANIFOLDS 
have 
a 
canonical 
(up 
to ISOTOPY) 
minimal 
collection 
of dis- 
jointly 
EMBEDDED 
incompressible 
TORI 
such that 
each 
component 
of the S-MANIFOLD 
removed 
by the TORI 
is 
either 
“atoroidal” 
or “Seifert-fibered.” 
Thurston’s 
conjecture 
is that, 
after 
you 
split 
a 3- 
MANIFOLD 
into 
its CONNECTED 
SUM and then 
JACO- 
SHALEN-JOHANNSON 
TORUS 
DECOMPOSITION, 
the re- 
maining 
components 
each admit 
exactly 
one of the fol- 
lowing

Tic-Tat-Toe 
The 
usual 
game 
of tic-tat-toe 
(also 
called 
TICKTACK- 
TOE) 
is 3-in-a-row 
on a 3 x 3 board. 
However, 
a gen- 
eralized 
WIN-A-ROW 
on an n x m board 
can also be 
considered. 
For n = 1 and 2 the first player 
can always 
win. 
If the board 
is at least 
3 x 4, the first 
player 
can 
win for n = 3. 
However, 
for TIC-TAC-TOE 
which 
uses a 3 x 3 board, 
a draw can always be obtained. 
If the board 
is at least 
4 x 30, the first player 
can win for n = 4. For n = 5, a 
draw can always 
be obtained 
on a 5 x 5 board, 
but the 
first player 
can win if the board 
is at least 
15 x 15. The 
cases n = 6 and 7 have not yet been fully 
analyzed 
for 
an n x n board, 
although 
draws 
can always 
be forced 
for n = 8 and 9. On an 00 x 00 board, 
the first player 
can win for n = 1, 2, 3, and 4, but 
a tie can always 
be 
forced 
for n > 8. For 3 x 3 x 3 and 4 x 4 x 4, the first 
player 
can always 
win (Gardner 
1979).

Tiling 
A plane-filling 
arrangement 
of plane 
figures 
or its gener- 
alization 
to higher 
dimensions. 
Formally, 
a tiling 
is a col- 
lection 
of disjoint 
open 
sets, the closures 
of which 
cover 
the plane. 
Given 
a single 
tile, 
the so-called 
first CORONA 
is the set of all tiles that 
have a common 
boundary 
point 
with 
the tile 
(including 
the original 
tile 
itself). 
WANG'S 
CONJECTURE 
(1961) 
stated 
that 
if a set of tiles 
tiled 
the plane, 
then 
they 
could 
always 
be arranged 
to 
do so periodically. 
A periodic 
tiling 
of the PLANE 
by 
POLYGONS 
or SPACE 
by POLYHEDRA 
is called 
a TES- 
SELLATION. 
The 
conjecture 
was refuted 
in 1966 when 
R. Berger 
showed 
that 
an aperiodic 
set of 20,426 
tiles 
exists. 
By 
1971, 
R. Robinson 
had 
reduced 
the 
num- 
ber to six and, in 1974, R. Penrose 
discovered 
an aperi- 
odic set (when color-matching 
rules are included) 
of two 
tiles: 
the so-called 
PENROSE 
TILES. 
(Penrose 
also sued 
the Kimberly 
Clark 
Corporation 
over their 
quilted 
toi- 
let paper, 
which 
allegedly 
resembles 
a Penrose 
aperiodic 
tiling; 
Mirsky 
1997.) 
It is not known 
if there 
is a single 
aperiodic 
tile. 
The 
number 
of tilings 
possible 
for 
convex 
irregular 
POLYGONS 
are given 
in the 
above 
table. 
Any 
TRIAN- 
GLE or convex 
QUADRILATERAL 
tiles 
the plane. 
There 
are at least 
14 classes 
of convex 
PENTAGONAL 
tilings. 
There 
are at least 
three 
aperiodic 
tilings 
of HEXAGONS, 
given 
by the following 
types: 
A + B + C = 360’ 
a-d 
A + B + D = 360” 
a=d,c=e 
(1) 
A=C=E 
a=b,c=d,e= 
f 
(Gardner 
1988). 
Note 
that 
the periodic 
hexagonal 
TES- 
SELLATION 
is a degenerate 
case of all three 
tilings 
with 
A=fj=C=D=E=F 
a=b=c=d=e=f.

Due to Lebesgue

If an n-D 
figure 
is cov- 
ered in any way by sufficiently 
small 
subregions, 
then 
there 
will 
exist points 
which 
belong 
to at least 
n + 1 of 
these subareas. 
Moreover, 
it is always possible 
to find a 
covering 
by arbitrarily 
small 
regions 
for which 
no point 
will belong 
to more 
than 
n + 1 regions.

Topology 
Topology 
is the mathematical 
study 
of properties 
of ob- 
jects 
which 
are preserved 
through 
deformations, 
twist- 
ings, and stretchings. 
(Tearing, 
however, 
is not allowed.) 
A CIRCLE 
is topologically 
equivalent 
to an ELLIPSE 
(into 
which 
it can be deformed 
by stretching) 
and a SPHERE 
is equivalent 
to an ELLIPSOID. 
Continuing 
along 
these 
lines, 
the SPACE of all positions 
of the minute 
hand 
on 
a clock 
is topologically 
equivalent 
to a CIRCLE 
(where 
SPACE of all positions 
means 
“the 
collection 
of all po- 
sitions”). 
Similarly, 
the 
SPACE 
of all positions 
of the 
minute 
and hour 
hands 
is equivalent 
to a TORUS. 
The 
SPACE of all positions 
of the hour, 
minute 
and second 
hands 
form 
a 4-D object 
that 
cannot 
be visualized 
quite 
as simply 
as the former 
objects 
since it cannot 
be placed 
in our 3-D world, 
although 
it can be visualized 
by other 
means. 
There 
is more to topology, 
though. 
Topology 
began with 
the study 
of curves, 
surfaces, 
and 
other 
objects 
in the 
plane 
and 3-space. 
One of the central 
ideas in topology 
is that 
spatial 
objects 
like 
CIRCLES 
and 
SPHERES 
can 
be treated 
as objects 
in their 
own right, 
and knowledge 
of objects 
is independent 
of how they 
are “represented” 
or “embedded” 
in space. 
For example, 
the 
statement 
“if you remove 
a point 
from 
a CIRCLE, 
you get a line 
segment” 
applies 
just 
as well to the 
CIRCLE 
as to an 
ELLIPSE, 
and even to tangled 
or knotted 
CIRCLES, 
since 
the statement 
involves 
only 
topological 
properties. 
Topology 
has to do with 
the 
study 
of spatial 
objects 
such as curves, 
surfaces, 
the space we call our universe, 
the space-time 
of general 
relativity, 
fractals, 
knots, 
man- 
ifolds 
(objects 
with 
some of the same basic spatial 
prop- 
erties 
as our universe), 
phase 
spaces that 
are encoun- 
tered 
in physics 
(such as the space of hand-positions 
of 
a clock), 
symmetry 
groups 
like 
the collection 
of ways of 
rotating 
a top, 
etc. 
The 
“objects” 
of topology 
are often 
formally 
defined 
as 
TOPOLOGICAL 
SPACES. 
If two objects 
have 
the same 
topological 
properties, 
they 
are said to be HOMEOMOR- 
PHIC 
(although, 
strictly 
speaking, 
properties 
that 
are 
not destroyed 
by stretching 
and distorting 
an object 
are 
really 
properties 
preserved 
by 
ISOTOPY, 
not 
HOMEO- 
MORPHISM; 
ISOToPY 
has to do with 
distorting 
embed- 
ded objects, 
while 
HOMEOMURPHISM 
is intrinsic). 
Topology 
is divided 
into 
ALGEBRAIC 
TOPOLOGY 
(also 
called 
COMBINATORIAL 
TOPOLOGY), 
DIFFERENTIAL 
TOPOLOGY, 
and LOW-DIMENSIONAL 
TOPOLOGY. 

Topology 
There 
is also a formal 
definition 
for a topology 
defined 
in 
terms 
of set operations. 
A SET X along 
with a collection 
T of SUBSETS of it is said to be a topology 
if the SUBSETS 
;n T obey 
the following 
properties: 
111 
1. 
2. 
3. 
The 
(trivial) 
subsets 
X and the EMPTY SET 0 are 
in T. 
Whenever 
sets A and B are in T, then 
so is A n B. 
Whenever 
two or more 
sets are in T, then so is their 
UNION 
(Bishop 
and Goldberg 
1980). 
A SET 
X 
for which 
a topology 
T has been 
specified 
is called 
a TOPOLOGICAL SPACE (Munkres 
1975, p. 76). 
For example, 
the SET X = (0, 1, 2, 3) together 
with the 
SUBSETS T = {0}, 
{ 1, 2, 3}, 0, 
(0, 1, 2, 3)) 
comprises 
a topology, 
and X is a TOPOLOGICAL SPACE. 
Topologies 
can be built 
up from TOPOLOGICAL BASES. 
For the REAL NUMBERS, the topology 
is the UNION of 
OPEN INTERVALS.

Torus 
A torus 
is a surface 
having 
GENUS 1, and therefore 
pos- 
sessing a single “HOLE." 
The usual torus 
in 3-D space is 
shaped 
like a donut, 
but the concept 
of the torus 
is ex- 
tremely 
useful 
in higher 
dimensional 
space as well. 
One 
of the more 
common 
uses 
of n-D 
tori 
is in DYNAMICAL 
SYSTEMS. 
A fundamental 
result 
states 
that 
the PHASE 
SPACE trajectories 
of a HAMILTONIAN 
SYSTEM with 
n 
DEGREESOF FREEDOM andpossessing 
n INTEGRALS OF 
MOTION lie on an n-D 
MANIFOLD whichistopologically 
equivalent 
to an n-torus 
(Tabor 
1989). 
The usual 
3-D “ring” 
torus 
is known 
in older 
literature 
as an “ANCHOR RING? 
Let the radius 
from 
the center 
of the hole to the center 
of the torus 
tube 
be c, and the 
Torus 
radius 
of the tube 
be a. Then 
the equation 
in CARTE- 
SIAN COORDINATES is 
(c - @q)2 
-I- x2 = a2.

The parametric 
equations 
of a torus 
are

(c+acosv)sinu 
z = asinv

for u, v f

Three 
types 
of torus, 
known 
as the 
STANDARD TORI, are possible, 
depending 
on the relative 
sizes of a and c. c > a corresponds 
to the RING TORUS 
(shown 
above), 
c = a corresponds 
to a HORN TORUS 
which 
is tangent 
to itself 
at the 
point 
(0, 0, 0), and 
c < a corresponds 
to a self-intersecting 
SPINDLE TORUS 
(Pinkall 
1986). 
If no specification 
is made, 
“torus” 
is taken 
to mean 
RING TORUS. Thethree 
STANDARD TORI areillustrated 
below,

In terms

the new coordinates

(25) 
So in (~1~~1, ~1) coordinates, 
equation

becomes

A torus 
with 
a HOLE 
in its surface 
can 
(21) 
(22) 
be turned 
inside 
out to yield 
an identical 
torus. 
A torus 
can be knotted 
externally 
or internally, 
but 
not both. 
These 
two cases 
are AMBIENT 
ISOTOPIES, 
but not REGULAR 
ISOTOPIES. 
There 
are therefore 
three 
possible 
ways of embedding 
a 
torus 
with 
zero or one KNOT. 
- 2cy/(x1 
cos 8 - 251 sin8)2

(x1 cod

so 
x12+y12+z12+c2-2c 
(x1 cos 8 - 251 sin8)2 
+ y12 = a2. 
(29) 
In the ~1 = 0 plane, 
plugging 
in (23) and factoring 
gives 
[xl2 + (y1 - a) 2 - c2][x1” 
+ (y1 + a) - c”] = 0. 
(30) 
This 
gives the CIRCLES

The 
totient 
function 
4(n), 
also 
called 
Euler’s 
totient 
function, 
is defined 
as the 
number 
of POSITIVE 
INTE- 
GERS < 
n which 
are RELATIVELY 
PRIME 
to 
(i.e., 
do 
not contain 
any factor 
in common 
with) 
n, where 
1 is 
counted 
as being 
RELATIVELY 
PRIME 
to all 
numbers. 
Since 
a number 
less than 
or equal 
to and RELATIVELY 
PRIME 
to a given 
number 
is called 
a TOTATIVE, 
the to- 
tient 
function 
4(n) 
can be simply 
defined 
as the number 
of TOTATIVES 
of n. For example, 
there 
are eight 
TOTA- 
TIVES of 24 (1, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, and 23), so 4(24) 
= 8. 
By convention, 
4(O) = 1. The 
first 
few values 
of 4(n) 
for n = 1, 2, . . l are 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 2, 6, 4, 6, 4, 10, . . . 
(Sloane’s 
AOOOOlO). 
4(n) 
is plotted 
above for small 
n. 
For a PRIME 
p, 
4(P) 
= P - 
1, 
(1) 
since all numbers 
less than 
p are RELATIVELY 
PRIME 
to 
p. If m = p” is a POWER 
of a PRIME, 
then 
the numbers 
which have a common 
factor 
with m are the multiples 
of 
p: p, 2p, . . . , (pa-l)p* 
There 
are pa-’ 
of these multiples, 
so the number 
of factors 
RELATIVELY 
PRIME 
to p” is 
($(p”) = pa - pa-l 
= pa-l(p 
- 1) z pa 
( 
> 
I- 
; 
* (2) 
Now take a general 
m divisible 
by p. Let &(m) 
be the 
number 
of 'POSITIVE 
INTEGERS 
5 m not DIVISIBLE 
by 
p. As before, 
p, 2p, . . . , (m/p)p 
have common 
factors, 
so 
&(m) 
=m- 
F 
=m 
1-b 
. 
( 
> 
(3) 
Now let q be some other 
PRIME 
dividing 
m. 
The 
INTE- 
GERS divisible 
by q are q, 2q, . . . , (m/q)q. 
But 
these du- 
plicate 
pq, 2pq, . . . , (m/pq)pq. 
So the number 
of terms 
which 
must 
be subtracted 
from 
tip to obtain 
& 
is 
=m(l-i)-:(1--i) 
=m(d) 
(1-i).

By induction, 
the general 
case is then

TOWER 
Towers 
of Hanoi 
A PUZZLE 
invented 
by E. Lucas in 1883. 
Given 
a stack of 
n disks arranged 
from 
largest 
on the bottom 
to smallest 
on top placed 
on a rod, 
together 
with 
two empty 
rods, 
the towers of Hanoi 
puzzle 
asks for the minimum 
number 
of moves required 
to reverse the order of the stack (where 
moves are allowed 
only if they 
place smaller 
disks on top 
of larger 
disks). 
The 
problem 
is ISoMORPHIC 
to finding 
a HAMILTONIAN 
PATH on an n-HYPERCUBE. 
For n disks, 
the number 
of moves 
by the RECURRENCE 
RELATION 
h, 
required 
is given 
hn = 2h n-1+ 
1. 
Solving 
gives 
h, = 2” - 1. 
The 
number 
of disks 
moved 
after 
the 
&h 
step is the 
same as the element 
which 
needs to be added 
or deleted 
in the kth 
ADDEND 
of the 
RYSER 
FORMULA 
(Gardner 
1988, Vardi 
1991). 
A HANOI 
GRAPH 
can be constructed 
whose VERTICES 
correspond 
to legal 
configurations 
of n towers of Hanoi, 
where 
the VERTICES 
are adjacent 
if the corresponding 
configurations 
can be obtained 
by a legal 
move. 
It can 
be solved 
using 
a binary 
GRAY 
CODE. 
Poole 
(1994) 
gives 
Mathematic@ 
(Wolfram 
Research, 
Champaign, 
IL) 
routines 
for solving 
an arbitrary 
disk 
configuration 
in the 
fewest possible 
moves. 
The 
proof 
of minimality 
is achieved 
using 
the LUCAS 
CORRESPON- 
DENCE which relates 
PASCAL’S 
TRIANGLE 
to the HANOI 
GRAPH. 
ALGORITHMS 
are known 
for transferring 
disks 
for four pegs, but 
none 
has been 
proved 
minimal.

Tract& 
The tractrix 
is the CATENARY 
INVOLUTE 
described 
by a 
point 
initially 
on the vertex. 
It has a constant 
NEGATIVE 
CURVATURE 
and is sometimes 
called 
the TRACTORY 
or 
EQUITANGENTIAL 
CURVE. 
The tractrix 
was first studied 
by Huygens 
in 1692, 
who gave it the name 
“tractrix.” 
Later, 
Leibniz, 
Johann 
Bernoulli, 
and others 
studied 
the 
curve. 
master 
The 
tractrix 
arises from 
the following 
problem 
posed to 
Leibniz: 
What 
is the path 
of an object 
starting 
off with 
a vertical 
offset when it is dragged 
along 
by a string 
of 
constant 
length 
being 
pulled 
along 
a straight 
horizontal 
line? 
By associating 
the object 
with 
a dog, 
the string 
with 
a leash, 
and the pull 
along 
a horizontal 
line 
with 
the 
dog’s 
master, 
the 
curve 
has the 
descriptive 
name 
HUNDKURVE 
(hound 
curve) 
in German. 
Leibniz 
found 
the curve using 
the fact that 
the 
axis is an asymptote 
to the tractrix 
(MacTutor 
Archive). 
In CARTESIAN 
COORDINATES 
the tractrix 
has equation 
X = a sech-’

When 
a tractrix 
is rotated 
around 
its asymptote, 
a 
PSEUD~SPHERE 
results. 
This 
is a surface 
of constant 
NEGATIVE 
CURVATURE. 
For a tractrix, 
the length 
of 
a TANGENT 
from 
its point 
of contact 
to an asymptote 
is constant 
l 
The 
AREA 
between 
the 
tractrix 
and 
its 
asymptote 
is finite.

Transcendental 
Number 
A number 
which 
is not the ROOT of any POLYNOMIAL 
equation 
with INTEGER COEFFICIENTS, meaning 
that 
it 
not an ALGEBRAIC NUMBER of any degree, 
is said to be 
transcendental. 
This 
definition 
guarantees 
that 
every 
transcendental 
number 
must 
also be TRRATIONAL, since 
a RATIONAL NUMBER is, by definition, 
an ALGEBRAIC 
NUMBER of degree 
one. 
Transcendental 
numbers 
are important 
in the 
history 
of mathematics 
because 
their 
investigation 
provided 
the 
firstproofthat 
CIRCLE SQUARING, one of the GEOMET- 
RIC PROBLEMS OF ANTIQUITY 
which 
had bafied 
math- 
ematicians 
for more 
than 
2000 years was, in fact, insolu- 
ble. 
Specifically, 
in order for a number 
to be produced 
by 
a GEOMETRIC CONSTRUCTION using 
the ancient 
Greek 
rules, 
it must 
be either 
RATIONAL or a very special 
kind 
of ALGEBRAIC NUMBER known 
as a EUCLIDEAN NUM- 
BER. Because 
the number 
r is transcendental, 
the con- 
struction 
cannot 
be done 
according 
to the Greek 
rules. 
Georg 
Cantor 
was the first 
to prove 
the EXISTENCE of 
transcendental 
numbers. 
Liouville 
subsequently 
showed 
how to construct 
special 
cases (such 
as LIOUVILLE'S 
CONSTANT) using LIOUVILLE'S RATIONAL APPROXIMA- 
TION THEOREM. In particular, 
he showed that 
any num- 
ber which 
has a rapidly 
converging 
sequence 
of ratio- 
nal approximations 
must 
be transcendental. 
For many 
years, 
it was only 
known 
how to determine 
if special 
classes of numbers 
were transcendental. 
The 
determi- 
nation 
of the status 
of more 
general 
numbers 
was con- 
sidered 
an important 
enough 
unsolved 
problem 
that 
it 
was one of HILBERT'S PROBLEMS. 
Great 
progress 
was subsequently 
made 
by GELFOND'S 
THEOREM, 
which 
gives a general 
rule for determining 
if 
special 
cases of numbers 
of the form 
P 
are transcen- 
dental. 
Baker 
produced 
a further 
revolution 
by proving 
the transcendence 
of sums of numbers 
of the form 
cy In p 
for ALGEBRAIC NUMBERS a and 0. 
The number 
e was proven 
to be transcendental 
by Her- 
mite 
in 1873, 
and PI 
(IT) by Lindemann 
in 1882.

Transposition 
An exchange 
of two elements 
of a SET with 
all others 
staying

A transposition 
is therefore 
a PER- 
MUTATION of two elements. 
For example, 
the swapping 
of 2 and 5 to take the list 
123456 
to 153426 
is a trans-

Problem 
A fast boat is overtaking 
a slower one when fog suddenly 
sets in. 
At this 
point, 
the boat 
being 
pursued 
changes 
course, 
but 
not speed. 
How should 
the pursuing 
vessel 
proceed 
in order 
to be sure of catching 
the other 
boat? 
The 
amazing 
answer 
is that 
the pursuing 
boat 
should 
continue 
to the point 
where the slow boat 
would 
be if it 
had set its course directly 
for the pursuing 
boat when the 
fog set in. 
If the boat 
is not there, 
it should 
proceed 
in 
a SPIRAL 
whose origin 
is the point 
where the slow boat 
was when the fog set in. The 
SPIRAL 
can be constructed 
in such a way that 
the two boats 
will intersect 
before 
a 
complete 
turn 
is made.

A tree is a mathematical 
structure 
which 
can be viewed 
as either 
a GRAPH 
or as a DATA 
STRUCTURE. 
The two 
views are equivalent, 
since a tree 
DATA 
STRUCTURE 
con- 
tains 
not 
only 
a set of elements, 
but 
also connections 
between 
elements, 
giving 
a tree graph. 
A tree graph 
is a set of straight 
line segments 
connected 
at their 
ends containing 
no closed 
loops 
(cycles). 
A tree 
with 
n nodes 
has n - 1 EDGES. 
The points 
of connection 
are known 
as FORKS 
and the segments 
as BRANCHES. 
Final 
segments 
and 
the nodes 
at their 
ends are called 
LEAVES. 
A tree with two BRANCHES 
at each FORK 
and 
with 
one or two LEAVER 
at the end of each branch 
is 
called 
a BINARY 
TREE. 
When 
a special 
node 
is designated 
to turn 
a tree 
into 
a ROOTED 
TREE, 
it is called 
the ROOT 
(or sometimes 
“EVE?) 
In such a tree, 
each of the nodes 
which 
is one 
EDGE further 
away from a given EDGE is called 
a CHILD, 
and nodes 
connected 
to the same 
node 
are then 
called 
SIBLINGS. 
Note 
that 
two BRANCHES 
placed 
end-to-end 
are equiva- 
lent to a single 
BRANCH 
which 
means, 
for example, 
that 
there

called 
the TRIGON. 
All

convex. 
An ACUTE 
TRIANGLE 
is a triangle 
whose three 
angles 
are all ACUTE. A triangle 
with 
all sides equal

A triangle 
with 
two sides equal 
is called 
ISOSCELES. 
A triangle

The sum of ANGLES in a triangle 
is 180”. 
This 
can be es- 
tablished 
as follows. 
Let DAEI 
IBC 
(DAE 
be PARALLEL 
to BC) 
in the above 
diagram, 
then 
the angles 
pi and p 

Triangle 
satisfy 
Q = LDAB 
= LABC 
and p = LEAC 
= LBCE, 
as indicated. 
Adding 
y, it follows 
that 
a + p + y = 180”, 
(1) 
since the sum of angles 
for the line 
segment 
must 
equal 
two RIGHT ANGLES. Therefore, 
the sum of angles 
in the 
triangle 
is also 180”. 
Let 
S stand 
for a triangle 
side and A for an angle, 
and 
let a set of Ss and As be concatenated 
such that 
adja- 
cent letters 
correspond 
to adjacent 
sides and angles 
in a 
triangle. 
Triangles 
are uniquely 
determined 
by specify- 
ing three 
sides (SSS THEOREM), two angles 
and a side 
(AAS 
THEOREM), or two sides with 
an adjacent 
angle 
(SAS 
THEOREM). 
In each of these cases, the unknown 
three 
quantities 
(there 
are three 
sides and three 
angles 
total) 
can be uniquely 
determined. 
Other 
combinations 
of sides and angles 
do not 
uniquely 
determine 
a trian- 
gle: 
three 
angles 
specify 
a triangle 
only 
modulo 
a scale 
size (AAA 
THEOREM), and one angle 
and two sides not 
containing 
it may specify 
one, two, or no triangles 
(ASS 
THEOREM).

Equilateral 
Triangle 
The RULER and COMPASS construction 
of the triangle 
can be accomplished 
as follows. 
In the above figure, 
take 
OpO as a RADIUS and draw OB 
i 
0pO. 
Then 
bisect 
UB 
and construct 
p#i 
IlO~~. 
Extending 
BO 
to locate 
ps 
then 
gives the EQUILATERAL TRIANGLE APlPzP3* 
In Proposition 
IV.4 
of the Elements, 
Euclid 
showed how 
to inscribe 
a CIRCLE (the INCIRCLE) in a given 
triangle 
by locating 
the CENTER as the point 
of intersection 
of 
ANGLE BISECTORS. In Proposition 
IV.5, 
he showed how 
to circumscribe 
a CIRCLE (the CIRCUMCIRCLE) about 
a 
given 
triangle 
by locating 
the CENTER as the point 
of 
intersection 
of the perpendicular 
bisectors. 
If the coordinates 
of the triangle

It is not known 
if a triangle 
with 
INTEGER sides, 
ME- 
DIANS, and AREA exists 
(although 
there 
are incorrect 
PROOFS of the 
impossibility 
in the 
literature). 
How- 
ever, R. L. Rathbun, 
A. Kemnitz, 
and R. H. Buchholz 
have shown that 
there 
are infinitely 
many 
triangles 
with 
RATIONAL sides (HERONIAN TRIANGLES) with 
two 
RA- 
TIONAL MEDIANS (Guy 1994). 
In the following 
paragraph, 
assume 
the 
specified 
sides 
and angles 
are adjacent 
to each other. 
Specifying 
three 
ANGLES does not uniquely 
define 
a triangle, 
but any two 
triangles 
with 
the same ANGLES are similar 
(the AAA 
THEOREM). Specifying 
two ANGLES A and L3 and a side 
a uniquely 
determines 
a triangle 
with AREA 
A= 
a2 sin B sin C 
a2 sinB 
sin(r 
- A - B) 
2sinA 
= 
2 sin A 
(29) 
(the 
AAS 
THEOREM). 
Specifying 
an ANGLE A, a side 
c, and 
an ANGLE B uniquely 
specifies 
a triangle 
with 
AREA 
n 
A= 
CL 
2(cot A + cot B) 
(30) 
(the ASA 
THEOREM). 
Given 
a triangle 
with 
two sides, 
a the smaller 
and c the larger, 
and one known 
ANGLE 
A, ACUTE and opposite 
a, if sin A < a/c, 
there 
are two 
possible 
triangles. 
If sin A = a/c, 
there 
is one possible 
triangle. 
If sin A > a/c, 
there 
are no possible 
triangles. 
This 
is the 
ASS THEOREM. 
Let 
a be the base length 
and h be the height. 
Then 
A = $uh 
= $ucsinB 
(31) 

lliangle 
lliangle 
1837 
(the SAS 
THEOREM). 
Finally, 
if all three 
sides are spec- 
ified, 
a unique 
triangle 
is determined 
with 
AREA 
given 
by HERON’S 
FORMULA 
or by 
*2, 
(32) 
where 
R is the CIRCUMRADIUS. 
This 
is the SSS THEO- 
REM. 
There 
are four 
CIRCLES 
which 
are tangent 
to the sides 
of a triangle, 
one internal 
and the rest external. 
Their 
centers 
are the points 
of intersection 
of the ANGLE 
BI- 
SECTORS 
of the triangle. 
Any triangle 
can be positioned 
such that 
its shadow 
der an orthogonal 
projection 
is EQUILATERAL.

Center 
A triangle 
center 
is a point 
whose TRILINEAR 
CO~RDI- 
NATES are defined 
in terms 
of the side lengths 
and an- 
gles of a TRIANGLE. 
The function 
giving 
the coordinates 
QI : p : y is called 
the 
TRIANGLE 
CENTER 
FUNCTION. 
The 
four ancient 
centers 
are the CENTROID, 
INCENTER, 
CIRCUMCENTER, 
and 
ORTHOCENTER. 
For a listing 
of 
these and other 
triangle 
centers,

Gauss proved

the notation

All 
EVEN PERFECT NUMBERS are triangular 
T* with 
PRIME p. Furthermore,every 
EVEN PERFECT NUMBER 
P > 6 is of the form 
P = 1 + 9T, 
= T3n+l, 
(13) 
where Tn is a triangular 
number 
with 
n = 8j + 2 (Eaton 
1995, 1996). 
Therefore, 
the nested 
expression 
9(9*-s 
(9(9(9(9T, 
+ 1) + 1) + 1) + 1). . . + 1) + 1 (14) 
generates 
triangular

for any Tn. An INTEGER k

IFF 8k + 1 is a SQUARE NUMBER

Numbers

the 
BINOMIAL COEFFICIENT equation

of which 
are (m, n)

(22,

The 
smallest 
of two INTEGERS 
for which 
n3 - 13 is four 
times 
a triangular 
number 
is 5 (Cesaro 
1886; Le Lionnais 
1983, p* 56).

This 
case is equivalent 
to the statement 
that 
every num- 
ber of the form 
8nz + 3 is a sum of three ODD SQUARES 
(Duke 
1997). 
D irichlet 
derived 
the number 
of ways in 
which 
an INTEGER m, can be expressed 
as the 
sum 
of 
three 
triangular 
numbers 
(Duke 
1997). 
The 
result 
is 
particularly 
simple 
for a PRIME of the form 
8m. + 3, in 
which 
case it is the number 
of squares 
mod 
8m+3 
minus 
the number 
of nonsquares 
mod 
8nz + 3 in the INTERVAL 
4m, + 1 (Deligne 
1973). 
The only triangular 
numbers 
which 
are the PRODUCT of 
three consecutive 
INTEGERS are 6, 120,210,990,

Given 
a TRIANGLE 
with 
angles 
(r/p, 
r/q, 
X/T), 
the 
resulting 
symmetry 
GROUP 
is called 
a (p, q, r) triangle 
group 
(also known 
as a SPHERICAL 
TESSELLATION). 
In 
3-D, 
such GROUPS 
must 
satisfy 
111 
-+q+;>l, 
P 
and so the only 
solutions 
are (2,2, n), 
(2,3,3), 
(2,3,4), 
and (2,3,5) 
(B a 
and Coxeter 
1987). 
The group 
(2,3,6) 
11 
gives rise to the semiregular 
planar 
TESSELLATIONS 
of 
types 
1, 2, 5, and 7. The 
group 
(2,3,7) 
gives hyperbolic 
tessellations. 
Triangulation 
Triangulation 
is the 
division 
of a surface 
into 
a set of 
TRIANGLES, 
usually 
with 
the restriction 
that 
each TRI- 
ANGLE 
side is entirely 
shared 
by two adjacent 
TRIAN- 
GLES. 
It 
was proved 
in 1930 that 
every

Tricolorable 
A projection 
of a LINK 
is tricolorable 
if each 
of the 
strands 
in the projection 
can be colored 
in one of three 
different 
colors 
such that, 
at each crossing, 
all three 
col- 
ors come together 
or only one does and at least two dif- 
ferent 
colors 
are used. 
The 
TREFUIL 
KNOT 
and trivial 
2-link 
are tricolorable, 
but 
the 
UNKNOT, 
WHITEHEAD 
LINK, 
and FIGURE-OF-EIGHT 
KNOT 
are not. 
If the projection 
of a knot 
is tricolorable, 
then 
REIDE- 
MEISTER 
MOVES 
on the knot 
preserve 
tricolorability, 
so 
either 
every projection 
of a knot 
is tricolorable 
or none 
is.

Trigonometry 
The 
study 
of ANGLES 
and of the angular 
relationships 
of planar 
and 
3-D 
figures 
is known 
as trigonometry. 
The 
trigonometric 
functions 
(also called 
the CIRCULAR 
FUNCTIONS) 
comprising 
trigonometry 
are 
the 
COSE- 
CANT 
CSCX, COSINE 
COW, 
COTANGENT 
C&z, 
SECANT 
set X, SINE 
sin 2, and TANGENT 
tang. 
The 
inverses 
of 
these 
functions 
are denoted 
csc-’ 
z, cos-’ 
LC, cot-l 
2, 
set-’

x, and tan-l 
X. 
Note 
that 
the f-’ 
NOTA- 
TION 
here means 
INVERSE 
FUNCTION, 
not f to the -1 
POWER. 
The trigonometric 
functions 
are most 
simply 
defined 
us- 
ing the 
UNIT 
CIRCLE. 
Let 
8 be an ANGLE 
measured 
counterclockwise 
from 
the X-AXIS 
along 
an ARC of the 
CIRCLE. 
Then 
co4 
is the horizontal 
coordinate 
of the 
ARC endpoint, 
and sin 19 is the vertical 
component. 
The 
RATIO 
sin O/ cos 8 is defined 
as tan& 
As a result 
of this 

1848 
Tkigonometry 
Llligonometry 
definition, 
the trigonometric 
functions 
are periodic 
with 
period 
2~, so 
func(2nn 
+ 0) = func(e), 
(1) 
where 
n is an INTEGER 
and func is a trigonometric 
func- 
tion. 
From 
the PYTHAGOREAN 
THEOREM, 
sin’ 8 + cos2 8 = 1.

Therefore, 
it is also true 
that

OSBORNE’S

gives 
a prescription 
for converting 
trigonometric 
identities 
to analogous

for HY- 
PERBOLIC 
FUNCTIONS. 
The 
ANGLES

(with 
m, n integers) 
for which 
the 
trigonometric 
function 
may 
be expressed 
in terms

extraction 
of real numbers 
are limited 
to val- 
ues of m which 
are precisely 
those 
which 
produce 
con- 
structible 
POLYGONS. 
Gauss 
showed 
these to be of the 
form 
m 
= 
ZkPlP2 
’ 
l ‘Ps, 
(11) 
where k is an INTEGER 
2 0 and the pi are distinct 
FER- 
MAT PRIMES. 
The 
first 
few values 
are m = 1, 2, 3, 4, 
5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 17, 20, . . . (Sloane’s 
AOOMOI). 
Although 
formulas 
for trigonometric 
functions 
may 
be 
found 
analytically 
for other 
m as well, 
the expressions 
involve 
ROOTS 
of COMPLEX 
NUMBERS 
obtained 
by solv- 
ing a CUBIC, 
QUARTIC,

The 
cases m = 7 and

respectively.

Trigonometric

of nr/7 
for n an integer 
cannot 
be expressed 
in terms 
of sums,

extractions 
on real rational

also means 
that 
the HEPTAGON 
is not a CONSTRUCTIBLE POLYGON. 
However,

Given 
a TRIANGLE AABC, 
the trilinear 
coordinates 
of 
a point 
P with respect 
to AABC 
are an ordered 
TRIPLE 
of numbers, 
each of which 
is PROPORTIONAL to the di- 
rected 
distance 
from 
P to one of the side lines. 
Trilinear 
coordinates 
are denoted 
QI : 0 : y or (q&r) 
and 
also 
are known 
as BARYCENTRIC COORDINATES, HOMOGE- 
NEOUS COORDINATES, or Yrilinears.” 
In trilinear 
coordinates, 
the three VERTICES A, B, and 
C are given 
by 1 : 0 : 0, 0 : 1 : 0, and 0 : 0 : 1. Let the 
point 
P in the above 
diagram 
have trilinear 
coordinates 
QI : p : y and 
lie at distances 
a’, 
b’, and 
c’ from 
the 
sides BC, 
AC, and AB, 
respectively. 
Then 
the distances 
a’ c kar, b’ = /@, and c’ = kr 
can be found 
by writing 
Aa for the AREA of ABPC, 
and similarly 
for Ab and 
AC* We then 
have 
A = A, 
+ Ab + AC = $,aa’ + i bb’ + $x’ 
= $(aka+bkP$cky) 
= $k(acrtb/3fcy).

so

where A is the AREA of AABC 
and a, b, and c are the 
lengths 
of its sides. 
When 
the values 
of the coordinates 
are taken 
as the actual 
lengths 
(i.e., 
the trilinears 
are 
chosen 
so that 
k = 
l), 
the 
coordinates 
are known 
as 
EXACT TRILINEAR 
COORDINATES. 
Trilinear 
coordinates 
are unchanged

tiplied

Trisection 
1 
$13 
trisection 
Angle 
trisection 
is the division 
of an arbitrary 
ANGLE 
into 
three 
equal 
ANGLES. 
It was one of the three 
GEO- 
METRIC 
PROBLEMS 
OF ANTIQUITY 
for which 
solutions 
using 
only 
COMPASS 
and STRAIGHTEDGE 
were sought. 
The 
problem 
was algebraically 
proved 
impossible 
by 
Wantael 
(1836). 
Although 
trisection 
is not possible 
for a general 
ANGLE 
using 
a Greek 
construction, 
there 
are some specific 
an- 
gles, such as 7r/2 and 7r radians 
(90’ 
and 180”, 
respec- 
tively), 
which 
can be trisected. 
Furthermore, 
some 
AN- 
GLES are geometrically 
trisectable, 
but 
cannot 
be con- 
structed 
in the 
first 
place, 
such as 3n/7 
(Honsberger 
1991). 
In addition, 
trisection 
of an arbitrary 
angle 
can 
be accomplished 
using a marked 
RULER 
(a NEUSIS 
CON- 
STRUCTION) 
as illustrated 
below 
(Courant 
and Robbins 
1996). 
An ANGLE 
can also be divided 
into three

NUMBER)

The 
tritangent 
of a CUBIC 
SURFACE 
is a PLANE 
which 
intersects 
the 
surface 
in 
three 
mutually 
intersecting 
lines. 
Each 
intersection 
of two lines 
is then 
a tangent 
point 
of the surface.

According 
to the Nobel 
Prize-winning 
physicist 
Richard 
Feynman 
(1985), 
mathematicians 
designate 
any 
THE- 
OREM 
as “trivial” 
once a proof 
has been 
obtained-no 
matter 
how difficult 
the theorem 
was to prove 
in the 
first 
place. 
There 
are therefore 
exactly 
two types 
of 
true 
mathematical 
propositions: 
trivial 
ones, and those 
which 
have not yet been 
proven.

Transformation 
A transformation 
of a POLYNOMIAL equation 
f(z) 
= 0 
which 
is of the form 
y = g(x)/h(z) 
where g and h are 
POLYNOMIALS and 
h(x) 
does not 
vanish 
at a root 
of 
f(z) 
= 0. The 
CUBIC 
EQUATION 
is a special 
case of such 
a transformation. 
Tschirnhaus 
(1683) 
showed 
that 
a 
POLYNOMIAL of degree n > 2 can be reduced 
to a form in 
which 
the xnB1 and xn-’ 
terms 
have 0 COEFFICIENTS. 
In 
1786, 
E. S. Bring 
showed 
that 
a general 
QUINTIC 
EQUATION 
can be reduced 
to the form 
x5+px+q=o. 
In 1834, G. B. Jerrard 
showed that 
a Tschirnhaus 
trans- 
formation 
can be used to eliminate 
the x=-l, 
znm2, 
and 
X n-3 
terms 
for a general 
POLYNOMIAL equation 
of de- 
gree n > 3.

The

A twin

Thus 
we can speak 
of 2p-twin

A kp-twin

y = x + kp. 
The set of kptwin

Q = p#, 
where p# 
is the PRIMORIAL of p. That 
is, if (x, y) is a

then 
so is (z + 4, y + q). 
A fundamental 
Izp-twin

x in the fundamental

[O, 4). 
The 
set of fundamental 
kp-twin

is 
symmetric 
with 
respect

that 
is, if (x, y) is a twin peak on [0, q), then so is (q-y,

Twin 
Primes 
The 
last 
of these 
is the 
largest 
known 
twin 
prime 
pair. 
In 
1995, 
Nicely 
discovered 
a flaw in the 
Intel@ 
PentiumTM 
microprocessor 
by 
computing 
the 
recip- 
rocals 
of 824,633,702,441 
and 
824,633,702,443, 
which 
should 
have been accurate 
to 19 decimal 
places but were 
incorrect 
from 
the tenth 
decimal 
place 
on (Cipra 
1995, 
1996; Nicely 
1996). 
If 72 > 2, the INTEGERS n and n + 2 form 
a pair 
of twin 
- 
primes 
IFF 
4K n- 
l)!+l]+ 
n E 0 (mod 
n(n+2)). 
(4) 
n = pp’ where (p, p’) is a pair 
of twin 
primes 
IFF 
$(n)a(n) 
= (n - 3)(n + 1) 
(5) 
(Ribenboim 
1989). 
The 
values 
of nz(n) 
were found 
by 
Brent 
(1976) 
up to n = 10? 
T. Nicely 
calculated 
them 
up to 10 l4 in his calculation 
of BRUN'S CONSTANT. 
The 
following 
table 
gives 
the

Whitehead

devised 
a hierarchy 
of 
“types” 
in order 
to eliminate 
self-referential

from 
Principia 
Mathematics, 
which 
purported 
to derive 
all of mathematics 
from 
logic. 
A set of the lowest type 
contained 
only objects 
(not sets), a set of the next higher 
type could 
contain 
only objects 
or sets of the lower type, 
and so on. 
Unfortunately, 
G~DEL'S INCOMPLETENESS

Let 
X be a SET, and 
let XN 
(where 
N is the SET of 
NATURAL NUMBERS) denote 
the collection 
of sequences 
of elements 
of X (i.e., 
all the possible 
sequences 
x1, ~2, 
x3,*** 
). For sequences 
a = (al, ~2,. . .), b = (bl, 62,. . .), 
let it be the number 
of initial 
places where the sequences 
agree, 
i.e., al = bl, a2 = b2, . . + , a, 
= b,, 
but 
a,+1 
#

Take 
n = 0 if al # bl. Then 
defining 
d(u, b) = 2+ 
gives an ultrametric.

Sev- 
eral tricks 
can be used to speed the search for square

especially 
by examining

This

to that 
in Robert 
Louis 
Steven- 
son’s “The 
Imp

in which 
you are offered 
the opportunity 
to buy, for whatever 
price 
you wish, 
a 
bottle 
containing 
a genie 
who will 
fulfill 
your 
every de- 
sire. 
The 
only 
catch 
is that 
the bottle 
must 
thereafter 
be resold for a price smaller 
than 
what you paid for it, or 
you will 
be condemned 
to live out the rest of your days 
in excrutiating 
torment. 
Obviously, 
no one would 
buy 
the bottle 
for 15 since he would 
have to give the bottle 
away, but 
no one would 
accept 
the bottle 
knowing 
he 
would 
be unable 
to get rid of it. 
Similarly, 
no one would 
buy it for 29!, and so on. 
However, 
for some reasonably 
large 
amount, 
it will 
always 
be possible 
to find 
a next 
buyer, 
so the bottle 
will be bought 
(Paulos 
1995).

Function 
A prisoner 
is told 
that 
he will 
be hanged 
on some 
day 
between 
Monday 
and Friday, 
but that 
he will not know 
on which 
day the hanging 
will occur 
before 
it happens. 
He cannot 
be hanged 
on Friday, 
because 
if he were still 
alive 
on Thursday, 
he would 
know that 
the hanging 
will 
occur 
on Friday, 
but 
he has been told 
he will not know 
the day of his hanging 
in advance. 
He cannot 
be hanged 
Thursday 
for the same reason,

Uniform 
Polyhedron 
The 
uniform 
polyhedra 
are POLYHEDRA with 
identical 
VERTICES. Coxeter 
et al. (1954) 
conjectured 
that 
there 
are 75 such polyhedra 
in which 
only 
two faces are al- 
lowed 
to meet 
at an EDGE, 
and this 
was subsequently 
proven. 
(However, 
when any EVEN number 
of faces may 
meet, 
there 
are 76 polyhedra.) 
If the five pentagonal 
PRISMS are included, 
the number 
rises to 80.

in which 
each DENOMINA- 
TOR is ODD (Breusch

Unknot 
A closed 
loop 
which 
is not 
KNOTTED. 
In the 
193Os, 
by making 
use of REIDEMEISTER MOVES, Reidemeister 
first 
proved 
that 
KNOTS exist 
which 
are distinct 
from 
the unknot. 
He proved 
this 
by COLORING each part 
of 
a knot 
diagram 
with 
one of three 
colors. 
The KNOT SUM of two unknots 
is another 
unknot. 
The JONES POLYNOMIAL of the unknot 
is defined 
to give 
the normalization 
v(t) 
= 1. 
Haken 
(1961) 
d evised 
an ALGORITHM 
to tell 
if a knot 
projection 
is the 
unknot. 
The 
ALGORITHM 
is so com- 
plicated, 
however, 
that 
it has never 
been implemented. 
Although 
it is not immediately 
obvious, 
the unknot 
is a 
PRIME KNOT.

Unknotting 
Number 
The 
smallest 
number 
of times 
a KNOT must 
be passed 
through 
itself 
to untie 
it. 
Lower 
bounds 
can be com- 
puted 
using 
relatively 
straightforward 
techniques, 
but it 
is in general 
difficult 
to determine 
exact 
values. 
Many 
unknotting 
numbers 
can be determined 
from 
a knot’s 
SIGNATURE. 
A KNOT with 
unknotting 
number 
1 is a 
PRIME KNOT (Scharlemann 
1985). 
It is not always true 
that 
the unknotting 
number 
is achieved 
in a projection 
with 
the minimal 
number 
of crossings. 
The following 
table 
is from 
Kirby 
(1997, pp. S&89), 
with 
the values 
for IO 139 and 
10152 taken 
from 
Kawamura. 
The 
unknotting 
numbers 
for 
10154 and 
10161 can be 
found 
using MENASCO'S THEOREM (Stoimenow 
1998).

Untouchable 
Number 
An untouchable 
number 
is an INTEGER which 
is not the 
sum of the PROPER 
DIVISORS of any other 
number. 
The 
first few are 2, 5, 52, 88, 96, 120, 124, 146, , , . (Sloane’s 
AOO5114). 
Erd& 
has proven 
that 
there 
are infinitely 
many. 
It is thought 
that 
5 is the only 
ODD 
untouchable 
number.

The 
simplest 
valuation 
is the 
ABSOLUTE 
VALTJE for 
REAL 
NUMBERS. 
A valuation 
satisfying 
(4b) 
is called 
non-ARCHIMEDEAN 
VALUATION; 
otherwise, 
it is called 
ARCHIMEDEAN. 
If 19 11 is a valuation 
on K and A 2 1, then we can define 
a new valuation 
1 . 12 by 
This 
does indeed 
give a valuation, 
but 
possibly 
with 
a 
different 
constant 
C in AXIOM 4. If two valuations 
are 
related 
in this 
way, they 
are said to be equivalent, 
and 
this 
gives 
an equivalence 
relation 
on the 
collection 
of 
all valuations 
on K. 
Any valuation 
is equivalent 
to one 
which 
satisfies 
the triangle 
inequality 
(4a). 
In view of 
this, 
we need only 
to study 
valuations 
satisfying 
(4a), 
and we often 
view axioms 
(4) and (4a) as interchange- 
able (although 
this is not strictly 
true). 
If two valuations 
are equivalent, 
then they are both 
non- 
ARCHIMEDEAN 
or 
both 
ARCHIMEDEAN. 
Q, Iw, and c 
with 
the usual 
Euclidean 
norms 
are Archimedean 
val- 
uated 
fields. 
For any PRIME p, the p-ADIC NUMBERS 
Q, 
with 
the p-adic 
valuation 
I . lP is a non-Archimedean 
valuated 
field. 
If K is any FIELD, we can define 
the trivial 
valuation 
on K by 1x1 = 
1 for all x # 0 and 
101 = 0, which 
is 
a non-Archimedean 
valuation. 
If K is a FINITE 
FIELD, 
then the only possible 
valuation 
over K is the trivial 
one. 
It can be shown that 
any valuation 
on Q is equivalent 
The 
equivalence 
of any nontrivial 
valuation 
of Q to ei- 
ther 
the usual 
ABSOLUTE 
VALUE 
or to a p-ADIC NUM- 
BER absolute 
value 
was proved 
by 
Ostrowski 
(1935). 
Equivalent 
valuations 
give 
rise to the 
same 
topology. 
Conversely, 
if two valuations 
have 
the 
same 
topology, 
then 
they 
are equivalent. 
A stronger 
result 
is the fol- 
lowing: 
Let 
I 9 11, 1 l 12, . . . , I . jk be valuations 
over Kc 
which 
are pairwise 
inequivalent 
and let al, 
~2, . . . , arc 
be elements 
of K. 
Then 
there 
exists an infinite 
sequence 
(Xl, 
x2, 
“’ 
) of elements 
of K such that 
lim 
xn = al 
72300 
w.r.t. 
1-11 
(2) 
lim 
zn =a~, 
n-boo w.r.t. I-12 
(3) 
etc. 
This 
says that 
inequivalent 
valuations 
are, in some 
sense, completely 
independent 
of each other. 
For exam- 
ple, consider 
the rationals 
Q with 
the 3-adic 
and 5-adic 
valuations 
I . 13 and 
I l 1 5, and consider 
the sequence 
of 
numbers 
given 
by 
43 - 5” + 92 * 3n 
x:12 = 
3n +5n 
’ 
Then 
xn + 
43 as n + 
00 with 
respect 
to I 
l IS, but 
xn + 
92 as n + 
00 with 
respect 
to 1 . 15, illustrating 
that 
a sequence 
of numbers 
can tend 
to two different 
limits 
under 
two different 
valuations. 
(4 
A discrete 
valuation 
is a valuation 
for which the VALUA- 
TION GROUP is a discrete 
subset 
of the REAL 
NUMBERS 
R. Equivalently, 
a valuation 
(on a FIELD 
K) 
is discrete 
if there 
exists 
a REAL 
NUMBER 
e > 0 such that 
1x1 f (1 - E, 1 + E) * 
1x1 = 1 for all 2 E K. 
(5) 
The 
p-adic 
valuation 
on Q is discrete, 
but 
the ordinary 
absolute 
valuation 
is not. 
If I . I is a valuation 
on K, 
then 
it induces 
a metric 
4x, Y> = lx - PI 
(6) 
on K, 
which 
in turn 
induces 
a TOPOLOGY 
on K. 
If 
I . I satisfies 
(4b) th en the metric 
is an ULTRAMETRIC. 
We say that 
(K, I . I) is a complete 
valuated 
field 
if the 
METRIC SPACE is complete.

To estimate 
the 
population

from 
a sample 
of IV elements 
with 
a priori 
unknown 
MEAN 
(i.e., 
the 
MEAN 
is estimated 
from 
the sample 
itself), 
we need an 

1898 
Variance 
UNBIASED 
ESTIMATOR 
for 0. 
This 
is given 
by the 
k- 
STATISTIC kz, where 
N

(17) 
i=l 
since this 
makes 
the sample 
variance 
an UNBIASED 
ES- 
TIMATOR 
for the population 
variance. 
When 
computing 
numerically, 
the MEAN must 
be com- 
puted 
before 
s2 can be determined. 
This 
requires 
stor- 
ing the set of sample 
values. 
It is possible 
to calculate 
st2 using 
a recursion 
relationship 
involving 
only the last 
sample 
as follows. 
Here, 
use pj 
to denote 
p calculated 
from 
the first j samples 
(not 
the jth

The A-variation

in which 
the varied 
path 
over which 
an integral 
is evaluated 
may end at different 
times 
than 
the correct 
path, 
and there 
may 
be variation

at the endpoints. 
The 
S-variation 
is a variation 
in which 
the varied 
path 
in configuration 
space terminates 
at the endpoints 
rep- 
resenting 
the system 
configuration 
at the same time 
tl 
and tz as the correct 
path; 
i.e., the varied 
path 
always 
returns 
to the same endpoints 
in configuration 
space, so

= 0.

Vassiliev 
Polynomial 
Vassiliev 
(1990) 
introduced 
a radically 
new way of look- 
ing at KNOTS by considering 
a multidimensional 
space 
in which 
each point 
represents 
a possible 
3-D knot 
con- 
figuration. 
If two KNOTS 
are equivalent, 
a path 
then 
exists 
in this 
space from 
one to the other. 
The 
paths 
can be associated 
with 
polynomial 
invariants. 
Birman 
and 
Lin 
(1993) 
subsequently 
found 
a way to 
translate 
this 
scheme 
into 
a set of rules 
and list of po- 
tential 
starting 
points, 
which makes 
analysis 
of Vassiliev 
polynomials 
much 
simpler. 
Bar-Natan 
(1995) 
and Bir- 
man 
and Lin 
(1993) 
proved 
that 
JONES POLYNOMIALS 
and 
several 
related 
expressions 
are directly 
connected 
(Peterson 
1992). 
In fact, 
substituting 
the POWER se- 
ries for e5 as the variable 
in the JONES ,POLYNOMIAL 
yields 
a POWER SERIES whose COEFFICIENTS are Vas- 
siliev 
polynomials 
(Birman 
and 
Lin 
1993). 
Bar-Natan 
(1995) 
also discovered 
a link 
with 
Feynman 
diagrams 
(Peterson 
1992).

Vault 
Let 
a vault 
consist 
of two equal half-CYLINDERS 
of 
length 
and 
diameter 
2a 
which 
intersect 
at 
RIGHT 
ANGLES so that 
the 
lines 
of their 
intersections 
(the 
“groins”) 
terminate 
in 
the 
VERTICES of a SQUARE. 
Then 
the SURFACE AREA of the vault 
is given 
by 
A = 4(7r - 2)a2.

Vector 
A vector 
is a set of numbers 
Ao, . . . , A, that 
transform 
as 
Ai = aijAj. 
(1) 
This 
makes 
a vector 
a TENSOR of RANK 1. Vectors 
are invariant 
under 
TRANSLATION, and they reverse sign 
upon 
inversion. 
A vector 
is uniquely 
specified 
by giving 
its DIVERGENCE 
and 
CURL 
within 
a region 
and 
its 
normal 
component 
over 
the 
boundary, 
a result 
known 
as HELMHOLTZ'S 
THEOREM (A&en 
1985, 
p. 79). 
A vector 
from 
a point 
A to a point 
B is denoted 
X8, 
and a vector 
w may 
be 
denoted 
5, or more 
commonly, 
v. 
A vector 
with 
unit 
length 
is called 
a UNIT VECTOR and 
is denoted 
with 
a HAT. 
An 
arbitrary 
vector 
may 
be 
converted 
to a UNIT VECTOR by dividing 
by its NORM, 
i.e., 
V 
zr=----.

The choice of generating 
function 
is determined 
by the 
symmetry 
of the 
scalar 
equation, 
i.e., 
it is chosen 
to solve 
the 
desired 
scalar 
differential 
equation. 
If M 
is taken 
as 
M 
= V x (r+), 
(11) 
where 
r is the 
radius 
vector, 
then 
M 
is a solution 
to 
the vector 
wave equation 
in spherical 
coordinates. 
If we 
want vector 
solutions 
which 
are tangential 
to the radius 
vector, 
Mm r = r 9 (V+ 
x c) = (V$J)(C 
x r) = 0, 
(12) 
so 
cxr=o 
(13) 
and we may take 
c=r

Volume 
The 
volume 
of a solid 
body 
is the amount 
of “space” 
it 
occupies. 
Volume 
has units 
of LENGTH cubed 
(i.e., cm3, 
m3 , in3, etc.) 
For example, 
the volume 
of a box (RECT- 
ANGULAR PARALLELEPIPED) of LENGTH 
L, WIDTH w, 
and HEIGHT H is given 
by 
V=LxWxH. 
volume 
of a SURFACE OF REVOLUTION 
is particularly 
simple 
to compute 
due to its symmetry. 
The 
following 
table 
gives 
volumes 
for some 
common 
SURFACES. Here 
T denotes 
the RADIUS, h the height, 
A 
the base AREA, and s the SLANT HEIGHT (Beyer 
1987).

For instance, 
the SURFACE OF

around 
the x-axis

Waring’s 
Prime 
Conjecture 
Every 
ODD INTEGER is a PRIME or the 
sum 
of three 
PRIMES. 
Wang’s 
Conjecture 
Wang’s 
conjecture 
states 
that 
if a set of tiles 
can tile 
the plane, 
then 
they 
can always 
be arranged 
to do so 
periodically 
(Wang 
1961). 
The 
CONJECTURE was re- 
futed 
when Berger 
(1966) 
showed 
that 
an aperiodic 
set 
of tiles existed. 
Berger 
used 20,426 tiles, 
but the number 
has subsequently 
been greatly 
reduced. 
see also TILING 
Waring’s 
Problem 
Waring 
proposed 
a 
generalization 
of 
LAGRANGE'S 
FOUR-SQUARE THEOREM, stating 
that 
every 
RATIO- 
NAL INTEGER is the sum of a fixed 
number 
g(n) 
of nth 
POWERS of INTEGERS, where 
n is any 
given 
POSITIVE 
INTEGER and 
g(n) 
depends 
only 
on n. 
Waring 
origi- 
nally 
speculated 
that 
g(2) = 4, g(3) = 9, and g(4) = 19. 
In 1909, Hilbert 
proved 
the general 
conjecture 
using 
an 
identity 
in 25fold 
multiple 
integrals 
(Rademacher 
and 
Toeplite 
1957, pp. 52-61).

4 may

except 
for numbers 
of the form 
4n (8JE + 7) (as proved 
by Legendre).

twentieth 
century,

proved 
that 
g(3) = 9. Hilbert,

5 21, and 
this 
was sub- 
sequently 
reduced 
to g(4) 
= 
19 by Balasubramanian

(1986).

proved 
(using

that 
g(5) 
< 53, and 
this 
was improved

47, 45, 41, 39, 38, anb finally 
g(5) 
< 37 by Wieferich.

proof.

Waring’s 
Problem 
Waring’s 
Problem 
If the DIOPHANTINE 
(i.e., 
72 is restricted 
to being 
an 
INTEGER) 
inequality 
is true, 
then 
g(n) 
= 2” -I- 
(3 
This 
was given 
as a lower bound 
by Euler, 
and has been 
verified 
to be correct 
for 6 2 n < 200,000. 
Since 
1957, 
it has been 
known 
that 
at most 
a FINITE 
number 
of k 
exceed Euler’s 
lower bound. 
There 
is also a related 
problem 
of finding 
the least IN- 
TEGER n such that 
every P~SITWE INTEGER 
beyond 
a 
certain 
point 
(i.e., 
all but 
a FINITE number) 
is the SUM 
of G(n) nth POWERS. From 
1920-1928, 
Hardy 
and Lit- 
tlewood 
showed that 
G(n) 
2 (n- 
2)2+l+5 
(4) 
and conjectured 
that 
G(k) < 
2k + 1 
for IC not a power 
of 2 
4k 
for k a power 
of 2.

The 
best currently 
known 
bound 
is 
G(k)

(1936)

Vino- 
gradov’s 
results 
to obtain 
GJn) 
2 6nlnn+ 
[4+3ln 
(3+ 
i)] 
n+3. 
(7) 
It 
has long 
been 
known 
that 
G(2) 
= 4. 
Dickson 
and 
Landau 
proved 
that 
the only 
INTEGERS requiring 
nine 
CUBES are 
23 and 
239, 
thus 
establishing 
G(3) 
< 
8. 
Wieferich 
proved 
that 
only 
15 INTEGERS require 
eight 
CUBES: 
15, 22, 50, 
114, 
167, 
175, 
186, 
212, 
213, 
238, 
303, 364, 420, 428, and 454, establishing 
G(3) 
< 7. The 
largest 
number 
known 
requiring 
seven 
CUBES-is 
8042. 
In 1933, Hardy 
and Littlewood 
showed 
that 
G(4) 
< 19, 
but this was improved 
in 1936 to 16 or 17, and shown to 
be exactly 
16 by Davenport 
(1939b). 
Vaughan 
(1986) 
greatly 
improved 
on the method 
of Hardy 
and 
Little- 
wood, 
obtaining 
improved 
results 
for n > 
5. 
These 
results 
were then 
further 
improved 
by Briidern 
(1990), 
who gave G(5) 
5 18, and Wooley 
(1992), 
who gave G(n) 
for n = 6 to 20. 
Vaughan 
and 
Wooley 
(1993) 
showed 
G(8) 
< 42. 
- 
Let 
G+(n) 
denote 
the smallest 
number 
such that 
alrn~st 
all 
sufficiently 
large 
INTEGERS are the 
sum 
of G+(n) 
nth 
POWERS. 
Then 
G+(3) 
= 
4 (Davenport 
1939a), 
G+(4) 
= 15 (Hardy 
and Littlewood 
1925), 
P(8) 
= 32 
(Vaughan 
1986), 
and 
G’(6) 
= 64 (Wooley 
1992). 
If 
the negatives 
of POWERS are permitted 
in addition 
to 
the powers 
themselves, 
the largest 
number 
of nth 
POW- 
ERS needed 
to represent 
an aribtrary 
integer 
are denoted 
eg(n) 
and EG(n) 
(Wright 
1934, 
Hunter 
1941, 
Gardner 
1986). 
In general, 
these 
values 
are much 
harder 
to cal- 
culate 
than 
are g(n) 
and G(n). 
The 
following 
table 
gives g(n), 
G(n),

can 
be solved 
using 
the 
so-called

a FOURIER

method, 
or SEPARATION

d’Alembert

expanded 
the method 
in 1748.

To find the motion

The

(57) 
We now apply 
the boundary 
conditions 
to (56) and (57), 
The conditions 
~(0, y, t) = 0 and x(x, 0, t) = 0 mean 
that 
E=O 
G=O. 
(58) 
Similarly, 
the conditions 
z(L,, 
y, t) = 0 and x(x, L,, t) = 
0 give sin(k,L,)

= 0, so L,k,

We therefore

The

for a membrane 
shaped 
as a 
RIGHT IS~SCELES TRIANGLE 
of length 
c on a side and 
with 
the sides oriented 
along 
the POSITIVE

where 
WP9

and p, q INTEGERS with 
p 
> 4. 
This 
solution 
can be 
obtained 
by subtracting 
two wave solutions 
for a square 
membrane 
with 
the indices 
reversed. 
Since 
points 
on 
the diagonal 
which 
are equidistant 
from 
the center 
must 
have the same 
wave equation 
solution 
(by symmetry), 
this 
procedure 
gives 
a wavefunction 
which 
will 
vanish 
along 
the diagonal 
as long 
as p and q are both EVEN 
or 
ODD. 
We must 
further 
restrict 
the modes 
since those 
with 
p < q give wavefunctions 
which 
are just 
the NEG- 
ATIVE

Wavelet 
Wavelets 
are a class of a functions 
used 
to localize 
a 
given 
function 
in both 
space and 
scaling. 
A family 
of 
wavelets 
can be constructed 
from 
a function 
$J(x), some- 
times 
known 
as a “mother 
wavelet,” 
which is confined 
in 
a finite 
interval. 
“Daughter 
wavelets” 
@“lb(x) 
are then 
formed 
by translation 
(b) and contraction 
(a). Wavelets 
are especially 
useful 
for compressing 
image 
data, 
since a 
WAVELET TRANSFORM has properties 
which are in some 
ways superior 
to a conventional 
FOURIER TRANSFORM. 
An individual 
wavelet 
can be defined 
by

The

which, 
unlike 
the JACOBI 
ELLIPTIC

have a 
second-order

function 
p(z)

p’(z) 
for invariants 
(defined 
below) 
of g2 =

The 
Weierstrafi 
elliptic 
function 
is analytic 
at the ori- 
gin and therefore 
at all points 
congruent 
to the origin. 
There 
are no other 
places 
where 
a singularity 
can oc- 
cur, so this function 
is an ELLIPTIC 
FUNCTION 
with 
no 
SINGULARITIES. 
By LIOUVILLE'S 
ELLIPTIC 
FUNCTION 
THEOREM, 
it is therefore 
a constant.

Theorem 
Given 
a succession 
of nonsingular 
points 
which 
are on a 
nonhyperelliptic 
curve of GENUS 
p, but 
are not a group 
of the canonical 
series, the number 
of groups 
of the first 
k which 
cannot 
constitute 
the 
group 
of simple 
POLES 
of a RATIONAL 
FUNCTION 
is p. If points 
next 
to each 
other 
are taken, 
then 
the 
theorem 
becomes: 
Given 
a 
nonsingular 
point 
of a nonhyperelliptic 
curve of GENUS 
p, then 
the orders 
which 
it cannot 
possess as the single 
pole of a RATION

Weighings 
n weighings 
are SUFFICIENT to find 
a bad COIN among 
(3 n - 1)/2 
COINS. 
vos Savant 
(1993) 
gives an algorithm 
for finding 
a bad ball 
among 
12 balls 
in three 
weighings 
(which, 
in addition, 
determines 
if the bad ball 
is heavier 
or lighter 
than 
the other 
11).

Well- Defined 
W.heel 
1937 
Well-Defined 
An expression 
is called 
well-defined 
(or UNAMBIGUOUS) 
if its 
definition 
assigns 
it 
a unique 
interpretation 
or 
value. 
Otherwise, 
the expression 
is said to not be well 
defined 
or to be AMBIGUOUS. 
For example, 
the expression 
abc (the 
PRODUCT) 
is well- 
defined 
if a, b, and c are integers. 
Because 
integers 
are 
ASSOCIATIVE, 
abc has the same 
value 
whether 
it is in- 
terpreted 
to mean 
(ab)c or a@). 
However, 
if a, b, and 
c are MATRICES 
or CAYLEY 
NUMBERS, 
then 
the expres- 
sion abc is not well-defined, 
since 
MATRICES 
and 
CAY- 
LEY NUMBER 
are not, 
in general, 
ASSOCIATIVE, 
so that 
the two interpretations 
(ab)c and a(k) 
can be different. 
Sometimes, 
ambiguities 
are implicitly 
resolved 
by no- 
tational 
convention. 
For example, 
the conventional 
in- 
terpretation 
of a A b A c = abc is acbcJ, never 
(ab)c, 
so 
that 
the expression 
a A b /\ c is well-defined 
even though 
exponentiation 
is nonassociative. 
Well-Ordered 
Set 
A SET having 
the property 
that 
every nonempty 
SUBSET 
has a least member.

Whitney 
Sum 
An operation 
that 
takes 
two VECTOR 
BUNDLES 
over 
a 
fixed SPACE and produces 
anew 
VECTOR 
BUNDLE~~~~ 
the same 
SPACE. 
If El 
and E2 are VECTOR 
BUNDLES 
over B, then 
the Whitney 
sum El @ Ez is the VECTOR 
BUNDLE 
over B such that 
each FIBER 
over B is naturally 
the direct 
sum of the El 
and Ez FIBERS 
over B. 
The 
Whitney 
sum is therefore 
the FIBER 
for FIBER 
di- 
rect sum of the two BUNDLES 
El 
and Ez. 
An easy for- 
mal 
definition 
of the Whitney 
sum 
is that 
El 
@ Ez is 
the pull-back 
BUNDLE 
of the diagonal 
map 
from

Whole 
Number 
One of the numbers

l . . (Sloane’s 
A000027), 
also 
calledthe 
COUNTING 
NUMBERS 
or NATURAL 
NUMBERS. 
0 is sometimes 
included 
in the list of “whole” 
numbers 
(Bourbaki 
1968, Halmos 
1974), 
but there seems to be no 
general 
agreement. 
Some 
authors 
also interpret 
“whole 
number” 
to mean 
“a number 
having 
FRACTIONAL 
PART 
of zero,” 
making 
the whole 
numbers 
equivalent 
to the 
integers. 
Due to lack of standard 
terminology, 
the following 
terms 
are recommended 
in preference 
to 
“COUNTING

Theorem 
Note 
the similarity 
of this 
expression 
of FERMAT’S 
LITTLE 
THEOREM 
to the special 
case 
2 p-1 
E 1 (mod 
p) 
7 
which 
holds 
for all ODD PRIMES. 
However, 
the 
only 
Wieferich 
primes 
less than 
4 x 1012 are p = 1093 and 
3511 (Lehmer 
1981, Crandalll986, 
Crandall 
et al. 1997). 
Interestingly, 
one less than 
these 
numbers 
have sugges- 
tive periodic 
BINARY 
representations 
1092 = 100010001002 
3510 
= 110110110110~. 
A PRIME 
factor 
p ofa MERSENNE NUMBERI& 
=2*-l 
is a Wieferich 
prime 
IFF p2 12g - 1. Therefore, 
MERSENNE 
PRIMES are not Wieferich 
primes. 
Ifthe 
first case of FERMAT'S LAST THEOREM is false for 
exponent 
p, then p must 
be a Wieferich 
prime 
(Wieferich 
1909). 
If p)2”fl 
with 
p and n RELATIVELY PRIME, then 
p is a Wieferich 
prime 
IFF p2 
also divides 
2” 5 1. The 
CONJECTURE that 
there 
are no three POWERFUL NUM- 
BERS implies 
that 
there 
are infinitely 
many 
Wieferich 
primes 
(Granville 
1986, 
Vardi 
1991). 
In 
addition, 
the 
ABC CONJECTURE implies 
that 
there 
are at least 
C lnz 
Wieferich 
primes 
< II: for some 
constant

Theorem 
A theorem 
of fundamental

which 
provides 
both 
(1) 
an explicit 
form 
for the dependence 
of all matrix

of irreducible 
tensors 
on the projection 
quantum 
numbers 
and (2) a formal 
expression 
of the conservation 
laws of angular 
momentum 
(Rose 
1995). 
The 
theorem 
states 
that 
the

Test 
A nonparametric

to 
the 
PAIRED 
t-TEST 
which is similar 
to the FISHER SIGN TEST. This 
test as- 
sumes that 
there 
is information 
in the magnitudes 
of the 
differences 
between 
paired 
observations, 
as well as the 
signs. 
Take the paired 
observations, 
calculate 
the differ- 
ences, and rank 
them 
from 
smallest 
to largest 
by ABSO- 
LUTE VALUE. Add 
all the ranks 
associated 
with 
POSI- 
TIVE differences, 
giving 
the T+ statistic. 
Finally, 
the P- 
VALUE 
associated 
with this statistic 
is found 
from an ap- 
propriate 
table. 
The

Zeilberger 
Pair 
A pair 
of CLOSED FORM 
functions 
(F, G) is said to be 
a Wilf-Zeilberger 
pair 
if 
F(n 
+ 1, k) - F(n, 
k) = G(n, 
k + 1) - G(n, 
k). 
(1) 
The 
Wilf-Zeilberger 
formalism 
provides 
succinct 
proofs 
of known 
identities 
and allows 
new identities 
to be dis- 
covered 
whenever 
it 
succeeds 
in finding 
a proof 
cer- 
tificate 
for a known 
identity. 
However, 
if the starting 
point 
is an unknown 
hypergeometric 
sum, 
then the Wilf- 
Zeilberger 
method 
cannot 
discover 
a closed 
form 
solu- 
tion, 
while ZEILBERGER'S ALGORITHM can. 
Wilf-Zeilberger 
pairs 
are very useful 
in proving 
HYPER- 
GEOMETRIC IDENTITIES of the form 
x 
t(n, k) = rhs(n) 
k

for which the SUMMAND t(n, Ic) vanishes 
for all k outside 
some finite 
interval.

(average

A system

is MODE-LOCKED, 
whereas 
a system

is QUASIPERIODIC. 
Note 
that 
since the 
RATIONALS 
are 
a set of zero MEASURE 
on any finite 
interval, 
almost 
all

be irrational,

Witch

I 
A curve studied 
and named 
“versiera” 
(Italian 
for “she- 
devil” 
or “witch”) 
by Maria 
Agnesi 
in 1748 in her book 
Istituzioni 
Analifiche 
(MacTutor 
Archive). 
It 
is also 
known 
as CUBIQUE 
D’AGNESI 
or AGN~SIENNE. 
Some 
suggest 
that 
Agnesi 
confused 
an old Italian 
word mean- 
ing 
“free to move” 
with 
another 
meaning 
“witch.” 
The 
curve 
had 
been 
studied 
earlier 
by Fermat 
and 
Guido 
Grandi 
in 1703. 
It is the curve obtained 
by drawing 
a line from the origin 
through 
the CIRCLE 
of radius 
2a (OB), 
then picking 
the 
point 
with 
the y coordinate 
of the intersection 
with the 
circle 
and 
the 
x coordinate 
of the 
intersection 
of the 
extension 
of line 
OB 
with 
the line 
y = 2~. 
The 
curve 

1950 
Witness 
Wolstenholme’s

A detailed 
on-line 
essay by S. Finch 
was the start- 
ing point 
for this entry. 
A finite 
sequence 
of n letters 
from 
some 
ALPHABET 
is 
said to be an n-ary 
word. 
A “square” 
word consists 
of 
two identical 
subwords 
(for example, 
UC&~). 
A square- 
free word contains 
no square 
words as subwords 
(for ex- 
ample, 
abcacbabcb). 
The 
only 
squarefree 
binary 
words 
are a, b, ab, bu, uba, and 
hub. 
However, 
there 
are ar- 
bitrarily 
long 
ternary 
squarefree 
words. 
The 
number 
of 
ternary 
squarefree 
words of length 
n is bounded 
by 
6 
l 1.032" 
< s(n) 
< 6 l 1.379”

1983).

(2)

Binary 
cube- 
free words satisfy 
2. 1.080" 
< c(n) < 2. 1.522”. 
- 
- 
(3) 
A word is said to be overlapfree 
if it has no subwords 
of 
the form zyzyz. 
A squarefree 
word is overlapfree, 
and an 
Worm 
1951 
overlapfree 
word is cubefree. 
The number 
t(n) 
of binary 
overlapfree 
words of length 
n satisfies

Zeno’s 
Paradoxes 
A set of four PARADOXES dealing 
with 
counterintuitive 
aspects 
of continuous 
space and time. 
. 
Achilles 
and 
the 
tortoise 
paradox: 
A fleet-of-foot 
Achilles 
is unable 
to catch 
a plodding 
tortoise 
which 
has been 
given 
a head 
start, 
since during 
the time 
it takes 
Achilles 
to catch 
up to a given 
position, 
the 
tortoise 
has moved 
forward 
some distance. 
But 
this 
is obviously 
fallacious 
since Achilles 
will 
clearly 
pass 
the tortoise! 
The resolution 
is similar 
to that 
of the 
dichotomy 
paradox. 
Arrow 
paradox: 
An arrow 
in flight 
has an instanta- 
neous 
position 
at a given 
instant 
of time. 
At that 
instant, 
however, 
it is indistinguishable 
from 
a mo- 
tionless 
arrow 
in the 
same 
position, 
so how is the 
motion 
of the arrow perceived? 
4. Stade 
paradox: 
A paradox 
arising 
from 
the assump- 
tion 
that 
space and 
time 
can be divided 
only 
by a 
definite 
amount. 
Dichotomy 
paradox: 
Before 
an object 
can travel 
a 
given 
distance 
d, it must 
travel 
a distance 
d/Z. 
In 
order to travel 
d/2, 
it must 
travel 
d/4, 
etc. Since this 
sequence 
goes on forever, 
it therefore 
appears 
that 
the distance 
d cannot 
be traveled. 
The 
resolution 
of 
the paradox 
awaited 
CALCULUS 
and 
the proof 
that 
infinite 
GEOMETRIC 
SERIES such as cz,( 
I/2)” 
= I 
can converge, 
so that 
the infinite 
number 
of “half- 
steps” 
needed 
is balanced 
by the increasingly 
short 
amount 
of time 
needed 
to traverse 
the distances.

The INTEGER 
denoted 
0 which, 
when used as a counting 
number, 
means 
that 
no objects 
are present. 
It is the only 
INTEGER 
(and, 
in fact, the only 
REAL 
NUMBER) 
which 
is neither 
NEGATIVE 
nor POSITIVE. 
A number 
which 
is 
not zero is said to be NONZERO. 
Because 
the number 
of PERMUTATIONS 
of 0 elements 
is 
1, O! (zero FACTORIAL) 
is often 
defined 
as 1. This 
def- 
inition 
is useful 
in expressing 
many 
mathematical 
iden-

in simple 
form. 
A number 
other 
than 
0 taken 
to 
the POWER

to be 1. 0’ is undefined,

Zipf’s 
Law 
In the English 
language, 
the probability 
of encountering 
the rth 
most 
common 
word 
is given 
roughly 
by P(r) 
= 
0.1/r 
for T up to 1000 or so. The law breaks 
down for less 
frequent 
words, 
since 
the 
HARMONIC 
SERIES 
diverges. 
Pierce’s 
(1980, 
p. 87) statement 
that 
c 
P(r) 
> 1 for 
T = 8727 is incorrect. 
Goetz 
states 
the law as follows: 
The frequency 
of a word 
is inversely 
proportional 
to its 
RANK 
T such that 
PC ) 
1 
T z r ln(L78R) 
’ 
where R is the number 
of different 
words.
