Introduction
Z
oho — the free suite of online productivity applications — offers a 
fantastic set of resources for anyone with Internet access. You can use 
a state-of-the-art word processor, spreadsheet, database system, or any of 
many other applications that Zoho offers. Those applications are as powerful 
as any you’ll find that you install on your computer.
And the best part is that Zoho is free (with the exception of some levels of 
advanced business computing). As a result, Zoho has taken off in a big way, 
gaining millions of users. Zoho is part of the cloud computing initiative, where 
applications and your data stay online. You can access those applications 
from anywhere there’s an Internet connection, and you don’t have to worry 
about installing new versions.
About This Book
This book is your guide to Zoho. As great as Zoho is on software, it’s not 
quite so great on documentation.
Users will find the Zoho help files very spotty. Some applications have no 
help files at all, some only have frequently asked questions (FAQ) lists, and 
others rely on interactive forums.
That’s where this book comes in. Here you find the documentation that’s 
missing from Zoho. There’s plenty of stuff here that you won’t find 
anywhere else.
Foolish Assumptions
You won’t need anything besides a browser and an Internet connection to 
use this book. Zoho will do the rest as far as the technical aspect goes.
On the other hand, this book assumes that you have a few basic skills: for 
example, the basics of working with a word processor. You don’t have to be 
an expert at any of the applications in this book, but when it comes to basic 
skills that most people have already been exposed to — such as clicking the 
B icon to make text bold — I don’t spend a lot of time on such details because 
nearly everyone already knows them.

2
Zoho For Dummies 
In other words, this book is intended to bring you up to speed on Zoho with-
out wasting a lot of time on basic office suite skills.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is organized into parts, with each part covering some area of Zoho. 
Here’s what you find in this book.
Part I: Working with Documents
This part gets you going with Zoho, explaining how to create documents in 
depth. Here’s what’s in this part:
 
✓ Zoho Writer is Zoho’s word processor, and it’s nearly as powerful as 
any you’ll find anywhere.
 
✓ Zoho Show is the app to use to create exciting slide shows that you can 
use when giving presentations.
 
✓ Zoho Notebook is Zoho’s scrapbook, letting you clip Web pages, images, 
text, audio, video, and more from the Internet.
Part II: Scheduling and Communicating
In this part, you get a guided tour of Zoho’s scheduling and communicating 
applications. Here’s what’s in this part:
 
✓ Zoho Planner, just like any other organizer, allows you to schedule your 
life. You can store addresses, to-do lists, appointments, and more.
 
✓ Zoho Mail is Zoho’s deluxe e-mail system, and it gives you all the fea-
tures you’d expect.
Part III: Managing Data
This part is for you if you like to crunch data. Here’s what you find:
 
✓ Zoho Sheet is the Zoho spreadsheet application. Not only can you use 
it to do all you can on other spreadsheet applications, but you can also 
use formulas and functions to make super-powerful spreadsheets.

3
 Introduction
 
✓ Zoho Reports is the database system. Store your data in this applica-
tion and view it many different ways, or use Structured Query Language 
(SQL) to work with that data.
Part IV: Using Zoho for Your Business
Zoho contains a number of applications designed for businesses, and here’s

Icons Used in This Book
 
The Tip icon marks tips and shortcuts that you can use to make everything 
you’re doing with Zoho easier.
 
Remember icons mark the information that’s especially important to know. To 
siphon off the most important information in each chapter, just skim through 
these icons.
 
The Warning icon tells you to watch out! It marks important information that

Zoho For Dummies 
Where to Go from Here
Zoho is huge, and you don’t need to start at any particular point. The same is 
true of this book: You can jump in anywhere you want. So pick a chapter and 
dive in! (Chapter 1 covers how to create your Zoho username and password, 
so that may be a good place to start.)

Part I
Working with 
Documents

In this part . . .
T
his part gets you started with Zoho, covering the most 
essential applications for creating your own documents.
Zoho Writer is the Zoho suite word processor — a super-
popular application that offers plenty of power. 
Zoho Show enables you to create slide show presenta-
tions. You can add graphics, text, images, and more to 
your presentations and share them with an audience or 
online. 
Zoho Notebook is the scrapbook of the Zoho suite. 
Notebook is a handy app with which you can collect just 
about anything you find online: text, images, video, audio, 
and even whole Web pages.

Chapter 1
Getting Started with Zoho
In This Chapter
▶ The Zoho advantage: Why it’s right for so many people
▶ Signing up for Zoho
▶ Finding out about the Zoho apps covered in this book
W
elcome to Zoho, your online productivity and collaboration suite of 
applications. Zoho is different from a traditional suite of productiv-
ity apps in that it works online (although you can work with some Zoho apps 
offline and synchronize them when you’re back online, as you’ll see). All the 
applications are available at www.zoho.com; all you have to do is to sign up 
with Zoho.
Zoho offers all the applications you would expect in a full productivity 
suite and more. It’s got all the applications you see in application suites 
costing hundreds of dollars, but Zoho is free (although some applications 
charge you to go beyond the basic levels). Zoho gives you word processing, 
spreadsheets, mail, customer relations management, database, invoicing, 
presentation applications — and that’s just the beginning. It’s fair to say 
that Zoho has an application matching just about every popular type of 
application out there.
Zoho is all about cloud computing — that is, storing your data online for use 
with online applications. No longer do you need to be tied to older software 
that hasn’t been updated on your computer. In fact, you don’t even have to 
run the application on your computer at all — it runs in the “cloud.” And that 
makes it easy to, among other things, share your data with co-workers online.
As you will see throughout this book, Zoho applications have a lot to offer. 
You can use them from anywhere with an Internet connection, share your 
data with others, and collaborate interactively. Best of all, you don’t have to 
worry about buying new versions of Zoho as they come out because they’re 
automatically updated online.

8
Part I: Working with Documents 
In this chapter, you take care of the first order of business: signing up for a 
Zoho account. Once you have a Zoho account, you’re ready to start working 
with the applications. This chapter gives you a rundown of the Zoho applica-
tions covered in this book, explains what you can do with them, and points 
you to the chapters where you can find out more about them.
Signing Up for Zoho
To access all the Zoho applications, sign up for Zoho. Start at www.zoho.com, 
as you see in Figure 1-1.

7. Enter the visual code you see into the text box just above the code.
 
 If you get the visual code incorrect, Zoho will give you more chances by 
displaying another code (without erasing the information you already 
entered).
 
8. Select the check box for I Agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy 
Policy.
 
 If you want to read the Zoho terms of service, click the Terms of Service 
and the Privacy Policy links.

Figure 1-4:

From this point, click the links you see in Figure 1-4 to start any Zoho 
application: Writer, Sheet, Show, and so on.

12
Part I: Working with Documents 
However, after you have your username and password, I recommend that 
you go to each individual application’s page — http://writer.zoho.com 
for Writer, or http://sheet.zoho.com for Sheet, for example — to start an 
application.
 
Here’s why signing in directly from the app home page is better than going to 
the Accounts page and clicking an application’s link. Zoho sometimes adds a 
navigation bar of links at the left of the application’s page from which you can 
switch to other applications. That navigation bar takes up space, and usually 
pushes menus and buttons off the screen. Not optimal.
So, when you sign in at an application’s home page, Zoho still asks for 
your username and password, but after you sign in, the application starts 
immediately.
Taking a Look at the Zoho Apps 
Covered in This Book
After you become an official Zoho user, take a look at what’s available in 
Zoho. Zoho offers a ton of apps, but, unfortunately, I don’t have space to 
cover them all here. Here are the ones I do talk about in this book.
Writer: Your word processor
Writer is the Zoho word processor extraordinaire, offering nearly all that 
word processors that cost hundreds of dollars have to offer. You can see 
Writer at work in Figure 1-5.
To start Writer, navigate to http://writer.zoho.com, enter your user-
name and password (see the first part of this chapter for how to open a Zoho 
account), and click the Sign In button. That’s all it takes.
With Writer, you can enter and format text, align page elements, insert 
images and hyperlinks, create tables, and work with templates. Additionally, 
you can use Writer to publish to the Web, share documents with others, and 
work offline. And as an organizational tool, you can add additional informa-
tion with tags.
Read all about Writer in Chapters 2 and 3.

Show: Your presentation manager
Show is your presentation manager, letting you create and show slides to 
your audience (much like Microsoft PowerPoint). You can see Zoho Show at 
work in Figure 1-6.

Part I: Working with Documents 
To start Show, navigate to http://show.zoho.com, enter your username 
and password, and click the Sign In button. With Show, you can create pre-
sentations by adding slides, using text and images, and adding shapes. You 
can also work with notes, share your presentations with others, and view 
presentations online.
Read all about Show in Chapter 4.
Notebook: Your online scrapbook
With Zoho Notebook, you can collect text, images, video, audio, and other 
items that you upload or that you clip from the Web. It’s a great scrapbook 
application that allows you to collect items from all over and store them in 
one place. You can see Zoho Notebook at work in Figure 1-7.
 
Figure 1-7: 
Zoho

To start Notebook, navigate to http://notebook.zoho.com, enter your 
username and password, and click the Sign In button. Zoho Notebook allows 
you to add all sorts of content (videos, text, images, and audio), add shapes 
and pages, use Web clipping, and share your notebook.
Read all about Notebook in Chapter 5.

 Chapter 1: Getting Started with Zoho
Planner: Your online organizer
Ever have a paper organizer? You know, one of those heavy collections of 
tabbed papers that pages keep falling out of? Now you can take your orga-
nizer online, with Zoho Planner. You can keep track of events, addresses, 
meetings — just about everything in your busy life. You can see Zoho Planner 
at work in Figure 1-8.
 
Figure 1-8:

username and password, and click the Sign In button. With Planner, you can 
create a to-do list, add and edit items in a list, add appointments, get remind-
ers, keep track of addresses, and share pages.
Read all about Planner in Chapter 6.
Mail: Your communication center
Many online application suites offer mail programs, and Zoho is no excep-
tion. You can send and receive mail, send and receive attachments, embed 
HTML in your mail, and more with Zoho Mail.
You can see Zoho Mail at work in Figure 1-9.

Sheet: Your spreadsheet
You’d expect a serious application suite to have a powerful spreadsheet pro-
gram, and Zoho does: Sheet.
Sheet is as feature rich as applications you could pay hundreds of dollars for, 
but it’s completely free. You can enter or import your data, sort or filter it, 
and apply functions and formulas, all with ease. You can see Sheet at work in 
Figure 1-10.
 
Figure 1-10: 
Zoho Sheet

 Chapter 1: Getting Started with Zoho
To start Sheet, navigate to http://sheet.zoho.com, enter your username 
and password, and click the Sign In button. Use Sheet to create, import, and 
format spreadsheets; enter and sort data; add and delete rows and columns; 
use formulas and functions; create pivot tables; export to other programs; 
handle external data; and share spreadsheets with others.
Read all about Sheet in Chapter 8.
Reports: Your database
Zoho even sports a database application: Zoho Reports. As strong of a data-
base system as Microsoft Access, Reports allows you to sort and filter your 
records, as well as execute full SQL (Structured Query Language) statements, 
just as you’d expect from a professional database application. You can see 
Zoho Reports in Figure 1-11.
 
Figure 1-11: 
Zoho 
Reports.
 
To start Reports, navigate to http://db.zoho.com, enter your username 
and password, and click the Sign In button. Use Zoho Reports to create a 
database from scratch or by importing, enter records, work with tables and 
edit their design, sort and filter records, execute SQL statements, choose 
from different views, and share your data online.
Read all about Reports in Chapter 9.

Part I: Working with Documents 
Projects: Your team scheduler
If you manage a team and want to keep on schedule with your projects, Zoho 
Projects offers a great solution. You can set up timelines, meetings, appoint-
ments, and tasks; assign tasks to people; and share everything interactively. 
You can see Zoho Projects at work in Figure 1-12.
 
Figure 1-12: 
Zoho

To start Projects, navigate to http://projects.zoho.com, enter your 
username and password, and click the Sign In button. Use Zoho Projects 
to work with the Projects dashboard; track time; create projects and mile-
stones; add users and tasks, assign tasks and roles to users, and manage 
users; use the built-in calendar and schedule meetings; work with, upload, 
and organize documents; tag data; use forums; and generate reports.
Read all about Projects in Chapter 10.
Invoice: Your billing application
When it comes to collecting what customers owe you, Zoho Invoice is right 
there with you. From creating invoices to sending them out, Invoice gets the 
job done. You can see Zoho Invoice at work in Figure 1-13.
To start Invoice, navigate to http://invoice.zoho.com, enter your user-
name and password, and click the Sign In button. Use Zoho Invoice to set 
your company profile, currency type, time zone, tax information, and logo; 
create an invoice; add and delete customers; and manage inventory.

CRM: Your customer relationship 
management system
This is the big one, the whopper of the bunch. Zoho CRM is the biggest of the 
Zoho applications, and you can sign up and pay for multiple levels. Or, you 
can opt for a free level.
CRM stands for customer relationship management, and with Zoho CRM, you 
can keep track of just about every marketing and sales task there is. This 
application mimics CRM applications that sell for thousands of dollars.
You can track leads, potential leads, customers, sales orders, purchase orders, 
inventory, and much more. You can see Zoho CRM at work in Figure 1-14.
To start CRM, navigate to http://crm.zoho.com, enter your username 
and password, and click the Sign In button. Use Zoho CRM to customize your 
CRM; create records, forecasts, profiles, and custom views; add users; track 
inventory, marketing trends, and sales by sales rep; manage users and cus-
tomers; and work with modules.

hen you think of a word processor, you probably think of a dedicated 
piece of software loaded on your laptop or desktop computer. You 
open the application; your computer grinds around for a while; the word pro-
cessor starts; and then you use the word processor to create, edit, save, and 
even spellcheck your documents. Word processors are indeed handy tools — 
as long as everyone’s on the same page, so to speak.
Zoho Writer is here to change the landscape of word processing apps. And 
that’s what this chapter is all about.
Signing In and Starting Zoho Writer
Time to see just how easy it is to work in Zoho Writer. To start, navigate your 
Web browser to http://writer.zoho.com to open the Zoho Writer home 
page. Enter your username and password. Then click the Sign In button, 
which takes you to Writer, as shown in Figure 2-1. (If you haven’t signed up 
for a Zoho account, see Chapter 1 for details.)

Figure 2-1:

My Docs pane
When you open Zoho Writer for the first time, you see its Welcome page, as 
shown in Figure 2-1. That Welcome page is actually a Writer document, and 
it’s already saved in your My Docs pane, as you can see in Figure 2-1. The 
Welcome document gives you an overview of some of the features that Writer 
offers, mentioning some standard items (such as bulleted lists and tables) 
and also what makes Writer different (such as sharing documents online).
Taking a Quick Tour of Zoho Writer
Take a look at Writer in Figure 2-1, replete with its many buttons and menus 
and links. Before jumping headfirst into Writer, though, take a moment to 
follow a guided tour of the Writer window so when I talk about the so-and-so 
toolbar or the such-and-such tab, you’ll know what I mean.
Document management
Start with the buttons you see at upper left in Figure 2-1. These buttons are 
the basics of document management, like in any word processor.

23
 Chapter 2: Zoho Writer: Getting It Down in Print
  
 
✓ New: Create a new document. Go figure.
 
✓ Import: Import documents in a variety of formats, including simple text.
 
✓ Delete: Guess.
Below these three buttons, you find a Search field. Enter the text you want in 
the Search field and then click the Go button.
General functions
The next group of buttons (under Welcome on the Document tab) handles 
some general Writer functions:
  
 
✓ Save: Saves your current document. If no name is associated with the 
document, Zoho Writer asks you to name it before saving it.
 
✓ Save As: Saves your current document, giving it the name you choose.
 
✓ Print: Prints the current document.
 
✓ Export: Exports the current document.
 
✓ Document properties: Displays a dialog box with statistics about your 
current document, such as the number of words and characters.
Toolbars
Writer has many toolbars that don’t appear until you need them. You can see 
a full toolbar by clicking one of the tabs shown in Figure 2-1 and described 
in Table 2-1. For example, when you click the Format tab, Writer displays the 

24

full Format toolbar, as shown in Figure 2-1. Or if you click the down arrow on 
a tab, you can see a menu of toolbar options.
Table 2-1 
Toolbar Tabs
Tab/Toolbar
Why You Can Do with It
Format
Format the text you’ve selected. For example, apply bold, italic, 
underline, and so on.
Insert
Insert images, spreadsheets, Web pages, and so on into your 
document.
Review
Review your document with features such as Spellcheck, 
Thesaurus, and Find and Replace.
Share
Share your document with options such as Share, Publish, and 
Publish to Web.
View
Change the document view: Normal View, Print Preview, and 
HTML View.
Page Setup
Change the page setup with such items as Header, Footer, and 
Page Layout.
Left pane
Now take a look at the pane on the left in Writer. This pane has a number of 
bars that, when clicked, expand. By default, as shown in Figure 2-1, the My 
Docs bar is clicked, and you can see the My Docs view, which lists your docu-
ments. Here’s an overview of the bars available to you in the left pane:
 
✓ My Docs lists your documents, and you can open a document just by 
double-clicking it.
 
✓ Shared Docs lists documents that people have invited you to share or 
take a look at. Read about sharing in Chapter 3.
 
✓ Tag Folders lists the tags in your documents.
 
✓ Templates lists the templates you can use as the basis of a document. 
Templates specify font size and style, line spacing, and so on. Templates 
can also contain boilerplate text, such as for an invoice form. Get the 
scoop on templates later in this chapter.
 
✓ Trash holds the documents you delete until you deliberately empty the 
Trash.

 Chapter 2: Zoho Writer: Getting It Down in Print
The Writer links
Next, check out the set of links at the top of Writer, above the writing space. 
Here’s what they do:
 
✓ Feeds: Click to see sharing information for documents shared with your 
collaborators. For example, if you’re sharing a document with someone 
else, you can see the history of all shared actions here.
 
✓ Switch To: Click to switch to another Zoho application, such as Notebook.
 
✓ Go Offline: Click to work offline with up to 25 of your documents. See 
Chapter 3 for more information on going offline.
 
✓ Settings: Click to customize Writer in various ways, such as arranging tabs.
 
✓ Help: Clicking this link won’t provide you with detailed help in the sense 
you might find it for other software. Instead, this provides access to a set 
of FAQs (frequently asked questions lists), forums, and blogs. Clicking the 
down arrow next to the Help link opens a menu with these items:
 
• FAQ: The Frequently Asked Questions list
 
• Zoho API: The application programming interface specification for 
developers
 
• Template Library: A set of good templates for you to use as the 
basis of your documents
 
• Zoho Writer Forums: Forums in which you can ask questions, and 
general users (and sometimes Zoho staff) will answer
 
• Zoho Blogs: A list of blogs from Zoho staff
 
• Keyboard Shortcuts: A list of keystroke shortcuts for common 
actions, such as saving a document
 
✓ Feedback: If you want to suggest something to Zoho, or send in a com-
pliment or complaint, just click this link.
 
✓ My Account: Click to access a page with information about your Zoho 
account.
 
✓ Sign Out: Click when you’re ready to exit Zoho. It’s recommended that 
you click this link each time you finish editing in Zoho Writer to log you 
out. This is a security measure: When you log out, you need to supply 
your username and password to log in again, which means that someone 
sitting down at your computer after you’ve left won’t be able to continue 
with your Zoho session without authorization.
 
Many of the preceding links are the same in other Zoho applications.

26
Part I: Working with Documents 
Document tabs
Underneath the links at the top of the Writer page is a set of document tabs 
you use to move between all the documents that you have open. In Figure 2-1, 
only one tab is available: the tab labeled Welcome, which corresponds to the 
Welcome document in Zoho Writer.
To close a tab, just click the X at right on the tab.
 
The button with the arrow to the left of the Welcome tab is the Maximize 
Editor button. Click it to make the editing space in Writer fill more of the 
screen, hiding unneeded bars. Screen space is at a premium in Web browsers, 
and there’s a lot of clutter in Zoho Writer you might be able to do without. If 
so, just click the Maximize Editor button to get more breathing space. The 
Maximize Editor button toggles to become the Minimize Editor button when 
the editor is maximized. To make the editor return to its original size, click the 
Minimize Editor button.
Now, however, it’s time to create your first document in Writer!
Creating, Saving, and 
Naming Documents
Creating a new document in Writer couldn’t be easier. Just click the New 
button (upper left). A new document named Untitled is created and opened, 
as you can see in Figure 2-2.
Note what happens: The new document is opened in its own tab — Untitled — 
as you can see in Figure 2-2. You can still access the Welcome page if you like; 
just click its tab.
And note that the new document, Untitled, appears in the left pane, as you 
can also see in Figure 2-2. The Welcome document is also visible in the left 
pane, as you can see in Figure 2-2. Clicking Welcome opens that document 
again.
The main action takes place in the editing space — that blank space just wait-
ing for your words that you see in Figure 2-2. To enter text into your new 
document, click the body of the blank document. A flashing text cursor — an 
upright bar, also called the insertion point — appears. That’s where the text 
you type will be inserted.

Your new document
Editing space
After your text is in place, save the new document and give it a name:
 
1. Click the Save button (the button with a diskette on it).
 
 A Save As dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 2-3, asking you for the 
name of the new document.
 
Figure 2-3: 
Name your 
new doc.
 
 
2. Enter the name of the new document in the text field and then 
click OK.
 
 For my example, I used Invitation, as you can see in Figure 2-3. Then in 
my new document, I entered text for an invitation to a birthday party.
 
 After you click OK, the document is saved (using the name you speci-
fied) and a pop-up box appears briefly at the bottom right telling you the 
document was saved and how many words are in it.

28
Part I: Working with Documents 
 
 After your document is given a name and saved, it gets its own tab. It 
also shows up in the left pane, as you see in Figure 2-4.
 
Figure 2-4: 
A saved 
document.
 
The saved document
 
 After you name a document, Zoho won’t ask you for its name when you 
click the Save link: It will just save the document.
 
When you save a document using Save As instead of Save, a new copy of the 
document is made and saved — and the tab for the original document still 
stays open. That way, you can save a copy of your document under a new 
name.
To save a document under a new name, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Save As button (the button with a diskette and pencil on it).
 
 A drop-down menu opens under the Save As button with two items in it.
 
2. Choose one of the following options:
 
• New Document: Choose the New Document menu item to make the 
dialog box from Figure 2-3 appear. Enter a name for the document, 
and then click OK.
 
• Template: Choosing the Template menu item allows you to save 
the document as a template. I talk about this in the upcoming sec-

Formatting Tips and Tricks in Writer
Many formatting commands and actions in Writer work just like many other 
word processing applications, but in this section, you run down some tech-
niques and nuggets that will help your productivity and creativity. After all, 
formatting applies not only to text but also to how the elements in your docu-
ment look — and the whole document, itself.
Saving time with keyboard shortcuts
When you’re typing away, sometimes you might not want to stop, grab the 
mouse, click a toolbar tab, and then select a button from the toolbar that 
appears. Well, you’re in luck — Writer contains many keyboard shortcuts for 
common actions, including those in Table 2-2.

Aligning page elements
When you insert new page elements (such as an image or a table), or just 
write a paragraph or text or add a title, you might want to alter its position. 
One easy way to do that is to align the page element by using the justification 
buttons in Zoho Writer.
 
You can also add elements to Writer layers if you want more fine control over 
positioning such elements in your document. For more on layers, go to
http://blogs.zoho.com/writer/layers-embedding-documents-and-more
To set the justification of page elements, use the appropriate button on the 
Format toolbar (click the Format toolbar tool to see the Format toolbar). 
Select the element and then click the appropriate button. Your choices are 
left, center, right, and full (stretched between left and right with variable 
spacing between words).

 Chapter 2: Zoho Writer: Getting It Down in Print
Here’s the nub, though. Say you import an image of a birthday cake into 
an invitation that already has text. (Read how in the upcoming section, 
“Inserting images in Writer.”) The image left-aligns, but you want to 
center-align it in the invitation. Good enough. Click the cake image to select 
it, and then click the Justify Center button. You see the result in the top half 
of Figure 2-5.
 
Figure 2-5: 
Center-align 
an image.
 
Ruler width
Hmm. In Figure 2-5, you might think that instead of centered, the image is too 
far left. In fact, Zoho did its job and centered the image in the page — but the 
page width is wider than you might expect.
You can check the page width by taking a look at the ruler, which appears at 
the top of the writing space in Writer. As shown in the top half of Figure 2-5, 
the page width — shown by the white space of the ruler — extends from the 
right margin all the way to nearly the left edge of the page.

32
Part I: Working with Documents 
To adjust the page width, simply use the mouse to drag the edges of the 
ruler. For example, check out the invitation with a new (and more appropri-
ate) page width in the bottom half of Figure 2-5 (where the title has also been 
centered).
Making your text look pretty
You have many ways to customize the appearance of your text with the 
Format toolbar (click the Format tab to see the Format toolbar). Here are 
some of the possibilities:
  
Font face
Font size
Style
Font color
 
✓ Choose a different font. You might like other fonts better than the 
default font in Writer (Verdana). First, select the text you want to 
change, and then choose the new font from the Font Face drop-down 
list box.
 
✓ Change the font size. Frequently when you format text, you want to 
set the size of that text. For example, you probably want to make title 
text stand out more than the rest of your text. With Writer, selecting a 
new font size is a snap. Just select the text you want to change and then 
choose the new size (in points) from the Font Size drop-down list box.
 
 If you don’t see the font size that you want in the drop-down list box, 
just type the size you want (in points) in the text box at the top of the 
drop-down list box and then press Enter.
 
✓ Select a font color. Say you want some red text in your document. To 
color text, select the text you want to color and then click the Font Color 
button. From the color palette that opens (see Figure 2-6), just double-
click that color in the dialog box. The new color is applied to the text 
you selected.

33
 Chapter 2: Zoho Writer: Getting It Down in Print
 
Figure 2-6: 
The Font 
Color 
palette.
 
 
 Be careful about using red text if you’re going to spellcheck your docu-
ment because Writer marks misspellings in red.
 
✓ Use a style: A style is a collection of formats, and using styles ensures 
consistency throughout your document. Zoho offers a number of styles 
from the Style drop-down list box.
 
 As of this writing, Zoho Writer offers only 13 styles (6 of which corre-
spond to the HTML <font> element’s size attribute, which can range 
from 1 to 6).
 
 You can also add your own CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) to a Zoho Writer 
document if you want to use your own pre-created styles. To attach a 
style sheet to your document, select the Insert Style Sheet item from the 
Style drop-down list box and enter your style sheet file location. You’ll 
need to edit the HTML of the document directly (in particular, you have 
to set the style attribute of text you want to style) to use the styles in 
your style sheet.
Putting a hex on your colors
If you don’t see the color you want in the color 
palette dialog box, you can enter the hex code 
for the color directly into the text box in the 
dialog box, such as the value #FF3366. These 
color values are the same hex values that 
browsers use, and they’re composed of three 
color triplets — rrggbb — where rr is the red 
color value (00–ff), gg is the green color value 
(00–ff), and bb is the blue color value (00–ff). 
To create your own color values, you can use 
online utilities, such as the color picker at 
www.pagetutor.com/colorpicker/
index.html.

Part I: Working with Documents 
Inserting Elements in a Writer Document
You’re not limited to just using text in a Writer document. You can also add 
images, links, tables, and more. Here’s how easy it is.
Inserting images in Writer
You can juice up your Writer documents by adding images easily: Just click the 
Insert Image button on the Action toolbar. For example, say you want to add an 
image of a birthday cake (cake.jpg) to a birthday invitation. Here’s how:
 
1. Click the Insert toolbar tab and then click the Image button on the 
Insert toolbar.
 
 The Insert Image dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 2-7.
 
Figure 2-7: 
The Insert 
Image 
dialog box.
 
 
2. Find the image you want to embed.
 
 To upload an image from your machine, click the Browse button and 
navigate to your image.
 
 To preview an image, click the Preview button, and your image will 
appear in the dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-7.
 
3. After you make your choice, click Insert to place the image into your 
document.
 
 If you don’t want to insert the image at this time, click Cancel.
 
 Your new image is inserted into your document at the location of the 
text cursor. You can see what the cake looks like in the document shown 
in Figure 2-8.

35
 Chapter 2: Zoho Writer: Getting It Down in Print
 
Figure 2-8:

inserted

Inserting a hyperlink
You can also insert a hyperlink into a Writer document. For example, if 
you reference an online article in your text, you can link to the article in 
case the reader wants more information. To insert a hyperlink, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Place the text cursor in the document where you want the new hyper-
link to appear.
 
2. Click the arrow on the Insert toolbar tab and choose the Insert/Modify 
Link from the drop-down menu.
 
 The Insert/Modify Link dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 2-9.
 
Figure 2-9: 
The Insert/
Modify Link 
dialog box.
 

36
Part I: Working with Documents 
 
3. Fill in these fields:
 
• URL: The URL that the hyperlink should link to
 
• Anchor: The anchor for the URL (typically given at the end of an 
URL, following a # sign
 
 If you don’t know what that means, you don’t need to fill anything 
in this field
 
• Selected Text: The text you want to appear in the document for the 
link
 
• Title (tooltip): The text you want to appear in a tooltip when the 
user moves the mouse over the link
 
• Target: The hyperlink’s target
 
 Specify whether you want the linked-to page to replace the current 
page or to appear in a new browser window.
 
4. Click Insert to insert the new hyperlink, or click Cancel to close the 
dialog box without inserting the link.
 
 You can see a new hyperlink in the example advertisement in Figure 
2-10. Note that by default, hyperlinks appear underlined and blue. They 
change to green after they’re clicked.
 
Figure 2-10: 
A new 
hyperlink.
 
Creating and Refining Tables in Writer
To create a table in Writer, start by clicking the Insert Table button. A sample 
grid appears, as you can see in Figure 2-11. You click the cell that corre-
sponds to the lower-right cell of your table, and Writer creates that table for 
you; see Figure 2-12.

a table in 
Zoho Writer.
 
Insert Table
Lower-right cell of your table
 
Figure 2-12: 
A new table

Writer.
 
If the table is wider than you need, click the table to display a set of sizing 
handles — white squares that you can drag — and then drag the sizing 
handles to resize the table how you want. Release the sizing handle, and the 
resized table snaps into position.
To add a new row or a column to a table, simply right-click the table, as 
shown in Figure 2-13, select the Table Operations item, and then choose 
the Insert Row After or Insert Column After menu option. You can see many 
other standard table formatting options on this menu, such as deleting rows 
and columns and justifying text.
To enter text into a cell in a table, just click that cell, and then type your text. 
Proceeding cell by cell, you can enter what you want. You can format table 
headers by formatting the text in them as bold and making their font size 
larger.

38
Part I: Working with Documents 
 
Figure 2-13: 
Format 
your table 
with these 
choices.
 
To access more sophisticated table formatting options, open the Table 
Properties dialog box. Right-click your table, select Table Operations, and 
then choose the Table Properties menu item. The Table Properties dialog 
box appears, as shown in Figure 2-14.
 
Figure 2-14: 
The Table 
Properties 
dialog box.
 
Use the various sections of the Table Properties dialog box to customize the 
appearance of your table by setting the properties (the width and number) of 
the various borders.
All the Full Facts: Getting 
Your Document’s History
Say you change the formatting in your document. Maybe you remove the 
rules from a table but want to put them back. Fortunately, Zoho Writer keeps 
a history of your document, and you can easily revert to an earlier version of 
your document.

39
 Chapter 2: Zoho Writer: Getting It Down in Print
Every time you save a document, Writer saves it with a new version number. 
To see the previous versions — and perhaps revert your document to one 
of them — click the Review tab to display the Review toolbar. Then click the 
History button, which opens the History section shown in Figure 2-15.
 
Figure 2-15:

section.
 
Click to return to editing
History section
To look through previous versions, just click them in the History section.
 
To return to editing your document from the History page, click the Return to 
Editor link shown in Figure 2-15.
Organizing Your Documents with Tags
Zoho Writer allows you to tag documents to make it easy to organize those 
documents. Tags are words that mark a certain document. For example, you 
might tag the document containing a Grades table as Grades.
Follow these steps to tag your document:
 
1. Click the Tags button at the bottom right of the document.
 
 This opens the Tags section, as you can see in Figure 2-16.

40
Part I: Working with Documents 
 
Figure 2-16: 
Entering 
a tag.
 
 
2. Enter the tag name and then click the Add button.
 
 To create a new folder for the tag in the Tags Folder section of the left 
pane, click the tag and choose the Add as Folder menu item. This adds a 
new folder for the tag, and you can open the folder by double-clicking it 
in the Tag Folders section of the left pane. Doing so shows all the docu-
ments with that tag, as you can see in Figure 2-17.

Like a Cookie Cutter: Templates
Templates are just like cookie cutters: You use a template as the basis for a 
document. Templates can contain all kinds of styles, ready for use, such as 
headings, body text, and margins. When you create a new document from 
that template, those styles automatically become available to you.
Even better, templates aren’t restricted to styles. Templates can also contain 
boilerplate text — that is, standard text — that appears when you create a 
new document from the template.

41
 Chapter 2: Zoho Writer: Getting It Down in Print
Including boilerplate text is also useful for letters that just need tweaked with 
a product or person’s name, or that contain strict legal language.
Finding and downloading a template
Zoho Writer maintains a library of templates for you to choose from at 
http://writer.zoho.com/templates.htm. Either navigate to the URL 
via your browser or choose the library from the Help drop-down menu in 
Writer. Either path opens the Template Library, as shown in Figure 2-18.
 
Figure 2-18: 
The 
Template 
Library.
 
Preview templates
As you can see in Figure 2-18, the first template shown is a generic fact sheet 
template. Move from template to template by clicking the boxed numbers. 
You find resume templates, cover letter templates, speech outline templates, 
and so on.
 
If you don’t feel like previewing each template one by one to find what you 
want, use the Search Templates feature to search the descriptions of all the 
templates in the Template Library. Or, check out the Most Popular templates. 
As of this writing, the most popular template is the IT Resume template. Go 
figure. Just click the template to preview it in full.
After you choose a template, download it. Every template you open to pre-
view has an Add to My Templates link. Just click that link to add the template 
to your own collection of templates. You can see the template added to the 
Templates section of the left pane.

42
Part I: Working with Documents 
Using a template
Say you want to create a new document based on the IT Resume template. To 
do that, just follow these steps:
 
1. Open the Templates section in the left pane.
 
2. Click the template you wish to use.
 
 A preview of the template opens, as you can see in Figure 2-19.
 
Figure 2-19: 
A template 
preview.
 
Click to create document from this template
At this point, decide whether to create a document based on this template 
as-is or with an edited template.
If you’re going for Door #1, follow these steps to create a document from the 
template you chose:
 
1. Click the Use This Template link at the top of the template preview.
 
 This creates a new Writer document based on the template.
 
2. In the template that opens, edit the boilerplate text.
Hmm. Maybe you don’t want to edit all that text every time you create a new 
document from the template. Time for Door #2.

43
 Chapter 2: Zoho Writer: Getting It Down in Print
You can easily edit the templates you work with in Zoho Writer. Just follow 
these steps:
 
1. Open the Templates section in the left pane and then click the tem-
plate you wish to edit.
 
2. In the template that opens, click the Edit Template link.
 
3. Make your edits to the template (including styles and fonts) as you 
would to any Writer document.
 
4. Click the Save Template link.
 
 This saves the new version of the template with the same template name.
Clicking the Save Template link saves the new version of the template. When 
you preview it (by clicking it in the Template section), you see that the 
changes were indeed made and saved to the template.
You customized a Zoho Writer template. Nice.
Creating your own template
So you don’t want what’s behind Door #1 or Door #2. You want just the right 
template for your needs. Say you run a bird shop and need a business letter 
telling customers a rare bird arrived. Or you might be a scientist who needs 
a template useful for applying for government grants. You can certainly 
create your own templates in Zoho Writer.
 
You don’t have to create a template to use a document as boilerplate for other 
documents. You can just open the document and make changes, saving the 
result each time.
I see two big advantages to creating your own templates:
 
✓ You can share the template, as a template, with other users. Read more 
about this in the next section, “Exporting a template to the Template 
Library.”
 
✓ The template appears in the Templates section of Writer, not in the 
My Docs section. The Templates section is usually a lot less crowded 
than the My Docs section, making templates more readily accessible to 
be used as boilerplate.

44
Part I: Working with Documents 
Saving an open document as a template is simple:
 
1. Click the Save As button (the button with a diskette and pencil on it).
 
2. Choose the Template menu item.
 
3. Enter the name for your template in the Save as Template dialog box.
 
4. Click OK.
 
 The new template appears in the Templates section of the left pane.
Exporting a template to 
the Template Library
Like your template so much that you want to share it with other Zoho users 
that you don’t even know? Export your template to the Template Library.
For any open template, all you need to do is click the Export to Template 
Library link that appears at the top of the preview. In the Template Library 
Details dialog box that appears, just fill in the details about your template 
and then click the Export button.

Zoho Writer: Publishing, Sharing, 
and Working Offline
In This Chapter
▶ Adding comments in your documents
▶ Publishing your documents
▶ Sharing documents
▶ Sharing with groups
▶ Working offline
I
n Chapter 2, you find out how to create Zoho Writer documents. But 
there’s a lot more in Zoho Writer to cover and use to its full potential. This 
chapter explains how to add comments to, publish, and share documents, as 
well as work offline.
One thing I love about a Zoho Writer document is the freedom of sharing 
your document with collaborators — simultaneously! Not only that, but you 
can collaborate in real time. And as I mention in Chapter 2, you don’t have to 
worry about whether the new computer supports the same word processor, 
or even the same version of that word processor. Zoho seamlessly meshes 
everyone’s contributions into the same document without conflicting edits.
Of course, because this is Zoho, you can work on the document without 
having to be at your desk or having to connect to your business’s intranet or 
wiki. Win, win, win.
Having Your Say with Comments
Sometimes, you want to add text about your text. For example, you might want 
to pass a document along to folks and ask them questions about some of your 
text, or ask questions about some of the text in one of their documents.

46
Part I: Working with Documents 
Adding a comment to text is simple. Just follow these steps:
 
1. Select the text that you want to comment on; then click the Add 
Comment button on the Insert toolbar.
 
 This opens the Add Comment dialog box that appears in Figure 3-1.
 
Figure 3-1: 
Adding a 
comment.
 
 
2. Enter the text for the comment and then click Add (or click Cancel to 
cancel the operation and not add the comment).
Take a look at Figure 3-2, which is the first draft of a letter to the investors of 
a company.

Contextual Comments
The 150,000 in 150,000 units is highlighted in orange (trust me on that one), 
and there’s a little comment icon next to it (like a speech bubble in a car-
toon). Both items indicate that there’s a comment there. When you click the 
comment icon, the comment text pops up, as you can see in Figure 3-3. To 
dismiss the Comments dialog box, click the X button at the upper right.

47
 Chapter 3: Zoho Writer: Publishing, Sharing, and Working Offline
 
Figure 3-3:

a document.
 
Comments are useful as notes to yourself, of course, but the real use for com-
ments in Zoho Writer becomes apparent when you share a document, which I 
cover in the upcoming section, “What’s Mine Is Yours: Sharing Documents.”
 
To view all comments in a document at once, open the Comments pane, which 
displays all a document’s comments at the same time on the right side of the 
screen. You can open the Comments pane by clicking the Contextual 
Comments button at the extreme lower right of the editing space.
Getting the Word Out: Printing 
and Publishing to the Web
You can print Writer documents just like any other document. Of course, all 
printers are different, so I won’t get into that. Just use the Print button.
You can also share documents by publishing them on the Web directly. Zoho 
makes your documents accessible from any browser, if you want. This is 
a nice feature of Zoho Writer because you can automatically publish your 
documents as Web pages, hosted by Zoho for you.
Here’s how:
 
1. Open the document you want to publish on the Web.
 
2. Click the Publish button on the Share toolbar.
 
3. Choose the Public Info item from the drop-down menu that opens.
 
 Writer displays the warning you see in Figure 3-4.
 
Figure 3-4: 
The public 
document 
warning.
 

48
Part I: Working with Documents 
 
4. Click the Publish button to publish your document on the Web, or 
click Cancel to cancel.
 
 In the Public Share dialog box that opens, Writer gives you a small HTML 
script (as you see in Figure 3-5) to embed into a Web page that will dis-
play your document.
 
 Note the Allow Others to Give Comments check box at the bottom of the 
figure. Select that check box if you want people to leave comments on 
your Web page.
 
Figure 3-5: 
The 
publishing

Here’s a sample script (the src attribute points to a JavaScript script that 
does the actual inserting of the document):
<script
src=”http://writer.zoho.com/public/sholzner/Advertisement/script”
>
</script>
To embed this script in a Web page, open the Web page’s source file and 
paste the preceding <script> element where you want your Writer docu-
ment to appear.
When you embed this script in a Web page and navigate to that Web page 
with your browser, you see your document, as shown in Figure 3-6. Note the 
Comments link at lower left — viewers of your page can leave comments by 
clicking that link and entering their comments. 
Congratulations! You published your document to the Web.
 
You can also publish a document to a blog if you select the Publish button’s 
Publish to Blog option from the drop-down menu. You’ll be asked for your 
blog host, as well as your username and password.

What’s Mine Is Yours: 
Sharing Documents
Sharing documents is one of Zoho Writer’s big plusses, and it’s not too much 
to say that many companies use online applications like Writer in preference 
to desktop applications because online applications let you share documents 
with other people — collaborators — easily.
How easily? Take a look.
Inviting collaborators
To share a document, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the document in Zoho Writer.
 
2. Click the Share button on the Share toolbar.
 
 The Share This Document dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 3-7. 
Make sure that the Invite tab is selected.

50
Part I: Working with Documents 
 
Figure 3-7:

3. Enable document sharing with other Writer users by selecting one of 
the following options:
 
• To let people share the document but only view the document: Enter 
their e-mail addresses, separated by commas, in the Read Only 
Members field for Individuals.
 
• To let people share the document by allowing them to view and edit 
the document: Enter their e-mail addresses, separated by commas, 
in the Read/Write Members field for Individuals.
 
4. Click the Edit Invitation Mail button to create an e-mail message to 
send to the people you want to invite; see Figure 3-8. Enter a subject 
line and craft your message here.

tab) the people with whom you’re sharing the document, as shown in 
Figure 3-9.
 
Figure 3-9:

orators.
 
 
The Share This Document dialog box also lists the permissions for each col-
laborator. Here’s how you can customize permissions for your collaborators:
 
✓ To change the permission for a collaborator: Click the Change link 
at the right. The permission toggles between View Only and View/Edit 
when you click this button.
 
✓ To delete a collaborator: Click the Remove link.
The people you invited — your prospective collaborators — will receive an 
e-mail like this:
Hi User, Steve has shared a document with you on Zoho 
Writer named ‘Investor Letter’ 
---------------------------------------
Click here to view the document shared by sholzner
writer.zoho.com/Home.do?shrDocId=Investor-
Letter&author=sholzner 
When a collaborator clicks the link, he’s asked to log into Zoho, and a dialog 
box appears, asking whether to open your document.

52
Part I: Working with Documents 
When collaborators edit 
a shared document
When a collaborator is editing your document, that document is highlighted 
with a yellow background (and you can’t edit the document), so you know that 
changes might appear. See Figure 3-10. (If you don’t like the changes, you can 
always revert to an earlier version using the document’s history. See Chapter 2 
for more the history feature.) Note that Writer does not have a revision marks 
feature like you’d find in other word processors like Microsoft Word.
 
Figure 3-10: 
A col-
laborator is

Collaborators can answer comments from other editors. (See “Having Your 
Say with Comments,” earlier in the chapter.) For example, if a collaborator 
wants to respond to your comment, “Is this right?” in Figure 3-11, he just 
clicks the Add Comment link and types his response, as shown in Figure 3-11.
When the collaborator stops editing the document and signs out, the back-
ground of the document returns to normal (not yellow).
When you click the comment icon, you can see the collaborator’s return com-
ment, as shown in Figure 3-11, offering a correction. To delete a comment, 
right-click the comment icon and choose the Cut menu item.

Communicating with a document’s 
collaborators
Can you get in touch with your collaborators interactively, while they’re edit-
ing your document? Certainly.
To send a message to the collaborators who are currently editing or viewing 
your document, click the Collaborators button, which is the third from the 
right at the lower right in the browser, and type your message into the mes-
sage box in the Collaborators pane; see Figure 3-12.
When you finish typing your message, press Enter. Your message is then visible 
to all collaborators who have your document open, as shown in Figure 3-12.

Part I: Working with Documents 
The Collaborators pane holds your back-and-forth conversation, much like 
an IM interface. In this way, you can exchange messages with your collabora-
tors, chatting with them.
 
Your collaborators get a link to your document in the invitation, but your 
collaborators can also access your document again by opening the Shared 
Docs section to see a list of the documents that they’re sharing. Clicking any 
document opens that document for editing or viewing.
Collaborating with groups of collaborators
Besides sharing documents with individuals, you can share documents with 
whole groups of Writer users. To share a document with a group, you have to 
create a group first. To do that, follow these steps:
 
1. With the to-be-shared document open in Writer, click the Share button 
on the Share toolbar to open the Share This Document dialog box. 
(Refer to Figure 3-7.)
 
2. Click the Add Groups link.
 
 This opens the Groups List dialog box, shown in Figure 3-13.
 
Figure 3-13: 
The Groups 
List dialog 
box.
 
 
3. Click the Create New Group link in the Groups List dialog box to open 
the Create Your Personal Group dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-14.
 
4. Fill in the following fields:
 
• Group Name: The name you want to give your new group
 
• Description (Optional): A description of your new group
 
• Members Mail IDs: The e-mail addresses of the individuals you want 
to invite to the group
 
 Use a comma to separate multiple e-mails.

• Enter a Short Message: The message you want to send with the invi-
tation to join the group
 
• Select Invitation Language: The language for the invitation (English, 
Chinese, or Japanese)
 
Figure 3-14:

5. Click the Create button.
 
 A summary dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 3-15, showing your new 
group.
 
Figure 3-15:

 You created a new group of collaborators.

56
Part I: Working with Documents 
Inviting a group of collaborators 
to share a document
After you create a group, you can invite its members to share a document. To 
do that, follow these steps:
 
1. With the document that you want to share open in Writer, click the 
Share button on the Share toolbar.
 
2. In the Share This Document dialog box that opens, click the Add 
Groups link.
 
3. In the Groups List dialog box that opens (refer to Figure 3-13), click 
the name of the group you want to share the document with; then 
close the Groups List by clicking the X button at the upper right.
 
4. Click the Share button in the Share This Document dialog box to share 
the document with the group. 
 
 All the members in the group get an e-mail invitation. Now you can share 
a document with a whole group at once.
Managing groups
After you create your groups, it’s important to know how to manage those 
groups: inviting new members, editing your group member list, and even 
deleting a group.
To invite new members to a group, follow these steps:
 
1. With the document that you want to share open in Writer, click the 
Share button on the Share toolbar.
 
2. Click the Add Groups link.
 
3. In the Groups List dialog box that opens, click the My Groups link.
 
4. Click the Invite link (refer to Figure 3-15) for the entry for the group to 
which you want to invite new members.
 
 This opens the Invite Friends dialog box; see Figure 3-16.
 
5. Enter the e-mail addresses of the group members you’re inviting, and 
also enter a short message.
 
6. Click the Invite button.
 
7. Close the Summary dialog box that opens.
 
8. Close the Groups List dialog box and then the Share This Document 
dialog box.

57
 Chapter 3: Zoho Writer: Publishing, Sharing, and Working Offline
 
Figure 3-16:

Friends 
dialog box.
 
Editing the members of a group works much the same way. Note: Editing 
just lets you delete members of the group — you can’t set permissions 
individually by member.
 
1. Open the document that you want to share and then click the Share 
button on the Share toolbar.
 
2. Click the Add Groups link.
 
3. Click the My Groups link in the Groups List dialog box, opening the 
Groups List dialog box.
 
4. Click the Edit link for the group you want to edit.
 
5. In the Edit Group dialog box that opens, click the Edit Group Details 
link.
 
6. In the Groups dialog box that opens (see Figure 3-17), make the edits 
you want to the group and then close the dialog box.
 
Figure 3-17:

7. Close the Summary dialog box that opens, and then close the Groups 
List dialog box and the Share This Document dialog box.
 
Deleting a group works just the same except that you click the Delete link for 
the entry for the group you want to delete.
Importing and Exporting Documents
You can import documents easily to Writer — just click the Import button at 
the upper left in Writer to open the Import Document dialog box, as shown in 
Figure 3-18.
 
Figure 3-18: 
The Import 
Document 
dialog box.
 
To import a document, click the Browse button, select the document in the 
File Upload dialog box that opens, click the Open button, and then click the 
Import button.
You can import these file types:
 
✓ DOC: Microsoft Word document, pre–Word 2007
 
✓ DOCX: Microsoft Word Document, Word 2007 or later
 
✓ ODF (ODT): OpenOffice.org document
 
✓ PDF: Portable Document Format document
 
✓ LaTeX: LaTeX document

59
 Chapter 3: Zoho Writer: Publishing, Sharing, and Working Offline
 
✓ SXW: Star Office document
 
✓ RTF: Rich Text Format document
 
✓ TXT: Text document
 
✓ HTML: HTML document
Now what about exporting documents? Although you can edit, print, custom-
ize, and work with your document online, sometimes you need to have a 
physical file for your document, like when you need to pass the document to 
someone who doesn’t know about Zoho.
After you create (and potentially collaborate on) a document, you can access 
it and share it outside Writer by exporting it. When you export a document, 
Writer sends it to your browser, which downloads it.
 
 To export a document, click the Export button shown in the margin. You see 
a drop-down list of the export file types from which to choose — these types 
are the same as the allowed formats for importing a document.
After you choose the export file type, Writer sends your document to your 
browser, and a dialog box from your browser opens, like the one in Figure 3-19.
 
Figure 3-19: 
A download 
dialog box.
 
If you ask your browser to download the document and open it, it’ll open in the 
application on your computer best suited to that type of document. For exam-
ple, you can see a Writer document opened in Microsoft Word in Figure 3-20.
 
The comments in the document are repeated faithfully in the Microsoft Word 
version of the document, as you can see in Figure 3-20.

Taking It off the Internet: 
Working Offline
With the help of a package from Google named Gears, you can run Zoho 
Writer offline. In a nutshell, if you’re somewhere the Internet isn’t — say, 
stuck on a plane, with no connectivity — you can still work with Zoho Writer.
Installing Gears from Google
The first step is to install Gears. Your system needs to meet these 
requirements:
OS
Browser
Windows XP or Vista
Internet Explorer (IE) 6 or higher
Windows XP or Vista
Firefox 1.5 or higher
Windows XP or Vista
Google Chrome*
Mac OS X 10.2 or higher
Firefox 1.5 or higher
Linux
Firefox 1.5 or higher
Windows Mobile 5 or higher
Internet Explorer 4.01 or higher
 
*Chrome has Gears built in, so you don’t need to follow the remaining installation instructions. 

61
 Chapter 3: Zoho Writer: Publishing, Sharing, and Working Offline
If your system meets these requirements, go to http://gears.google.
com, the Gears homepage. Then follow these steps to install Gears:
 
1. Click the Install Gears button on the Gears home page.
 
2. On the Terms and Conditions page that opens, click the Agree and 
Download button.
 
3. Save the GearsSetup.exe file:
 
• IE: Click Save in the dialog box that appears.
 
• Firefox: Click Save File.
 
 If you’re using Internet Explorer, you might get a security bar at the top 
of the page, blocking the download. Click the security bar and then 
select the Download File item.
 
4. Run the downloaded GearsSetup.exe file and follow the directions.
 
5. Close your browser and restart it before using Gears with Zoho Writer.
Using Writer with Gears
To set up Writer to work with Gears, follow these steps after you install Gears:
 
1. Sign in to Zoho Writer.
 
2. Click the Go Offline link at the top of the Zoho Writer page.
 
3. In the Gears Security Warning dialog box that appears, select the I 
Trust This Site Allow It to Use Gears check box.
 
4. Click the Allow button in the Gears Security Warning dialog box.
 
 Gears will transfer up to 25 of your most recent documents to your 
computer.
 
To download more than 25 documents, click the down arrow next to the Go 
Offline link and select the number of documents to download. 
Now, when you click the Go Offline link, up to 25 documents will be down-
loaded for you to work on. Note: You won’t have to go through the I Trust 
This Site process after the first time.
You’re ready to work offline. To do that, navigate your browser to http://
writer.zoho.com/offline. That’s all it takes. Now you can work with 
documents, opening them as usual, in Writer, even though you’re offline. 
When you’re done, there’s no need to sign out from Zoho; after all, you’re not 
signed in. Just close your browser.

62
Part I: Working with Documents 
Synching your offline documents 
with Writer online
Synchronizing your offline documents with your online documents is a 
snap. The next time your computer has access to the Internet, navigate your 
browser to http://writer.zoho.com/offline. That’s right: to the offline 
address.
Zoho Writer displays its Synchronization Summary dialog box (see Figure 
3-21), listing the online documents that are out of date and need to be 
refreshed using your offline versions. To upload your offline documents 
(as new versions of those documents, as kept track of by Writer), click the 
Synchronize button.

Chapter 4
Zoho Show: Lights, 
Camera, Action!
In This Chapter
▶ Creating presentations
▶ Adding slides
▶ Using text and images
▶ Adding shapes
▶ Sharing presentations
▶ Viewing presentations online
P
resentation software has become hugely popular. Want to present your 
idea to a group of investors? Create a presentation. Want to present 
your company’s profits for the last quarter? Create a presentation. Want to 
show shareholders how your organization works? Create a presentation.
Presentations are comprised of slides, one after the other, that you present to 
your audience. Zoho Show is perfect for this purpose, helping you create and 
share your slide shows; add text, images, clip art; and more.
I take a look at Zoho Show in this chapter. It’s easy to use and allows you to 
create professional presentations in a snap. And you can easily share those 
presentations with others — which is a good thing, because that’s the whole 
idea behind presentations.
Creating a Presentation
To sign in to Zoho Show, go to http://show.zoho.com, enter your user-
name and password, and then click the Sign In button. (See Chapter 1 for 
information on signing up for a Zoho username and password.) From here, 
you can either create a new presentation or import an existing presentation, 
as I describe in the following sections.

64
Part I: Working with Documents 
Creating a new presentation
The Zoho Show welcome page is where you create a new presentation. 
Follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Create New button at the upper left, opening the page you 
see in Figure 4-1.
 
 On the Create New Presentation page, you can name your presentation 
and customize it to some extent.
 
Figure 4-1: 
Creating a 
presenta-
tion.
 
 
2. Enter a descriptive name for your new presentation in the 
Presentation Name text box.
 
3. (Optional) Change the prepopulated tag in the Tags field.
 
 When you enter a presentation name in Step 2, Show also copies that 
text into the Tags field. Show tags (which work just the same way as 
Writer tags; covered in Chapter 2) are descriptive keywords that you 
can search on, finding matching presentations.
 
4. Choose a theme category from the Category pane on the left.
 
 Selecting a theme allows you to specify the background of the slides you’ll 
use in the presentation. As you can see in Figure 4-1, you can pick from six 
categories of themes in Show, ranging from Jazzy to Funky to Plain.
 
5. Select one of the slide themes on the right.
 
 When you select a category, you see a group of themes that you can 
select from.

65
 Chapter 4: Zoho Show: Lights, Camera, Action!
 
6. After you specify your presentation’s name, description, tags, and 
theme, click the Start button to open and start editing your new pre-
sentation (which I get to after discussing how to import presentations).
Importing an existing presentation
Another option is to import a presentation into Show. The presentation 
types you can import are Microsoft PowerPoint (PPT, PPS documents) or 
OpenOffice.org (ODP, SXI documents).
To import a presentation, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Import button (at the top left of the welcome page), opening 
the page you see in Figure 4-2.
 
Figure 4-2: 
Importing a 
presenta-
tion.
 
 
2. You can import a local document on your computer or a presentation 
on the Web. Just select the appropriate option and then either browse 
to the document or enter the URL.
 
 Presentation documents that you import should be 10MB or smaller, 
according to Zoho.
 
3. Enter a name for the presentation, a description, and tags.
 
4. Choose from two import options: read/write mode or read-only mode.
 
 If you don’t want to make inadvertent changes to the document, select 
read-only mode.

66
Part I: Working with Documents 
 
5. When you’re all set, click the Import button to import your presenta-
tion, opening it in Zoho Show.
Welcome to Zoho Show
When you click the Start button to create a new presentation, or click the 
Import button to import an existing presentation, you see the presentation in 
Zoho Show, as shown in Figure 4-3, where I just created a new presentation.
Getting to know the interface
Spend a few moments taking a look at Zoho Show. The left pane holds an 
overview of the slides in your presentation. All your slides are displayed 
here, and clicking one lets you open that slide in the editing area — your 
workspace — located in the center of Zoho Show.

To the right is a set of four stacked tabs:
 
✓ Shapes: A vast collection of shapes and callouts, including clip art 
for you to use. For the lowdown on shapes, see the section “Adding 
shapes,” later in this chapter.
 
✓ Themes: Contains the Show themes you can use in your presentation. 
To find out more about themes, see “Changing themes on the fly,” later 
in this chapter.
 
✓ Version Details: Displays the version of your presentation.
 
✓ Info: Presentation name, description, tags, and so on.
Note the space for notes for this slide: the Type Your Notes for This Slide 
Here text box at the bottom of the window. You can add notes for each slide 
in this section; the notes will be visible only to you when you play the presen-
tation, allowing you to create your own speech scripts, if you like.
The slide in the editing area is ready for you to edit and format. But before you 
jump in and start editing this slide, take a look at a crucial Show concept: views.
Understanding presentation views
When you start working on a presentation, you see toolbars, tabbed controls, 
and so on that you use to edit and work on your slides.
However, when you want to actually show your presentation to your audi-
ence, you don’t want toolbars or menus showing. You just want to see slides. 
For this reason, you can use different views to see your presentation. From 
the Slide View drop-down menu, you can choose from these three options 
when editing your presentation:
 
✓ Normal View: This view — the view you see in Figure 4-3 — is what 
Show starts with. You edit your slides, add new slides, and create your 
presentation in this view.
 
✓ Master View: Use Master View to customize aspects of your presenta-
tion across all slides at once. When you enter Master View, you see two 
slides — title master and slide master — and editing the styles in those 
slides lets you edit the styles across all slides.
 
✓ Sorter View: This view gives you an overview of all your slides at once, 
allowing you to arrange and sort your slides. This view is particularly 
useful when you have many slides to work with.

68
Part I: Working with Documents 
One other viewing option is Slideshow. This is the view that your audience 
will think of because this is how you display your slides in a slide show. For 
more on this view, see the section “Showtime! Presenting Your Presentation,” 
later in this chapter.
Customizing Your Presentation
In Normal View, your first slide looks similar to what you see in Figure 4-3. 
Suppose that you want to present a new Internet business idea called 
InstaNowPay. You might change that slide to read like this:
Presenting: InstaNowPay
The Instant Impulse Buying Online System
In the following sections, you find out how to add slides, text, bullets, and 
shapes to your presentation.
 
In Show, all text and images are objects. To delete an object, you just have to 
right-click it and then choose Cut Object from the menu that appears.
Adding slides
To add a new slide to your presentation, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the New Slide button (upper left in Show) and then choose 
Create Slide.
 
 If you want to create a slide just like the first slide in the presentation, 
choose Duplicate Slide after you click the New Slide button.
 
 The Create New Slide dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 4-4.
 
Figure 4-4: 
The Create 
New Slide 
dialog box.
 

69
 Chapter 4: Zoho Show: Lights, Camera, Action!
 
2. Choose one of the following new slide types:
 
• Blank Slide: An empty slide.
 
• Title Slide: A slide that has a text box for a title.
 
• Title with Text: A title slide that also has a text box for text.
 
• Title with Points: A title slide with a box for entering bullet points. 
Figure 4-5 shows what the new Title with Points slide looks like.
 
• Two Text Blocks: A slide with two text blocks below the title.
 
3. Click the Create Slide button.
 
 That creates a new slide, which is added to your presentation.
 
Figure 4-5: 
A new slide.
 
Placeholder text
 
Here are a few other tips for working with slides:
 
✓ To sort slides, click the View button, select Sorter View, and then drag 
the slides around as you want them.
 
✓ To delete a slide, right-click it in the left-hand pane and select Delete.
 
✓ To save your presentation, click the Save button.

Part I: Working with Documents 
Adding text
 
Your new slide is ready to have some text added. So how do you edit the slide 
to make changes, customizing it with the text you want? Follow these steps:
 
1. Click the placeholder text that you want to replace.
 
 A text box appears.
 
 For example, if you click the placeholder text Presentation Title in 
Figure 4-3 (earlier in the chapter), the text box shown in Figure 4-6 
appears.
 
Figure 4-6: 
Editing a 
presenta-
tion title.
 
Formatting toolbar
Text box
 
2. Enter your text into the text box.
 
3. When you’re finished, click outside the text box.
 
 The text box disappears, and the new title appears in the style of the 
original title.
 
4. Click the Save drop-down button and then choose Save from the menu 
that appears.
 
If you want to format the text you entered, use the buttons on the Formatting 
toolbar, as shown in Figure 4-6. These formatting buttons are similar to what 
you use in Zoho Writer (see Chapter 2).

71
 Chapter 4: Zoho Show: Lights, Camera, Action!
Now suppose you want to add additional text but don’t have a placeholder 
for it. In this case, you need to insert a new text box on your slide, as 
described in the following steps:
 
1. Click the Insert button.
 
2. Choose Text Box from the drop-down menu that appears.
 
3. Choose one of the following options:
 
• Title Box 1: A box for a title
 
• Sub Title Box: A box for a subtitle
 
• Title Box 2: A box for a small title
 
• Text Box: A box for text
 
 After you make your selection, a new text box appears on your slide.
 
4. Click the new text box and use the sizing handles (those small black 
squares on the edges of the title’s box) to position the text box where 
you want it.
 
5. Enter your text.
Working with bullets
If you select the Title with Points option when creating your slide, place-
holder bullet text already appears on the slide (refer to Figure 4-5). If you 
don’t have any preformatted bullets on your slide but you want to add them, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Insert button.
 
2. Choose Text Box➪Bullet Box from the drop-down menu that appears.
 
 This creates a new bullet box.
 
3. Click the new bullet box and use the sizing handles to position the 
box where you want it.
Now you’re ready to add your bulleted text. To do so, just click the place-
holder text and start typing; press Enter to separate each bullet. Show adds a 
new bullet for every line, as you see in Figure 4-7.
 
Here’s how to get fancy and give your bullets sub-bullets. Create the new sub-
bullets, select them, and then click the Increase List Level button on the 
Formatting toolbar. To “outdent” bullets, click the Decrease List Level button.

72
Part I: Working with Documents 
 
Figure 4-7:

bullets.
 
Adding shapes
Show comes with many built-in shapes for you to use. Just take a look at the 
palette of shapes at the right in Figure 4-8. There are endless uses for shapes 
in slides — stars to emphasize text, flowchart shapes to show how a process 
works, boxes to set off text, and so on. In the following sections, you get an 
overview of what shapes are available in Show and find out how to insert 
them into your presentation.
Inserting a shape
To see how to put these shapes to work, say, for example, that the text in 
your slide indicates that there should be a button. (See Figure 4-8 for an 
example.) Hmm. There is no button — but you can make one with a shape. 
Show offers 22 basic shapes, as you can see at the right in Figure 4-8, and 
they’re just waiting to be put to work.
Follow these steps to add a shape to your slide:
 
1. Select a shape from the collection of shapes at the right and then drag 
it the desired location on the slide.
 
 For an overview of all the types of shapes that are available, see 
“Exploring shape categories,” later in this chapter.
 
2. Using the sizing handles (see Figure 4-9), resize the shape as desired.

Adding text to a shape
You can also put labeling text into the new shape, making it look as though a 
button has a caption. To add a text box to a shape, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Insert button.
 
2. Choose Text Box➪Text Box from the drop-down menu that appears.
 
 This creates a new text box.
 
3. Click the new text box and use the sizing handles to resize and posi-
tion the box where you want it inside the shape.
 
4. Click in the text box and enter the new text you want to display, as 
shown in Figure 4-11.
Exploring shape categories
In addition to the Basic Shapes collection shown in Figure 4-8, you can also 
add shapes from these categories:
 
✓ Callouts and Stars: Want to add some pizzazz to your presentation? 
Try making it talk — with callouts. In Show, callouts are small “speech 
bubbles” like what you see in cartoons, and you can find them in the 
Callouts and Stars section of the shapes palette in Show.

75
 Chapter 4: Zoho Show: Lights, Camera, Action!
 
 Say, for example, that you need a talking cat. Start with a cat image from 
the ClipArt section (read about this shortly), and then drag a speech 
bubble from the Callouts and Stars section to the slide, as shown in 
Figure 4-12. To add text to the speech bubble, just follow the steps in the 
preceding section.

Add text to 
a shape.
 
 
Figure 4-12:

76
Part I: Working with Documents 
 
 The numbers (8, 16, 24, and so on) in some of the shapes you see on the 
right in Figure 4-12 tell you how many points each of those star shapes 
have.
 
✓ Block Arrows: Another type of shape you can use in slides are arrows, 
which you can access from the Block Arrows palette. Arrows are partic-
ularly useful in slides that show progressions of some kind, from point 
A to point B, or even to point C and D and so on. If you’re illustrating a 
process of some type, arrows are a good choice.
 
 You can see an example slide using an arrow in Figure 4-13.
 
Figure 4-13: 
Add arrows 
to a slide.
 
 
✓ Flow Charts: Flow charts are very popular in presentations because 
you often find yourself trying to illustrate the steps you want people to 
understand. In the Flow Chart category, you find shapes that you can 
use to create a flow chart. Then if you want to connect your flow chart 
boxes, use the Block Arrows shapes in Show, as you see in Figure 4-14. 
Nice.
 
 Compare the arrows in the Block Arrows palette to the arrows in 
Figure 4-14: Some don’t appear in the palette. For example, there’s only 
one curved 90-degree arrow, and it goes from south to east. How did I 
get the others in the slide with the flow chart? Sure, you can rotate 
shapes with the rotation handle, but what about creating an east-to-
south arrow? There’s no way to do that without flipping an image, and 
you can’t do that with the rotation or sizing handles. Here’s the trick: 
Flip shapes by right-clicking them, choosing Properties, clicking the Flip 
& Rotation bar in the dialog box that opens, and then clicking the Flip 
Horizontal or Flip Vertical button as needed.

✓ Symbols: In this catch-all category, you can find shapes such as a moon,

✓ ClipArt: One of the most exciting new additions to Zoho Show is the 
ClipArt category, which you can find in the ClipArt section on the right 
of Show.
 
 Zoho actually does a good job of providing you with many different clip 
art choices, so the chances you’ll find something you can use are good. 
The ClipArt categories range from Animals to Plants to Transport.
 
Don’t see the shape you want? Create it by assembling it from more basic 
shapes. There’s even a line shape that you can rotate and resize to create any 
line-based shape you like.
Setting a solid fill color for shapes
After you add a shape to your slide, you’re not locked in to the current color 
or border. For example, the default color for shapes in Show is gold, which 
is nice, but it gets to be a little monotonous. Say that you want to change a 
star’s color to solid (a fill) red instead of a shaded gold. To do that, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Right-click the shape whose fill you want to change.
 
2. Choose Properties to open the Properties dialog box.
 
3. Make sure that the Fill Color bar is selected.

78
Part I: Working with Documents 
 
4. Select the Solid Fill radio button, which collapses the dialog box so 
that it asks for only a single fill color, as shown in Figure 4-15.
 
5. Click the color box under Fill Color, opening a color picker window.
 
6. Click the color you want.
 
7. If you’re happy with it, click the X button in the upper right of the 
Properties dialog box to close it.

A shady business: Setting a shape’s gradient
Shapes can often look snazzier if you give them a gradient fill — when their fill 
color varies smoothly across the shape from one color to another. The default 
fill for shapes in Show is a gradient from gold to white, proceeding upward.
Here’s how to make the gradient fill go from one color to another, from side 
to side:
 
1. Right-click the shape whose fill you want to change.
 
2. Choose the Properties menu item to open the Properties dialog box. 
Make sure the Fill Color bar is selected.
 
3. Select the Gradient Fill radio button.
 
4. Click the color box in the Fill Color 1 box, opening the color picker.
 
5. Select the shade you want to use and then click OK.
 
6. Click the color box in the Fill Color 2 box, opening the corresponding 
color picker.
 
7. Click the shade you want to use from the color picker and then click OK.
 
8. Select the direction for the gradient in the Gradient Direction section, 
as shown in Figure 4-16.
 
 After you make your selection, a new gradient appears in your shape. Feel 
free to try several gradient directions until you find the one you want.

9. If you’re happy with it, click the X button in the upper right of the 
Properties dialog box to close that dialog box.
 
Click the Presets button in the Properties dialog box to choose from 45 preset 
gradient color schemes.
Setting a shape’s border
By default, Show shapes have a 1-pixel (px) border, but you can change that. 
All you need to do is follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click the shape whose border you want to change.
 
2. Choose Properties to open the Properties dialog box.
 
3. Make sure that the Border bar is selected, opening the Border section 
in the Properties dialog box.
 
4. Select the new width of the border in the Border Thickness drop-
down box.
 
You can select between solid and dashed borders for Show shapes. Just select 
Solid or Dashed from the Border Style drop-down list box in the Border sec-
tion of the Properties dialog box. You can also set the color of the border in 
the same section of the Properties dialog box.
Changing themes on the fly
Although you select a theme when you create a presentation, you’re not 
locked into that. At any time, you can change the theme, which includes the 
color and background used for slides.
To change a presentation’s theme on the fly, just click the Themes tab at the 
upper right in Show; see Figure 4-17.

Part I: Working with Documents 
 
Figure 4-17: 
Change a 
theme here.
 
Themes tab
The Themes tab includes a drop-down list box that lists the categories of 
themes, ranging from Funky to Plain. To select a different theme, just click 
the new theme, which immediately makes it active in the presentation.
Being able to change the theme on the fly allows you to experiment with 
themes, selecting the one that works best for you.
Adding images
Clip art and shapes are fine, but they won’t be specific enough for some of 
your purposes. For example, what if you need to display an image of your 
company’s exalted founder? Or a projected new building? Clearly, you need 
to be able to insert images into a presentation.
To insert images, just follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Insert button and then choose Image from the drop-
down menu.
 
2. In the Insert Image dialog box that appears, click the Browse button, 
navigate to the image file you want to upload, select it, and then 
click OK.
 
 The image appears in the Insert Image dialog box, as shown in Figure 4-18.

Sharing Presentations with 
Other Show Users
As you’d expect, you can share Show presentations with other Show users 
online. You can let others view your presentation, or let them view and edit 
it: The choice is up to you. Here’s how to share a presentation online, which 
gives others access to your presentation:
 
1. Open the presentation you want to share.
 
2. Click the Share button.
 
3. Choose Invite from the drop-down menu that appears.
 
 The Share This Document dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 4-20.
 
Figure 4-20:

4. Enable sharing — and permissions — for other Show users by enter-
ing their e-mail addresses. Choose between assigning users as Read 
Only Members or Read/Write Members.
 
 Separate the names with a comma.
 
 Show lets as many read-only people view your presentation at a time as 
you like, but only one person can edit it at a time.
 
5. (Optional) Select the Notify Me check box if you want to receive an 
e-mail whenever a user edits the presentation.

83
 Chapter 4: Zoho Show: Lights, Camera, Action!
 
6. (Optional) Click the Edit Invitation Mail button to edit the e-mail mes-
sage sent to the people you want to invite.
 
7. Click the Share button to send invitations by e-mail to everyone you 
want to share the document with.
 
 The Share This Document dialog box displays the Zoho IDs of the people 
you invited.
 
8. Click the Close button to close the dialog box.
Showtime! Presenting 
Your Presentation
With your presentation all set, it’s time to show it to your audience. You can 
do that in person or remotely. Very cool.
Showing your presentation in person
To show your presentation in person, just open the presentation you want to 
show and follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Slideshow button and then select one of the following 
options:
 
• From Beginning: Start your slide show from the beginning.
 
• From Current Slide: Start your slide show from the current slide.
 
• Select Slide Number: Start your slide show from a selected slide.
 
 Show opens a new browser window, displaying your presentation, as 
you see in Figure 4-21.
 
2. To move from slide to slide in your presentation, click the arrows at 
the bottom of the screen.
 
 You can also enter the number of the slide you want to view in the text 
box at left on the bottom of the screen.
 
3. When you’re done, just close the browser window.
Note that you see only your slides in this window: no theme options, no over-
view of the slides, no toolbars — nothing like that. Presumably, your slide 
show is ready to go at this point, and all you want your audience to see are 
the slides.

84

You can also have your slides show themselves, moving to the next slide after 
a set number of seconds. To do that, click the More button (above the editing 
window), select the Slide Show Time item, enter the number of seconds you 
want between slides, and then click OK.
Controlling your presentation remotely
If you can’t get everyone together to view your presentation in the same 
room, you can present your presentation on the Web. Just follow these steps:
 
1. Open the presentation you want to display on the Web.
 
2. Click the Remote button and then choose Make Remote from the drop-
down menu that appears.
 
 The Play This Presentation Remotely dialog box opens.
 
3. Click the Make Remote & Continue button.
 
 The Remote URL dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 4-22.
 
 Show tells you the URL that participants will navigate to in this 
dialog box.

by commas.
 
5. (Optional) If you want to edit the invitation message, select the 
Invitation Message (optional) check box. In the text area that opens, 
enter your invitation message.
 
6. Click Start.
 
 Show opens a new browser window for the remote presentation.
 
You might want to e-mail the remote URL to your audience because relying on 
Show to invite them can sometimes take an hour or more.
Now you wait for your audience to show up. When they do, their names 
appear at the upper right of the window. When your audience is fully assem-
bled, you can start your presentation by clicking the Start Remote link in the 
middle of your window. The presentation starts, as shown in Figure 4-23.
Here are some tips for controlling your presentation:
 
✓ To navigate through the presentation: Use the arrow buttons at the top 
of the window.
 
✓ To show your notes for each slide: Click the Show Notes button at 
the top of the window. Remember that by default, they’ll be visible 
only to you.
 
✓ To show your presentation full-screen: Press F11.
 
✓ To chat with participants: Enter your text into the message box at the 
lower right and then press Enter. Your message, along with any answers, 
will appear in the chat area in the middle, on the right. See Figure 4-23.

and Storing Content

oho Notebook is a handy application with which you can collect and 
organize just about any content that you’d want to work with — the 
online equivalent of a scrapbook. You can paste text, Web pages, audio files, 
RSS, and more using Notebook.
Notebook is well suited for all kinds of uses. For business, you might main-
tain business-related clippings about your business or your clients. You can 
collect varying types of information about ongoing projects and keep such 
information well organized by project. You might even maintain a notebook 
of data on other companies (um, in case you have to find a new job).
Notebook also excels at personal use, of course. You can use it to store hun-
dreds of recipes in a notebook, store information about your favorite stars, 
or store information about a new big-ticket item, such as a car or even a 
house, so you can comparison-shop.
All of which is to say that Notebook is designed to be an organizer. The Web 
has billions of content items in hundreds of formats, and often it can seem a 
chaotic place. That’s where Notebook comes in — it’s a unique application 
that lets you get on top of hundreds of bits of information that might other-
wise be scattered.

Getting Started with Notebook
To sign in to Zoho Notebook, go to http://notebook.zoho.com, enter 
your username and password, and then click the Sign In button. (See 
Chapter 1 for details on creating a Zoho account.) Signing in brings up Zoho 
Notebook, as you can see in Figure 5-1. Notebooks are organized into pages, 
and your first blank page appears, as shown in Figure 5-1.

In the following sections, I give you the lowdown on some of the basic tasks 
you need to know to get started with Notebook: renaming and saving your 
notebook and adding new pages.
Renaming and saving your notebook
The default name for your first book, as you can see on the top tab in Figure 
5-1, is New Book 1 — not exactly the most descriptive title for a notebook on 
your Hawaii trip, for example.

89
 Chapter 5: Zoho Notebook: Organizing and Storing Content
To change the name of the current book, double-click the tab that reads New 
Book 1, which opens the Rename Book dialog box, as shown in Figure 5-2.
Enter the new name for the book — for example, The Hawaii Trip — and then 
click the Rename button. When you do, the dialog box disappears, and the 
book’s tab shows the new name.
 
When you change the name of a book, Notebook saves it automatically for you.
If you want to save your book manually, click the Save button on the toolbar 
and then select Save from the drop-down list that appears. Zoho Notebook 
saves your book immediately, using the name you gave it.

Growing your notebook: Adding pages
Most Zoho notebooks contain multiple pages, so take a look at how to add 
new pages. You can add these types of pages to a notebook:
 
✓ Blank
 
✓ Text
 
✓ Writer
 
✓ Sheet
 
✓ Web
The links for creating these pages are located in the upper left of Notebook:
 
✓ Blank page: To insert a new blank page, just click the Add Blank Page 
link at the top of the left-hand pane. Doing so inserts a new page into 
your notebook and opens that page.
 
 You keep pages separate and access the page you want with the tabs on 
the right of Notebook.

90
Part I: Working with Documents 
 
✓ Text page: A text page is just that — a page into which you can enter 
text. To add a new text page to your notebook, just click Add Text Page.
 
✓ Writer or Sheet page: You can easily add new pages that are made up of 
Writer (see Chapter 3) or Sheet (see Chapter 8) documents. This is differ-
ent from inserting Writer or Sheet documents as items in a page — this 
inserts a whole new page corresponding to a Writer or Sheet document.
 
 To insert a Writer or Sheet document as a new page, click Add Writer 
Page or Add Sheet Page, respectively. In the dialog box that opens, click 
either the New tab to create a new page or the Existing tab to import an 
existing page. Then click the Insert button.
 
✓ Web page: You can add whole Web pages as pages to your notebook. 
That’s a great idea in case you’re collecting, say, house listings, or online 
recipes, or doing some research on a medical procedure, or studying 
competing companies, and so on.
 
 To add a Web page to your notebook, click Add Web Page. In the 
dialog box that opens, enter the URL of the Web page to add as a new 
Notebook page. Then click the Create button.
 
 For example, you can see an online newspaper front page added as a 
Notebook page in Figure 5-3.
 
To delete a page, just open that page, click the Delete button on the toolbar, 
and then choose Page from the drop-down menu that appears.

 Chapter 5: Zoho Notebook: Organizing and Storing Content
Adding Stuff to Notebook
What good would a scrapbook be without the ability to add stuff to it? You 
can add all kinds of items to Zoho Notebook — images, text, video, and so on, 
and this section takes a look at that.
 
To access this functionality, you click the links in the left-hand pane of Notebook.
Adding text to a page
Say that you recently returned from a trip and want to produce a notebook 
about it for your co-workers. You might start by creating a title on the first 
page: The Hawaii Trip.
The simplest way to add text to a Notebook page is to click the Add Text link 
in the left-hand pane, opening the text box you see in Figure 5-4. Just click the 
text box to make a text cursor appear; then start typing your text.
 
Figure 5-4: 
Add text to a 
text box.
 
 
The text box in Figure 5-4 has an editing toolbar with buttons displaying the 
same icons that Writer does for text formatting (see Chapter 1). For example, 
to enlarge the text, select the text in the text box and click the Font Size icon 
(the icon with two Ts on it), opening a drop-down list box. Click the largest 
text size, which makes your text that size.
To position the text box where you want your text to appear in the page, just 
drag the text box by its title bar (the top bar in the text box). After the text 
box is where you want it, as shown in Figure 5-5, just click outside the text 
box. That causes the text box to disappear — but the text remains.

92
Part I: Working with Documents 
 
Figure 5-5: 
Positioning 
a text box.
 
 
When you drag the text box, the editing toolbar disappears. To get it back, just 
click the Edit button on the toolbar.
As I discuss in the preceding section, you can insert text into a Notebook 
page using a text box. But why do you have to go to all the trouble of using a 
text box? Why can’t you just type the text into the page directly?
The answer is that Notebook takes data in many formats, so text isn’t the default. 
You can draw shapes or lines, or drag images around a page, so it doesn’t make 
sense to have a text cursor automatically appear when you click a page. (For 
more on drawing shapes, see “Adding Shapes,” later in this chapter.)
However, there’s no denying that if you want to enter text into a Notebook page, 
it would be easier to simply click the page, have a text cursor appear (much as it 
would in Zoho Writer — see Chapter 1), and then just type your text.
In fact, you can make Notebook work in exactly that way. That is, you can put 
it into text mode so that clicking a page displays a blinking text cursor at the 
location of the click, and then you can just type your text. And it’ll even dis-
play a text toolbar at the top of the page.
To put Notebook into text mode, click the Text tool button. (It’s marked with 
a capital L, on the drawing shapes toolbar in the lower right of the window.) 
You know you’re in text mode when the text toolbar is at the top of the page 
and a text cursor is where the mouse cursor usually is.
To enter some text into the page, just click the page and start typing — it’s 
that simple.
 
To get back to the original page mode (and remove the text toolbar), click the 
Select tool button at right in Notebook.

93
 Chapter 5: Zoho Notebook: Organizing and Storing Content
Adding images
Zoho Notebook lets you add images to notebook pages, as you’d expect. To 
insert an image into a page, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Add Image button in the left-hand pane, opening the Add 
Image dialog box, as shown in Figure 5-6.
 
Figure 5-6: 
The Add 
Image 
dialog box.
 
 
 The Add Image dialog box is open to the Collection tab, which displays 
any images you’ve added to your Notebook collection.
 
2. Click the Upload tab.
 
 If you want to load an image from a URL instead of from your computer, 
click the From URL tab instead of the Upload tab, enter the URL of the 
image into the text box that appears, and then click the Insert button.
 
3. Click the Browse button, opening the Upload dialog box; navigate to 
and select the image you want to upload.
 
4. Click Open.
 
 The Upload dialog box closes and inserts the file path and name in the 
Upload text box.
 
5. Click the Insert button.
 
 Zoho uploads the image and inserts it into the notebook page in an 
image box, as you see in Figure 5-7.
Of course, you’re not limited to a single image. You can add as many as you 
like. After all, what’s a scrapbook without images?

94
Part I: Working with Documents 
 
Adding an image to a page also adds the image to your image collection, which 
makes it easy to insert the image into other pages.
 
Figure 5-7: 
A new 
image in an 
image box.
 
Adding video
Here’s one advantage Zoho Notebook has over traditional, paper notebooks —
you can add and play video clips. To get them into your notebook page, just 
follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Add Video button in the left-hand pane, opening the Add 
Video dialog box you see in Figure 5-8.
 
 Contrary to what you might expect, Zoho Show doesn’t let you upload 
videos in any format. In fact, it doesn’t let you truly upload videos at all. 
They have to be hosted elsewhere, such as on YouTube.
 
2. Get the video’s “embed” code.
 
 If you uploaded a video to a video-sharing site like YouTube, you need to 
get the embed code (that’s an HTML <object> tag, most commonly) that 
Notebook can use to display your video. YouTube and other sites display 
the embed code in the page with the video, so getting that code is usually 
not too difficult. The embed code for the Hawaii sample video is:
<object width=”425” height=”344”><param name=”movie” value=”http://
www.youtube.com/v/WmTaJQD6HzY&hl=en&fs=1”></param><param 
name=”allowFullScreen” value=”true”></param><param 
name=”allowscriptaccess” value=”always”></param><embed 
src=”http://www.youtube.com/v/WmTaJQD6HzY&hl=en&fs=1” 
type=”application/x-shockwave-flash” allowscriptaccess=”always” 
allowfullscreen=”true” width=”425” height=”344”></embed></
object>

 After you insert your video on the page, you can move or resize it, as 
described in the section “Arranging content on the page,” later in this 
chapter.

Adding audio files
Don’t have a video but have an MP3 audio file instead? You can add it to your 
book as well. For example, you might want to add a favorite podcast to your 
notebook.
To add an audio file to a notebook page, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Add Audio link at the left in Notebook.
 
 The Add Audio dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 5-10.
 
Figure 5-10:

2. Choose one of the following options, represented by the tabs in the 
Add Audio dialog box:
 
• From URL: If your audio file is on the Web, enter its URL here.
 
• Upload: If your audio file is on your computer, you can upload it 
from this tab.
 
• Collection: If you’ve already uploaded audio files, they’ll be here in 
the collection, waiting to be inserted again.
 
• Record: You can record audio files if you have the appropriate 
equipment (that is, a sound card and a microphone).
 
3. After you enter the URL or the file path and name, or select a file from 
the collection, or record a file, just click the Insert button.
 
 Notebook displays your audio file with the player shown in Figure 5-11.

Adding HTML
Don’t like the text styles available to you? Think you could do better than 
Notebook in picking background colors? Want to display page elements spe-
cific to a particular browser, like the Microsoft Internet Explorer <marquee> 
display element?
You’re in luck. You can insert your own HTML directly into a notebook page. 
To do that, just follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Add HTML link at the left in Notebook.
 
2. Enter your HTML in the Add HTML dialog box, as shown in 
Figure 5-12.
 
 In this example, I’m adding an HTML <h1> header.
 
Figure 5-12: 
The Add 
HTML 
dialog box.
 
 
3. Click the Insert button.
 
 Your HTML appears in a text box.
 
You can even add HTML controls, such as buttons and check boxes, to a page 
this way — and then add some JavaScript to make those controls active. For 
example, you might hide an image until a button is clicked.
Adding a URL
Another useful Notebook feature is the ability to clip other Web pages and 
embed them into your notebook. And you can have as many page clips 
in a notebook page as you want. That’s particularly useful if you’re doing 
research on the Internet because nothing brings a collection of URLs to life as 
much as actually seeing the pages they represent, all at once.

98
Part I: Working with Documents 
So if you’re doing research on cars, or trying to decide what computer to 
buy, or doing just about anything you can do on the Internet, keep this one in 
mind. You can create page clippings and embed them into a notebook page 
with ease.
Just follow these steps to add a URL to your notebook page:
 
1. Click the Add URL link at the left in Notebook.
 
2. Enter your URL in the Add URL dialog box that appears.
 
3. Click the Insert button.
 
 This opens the page referenced by your URL and displays the page in 
a box.
 
4. Size the box and drag it where you want the other page to be dis-
played in your notebook page.
 
5. Click outside the box to dismiss it.
Adding RSS feeds
RSS, also known as really simple syndication, has become more popular in 
recent years. RSS offers feeds from various sources, and if you connect to an RSS 
feed, you can see an often-updated list of articles from that source that you can 
check as often as you like. RSS presents you with a list of titles of new articles, 
and if you like one of those article titles, just click it to read the whole article.
Zoho Notebook can act as an RSS reader, letting you read RSS feeds — and 
it’s easy to implement. When you have RSS feeds coming into your page, you 
see a clickable list of articles from the RSS source.
To use RSS, you need an RSS source, and most news outlets publish their sto-
ries in RSS format these days. Just look for the orange RSS or XML button on 
a page and click it. Clicking the RSS or XML button will display either a URL 
for the RSS feed (which is what you want for Notebook) or an XML document. 
If you get an XML document, don’t try to paste that into Notebook — copy 
the URL from the browser’s address bar instead.
Armed with the URL for the RSS feed, you’re ready to start reading RSS using 
Notebook. Just follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Add RSS link.
 
2. Enter the RSS URL into the text box in the Add RSS dialog box.
 
3. Click the Insert button.
 
 This opens a box with the RSS feed that your URL references.

99
 Chapter 5: Zoho Notebook: Organizing and Storing Content
 
4. Size the box and drag it where you want RSS feed displayed in your 
notebook page.
 
5. Click outside the box to dismiss it.
For example, you can see an RSS feed in a Notebook page in Figure 5-13. Now 
you can open your notebook and take a look at the RSS feeds from various 
sources at a glance — very convenient indeed.

Zoho Notebook lets you embed all kinds of documents, just as you’d expect from 
a scrapbook. For example, what about that recipe in plain text format? No prob-
lem. Or that Zoho Sheet spreadsheet of your club’s expenses? No problem at all.
Embedding a non-Zoho document
Notebook allows you to insert your own files into your pages. It doesn’t dis-
play the contents of the file, even if it’s a type Notebook knows how to handle 
easily, such as an image file. It just displays a file icon with the name of the 
file. To open the file, you have to double-click it, and then your browser will 
offer to either download or open the file for you.
 
Embedding files like this is a good idea when you have file types that aren’t 
easily handled by browsers; for example, Microsoft Access documents (MBD 
documents) or Excel spreadsheets (XLS) that you want to embed.

100
Part I: Working with Documents 
To insert a file into Notebook, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Add File link.
 
2. Select one of the three tabs that indicate how you want to get your file:
 
• From URL: Enter the URL of the file.
 
• Upload: Enter the path and filename, or click the Browse button to 
browse to the file on your computer.
 
• Collection: Select a file that you have uploaded.
 
3. Click the Insert button.
 
 This opens a box that displays a file icon with the name of the file.
Adding a Zoho Sheet or Writer document
As you might expect, you can also embed Zoho Writer (see Chapter 2) or 
Sheet (see Chapter 8) documents in Notebook pages.
Embedding a Writer or Sheet document isn’t hard. Here’s what you do:
 
1. Click the Add Sheet or the Add Writer link.
 
2. Select one of the two tabs that indicates how you want to get 
your document:
 
• New: Create a new Writer or Sheet document.
 
• Existing: Select an existing Writer or Sheet document.
 
3. Click the Insert button.
 
 This opens a box that displays your document. For example, you can see 
a birthday invitation (Writer document) embedded in Zoho Notebook in 
Figure 5-14.
Adding a Show document
You can also add Zoho Show documents (see Chapter 4) to Zoho Notebook 
pages. That can be very useful if you have multiple Show presentations that 
you want to give to the same audience, because you can organize them into 
the same Notebook.

101
 Chapter 5: Zoho Notebook: Organizing and Storing Content
 
Figure 5-14:

Follow these steps to embed a Show document:
 
1. Click the Add Show link.
 
2. Select an existing slide show from the Add Show dialog box that 
appears.
 
3. Click the Insert button.
 
 This opens a box that displays your document.
Playing the presentation is similar to playing the presentation in Show. Just click 
the arrows at the bottom of the embedded Show document, or enter a slide 
number in the text box in the bottom left of the embedded Show document.
 
You can move forward from page to page in an embedded Show document by 
clicking the current slide.
Adding Shapes
You know how you can cut out shapes and add them to scrapbooks? You can 
add shapes to Notebook as well for all kinds of reasons — decorations, call-
outs, diagrams, speech bubbles, and more. You can create your own shapes 
or use the ones that come with Notebook.

102
Part I: Working with Documents 
Drawing shapes
Zoho Notebook contains a number of tools for drawing your own shapes, and 
these tools are
 
✓ Line
 
✓ Freehand
 
✓ Rectangle
 
✓ Circle (actually draws ellipses)
You can find these tools, shown in Figure 5-15, at the lower right of the Zoho 
Notebook window. Clicking one of these tools makes the corresponding tool-
bar appear at the top of the Notebook window.
 
Figure 5-15: 
Drawing 
tools in 
Notebook.
 
Select
Shapes
Circle
Rectangle
Freehand
Line

Hand
By default, the ellipses and rectangles you draw are filled in with Zoho’s pre-
ferred color — gold. You can change the fill color with the Fill Color button in 
the Circle and Rectangle tools’ toolbars (second button from the right).
Just click the Fill Color button, click a color from the color box that appears, 
and then click OK. This sets the fill color used for the current figure and any 
similar figures from then on (unless you happen to reset the color).
You can see the results of working with the Line, Freehand, Circle, and 
Rectangle tools in the abstract art example shown in Figure 5-16.
 
Because you can draw all over a Notebook page, the drawing tools are great 
for connecting embedded items or annotating them.

103
 Chapter 5: Zoho Notebook: Organizing and Storing Content

Copying, pasting, and deleting shapes
It’s often the case that you need to copy a shape. You can draw two of the 
same shape, but that can mean sizing them exactly the same, which can be a 
little iffy if you’re just using the mouse.
To copy a shape and paste it, just follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Select tool button at the lower right in Notebook. (Refer to 
Figure 5-15.)
 
2. Right-click the shape you want to copy and then choose Copy from the 
menu that appears.
 
3. Right-click the page, away from any shape.
 
4. Choose the Paste menu item to paste a copy of the shape.
 
 The newly pasted shape appears in a box with sizing handles around it.
 
5. Drag the newly pasted shape where you want it.
 
To delete a shape, click the Select tool. Right-click the shape you want to 
delete, and then choose Delete from the menu that appears.

104
Part I: Working with Documents 
Inserting shapes
Like Zoho Show, you can insert a variety of shapes into Zoho Notebook docu-
ments. There aren’t nearly as many shapes available in Notebook as there are 
in Show, but you still have plenty of shapes to work with. You can access the 
shapes with the Shape tool at the lower right in Notebook. Clicking the Shape 
tool displays a menu of shapes, as shown in Figure 5-17.
 
Figure 5-17: 
Notebook 
shapes.
 
When you click the Shape tool, the Shape toolbar appears at the top of the 
Notebook window. You can use this toolbar to customize the shapes you 
draw, setting the stroke width (used to draw the edges of the shape) and the 
fill color as well as selecting what shape you want to draw. Here are some 
popular shapes:
 
✓ Callouts: These are the speech balloons that you use to add a speech or 
an annotation to Notebook content. You can use callouts in conjunction 
with text in Notebook to create annotations.
 
✓ Arrows: This popular shape is great for connecting items in a page to 
show a relationship or logical flow. You can see an example in Figure 5-18.
 
Figure 5-18:
 Using 
arrows in 
Notebook.
 
 
✓ Flowcharts: Put arrows with flowchart shapes to create flowcharts, 
which are useful to show the logical flow of a procedure. The Shapes 
menu includes many flowchart shapes that you can arrange on a page.

105
 Chapter 5: Zoho Notebook: Organizing and Storing Content
Editing shapes
By default, arrows in Notebook point up, not down. However, you can change 
how shapes are drawn by using the Drawing toolbar, which appears when 
you click the Shapes tool. For example, say you want to draw down-pointing 
arrows instead of up-pointing arrows. Use the Flip Type button on the 
Drawing toolbar, as shown in Figure 5-19.
 
Figure 5-19: 
The Flip 
Type button.
 
Flip Type button
To draw a down-pointing arrow, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Shapes tool button. (Refer to Figure 5-15.)
 
2. Select the up-pointing arrow.
 
3. Click the Flip Type button on the Drawing toolbar that appears at the 
top of the page.
 
4. Choose the Flip Vertical item from the Flip Type drop-down menu.
 
5. Draw the down-pointing arrow by dragging the mouse.
 
 You can see the resulting arrow in Figure 5-20.

Part I: Working with Documents 
Finessing Content: Arranging, Fixing, 
Freeing, and Stacking
As you might expect, you can arrange your content in all kinds of ways in 
Notebook, just as in any scrapbook. This section takes a look at your options 
for arranging content.
Arranging content on the page
After you add content to your page, you can rearrange it to your liking by 
moving and resizing it:
 
✓ Move content. Drag the box to the location where you want to display 
the image in the notebook page.
 
✓ Resize content. Move the mouse over the lower-right corner of the box 
until the mouse cursor turns into a double-headed diagonal arrow. Click 
the mouse, and resize the content as you like it.
After you position the content where you want it, click outside the image box 
to remove the image box but leave the content. This positions and sizes your 
content as you want it in the notebook page.
Fixing and unfixing content
Having gone to a lot of trouble to arrange the content on a Notebook page, 
you probably want to make sure it’s not moved inadvertently.
 
In Notebook, you can move content simply by clicking and dragging it — and 
in pages dense with content, it’s easy to click the wrong item. But you can fix 
content in place easily with Notebook by pinning it. And it can’t be moved 
until it’s unpinned.
To pin content, just follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Select tool button at the lower right in Notebook.
 
2. Right-click the content you want to pin in place.
 
3. Choose Pin from the menu that appears.
 
 To unpin content, choose the Unpin menu item.

107
 Chapter 5: Zoho Notebook: Organizing and Storing Content
Stacking content
Notebook pages can get kind of crowded with items, which you might find 
yourself stacking one on top of the other. Sometimes, admittedly, stacking 
is intentional, like when you create a complex figure (such as a drawing of a 
house) from a number of simpler shapes.
You can use Notebook to set the stacking order of items on a page. When you 
right-click an item, you see the following four menu items in the menu that 
appears, as shown in Figure 5-21, and you can use them to set stacking order:
 
✓ Send Backward
 
✓ Bring Forward
 
✓ Send to Back
 
✓ Bring to Front
For example, take a look at the three rectangles in Figure 5-21, where they are 
stacked atop each other.
 
Figure 5-21: 
Three 
stacked 
rectangles.
 
Send Backward
Bring Forward
Send to Back
Bring to Front
Now say that you want to bring the bottom rectangle to the front — that is, 
stack it on top of the other two rectangles. Just follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Select tool button at the lower right in Notebook (the button 
with an arrow showing).
 
2. Right-click the bottom shape.
 
3. Choose Bring to Front.

108
Part I: Working with Documents 
And that’s it. Now the bottom rectangle is on top, as you can see in Figure 5-22.
 
Figure 5-22: 
Restacked 
rectangles.
 
If you just want to bring the back rectangle forward one step — so it is still 
stacked under the top rectangle — you would follow the preceding steps but 
choose Bring Forward in Step 3.
Deleting content
Deleting content on a page is simple — just select the content and click Delete.
Clipping on the Web (For 
Firefox Users Only)
You can add snapshots of whole Web pages, or sections of them, to your 
notebook if you have the Firefox browser and use the Zoho Notebook Helper, 
which is a plugin for the Firefox browser only.
To install the Zoho Notebook Helper plugin in Firefox, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Firefox plugin link at the top of the Notebook window, open-
ing the Firefox add-ons in a new Firefox tab.
 
2. Click the Add to Firefox button.
 
3. Click the Install Now button in the Software Installation dialog box 
that opens.
 
4. In the Add-ons dialog box that opens, click the Restart Firefox button 
to restart Firefox.

109
 Chapter 5: Zoho Notebook: Organizing and Storing Content
 
5. Click the Restart button in the Restart Firefox dialog box that opens.
 
6. Close the Add-ons dialog box.
With the Zoho Helper plugin installed, you can snap (take a snapshot of) a 
Web page and add it to your notebook, as described in the following sections.
 
This procedure takes a snapshot of the Web page — that is, an image — but it 
doesn’t preserve the Web page and all the links in it.
Snapping a whole Web page
To snap a whole Web page with the Zoho Notebook Helper plugin, follow 
these steps:
 
1. In Notebook, open the page to which you want to add the snapshot.
 
 You must have Zoho Notebook open to the page you want to add the 
snapshot to use Zoho Notebook Helper.
 
2. In Firefox, choose File➪New Tab and then navigate to the Web page 
you want to work with.
 
3. Right-click the Web page and choose Snap Page to Zoho Notebook.
 
4. Enter a name for the new page in the dialog box that opens and then 
click OK.
Snapping part of a Web page
You can also record just a region of a Web page as well, instead of the whole 
thing. To take a snapshot of just a region of a Web page, follow these steps:
 
1. Follow Steps 1 and 2 in the preceding section.
 
2. Right-click the Web page and choose Snap Region to Zoho Notebook.
 
3. Resize and move the shaded window that appears to the region you 
want to snap.
 
4. Click the camera icon at the upper right in the shaded window to snap 
the region.
 
5. Enter a name for the new page in the dialog box that opens and then 
click OK.

Getting Others Involved: 
Sharing a Notebook
You can also share notebooks with other users, as you can in other Zoho 
applications. To share a notebook, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Share button on the Notebook toolbar.
 
2. Choose the item you want to share (Book, Page, or Object) from the 
drop-down menu that appears.
 
 This opens the dialog box you see in Figure 5-23.
 
Figure 5-23:

dialog box.
 
 
3. Fill in the following options:
 
• User Name/E-Mail Separated by Comma: Enter the usernames or 
e-mail addresses of the people you want to share with, separated 
with commas.
 
• Read-Only or Read/Write: Click the appropriate button to indicate 
the type of permission you want to give the people you’re sharing 
the notebook with.
 
• Add Custom Message: Select this check box to add a custom message.
 
4. Click the Share button and then click Done.

111
 Chapter 5: Zoho Notebook: Organizing and Storing Content
When users with read/write privileges share with you, you get a notification 
with a small dialog box that appears at the lower right in Notebook. They can 
make changes to your notebook items just as you can.
 
You can access any items shared with you by clicking the Shared tab at the 
lower left in Notebook.

In this part . . .
I
n this part, I take a look at the scheduling and communi-
cating applications available in Zoho.
Zoho Planner is your online organizer. Use this app to 
keep track of appointments, addresses, meetings — just 
about anything you need to manage your busy life.
Zoho Mail is a powerful online mail application that gives 
you all you’d expect: handling, sending, receiving, and for-
warding e-mail; working with attachments — and some 
extras you might not expect.

U
se Zoho Planner to help keep you on track by creating lists of items 
that you want to get done. These lists can contain anything you want, 
from steps for planning a product launch to lists of groceries to pick up.
Zoho Planner is for people who want to take their lists online. If you’re tired 
of dozens of scraps of paper floating around, now you can collect your lists 
in one place. It’s a natural for people who use Zoho a lot because they’re 
already on the site, and switching to Zoho Planner is simple.
You can also share a planner, of course. That means you can make multiper-
son lists — say, when you’re planning some company-wide event, such as a 
shareholder’s meeting, and are trying to line up speakers.
And you can also ask Planner to remind you through e-mail of upcoming items 
on your list so you don’t even have to sign in to Planner to keep up to date.

116
Part II: Scheduling and Communicating 
Starting Planner
To sign in to Zoho Planner, go to http://planner.zoho.com. The signing-
in process is the same as for any Zoho application: Enter your username and 
password, and then click the Sign In button. (To get a Zoho username and 
password, see Chapter 1.)
Signing in to Planner brings up the Planner Home Page, as shown in Figure 6-1.
 
Figure 6-1: 
The Zoho 
Planner 
Home Page.
 
Click to start a list
Zoho Planner shares a lot in common with other Zoho applications. Note the 
bar of links at the upper right; these are the same links you find in any Zoho 
application. Use these links to view your account, make preference settings, 
switch to other Zoho apps, and more.
A central workspace contains your lists (currently labeled Home Page), and 
the left pane displays shared pages and reminders, and more.
Creating a To-Do List
The base task in Planner is creating to-do lists. Say you’re in charge of a prod-
uct launch for your company, and you want to add items to your Product 
Launch to-do list. Here’s how to start a to-do list:

117
 Chapter 6: Zoho Planner: Organizing Your Life
 
1. On the Home Page of Planner, click the To-Dos link, opening the 
dialog box shown in Figure 6-2.
 
2. Enter a name for the new list.
 
3. Click the Add List button.
 
Figure 6-2: 
Start a to-do 
list here.
 
New list name
 
4. In the page that opens, enter the first item in your list in the To-Do 
Description field.
 
5. Click the Add List Item button.
 
 Planner adds the first item to the list, as shown in Figure 6-3, and keeps 
open the To-Do Description field to accept a new list item.
 
6. Keep building your list, repeating Steps 4–5.
 
7. When you’re finished, click the Close link, closing the To-Do 
Description field and completing your list, as shown in Figure 6-4.
 
List items appear in the order you enter them.

119
 Chapter 6: Zoho Planner: Organizing Your Life
To add additional lists, click Add List. Then just repeat the preceding steps. 
In a nutshell, you open a new list, give it a name, populate it, and save it. See 
Figure 6-5.
And, Planner lets you collect all your lists and make them accessible from a 
single location — the Planner Home Page.
 
With multiple lists, things can get a little crowded on your Planner Home Page, 
but you can fix that by collapsing a list. (See Figure 6-5.) To collapse a list, 
just click the down arrow in front of the list, and the list collapses to just one 
line, showing the list’s name. To open the list again, just click the same arrow 
(which toggles to a right arrow).
 
Figure 6-5: 
Add as 
many lists 
as you want.

Click to collapse the list.
Amending a To-Do List
Lists are meant to be helpful tools. Nothing spells progress like checking 
off completed items. And, what good is a list if you can’t edit it to update it? 
Here’s how to keep a to-do list current.

120
Part II: Scheduling and Communicating 
Checking items off a list
Of course, the goal of a to-do list is to complete the tasks on the list. Planner 
can keep track of which tasks you have completed and which ones are still to 
come.
After the first task is completed, it’s time to check it off your list. To check an 
item off a list, click the to-do list’s name in the left-hand pane of the Planner 
Home Page. Then, select the check box for the to-do item. Easy.
The selected list item is moved to the Completed section at the bottom of the 
list, as you see in Figure 6-6.
 
Figure 6-6: 
Mark a list 
item as 
completed.
 
Click to reorder the list.
Completed item
Click to hide completed items.
 
To hide the completed items in your list, click the red X to the right 
of Completed.
Suppose, though, that you need to take an item off the completed part of the 
list and move it back to the to-do list. That seems easy enough: Just deselect 
the completed item’s check box in the Completed list. However, when you 
do, Planner doesn’t remember where in your list the item first appeared, so it 
puts the item you moved from the Completed list at the bottom of the to-do 
list. Keep reading to see how to put your list back in the order you want.

121
 Chapter 6: Zoho Planner: Organizing Your Life
Reordering a to-do list
If you need to reorder a list — such as moving the bottom list item to the 
top — just follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Reorder link at the bottom of the list.
 
2. Move the mouse over the item you want to move until the mouse 
cursor changes to a cross-shaped, four-headed arrow.
 
3. Drag the list item to its new location in the list.
 
4. Click the Save Order link at the bottom of the list.
Adding a new list item
Say you need to add a new item at the end of the list. Easily done. Just follow 
these steps:
 
1. Click the Add List Item link at the bottom of a list.
 
2. Enter the new list item in the To-Do Description field.
 
 Figure 6-7 shows an example.
 
Figure 6-7: 
Add a new 
list item.

122
Part II: Scheduling and Communicating 
 
3. Click the Add List Item button.
 
4. Click the Close link.
 
 The new list item is added to the end of the list.
If you now need to reorder the list, see the preceding section, “Reordering a 
to-do list.”
Editing and deleting a list item
Say that you need to change an item in your list. To edit a list item, just follow 
these steps:
 
1. Let the mouse cursor rest over the item you want to edit.
 
 A pencil icon and an X icon appear at the end of the item.
 
2. Click the pencil icon to open the Edit dialog box.
 
3. Enter the new description — that is, text for the list item — in the 
Description field.
 
4. Click the Save List Item button.
 
 The new version of the list item is written to the list, replacing the old 
version of the item.
You can also delete list items as well. Deleting items from a list is simple. Just 
follow the steps for editing a list item. However, click the X button at the end 
of the list item. (See Step 1.) Then, click OK in the dialog box that opens.
Setting Due Dates for List Items
To help stay organized, you can not only order your to-do lists, but also 
set due dates for list items: that is, dates by when list items have to be com-
pleted. Follow these steps to place a due date on a list item:
 
1. Hover the mouse over the list item you want to add a due date to, 
making the pencil and red X icons appear.
 
2. Click the pencil icon, opening the list item for editing.
 
3. Click the box next to the text box for the Due Date, opening a calen-
dar control.
 
4. Click the date you want to set as the due date for the list item.
 
 See Figure 6-8.

Setting Reminders
Hmm. Yup, you can display a due date for a list item, but maybe you don’t 
want to open Zoho Planner every day to check on your lists. It would be great 
if you could have Planner to tell you about upcoming due dates.

124
Part II: Scheduling and Communicating 
Lucky for you, telling Planner to remind you of an upcoming due date is 
simple. Here’s how:
 
1. Hover the mouse over the list item you want to add a reminder to, 
making the pencil and red X icons appear.
 
2. Click the pencil icon, opening the list item for editing.
 
3. Open the Remind Me drop-down list box, presenting the list shown in 
Figure 6-10.
 
 You can set the due date
 
• One day before
 
• On the same day
 
• When the due date expires (on expiry)
 
• Every day between now and the due date
 
4. Choose the reminder type you want.
 
5. Click the Save List Item button.
 
 Planner will remind you of upcoming due dates, e-mailing you automatically.
 
Figure 6-10:
 Set a 
reminder 
here.
 
 
Zoho Planner doesn’t offer very flexible reminder timeframes. For example, 
there is no “three days before” or “five days before” option. If you want to 
be reminded of a due date more than one day in advance, you have no other 
option than to be reminded daily between now and the due date.

125
 Chapter 6: Zoho Planner: Organizing Your Life
Scheduling Appointments
Besides to-do lists, Planner can keep track of your appointments. Consider 
listing your appointments in Planner because it’s accessible from any place 
you have an Internet connection. Planner can also automatically schedule 
recurring appointments for you.
Setting your time zone
Here’s one thing to keep in mind, especially if you ask Planner to keep you 
reminded of an appointment: The default Planner time zone might not be the 
same as yours.
The default time zone for Planner is America/Los_Angeles. To change that, 
follow these steps:
 
1. In the left pane, look for Time Zone Setting. Beneath that is the 
default: America/Los_Angeles. Click that link.
 
 The Time Zone Setting dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 6-11.
 
Figure 6-11: 
Set a new 
time zone.
 
 
2. Select your time zone from the drop-down list.
 
3. Click the Save Time Zone button.
 
 Your new time zone appears under the Current Time Zone title on the 
Planner Home Page.

Then click the Home Page link.
Creating your first appointment
Here’s how to schedule your first appointment in Zoho Planner. (To see how 
to add additional appointments, see the upcoming section, “Adding more 
appointments.”)
 
1. On the Home Page, click the Appointments link, opening the dialog 
box shown in Figure 6-12.
 
2. Enter the new appointment in the Appointments field.
 
3. To set the date for the new appointment, click the calendar control to 
the right of the Scheduled On field.
 
4. Click the appointment’s date in the calendar.
 
5. Set the time for the appointment, using the three drop-down lists 
(hour, minutes [in 5-minute intervals], and a.m. or p.m.) next to the 
Scheduled On field.
 
6. (Optional) Select a reminder time, using choices from the Remind Me 
drop-down list. Your choices range from the time of the appointment 
to one day in advance.

Sometimes, certain appointments need to be scheduled over and over: a 
weekly meeting, for example. Planner lets you handle this kind of task easily. 
To make an appointment a recurring one, follow these steps:
 
1. Hover the mouse over the appointment you want to make recurring 
until the pencil and red X icons appear at the right.
 
2. Click the pencil icon to open the appointment for editing, as shown in 
Figure 6-14.
 
Figure 6-14:

appoint-
ment.

Part II: Scheduling and Communicating 
 
3. Open the Repeat drop-down list box to reveal your “how often?” 
choices. You can choose from a number of set hours, every day, every 
week, every month, or every year.
 
4. Click the Update Appointment button.
When you make an appointment a recurring appointment, Planner displays 
a small icon — two arrows in a circle, chasing each other’s tail, like a refresh 
button in a browser — to indicate that the appointment recurs.
 
If you set up a reminder for a recurring appointment, Zoho sends that 
reminder via e-mail each time the appointment recurs.
Adding more appointments
When you first click the Appointments link (to create your first appoint-
ment), Planner opens its Appointment field as well as controls with which 
you create that appointment. After you create this first appointment, though, 
those controls don’t appear automatically. To add new appointments, just 
follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Appointments link, opening the Appointments section of the 
Planner Home Page.
 
2. Click the Add Appointment link in the Appointments section (which 
displays your existing appointments) to open the dialog box shown in 
Figure 6-15.

3. Fill in the name of the new appointment, set its time, and so on.
 
4. Click the Add Appointment button.
 
 The new appointment appears directly beneath any existing appointments.
Editing and deleting appointments
To edit the details of an existing appointment, just follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Appointments link to open the Appointments section of the 
Planner Home Page.
 
2. Hover the mouse over the appointment whose details you want to edit 
until the pencil and red X icons appear to the right of the appointment 
name.
 
3. Click the pencil icon to open the appointment for editing.
 
 The Add Appointment button (see the preceding section) toggles to 
Update Appointment.
 
4. Edit the appointment’s details.
 
5. Click the Update Appointment button.
To delete an existing appointment, hover the mouse over the appointment, 
click the X, and click Yes in the dialog box that appears.
Recording More Details 
with Planner Notes
Just like with any good planner, there’s a space for notes in Zoho Planner. 
Notes are just what they sound like. They’re written text — not appointments 
or to-do items. You cannot add timers/reminders to notes.
You might suddenly be struck with inspiration on that business idea you 
were trying to crack, or think of something you want to suggest for your 
daughter’s application letters to college, or any of a million other things.
Here’s how to add a note to Zoho Planner:
 
1. On the Home Page, click the Notes link, opening the dialog box shown 
in Figure 6-16.

2. Enter the title of the new note in the Title field.
 
3. Enter the text of the new note in the Body field.
 
4. Click the Add Note button.
 
 The new note appears on the Home Page; see Figure 6-17.
 
Figure 6-17:

Here are some additional ways to work with Planner notes:
 
✓ To add another note: Click the Add Note link in the Notes section of the 
Home Page (the section where your notes appear), fill in the title and 
body of the new note, and then click the Add Note button.
 
✓ To edit a note: Hover the mouse over the title of a note until the pencil 
and red X icons appear. Click the pencil icon, make your edits when the 
title and body text boxes appear, and then click the Save Note button.
 
✓ To delete a note: Hover the mouse to make the icons appear, but click 
the red X icon instead. Then click OK in the confirmation dialog box 
that appears.

 Chapter 6: Zoho Planner: Organizing Your Life
Adding Attachments
Zoho Planner has another advantage over paper planners: the capability to 
handle attachments. Paper planners can’t upload files, but Zoho Planner can.
Uploading an attachment
Say, for example, that you have a very important memo that you want to keep 
track of, and you want to upload it to your planner. Not a problem.
Uploading an attachment starts by clicking the Attachments link in Planner, 
which opens the controls you see in Figure 6-18. You can upload any file type 
that your browser allows.
Then do the following to upload an attachment:
 
1. Click the Browse button, opening the File Upload dialog box.
 
2. Select the file you want to upload.
 
3. Click the Open button.
 
 The File Upload dialog box closes.
 
4. (Optional) Enter a description in the Description field, as shown in 
Figure 6-18.
 
Figure 6-18: 
Adding an 
attachment.
 

132
Part II: Scheduling and Communicating 
 
5. Click the Upload Attachment button.
 
 The attachment is uploaded and displayed as an icon, as shown in 
Figure 6-19.
 
Figure 6-19: 
A new 
attachment.
 Click to open the attachment.
Opening an attachment
To open an attachment, just click its link (which is visible in Figure 6-19). 
That’s all you have to do, and your browser does the rest.
When you click the link:
 
✓ Internet Explorer opens the attachment in a new window.
 
✓ Firefox opens the attachment in a new tab.
 
If the attachment is of a type that your browser doesn’t know how to handle, it 
asks you whether you want to download the attachment.
Adding more attachments
When you first click the Attachments link, the Attachments section opens 
and displays the Browse button and the Description box (refer to Figure 
6-18). Here’s how to get those controls back again when you want to upload 
another attachment. Just follow the preceding steps, but click the Add 

133
 Chapter 6: Zoho Planner: Organizing Your Life
Attachment button in the Attachments section. The Attachments upload con-
trols (the Browse button and the description box) appear. Then proceed with 
browsing and uploading.
 
There is no limit to the number of attachments you can upload.
Deleting an attachment
You probably don’t want all your attachments to hang around forever. For 
example, if an attachment concerns an upcoming meeting or event that’s 
over, here’s how to do a little housekeeping and get rid of the attachment:
 
1. Scroll down the Planner Home Page until you come to the 
Attachments section that holds your attachments.
 
2. Hover the mouse over the icon of the attachment you want to delete, 
or over the link to the attachment (right next to the icon).
 
3. Click the red X that appears.
 
4. In the confirmation dialog box that opens, asking whether you really 
want to delete the attachment, click OK.
 
 And that gets rid of your attachment.
 
After you delete an attachment, it’s deleted on the Zoho site, and there’s no 
way to get it back again using only Planner. If you want to restore the attach-
ment, you have to upload it again, so delete with care.
Creating a New Page
After you add lists, appointments, notes, and attachments, your Planner 
Home Page will start to look a little crowded. To keep things tidy, add more 
pages to your planner. Here’s how:
 
1. Click the Create New Page button at the upper left of Zoho Planner.
 
2. Enter the name of your new page in the Name Your New Page text box 
that appears, as shown in Figure 6-20.
 
 For example, name it for a new project you want to keep track of or for 
the person whose information will be contained in it.

134
Part II: Scheduling and Communicating 
 
Figure 6-20: 
Create a 
new page.
 
 
3. Click the Create button.
 
 The new page is created and added to your My Pages list at the left in 
Planner, and Planner opens your new page, as shown in Figure 6-21.
 
 Your new page is all fresh and clean, ready for lists and appointments.
 
Figure 6-21: 
A new page.
 
New page
Move between pages in Planner by opening the My Pages section in the left 
pane (open by default) and clicking the name of the page you want to open.
Even More Organization: Adding 
Tags to Planner Items
Say you create pages to help keep Planner organized. If it’s hard to remember 
just what page to jump to — after all, is that to-do list you’re looking for on 
the Eastern Division page or the Urgent page? — Planner comes to the rescue 
by giving you an additional layer of organization. You can tag pages and then 
search for pages by using tags.

135
 Chapter 6: Zoho Planner: Organizing Your Life
One way to make sure you stay on top of your planner’s organization is to 
use tags. Like with other Zoho applications, tags are words or phrases that 
you connect with your data to make that data easily searchable.
Adding a tag to a page
To use tags, just follow these steps:
 
1. Open the Planner page you want to add a tag to.
 
2. Click the Tags link at the top of the page.
 
 The Tags section of the page appears. A text box for the new tag opens, 
as shown in Figure 6-22.
 
Figure 6-22: 
Creating a 
tag for 
a page.
 
 
3. Enter the text of your new tag or tags.
 
4. Click the Save Tags button.
 
 The text box closes; the tag you added to the page shows up (in this 
case, two tags, Product and Launch, because Planner treats each word 
as a separate tag) in the Tags section, as shown in Figure 6-23.
 
Figure 6-23: 
New tags.
 
New tags

136
Part II: Scheduling and Communicating 
To add more tags, repeat the preceding steps but click the Add Tags link at 
the top of the Tags section, which opens the text box for a new tag. Add the 
name of the tag, and then click the Save Tags button. Using this technique, 
you can add as many tags as you want.
Searching for a page with tags
To search for all pages with a particular tag, just go to the Tags section of a 
page: All tags appear as hyperlinks in that section. To see a list of all pages 
with a particular tag, just click that tag.
A list of pages with that tag opens, as shown in Figure 6-24. To open one of 
those pages, just click the name of the page (which is a link to that page).
 
Figure 6-24: 
See pages 
with the 
same tag.
 
Sharing Planner Pages
Like with other Zoho applications, you can share Planner pages with others, 
which is handy if you’re trying to schedule a meeting that involves several 
people. The folks you share pages with can modify appointment times, or add 
items to to-do lists, freeing you from having to do all the work yourself.
Inviting someone to share a page
To share a Planner page with someone, just follow these steps:
 
1. Open the page you want to share.
 
2. Click the Page Sharing link at the upper right of the page, opening the 
sharing section shown in Figure 6-25.
 
3. In the Private Sharing section, enter the e-mail address of the person 
with whom you wish to share the page. Here is where you also set per-
missions for that person; choose whether to enter the address in the 
Read Only or Read/Write field.

137
 Chapter 6: Zoho Planner: Organizing Your Life
 
Figure 6-25: 
Sharing 
a page.
 
 
4. Click the Share button.
 
5. Click the Close link to close the Sharing section.
 
 That sends an e-mail invitation to the person you want to share your 
page with, and the person can click the hyperlink in the e-mail to open 
your page.
When someone shares your page
People you invite can share your page by clicking the link sent to them in 
your e-mail invitation (see the preceding section) or by clicking the name of 
your page in their Pages Shared To Me section in the left pane of Planner.
When someone shares your page, her Zoho username appears at the left in 
your version of Planner, as shown in Figure 6-26, in the Shared User’s Chat 
section.
 
If you gave a user read/write privileges and he makes a change to your page, 
you won’t see anything special except the new text the user adds. The portion 
of your page that person is editing doesn’t turn yellow, like it does with Zoho 
Writer. (Read about Writer in Chapters 2 and 3.)
 
There’s no special indication that your page is being edited by someone else. 
Items just appear and disappear.

You can also chat with people sharing your page. Just click the person’s name 
in the list of people sharing your page under the Shared Users Chat title.
Clicking a person’s name opens a chat box, as shown in Figure 6-27. Enter 
your comment into the text box in the chat box and then press Enter to make 
your comments appear in the other person’s chat box.
That person can reply, using the same method.

▶ Handling attachments
W
hat would an online suite of applications be without e-mail? Zoho is 
up to the challenge here with Zoho Mail, a powerful e-mail program 
that gives you all you’d expect, including the ability to
 
✓ Create, send, and receive e-mail
 
✓ Handle attachments
 
✓ Mark e-mail as spam
 
✓ Organize your e-mail with folders and labels
 
✓ Maintain a list of contacts
 
✓ Search your e-mail en masse
All this is available for free; all you need is your Internet connection 
and a browser.
Getting Started with Zoho Mail
Here’s some good news: If you have a Zoho username and password (see 
Chapter 1), you already have a Zoho Mail account. And your e-mail account is 
username@zoho.com, where username is your username. It’s that simple — 
Zoho Mail has already been set up and is waiting for you.

Composing Your Zoho E-Mails
Start with one of the most common tasks in Zoho Mail — composing an 
e-mail. After logging in to Zoho Mail, you’re ready to start writing your 
own e-mails.
To compose an e-mail, just follow these steps. Some of this is familiar from 
other e-mail programs, so I cover common tasks, like cc’ing recipients, rela-
tively quickly:
 
1. Click the Compose button on the toolbar.
 
 A dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 7-2.
 
Figure 7-2: 
Composing 
an e-mail in 
Zoho Mail.
 
Spellcheck
Ask Receipt
 
2. Enter the e-mail address of the recipient in the To field.
 
 If you have more than one recipient, separate the e-mail addresses
with commas.
 
3. (Optional) To send a copy of the e-mail to someone, enter that 
person’s e-mail address in the Cc box.
 
 If you have multiple recipients, separate their e-mail addresses 
with commas.

142
Part II: Scheduling and Communicating 
 
4. (Optional) If you want to blind carbon copy (bcc) someone (that 
is, send a copy of the e-mail to someone without letting the other 
recipients know), click the Add Bcc link. Then in the Bcc field (which 
appears below the Cc box), enter the e-mail addresses of anyone you 
want to bcc.
 
 Again, if you have multiple recipients here, separate their e-mail 
addresses with commas.
 
5. Enter the subject of the e-mail in the Subject field.
 
6. Enter the text of the e-mail in the large text box at the bottom of the 
dialog box.
 
 You can use the toolbar buttons in the dialog box to add bold or italics, 
set font size, add links, insert tables, and so on, just as you can in Zoho 
Writer (see Chapters 2 and 3).
 
7. (Optional) Spellcheck your message by clicking the Spell Check button 
on the toolbar, shown in Figure 7-2.
 
 Zoho Mail runs a spellcheck on your e-mail’s text and highlights all the 
words it doesn’t know with a yellow background and red foreground text.
 
8. Click Send to send the e-mail and close the dialog box.
And that’s it. You sent your first Zoho e-mail. Nice.
 
By default, the e-mail you compose is in HTML, which lets you see images and 
headers, as in a browser. You can alternate between creating HTML e-mails 
and plain-text e-mails by clicking the HTML Editor button at the extreme right 
when you’re composing your e-mails.
There are a couple more options when it comes to sending e-mail that I take a 
look at in this chapter, such as working with attachments and address books. 
For now, though, I focus on a few other options: getting a return receipt 
for your e-mails when your recipient gets them, setting a priority level, and 
adding a signature. Additionally, you find out how to keep track of the e-mail 
you’ve sent with the Sent folder.
 
Not quite ready to send your e-mail? Click the Save Draft button that appears 
in the Compose window to save your e-mail. Saved drafts appear in the Draft 
folder in the left-hand pane.
Getting return receipts for your e-mails
You can request a receipt when someone receives your e-mail. It’s something 
like sending a letter registered return receipt — you get notification of the 
delivery. That’s handy to make sure that the person you’re writing to actually 
got what you wrote.

143
 Chapter 7: Zoho Mail: Your Communication Center
You can request a delivery receipt with a single click. When you’re compos-
ing the e-mail, just select the Ask Receipt check box (visible at the upper 
right in Figure 7-2).
Doing so means that the recipients are asked to confirm they got your e-mail 
(usually with a dialog box displayed by their e-mail program). If they click 
Yes or OK (depending on their e-mail program), you get a return e-mail that 
indicates your e-mail was delivered (the actual text of the return e-mail will 
differ by e-mail program). Having the recipient click OK or Yes is something 
like asking them to sign for a registered letter.
 
Note, however, that unlike with a real registered letter, they don’t have to 
agree to send you a confirmation in order to get the e-mail. The recipient 
doesn’t have to click OK or Yes (which means you get a receipt) to read your 
e-mail, so you can’t count on getting such a receipt, even if your e-mail has 
been received.
Setting a priority level
You can also set the priority level of your outgoing e-mails. After all, some 
e-mails can wait, but others carry some urgency. To assign a priority level 
when you’re composing an e-mail, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the down arrow next to the More Options button in the Compose 
dialog box.
 
2. Click the arrow next to the Medium menu item.
 
 New e-mails are set to Medium priority by default.
 
3. In the new pop-up menu that appears, choose the priority level you 
want, from Highest to Lowest.
 
 If your recipient’s e-mail program displays priority, a flag matching the pri-
ority you set for the e-mail displays in his Inbox when he gets your e-mail.
Personalizing your e-mail: 
Adding a signature
You personalize the paper letters you send with your signature, and you can 
do something similar with Zoho Mail by adding a signature at the bottom of 
every e-mail. A Zoho Mail signature is not the same as an electronic signature. 

144
Part II: Scheduling and Communicating 
An e-mail signature is a line or two of text that you’d like to tell the world. The 
signature is appended to the end of your e-mails, following a line of hyphens. 
Here’s an example:
----------------------
Philosophers have more fun.
To add a signature to the end of all your e-mails, just follow these steps:
 
1. At the top of the Zoho Mail page, click the Settings link.
 
2. Click the Personalize tab.
 
3. Click the Signature tab.
 
4. Enter the text for your signature into the text box.
 
 Remember that your signature is added to the end of every one of your 
e-mails. So, for example, you might not want a signature that reads 
something like “PARTY UNTIL YOUR EARS FALL OFF!!” appended to all 
the cover letters you send out for your resumes when looking for a 
new job.
 
5. To add your signature to the bottom of all e-mails, select the Add 
Customized Signature in All My Outgoing E-mails check box.
 
6. Click Save to save your new signature.
 
 When you’re done with the Personalize tab, click the Return to Mail link 
at right, closing the Settings tab.
Taking a look at your sent mail
After you send some e-mails, you can keep track of what you’ve sent in the 
handy Sent folder.
 
1. Click the Sent folder icon in the Folders section of the left pane of 
Zoho Mail.
 
 The current folder becomes the Sent folder, which opens in the main 
Zoho Mail page’s box, as shown in Figure 7-3.
 
 Each e-mail is displayed as a single line in the Sent folder, and that 
line displays the e-mail’s recipient, subject, and date. The e-mails are 
automatically ordered by date, with the most recent e-mails appearing 
toward the top.

145
 Chapter 7: Zoho Mail: Your Communication Center
 
Figure 7-3:

folder of

2. To open an e-mail and read its contents, click the Subject of the e-mail.
 
 The e-mail opens at the bottom of the main Zoho Mail box, as shown in 
Figure 7-4.
 
Figure 7-4: 
Looking 
at a sent 
e-mail in

You can sort e-mails by date by clicking the down arrow for the Date column 
header. When you do, the sort order switches to display the oldest e-mails 
first. Clicking the down arrow again toggles to restore the original sort order. 
To see all e-mails sent to a particular person, click that e-mail address in the 
To column, and Zoho Mail opens a new window showing all the e-mails sent to 
that person (one line per e-mail); click a subject to open the actual e-mail.

146
Part II: Scheduling and Communicating 
Receiving and Reading Your E-Mails
Sending e-mails is only half the fun — it’s time to start receiving some e-mail.
 
Although Zoho Mail checks for new e-mail every few minutes, you can also 
manually check for e-mail. Just click the Fetch button in the toolbar. Zoho Mail 
immediately checks whether you have any e-mail and displays a brief pop-up 
(at the lower right of the browser window), indicating whether you have any 
new mail.
Zoho Mail has a special folder to hold the e-mail you get — the Inbox. Zoho 
Mail places your e-mail into this folder. Here’s how to get your e-mail:
 
1. Click the Inbox folder in the Folders section of the left pane of Zoho Mail.
 
 The Inbox, shown in Figure 7-5, displays any e-mails you have received, 
with the most recent on top. As shown in Figure 7-5, there are two e-mails 
in the Inbox — the one I sent to myself earlier, and a welcome e-mail from 
Zoho Mail itself.
 
Figure 7-5: 
The Zoho 
Mail Inbox.
 
 
2. To read an e-mail, click its Subject.
 
 The e-mail opens in the bottom part of the window, as shown in Figure 7-5.
 
 You can also open e-mails in their own windows. To open an e-mail in a 
dedicated window (containing only that e-mail), click the Popout icon 
that appears between the From and Subject columns. The e-mail pops 
up in its own window.

147
 Chapter 7: Zoho Mail: Your Communication Center
When you first receive an e-mail, its entry (the line that indicates who it’s 
from, the subject, and date) is in bold. After you read the e-mail, the entry 
reverts to plain text.
 
Want to see if any e-mails are waiting for you in a flash? Just take a look at the 
Inbox line in the Folders section of the left-hand pane. If you have any new 
e-mails, you see a number in parentheses next to the Inbox label indicating 
how many e-mails are waiting for you. For example, you can see a (2) in 
Figure 7-5. After you read the new e-mail, the number in parentheses is 
decreased by one automatically.
Replying To and Forwarding Your E-Mail
Say you just read an e-mail from a business colleague, and you want to send 
an answer back. Or, someone sent you an important report, and you want to 
send it to the other members of the committee you’re on. Both replying to 
and forwarding e-mails are possible in Zoho Mail, as you’d expect.
Replying to an e-mail
It’s simple to reply to an e-mail with Zoho Mail. Just follow these steps:
 
1. In the Folders section of the left pane, select the folder that contains 
the e-mail you want to reply to.
 
2. Click the subject of the e-mail you want to reply to.
 
 The e-mail opens at the bottom of the main Zoho window.
 
3. Choose one of the following options:
 
• Reply All: To reply to the sender as well as to everyone copied on 
the original e-mail, click the Reply All button.
 
• Reply: To reply to the just the sender, click the Reply button.
 
 The Reply dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 7-6.
 
4. If you want to add additional recipients, enter those addresses in the 
To, Cc, and Bcc fields.
 
 See the earlier section, “Composing Your Zoho E-Mails” for more on 
these fields.
 
5. (Optional) Edit the Subject line.

148
Part II: Scheduling and Communicating 
 
Figure 7-6: 
Replying to 
an e-mail in 
Zoho Mail.
 
 
6. Type your reply in the body of the e-mail.
 
 The original text of the e-mail is included in the reply and is noted with a 
vertical bar on the left, setting it off from any text you add.
 
7. Click the Send link to send your e-mail and close the Reply dialog box. 
A small reply icon will appear in the Inbox at the right next to the 
e-mail you replied to.
Forwarding an e-mail
The other option besides replying to an e-mail is forwarding it. Forwarding 
e-mail lets you pass along e-mail.
It’s easy to forward an e-mail — just follow these steps:
 
1. In the Folders section of the left pane, click the folder containing the 
e-mail you want to forward.
 
2. Click the subject of the e-mail you wish to forward, opening that e-mail 
in the main Zoho window.
 
3. Click the Forward button above the e-mail’s body.
 
 The Forward dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 7-7.
 
 Forwarding an e-mail works just like replying to an e-mail (as described 
in the preceding section), with three exceptions:
 
• The To box is blank, so you have to fill in the e-mail address of the 
person (or e-mail addresses of the people) you want to forward the 
e-mail to.
 
• Zoho Mail prefaces the subject with Fwd: so you know it’s for-
warded e-mail.
 
• Zoho Mail adds a message at the beginning of the e-mail’s body, 
indicating that this is a forwarded message.

 See the earlier section, “Composing Your Zoho E-Mails” for more on 
these fields.
 
5. (Optional) Edit the Subject line.
 
6. (Optional) Add additional text to the body of the e-mail.
 
7. Click the Send link at left to send your e-mail and close the Forward 
dialog box.
 
 When you send a forwarded e-mail, that e-mail goes to your recipient(s), 
of course — and it also shows up in your Sent mail folder.
Setting a vacation reply
Sometimes, you might want to set up an automatic reply to e-mails: for exam-
ple, configuring your e-mail program to reply automatically to all incoming 
e-mails with a vacation message something like:
I’m in Hawaii, and you’re not. I’ll be back on August 12th and will catch up 
with my e-mail then. If you have an emergency, please refer it to my assis-
tant, Tyler Smith. Aloha!
You can set up Zoho Mail to send vacation replies (and, needless to say, 
vacation replies need not just be used for vacations). If you’re out of the 
office for whatever reason — at a meeting, for example — you might want 
Zoho to handle your e-mail for you, telling everyone when you’ll be back.

Part II: Scheduling and Communicating 
Here’s how to create and activate a vacation reply:
 
1. Click the Settings link.
 
2. Click the Personalize tab.
 
3. Click the Vacation Reply tab, shown in Figure 7-8.

• Enable Vacation Reply: Select the Yes radio button to activate your 
vacation reply.
 
• Send Vacation Reply To: Select the radio button that corresponds 
to who you want the vacation reply sent to. (I cover Zoho Mail con-
tacts in a few pages.) Your three options are All, My Contacts, and 
My Non-Contacts.
 
• From: Click the calendar icon to the right of the From date box, 
opening a calendar control. Click the date you want to start send-
ing your vacation reply in response to e-mails.
 
• To: Click the calendar icon to the right of the To date box, opening 
a calendar control. Click the date you want to stop sending your 
vacation reply in response to e-mails.
 
• Subject: Enter the subject you want to give to your vacation reply 
e-mail.
 
• Content: Enter the body of your vacation reply e-mail (plain text 
only).
 
• Sending Interval: Enter the amount of time in days that Zoho Mail 
waits to send another vacation reply to any given e-mail address.

5. Click Save.
 
 When you’re done with the Personalize tab, click the Back to Mail button 
at right, closing the Settings tab.
 
Vacation replies are very useful, and they can augment your professional 
image. Just remember to turn them off (by selecting the No radio button in 
the Enable Vacation Reply section of the Vacation Reply tab) when you get 
back to the office.
Managing Your Inbox
There are several ways to manage your e-mail, such as deleting unwanted 
e-mails, moving e-mails to other folders, and marking e-mail.
It’s outta here: Deleting e-mail
In time, your e-mail is going to accumulate (let’s hope you don’t fall into the 
clutches of spammers, which would mean your e-mail would pile up very 
quickly), and you’re probably not going to want to keep all that e-mail.
Here are the two ways to delete e-mails from your Inbox — or any Zoho Mail 
folder. Here’s what you do:
 
1. In the Folders section of the left pane, click the folder that contains 
the e-mail you want to delete.
 
2. Select the e-mail you want to delete:
 
• To select a single message to delete: Click the subject of the e-mail, 
which gives that entry a yellow background in the Inbox.
 
• To mark multiple e-mails for deletion: Select the check box at the 
beginning of each entry that you want to delete.
 
3. Click the Delete button (above the list of entries) to delete the e-mail 
or e-mails you selected.
 
Unlike other deletion operations in Zoho, no confirmation dialog box appears 
(Do you wish to delete?) when you click the Delete button in Zoho Mail. The 
e-mail you delete is moved to the Trash folder instead. To delete it perma-
nently, you must open the Trash folder (click the Trash folder in the Folders 
section of the left pane), select the e-mail, and then click Delete. Otherwise, 
Zoho Mail routinely deletes mail in the Trash folder by itself when the e-mail 
becomes 30 days old.

152
Part II: Scheduling and Communicating 
Organizing your e-mail with folders
When you’re going through your mail, Zoho Mail offers you the ability to 
transfer e-mail to the Inbox, Spam, or Trash folder. (Bear in mind that if you 
transfer e-mail to the Trash folder, you’ll have to open the Trash folder at 
some point and delete it, or rely on Zoho Mail’s 30-day limit.)
Here’s how to transfer e-mail between folders:
 
1. Click a folder in the Folders section in the left pane of Zoho Mail.
 
2. Select the e-mail you want to move:
 
• To select a single message to move: Click the subject of the e-mail, 
which gives that entry a yellow background in the Inbox.
 
• To mark multiple e-mails to move: Select the check box at the 
beginning of each entry.
 
3. Click the down arrow next to the Move button on the toolbar and then 
select which of the following folders you want to transfer the selected 
e-mails to:
 
• Inbox
 
• Spam
 
• Trash
 
 That gives you more organizing power.
Zoho gives you a set of standards folders to start with, but you also have the 
option of creating additional folders to organize your e-mail. If you want to 
create a new folder, follow these steps:
 
1. In the Folders pane, click the plus button to the right of the word 
Folders.
 
 The New Folder dialog box appears.
 
2. Enter the name of the new folder in the text box.
 
3. (Optional) If you want the new folder to be a subfolder of an existing 
folder, select the parent folder.
 
4. Click OK.
 
 Your new folder appears in the Folders pane. If you created a subfolder, 
you may have to click the plus button to the left of the parent folder to 
display it.

153
 Chapter 7: Zoho Mail: Your Communication Center
A word about spam
E-mail spam (unwanted mass e-mail, usually commercial) — everyone 
hates it, but some people fall for it and buy things advertised with spam, 
unfortunately — otherwise it would disappear. What can you do about not 
getting spam in Zoho Mail?
First, Zoho Mail has one of the best spam filters around. Because spam is 
based on mass-mailing, Zoho Mail can detect what it suspects is spam by 
watching where it’s sent. It reads and takes into consideration the body 
of the e-mail, whether the return address is genuine, and whether links or 
return e-mail headers and so on are faked before marking e-mail as spam.
E-mail that Zoho Mail sends you that it considers spam shows up in your 
Spam folder. This folder is a lot like the Trash folder: In fact, e-mails in the 
Spam folder are automatically deleted after approximately 30 days.
 
You can also report e-mail as spam yourself, and with just the single click of a 
button. Just click the Report Spam button in the e-mail’s entry in the Inbox. 
This button is directly to the left of the red X that deletes the e-mail.
Marking e-mail with flags and bolding
Another way you can take charge of your Inbox (as well as other folders) is 
by marking your e-mail with flags and bolding. For example, if you mark an 
e-mail as important, a red flag appears in its entry in the Inbox. If you mark it 
as unread, its entry in the Inbox is in bold, and so on.
To manage mail markers, such as flags or bolding, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the folder that holds the e-mail you want to mark.
 
2. To select the message(s) you want to mark, choose one of the follow-
ing options:
 
• To mark a single message: Click the subject of the e-mail, which 
gives that entry a yellow background in the Inbox.
 
• To mark multiple e-mails: Select the check box at the beginning of 
each entry.

154
Part II: Scheduling and Communicating 
 
3. Click the down arrow next to the Mark As button in the toolbar and 
select one of the following options:
 
• Read: Mark the e-mail as read.
 
• Unread: Mark the e-mail as unread.
 
• Spam: Mark the e-mail as spam.
 
• Archive: Mark the e-mail as an archived e-mail.
 
• Info: Mark the e-mail as an informational e-mail.
 
• Important: Default e-mails have a small black-and-white flag in their 
folder entries. This flag appears just before the e-mail address of 
the person who sent the e-mail. When you mark e-mail as impor-
tant, that flag turns to red although it’s not the easiest to see.
 
• Follow Up: When you mark an e-mail for follow-up, a small flag 
appears in the title bar of the e-mail when you open that e-mail. 
Again, however, it’s not easy to see.
 
• Clear Flag: Clears any flags.
Handling Attachments in Zoho E-Mail
What would e-mail be without attachments? Whether you’re sending a report 
to your boss or family pictures to Aunt Ida, being able to e-mail files is impor-
tant. In this section, I take a look at how to work with attachments — both 
sending and getting them.
Adding attachments to your e-mail
You can add an attachment to your e-mail in two ways — either add a file 
from your computer, or add a file from another Zoho application.
To add an attachment from your computer, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Attach link in the Compose dialog box.
 
 The File Upload dialog box appears.
 
2. Browse to the document you want to attach.
 
3. Select the document to upload by clicking it; then click Open.
 
 The attachment appears by name in the Attachments box in the 
Compose dialog box at right, as shown in Figure 7-9.

155
 Chapter 7: Zoho Mail: Your Communication Center
 
Figure 7-9: 
The Attach-
ments box.
 
Attachment
To attach a Zoho document, follow these steps:
 
1. Click Attach from Docs in the Compose dialog box.
 
 The Attach from Zoho Docs dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 7-10.
 
Figure 7-10: 
The Attach 
from Zoho 
Docs dialog 
box.
 
 
2. Select the check box in front of all the documents you want to attach.
 
3. Click OK to close the dialog box.
 
 The attachment appears by name in the Attachments box (upper right) 
of the Compose dialog box.

156
Part II: Scheduling and Communicating 
After you attach your file(s), continue writing your e-mail as normal, and then 
click Send to send it and close the Compose dialog box.
 
If you discover that you attached the wrong document, you can delete it by 
clicking the red X to its right in the Attachments box.
Opening e-mail attachments
When you receive an e-mail with an attachment, you see a small paper clip 
icon in the e-mail’s entry in the Inbox, as shown in Figure 7-11.
You can open an attachment through the Attachments dialog box or by click-
ing the attachment within the message itself.
 
Figure 7-11:
 A new 
e-mail 
showing an 
attachment.
 
Attachments icon
Follow these steps to open a document or download multiple documents in 
the Attachments dialog box:
 
1. Click the paper clip icon in the e-mail’s Inbox entry.
 
 The Attachments dialog box opens, displaying a list of your attachments 
by name.
 
2. Choose one of the following options:

157
 Chapter 7: Zoho Mail: Your Communication Center
 
• To open an attachment: Click the attachment you want to open, 
which causes your browser to download and open the attachment.
 
• To download multiple attachments: Select the check box in front of 
the attachments you want to open and then click the Download as 
ZIP button. Zoho Mail puts the selected attachments into a Zip file, 
and your browser downloads the file.
If you want to open the attachment within the message itself, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the e-mail by clicking its subject in its Inbox entry.
 
 The attachment(s) are displayed by name in the open e-mail (refer to 
Figure 7-11).
 
2. Click the attachment in the box in the open e-mail.
 
 Your browser downloads and opens the attachment.
Searching Your E-Mail
Zoho Mail lets you search your e-mail, and that’s good for serious e-mail 
users. Some people use their e-mail practically as virtual filing cabinets, keep-
ing track of contacts and projects with their Inbox. For example, if you’re the 
head of a corporate project management team, you might get a lot of e-mail 
reports on the progress of various projects. By making your e-mail search-
able, you can keep tabs on past progress and organize that e-mail.
Searching all messages
To search all the e-mail in your folders, simply enter the search term into the 
Search box (shown in Figure 7-12) and then click the Search button.
All e-mails that contain your search term are displayed in the search results. 
For example, you can see the search results for the search term attachment 
(that is, the search is for the word “attachment” in Figure 7-12). Zoho Mail 
found two e-mails — one in the Sent folder, and one in the Inbox folder. Note 
that Zoho Mail opens the search results in a new tab, which is labeled with 
the search term (attachment here), as shown in Figure 7-12.

158
Part II: Scheduling and Communicating 
 
Figure 7-12: 
Search 
results in 
Zoho Mail.
 
Search box
Click to narrow your search
To open an e-mail, just click its subject, which causes Zoho Mail to open and 
display the e-mail at the bottom of the window. When you’re done with the 
search results, click the X button in the tab to close the tab.
 
Zoho Mail can search only attached Zoho documents, plain text documents, 
and zipped combinations of those documents. So don’t attach documents in 
non-Zoho format and expect Zoho Mail to be able to search them.
Restricting searches
By default, Mail searches search everything in an e-mail — subject, To fields, 
the mail body, and so on. Better yet, you can select only the parts of e-mails 
you want to search.
To restrict a search to only specific parts of e-mails, such as the subject lines, 
click the button just to the left of the search box, opening a menu with 
these items:
 
✓ Subject
 
✓ Sender
 
✓ Subject or Sender Contains
 
✓ To: or Cc:
 
✓ Attachment name
 
✓ Attachment contents
 
✓ Mail Contents
 
✓ Search in All Folders
 
✓ Search in Folder
Select the item you want to add to the search, such as the Sender field. Zoho 
Mail places a check mark in front of all the items you select, and your search 
will search only those items of your e-mails.

159
 Chapter 7: Zoho Mail: Your Communication Center
That’s useful, for example, if you want to exclude a field from a search. For 
example, you and your recipient may have kept the same subject line even 
as your e-mails started straying far from the original topic. By omitting the 
subject line from the search, you can target only the e-mails that have to do 
directly with what you’re looking for.
Searching specific folders
By default, Zoho Mail searches through all mail folders when it conducts a 
search, but you can restrict it to search through just a specific folder. Here’s 
how to do that:
 
1. Click the folder you want to search in the Folders section of the left pane.
 
2. Click the button just to the left of the Search box (refer to Figure 7-12), 
opening the drop-down menu.
 
3. Select the Search in Folder menu item.
 
 This sets the current folder as the folder that Zoho Mail searches.
 
4. Enter the search term in the Search box.
 
5. Click the Search button.
 
This feature is useful to know if you’re searching for a common term and don’t 
want to see search results from all folders at the same time, which can clutter 
up the search results considerably.
Saving E-Mail on Your Computer 
and Printing E-Mail
You can leave e-mail on Zoho Mail indefinitely (except in the Spam and Trash 
folders, where e-mail is deleted after 30 days), but you can also easily save 
e-mail to your computer.
To save an e-mail to your computer (HTML e-mail is saved as an HTML docu-
ment, plain text e-mails as TXT documents), follow these steps:
 
1. In the Folders section of the left pane, select the folder that contains 
the e-mail you want to save.
 
2. Click the subject of the e-mail you want to save, opening that e-mail at 
the bottom of the main Zoho window.
 
3. Click the down arrow next to the More Options button that appears 
above the e-mail’s text, opening a drop-down menu.

160
Part II: Scheduling and Communicating 
 
4. Choose Save from the drop-down menu.
 
 Your browser opens a dialog box asking whether you want to download 
the e-mail as a document.
 
5. Select a name and location for the e-mail.
 
6. Click OK to save the document.
Working with Your Address 
Book Contacts
When you send an e-mail, Zoho Mail automatically adds the recipient(s) 
to your address book — a collection of e-mail addresses — and you can 
save yourself some time when composing e-mail by getting e-mail addresses 
from your address book.
You can open your address book when you compose an e-mail. Here’s how
to do that:
 
1. Click the Compose button.
 
 The Compose dialog box opens in a new window.
 
2. Click the Address Book link at the top of the Compose dialog box.
 
 Your address book opens on the left side of the window, as shown in 
Figure 7-13.
 
Figure 7-13: 
Using the 
address 
book in 
Zoho Mail.
 

161
 Chapter 7: Zoho Mail: Your Communication Center
 
3. To select an e-mail address, mark the check box to the left of the 
address. Then click the To, Cc, or Bcc button at the bottom of the 
panel, depending on whether you want the address to appear in the 
To, Cc, or Bcc field, respectively.
 
4. Close the address book by clicking the X button at the upper right in 
the address book.
 
5. Finish composing your e-mail.
Using your address book is a handy timesaver, and also makes sure that you 
don’t have to worry about spelling e-mail addresses correctly.
 
Your address book can get full pretty quickly because Zoho Mail automatically 
adds your recipients’ e-mail addresses to the address book. As of this writing, 
there’s no way to manage the addresses in your address book — no way to 
delete e-mail addresses, for example.
Organizing Your E-Mail with 
Labels and Folders
Zoho Mail also lets you organize e-mail by using labels and by creating your 
own mail folders.
A label is a small mark that has a name and a color, and you can apply labels 
to individual e-mails. You can also search for all e-mails with a particular 
label, such as “urgent” or “New project.” Zoho Mail doesn’t come with any 
built-in labels; you create and name them yourself.
You can also organize your e-mail by creating new folders in Zoho Mail. As 
I discuss earlier in this chapter, Zoho Mail comes with built-in folders, such 
as Inbox, Outbox, Trash, and Sent. But there isn’t a folder named Mail From 
Freddie — surely that was an oversight on Zoho’s part? It turns out that you 
can add and name your own folders in Zoho Mail, and you find out how to do 
that in this section.
Creating and using labels
You can create new labels easily in Zoho Mail, and then apply your new 
labels to various e-mails. One of the main selling points of labels is their flex-
ibility. You can create a label and apply it to many different e-mails; you’re 
not tied to a single e-mail.

162
Part II: Scheduling and Communicating 
Creating a label
Here’s how to create a label:
 
1. Click the down arrow next to the Labels button on the toolbar (not the 
Labels bar in the left-hand pane) and then choose New Label from the 
drop-down menu that opens.
 
 The New Label dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 7-14.
 
Figure 7-14: 
Create a 
new label.
 
 
2. Enter the name of the new label in the dialog box.
 
3. Click the down arrow next to the color box to reveal a drop-down 
menu of eight color names, and then select a color for your new label.
 
4. Click OK, closing the New Label dialog box.
 
 You created a new label. Zoho Mail adds the new label name to the 
Labels drop-down menu, making that label accessible to you.
All the labels you create in Zoho Mail also appear in the Labels section in the 
left pane of Zoho Mail. I created the Urgent label shown in Figure 7-15.
Applying a label to an e-mail
You can assign the labels you’ve created to e-mails with a simple click of the 
mouse. Just follow these steps:
 
1. Click the folder where the e-mail you want to label is contained in the 
Folders section of the left-hand pane.
 
2. Select the e-mail to label in the folder, or select the check boxes in 
front of all e-mails you want to label.
 
3. Click the Labels button on the toolbar.
 
 A drop-down menu opens, listing all the available labels (as well as the 
New Label option).
 
4. Select the label you want to apply to the selected e-mail(s).
 
 Zoho adds the label to the e-mail(s) you selected. That label (a small 
colored box) appears in the labeled e-mails’ entry in the folder (right in 
front of the subject), as well as at the top of the e-mail when you open it 
for reading, as shown in Figure 7-15.

163
 Chapter 7: Zoho Mail: Your Communication Center
 
Figure 7-15: 
Using a 
new label.
 
Label icon
 
When you click a label in the Labels section, Zoho displays all the e-mails 
that are labeled with that label, making it easy to use labels to organize your 
e-mails.
Creating new folders
Say that you decided that having a label named Urgent isn’t enough for your 
purposes. You need a whole new folder named Urgent to contain urgent 
e-mails.
Can you create such a folder in Zoho Mail? Yes. Just follow these steps:
 
1. Click the plus icon to the right of the word Folders in the Folders bar 
in the left pane.
 
 The New Folder dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 7-16.
 
Figure 7-16: 
The New 
Folder 
dialog box.
 

164
Part II: Scheduling and Communicating 
 
2. Enter the name of the new folder in the Folder Name text box.
 
 By default, the new folder is a parent folder, meaning that it’s not a sub-
folder of another folder.
 
3. (Optional) If you want the new folder to be a subfolder of an existing 
folder, select the parent folder in the Select a Parent Folder field.
 
 If you click a folder to make it the parent folder, that folder’s name 
appears in the Location box in the New Folder dialog box.
 
4. Click OK to create the new folder and close the New Folder dialog box.
 
 The new folder — Urgent, for example — appears in the Folders section 
of the left-hand pane in Zoho Mail, as shown in Figure 7-17.
 
Figure 7-17: 
A new

New folder
You can open the new folder — although there will be no e-mail in it yet — by 
clicking it in the Folders section in the left-hand pane of Zoho Mail.
To move e-mail to and from the new folder, look for the new folder you just 
created in the menu when you click the down arrow next to the Move button. 
To move e-mail to the new folder, just select that e-mail and then select that 
folder’s name from the Move button’s drop-down menu.
Reading Your E-Mail Offline
E-mail applications on your laptop or desktop let you read your e-mail (just 
not get new e-mail or send e-mail) when you’re offline. Zoho Mail can do the 
same with help from Gears by Google. Find you how to install Gears at the 
end of Chapter 3.

165
 Chapter 7: Zoho Mail: Your Communication Center
To configure Zoho Mail for offline e-mail reading, make sure that Gears is 
installed and then follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Setup Offline link at the top of Zoho Mail.
 
 The Offline Settings dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 7-18.
 
Figure 7-18:

2. Set the following options for offline e-mail reading:
 
• Number of Mails to Download Initially, to Setup Offline Mode: From 
the drop-down box, select a value for the number of e-mails you 
want to download from the online version of Zoho Mail.
 
• Number of Sent Mails to Be Available Offline: From the drop-down 
box, select the value for the number of sent e-mails you want to 
have available offline.
 
• Download Images and Attachments: Select this check box if you 
want to make images and attachments available offline.
 
• Create Desktop Icon: Select this check box if you want Gears to 
create an icon for Zoho Mail on your desktop.
 
3. Click the Setup Offline button to close the dialog box.
The next time you’re offline, you can navigate your browser to mail.zoho.
com, and Zoho Mail appears. You can read your e-mail; you just can’t receive 
new e-mail or send e-mail while you’re offline, of course.

Managing Data

In this part . . .
T
he data workhorses of the Zoho suite are in this part: 
Sheet and Reports.
Zoho Sheet is the Zoho spreadsheet application. It’s as 
powerful as any spreadsheet application costing hun-
dreds of dollars, and gives you everything you’d expect, 
from entering data to working with functions and 
formulas.
Zoho Reports is the Zoho database application, which you 
use to create relational databases that connect data from 
table to table. You get a guided tour to this application in 
this part.

oho Sheet — one of the standard Zoho applications — is a very powerful 
spreadsheet tool. For data you need to keep track of and view in table 
form, give Sheet a try. Whether you’re simply tracking inventory, or you’re 
a real estate investor running a what-if scenario to see whether an invest-
ment is worth the risk, Sheet is the perfect app because you can use it to 
make your spreadsheets come alive by using formulas to work with the data 
entered into a spreadsheet.
If you’re familiar with Microsoft Excel or Calc from OpenOffice.org, you’re 
going to find a great deal of similarity here: You’re already a leg up. Sheet 
is very similar to Excel and Calc, with a few additions, such as sharing your 
spreadsheets with others.

170
Part III: Managing Data 
In this chapter, you find out how to create a new spreadsheet, how to enter 
data, edit that data, organize your data, add and delete columns and rows, 
create charts, and more.
Getting Started with Zoho Sheet
To start using Sheet, navigate your browser to http://sheet.zoho.com, 
enter your Zoho username and password, and then click the Sign In button. 
(See Chapter 1 for more on this process.) When Sheet appears, you’ll already 
have a default spreadsheet set up for you, as shown in Figure 8-1.
The two toolbars you use are the
 
✓ Action toolbar: Use the tools here to perform actions such importing, 
exporting, and sharing spreadsheets.
 
✓ Formatting toolbar: Use these tools to format the data that appears in 
each cell. For example, apply bold, italic, and underline.

Underneath the two toolbars is the Formula bar, where you enter the formu-

in this chapter.
In the left-hand pane is the My Sheets section, which presents an overview 
of your spreadsheets. It also has other sections, such as a Trash section for 
when you delete a spreadsheet.
The real meat of Sheet takes place in the actual spreadsheet that you see in 
Figure 8-1, which is the grid of cells that takes up most of the window. Just 
like in other spreadsheet apps, rows are labeled with numbers, and columns 
with letters. The top-left cell in a sheet — the first cell — is cell A1. The cell 
to the right of it is cell B1, the cell just underneath A1 is A2, and so on. That’s 
how you address each cell in a sheet, with a letter and a number: A1, B4, and 
so on.
Each spreadsheet can be made up of multiple sheets. In fact, the default 
spreadsheet that Zoho Sheet creates for you when you first open Sheet con-
tains three sheets. You can move between those sheets by clicking the tabs 
at the bottom of the window, labeled Sheet1, Sheet2, and Sheet3.
 
To add a new sheet to an existing spreadsheet, right-click one of the tabs at 
the bottom of the spreadsheet window and choose Insert. To open an existing 
spreadsheet, click the link to that spreadsheet that appears in the left-hand 
pane of Sheet.
Entering Data
Entering data into a Sheet spreadsheet works in much the same way as it 
does in Excel or Calc, so no need to spend too much time on the basics. 
Entering data into a spreadsheet is simple: You just click the cell and type or 
paste your data. You don’t have to start entering your data with cell A1.
When you click a cell, the cell appears with a bold black outline, indicating that 
it’s the active cell — the target of anything you type — and your keystrokes 

172
Part III: Managing Data 
appear there. When you’re entering data, pressing the Tab key moves the 
active cell to the next cell to the right. And the arrow keys work to move the 
active cell where you want.
To edit the contents of a cell, double-click that cell, which makes the text 
insertion cursor appear. To delete the contents of the active cell, just press 
the Delete key.
Zoho Sheet comes with many keyboard shortcuts; you can see them in 
Table 8-1.

You can also work with ranges of cells in Sheet. You can select whole ranges 
of cells and work with them all at once, formatting their contents the same 
way, copying them, pasting data into a range, or cutting a whole range of 
cells. (Just use the standard keyboard shortcuts you’re used to: Ctrl+C, V, 
and X, respectively.) To create a range of cells, drag the mouse from the 
upper-left cell in the range to the lower-right cell in the range. You can also 
click a column or row header to select all the corresponding columns or 
rows.
When you select a range of cells, a bold outline appears around the range, 
and a hollow plus sign appears at the range’s lower-right corner. Sheet treats 
ranges of cells the same way as it would treat a single cell. For example, when 
you paste a multirow and multicolumn range, the cells in all the range’s rows 
and columns are pasted at once.
To save your spreadsheet, click the Save button (the one that displays a 
diskette icon) on the Action toolbar. If you haven’t already given your spread-
sheet a name, Sheet asks for a name, as shown in Figure 8-2. Give it a name 
and then click OK.
 
Figure 8-2: 
Saving a 
spread-

After you save a spreadsheet, the new name for the spreadsheet appears in 
the My Sheets section of the left-hand pane, as shown in Figure 8-3.
To delete a spreadsheet, go to its line in the left-hand pane, click the down-
pointing arrow at the extreme right, and select the Send to Trash item. Then 
click the Trash bar in the left-hand pane, opening the Trash section. Click the 
check box next to the item you want to delete, click the down arrow next to 
the Actions item at lower right in the Trash section, and select Delete Item.

Adding and Deleting Rows and Columns
One of the most fundamental manipulations you can make with spreadsheets 
is to add or delete new rows or columns.
Adding a new column
Say you need to modify a spreadsheet by adding a column between two exist-
ing columns. Just follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click any cell in the column to the right of where you want to 
insert a new column.
 
2. From the menu that appears, choose Insert➪Column Before.
 
 If you clicked the column to the left of where you want to insert a new 
column, choose Column After.
 
 The new column appears. In Figure 8-4, the new column becomes 
column D. The old column D, which held employee titles, becomes 
column E.
Now you’re free to enter new data — say, employees’ IDs, as shown in 
Figure 8-5.

 Chapter 8: Zoho Sheet: All Your Data Cell by Cell
 
Figure 8-4: 
Add a 
column.
 
New column
 
Figure 8-5: 
Enter data 
into a new 
column.
 
 
In the figure, the text in the new column aligns to the right. If you want to 
align it to the left, select the text in the new column and click the Alignment 
button (opening the Alignment menu, as shown in Figure 8-5), and then 
choose Align Left.
Adding a new row
Similarly, you can also add new rows to a spreadsheet:
 
1. Right-click the row below where you want to insert a new row.
 
2. From the menu that spears, choose Insert➪Row Above.
 
 If you clicked the row above where you want to insert a new column, 
choose Row Below.
 
 The new row appears, as shown in Figure 8-6.

Adding Comments and Data Formats
Data is just that: data. Sometimes you need a little behind-the-scenes com-
mentary. For that, use the comment feature in Sheet. And when it comes 
to numbers, Sheet is a whiz. There are all kinds of built-in formats, such as 
Currency, Date/Time, and Percentage formats. Using these formats makes 
your data appear in the correct format (for example, with a $ sign in front of 
it), and helps Sheet know how to treat your data.
Adding a comment
Sometimes, just raw data in a cell doesn’t say enough. For example, you have 
a currency amount in a cell, but you want to note that it’s questionable, or 
perhaps that it’s last year’s data. Adding a comment to the contents of a cell 
can be very helpful. Follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click the cell to which you want to add a comment.
 
2. From the menu that appears, choose Insert Comment.
 
3. Enter your comment in the Insert Comment dialog box that opens, as 
shown in Figure 8-7.
 
Figure 8-7: 
Add a com-
ment here.
 

177
 Chapter 8: Zoho Sheet: All Your Data Cell by Cell
 
4. Click OK.
 
 A red triangle appears in the upper left of the cell you added a comment 
to, as shown in Figure 8-8.
 
Figure 8-8: 
This cell 
holds a 
comment.
 
This cell has a comment.
To read the comment, hover the mouse over the cell with the comment. A 
pop-up appears, showing the comment and its author, as shown in Figure 8-8.
 
You can also edit and delete comments:
 
✓ To edit a comment: Right-click the cell with the comment, and then 
choose Edit Comment. In the menu that opens, edit the comment text in 
the Edit Comment dialog box.
 
✓ To delete a comment: Right-click the cell with the comment and choose 
Remove Comment. The comment and red triangle both disappear.
Using date, currency, and 
percentage formats
Wouldn’t it be nice if that column of dollar amounts actually displayed a $ sign 
in front of every amount? Or that column of percentages displayed a % sign 
after each item? You can format each item using $ signs, % signs, and more. 
Using formatting is way better than typing a $ character yourself in front of an 
item, which makes Sheet treat the item as text, not as a number. This is a big 
deal because Sheet can’t, for example, add such items to display their sum.
To format an item in a cell as a dollar amount — so that a dollar sign appears 
in front of it — do the following:
 
1. Select the cell (click it).
 
2. Click the down arrow next to the Currency button on the Formatting 
toolbar to open the drop-down menu shown in Figure 8-9.

178
Part III: Managing Data 
 
Figure 8-9: 
Currency 
format 
options.
 
 
3. Choose the currency type you want to use.
 
 The data in the cell is formatted using the currency type you choose, and 
the appropriate currency symbol appears in the cell before the amount.
Formatting data in date/time format works much the same:
 
1. Select the cell you want to format.
 
2. Click the down arrow next to the Date/Time button (to the left of the 
Currency button) on the Formatting toolbar.
 
3. Choose a date/time format.
 
 You see choices like 15 Aug 06, 15 August 2006, and so on.
To format numbers as percentages, use the Percentage button (to the right of 
the Currency button).
Organizing Your Data by Sorting
Columns of words or numbers are nice, but you might get a little tired scan-
ning up and down them for the entry you want. Sheet allows you to sort your 
data into orderly columns. That’s good if you have a set of names, for exam-
ple, and want to alphabetize them. Or if you have a set of numbers and want 
to order them from lowest to highest or highest to lowest.
Performing a standard sort
Sheet offers you a quick way of sorting your data into ascending or descend-
ing rows. For example, say you have data on fruits in a spreadsheet named 
Produce, and you want to sort this data, row by row, alphabetically.

179
 Chapter 8: Zoho Sheet: All Your Data Cell by Cell
To sort data like this, you want to perform a standard sort:
 
1. Select the data you want to sort.
 
 Be sure to select all the columns you want, or Sheet sorts only the col-
umns you do select, which might leave data in some rows unsorted. 
Sheet won’t sort data row by row automatically. See Figure 8-10.
 
Figure 8-10: 
Running a 
standard 
sort.
 
 
2. Choose your sort type:
 
• Sort Ascending (as shown in Figure 8-10): Orders your data from 
0–10 and a–z.
 
• Sort Descending (to the right of the Sort Ascending button): Sorts 
your data from 10–0 and z–a.
Performing a custom sort
Maybe you want a more sophisticated type of sort: say, by quantity of each 
item and not by the item’s name. That seems to be a problem because you 
have to select all the columns you want to sort at the same time. So how can 
you tell Sheet which column’s data to sort by, if you don’t want to use the 
first selected column of data to sort on?
You can do a custom sort:
 
1. Select the data you want to sort (select all columns).
 
 Be sure to select all the columns you want, or Sheet sorts only the col-
umns you do select, which might leave data in some rows unsorted. 
Sheet won’t sort data row by row automatically.
 
2. Right-click the selected area.
 
3. From the menu that appears, choose Sort➪Custom Sort.
 
 The Sort dialog box opens, shown in Figure 8-11. You can sort on up to 
three criteria with this dialog box.

180
Part III: Managing Data 
 
Figure 8-11: 
Custom 
sorting data

4. From the top drop-down list, select the first column you want to sort 
(your primary sort).
 
5. Select the Ascending or Descending radio button to indicate which 
type of sort.
 
6. Repeat Steps 5 and 6 for up to two more columns to sort on, using the 
middle and bottom drop-down lists (respectively) for your second- and 
third-level sorts.
 
7. Select list options (both optional):
 
• Contains Header check box: If you want your sort to include the 
column header (the button at the top of the header with the col-
umn’s letter in it)
 
• Case Sensitive check box: If you want your sort to be case sensitive 
(alphanumeric sorts only)
 
8. Choose a sort orientation radio button:
 
• Sort Top to Bottom (the default)
 
• Sort Left to Right
 
9. Click OK to execute the sort.
A Picture Is Worth a Thousand Words: 
Creating Charts
Presenting your data in rows and columns is just one way of looking at it. As 
a visual option, you can chart your data instead — say, create a pie chart or a 
graph of your data. To chart your data visually, just follow these steps:

181
 Chapter 8: Zoho Sheet: All Your Data Cell by Cell
 
1. Select the data you want to sort (select all columns).
 
2. Click the Chart button, opening the Add Chart dialog box shown in 
Figure 8-12.
 
Figure 8-12: 
Add a chart 
here.
 
 
3. From the Chart Type list, click the type of chart you want.
 
4. From the Sub Type area on the right, click the specific chart you want.
 
5. Click the Next button, opening the second page (Source Data) of the 
Add Chart dialog box.
 
 From this page, you can select the range of cells for your chart in range 
format: for example, D6:E11. Because you already selected the data (in 
Step 1) to display in your chart before opening the Add Chart dialog box, 
you’re all set and don’t need to enter a range here. (Your range should 
already be displayed in the dialog box.)
 
6. Click the Next button, opening the third page (Options) of the Add 
Chart dialog box, as shown in Figure 8-13.
 
Figure 8-13: 
Enter chart 
options

182
Part III: Managing Data 
 
7. Set your chart options:
 
• Enter a title for your chart.
 
• Use the Data Labels drop-down list to set how you want your data 
labeled in the chart (shown in Figure 8-13).
 
 This item lets you label the sections of your pie or the bars in your 
charts with data values.
 
• Leave the Show Legend check box selected (it is, by default) to have 
a legend appear showing which color bars or slices stand for which 
data items.
 
8. Click the Done button to dismiss the Add Chart dialog box and create 
your chart.

Serious Data Crunching: Using 
Formulas and Functions
Spreadsheets can do more than just look pretty: They can crunch your data 
as well. You can use formulas to read the data in your cells, crunch it, and 
display the result in a new cell. For example, you might want to take the aver-
age of a column of numbers. Or you might have a long column of numbers to 
add, and a formula can do that. In fact, adding columns of numbers is such a 
common thing to do that Sheet includes a dedicated button to sum a column 
of numbers for you — no formula needed.
I start with a look at the Sum button first because summing is probably the 
most common use of numerical operations in Sheet, and then I show you how 
to use formulas in general.

183
 Chapter 8: Zoho Sheet: All Your Data Cell by Cell
Using the Sum button
The easiest way to add a column of numbers is to use the Sum button. All 
you have to do is select the numbers you want to add and then click the Sum 
button on the Formatting toolbar.
When you do, Sheet adds the numbers automatically and inserts their sum into 
the cell right under the column of numbers. See Figure 8-15 for an example.
 
Figure 8-15: 
Sum a 
column of 
numbers.
 
Sum a column.
Creating a formula
You can also use math operators to create your own formula to crunch data 
in Sheet. Here are the math operators you can use:
Operator 
 
 
Function
+ 
Addition
– 
Subtraction
* 
Multiplication
/ 
Division
Although I don’t want to get ahead of myself here, you aren’t limited to using 
only +, –, *, and /. Read more in the upcoming section, “Using functions in 
Sheet.”
In Sheet, formulas are connected with a particular cell. That is, the formula 
for a cell tells Sheet what data (usually from other cells) to crunch so that the 
results appear in the cell. You can refer to other cells with the column/row 
convention in Sheet, such as D5 or F99.
Taking the data presented in Figure 8-15, say you wanted to add all the num-
bers of fruit explicitly. To do that with a formula, just follow these steps.

184
Part III: Managing Data 
 
1. Click the cell that will contain the formula, making it the active cell.
 
 The cell address (in this example, E12) appears in the first text box in 
the Formula bar. If any formula already exists for that cell, that formula 
is displayed in the second text box in the Formula bar.
 
2. Enter the formula in the second, larger text box in the Formula bar.
 
 While you enter the formula, it appears in the active cell as well as in the 
Formula bar.
 
 For this example, address the numbers to add by cell, E6 through E11. 
Start your formula with an equal sign so that Sheet knows you want the 
result to appear in the active cell. The formula to use to add the column 
of numbers in Figure 8-16 is
=(E6 + E7 + E8 + E9 + E10 + E11)
 
 The parentheses are optional.
  
 Besides cell addresses, you can also use numbers in formulas, as well as 
functions, which are coming up next.
 
Figure 8-16:
 Sum a 
column of 
numbers 
with a 
formula.
 
Formula
 
3. Press Enter.
 
 Doing so makes the active cell move to the cell directly beneath the cell 
you’re entering the formula to. It also makes Sheet evaluate your formula 
and display the result in the cell in which you placed the formula.
 
To edit the formula for a cell, just click that cell. The formula for that cell 
appears in the larger text box in the Formula bar, and you can make your 
changes there.

185
 Chapter 8: Zoho Sheet: All Your Data Cell by Cell
Using functions in Sheet
If you don’t want to write all the cell addresses that you’re adding in formula 
[like =(E6 + E7 + E8 + E9 + E10 + E11) in the preceding example], you can use a 
shortcut: the SUM function. The SUM function is one of the built-in functions 
in Sheet, and there are dozens of them. In this case, all you have to do is to 
pass the range of cells you want to add to the SUM function.
In Sheet, you create a range of cells like this:
cell address 1:cell address 2
where cell address 1 is the first cell in the range, and cell address 2 is the last 
cell in the range.
For example, to add the numbers from cells E6 through E11, use the range 
E6:E11, and append the SUM function like this:
SUM(E6:E11)
To make this into a formula, add the required = sign in front, like this:
=SUM(E6:E11)
Instead of summing E6 through E11, say you want the average number of 
each item. In that case, use the AVERAGE function like this:
=AVERAGE(E6:E11)
And to count the number of cells in the range E6:E11, use the COUNT 
function:
=COUNT(E6:E11)
Sometimes, a function can be used for a single cell value. For example, say 
you wanted the hyperbolic cosine of the value in cell D6. You could use the 
COSH function:
=COSH(D6)
Dozens of functions come built in to Sheet. You can get an idea of the high-
lights in Table 8-2.

The Cool Stuff: Creating Pivot Tables
Even more functionality is built into Sheet, such as pivot tables, which you 
can use to compare your data and create summaries in different ways. For 
example, say you have the data on the salespeople shown in Figure 8-23.
 
Figure 8-23: 
Use a pivot 
table to look 
at data in 
new ways.
 
Note that some salespeople sell in both the East and West divisions, giving 
them more than one row. It would be easier to redo this table and create a 
sum for each column.
That’s what pivot tables let you do: reorganize and summarize your data. They 
can break out a column of data (such as the Division column in Figure 8-23) 
into different columns: say, one column per data item in the original column. 

193
 Chapter 8: Zoho Sheet: All Your Data Cell by Cell
In this example, note that the original Division column has two items in it — East 
and West — which will become columns in a pivot table in the following step list.
Here’s how to create a pivot table:
 
1. Open a worksheet from which you want to create a pivot table, such 
as the data in Figure 8-23.
 
2. Click the Pivot button on the Action toolbar.
 
3. From the drop-down menu that appears, choose Create Pivot Table.
 
 The Create Pivot Report dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 8-24.
 
Figure 8-24: 
Name the 
pivot table 
and set its 
data range.
 
 
4. Enter the name of the pivot table.
 
5. (Optional) Enter a description for the pivot table.
 
6. Enter the range of data in the spreadsheet you want to include in your 
pivot table.
 
 In the data range you specify, be sure to include any text you placed at 
the head of any columns to label those columns. The pivot table will 
label its columns using the same column headers.
 
7. Click the Design Pivot button, opening the Design Pivot dialog box 
you see in Figure 8-25.
 
8. Drag the original column (from where it appears at the left in the 
dialog box) whose values you want to become the new columns in the 
pivot table to the Columns box.
 
 That’s the Division column in this example because I want its two items 
(East and West) to become new columns in the pivot table.

the new 
pivot table.
 
 
9. Drag the original column(s) (from where they appear at the left in the 
dialog box) you want to make into rows to the Rows box.
 
 That’s the Names column in this example because I want to give one row 
to each of the salespeople in the pivot table.
 
10. Drag the original column (from where it appears at the left in the 
dialog box) whose values you want to treat as the primary data for the 
pivot table to the Data box at the right.
 
 That’s the Sales column in this example because I want to compute and 
display the total sales.
 
11. Click the Done button to close the Design Pivot dialog box and to add 
the pivot table to the spreadsheet.
 
While you’re designing your pivot table, you can get a preview of what it’ll 
look like at any time by clicking the Click Here to Generate Pivot link in the 
Design Pivot dialog box.
The new pivot table, with a name like Pivot Table1, is given a tab in your 
spreadsheet. To take a look at the pivot table, click its tab. For instance, you 
can see the new pivot table for this example in Figure 8-26.

Online Databases
In This Chapter
▶ Creating a new database
▶ Entering records and saving your data
▶ Working with tables
▶ Sorting and filtering data
▶ Viewing your data
▶ Sharing your data
Z
oho lets you create your own databases with the Zoho Reports applica-
tion. Databases typically organize your data into tables, and a table looks 
something like a spreadsheet.
These table columns are fields in database terminology. The rows contain the 
actual data for the table: records.
You can use Zoho Reports to view the data in your tables in different ways, 
or use a database language like SQL (Structured Query Language) to extract 
data from tables. For example, you might want only the phone numbers of 
those people whose last (or first) name starts with Jam, and by using SQL, 
you could get those records easily.
In this chapter, you take a look at creating new databases, entering data into 
them, and extracting data in various ways. It’s as powerful as any desktop 
database application — and it’s free and online.
Getting Started: Creating a Database
You can find Zoho Reports at http://reports.zoho.com, which is shown 
in Figure 9-1. You can log in with your Zoho username and password (see 
Chapter 1 for more details).

198
Part III: Managing Data 
 
Figure 9-1:
 The main 
page of
 Zoho 
Reports.
 
Before working with the data in a database, you have to create that database, 
and Reports gives you four options (these are available on the home page — 
click the My Home link):
 
✓ Import .XLS, .CSV, .HTML
 
✓ Create Database from Template
 
✓ Enter Data Right Away
 
✓ Create Blank Database
If you use Reports for any length of time, you’ll probably use all these options 
at one time or another. I discuss each option in the sections that follow.
Importing a database
The simplest option for creating a database in Zoho Reports is to have an exist-
ing database you want to import. You can import databases in three formats:
 
✓ XLS format (Microsoft Excel): You can import Microsoft Excel spread-
sheets and convert them into Reports tables. Interestingly, you can’t 
import Microsoft Access databases.
 
✓ CSV format (comma-separated values): Data is held in a plain text field, 
with the extension .csv. Data in it is separated by commas.
 
✓ HTML format: This format contains tables as HTML tables.

199
 Chapter 9: Zoho Reports: Creating Online Databases
Here’s an example that imports a Phones database table. To convert this 
table into HTML format, you place the name you want for the table columns 
at the head of the HTML table, and Reports names the various fields in the 
table using those names.
Name
Phone
Richard
555.4943
Sue
555.5934
Tina
555.6543
Dan
555.4432
Jessica
555.5684
Here’s what the HTML table looks like containing the phone data:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Name</td>
    <td>Phone</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Richard</td>
    <td>555.4943</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Sue</td>
    <td>555.5934</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Tina</td>
    <td>555.6543</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Dan</td>
    <td>555.4432</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Jessica</td>
    <td>555.5684</td>
  </tr>
</table>
To convert this HTML document into a database table in Reports, just follow 
these steps:
 
1. Sign in to Zoho Reports using your Zoho username and password.
 
2. Click the Import .XLS, .CSV, .HTML link, opening the Step 1 of 3: 
Create Database (Import) dialog box you see in Figure 9-2.

200
Part III: Managing Data 
 
Figure 9-2: 
Begin the 
import.
 
 
3. Enter a name for the new database in the Database Name text box.
 
4. From the File Type drop-down list, select the data format of the data 
you’re importing: CSV, XLS, or HTML.
 
5. Click the Browse button and browse to the document you want to 
import from your computer.
 
6. Click Open in the File Upload dialog box.
 
7. Click the Next button, bringing up the second page of the dialog box.
 
 The second page of the dialog box shows an overview of your data in a 
table. If you’re importing from a multiple-sheet spreadsheet, it first asks 
you to select the sheets you want to import; do that, then click Next.
 
 Don’t worry if not all the rows of your data are visible; Reports shows 
only the first few rows here.
 
8. Click the Next button, bringing up the Step 3 of 3: Create Database 
(Import) dialog box, as shown in Figure 9-3.
 
9. Enter a name for your new table in the Table Name text box.

201
 Chapter 9: Zoho Reports: Creating Online Databases
 
Figure 9-3: 
Define the 
table here.
 
 
10. Make sure the data format of the fields is correct in the table itself. If 
it’s not, select the correct data format at the head of each column from 
the drop-down list boxes.
 
 The available formats for fields are
Auto Number
Currency
Date
Decimal Number
Decision Box
E-mail
Multi Line Text

11. Click the Create button.
 
 Zoho Reports displays a summary of your database in a dialog box.
 
12. Click the Close button to create your new database.
 
 Zoho Reports displays a dialog box offering to create a new report (sum-
mary) of your database.
 
13. Click No.
 
 Zoho Reports opens your new database table for editing, as shown 
in Figure 9-4.

base table.
 
Congratulations! You created your first Zoho Reports database table. Keep 
reading to see how to enter and edit new data in the table.
To open the database you just created, click the My Home link to open the 
home page, and a list of your databases by name appears in the left-hand 
pane. Click the name of the database you want to open.
Creating a database from a template
The second easiest way to create a new database is to use an existing 
template — that is, a pre-existing database with built-in tables and fields. 
Zoho Reports offers three built-in templates.
 
✓ Project Manager: Manage your projects and track the tasks in it with 
detailed reporting.
 
✓ Issue Manager: Collect, assign, and track issues/bugs in your develop-
ment projects with detailed reporting.
 
✓ Google Adword Campaign Performance Analysis: Lets you analyze 
Google Adword campaign performance.
Here’s how to create a new database from one of these templates:
 
1. On the Zoho Reports home page (which you can access by clicking the 
My Home link), click the Create Database from Template link (refer 
to Figure 9-1), opening the Create Database from Template dialog box 
shown in Figure 9-5.

203
 Chapter 9: Zoho Reports: Creating Online Databases
 
Figure 9-5: 
Begin to 
create a 
database 
from a 
template.
 
 
2. Enter a name for the new database in the Database Name text box.
 
3. (Optional) Enter a description for the new database in the 
Descrip tion box.
 
4. Select a template, using one of the three radio buttons, in the Choose 
Template box.
 
5. (Optional) If you want the database to be populated with sample data, 
select the Populate with Sample Data check box.
 
 You might want to play around with the database to see if it fits your 
needs before continuing to Step 6.
 
6. Click the Create button.
 
 Zoho Reports opens the new database and displays the available tables, 
as shown in Figure 9-6.
To look at one of the tables in the new database, just click it to open it. For 
example, clicking the Members table opens that table for editing, as shown 
in Figure 9-7.

Creating a database right away
If you can’t wait to start entering your data, the Enter Data Right Away option 
for creating a database is for you. Using this option, you’re presented with a 
blank table almost immediately. You can type your data into the table. Then, 
when you save the table, Reports asks you for a name for the table. Follow 
these steps to create a database right away:
 
1. In Zoho Reports (click the My Home link to get you to the home page 
if needed first), click the Enter Data Right Away link (refer to Figure 
9-1), opening the Enter Data Right Away dialog box.

205
 Chapter 9: Zoho Reports: Creating Online Databases
 
2. Enter a name for the new database in the Database Name text box.
 
3. (Optional) Enter a description for the new database in the Descrip-
tion box.
 
4. Click the Create button.
 
 Zoho Reports opens your new database table, as shown in Figure 9-8.
 
Figure 9-8: 
A new 
empty data-
base table.
 
 
 This new database table is entirely empty and unnamed. When you save 
the table, Zoho Reports asks you for a name.
To name the columns in the new table, double-click the column headers. 
They turn into text boxes, into which you can enter new column names.
Creating a blank database
The most flexible — and also probably the most commonly used option for 
creating a new database — is the Create Blank Database option. This option 
allows you to create a database and customize the fields in each record (that 
is, the columns) before you enter data. That’s the usual procedure for creat-
ing a database table: You design it first, before entering any data.
Here are the steps for creating a blank database:
 
1. In Zoho Reports (click the My Home link to get you to the home page 
first if needed), click the Create Blank Database link, opening the 
Create Blank Database dialog box.
 
2. Enter a name for the new database in the Database Name text box.
 
3. (Optional) Enter a description for the new database in the Descrip-
tion box.
 
4. Click the Create button.
 
 Zoho Reports creates your new database and also opens the Create New 
Table page, as shown in Figure 9-9.

206
Part III: Managing Data 
 
Figure 9-9:
 Table-
creation 
options.
 
 
 The four table-creation options available for blank databases are
 
• Import from .XLS, .CSV, .HTML Files
 
• Using Design View
 
• Enter Data Right Away
 
• Query Table
The most common way of designing a table is with the Design view, which I 
show you in the next section.
Giving Your Data a Home: 
Creating Database Tables
You created a new database, so now it’s time to add a new table to your 
database (unless you already did). The most common way to do this in Zoho 
Reports is to create a blank database and use the table Design view to create 
and customize a new table.
Database tables are where your data goes. As I mention earlier, each row is a 
record, and each column is a field. A data type is associated with each field, 
so you should set that data type (such as plain text, or decimal) when you 
design your table.
Here’s an example. Say that you’re teaching a class on Zoho Reports, and you 
want to keep track of your students’ names and grades in a database table, 
with one column named Name and one column named Grade. In this case, 
determining the data types of both columns is easy. They’ll be plain text 
because names are text, and the students’ grades will be letters.

207
 Chapter 9: Zoho Reports: Creating Online Databases
After you design your table and create it, you can stock your table with data.
As I mention earlier, the usual way to design your own table is when you 
create a blank database in Zoho Reports. When you import a database, the 
tables already exist; when you create a table from a template, Zoho Reports 
creates the tables for you; and when you want to start entering data imme-
diately, Zoho Reports creates a generic table for you, but you still have to 
customize it.
So, for discussion purposes, I show you how to design a table the usual way: 
by starting with a blank database. To create a blank database, follow the 
steps listed in the earlier section, “Creating a blank database.” Those steps 
leave you at the Create New Table page (refer to Figure 9-9), ready to create 
your new table.
Here’s how to design and create your new table:
 
1. Click the Using Design View link in the Create New Table page (refer 
to Figure 9-9), opening the Design view as shown in Figure 9-10.
 
Figure 9-10: 
Design a 
new table.
 
 
2. Enter the name of the new column in the Column Name column.
 
 In Figure 9-10, I use Name to indicate the student’s name.
 
3. Select a data type for the new column in the Data Type column of the 
first row.
 
 By default, Zoho Reports gives every new column the data type Plain 
Text, which is the most common data type.

208
Part III: Managing Data 
 
 To select a different data type, double-click the Data Type item for the 
column you’re creating, and then select the new data type from the 
drop-down list that appears. Here are the possible items in this list:
Auto Number
Currency
Date
Decimal Number
Decision Box
E-mail
Multi Line Text
Number
Percent
Plain Text
Positive Number
 
 You might think you can just click the Data Type row to make the drop-
down list of data types appear, as is standard with other applications. In 
Zoho Reports, you have to double-click it, despite the fact that clicking it 
gives the item a yellow border as it’s selected.
 
4. Specify whether the column is mandatory — that is, must contain data.
 
 The two choices in the Mandatory column are Yes and No (the default 
is No), and you can switch between them by double-clicking the item 
in the Mandatory column and selecting Yes or No from the drop-down 
list. (Again, single-clicking the item only selects it and gives it a yellow 
border, not allowing you to change the setting.)
 
5. (Optional) Enter a default value for the new field in the Default column.
 
 Zoho Reports allows you to give the fields in your new database table 
default values. For example, you could set the default value of a number 
field named Count to 0 or some other value.
 
6. (Optional) Enter a lookup column in the Lookup Column column.
 
 Lookup columns are how Zoho Reports supports relational databases. 
In a relational database, you can tie fields together between tables. For 
example, a column named ID in one table can be a lookup into another 
table with an ID column. To tie tables, double-click the Lookup Column 
column, opening a drop-down list box that lists your other tables and 
the columns in those tables.
 
7. (Optional) Scroll the Design view to the left, displaying two new col-
umns: Formula and Description. You can enter data in these fields as 
follows:
 
• Formula: If you want to enter a formula tying the current field to 
the contents of other fields, double-click the Formula column and 
enter your formula.
 
• Description: You can also add a description of the current field in 
the Description column for the new column.
 
8. To add another new column to your table, click the next cell down in the 
Column Name column and follow Steps 2–7 to create the new column.

209
 Chapter 9: Zoho Reports: Creating Online Databases
 
9. When you’re done designing the rows in your table, click the Save 
icon (the diskette icon at the upper left in Design view).
 
 If you haven’t given the new table a name yet, the Save As dialog box 
opens.
 
10. If warranted, enter a name for your new table in the Save As dialog 
box, as shown in Figure 9-11.
 
 In this example, I’m calling the new table Grades.
 
Figure 9-11: 
Saving a 
new table.
 
 
11. Click OK to close the Save As dialog box.
 
12. Click the X button at the upper right to close the Zoho Reports Design 
view window.
 
 Zoho Reports opens the new table to allow you to enter data.
Entering Data into a Database Table
After you create a table in a database, you’re ready to enter data into the new 
table. You can create a standard or a related table:
 
✓ Standard: A stand-alone table
 
✓ Related: A table the connects to another table
Creating a standard table
To create a standard table, just follow these steps:
 
1. Double-click the cell where you want to enter data.
 
2. When the text cursor appears, enter your data.
 
3. To move to the next lower row, press the down arrow. To move to the 
next column, double-click the cell you want to enter data in.
 
4. Continue Steps 1–3 until all your data is entered, as shown in Figure 9-12.

210
Part III: Managing Data 
 
Figure 9-12: 
Entering 
data into a 
new table.
 
 
5. When you finish adding new data to your table, click Save.
 
 After you save your new table, it’s added to your database.
If you sign out of Zoho Reports and come back later, you can open your data-
base by clicking it in the left-hand pane of Zoho Reports. Doing so opens the 
database, as shown in Figure 9-13.
 
Figure 9-13: 
An open 
database.
 
The tables in the database are listed when you open a database. The Grades 
database table is listed in Figure 9-13.
Clicking a table name in the database opens that table for editing, and you 
can double-click a cell to make a text cursor appear in the cell.
Creating related tables
A lookup column allows you to connect one table with another, creating a 
relational database, where tables are related to each other.
Zoho Reports supports relational databases. Here’s an example, and how to 
implement it. Say that you’re tracking building projects in an aircraft assembly 

211
 Chapter 9: Zoho Reports: Creating Online Databases
plant. You want to keep track of the project name, the ID of the project’s leader, 
and the first name and last name of the project leader in a table:
Project
Leader’s ID
Leader’s First Name Leader’s Last Name
Wings
111
Ed
Lane
Engines
122
Jenna
Carson
Wheels
111
Ed
Lane
Windows
122
Jenna
Carson
This table actually duplicates a lot of data: Ed Lane’s ID, first name, and last 
name appear twice, as do Jenna Carson’s. Wouldn’t it be better if you could 
just refer to the leader of each project simply by ID?
Project
Leader’s ID
Wings
111
Engines
122
Wheels
111
Windows
122
Okay, that means you don’t have to enter the leaders’ first and last names, 
which is easier. But what about when you actually need to find their names? 
You could have a second table, which gives the names of each leader by ID 
like this:
Leader’s ID
Leader’s First Name
Leader’s Last Name
111
Ed
Lane
122
Jenna
Carson
Great. Now the Leader’s ID column ties these two tables together.
In Zoho Reports, you would tie these tables together in this way. Say you 
had the second table already built. When you’re designing the first table and 
adding the Leader’s ID column, double-click the Lookup Column field. A list of 
the other tables in the database appears, with the fields in those tables listed 
under the table names, as shown in Figure 9-14.
Select the lookup column you want, which would be the ID table in the 
second table in this example.

212
Part III: Managing Data 
After you create a lookup column, you can just double-click it when editing 
the table, and Zoho Reports reads the possible values for that column from 
the related table and displays them in a drop-down list. Just select the value 
you want.
 
Figure 9-14: 
Selecting 
a lookup 
column.
 
Making Changes to a Table
Databases aren’t typically static, and you might want to make changes to a 
table’s setup — say, insert new columns or rename a column.
You can make changes to a table when you’re editing the table. First, take a 
look at making changes to the columns in a table, and then the rows.
 
If you have large-scale changes to make to a table, you might want to open it in 
the Design view again. To do that when you’re editing a table, click the Edit 
Design button.
Making changes to the columns
When you’re editing a table and want to make changes to the columns of the 
table, right-click a column header to open a drop-down menu. Here are the 
items in the menu that you can select from:
 
✓ Sort: A submenu with three items appears: Sort Ascending, Sort 
Descending, and Remove Sorting. When you add sorting to a column, all 
the records in your table are sorted using the values in that column.
 
✓ Hide Column: Hides the column from view while you’re editing it but 
doesn’t remove it from the table.

213
 Chapter 9: Zoho Reports: Creating Online Databases
 
✓ Freeze Column: Locks the column from further editing until you 
unfreeze it by selecting this item again. Good to use to avoid inadvertent 
changes to your data.
 
✓ Add Column: Adds a new column to the far right in your table. When 
you select this item, Zoho Reports asks you for the new column’s name 
and data type.
 
✓ Add Formula Column: Allows you to add a new formula column to a 
database table.
 
✓ Format Column: Allows you to format how the column appears when 
you’re editing the table. In particular, a dialog box opens where you can 
choose the alignment of the data in the column when you’re editing the 
table: left, right, or center.
 
✓ Rename Column: Allows you to rename a column. Zoho Reports asks 
you for the new name for the column. Enter the new name and then click 
OK. You can also (optionally) add a description for the column in the 
Description box before clicking OK.
 
✓ Change Datatype: Allows you to change the data type of a column. 
Clicking this item opens a dialog box with a drop-down list of data types. 
After you make your choice, click OK.
 
 Be careful when you change a column’s data type. When you change 
from one data type to an incompatible type — for example, from Email 
Addresses to Currency — you might lose some data.
 
✓ Delete Column: Deletes the column whose header you’re right-clicking.
Making changes to the rows
Besides working with the columns in a table, you can also work with the rows 
in a table. However, the options when you’re editing a table to make changes to 
the rows in the table are limited compared with what you can do with columns.
To make changes to the rows in a table when you’re editing that table, right-
click the row header (which shows a number) and select from one of these 
menu items:
 
✓ Add Row: Add a new row to the end of your database table.
 
✓ Delete Row(s): Delete a row or rows.
 
✓ Delete All Rows: Delete all the rows in your table.
 
When editing a table, you can also add or delete rows in a table using the Add 
or Delete button on the toolbar.

214
Part III: Managing Data 
Sorting and Filtering the Data
in a Database Table
You can handle your data by sorting and filtering it in Zoho Reports. Sorting a 
table does just what it sounds like: You sort records based on the value in a 
particular field. For example, if you have a table of people’s names and want 
to sort on their last name, Zoho Reports can do it for you.
Comparatively, filtering data allows you to apply a specific criterion with 
which you extract matching records in a database.
From A to Z: Sorting data
Sorting data in a table is particularly useful when you have a lot of data in 
long columns in a table. If your columns are 2,482 entries long, it can help to 
sort them based on, for example, customer name.
Say you have a table of projects, and one column contains project names. To 
sort your table based on those names, follow these steps:
 
1. In Zoho Reports, open the database you want (click it in the left- 
hand pane).
 
2. Open the table you want to sort (click it in the left-hand pane).
 
3. Right-click the column header of the column you want to sort on, as 
shown in Figure 9-15.
 
 You could also click the Sort button (upper left, above the table).
 
4. Choose an option from the drop-down menu:
 
• Sort Ascending
 
• Sort Descending
 
• Cancel Sorting
 
 After you make your selection, the table is sorted on the values in 
your column.
Getting selective: Filtering your data
You can also shorten tables considerably by filtering out just the data 
you want. Say you have a table with a number of different projects: The 

215
 Chapter 9: Zoho Reports: Creating Online Databases
DB project, the Show project, the People project, and so on — and there are 
many rows in the table.
 
Figure 9-15: 
Starting a 
table sort.
 
Then say that you get interested in only one project: the DB project. Here’s 
how you can filter the table so that only records whose Project Name column 
contains DB are displayed:
 
1. In Zoho Reports, open the database you want.
 
2. Open the table you want to sort.
 
3. Click the Filter button (above and to the left of the table).
 
4. Choose Create New Filter from the drop-down menu that appears.
 
 A new drop-down box appears at the top of every column, as well as 
these buttons:
 
• Hide
 
• Apply
 
• Clear
 
• Close
 
• Save (New)
 
5. Click the down arrow next to the drop-down list box whose column 
you want to filter, opening this list of items (see Figure 9-16):
 
• Contains
 
• Does Not Contain
 
• Is

Figure 9-16:

criterion.
 
 
6. Select the criterion you want to filter on.
 
7. Enter the data to filter on (such as the word you want the field to con-
tain) in the text box below the drop-down list.
 
8. Click the Apply button.
 
 Zoho Reports filters the table.
You can see how the table in Figure 9-17 was filtered to show only records 
whose Project Name field contains DB.
 
Filtering a table doesn’t actually make any changes to the table until you save 
that table.
To save your filter, click the Save (New*) button and give it a name.

Querying the Data in a Database 
Table with SQL
Sorting and filtering tables can be very useful, but databases can get more 
powerful still with SQL (Structured Query Language). Using SQL, you can set 
your own search criteria, such as phone numbers starting with a certain area 
code, or friends whose last names begin with “M.” That is, SQL allows you to 
customize the way you extract data from a database.
SQL is the database language that lets you do just about everything that you 
can do with databases. You can search for records with fields that contain a 
dollar amount greater than a specific value, for example, or search for books 
that include the word “Germany” in their titles.
Say you have a Grades table, which holds the names and grades of students. 
You want to create a new table, based on the Grades table, that contains only 
the students’ names. To do that, you could use an SQL statement. To create a 
new table from an old one and copy specific columns into the new table, you 
execute an SQL statement — a query — like this:
SELECT “column1”, “column2”, “column3”, “column4” FROM “table”
The SELECT statement creates a new table and copies only column1, 
column2, column3, and column4 (the names of the columns you want to 
add to the new table) from the table named table.

218
Part III: Managing Data 
In this example, you want to retain only the Names column, which makes the 
SQL look like this:
SELECT “Name” FROM “Grades”
To create a new table in Reports based on an SQL query, follow these steps:
 
1. In Zoho Reports, open the database you want.
 
2. Click the New Table button.
 
3. Click the Query Table item.
 
 The [New Query Table]* tab opens, as shown in Figure 9-18.
 
Figure 9-18: 
Creating an 
SQL query.
 
 
4. Enter your SQL query to create a new table, as shown in Figure 9-18 
(where the query is SELECT “Name” FROM “Grades”).
 
5. Click the Execute Query button.
 
 Zoho Reports executes your query and shows the result in a preview 
table, as shown in Figure 9-19.
 
6. If your query worked, click the Save button to save the query.
 
7. Enter a name for the query in the Name text box of the Save As dialog 
box that appears.
 
8. (Optional) Select a folder in which to save the query (in the Save to 
Folder box in the Save As dialog box).
 
9. (Optional) Enter a description of the query (in the Description box in 
the Save As dialog box).
 
10. Click OK to save the query and close the Save As dialog box.
 
 The new query-based table appears as an entry in the list of tables in the 
left-hand pane of Zoho Reports, just like the other tables in the database. 
This way, you can easily execute the query on tables again.

A Window into Your Tables: 
Viewing Your Data
There are different ways to view your tables: in table form, yes, but also in 
other forms, such as charts. Charts are particularly useful — as they say, a 
picture is worth a thousand words. To access these alternate views, click the 
New button right above the table to open these choices:
 
✓ New Tabular View
 
✓ New Chart View
 
✓ New Pivot View
 
✓ New Summary View
The standard: Tabular view
Tabular view — the one you’re already familiar with — is great if you want 
to take a look at your data all spelled out in rows and columns. If you have a 
table whose default form is, say, Chart view, you can also see its data in table 
form by selecting the New Tabular View menu item.
Graphics at work: Chart view
If a table contains numerical data, you can also view it as a chart. This is help-
ful when just looking at lists of numbers isn’t enough; for example, it might be 
better to view your data in a pie chart.

220
Part III: Managing Data 
As I mention earlier, to view data as a chart, open your table and click the 
New button and then choose New Chart View.
Zoho Reports opens a window that asks the color scheme you want, the 
labels for the axes, and other details. When you’re done, click the Click Here 
to Generate Chart link.
Figure 9-20 shows a sample chart with employee data.
 
Figure 9-20: 
A table in 
Chart view.
 
Reorganize data with Pivot view
Pivot views are much like the pivot tables in Zoho Sheet, which you can read 
about in Chapter 8. As I discuss there, pivot tables enable you to reorganize 
your data. For example, say you have a table with 200 rows but only four 
different items in one of the columns. That’s a little awkward. When using a 
pivot table, you can “pivot” how you view the data by giving each of the four 
items their own column, which reduces a lot of redundancy in the table.
To create a pivot table, open the table you want to reorganize, click the New 
button, and choose New Pivot View.
Zoho Reports opens a page that allows you to create a Pivot view by dragging 
columns and rows just like you create pivot tables with Zoho Sheet. For more 
details, take a look at Chapter 8.

221
 Chapter 9: Zoho Reports: Creating Online Databases
Summarizing with Summary view
Summary views are another good way to view your data. As you can tell from 
the name, use this tool to summarize your data. That works by allowing you 
to group data together and then create summaries by group.
For example, say you have a table of sales data, with separate data for four 
sales regions: east, west, north, and south. Using Summary view, you can 
group the four sales regions together and take a look at, for example, total 
sales by age group, gender, price, and so on.
Here’s how to create a Summary view for a table:
 
1. In Zoho Reports, open the database you want.
 
2. Open the table you want a summary of.
 
3. Click the New button.
 
4. Choose New Summary View from the drop-down menu that appears.
 
 This opens the page you see in Figure 9-21, which allows you to create a 
Summary view.
 
Figure 9-21: 
A new sum-
mary table.
 
 
5. Drag the columns you want to group by from the left into the Group 
By box.
 
6. Drag the column whose data you want to summarize into the 
Summarize box.
 
 Zoho Reports displays the new summary table, as shown in Figure 9-21.

222
Part III: Managing Data 
Sharing a Database
Like other Zoho applications, you can share your Report databases with 
others.
 
Unlike other applications, however, there’s actually very little indication that 
someone is sharing your database: no notification pop-up, no e-mails when 
someone else edits your database, and no yellow background on cells that are 
being edited. Perhaps this lack of notification will change.
To share a database, or just a view, with someone else, follow these steps:
 
1. In Zoho Reports, open the database you want.
 
2. Click the Share button.
 
3. Choose Share This View to share the current view, or choose Share 
This Database to share the current database.
 
 The invitation dialog box opens.
 
4. Enter the e-mail addresses of the people you want to share with in 
the Step 1 box.
 
 If you want to share with a group, select the Share with Group check box.
 
5. Select the radio button for the permission you wish to grant: Read 
Only or Read Write.
 
6. (Optional) Edit the invitation e-mail.
 
7. Click the Share button.
The people you’ve shared with get an e-mail like this:
Hi,
Check out my “Grades” Sheet in the link below:
http://reports.zoho.com/ZDBDataSheetView.cc?OBJID=97322
000000004012&STANDALONE=true
Thank you and have a nice day,
sholzner
The people you invited can click the link in the e-mail to open your view or 
database, or they can sign in to Zoho Reports and find your view or database 
on their Shared to Me tab on the Zoho Reports home page (the page that 
shows the four ways to create a database).
And, the people you invited can now share your view or database and also 
make changes. However, as I mention earlier, you won’t get any notification 
of those changes. For example, a student could change her grade!

Part IV
Using Zoho for
Your Business

In this part . . .
Z
oho specializes in business applications, and this part 
takes a look at some very useful apps.
Zoho Projects helps you schedule your team’s projects, 
keeping track of everyone’s progress. You can share 
everything with your team members: timelines, calendars, 
milestones, scheduled tasks, and more.
Use Zoho Invoice to create, track, print, and send (via 
e-mail) your company’s invoices, which you can custom-
ize with your company’s logo.
Zoho CRM is the suite’s customer relationship manage-
ment system: It’s huge! Use this app to track everything 
from potential customers to sales orders when you close 
the deal.

P
roject management isn’t an easy task. If you’re a project manager, you 
assign people their tasks, set up meetings, make sure that everyone 
stays on schedule, and track your team’s progress. If you’re a team member, 
you have to keep checking the schedule to make sure you stay on top of 
things, find out when and where the meetings are, and so on.
Zoho Projects gives you a great project management tool. Using this online 
application, you can set up and manage a project, add team members, sched-
ule meetings and tasks, and (hopefully) keep everyone on track.
You take a look at Zoho Projects in this chapter. From scheduling tasks to 
scheduling meetings, all the project management power you need is right here. 
Projects gives you all that any desktop project manager would give 
you — plus the chance to keep your team coordinated by collaborating online.

Part IV: Using Zoho for Your Business 
It All Begins Here: Getting Started 
With Zoho Projects
To start with Zoho Projects, navigate your browser to http://projects.
zoho.com, as shown in Figure 10-1. Note that you’ll need a Zoho username 
and password to get started (see Chapter 1).
 
Figure 10-1:
 Zoho 
Projects.
 
The first thing Zoho Projects does is ask you to set up a project portal — a 
URL that is easily accessible by the members of your team. Use this form:
http://yourchosenname.projects.zoho.com
where yourchosenname is the name you choose for your portal.
 
Zoho Projects will let you know whether the name you chose is already taken.
After you enter the name for your project portal, click the Create New Project 
button. Zoho Projects sends you an e-mail like this:

If you have yet to sign up for a monthly paid plan, Zoho Projects displays a red 
ribbon at the top of every page you go to, explaining that you can create only 
one project. Click the Hide This link to hide this reminder.
Note the My Home link, also at the upper right in Figure 10-2. That’s a link to 
your Zoho Projects home page, which lists your tasks, meetings, and mile-
stones for all your projects.
You and your team members get a Zoho Projects home page, where you can 
see where you are with all your projects. If you haven’t yet created any proj-
ects, there’s nothing available on your home page. In fact, your home page 
isn’t available yet, either.
Customizing Zoho Projects the 
Way You Like It
The first step in using Zoho Projects is to customize the application’s settings 
before creating any projects. Click the Settings link at the upper right of any 
Zoho Projects page, which opens the Settings page to the General Settings 
tab, as you see in Figure 10-3.

229
 Chapter 10: Zoho Projects: Managing Your Team’s Timeline
 
Figure 10-3: 
The General 
Settings tab.
 
Using the General Settings tab
The General Settings tab includes a number of icons corresponding to the 
settings categories at the left. Clicking those icons displays the available set-
ting options at the right.
Here are the General Settings categories you can use to customize Zoho 
Projects. To open one of these categories, just click its icon:
 
✓ Skins: A skin is a color scheme, and you can customize the look of Zoho 
Projects with the five possible skins you see in Figure 10-3.
 
✓ Language: You can customize Zoho Projects to display in any of 15 lan-
guages. When you click the Language icon, a drop-down box appears 
listing the possibilities. Select the language you want and then click the 
Update Language Settings button.
 
✓ Profile: This section lists your public information, accessible by other 
Zoho Projects users. Here, customize your name (login, full, nickname), 
job title, and phone number (office, residence, and mobile).
 
 When you start with Zoho Projects, it uses your username (sholzner, 
in my case). You might want to change that before giving all your team 
members access to a project.
 
✓ Password: Use to reset your password.
 
✓ Photo: Use to upload an optional photo of yourself.

230
Part IV: Using Zoho for Your Business 
Using the Company Settings tab
On the Company Settings tab (see Figure 10-4), you can set information about 
your company.
 
Figure 10-4:
The
 Company

The categories are
 
✓ Profile: Set your company’s profile, as you can see in Figure 10-4. 
Settings here include your company name, Web address, street, city, 
state, country, zip code, time zone, e-mail, and the project portal URL.
 
✓ Date Format Settings: Use this setting to select 12- or 24-hour time set-
tings as well as the date format (for example, European or US) setting.
 
✓ Logo: Upload a company logo.
 
✓ Powered by Logo: Upload a logo that Zoho Projects displays as 
“powering” your pages.
Creating a New Zoho Projects Project
Creating a new project is simple; just follow these steps:
 
1. Click the New Project link (upper left of the login page), which opens 
the Add Project dialog box you see in Figure 10-5.
 
2. Enter the name for the new project.
 
 In this example, I use the name Midland.

The tabs available on this page are Dashboard; Tasks & Milestones; Calendar; 
Meetings; Documents; Timesheet; Reports; Forums; and Users.
The first tab — Dashboard — is selected by default, and it gives you an over-
view of the current state of your project.
Welcome to the Project dashboard
You can control all aspects of a project from its dashboard, which summa-
rizes your project at a glance, giving you an overview of what’s happening 
with a project. You can see these sections of the dashboard in Figure 10-6:
 
✓ Week Ahead: A day-by-day calendar of upcoming items
 
✓ Recent Documents: Recently used documents

Adding users
The first step in building a project is to set up the users in your project. 
When you create a task, Zoho Projects asks you to list the participants.
To add users to your project, click the Users tab, opening the tab shown in 
Figure 10-7. Then follow these steps:
 
Figure 10-7: 
Add users 
here.
 
 
1. Click the Add User button, opening the Add New User box, as shown 
in Figure 10-8.
 
2. Fill in the new user’s e-mail address.
 
3. Select the new member’s role from the drop-down list box (contractor, 
manager, or employee).
 
 Manager has the most privileges.
 
4. Click the Add User button.
 
Figure 10-8: 
Add a new 
user here.
 

233
 Chapter 10: Zoho Projects: Managing Your Team’s Timeline
After you add your new users, you can see them from the Users tab, as 
shown in Figure 10-9. The R, O, and M labels hold Residence, Office, and 
Mobile phone numbers, respectively.
 
Figure 10-9: 
View users 
here.
 
 
You can also add client users to a project. In the preceding steps, just click 
the Add Client User button instead of Add User. Client users are your business 
clients who might also have a vested interest in how your project is coming 
along. They’re not usually part of your company. For example, a client user 
might be a vendor of some kind.
Getting busy: Adding tasks to a project
After you add a few users and let Zoho Projects know about them, you can 
put them to work with a new task. Tasks are the fundamental building blocks 
of Zoho Projects. You create tasks, assign people to them, add them to task 
lists, and keep track of milestones using tasks.
For example, say you have a task named Create Plan that comes at the begin-
ning of a project. To create such a task and let Zoho Projects know about it, 
follow these steps:
 
1. From your Zoho Projects home page, click the Tasks & Milestones tab.
 
2. Click the New Task button.
 
 This opens the page you see in Figure 10-10.
 
3. Enter the new task’s name.
 
4. If you have a task list set up (I discuss these shortly) to which you 
want to add the current task, select the task list from the Task List 
drop-down list.
 
 Task lists allow you to group individual tasks into collections.

234

5. To indicate the project owner, select that person’s entry from the Project 
Members list box and then click the right-arrow button next to the list.
 
 The user you selected is moved to the Owner box, indicating that that 
person is the project’s owner.
 
6. (Optional) Select the Send Mail Notification check box if you want 
each team member to be notified of the new task.
 
 This check box is selected by default.
 
7. Click the Advanced Options link, opening the bottom half of the page 
shown in Figure 10-10.
 
 Because most tasks have a start date and end date, and/or a priority, 
opening the Advanced Options section is a good idea.
 
8. Enter the project’s start date.
 
9. Set the project’s duration and end date by doing one of the following:
 
• Enter the project’s duration in the Duration field.
 
• Enter the project’s end date in the End Date field.
 
10. Select a priority for the task from the drop-down Priority list.
 
• Normal
 
• Low
 
• Medium
 
• High
 
• None

Creating a task list
When you create a new task, you get the option of adding it to a task list. A 
task list is just what it sounds like: a way of assembling related tasks together. 
In real life, tasks often come in groups, and that’s what task lists are all about.
Using a task list, you can also indicate that tasks are related. For example, 
you might have a task list named Stage 1, which comprises the tasks Create 
Plan, Get Approval, and Launch Stage II.

237
 Chapter 10: Zoho Projects: Managing Your Team’s Timeline
Here’s how to create a task list:
 
1. From your Zoho Projects home page, click the Tasks & Milestones tab.
 
2. Click the New Task List link.
 
 This opens the page you see in Figure 10-13.
 
Figure 10-13:

4. (Optional) If you have milestones related to the task list, select them 
from the Related Milestone drop-down list box.
 
 I talk about milestones shortly.
 
5. Click the Add Task List button.
 
 The new task list is added to the list of tasks on the Tasks & Milestones 
tab of your home page.
 
To add an existing task to a new task list, edit the task to add it to a task list 
(see the preceding section for details), or click the Add Task link that appears 
under the task list on the Tasks & Milestones tab.
A sense of progress: Creating 
project milestones
If you’ve ever worked on a project in a business or academic environment, 
you know that milestones are very important. A milestone is like a marker, 
marking the end of a phase of a project.
You can keep track of where you are in a project and set deadlines with mile-
stones. Milestones get added to a project’s calendar, and the help to keep 
your team on track. You can name milestones, and you can set start and end 
dates for them in Zoho Projects. To add a milestone, follow these steps.

238

Using Your People Skills: 
Managing Your Users
There are all kinds of considerations when it comes to managing people. 
Fortunately, though, managing people in Zoho Projects is pretty easy.
For example, you can change their roles (contractor, employee, or manager), 
add new users, delete users (that is, delete them from the project, not delete 
them in real life, no matter how much we might want to sometimes), and 
e-mail users.
Changing roles
As I mention earlier, the Zoho Project roles you can assign are contractor, 
employee, and manager. (Read about this in the earlier section, “Adding 
users.”) Although people don’t often jump between roles like those in real 
life, if that happens, you can easily make the change in Zoho Projects.
Interestingly, this is the only change you can make to users in a project besides 
deleting them (and, of course, adding or removing them from tasks). As you’d 
expect, you can’t edit other people’s profiles although you can edit your own.
To change a user’s role, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Users tab on your project’s home page.
 
2. Find the user you want.
 
3. Click the pencil icon at the upper right in their box.

240
Part IV: Using Zoho for Your Business 
 
4. From the drop-down list box appears, select the new role.
 
5. Click the Update button that appears.
 
If you click the pencil icon in your own box, your profile will open, and you 
can make edits there, rather than in the drop-down Role box that appears.
Adding a new user
I discuss how to add a user in the earlier section, “Adding users.”
Deleting a user
Life changes, and your team might change as well. Members are called to 
work on other projects, or perhaps they quit. You can remove users from the 
project with a simple click.
Removing a user from a project is similar to adding a user. On the Users tab 
(on the Zoho Projects home page), click the red X in the box belonging to the 
user you want to remove from the project. When Zoho Projects prompts you, 
confirm the removal by clicking OK in the dialog box that opens.
E-mailing a project’s users
Keeping in touch with your team members is essential to any project, and 
you can do that with Zoho Projects, which allows you to e-mail one or all of 
your project’s team members.
To send e-mail to team members, follow these steps:
 
1. From your Zoho Projects home page, click the Users tab.
 
2. Click the Send Message link.
 
3. Enter the e-mail’s subject in the Subject field that appears, and then 
enter the e-mail’s body in the Message field.
 
4. Select the members to e-mail from the To list.
 
 To select multiple members, hold the Ctrl key while you click their user 
IDs in the To field. To select a range of members to e-mail, click the first 
member in the range, move the mouse to the last member in the range, 
press Shift, and then click the last member.
 
5. Click the Send Message button to send the e-mail.

Some Face Time: Setting Up 
Meetings with Zoho Projects
As any team member knows, meetings are a necessity for any project. You 
can schedule meetings among your project members easily with Zoho 
Projects. Here’s how:
 
1. From your Zoho Projects home page, click the Meetings tab.
 
2. Click the New Meeting link to open the page shown in Figure 10-16.
 
Figure 10-16: 
Creating 
a new 
meeting.
 
 
3. Enter the meeting name and then the meeting date and time.
 
4. Click the Advanced Options link to enter the meeting location 
and duration.
 
5. Select a reminder time for your meeting participants from the Remind 
All list.
 
 The default reminder time is On Time, but you can select times from 15 
minutes to one day before the meeting.
 
6. (Optional) If you want to repeat the meeting, select a repetition fre-
quency from the Repeat drop-down list.
 
 If you select a repeat time, you can also select a number of times to 
repeat the meeting from the End After drop-down list.
 
7. Select the project members you want to attend the meeting from 
the Project Members list. Click the right-arrow button to move the 
selected members to the Meeting Participants list.

242
Part IV: Using Zoho for Your Business 
 
8. Click the Schedule Meeting button.
 
 The new meeting appears in the Meetings tab’s Upcoming Meetings tab, 
and it also appears in the Week Ahead calendar on your project’s home 
page, as shown in Figure 10-17.
 
Figure 10-17: 
Meetings 
show on the 
calendar.

Each meeting participant will get an immediate e-mail like this:
Dear Participants,
Team meeting notification
Meeting Title - Strategy Meeting
Meeting Scheduled On - 03-18-2009 11:00 AM
Meeting Scheduled/Organized By - sholzner
And, if you selected a reminder time, the meeting participants also get an 
e-mail at that time as well.
Getting a Long-Term Overview 
with the Built-in Calendar
Zoho Projects is good at giving you reminders of today’s events, and even 
giving you a picture of the week ahead on your home page. But what if you 
need a longer view?
A longer time frame is often necessary to plan your project successfully. You 
might not be able to execute a task on the day it’s scheduled, or you may 
need some time to prepare, for example. How about getting a bird’s-eye view 
of the tasks, milestones, and meetings in your project?
You can do that with the project calendar, which you reach by clicking the 
Calendar tab on the project’s home page. The calendar appears, as shown 
in Figure 10-18.

New Milestone
The days of the month that have already elapsed are shaded in light yellow, 
and tasks, meetings, and milestones are all marked on the calendar. The 
calendar is the tab to check to keep track of your project in the longer term.
 
To view last month’s calendar, or next month’s, just click the arrows that 
appear on either side of the name of the month, at the top of the calendar. 
(Other months are available too, of course — just keep clicking the arrow.)
You can also click any item, milestone, task, or meeting to open that item.
Filtering the Calendar view
If you’re in charge of a big project, there might be more meetings, milestones, 
and tasks than you can handle in the calendar. To simplify things, you can 
filter your calendar by user and by event.
Filtering by user
You can filter the calendar so that only items connected with a specific user 
appear. This gives you a snapshot of how your project appears to a particu-
lar team member, which is a valuable way of looking at things in management 
terms as well as simplifying what you see in the calendar.

244
Part IV: Using Zoho for Your Business 
To see the calendar for a single user only, start on the Calendar tab of the 
Zoho Projects home page. Then follow these steps:
 
1. Click the drop-down list box that appears to the right of the month 
name at the top of the calendar (refer to Figure 10-18).
 
 The drop-down list displays the names of all the project members.
 
2. Select the project member that you want to filter the calendar on.
 
 The calendar displays only the tasks, meetings, and milestones for 
that member.
Filtering by event type
When it first appears, the calendar shows all meetings, tasks, and milestones. 
Because that might well be too much information to absorb at one time, you 
can filter the calendar by type of event.
To filter the calendar to show just meetings, tasks, or milestones, click the 
link you want at the top of the calendar (refer to Figure 10-18). You can dis-
play all meetings, tasks, and milestones; or only one type of event.
Creating events from the calendar
When you’re looking at the overview you get from the calendar, you might 
see that a certain day is perfect for a meeting. Or that a particular task should 
be scheduled on a given day.
Zoho Projects makes your job easier because you can add tasks, milestones, 
and meetings directly from the calendar. Being able to add new events 
directly from the calendar is a very powerful asset of Zoho Projects because 
you can fit events into your calendar while getting an idea of where they fit 
into the whole overview.
From the Calendar tab, hover the mouse over the day to which you want to 
add a task, milestone, or meeting. Click any of the three buttons that appear 
in the day’s box in the calendar (refer to Figure 10-18):
 
✓ New Task
 
✓ New Milestone
 
✓ New Meeting
A new page opens to schedule the corresponding event (with the day 
already filled in).

245
 Chapter 10: Zoho Projects: Managing Your Team’s Timeline
Keeping Track of Time
Setting up tasks, milestones, and meetings is all very well, but if you’re a 
project manager, you also have to keep track of where team members’ time 
is going. For example, say you have a budget and you enlisted contractors to 
help you get your project done. If you’ve used up nearly your whole budget 
but are less than halfway through the project, you’re in trouble. Thus, you 
need to keep track of how much time the members of your team are using. 
After you get an idea where the time is going, you can readjust your team’s 
goals and emphasis to match your resources.
You keep track of time in Zoho Projects with the Timesheet. The Timesheet 
is a shared resource. All project members have access to it, and they can all 
log their time in it. Access the Timesheet from your project’s home page (the 
Timesheet tab).
Project members can keep track of their time with the Timesheet by manu-
ally logging time spent or by letting Project do it for them.
Logging time with the Timesheet
Project members can log their time manually — recording it on the 
Timesheet — with a few simple clicks.
To log time for a particular day, follow these steps. Start on the Timesheet 
tab, which you access from the Zoho Projects home page:
 
1. Click the Log Time button, opening the dialog box you see in 
Figure 10-19.
 
2. Enter the date of the time you want to log.
 
3. Select the task you’re logging time for.
 
4. Enter the number of hours you wish to log.
 
5. (Optional) Enter any notes to explain your log entry.
 
6. Select Billable or Non-billable from the Billing Status drop-down list.
 
7. Click the Add to Timesheet button.
 
 Log Time closes, and the newly logged time is added to the Timesheet.
 
Hover the mouse over a day in the Timesheet, and a button appears at the 
upper left. Click that button (which has a clock on it) to open Log Time, with 
the current date selected.

Logging time with the Projects timer
Zoho Projects also has a built-in timer that lets you click a clock icon to start 
and stop logging time when you work on a task.
To log time using the clock icon, follow these steps:
 
1. From your Zoho Projects home page, click the Tasks & Milestones tab.
 
2. Hover the mouse over the task you want to start working on.
 
 A green clock icon appears to the left of the task name.
 
3. Click the green clock icon to start logging time.
 
 The green clock icon turns red.
 
4. Click the red clock icon to stop logging time on the task.
 
 The red clock icon turns green.
Having Your Say Using Zoho 
Projects Forums
Keeping in touch with your project’s members is essential to the success of 
projects, and Zoho Projects is up to the task. For example, your schedule 
may have changed, and you need to bring everyone up to date. Or you might 
want to share the results of a task with project members.
Zoho Projects supports a project forum that allows you put up posts, to 
which people can comment.

5. Click the Post Comment button.
Generating Reports
Zoho Projects has a built-in way of keeping track of the overall progress of 
your project, task by task, with reports. Reports are generated as Gantt charts 
that show various events as horizontal bars on a timeline. (A Gantt chart dis-
plays a bar chart of a project’s schedule.) You can chart tasks or milestones.

249
 Chapter 10: Zoho Projects: Managing Your Team’s Timeline
Zoho Projects creates reports automatically. To see the reports it prepared 
for your project, follow these steps:
 
1. From your Zoho Projects home page, click the Reports tab.
 
2. To see various reports for your project, click one of the links:
 
• Task - Graph View: Shows a Gantt chart for the tasks in your project
 
• Task - List View: Shows a table of charts and times for the tasks 
your project
 
• Milestone Report: Shows a Gantt chart for your milestones
Working with Documents
Sharing documents with the members of your project can be useful. You 
might have a memo from your boss that the other members of your team 
need to see, for example. You can post any documents that you can upload 
with your browser.
To post a new document to Zoho Projects where the project members can 
get at it, follow these steps:
 
1. From your Zoho Projects home page, click the Documents tab.
 
2. Click the Upload New File link.
 
 This opens the dialog box you see in Figure 10-23.
 
3. Select the file you want to upload: Click the Browse button, navigate 
to the file, select it, and click Open.
 
4. (Optional) Add a comment about the file.
 
5. Add any tags you want to associate with the file.
 
 Tags let you associate keywords with an item, in this case, a file. Tags 
make it easier to search for items by keyword.
 
6. Select the folder to upload the new file from the Select Folder drop-
down list.
 
 By default, the current project’s folder is selected.
 
7. (Optional) If you want to notify any project members of the new 
upload, select them from the Notify This Document To list.

I
f you have a small business and have to bill your customers, Zoho Invoice 
is for you because you can use it to manage setting up and billing custom-
ers. You can use Invoice to track what’s due and what’s been received. You 
can follow the whole invoice lifecycle, from creating invoices to sending them 
to getting paid. You can even automate recurring invoices.
Of course, getting paid is one of the most satisfying parts of any business, 
and Zoho Invoice is there to make the process easier. If you need to invoice 
your customers, you can easily lose track unless you have a clear-cut plan. 
Zoho Invoice gives you that plan. Zoho CRM (discussed in the next chapter) 
handles all customer relations needs, from tracking down leads to setting up 
ad campaigns — and it also lets you create invoices. But if all you want to do 
is invoice your customers, Zoho Invoice is far simpler.
So read on for all this and more, including how to customize Zoho Invoice.

252
Part IV: Using Zoho for Your Business 
Getting Started with Zoho Invoice
To start with Zoho Invoice, navigate your browser to http://invoice.
zoho.com and sign in with your Zoho username and password. (To find out 
how to get a Zoho username and password, see Chapter 1.) When you do, 
you get a confirmation e-mail from a Zoho customer service rep.
When you sign in for the first time, Invoice displays a Quick Setup page that asks 
you for your time zone, currency type, company name, and, optionally, your 
company’s address. Enter that information and click the Start Invoice button.
Next, the Zoho Invoice Welcome page appears, as shown in Figure 11-1.
 
Figure 11-1: 
Start here 
in Zoho 
Invoice.
 
Click to edit a profile.
The Welcome page tells you the steps you need to get started with Zoho 
Invoice. Here, you can do basic tasks, such as setting up your company 
profile, configuring your currency and time zone, and customizing outgoing 
e-mails. You can also quickly add or import products or services you sell, 
your prospects and customers, and invoices and estimates.
 
After you use Zoho Invoice for a while, you probably won’t want to see the 
Welcome page anymore. Just select the Do Not Show at Startup check box.
Although you can use Zoho Invoice gratis, you must pony up monthly for 
more advanced packages, as detailed in Table 11-1. In a nutshell, the differ-
ence between the pricing plans is how many invoices/estimates per month 
you are allowed. Other than this, the only difference is that the free version 

253
 Chapter 11: Zoho Invoice: Billing Your Customers
doesn’t offer unbranded e-mails (e-mails without the Zoho logo). The other 
Invoice features — such as number of customers, template availability, mul-
ticurrency support, customer support, and SSL encryption — are standard 
between packages.

Setting up your company profile
A good thing to do when setting up Zoho Invoice is to customize your com-
pany profile. Your company profile contains information about your com-
pany; that information will appear, well formatted, on your invoices.
To customize your company’s profile, click the Setting Up Your Company 
Profile link on the Welcome page. (Refer to Figure 11-1.) Doing so opens the 
Company Profile page you see in Figure 11-2.
Then follow these steps:
 
1. Enter your company name and industry.
 
2. Enter when your fiscal year starts.
 
3. Enter your mailing information, including street address, city, state or 
province, zip or postal code, and country.
 
4. Enter information about the contact person for your company, includ-
ing that person’s Zoho ID, phone and fax numbers, e-mail address, 
and Web site URL.
 
5. (Optional) If you have additional information you want to record 
about your company, scroll down to the Custom Fields section.
 
 For example, you might have a VAT ID you want to record that must 
appear on your invoices, or a government tracking number.
 
a. Enter the label of each additional piece of information (for example, 
VAT ID) in a Label box.
 
b. Enter the value of each additional piece of information in a Value box.

6. Click Save to save your company’s profile, or click the Save & Next 
button to open the Logo Settings page, which I discuss in the 
following section.
 
 Your company profile is saved. The new profile appears, with all the 
fields filled in.
 
You can edit your company’s profile at any time. Just click the Setting Up Your 
Company Profile link again from the Welcome page, or click the Settings link 
(upper right) on any Zoho Invoice page.
Adding your company logo
Another way to customize an invoice is to add your company logo to Zoho 
Invoice. There are actually two logos that you need to set: the system logo 
and the invoice logo.
 
✓ System logo: This logo appears at the upper left on all Zoho Invoice 
pages. It’s an entirely online thing. Zoho Invoice prefers a file size of 
140px (pixels) x 60px at 72 dpi. The maximum file size is 1MB.
 
✓ Invoice logo: This logo appears at the upper left in all your actual 
invoices. It’s what the customer sees. Zoho Invoice prefers a file size of 
580px x 250px at 300 dpi. The maximum file size is 1MB.

255
 Chapter 11: Zoho Invoice: Billing Your Customers
 
You can provide logo files in JPG, GIF, PNG, or BMP format. Zoho Invoice will 
size the image to fit.
To set your company’s logos, follow these steps. (Remember that you need 
to upload two logos.)
 
1. From the Welcome page, click the Updating Your Logos link to open 
the Logo Settings page you see in Figure 11-3.
 
 Alternatively, click the Settings link on any Zoho Invoice page. Then click 
the Currency & Time link in the left-hand pane.
 
Figure 11-3: 
Add logos 
here.
 
 
2. Click the Change link in the System Logo area.
 
 A text box and a Browse button appear.
 
3. Click the Browse button, opening the File Upload dialog box.
 
4. Navigate to the image file you want to upload, select it, and then click 
the Open button.
 
 The File Upload dialog box closes, and your filename and path appear in 
the text box.
 
5. Repeat Steps 2–4 but click the Change link in the Invoice Logo area.
 
6. Click the Next button to finish adding your logos.
 
 Zoho takes you to the Currency and Time Zone page, which is discussed 
in the following section.

256
Part IV: Using Zoho for Your Business 
Setting your currency and time zone
Invoices are all about money, so it shouldn’t come as a surprise that Zoho 
Invoice wants to know what currency you’re using in your invoices. And as 
far as dates and times on your invoices go, Zoho Invoice wants to know what 
your time zone is.
Those items are easy to set. Just follow these steps:
 
1. From the Welcome page, click the Configuring Your Currency & 
Time Zone link to open the Currency and Time Zone page you see 
in Figure 11-4.
 
 Alternatively, click the Settings link on any Zoho Invoice page. Then click 
the Currency & Time link in the left-hand pane.

2. Select your currency from the Currency Code drop-down list.
 
3. Confirm that the currency symbol is correct for your currency.
 
4. If you don’t like the currency format that Zoho Invoice selected, select 
a different one.
 
5. Select your time zone.
 
6. Select the date format that you prefer.
 
7. Click Save to save your settings or click the Save & Next button to 
move to the Tax Settings page.

257
 Chapter 11: Zoho Invoice: Billing Your Customers
Specifying tax information
No one likes paying taxes, but they’re a fact of life. It’s important to include 
sales taxes on your invoices, if they apply.
To set up sales tax on the Tax Settings page, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Settings link on any Zoho Invoice page. Then click the Tax 
Settings link in the left-hand pane.
 
 The Tax Settings page appears, as shown in Figure 11-5.
 
Figure 11-5:

2. Specify your tax ID.
 
3. Specify a tax percentage.
 
4. Specify what the tax should be applied to: the billing amount 
(ItemAmount) or the billing amount plus the tax (ItemAmount + 1).
 
5. Repeat Steps 2–4 for up to three taxes (for example, federal, state, 
and local).
 
6. Click Save to save the tax information, or click the Save & Next button 
to save the tax information and go on to the templates for the estimates.
Telling Zoho Invoice About 
Your Customers
Before you can send invoices to your customers, you have to give Zoho Invoice 
the details about those customers. Start by adding all your customers to Zoho 
Invoice, which keeps track of them and helps you create invoices with ease.

258
Part IV: Using Zoho for Your Business 
 
Zoho Invoice makes a distinction between customers and clients:
 
✓ Customer: A business that buys from you
 
✓ Contact: A person in a company that you can actually talk to
Manually adding customers
To add a customer to Invoice, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Customers tab on any Zoho Invoice page, which opens the 
Active Customers page that you see in Figure 11-6.

If you click the link to that customer, the Customer Details page opens for 
that customer (refer to Figure 11-8).
The next time you click the Customers tab, you see an overview of the new, 
active customer, as shown in Figure 11-9.
Importing customers
You don’t need to go through the rigmarole of adding new customers manu-
ally. If you have your customers’ details in a spreadsheet or table, you can 
import those details directly.

 Chapter 11: Zoho Invoice: Billing Your Customers

tab.
 
Import customers from here.
 
Your spreadsheet has to be formatted so that each cell has the label that Zoho 
Invoice expects for that field (matching what you see in the Add New 
Customer page), like this:
Customer Name 
Southwest County Manufacturing
Payments Terms
Net12
Currency Code
USD - US Dollar
First Name
Sam
Last Name
Prellwitz
E-mail
sam@sampleemail.com
Office Phone

You can import your data in two formats:
 
✓ CSV: Comma-separated values
 
✓ TSV: Tab-separated values
To import customers in either format, simply follow these steps:
 
1. Save your customer information spreadsheet in CSV or TSV format.
 
2. Click the Customers tab on any Zoho Invoice page.
 
3. Click the Import Customers link. (Refer to Figure 11-9.)

262
Part IV: Using Zoho for Your Business 
 
4. On the Import Customers page, click the Import link next to either the 
CSV or the TSV entry, as appropriate.
 
5. Click the Browse button.
 
6. Navigate to your CSV or TSV file using the Upload File dialog box 
that appears.
 
7. Select the file to upload and then click Open.
 
 The File Upload dialog box closes, and Zoho Invoice automatically 
imports the file you selected.
You can also import customers from Zoho CRM (Customer Relationship 
Management; see Chapter 12). To do that, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Customers tab on any Zoho Invoice page.
 
2. Click the Import Customers link.
 
3. On the Import Customers page, click the Import from Zoho CRM link.
 
4. Enter your Zoho CRM username.
 
5. Enter your Zoho CTM API key.
 
 To get your API Key, sign in to Zoho CRM with administrative privileges, 
choose Setup➪Request API Key, and follow the instructions there.
 
6. Click the Save & Import button.
Importing contacts
Just like you can import customers, you can import contacts as well. For 
example, if a contact sends you an e-mail with a vCard attachment, you can 
import that card directly into your contacts.
You can import contacts in four formats:
 
✓ CSV (Comma Separated Value): CSV format
 
✓ TSV (Tab Separated Value): TSV format
 
✓ vCard: VCF format
 
✓ Outlook Express CSV: CSV format
To import a contact, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Customers tab on any Zoho Invoice page.
 
2. Click the Active Contacts link in the left-hand pane.

263
 Chapter 11: Zoho Invoice: Billing Your Customers
 
3. Click the Import Contacts link.
 
 You can also access the Import Contacts link from the Customer Details 
page; click the Edit Customers link and then click the Import Contacts link.
 
4. On the Import Contacts page (see Figure 11-10), click the Import link 
next to the format of the data you want to import.
 
5. Click the Browse button that appears.
 
6. In the File Upload dialog box that opens, browse to the file you want 
to upload, select it, and click Open.
 
 The File Upload dialog box closes, and Zoho Invoice uploads your file 
and imports the contacts immediately.
 
Figure 11-10: 
The Import 
Contacts 
page.
 
 
You can also export your contacts (for example, suppose that someone in the 
shipping department needs them). Just click the Export Contacts link at the 
top of the Edit Customers page.
Editing customers and contacts
Things change, and so do customers and contacts.
For example, a customer might move to a new address. Or your contact 
might move to a new department. In either case, you need to edit the cus-
tomer’s details.

264
Part IV: Using Zoho for Your Business 
Editing a customer’s details is a snap; just follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Customers tab on any Zoho Invoice page.
 
2. On the Active Customers page that opens, click the name of the 
customer whose details you want to edit.
 
3. On the Customer Details page that opens (refer to Figure 11-8), click 
the Edit Customer link at the upper left.
 
 You can also click the pencil icon in the customer’s entry that appears 
on the Active Customers page that opens when you first click the 
Customers tab.
 
4. Make the edits you want to the customer’s details.
 
5. Click the Save Customer button.
Deactivating and reactivating customers
At some point, you might lose a customer. Perhaps the company goes out 
of business. In that case, you might have to make that customer’s record 
inactive in Invoice.
It’s simple to deactivate customers. When you make a customer inactive, 
they are moved to the Inactive Customers folder.
To deactivate a customer, start on the Active Customers page. There, select 
the check box(es) next to the customer(s) you want to make inactive and 
then click the Make Inactive button.
Zoho Invoice moves the customer(s) to the Inactive Customers folder. To 
make an inactive customer active again, select the check box to the left of the 
inactive customer in the Inactive Customers folder and then click the Make 
Active button.
Deleting contacts
You can also delete contacts. Just follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Customers tab on any Zoho Invoice page.
 
2. On the Active Customers page that opens, click the Active Contacts 
link in the left-hand pane.
 
3. On the Active Contacts page that appears, click the pencil icon in the 
entry of the contact you want to edit.

265
 Chapter 11: Zoho Invoice: Billing Your Customers
 
4. On the Customer Details page that opens, click the red X icon to the 
left of the contact you want to delete.
 
 Zoho Invoice deletes the contact immediately.
 
 When you delete a contact, Invoice doesn’t display a dialog box asking 
for confirmation: It just deletes the contact immediately.
 
5. Click the Save Customer button.
Creating Your Inventory
Before you can send out estimates or invoices, you have to tell Invoice about 
the items you sell. Those items can be either goods or services — it makes no 
difference to Invoice.
Setting up new items in your inventory isn’t hard. Just follow these steps:
 
1. In Zoho Invoice, click the Items tab.
 
2. Click the New Item button.
 
3. On the Add New Item page that opens (as shown in Figure 11-11), 
enter a name for the item.
 
Figure 11-11: 
The Add 
New Item 
page.
 
 
4. (Optional) Enter a description for the item.
 
5. Enter a rate (price per item) for the item in the currency you already 
selected when you first signed in to Zoho Invoice.
 
6. Select up to two taxes that apply to the item.
 
7. Click the Save Item button.
 
 The form is cleared in preparation for more new items.
 
8. After you finish entering new items, click the Close button.
 
 The new item is displayed on the Items tab, as shown in Figure 11-12.

Getting Paid: Selecting 
a Payment Gateway
After you set up your inventory, you can also set up your payment gateway — 
that is, the folks who will handle your payments, such as PayPal.
 
Zoho Invoice can include a link in any estimates or invoices you mail to cus-
tomers. If you include such a link, your customers can pay online simply by 
clicking the link.
Currently, Invoice lets you insert an online payment link for these payment 
services:
 
✓ PayPal (www.paypal.com)
 
✓ Google Checkout (http://checkout.google.com)
 
✓ Authorize.Net (www.authorize.net)
To have Invoice add an online payment link to any of these services, just 
follow these steps:
 
1. In Zoho Invoice, click the Settings link (at the upper right).
 
2. In the left-hand pane, click the Payment Gateways link.
 
 This opens the Online Payment Settings page you see in Figure 11-13.

267
 Chapter 11: Zoho Invoice: Billing Your Customers
 
Figure 11-13: 
The Online 
Payment 
Settings 
page.
 
 
3. Enter the appropriate information for any payment gateways that apply:
 
• For PayPal: PayPal E-mail ID and (optionally) Page Style
 
• For Google Checkout: Merchant ID and Merchant Key
 
• For Authorize.Net: API LoginID and Transaction Key
 
4. Click Save.
 
 Zoho Invoice inserts an online payment link in your e-mails.
Customizing Your E-mail Notifications
Zoho Invoice sends out e-mail notifications of your new estimates and 
invoices, and you can customize the e-mails it sends. Invoice also lets you 
send out other types of e-mail, such as reminders and general messages.
Invoice provides you with a template for its e-mail notifications. In the tem-
plate, the fields that will be filled when the e-mail is sent are surrounded by 
percent signs (%), such as %LastName% for a contact’s last name.
Here’s what the e-mail notification template looks like for an estimate:
Hi %FirstName% %LastName%,
Thanks for your interest in our services. We are pleased to attach our 
price quote with this e-mail.
Feel free to give us a call at %CompanyPhone% or e-mail <a href=”
mailto:%CompanyEmail% “>%CompanyEmail% </a> for any clarification.
Assuring you of our best services at all times.

268
Part IV: Using Zoho for Your Business 
And here’s what the e-mail notification template looks like for invoices:
Hi %FirstName% %LastName%,
Thanks for using our services. Attached is the invoice for the P.O.# 
%P.O.Number%. Please forward it to the relevant person to process the 
payment.
To make a payment online, click on the following link - %PayPalLink%.
Feel free to give us a call at %CompanyPhone% or e-mail <a href=”
mailto:%CompanyEmail% “>%CompanyEmail% </a> for any clarification.
Assuring you of our best services at all times.
 
You can also send a payment-received notice. Read how in the upcoming sec-
tion, “Happy Days Are Here Again: Marking an Invoice as Paid.”
Editing these templates is easy. Just follow these steps:
 
1. In Zoho Invoice, click the Settings link.
 
2. In the left-hand pane, click the Estimate Notification link or the 
Invoice Notification link, depending on which e-mail template you 
want to customize.
 
 This opens the Estimate Notification page or the Invoice Notification 
page, respectively.
 
3. Edit the e-mail or invoice template.
 
4. Click Save.
Getting New Business: Creating

hen you’re involved in business, keeping your customers happy 
is critical to your success. And that’s what Zoho CRM (Customer 
Relationship Management) is all about. With Zoho CRM, you can automate 
the whole sales process from getting leads to closing the sale. It’s a complete 
sales and marketing tool.
Using Zoho CRM gives you these advantages:
 
✓ Sales and marketing: Coordinate sales and marketing by connecting 
sales with ad campaigns, lead monitoring, sales forecasts, and more.
 
✓ Customer support: Zoho CRM supports handling of cases and solutions 
to help you handle customer service with ease.
 
✓ Inventory management: Monitor your products with a complete inven-
tory management system.
 
✓ Role-based security: Control access to data by user roles.
 
✓ Reports: Track sales and marketing trends with built-in reports and 
interactive dashboards.

276
Part IV: Using Zoho for Your Business 
Choosing the Right CRM Edition
Zoho CRM is record-oriented, allowing you to enter sales leads, track custom-
ers, as well as track inventory. Three plans are available for Zoho CRM, giving 
you different levels of customer relationship–management power. Here are 
the three editions, each of which offers different levels of tools (see the Zoho 
CRM page for more details):
 
✓ Free Edition: You get salesforce and marketing automation, inventory 
management, a calendar, reports, a dashboard, batch importing of up 
to 1,500 records, and up to 100MB of disk space. This edition is free for 
three users.
 
✓ Professional Edition: Includes all the features that the Free Edition con-
tains, plus disk space of 250MB, batch importing of up to 10,000 records, 
e-mail marketing, Web forms to handle data, and more. Cost is $12 per 
user per month.
 
✓ Enterprise Edition: This edition offers all that the Professional Edition 
gives you, plus 500MB of disk space, batch importing of up to 20,000 
records, and additional tools. Cost is $25 per user per month.
You can see a comparison of the three plans at www.zoho.com/crm/
zohocrm-pricing.html.
 
No matter what plan you select, the first three users are free. After that, you’ll 
pay per user.
Creating Your Zoho CRM Account
To get started with Zoho CRM, create a new account. You can start with your 
Zoho account, but Zoho will create a new account especially for Zoho CRM. 
(For more information about creating a Zoho account, see Chapter 1 — and 
note that you’ll also have to create a Zoho CRM account to use CRM.)
To start with Zoho CRM, follow these steps:
 
1. Navigate your browser to http://crm.zoho.com, and enter your 
Zoho username and password.
 
2. Click the Sign In button.
 
 Zoho CRM displays a warning message (see Figure 12-1) stating that 
if you already have a Zoho CRM account, you should click the Cancel 
button and log in with your existing user ID.
 
3. To create a New Zoho CRM account, click the Continue button.

277

4. Choose which Zoho CRM plan you want.
 
 Read about your three edition choices in the preceding section.
 
5. Respond to the Zoho CRM query for the CRM Requirements field.
 
 This step is required. You must enter some text indicating what you 
want in a CRM application. Zoho presumably uses this information to 
improve Zoho CRM.
 
6. Click Continue.

Click to see more tabs.

278
Part IV: Using Zoho for Your Business 
Getting a Look at the 
Zoho CRM Interface
The first thing you notice about Zoho CRM is the number of tabs at the top, 
including Home, Leads, Contacts, Campaigns, and the like — all items you 
need to professionally manage your customer relations.
As if that weren’t enough, nine more tabs are available from a drop-down 
menu that opens when you click the down arrow at extreme right of the last 
tab (the Activities tab). These tabs include Products, Vendors, Sales Orders, 
Invoices, and more. If this seems like tab overload, I show you how to cus-
tomize them in the upcoming section, “Hiding tabs.”
Directly underneath the tabs are links you use to create new items. These 
items are the components you use to create new projects in CRM, such as 
new leads, accounts, and even advertising campaigns. And more new item–
creation links appear when you click the down arrow to the right of the links 
bar, including New Case, New Quote, New Sales Order, and others.
Zoho CRM keeps track of what’s going on in terms of tasks. A task can be cre-
ating a new sales lead, creating a purchase order, and so on. You can see that 
the biggest section in the main window of Zoho CRM is Open Tasks. That’s 
where you keep track of what’s going on.
Underneath the Open Tasks section are the Todays Leads section (for hot 
customer leads you’re tracking down) and the Closing This Month section (to 
keep track of deals that need your attention).
In the left pane of Zoho CRM are four sections:
 
✓ Search: Searches through all your records
 
✓ Recent Items: Keeps track of the most recent items you’ve been working 
on, with links to each item
 
✓ Quick Create: Gives you a drop-down list box from which you can create 
the same items that you can from the new items links discussed earlier
 
✓ Calendar: Shows what’s coming up in your CRM efforts

279
 Chapter 12: Zoho CRM: Managing Your Customers
Customizing Zoho CRM
Zoho CRM has hundreds of items you can customize when you start setting 
up customer accounts. One of the quickest things to customize first are the 
tabs that appear in CRM, which you can hide, rearrange, and rename. You 
can even add new components, which are mini-applications you can add to 
your CRM home page.
Hiding tabs
You’re probably not going to need all 19 tabs. Here’s how to hide the tabs 
you don’t need (note that you can’t hide the Home tab):
 
1. Click the Setup link at the top of any Zoho CRM page.
 
2. Click the Organize Tabs link.
 
 The Organize Tabs page appears, as shown in Figure 12-3, where you 
can hide tabs.
 
Figure 12-3: 
Hide tabs 
here.
 
Click to customize CRM.

280
Part IV: Using Zoho for Your Business 
 
3. To hide a tab, follow these steps:
 
a. From the Selected Tabs list, select the tab(s) you want to hide.
 
b. Click the left-pointing arrow.
 
c. Click Save to close the Organize Tabs page.
 
 To restore a hidden tab, revert the process. Select it from the 
Unselected Tabs list and then click the right-pointing arrow.
 
4. Click the Home tab to get back to the home page.
Rearranging and renaming tabs
You can also rearrange and rename tabs from the Organize Tabs page. Like 
deleting a tab, first select the tab from the Selected Tabs list (as described in 
the preceding section). Then do the following to rearrange a tab:
 
1. To reorder the tabs, click the up arrow next to the Selected Tabs list 
to move a tab higher in the list; click the down arrow to move a tab 
lower in the list.
 
2. Click Save.
You can also rename tabs. Click Rename Tabs from the Setup page, and then 
click the Edit link next to the tab you want to rename. Enter the new name 
and click the Save button. Note that you cannot rename the Home tab.
Adding and deleting components
Zoho CRM is a big application, and not everything can fit on the home page 
at once. Each item on the home page is a component — such as Open Tasks 
and Todays Leads — but you can customize Zoho CRM by adding more com-
ponents. The advantage to adding a new component is that you can watch 
some aspect of Zoho CRM, such as the campaigns you have running or the 
products you’re offering.
Here’s how to add a new component:
 
1. In Zoho CRM, click the Add Component link at the top right of the 
home page.
 
 This opens the Add Component dialog box you see in Figure 12-4.

281
 Chapter 12: Zoho CRM: Managing Your Customers
 
Figure 12-4:
 Add a 
component 
here.
 
 
2. Select the new component from the Module drop-down list in the 
Add Component dialog box. The choices include Leads, Accounts, 
Campaigns, Forecasts, and others.
 
 The Add Component dialog box expands to show the Select Custom 
View section, as shown in Figure 12-5.
 
Figure 12-5: 
Choose a 
custom view 
for the new 
component.
 
 
3. Enter the name you want to give to the component.
 
 This name will appear in the component’s title bar.
 
4. Select how many columns you want the component to display.
 
5. Select the custom view you want the component to display.
 
 All components have multiple views, displaying different data, and the 
drop-down list box will be populated with the view choices available for 
the component you selected. For example, the Leads view lets you see 
current leads.
 
6. Click Save to add the component.

282
Part IV: Using Zoho for Your Business 
 
There’s no Cancel button in the Add Component dialog box. If you want to 
cancel the operation and not complete the process of adding a component, 
click the X button in the upper right of the dialog box to close it.
Dozens of components and views are available in Zoho CRM. To get an idea of 
which ones might be useful for you, experiment with the Add Component link.
To remove a component from the home page, click the X button at the upper 
right in the component.
Getting People Involved: 
Managing Users
CRM users are the people you work with: folks in sales, marketing, inventory, and 
so on. To let them work with Zoho CRM, you have to let CRM know about them.
First, you add users. Then, you let Zoho CRM know what the users do in your 
organization — that is, you set (specify) their role. You can specify a user’s 
role in your company when you add new users. After that, you can set a 
user’s profile, which indicates the user’s access to certain information, such 
as modules, records, and so on.
Adding new users
To add new Zoho CRM users, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Setup link at the top of any Zoho CRM page.
 
2. Click the Users link (in the Admin Settings section).
 
 This opens the Users page, which shows the current users in Zoho CRM. 
Out of the gate, that’s just you.
 
3. Click the Add User button.
 
 This opens the page you see in Figure 12-6.
 
 Up to now, your account has been a personal account. Now that you’re 
adding new users, though, Zoho CRM upgrades your account to a com-
pany account automatically.
 
4. To begin the upgrade of your account, enter your company name.

Creating new roles
After you create a new user, you can create a new role (which specifies the 
user’s role in your company). To create a new role, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Setup link at the top of any Zoho CRM page.
 
2. Under Admin Settings, click the Roles link.
 
 If you don’t see the Roles link, you haven’t added at least one new user 
to Zoho CRM. See the preceding section.
 
3. In the Roles page that opens, click the New Role button.
 
 If you’re using the Free Edition, you’ll get an error message saying you 
can’t create new roles and inviting you to upgrade.
 
4. In the New Role page that opens, enter the name of the new role.
 
5. Select the role immediately above the role you’re creating.
 
 CRM uses this information to set up a hierarchy.
 
6. Choose whether users in this role can share data with others in this 
role.
 
7. (Optional) Enter a description of the role.
 
8. Click Save.
Assigning a role to a user
After you create a role, you can assign it to users. Just follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Setup link at the top of any Zoho CRM page.
 
2. Under Admin Settings, click the Users link.
 
3. On the Users page that opens, click the name of the user whose role 
you want to change.
 
4. On the User Details page that opens, click the Edit button (at the 
bottom).
 
 This opens the Edit User Details page, as shown in Figure 12-7.
 
5. Click the button next to the Role field.
 
 A window opens, displaying the available roles.
 
6. Click the role you want to assign to the user.
 
 The window displaying the roles closes.
 
7. Click Save.

Creating a profile
Profiles specify the access levels of your users. Using a profile, you can con-
trol which records — and even which fields in a record — users have access 
to. Zoho CRM comes with two built-in profiles:
 
✓ Administrator: Users with an Administrator profile have full data access 
privileges in Zoho CRM. They can manage users, roles, profiles, and data 
sharing with no restrictions.
 
✓ Standard: Users with a Standard profile have no privileges with regards 
to users, roles, profiles, and data sharing.
The Free Edition can have only 3 profiles, the Professional Edition can have 
10, and the Enterprise Edition can have 25.
To create a new profile, follow these steps:
 
1. Click Setup, and then, under Admin Settings, click Profiles.
 
 The Profiles page opens, showing the profiles you already have.
 
2. Click the New Profile button.
 
 This opens the New Profile page, as shown in Figure 12-8.
 
3. Enter the name of the new profile.
 
4. Select a profile to “clone.”
 
 When you create a new profile, you start by cloning an existing profile. 
Then you modify its access settings.

 This displays all permissions as check boxes, as you see in Figure 12-10.
 
8. Make the edits you want to the profile’s permissions. You set permis-
sions for items such as Leads, Accounts, Contacts, and so on.
 
 You can set each of these items to specify whether a tab will be visible 
for users with the new profile; whether users can view the item; and 
whether users can create, edit, and delete new instances of the item.
 
9. Click Save.

All about Zoho CRM Modules
After you add new users and assign them new roles, it’s time to start creating 
your own campaigns in Zoho CRM. That starts with an understanding of Zoho 
CRM modules, which are like mini-applications you can use in Zoho CRM.
The various sections of Zoho CRM — marketing, sales, inventory, and so 
on — are all supported by modules. There’s one tab per module. For exam-
ple, when you create a new marketing campaign, you use the Campaigns 
module. You name the new campaign and then create records in the cam-
paign corresponding to the tasks in the campaign.
Zoho CRM has about two dozen modules, from Campaigns to Vendors, from 
Leads to Accounts. Fortunately, you work with all the modules in more or 
less the same way: You create a new campaign, for example, and add new 
records to it, just like you do with the other types of modules.
To get a clearer picture of how Zoho CRM works, this section gives you an 
overview of the Zoho CRM modules. Then you find out how to work with a 
specific module in the section “Putting a Zoho CRM Module to Work,” later in 
this chapter.
Welcome to the Marketing modules
You use the CRM Marketing modules to create new marketing campaigns, 
new events, and so on. Here are the modules in this group and what they do 
(to access one of these modules, just click its tab):
 
✓ Campaigns: This is a big one! A new marketing campaign lets you 
specify marketing objectives, mark whether they’ve been reached, track 
costs, and compare costs with other campaigns.

288
Part IV: Using Zoho for Your Business 
 
✓ Events: Events are like tasks: They’re used in sales, marketing, and other 
modules. Events keep track of a promotion of some kind, recording the 
location, date, time, and so on. Like tasks, they appear in the activities 
tab. Create new events from the Campaigns tab.
 
✓ Tasks: You add tasks to all sorts of modules, whether in sales, market-
ing, or whatever. In Zoho CRM, tasks allow you to keep track of some-
thing you have to do on a specific schedule. Add as many tasks to Zoho 
CRM as you like; they appear on the Activities tab. Create new tasks 
from the Campaigns tab.
Welcome to the Sales modules
Businesses know that they survive on sales, and Zoho CRM has plenty of 
modules here. From tracking sales leads to creating sales forecasts, it’s all 
here (to access one of these modules, just click its tab):
 
✓ Accounts: Keep track of your existing customers with this module. You 
can track sales history, contact information, and outstanding balances.
 
✓ Contacts: Leads are potential customers; contacts are current customers 
(the contact people at your customers’ companies). You can track con-
tact information as well as associate contacts with a specific account, 
and track campaigns that generated the contacts.
 
✓ Forecasts: Track sales history and expected future sales with this 
module. Sales reps and managers can use this module to see whether 
they’re on track to meet a quota.
 
✓ Leads: Track contact information of sales leads and product interest. 
Leads can be generated by marketing campaigns, trade shows, and 
more. The Leads module helps you make sure no leads get away.
 
✓ Potentials: Compared with the Leads module, the Potentials module 
is much more general, letting you target whole groups and track them 
all the way to closing the deal. You can track sales probability and 
expected revenue as well.
 
✓ Quotes: Your business will give different quotes to different potential 
customers, and you need to track those quotes. With this module, keep 
records of quotes for easy reference.
Welcome to the Inventory 
and Ordering modules
In any business, you have to keep track of where the money is going. How 
much is coming in, and how much is going out? To whom? For what? 

289
 Chapter 12: Zoho CRM: Managing Your Customers
Managers can keep track of the money flow with the modules discussed in 
this section.
And almost as important as tracking money is tracking inventory: How much 
do you have of what you sell? Where are the bottlenecks in production? What 
do you need more of, and what do you have too much of? With these mod-
ules, you can manage your production easily.
Here are the modules in this section:
 
✓ Invoices: With this module, you track your outstanding billings. Keep tabs 
on what invoices have been paid, and which have not. You can record the 
full details on each invoice: dates, line-by-line items, and mode.
 
✓ Price Books: This is where you keep track of the prices of what you have 
to offer. This module tracks unit prices as well as list prices. The unit 
price is a fixed price, and the list price may change, depending on the 
customer and the volume of the sale.
 
✓ Products: Use this module to organize the products you have for sale. 
Each record in the module corresponds to a different product. This 
module records prices and product specification. Use this module to 
keep your sales reps up to date at all times.
 
✓ Purchase Orders: This module is for purchases your company makes, 
ensuring you don’t duplicate orders, and recording the full terms of each 
purchase order. Track invoices and shipments against your own records.
 
✓ Sales Orders: Here’s where you track the purchases your customers are 
making. Use this module to record the full details of any purchase order, 
specifying price, number, delivery dates, and more.
 
✓ Services: This module keeps your salesforce up to date on the services 
your company offers. You can record all the details of the services you 
have to sell, and the module makes it easy to create invoices for those 
services as well as coordinate your sales reps.
 
✓ Vendors: Use this module to track your suppliers and what you pur-
chase from them. It’s like an address book with space for data on what 
you purchase from each vendor and descriptions.
 
To customize quotes, invoices, purchase orders, and sales orders that you 
send to your customers, take a look at the templates that come with Zoho 
CRM. Click the Setup link in any Zoho CRM page, and then look in the tem-
plates section.
Welcome to the Customer Support modules
As important as sales and marketing are, you have to keep your current cus-
tomers happy so that they’ll become future customers as well. This section 

290
Part IV: Using Zoho for Your Business 
contains modules that let you deal with customer support, tracking customer 
issues and your resolutions.
Here’s what’s in this module:
 
✓ Cases: Keep track of customer issues. This module lets you assign indi-
vidual case numbers and record the issue and all your responses to it, 
even as it’s bumped up the chain of command.
 
✓ Solutions: This module contains a database of solutions to common 
problems. There’s no need to solve each customer issue more than once 
if a solution already exists. This database is the one that your customer 
support staff can use to get what they need before creating a case for a 
specific customer issue.
Welcome to the Data Analysis modules
Data crunching is a good way to keep track of where your business is headed, 
and the Data Analysis modules give you ways of comparing data and spotting 
patterns. You can look at your data in tabular form with reports, or in chart 
form with the Zoho dashboards.
Here are the modules in this section:
 
✓ Dashboards: The Dashboards module allows you to create graphs of 
your data. For example, you can compare the performance of various 
sales reps, or chart how your sales have fared quarter to quarter.
 
 This module uses Flash to create its charts, so I recommend having the 
latest version of Flash installed on your machine.
 
✓ Reports: This module lets you track data to spot trends early on. More than 
40 reports are built in to Zoho CRM, and you can also create your own.
Putting a Zoho CRM Module to Work
Zoho modules have many similarities. Although the data they work with dif-
fers from module to module, how you work with that data is usually very 
much the same.
Modules are all record based: You can create, edit, and delete records. You 
can search through and organize your records in a module. You can graph 
them, create reports, and more.
Start by looking at one of the most popular modules: the Marketing 
Campaign module.

291
 Chapter 12: Zoho CRM: Managing Your Customers
Dissecting a module
The Campaigns module is typical of Zoho CRM modules. To access a module, 
click the tab corresponding to that module. You can see the Campaigns tab 
in Figure 12-11.
 
Figure 12-11:
 The Zoho 
CRM 
Campaigns 
module.
 
At the top of the tab is the New Campaign button, with which you create a 
new campaign. Each new campaign will represent a new record in the module.
That’s the usual way things work in a module: Each item in a module is a 
record. For example, a new invoice in the Invoices module is a new record in 
that module, and a new vendor in the Vendors module is a new record in that 
module. Each module usually has a button at the top center to let you create 
a new record, which is what the New Campaign button lets you do here.
Directly beneath the New Campaign button is a set of alphabetic links (letters 
A–Z), which you use to easily find records (in the Campaigns module, these 
correspond to marketing campaigns) based on their names.
Below the alphabetic links is the View bar, which Zoho CRM modules also 
usually offer. This bar lets you filter the records in the module by specifically 
searching for matches as well as letting you select all records marked as active.
Underneath the View bar is the section that displays your campaigns. Each 
campaign (that is, each record) gets a line here. This section lists each cam-
paign’s name, type, status, start date, and end date.
Beneath the section that lists your campaigns, you find links to tools and 
reports, which is typical for a Zoho CRM module.

292
Part IV: Using Zoho for Your Business 
Creating a new record in a module
To create a new record in a Zoho CRM module, click the New button at the 
top of the module’s tab. Because I’m in the Campaigns module, the New 
button is the New Campaign button. To create a new record in this module, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Click the New Campaign button.
 
 This opens the Create Campaign page you see in Figure 12-12.
 
 The window you see in Figure 12-12 is typical of Zoho CRM modules. To 
create a new record, you usually fill out a new form and then click Save.
 
2. (Optional) Select the person who “owns” the new campaign.
 
 Zoho CRM lists the users that you set up in Zoho CRM. (See the section 
“Getting People Involved: Managing Users,” earlier in this chapter.)
 
3. (Optional) Select the type of the campaign from the Type drop-down 
list box.
 
 Some choices include Conference, Webinar, Trade Show, and others.
 
4. Enter the campaign name.
 
 This is the only required item to create a new campaign.
 
Figure 12-12: 
Creating 
a new 
campaign.
 

293
 Chapter 12: Zoho CRM: Managing Your Customers
 
5. (Optional) Select the campaign’s status, choosing from Planning, 
Active, Inactive, or Complete.
 
6. (Optional) Enter the campaign’s start date and end date in mm/dd/
yyyy format.
 
 When you click the start date and end date boxes, a calendar appears, 
allowing you to click dates to enter them.
 
7. Fill these remaining optional fields:
 
• The revenue the campaign is expected to generate
 
• The budgeted cost and then the actual cost of the campaign (when 
that cost is known)
 
• An expected response (such as an amount of income) for the 
campaign
 
• Whether to track the number sent (a mass mailing, for example) in 
the Num Sent field
 
• A description for the campaign
 
8. Click Save to create the new campaign, or click the Save & New button 
to save the current campaign and create a new one.
 
 Zoho CRM displays a summary of the new record, as you can see in 
Figure 12-13.
 
To edit a record that’s open, click the Edit button. To close a record, click the 
Close button.
After you create a new record, that record is displayed on the module’s tab. 
You can see a new campaign — Townhouse Rentals, in this example — in 
Figure 12-14.
Editing and deleting a record
To edit a record, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the containing module’s tab to open that module.
 
2. Click the name of the record you want to edit.
 
 The record will be displayed in a details page (in this example, 
Campaign Details on the Campaigns tab).

To delete a record, follow Steps 1 and 2 of the preceding step list. Then click 
the Delete button.

295
 Chapter 12: Zoho CRM: Managing Your Customers
Creating Custom Views
You can organize your records in many ways on the tab of a Zoho CRM module:
 
✓ Sort: Click a letter in the A–Z list of hyperlinks to find records whose 
names begin with the record you clicked.
 
✓ Filter: Filter by active records using the View drop-down list box.
 
✓ Search: Enter a search term in the Search field (left pane) and search for 
matching records.
If none of these methods work, you can create your own custom view, which 
lets you filter records based on the value of each field in the records. For 
example, say you want to find all campaigns with an expected revenue above 
a certain amount, or all campaigns belonging to a certain user. You can do 
that by creating a custom view.
To create a custom view for the records in a Zoho CRM module, follow 
these steps:
 
1. In Zoho CRM, click the tab corresponding to the module for which you 
want to create a custom view.
 
2. Click the Create View link.
 
 This opens the page you see in Figure 12-15.
 
3. Enter a name for the view.
 
4. Select the field of the record you want to supply a criteria for in the 
first drop-down list box you see in Figure 12-15.
 
 For the Campaign module, the fields to filter on include Campaign 
Owner, Campaign Name, Start Date, End Date, Expected Cost, and more.
 
5. Select a condition from the second drop-down list box. 
 
 The possible criteria are: is; isn’t; contains; doesn’t contain; starts with; 
ends with; is empty; and is not empty.
 
6. Click the third box to display possible values for the field you’re 
filtering on.
 
 For example, if you select Campaign Owner as the field to filter on, click-
ing the third box displays a list of all possible campaign owners. Click 
the one you want to sort on.
 
7. To add additional criteria, click the Add Criteria button.
 
 A new line with three boxes appears for the new criterion.
 
8. Select the columns you want to appear in each line of the custom 
filter’s display from the Available Columns list.

296
Part IV: Using Zoho for Your Business 
 
Figure 12-15: 
Creating 
a custom 
view.
 
Add more criteria.
Choose view criteria here.
 
9. Click the right-facing arrow to move your selected columns from the 
Available Columns list to the Selected Columns list.
 
 You can order the columns displayed by the custom view by selecting a 
column in the Selected Columns list and changing its position by clicking 
the up or down arrow to the right of the Selected Columns list.
 
10. Select a radio button granting access to the custom filter in the 
Accessibility Details section. Choose from
 
• All Users Are Allowed to View This Custom View
 
• Show This Custom View Only to Me
 
• Allow the Following Users to View This Custom View. If you select 
this radio button, select User from the Select Source Type drop-
down list box. Then select the users you want in the Available box 
and click the Add button to add them to the Selected box.
 
11. Click Save.
 
12. To see which records the customer view displays, select the custom view 
by name in the View drop-down list box that appears in the module’s tab.
Creating custom views this way lets you filter the records in a module with 
complete precision, and you can filter on as many criteria as you like.

Top Ten Zoho Help 
Resources
In This Chapter
▶ Zoho help resources and FAQs
▶ Zoho Forums
▶ Zoho application manuals
▶ Videos on Zoho applications
T
he Zoho help system is still a work in progress; you’ll find far more in 
this book than you will in the Zoho help files. Thus, the help system is 
currently very spotty: a user manual for one application, FAQs for another, 
and nothing for another. For example, no official online help is available for 
Zoho Reports or Zoho Sheet.
When you’re working in an application, sometimes you see a Help link at the 
top of the application — but in most cases, you don’t. As a result, tracking 
down help resources is not the easiest thing to do, which is why I collected 
them for you in this chapter.
 
If nothing else, Zoho has a toll-free number (888-900-9646) that you can call 
day or night, and a person usually answers promptly. Try that route if you’re 
really stuck.
The Zoho FAQ
www.zoho.com/zoho_faq.html
Zoho emphasizes frequently asked questions (FAQ) lists instead of help files. 
This is a good general resource on Zoho and what it has to offer. Individual 
FAQs are also available for specific applications, as I describe in this chapter.
