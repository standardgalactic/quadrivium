Acknowledgments
I would like to thank my wife for her support and patience during the many, many hours 
that were dedicated to writing this book. Even though our two adult children are grown 
and out of the house, I know they were thinking about me writing and cheering me on 
during the entire process, even with their busy schedules.
I would also like to thank everyone at Sybex who helped with the creation of this book, 
including acquisitions editors Jeff Kellum and Kenyon Brown, production editor Christine 
O’Connor, copy editor Judy Flynn, editorial assistant Connor O’Brien, and editorial man-
ager Pete Gaughan. I owe all these individuals a lot of gratitude for their patience with me 
and the several delays encountered while working with me on this book. The developmen-
tal editor for this book is Kelly Talbot. Many thanks go to Kelly for his time and his work 
in helping with the fl ow, organization, and suggestions that allowed me to make this book 
an easy read. His editorial skills and attention to detail were an enormous help to me.
The technical editor for this book is Denny Hughes. I want to thank Denny for his 
timely reviews, comments, and suggestions that helped make this book a nice read and a 
valuable reference source. His many years of experience as a technical trainer, engineer, 
and content developer were a great contribution in creating a book I am sure you will 
enjoy reading.
A special thank you goes to contributing author Sebastian Coe for his help with 
Chapter 17. Sebastian’s expertise in information systems security was instrumental in his 
contribution.
I would also like to thank the thousands of students who have taken the time to attend 
the computer networking classes that I have had the opportunity to teach over the past 20 
years. Educating, mentoring, and entertaining so many of these individuals gave me the 
inspiration to author this and other books about wireless networking.
Finally, I would like to thank the manufacturers, vendors, organizations, and individu-
als that provided the subject matter, allowing me access to the technology and tools needed 
to write this book:

It is important to have an understanding of basic personal 
computer networking concepts before you begin exploring 
the world of over-the-air (wireless) networking technology, 
wireless terminology, and mobility. This chapter looks at various topics surrounding foun-
dational computer networking, including computer network types, computer topologies, 
the OSI model, and network device addressing. It is intended to provide an overview of 
basic computer networking concepts as an introduction for those who need to gain a basic 
understanding or for those already familiar with this technology and want a review of these 
concepts.
You will look at the various types of wireless networks—including wireless personal 
area networks (WPANs), wireless local area networks (WLANs), wireless metropolitan 
area networks (WMANs), and wireless wide area networks (WWANs)—in Chapter 4, 
“Standards and Certifi cations for Wireless Technologies.”
Network Types
Personal computer networking technology has evolved at a tremendous pace over the past 
couple of decades, and many people across the world now have some type of exposure to 
the technology. Initially, personal computers were connected, or networked, to share fi les 
and printers and to provide central access to the users’ data. This type of network was usu-
ally confi ned to a few rooms or within a single building and required some type of cabled 
physical infrastructure. As the need for this technology continued to grow, so did the types 
of networks. Computer networking started with the local area network (LAN) and grew 
on to bigger and better types, including wide area networks (WANs), metropolitan area 
networks (MANs), and others. The following are some of the common networking types in 
use today:
 
■
Local area networks (LANs)
 
■
Wide area networks (WANs)
 
■
Metropolitan area networks (MANs)
 
■
Campus area networks (CANs)
 
■
Personal area networks (PANs)

You may also come across the term storage area network (SAN). The SAN 
is basically a separate subnet for offloading of large amounts of data 
used within an enterprise network. High-speed connections are used, so 
the data is easily accessible because it appears to be part of the network. 
The connections are commonly Fibre Channel or iSCSI utilizing the TCP/IP 
protocol. 
Most computer networks now contain some type of wireless connectivity or may consist 
of mostly wireless connectivity. The need for wireless networking and mobility continues to 
be in great demand and is growing at a rapid pace.
The Local Area Network
A local area network (LAN) can be defi ned as a group of devices connected in a spe-
cifi c arrangement called a topology. The topology used depends on where the network 
is installed. Some common legacy topologies such as the bus and ring and more modern 
topologies such as the star and mesh are discussed later in this chapter. Local area net-
works are contained in the same physical area and usually are bounded by the perimeter of 
a room or building. However, in some cases a LAN may span a group of buildings in close 
proximity that share a common physical connection. 
Early LANs were mostly used for fi le and print services. This allowed users to store 
data securely and provided a centralized location of data for accessibility even when the 
user was physically away from the LAN. This central storage of data also gave a network 
administrator the ability to back up and archive all the saved data for disaster recovery pur-
poses. As for print services, it was not cost effective to have a physical printer at every desk 
or for every user, so LANs allowed the use of shared printers for any user connected to the 
local area network. Figure 1.1 illustrates a local area network that includes both wired and 
wireless networking devices.
The Wide Area Network
As computer networking continued to evolve, many businesses and organizations that used 
this type of technology needed to expand the LAN beyond the physical limits of a single 
room or building. These networks covered a larger geographical area and became known 
as wide area networks (WANs). As illustrated in Figure 1.2, WAN connectivity mostly 
consists of point-to-point or point-to-multipoint connections between two or more LANs. 
The LANs may span a relatively large geographical area. (Point-to-point and point-to-
multipoint connections are discussed later in this chapter.) The WAN has allowed users and 
organizations to share data fi les and other resources with a much larger audience than a 
single LAN would.

WANs can use leased lines from telecommunication providers (commonly known as

solution for connecting LANs.

The Metropolitan Area Network
The metropolitan area network (MAN) interconnects devices for access to computer 
resources in a region or area larger than that covered by local area networks (LANs) but 
yet smaller than the areas covered by wide area networks (WANs). A MAN consists of net-
works that are geographically separated and can span from several blocks of buildings to 
entire cities (see Figure 1.3). MANs include fast connectivity between local networks and 
may include fi ber optics or other wired connectivity that is capable of longer distances and 
higher capacity than those in a LAN.
MANs allow for connections to outside larger networks such as the Internet. They may 
include cable television, streaming video, and telephone services. Devices and connectivity 
used with metropolitan area networks may be owned by a town, county, or other locality and 
may also include the property of individual companies. Wireless MANs are also becoming a 
common way to connect the same type of areas but without the physical cabling limitations.
The MAN is growing in popularity as the need for access in this type of environment 
also increases.

The Campus Area Network
A campus area network (CAN) includes a set of interconnected LANs that basically form 
a smaller version of a wide area network (WAN) within a limited geographical area, usu-
ally an offi ce or school campus. Each building within the campus generally has a separate 
LAN. The LANs are often connected using fi ber-optic cable, which provides a greater dis-
tance than copper wiring using IEEE 802.3 Ethernet technology. However, using wireless 

6 
Chapter 1 ■ Computer Network Types, Topologies, and the OSI Model
connections between the buildings in a CAN is an increasingly common way to connect 
the individual LANs. These wireless connections or wireless bridges provide a quick, cost-
effective way to connect buildings in a university campus, as shown in Figure 1.4.
In a university campus environment, a CAN may link many buildings, including all of 
the various schools—School of Business, School of Law, School of Engineering, and so 
on—as well as the university library, administration buildings, and even residence halls. 
Wireless LAN deployments are becoming commonplace in university residence halls. With 
the rapidly increasing number of wireless mobile devices on university campuses, the 
number of wireless access points and the capacity of each need to be considered.
As in the university campus environment, a corporate offi ce CAN may connect all the 
various building LANs that are part of the organization. This type of network will have 
the characteristics of a WAN but be confi ned to the internal resources of the corporation 
or organization. Many organizations are deploying wireless networks within the corporate 
CAN as a way to connect various parts of the business together. As with the university 
CAN, in the corporate world wireless can be a quick, cost-effective way to provide connec-
tivity between buildings and departments.
All of the physical connection mediums and devices are the property of the offi ce or 
school campus, and responsibility for the maintenance of the equipment lies with the offi ce 
or campus as well.

both. On the wired side, this includes universal serial bus (USB) devices such as printers, 
keyboards, and computer mice that may be connected with a USB hub. With wireless tech-
nology, PANs are short-range computer networks and in many cases use Bluetooth wireless 
technology. Wireless Bluetooth technology is specifi ed by the IEEE 802.15 standard and is 
not IEEE 802.11 wireless local area technology. Bluetooth will be discussed in more detail 
in Chapter 4. Like wired PANs, wireless PANs are commonly used in connecting an indi-
vidual’s wireless personal communication accessories such as phones, headsets, computer 
mice, keyboards, tablets, and printers and are centered on the individual personal work-
space without the need for physical cabling. Figure 1.5 illustrates a typical wireless PAN 
confi guration.

Network Topologies
A computer physical network topology is the actual layout or physical design and intercon-
nection of a computer network. A topology includes the cabling and devices that are part of 
the network. In the following sections you will learn about several different types of 
network topologies:
 
■
Bus
 
■
Ring
 
■
Star
 
■
Mesh
 
■
Ad-hoc
 
■
Point-to-point
 
■
Point-to-multipoint

Chapter 1 ■ Computer Network Types, Topologies, and the OSI Model
The bus, ring, star, mesh, and ad-hoc topologies are typically what make up the local 
area network (LAN) you learned about previously. Point-to-point and point-to-multipoint 
topologies can be commonly used for connecting LANs and are mostly used for wide 
area network (WAN) connections. The size of your network will determine which topol-
ogies will apply. If your network is a single building and not part of a larger corporate 
network, the LAN topologies may be the extent of the technologies used. However, once 
that LAN connects to a different LAN, you are moving up and scaling to a wide area 
network.
The Bus Topology
A bus topology consists of multiple devices connected along a single shared medium with 
two defi ned endpoints. It is sometimes referred to as a high-speed linear bus and is a 
single collision domain in which all devices on the bus network receive all messages. Both 
endpoints of a bus topology have a 50 ohm termination device, usually a Bayonet Neill-
Concelman (BNC) connector with a 50 ohm termination resistor. The bus topology was 
commonly used with early LANs but is now considered a legacy design.
One disadvantage to the bus topology is that if any point along the cable is damaged or 
broken, the entire LAN will cease to function. This is because the two endpoints communi-
cate only across the single shared medium. There is no alternative route for them to use in 
the event of a problem.
Troubleshooting a bus network is performed by something known as the half-split 
method. A network engineer “breaks” or separates the link at about the halfway point 
and measures the resistance on both ends. If the segment measures 50 ohms of resis-
tance, there is a good chance that side of the LAN segment is functioning correctly. If 
the resistance measurement is not 50 ohms, it signals a problem with that part of the 
LAN segment. The engineer continues with this method until the exact location of the 
problem is identifi ed. 
Figure 1.6 illustrates an example of the bus topology.

Troubleshooting the Bus Topology
Many years ago I was called to troubleshoot a problem on a small local area network 
using a bus topology. The network consisted of a network ﬁ le server, about 20 client sta-
tions, and a few network printers. The users complained of intermittent connection prob-
lems with the network. After spending some time looking over the network, I decided to 
test the bus using the half-split method and checked to verify that the cable was reporting 
the correct resistance using a volt-ohm-milliamp (VoM) meter. Sure enough, one side of 
the network cable reported the correct resistance reading, but the other side was giving 
intermittent results.
After spending some time repeating the troubleshooting method, I was able to determine 
the problem. It turns out that someone had run the coax (bus) cable underneath a heavy 
plastic ofﬁ ce chair mat and one of the little pegs used to protect the ﬂ ooring was causing 
the intermittent connection as it struck the cable when the user moved their chair around 
the mat. I quickly replaced and rerouted the section of cable in question. It is a good thing 
I was there during the normal business operating hours when the person was moving 
around in the chair or I might have never found the problem. Ah, the joys of troubleshoot-
ing a bus topology.
The Ring Topology
The ring topology is rarely used with LANs today, but it is still widely used by Internet ser-
vice providers (ISPs) for high-speed, resilient backhaul connections over fi ber-optic links. In 
the ring topology, each device connects to two other devices, forming a logical ring pattern. 
Ring topologies in LANs may use a token-passing access method, in which data travels 
around the ring in one direction. Only one device at a time will have the opportunity to 
transmit data. Because this access method travels in one direction, it does not need to use 
collision detection and often outperforms the bus topology, achieving higher data transfer 
rates than are possible using a collision detection access method. Each computer on the ring 
topology can act as a repeater, a capacity that allows for a much stronger signal. 
The IEEE standard for LANs is IEEE 802.5, specifying Token Ring technology. IEEE 
802.5 Token Ring technology used in LANs was a very effi cient method used to connect 
devices, but it was usually more expensive than the bus or star topologies. Because of the 
token-passing method used, early 4 Mbps Token Ring networks could sometimes outper-
form a 10 Mbps IEEE 802.3 collision-based Ethernet network. Token Ring technology 
speeds increased to 16 Mbps but decreased in popularity as Ethernet speeds increased. Even 
though this is a ring topology, devices are connected through a central device and appear to 
be similar to devices on an Ethernet hub or switch. Figure 1.7 shows an example of the ring 
topology.

The Star Topology
The star topology, as shown in Figure 1.8, is the most commonly used method of connect-
ing devices on a LAN today. It consists of multiple devices connected by a central connection 
device. Hubs, switches, and wireless access points are all common central connection devices, 
although hubs are rarely used today. The hub provides a single collision domain similar to a 
bus topology. However, the Ethernet switch and wireless access point both have more intel-
ligence—the ability to decide which port specifi c network traffi c can be sent to. Note that 
in Figure 1.8, the wireless star topology includes an Ethernet switch, which could also have 
extended devices connected to it with wires. In that sense, it is possible to have a wired/wire-
less hybrid topology.
A big advantage to the star over the bus and some ring topologies is that if a connection 
is broken or damaged, the entire network does not cease to function; only a single device 
in the star topology is affected. However, the central connection device such as a switch or 
wireless access point can be considered a potential central point of failure.
The Mesh Topology
A device in a mesh network will process its own data as well as serving as a communica-
tion point for other mesh devices. Each device in a mesh topology (see Figure 1.9) has one 
or more connections to other devices that are part of the mesh. This approach provides both 
network resilience in case of link or device failure and a cost savings compared to full redun-
dancy. Mesh technology can operate with both wired and wireless infrastructure network

devices. Wireless mesh networks are growing in popularity because of the potential uses in 
outdoor deployments and the cost savings they provide.

From an IEEE 802.11 wireless perspective, wireless mesh technology has now been 
standardized, although most manufacturers continue to use their proprietary methods. The 
amendment to the IEEE 802.11 standard for mesh networking is 802.11s. This amendment 
was ratifi ed in 2011 and is now part of the latest wireless LAN standard, IEEE 802.11-
2012. In addition to IEEE 802.11 networks, mesh is also standardized in IEEE 802.15 
personal area networks for use with Zigbee and IEEE 802.16 Wireless MAN networks. 
Wireless standards will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 4.
As mentioned earlier, IEEE 802.11 wireless device manufacturers currently continue to 
use proprietary Layer 2 routing protocols, forming a self-healing wireless infrastructure 
(mesh) in which edge devices can communicate. Manufacturers of enterprise wireless net-
working infrastructure devices provide support for mesh access points (APs) such that the 
mesh APs connect back to APs that are directly wired into the network backbone infra-
structure. The APs, wireless LAN controllers or software-based cloud solutions in this case, 
are used to confi gure both the wired and mesh APs.
Ad Hoc Connections
In the terms of computer networking, the ad hoc network is a collection of devices 
connected without a design or a plan for the purpose of sharing information or resources. 
Another term for an ad hoc network is peer-to-peer network.

F I G U R E  1. 9   Mesh networks can include either wired or wireless devices.
Wireless Mesh Routers
Wired Mesh Routers
In a wired peer-to-peer network, all computing devices are of equal status. In other 
words, there is no server that manages the access to network resources. All peers can either 
share their own resources or access the resources of their devices on the network. 
An ad hoc wireless network is one that does not contain a distribution system, 
which means no wireless access point is contained in the system to provide centralized 
communications. 
Figure 1.10 shows an example of a wired peer-to-peer network and a wireless ad hoc

Point-to-Point Connections
When at least two LANs are connected, it is known as a point-to-point connection or 
link (see Figure 1.11). The connection can be made using either wired or wireless network 
infrastructure devices and can include bridges, wireless access points, and routers. Wireless 
point-to-point links can sometimes extend very long distances depending on terrain and 
other local conditions. Point-to-point links provide a connection between LANs, allowing 
users from one LAN to access resources on the other connected local area network.

Wired point-to-point links consist of fi ber-optic connections or leased lines from 
local telecommunication providers. Wireless point-to-point links typically call for semi-
directional or highly directional antennas. Wireless point-to-point links include direc-
tional antennas and encryption to protect the wireless data as it propagates through the 
air from one network to the other. With some regulatory domains such as the Federal 
Communications Commission (FCC), when an omnidirectional antenna is used in this 
confi guration it is considered a special case, called a point-to-multipoint link.
Point-to-Multipoint Connections
A network infrastructure connecting more than two LANs is known as a point-to-multipoint 
connection or link (see Figure 1.12). When used with wireless, this confi guration usually con-
sists of one omnidirectional antenna and multiple semidirectional or highly directional anten-
nas. Point-to-multipoint links are often used in campus-style deployments, where connections 
to multiple buildings or locations may be required. Like point-to-point connections; wired 
point-to-multipoint connections can use either direct wired connections such as fi ber-optic 
cables or leased line connectivity available from telecommunication providers.

The OSI Model
Before we continue with other mobility topics, you should have some background on com-
puter networking theory. The basics of a computer networking discussion start with the 
Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, a conceptual seven-layer model. The OSI model 
has been around for decades. It came about in 1984 and was developed by the International 
Organization for Standardization (ISO). The ISO is a worldwide organization that creates 
standards on an international scale. The OSI model describes the basic concept of communi-
cations in the computer network environment. Be careful not to confuse the two.
There are seven layers to the OSI model. Each layer is made up of many protocols and 
serves a specifi c function. You will take a quick look at all seven layers of the OSI model. 
Some wireless-specifi c functionality of the OSI model will be discussed later in Chapter 5, 
“IEEE 802.11 Terminology and Technology.” Figure 1.13 illustrates the seven layers of the 
conceptual OSI model.
The following sections describe how each layer is used.
Layer 1 – The Physical Layer
The Physical layer (sometimes referred as the PHY) is the lowest layer in the OSI model. 
The PHY consists of bit-level data streams and computer network hardware connecting 
the devices together. This hardware that connects devices includes network interface cards, 

The OSI Model 
15
cables, Ethernet switches, wireless access points, and bridges. Keep in mind some of these 
hardware devices, such as Ethernet switches and bridges, actually have Data Link layer 
(Layer 2) functionally and operate at that layer but also make up the actual physical 
connections. In the case of wireless networking, radio frequency (RF) uses air as the 
medium for wireless communications. With respect to wireless networking, the Physical 
layer consists of two sublayers: 
 
■
Physical Layer Convergence Protocol (PLCP)
 
■
Physical Medium Dependent (PMD) 
The PLCP, the higher of the two layers, is the interface between the PMD and Media 
Access Control (MAC) sublayer of the Data Link layer. This is where the Physical layer 
header is added to the data. The PMD is the lower sublayer at the bottom of the protocol 
stack and is responsible for transmitting the data onto the wireless medium. Figure 1.14 
shows the two sublayers that make up the Physical layer.

Layer 2 – The Data Link Layer
The Data Link layer is responsible for organizing the bit-level data for communication 
between devices on a network and detecting and correcting Physical layer errors. This layer 
consists of two sublayers:

The bit-level communication is accomplished through Media Access Control (MAC)

and is known as the physical or sometimes referred to as the hardware address. (MAC 
addresses are discussed later in this chapter.) Figure 1.15 illustrates the two sublayers of the 
Data Link layer, Layer 2.

The Network layer is where the Internet Protocol (IP) resides. The Network layer is respon-
sible for addressing and routing data by determining the best route to take based on what 
it has learned or been assigned. An IP address is defi ned as a numerical identifi er or logical 
address assigned to a network device. The IP address can be static, manually assigned by 

The OSI Model

a user, or it can be dynamically assigned from a server using Dynamic Host Confi guration 
Protocol (DHCP). (IP addresses are discussed later in this chapter.) Figure 1.16 illustrates 
the Layer 2 MAC address translation to a Layer 3 IP address.

Layer 4 – The Transport Layer
The Transport layer consists of both connection-oriented and connectionless protocols 
providing communications between devices on a computer network. Although there are 
several protocols that operate at this layer, you should be familiar with two commonly 
used Layer 4 protocols:
 
■
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) 
 
■
User Datagram Protocol (UDP) 
TCP is a connection-oriented protocol and is used for communications that require reli-
ability, analogous to a circuit-switched telephone call. 
UDP is a connectionless protocol and is used for simple communications requiring effi -
ciency, analogous to sending a postcard through a mail service. You would not know if 
the postcard was received or not. UDP and TCP port numbers are assigned to applications 
for fl ow control and error recovery. Figure 1.17 represents the relationship between the 
Transport layer protocols TCP and UDP.
Layer 5 – The Session Layer
The Session layer opens, closes, and manages communications sessions between end-user 
application processes located on different network devices. The following protocols are 
examples of Session layer protocols:

Layer 6 – The Presentation Layer
The Presentation layer provides delivery and formatting of information for processing and 
display. This allows for information that is sent from one device on a network (the source) 
to be understood by another device (the destination) on the network.
Layer 7 – The Application Layer
The Application layer can be considered the interface to the user. Application is another 
term for a program that runs on a computer or other networking device and that is not 
what we are looking at here. Protocols at this layer are for network operations such as, 
for example, transferring fi les, browsing web pages, and sending email. The following list 
includes some of the more common examples of Application layer protocols we use daily:
 
■
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) for transfering data
 
■
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) for web browsing
 
■
Post Office Protocol v3 (POP3) for email
Common Application layer protocols will be discussed further in Chapter 2, “Common 
Network Protocols and Ports.” 

The OSI Model 
19
How the Layers Work Together
In order for computers and other network devices to communicate with one another using 
the OSI model, a communication infrastructure of some type is necessary. In a wired net-
work, such an infrastructure consists of cables, repeaters, bridges, and Layer 2 switches. 
In a wireless network, the infrastructure consists of access points, bridges, repeaters, radio 
frequency, and the open air. Some of these devices will be discussed in more detail in 
Chapter 6, “Computer Network Infrastructure Devices.”
Wireless networking functions at the two lowest layers of the OSI model, Layer 1 
(Physical) and Layer 2 (Data Link). However, to some degree Layer 3 (Network) plays a 
role as well, generally for the TCP/IP protocol capabilities.
OSI Model Memorization Tip
One common method you can use to remember the seven layers of the OSI model from 
top to bottom is to memorize the following sentence: All people seem to need data 
processing. Take the ﬁ rst letter from each word and that will give you an easy way to 
remember the ﬁ rst letter that pertains to each layer of the OSI model.

Peer Layer Communication
Peer layers communicate with other layers in the OSI model and the layers underneath are 
their support systems. Peer layer communication is the “horizontal” link between devices 
on the network. Figure 1.18 shows three examples of peer layer communication. Keep in 
mind, however, that this principle applies to all seven layers of the OSI model. This allows 
for the layers to communicate with the layer to which a device is sending or receiving 
information.

Data Encapsulation
The purpose of encapsulation is to allow Application layer data communication between 
two stations on a network using the lower layers as a support system. As data moves down 
the OSI model from the source to the destination, it is encapsulated. As data moves back 
up the OSI model from the source to the destination, it is de-encapsulated. Some layers 
will add a header and/or trailer when information is being transmitted and remove it when 
information is being received. Encapsulation is the method in which lower layers support 
upper layers. Figure 1.19 illustrates this process.
Device Addressing
Every device on a network requires unique identifi cation. This can be accomplished in a 
couple of ways:

Physical
The physical address of a network adapter is also known as the Media Access Control 
(MAC) address. As shown in Figure 1.20, every device on a network (like every street 
address in a city) must have a unique address. The physical address is required in order for 
a device to send or receive information (data). An analogy to this is sending a package to be 
delivered via a courier service. Before you hand over the package to the courier, you would 
write the name and physical street address of the recipient on the package. This would 
ensure that the package is delivered correctly to the recipient.
The logical address is also known as the Internet Protocol (IP) address. Each device on a 
Layer 3 network or subnet must have a unique IP address (like every city’s zip code). The IP 
address can be mapped to the physical address by using the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP).
The streets shown in Figure 1.20—1st, Main, and 2nd—represent local area network 
subnets. The street addresses—10, 20, and so on—represent the unique address of each 
structure on a street as a MAC address would a device on a LAN.
Physical Addressing
The physical address of a network device is called a MAC address because the MAC sub-
layer of the Data Link layer handles media access control. The MAC address is a 6-byte 
(12-character) hexadecimal address in the format AB:CD:EF:12:34:56. The fi rst 3 bytes 
(or octets) of a MAC address are called the organizationally unique identifi er (OUI). Some 
manufacturers produce many network devices and therefore require several OUIs. A table 
of all OUIs is freely available from the IEEE Standards Association website at
http://standards.ieee.org/develop/regauth/oui/oui.txt

22 
Chapter 1 ■ Computer Network Types, Topologies, and the OSI Model
MAC addresses are globally unique; an example is shown in Figure 1.21. The fi rst 3 
bytes or octets (6 characters) are issued to manufacturers by the IEEE. The last 3 bytes or 
octets (6 characters) are incrementally assigned to devices by the manufacturer.

operating system.

Logical Addressing
Network devices can also be identifi ed by a logical address, known as the Internet 
Protocol (IP) address. The Layer 3 IP protocol works with a Layer 4 transport protocol, 
either User Datagram Protocol (UDP) or Transport layer Protocol (TCP). You learned 
earlier in this chapter that UDP is a connectionless protocol, and using it is analogous 
to sending a postcard through the mail. The sender has no way of knowing if the card 
was received by the intended recipient. TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, used for 
communications analogous to a telephone call, and provides guaranteed delivery of data 
through acknowledgements. During a telephone conversation, communication between 
two people will be confi rmed to be intact, with the users acknowledging the conversa-
tion. Routable logical addresses such as TCP/IP addresses became more popular with the 
evolution of the Internet and the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) that is used with 
the World Wide Web (WWW) service. IP moves data through an internetwork such as the 
Internet one router (or hop) at a time. Each router decides where to send the data based on 
the logical IP address. Figure 1.23 shows a basic network utilizing both Layer 2 and Layer 
3 data traffi c.

24 
Chapter 1 ■ Computer Network Types, Topologies, and the OSI Model
Logical addresses (IP addresses) are 32-bit dotted-decimal addresses usually written in 
the form www.xxx.yyy.zzz. Figure 1.24 illustrates an example of a logical Class C, 32-bit 
IP address. Each of the four parts is a byte, or 8 digital bits. There are two main IP address 
types: private addresses and public addresses. Private addresses are unique to an internal 
network, and public addresses are unique to the Internet. These addresses consist of two 
main parts: the network (subnet) and the host (device). Logical addresses also require a 
subnet mask and may have a gateway address depending on whether the network is routed. 
IPv4 addresses fall under three classes: Class A addresses, Class B addresses, and Class C 
addresses.

Device Addressing 
25
The logical IP addresses you just learned about are known as IPv4 
addresses. Newer addresses called IPv6 addresses also exist and are 
discussed in Chapter 2.
Unlike a MAC address, an IP address is logical and can be either specifi ed as a static 
address assigned to the device manually by the user or dynamically assigned by a server. 
However, the same command-line utility used to identify the physical address of a device 
can be used to identify the logical address of a device. Typing ipconfig at a command 
prompt displays the logical address, including the IP address, subnet mask, and default 
gateway (router) of the device. The ipconfig /all command illustrated earlier in the chap-
ter will yield additional information, including the physical or MAC address of the device’s 
network adapter. This command is for a computer using the Microsoft Windows operating 
system. For some Apple and Linux devices, the ifconfig command will yield similar infor-
mation. Figure 1.25 shows the ipconfig utility displaying the logical address information, 
including the IP address and subnet mask.

In Exercise 1.1, you will use the ipconfig utility from a command prompt on a com-
puter using the Microsoft Windows operating system. This will allow you to see the 
address information for any available network adapters within the device.
Exercise 1.1 was written using a computer with the Microsoft Windows 7 
operating system. If you’re using another version of the operating system, 
the steps may vary slightly. Keep in mind that there are many different 
shortcuts and ways to get to a command prompt in the Microsoft operat-
ing systems. The steps in this exercise use one common method.

Summary
This chapter provided a survey of networking topics to help you understand the basics of 
computer networking as an introduction or a simple review. It began with an outline of the 
common network technology types:
 
■
Local area networks (LANs)
 
■
Wide area networks (WANs)
 
■
Metropolitan area networks (MANs)

Chapter Essentials 
27
 
■
Campus area networks (CANs)
 
■
Personal area networks (PANs)
The next fundamental networking concept discussed was computer network topologies. 
You learned about network topologies ranging from the legacy high-speed linear bus and 
ring to the current star topology, the most common topology used today with both wired 
and wireless networks. You looked at the following various topologies:
 
■
Bus
 
■
Ring
 
■
Star
 
■
Mesh
 
■
Ad hoc
 
■
Point-to-point
 
■
Point-to-multipoint
You then reviewed the basics and different layers of the OSI model, including a brief 
overview of each layer illustrating the different protocols and sublayers where applicable. 
Then I discussed the basics of peer communications and data encapsulation.
The chapter’s fi nal topic was device addressing. You explored the concepts of physical 
(MAC Sublayer) and logical (Network layer) addressing, including the IP address and sub-
net mask. A simple exercise using a computer with the Microsoft Windows operating sys-
tem showed how to view device addressing information.
Chapter Essentials
Understand the components of a local area network (LAN).  A local area network is a 
group of computers connected by a physical medium in a specifi c arrangement called a 
topology.
Know the different types of networks.  The basic networks types are LAN, WAN, CAN, 
MAN, and PAN.
Become familiar with various networking topologies.  Bus, star, ring, mesh, and ad hoc 
are some of the topologies used in computer networking. Bus is considered legacy, and the 
star topology is one of the most common in use today.
Understand point-to-point and point-to-multipoint connections.  These can consist of 
both wired and wireless connections and will connect two or more LANs.
Understand the OSI model basics.  Each of the seven layers of the OSI model serves a 
specifi c function. It’s benefi cial to have an overall understanding of all seven layers.

28 
Chapter 1 ■ Computer Network Types, Topologies, and the OSI Model
Remember the details of the lower two layers of the OSI model.  The Physical layer and 
Data Link layer are the two lowest layers in the OSI model. Wireless networking technol-
ogy operates at these layers. The Data Link layer consists of two sublayers: the Logical 
Link Control (LLC) sublayer and the Media Access Control (MAC) sublayer.
Understand device addressing.   Devices are assigned a unique physical address by the 
manufacturer. This address is known as the MAC address. MAC addresses consist of two 
parts, the organizationally unique identifi er (OUI) and the unique physical address. A logi-
cal address may also be assigned at the Network layer to identify devices on different inter-
networks using the Internet Protocol (IP).

In Chapter 1, “Computer Network Types, Topologies and 
the OSI Model,” you were introduced to the conceptual OSI 
model and the basics of its different layers. This chapter will 
take a look at the Internet protocol suite and common networking protocols and ports. 
Like the OSI model, the Internet protocol suite consists of several layers. You will learn 
about some of the common protocols that are contained in this layered suite of protocols. 
We will also look at some of the common networking services that are used in most com-
puter networks and for Internet connectivity today. 
The Internet Protocol Suite
In this section you will learn about some of the common computer network protocols 
that are used for computer and mobile device communications, applications, and services. 
In Chapter 1 you learned about the conceptual seven-layer OSI model and how it works 
with computer communications. Here you will see how the Internet protocol suite plays a 
role with communications and its relationship to the OSI model. Like the OSI model, the 
Internet protocol suite consists of layers of protocols, each used for a specifi c purpose. It 
consists of four layers: 
 
■
The Application layer
 
■
The Transport layer
 
■
The Internet layer
 
■
The Network Interface (Link) layer
You might see documentation that refers to the Internet protocol suite as 
being a five-layer model. In such instances, the Network Interface (Link) 
layer is considered to be two separate layers, the Data Link and the Physi-
cal layer.
As with the OSI model, each layer of the Internet protocol suite specifi es certain protocols 
that are used for a specifi c function in computer communications. However, the Internet pro-
tocol suite was placed in service years before the OSI model came into existence. Figure 2.1 
shows the Internet protocol suite and how it logically maps to the OSI model.

The four layers of this model represent the different protocols used for device communi-
cations on a computer network and over the Internet. I will now defi ne each layer starting 
with the lowest:
The Network Interface (Link) Layer  This layer is the lowest layer and is responsible for 
the communication of information (data), including how data bits are organized and sent 
and the physical medium that is used for the transmission.
The Transport Layer  Session management between devices and familiar protocols, 
including Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP), reside 
here. You will learn more about these protocols later in this chapter. This layer provides the 
connection between two hosts on a network. 
The Internet Layer  Operating at this layer are protocols responsible for addressing, 
resolving addresses, and routing, including Internet Protocol (IP), Address Resolution 
Protocol (ARP), and Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP).
The Application Layer  The protocols that reside at the top layer are those related to appli-
cations and processes such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Simple Network Management 
Protocol (SNMP), Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and many others. This is the layer 
that is closest to the user device level and the interface to the user.

32 
Chapter 2 ■ Common Network Protocols and Ports
You may sometimes see the Internet protocol suite referred to as the TCP/
IP model or even the DoD model because it was funded by the United 
States Department of Defense.
Request for Comments (RFC)
It is important to have a basic understanding of how networking protocols originated and 
are defi ned and documented. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the Internet 
Society (ISOC) are the organizations responsible for creating Internet standards and pro-
moting Internet technology and usage. 
A Request for Comments (RFC) is a document created by engineers and scientists and 
designed to defi ne innovation and technology that works with the Internet. If an RFC 
is approved by the IETF, it will eventually become an Internet standard. The IETF also 
works with standards related to the Internet protocol suite and with the World Wide Web 
Consortium (W3C). 
All of the protocols and services described in this chapter are based on RFCs, and the 
documents are easily accessible on the Internet. There may be many RFCs related to some 
of the protocols described in this chapter.
It is important to understand that due to advancements in technology and 
innovation, new RFCs may be written that affect protocols already defined 
in an existing RFC. The result is that the existing RFCs may become obso-
lete and the new RFC is assigned a new RFC number. There is a website 
available that will allow you to search for RFCs based on the RFC number 
or titles and keywords. You can visit www.rfc-editor.org/search/rfc_
search.php to search for RFCs and for additional information. 
Common Network Protocols 
and Services
The defi nition of protocol in any context of the word is “a set of rules.” When it comes to 
computer networking, the same defi nition applies but the rules pertain to the exchange of 
messages between connected systems or computing devices, commonly identifi ed as “host-to-
host” communications. In the following sections, we will survey some of the common proto-
cols and services used with everyday computer networking and mobile device technology: 
 
■
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
 
■
User Datagram Protocol (UDP) 

Common Network Protocols and Services

■
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
 
■
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
 
■
Network Address Translation (NAT)
 
■
Domain Name System (DNS)
 
■
Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
If you remember from Chapter 1, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) operates at the 
Transport layer of the OSI model. TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that provides reli-
able guaranteed message delivery between two devices on a computer network. The devices 
may reside on a local area network (LAN), on a wireless local area network (WLAN), on a 
wide area network (WAN), or even across an Internet connection. This guaranteed packet 
delivery does come at the cost of some overhead because it is a reliable, guaranteed delivery. 
TCP is commonly used in conjunction with the Internet Protocol (IP), which is a 
Network Layer protocol. IP is responsible for the addressing and routing of packets sent 
across the network. When a device sends information or data to another device on a net-
work, all of the data might not be sent at one time; it might be broken down into smaller 
packets, depending on the amount of data. When packets are used, network traffi c fl ows 
from host to host effi ciently. When the data is received by the destination device, it is reas-
sembled into the complete message that was originally sent by the transmitting device. 
Figure 2.2 shows a trace from a packet analyzer displaying the TCP information from an 
FTP fi le transfer. 
F I G U R E  2 . 2   Wireshark packet analyzer showing a FTP file transfer and TCP protocol 
information

Information
TCP’s guarantee of delivery to the destination device is accomplished through an 
acknowledgment process. Once all the data is received at the destination, the ses-
sion is ended. You can see in Figure 2.2 that several TCP packets are sent prior to an 

34 
Chapter 2 ■ Common Network Protocols and Ports
acknowledgment. File Transfer Protocol (FTP), discussed later in this chapter, is one exam-
ple that uses the TCP protocol. 
Wireshark was used to create the information for the screen capture in 
Figure 2.2 and others in this chapter. Wireshark is a free, open-source 
packet analyzer program you can download and use if you would like see 
what happens on a network and all of the frames that traverse the medium. 
You can download Wireshark at www.wireshark.org/download.html. 
User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is also a Transport layer protocol. There are some similari-
ties between TCP and UDP. Both function at Layer 4 of the OSI model. Like TCP, UDP is 
also used in conjunction with the Internet Protocol (IP). 
However, unlike TCP, UDP is a connectionless protocol, which means the data sent does 
not need to be acknowledged by the destination device. Therefore, UDP can be much faster 
than TCP because there is less overhead. In Chapter 1 I said that using UDP is like sending 
a postcard through a mail service. When a postcard is sent, you have no way of knowing if 
it arrives at the destination, so there is no guaranteed packet delivery. 
You will learn that some of the common protocols and services discussed in this chapter 
may use either TCP or UDP for communications. One good example for the use of UDP is 
streaming video. Video and voice data use real-time communications (RTC). If a packet of 
this type is dropped, you don’t want it arriving later. RTC typically uses UDP for the speed. 
TCP is used for non-real-time communications like fi le transfer, where reliability is more 
important than speed. With this type of data, you would want speed, and UDP will provide 
that over TCP. TFTP is an example that uses UDP for communications. Figure 2.3 shows 
a trace from a packet analyzer displaying the UDP information from a Trivial File Transfer 
Protocol (TFTP) fi le transfer.

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
Dynamic Host Confi guration Protocol (DHCP) is a networking protocol/service that pro-
vides the dynamic mapping and assignments of logical Layer 3 IP addresses of a network 
device to the physical Layer 2 MAC addresses of a network device. This simplifi es the pro-
cess of IP address assignments, allowing for network communications that use the Internet 
protocol suite. If DHCP is not used, static IP addresses and other information have to be 
manually assigned to the devices in order for them to communicate using TCP/IP. 
Figure 2.4 illustrates the ipconfig command on a Microsoft-based computer showing 
the IP address of the server hosting DHCP services and other assigned IP information. 
F I G U R E  2 . 4   A Microsoft Windows computer shows the DHCP IP address information 
assigned from a DHCP server.
DHCP IP Information
from DHCP Server
A computer or other network device that is running the DHCP service is known as 
the DHCP server. This can be a dedicated server, an appliance, or even a software 
program installed on a computer. Other infrastructure devices such as wireless LAN access 
points and home wireless routers can also operate as a DHCP server if they have that 
functionality. There are some very basic DHCP server programs available for free, and with 
a simple search of the Internet you can fi nd them. These free programs are great for small 
networks, home labs, and experimentation with the DHCP protocol. 
A DHCP server requires confi guration, which will include the range of IP addresses 
that will be issued to the requesting client devices. This range of addresses is sometimes 
called the address range, the address pool, or the address scope, or it may be referred to 
by another term that identifi es the range of addresses (from the starting address to the end 
address) that will be issued to requesting client devices. 
In addition to the IP address, a DHCP server can also be confi gured to deliver other IP 
information if required or needed. This additional information may include the following:
 
■
Subnet mask address
 
■
Default gateway or router address

36 
Chapter 2 ■ Common Network Protocols and Ports
 
■
DNS server address
 
■
Domain name information
 
■
Additional options
Most DHCP servers have many other available options. The installation and use of 
the server will determine which options will need to be confi gured and issued. Figure 2.5 
shows a screen capture of a basic DHCP server confi guration screen. 
F I G U R E  2 . 5   A Microsoft Windows Server 2008 DHCP server configuration screen 
displays some of the possible DHCP settings issued from a server to a client device.
If you experiment with DHCP servers on your network, it is important that 
you consider the potential consequences. When a DHCP client device 
requests DCHP information, it will send out a broadcast message on the 
network. All DHCP servers that hear the message will reply with an offer. 
The client device is not very picky and will choose the first offer it receives. 
Therefore, if the DHCP server does not contain all the correct parameters or 
is not configured correctly, the DHCP client device may receive a duplicate 
IP address or not be able to connect to hosts outside the local subnet. These 
connectivity issues may be time consuming and difficult to troubleshoot. If 
you do set up DHCP for practice, I recommend that you install the server on 
an isolated network to prevent potential issues and unnecessary trouble-
shooting. The entire DHCP process is discussed in the upcoming material. 

Common Network Protocols and Services  
37
When a network device is confi gured to get an IP address, it will automatically be 
assigned one address from a DHCP server. In addition to the IP address, the device will 
receive any other properties that were assigned to it. Figure 2.6 shows a screen capture of 
how a Microsoft Windows–based device is confi gured to receive an IP address automati-
cally from a DHCP server. 
F I G U R E  2 .6   The TCP/IP Properties window on a Microsoft Windows 8 computer shows 
where to configure a device for DHCP.
Select to
Enable DHCP
There are several steps involved in the process of assigning and maintaining IP addresses 
on network devices. These are the four basic frames used with the DHCP process to obtain 
an IP address: 
 
■
DHCP discover message
 
■
DHCP offer message
 
■
DHCP request message
 
■
DHCP acknowledgment message

38 
Chapter 2 ■ Common Network Protocols and Ports
Obtaining an IP Address Using Dynamic Host Conﬁ guration 
Protocol (DHCP)
The following steps show the process, through a series of exchanged messages between 
a client device and a DHCP server, that the client device will use to obtain an IP address 
using the DHCP protocol:
1. 
DHCP discover message (DHCPDiscover). This is the ﬁ rst message sent in the DHCP 
process. It is a broadcast message from the client device requesting IP information 
from available DHCP servers.
2. 
DHCP offer message (DHCPOffer). Every DHCP server that “hears” the DHCP dis-
cover message will respond with an offer to the client device that made the request 
if it has the ability to service that request. The DHCP offer message contains an IP 
address and subnet mask address from an available range or scope of addresses. 
It will also have additional TCP/IP information that is made available to the device, 
such as the default gateway address and DNS and domain name information. Keep in 
mind that the requesting client device may receive offers from several DHCP servers 
and will choose the best one based on the operating system used. A device using the 
Microsoft Windows operating system will choose the ﬁ rst offer it receives.
3. 
DHCP request message (DHCPRequest). This message contains the IP address that 
the client device selected from the IP address range in the DHCP offer message that 
was sent from the server. It is also used for renewing the lease that it chose when it 
ﬁ rst obtained the IP address.
4. 
DHCP acknowledgment message (DHCPAck). This is a message sent from the DHCP 
server to the client device that will acknowledge the previous DHCP request mes-
sage. Any additional conﬁ gured TCP/IP options are also sent with this message. Once 
this process is complete, the client device will be able to send and receive data using 
TCP/IP. 
There are several other DHCP messages that may be used for various reasons. These are 
DHCPNAK, DHCPDecline, DHCPRelease and DHCPInform. 
The DHCP server will be confi gured to provide IP addresses for a specifi c period of time 
known as a lease. The time of the lease will depend on the specifi c application or environ-
ment where the DHCP server is used. A device confi gured to automatically receive an IP 
address will attempt to renew its lease after 50 percent of the lease time has expired. This is 
the default renew time. However, the DHCP server may have an option to allow a different 

Common Network Protocols and Services

renew time. If for some reason the client device cannot renew the lease after 50 percent of 
the time has elapsed, the renewal period will shorten for subsequent renewal attempts. This 
can be a disadvantage for devices that have short lease periods because it may cause a lot of 
extra network traffi c. Short lease periods are often used where there may be a limited num-
ber of IP addresses available or in areas where devices may be connected to the network for 
shorter periods of time. Figure 2.7 shows the ipconfig /all command displaying the lease 
time of an assigned DHCP IP address.

computer to display the DHCP server IP information lease time
DHCP Lease Time
As you can see in Figure 2.7, the lease time in this case is set for 24 hours. If the pool of 
addresses you have is larger than the number of client devices, a longer lease period should 
not be a problem. 
The computer operating system in use will determine what action the client device 
takes if an IP address cannot be obtained from a DHCP server. Microsoft Windows uses 
a service called Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA). This service became available 
with Windows 98 and is now available in all versions of the Microsoft Windows operating 
system. APIPA is designed to provide an IP address automatically to any computer network 
device requesting one that is connected to a common LAN. APIPA does not require the use 
of a DHCP server. It also eliminates the need for users to manually set up IP addressing 
on all the devices. An APIPA address will be in the 169.254.yyy.zzz range. For example, a 
device such as a notebook computer may have an APIPA address such as 169.254.100.20. 
If DHCP services are running on the LAN and a device cannot obtain an address from the 
server, or if DHCP services are not available, an APIPA address will be issued.
In exercise 2.1 you will use the Microsoft Windows ipconfig.exe utility to view DHCP 
information.

Viewing DHCP Information
In this exercise you will view the DHCP information on a Microsoft Windows computer. 
This exercise assumes you are using a Windows-based computer connected to a network 
running a DHCP server service. The following steps were created using the Microsoft 
Windows 7 operating system. If you are using a different version of the operating system, 
these steps may vary slightly.
1. 
Click the Start button on the lower-left side of the Desktop.
2. 
Click the All Programs arrow.
3. 
Navigate to and click the Accessories folder icon.
4. 
Click the command prompt icon. A command prompt window will appear on the 
screen.
5. 
Type ipconfig /all at the command prompt window and press the Enter key. You 
will see a result similar to the following screen capture.
6. 
Scroll through the command prompt and observe the DHCP-related information.
7. 
Type exit and press the Enter key to close the command prompt window. 
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
Managing devices on a TCP/IP network can be accomplished by using Simple Network 
Management Protocol (SNMP), an Application layer protocol. The following infrastruc-
ture devices can be managed:

■
Network servers
 
■
Network routers
 
■
Ethernet switches
 
■
Wireless LAN controllers
 
■

SNMP uses several components to aid in the management of these devices: 
The SNMP Manager  This is the device that will perform the setup and management 
of devices using the SNMP protocol and provides communication to the other network 
devices to be managed. This may be a server running SNMP management software or an 
appliance. The SNMP manager will send commands and also receive traps.
The Devices to Be Managed  These are the devices mentioned earlier and include network 
servers, routers, Ethernet switches, wireless LAN controllers, and others. They will be con-
trolled or managed by the SNMP manager.
The SNMP Agent Program  The SNMP agent can be local or remote. The agent is on the 
SNMP device to be managed and will respond to commands sent from the SNMP manager.
The Management Information Base (MIB)  The MIB is on the managed device and con-
tains information about that device and how it can be managed. There are standard MIBs, 
but there are also proprietary MIBs that are unique to the manufacturer of the device. 
Figure 2.8 shows SNMP managed devices on a local area network.

There have been several different versions of SNMP, some more secure than others. 
Depending on the version used, anyone with the proper knowledge and tools can monitor a 
network and possibly compromise its security. 

42 
Chapter 2 ■ Common Network Protocols and Ports
SNMPv1  This was the fi rst version of SNMP and uses UDP for communications.  SNMP 
v1 uses community-based security and therefore is not considered secure because the com-
munity string value that equates to a password is transmitted in cleartext.
SNMPv2c  This version of SNMP provided some enhancements. However, like SNMPv1, 
this version uses community-based security. 
SNMPv3  This is the newest version of the protocol and provides secure communications. 
SNMP v3 requires user-based authentication and is therefore the most secure. This version 
should be used when possible. 
Network Address Translation (NAT)
In the mid-1990s, the use of the Internet along with the TCP/IP protocols was fueled by the 
release of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and the World Wide Web. The heavily 
used Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) of assigning IP addresses was in jeopardy because of 
the increased use of TCP/IP networks. Because the IPv4 mechanism has a fi nite number of 
addresses, there was a possibility of running out of IP addresses. Table 2.1 shows the num-
ber of IPV4 addresses available based on the IP address class.

Newer technology, Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6), was the answer to the IPv4 
address limitation issue. As you learned in Chapter 1, IPv4 uses 32-bit binary addresses; 
there is a limit to the number of possible public addresses, as shown in Table 2.1. Keep 
in mind that all of the Class A addresses were reserved by organizations and companies 
early on and therefore not available to the general public. The IPv6 method of addressing 
new IP technology is what was going to solve the problem of IP address exhaustion. IPv6 
uses 128 bits (2128), which equates to a potential 3.4 × 1038 IP addresses. That’s a lot of IP 
addresses. The switch to IPv6 would not be an easy task. Computer operating systems, 
servers, and network infrastructure hardware lacked support for IPv6, causing delays in the 
implementation. 
So why all of this discussion about IP addresses or potential lack thereof? Well, this is 
where Network Address Translation (NAT) technology comes into action. NAT allows the 
use of a “private” IP address network for internal use and mapping it to a single “public” 
IP address connected to the Internet. This is accomplished by modifying the header in the 
IPv4 packet, which is where the term address translation comes in. NAT allows for a home 
network, a very small organization, or even a very large organization to be represented 

Common Network Protocols and Services  
43
by a single public IP address on the Internet. It is addressed in RFC 2663 and allows for 
the continued use of IPv4 without having to worry about potentially running out of IPv4 
addresses. NAT consists of different implementations. The following are two common 
implementations:
 
■
One-to-one NAT
 
■
One-to-many NAT
One-to-one NAT will map an IP address on the outside to an IP address on the inside. 
This can be accomplished through either a static assignment or a dynamic assignment. The 
static NAT entry is a permanent entry and needs to change manually. The dynamic pro-
cess is useful when there are a limited number of addresses and the one-to-one assignment 
occurs when needed. 
One-to-many NAT allows for the translation of one single public IP address on the out-
side of a network to service many devices with IP addresses on the inside network. This is 
accomplished by modifying the information in the IP packet. Figure 2.9 shows how NAT 
on a DSL router or cable modem will provide IP address translation. Notice that the private 
IP addresses on the private side of the router in this example are in the 192.168.0.X range. 
These private IP addresses will be translated to the single public IP address 172.10.5.20 on 
the public-facing side.

Chapter 2 ■ Common Network Protocols and Ports
Port Address Translation (PAT)
Port Address Translation (PAT) is a technology that works in conjunction with NAT. The 
objective of PAT is to provide a unique TCP port to the IP address of each device that is 
sending information across the network translating device, such as a home broadband 
router, for example. This will ensure that the information that is received will be directed 
to the correct device on the private network. The TCP port becomes part of the device’s 
TCP/IP address to uniquely identify that device on the private side of the NAT device so it 
can send and receive data using the single public IP address. You can see in Figure 2.9 that 
each device on the private network is assigned its own unique TCP port. 
Domain Name System (DNS)
In Chapter 1, you learned that an IP address is a logical address that will identify a device 
on a network and utilizes the TCP/IP protocols. This could be limited to a single LAN, 
a private routed WAN, or even across a wide area public network like the Internet. The 
 logical address is mapped to the device physical network MAC address. In some operat-
ing systems, a program exists that will allow a user to manipulate the ARP cache data. A 
simple command-line utility such as arp.exe will allow you to see this logical-to-physical-
address mapping. In the Microsoft Windows operating system, for example, you can enter 
arp.exe -a in a command prompt window to see it. 
So where does Domain Name System (DNS) fi t in? DNS will allow for the mapping 
of Layer 3 IP addresses to logical hostnames. DNS is a hierarchical naming system for all 
TCP/IP devices connected to the Internet or internal to an organization. One commonly 
used analogy to help understand this concept is a telephone book or an address book that 
maps people and company names with telephone numbers. It would diffi cult for you to 
remember the telephone numbers of everyone you came in contact with or someone you 
wanted to contact at a later time, making an address book or contact list a great resource. 
You will look up the person’s name in the index and see the telephone number to call. 
Could you imagine using a web browser to access a website and having to know the IP 
address of the target web server? It would be very diffi cult if not impossible for most people 
to remember. DNS simplifi es this by mapping the web server’s IP address to its associated 
domain name. All you need to do is type the domain name address in your web browser 
and DNS will do the rest. Figure 2.10 shows how DNS would play a role in a network. 
In its simplest form, the hosts fi le on your local computer’s hard drive is a form of DNS. 
The hosts fi le on a Microsoft Windows–based computer is located in the C:\Windows\
System32\Drivers\Etc folder. This fi le has an IP-address-to-name mapping for the local 
computer. One common entry you will see is “127.0.0.1 localhost.” The localhost identi-
fi es your computer directly. If you were to enter the PING 127.0.0.1 command, you would 
be communicating with your local device. This is also known as the loopback address. If 
you knew the IP address of a remote web server and mapped that IP address to the web 

Common Network Protocols and Services  
45
server’s domain name by typing it in your local hosts fi le, you would not need any DNS 
server on the network. So theoretically DNS is a really big hosts fi le. Please note that I am 
not trying to downplay or lessen the importance of DNS because it is a critical part of any 
network, but the objective here is to provide an overview and basic understanding of the 
service and process.

Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
If you have ever used the PING command utility, you have used Internet Control Message 
Protocol (ICMP). ICMP is used to send error messages, such as when a device cannot be 
reached using the PING command and for other diagnostic and troubleshooting purposes. 
ICMP is located at the same layer as the IP protocol and does not rely on IP as TCP does. 
Although this protocol was designed with the good intentions of error identifi cation, 
determining if a remote host is available, and helping to determine network congestion, a 
computer hacker could use it for malicious purposes. For example, a hacker could perform 
an ICMP denial of service (DoS) attack and cause dropped connections. These types of 
attacks are commonly prevented by through the use of fi rewall confi gurations and other 
security measures. For example, Microsoft Windows’s built-in fi rewall software will not 
allow ICMP traffi c unless it is enabled to do so. 
Figure 2.11 shows a packet trace of the PING command and ICMP.

Understanding Ports, Protocols, and 
Sockets
Let’s start by learning about ports. When network devices are communicating with the 
TCP/IP suite of protocols and using a protocol such as TCP or UDP, a port must also be 
defi ned. A port is a number that is assigned to a protocol. There are a total of 65,535 pos-
sible ports in the Internet protocol suite. The fi rst 1,024 are reserved and assigned to some 
of the common protocols we use every day, such as SMTP, POP3, and IMAP. To under-
stand network ports, think of offi ce suite numbers in a multitenant offi ce building. Suppose 
an offi ce building has a street address of 100 Main Street and in the building there are 25 
offi ce suites, each housing a different business. For you to a send a package to the business 
in Suite 200, you would address it to 100 Main Street, Suite 200. 100 Main Street is equiv-
alent to the IP address and 200 is equivalent to the port number.  Figure 2.12 shows how 
TCP ports are used with specifi c protocols and IP addresses. 
It is possible to change the default ports that are assigned to a protocol. However, if the 
default port number is changed, it may cause some communication issues. If you change 
the assigned port number, the users need to know the port number to use the protocol or 
service. As a general practice, you should avoid changing the default port numbers assigned 
to common protocols.

“Send this package to HTTP 'R US.
Their address is 192.168.300.20
Suite 80”
If you are using a nonstandard port, you may need to identify the port 
number after the IP address, separated by a colon symbol. For example, 
a network infrastructure device such as a router has an IP address of 
192.168.100.250 and is using port 8080 for the administration interface. To 
access the management page, the proper syntax for the browser would be 
192.168.100.250:8080. 
When dealing with TCP/UDP ports, you may run across the term socket. A socket is 
created from a combination of an IP address and a port number. This is analogous to a tele-
phone extension number when you call a business. If you were to call the main telephone 

48 
Chapter 2 ■ Common Network Protocols and Ports
number of a company, the answering service may require a specifi c extension number in 
order for you to reach a person directly. Upon entering the telephone extension number, 
you are directed to the specifi c person you are trying to reach. In other words, a TCP/UDP 
socket is the combination of an IP address and a port number and therefore is the endpoint 
of a specifi c connection. 
The upcoming sections look at some common network protocols and the TCP ports they 
use for communication. You will also learn what the port numbers are that are assigned to 
the common protocols discussed in this chapter. 
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol is used in conjunction with other protocols 
to allow for secure network communications using the Internet Protocol (IP). In 1994, 
Netscape Communications Corporation developed SSL to provide security with the 
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).  The TCP/IP suite and native protocols of the 
Internet alone are not secure. Therefore, additional security measures to prevent attacks 
and intrusion were required to provide a secure method of transferring information across 
the Internet. 
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) provided some relief to these concerns. The development 
of SSL, now at version 3 (SSLv3), paved the way to secure protocols used on the Internet 
such as FTP, SMTP, POP, and IMAP. SSL evolved into what we know as Transport Layer 
Security (TLS). In January 1999, TLS 1.0 was defi ned in RFC 2246. At the time, it was 
intended to be an upgrade to the most current version of SSL, SSLv3. TLS has since been 
revised several times to add enhancements and to keep up-to-date with the latest security 
threats. TLS 1.2 is the most recent version, defi ned in RFC 5246 in 2008. Both SSL and 
TLS rely on a public key infrastructure (PKI) and X.509 certifi cates that use asymmetric 
cryptography. More detail on PKI and certifi cates will be discussed in Chapter 16, “Device 
Authentication and Data Encryption.”
The admin subnet website is a great online reference that provides several 
helpful tools, including IPv4 Subnet Calculator, Password Generator, MAC 
Address Finder, and TCP/UDP Port Finder. To use these tools and additional 
information, visit the admin subnet website at www.adminsub.net. 
Common Protocols for File Transfer
Transferring fi les is a common use of a computer network. In many cases, a user may not 
even realize they are performing this function and using these protocols while they are con-
nected to a network or to the Internet. In the following sections, you will learn about sev-
eral fi le transfer protocols and the ports that they are assigned to operate with. 

Common Protocols for File Transfer 
49
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) – 20/21
The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a commonly used protocol and has been for decades. 
As the name implies, FTP is used to transfer fi les from one device (or host) to another. One 
thing to keep in mind is that there are some potential security risks with FTP. These are 
addressed in the upcoming exercises and in the following sections, “File Transfer Protocol 
Secure (FTPS) – 990” and “Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) – 22.” 
Unlike many of the other commonly used protocols, FTP requires two TCP ports to 
operate. One port is for the commands, or control, and the other port is for the data that is 
transferred. The default FTP server ports are 20 and 21.
Port 20  Used for the actual transfer of data. All FTP commands are processed over 
port 21.
Port 21  Used for control type messages and to establish an FTP session. When the FTP 
service is started, this is the port that listens for FTP requests. Once an FTP request is initi-
ated by a remote host, messages with information such as the user’s authentication creden-
tials will be exchanged. Once the username and password is validated, a fi le transfer can 
be issued over port 20. Other FTP commands will also be sent over port 21. Figure 2.13 
illustrates a common FTP setup.

FTP can operate in one of two modes, active mode or passive mode. Selecting which 
mode to use is performed in the client-side FTP settings or by use of a command sent to the 
server.
FTP Active Mode  In this operation mode, the client is in charge of which port the FTP 
server will use for control and transfer of information. In other words, the client device that 
initiated the FTP session will connect from a random port greater than 1023 to connect to 
the FTP server’s port 21. This will identify to the server which client-side port to use for the 
data transfer. 

50 
Chapter 2 ■ Common Network Protocols and Ports
FTP Passive Mode  In this mode, the FTP server will decide which port the client will use 
for listening and tell the client device which port to use for the data transfer. Passive mode 
works much better with a client’s fi rewall confi guration because of potential ports blocked 
by the fi rewall. 
To use FTP on a computer, you need to install the proper software. Fortunately, install-
ing the software is pretty straightforward, regardless of whether you are setting up a client 
or a server. In exercise 2.2 you will install an open-source version of FTP server software. 
This will allow you to become familiar with how the FTP protocol operates from a server 
perspective. Exercise 2.3 teaches you how to install FTP client software.

13. Browse through the menu options to familiarize yourself with the FileZilla FTP client 
program. If you installed the FTP server software on a different computer, you can 
perform simple transfers between the FTP client program you installed and the FTP 
server program you installed on the other computer. Otherwise, you can connect to a 
trusted known FTP server on the Internet and perform some FTP ﬁ le transfers. 
If you do not plan to use the FTP client software, you can uninstall the 
program.
File Transfer Protocol Secure (FTPS) – 990
FTP uses cleartext for both client authentication and data transfer. This means that anyone 
listening to the medium with the appropriate knowledge and with software tools such as a 
packet analyzer will be able to capture the client credentials and see the information that is 
transferred during the FTP session. This can be more of an issue if the device that is con-
nected is using a wireless network because wireless is not bounded by any physical medium 
such as an Ethernet connection. All unsecured information traversing the air in cleartext 
can be seen if the traffi c is captured. 
This is where File Transfer Protocol Secure (FTPS) comes into action. (Do not to con-
fuse this with SFTP, which is discussed in the next section.) FTPS is a secure method for 
transferring data using FTP. FTPS uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer 
Security (TLS) to secure the communications and operates on port 990. You may also see 
this identifi ed as FTP-SSL. You learned about SSL earlier in this chapter. FTPS will allow 
for a secure fi le transfer using FTP. This secure SSL connection will encrypt your login cre-
dentials (username and password) and the data that is being transferred. You may be famil-
iar with SSL from using your browser. Any secure website you connect to, such as online 
banking and e-commerce websites and some web-based email services, use this technology. 
The requirements for using FTPS are as follows: 
 
■
An FTP server configured for SSL connections
 
■
An FTP client software program that will support SSL connections
Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) – 22
Another secure method for performing fi le transfers using FTP is Secure File Transfer 
Protocol (SFTP). As you learned in the previous section, FTPS uses port 990 and is based 
on Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS). In contrast, SFTP uses 
Secure Shell (SSH) via port 22 to transfer fi les. SSH is a redirection over a specifi c port to 
ensure that the information (both control and data) that is sent and received is secure. TCP 
port 22 is the standard port assigned for communication with SSH servers. 
SFTP is not the only protocol that uses SSH. Command-line utilities such as Telnet and 
other programs or protocols can use SSH to protect data. In addition to its use for secure 

58 
Chapter 2 ■ Common Network Protocols and Ports
fi le transfers, SSH port 22 is commonly used by network administrators to remotely man-
age network devices via a command-line interface. 
Secure Copy Protocol (SCP) – 22
There is a protocol available that is designed to allow secure transfer of fi les between two 
hosts that can be a combination of a local and a remote host or two remote hosts. The 
Secure Copy Protocol (SCP) uses SSH port 22 and will provide a network administrator or 
a user with the ability to securely transfer fi les such as fi rmware for infrastructure devices 
over a secure SSH tunnel. However, it can be used to transfer any type of fi les. Copying 
fi les via the SCP protocol is done either by using a set of command options in an operat-
ing system such as Unix or by using a program. So the acronym SCP could mean either 
Secure Copy Protocol or Secure Copy Program. One example of an open-source Microsoft 
Windows–based SCP program is WinSCP. 
Common Protocols Used 
with Messaging
In the following sections, you will learn about the different protocols used with messaging. 
The objective here is to provide an overview of some of the protocols used with email, noti-
fi cation, and instant messaging. 
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) – 25
Not long ago, electronic mail (email) was new technology, and many people didn’t use it 
and claimed they didn’t need it. Now it is diffi cult to live without it; it’s a big part of daily 
life, both business and personal. Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is the Internet 
standard that electronic mail services use to send and receive email messages. SMTP uses 
TCP port 25 for communications and is used to send email messages from client to server 
and to send and receive email messages between servers. The steps for a client device using 
SMTP to send an email message are as follows: 
1. 
The user creates an email message using an email client software program.
2. 
The user will then send the email message to the email server using SMTP via port 25.
3. 
The SMTP email server queues the message it received from the sending client device.
4. 
The SMTP email server sends the message to the recipient’s email server via SMTP.
5. 
The email message is now ready to be retrieved from the recipient’s email server using 
the desired protocol: POP3, IMAP, or another protocol of choice.

Internet Connections
Many networks, broadband wireless providers, and Internet service providers (ISPs) 
block SMTP port 25. Blocking this default assigned port for SMTP helps prevent malicious 
attacks such as email spamming. There is an alternate port for SMTP that can be used by 
the email client device in some cases. This is TCP port 587. To enable this alternate SMTP 
port, simply enter port 587 instead of port 25 in your email client software confi guration 
screen. 
Earlier in this chapter you learned about Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and 
how it secures communications if used with certain protocols. It is pos-
sible to secure SMTP by using SMTP over SSL. This is accomplished by 
using TCP port number 465, which will secure the SMTP information using 
SSL. With SSL, this is known as SMTPS or SSMTP. Keep in mind this is 
a two-part process. In other words, both the client and the server must 
be enabled with SSL to use this secure method of communication. If you 
enable your email client software and the server is not configured for 
SMTPS, you will not be able to send email messages over a secure connec-
tion. Currently, not many ISPs support SMTPS port 465.

Chapter 2 ■ Common Network Protocols and Ports
Message Retrieval Protocols
You just learned that Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), port 25, is used for a client 
device to send an email to its local email server and for sending and receiving email mes-
sages from server to server on the network backend. Now you will learn about some of the 
protocols that can receive the messages queued at the user’s email server. There are three 
common protocols used for email message retrieval: 
 
■
Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3) 
 
■
Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)
 
■
Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI)
Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3) – 110
Post Offi ce Protocol 3 (POP3), port 110, is used by client devices to retrieve email from 
a remote email server using the TCP/IP protocol suite. The most current specifi cation for 
POP3 is defi ned in IETF RFC 1939. The original POP protocol standard was released in 
1994 and specifi ed in RFC 918. POP3 is a commonly used email message retrieval protocol. 
As shown in Figure 2.15, when a user connects to their email server using POP3, the 
messages are downloaded to the local client device. This will limit the user from accessing 
the email from a second client device and without confi guring the client to leave messages 
on the server it is valid for only for a one-time connection to the email server. 
F I G U R E  2 .15   The POP3 process
1) Email is sent to server 
 
using SMTP port 25.
2) Email is queued on server.
3) Email is retrieved from the
 
server using POP3 port 110.
4) Email message is deleted 
 
from the email server.

Common Protocols Used with Messaging  
61
Some email software, such as Microsoft’s Outlook email program, have advanced set-
tings to allow messages to remain on the server permanently or for some extended period 
of time after they have been retrieved from a POP3 client device. Confi guring the client 
software in this manner will allow a user to retrieve their email from a second device even 
though POP3 was not designed to work that way. 
One advantage to using this protocol is that the email messages are stored locally on 
the user’s device and can be viewed offl ine. Therefore, a connection to the Internet is not 
required for working with the email messages stored locally on the client device. 
The steps for a client device to use POP3 are as follows:
1. 
The email message is sent to the server using SMTP port 25.
2. 
The email is queued on the server.
3. 
The email is retrieved from the server using POP3 port 110.
4. 
The email message is deleted from the email server. 
Without any additional security measures in place, POP3 sends informa-
tion in cleartext. This includes username, passwords, and all of the email 
data. This can pose a security risk, especially for devices that are con-
nected to an open wireless network. If POP3 is used, I recommend that 
you verify that proper security measures such as a virtual private network 
(VPN) or SSL connection are in place. The TCP port for POP3S (POP3 over 
SSL) is port 995. Unfortunately, not many ISPs currently support POP3S. 
Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) – 143
Like POP3, the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) is another Application layer 
Internet protocol that allows a client device to access email on a remote email server. IMAP 
uses port 143 for communications, and IMAP4 is the latest version. IMAP4 is defi ned in 
IETF RFC 1730. 
As shown in Figure 2.16, the main difference between IMAP and POP3 is that the mes-
sages are not downloaded locally to the client device’s email software program. Instead, the 
email remains on the email server for retrieval from any device with an Internet connection 
and the proper credentials to authenticate to the email server. Depending on the email client 
software used and how it is confi gured, the email may be cached on the local client device 
while the user is using the email program. Any changes are then synchronized between the 
email client device and the email server. This will allow for current information to be avail-
able whenever the user connects to their email server from any client device.

F I G U R E  2 .16   The IMAP protocol process. Notice how it’s different than POP3.
1) Email is sent to server

2) Email is stored on server.
3) Email is synchronized to
 
client using IMAP port 143.
 4) Email message is not deleted
 
and is retained on the
 
email server. This is the main
 
difference from POP3.
Email Client - User1

Email Client - User2
One disadvantage to IMAP is that the email messages may not be available on the local 
device for viewing without an active Internet connection. Therefore, if an Internet connec-
tion is not available, you may not be able to see or reply to messages and queue them for 
handling at a later time. 
The steps for a client device to use POP3 are as follows:
1. 
The email message is sent to the server using SMTP port 25.
2. 
The email message is stored on the server.
3. 
The email is synchronized to the email client using IMAP port 143.
4. 
The email message is not deleted and is retained on the email server. This is the main 
difference from POP3. 
As with POP3, without any additional security measures in place, IMAP sends informa-
tion in cleartext. This includes all of the information transmitted—the username, pass-
words, and all of the email data. This can pose a security risk, especially for devices that 
are connected to an open wireless network. If IMAP is used, I recommend that you verify 
that proper security measures such as a virtual private network (VPN) or SSL connection 
are in place. The TCP port for IMAPS (IMAP over SSL) is port 993. 
Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI) – 135
In the previous sections you learned that POP3 and IMAP are standards-based, com-
monly used email message retrieval protocols. Another available email retrieval protocol 
is Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI). This is a proprietary protocol 
created by Microsoft. MAPI is a messaging architecture and an application programming 

Common Protocols Used with Messaging  
63
interface (API) based on the Component Object Model (COM) for the Microsoft Windows 
operating system. It uses port 135 for communications. 
If your network is confi gured to use a Microsoft Exchange email server and you 
are using Microsoft’s Outlook email client, you will be able to use the MAPI protocol. 
However, other third-party email client software may also include MAPI protocol func-
tionality. The following computer application programs can be used and integrated via 
email messaging with the MAPI protocol: 
 
■
Word processing applications
 
■
Spreadsheet applications
 
■
Graphics applications
The MAPI protocol is best used for internal or intranet email services with Microsoft 
Exchange Server and typically does not work well from outside an organization. 
Figure 2.17 shows a screen capture for confi guring an email account with MAPI and 
other email retrieval protocols. If you were to select Microsoft Exchange Server so that you 
can set up MAPI, you would be instructed to provide additional information to complete 
the setup process.

Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) – 2195 / 2196
Developed by Apple Inc., the Apple Push Notifi cation Service (APNS) uses a native push 
notifi cation technology. This technology allows a mobile device such as the iPad, iPhone, 
and others to receive information even when the destination application (app) is not open 

64 
Chapter 2 ■ Common Network Protocols and Ports
or running. APNS is a required protocol for Apple iOS mobile device management enroll-
ments and therefore is dependent on the Apple iOS platform. Apple’s APNS became avail-
able with iOS 3.0 in 2009. iOS apps can provide three types of push notifi cations:
 
■
Sounds: An audible alert plays.
 
■
Graphical alerts/banners: An alert or banner appears on the screen.
 
■
Badges: An image or number appears on the application icon.
Figure 2.18 shows an example of an APNS banner alert.

Each app on your device will need to be confi gured to use APNS. The following compo-
nents are required:
 
■
Application server
 
■
X.509 certificate
 
■
Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) server
 
■
Mobile device
 
■
App configured for APNS
A valid encrypted IP session is established between the mobile device and APNS. The 
device will receive all notifi cations over this SSL/TLS IP session. The device must obtain a

token that contains information that will allow the service to locate the device where the 
app is installed. 
Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol 
(XMPP) – 5223
With the evolution of mobile technology, instant messaging (IM) has become a popular 
way to communicate. One common protocol used for instant messaging is Extensible 
Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP). This protocol was originally known as Jabber 
and became XMPP after the IETF created the open standard. It is used with a variety of 
commonly available applications and services including these: 
 
■
Jabber
 
■
Google Talk (now Google+ Hangouts)
 
■
Jabber Extensible Communications Platform (XCP)
Google Talk, now called Google+ Hangouts, has moved away from XMPP 
and now uses a proprietary communication technology.
Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) – 5228
Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) operates on port 5228. GCM is a free service regardless 
of your messaging needs. It allows for data to be sent from your server to your Android-
based devices. It also allows you to receive messages from devices on the same connection. 
Like Apple Push Notifi cation Services, GCM is a push notifi cation service. It handles 
all aspects of queuing of messages and delivery to the target Android application running 
on the target client device. Basically, GCM is used to send messages to Android-enabled 
devices. 
Here are some specifi c details regarding GCM:
 
■
It provides a free push notification service.
 
■
It can handle a maximum of 4 KB of data. 
 
■
Data can be queued for up to four weeks.
 
■
The application is not required to be active to receive messages.
 
■
It does not poll servers for updated data.
 
■
The device must have a Google account enabled.
The GCM server is the “middleman” between the Android device and the server hosting 
the application. Figure 2.19 shows the steps for the GCM process.

Other Common Protocols
In the following sections, you will learn about other common protocols in the TCP/IP suite. 
These protocols are used for accessing the Internet using a graphical user interface, syn-
chronization of data between devices, remote computer access, and message routing.
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) – 80
Prior to the mid-1990s, the Internet was text based and was not widely used by the general 
population. It consisted of a text-based interface and mainframe computer devices and was 
used mostly by educational organizations and the government. With the introduction of the 
World Wide Web (WWW) in the mid-1990s, the Internet exploded in popularity. This is 
largely due to the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which operates using TCP port 80. 
You are no stranger to this protocol. HTTP is an Application layer protocol providing 
the graphical user interface of the Internet that we have become accustomed to over the 
past 15+ years. HTTP uses a request/response model for communication. In other words, 
the client device will send an HTTP request to the server (such as a request to query to a 
database or submit an online form), and the server will provide a response to this request. 

Other Common Protocols 
67
Every time a user clicks an object such as an OK or Submit button on the graphical inter-
face, a request is sent to the server. At that point the server will respond in some fashion 
based on the context of the request. 
The following components make up the HTTP process:
 
■
A client device with a web browser
 
■
A TCP/IP connection
 
■
A server hosting a website 
The server must host a web server software program of some type in order to respond to 
the HTTP requests from the client. 
Figure 2.20 shows a basic HTTP network confi guration with a local web server and 
remote web server request/response scenario.

As with some of the other protocols you learned about in this chapter, such as POP3 and 
IMAP, information is transmitted in cleartext. Therefore, your username, password, and 
other information can potentially be seen by anyone with the knowledge and correct soft-
ware tools to capture this information. Proper security mechanisms should be put in place 
to protect sensitive information and prevent malicious attacks. 
One common way to secure the communication session when using HTTP is to use 
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or HTTPS. The SSL port for HTTPS is port 443. Many con-
tent providers such as online banking and email services now provide HTTPS as the 
default protocol when you connect to their web servers. The secure connection will remain 
intact for the entire session to provide adequate security for all information, not only the 

68 
Chapter 2 ■ Common Network Protocols and Ports
username and password during logon. Google by default will now send you to an HTTPS 
session for any device that uses the Google search engine, even if you aren’t specifi cally 
logged in to Google’s services. 
By default, Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) information sent over port 
80 is cleartext data. I highly recommend that you use HTTPS port 443 for 
accessing any web-based sensitive information over the Internet. In some 
cases, the HTTPS port 443 protocol is available only for a login session for 
the user to authenticate to a web server. After the credentials are verified, 
the SSL session is dropped and the remaining data is sent via HTTP port 80 
in cleartext. With open 802.11 wireless hotspots, the threat is even greater 
because the information is sent over the air via radio frequency, which is 
an unbounded medium. Always read, understand, and comply with any 
warning messages you may see when they pertain to web server and SSL 
security. 
Microsoft Desktop AirSync Protocol (AirSync) – 2175
As the name implies, the Microsoft Desktop AirSync Protocol (AirSync) will provide syn-
chronization of email, contacts, calendar items, and other information from a messaging 
server to mobile devices using wireless networking connectivity. AirSync is now better 
known as Microsoft Exchange Active Sync (EAS) protocol. EAS includes the following 
features: 
 
■
It’s based on Extensible Markup Language (XML).
 
■
It communicates over HTTPS.
 
■
It’s considered a de facto standard for synchronization.
 
■
It’s licensed by Microsoft to other collaboration platforms.
 
■
It’s supported on a variety of smartphone platforms. 
Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) – 3389
With a need for remote access, Microsoft developed a proprietary protocol called Remote 
Desktop Protocol (RDP) to allow remote connections to other computers on a network. 
This protocol will enable a device running the Microsoft Windows operating system to 
allow other client devices to remotely connect and control the computer. To use RDP, two 
components are required:
RDP Server Software  RDP server software is built into the Microsoft Windows operating 
system starting with Windows XP. Formerly known as Microsoft Terminal Services, this is 
now called Remote Desktop Services. 

Other Common Protocols 
69
RDP Client Software  RDP client devices are not required to be using the Windows 
Microsoft operating system to connect to a computer running the RDP server software. 
The following list shows the various devices that can be an RDP client:

Server Routing Protocol (SRP) – 4101
TCP port 4101 is identifi ed for offi cial use by the Service Name and Transport Protocol 
Port Number Registry, www.iana.org, as a Braille protocol. However, an unoffi cial use is 
for the BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES), which allows a BlackBerry mobile device user 
to communicate with their computer remotely to provide synchronization of information. 

70 
Chapter 2 ■ Common Network Protocols and Ports
This port is typically blocked in fi rewalls and may need to be opened in order for this 
feature to work correctly, depending on the confi guration. 
The BES is designed for enterprise organizations that have their own onsite email ser-
vices such as Microsoft Exchange or Novell Groupwise and require a high level of informa-
tion technology (IT) control. This includes email redirection and synchronization of other 
information such as calendars and contacts. 
Following is an overview of the basic steps involved in using the BlackBerry Enterprise 
Server. A fi ctitious company named XYZ using Microsoft Exchange email services is used. 
You are using the Microsoft Outlook email client program for email services: 
1. 
An email message addressed to you arrives at your corporate email account from the 
Internet.
2. 
XYZ Company’s Microsoft Exchange email server receives the email message.
3. 
You receive the email message via your Microsoft Outlook email client program on 
your corporate computer.
4. 
The BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES) compresses the email message, encrypts it, and 
sends it to your BlackBerry device through the Internet and over your carrier’s cellular 
wireless network.
5. 
Your BlackBerry mobile device receives, decrypts, and decompresses the email message 
and then alerts you via a notification message. 
As shown in Figure 2.22, the BlackBerry router connects to the wireless carrier’s mobile 
network. It sends and receives data to and from the BlackBerry infrastructure on behalf of 
the organization’s BlackBerry Enterprise Server.

For security reasons, the BlackBerry router may be in the organization’s demilitarized 
zone (DMZ). The mobile device can create a direct connection between the device and the 
BlackBerry router over a corporate Wi-Fi network using port 4101. This direct connec-
tion between the mobile device and the BlackBerry router is referred to as the “least-cost”

route because it eliminates the cost of using the BlackBerry network infrastructure. If the 
BlackBerry router is placed in the DMZ as shown in Figure 2.22, you must open port 4101 
on the corporate fi rewall side to allow communication between the BlackBerry Device 
Manager and BlackBerry router. The end result is that a BlackBerry mobile device will be 
able to receive alerts from the BlackBerry Enterprise Server notifying the device’s owner of 
email and other messages. This synchronization allows for a convenient way to receive mes-
saging on the mobile device. 
Summary
There are many protocols that work with computer and Internet technology. The list con-
tinues to grow as mobility and mobile device innovation advances. In this chapter you 
learned about the four-layer Internet protocol suite, how it maps to the conceptual OSI 
model, and some common protocols that are used in computer and mobile device technol-
ogy. The following core protocols are among those that form the foundation of communi-
cations with mobile device technology: 
 
■
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
 
■
User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
 
■
Internet Protocol (IP)
These main protocols are responsible for the host-to-host connections that allow for the 
exchange of information (or data) between devices and are used with other Application 
layer protocols to provide the technology we use daily. You learned about some of the 
services that are used with these protocols for the distribution and management of TCP/
IP information, computer network device management, IP address to hostname resolution, 
and more: 
 
■
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
 
■
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
 
■
Network Address Translation (NAT)
 
■
Domain Name System (DNS)
 
■
Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
This chapter also provided a survey of various common protocols and ports that are 
used with computers and mobile device communication. Remember, there are a total 
of 65,535 possible ports in the Internet protocol suite. The fi rst 1,024 are reserved and 
assigned to some of the common protocols we use every day. This chapter noted the specifi c 
ports used with the common protocols for the following technology and services:

This chapter included several exercises to give you the opportunity to install and test 
some of the services and protocols you learned about. 
Chapter Essentials
Understand the Internet protocol suite.  The Internet Protocol suite is the backbone 
of Internet communications. This four-layer model consists of the protocols that allow 
for network and Internet communications worldwide using the TCP/IP suite of proto-
cols. This model provides the Application layer protocols used with all forms of network 
communication.
Know the common core protocols and services.  TCP, UDP, and IP are the main protocols 
used for device communications and are the foundational protocols on the Internet. You 
should know that these protocols are used for either reliable or unreliable communications 
between two network or Internet hosts and for the addressing and routing of network data. 
Be familiar with common network services, including DHCP, DNS, SNMP, and NAT. 
These services are responsible for issuing network address information, managing network 
devices, and providing easy name resolution to the address of the network hosts.
Know how to install FTP server and client software.  A quick search of the Internet will 
allow you to fi nd both FTP server and FTP client software programs. Several of these 
programs are available at no charge. Others are for a limited time or are functionality 
evaluation versions. Installing and confi guring these programs will provide a better under-
standing of FTP and other fi le transfer protocols.
Understand the common protocols used for file transfer.  FTP, TFTP, FTPS, and SFTP 
are fi le transfer protocols. FTP requires authentication and TFTP does not. These are com-
monly used protocols that are used in many areas of Internet communications. Understand 
that FTP and TFTP are protocols that send all information, including usernames and pass-
words, in cleartext and are a potential security threat. FTPS and SFTP will allow for the 
secure transfer of data. 
Understand the common protocols used with messaging.  Messaging across networks and 
worldwide communications is a major part of modern technology. Understand that SMTP, 
POP, IMAP, and MAPI are common standards based on proprietary protocols that are 
used with email services and technology. Knowing the pros and cons of these protocols will 
help you determine the best one to use based on your needs. APNS, XMPP, and GCM are 
some of the common notifi cation and instant messaging protocols for Apple, Android, and

other mobile devices. As with the email protocols, a basic understanding of how these oper-
ate is important.
Be familiar with additional common protocols.   The use of the Internet grew at a tre-
mendous pace with the development of HTTP and the World Wide Web in the mid-1990s. 
Almost all computers and mobile devices include technology that allows for web services. 
Because the Internet is accessible from virtually anywhere, security is a big concern. The 
development of Secure Sockets Layer technology helped alleviate some of these security 
concerns. If used correctly, SSL can help provide secure communications for HTTP and 
many other protocols.  Know that RDP, AirSync, and SRP are protocols used for remote 
computer access and to provide synchronization of email messages, contacts, and other 
information from a messaging server.

Radio frequency (RF) plays an essential role in wireless com-
puter networking and wireless cellular technology. Therefore, it 
is important to have an understanding of some of the basic RF 
concepts to help you better understand these wireless technologies. Radio waves are passed 
through the air (which is the medium) and are used to transfer information from one wire-
less device to another. Unlike physically wired computers and other network devices, which 
use a physical cable to communicate, wireless computer networks, cellular networks, and 
mobile devices use modulated radio waves and the air to communicate. 
With respect to wireless data communications, RF consists of high-frequency alternating 
current (AC) signals passing over a copper cable connected to an antenna. The antenna 
then transforms the signal into radio waves that propagate through the open air from a 
radio transmitter to a radio receiver.
In this chapter you will learn about the characteristics of radio frequency and explore con-
cepts such as the range and speed of RF transmissions. Range (how far radio waves will 
travel) and speed can both be affected by several environmental conditions or behaviors, 
such as refl ection, refraction, and scattering. 
Understanding the units in which RF is measured, such as watts (W), milliwatts (mW), and 
decibels (dB), is important to RF work. Antennas are an essential part of a successful wire-
less deployment, enabling modulated AC signals to send and receive across an unbounded 
medium (the air). 
This chapter will examine many factors that are involved in determining the proper antenna 
to be used in an application or deployment of a wireless infrastructure such as the type of 
installation (indoor or outdoor), frequency, electrical characteristics and intended use.
Radio Frequency Fundamentals
Radio frequency (RF) waves are used in a wide range of communications, including AM 
and FM radio, television, cordless phones, cell phones, wireless broadband, wireless com-
puter networks, and satellite communications. RF is around everyone and everything and 
comes in many forms. RF energy is emitted from numerous devices that use it for various 
types of communications. For the most part, it is invisible to humans. There is so much of 
it around that if you could actually see the RF it would probably frighten you. Figure 3.1 
shows some of the many ways RF is used with technology and devices we use every day.
RF consists of high-frequency alternating current (AC) signals passing over a copper cable 
connected to an antenna. The antenna will then transform the signal into radio waves that 
propagate through the air. The most basic AC signal is a sine wave. The sine wave is the 
result of an electrical current that varies uniformly in voltage over a period of time. This 
sine wave cycle will repeat a specifi c number of times (cycles) over a period of 1 second. The

number of cycles per second will result in different frequencies. Frequency is discussed in 
more detail throughout this chapter. Figure 3.2 shows an example of a basic sine wave.

Chapter 3 ■ Radio Frequency and Antenna Technology Fundamentals
Successful radio transmissions consist of a minimum of two components: a radio trans-
mitter and radio receiver (see Figure 3.3). With either wireless cellular technology or wire-
less computer networking, a wireless device or station that can transmit and receive RF 
signals is known as a transceiver. These two components work together: for every radio 
transmitter there must be one or more radio receivers in order for the communications to be 
successful.

It is important to understand the basic characteristics of radio frequency transmissions 
such as wavelength, frequency, amplitude, and others. These characteristics work together 
to form the alternating current signals that carry information such as computer data from 
the device to the antenna. The antenna will then transform the signals into radio waves

that travel through the air carrying the information from the radio transmitter to the radio 
receiver. This is accomplished in different ways, depending on the wireless technology in 
use. This theory will be discussed in this chapter.
RF Regulatory Governing Bodies and 
Local Regulatory Authorities
Wireless devices of all types use radio frequency (RF) to communicate. The RF spec-
trum we use needs to be regulated to ensure correct use of the available allocated 
frequency bands. At the global level, the International Telecommunication Union – 
Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R) is responsible for global management of the terres-
trial RF spectrum in addition to satellite orbits. This organization currently has over 700 
sector members from 193 countries, which includes private-sector entities and academic 
institutions. It manages three different regions around the globe. Figure 3.4 shows the three 
administrative regions and the geographic area they encompass.

United States: Federal Communications Commission
The local regulatory authority that manages RF spectrum for the United States is the 
Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The FCC, founded in 1934, is (along with 
other local regulatory authorities) responsible for regulating both the licensed and unli-
censed radio frequency spectrum. 
Wireless cellular networks use licensed radio frequency, and IEEE 802.11 wireless net-
works may use unlicensed or licensed frequencies for communication between devices. A 
benefi t of using the unlicensed radio spectrum is that there is no cost to the end user. IEEE 
wireless networks commonly use two unlicensed RF bands allowed by the FCC:
 
■
The 2.4 GHz industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band
 
■
The 5 GHz Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure (U-NII) Band
I will further discuss this and other technical details of standards-based wireless com-
munications in Chapter 5, “IEEE 802.11 Terminology and Technology.”
The FCC also allows the use of the unlicensed 900 MHz ISM band, but it is 
not used with standards-based IEEE 802.11 wireless networking. The 902-
928 MHz ISM unlicensed band is not available worldwide and is only avail-
able in Region 2 (the Americas), with a few exceptions. Therefore, it was 
not specified for use with IEEE 802.11 wireless networking.
There are two licensed bands that can be used with IEEE 802.11 networking: 
 
■
3.650–3.700 GHz band
 
■
4.940–4.990 GHz public safety band
In 2008, the IEEE ratifi ed the IEEE 802.11y amendment to the standard. This amend-
ment allows for the use of high-powered wireless LAN equipment to operate in the 3.650–
3.700 GHz band. Within the United States, this is a licensed band that requires the user to 
pay some type of licensing fees.

Radio Frequency Characteristics 
81
The IEEE 802.11-2012 standard also specifi es the use of the 4.940–4.990 GHz public 
safety band for use within the United States, consisting of 5 MHz, 10 MHz, and 20 MHz 
wide channels with both high and lower power limits.
Cellular networks in the United States use various frequency ranges depending on the 
wireless carrier and the geographic location. The following frequencies are among those 
used for cellular voice communications:
 
■
800 MHz
 
■
850 MHz
 
■
1700 MHz
 
■
1900 MHz
 
■

I will discuss additional details of the radio frequency bands used for cellular communi-
cations in Chapter 7, “Cellular Communication Technology.”

States, visit www.fcc.gov.
Europe: European Telecommunications Standards 
Institute
The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) is responsible for produc-
ing standards for information and communications technologies, including fi xed, mobile, 
radio, converged, broadcast, and Internet technologies in Europe. ETSI was created by the 
European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT) in 1988.
In Europe, radio frequency use is managed by CEPT, which develops guidelines and 
provides national administrations with tools for coordinated European radio frequency 
spectrum management.
Radio Frequency Characteristics
To have a basic understanding of how radio frequency is used for data communications, it 
is important to become familiar with the RF characteristics that encompass the technology. 
In the following sections, you will learn about the four basic RF characteristics:
 
■
Wavelength

Chapter 3 ■ Radio Frequency and Antenna Technology Fundamentals
Wavelength
The wavelength is the distance of one complete cycle or one oscillation of an AC signal. 
Wavelength is typically identifi ed by the Greek symbol lambda λ, which is used in formu-
las for calculations. This distance is usually measured in centimeters or inches. Figure 3.5 
shows an example of the wavelength for an IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN operating in the 2.4 
GHz ISM band on channel 6.

IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs use both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz unlicensed frequency 
ranges for communication. The IEEE 802.11-2012 standard also specifi es some additional 
frequency ranges in which wireless LANs can operate. Although these do not fall under the 
“unlicensed” category, 4.9 GHz public safety and 3.650 GHz (IEEE 802.11y amendment) 
can also be used for IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN communications. Table 3.2 lists some 
examples of wavelengths for IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs using unlicensed frequencies.

Frequency
Frequency is defi ned as the number of complete cycles in 1 second. Low frequencies cor-
respond to long radio waves and high frequencies to short radio waves, so the higher the 
frequency, the shorter the wavelength (range). In formulas, frequency is identifi ed by the 
lowercase letter f.
Figure 3.6 shows an example of frequency.

How Far Can a Signal Travel?
A few years back, 900 MHz cordless telephones were very popular. Cordless telephones 
were introduced in the 1970s, and in 1990 the FCC opened the 900 MHz range for these 
telephones. With a 900 MHz phone, you could potentially be up to 500 feet away from its 
base station before losing the signal and no longer being able to make a phone call. In 
the past few years, higher-frequency phones have increased in popularity. After upgrad-
ing to a 2.4 GHz phone, you may have noticed that you can get only about 250 feet away 
(half the distance compared to a 900 MHz phone) in the same environment before losing 
the signal. This is because the 2.4 GHz wavelength is about half the distance of a 900 MHz 
wavelength, assuming both phones are operating at the same output power. With 
5.8 GHz cordless telephones, the range will be still less, assuming the same amount of 
RF transmit power.
IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs operate in several unlicensed frequency ranges. The unli-
censed ranges used for wireless LANs are 2.4 GHz to 2.5 GHz and 5.15 GHz to 5.875 
GHz. There are some areas in the 5.15 GHz to 5.875 GHz range that are not used for 
standards-based wireless networking. Cellular phones operate in several different licensed 
frequency ranges depending on the carrier. These ranges include but are not limited to 
800 MHz, 1.7 GHz, and 1.9 GHz for voice communications. 

84 
Chapter 3 ■ Radio Frequency and Antenna Technology Fundamentals
Amplitude
From a wireless communication perspective, the amplitude is the signal strength which 
is the amount of power of an RF signal. The amplitude is calculated from the height (in a 
two-dimensional view), measured on the y-axis of the sine wave. This represents the volt-
age level of the RF signal. A basic sine wave is a change in voltage over a period of time. 
Using a formula, the voltage at the peak of the signal can be used to calculate the amount 
of RF power. 
An increase in amplitude is equal to an increase in RF power. This increase in RF power 
is also known as gain. 
Conversely, any decrease in amplitude will be a decrease in power. A decrease in RF 
power is also known as loss. If a transmitter outputs a certain amount of RF power—for 
example, 50 mW—it has amplitude of some value. As this signal travels through an RF 
cable, it will have a specifi c level of loss based on the cable in use, resulting in attenuation. 
Therefore, the result will be less signal or smaller amplitude at the end of the cable due to 
the loss value of the cable. The same effect occurs when an RF signal travels through open 
air. The air will diffuse the RF and cause some level of attenuation. In over-the-air commu-
nication technology, the free space produces the largest amount of signal loss. 
Figure 3.7 shows two signals operating at the same frequency with different amplitudes. 
The signal with the higher amplitude (Signal A) is more powerful than the signal with the 
lower amplitude (Signal B).

Phase
Phase is the difference in degrees at a particular point in the time of a cycle, measured from 
some arbitrary zero and expressed as an angle. For example, based on an x-axis scale of 
from 0° to 360°, if a second sine wave starts a quarter of a wavelength after the fi rst sine 
wave, it is considered to be 90° out of phase with the fi rst sine wave. Figure 3.8 shows an 
example of the phase relationship between two AC signals. Two radio waves that have the 
same frequency but start at different times are known to have a phase difference and are 
considered out of phase with one another. The amount of the phase difference is measured 
in degrees, ranging anywhere from 0° to 360°.

Given that a single radio receiver is not capable of distinguishing the difference between 
radio waves that arrive at a receiver out of phase, the received signal will experience some 
level of distortion. The receiver will combine these out-of-phase (refl ected) signals, which 
will cause some corruption of the received signal. This is known as multipath. Refl ection 
and multipath are discussed later in this chapter. The difference in time of arrival of the 
main signal and an out-of-phase, refl ected signal that causes the multipath problem is called 
the delay spread. If two waves were to arrive at a receiver 180° out of phase, this will usu-
ally result in a cancellation effect, which nullifi es the two signals. Conversely, two waves 
that arrive in phase are additive, and this will result in an increase in signal strength, also 
known as upfade. Keep in mind, however, that the amplitude of the waves that experience 
the upfade effect will never be higher than the original wave that was transmitted.
Bandwidth
Depending on the context in which the term bandwidth is used, it may have several dif-
ferent meanings. With respect to radio frequency, bandwidth can be thought of as a range 
of frequencies used for a specifi c application. For example, the operating frequency of an 
IEEE 802.11 access point in the 5 GHz U-NII band using channel 36 is from 5,170 MHz 
to 5,190 MHz. This is a difference of 20 MHz. Therefore the bandwidth of channel 36 
is 20 MHz wide. Another example is the amount of information or computer data that 
can potentially be sent over a specifi c period of time, such as 1,000 Mbps (1 Gbps). This 
is equal to 1 billion bits per second, which is the bandwidth. The number in both exam-
ples is the total maximum capacity of the radio frequency channel or computer network 
infrastructure. 

86 
Chapter 3 ■ Radio Frequency and Antenna Technology Fundamentals
One simple way to analogize this concept is using a garden hose connected to a water 
faucet. If you have a ½  -inch-diameter 10-foot garden hose, it may take 10 minutes to fi ll up 
a bucket with water. If you switched to a 1-inch-diameter garden hose and everything else 
remained the same, it would take only 5 minutes to fi ll the bucket with water. Therefore, 
the wider diameter hose (1 inch) can pass twice as much water over the same period of 
time, just as a 40 MHz channel can move twice as much data as a 20 MHz wide channel 
over the same period of time. Figure 3.9 shows this concept of bandwidth.

Modulation
Wireless communications utilizes radio frequency to send and receive information. This is 
possible because all wireless devices have transmitter and/or receiver capability. Unlike a 
television or FM radio you may have in your home, both of which are only receivers, other 
wireless communication devices such as a cellular phone or Wi-Fi–capable computer have 
the ability to act as either a transmitter or a receiver (also known as a transceiver). 
For a transmitter and a receiver to communicate, the information that is sent over the air 
using radio frequency must be modulated. Depending on the type of communication taking 
place, modulation is varying one or more of the RF characteristics, such as wavelength, fre-
quency, amplitude, or phase. For example, the modulation process will add digital data to 
the AC signal and prepare it to be sent over the air using radio frequency. This modulation 
concept is analogous to speaking a specifi c language. For two people to communicate, they 
must both be able to speak and understand the same language. 
Now we will explore how modulation works as it relates to wireless computer networking 
and using radio transmitters and receivers (transceivers) to send and receive computer data: 
Radio Transmitter  With wireless communications, a radio transmitter combines binary 
digital computer data (all of the 1s and 0s) with high-frequency alternating current (AC)

signals to prepare it to be sent across the air. The connected antenna then transforms this 
signal into radio waves and propagates them through the air. The frequency of the signal 
depends on the technology in use. With IEEE 802.11 standards–based wireless networking, 
there are a few select frequency ranges. This signal that is sent over the air now contains 
the computer data, and the characteristics of the RF signal will vary based on the modula-
tion type used.
Radio Receiver  A radio receiver collects the propagated signal from the air using an 
antenna and reverses the process by transforming the received signal back into an alternat-
ing current signal. Through the use of a demodulation process, the digital data is recovered 
from the received signal. The modulation/demodulation technology used depends on the 
wireless communication technology in use. For example, an IEEE 802.11g wireless LAN 
will use 64 QAM (quadrature amplitude modulation) when transmitting data at 54 Mbps. 
Figure 3.10 illustrates this entire process. In this fi gure, the access point is the receiver and 
the client device is the transmitter.

Specifi c modulation types will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 5. 
Radio Frequency Range and Speed
How far and fast a radio frequency signal can travel depends on a variety of factors, includ-
ing interference and the types of materials in the environment. In this part of the chapter 
you will learn about these concepts. 
The range for wireless communications is based on the wavelength or distance of a 
single cycle. The frequency of an RF signal is based on how many cycles occur during a 
specifi c time frame. The higher the frequency, the shorter the range of the signal. The lower 
the frequency, the longer the range of the signal. A 2.4 GHz signal will travel almost twice 
as far as a 5 GHz signal at the same RF output power level. For example, with an IEEE 

88 
Chapter 3 ■ Radio Frequency and Antenna Technology Fundamentals
802.11 wireless network, if the network design calls for dual-band access points, range 
will need to be considered to ensure proper coverage for both the 2.4 GHz ISM and 5 GHz 
U-NII bands.
The speed of the communication link is based on the quality of the received signal 
strength at the receiver. Therefore, a receiver that is operating in the 2.4 GHz band and is 
in very close proximity to the transmitter will be receiving a stronger, better-quality signal. 
With regard to wireless networking, this means the receiver can use a more sophisticated 
modulation technology, which will result in a higher data rate. So the range of the signal 
may have an impact on the speed of the data transfer due to the quality of the signal at dif-
ferent distances.
A wireless LAN site survey will help determine the usable range an access point will pro-
duce. A wireless site survey can involve physically walking around the proposed space to 
determine infrastructure device placement and/or a predictive modeling process using one 
of many software programs. This process is discussed further in Chapter 8, “Site Survey, 
Capacity Planning, and Wireless Design.”
There are a lot of factors that can affect RF speed and range. The fi rst thing to under-
stand is the concept of attenuation, which is a decrease in signal intensity. There are a host 
of environmental factors that can affect the behavior of RF signals, causing attenuation and 
other problems. Another consideration is radio frequency interference from other signals. In 
the following sections, we’ll explore all of these factors.
Attenuation
With respect to RF, attenuation is a decrease in the intensity of a signal or a decrease in 
amplitude. Radio frequency attenuation can be either intentional or unintentional. 
Intentional attenuation would be the result of inserting a device called an attenuator 
within an RF circuit. An attenuator is a passive device that does not require an external 
power source and is installed in series in the RF circuit. The signal will decrease based 
on the rating of the attenuator. For example, an attenuator rated at 3 dB would decrease 
the signal by 50%. (Relative RF power expressions such as dB are discussed later in the 
chapter.) The reason for this type of device would be to purposely cause a decrease in sig-
nal strength or amplitude of the signal without distorting or corrupting the RF signal. An 
attenuator is the opposite of an amplifi er, which will cause an increase in amplitude or sig-
nal strength. An amplifi er is an active device that does require an external power source. 
Unintentional attenuation can be caused by a variety of items, including environmental 
conditions. RF signal attenuation can be caused by the following:
 
■

■
Wood
 
■
Sheet rock or drywall walls

Radio Frequency Range and Speed

■
Plaster walls
 
■
Glass
 
■

■

■
Items that contain a liquid content
This is a short list of some of the items that will cause an RF signal to be attenuated. It 
is important to take these and other factors into consideration when designing a wireless 
system and while troubleshooting or supporting a wireless system.
Environmental Factors, Including Building Materials
The interaction between RF and the surrounding environment can seriously affect the 
performance of IEEE 802.11 wireless networks. RF behavior is affected by environmental 
conditions that exist:
 
■
Reflection
 
■
Refraction
 
■
Diffraction
 
■
Scattering
 
■
Absorption
 
■
Diffusion
Keep in mind that the environment in which wireless devices are communicating will 
have an effect on how successful the communications will be. All of the environmental 
conditions will have an effect on RF propagation, and one or more of these behaviors will 
be present every place wireless is used. Now let’s take a closer look at each of these behav-
iors, and then we’ll examine the Faraday cage, the use of which can result in some of these 
behaviors.
Reflection
Refl ection occurs when an RF signal bounces off a smooth, nonabsorbing surface, resulting 
in a change of direction of the RF.  A table top is an example of a surface that will produce 
this type of behavior. Metal storage racking in a warehouse is another example. Refl ections 
can affect indoor wireless installations fairly signifi cantly in certain cases. Depending on 
the interior of a building—such as the type of walls, fl oors, and furnishings—there could 
be a large number of refl ected signals. If not properly handled, refl ections could cause poor 
network performance and a decrease in throughput or other communication indicators. 
Figure 3.11 illustrates refl ection.

Smooth surface such as table top
Think of a Ping-Pong game when it comes to reflection. When a Ping-Pong 
ball is served or hit, it comes in contact with the table—a smooth, hard 
surface—and bounces off in a different direction. This is similar to how 
reflection works with radio frequency. Once the ball hits the table, it will 
slow down in speed because of the impact with the table. The same con-
cept is true with radio frequency. An RF signal that experiences reflection 
will change directions, resulting in attenuation of the original signal.
Refraction
When an RF signal passes between mediums of different densities, it may change speeds 
and change direction. This behavior of RF is called refraction. Glass is an example of a 
material that may cause refraction. When an RF signal comes in contact with an obstacle 
such as glass, the signal is refracted by changing direction as it passes through and is atten-
uated. The amount of attenuation depends on the type of glass, its thickness, and other 
properties. Figure 3.12 shows an example of RF refraction.

Diffraction
When an RF signal comes in contact with an obstacle, the wave may change direction by 
bending around the obstacle. This RF behavior is called diffraction. A building or other tall 
structure could cause diffraction, as could a building support column in a large open area 
or conference hall. Figure 3.13 shows an example of diffraction. When the signal bends 
around a column, building, or other obstacle, the signal weakens, resulting in some level 
of attenuation.

Building rooftop
You can demonstrate diffraction by using a pond of still water. Place a 
large object such as a two-by-four piece of lumber in the pond. After the 
water settles, try to drop a pebble or small rock off to the side of the piece 
of lumber. Watch closely and you will see the ripple of the water bend 
around the lumber, resulting in a diffraction effect.
Scattering
When an RF signal strikes an uneven surface, wavefronts of the signal will refl ect off the 
uneven surface in several directions. This is known as scattering. Scattering, illustrated in 
Figure 3.14, is another RF behavior that may severely degrade a signal, therefore causing 
attenuation of this signal. Scattering, if signifi cant enough, can render the received signal 
unusable. 
Absorption
When materials absorb an RF signal, little if any of the signal will penetrate through 
the material. This may cause severe attenuation of the original RF signal. Many differ-
ent types of building materials can cause absorption in addition to other items within an 

92

environment. Absorption can be caused by objects that contain a high content of liquid. 
This includes areas where products that contain liquid such as water and paint are stored. 
Another cause of absorption is the human body. The human body contains a high liquid 
content and will absorb some RF signals. This type of absorption can be a problem for 
wireless network deployments in certain environments. For densely populated areas such as 
stadiums, airports, and conference halls, absorption needs to be considered when designing 
for a wireless system. Figure 3.15 shows an example of absorption.

Diffusion and Free Space Path Loss
RF diffusion occurs when a transmitted RF signal naturally widens as it leaves an antenna 
element. Figure 3.16 shows this widening effect. As a result, the transmitted radio fre-
quency signal will decrease in amplitude and be less powerful at any distance from the 
antenna. This is known as free space path loss (FSPL). FSPL is the greatest form of attenua-
tion in a radio frequency link, resulting in a decrease of the signal strength. The antenna on 
the receiver side is able to acquire a much smaller amount of the transmitted signal because 
of this widening effect of the diffused signal as it propagates through the air. Any signal 
that is not received by the intended receiving device is considered RF loss.

f = frequency in MHz and d = distance in km
Faraday Cage
Michael Faraday was an English scientist who invented the Faraday cage in 1836. The 
Faraday cage, also called a Faraday shield, is an enclosure of some sort that will block 
external static and nonstatic electric fi elds. This enclosure is made from or coated with a 
conductive material and usually consists of a metal mesh material. The shape is not impor-
tant and is based on the use of the cage. 
Although a Faraday cage can be created for electrical testing purposes, other structures 
or enclosures can have the same effect. The design of an enclosure could have Faraday 
cage–like properties to shield it from or to retain the electromagnetic radiation. Anything 
that may have the capability to either keep signals from entering or keep them from leaving 
the enclosure will have Faraday cage characteristics. This may include but is not limited to 
the following:
 
■
Building materials
 
■
Microwave ovens
 
■
Elevators
 
■
Wire mesh or screens
 
■
Coaxial cable
 
■
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) areas
 
■
Tempest building or room

Chapter 3 ■ Radio Frequency and Antenna Technology Fundamentals
When you think about it, the possibilities are endless as to what type of enclosures can 
act as Faraday cages for both intentional and unintentional purposes.
Interference from Wi-Fi and Non-Wi-Fi Sources
Interference from a radio frequency point of view occurs when a radio receiver hears unin-
tended signals on the same frequency as the one it is tuned to or a frequency that’s close. This 
type of interference, also known as electromagnetic interference (EMI), causes a received 
RF signal to be distorted and can result in a partial or complete disturbance of the intended 
signal. In wireless communications systems such as a wireless computer network, the inter-
ference may have a severe impact on the quality of signal received by a wireless device. The 
distorted or corrupted signal will decrease the effi ciency of the communication or the amount 
of data a device can effectively receive, thereby causing poor performance. This poor perfor-
mance will result in dropped phone calls, less throughput, and similar problems.
A wireless LAN radio receiver has characteristics similar to those of the human ear. 
Both can hear a range of frequencies. For example, if one person is speaking to a group at a 
conference and a number of people are listening to this speaker, this is analogous to a single 
transmitter and multiple receivers. If a second person started to speak in the area at the 
same time, people listening might not be able to understand either speaker. In a sense, they 
are experiencing interference.
An IEEE 802.11 wireless network may use the unlicensed 2.4 GHz ISM band. The fol-
lowing list is a small sample of what can cause RF interference to wireless communication 
systems that use unlicensed frequency bands:
 
■
Cordless phones
 
■
Microwave ovens
 
■
Medical devices
 
■
Industrial devices
 
■
Baby monitors
 
■
Wireless cameras
 
■
Two-way radios
 
■
Other IEEE 802.11 wireless networks
Because these devices also use radio frequency to operate, and the frequency is in the 
same unlicensed band as IEEE 802.11 wireless networks, they have the potential to inter-
fere with one another. Although they may coexist in the same RF space, the interference 
factor needs to be taken into consideration. This can be done as part of the site survey pro-
cess. RF interference with regards to wireless networking site survey and design concepts 
will be discussed further in Chapter 8. 

Measurement Units of Radio Frequency

Measurement Units of Radio Frequency
If a person were given a dollar bill, they would be 1 dollar richer. If this person were given 
100 cents, they would still be 1 dollar richer. From this example, you can see that 1 dollar 
= 100 cents and 1 cent = 1/100th of a dollar. One dollar and 100 cents are the same net 
amount, but a cent and a dollar are different units of currency.
The same is true for radio frequency measures of power. The basic unit of measure for 
radio frequency power is the watt. For example, a wireless LAN access point may be set to 
an RF output power of 30 mW (milliwatts). A milliwatt is 1/1000 of a watt. Just as cents 
and dollars are both denominations of currency, watts and milliwatts are measurements of 
RF power. Other units of measurement for RF power are decibel milliwatt (dBm), decibel 
(dB), decibel isotropic (dBi), and decibel dipole (dBd).
Absolute Measurements of Radio Frequency Power
The amount of RF power leaving a wireless access point is one example of an absolute 
measure of power. This is an actual power measurement and not a ratio or relative value. 
In other words, this is a measurable amount of power, and it can be determined with the 
proper calibrated measurement device, such as a watt meter. A typical maximum amount 
of transmit output power from an enterprise-grade access point in the 2.4 GHz ISM band 
is 100 mW. 
The measure of AC power can be calculated using a basic formula. The formula is as 
follows:
P = E × I
That is, power (P) equals voltage (E) multiplied by current (I).
A simple example would be to calculate the power from 1 volt and 1 amp. Using the 
given variables, here’s the formula:
P = 1 volt × 1 amp
The answer would be power = 1 watt.
Watt (W)
The watt (W) is a basic unit of power measurement. It is a measurable, absolute value. 
Most wireless computer networks and mobile wireless devices function in the milliwatt 
range; however, some cellular phones may approach 1 W or more. An RF power level in 
watts is a common measurement in long distance point-to-point and point-to-multipoint 
connections.

96 
Chapter 3 ■ Radio Frequency and Antenna Technology Fundamentals
Milliwatt (mW)
One milliwatt (mW) is 1/1000 of a watt. This is a common value used in RF work with 
cellular networks and IEEE 802.11 wireless networks. The output power of an enterprise-
grade wireless access point typically ranges from 1 mW to 100 mW. Most of these access 
points will allow you to change the RF output power. Most small offi ce, home offi ce 
(SOHO) access points have a fi xed output power, typically 30 mW. The milliwatt is another 
example of an absolute unit of power measurement.
Decibel Relative to a Milliwatt (dBm)
dBm is the power level of a decibel compared to 1 milliwatt. This is based on a logarithmic 
function. A good rule of thumb to remember is that 0 dBm = 1 mW. This value is consid-
ered as absolute zero because it is a logarithmic expression. Using a formula or basic RF 
calculation rules, you can easily convert any milliwatt value to decibels: 100 mW = 20 dBm, 
for example.
The dBm is also an absolute unit of power measurement. A decibel (dB) is an example of 
a change in power or relative measurement of power, where dBm is measured power refer-
enced to 1 milliwatt, or an absolute measure of power. The next section discusses relative 
measurements of power. 
Absolute values are measurable values of power such as watt, milliwatt, 
and decibel milliwatt.
Relative Measurements of Radio Frequency Power
Changes in radio frequency power are known as relative values. Decibel (dB) and decibel 
isotropic (dBi) are relative measurements of RF power. For example, if the input RF power 
to an amplifi er is 10 mW and the output RF power is 100 mW, the gain of the amplifi er is 
10 dB—a change in power. This is because the RF power was increased from 10 mW to 
100 mW, or a times 10 increase.
If the input power to an antenna is 100 mW and the output power is 200 mW, the gain 
of the antenna is 3 dBi—a change in power. This is because the power was increased 
from 100 mW to 200 mW, which is two times the power. Both 10 mW to 100 mW and 
100 mW to 200 mW are examples of changes in power and are known as relative expres-
sions of RF power.

The fi gure shows that the wireless access point has an RF output power of 50 mW. This 
is an absolute expression because it is a measurable value at that point. The cable intro-
duces a loss of –3dB, resulting in 25 mW of power at the antenna element. Because the 
cable resulted in half of the original power at the antenna element, and there was a change 
from 50 mW to 25 mW and is therefore a relative RF power expression. 
Decibel (dB)
The decibel (dB) is a ratio of two different power levels caused by either a positive change 
in power (gain) or a negative change in power (loss). Figure 3.18 shows how an amplifi er 
will provide an increase or change in power.

Basic RF Math: The 3s and 10s Rule
There is a simple way to perform any RF math calculation without having to use loga-
rithms and mathematical formulas. This method is known as the 3s and 10s rule (or 
sometimes referred to as the 10s and 3s rule). If you remember ﬁ ve basic steps, you can 
perform any RF math calculation. The ﬁ ve basic steps are as follows:
 
■
0 dBm = 1 mW (starting point)
 
■
Increase by 3 dB and the absolute power in mW doubles (or × 2)
 
■
Decrease by 3 dB and the absolute power in mW is cut in half (or ÷ 2)
 
■
Increase by 10 dB and the absolute power in mW is multiplied by (10 or × 10)
 
■
Decrease by 10 dB and the absolute power in mW is divided by (10 or ÷ 10) 
Decibel Isotropic (dBi)
Decibel isotropic (dBi) is the unit of RF power measurement that represents the gain or 
increase in signal strength of an antenna. The term isotropic in the RF world means energy 
broadcast equally in all directions in a spherical manner. An imaginary, perfect antenna 
would be considered an isotropic radiator. This is a theoretical concept and is used as a ref-
erence and in calculations. dBi is discussed in more detail later in this chapter. 
Remember, relative measurements in RF power are changes in RF power 
from one value to another value. An example is 100 mW to 50 mw. dB, dBi, 
and dBd are relative RF power measurements.
Decibel Dipole (dBd)
The gain of some antennas may be measured in decibel dipole (dBd). This unit of measure-
ment refers to the antenna gain with respect to a reference dipole antenna. The gain of 
most antennas used in wireless LANs is measured in decibel isotropic (dBi); however, some 
manufacturers may reference the gain of an antenna in dBd. The following simple formula 
derives the dBi value from the dBd value:
dBi = dBd + 2.14
This formula converts from dBi to dBd:
dBd = dBi − 2.14

Radio Frequency Antenna Concepts 
99
dBd vs. dBi
You are a procurement agent working for a manufacturing company. An engineer orders 
some antennas to be used in a wireless LAN deployment. The part number you received 
from the engineer on the bill of materials is for antennas that are currently out of stock at 
your normal supplier. The order has to be placed as soon as possible, but technical sup-
port for the vendor is gone for the day and you are not able to get any assistance.
You found what appears to be a reasonable alternative for the requested antennas. How-
ever, the gain of the antennas does not exactly match what the engineer documented on 
the bill of materials. The engineer requested omnidirectional antennas with a gain of 6 
dBi. You found what appears to be a comparable alternate with a gain of 6 dBd. It will be 
necessary for you to determine whether these antennas will work. Not quite understand-
ing the difference, you do some research to determine the difference between dBd and 
dBi. After searching various websites, you ﬁ nd a formula to convert the two different 
units:
dBi = dBd + 2.14
Using your calculator, you enter the value from the speciﬁ cation sheet for the alternate 
antennas:
6 dBd + 2.14 = 8.14 dBi
Unfortunately, the antennas found will not be a good alternative in this example. Back to 
the drawing board!
Radio Frequency Antenna Concepts
It is important to understand some of the basic theory, characteristics, and terminology 
associated with antennas prior to learning how they operate. Becoming familiar with this 
will help in making decisions when it comes to purchases and support of antennas and 
wireless LAN systems. This list includes some of the terms for characteristics of antennas 
explored in the following sections:
 
■
Radio frequency lobes: Shape of the radiation patterns
 
■
Beamwidth: Horizontal and vertical angles

Chapter 3 ■ Radio Frequency and Antenna Technology Fundamentals
 
■

■
Polarization: Horizontal or vertical orientation
Radio Frequency Lobes
The term lobe has many meanings, depending on the context in which it is used. Typically 
it is used to defi ne the projecting part of an object. In anatomical terms, an example would 
be part of the human ear known as the earlobe. In botanical terms, a lobe is the divided 
part of a leaf. As a radio frequency technology term, lobe refers to the shape of the RF 
energy emitted from an antenna element. 
RF lobes are determined by the physical design of the antenna. The antenna design also 
determines how the lobes project from an antenna element. The effect of antenna design, 
particularly on the shape of the RF lobes, is one reason choosing the correct antenna is a 
signifi cant part of a wireless design. 
Antennas may project many lobes of RF signal, some of which are not intended to be 
usable areas of coverage but nevertheless can be in some cases. The RF lobes that are not 
part of the main lobe coverage—that is, the back or rear and side lobes—contain usable RF 
but in most cases are not intended to be used to provide coverage for the wireless cell. They 
are for the most part unintentional coverage areas and, depending on the environment, may 
not be part of a good wireless design or planned coverage area. 
The type of antenna utilized—omnidirectional, semidirectional, or highly directional—
will determine the usable lobes. These antennas, as well as the RF radiation patterns they 
project, will be discussed in more detail later in this chapter. 
Figure 3.19 shows an example of RF lobes emitted from an antenna element. The “main 
signal” is the lobe intended to be used.

Antenna Beamwidth
The design of an antenna will determine how and in which specifi c patterns the RF energy 
propagates. The patterns of energy emitted from an antenna are known as lobes. For anten-
nas, the beamwidth is the angle of measurement of the main RF lobe measured at what is 
called the half-power point, or the −3 dB point. Beamwidth is measured both horizontally 
and vertically, in degrees. It is important to understand that antennas shape the RF cover-
age or isotropic energy that radiates from the antenna element. Changing types or remain-
ing with the same type of antenna but changing the gain will also change the coverage area 
provided by the wireless system.
Documents for antenna specifi cations are available to illustrate the horizontal and verti-
cal beamwidths. Azimuth and elevation charts available from the antenna manufacturer 
will show the beamwidth angles.
The azimuth refers to the horizontal RF coverage pattern, and the elevation is the verti-
cal RF coverage pattern. The azimuth is the view from above, or the “bird’s-eye view” of 
the RF pattern; in some cases it will be 360°. 
Think of the elevation as a side view. If you were to look at a mountain from the side 
view, it would have a certain height, or elevation, measured in feet or meters. For example, 
Pikes Peak, a mountain in the front range of the Rocky Mountains, has an elevation of 
14,115 feet (4,302 meters). If you were to look at Pikes Peak from ground level (a side 
view), you would be able to visualize this impressive elevation. 
Figure 3.20 shows a representation of horizontal and vertical beamwidths for a para-
bolic dish antenna. 
Some wireless predictive modeling site survey software programs will allow the wireless 
designer to adjust the azimuth and elevation of the antennas used in the predictive modeling 
design to more closely depict the real-world coverage of the wireless system. Wireless site 
surveys will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 8, “Site Survey, Capacity Planning, and 
Wireless Design.”

Reading Azimuth and Elevation Charts
Understanding how to read an azimuth and elevation chart is useful from a technical 
sales, design, and integration perspective. Knowing these patterns will help when mak-
ing hardware recommendations for customers based on needed coverage and device 
use. Azimuth and elevation charts show the angles of radio frequency propagation 
from both the azimuth (horizontal or looking down, top view) and the elevation (vertical, 
side view). They give a general idea of the shape of the RF propagation lobe based on 
antenna design.
Antenna manufacturers test antenna designs in a laboratory. Using the correct instru-
ments, an engineer is able to create the azimuth and elevation charts. The charts show 
only the approximate coverage area based on the readings taken during laboratory test-
ing and do not take into consideration any environmental conditions such as obstacles or 
interference. The following image shows an example of an azimuth and elevation chart 
for a semidirectional antenna.

Understanding how to read one of these charts is not complicated. Notice that each 
chart is a circular pattern with readings from 0° to 360° and there are many rings within 
it. The outermost ring shows the strongest signal from the testing process of this 
antenna. The inner rings show measurements and dB ratings less than the strongest 
measured signal from the outside ring. A good chart will show the most accurate read-
ings from the testing process. 
A sales or technical support professional can use these charts to get an idea of how the 
radiation pattern would look based on a speciﬁ c antenna type and model and to deter-
mine both the horizontal and vertical beamwidths.

Radio Frequency Antenna Concepts 
103
Antenna Gain
The gain of an antenna provides a change in coverage that is a result of the antenna focus-
ing the area of radio frequency propagation. The gain is produced from the physical design 
of the antenna element. 
One of the characteristics of radio frequency is amplitude, which is defi ned as the height 
(voltage level) and is the amount of power of an RF wave. The amplitude is created by vary-
ing voltage over a period of time and is measured at the peaks of the signal from top to 
bottom. Amplifi cation of an RF signal will result in gain. An antenna is a device that can 
change the RF coverage area, thus propagating an RF signal further. 
Antenna gain is measured in decibels isotropic (dBi), which is a change in power as 
a result of reshaping the isotropic energy. Isotropic energy is defi ned as energy emitted 
equally in all directions. The sun is a good example of isotropic energy, emitting energy in a 
spherical manner equally in all directions. Figure 3.21 illustrates energy being emitted from 
an isotropic radiator.
F I G U R E  3 . 21   A perfect isotropic radiator emits energy equally in all directions.
Passive Gain
It’s quite intriguing how an antenna can provide passive gain, a change in coverage with-
out the use of an external power source. Because of how antennas are designed, they focus 
isotropic energy into a specifi c radiation pattern. Focusing this energy increases coverage 
in a particular direction. A common example used to describe passive gain is a magnify-
ing glass. If a person is standing outside on a beautiful sunny day, the sun’s energy is not 
intense because it is being diffused across the entire earth’s hemisphere. Thus, there is 
not enough concentrated energy to cause any harm or damage in a short period of time. 
However, if this person were to take a magnifying glass and point one side of it toward the 
sun and the other side toward a piece of paper, more than likely the paper would start to 
heat quickly. This is because the convex shape of the magnifying glass focuses, or concen-
trates, the sun’s energy into a specifi c area, thus increasing the amount of heat to that area.
Antennas are designed to function in the same way by focusing the energy they receive 
from a signal source into a specifi c RF radiation pattern. Depending on the design of the 

104 
Chapter 3 ■ Radio Frequency and Antenna Technology Fundamentals
antenna element, as the gain of an antenna increases, both the horizontal and vertical radi-
ation patterns (beamwidths) will decrease, or create narrower beamwidths. Conversely, as 
the gain of an antenna decreases, the beamwidths will increase, making a larger radiation 
pattern. 
One exception to this behavior is the omnidirectional antenna. This type of antenna has 
a horizontal beamwidth of 360°. When the gain is increased or decreased, the beamwidth 
will remain 360° but the size of this coverage area will increase or decrease depending on 
the change in the gain. Omnidirectional antennas are discussed in more detail later in this 
chapter. 
Figure 3.22 shows a drawing of a wireless network with 100 mW of RF power at the 
antenna. Because of passive gain, the antenna has the effect of emitting 200 mW of RF 
power.

It is important to understand that many local radio frequency regulatory 
domains or agencies restrict the amount of RF power that can be emitted 
from an unlicensed RF system. This “system” includes all the components 
certified by the local regulatory agency and may include the transmitter 
(access point), the connectors, and the antenna. Changing and increas-
ing the gain of an antenna will increase the amount of effective RF energy 
leaving the antenna and may violate the regulations set forth by the local 
regulatory agency and void the certification. The Federal Communications 
Commission (FCC) has modified what it allows several times, to the point 
of much confusion for installers trying to remain compliant with the regu-
lations. Additionally, altering the original design in any way may require 
that the entire system be recertified based on the laws in each RF agency 
and that agency’s interpretation of the term licensed system.
Exercise 3.1 is a simple way to demonstrate the concept of passive gain.

Radio Frequency Antenna Concepts 
105
E X E R C I S E  3 .1
Demonstrating Passive Gain
You can demonstrate passive gain by using a standard 8.5" × 11.0" piece of notebook 
paper or cardstock.
1. 
Roll a piece of paper into a cone or funnel shape.
2. 
Speak at your normal volume and notice the sound of your voice as it propagates 
through the air.
3. 
Hold the cone-shaped paper in front of your mouth.
4. 
Speak at the same volume.
5. 
Notice that the sound of your voice is louder. This occurs because the sound is now 
focused into a speciﬁ c area or radiation pattern and passive gain occurs.
Active Gain
Active gain will also provide an increase in signal strength. In an RF circuit, active gain is 
accomplished by providing an external power source to an installed device. An example 
of such a device is an amplifi er. An amplifi er is placed in series in the wireless system and 
increases the signal strength based on how much gain it provides.
To elaborate, if an amplifi er is used in a wireless system, certain regulatory domains 
require that the amplifi er be certifi ed as part of the system. It is best to carefully consider 
whether an amplifi er is necessary before using such a device in an IEEE 802.11 wireless 
LAN system. Using an amplifi er may nullify the system’s certifi cation and potentially cause 
the system to exceed the allowed RF limit for the frequency band in use.
Antenna Polarization
Antenna polarization describes how a radio wave is emitted from an antenna and the ori-
entation of the electrical component or electric fi eld of the waveform. The electromagnetic 
fi eld that propagates away from an antenna consists of two fi elds:
 
■
E-plane, which is the electrical field
 
■
H-plane, which is the magnetic field
These two fi elds leave the antenna element at a 90° angle and represent the polariza-
tion of an antenna. Together they create the energy that allows for wireless devices to 
communicate. 

106 
Chapter 3 ■ Radio Frequency and Antenna Technology Fundamentals
To maximize radio frequency signals, the transmitting and receiving antennas should 
be polarized in the same direction or as closely as possible. Antennas polarized in the same 
way ensure the best possible RF signal. If the polarization of the transmitter and receiver 
are different, the power of the RF signal will decrease depending how different the polar-
ization is. 
Figure 3.23 shows an example of horizontally and vertically polarized antennas.

With the large number of wireless devices available, it is a challenging task to accom-
plish the same polarization for all devices within a wireless system. When you’re working 
with wireless computer networks, performing a wireless LAN site survey will show signal 
strength based on several factors, including polarization of access point antennas. This sur-
vey will help determine the received signal strength of the wireless LAN devices. 
Exercise 3.2 shows how you can observe antenna polarization activity.

Antenna Polarization Example
It is fairly simple to demonstrate antenna polarization with a notebook computer or other 
wireless LAN device and either a wireless network adapter client utility or other third-
party software that shows signal strength and/or signal-to-noise ratio. One such utility 
is InSSIDer, a network scanner for various operating systems from MetaGeek. You can 
download the InSSIDer program from www.metageek.net. You can visualize polarization 
by performing the following steps. This experiment should be performed using a note-
book computer within close proximity to an access point.
1. 
Verify that you have a supported wireless network adapter.
2. 
Install and launch the InSSIDer program or other utility that shows signal strength.

tation of the computer changes with respect to the access point.
This demonstrates how polarity can affect the received signal of a device.
Antenna Types
The type of antenna that is best for a particular installation or application will depend on 
the desired radio frequency coverage pattern. Making the correct choice is part of a good 
wireless design. Using the wrong type of antenna can cause undesirable results, such as 
interference to neighboring systems, poor signal strength, or incorrect coverage pattern for 
your design.
There are three common types of antennas for use with wireless systems:
 
■
Omnidirectional/dipole antennas
 
■
Semidirectional antennas
 
■
Highly directional antennas
The following sections describe each type of antenna in more detail and provide specifi -
cations and installation or confi guration information about them.
Omnidirectional Antennas
Omnidirectional antennas are used in a variety of wireless system applications and are the 
most common type used with wireless LAN access points of either SOHO or enterprise 
grade. 
An omnidirectional antenna has a horizontal beamwidth (azimuth) of 360°. This 
means that when the antenna is vertically polarized (perpendicular to the earth’s surface), 
the horizontal radiation pattern is 360° and will propagate RF energy in every direction 
horizontally. 
The vertical beamwidth (elevation) will vary depending on the antenna’s gain. As the 
gain of the antenna increases, the horizontal radiation pattern will increase, providing 
more horizontal coverage. Keep in mind that the beamwidth is still 360°, but it will be a 
larger 360° area that is covered because of the higher gain of the antenna. However, the 
vertical radiation pattern will decrease, thus providing less vertical coverage.
The shape of the radiation pattern from an omnidirectional antenna is known as a torus. 
Figure 3.24 shows an example of the toroidal radiation pattern of an omnidirectional 
antenna.

Chapter 3 ■ Radio Frequency and Antenna Technology Fundamentals
F I G U R E  3 . 2 4   The omnidirectional radiation pattern has a toroidal shape.
Omnidirectional antennas are one of the most common types of antenna for indoor 
wireless deployments of any type. Most wireless LAN access points use omnidirectional 
antennas to provide the needed RF coverage. Indoor cellular devices may also use omnidi-
rectional antennas for coverage. Wireless LAN access points come with fi xed, removable, 
or integrated antennas. If the antenna is removable, the installer can replace it with one of 
different gain. Enterprise-grade access points typically have removable antennas that are 
sold separately.
Some regulatory domains require the use of proprietary connectors with respect to 
antennas. These connectors limit wireless access points to the specifi c antennas tested with 
the system. Therefore, it is best to consult with the manufacturer of the access point or 
other wireless LAN transmitting device to determine which antennas may be used with the 
system.
The most common type of omnidirectional antenna used indoors with wireless LAN 
systems is known as the rubber duck antenna. This type of antenna typically has a low gain 
of 2 dBi to 3 dBi and connects directly to an access point. Rubber duck antennas usually 
have a pivot point so the polarization can be adjusted vertically or horizontally regardless 
of how the access point is mounted.
Some antennas for wireless LANs will operate in both the 2.4 GHz ISM band and the 
5 GHz U-NII band and can thus work with a multiband wireless device.
Figure 3.25 shows a rubber duck omnidirectional antenna.

Semidirectional Antennas
Semidirectional antennas take radio frequency power from the transmitting system and 
focus the energy into a more specifi c pattern than an omnidirectional antenna offers. 
Semidirectional antennas are available in various types, including patch, panel, sector, and 
yagi. These antennas are manufactured for either indoor or outdoor use and are designed 
to provide more specifi c coverage by focusing the horizontal radiation pattern to a value of 
less than 360°. A semidirectional antenna will allow the wireless system designer to pro-
vide RF coverage to a specifi c area within a deployment. The coverage area may consist of 
rooms or areas in which an omnidirectional antenna may not be the perfect solution. For 
indoor installations, such areas include rectangular rooms or offi ces, hallways, and long 
corridors. For outdoor deployments, they include point-to-point and point-to-multipoint 
installations.
Patch/Panel Antennas
In the wireless LAN world, the terms patch and panel are commonly used to describe the 
same type of antenna. The intended use will affect the choice of patch/panel antenna to 
be used in a specifi c application. Choosing the correct patch/panel antenna will require 
knowing the dimensions of the physical area to be covered as well as the amount of gain 

112 
Chapter 3 ■ Radio Frequency and Antenna Technology Fundamentals
required. A patch/panel antenna can have a horizontal beamwidth of as high as 180°, but 
usually the horizontal beamwidth is between 35° and 60°. The vertical beamwidth usually 
ranges between 30° and 80°. Figure 3.28 shows a 2.4 GHz 11 dBi dual polarization 
diversity/MIMO/802.11n fl at panel antenna. At least two antennas are used for MIMO 
diversity. The difference between this and simple diversity is that with MIMO diversity, 
each antenna is connected to a separate radio chain. Simple diversity uses a single radio 
with multiple antennas and a diversity switch technology. Sector antennas are a type of 
semidirectional antenna that can be confi gured in an array to provide omnidirectional cov-
erage. Sector antennas are covered in more detail later in this chapter.

Appropriate Use of a Semidirectional Antenna
A small business consultant is tasked with providing wireless LAN access to several 
ofﬁ ces in a multitenant building. The client wants to provide adequate coverage for the 
ofﬁ ces it leases but would like to minimize the number of access points. The client wishes 
to use access points and antennas that are aesthetically pleasing because these ofﬁ ces 
allow public access. The areas to be covered are rectangular, as shown here.

Antenna Types 
113
One solution would be to provide several access points using low-gain omnidirectional 
antennas. The following image illustrates how several access points could be used to 
provide coverage to this area.
However, the consultant believes that if low-gain rubber duck omnidirectional antennas 
are used, an access point with signiﬁ cant output power would be required to cover the 
length of the rooms. In addition, the client wants to minimize the number of access points 
and make the installation aesthetically pleasing.
An alternate solution is to use a patch antenna on both sides of the ofﬁ ce, thereby pro-
viding adequate coverage and minimizing the use of access points. The following image 
shows patch antennas mounted at both ends of the ofﬁ ce area as well as the projected 
coverage area of both antennas.

The specifi cations for semidirectional antennas such as patch or panel vary based on the

application. Table 3.4 is an example of a specifi cation sheet for a 2.4 GHz 11 dBi dual-

and hail.

Sector Antennas
Sector antennas can be used to create omnidirectional radiation patterns using semidi-
rectional antennas. These antennas are often used for base station connectivity for point-
to-multipoint connectivity. Sector antennas usually have an azimuth that varies from 90° 

116 
Chapter 3 ■ Radio Frequency and Antenna Technology Fundamentals
to 180°. They are typically confi gured to offer a total azimuth of 360° when installed in 
groups. For example, using sector antennas with an azimuth of 120° each would require 
three antennas in order to get omnidirectional or 360° coverage. This is a common con-
fi guration used with cellular phone technology. Figure 3.30 shows a dual-feed, dual-band 
sector panel antenna.

Sector antennas are commonly confi gured in an array to allow semidirectional antennas to 
provide omnidirectional coverage. This is useful in a campus environment or community 
arrangement to provide wireless access to a local network or the Internet. Sector antennas 
will usually have wide horizontal beamwidth (azimuth) and a narrow vertical beamwidth 
(elevation). Table 3.5 shows an example of a specifi cation sheet for a 2.4 GHz and 4.9 to

Yagi Antennas
Yagi antennas are designed to be used indoors in long hallways and corridors or outdoors 
for short-range bridging (typically less than two miles). Yagi antennas have vertical and 
horizontal beamwidths ranging from 25° to 65°. The radiation pattern may look like a fun-
nel or a cone. As the signal propagates away from the antenna, the RF coverage naturally

widens (diffusion). The aperture of the receiving antenna is much narrower than the signal 
at that point. This is a result of diffusion, which is the biggest form of loss in an RF link.

Highly Directional Antennas
Highly directional antennas are typically parabolic dish antennas used for long-range 
point-to-point bridge connections. These antennas are available with a solid refl ector or 
a grid. Some manufacturers of parabolic dish antennas used with wireless networking 
advertise ranges of 25 miles or more depending on the gain, RF power of the transmitter, 
and environmental conditions. Parabolic dish antennas have very narrow horizontal and 
vertical beamwidths. This beamwidth can range from 3° to 15° and has a radiation pattern 
similar to that of a yagi, with the appearance of a funnel. The beamwidth starts very nar-
row at the antenna element and naturally widens because of diffusion. 
Because these antennas are designed for outdoor use, they will need to be manufactured 
to withstand certain environmental conditions, including a wind rating and appropriate 
mounting. Grid antennas can provide similar coverage and are less susceptible to wind 
loading. Figure 3.34 shows a parabolic dish antenna.

Chapter 3 ■ Radio Frequency and Antenna Technology Fundamentals
One thing to consider regarding the sale and procurement of a highly 
directional parabolic dish antenna is the size and shipping weight. Since 
these antennas are much larger and heavier than other antennas used in 
wireless LANs, shipping cost may be a factor. Some specification sheets 
will detail shipping information for this reason.
Minimizing the Effects of Multipath 
Using Antenna Diversity
Refl ection is caused by an RF signal bouncing off a smooth, nonabsorbing surface and 
changing direction. Indoor environments are areas that are prone to refl ections. Refl ections 
are caused by the RF signal bouncing off walls, ceilings, fl oors, and furniture; thus some 
installations will suffer from refl ection more than others. 
The effect of refl ection will be a decrease in signal strength due to a phenomenon called 
multipath. Multipath is the result of several wavefronts of the same transmission signal 
received out of phase at slightly different times. This can cause the receiver to be confused 
about the received signals. The result is corrupted signal and less overall throughput. 
Figure 3.36 illustrates the effects of multipath.
F I G U R E  3 . 3 6   Effects of multipath

Distributed Antenna System (DAS) 
125
Think of multipath as an echo. If you were to stand near a canyon and 
speak to somebody at a high volume some distance away, the other per-
son would notice an echo. The echo is due to the fact that the sound of 
your voice is reflecting off the canyon walls. Therefore, the other person is 
hearing variations of your voice at slightly different times—as with RF mul-
tipath, several wavefronts of the same signal are arriving out of phase.
Antenna diversity is one way to help reduce the effects of multipath. Antenna diversity 
is a technology used in IEEE 802.11 a/b/g wireless LANs; a station (access point or client 
device) will utilize two antennas combined with one radio to decrease the effects of mul-
tipath. Using multiple antennas and some additional electronic intelligence, the receiver 
will be able to determine which antenna will receive and send the best signal. In diversity 
systems, two antennas are spaced at least one wavelength apart. This allows the receiver 
to use the antenna with the best signal to transmit and receive. With respect to radio fre-
quency diversity, the antennas are required to be of the same design, frequency, gain, and 
so on. Newer IEEE 802.11 technologies (802.11n and 802.11ac, for example) are capable of 
high throughput (HT) multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO), which uses radio chains to 
transmit and receive radio signals. IEEE 802.11a/b/g devices used a single radio to transmit 
and receive radio signals, which is known as single-input, single-output (SISO) technology. 
SISO systems are subject to multipath. This is a problem for IEEE 802.11a/b/g systems, 
whereas MIMO actually uses the refl ections to help enhance the performance and through-
put using several radio chains in newer wireless LAN technology. You can read more about 
MIMO in Chapter 4, “Standards and Certifi cations for Wireless Technology,” in the sec-
tion “The IEEE 802.11n Amendment.”
When you are using a diversity system such as an access point, it is impor-
tant to have both antennas oriented the same way. They cannot be used 
to cover different areas. Using diversity antennas in an attempt to provide 
coverage for different areas will defeat the purpose of the diversity design.
Distributed Antenna System (DAS)
Because of the close proximity of wireless devices indoors, a visual line of sight is usually 
not required for indoor wireless communications. Although attenuated, RF is capable of 
propagating through walls, doors, windows, and fl oors within a structure. 
However, in some cases RF signals such as cellular phone communications that are 
received from outside a building are already weak or barely above the desired receive signal 

126 
Chapter 3 ■ Radio Frequency and Antenna Technology Fundamentals
threshold. Bringing that signal in from the outside and allowing it to exist at an acceptable 
level in a building can be accomplished using technology known as a distributed antenna 
system (DAS). This antenna technology may use several antennas to create small cells to 
provide wireless coverage throughout an entire area or building. Figure 3.37 shows an 
example of a DAS installation.

As you can see in the fi gure, a single yagi antenna captures the RF signal from the 
outside of the building. This is known as the donor signal. The signal is then distributed 
throughout the building using several antennas by way of a bidirectional amplifi er, service 
provider/carrier head-end, and fi ber distribution hub. This is becoming a common applica-
tion for DAS in structures that have weak cellular signals within a building, especially in 

Distributed Antenna System (DAS)

diffi cult areas like basements and parking garages where low or no signal is received. There 
are two different types of DAS solutions:
Passive DAS  Just as antennas do not require any external power source to provide passive 
gain, a passive DAS deployment does not require an external power source to amplify the 
RF signal. The system consists only of coax cabling, RF connectors, RF splitters, and DAS-
capable antennas. The benefi t in this type of deployment is that it has less cost and is not 
as complex. However, passive solutions may not be as scalable and are intended for smaller 
installations. Passive DAS works well when the carrier signal is strong and needs assistance 
with propagation throughout the entire building.
Active DAS  This type of DAS deployment requires external power sources to operate. 
In addition to the coax cables, RF connectors and DAS-capable antenna amplifi cation 
are used to help improve the RF signal throughout the entire DAS installation. This type 
of DAS is scalable and intended to be used in larger installations. Active DAS works well 
in buildings that have a weak initial signal. Fiber optics with hubs are components of an 
active DAS. This allows for much longer distances and the ability to cover larger areas such 
as airports, sports venues, conference halls, tunnels, and university campuses.
The DAS installation does not need to be tied to one specifi c wireless carrier. Different 
carriers can share a DAS. The carriers will need to provide their head-end equipment and 
be able to bring in the signal from outside the building to provide the indoor service.
Leaky Coax DAS
Another type of DAS you may come across is something known as leaky coax, or leaky 
cable. Basically, there are cuts throughout the length of a special slotted coax cable. For 
the most part, this type of DAS has the same effect as an antenna with the RF propagating 
from the slots, allowing an RF signal to be sent and received. That is where the name leaky 
coax comes from. Since the signal is not amplifi ed, the coverage area is small and usually 
less than 25 feet from the cable. This is one solution in hard-to-reach areas like basements 
and tunnel-like long corridors, and it’s used with two-way radio (walkie-talkie) type com-
munications and some cellular applications.
DAS and IEEE 802.11 Wireless Networking
DAS is often used with wireless communication applications such as cellular phones, 
two-way radios, paging, and medical applications. 
There are mixed views about using DAS with IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN technology. 
Some equipment manufacturers do not certify, endorse or support any DAS vendors/
solutions, while others may offer specialty solutions that operate with DAS. 
One manufacturer of IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN equipment, Ruckus Wireless 
(www.ruckuswireless.com), is marketing an access point for Wi-Fi on coax distributed

antenna systems (DASs). This product is the ZoneFlex 7441. The 7441 is a bit of a unique 
product for Ruckus Wireless. According to its website, with this unit it is now possible to 
deploy Wi-Fi over an existing DAS network, enabling operators of DASs to create and mar-
ket Wi-Fi services for property management, building operations, guest access, and even 
wholesale Wi-Fi hotspot services across a building. 
Incorporating DAS with wireless computer networks (IEEE 802.11) has its share of 
challenges and may not be a good solution for many scenarios. Because DAS is basically 
a shared antenna system, it can create problems with wireless computer networks that 
include IEEE 802.11 devices that use newer MIMO technology. DAS itself requires a sys-
tem design, and you will need to have a special skill set or knowledge base in order execute 
a successful deployment. Before you incorporate IEEE 802.11 wireless networking within a 
DAS, I highly recommend performing the research to verify that it is the best solution based 
on the circumstances and will satisfy the requirements of the installation.
DAS Antennas
If you plan to use a DAS, you will need to use antennas designed to work with DAS tech-
nology. These antennas must be capable of operating at the correct frequency ranges for the 
wireless carriers used. Also, any specifi c physical attributes required for proper installation 
need to be considered.

Notice that this is a broadband/multiband DAS antenna that is designed to operate at 
different frequencies that will allow it to be used for different wireless technologies, elimi-
nating the need to purchase different antennas for each frequency. The standard N-type 
connector is compatible with a variety of implementations.

Radio Frequency Cables and Connectors 
131
Radio Frequency Cables and Connectors
Radio frequency cables play a role in various wireless systems. For example, cables may be 
used to connect wireless access points and client devices to antennas or to connect other 
devices that may used in wireless systems. Several factors need to be taken into consider-
ation when using cables in a wireless system:
 
■
Type of cable
 
■
Length of cable
 
■
Cost of cable
 
■
Impedance rating
Choosing the correct cable for use in wireless LAN systems is an important part of a 
successful wireless LAN deployment. The right cable for the right job will help ensure that 
signal loss—a decrease in signal strength—is minimized and performance is maximized.
Impedance and Voltage Standing Wave Ratio
Impedance is the measurement of alternating current (AC) resistance. It is normal to have 
some level of impedance mismatch in a wireless system, but the impedance of all compo-
nents should be matched as closely as possible in order to optimize performance of the 
system. Impedance mismatches can result in what is called voltage standing wave ratio 
(VSWR). A large impedance mismatch can cause a high level of VSWR and will have an 
impact on the wireless system and transmitted or received signal.
Electrical resistance is measured in ohms. IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN devices and 
cellular systems have an impedance of 50 ohms.
RF Cable Types
Many wireless systems use cables to extend from the wireless device such as an access 
point or a cell signal booster to an antenna located outside of a building. It is important 
to choose the correct type of cable in order to optimize the performance of the wireless 
system. 
Cables vary in diameter, and the application will determine the type of cable to use. 
For example, connecting a wireless LAN adapter on a notebook computer to an external 
antenna requires a specifi c type of cable that should be short and fl exible. Thick, rigid 
cables are best used for longer runs. 
The radio frequency range in which the cable will be used also is important to consider. 
Where the cable is used will determine its radio frequency rating. For example, wireless 
LANs and cellular systems use 50 ohm cable, whereas television (such as satellite and cable) 
will use 75 ohm cable. 
Using cable with the correct rating will minimize VSWR. 

132 
Chapter 3 ■ Radio Frequency and Antenna Technology Fundamentals
Figure 3.40 shows a spool of high-quality 50 ohm cable.
F I G U R E  3 . 4 0   L-com spool of low-loss 400-series coaxial bulk cable
Image provided by www.L-com.com.
RF Cable Length
The length of an RF cable used in a wireless system is another factor to consider. A cable of 
even a very short length will have some level of attenuation, causing signal loss, which is a 
decrease in signal strength. This decrease in signal strength means less overall performance 
and throughput for users of the wireless LAN. 
Professionally manufactured cables typically are available in many standard lengths. 
Best practices recommend using the correct length and minimizing connections. For exam-
ple, if a run from an access point to an external antenna is 27 feet, it would be best to use 
a single cable as close to that length as possible. Connecting two or more pieces of cable 
together will increase the loss to the system. One might be tempted to use a longer piece, 
such as 50 feet, but this is not recommended because the extra length will add loss to the 
system.
Figure 3.41 shows a short length of cable known as a pigtail used to connect a stan-
dard cable to a proprietary cable. If an RF cable is used or extended, the attenuation that 
is introduced can be offset with the use of an amplifi er or with a higher-gain antenna. An 
amplifi er will provide active gain and an antenna will provide passive gain. Keep in mind 
that using an incorrect amplifi er may void the wireless system certifi cation and that using a 
higher-gain antenna may exceed the rules set by the local RF regulatory agency. 
RF Cable Cost
RF cable cost may also play a role in the type of cable to be used. The old saying “You get 
what you pay for” is true with cables as well. I recommend using high-quality, name-brand 
RF cables to optimize the performance of your system. Premium cables may come at a 

Radio Frequency Cables and Connectors 
133
higher price, but the benefi t of a better-quality signal is the main advantage. Keep in mind 
that RF coax cables are rated differently based on the quality. I recommend reviewing the 
specifi cations of cables to verify that they will meet your requirements prior to making any 
purchase.

RF Cable Connectors
In a wireless system, radio frequency connectors are used to join devices, allowing the 
RF signal to transfer between the devices. The devices may connect from access point to 
antenna, antenna to cable, cable to cable, or in various other combinations. Standard RF 
connectors may be used in wireless systems to connect devices that are not part of the point 
connecting to the antenna. For example, an access point connecting to a length of cable 
that is then connected to an amplifi er could use a standard RF connector. The cable con-
necting the amplifi er to the antenna would require a proprietary connector. Figure 3.42 
shows examples of common RF connectors.
F I G U R E  3 . 4 2   Several common RF connectors used with wireless LANs
Image provided by www.L-com.com.

134 
Chapter 3 ■ Radio Frequency and Antenna Technology Fundamentals
RF connectors also cause an impedance mismatch to some degree and increase the level 
of VSWR. To minimize the effects of VSWR, best practices suggest keeping the use of con-
nectors to a minimum. Using connectors can also result in insertion loss. Insertion loss is 
usually minor by itself, but it can contribute to overall loss in a system, thereby resulting in 
less RF signal and less throughput.
Using Proprietary Connectors for Regulatory Domain Compliance
Some regulatory domains require the use of proprietary connectors on antennas and 
antenna connections in wireless LAN systems. Proprietary connectors prevent an 
installer or integrator from unintentionally using an antenna that might exceed the maxi-
mum amount of power allowed for the transmission system. Although these connectors 
are considered proprietary, many manufacturers share proprietary connectors:
 
■
MC connectors are used by Dell, Buffalo, IBM, Toshiba, and Proxim-ORiNOCO.
 
■
MMCX connectors are used by 3Com, Cisco, Proxim, Samsung, and Motorola.
 
■
MCX connectors are used by Apple and SMC devices.
 
■
RP-MMCX connectors are used by SMC devices.
Antenna Installation Considerations
Several factors are important to consider when you are planning to install a wireless net-
work. These include earth curvature, multipath, and radio frequency line of sight. The 
following sections include information about how to take these factors into account when 
planning a wireless system installation.
Maintaining Clear Communications
Factors that affect whether two wireless devices can communicate with each other include 
line of sight (both visual and RF) and Fresnel zone. Indoor wireless installations use a low 
amount of radio frequency transmit power, usually around 30 mW to 50 mW, and will be 
able to communicate effectively even if the wireless client device does not have a line of 
sight with an access point. This is because the RF will be able to penetrate obstacles such as 
walls, windows, and doors. Outdoor installations usually use a much higher output trans-
mit power and will require an RF line of sight for effective communication.

Antenna Installation Considerations 
135
Line of Sight in Wireless Communications
Radio frequency communication between devices using wireless technology involves dif-
ferent types of line of sight. There are two types of line of sight to take into account when 
planning, designing, and installing wireless networks and using wireless technology:
 
■
Visual line of sight
 
■
Direct link radio frequency (RF) line of sight
Visual Line of Sight
Visual line of sight (LoS) is defi ned as the capability of two points to have an unobstructed 
view of one another. With IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN systems, a visual LoS is implied with 
the RF LoS. If a wireless LAN engineer was planning to connect two buildings using wire-
less LAN technology, one of the fi rst things the engineer would do is to verify that there is 
a clear, unobstructed view between the planned locations in order to provide an RF LoS. 
In this case a radio transmitter and radio receiver can “see” each other. For wireless net-
working direct link communication to be successful in an outdoor wireless connection, 
there should be a clear, unobstructed view between the transmitter and receiver. An unob-
structed line of sight means no obstacles are blocking the RF signal between these devices.
Radio Frequency Line of Sight
For two devices to successfully communicate at a distance via radio frequency, including 
point-to-point or point-to-multipoint connections, a clear path for the RF energy to travel 
between the two points is necessary. This clear path is called RF LoS. This RF LoS is the 
premise on which the Fresnel zone is based. 
Fresnel Zone
The Fresnel zone for an RF signal is the area of radio frequency coverage surrounding the 
visual LoS. The Fresnel zone consists of a number of concentric ellipsoidal volumes that 
surround the direct RF line of sight between two points, such as an RF transmitter and 
receiver. One example is a point-to-point connection between two radio towers. 
The width or area of the Fresnel zone will depend on the specifi c radio frequency used 
as well as the length or distance of the signal path. There is a mathematical formula used to 
calculate the width of the Fresnel zone at the widest point. 
In an outdoor point-to-point or point-to-multipoint installation, it is important for 
the Fresnel zone to be clear of obstructions for successful communications to take place 
between a radio frequency transmitter and receiver. Best practices recommend maintain-
ing an obstruction-free clearance of at least 60 percent for the Fresnel zone in order to have 
acceptable RF LoS. Maintaining a clear RF LoS becomes more diffi cult as the distance 

136 
Chapter 3 ■ Radio Frequency and Antenna Technology Fundamentals
between two points increases. Obstructions such as these can cause the Fresnel zone to be 
blocked enough for communications to suffer between a transmitter and receiver:
 
■
Trees
 
■
Buildings or other structures
 
■
Earth curvature
 
■
Natural elements such as hills and mountains
Figure 3.43 illustrates the Fresnel zone between two highly directional antennas.
F I G U R E  3 . 4 3   Visualization of Fresnel zone
Fresnel Zone
To stay clear of obstructions, carefully plan your antenna placement and antenna height. 
Keep in mind that a wireless link may cross public areas in which an integrator or installer 
will have no control over the environment. There is a possibility, depending on the environ-
mental conditions, that a wireless link may not be a feasible solution due to the inability to 
maintain an RF LoS. You should perform an outdoor site survey prior to the procurement 
and installation of wireless system hardware to ensure that the installation and operation of 
the wireless LAN will be successful. 
One way to analogize line of sight is by picturing two people looking at each other. If 
two people about the same height and standing at some distance apart are making direct 
eye contact, they have a good visual line of sight. In addition to being able to see directly in 
front of them, people have peripheral vision. Peripheral vision gives people the ability to see 
movement and objects outside of their direct line of sight or direct eye contact. This periph-
eral vision or side vision is analogous to the Fresnel zone theory.
Exercise 3.3 shows a simple way to demonstrate the concept of a blocked Fresnel zone.

Antenna Installation Considerations 
137
E X E R C I S E  3 . 3
Demonstrating Fresnel Zone and Blockage
Here is one way to demonstrate the Fresnel zone. Focus your eyes at a location on a wall. 
Make sure there are obstacles or movement off to both left and right sides of your view. 
Hold your hands down to your sides. Continue to focus your eyes for a minute or so, and 
then take your right, left, or both hands and slowly raise them from your sides toward the 
side of your head while blocking your peripheral vision. You’ll notice as your hands get 
closer to the side of your head the view of the objects or movement to the sides will be 
blocked by your hands. This is an example of a blocked Fresnel zone.
Sixty percent of the total area of the Fresnel zone must be clear of obsta-
cles in order to have a good RF line of sight.
Because of the low transmit and receive power and a short range, a visual line of sight is 
not required for most indoor wireless deployments. An indoor wireless LAN access point 
may cover areas that are divided by walls and other obstacles. With this short range, and 
if the radio frequency is able to penetrate the obstacles, wireless communication between a 
transmitter and a receiver may be successful even when the devices do not have a visual line 
of sight.
Earth Curvature Effects on Propagation
Beyond a distance of seven miles, the curvature of the earth will have an impact on point-
to-point or point-to-multipoint wireless connections. Therefore, it is important to add 
height to the antenna to compensate for the earth curvature, sometimes referred to as earth 
bulge. A mathematical formula is used to calculate the additional height of antennas when 
a link exceeds seven miles (11.2654 kilometers).
Antenna Placement
The installation location and placement of antennas depend on the type of antenna and 
the application in which it will be used. When installing antennas, consider the placement 
based on the design of the wireless system and the intended use of the antenna. When 
antennas are used outdoors, lightning arrestors, grounding, and adherence to local codes, 
laws, and government regulations must be followed as well as good RF design. Increasingly, 
local ordinances dictate how or if outdoor antennas can be mounted for looks as well as 
safety. Lightning arrestors and grounding methods are discussed in the upcoming section 
“Wind and Lightning.”

138 
Chapter 3 ■ Radio Frequency and Antenna Technology Fundamentals
Omnidirectional Antenna Placement
Placement of an omnidirectional antenna will depend on the intended use. Some omnidi-
rectional antennas can be connected directly to a wireless access point or may be integrated 
within the access point. In this confi guration, the installation is fairly straightforward; it 
involves simply attaching the antenna to the access point or using the integrated antenna. 
Omnidirectional antennas are usually placed in the center of the intended coverage area. 
High-gain omnidirectional antennas are typically used in outdoor installations for point-
to-multipoint confi gurations. This confi guration is more complex because more than likely 
it requires mast or tower mounting. The exact placement depends on the intended coverage 
area as well as the gain of the antenna.
Semidirectional Antenna Placement
Semidirectional antennas may be used for either outdoor or indoor installations. When 
mounted indoors, a patch/panel antenna typically will be mounted fl at on a wall with the 
connector facing upward for connections to a cable or directly to an access point. A tem-
plate with the hole placement may be included for ease of installation. Usually four mount-
ing holes (one in each corner) will be used to securely fasten the antenna to the wall. 
Yagi antennas can also be mounted either indoors or outdoors. The most common 
installation is outdoors for short-range point-to-point or point-to-multipoint bridging solu-
tions. This will require a mounting bracket such as a tilt and swivel for wall mounting or 
U-bolts and a plate for mast or pole mounting.
Highly Directional Antenna Placement
Highly directional antennas such as a parabolic dish are almost always used exclusively 
in outdoor installations. This type of antenna is used mostly for long-range point-to-
point bridging links and will require installation on building rooftops or antenna towers. 
Alignment for long-range links is critical for reliable communications. Software and hard-
ware tools are available for the installer to use for accurate alignment. As with other out-
door installations, secure mounting is essential to maintain safety and link reliability.
Wind and Lightning
Weather conditions such as rain, snow, and sleet typically do not affect wireless LAN com-
munications unless the conditions are extreme or snow and sleet collect on antenna ele-
ments. However, wind and lightning can affect wireless communications.
Most outdoor antennas that can be affected by wind will have wind-loading data in the 
specifi cation sheet. Wind loading is the result of wind blowing at high speeds and causing 
the antenna to move.
Lightning can destroy components connected to a network if the antenna takes either a 
direct or an indirect lightning strike. A properly grounded lightning arrestor will help pro-
tect the wireless system and other networking equipment from indirect lightning strikes.

Antenna Installation Considerations 
139
Lightning Arrestors
Potentially damaging transient or induced electrical currents are the result of an indirect 
lightning strike in the area of a wireless antenna system. A lightning arrestor is an in-series 
device installed after the antenna is installed and prior to the installation of a transmitter/
receiver. Although this device will not provide protection from a direct lightning strike, 
it will help protect against an indirect lightning strike, which can damage electronics at 
distances away from the source of the strike. When the induced electrical currents from a 
lightning strike travel to the antenna, a lightning arrestor will shunt the excess current to 
ground, protecting the system from damage. Figure 3.44 shows a lightning arrestor.

Grounding Rods
A grounding rod is a metal shaft used for grounding a device such as an antenna used in a 
wireless system. The rod should be driven into the ground at least 8 feet deep. Grounding 
rods are available in various types of steel, including stainless, galvanized, and copper clad. 
They are also available in a variety of diameters and lengths. Depending on the local elec-
trical code, the grounding system should measure resistance between 5 and 25 ohms. Local 
code should also be consulted regarding material, diameter, and length of grounding rods. 
You should not share grounding rods with other equipment because interference or damage 
may occur.
It is imperative to install a grounding rod properly to ensure correct opera-
tion. If installing a grounding rod and other lightning protection equipment 
is beyond the knowledge level of the wireless engineer or installer, it is 
best to have a professional contractor perform the job.

140 
Chapter 3 ■ Radio Frequency and Antenna Technology Fundamentals
Installation Safety
Professional contractors should be considered in the event you are not comfortable with 
performing the installation of a wireless system antenna yourself. Bonded or certifi ed tech-
nicians may be required to install antennas. Be sure to check local building codes prior to 
performing any installation of a wireless system antenna. Never underestimate safety when 
installing or mounting antennas. All safety precautions must be adhered to while perform-
ing an installation. The following are some general guidelines and precautions to be consid-
ered for a wireless system antenna installation:
 
■
Read the installation manual from the manufacturer.
 
■
Always avoid power lines. Contact with power lines can result in death.
 
■
Always use the correct safety equipment when working at heights.
 
■
Correctly install and use grounding rods when appropriate.
 
■
Comply with regulations for use of antennas in the area and for use of towers as well.
Antenna Mounting
In addition to choosing the correct antenna to be used with a wireless system, you must 
take into account the antenna mounting. The required antenna mounting fi xture will 
depend on the antenna type, whether it will be used indoors or outdoors, and whether it 
will be used for device/client access or bridging solutions such as point-to-point or point-
to-multipoint. It is best to consult with the antenna or device manufacturer to determine 
which mounting fi xture is appropriate for use based on the intended deployment scenario. 
The following are several mounting types that may be used for a wireless system antenna 
solution:
 
■
Internal and external (to the AP) antennas
 
■
Pole/mast mount
 
■
Ceiling mount
 
■
Wall mount
Pole and Mast Mounting
Pole/mast mounts typically consist of a mounting bracket and U-bolt mounting hardware. 
The mounting bracket is commonly L-shaped. One side of the bracket has a hole to mount 
an omnidirectional or similar antenna. The other side of the bracket has predrilled holes 
for fastening the bracket to a pole using U-bolts. Figure 3.45 shows an example of a station-
ary antenna mast mounting kit.

mast mount adapter.
E X E R C I S E  3 . 4
Installing a Pole/Mast Mount
This exercise explains the process for installing an omnidirectional antenna to a mast 
using a mounting bracket designed speciﬁ cally designed for this purpose.
1. 
Attach the mounting bracket to the mast using the supplied hardware.
2. 
Remove the antenna mounting bolt and washer from the base of the antenna.
3. 
Insert the antenna into the hole in the top of the mounting bracket. Without overtight-
ening, securely fasten the antenna to the mounting bracket using the washer and 
antenna mounting bolt.
4. 
For outdoor installations, remember to use the proper sealant for weatherprooﬁ ng 
when connecting the cable to the antenna.

Lightning arrestors and proper earth grounding must also be considered if you are in 
an area that could be affected by this type of weather condition.

Ceiling Mounting
It may be necessary to mount to a ceiling certain types of external antennas or wireless 
infrastructure devices such as an access point with attached or integrated antennas. Many 
antennas can be mounted directly to a hard ceiling made from concrete, drywall, or similar 
material. Another possibility is a drop ceiling with acoustic tiles. Regardless of the type of 
ceiling in question, follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the appropriate fi xture to 
be used for mounting and detailed instructions for ceiling mounts. Figure 3.46 shows an 
example of a ceiling mount antenna.

Wall Mounting
Antennas or access points with attached antennas may need to be mounted to a wall based 
on the use or site survey results. Just as with a ceiling mount, follow the manufacturer’s 
instructions for the appropriate fi xture for wall mounting. 
When mounting an antenna to the wall, consider the polarization of the antenna. Keep 
in mind that some antennas are designed to be mounted on the ceiling; these types should 
not be mounted on a wall. This is especially true for access points or other wireless infra-
structure devices with integrated antennas. It is best to try to match the polarization of 
the wireless infrastructure device and the wireless client devices. In other words, if the 
infrastructure device antennas are vertically polarized, the wireless client devices should be 
polarized in the same manner to promote better connectivity. However, with the wide vari-
ety of newer wireless client devices available, this is getting harder to achieve. 
Choosing the correct antenna and mounting position is typically part of a wireless site 
survey.

Summary
This chapter explored radio frequency basics and the essential role radio frequency (RF) 
plays in the world of wireless computer and cellular network communications. You learned 
the defi nition of RF as it pertains to wireless networking and examined its basic character-
istics or properties, such as wavelength, frequency, amplitude, and phase.
I then described devices such as transmitters and receivers and how they communicate. 
In wireless LAN technology, an example of a transmitter and receiver is an access point 
and client device. I also discussed the unlicensed RF bands and channels used in the 2.4 
GHz ISM and 5 GHz U-NII ranges for wireless LAN communications as well as other fre-
quency ranges that may be allowed for use with IEEE 80211 wireless networking and cel-
lular phone communications.
You learned about RF behaviors such as refl ection, refraction, absorption, and others 
and the impact of building materials and the effect they have on the propagation of radio 
waves. Also covered were RF units of measure (both absolute and relative), including the 
watt, milliwatt, dB, and dBi.
Antennas are a critical component in a successful operation of a wireless communi-
cations system. You learned about radio frequency signal characteristics and basic RF 
antenna concepts such as radio frequency lobes, beamwidth, gain, and polarization.
If you understand these characteristics and concepts, a sales engineer, integrator, or 
other wireless systems professional can help you choose the best antenna for a specifi c use.
Understanding the radio frequency propagation patterns of various antenna types as 
well as the recommended use of an antenna will assist in deciding which antenna is best 
suited for the desired application. Omnidirectional antennas are one of the most common 
types of antenna used for indoor applications of wireless computer networks and other 
wireless systems. Omnidirectional antennas provide a horizontal radiation pattern of 360°. 
Other antennas such as patch/panel, yagi, and parabolic dish can also be used. You learned 
about the radiation patterns of each of these types of antennas as well as how each may be 
used.
A proper mounting fi xture is required to ensure safety and correct operation of the 
antenna and wireless network. In this chapter we looked at various methods for mounting 
antennas, including integrated and external (to the access point), pole/mast mount, ceiling 
mount, and wall mount.
Finally, you learned about other factors to be considered when choosing and installing 
an antenna for use with wireless LANs. These include line of sight and Fresnel zone.
Understanding the concepts covered in this chapter will help you achieve more successful 
deployment, operation, and use of antennas in wireless communication systems.

IEEE standards–based wireless technology continues to take 
mobile device and computer communications to a new level. 
This communication technology combines computer network-
ing and radio frequency (RF) technology, giving users the opportunity to access and share 
information in ways that would have seemed unattainable not too many years ago. In this 
chapter, I’ll explain the role of the organization that is responsible for creating and man-
aging wireless communication standards. We’ll take an in-depth look at the IEEE 802.11 
standard and its amendments, including the communications and functional aspects. We 
will look briefl y at two other IEEE wireless standards, IEEE 802.15 and IEEE 802.16. You 
will also see interoperability certifi cations for IEEE 802.11 wireless networks for communi-

is also important to understand the various ways in which wireless technology fi ts with com-
puter networking in general and the various physical applications in which it is used. In this 
chapter, we will take a look at how wireless technology allows users to connect to and use 
resources in a wireless technology environment. Finally, we will examine various common 
ways in which wireless local networks are used and deployed.
The IEEE
The IEEE (originally known as the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers), 
commonly pronounced “eye triple E,” is a nonprofi t organization responsible for generat-
ing a variety of technology standards, including those related to information technology. 
According to the mission statement on the IEEE’s website, its core purpose is to foster tech-
nological innovation and excellence for the benefi t of humanity. The IEEE is the world’s 
largest technical professional society.
Since 1997 a series of standards related to wireless technology have been released by the 
IEEE. These standards are all named IEEE 802 followed by combinations of numbers and 
letters to defi ne specifi c standards and amendments.
The IEEE consists of working groups that are made up of individual members and 
experts in the fi eld. With respect to wireless technology the IEEE working groups are as 
follows:
 
■
IEEE 802.11 – Wireless Local Area Networking
 
■
IEEE 802.15 – Wireless Personal Area Networking

IEEE Standards for Wireless Communication 
147
 
■
IEEE 802.16 – Broadband Wireless Metropolitan Area Networks

IEEE Standards for Wireless 
Communication
The IEEE wireless networking standard and its amendments that identify advancements 
in the technology defi ne the power, range, and speed of the radio frequency and WLAN 
technology. The IEEE 802.11 standard specifi es the maximum amount of radio frequency 
(RF) transmit power, the allowed radio frequency spectrum (which is related to the range), 
and the allowed data rates, or speed. At the time of this writing, all ratifi ed IEEE 802.11 
amendments have been incorporated into the IEEE 802.11-2012 standard with the 
exception of the most recent amendments including IEEE 802.11ac, IEEE 802.11ad and a 
few others.
Even though some of these are now legacy amendments, it is important to understand 
the foundation and advancements in standards-based wireless technology that have 
developed into our current system.
The IEEE 802.11 Standard
The IEEE 802.11 standard, released in 1997, is what initially defi ned the wireless LAN 
communication standards. The data rates used in this original standard (1 and 2 Mbps) are 
considered very slow compared to today’s technology.
As of this writing, the IEEE 802.11-2012 standard is the most current ratified 
IEEE 802.11 standard. This latest version combines the IEEE 802.11-2007 
standard and outstanding amendments at the time of ratification, such 
as IEEE 802.11k/n/p/r/s/u/v/w/y/z, into one document. However, many in 
the industry still refer to the original names of the amendments: 802.11b, 
802.11a, 802.11g, 802.11n, and so on. The IEEE considers all of the previ-
ously published amendments and revisions retired as a result of the 
release of the newest IEEE 802.11-2012 standard.

Chapter 4 ■ Standards and Certifications for Wireless Technology
Here are the frequency range, spread spectrum/Physical layer (PHY) technology, and 
data rates for the original IEEE 802.11-1997 standard: 
 
■
2.4 GHz ISM band
 
■
Frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS)
 
■
Direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS)
 
■
Infrared (IR)
 
■
1 and 2 Mbps
Frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) is considered legacy technology with regard 
to IEEE 802.11 wireless networking. However, it is still used in other wireless technologies, 
such as IEEE 802.15 Bluetooth devices and wireless, cordless public-switched telephone 
network (PSTN) telephones.
You will learn more about these Physical layer technologies in Chapter 5, “IEEE 802.11 
Terminology and Technology.”

ments, visit the Official IEEE 802.11 Working Group Project Timelines web 
page at www.ieee802.org/11/Reports/802.11_Timelines.htm.
The IEEE 802.11a Amendment
This amendment to the IEEE 802.11 standard is what defi nes operation in the 5 GHz U-NII 
band. (U-NII stands for Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure.) Released in 1999, 
this amendment originally defi nes only three frequency ranges in three bands in the 5 GHz 
frequency range—U-NII-1, U-NII-2, and U-NII-3. The U-NII-1 band is intended for indoor 
use only, the U-NII-2 band is for indoor or outdoor use, and the U-NII-3 band may be used 
indoors or outdoors but is most commonly used outdoors. The data rates for IEEE 802.11a 
are up to 54 Mbps using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). OFDM and 
other Physical layer technologies will be discussed in Chapter 5. Although this amendment 
was released in 1999, devices were not widely available until 2001.
Here are the frequency range, PHY technology, and data rates as specifi ed in the original 
IEEE 802.11a amendment (keep in mind this has since changed because of relaxed local 
regulatory requirements):
 
■
5GHz U-NII band
 
■
5.150–5.250 GHz U-NII-1
 
■
5.250–5.350 GHz U-NII-2
 
■
5.725–5.825 GHz U-NII-3

Data Rates
A benefi t to using the 5 GHz U-NII band is that more bandwidth is available compared 
to the 2.4 GHz ISM band and there is less interference because not all wireless devices sup-
port operation in this band. The 5 GHz U-NII band supports up to 23 nonoverlapping 20 
MHz wide channels compared to only three nonoverlapping channels in the 2.4 GHz ISM 
band, therefore providing more available and usable 5 GHz frequency. Currently, fewer 
devices use the 5 GHz U-NII license-free band than use the 2.4 GHz ISM license-free band, 
including non-802.11 devices. However, the number of wireless devices that operate in the 
5 GHz band is always increasing. If there are fewer devices that utilize the band, it means 
less interference, which allows for increased performance and reliability. With the intro-
duction of the IEEE 802.11ac amendment, the number of devices using the 5 GHz band 
will continue to grow because this is the only band supported for that technology. IEEE 
802.11ac is discussed later.
Since the IEEE 802.11a amendment was ratified, some changes have been 
implemented and are now addressed in the IEEE 802.11-2012 standard 
and previously in the 802.11-2007 standard. They include a new frequency 
range (5.470–5.725 GHz) that is allowed by some local regulatory agen-
cies and is known as the U-NII-2e band. This extra frequency space allows 
for 11 additional 20 MHz-wide nonoverlapping channels. The new IEEE 
802.11ac amendment added one more channel to the 5 GHz U-NII band 
which now provides a total of 24 nonoverlapping channels.

Chapter 4 ■ Standards and Certifications for Wireless Technology
The IEEE 802.11b Amendment
The IEEE 802.11b amendment to the 802.11 standard specifi es technology that works only 
in the 2.4–2.5 GHz ISM band. This amendment, released in 1999, specifi es what is known 
as high-rate direct sequence spread spectrum (HR/DSSS) for 5.5 and 11 Mbps. 
The IEEE 802.11b amendment was released before the IEEE 802.11a 
amendment.
Here are the frequency range, Physical layer (PHY) technology, spread spectrum 
technology, and data rates for the IEEE 802.11b amendment:
 
■
2.4 GHz ISM band
 
■
2.4–2.4835 GHz in North America, China, and Europe (excluding Spain and France)
 
■
Direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS)
 
■
High-rate direct sequence spread spectrum (HR/DSSS)
 
■
5.5 and 11 Mbps
 
■
Backward compatible to 802.11 DSSS for 1 and 2 Mbps
With the release of the IEEE 802.11b amendment, wireless LAN technology became 
more affordable and mainstream. This amendment introduced two higher-rate data speeds, 
5.5 and 11 Mbps, making the technology more desirable at that time. 
Today wireless infrastructure device manufacturers still support IEEE 802.11b wireless 
technology; however, it is unlikely you would be able to purchase any “new” devices that 
support only IEEE 802.11b technology. As wireless technologies continue to evolve, there 
are very few if any IEEE 802.11b–only networks, and many organizations are no longer 
supporting this legacy technology at all and are disabling the capability within their sys-
tems. Devices sold today that operate in the 2.4 GHz ISM band support IEEE 802.11b/g/n 
and may be marketed as such or as IEEE 802.11g/n, which implies support for IEEE 
802.11b.
The IEEE 802.11g Amendment
This amendment to the IEEE 802.11 standard was released in 2003. Like 802.11 and 
802.11b, it operates in the 2.4 GHz ISM band. This amendment addresses extended data 
rates with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technology and is back-
ward compatible with 802.11 and 802.11b.
Here are the frequency range, PHY technology, spread spectrum technology, and data 
rates for the IEEE 802.11g amendment:
 
■
2.4 GHz ISM band
 
■
2.4–2.4835 GHz in North America, China, and Europe (excluding Spain and France)

F I G U R E  4 . 2   Cisco wireless LAN controller IEEE 802.11g data rates
IEEE 802.11b/g
Data Rates
IEEE 802.11g is backward compatible with 802.11 and 802.11b because it operates in 
the same 2.4 GHz ISM license-free band and supports the same access methods or tech-
nology as 802.11b. One benefi t of IEEE 802.11g compatibility is that many established 
network infrastructures and devices have used 802.11 and 802.11b for years. This allowed 
them to continue to operate as normal with upgrades or replacements as appropriate or 
necessary.
To allow the slower DSSS and HR/DSSS data rates of 1, 2, 5.5, and 11 Mbps 
to operate in an IEEE 802.11g network, the amendment addresses the use 
of protection mechanisms. These protection mechanisms will degrade the 
performance of IEEE 802.11g clients to some degree when IEEE 802.11b 
radios are present in the basic service area (BSA).

152 
Chapter 4 ■ Standards and Certifications for Wireless Technology
Many organizations have dropped support for IEEE 802.11b devices altogether. One 
way to accomplish this is to disable the 802.11b data rates on the infrastructure devices—
access points, controllers, and so on. This is done to minimize performance issues such 
as lower throughput when IEEE 802.11b devices are present in the IEEE 802.11g BSA. In 
some deployment scenarios, such as public wireless hotspots or areas with wireless guest 
networks, it would be diffi cult to disallow the use of IEEE 802.11b devices. However, this 
is strictly a decision to be made by the organization and information technology staff.
Maximizing Throughput in an IEEE 802.11g Network
In certain cases the only way to maximize the throughput of an 802.11g network is to set 
the data rates of the access points to support 802.11g data rates only. The trade-off is 
that 802.11b devices will not be able to connect to the network because the access point 
will not recognize the 802.11b data rates. With the newer technology available today, 
turning off support for 802.11b is becoming less of an issue. This would work well where 
backward compatibility with 802.11b is not required and all equipment in use supports 
802.11g or newer capability. An analogy would be a group of individuals all speaking one 
language. They all understand the same language, so they have no need to accommodate 
a second language.
Because of protection mechanisms deﬁ ned in the 802.11g amendment, throughput will 
degrade in an 802.11b/g mixed mode environment when 802.11b devices are present. The 
802.11b devices have a maximum data rate of only 11 Mbps (HR/DSSS), and they share 
the medium with the 802.11g devices that have a maximum data rate of 54 Mbps (ERP-
OFDM). Think of the language analogy. If a group of individuals are speaking two differ-
ent languages, a translator may be required for complete communication. A discussion 
among the group would take longer because the translator would need to translate the 
languages. Likewise, protection mechanisms will have an impact on the throughput for 
the 802.11g devices because the 2.4 GHz medium is shared. If there are no 802.11b devices 
in the radio range of an access point in an 802.11b/g mixed mode environment, protection 
mechanisms should not affect throughput because the access point will not have to share 
the medium with the two different technologies, ERP-OFDM and HR/DSSS.
If you do not have any 802.11b devices on your network, you can set your access point to 
802.11g–only mode by disabling the 802.11b data rates. In this conﬁ guration, your 802.11g 
devices will perform better because protection mechanisms will not be enabled. How-
ever, if there are any 802.11b devices that don’t belong to your network in the “listening” 
range of the access point, data collisions will increase at the access point. This is because 
802.11b and 802.11g operate in the same RF range and the 802.11g (ERP-OFDM) access 
point would stop listening to the 802.11b (HR/DSSS) transmissions. (It would simply see 
them as RF noise.) In this conﬁ guration, overall throughput will still exceed that of an 
access point set to 802.11b/g mixed mode in the presence of 802.11b devices. The access 
point will hear the 802.11b transmissions, but they will not be serviced since they are only 
seen as RF noise. Thus they will have less impact on throughput.

The IEEE 802.11n Amendment
After several years of drafts, the IEEE 802.11n amendment was fi nally approved in 
September 2009. The release of this document opened the doors for manufacturers of IEEE 
802.11 wireless LAN equipment, giving them the opportunity to move forward with new 
technology that allows for better performance, higher throughput, and several other ben-
efi ts. Wi-Fi–certifi ed devices under 802.11n draft 2.0 were available for several years prior 
to the ratifi cation of IEEE 802.11n. Most if not all enterprise manufacturers had at least 
one wireless infrastructure device certifi ed under draft 2.0 by the Wi-Fi Alliance prior to 
the release of the new amendment.
Here are the frequency range, PHY technology, data rates, and other details for the 
IEEE 802.11n amendment:
 
■
2.4 GHz ISM band
 
■
5 GHz U-NII band
 
■
Multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO technology)
 
■

Chapter 4 ■ Standards and Certifications for Wireless Technology
IEEE 802.11n devices are capable of operating in unlicensed frequency bands, the 2.4 
GHz ISM band, and the 5 GHz U-NII band. This means that they must be backward com-
patible with previous technologies, such as IEEE 802.11b/g devices that operate in the 2.4 
GHz ISM band and IEEE 802.11a devices that operate in the 5 GHz U-NII band.
Multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) is a big part of what makes IEEE 802.11n such 
an amazing technology. Prior to 802.11n, IEEE 802.11a/b/g devices used a single radio to 
transmit and receive radio signals. This is known as single-input, single-output (SISO) tech-
nology. MIMO uses multiple radios or “radio chains” to transmit and receive radio signals. 
SISO systems were subject to multipath, in which several wavefronts of a signal would be 
received out of phase because of refl ections. This is a problem for IEEE 802.11a/b/g sys-
tems, whereas MIMO actually uses the refl ections to help enhance the performance and 
throughput using several radio chains in 802.11n. With the use of MIMO technology, a 
device can get better signal than with previous technologies at some distance from a wire-
less access point, which will in turn provide a higher data rate at that distance. Therefore, 
in a sense the device will potentially get better usable range with 802.11n technology. 
MIMO consists of several types of new technologies:
 
■
Transmit beamforming (TxBF)
 
■
Maximal ratio combining (MRC)
 
■
Spatial multiplexing (SM)
 
■
Space time block coding (STBC)
It is best to check with the specifi c manufacturers of the wireless equipment to determine 
how they implement MIMO technology. IEEE 802.11n provides many enhancements to the 
Physical layer 1 (PHY), including the following: 
 
■
40 MHz channels through the use of channel bonding
 
■
More subcarriers for higher data rates
 
■
Optional short guard intervals to provide more potential throughput
 
■
Varying modulation types for data rates of up to 600 Mbps
The Media Access Control (MAC) sublayer of the Data Link layer also provides 
enhancements to improve performance and throughput with IEEE 802.11n. These include 
but are not limited to the following:
 
■
Frame aggregation for less 802.11 overhead
 
■
Block acknowledgments (block ACKs)
 
■
Reduced interframe spacing (RIFS)
 
■
Spatial multiplexing power save (SMPS) to help conserve battery life
 
■
Power save multi-poll (PSMP) for devices enabled for quality of service (QoS)
The IEEE 802.11n amendment opened the doors for the continued growth with stan-
dards-based wireless LAN technology. MIMO and other enhancements will continue to 
play a role with newer innovation as this technology progresses.

The IEEE 802.11ac Amendment
The IEEE 802.11ac amendment is an exciting step forward with standards-based wireless 
LAN technology. This new gigabit wireless networking technology is used with wireless 
local area networking for both home and enterprise applications. As technology continues 
to advance, the users of the connected devices want more data, they want it faster, and they 
want it available everywhere. Like the IEEE 802.11a amendment to the standard, 802.11ac 
technology operates in the 5 GHz band only and is a Physical layer extension of IEEE 
802.11n, providing backward compatibility with that technology in the 5 GHz frequency 
band.  IEEE 802.11ac brings the following enhancements:
Data Rates up to 6.93 Gbps  IEEE 802.11ac, Very High Throughput (VHT) provides the 
capability of up to 6.93 Gbps of aggregate throughput. The actual amount of throughput 
will vary and can be affected by several factors, including the number of radio chains/spa-
tial streams and antennas.
256-QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation)  The Modulation and Coding Scheme 
(MCS) concept was introduced with the IEEE 802.11n amendment. Basically, MCS is a 
way to represent the data transfer rates with the newer, more sophisticated technology. 
The MCS index will vary based on the technology in place, such as the number of spatial 
streams, the channel width, and the short guard interval. IEEE 802.11ac allows for 
256-QAM up from 64-QAM in 802.11n.
Wider Channels  Bandwidth with respect to radio frequency can be considered to be a 
range of frequencies used for a specifi c application. IEEE 802.11n increased the RF chan-
nel width from 20 MHz to 40 MHz. This newest amendment to the standard allows for 80 
MHz and even 160 MHz wide channels. Wider channels mean more bandwidth per 
channel and therefore higher throughput.
More Spatial Streams  The IEEE 802.11n amendment allowed for a possible four spatial 
streams maximum; however, most manufacturers utilized only three. IEEE 802.11ac will 
allow for up to eight spatial streams. More spatial streams means a higher data rate and 
this will parlay into higher throughput.
Multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO)  Until now, IEEE 802.11 technology was based on uni-
cast communication between two stations, such as a client device and an access point, or 
broadcast/multicast communication, such as an access point to many or to all connected 
stations. IEEE 802.11ac provides multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) for communication. 
MU-MIMO will allow different stations (client devices) to send or receive independent data 
streams simultaneously using multiple antennas / radio chains.
IEEE 802.11ac is backward compatible with devices operating in the 5 GHz band and 
will be benefi cial for certain types of applications, such as streaming video and/or areas 
that may need additional capacity, and for minimizing issues in high-density deployments. 
One thing that is often overlooked is the actual physical wired infrastructure in which the 
wireless access points are connected. It is important to be certain that the wired infrastruc-
ture capacity is available to handle these faster speeds.

Chapter 4 ■ Standards and Certifications for Wireless Technology
The IEEE 802.11ad amendment (Very High Throughput 60 GHz) was rati-
fied in December 2012. This technology operates in the unlicensed 60 GHz 
frequency band and is not backward compatible with IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n/
ac technology. Because 802.11ad operates at such a high frequency, it has 
many limitations and does not propagate well, and communications may 
be limited to a very small physical space, such as a single room. There are 
a limited number of IEEE 802.11ad chipsets available that will provide this 
technology. However, they currently are not big within the wireless LAN 
market or widely available. Some manufacturers will produce network 
adapters that will work within the 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 60 GHz frequency 
range, but it is important to understand that even though these adapt-
ers will work in all three frequency ranges, the 802.11ad technology is not 
backward compatible with 802.11a/b/g/n/ac. The use of 802.11ad wireless 
technology includes peer-to-peer or ad hoc communications for streaming 
video and other multimedia type uses within a smaller physical area.
It is benefi cial to understand all the frequencies, PHY technology, spread spectrum tech-
nologies, and data rates for all the IEEE 802.11 standards and amendments mentioned in 
this chapter. This will help with understanding the technology. Table 4.1 provides a sum-
mary and comparison of the IEEE 802.11 communication standards and amendments.

Additional IEEE 802.11 Amendments
In addition to communications, the IEEE creates amendments defi ning specifi c technical 
functionality, including QoS and security. We will look at those functions next.
The IEEE 802.11e Amendment
The original IEEE 802.11 standard lacked Quality of Service (QoS) functionality features. In 
the original IEEE 802.11 standard, Point Coordination Function (PCF) mode provided some 
level of QoS. PCF mode is a function of the access point and allows for polling of connected 
client devices. This creates a contention-free period for data transmissions and provides QoS-
like functionality. However, few if any vendors implemented this mode of operation.
The IEEE 802.11e amendment defi nes enhancements for QoS in wireless LANs. 802.11e 
introduces a new coordination function, the hybrid coordination function (HCF). HCF 
defi nes traffi c classes and assigns a priority to the information to be transmitted. For exam-
ple, voice traffi c is given a higher priority than data traffi c, such as information being sent 
to a printer. The IEEE 802.11e amendment was incorporated into the IEEE 802.11-2007 
standard and is now part of the IEEE 802.11-2012 standard. The Wi-Fi Alliance created a 
proactive interoperability certifi cation for 802.11e called Wi-Fi Multimedia (WMM). The 
Wi-Fi Alliance and interoperability certifi cations are discussed later in this chapter.
The IEEE 802.11i Amendment
The IEEE 802.11i amendment addresses advanced security solutions for wireless 
LANs because the original IEEE 802.11 standard was known for security weaknesses. 
Manufacturers of IEEE 802.11 WLAN equipment addressed the following:
 
■
Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)
 
■
Service set identifier (SSID) hiding
 
■
Media access control (MAC) address filtering
Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), defi ned by the IEEE 802.11 standard, was intended 
to prevent casual eavesdropping. WEP was compromised early on, making wireless LANs 
vulnerable to intrusion and providing little if any security. This issue was addressed by 

158 
Chapter 4 ■ Standards and Certifications for Wireless Technology
stronger security mechanisms (mainly Counter Mode with Cipher-Block Chaining Message 
Authentication Code Protocol/Advanced Encryption Standard, or CCMP/AES) that became 
available with the introduction of the IEEE 802.11i amendment to the standard.
Service set identifi er (SSID) hiding and media access control (MAC) address fi ltering are 
both manufacturer-implemented features that may be used by some for pseudo-security. It 
is important to understand that neither of these provides any kind of security for an IEEE 
802.11 wireless network.
WEP, SSID hiding, and MAC fi ltering all have known security vulnerabilities, allow-
ing for security weaknesses in IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs. The IEEE 802.11i amendment 
addressed security weaknesses with wireless LANs by including several enhancements. The 
IEEE 802.11i amendment was incorporated into the IEEE 802.11-2007 standard and is 
now part of the IEEE 802.11-2012 standard.
The IEEE 802.11r Amendment
The IEEE 802.11r amendment was approved in May 2008. The 802.11r amendment speci-
fi es fast basic service set (BSS) transition (FT) technology. The original 1997 IEEE 802.11 
standard did not address standards-based transition mechanisms, so manufacturers used 
proprietary methods. The IEEE attempted to standardize transition techniques for wire-
less LAN technology with the ratifi cation of a recommended practice, IEEE 802.11F. This 
recommended practice was never implemented by many (if any) manufacturers and was 
eventually withdrawn by the IEEE.
The main goal of IEEE 802.11r was to provide fast basic service set (BSS) transition 
for Voice over IP (VoIP) with wireless LAN technology. Although this amendment has 
been ratifi ed for some time and most enterprise equipment manufacturers support it, they 
still rely on the use of proprietary methods for fast transition. This is partly because until 
recently there was no interoperability certifi cation by the Wi-Fi Alliance. The IEEE 802.11r 
amendment was incorporated into the IEEE 802.11-2012 standard.
The IEEE 802.11k Amendment
IEEE 802.11k is the amendment to the IEEE 802.11 standard that addresses radio resource 
management. This amendment was approved in May 2008, the same day as the IEEE 
802.11r amendment. 802.11k and 802.11r work together to form fast, secure basic service 
set transition for mobile devices. IEEE 802.11k aids the wireless device in locating the best 
access point to transition to by defi ning the technology to be used to manage the radio 
frequency. The IEEE 802.11k amendment was incorporated into the IEEE 802.11-2012 
standard.
The IEEE 802.11w Amendment
Wireless LAN management frames, such as the 802.11 authentication frames and 802.11 
association frames used in IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs, are susceptible to intrusion and 
can cause security issues. This is because the IEEE 802.11 standard did not provide any 

Wireless Networking and Communications 
159
protection for management frame information that traverses the air. With some basic 
knowledge of the technology and the correct software tools, an intruder can perform a 
denial of service (DoS) or hijacking attack. When implemented, technology specifi ed in the 
IEEE 802.11w amendment helps to mitigate these types of attacks or security issues. The 
IEEE 802.11w amendment was incorporated into the IEEE 802.11-2012 standard.
The IEEE 802.11s Amendment
The IEEE 802.11s amendment specifi es wireless mesh networking. Mesh networking with 
wired networking has been available for many years. Wireless mesh networking started 
with military deployments but has evolved into the public sector. Mesh networking allows 
infrastructure devices such as wireless access points or mesh routers to create a self-form-
ing, self-healing, and intelligent network infrastructure. Most manufacturers of enterprise 
wireless equipment have been using mesh technology for years with proprietary protocols. 
Although the IEEE has ratifi ed the standard for this technology, most manufacturers still 
use proprietary methods. The IEEE 802.11s amendment was incorporated into the IEEE 
802.11-2012 standard.
A wireless network has sometimes been referred to as a wireless distribu-
tion system (WDS). However, the newest 802.11-2012 standard states that 
“this standard specifies such a frame format and its use only for a mesh 
basic service set (MBSS). Because of this, the term WDS is obsolete and 
subject to removal in a subsequent revision of this standard.”
Wireless Networking and 
Communications
Wireless networks come in a variety of types and sizes and include the following wireless 
topologies:
 
■
Wireless personal area network (WPAN)
 
■
Wireless local area network (WLAN)
 
■
Wireless metropolitan area network (WMAN)
 
■
Wireless wide area network (WWAN)
In Chapter 1, “Computer Network Types, Topologies, and the OSI Model,” you learned 
about the different types of computer networks and some basic networking concepts. You 
will now look at some of these network types from a wireless communication perspective.

160 
Chapter 4 ■ Standards and Certifications for Wireless Technology
There are also wireless campus area networks (WCANs). CANs are 
described in Chapter 1, and some considerations regarding WCANs are 
discussed in the section “Educational Institution Deployments” later in this 
chapter.
Wireless Personal Area Networks and the IEEE 802.15 
Standard
A personal area network (PAN) is a network that connects devices within the immedi-
ate area of individual people. PANs may consist of either wired or wireless connections or 
both. Here we will look at wireless PANs. This type of network allows users to connect 
various devices wirelessly to their own personal area network, including but not limited to 
computer keyboards, mice, and headsets. 
Even though the 802.15 Working Group addresses the PAN in various forms, we will 
examine IEEE 802.15 Task Group 1, which addresses Bluetooth technology. Bluetooth 
technology is becoming the most popular technology for WPANs and uses frequency hop-
ping spread spectrum (FHSS) for communications. Bluetooth falls under the IEEE 802.15 
standard, which specifi es the WPAN standards. Bluetooth devices operate in the unlicensed 
2.4 GHz industrial, scientifi c, and medical (ISM) band, as do wireless local area networks.
WPANs may also use infrared technology, which uses near-visible light in the 850 nm to 
950 nm range for communications. Infrared technology was specifi ed in the original 802.11 
standard, but regarding the infrared (IR) specifi cation, the IEEE 802.11-2012 standard 
states that “the mechanisms described in this clause are obsolete. Consequently, this clause 
may be removed in a later revision of the standard. This clause is no longer maintained and 
may not be compatible with all features of this standard.”
Wireless Local Area Networks
Local area networks (LANs) can be defi ned as a group of computers connected by a 
physical medium in a specifi c arrangement called a topology. LANs are contained in the 
same physical area and usually are bounded by the perimeter of a building or a group of 
buildings. 
Wireless local area networks (WLANs) fall under the same description as LANs but 
no longer require a physical wire to connect devices together. Wireless LANs have been 
in existence for many years, even prior to IEEE 802.11 standards–based technology, and 
mostly include proprietary technology or are government deployments. Since the IEEE 
released the 802.11 standard in 1997, WLAN technology has continued to excel and is 
becoming a major component of every computer network. 

Wireless Networking and Communications 
161
WLANs may operate in either the licensed or unlicensed radio frequency spectrum. 
The most commonly used frequency spectrum for WLANs are the unlicensed 2.4 GHz 
ISM band and the unlicensed 5 GHz U-NII band. The frequency bands used with IEEE 
802.11 wireless networking were discussed in Chapter 3, “Radio Frequency and Antenna 
Technology Fundamentals.” 
Wireless Broadband, Metropolitan Area Networks, and 
the IEEE 802.16 Standard
Wireless broadband allows for high-speed wireless Internet access and wireless computer 
networking using a variety of technology devices. The performance and data rates will 
vary based on the type of technology used. Metropolitan area networks (MANs) consist of 
networks that may span from several blocks of buildings to entire cities and interconnect 
devices for access to computer resources in an area larger than that covered by LANs but 
smaller than the areas covered by WANs. 
You can expand on this technology and add much fl exibility to MANs by incorporat-
ing wireless technology and creating the wireless metropolitan area network (WMAN). 
The IEEE 802.16 standard was developed to defi ne the wireless metropolitan area net-
work (WMAN) standard for broadband wireless networks. This technology may fall 
under the Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) category and 
addresses different technologies. WiMAX is covered in more detail in Chapter 7, “Cellular 
Communication Technology.” The WMAN may include a combination of public and pri-
vate entities that encompass town services such as police, fi re, and public utility access.
IEEE 802.16 is actually a series of standards that specifi es wireless broadband commu-
nications. IEEE 802.16-2012 is the most current version of the standard and is a roll-up of 
some of the previous versions. Like the IEEE 802.11 standard, 802.16 specifi es the Physical 
layer (PHY) and the Medium Access Control (MAC) sublayer of Layer 2, the Data Link 
layer, for fi xed and mobile point-to-multipoint broadband wireless access systems. 
Wireless Wide Area Networks
A WAN consists of point-to-point or point-to-multipoint connections between two or more 
LANs. WANs have the capability of extending very long distances through the use of fi ber-
optic connections or leased lines from telecommunications providers. When it comes to the 
wireless wide area network (WWAN), this extends beyond the point of connecting LANs 
together. The WWAN will encompass very large geographical areas and may include differ-
ent wireless technologies, including cellular.
The WWAN also provides wireless broadband communications for Internet access 
through the use of special external adapters or even adapters built into notebook computers 
and other mobile devices, including smartphones. Because of the technology that is used, 

162 
Chapter 4 ■ Standards and Certifications for Wireless Technology
performance such as data rates may be lower than that expected and realized with IEEE 
802.11 wireless networking.
Interoperability Certifications
By creating standards, the IEEE is encouraging technological progress. Manufacturers 
often implement wireless devices and networks in a proprietary manner, within or outside 
the standard. The proprietary approach often leads to a lack of interoperability among 
devices. In the wireless community, such practices are not widely accepted. Users want all 
of their devices to function well together. The combination of proprietary implementations 
and user dissatisfaction fostered the creation of interoperability testing and certifi cations.
The following sections will cover vendor interoperability certifi cations related to IEEE 
802.11 standards–based wireless LAN equipment. These certifi cations address communica-
tions, QoS, and security.
The Wi-Fi Alliance
The IEEE is responsible for creating the standards for wireless networking and technology. 
However, equipment manufacturers are not required to provide proof that their equipment 
is compliant with the standards. Starting with the release of the IEEE 802.11b amend-
ment, several early WLAN equipment manufacturers—including Symbol Systems, Aironet, 
and Lucent—formed an organization known as Wireless Ethernet Compatibility Alliance 
(WECA) to promote the technology and to provide interoperability testing of wireless LAN 
equipment manufactured by these and other companies. In 2000, WECA was renamed the 
Wi-Fi Alliance. The term Wi-Fi represents a certifi cation and is often misused by people in 
the industry. Wi-Fi is a registered trademark, originally registered in 1999 by WECA and 
now registered to the Wi-Fi Alliance. People often use the term Wi-Fi synonymously with 
wireless LAN technology; in fact it means wireless technology certifi ed to be interoperable.
For additional information about the Wi-Fi Alliance, visit www.wi-fi.org.
Figure 4.4 shows an example of a Wi-Fi Certifi ed logo, showing that the device has met 
the interoperability testing criteria. 
Wi-Fi Protected Access Certification
The Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) certifi cation was developed because security in the 
original IEEE 802.11 standard was weak and had many vulnerabilities. This certifi ca-
tion was designed as an interim solution until an amendment to the IEEE 802.11 standard 

Interoperability Certifications 
163
addressing security improvements was released. The IEEE 802.11i amendment addressed 
security for the IEEE 802.11 family of standards. The bottom line is that WPA is a pre-
802.11i certifi cation, introducing more advanced security solutions such as Temporal Key 
Integrity Protocol (TKIP), passphrase, and 802.1X/EAP.
F I G U R E  4 . 4   Wi-Fi certified logo for devices that are Wi-Fi certified
This pre-802.11i certifi cation addressed two options for wireless LAN security: personal 
mode and enterprise mode. Personal mode is intended for small offi ce, home offi ce (SOHO) 
and home users. Enterprise mode is intended for larger deployments. Personal mode 
allowed for a user to enter an 8- to 63-character passphrase (password) on both the access 
point and all of the devices that connected to the access point. Enterprise mode provides 
user-based authentication utilizing 802.1X/EAP. Both personal and enterprise modes are 
discussed in more detail in Chapter 16, “Device Authentication and Data Encryption.” 
Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 Certification
The WPA certifi cation by the Wi-Fi Alliance worked out so well that the alliance decided to 
certify wireless LAN hardware after the IEEE 802.11i amendment was released. This new 
certifi cation, known as Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA 2.0), is a post-802.11i certifi cation. 
Like WPA, WPA 2.0 addresses two options for wireless LAN security: personal mode and 
enterprise mode. This certifi cation addresses more advanced security solutions and is back-
ward compatible with WPA. The following is a preview of its key points; we will look at 
both WPA and WPA 2.0 in more detail in Chapter 16. 
 
■
The personal mode security mechanism uses a passphrase for authentication, which 
is intended for SOHO and personal use. The use of a passphrase to generate a 256-bit 
pre-shared key (PSK) provides strong security. Personal mode may also be identified as 
pre-shared key. 
 
■
The enterprise mode security mechanism uses 802.1X/EAP for user-based authen-
tication, which is port-based authentication and is designed for enterprise imple-
mentations. 802.1X/EAP provides strong security using external authentication and 
Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP). 802.1X/EAP uses an authentication server 
for the user authentication. Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) 
is a common authentication server. This works well as a replacement for legacy IEEE 
802.11 security solutions.

Wi-Fi Protected Setup Certification
Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) was defi ned because SOHO users wanted a simple way to 
provide the best security possible for their installations without the need for extensive tech-
nical knowledge of wireless networking. Wi-Fi Protected Setup provides strong out-of-the-
box setup adequate for many SOHO implementations.
The Wi-Fi Protected Setup certifi cation requires support for two types of authentication 
that enable users to automatically confi gure network names and strong WPA2 data 
encryption and authentication:
 
■
Push-button configuration (PBC) allows for quick setup for consumer-grade Wi-Fi 
equipment. Typically a hardware button on the router is pushed and within two min-
utes a software “button” on the client device is pushed. The intent is to provide easy, 
secure setup for the home wireless network.
 
■
PIN-based configuration is based on a personal identification number. It is similar to 
PBC, but with this method a PIN is entered on all devices that you wish to connect 
together on the same wireless network. 
Support for both PIN and PBC confi gurations are required for access points; 
client devices at a minimum must support PIN. A third, optional method, near fi eld 

Interoperability Certifications 
165
communication (NFC) tokens, is also supported. With NFC, if the client device is within 
a very close proximity to the wireless access point, it will allow for radio communications. 
NFC will also allow for the exchange of information such as photos or contacts between 
mobile devices in a peer-to-peer or ad hoc environment. NFC evolved from radio-frequency 
identifi cation (RFID) technology that provided radio communications using either passive 
or active tags.
In December 2011, a security flaw was reported with WPS. This allegedly 
allowed an intruder to recover the personal identification number (PIN) 
used to create the 256-bit pre-shared key. Acquiring the PIN would allow 
access to the wireless network. Wherever possible, it is recommended that 
users disable certain features in the wireless router or access point that 
allow this to happen. A firmware update may also be available to provide 
adequate protection. Keep in mind that this solution to the issue may be 
possible only with newer-model wireless routers. You should check with 
the manufacturer to determine if a solution (either a software setting or 
firmware upgrade) is available for a specific device. Otherwise, consider a 
different method, such as WPA or WPA 2.0, to secure the wireless router. 
Upgrading to a newer wireless router is another possible solution.
Wi-Fi Multimedia Certification
The Wi-Fi Multimedia (WMM) certifi cation was designed as a proactive certifi cation for 
the IEEE 802.11e amendment to the 802.11 standard. The 802.11e amendment addresses 
QoS in wireless LANs. The WMM certifi cation verifi es the validity of features of the 
802.11e amendment and allows for a vendor-neutral approach to quality of service.
Quality of service is needed to ensure delivery of information for time-sensitive, time-
bounded applications such as voice and streaming video. If a wireless network user were to 
send a fi le to a printer or save a fi le to a server, it is unlikely they would notice any minor 
delay, or latency. However, in an application that is tuned to human senses such as hearing 
or eyesight, latency would more likely be noticeable. 
Wi-Fi Multimedia Power Save Certification
Wi-Fi Multimedia Power Save (WMM-PS) is designed for mobile devices and specifi c uses 
of wireless LAN technology that require advanced power-save mechanisms for extended 
battery life. Here are some of these devices and technology that benefi t from WMM-PS:
 
■
Voice over IP (VoIP) phones
 
■
Notebook computers
 
■
Tablet devices
Power-save mechanisms allow devices to conserve battery power by “dozing” for short 
periods of time. Depending on the application, performance could suffer to some degree 

166 
Chapter 4 ■ Standards and Certifications for Wireless Technology
with power-save features enabled. WMM-PS consumes less power by allowing devices to 
spend more time in a “dozing” state—an improvement over legacy power save mode that at 
the same time improves performance by minimizing transmission latency.
The Wi-Fi Voice-Enterprise Certification
The Wi-Fi Voice-Enterprise certifi cation is designed to provide certifi cation for IEEE 
802.11 wireless LAN client and infrastructure devices used for voice applications in a 
variety of enterprise deployment types. These include carpeted offi ce deployments, educa-
tional institution deployments, industrial deployments, healthcare deployments, and similar 
deployments. These deployment types are discussed later in this chapter. The Wi-Fi Voice-
Enterprise certifi cation is based on protocol adherence for three amendments to the IEEE 
802.11 standard:
 
■
IEEE 802.11k—Radio resource measurement
 
■
IEEE 802.11r—Fast BSS transition
 
■
IEEE 802.11v—Wireless network management
The performance metrics testing includes latency, jitter, and packet loss. The Wi-Fi 
Alliance released this certifi cation in 2012. 
Common IEEE 802.11 Deployment 
Scenarios
The availability and technology enhancements of IEEE 802.11 wireless networking have 
increased while the cost continues to decrease, making wireless LANs a viable solution for 
many business models, including personal use, home offi ces, small offi ces, and enterprise 
organizations. In the following sections, we’ll look at various scenarios in which this type 
of wireless networking is used. We’ll explore the following common deployment scenarios 
that utilize wireless local area networks (WLANs):
 
■
Small office, home office (SOHO)
 
■
Enterprise deployments: corporate data access and end-user mobility
 
■
Extension of existing networks into remote locations

Small Office, Home Office
Many small offi ce, home offi ce (SOHO) businesses have the same needs as those of larger 
businesses with regard to technology, computer networking, and communication. These 
common needs, regardless of network size, include access to a common infrastructure 
for resources such as computer data (fi les), printers, databases, other networks, and the 
Internet. Computer networking technology is common regardless of the size of the busi-
ness. Whether there are one or 100 employees, many are categorized as small businesses. 
Wireless LANs now play a major role in small businesses. Many small business locations 
have a high-speed Internet connection such as digital subscriber line (DSL) or cable modem 
for access outside the local area network.
With the number of work-at-home professionals continuing to grow at a very high rate, 
the need for wireless networking in this environment is also continuing to grow. The same 
goes for the small offi ce environment. Deployments such as these typically involve a smaller 
number of users. Therefore, the equipment used may be consumer models sold in consumer 
electronics department stores and online retailers.
In addition, many companies and organizations now allow for employees to work 
remotely part or full time. In these cases, the company network is now extended to the 
remote location, which, whether it is a home offi ce or other location, may be considered a 
branch offi ce of the company’s corporate network. When wireless LAN technology is used 
at a remote location, new concerns arise, such as data security and network availability. 
Depending on the size of the small offi ce or home offi ce and the number of potential 
users and devices, a WLAN RF site survey may be required. A site survey will help deter-
mine areas of radio frequency (RF) coverage and interference as well as the number and 
placement of access points. Even if the small offi ce or home offi ce will require only a single 
access point, it is still benefi cial to know if there are other wireless networks or devices in 
the same coverage area that may cause radio frequency interference.

Enterprise Deployments: Corporate Data Access and 
End-User Mobility
Enterprise organizations have used wired local area networking technology for decades. 
With the increased need for mobility, wireless LANs within enterprise organizations have 
also increased in popularity. In earlier years, due to lack of interoperability and security 
features, many enterprise organizations limited wireless LAN deployments to extensions 
of networks where wired connectivity was either not feasible or too costly. Because of 
advancements in wireless LAN technology over the recent years, IEEE 802.11 deployments 
in enterprise organizations are continuing to grow at a rapid pace.
Wireless LANs in the enterprise are used with—but not limited to—client workstation 
connectivity (desktop, notebook, and tablet devices), printers, barcode scanners, voice 
handsets, and location services. The cost of this technology has decreased, whereas capa-
bilities, performance, speed, and security have increased, making wireless an attractive 
solution for many enterprise organizations. The cost savings over hardwired solutions such 
as Ethernet are enormous, adding to the attractiveness of this option. Finally, wireless con-
nectivity is the only option in some cases, such as mobile Voice over Wi-Fi handsets for 
voice communications.
Figure 4.6 shows a fl oor plan of an offi ce area that may include a wireless deployment. 
Each individual or shared offi ce would contain one or two networked desktop comput-
ers and phones, and many would also have laptops. Printers might be placed in centrally 
located common areas accessible to the individuals who have permissions to use them. The 
conference room might contain a videoconferencing system and an access point depending 
on the number of available seats, and the reception area might have wireless guest access 
for vendors or other visitors not belonging to the company or organization. Connecting all

these networked devices to each other and the outside world are the wireless access point 
and other WLAN infrastructure devices discussed in Chapter 6, “Computer Network 
Infrastructure Devices.” They will be located throughout the facility based on the wireless 
network design to provide coverage and capacity for all wireless devices.

Extension of Existing Networks into Remote Locations
In its early days, wireless networking technology was typically deployed as an extension 
of an existing wired network infrastructure. For example, some users who required access 
to the computer network were farther than the physical limit of 100 meters that the IEEE 
802.3 Ethernet standard allows for a copper-wired connection, so other solutions were 
needed to provide this connectivity. Other wired technology, such as fi ber optics and leased 
lines, was sometimes cost prohibitive or not logistically feasible. Wireless local area 
networks were an excellent alternative.
Now, IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs are a major part of almost every network, including 
home, corporate, and branch/remote locations. Remote network locations may include the 
SOHO locations, branch offi ce locations, public wireless hotspots, and wireless Internet 
service providers (WISPs). When a user connects to a corporate offi ce network from any 
of these scenarios, the network is basically being extended to a remote location. This 
extension should be treated as such with regard to network, security, availability, and 
performance. 
Public Wireless Hotspots
Portability and mobility are major benefi ts of wireless networking. Portability allows 
users to access information from a variety of locations, either public or private. Mobility 
allows the continuous connection to a wireless network while a device is on the move. One 
example of portability is the wireless hotspot. In today’s world, it is rare to visit any public 

170 
Chapter 4 ■ Standards and Certifications for Wireless Technology
location, whether a restaurant, hotel, coffee shop, or airport, and not be able to fi nd a 
public wireless hotspot.
A wireless hotspot is defi ned as a location that offers wireless network connectivity for 
free or as for-profi t public or patron services. It allows a variety of mobile devices (comput-
ers, tablets, smartphones, and so on) to connect to and access public Internet and private 
network resources. Many users work from remote locations and require Internet access as 
part of their job. This can include access from a wireless hotspot.
A typical wireless hotspot will be confi gured with at least one wireless LAN router con-
nected to an ISP. In some cases, this setup could be as simple as a location offering free 
Wi-Fi Internet access for its customers. More sophisticated hotspots will have several wire-
less access points or a complete wireless infrastructure and will be connected to a remote 
billing server that is responsible for collecting revenue from the user.
In many cases, when a user connects to the hotspot router, they will be prompted with a 
web page for authentication. At this point they might be asked to enter information such as 
an account number, username and password, or a credit card number to allow usage for a 
limited period of time. In the case of a free hotspot, typically this web page lists terms and 
conditions the user agrees to prior to accessing the Internet. This type of web page confi gu-
ration is known as a captive portal. Captive portals are discussed in more detail in Chapter 
10, “Introduction to Mobile Device Management.” 
Wireless hotspots can raise security concerns for the user. Without a secure connection, 
all information is passed in cleartext through the air via radio frequency, potentially allow-
ing an intruder to capture usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, or other informa-
tion that could lead to identity theft. Most hotspots do not have the capability to provide 
a secure wireless connection from the user’s computer or wireless device to the wireless 
router or network. The secure connection then becomes the responsibility of the user. Since 
many corporations allow employees to work remotely from wireless hotspot connections, 
extra security measures need to be explored and implemented. In this case, usually a virtual 
private network (VPN) is used to ensure security. A VPN creates a secure tunnel between 
the user and the corporate network, allowing for a secure encrypted connection for the user 
from the wireless hotspot to their corporate network over the Internet or public network. 
For users who connect to wireless hotspots, it is important for their wireless devices to 
be secured with the appropriate antivirus software, fi rewall software, and up-to-date oper-
ating system patches or service packs. Following these guidelines can help protect the user 
from attacks when they are connected to and using a wireless hotspot. 
Figure 4.7 shows a simple wireless hotspot implementation.
Carpeted Office Deployments
Computer networking in traditional offi ce space, or “carpeted offi ces,” now relies on 
wireless technology to a large extent. This is for several reasons:

Corporate Network
Many offi ces have an existing wired network infrastructure, which is not likely to go 
away anytime soon. In most cases copper wire for Ethernet connectivity is already in place 
and is adequate for the intended use. However, the cost to upgrade the copper wiring or 
install new wired network drops can be expensive. Therefore, wireless LAN technology is 
an attractive alternative to wired networks in many offi ce deployment scenarios. We are 
now seeing a new era of wireless networks by default and wired networks only as needed 
based on the type of devices connected such as wired and wireless infrastructure devices. 
These include, servers, printers, wireless access points and others. Depending on the use of 
the network—that is, the types of software applications and the number of devices requir-
ing connectivity—wireless may be the best solution simply because of the cost.
Without trying to set fi rm limits, it is common to connect as many as 20 to 25 users/
devices to a single wireless access point. However, the maximum size depends on the soft-
ware applications and the number of devices connected. A major benefi t of IEEE 802.11 
wireless LAN technology is that an access point will require only a single Ethernet drop 
to support all the devices or users. Of course, don’t forget that an access point is part of a 
shared medium for everything that connects and performance and throughput can be an 
issue if proper design practices are not used.
It is important to understand the difference between portability and mobility. Portability 
allows users to access information from a variety of set locations, and mobility allows a 
continuous connection to a wireless network while the device is moving. In carpeted space 
offi ces, there may be a need to provide support for both portability and mobility. 
For the user who moves from an offi ce cubicle to a conference room to attend a meeting, 
portability will be suffi cient. In this situation they will probably shut down their mobile 

172 
Chapter 4 ■ Standards and Certifications for Wireless Technology
device, such as a laptop computer, and carry it to a conference room for the meeting. 
Restarting the computer will then require the device to reconnect to the wireless network, 
hence portability.
Devices such as mobile phones using Voice over IP (VoIP) or tablet devices usually 
require continuous connectivity to the wireless network while the user/device is in motion. 
This mobility feature allows uninterrupted communications and a pleasant experience for 
the user. 
Both portability and mobility provide the convenience network that people desire.

Common IEEE 802.11 Deployment Scenarios 
173
Educational Institution Deployments
Educational institutions can benefi t from wireless networking in many ways. Wireless 
LAN deployments are common in both public and private elementary and high schools. 
Universities deploy campus-wide wireless LANs with thousands of access points servicing 
tens of thousands of users on a single campus.
Wireless LAN technology allows for increased mobility in the educational environment, 
providing huge cost savings when technology needs to be refreshed. Mobile carts with note-
book computers are one example. A high school can deploy wireless infrastructure devices 
such as access points in classrooms and purchase several mobile carts with notebook or 
tablet computers to be used when and where needed. This is benefi cial in terms of cost 
savings because all classrooms won’t need to be supplied with computers or devices when 
continuous need for them may be low. 
Some school buildings may be older or historic buildings in which installing cabling is 
impossible or cost prohibitive. Wireless provides the solution. The architecture of many 
school buildings may also pose concerns that need to be addressed with many wireless 
network deployments. Among the concerns are building materials, such as these:
 
■
Brick and concrete walls
 
■
Lath and plaster walls
 
■
Inconsistent materials due to building additions
These materials can cause issues because, depending on their density and composition, 
the radio frequency may not propagate well. There is thus the potential for additional wire-
less access points and extra design considerations.
In addition, there may be modular or temporary classrooms; the issue with these is the 
density of devices and users, which will affect the wireless network capacity and may result 
in performance issues. Also, the location and distance from the main building should be 
taken into consideration because it may be necessary to install a point-to-multipoint 
connection and line of sight needs be taken into account.
Some educational institutions are implementing a “one-to-one” initiative—in other 
words, the goal is to have one Internet-accessible device for every one student. This type of 
initiative will introduce density concerns because of the potentially high number of students 
in a single classroom. Educational institutions, whether elementary schools, high schools, 
or college campuses, should always consider starting with an RF wireless site survey and 
follow best practices from the equipment manufacturer to ensure a successful deployment. 
Figure 4.9 shows a typical small school environment.
Industrial Deployments
Some industrial organizations have been using wireless LAN technology for many 
years, even prior to the development solutions based on IEEE 802.11 wireless standards. 
Examples of these deployments include bar code and scanning solutions for manufactur-
ing, warehousing, inventory, and retail. Although this type of deployment may not be 

174 
Chapter 4 ■ Standards and Certifications for Wireless Technology
very dense, coverage is important. Many businesses of this type include the following 
characteristics:
 
■
High ceilings
 
■
Tall storage racks
 
■
Large inventory of product

Forklifts

These characteristics can cause issues with wireless networks because of the way radio 
frequency propagates. With high ceilings, various antennas will need to be tested and 
coverage will need to be verifi ed throughout the facility. Tall storage racks may have vary-
ing levels of inventory or product, resulting in poor propagation. Depending on what the 
products are made of, this will have a direct impact on the radio frequency behavior. For 
example, a high density of water products or paper products will absorb radio frequency. 
In many cases, forklifts will be outfi tted with wireless bar code scanners or other mobile 
devices that require fast and secure transition capabilities.
In this type of environment, it is important to understand that radio frequency will 
behave in ways that could impact the performance of the wireless network. The behaviors 
of radio frequency are discussed in Chapter 3. These behaviors can lead to coverage issues 
for the devices in use. Careful evaluation of this type of environment is essential, and an RF 
site survey is highly recommended to ensure proper RF coverage.

Common IEEE 802.11 Deployment Scenarios 
175
The physical characteristics of this type of environment are fairly static, although racks 
or shelving may occasionally be added. However, product inventory is dynamic and may 
change constantly. Moreover, forklifts and other product-moving equipment are constantly 
moving and in different locations. These are some of the factors that must be taken into 
consideration when deploying wireless networking in an industrial environment.

Healthcare Deployments
The growth of wireless LAN deployments in the healthcare industry is quite impressive. 
Today, healthcare is one of the fastest-growing sectors of the US economy. Healthcare 
environments pose many challenges for the design, deployment, and support of wireless 
networking.
Hospitals in most cases run nonstop 365 days a year. Wireless LANs have numerous 
applications in hospitals, including these:
 
■
Patient registration
 
■
Patient charting
 
■
Prescription automation
 
■
Treatment verification
 
■
Inventory tracking
 
■
Electronic medical records

Electronic imaging
One of the obstacles to take into consideration for wireless networking is interference. 
Hospitals use many devices that operate in the unlicensed ISM RF band. This can create 
challenges for design and reliability of the wireless network. You should also be aware of 
these other potential issues for healthcare environment deployments:
 
■
Building materials that can hinder RF propagation, such as lead-lined walls used in 
radiology areas to protect people from X-rays
 
■
Identical floor layouts above and below, which leads to stacking access point issues
 
■
Limited accessibility to areas such as surgery and patient care rooms
 
■
Aesthetics of the installed equipment
Compliance with legislation such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability 
Act of 1996 (HIPAA) also needs to be taken into consideration when designing wireless 
installations for healthcare institutions.

Last-Mile Data Delivery: Wireless ISP
Last-mile data delivery is a term commonly used in telecommunications to describe the 
connection from a provider to an endpoint such as a home or business. (Last-mile does not 
necessarily indicate a mile in distance.) This can be a costly solution in many applications 
because each endpoint needs a separate physical connection. Wireless technology provides a 
more cost-effective solution for last-mile data delivery.
Some communication technologies, such as DSL, have physical limitations that prohibit 
connections in some cases. It may not be cost effective for telecommunication service pro-
viders to supply connections in rural or semirural areas. Wireless LANs can service areas 
that may not be part of a last-mile run. Providing Internet access from a wireless ISP is one 
application. Things to consider for feasibility are line of sight, obstacles, and RF interfer-
ence. Figure 4.12 shows an example of wireless last-mile data delivery.

Wireless ISP
In December 2009, the 802.11 task group TGaf was formed to defi ne the 802.11af 
amendment (not to be confused with IEEE 802.3af for Power over Ethernet). This amend-
ment to the 802.11 standard addresses the use of TV white space frequency bands for use 
with wireless networking technology. These lower frequencies propagate well over longer 
distances and may be ideal to provide Internet connectivity for rural or semirural areas as 
well as other types of wireless technology innovation.
High-Density Deployments
What does the term high-density Wi-Fi deployment really mean? People have differing 
opinions because it can be subjective. Some industry experts claim that in the next few 
years the number of installed wireless devices will exceed the number of installed wired 
devices. When you think about it, this projection may be realistic. Take a moment and 
count the number of wireless devices that you have in your possession, at your home, the 

178

classroom, and the offi ce. This includes notebook computers, smartphones, tablets, and 
broadband Internet devices. The average person may have between one and fi ve separate 
wireless devices, many of which include IEEE 802.11 wireless technology. This gives you an 
idea of how the density of wireless LAN devices in all environments—home, offi ce, 
education, and industrial—will continue to increase in the coming years.
Some high-density deployments have already been discussed in this chapter, includ-
ing educational institutions and healthcare deployments such as in hospital environments. 
Issues to consider in this type of environment are the frequency band to use, co-channel 
interference, cell sizing, and access point capacity.
Municipal, Law Enforcement, and Transportation 
Networks
Wireless LANs are valuable in the industrial, municipal, and law enforcement fi elds and in 
transportation networks.
Federal and local law enforcement agencies frequently maintain state-of-the-art tech-
nology utilizing computer forensics and wireless LAN technology. Technologies that use 
19.2 Kbps connectivity are becoming obsolete because of their slower data transfer rates. 
Municipal deployments that include police, fi re, utilities, and city or town services are often 
all connected to a common wireless LAN.
Transportation networks are no exception. Wireless LAN installations are becoming 
more common in places like commuter buses, trains, airplanes, and automobiles. Users can 
connect for free or by paying a nominal fee. This type of connectivity now allows a user to 
better employ idle time. This is especially helpful to the mobile user or “road warrior” who 
needs to make the best use of available time.
Building-to-Building Connectivity Using 
Wireless LAN Technology
Connecting two or more wired LANs together over some distance is often necessary in 
computer networking. Depending on the topology, this can be an expensive and time-con-
suming task. Wireless LAN technology is often used as an alternative to copper cable, fi ber 
optics, or leased line connectivity between buildings. When connecting two or more loca-
tions, point-to-point or point-to-multipoint links can be a quick and cost-effective solution 
for building-to-building connectivity.
When at least two wired LANs are connected, it’s known as a point-to-point connec-
tion. Wireless point-to-point connections can provide long-range coverage depending on 
terrain and other local conditions. These links can serve both wired and wireless users on 
the connected local area networks. Wireless point-to-point connections typically call for 
semidirectional or highly directional antennas. Correct antenna selection is important and 

Building-to-Building Connectivity Using Wireless LAN Technology

will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 3. Figure 4.13 shows a wireless point-to-point 
connection.
With some regulatory agencies, when an omnidirectional antenna is used 
in a point-to-point configuration, it is automatically considered a point-to-
multipoint connection.

A network connecting more than two LANs is known as a point-to-multipoint connec-
tion. With wireless networking, this confi guration usually consists of one omnidirectional 
antenna and multiple semi- or highly directional antennas (see Figure 4.14). Point-to-
multipoint connections are often used in campus-style deployments where connections to 
multiple buildings or locations may be required.

Wireless point-to-point and point-to-multipoint connections are becoming more com-
mon with many IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN deployments, thanks to the low cost of the 
equipment and the ease of installation. The installation time for a wireless point-to-point 
connection can be as little as a few hours.

180 
Chapter 4 ■ Standards and Certifications for Wireless Technology
As this section demonstrates, antenna selection plays an important role in this type of 
connectivity. Other factors to consider in point-to-point or point-to-multipoint connections 
are the radio frequency band used and the distance between antennas, both of which will 
determine whether a link is feasible for a wireless connection. 
Summary
The IEEE is an organization that creates standards and amendments used for wireless com-
munication technologies. This chapter described the released communication standards for 
wireless LANs, wireless PANs, and wireless MANs.
Amendments to the IEEE 802.11 standard that addressed quality of service, security, 
fast transition, radio resource management, and management frame protection were also 
discussed. The Wi-Fi Alliance is an organization that addresses interoperability testing for 
equipment manufactured to the IEEE standards. The testing results in a variety of certifi ca-
tions for communication, quality of service, security, and voice enterprise.
We looked at many scenarios in which IEEE wireless LANs are currently used, from 
small offi ce, home offi ce and corporate deployments to last-mile connectivity. The use of 
standards-based wireless deployments continues to grow at a fast pace as new installations 
are implemented or proprietary and legacy-based installations are updated.

models. You will learn about RF channels and the frequen-
cies of the unlicensed radio frequency bands. We will explore spread spectrum and other 
Physical layer (PHY) technologies. We will look at RF signal measurements, including 
received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). You will also 
learn about IEEE 802.11 passive and active scanning as well as the authentication and

consistent connectivity across the wireless network.
This chapter will discuss the differences between data rates and throughput. Finally, we 
will look at IEEE 802.11 protection mechanisms. Some of the topics we will see in this 
chapter have been briefl y touched on in earlier chapters. One of the goals of this chapter is 
to tie the terminology and topics together.
Wireless LAN Operating Frequencies 
and RF Channels
As discussed in Chapter 3, “Radio Frequency and Antenna Technology Fundamentals,” 
RF spectrum is governed by local regulatory agencies. The country where the RF is used 
determines the regulations, such as frequency use and maximum power. Table 5.1 illus-
trates some examples of local RF regulations.

In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is the local regula-
tory agency responsible for regulating licensed and unlicensed radio spectrum. Listed here 
are the unlicensed RF bands available in the United States for use with IEEE 802.11 wire-
less LAN communications:

■
5.470−5.725 GHz: U-NII-2e, upper middle
■
5.725−5.825 GHz: U-NII-3, upper
The 5.725−5.875 GHz ISM band is used in the United States and a few other 
areas for a single IEEE 802.11 channel (channel 165). The IEEE 802.11-2012 
standard states that “the OFDM PHY shall not operate in frequency bands 
not allocated by a regulatory body in its operational region. Regulatory 
requirements for a given frequency band are set by the regulatory author-
ity responsible for spectrum management in a given geographic region 
or domain.” The FCC in the United States allows this frequency for IEEE 
802.11 wireless networking.
The IEEE 802.11 standard addresses the 2.4 GHz ISM band and the 5 GHz U-NII 
bands. The 5 GHz U-NII band consists of four bands utilizing four frequency ranges: 
U-NII-1, the lower band; U-NII-2 and U-NII-2e, the middle bands; and U-NII-3, the upper

Communications Commission (FCC) now allows the use of channel 144 in 
the U.S. based on the ratification of the IEEE 802.11ac amendment which 
increased the number of available channels in the U-NII-2e band from 11 to 12.
Radio Frequency Channels
As you have seen, radio frequency is divided into bands. These bands can be further sepa-
rated into channels. A channel is a smaller allocation of the radio frequency band. 
One familiar application in which this is accomplished is television. Until over-the-air 
television became available in digital format, television was allocated certain frequency 
ranges. Common television channels operated in the very high frequency (VHF) band—for 
example, channels 2 through 13 operated from 54 through 216 MHz. This frequency range 
was divided into 12 channels, allowing optimal use of the frequency range for the applica-
tion, in this case television signals. A viewer can change channels on a television to watch 
different programs running simultaneously. However, only one program can be viewed at 
any one time depending on which channel is currently selected. (Picture-in-picture televi-
sions can show two or more channels at once on the screen, but each picture is still being 
received on a different channel.)
Wireless LANs use channels in the same way. Certain frequency ranges are allocated for 
wireless networking, and those frequency ranges are subdivided into channels. For a trans-
mitter and receiver to communicate with one another, they must be on the same RF chan-
nel. The 2.4 GHz ISM band has a total of 14 channels available for IEEE 802.11 wireless

networking. The locale where they are used will determine which of the 14 channels can be 
legally used for this technology. In the United States, IEEE 802.11b/g/n wireless networks 
use 11 of the 14 channels available in the 2.4 GHz ISM band. Each of these 11 channels for 
DSSS or HR/DSSS is 22 MHz wide, and for OFDM it is 20 MHz wide. Understand that 
these channels are further defi ned by their center frequency; for example, channel 1 in the 
2.4 GHz ISM band has the center frequency at 2.412 GHz. Simple mathematics show there 
will be some overlap in order to accommodate all of the 20 MHz or 22 MHz wide channels 
in this frequency range. Table 5.3 shows the 14 available channels in the 2.4 GHz range 
with examples of which channels are used in certain local regulatory domains.

Of these 14 channels, mathematically there are only three adjacent nonoverlapping 
channels, with the exception of channel 14. According to the IEEE 802.11-2012 standard, 
“channel 14 shall be designated specifi cally for operation in Japan.” Channel 14 is separated 
by 12 MHz on the center frequency from channel 13, whereas channels 1 through 13 are 
separated by 5 MHz on the center frequency of each channel. There are 3 MHz of separa-
tion where the radio frequency of one channel ends and the next adjacent nonoverlapping 
channel begins. For example, channel 1 and channel 6 are adjacent nonoverlapping chan-
nels. Channel 1 ends at 2.423 GHz and channel 6 begins at 2.426 GHz. Mathematically this 
is a separation of 3 MHz. This means that three access points can be colocated in the same 
physical space without experiencing overlapping channel interference. However, there is still 
theoretically a small amount of overlapping RF, or harmonics, between these two channels. 
This small level of overlap is not large enough to cause any real interference issues. Figure 
5.2 illustrates 3 of the fi rst 11 channels that do not overlap in the 2.4 GHz ISM band.

Each DSSS channel is 22 MHz wide. Using spread spectrum technology, a 22 MHz wide 
channel helps add resiliency to interference for data transmissions and gives the capabil-
ity to move large amounts of data with a small amount of power. Some early IEEE 802.11 
devices included bar code scanners, and they worked with limited battery life. Using a 
spreading technology instead of narrowband technology helped to conserve battery life and 
increased the use of IEEE 802.11 devices as a whole.
The 5 GHz U-NII band that is used with IEEE 802.11 wireless networking is divided 
into smaller sections of frequency ranges and then into RF channels. The 5 GHz U-NII 
band consists of four smaller frequency ranges —lower, lower middle, upper middle, and 
upper. Since there are fewer channels in the same amount of frequency space compared to 
the 2.4 GHz ISM band, channels in the U-NII band do not overlap. In the 5 GHz U-NII 
band, channels are 20 MHz wide. Table 5.4 shows the 5 GHz U-NII band for the FCC and 
ETSI locales.

Radio Frequency Range
The range a wireless LAN signal will travel is based on the wavelength or distance of a 
single cycle. The higher the frequency, the shorter the range of the RF signal; the lower the 
frequency, the longer the range of the RF signal. At the same output power level, a 2.4 GHz 
signal will travel almost twice as far as a 5 GHz signal. 
If a wireless network design is going to have dual-band access points, RF range will need 
to be considered to ensure proper coverage for both the 2.4 GHz ISM and 5 GHz U-NII 
bands. A wireless site survey will help determine the usable range an access point will pro-
duce. A survey can involve physically walking around the proposed space and/or predic-
tive modeling using one of many software programs. This process is discussed further in 
Chapter 8, “Site Survey, Capacity Planning and Wireless Design.”

Chapter 5 ■ IEEE 802.11 Terminology and Technology
Wireless LAN Modes of Operation
IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs can be confi gured to operate in different modes for device and 
user access: ad hoc mode and infrastructure mode. These two modes can be broken down 
into four different service set confi gurations:
 
■
Independent basic service set (IBSS)
 
■
Basic service set (BSS)
 
■
Extended service set (ESS)
 
■
Mesh basic service set (MBSS)
The application/deployment scenario for a wireless LAN is the determining factor for 
the best mode to use. 
IBSS confi guration does not require the use of a wireless access point, and unless this 
confi guration is specifi cally justifi ed, it is not used in enterprise wireless LAN deployments. 
In addition, if not properly implemented, the IBSS can introduce security vulnerabilities, 
such as potentially bridging a wired network infrastructure to an unsecured wireless 
network. 
The most common confi guration for an IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN is infrastructure 
mode, which uses at least one access point. Infrastructure mode requires a minimum of 
one access point but can consist of up to thousands. The access points are connected by a 
common medium known as the distribution system. BSS, ESS, and MBSS are all confi gura-
tions that use wireless infrastructure mode and access points. These operation modes are 
discussed in more detail later in this chapter. 
The basic service area (BSA) is the area of radio frequency coverage, or the RF cell that 
encompasses a wireless LAN access point and its associated stations. A wireless client 
device will be contained in the basic service area as long as it has enough required signal 
strength to maintain an association state with the wireless access point.
Three parameters must be set on the wireless devices that wish to participate in a wire-
less LAN:
 
■
The service set identifier (SSID)
 
■
The radio frequency channel
 
■
Security configuration
These parameters must be the same on all the devices in order for them to effectively 
communicate with one another. These wireless LAN confi guration parameters are part of 
every type of wireless LAN installation.
We will now look at each of the confi gurations and the details of how they operate. 
The discussion of parameters will be explored in the greatest detail in the next section, 
“The Independent Basic Service Set (IBSS),” where it is particularly important to under-
stand the issues related to the parameters.

Wireless LAN Modes of Operation 
191
The Independent Basic Service Set (IBSS)
It is important to understand what the independent basic service set (IBSS) is, how it 
works, and its potential uses, advantages, and disadvantages. This wireless LAN operation 
confi guration uses no access points (APs) and consists of only wireless mobile devices or cli-
ent computers. This is the most basic type of IEEE 802.11 service set, consisting of a mini-
mum of two stations (STAs), of which neither is an AP station. Communication occurs only 
among the wireless devices that are part of the same IBSS. Unlike when using an access 
point, this confi guration has no centralized control or manageable security or accounting 
features. Figure 5.3 shows devices in an IBSS.

IBSS Terminology
The wireless LAN industry uses several different terms to identify an IBSS. The term used 
is up to the manufacturer or depends on a specifi c implementation. An IBSS is usually iden-
tifi ed by one of three terms:
 
■
Independent basic service set (IBSS)
 
■
Ad hoc
 
■
Peer-to-peer
Regardless of the terminology used—IBSS, ad hoc, or peer-to-peer—it comes down to 
wireless LAN devices connecting to each other without the use of an access point or other 
wireless infrastructure device connected to a distribution system. All devices in an IBSS 
network work independently of one another, and there is no centralized management or 

192 
Chapter 5 ■ IEEE 802.11 Terminology and Technology
administration capability. This type of connection may be useful in homes or small offi ces 
for ease of installation but is rarely if at all used with enterprise or corporate wireless 
networks.
The Service Set Identifier (SSID)
The service set identifi er (SSID) is a common parameter used in all wireless LAN operation 
confi gurations. The SSID is the logical name of the service set used to easily identify the 
wireless network using wireless network discovery utilities. The SSID is used by wireless 
devices to select a wireless network to join. This is accomplished through processes that are 
known collectively as the discovery phase and include passive and active scanning, both of 
which will be discussed later in this chapter.
In some cases, choosing a name for a wireless network can be a tough decision. 
Organizations that deploy a wireless network may already have a naming convention in 
place for such scenarios. If not, a decision will need to be made regarding the wireless net-
work names (SSIDs) used for access points and other devices to identify the wireless LAN.
Every device that wishes to be part of the same wireless LAN IBSS, BSS, or ESS will use 
a common network name, the SSID. (See Figure 5.4 for an IBSS example.) For infrastruc-
ture devices such as wireless LAN access points, the SSID parameter is manually set on the 
access point. From the client access side, the SSID is a user-confi gurable parameter that can 
be set manually in the wireless client software utility or received automatically from net-
works that broadcast this information element.

Wireless LAN Modes of Operation

The SSID should be unique and should not divulge who you are or the location of the 
wireless LAN devices, unless you are trying to create a wireless hotspot or a publicly acces-
sible IEEE 802.11 wireless network. For example, if a fi ctitious bank by the name of ABC 
Bank used an SSID like ABC_Bank, it would identify exactly where the wireless network is 
and could be a potential security threat because fi nancial institutions are common targets. 
However, it is important to understand if the proper wireless LAN security is enabled, the 
SSID should not be an issue, but there is no point in broadcasting certain types of informa-
tion. Rather than using the bank name in the SSID, consider a unique name that does not 
describe the type of business where it is used or exact location.
The SSID assigned to a wireless LAN service set is case sensitive and must include a 
minimum of one character and a maximum of 32 characters or, as specifi ed in the IEEE 
802.11 standard, 32 octets because an ASCII character consists of 8 bits. An octet is 8 bits 
in length.
SSID Hiding
Most manufacturers of small ofﬁ ce, home ofﬁ ce (SOHO) and enterprise-grade access 
points allow the SSID to be hidden from view for devices attempting to locate a wireless 
network. In this case, a client device would need to know and specify the SSID in the cli-
ent device software utility proﬁ le in order to connect to the network. Even though this 
is not an effective way to secure a wireless network and should not be used to do so, 
it is a practice some choose to use for various reasons, including to prevent unauthor-
ized devices from attempting to access a network in which they do not have the proper 
authority or credentials. Some disadvantages to not broadcasting the SSID are that it may 
cause an increase in transition times in an enterprise deployment, and in a SOHO deploy-
ment, it may cause neighbors to deploy on the same channel that you are using because 
they are unable to see your network. I have also seen wireless devices that are unable to 
connect to the network if the SSID is hidden, even if it is speciﬁ ed in the client device soft-
ware proﬁ le. A network on which SSID hiding is used is also known as a closed network.
Figure 5.5 shows an example of entering the SSID in the Microsoft Windows 7 
AutoConfi g wireless confi guration client utility for an ad hoc network. First you select 
“Set up a wireless ad hoc (computer-to-computer) network” in the Set Up A Connection 
Or Network dialog box; then you enter the SSID on the “Give your network a name and 
choose security options” properties page.

The Radio Frequency Channel
The IBSS wireless network confi guration requires a user to set the specifi c radio frequency 
channel that will be used by all devices that are part of the same IBSS network. This is 
accomplished in the client software utility for the wireless network adapter. Some client 
software utilities set this automatically, in which case the IBSS will use the channel auto-
matically specifi ed. You may also be able to specify the RF channel in the advanced proper-
ties of the wireless network adapter device driver properties.
It is important to understand that all wireless devices in any common IBSS must be com-
municating on the same radio frequency channel. If the client utility does allow a channel 
to be set, the channel chosen is up to the user but based on the local regulatory domain in 
which the network is used. Additional devices wishing to join the IBSS must do so by scan-
ning, either passively or by use of active scanning. Figure 5.6 shows an example of setting 
the RF channel on a notebook computer.

IBSS Security
With IBSS networks, there is no centralized control and no security management features. 
Security is left up to the individual user or wireless client device. If a user inadvertently 
shares a resource, it could expose sensitive information and pose security threats to the 
organization where it is used. This can be a concern for many enterprise installations, and 
therefore the use of an IBSS is against corporate security policy in most enterprise wireless 
deployments.
Advantages and Disadvantages of an IBSS
The advantages and disadvantages of an IBSS network will vary depending on the 
application.
Some of the advantages of IBSS are as follows:
Easy to Configure  To create an IBSS, the user only needs to specify an SSID, set the radio 
frequency channel, and enable the security settings.
No Investment in Wireless Infrastructure Equipment  An IBSS can be created with the 
IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN adapter that is built into the wireless computer or other device. 
No infrastructure device such as an access point is required to connect the wireless LAN 
devices together.

196 
Chapter 5 ■ IEEE 802.11 Terminology and Technology
Here are some disadvantages of IBSS:
Limited Radio Frequency Range  Because radio communications is two-way, all devices 
need to be in a mutual communication range in order to operate effectively. 
No Centralized Administration Capability  In many large or enterprise deployments, IBSS 
connectivity is against corporate security policy because it is impossible to manage such 
networks centrally.
Not Scalable  There is no set maximum number of devices that can be part of an IBSS net-
work, but the capacity of such networks is low compared to other types of networks.
Difficult to Secure  Some computer operating systems have made the setup of an IBSS 
wireless network very easy for any type of user. Users may inadvertently share or allow 
access to sensitive or proprietary information. This security threat is worse if an IBSS user 
is also physically connected to a wired network and provides a bridge from an unsecured or 
unmanaged wireless network to a company’s wired network infrastructure.
A wireless LAN client device such as a notebook computer with the wire-
less networking capabilities configured to be in an IBSS network can be 
a potential security threat if it is also connected to a wired network infra-
structure. It could provide a bridge for unsecured wireless access to the 
company’s wired network. In this configuration, potential intruders would 
have access to information from a corporate network by connecting to the 
unsecured ad hoc network. For this reason, this type of configuration is 
against the corporate security policies of most companies. Many organiza-
tions use wireless intrusion prevention systems to detect and shut down 
wireless IBSS (ad hoc) networks. It is important to inform visitors and con-
tractors who may be physically connected to the company’s infrastructure 
when this type of wireless network is against the corporate security policy 
to prevent potential security issues.
Setting up an IBSS network is similar to setting up a workgroup for a com-
puter operating system such as Microsoft Windows. All devices with the 
same workgroup name will be able to communicate with each other, shar-
ing resources such as files, printers, and so on. Although this configuration 
is against most corporate security policies and not recommended in cor-
porate or enterprise networks, its use may be justified in some instances. 
One such example includes the home or SOHO wireless device market for 
use with streaming video or other multimedia applications that include 
IEEE 802.11ad technology. 
The Basic Service Set (BSS)
The basic service set (BSS) is the foundation of the wireless network. This mode consists of 
an access point connected to a network infrastructure and its associated wireless devices. 

Wireless LAN Modes of Operation 
197
This is considered the foundation because it may be one of many access points that form a 
wireless network. With a BSS setup, each access point is connected to a network infrastruc-
ture, also known as the distribution system (DS), which allows connected wireless LAN 
client devices to access network resources based on the appropriate permissions the wire-
less device or user has access to. The radio frequency area of coverage depends on several 
factors, such as the antenna gain and RF output power settings; this area of RF coverage is 
known as the basic service area (BSA). Any IEEE 802.11 wireless device in radio range and 
part of the BSA with the correct confi guration parameters, including the SSID and secu-
rity settings, will be able to successfully connect to the access point. Figure 5.7 shows an 
example of a BSS.

Access Point
Infrastructure mode consists of a wireless access point connected to a distribution sys-
tem. The BSS consisting of one access point is a common implementation in many homes, 
SOHO, or small to medium businesses (SMBs). The decision to use a single access point 
depends on several factors, among them the size of the location, how the wireless network 
is used, and how many wireless devices will be connected.
Just as in an IBSS confi guration, several parameters must be confi gured for a BSS. These 
include the SSID or name of the network, the radio frequency channel to be used, and any 
security parameters that are set on the BSS. The access point will broadcast these and other 
parameters about the wireless network to devices that want to connect to the BSS, thus 
requiring minimal confi guration on the wireless client side. Unlike the independent basic 

198 
Chapter 5 ■ IEEE 802.11 Terminology and Technology
service set (IBSS), in a BSS the radio frequency channel is confi gured on the access point 
and not on the wireless client devices.
A BSS has many advantages and disadvantages. Some of the advantages are as follows:
 
■
Uses intelligent devices with a large feature set to provide users with consistent, reli-
able, and secure communications to a wireless network.
 
■
Useful in a variety of situations: homes, SOHO, and small to large businesses.
 
■
Very scalable; you can increase the coverage and capacity of a wireless network by add-
ing additional access points.
 
■
Centralized administration and control.
 
■
Security parameters and specific access can be set centrally.
Some of the disadvantages of a BSS are listed here:
 
■
Incurs additional hardware costs compared to IBSS.
 
■
Usually will require a site survey of some type to determine radio frequency coverage 
and capacity requirements.
 
■
Must be connected to a network infrastructure known as the distribution system, 
either wired or wireless.
 
■
Additional knowledge required for configuration and deployment.

The Extended Service Set (ESS)
As stated in the IEEE 802.11-2012 standard, an extended service set (ESS) is defi ned as a 
“set of one or more interconnected basic service sets (BSSs) that appears as a single BSS to 

Wireless LAN Modes of Operation 
199
the logical link control (LLC) layer at any station (STA) associated with one of those BSSs.” 
In basic terms, this can be one or more access points connected to a common distribution 
system. An ESS is a common confi guration in most wireless LAN deployments for small to 
medium businesses as well as large enterprise organizations.
In most cases, an ESS would be used to provide consistent and complete coverage across 
an entire organization. An ESS can be thought of as several basic service sets (BSSs) that 
must have matching parameters, such as SSID and security settings. If the SSIDs of two 
access points do not match, then they are considered separate basic service sets, even 
though they are connected by a common network infrastructure. It is the distribution sys-
tem connecting these together and a common network name (SSID) that makes up the ESS. 
In most cases, the basic service area for each BSS will overlap to allow transition (roaming) 
from one BSS to another. Figure 5.9 shows an example of an extended service set (ESS).

Transitioning (roaming) between access points is a critical component of wireless LAN 
technology in almost every wireless network deployment. This is because the wireless LAN 
is a major part of every corporate computer network. Many envision a complete wireless 
network for all communications, including data, voice, and video, and we are now closer to 
reaching that goal. Transition is so important that the IEEE added the 802.11r amendment 
to the standard to provide a standardized methodology for a fast secure transition within 
the enterprise wireless LAN.

Chapter 5 ■ IEEE 802.11 Terminology and Technology
The Mesh Basic Service Set (MBSS)
The mesh basic service set (MBSS) by defi nition in the IEEE 802.11-2012 standard is a 
basic service set (BSS) that forms a self-contained network of mesh stations (STAs) that use 
the same mesh profi le. An MBSS contains zero or more mesh gates and can be formed from 
mesh STAs that are not in direct communication. In layman’s terms, this is a self-forming 
intelligent network that allows redundant connections to multiple wireless infrastructure 
devices to ensure reliable communications. Mesh networking is not new technology. Mesh 
has been available for years with various computer networking models and continues to 
become a part of many wireless LAN deployment scenarios.
Know Your Abbreviations: SSID vs. ESSID vs. BSSID
It is easy to confuse the abbreviations (acronyms) for several of the wireless LAN terms. 
Here is a summary of the differences of some of these terms.
SSID (Service Set Identiﬁ er)
SSID (service set identiﬁ er) is the network name and provides some segmentation of the 
wireless network.
ESSID (Extended Service Set Identiﬁ er)
Although not deﬁ ned by the IEEE 802.11 standard or amendments, extended service set 
identiﬁ er (ESSID) is a term that some manufacturers use in place of SSID. For the most 
part, ESSID and SSID are synonymous terms for the name or segmentation of a wireless 
network. The term used will vary among manufacturers. The term ESSID was adopted 
by some manufacturers because it implies that more than one access point is using the 
same SSID and security settings connected to a common distribution system.
BSSID (Basic Service Set Identiﬁ er)
It is sometimes easy to confuse the basic service set identiﬁ er (BSSID) with the SSID, or 
the name, of the network. The BSSID is deﬁ ned as the unique identiﬁ er, the Media Access 
Control (MAC) address of the basic service set. It is important to note that some manufac-
turers may allow for several BSSIDs to be connected to a single access point radio or for 
a single common BSSID to be shared among many access points.
The MAC address is the unique identiﬁ er of a network adapter; it is known as the hard-
ware address. The radio in an access point is also for the most part a network adapter. 
The difference between a wired and a wireless network adapter is simply that no Ethernet 
jack is available on a wireless adapter. Instead, a radio is used for Layer 1 communica-
tions.
The MAC address is a 48-bit IEEE 802 format address that uniquely identiﬁ es the network 
interface adapter—or in this case, radio. The format of the BSSID is xx:xx:xx:yy:yy:yy, 

IEEE 802.11 Physical Layer Technology Types 
201
where x is the number assigned to a manufacturer and y is the unique hardware address 
of the device.
Although the BSSID uniquely identiﬁ es the access point’s radio using a MAC address, the 
SSID is broadcast as the name of the network in order to allow devices to connect. There-
fore, the SSID is a logical name mapping to the BSSID. Some devices allow for multiple 
SSIDs, which use multiple BSSIDs for a single radio. This lets a single access point con-
nected to a wired infrastructure provide multiple WLANs using a single radio.
In an ad hoc or IBSS network, there is no access point for centralized communication. 
Instead, wireless LAN devices communicate directly with each other. Because there is no 
access point in this conﬁ guration, the BSSID is a randomly generated number that has the 
same format as the 802 MAC address and is generated by the ﬁ rst ad hoc wireless device 
at startup. Any subsequent wireless devices that join the IBSS will use the BSSID that was 
generated by the wireless station that started the IBSS.
IEEE 802.11 Physical Layer Technology 
Types
In the following sections, you will learn about the different Physical layer (PHY) technolo-
gies used with IEEE 802.11 wireless networking:
 
■
Spread spectrum technology
 
■
Extended rate physical (ERP)
 
■
Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)
The type of PHY technology used will vary based on the communication methods, mod-
ulation type, and several other factors. That will be explained in more detail in the sections 
that follow.
Spread Spectrum Technology
Two types of spread spectrum technology were specifi ed in the original IEEE 802.11 wire-
less LAN standard ratifi ed in 1997:
 
■
Frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS)
 
■
Direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS)
These spread spectrum technologies communicate in the 2.4 GHz ISM frequency range. 
There are advantages and disadvantages to each of these spread spectrum types.
Spread spectrum technologies take the digital information generated by a computer 
(ones and zeros) and, through the use of modulation technologies, send it across the air 
between devices using radio frequency (RF).

202 
Chapter 5 ■ IEEE 802.11 Terminology and Technology
In order for devices to communicate effectively and understand one another, they must 
be using the same spread spectrum and modulation technology. This would be analogous to 
two people trying to talk with each other. If the two people don’t know the same language, 
they will not be able to understand each other and a conversation could not take place.
Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum
Frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) is used in a variety of devices in computer tech-
nology and other communications. FHSS was used by many early adopters of IEEE 802.11 
wireless networking, including with computers, bar code scanners, and other handheld or 
portable devices. Although defi ned in the original IEEE 802.11 standard, this technology is 
considered legacy (out-of-date) technology in IEEE 802.11 wireless networking. However, 
FHSS is still found today in many devices such as cordless telephones and IEEE 802.15 
wireless personal area networks (WPANs), including Bluetooth mice, cameras, phones, 
wireless headsets, and some older wireless LAN technology devices. Bluetooth technology 
using FHSS is comparatively slower than newer IEEE 802.11 wireless communications.
FHSS operates by sending small amounts of information such as digital data across the 
entire 2.4 GHz ISM band. As the name implies, this technology changes the frequency 
(“hops”) constantly in a specifi c sequence or hopping pattern and remains on a frequency 
for a specifi ed amount of time known as the dwell time. The dwell time value will depend 
on the local regulatory domain where the device is used. In the United States, for example, 
the Federal Communications Commission allows a maximum dwell time of 400 millisec-
onds. A transmitter and receiver will be synchronized with the same hopping sequence, 
therefore allowing the devices to communicate.
The data rate for IEEE 802.11 FHSS is only 1 and 2 Mbps, which is considered slow by 
modern computer applications. However, that data rate was more than adequate for some 
applications when the technology became available. For example, various wireless devices 
in retail and manufacturing used FHSS in handheld scanners and other portable technol-
ogy for many years. The cost of upgrading these devices to support higher data rates was 
cost prohibitive and unnecessary in many cases. 
Figure 5.10 illustrates what FHSS would look like if you could see the RF signal hopping 
through the entire 2.4 GHz ISM band.
802.11 Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum
Direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) is spread spectrum technology used with wireless 
LANs and defi ned by the original IEEE 802.11 standard. Like FHSS, DSSS supports data 
rates of 1 and 2 Mbps and is considered to be very slow by today’s computer networking 
requirements.
DSSS uses special techniques to transmit the digital data (ones and zeros) across the air 
using radio frequency (RF). This is accomplished by modulating or modifying the RF char-
acteristics such as phase, amplitude, and frequency (see Chapter 3.)
In addition to modulation, DSSS uses technology known as a spreading code to provide 
redundancy of the digital data as it traverses through the air. The spreading code trans-
mits information on multiple subcarriers, and this redundancy helps the receiver detect 

IEEE 802.11 Physical Layer Technology Types 
203
transmission errors due to radio frequency interference. Subcarriers are smaller segments 
of the radio frequency channel that is in use. The spreading of information across the 22 
MHz wide channel is what helps makes DSSS resilient when it comes to some types of 
interference. This spreading code technology allows the receiver to determine if a single 
bit of digital data (symbol) received is a binary 0 or binary 1. Depending on the data rate, 
the transmitter and receiver understand the spreading code in use and therefore are able to 
communicate.

An example of a coding technique is Barker code. Barker code is used as the spreading 
code for DSSS at the data rates of 1 and 2 Mbps. IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs can use this 
11 “chip” spreading code for communications. Each digital data bit (binary 1 or 0) is com-
bined with a set Barker code through what is called an exclusive OR (XOR) process. XOR 
is a way of combining binary data bits in digital electronics. The result then spreads the 
binary 0 or 1 over a 22 MHz wide channel, helping to make it resilient to radio frequency 
interference. Since both the transmitter and receiver understand the same code, they would 
be able to determine the information that was sent over the air.
A chip is part of a string of binary digits that are used with a Boolean exclu-
sive OR (XOR) process to create an 11-bit symbol and prepare the digital 
data to be sent across the air.
DSSS operates within a range of RF frequency also known as a channel. The channel in 
a wireless LAN is defi ned by its center frequency; that is, channel 1 is 2.412 GHz on cen-
ter, channel 2 is 2.417 GHz on center, and so on. Each channel in the 2.4 GHz ISM band 
is separated by 5 MHz on center with the exception of channel 14, which is 12 MHz on 
center with respect to channel 13. Unlike with narrowband communication, which operates 

204 
Chapter 5 ■ IEEE 802.11 Terminology and Technology
on a single narrow frequency, a DSSS channel is 22 MHz wide and is one of 14 channels in 
the 2.4 GHz to 2.5 GHz ISM band. The country and location of the device will determine 
which of the 14 channels are available for use in that specifi c area.
Figure 5.11 shows that channel 6 is 22 MHz wide for DSSS in the ISM unlicensed RF 
band.
F I G U R E 5 .11  DSSS is limited to a 22 MHz wide channel in the 2.4 GHz ISM band. Each 
channel for DSSS is separated by 5 MHz on the center frequency.

FHSS and DSSS operate in the same frequency range. If devices that use 
both technologies are occupying the same physical area, the devices may 
encounter some level of interference. Therefore, RF interference may 
occur from either IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN devices using the same RF 
channel or non-IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN devices that are using the same 
RF channel. This includes anything wireless that does not use IEEE 802.11 
technology but is operating in the same frequency range, such as 2.4 GHz 
wireless cameras, two-way radios or radio monitors, and even microwave 
ovens.
802.11b High-Rate Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum
High-rate direct sequence spread spectrum (HR/DSSS) is defi ned in the IEEE 802.11b 
amendment to the IEEE 802.11 standard. HR/DSSS (802.11b) introduced higher data 
rates of 5.5 and 11 Mbps. At the time the 802.11b amendment was released, because of 

IEEE 802.11 Physical Layer Technology Types 
205
the higher data rates, this technology helped fuel the acceleration of IEEE standards based 
on wireless LAN technology. The desire for 802.11 wireless LANs grew as the availability 
became greater and the cost decreased.
Like DSSS, HR/DSSS uses one of fourteen 22 MHz wide channels to transmit and 
receive digital computer data. The main difference between these two technologies is that 
HR/DSSS supports higher data rates of 5.5 Mbps and 11 Mbps.
HR/DSSS (802.11b) also uses a different spreading code or encoding technique than 
DSSS. HR/DSSS uses complementary code keying (CCK) for transmitting data at 5.5 and 
11 Mbps. The detailed operation of CCK is beyond the scope of this book.
It is important to note that IEEE 802.11b technology is becoming less rele-
vant in larger wireless networks and many administrators are disabling the 
data rates that support DSSS and HR/DSSS technology due to ERP protec-
tion mechanisms. This is true with both public guest and private networks 
and will help with the overall performance of the wireless network by opti-
mizing the communications for newer technologies.
IEEE 802.11g Extended Rate Physical
The IEEE 802.11g amendment was released in 2003 and introduced technology that 
allowed for higher data rates for devices and operation in the 2.4 GHz ISM band. The 
objective of this amendment was to allow for these higher data rates (up to 54 Mbps) using 
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and still maintain backward compat-
ibility with existing 802.11b technology and devices. This technology, known as extended 
rate physical (ERP), builds on the data rates of 1 and 2 Mbps DSSS (802.11) and 5.5 and 11 
Mbps HR/DSSS (802.11b). The 802.11g amendment addresses several compatibility opera-
tion modes:
 
■
ERP-DSSS/CCK
 
■
ERP-OFDM
 
■
ERP-PBCC (optional) 
 
■
DSSS-OFDM (optional)
The 802.11g amendment required support for ERP-DSSS/CCK and ERP-OFDM. 
This allowed for both the 802.11b data rates of 1, 2, 5.5, and 11 Mbps and the new 
OFDM data rates of 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 54 Mbps with a 20 MHz wide chan-
nel. Manufacturers of wireless LAN equipment implement this in various ways. In a 
graphical user interface, there may be a drop-down menu that allows a user to select a 
specifi c operation mode such as mixed mode, b/g mode, b-only mode, and so on. Another 
possibility is to select the individual data rates using radio buttons. For manufacturers 
that provide a command-line interface (CLI) option, the appropriate commands would 

206 
Chapter 5 ■ IEEE 802.11 Terminology and Technology
need to be executed in order to enable or disable the desired data rates. Packet Binary 
Convolution Code (PBCC) is an optional feature defi ned in the IEEE 802.11g amend-
ment. IEEE 802.11b provided data rates of 1, 2, 5.5, and 11 Mbps. PBCC extended these 
to allow for potential data rates of 22 and 33 Mbps. However, to achieve these extended 
data rates, the technology must be enabled on both the transmitter and the receiver, mak-
ing this more a proprietary feature that was found only in SOHO wireless LAN equip-
ment. Figure 5.12 illustrates an example of how manufacturers may allow a user to select 
the ERP operation mode on an access point.

IEEE 802.11n High Throughput
The IEEE 802.11n amendment was ratifi ed in September 2009. This new high throughput 
(HT) Physical layer (PHY) technology is based on the OFDM (PHY) in Clause 17 (802.11a) 
PHY. 802.11n HT allows extensibility of up to four spatial streams, using a channel width 
of 20 MHz. Also, transmission using one to four spatial streams is defi ned for operation 
in 20/40 MHz channel width mode. This technology is capable of supporting data rates 
up to 600 Mbps using four spatial streams with a 20/40 MHz channel. IEEE 802.11n HT 
provides features that can support a throughput of 100 Mbps and greater. The following 
optional features are included on both the transmitter and receiver sides:
 
■
HT-Greenfield format 
 
■
Short guard interval (GI), 400 ns
 
■
Transmit beamforming (TxBF)
 
■
Space–time block coding (STBC)
The 802.11n amendment allows for operation in both the 2.4 GHz ISM and 5 GHz 
U-NII bands with either 20 MHz or 40 MHz wide channels. Although 40 MHz wide 
channels are allowed in the 2.4 GHz ISM band, best practices recommend against it. Using 
a 40 MHz channel in this band would equate to only a single channel without any channel 
overlap.

IEEE 802.11 Physical Layer Technology Types 
207
It is important to understand the difference between data rate and 
throughput. Data rates are the rates at which a station is capable of 
exchanging information, whereas throughput is the rate at which the infor-
mation is actually moving. Data rate and throughput are compared in more 
detail later in this chapter.
IEEE 802.11a, 802.11g, 802.11n, and 802.11ac Orthogonal 
Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)
OFDM is used by the IEEE 802.11a (OFDM), IEEE 802.11g Extended Rate Physical 
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (ERP-OFDM), IEEE 802.11n High 
Throughput (HT-OFDM), and IEEE 802.11ac Very High Throughput (VHT-OFDM) 
amendments to the IEEE 802.11 standard. OFDM allows for much higher data rate trans-
fers than DSSS and HR/DSSS, up to 54 Mbps for 802.11a and 802.11g, potentially up to 
600 Mbps for 802.11n, and 6.93 Gbps aggregate for 802.11ac. 
Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is a technology designed to trans-
mit many signals simultaneously over one transmission path in a shared medium and is 
used in wireless and other transmission systems. Every signal travels within its own unique 
frequency subcarrier (a separate signal carried on a main RF transmission). 802.11a and 
802.11g OFDM distribute computer data over 52 subcarriers equally spaced apart, and 4 of 
the 52 subcarriers do not carry data and are used as pilot channels. 802.11n allows for 56 
subcarriers, of which 52 are usable for data with a 20 MHz wide channel, and 114 subcar-
riers, of which 108 are usable for data with a 40 MHz wide channel. Having many subcar-
riers allows for high data rates in wireless LAN IEEE 802.11a and IEEE 802.11g devices. 
802.11n devices (HT-OFDM) may use a MIMO technology known as spatial multiplexing 
(SM), which uses several radio chains to transmit different pieces of the same information 
simultaneously, greatly increasing throughput. In addition to high data rates, OFDM helps 
provide resiliency to interference from other wireless devices.
IEEE 802.11a, 802.11g, 802.11n, and 802.11ac OFDM 
Channels
OFDM functions in either the 2.4 GHz ISM or the 5 GHz U-NII band. The channel width 
is smaller than with DSSS or HR/DSSS. The width of an OFDM channel is only 20 MHz 
compared to 22 MHz for DSSS. Figure 5.13 shows a representation of a 20 MHz wide 
OFDM channel.
Like DSSS, when OFDM is used in the 2.4 GHz ISM band, there are only three non-
overlapping adjacent channels for use. This will limit the use of bonded channels (20/40 
MHz wide channels) in IEEE 802.11n (HT-OFDM) deployments that are located in the 
same radio frequency physical area. In the 5 GHz U-NII bands, the channel spacing is such 
that there is no overlap. The frequency range used will determine how many nonoverlap-
ping channels are available for use. In the lower and upper U-NII bands, 4 nonoverlapping 

208 
Chapter 5 ■ IEEE 802.11 Terminology and Technology
channels are available. The middle U-NII band has 15 nonoverlapping channels available. 
All U-NII band channels are 20 MHz wide and separated by 20 MHz from the center fre-
quencies of each channel. Certain regulatory domains, including the United States Federal 
Communication Commission (FCC) and the European Telecommunications Standards 
Institute (ETSI), require the use of dynamic frequency selection (DFS) support for wireless 
devices such as access points that operate in the middle 5 GHz (5.250–5.725 GHz) U-NII 
band. DFS will allow an access point to change the radio frequency channel it is operating 
on in order to avoid interfering with certain types of radar systems. Table 5.5 shows the 23 
available channels, center frequency, and channel number in the 5 GHz U-NII band. Also 
displayed is a single 5 GHz ISM channel that is available from some regulatory agencies for 
use with wireless networking.

The 5 GHz channel numbers may vary based on the IEEE 802.11 technology 
standard in use such as IEEE 802.11n or IEEE 802.11ac. The channel width 
will also vary. For example 20 MHz, 40 MHz, 80 MHz and 160 MHz wide 
chanels may be used with IEEE 802.11ac technology vs. 20 MHz and 40 MHz 
channels used with IEEE 802.11n technology. The Federal Communications 
Commission (FCC) now allows the use of channel 144 in the U.S. based on 
the ratification of the IEEE 802.11ac amendment.

210 
Chapter 5 ■ IEEE 802.11 Terminology and Technology
Wireless LAN Coverage and Capacity
Coverage and capacity are two key factors to take into consideration when designing and 
implementing an IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN. During the design phase of an IEEE 802.3 
wired network, the design engineer will take capacity into account, verifying and validat-
ing that there are enough capacity switches, ports, required infrastructure speeds, and so 
on for the user base of the network. The same is true for a wireless network. The num-
ber of devices/users connected to an access point is something that needs to be carefully 
considered. The fact that wireless networks use a shared medium is an issue because the 
more devices connected to an access point, the lower the performance may be, depending 
on what the devices are doing. This capacity consideration will ensure satisfi ed end users 
and excellent network performance—proof of a successful wireless network design and 
deployment.
In wireless networks, coverage also needs to be considered. Coverage is determined by 
the RF cell size. In IEEE 802.11 wireless networks, a cell is the area of RF coverage of the 
transmitter, in most cases an access point. Depending on implementation, wide coverage or 
large cell size may not be the best solution. A large space covered by a single access point 
could result in less than adequate network performance based on factors such as the users’ 
distance from the access point. The farther away from an access point, the less throughput 
a device or user will experience. If users will be scattered throughout a large space, it may 
be best to have several access points covering the space to allow for optimal performance.
The term cell has several different meanings depending on the context. In 
the world of IEEE 802.11 wireless networks, a cell is the radio coverage area 
for a transmitter such as an access point or a client device.
Wireless LAN Coverage
The term coverage has different meanings depending on the context in which it used. For 
example, if you buy a gallon of paint, the label will specify the approximate coverage area 
in square feet. If one gallon of paint covers 300 square feet and the room you wish to paint 
is 900 square feet, simple math shows at least three gallons of paint would be needed to 
effectively cover the room.
The concept is similar in IEEE 802.11 wireless networking. However, unlike with paint, 
there is no simple rule that determines how much space an access point will cover with the 
RF energy it is transmitting. This coverage will depend on many factors, some of which are 
listed here:
 
■
Physical size of the area
 
■
Bandwidth-intensive software applications or hardware applications in use that may 
negatively impact the performance, therefore requiring smaller RF coverage cells

Wireless LAN Coverage and Capacity 
211
 
■
Obstacles, including building materials and propagation (the way radio waves spread 
through an area)
 
■
Radio frequency range
 
■
WLAN hardware in use (affects coverage because higher frequencies, such as 5 GHz, 
do not travel as far as lower frequencies, such as 2.4 GHz)
 
■
Transmitter output power
You might initially assume that you want the RF signal to propagate over the largest 
area possible. But this may not be the best solution. A very large cell may allow too many 
devices to connect to a single access point, causing a decrease in overall performance. For 
those client devices connected at a greater distance, the performance will be lower than for 
stations closer to the access point. Figure 5.14 shows a large coverage area, approximately 
11,250 square feet (1,046 square miles) covered with a single access point. This is an exam-
ple of an area that’s too large for a single access point.
F I G U R E 5 .14  Wide coverage with only a single access point is not recommended.

will have lower performance.
Physical Size of the Area
Rarely, if at all, will a manufacturer of enterprise-grade IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN 
hardware commit to the amount of area an access point will cover. There are too many 
variables to take into consideration, which makes it diffi cult to specify an exact number. 
However, some manufacturers may estimate the effective range of the device or access 
point. A site survey of the area will help determine the coverage area of an access point. 

212 
Chapter 5 ■ IEEE 802.11 Terminology and Technology
A manual survey will allow for testing to verify the distance a signal will travel. A predic-
tive site survey will model the environment and determine the signal propagation. This con-
cept will be discussed further in Chapter 8, “Site Survey, Capacity Planning and Wireless 
Design.”
Applications in Use
The application types in use—either software or hardware—can affect the bandwidth of an 
access point. If the devices connected to an access point use bandwidth-intensive applica-
tions such as a computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) appli-
cation, it could result in poor throughput for all devices or users connected to that access 
point. This is another example of where more access points, with each covering a smaller 
area, could be a better solution than a single access point covering a large area. Multiple 
access points could allow the high-bandwidth users to be separated from other parts of the 
network, increasing overall performance of the network.
Obstacles, Building Materials, Propagation, and RF Range
Obstacles in an area (building materials such as walls, doors, windows, and furnishings) as 
well as the physical properties of these obstacles (thickness of the walls and doors, density 
of the windows, and type of furnishings) can also affect coverage. The radio frequency 
used—either 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz—will determine how well a signal will propagate and 
handle an obstacle.
For example, a wall made from sheetrock or drywall materials may have an attenuation 
value of about 3 dB to 4 dB, whereas a wall made of concrete may have an attenuation value 
of about 12 dB. Therefore, the sheetrock wall would have less impact on the RF propaga-
tion than the concrete wall. Partitions, walls, and other obstacles will also determine the 
coverage pattern of an access point because of the way RF behaves as it travels through the 
air. Behaviors of RF were be discussed in Chapter 3 in the section titled “Environmental 
Factors, Including Building Materials.”
WLAN Hardware and Output Power
The wireless LAN hardware in use can also have an impact on the coverage area. Examples 
include the antenna type, antenna orientation, and gain of the antenna. The higher the gain 
of an antenna, the greater the coverage area; conversely, the lower the gain of an antenna, 
the smaller the coverage area. The polarization of an antenna (horizontal vs. vertical) will 
also have an effect on the coverage area because of the different shapes of the electromag-
netic radiation patterns. The output power of the transmitter or access point will also 
have an effect on coverage. The higher the output power, the greater distance a signal will 
propagate. A higher power signal will provide more coverage. Most enterprise-grade access 
points provide the capability to control or adjust the output power.
Wireless LAN Capacity
One defi nition of capacity is the maximum amount that can be received or contained. 
For example, an elevator will typically have a maximum number of people or amount of 

Wireless LAN Coverage and Capacity 
213
weight it can hold; this is usually stated on a panel within the elevator. To ensure safety, the 
elevator may have a safety mechanism to prevent overloading. Likewise, a restaurant has 
a certain number of chairs for customers; therefore, it would have a maximum capacity of 
customers who can be served at any one time. Does this mean that when a restaurant fi lls 
its seats to capacity, the doors close and no other customers can enter the building? Not 
necessarily. In some cases, a restaurant could have customers standing and waiting to be 
seated.
Just as a limited number of people can be accommodated comfortably in an elevator 
or a restaurant, a limited number of devices can be handled by wireless access points, and 
that’s known as capacity. The capacity of an access point is how many devices or users the 
AP can service effectively, offering the best performance based on the available bandwidth. 
Capacity depends on several factors:
 
■
Software and hardware applications in use
 
■
Desired throughput, or performance 
 
■
Number of devices/users
The following sections discuss how these factors affect the capacity of an access point.
What Happens When an Access Point Is Overloaded?
If the capacity of a single access point has exceeded the maximum number of users or 
devices based on the performance metrics, access points may need to be added. If a 
wireless network is installed correctly, an access point will not be overloaded with an 
excessive number of users or devices. An overloaded access point will result in poor per-
formance and therefore unhappy users.
To understand why, look back at the restaurant example. If a restaurant seats 20 custom-
ers and all 20 seats are taken, the restaurant has reached its seating capacity. Let’s say 
the restaurant is short-staffed because two servers did not show up for work. The servers 
who did show up will have to work extra hard to handle the customers. This may cause 
delays in service because the servers need to handle more than their normal number of 
tables. The delays may result in unhappy customers.
The same is true for wireless access points. If a wireless access point has reached its 
capacity (the devices it can handle efﬁ ciently), it could get overloaded. This would result 
in it taking longer to handle any individual request for access. The delays may result in 
unhappy users. Therefore, this situation could justify adding another access point in the 
area to handle the additional users. Just as a restaurant will not close its doors when all 
seats are taken, an access point will continue to accept users trying to connect unless 
restrictions such as load balancing are implemented.

Chapter 5 ■ IEEE 802.11 Terminology and Technology
Software and Hardware Applications in Use
The software and hardware applications in use may affect the capacity of an access point. 
Some applications are more bandwidth intensive than others. For example, word process-
ing applications may not require much bandwidth, but database or CAD/CAM applications 
may require much more than other applications. If high-bandwidth applications are in use, 
the contention among the connected users will increase because they are using a shared 
medium (air and RF). Therefore, performance will potentially be reduced for all users con-
nected to the access point. The access point is providing the same amount of bandwidth, 
but the overall performance has been decreased for the connected users because the soft-
ware applications are all using a lot of bandwidth.
The use of Voice over Wireless LAN (VoWLAN) technology is also increasing steadily 
in many wireless network deployments. This is an example of a hardware application. 
Voice technology on wireless networks is subject to latency. Therefore, the network must be 
carefully planned to take into account the number of voice client devices connecting to an 
access point. Capacity planning and quality of service (QoS) features are important when it 
comes to deploying voice technology on wireless networks.
Desired Throughput or Performance
The desired throughput or performance can also affect capacity. A large number of users 
connected to an access point using a bandwidth-intensive application will cause poor 
performance. Therefore, it may be necessary to limit the capacity to a certain number of 
devices to give the connected users the best performance possible. Any software application 
that is bandwidth intensive, such as CAD/CAM, streaming video, or File Transfer Protocol 
(FTP) downloads, can have an effect on overall performance. One way to help resolve this 
would be to use load balancing to limit the number of users that can connect to an access 
point. Another way would be to create RF cells with smaller coverage and add more access 
points.
Number of Devices/Users
The number of devices or users in an area will also affect the access point capacity. A single 
access point covering a large area will potentially allow for a large number of devices con-
necting to the access point. For example, an offi ce of 8,000 square feet may consist of 100 
people, each with their own wireless device. This is an example of wide coverage and large 
capacity. The software applications in use on the wireless network will have an impact on 
the overall performance. If all 100 devices connected are using a CAD/CAM application, 
which is a bandwidth-intensive application, the overall performance will be poor because 
this type of application requires a lot of resources. Therefore, more access points, each cov-
ering less space and having less capacity, would parlay into better overall performance for 
all of the users.

Wireless LAN Coverage and Capacity 
215
Wide coverage in a densely populated area may allow too many devices to connect to 
a single access point, resulting in poor performance overall. Wireless LANs use what is 
known as a shared medium. In other words, all devices connected to an access point will 
share the available bandwidth. Too many devices using powerful applications will over-
load the access point, adding to the poor performance issues. This scenario is considered 
a capacity issue. In this situation, a better solution would be more access points that each 
cover a smaller area and a lower number of devices, or have less capacity. 
Many organizations now have to deal with the bring your own device (BYOD) situa-
tion, which needs to be evaluated closely. In addition to potential problems with technical 
support and security, wireless LAN capacity is also a major concern. The BYOD expansion 
of devices that are Wi-Fi capable is causing a wireless client device density issue within the 
enterprise market. If a company’s corporate network policy allows employees to bring their 
own wireless-capable devices, then wireless LAN density and capacity need to be carefully 
evaluated to address potential issues.
Radio Frequency Channel Reuse and Device Colocation
The 2.4 GHz ISM band has a total of three nonoverlapping channels. In the US FCC imple-
mentation of this band, the three nonoverlapping channels are 1, 6, and 11. This means 
there must be a separation of fi ve channels in order for them to be considered nonoverlap-
ping. In the 2.4 GHz ISM band, channels are separated by 5 MHz on the center frequency. 
Taking this into consideration, channels must be separated by 25 MHz or greater on the 
center frequency in order to be considered nonoverlapping (IEEE 802.11-2012, Clause 18). 
This is calculated from fi ve channels of separation multiplied by 5 MHz on the center fre-
quency (5 × 5 = 25). With deployments larger than a few access points, a channel plan may 
be necessary. A channel plan will minimize the chance of interference caused by two trans-
mitters (access points) set to the same or adjacent overlapping channels.
IEEE 802.11-2012 Clause 16 (formerly Clause 15 in the IEEE 802.11-1007 
standard) specifies 30 MHz or greater of separation to be considered non-
overlapping: “Adjacent channel rejection is defined between any two chan-
nels with ≥ 30 MHz separation in each channel group defined in 16.4.6.3.” 
Keep in mind that this specification is for 802.11 DSSS. For HR/DSSS (IEEE 
802.11-2012, Clause 18), channels must be separated by 25 MHz or greater 
in order to be considered nonoverlapping.
Figure 5.15 illustrates a 2.4 GHz deployment with no channel planning. Users in the 
areas where the circles overlap will experience co-channel interference. This interference 
will result in lower overall throughput for the connected users because of the Physical layer 

216 
Chapter 5 ■ IEEE 802.11 Terminology and Technology
(PHY) technologies that wireless LANs use. It basically has the same effect as collisions in 
an Ethernet network, resulting in retransmissions of data.
F I G U R E 5 .15  Users of these access points will experience co-channel interference in a 
multichannel architecture because they are all set to the same RF channel.

A correct channel plan will implement channel reuse and ensure that overlapping cells 
will not use overlapping channels. Channel reuse is using nonoverlapping channels—for 
example 1, 6, and 11 in the 2.4 GHz range—in such a way that the overlapping cells are on 
different RF channels. Figure 5.16 shows a 2.4 GHz deployment utilizing proper channel 
reuse. Channel reuse may be accomplished manually by mapping out the access points on 
a fl oor plan and minimizing the chances that the RF cells propagated by the access points 
do not overlap on the same RF channels. Modern enterprise wireless infrastructure devices 
have the capability to manage the RF automatically by selecting the best RF channels to 
operate on. This is done electronically by evaluating the surrounding RF environment. 
Channel planning can de done manually or with the help of wireless site survey software 
applications.

Radio Frequency Signal Measurements

Radio Frequency Signal Measurements
It is important to understand the various signal measurements of radio frequency used in 
wireless LAN technology. Using tools like a wireless adapter client utility or a spectrum 
analyzer will allow you to view different statistics that pertain to a wireless network:
 
■
Receive sensitivity
 
■
Radio frequency noise
 
■
Received signal strength indicator (RSSI)
 
■
Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
Receive Sensitivity
The basic defi nition of receive sensitivity is the measurable amount of radio frequency 
signal usable by a receiver. This is also determined by how much radio frequency noise is 
in the area of the radio receiver. Figure 5.17 shows a wireless adapter client utility that dis-
plays statistics, including the strength of signal received.
F I G U R E 5 .17  The Orinoco 8494-US IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n USB adapter shows the amount 
of signal received.

Radio Frequency Noise
Radio frequency noise is the term for RF signals from sources other than the transmit-
ter and receiver that are in communication. Here is an analogy to help explain. You and 
a guest are in a crowded open-space restaurant for dinner. There are many unrelated 

218 
Chapter 5 ■ IEEE 802.11 Terminology and Technology
conversations occurring at the same time at the various tables throughout the restaurant. If 
you and your dinner guest momentarily paused in your conversation, you would hear these 
other conversations as well as the noise from equipment, telephones, and tables that are 
being cleared. This would be the restaurant equivalent of radio frequency noise, as shown 
in Figure 5.18.

In a wireless LAN environment, several RF devices may be operating in the same physi-
cal space as the wireless transmitter and receiver. Depending on the level of this radio fre-
quency noise, it may be diffi cult for the transmitter and receiver to understand each other. 
In Figure 5.19, a screen capture from a noise analyzer utility shows a wireless basic ser-
vice set on channel 40 in the 5 GHz U-NII-1 band. Also shown is the radio frequency noise 
fl oor of about –95 dBm.
Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)
Received signal strength indicator (RSSI) is an arbitrary number assigned by the radio 
chipset or device manufacturer. There is no standard for this value, and it will not be com-
parable between devices from different manufacturers. The calculation of the RSSI value 
is done in a proprietary manner and a wireless device from one manufacturer may indicate 

Radio Frequency Signal Measurements 
219
different signal strength than that indicated by another, even though they both are receiv-
ing the exact same signal and at the same actual amount of radio frequency power. 
This value is a key determinant of how well the wireless LAN device will perform. How 
the device is used with the network will determine the required levels of signal for optimal 
connectivity. Most wireless client device manufacturers allow their chipsets to access the 
higher data rates as long as they are getting a –70 dBm signal or stronger. Wireless VoIP 
manufacturers recommend deploying so that the client devices can receive a –67 dBm or 
better signal from the access point, a strength that is double the –70 dBm required for 
higher data rate use due to the need for better signaling in QoS communications. Most 
deployments are targeting –67 dBm or better for both data and voice applications.
F I G U R E 5 .19  The MetaGeek Chanalyzer software utility shows a noise floor for the 
tested site of about –95 dBm.
Noise Floor of
about –95 dBm
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is the difference between the amount of received signal and 
the noise fl oor. Looking back at the restaurant analogy, if you were to continue your con-
versation and the tables surrounding yours were all speaking at higher volumes, you might 
not be able to hear your dinner guest very well because of the amount of noise created in 

220 
Chapter 5 ■ IEEE 802.11 Terminology and Technology
the open area of your table. Looking at this from a wireless LAN perspective, if a client 
device records a received signal of −85 dBm and the noise fl oor is −95 dBm, the signal-
to-noise ratio will be 10 dB. This value is calculated by subtracting the received signal 
from the noise, in this case −85 dBm − (−95 dBm) = 10 dB. This would not be an adequate 
signal-to-noise ratio because the receiver would have a diffi cult time determining the dif-
ference between the wanted RF signal and the surrounding RF noise. On the other hand, 
if the received signal is −65 dBm and the noise fl oor is −95 dBm, then the signal-to-noise 
ratio will be 30 dB. This value again is calculated by subtracting the received signal from 
the noise, in this case −65 dBm − (−95 dBm) = 30 dB. This would be an excellent signal-to-
noise ratio because the receiver would easily be able to determine the intended RF signal 
from the surrounding RF noise. Figure 5.20 illustrates the SNR as seen in a spectrum ana-
lyzer tool.

Connecting to an IEEE 802.11 Wireless 
Network
For a device to successfully connect to a wireless network, several different frame 
exchanges must take place. Various frame types allow for specifi c functions to occur. The 
details of the specifi c functions of each of these frame types are beyond the scope of this 

Connecting to an IEEE 802.11 Wireless Network 
221
book, but some of these frames need to be briefl y introduced in order to explain how con-
necting to a wireless network works. After looking at frame types, we will explore wire-
less network discovery, the authentication and association process, reserving the medium, 
exchanging data, and power save functions.
IEEE 802.11 Frame Types
Wireless LAN devices communicate by sending radio frequency waves to each other 
through the air. The RF waves carry the digital data from one wireless device to another. 
At this stage, the information traveling through the air is organized into what are known as 
frames. There are several different types of frames, and the frame types play various roles 
depending on the information being sent. Wireless LANs use three different frame types: 
management frames, control frames, and data frames.
Management Frames
Management frames are used to manage the wireless network. They assist wireless LAN 
devices in fi nding and connecting to a wireless network. This includes advertising the capa-
bilities of the WLAN and allowing connections by the authentication and association pro-
cess. Management frames are exchanged only between immediate wireless devices such as 
an access point and client device and never cross the Data-Link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI 
model. It is important to understand that management frames are always transmitted at 
the lowest mandatory data rate of the service set so that all stations on the same radio fre-
quency channel in the basic service area can understand them. The following are examples 
of management frames:
 
■
Beacon
 
■
Probe request
 
■
Probe response
 
■
Authentication
 
■
Association request
 
■
Association response
Control Frames
Control frames are used to control access to the wireless medium by allowing devices to 
reserve the medium and acknowledge data. In addition, some control frames are used to 
request data from the access point after returning from a power save state and are used 
with IEEE 802.11 protection mechanisms to allow wireless device coexistence. Here are 
some examples of control frames:
 
■
RTS
 
■
CTS

Chapter 5 ■ IEEE 802.11 Terminology and Technology
 
■
CTS-to-Self
 
■
PS-Poll
 
■

Data Frames
As their name implies, data frames are used to carry data payload or Layer 3 information 
between wireless devices. The following list includes examples of data frames:
 
■
Data
 
■
QoS data
 
■
Null data
The null data or null function frame is a special type of data frame that helps implement 
power save features and is not used to carry any data payload. There is also a variant of the 
null frame called the QoS null frame, which is used with wireless LAN quality of service 
functions.
Wireless Network Discovery
Wireless LAN discovery is the process of a client device looking for wireless networks and 
identifying the parameters of the network, including but not limited to the SSID, supported 
data rates, and security settings. Wireless network discovery prepares a wireless client 
device to perform an IEEE 802.11 authentication and association, which will allow a wire-
less device access to the network. The wireless network discovery phase consists of the pas-
sive scanning and active scanning processes.
Passive Scanning
The fi rst part of the wireless network discovery phase in IEEE 802.11 wireless network-
ing is known as passive scanning. This process allows wireless LAN devices to “listen” for 
information about wireless networks in the radio receiving area of the wireless network or 
the basic service area (BSA). During the passive scanning process, wireless LAN devices 
will listen for specifi c information to make them aware of networks in the area. An analogy 
to this process would be using an FM radio tuner to scan through the entire band, listening 
for a station to tune in to. The radio will scan through the band listening for different sta-
tions. The person using the tuner can stop on the desired station once it is heard.
Management frames assist wireless LAN devices in fi nding and connecting to a wireless 
network. An example of a management frame that works in the discovery phase or passive 
scanning is a beacon frame. This frame for the most part is an advertisement of the wire-
less network. It carries specifi c information about the access point or basic service set such 
as the SSID, the radio frequency channel that it is operating on, the available data rates it 
is confi gured for, the security parameters, and much more. During the passive scanning 

Connecting to an IEEE 802.11 Wireless Network

phase, wireless devices listen for beacons advertising the details about the wireless net-
works in the area or radio range of the client device. Wireless LAN devices are constantly 
listening for beacon frames. Figure 5.21 shows a wireless LAN client passively scanning 
and listening for an access point to connect with.

By default, most manufacturers set beacons to broadcast at about 10 times a second. 
This value is actually 1,024 microseconds and is identifi ed as the target beacon transmis-
sion time (TBTT). Although this interval can be changed, it is best to do so only if neces-
sary or recommended by the manufacturer. In some cases, manufacturers may suggest 
specifi c timing intervals for such frames as beacons.

point.

224 
Chapter 5 ■ IEEE 802.11 Terminology and Technology
Active Scanning
Active scanning is the second part of the wireless LAN discovery phase. In active scan-
ning, wireless LAN devices wishing to connect to a network send out a management frame 
known as a probe request. The function of this management frame is to fi nd a specifi c wire-
less access point to connect with. Depending on the wireless client utility software used, if 
an SSID is specifi ed in the client utility software active profi le, the device will join only a 
network with the matching SSID that is specifi ed.
An exception to this is a probe request frame that contains a “wildcard SSID” or a 
“null SSID.” The IEEE 802.11 standard requires all access points to respond to a “null” or 
broadcast probe request frame. This type of probe request frame will not specify an SSID 
value and will rely on the access points to provide the SSID in the probe response frame.
Access points constantly listen for probe request frames. Any access point within hear-
ing range of the wireless device and having a matching SSID sends out a probe response 
frame to the wireless device that sent the probe request frame. If more than one access 
point responds, the device selects the “best” access point to connect with based on certain 
factors such as signal strength and signal quality. Figure 5.23 illustrates the active scanning 
process.

Frames Used for Active Scanning
During the active scanning process, two frames are exchanged between the client device 
and the access point.
1. 
The wireless LAN client device sends a broadcast probe request frame to all devices, 
including access points within radio range.
2. 
The access point(s) send a probe response frame to the device so it can identify the 
parameters of the network before joining.
Figure 5.24 shows a packet analyzer capturing frames of the active scanning process.
F I G U R E 5 . 2 4  Packet analyzer capture of probe request and probe response frames
The IEEE 802.11 standard requires access points to respond to devices that 
are sending a null or blank SSID in a probe request frame. The standard 
refers to this as a wildcard SSID. It is important not to confuse this with 
disabling the SSID broadcast on an access point. Most wireless equipment 
manufacturers provide the capability to set the access point not to respond 
to a probe request frame with a null or wildcard SSID. If the AP is set not to 
respond to such probe requests, the wireless device is required to have the 
SSID specified in the client utility in order to connect to the BSS.
IEEE 802.11 Authentication
Authentication in general is defi ned as verifying or confi rming an identity. We use a variety 
of authentication mechanisms in our daily lives, such as when logging onto a computer 
or network at home or at the offi ce, accessing secure sites on the Internet, using an ATM 
machine, or showing an identifi cation badge to get access to a building.
IEEE 802.11 devices must use an authentication process to access network resources. 
This IEEE 802.11 authentication process differs from conventional authentication meth-
ods such as providing credentials like a username and password to gain access to a 
network. The authentication discussed here is wireless device or IEEE 802.11 authen-
tication, required for the device to become part of the wireless network and participate 

226 
Chapter 5 ■ IEEE 802.11 Terminology and Technology
in exchanging data frames. (Providing credentials such as a username and password or a 
preshared key is a different type of authentication, to be discussed in Chapter 16, “ Device 
Authentication and Data Encryption.”) The IEEE 802.11 standard addresses two types of 
IEEE authentication methods: open system and shared key. 
IEEE 802.11 Open System Authentication
This 802.11 authentication method is defi ned by the IEEE 802.11 standard as a null 
authentication algorithm. IEEE 802.11 open system authentication is the only valid IEEE 
802.11 authentication process allowed with newer wireless LAN security amendments and 
interoperability certifi cations for the network to be considered a robust security network 
(RSN).
IEEE 802.11 open system authentication is a two-step authentication process. Two man-
agement frames are exchanged between the wireless client device and the access point dur-
ing open system authentication. It is a simple process. A wireless LAN device will ask an 
access point, “Can I be a part of this network?” and the access point will respond, “Sure, 
come join the party.” So there really is no validation of identity. IEEE 802.11 open system 
authentication is considered a two-way frame exchange because two authentication frames 
are sent during this process. It is not a request and response situation; it is authentication 
and success.
Figure 5.25 illustrates open system authentication.

Open system authentication does not provide any type of data encryp-
tion. With open system authentication, Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is 
optional and can be used for data encryption if desired. However, because 
of the inherit security vulnerabilities with WEP, using it as a security solu-
tion for wireless networks is highly discouraged. WEP will be discussed in 
more detail in Chapter 16. 
These are the two steps used for open system authentication. One management frame is 
sent in each step.
1. 
The wireless LAN client device wanting to connect sends an authentication frame to 
the access point. This frame is acknowledged by the access point.
2. 
The access point accepting the connection sends a successful authentication frame back 
to the client device. This frame is acknowledged by the authenticating device.
Figure 5.26 shows a packet capture of the two-way open system authentication frame 
exchange.
F I G U R E 5 . 2 6  Packet capture of open system authentication
For the most part, open system authentication cannot fail unless other security measures 
such as MAC fi ltering are put in place that will prevent the device from accessing the net-
work. It may also fail because of a corrupt network adapter driver, although this is not very 
common. 
Keep in mind that IEEE 802.11 open system authentication always exists, even with the 
most secure wireless LANs. It is used to allow the wireless station to connect to the access 
point and then after association use additional credentials such as a passphrase or user-
name and password pair for authentication. If the wireless station did not perform an open 
system authentication and association fi rst, the station would not have a Layer 2 connec-
tion and there would be no way to use additional security mechanisms. 
IEEE 802.11 Shared-Key Authentication
Shared-key is another authentication method defi ned by the IEEE 802.11 standard. It is 
a little more complex than open system authentication. This IEEE 802.11 authentication 
method is a four-way frame exchange. During IEEE 802.11 shared-key authentication, 
four management frames are sent between the wireless client device wanting to join the 

228 
Chapter 5 ■ IEEE 802.11 Terminology and Technology
wireless network and the access point. Shared-key authentication differs from open system 
authentication in that shared-key authentication is used for both IEEE 802.11 authentica-
tion and for data encryption.
IEEE 802.11 shared-key authentication is considered fl awed from a security perspec-
tive. It requires the use of Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) for both wireless client device 
authentication and data encryption. Because WEP is mandatory, a hacker could potentially 
identify the WEP key used for the network by capturing the authentication process using 
a wireless packet analyzer. If a hacker was to capture the four wireless frames used during 
the shared-key authentication process, they would be able to use this information with the 
appropriate software to extract the security (WEP) key to gain access to the network and 
see the encrypted data. Shared-key authentication should be avoided whenever possible and 
is not allowed when using newer IEEE 802.11i, WPA, and WPA2 security methods.
Some manufacturers have removed the option to set shared-key authen-
tication, both in infrastructure devices such as access points and bridges 
and in client software utilities. Although very unlikely, there is a slight 
chance that some legacy client devices may still use IEEE 802.11 shared-key 
authentication as the only authentication option. If this is the case, steps 
need to be taken to protect the integrity of the network and also to identify 
an appropriate upgrade path for the devices using IEEE 802.11 shared-key 
authentication. 
It is important not to confuse legacy IEEE 802.11 shared-key authentica-
tion with modern WPA pre-shared key. WPA and WPA2 pre-shared key is 
used with personal mode authentication and passphrases. When you enter 
a passphrase into an access point or wireless client device an algorithm 
defined in the IEEE 802.11i amendment will create a 256-bit pre-shared key.
Figure 5.27 illustrates the four frames exchanged during the shared-key authentication 
process.
Because WEP is mandatory with shared-key authentication, it makes a system vulner-
able to intrusion. Therefore, open system authentication is considered more secure than 
shared-key authentication when WEP is used with the IEEE 802.11 open system authen-
tication. This is because WEP is used to encrypt the data only and not used for the IEEE 
802.11 authentication process. WEP was designed as a way to protect wireless networking 
users from casual eavesdropping, and it does just that.

Frames Used for Shared-Key Authentication
An 802.11 wireless device must perform an IEEE 802.11 authentication to the wireless net-
work prior to associating according to the 802.11 standard. The following steps show the 
four-way frame exchange used for shared-key authentication. This method should not be 
used but is shown here to illustrate the process.
1. 
The wireless LAN device wanting to authenticate sends an authentication frame to 
the access point. This frame is acknowledged by the access point.
2. 
The access point sends a frame back to the WLAN device that contains a challenge 
text. This frame is acknowledged by the WLAN device.
3. 
The WLAN device sends a frame back to the access point containing an encrypted 
response to the challenge text. The response is encrypted using the device’s WEP 
key. This frame is acknowledged by the access point.
4. 
After verifying the encrypted response, the access point accepts the authentication 
and sends a “successful authentication” frame back to the device. This ﬁ nal frame is 
acknowledged by the device.

IEEE 802.11 Association
IEEE 802.11 association takes place after a wireless device has been successfully 802.11 
authenticated either by open system authentication or by shared-key authentication. In the 
association state, the authenticated device can pass traffi c across the access point to the net-
work infrastructure or other associated wireless devices, allowing access to resources that 
the device or user has permissions to access. After a device is authenticated and associated, 
it is considered to be part of the basic service set. Figure 5.29 illustrates the association pro-
cess, and Figure 5.30 shows the frames used during the association process.

After successful association, the IEEE 802.11 authentication and association process 
is complete. Keep in mind that this is very basic access to the network using either open 
system authentication or WEP for authentication and encryption. After this process is com-
plete, more sophisticated authentication mechanisms such as IEEE 802.1X/EAP (which 
provides user-based authentication) or pre-shared key (passphrase) can be used to secure 
the wireless network. These and other security components will be discussed in more detail 
in Chapter 16. 
Frames Used for IEEE 802.11 Association
After a successful 802.11 authentication, the association process will begin. Association 
means the device has successfully connected to the wireless network and is allowed to 
send information across the access point to the network infrastructure.
1. 
Wireless LAN device sends an association request frame to the access point. This 
frame is acknowledged by the access point.
2. 
The access point sends an association response frame to the device. This frame is 
acknowledged by the associating device.
IEEE 802.11 Deauthentication and Disassociation
The opposite of authentication and association can occur in a wireless LAN. These events 
are known as deauthentication and disassociation. Deauthentication occurs when an exist-
ing authentication is no longer valid. This can be caused by a wireless LAN device logging 
off from the current connection or roaming to a different BSS. A disassociation occurs 
when an association to an access point is terminated. This may occur when the associated 
wireless LAN device roams from one BSS to another. 
Both deauthentication and disassociation frames are notifi cations and not requests. 
Since neither can be refused by either side, they are both considered automatically success-
ful from the sender’s perspective. Unless IEEE 802.11w is implemented, deauthentication 
can be a security issue. These frames can be used for denial of service attacks or to hijack a 
wireless device. 
Both deauthentication and disassociation frames are management frames. Figure 5.31 
shows how disassociation and deauthentication frames would look on a packet analyzer.

232 
Chapter 5 ■ IEEE 802.11 Terminology and Technology
Hacking tools are available that will continuously send deauthentica-
tion frames to a device. Use of this type of tool is considered a denial of 
service (DoS) attack. A hacker may also use a deauthentication frame to 
force a device to reauthenticate to an access point, causing the device to 
be hijacked. The 802.11w amendment provides enhancements to the IEEE 
802.11 standard that enables data integrity, data origin authenticity, replay 
protection, and data confidentiality for selected IEEE 802.11 management 
frames that include authentication. 
The Distribution System
In wireless LAN technology, the distribution system (DS) is the common network infra-
structure to which wireless access points are connected. In most cases this would be an 
Ethernet segment. In this capacity, the access point acts like a Layer 2 translational bridge. 
A translational bridge is defi ned as a device used to connect two or more dissimilar types 
of LANs together, such as wireless (IEEE 802.11) and Ethernet (IEEE 802.3). From a 
receiver’s perspective, this allows an access point to take information from the air (the 
communication medium in wireless networking) and make a decision either to send it back 
out to the same wireless radio or to forward it across to the distribution system. An access 
point can do this because it has enough intelligence to determine if a data frame is destined 
to be sent to the distribution system or if it should stay on the originating wireless side of 
the network. This is possible because the access point knows whether a device is part of the 
wireless LAN side through the authentication and association methods mentioned earlier. 
Figure 5.32 shows an example of a distribution system.

Data Rates 
233
The distribution system is a network segment that consists of one or more connected 
basic service sets. According to the original IEEE 802.11 standard, one or more intercon-
nected basic service sets make up an extended service set. The distribution system allows 
wireless LAN devices to communicate with resources on a wired network infrastructure 
or to communicate with each other through the wireless medium. Either way, all wireless 
frame transmissions will traverse through an access point.
Data Rates
The speed at which wireless devices are designed to exchange information is known as 
the data rate. Data rates will differ depending on the wireless standard, amendment to 
the standard, spread spectrum type, or Physical layer technology in use. Table 5.6 shows 
data rates for the various WLAN technologies. Data rates do not accurately represent the 
amount of information that is actually being transferred between devices and a wireless 
network. Figure 5.33 shows an 802.11a/g/n wireless LAN adapter in a notebook computer 
reading a data rate of 300 Mbps. To learn more about the actual amount of information 
transferred, see the next section, “Throughput.”

Throughput
Unlike the data rate (the maximum amount of information theoretically capable of being 
sent), throughput is the amount of information actually being correctly received or trans-
mitted. Many variables affect the throughput of information being sent:
 
■
Spread spectrum or Physical layer technology type in use
 
■
Radio frequency interference
 
■
Number of wireless devices connected to an access point (contention)
For example, an 802.11g wireless access point has a maximum data rate of 54 Mbps. 
With one user connected to this access point, chances are the best throughput that could be 
expected is less than 50 percent of the maximum, or about 20 Mbps. If more users connect 
to the same access point, the throughput for each user would be even less, because of the 
contention between users sharing the same wireless medium. Figure 5.34 shows an example 
of actual throughput for an 802.11a/g/n wireless LAN adapter.

Packing and Shipping Data: A Throughput Analogy
Packing and shipping an item in a cardboard box is a way of looking at data rate versus 
throughput. You have a cardboard box that is rated to have a maximum capacity of two 
cubic feet. You want to send a fragile item such as a vase to somebody. The vase, if mea-
sured, would really only take about one cubic foot of space. However, this is a very fragile 
item, and you want to make sure it gets to the destination without any damage. So rather 
than just putting the vase by itself in a box with a capacity of one cubic foot, you want to 
protect it with some packing material such as Bubble Wrap. That will take an additional 
one cubic foot of space.
The data rate is analogous to the box capable of holding two cubic feet of material. The 
one-cubic-foot vase is analogous to the actual data being sent. The packing material is 
analogous to the contention management and other overhead that causes the throughput 
to be less than the theoretical capacity of the WLAN device.

Measuring Throughput of a Wireless Network
In this activity, you will measure throughput of a wireless network. If you have the proper 
equipment, it is not too difﬁ cult. If you already have an existing wireless network set up 
with a computer connected to the wired side or distribution system, you have a good part 
of the setup done. This exercise uses the JPerf software program for Microsoft Windows. 
JPerf is a graphical front-end program for IPerf from SourceForge. JPerf does require 
that Java be installed on the computer. The following step-by-step instructions assume a 
wireless access point already conﬁ gured with TCP/IP settings as well as SSID. To perform 
this exercise, you will need the following equipment:

Chapter 5 ■ IEEE 802.11 Terminology and Technology
Dynamic Rate Switching
When a wireless device moves through the basic service area (BSA) or as the distance from 
the access point increases, the data rate will decrease. Conversely, as the wireless device 
moves closer to the access point, the data rate can increase. This is called dynamic rate 
switching (DRS), also known as dynamic rate shifting and even dynamic rate selection. 
This process allows an associated wireless device to adapt to the radio frequency in a par-
ticular location of the BSA. DRS is typically accomplished through proprietary mechanisms 
set by the manufacturer of the wireless device. The main goal of dynamic rate switching 
is to improve performance for the wireless device connected to an access point. As a wire-
less device moves away from an access point, the amount of received signal will decrease 
because of the free space path loss. When this occurs, the modulation type will change 
because the radio frequency signal quality is less and thus a lower data rate will be realized.
Different data rates use different modulation technologies. Using a less complex modula-
tion type at a lower data rate will provide better overall performance as the station moves 
away from the access point. Figure 5.35 illustrates how dynamic rate switching works. As 
the wireless device moves away from the access point, the data rate will decrease. Keep in 
mind the opposite is true as well. As a wireless device moves closer to an access point, the 
data rate will increase.

Wireless LAN Transition or Roaming
In wireless LAN technology, transition is the term for what happens when a wireless device 
moves from one basic service set or access point to another. People in the wireless LAN 

Wireless LAN Transition or Roaming 
243
industry commonly refer to this process as roaming (this term was derived from the cellular 
world). 
Wireless transition was not addressed in the original IEEE 802.11 standard. The pro-
cess is typically accomplished in a proprietary manner based on how the manufacturer 
chooses to implement it. Manufacturers use different criteria to initiate transitioning from 
one access point to another. There was an amendment to the IEEE 802.11 standard (IEEE 
802.11F, Inter-Access Point Protocol) that was ratifi ed in June 2003 as a recommended 
practice intended to address multivendor access point interoperability. However, this rec-
ommended practice was implemented by few if any manufacturers and it was withdrawn 
by the IEEE 802 Executive Committee in February 2006. The next attempt to standardize 
transition between access points was IEEE 802.11r. The driving force behind this amend-
ment to the standard was to allow for fast secure transition with wireless voice devices.
When a wireless LAN device moves through a BSA and receives a signal from another 
access point, it needs to make a decision whether to stay associated with the current access 
point or to reassociate with the new access point. The decision when to roam is proprietary 
and based on specifi c manufacturer criteria. Manufacturers use the following criteria:
 
■
Signal strength
 
■
Signal-to-noise ratio
 
■
Error rate
 
■
Number of currently associated devices
When a wireless LAN device chooses to reassociate to a new access point, the original 
access point will hand off the association to the new access point as requested from the new 
access point. Keep in mind it is the wireless client device that initiates the move to a new 
access point. This move is done over the wired network or distribution system based on 
how the manufacturer implemented the roaming criteria. Figure 5.36 illustrates a notebook 
computer roaming (transitioning) from one access point to a new access point.

Frames Used for Reassociation (Roaming)
When a wireless client device transitions, or “roams,” to a new access point, it needs to 
associate to the new access point. Because the device is already associated, in order to 
connect to the new access point it must complete a reassociation process.
1. 
A wireless LAN device sends a reassociation request frame to the new access point. 
This frame is acknowledged by the new access point.
2. 
The new access point sends a reassociation response frame to the wireless client 
device after handoff across the distribution system from the original access point has 
occurred. This frame is acknowledged by the reassociating wireless device.
Figure 5.37 shows reassociation request and response frames in a packet analyzer.
F I G U R E 5 . 3 7  Packet capture of the reassociation process
The 802.11r amendment to the standard was ratified in 2008 and is now 
part of the IEEE 802.11-2012 standard. This amendment is for fast basic ser-
vice set (BSS) transition (FT) and allows for fast secure transition (roaming) 
for devices between basic service sets. The main objective of this amend-
ment is to support Voice over IP (VoIP) technology.
IEEE 802.11 Power Save Operations
Many wireless LAN devices are portable and use direct current (DC) battery power to 
some degree. A wireless network adapter uses DC power to operate, and in some cases this 
could be a signifi cant drain on the battery in the device. This is especially true with newer 
IEEE 802.11n or newer wireless adapters that support MIMO technology. The original 
IEEE 802.11 standard addresses power save operations. Power save operations are designed 
to allow a wireless LAN radio to enter a dozing state in order to conserve DC power and 
extend battery life. If the wireless LAN device is plugged into a consistent power source 
such as an alternating current (AC) outlet, there is no reason to implement power save 

IEEE 802.11 Power Save Operations 
245
features. However, portable devices that are mobile and may not have access to an AC 
power source should consider using power save operations if necessary. 
The original IEEE 802.11 standard addressed two different power save modes: active 
mode (AM) and power save (PS) mode. In some cases, power save (PS) mode is considered 
legacy because the IEEE 802.11e amendment for quality of service addresses new, more 
effi cient power save mechanisms. Although the original PS mode may be considered legacy, 
it may still be used in some devices. 
As mentioned earlier in this chapter in the section “IEEE 802.11 Frame Types,” a data 
frame known as a null function frame is used with power management; it does not carry 
any data but is used to inform the access point of a change in power state.
Active Mode
In active mode (AM), a wireless LAN client device or station (STA) may receive frames at 
any time and is always in an “awake” state. In this case, the wireless LAN device is not 
relying on battery power; thus, there is no reason for the device to assume a low power 
state, and it will never doze. Some manufacturers refer to active mode as continuous aware 
mode (CAM).
Power Save Mode
In power save (PS) mode, the radio in the wireless LAN client device or station (STA) will 
doze or enter a low power state for very short periods of time. At specifi c time intervals, the 
device will “listen” for selected beacons and determine if any data is waiting for it (buff-
ered) at the access point. The beacon frame contains information for associated devices 
regarding power save. When a wireless LAN device associates to an access point, the device 
receives what is known as an association ID (AID) in the association response frame. The 
association ID is a value that will represent that device in various functions, including 
power save mode. The beacon frame contains an indicator for each AID associated device 
to let wireless devices know whether they have data waiting for them or buffered at the 
access point. If it is determined that the access point does have data buffered for a specifi c 
device, the device will send a control frame message (PS-Poll frame) to the access point 
to request the buffered data. Figure 5.38 shows where power save mode can be set in the 
advanced settings of the wireless adapter device driver.
Power save mode will cause some level of overhead for the wireless LAN device, and 
there is a trade-off in performance. With power save mode enabled, the battery life will 
be extended; however, performance will suffer to some degree because the device will not 
be available to receive data continuously. The device will only be able to receive buffered 
data during the “awake” state. Power save mode is common in applications where battery 
conservation is important, such as bar code scanners, voice over Wi-Fi phones, and other 
handheld devices.

Use of Power Save Mode in Bar Code Scanners
Organizations such as retail, manufacturing, and warehousing have been using 802.11 
wireless LAN technologies for many years. Many of these businesses use wireless LAN 
devices such as bar code scanners in addition to notebook computers and other portable 
devices. Bar code scanners are used heavily for inventory and asset tracking purposes. 
These devices must run for many hours at a time, typically in 8- or 10-hour shifts for 
individuals who may be using them. Applications such as this greatly beneﬁ t from using 
IEEE 802.11 power save features and extending battery life of wireless LAN devices. This 
minimizes downtime because batteries in these devices will not have to be changed or 
recharged as often during a work shift.
Automatic Power Save Delivery
The IEEE 802.11e Quality of Service amendment to the standard fueled the need for more 
effi cient power save mechanisms in wireless networking. Depending on the implementa-
tion and requirements, legacy power save modes may not be effi cient enough to work with 

IEEE 802.11 Protection Modes and Mechanisms 
247
applications that use QoS, such as voice and video. Automatic power save delivery (APSD) 
differs from the original power save mode in that a trigger frame will wake a device in 
order to receive data. APSD is a more effi cient way of performing power save functions. 
Because of this trigger-and-delivery method, it works well with time-bound applications 
that are subject to latency, such as voice and video. 
IEEE 802.11 Protection Modes and 
Mechanisms
To allow newer, faster wireless LAN technology such as 802.11g and 802.11n devices to 
communicate with older, slower wireless devices, technology called protection mechanisms 
was designed to allow for backward compatibility. The mechanisms available depend on 
which amendment to the standard is used. Protection mechanisms will provide the back-
ward compatibility needed to allow different technologies to coexist in the same radio fre-
quency space.
There are two broad categories of protection mechanism:
 
■
Extended rate physical (ERP) protection mechanism for IEEE 802.11g networks
 
■
High throughput (HT) protection mechanism for IEEE 802.11n networks
Each category includes several modes for specifi c situations.
IEEE 802.11g Extended Rate Physical Protection 
Mechanisms
For IEEE 802.11g and IEEE 802.11b devices to coexist in the same basic service area, the 
wireless access point must use extended rate physical (ERP) protection. Most manufactur-
ers of IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN equipment will provide options when it comes to coex-
istence. These options usually include the capability to set an access point to one of three 
modes:
 
■
IEEE 802.11bonly mode: DSSS and HR/DSSS 
 
■
IEEE 802.11gonly mode: ERP-OFDM
 
■
IEEE 802.11b/g mixed mode: DSSS, HR/DSSS, and ERP-OFDM
IEEE 802.11b-Only Mode
An access point must be set to operate in 802.11b-only mode. This involves disabling 
all the IEEE 802.11g ERP-OFDM data rates of 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 54 Mbps 
and allowing only DSSS data rates of 1 and 2 Mbps and HR/DSSS rates of 5.5 and 11 
Mbps. Enabling this mode limits the maximum data rate to 11 Mbps. Setting an access 

248 
Chapter 5 ■ IEEE 802.11 Terminology and Technology
point to this mode has limited applications, such as using legacy devices capable of IEEE 
802.11b-only, for example.
IEEE 802.11g-Only Mode
This mode is the opposite of 802.11b-only mode. It disables all of the IEEE 802.11b DSSS 
and HR/DSSS data rates of 1, 2, 5.5, and 11 Mbps, and it allows the IEEE 802.11g ERP-
OFDM data rates of 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 54 Mbps. This operation mode is useful 
in an environment where backward compatibility to 802.11b is not required (such as an 
environment where all devices connecting have IEEE 802.11g capability) and the through-
put needs to be maximized; thus there are no IEEE 802.11b devices in use. 
IEEE 802.11b/g Mixed Mode
Most deployments in the 2.4 GHz ISM band use this mode for communications. It allows 
devices that support the IEEE 802.11g amendment and IEEE 802.11b devices to operate 
together in the same BSA and associate to the same access point. Because of this protection 
mode, throughput will decrease when IEEE 802.11b devices and IEEE 802.11g devices are 
both associated to the same access point.
Extended rate physical (ERP) mixed mode uses control frames to reserve the wireless 
medium. Two options are available:
Request to Send/Clear to Send (RTS/CTS)  One option of control frames that are used as 
a protection mechanism to reserve the RF medium.
Clear to Send (CTS) to Self  A single frame used as a protection mechanism. This is a com-
mon implementation used by wireless LAN equipment manufacturers. A benefi t of using 
this frame is less overhead than the RTS/CTS process.
Both RTS/CTS and CTS-to-Self control frames allow wireless devices using different 
Physical layer technologies to share the wireless medium and help to avoid collisions. These 
control frames specify how much time is needed for a frame exchange between the trans-
mitter and a receiver to complete. The time value is processed by all devices in the basic ser-
vice area that are not part of the frame exchange. Once this time has expired, the wireless 
medium is considered clear.
IEEE 802.11n High-Throughput Protection Mechanisms
IEEE 802.11n devices operate in either the 2.4 GHz or the 5 GHz band. Backward com-
patibility for IEEE 802.11a/b/g devices needs to be taken into consideration. The IEEE 
802.11n amendment identifi es several different operation modes for high-throughput (HT) 
protection mechanisms. The mechanisms are known as HT protection operation modes 
and are a set of rules that devices and access points will use for backward compatibility:

20 MHz protection mode
 
■
Non-HT mixed mode
These operation modes are constantly changing based on the radio frequency environ-
ment and associated wireless devices. The goal with IEEE 802.11n wireless networks is to 
eventually get to no protection mode. The correct encoding bit (0, 1, 2 or 3) will be set in 
the HT Protection fi eld within the wireless frame header and show what the actual oper-
ating mode is. With today’s wireless networks and WLAN technology, we are more than 
likely at non-HT mixed mode or possibly even one of the other two modes in most cases.
No Protection Mode
No protection mode, allows high-throughput (HT) devices only. These HT devices must 
also share operational functionality, and they must match; for example, they must all sup-
port 20 MHz or 20/40 MHz channels only. If an IEEE 802.11n (HT) access point is set to 
20/40 MHz channel width and a client capable of only 20 MHz wide channels associates, 
the connection is considered to be in no protection mode. This operation mode does not 
allow IEEE 802.11a/b/g devices using the same RF channel. IEEE 802.11a/b/g devices will 
not be able to communicate with an access point in no protection mode. Transmissions 
from these devices will cause collisions at the access point, causing some degradation in 
throughput because it is seen by the HT system as radio frequency interference. No protec-
tion mode is what we as wireless network designers and administrators are working toward 
achieving, but it may be some time before we are there because of backward compatibility 
and legacy wireless devices.
Nonmember Protection Mode
All devices in this operation mode, or nonmember protection mode, must be HT capable. 
When a non-HT device—that is, an IEEE 802.11a/b/g access point or wireless client 
device—is within hearing range of the HT access point and on the same 20 MHz channel 
or one of the 20/40 MHz wide channels, this protection mode will be activated.
20 MHz Protection Mode
All devices in this operation mode, or 20 MHz protection mode, must be HT capable as 
well. The operation of this protection mode is based on the fact that 802.11n devices can 
use 20 MHz or 20/40 MHz wide channels. 20 MHz protection mode means that at least 
one 20 MHz HT station is associated with the HT 20/40 MHz access point and that the 
access point provides compatibility for 20 MHz devices.
Non-HT Mixed Mode
Non-HT mixed mode, is used if one or more non-HT stations are associated in the 
BSS. This operation mode allows backward compatibility with non-802.11n or IEEE 
802.11a/b/g wireless devices. This is the likely the most common mode for IEEE 802.11n

HT networks today because of the need for backward compatibility and the legacy IEEE 
802.11 wireless devices that are still in use on most wireless networks.
Additional HT Protection Mechanisms
Two other HT protection mechanisms are also available:
 
■
Dual CTS is a Layer 2 protection mechanism that is used for backward compatibility 
between IEEE 802.11n HT and IEEE 802.11a/b/g devices.
 
■
Phased coexistence operation (PCO) is an optional BSS mode with alternating 20 MHz 
and 20/40 MHz phases controlled by a PCO-capable access point.
Summary
Standards-based wireless LANs can use unlicensed or licensed radio frequency bands, 
which are broken down further into smaller RF channels. Wireless LANs use two modes: 
either ad hoc mode, which means no access points are used, or infrastructure mode, where 
an access point provides a central point of communication. We looked at wireless LAN 
confi gurations and their parameters in this chapter.
We also looked at the spread spectrum and Physical layer (PHY) technologies used with 
WLANs and the differences among them. The IEEE standard and various amendments use 
different PHY technologies and unlicensed radio spectrum, allowing for data rates of up to 
600 Mbps for 802.11n and 6.93 Gbps for 802.11ac. 
We explored FHSS because it is used today in many industries in various types of wire-
less technologies, including IEEE 802.15 personal area networks (PANs), Bluetooth, and 
cordless telephones.
You learned about radio frequency coverage and capacity and various types of radio fre-
quency signal measurements used with IEEE 802.11 wireless networking.
This chapter also looked at the processes wireless devices use to connect to and become 
part of a wireless LAN, including passive and active scanning (discovery) and IEEE 802.11 
authentication and association. Once these processes are complete, the wireless device 
becomes part of the wireless network, enabling it to pass traffi c across to the access point 
to the network infrastructure.
Additionally, you saw the components and technology that play a role with IEEE 802.11 
wireless networks, including the distribution system (DS), data rate (what is advertised), 
and throughput (what is actual).
Dynamic rate switching—when a client is transferring more or less data depending on 
the proximity from an access point as well as roaming or moving through the basic service 
areas while being able to maintain connectivity—was also discussed in this chapter. This 
chapter explored the important topics of power save mode and protection mechanisms.
Last, this chapter covered IEEE 802.11 protection mechanisms and how they provide 
backward compatibility to older technology devices. We looked at some highlights of 
extended rate physical (ERP) protection for IEEE 802.11g and high throughput (HT) pro-
tection 802.11n networks.

Choosing the correct network infrastructure devices to be 
installed as part of a computer network (both wired and wire-
less) is a critical element of a successful wireless LAN deploy-
ment. In this chapter, we will look at a variety of infrastructure devices, including wireless 
access points, wireless mesh devices, wireless bridges, wireless repeaters, hardware wire-
less LAN controllers, and cloud-managed wireless systems. Cloud-managed wireless LAN 
deployments are growing at a very fast pace in all markets. Where some manufacturers 
specialize in only cloud-managed solutions, most manufacturers of enterprise wireless 
equipment utilize cloud-based access points to some extent. You will learn about the fea-
tures, benefi ts, and advantages of these and other wireless network infrastructure devices. 
Power over Ethernet (PoE) is an extension to the IEEE 802.3 Ethernet standard that allows 
direct current (DC) voltage to be supplied over Ethernet cable to wireless access points, 
VoIP telephones, Ethernet security cameras, and other PoE-capable devices. Finally, we will 
explore the basics of other network infrastructure devices, including virtual private net-
work (VPN) concentrators, network gateways, and network proxy devices.
The Wireless Access Point
The wireless access point (AP) is an integral component of a wireless LAN infrastructure. 
Wireless access points allow a variety of wireless client devices access to any network 
resources that the device or user may have permissions for. The access point provides com-
puters, voice over Wi-Fi phones, smartphones, tablets, and other wireless client devices 
access to a local area network, using radio frequency (RF) as the communication mecha-
nism through free space (air) as the communication medium.
Wireless access points are available in three common types—autonomous, controller-
based, and cloud-based (or “controllerless”). Autonomous access points are self-contained 
units and can function as independent network infrastructure devices. Controller-based 
access points, by contrast, function in conjunction with a hardware wireless LAN control-
ler. Cloud-based access points provide a wireless network infrastructure without the use of 
a hardware controller, and are software-managed devices. 
When a wireless device is connected to an access point, it is said to be in infrastructure 
mode. In this operation mode, all wireless data traffi c is passed through the access point to 
the intended destination, whether that is a fi le server, a printer, the Internet, another wire-
less client device, or anything else capable of receiving network data. 

The Wireless Access Point 
255
An access point can operate as a stand-alone network device, confi gured independently 
to allow wireless devices to connect. It can also operate as part of a larger wireless network 
by sharing some of the same parameters, such as the service set identifi er (SSID). The SSID 
is the logical name, or identifi er, of the wireless LAN, and all wireless client devices con-
nected to an access point will share the same SSID setting. Figure 6.1 shows an example 
of an access point connected to an Ethernet network with several wireless network 
client devices.
F I G U R E  6 .1   Access point connected to an Ethernet network
In addition to providing access through a shared medium, wireless access points are 
half-duplex devices. Half-duplex is defi ned as two-way communication that occurs in 
only one direction at a time. (By contrast, full-duplex, the other communication method 
used in computer networking, allows two-way communication to occur between devices 
simultaneously.) Communication only one way at a time means less data throughput for 
the connected device. An access point is a network infrastructure device that can con-
nect to a distribution system (DS)—typically an Ethernet segment or Ethernet cable—and 
allow wireless devices to access network resources with the appropriate access permissions. 
According to the IEEE 802.11 standard, all wireless devices are considered stations (abbre-
viated STA), including access points. However, per the standard, an access point is identi-
fi ed as AP/STA (access point station). In a completely Ethernet-switched network, devices 
will communicate directly with the Ethernet switch. Figure 6.2 illustrates half-duplex com-
munication using a wireless access point.

This book uses the terms autonomous access point, controller-based 
access point, and cloud-based access point to describe the devices. In the 
industry, they are also known as intelligent access point, split MAC archi-
tecture, remote MAC, and thin access point. Manufacturers may also use 
various other terms to identify them.
Autonomous Access Points
Autonomous access points are self-contained units with all the intelligence necessary to 
provide devices with wireless access to a wired network infrastructure, and access to the 
resources the devices have permission to use. There are three popular types of autonomous 
access points: consumer grade; small offi ce, home offi ce grade (SOHO grade); and enter-
prise grade. Not surprisingly, the enterprise type generally offers the most robust feature 
set. The autonomous access point is best suited for small networks with only a few access 
points or wireless hotspots, because they must be managed independently, and therefore the 
scalability is somewhat limited.
The industry terminology for access points is not clearly defined. What 
might be considered a consumer-grade or SOHO-grade access point from 
one vendor might be considered the opposite from another vendor. In fact, 
some access points might even be considered both consumer-grade and 
SOHO-grade access points.

The Wireless Access Point 
257
The Consumer-Grade Access Point
Consumer-grade access points, or home broadband wireless routers, are usually equipped 
with an Internet port, several ports for Ethernet connections, and a wireless access point. 
The routers are confi gured through a web browser using either the HTTP or HTTPS 
protocol. Confi guration of the devices is fairly simple for the novice user using a web 
browser via a built-in web server. In most cases, a broadband wireless router connects 
to either a cable modem or a digital subscriber line (DSL) connection available from an 
Internet service provider (ISP). In this confi guration, a router is able to accept wired and 
wireless connections for computers and other devices, providing them with access to the 
local area network or the Internet. A wireless broadband router usually includes the follow-
ing features: 
 
■
Network Address Translation (NAT)
 
■
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server
 
■
IP routing
 
■
Domain Name System (DNS) services
 
■
Built-in firewall
A wireless broadband router has many of the same features a SOHO access point has. 
An example of an IEEE 802.11ac dual-band Gigabit wireless broadband router is shown in 
Figure 6.3.

Chapter 6 ■ Computer Network Infrastructure Devices
Notice in the fi gure that this device contains a Gigabit Ethernet switch, an Internet 
WAN port, a USB 2.0 port, and a wireless access point all in one self-contained unit. This 
is a very common confi guration with the wireless broadband router. 
The SOHO-Grade Access Point
Although they are powerful devices, SOHO-grade access points usually have a less 
extensive feature set than enterprise-grade access points. However, all newer-model 
 consumer-grade, SOHO-grade, and enterprise-grade access points now support the  highest 
standards-based security options available, including IEEE 802.11i or Wi-Fi Protected 
Access 2.0 (WPA 2.0) certifi cations. SOHO-grade access points are best used in the SOHO 
or home environment, and usually have a limited number of connections for computers and 
devices. SOHO-grade access points typically have the following features:
 
■
IEEE 802.11 standards support
 
■
Wi-Fi Alliance interoperability certifications
 
■
Removable antennas
 
■
Static output transmit power
 
■
Advanced security options
 
■
Wireless bridge functionality
 
■
Wireless repeater functionality
 
■
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server
 
■
Configuration and settings options
Figure 6.4 shows an example of a SOHO access point. You will notice that one differ-
ence between a SOHO access point and a consumer-grade wireless broadband router is 
the available connection ports. Where the broadband router is usually equipped with an 
Internet port and several ports for Ethernet connections, the SOHO access point typically 
has one Ethernet port to connect to a LAN.
In the fi gure, notice that unlike the consumer-grade access point discussed earlier, 
this device has only a single PoE-capable Ethernet connection, and no Internet WAN 
 connection or USB port.
IEEE 802.11 Standards Support
All later-model SOHO-grade access points support the current IEEE 802.11 standard. Some 
older devices may not have fi rmware updates available, which can cause implementation 
challenges where interoperability between newer and legacy devices is required. In this case, 
I recommend replacing older equipment with the most current, state-of-the art models. The 
802.11 standard and amendments that are supported will vary based on several factors, 
including the cost and complexity of the unit. The most common consumer-grade and 
SOHO-grade access points support the IEEE 802.11b, IEEE 802.11g, IEEE 802.11n, and 
now IEEE 802.11ac communication amendments. Most equipment manufacturers do make 
dual-band models, but the cost is normally higher than single-band (IEEE 802.11b/g/n)

access points. See Chapter 4, “Standards and Certifi cations for Wireless Technology,” if 
you need to review these 802.11 amendments to the standard.

and end views
Wi-Fi Alliance Interoperability Certifications
Interoperability certifi cations from the Wi-Fi Alliance are a common feature of SOHO-
grade access points. As mentioned in Chapter 4, these certifi cations include WPA/WPA 2.0 
and WPS for security, and WMM and WMM-PS for QoS. Selecting a SOHO-grade access 
point that is Wi-Fi certifi ed ensures compliance with IEEE standards, and interoperability 
with other IEEE 802.11 wireless devices.
In December 2011, a security flaw was reported with WPS, and should be 
considered before using this feature. See the warning in the section “Wi-Fi 
Protected Setup Certification” in Chapter 4 and check the device manufac-
turer’s website for more information. 
Removable Antennas
Some SOHO-grade access points are equipped with removable antennas. This allows the 
end user to change to a larger (higher-gain) antenna, thereby allowing a radio frequency 
to cover a wider area. Conversely, connecting a smaller (lower-gain) antenna will decrease 

260 
Chapter 6 ■ Computer Network Infrastructure Devices
the coverage area. Many SOHO access points have fi xed or nonremovable antennas, so you 
cannot add a higher-gain antenna.
The RF coverage area of an access point can be increased by adding a 
higher-gain antenna to the access point. For more information on this, and 
other antenna-related information, see Chapter 3, “Radio Frequency and 
Antenna Technology Fundamentals.”
Static Output Transmit Power
Occasionally an end user will have the ability to adjust the transmit output power in a 
SOHO-grade access point. If this is available, the settings are usually very basic, such 
as low, medium, and high. With enterprise access points, you can change the power 
in increments of a milliwatt (mW) or a decibel milliwatt (dBm). The transmit output 
power of the access point will determine in part the area of radio frequency coverage, 
also known as the RF cell or basic service area. A cell is the area of RF coverage of the 
transmitter, in most cases a wireless access point. The typical RF transmit power of 
a SOHO-grade access point is about 15 dBm, or 32 mW; however, this will vary with 
the manufacturer. An access point model with static output power settings cannot be 
adjusted, which will limit your ability to decrease or increase the size of the radio fre-
quency cell. Changing the RF cell size will allow the access point to cover a larger area 
in the home or small offi ce where the device is installed. In this case, the only way to 
change the RF cell size is to change the gain of the antenna in models that have the 
removable antenna feature. Note that replacing the antenna will also change the vertical 
and horizontal beamwidths, which is the electromagnetic radiation pattern that propa-
gates away from it. 
Advanced Security Options
All newer-model SOHO-grade access points support the highest security features, includ-
ing the IEEE 802.11i amendment and WPA 2.0 personal and enterprise operation modes. 
These security features give users with limited technical knowledge the ability to provide 
the most up-to-date security for their wireless network. For those users who have greater 
technical know-how, SOHO-grade access points also provide more advanced security 
features, such as user-based authentication IEEE 802.1X/EAP and VPN pass-through. 
Users can fi nd more information about these advanced features in most user guides 
 provided with the access point, or online at the device manufacturers’ websites.
Wireless Bridge Functionality
SOHO-grade access points can sometimes be confi gured in wireless bridge mode. Both 
point-to-point and point-to-multipoint settings are available, enabling administrators to 
connect two or more wired LANs together wirelessly using IEEE 802.11 equipment. 

The Wireless Access Point 
261
You learned about point-to-point and point-to-multipoint settings in Chapter 1, “Computer 
Network Types, Topologies, and the OSI Model.” Wireless bridging is discussed later in 
this chapter.
Wireless Repeater Functionality
Some SOHO-grade access points can be confi gured to function as wireless repeaters. 
Confi guring an access point as a repeater enables administrators to extend the size of the 
radio frequency cell so that devices not in hearing range of an access point can connect to 
the wireless network. However, the cost is reduced throughput for other devices accessing 
the network through a wireless repeater, in addition to more contention. Wireless repeaters 
are discussed later in this chapter.
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Server
It is also common for SOHO-grade access points to be able to act as Dynamic Host 
Confi guration Protocol (DHCP) servers. You learned in Chapter 2, “Common Network 
Protocols and Ports,” that a DHCP server will automatically issue an Internet Protocol (IP) 
address (logical address) to allow upper-layer communication between devices on the net-
work. IP addresses are a function of Layer 3 of the OSI model, as outlined in Chapter 1. A 
built-in DHCP server will ease the installation and support of the access point, providing a 
much better overall user experience.
Configuration and Settings Options
SOHO-grade access points are confi gured via a web browser, using either HTTP 
(Hypertext Transfer Protocol) or HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure). This type 
of browser-based confi guration is an easy way for the novice administrator to make all the 
necessary settings based on the application in which the access point will be used. SOHO-
grade access points rarely offer confi guration from the command-line interface (CLI), 
which allows for more extensive confi guration parameters. Figure 6.5 shows an example of 
a confi guration page from a SOHO-grade access point.
For security reasons, it is best practice to confi gure access points from the wired side of 
the network infrastructure whenever possible. Confi guration of an access point should only 
be done wirelessly if absolutely necessary. If confi guring this device from the wireless side 
of the network is the only option, a secure connection such as HTTPS or SSH2 should be 
in place to prevent potential compromise of administration user credentials and unauthor-
ized access of the wireless device.
Some manufacturers of consumer-grade and SOHO-grade wireless equip-
ment have online emulators that allow customers to view a sample of the 
configuration process for a device. This allows a user to sample the con-
figuration settings and become familiar with the device before making a 
purchase.

The Enterprise Access Point
Enterprise-grade access points typically have a much more extensive feature set than the 
previously mentioned SOHO-grade access points. Taking this into consideration, the price 
point can be signifi cantly higher for enterprise-grade access points. Figure 6.6 shows an 
example of an enterprise-grade access point.
Enterprise-grade access points can include the following features:
 
■
IEEE 802.11 standards support
 
■
Wi-Fi Alliance interoperability certifications
 
■
Removable or expandable antennas
 
■
Adjustable output transmit power
 
■

repeater, and mesh capabilities

F I G U R E  6 .6   The Aruba Networks 220 series IEEE 802.11ac dual-band access point
In addition to the items listed here, enterprise-grade access points have various other 
features that put them a notch above consumer-grade and SOHO-grade access points. 
Some of these features are outdoor use, plenum ratings, industrial environment ratings, 
more memory, and faster processors to help handle the load and various environmental 
conditions.
IEEE 802.11 Standards Support
Like the other access point types discussed in this chapter, enterprise-grade access points 
support IEEE standards. Enterprise access points have a more extensive feature set than 
SOHO-grade access points, and depending on the manufacturer and model, they will sup-
port all communication standards by utilizing the 5 GHz IEEE 802.11a/n/ac and the 
2.4 GHz IEEE 802.11b/g/n dual-band radios. Enterprise-grade access points can include 
support for some amendments to the standard not supported by SOHO-grade access 
points. Examples include support for IEEE 802.11e QoS, Wi-Fi multimedia certifi cations, 
IEEE 802.11r fast BSS transition (FT), and IEEE 802.11w for the security of management 
frames, to name a few.
Wi-Fi Alliance Interoperability Certifications
Certifi cations by the Wi-Fi Alliance are an important feature of enterprise-grade access 
points. These certifi cations include WPA/WPA 2.0 for security and WMM and WMM-PS 
for QoS. Selecting an enterprise-grade access point that is Wi-Fi certifi ed ensures compli-
ance with IEEE standards and interoperability with other IEEE 802.11–compliant devices.
Removable or Expandable Antennas
Many enterprise access points have removable or expandable antenna capabilities. These 
antenna confi gurations provide a lot of fl exibility, because an installer can choose the 
appropriate antenna based on the deployment scenario. Omnidirectional, semidirectional, 
and highly directional antennas are all types of antennas commonly used in the enterprise 
environment. Enterprise-quality access points that use internal antennas can offer options 
for connecting external antennas, should they be required for the specifi c installation. 
Antennas were discussed in more detail in Chapter 3.

264 
Chapter 6 ■ Computer Network Infrastructure Devices
Adjustable Output Transmit Power
Unlike consumer-grade and some SOHO-grade access points, the RF output power of the 
radio can be adjusted with enterprise-grade access points. This feature allows an installer 
to select the correct amount of transmit power based on the installation needs of the access 
point. One benefi t of having adjustable output power is that an installer can adapt to the 
environment in which the access point is installed. If the radio frequency dynamics of an 
area change, the ability to change access point settings such as output transmit power 
 without physical intervention is benefi cial.
Advanced Security Options
Compared to access points used in the consumer and SOHO environments, enterprise 
access points typically have more advanced security features. In addition to IEEE 802.11i, 
WPA/WPA 2.0, passphrase and user-based authentication, and IEEE 802.1X/EAP modes, 
features such as a built-in user database for local Remote Authentication Dial-In User 
Service (RADIUS) authentication are included. As discussed later in this chapter, local 
RADIUS authentication allows small-to medium-sized businesses to provide their own 
advanced authentication features without the need of external RADIUS authentication 
services. This reduces costs and lowers administration overhead. 
RADIUS is just one example of the more advanced security features available in enter-
prise-level access points. Another advanced security feature that may be available is some 
level of a wireless intrusion prevention system (WIPS). A WIPS will help determine and 
have the potential to mitigate certain levels of wireless intrusions or attacks on the network. 
One example is the detection of a rogue (unknown) access point. 
Advanced security features are discussed in more detail in Chapter 16, “Device 
Authentication and Data Encryption.” Some of the common confi guration options available 
for one model of enterprise access point are shown in Figure 6.7. 
Multiple Operation Modes
In addition to the features just discussed, enterprise-grade access points typically have 
several operation modes:
Root Access Point Mode (the most common configuration)  What some in the industry 
refer to as root access point mode is typically the default operation mode in which an 
 enterprise-grade access point is set. Root access point mode involves connecting the access 
point to a distribution system (DS) such as an Ethernet segment or a network  infrastructure 
of some sort. This mode allows computers and other wireless devices to connect to the 
access point and use network resources based on the assigned permissions of the user, 
 computer, or other wireless device.
Wireless Bridge Mode (for connecting LANs together)  This confi guration allows an 
access point to be set in bridge mode for wireless point-to-point or point-to-multipoint con-
fi gurations connecting two or more LANs. Benefi ts of using wireless access points to bridge 

The Wireless Access Point 
265
LANs together include cost savings and high data transfer rates compared to some other 
wired connectivity options.
Wireless Repeater Mode (to extend the radio frequency cell)  An access point confi gured 
in wireless repeater mode can act to extend the radio frequency cell. This allows wireless 
client devices outside the radio hearing range of an access point to still be able to connect 
to the network and access network resources via the wireless repeater. This operation mode 
does have the downside of reduced throughput, and should be used only if justifi ed because 
of no wired connectivity that allows the access point/repeater to connect to the network. 
Mesh Mode (for connecting access points together wirelessly)  If an access point has mesh 
capability, it can be confi gured to connect access points together without using a wired 
infrastructure. This is useful in areas where the physical distance from the network seg-
ment to the access points exceeds the 328-foot or 100-meter limitation. This is what was 
formerly known as a wireless distribution system (WDS). According to the latest version 
of the IEEE 802.11 standard, the term WDS is obsolete and subject to removal in a subse-
quent revision of the standard.

Chapter 6 ■ Computer Network Infrastructure Devices
If an enterprise-grade access point is configured for an operation mode 
other than an access point, it is no longer considered an access point. 
Typically an access point can be configured to operate in only one mode 
at any one time. Also, if an enterprise-grade access point is dual-band 
capable, it may be possible to configure each band (radio) as a different 
operation mode.
Access Point Configuration Methods
Enterprise-grade access points can commonly be confi gured, or “staged,” two 
different ways:
Graphical User Interface (GUI) Configuration  Enterprise-grade access points can be 
confi gured using a GUI confi guration from a web browser using HTTP or HTTPS. This 
is a convenient way to confi gure and change settings on the access point using a common 
graphical interface tool, a web browser. If the access point is confi gured using a wireless 
connection, using HTTPS is recommended for security at a minimum, but an SSH or IPsec 
VPN connection is highly recommended.
Command-Line Interface (CLI) Configuration  Most if not all enterprise-grade access 
points have command-line interface (CLI) capabilities to allow extensive and detailed 
confi guration of the device. In some cases, the CLI command set provides higher-level com-
mands that allow an administrator to perform additional confi guration tasks that aren’t 
available using the web browser method. This allows consistency in confi guring other 
network infrastructure devices, because many manufacturers share common commands 
among devices. CLI capabilities vary depending on the manufacturer, but most enterprise 
models have an extensive set of commands. Access points with CLI capabilities may have 
a special console port on the device, allowing a direct serial connection to a computer to 
access for confi guration purposes.
Controller-Based Access Points
Controller-based access points differ from autonomous access points in that they are used 
with hardware wireless LAN controllers and not as stand-alone devices. An  autonomous 
access point is a self-contained unit that has all the intelligence needed to provide 
 computer and device access to a wireless network. In contrast, controller-based access 
points have shifted some of the intelligence to the hardware wireless LAN controller. Since 
a controller-based access point may contain less intelligence than an autonomous access 
point, the cost of a controller-based access point may be lower, depending on the local 
MAC capabilities.
Controller-based access points are centrally managed from the hardware wireless LAN 
controller. The extent of how this is accomplished depends on the type of architecture 
that is in use: local MAC, split-MAC, or remote-MAC. Split-MAC is the most commonly 
used, with the controller handling the management and control planes and the access point 

The Wireless Access Point 
267
taking care of the real-time MAC functionality and the Physical layer communications. 
How manufacturers implement the technology varies. Typically, communication between 
the access point and the controller is handled by an Internet Protocol (IP) or proprietary 
tunnel that is built from the access point to the controller. Depending on the manufacturer, 
they may have a more extensive feature set than autonomous access points, while also 
including many of the features of those devices. Figure 6.8 shows front and rear views of a 
controller-based access point.
F I G U R E  6 . 8   Cisco Aironet 3500e CleanAir IEEE 802.11n access point
The benefi ts of controller-based access points are similar to those of autonomous access 
points, including radio frequency management, security, and quality of service. With 
remote MAC controller-based access points, very little or no intelligence is contained 
within the devices. Controller-based access points are PoE capable for ease of deployment 
in either mid-sized or large organizations. One thing to keep in mind is if a controller-
based access point is unable to communicate with the wireless LAN controller for some 
reason, the access point may be able to still provide communications to the associated client 
devices. How this is achieved widely varies, based on how the manufacturer implements the 
technology.

268 
Chapter 6 ■ Computer Network Infrastructure Devices
Cloud-Based Access Points
Cloud-based access point technology provides another solution for deploying wireless 
local area network infrastructures. The architecture for networks that use this type of 
access point is sometimes referred to as a “controllerless” architecture, because the device 
 intelligence has been pushed back out to or distributed to the access point edge, similar 
to that of the autonomous access point, but with much more intelligence and capabilities. 
The access points are managed through a “cloud” software confi guration tool, eliminat-
ing the need for a hardware controller. This type of management tool can be accessed 
from any computer with an Internet connection, assuming the user has appropriate 
 permissions to manage the devices. Some manufacturers also have “software appliances,” 
eliminating the reliance on the cloud server because the software is contained locally with 
the organization’s datacenter network. Figure 6.9 shows an example of a cloud-based 
access point.
F I G U R E  6 . 9   ADTRAN/Bluesocket 2030 IEEE 802.11ac (3x3:3) indoor acess point
Cloud-based access points provide all the benefi ts and features of a wireless LAN 
 controller solution without the need and extra expense of a hardware controller. This 
technology is scalable and performs well without relying on a “tunnel” from the access 
point to a controller through which some or all of the network traffi c can be forwarded. 

The Wireless Access Point 
269
The  distributed intelligence allows the cloud-based access point to make decisions 
about how frames traverse both the wired and wireless network without relying on the 
 hardware controller.
Some manufacturers of controller-based solutions provide a variant of the cloud technol-
ogy by allowing autonomous access points to be “adopted” by a controller in a large enter-
prise environment. These access points are then site survivable, meaning they will still be 
able to function on their own should connectivity with the controller be temporarily lost. 
The description of this technology includes the term adaptive access point.
Wireless Branch Router/Remote Access Point
A wireless branch router or remote access point can be used to extend a corporate network 
to a remote location such as a home, conference room, or branch offi ce through a secure 
connection using a WAN or the Internet. This type of device typically has three interfaces 
available:
 
■
Ethernet port(s) to connect to a LAN
 
■
Internet port to connect to the WAN or to an Internet connection
 
■
Wireless port to allow IEEE 802.11 computers and devices to connect to a network 
through a wireless connection
Wireless branch routers are usually compact and lightweight, making them easy for 
sales representatives and other corporate employees to travel with. They also have a more 
extensive feature set than wireless broadband routers, including the capability of building 
a Layer 3 VPN tunnel between devices in which the router on each side will act as a VPN 
endpoint. They can also be confi gured as a VPN pass-through device, allowing another 
device on the network such as a VPN concentrator to act as the VPN endpoint. They also 
include these features: 
 
■
Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)
 
■
Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol/Internet Protocol Security (L2TP/IPsec)
 
■
SSH2
 
■
Advanced IP networking services
 
■
Edge router capability

Wireless Mesh
Wireless mesh networking continues to grow at a steady pace. The concept of mesh net-
working has been in existence for many years. In a full mesh network, all nodes connect 
together with at least two paths for every node. This allows for reliable communication in 
the event of a device or path failure.
Wireless mesh networking is popular in the outdoor market space. Most outdoor 
mesh infrastructure devices provide the highest levels of wireless security, and are usually 
inside a rugged weatherproof enclosure for protection from the elements. Wireless mesh 
 networks are currently utilized in places such as metropolitan areas, university campuses, 
and  amphitheaters, as well as for applications used with public safety, transportation, and 
 government organizations. 
Currently, many wireless LAN manufacturers use proprietary mechanisms and proto-
cols for wireless mesh networking. IEEE 802.11s is an amendment to the IEEE 802.11 stan-
dard to include wireless mesh networking, and was ratifi ed in 2011. Many enterprise-grade 
access points have the ability to operate in mesh mode, whereas others have a dedicated 
mesh function.
Wireless mesh networking for indoor deployments is starting to appear as a viable solu-
tion for some wireless LAN infrastructure deployments.
Manufacturers commonly recommend using two unlicensed RF bands for a wireless 
mesh operation. One common solution is to use the 2.4 GHz ISM band for wireless client 
device access and the 5 GHz U-NII band for mesh device infrastructure connectivity. The 
use of a third radio may be an option in some cases. Using two different RF bands reduces 
contention on a single band and increases the overall performance of the network. 
Mesh can also be used in the event of Ethernet loss to an access point. Some cloud-based 
access points are able to automatically mesh together when they suffer an Ethernet loss. By 
default, they typically support clients in both bands, but can mesh in 5 GHz if an Ethernet 
connection fails. 
Figure 6.11 illustrates mesh access points connected to a wired infrastructure.
Some manufacturers may provide as many as four radios in a mesh access 
point. The fourth radio could utilize the 4.94–4.99 GHz licensed band, 
which is restricted to public safety use only, in the United States.

Wireless Bridges
Wireless bridges connect two or more wired LANs together. As discussed in Chapter 1, 
typically there are two confi gurations for wireless bridges: point-to-point and point-to-
multipoint. A wireless bridge is a dedicated device that functions in much the same way 
as an access point in bridge mode. Wireless bridges have many of the same features as 
 enterprise access points, including removable antennas and selectable power levels.
Connecting locations together using wireless bridging has many benefi ts, including 
fast installation, cost savings, and high data transfer rates. Depending on the circum-
stances, a wireless bridge can be installed in as little as one day or even several hours. Cost 
savings can be enormous compared to installing and maintaining a physical wired connec-
tion between locations, whether it is copper, fi ber-optics, or a leased line from a service 
provider.
Most wireless bridges can work in either the 2.4 GHz ISM or 5 GHz U-NII unlicensed 
band. However, keep in mind that bridges using wireless technology can also consist 
of proprietary technology using licensed frequency bands, which may be capable of 
greater distances and faster speeds than wireless bridges that use IEEE 802.11 devices. 

272 
Chapter 6 ■ Computer Network Infrastructure Devices
The connection can span long distances, so it is important to take security and environ-
mental conditions into consideration, as well as the proper antenna selection.
Figure 6.12 illustrates wireless bridges connecting two LANs in two separate buildings.

When LANs are connected using wireless bridges, the bridges must be set 
to the same RF channel and have the same SSID.
Wireless Repeaters
Wireless repeaters are used to extend the radio frequency cell. In a wired Ethernet network, 
repeaters function at Layer 1 of the OSI model to extend the Ethernet segment. An Ethernet 
repeater lacks intelligence—that is, it cannot determine data traffi c types, and simply passes 
all data traffi c across the device. Since wireless infrastructure devices, including repeaters, 
are Layer 2 devices, they have more intelligence than Ethernet repeaters.
An Ethernet segment has a maximum distance for successful data transmission, and 
wireless LANs do as well. This distance depends on several factors, including the transmit 
power of the access point and the gain of the antenna. Like an access point, the wireless 
client device is also a transmitter and a receiver, and will have a radio frequency range lim-
ited by the transmit power and gain of the antenna. A wireless repeater provides the capa-
bility for computers and other devices to connect to a wireless LAN even when outside the 
normal hearing range of the access point connected to the network. Figure 6.13 illustrates 
how a wireless repeater can extend the range of a wireless network.

Wireless Repeaters 
273
F I G U R E 6 .13  A wireless repeater extends the range of a wireless network.
Layer 2 Switch
Access Point
Repeater
Wireless Client
As illustrated, the wireless client device is not within hearing range of the access point, 
so adequate communication is not possible between these devices. In order for wireless 
LAN devices to communicate effectively with an access point, the transmitter must be able 
to hear the receiver, and the receiver must be able to hear the transmitter. It is a two-way 
radio communication. A wireless repeater will allow this communication to occur where 
the wireless client is outside the radio frequency cell or basic service area (BSA) of the 
access point. The wireless client will send information, or frames, to the repeater and the 
repeater will forward them to the access point, and vice versa. The downside of this con-
fi guration is that it will reduce the overall throughput. The wireless repeater may be named 
differently by the manufacturer and include the term wireless range extender.
Using Wireless Repeaters Reduces Throughput
Before using a wireless repeater, consider whether it would be the best solution. Since 
wireless LANs are half-duplex (two-way communication but only one way at a time), 
data throughput will suffer when repeaters are used. When data traverses a wireless link 
between devices that are set to  the same radio frequency channel, the data throughput 
can be reduced by up to 50 percent. If a physical wired connection is available, it should 
be used for an access point connection rather than a wireless repeater. For security pur-
poses, the Ethernet port on a wireless repeater should be disabled because it is not con-
nected to a wired network infrastructure.

274 
Chapter 6 ■ Computer Network Infrastructure Devices
Wireless LAN Controllers and Cloud-
Managed Architectures
The wireless LAN hardware controller is a main component in many wireless LAN deploy-
ments. Wireless LAN controllers range from branch offi ce models with a few controller-
based access points to large-scale enterprise devices with hundreds or even thousands of 
controller-based access points. The branch offi ce models are typically used in remote offi ce 
installations or small/medium business (SMB) applications with a limited number of access 
points. The controllerless, or cloud-managed, architecture is growing at a fast pace, and 
provides another option for enterprise wireless LAN deployments. The following sections 
discuss some of the many benefi ts, features, and advantages available on both wireless 
LAN controllers and cloud-managed controllerless solutions:
 
■
Centralized administration
 
■
Virtual local area Networks (VLANs)
 
■
PoE capability
 
■
Improved mobile device transition
 
■
Wireless LAN profiles and virtual WLANs
 
■

■
Infrastructure device redundancy
 
■
Wireless intrusion prevention system (WIPS)
 
■
Direct and distributed AP connectivity
 
■
Layer 2 and Layer 3 AP connectivity
 
■
Distributed and Centralized Data Forwarding
Centralized Administration
Wireless LAN controllers and cloud-managed controllerless solutions provide centralized 
administration, and give an administrator complete control over the wireless network 
from a single physical location. Unlike autonomous access points that require intervention 
at each device for confi guration, these solutions can be a “one-stop shop” for confi gura-
tion and management of the wireless network. A wireless network management system 

Wireless LAN Controllers and Cloud-Managed Architectures 
275
(WNMS) can be used as a centralized tool to manage autonomous access points that may 
be used in larger deployments. A WNMS can be used to help scale the autonomous access 
point architecture, but is not required.
Virtual Local Area Network
According to the IEEE 802.1Q standard, VLANs defi ne broadcast domains in a Layer 
2 network by inserting VLAN membership information into Ethernet frames. Layer 2 
Ethernet switches can create broadcast domains based on how the switch is confi gured, by 
using VLAN technology. This allows an administrator to separate physical ports into logical 
networks to organize traffi c according to the use of the VLAN for security  profi les, QoS, 
or other applications. The concept of a Layer 2 wired VLAN is extended to IEEE 802.11 
wireless LANs. Both hardware controller and controllerless solutions have the ability to 
confi gure broadcast domains and segregate broadcast and multicast traffi c between VLANs.
Power over Ethernet (PoE) Capability
Wireless LAN controllers and cloud-managed solutions support PoE, allowing direct 
 current voltage and computer data to be sent over the same cable. (The details of PoE 
are discussed later in this chapter, in the section “Power over Ethernet.”) Some hardware 
 controllers provide direct access point connectivity to the controller at the access layer 
and will provide the PoE. For hardware controllers that do not support direct  connectivity 
and cloud-managed solutions, the access points will receive their PoE from the Layer 2 
Ethernet switch.
Improved Mobile Device Transition
Fast, seamless Layer 2 and Layer 3 transitioning or roaming between access points is 
another common feature of hardware wireless controllers and cloud-managed  solutions. 
This feature makes it possible for computers and other wireless devices connected to the 
wireless LAN to maintain a connection while physically moving throughout the  wireless 
network. The IEEE 802.11r amendment specifi es fast transition (FT), and the IEEE 
802.11k helps with this functionality. Transitioning is more often than not an enterprise 
 network requirement, and exists in very few SOHO deployments.
Wireless LAN Profiles and Virtual WLANs
Both the wireless LAN controller and controllerless cloud-managed solutions can give net-
work administrators the ability to create a variety of confi guration profi les. These profi les 
can work in conjunction with VLANs to allow or deny access based on requirements for 
the computer, device, or user. Profi les can be confi gured for various situations, including 
different SSIDs for guest, corporate, and voice networks; security confi gurations; and QoS 
support. Each WLAN profi le will create a virtual access point with its own BSSID, and 

276 
Chapter 6 ■ Computer Network Infrastructure Devices
will act as though it is a separate physical device. This includes all the wireless management 
traffi c that works with wireless LAN technology.
Although Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is not recommended to be used 
in any wireless LAN, it may still exist in deployments that use legacy 
devices such as wireless bar code scanners or wireless print servers. Using 
WLAN profiles, you can allow this type of legacy device to be located on a 
separate wireless VLAN without compromising the security of the entire 
network. However, if WEP is still used, I highly recommend moving away 
from it as soon as possible by upgrading legacy devices.
Advanced Security Features
Like autonomous access points, hardware wireless controller and cloud-managed solutions 
provide advanced security options. These include security options based on IEEE 802.11i 
and WPA/WPA 2.0, with both passphrase and enterprise confi guration capabilities, 
allowing for the most secure mechanisms available for wireless LAN technology.
Captive Web Portals
Captive web portal capability is a common feature in hardware wireless LAN  controllers 
and cloud-managed systems. A captive web portal will intercept a user’s attempt to access 
the network by redirecting them to a web page for authorization of some sort. This web 
page may request account credentials, payment information from a user, or a simple 
 agreement to terms and conditions before granting access to the wireless network. One 
common example of where you will see a captive portal is in a paid or free wireless hotspot. 
The captive portal can be hosted by an outside service provider, an autonomous access 
point, a hardware wireless controller, and in a cloud-based system on the access point. It 
is important to note that some mobile devices may experience issues while connecting to a 
wireless network with captive web portal technology enabled.
Built-in RADIUS Services
Another common feature of wireless LAN controllers and cloud-managed systems is 
RADIUS services for 802.1X/EAP authentication, which is supported by WPA and WPA 
2.0. Built-in RADIUS allows a network administrator to utilize the most advanced security 
features available today to secure the wireless network. Built-in RADIUS servers typically 
limit the number of users that can be created in the user database, which means that built-
in RADIUS is a good solution for SMB or remote offi ce locations, but not for very large 
organizations. Larger networks can use external RADIUS services for scalability. See www
.gnu.org/software/radius for more about this server.

Wireless LAN Controllers and Cloud-Managed Architectures 
277
Predictive Modeling Site Survey Tools
Predictive modeling site survey tools assist in placement of access points and other wireless 
infrastructure devices. These tools are sometimes a feature of a hardware wireless LAN 
controller. Performing a predictive modeling site survey will assist in planning to determine 
coverage and capacity for data and voice for both indoor and outdoor deployments. Some 
manufacturers of cloud-managed enterprise solutions have web-based online predictive 
modeling site survey tools. Aerohive and AirTight Networks are two examples of manu-
facturers that provide these online wireless network planning tools. Visit their websites for 
more information and instructions on how to access these tools:
www.aerohive.com/planner
www.airtightnetworks.com/home/products/AirTight-Planner.html
Radio Frequency Spectrum Management
Keeping an eye on the radio frequency (RF) environment is another responsibility of the 
wireless network administrator. RF spectrum management consists of adjusting RF param-
eters such as the RF channel (frequency) and the RF transmit power after deployment. This 
allows the network to adapt to changes in the environment and assist in the event of hard-
ware failures.
Firewalls
An integrated stateful fi rewall feature helps protect a network from unauthorized Internet 
traffi c, but still allows authorized traffi c. Firewalls can be hardware based, software based, 
or a combination of the two. Stateful fi rewalls, which keep records of all connections pass-
ing through the fi rewall, help protect against broadcast storms, rogue DHCP server attacks, 
Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) poisoning, and other potential attacks against the wire-
less LAN.
Quality of Service (QoS)
QoS features help time-critical applications such as voice and video communications mini-
mize latency and allow for traffi c prioritization. With the continual expansion of voice and 
video technology in the wireless LAN arena, QoS is becoming an increasingly important 
component in the wireless network.
Infrastructure Device Redundancy
Infrastructure device redundancy allows for fault-tolerant deployments and provides unin-
terrupted access in the event an access point or wireless LAN controller fails. Complete 

278 
Chapter 6 ■ Computer Network Infrastructure Devices
redundancy will prevent a major outage caused by hardware failure for mission-critical 
or other deployments. Coverage is maintained by alternating access points between the 
redundant infrastructure devices, minimizing interruption for user access in the event of 
a hardware failure. Cloud-managed systems eliminate the need of redundant hardware 
WLAN controllers, and the technology allows for redundancy in the event of an access 
point failure.
Wireless Intrusion Prevention System (WIPS)
A WIPS monitors all activity across the wireless network for potential intrusion and 
 malicious activities. A WIPS can take appropriate action to mitigate an attack based on the 
type of intrusion. WIPS will be discussed further in Chapter 15, “Mobile Device Security 
Threats and Risks.” 
Direct and Distributed AP Connectivity
Connecting access points that are not directly plugged into a port on the wireless LAN con-
troller is a feature known as distributed AP connectivity, and it’s benefi cial in large-scale 
deployments. Almost all manufacturers support distributed AP connectivity. Direct AP 
connectivity is defi ned as a direct connection to ports on the switch, and is typically used 
with access layer hardware wireless controllers. A typical controller with distributed con-
nectivity is shown in Figure 6.14.
F I G U R E 6 .14  Meru MC6000 large-scale enterprise wireless LAN controller
Layer 2 and Layer 3 AP Connectivity
Early wireless network implementations were built with dedicated Layer 2 connectiv-
ity, which meant limited wireless mobility. Layer 2 transition (roaming) occurs when a 

Wireless LAN Controllers and Cloud-Managed Architectures 
279
computer or other wireless client device moves out of the radio cell of the currently associ-
ated access point and connects to a different AP maintaining Layer 2 connectivity.
As wireless networking technology evolved, so did the need for Layer 3 connectivity and 
transition. IP addresses are logical Layer 3 addresses that identify devices on a network. 
All IP devices on the same network or subnet are considered to be in the same IP bound-
ary. Layer 3 roaming occurs when a client moves to an AP that covers a different IP subnet. 
After a transition, the client will no longer have a valid IP address from the original subnet, 
and the device will be issued an IP address from the new subnet while maintaining Layer 3 
connectivity. 
Figure 6.15 illustrates Layer 2 and Layer 3 connectivity and wireless transition.

Distributed and Centralized Data Forwarding
Wireless LAN controller solutions consist of two common types of architectures: central-
ized and distributed. Early WLAN controller solutions supported the centralized architec-
ture (split-MAC architecture). This design separated the intelligence from the access point 
and placed it into the wireless controller to allow for centralized management and control 
of the wireless network. The access point for the most part was just a radio and antenna, 
and traffi c decisions were sent to the controller through an Ethernet cable. This technique is 
also known as centralized data forwarding. Depending on where the controller was placed, 
it could cause bottlenecks and other issues in the case of an overloaded or poorly designed 
network infrastructure. With the data rates possible with IEEE 802.11n and now IEEE 
802.11ac, the aggregate throughput could be too much for the network to handle, resulting 
in poor performance.

280 
Chapter 6 ■ Computer Network Infrastructure Devices
Distributed data forwarding reduces the amount of infrastructure traffi c because the 
controller-based access point is able to make more decisions, taking some of the load away 
from the wireless controller. Moving some of the intelligence back to the edge (the wireless 
access point) minimizes the bottlenecks and other potential issues such as latency. This is 
also true in a cloud-managed or controllerless architecture, thus eliminating the need for 
the data to be sent to the controller for handling. 
Most enterprise wireless LAN equipment manufacturers now support both the central-
ized and distributed WLAN architectures.
Power over Ethernet
PoE sends direct current (DC) voltage and computer data over the same Ethernet cable, 
enabling a device to receive DC power and computer data simultaneously. This eliminates 
the need for an external alternating current (AC) power source to be near the Ethernet 
device. 
An Ethernet cable has four copper wire pairs, or eight copper wires. Depending on the 
technology in use, either two or all four wired pairs may be used to carry data traffi c. 
Figure 6.16 shows an example of a standard Ethernet cable pin assignment.

Power over Ethernet now consists of two ratifi ed amendments to the IEEE 802.3 
standard. They are defi ned in 802.3-2012 Clause 33, also known as IEEE 802.3af, and 
IEEE 802.3at, sometimes called PoE+. These amendments defi ne the specifi cations for 
devices used in wired or wireless networking to receive DC power from the Ethernet con-
nection without the need for an external DC power source. The PoE amendments to the 
Ethernet standard allow electrical power to be supplied in one of two ways, either over the 

Power over Ethernet 
281
same wired pairs that carry computer data or over the wired pairs that do not carry data. 
10BaseT and 100BaseT (Fast Ethernet) implementations use only two wired pairs (four 
wires) to carry data. 1000BaseT (Gigabit Ethernet) may use all four pairs (eight wires) to 
carry computer data. The standard defi nes which wire pairs are allowed to carry the DC 
power based on whether the network is 10BaseT, 100BaseT, or 1000BaseT, and whether the 
power is sourced from an endpoint or midspan injector. Both midspan and endpoint injec-
tors are explained later in this chapter.
The nominal voltage for PoE is 48 volts of direct current (VDC), but the amendments 
allow for a range of 44 to 57 VDC at the power source. The PoE amendments address 
two types of devices: power sourcing equipment (PSE), the device that provides of the DC 
power, and the powered device (PD), the device that receives the DC power.
Before PoE was standardized, some manufacturers used proprietary imple-
mentations. These solutions used various voltages, polarities, and pin 
assignments and may still be on the market today. I recommend that you 
verify PoE standard compliance before using this technology, to prevent 
potential hardware or device failures.
The IEEE 802.3-2012 Clause 33 (802.3af) amendment was released in 2003 and allo-
cates 15.4 watts (W) of power maximum per port. This amendment has been incorporated 
into the IEEE 802.3-2012 standard. The IEEE 802.3at amendment, PoE+, was released in 
2009 and includes changes to add to the capabilities of the IEEE 802.3-2008 standard, 
with higher power levels and improved power management information. IEEE 802.3at 
allows for 34.2W of power per port maximum, a big increase over IEEE 802.3af, which 
allowed for 15.4 W per port. IEEE 802.3af PoE will work with access points from all man-
ufacturers of enterprise-grade IEEE 802.11n access points. Using IEEE 802.3af will make it 
easier for organizations to transition from older-model access points to the newer 802.11n 
technology, which will improve their client service and provide overall better performance 
without having to immediately upgrade their PoE infrastructure to IEEE 802.3at.
Power Sourcing Equipment
The power sourcing equipment (PSE) is the device that supplies the DC voltage to the end 
devices that receive the DC power. The DC voltage (power) can be delivered to the device in 
one of two ways:
 
■
An endpoint injector (usually a wireless LAN controller or a Layer 2 Ethernet switch) 
delivers DC power directly over the same wire pairs that carry data over the unused 
wire pairs.
 
■
A midspan injector (usually a single-port or multiple-port injector) injects DC power 
into the Ethernet cable over the unused wire pairs or over the data pairs, depending on 
the version of the standard in use.

Chapter 6 ■ Computer Network Infrastructure Devices
Midspan Injectors
Midspan PoE injectors provide the required DC voltage (48 VDC) into the Ethernet cable, 
allowing the AP, bridge, or other powered device to receive electrical power and computer 
data. There are two types of midspan devices—single-port injectors and multiport injectors. 
A single-port injector supplies power to a single device. This is useful in an implementation 
that may have only a few PoE devices. A single-port injector is an in-line device that adds 
DC power to the Ethernet cable. A multiport injector can supply DC power to many devices 
simultaneously. It is an in-line device that functions like a patch panel. Two ports on this 
device are required to supply both DC power and computer data to a single powered device 
such as an access point, bridge, or IP camera. Therefore, a 24-port injector will allow con-
nectivity for only 12 devices.
Endpoint Injectors
Endpoint PoE injectors supply DC power and computer data directly at the Ethernet port, 
rather than relying on an intermediate device to supply the power. Wireless LAN control-
lers and Ethernet switches are examples of endpoint devices. A benefi t of endpoint PoE is 
that no intermediate adapter to inject power is necessary.
Powered Devices and Classification Signatures
The powered device (PD) is defi ned as the device receiving DC power, such as a wireless 
access point, wireless bridge, IP camera, IP phone, and so on. The IEEE 802.3 standard 
defi nes the maximum cable length of an Ethernet cable to be 328 feet, or 100 meters. 
Because of line loss, the standard specifi es less maximum power than what is available at 
the port. Table 6.1 shows the maximum power allowed for both the PSE and the PD.

Equipment manufacturers have the option of defi ning a classifi cation signature. The 
classifi cation signature determines the maximum amount of power a device requires, 
thereby allowing the PSE to better manage the amount of power delivered to a specifi c 
port. The PoE amendments make fi ve classes of powered device available (class 0 through 
class 4). Table 6.2 shows the available classes and the amount of power in watts for each 
class for IEEE 802.3-2012 Clause 33 (802.3af) devices.

Benefits of PoE
There are many benefi ts to using devices that support PoE, including cost savings and con-
venience. The IEEE 802.3 standard (Ethernet) specifi es a maximum distance of 100 meters, 
or 328 feet, for unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) Category 5 (CAT5) Ethernet cable. Power 
over Ethernet enables a PoE device to receive DC power and computer data at this distance 

284 
Chapter 6 ■ Computer Network Infrastructure Devices
without the need for electrical power at the point where the device is installed or located. 
This can amount to a big cost savings if a voltage source is not available where the device is 
located, because there is no need to install electrical power at that point.
Virtual Private Network (VPN) 
Concentrators
To understand how a VPN concentrator operates, it is important to understand the basics 
of VPN technology. A VPN is a network that provides private secure communications over 
a public unsecured network infrastructure such as the Internet. VPNs are based on Internet 
Protocol. They typically operate at Layer 3 of the OSI model, but some will work at Layer 
2. Figure 6.18 illustrates VPN technology in relation to the OSI model.

Layer 2
Prior to the ratifi cation of the IEEE 802.11i amendment to the standard, wireless 
LAN VPN technology was prevalent in enterprise deployments as well as in remote 
access security solutions. Since wireless LAN Layer 2 security solutions have become 
stronger (mostly thanks to the 802.11i amendment and the Wi-Fi Alliance WPA and 
WPA2 certifi cations), VPN technology is not as widely used, if at all, within internal 
enterprise wireless LANs. However, VPNs still remain a very powerful security solution 
for remote access in IEEE standards–based wired and wireless networking, as well as 
 cellular communications.
VPNs consist of two parts—tunneling and encryption. Figure 6.19 illustrates a VPN 
tunnel using the Internet. A stand-alone VPN tunnel does not provide data encryption, 
and VPN tunnels are created across Internet Protocol (IP) networks. In a very basic sense, 
VPNs use encapsulation methods, where one IP frame is encapsulated within a second IP 
frame. The encryption of VPNs is performed as a separate function.

Shipping a Crate Using VPN Technology
An analogy for the VPN process is shipping a locked crate from one location to another. 
You are a technical support engineer for the headquarters ofﬁ ce of a company that has 
ﬁ ve ofﬁ ces in different locations around the world. You get a telephone call from a co-
worker at one of the remote ofﬁ ces. She needs to replace an access point with a newer 
model at the remote ofﬁ ce. You need to ship the preconﬁ gured replacement access point 
to her using a common carrier. You want to ensure that the access point arrives at the 
destination location without coming into physical contact with anybody other than the 
intended recipient.
The access point is analogous to the IP frame. You put the access point into a crate that 
has a combination lock to secure it. This crate containing the access point is analogous to 
the second IP frame, or the one that encapsulates the original IP frame.
You ship the crate to the destination using a common carrier, which would be analogous 
to the public infrastructure over which the encrypted data is sent. Many other packages 
are shipped by this common carrier, but no one will be able to see the contents of the 
crate because they do not know the combination to the lock (the encryption method).
When the access point arrives at the destination, the recipient (the technical support engi-
neer for the remote ofﬁ ce) must know the combination of the lock on the crate in order to 
open it to retrieve the access point. So you tell her the combination over the telephone. 
This is analogous to the encryption method. Over a secure telephone line, only you (the 
sender) and she (the recipient) know the combination to the lock. The tech support engi-
neer will be able to unlock the crate using the combination you supplied her, and she will 
be able to retrieve the access point.

286 
Chapter 6 ■ Computer Network Infrastructure Devices
There are two common types of VPN protocols:
 
■
Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)
 
■
Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP)
Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol
Developed by a vendor consortium that included Microsoft, Point-to-Point Tunneling 
Protocol (PPTP) was very popular because of its ease of confi guration, and was included 
in all Microsoft Windows operating systems starting with Windows 95. PPTP uses the 
Microsoft Point-to-Point Encryption (MPPE-128) protocol for encryption. This process 
provides both tunneling and encryption capabilities for the user’s data.
If the PPTP configuration uses Microsoft Challenge Authentication Proto-
col (MS-CHAP) version 2 for user authentication on a wireless network, it 
can be a security issue. This authentication process can be captured using 
a wireless protocol analyzer or other scanning software program, and 
potentially allow someone to perform a dictionary attack, allowing them 
to acquire a user’s credentials and eventually giving them the capability to 
log on to the network. A dictionary attack is performed by software that 
challenges the encrypted password against common words or phrases in 
a text file (dictionary). Therefore, using PPTP on a wireless network should 
be avoided. Keep in mind that the security vulnerability is not PPTP itself; it 
is that the authentication frames on a wireless LAN can be captured by an 
intruder, who can then acquire user credentials (username and password) 
and be able to gain access to the VPN.
Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol
Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) is the combination of two different tunneling proto-
cols: Cisco’s Layer 2 Forwarding (L2F) and Microsoft’s Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol 
(PPTP). L2TP defi nes the tunneling process, which requires some level of encryption in 
order to function. With L2TP, a popular choice of encryption is Internet Protocol Security 
(IPsec), which provides authentication and encryption for each IP packet in a data stream. 
Since L2TP was published in 1999 as a proposed standard, and because it is more secure 
than PPTP, L2TP has gained much popularity and for the most part is a replacement for 
PPTP. L2TP/IPsec is a common VPN solution in use today. PPTP should not be used when 
L2TP is available.

Virtual Private Network (VPN) Concentrators 
287
Components of a VPN Solution
A VPN solution consists of three components:
 
■
Client side (endpoint)
 
■
Network infrastructure (public or private)
 
■
Server side/VPN concentrator (endpoint)
In many cases, both the client side and the server side (which may consist of a VPN 
concentrator appliance) are known as VPN endpoints. The concentrator is the association 
between the public network and the private network infrastructures. The public infrastruc-
ture in many cases is a public access network such as the Internet. The client-side endpoint 
typically consists of software, allowing it to be confi gured for the VPN. This software is 
available at a nominal cost from a variety of manufacturers. Newer Microsoft Windows 
operating systems include VPN client software for both PPTP and L2TP. Figure 6.20 shows 
a VPN client confi guration screen.

288 
Chapter 6 ■ Computer Network Infrastructure Devices
Many wireless client devices also have the capability to be a VPN client endpoint. 
The VPN can terminate either at an access point or across the Internet to the corporate 
network. Figure 6.21 shows a common example of a wireless client device connecting 
to a wireless hotspot to access the corporate network via a VPN concentrator hardware 
appliance.

Network Gateways
The term gateway may have different meanings in computer networking, and is sometimes 
misunderstood or interpreted differently. Technically, a network gateway is an interface 
that allows computer networks using different protocol sets to connect together and share 
information. Gateways can be based on software or on hardware appliances/computers. 
The wireless broadband router discussed earlier in this chapter is one very basic example 
of a network gateway. A wireless broadband router has the capability to connect IEEE 
802.3 network devices and IEEE 802.11 network devices to the Internet. All three of these 
networks (802.3, 802.11, and the Internet) use different protocol sets, while still allowing 

Proxy Servers

information sharing across all of the networks. Figure 6.22 shows an example of how a 
network gateway may be part of a computer network.

If you are using a Microsoft Windows–based computer, you may be familiar with the 
term default gateway. This type of gateway is the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the 
router port that connects the locally connected LAN segment to a remotely connected LAN 
segment via a network router.
Proxy Servers
In a general sense, the word proxy means to act or perform on behalf of another person. In 
computer networking terminology, a proxy is a server or hardware appliance  middleman 
between a user or device on a private network and a destination server across another 
 network, which can include a WAN or the Internet. 

294 
Chapter 6 ■ Computer Network Infrastructure Devices
A proxy server can be used for a variety of items:
 
■
Web page caching
 
■
Network address obfuscation
 
■
Bandwidth preservation
 
■
Logging 
 
■
Content filtering
We will examine each item on the preceding list later. But fi rst, I believe a simple 
analogy will help you better understand the function of a proxy server. Suppose you are 
taking yourself and a guest to dinner at a restaurant. 
Upon entering a restaurant, you and your guest are greeted by a host or hostess. You 
are seated at a table and given menus. A waiter comes to your table, introduces himself as 
your server, and tells you he will be back in a few minutes to take your order. When the 
server returns to your table, you and your guest will tell him what you would like to order 
for your meals. The server documents the order for each person and takes it to the kitchen. 
The chef prepares your meals according to each order, and lets the server know when they 
are ready to be picked up. The server returns to your table and distributes the meals for 
each person. The server is the only person who knows what each person ordered, and the 
chef was instructed to prepare the meals but has no idea which person ordered what meals. 
Figure 6.23 illustrates this analogy.

Now look at this analogy from a technology perspective. The dining room represents 
your offi ce or business. You and your guest seated at the table represent users or devices 
on the local area network. The waiter represents your proxy server, and the kitchen is the 
Internet. The chef is a web server contained somewhere within the Internet. Think about 
the list of features earlier in this section that a proxy server can provide, and further tie that 
list to this restaurant analogy. The waiter is able to communicate with each person who is 
ordering their meal. This equates to each person being identifi ed by a unique IP address on 
the LAN. The waiter is the proxy server and knows what meal should be delivered to each 
person. The chef, a web server on the Internet, is on a different computer subnet and has 
a completely different IP address than the people who ordered the meals. The waiter inter-
faces with each side (the chef and dinner guests), and therefore understands the addresses 
of both networks. The waiter is acting as the network translator, knowing where to deliver 
each meal. Figure 6.24 illustrates the concept of a proxy server handling a request from a 
client device.

Now let’s take a look at some of the features proxy servers may provide.
Web Page Caching  This feature allows a proxy server to cache or temporarily store web 
pages that were visited by a user on the network. If another user were to make a request 

296 
Chapter 6 ■ Computer Network Infrastructure Devices
for the same pages, the server would be able to quickly deliver the content to the second 
user without having to retrieve the page(s) again from an Internet web server. In addition to 
improving the user’s experience, it will help with the bandwidth usage.
Network Address Obfuscation  IP address obfuscation allows a proxy server to hide local 
internal IP addresses from outside servers and devices. This network translator, in addition 
to a fi rewall, provides some level of security from outside the local network.
Bandwidth Preservation  Because the proxy server has the capability to cache web pages 
based on requests from users on the internal network, this feature will save on wide area 
network bandwidth. If the server is able to deliver the pages directly to the requesting user, 
then the WAN bandwidth can be used for other internetworking tasks.
Logging  Logging any kind information about a computer network can be an invaluable 
tool. Proxy servers have the capability to log various types of information, including who 
the users are, what content the users accessed, and what sites or networks were visited. 
Any cleartext information is recorded and can be evaluated at a later time for forensics or 
troubleshooting purposes.
Content Filtering  This feature provides ways for an organization to have some level of 
control over what type of website content users are accessing from the computer network 
at the workplace. This will prevent users from potentially using the network for non-
company-related tasks and wasting valuable company network resources. Content fi ltering 
may also serve as way to prevent some security threats like malicious software (malware) 
from gaining access to the corporate network.
Summary
This chapter discussed network infrastructure devices, which are commonly used to 
provide wireless connectivity to a computer network for computers and other wireless client 
devices. The infrastructure devices include the access point (an integral part of the wireless 
LAN and available as a self-contained intelligent, or autonomous, device), a controller-
based device for use with hardware wireless LAN controllers, and a cloud-based access 
point that provides user and client device access to network resources. Other infrastructure 
devices include wireless broadband routers for SOHO or home use, wireless bridges for 
connecting LANs together, and wireless repeaters for extending an RF cell. 
This chapter also explored some of the features, benefi ts, and applications of these 
infrastructure devices. In addition, we took a look at the two Power over Ethernet (PoE) 
amendments (IEEE 802.3-2012 Clause 33, also referred to as 802.3af, and IEEE 802.3at), 
components, the DC voltage and amount of DC power supplied to devices (in watts), and 
how the power may be delivered to a powered device. Finally, you learned about the basics 
of additional infrastructure devices, including virtual private network (VPN) concentra-
tors, network gateways, and proxy servers.

Remember the function and features of the different access point technologies.  Compare 
and contrast the features of autonomous, controller-based, and cloud-based access points. 
Know that autonomous access points are self-contained units, and controller-based access 
points work with wireless LAN controllers. Cloud-based access points do not require a 
hardware controller, but use cloud-based software for confi guration and management.

In earlier chapters you learned about radio frequency and 
communications based on IEEE 802.11 standards. In this 
chapter we will explore the common communications methods 
used with wireless mobile devices and cellular technology. Starting with fi rst generation 
(1G) in the early 1980s, cellular technology has evolved, with new advanced wireless 
technologies appearing about every 10 years. The most current cellular technology, fourth 
generation (4G), started appearing around 2008. We will take a quick look at the evolution 
of these different generations of cellular technology. 
Networks of any type, wired or wireless, need some way of accessing the medium used 
for the communications. Wired Ethernet networks use Carrier Sense Multiple Access with 
Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) and wireless IEEE 802.11 networks use Carrier Sense 
Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA).
Cellular networks also require an access method of some sort to access the medium; in 
this case, the medium is the air. I will explain the common access methods used with the 
various generations of cellular technology. In addition to an access method, cellular net-
works must use protocols to effectively exchange information. We will examine the differ-
ent protocols used with wireless cellular technology. We will also take a look at Worldwide 
Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX), which falls under the IEEE 802.16 wire-
less standard. Finally, will take a look at roaming between different network types, includ-
ing Wi-Fi and cellular.

Communications
In earlier chapters you learned about various aspects of wireless communications. This 
includes, but is not limited to, the following:
 
■
Radio frequency characteristics and behaviors
 
■
Antenna technology fundamentals
 
■
The RF spectrum, including licensed and unlicensed bands
 
■
IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN technology

The Evolution of Cellular Communications 
301
Wireless communication technologies of various types have been in use worldwide for 
decades and utilize both the unlicensed and licensed radio frequency bands. Commercial, 
private, and government sectors use a combination of proprietary and standards-based 
solutions and devices for wireless connectivity. Staying connected through the use of mobile 
devices is becoming a major part of our daily lives. Here you will learn the basic funda-
mentals of wireless technologies used with cellular communications and mobile devices and 
how they relate to indoor network usage and management.
The fi rst mobile wireless technology used was known as Zero Generation (0G). This 
preceded what we know today as wireless cellular technology. 0G was a mobile radio 
telephone technology, not cellular communications. This pre-cellular mobile telephone 
technology worked with the Mobile Telephone System (MTS) protocol. The telephones 
were usually large, heavy, and expensive. Some were carried in briefcases or backpacks or 
mounted in a vehicle, which is how the phrase car phone was coined. Let’s now take a look 
at the different generations of wireless cellular technology, as shown in Figure 7.1.

Chapter 7 ■ Cellular Communication Technology
First Generation (1G)
First generation (1G) cellular communications started in the early 1980s. Using analog 
transmission mechanisms and operating in the 800 to 900 MHz frequency range, 1G was 
used only for voice communications and was not very secure. The following items were key 
features of 1G:
 
■
Limited to analog communications only
 
■
Capable of download speeds of about 28.8 to 56 kilobits per second (Kbps) 
 
■
Used Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS) technology
 
■
Had Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) support
The speed of 1G was fairly slow by today’s standards but was adequate for the technol-
ogy at the time. AMPS was a cellular communication standard created by Bell Labs and 
implemented in the late 1970s in the United States and in the 1980s in other countries. 
First generation (1G) cell phones were expensive and could be heavy. One specifi c model is 
shown in Figure 7.2. First generation cellular systems used AMPS technology for commu-
nications, and in late 2000, wireless carriers in the United States were no longer required to 
support AMPS. Most if not all wireless carriers no longer provide the service, which meant 
the end of 1G technology.

Second Generation (2G)
2G second generation cellular is what started the transition from analog-only communi-
cations to digital communications for cellular users. First used in 1991, second generation 
(2G) signifi ed the continued evolution of digital cellular technology. Second generation 
(2G) cellular technology included the following features:
 
■
Digital communications
 
■
Varied speeds based on how it was used
 
■
Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) support
 
■
Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) support
 
■
Global Standard for Mobile Communications (GSM) technology
New advancements in cellular wireless technology allowed for digital communications 
with second generation (2G) cellular. Through the use of Global Standard for Mobile 
Communications (GSM) and newer access methods, the speeds and performance increased, 
providing a better user experience. 2G also offered a greater call capacity because multi-
plexing and compression of the digital data is better achieved with digital communications 
rather than with older analog communications. This in turn allowed for more calls to take 
place using the same amount of radio frequency spectrum. 2G is still in use today and is 
popular in various parts of the world.
Third Generation (3G)
Third generation (3G) technology was approved for use in the United States and imple-
mented by cellular wireless carriers in early 2000. 3G technology provided faster data 
transmission, more network capacity, and additional advanced services along with the 
following features:
 
■
Speeds of up to 200 Kbps
 
■
Wireless broadband speeds of up to about 2 megabits per second (Mbps) based on 3.5G 
and 3.75G technologies
 
■
Wireless voice, Internet access, video calls, and TV capable
 
■
Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) support
 
■
Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS)
Third generation (3G) technology provided better call quality, coverage, capacity, 
security, and capabilities.

Chapter 7 ■ Cellular Communication Technology
Fourth Generation (4G)
The newest wireless cellular technology is known as fourth generation (4G). This technol-
ogy fi rst became available around 2008 in the United States but was not widely adopted 
until 2011. 4G actually consists of several different technologies, including LTE and 
WiMAX. 4G includes the following features:
 
■
IP-based wireless mobile device support
 
■
Data speeds that vary from 100 Mbps to 1 Gbps, depending on the implementation 
 
■
Used for digital voice and data
 
■
Enhanced security
 
■
Long Term Evolution (LTE) technology
 
■
Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) support
All newer mobile cell phones support fourth generation (4G). However, the technology 
is not available in all areas or countries. If a 4G service is not available, the mobile device 
is backward compatible and will drop to 3G. Figure 7.3 shows several new technology 4G 
mobile phones.

According to the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), “organiza-

tially were developed to create specifications for 3G mobile devices based 
on GSM. This was later expanded to include the development and mainte-
nance of GSM, GPRS, and EDGE. For more information on the role of 3GPP,

Channel Access Methods
Channel access methods give devices connected to a common transmission medium the 
opportunity to communicate and send information across that network medium from one 
device to another. Several types of channel access methods are used in mobile and cellular 
communications. We will explore the following types in this chapter:
 
■
Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA)
 
■
Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)
 
■
Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)

306 
Chapter 7 ■ Cellular Communication Technology
Frequency Division Multiple Access
In Chapter 3, “Radio Frequency and Antenna Technology Fundamentals,” you learned 
about the basic radio frequency characteristics, which include wavelength, frequency, 
amplitude, and phase. Frequency is the number of complete cycles the sine wave repeats as 
the result of an electrical current varying uniformly in voltage in 1 second. Low frequencies 
correspond to long radio waves and high frequencies to short radio waves, so the higher the 
frequency, the shorter the wavelength. 
The Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) method can be broken down as 
follows:
 
■
Frequency Division: The frequency is divided into small sections to be used by several 
devices simultaneously.
 
■
Multiple Access: Many devices access the transmission medium at the same time 
within the same radio frequency space.
As the name implies, FDMA allows for multiple connections across a specifi ed fre-
quency range. These 30 KHz wide RF channels provide one channel for each call and use 
full duplex communication. Full duplex allows for two-way communication (transmit and 
receive simultaneously). In addition, FDMA is not limited to only analog voice calls. It can 
also be used to carry digital data if confi gured as such. The downside to FDMA is that only 
one device at a time can communicate while the channel is in use, and that is not an effi -
cient use of the radio frequency spectrum. 
Figure 7.4 shows how the frequency band is divided into smaller RF channels.

In this example, each mobile device is using a 30 KHz channel to communicate. That 
frequency channel can service only one device (voice call) at a time. Therefore, each device 
has that frequency space allocated for its use only during the duration of the call.

Channel Access Methods 
307
Time Division Multiple Access
Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) is another channel access method that allows for 
network communications using a shared medium. TDMA allows several users to use the 
same frequency channel by dividing the radio frequency channel into different slots of time. 
Time Division Multiple Access can be broken down as follows:
 
■
Time Division: Each device is allocated a specific time slot of the channel to use for 
transmissions.
 
■
Multiple Access: Many devices access the transmission medium within the same radio 
frequency space.
Every device that is accessing the medium will have its own time slot, and the slices of 
time will vary from device to device. Global Standard for Mobile Communications (GSM) 
is based on TDMA. Using a 200 KHz wide radio frequency band, TDMA will allow for 
up to eight voice transmissions on this single RF channel. GSM is discussed in more detail 
later in this chapter. 
Figure 7.5 illustrates the TDMA process.

You can see in Figure 7.5 that there are several wireless mobile telephones accessing the 
same 200 KHz wide channel. This is different from the previously mentioned FDMA because 
with that technology, each device is assigned its own channel to use. In this example, four 
devices are sharing the same channel but are each allocated their own time interval.

308 
Chapter 7 ■ Cellular Communication Technology
Code Division Multiple Access
This access method is based on spread spectrum technology and allows for several trans-
mitters to send information simultaneously over a single radio frequency communications 
channel. This will in turn allow several mobile devices to communicate on the same RF 
channel by uniquely identifying their own transmissions. 
Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) can be broken down as follows:
 
■
Code Division: Devices share the same frequency channel by using a unique transmis-
sion code.
 
■
Multiple Access: Many devices access the transmission medium within the same radio 
frequency space.
You learned about direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) in Chapter 5, “IEEE 802.11 
Terminology and Technology.” CDMA uses this same method by combining data bits with 
a common unique code known by the transmitter and its receiver. In the case of HR/DSSS, 
the coding is either Barker code or complementary code keying. With a Boolean algebra 
process known as exclusive OR (XOR), the single data stream bits are combined to create a 
code that is spread across the entire radio frequency channel that is in use. 
Figure 7.6 shows a single digital data bit of 1 that is combined with a unique code to 
give the resultant data stream that was created with the exclusive OR (XOR) process. The 
result is what is known as a series of chips (which is the effect of combining a single digital 
data bit with a unique binary code).

By using this coding technique, CDMA will allow several devices to transmit at the same 
time using a common frequency band. This is a fairly effi cient use of the radio frequency 
spectrum and is possible because of digital multiplexing technology. As cellular technolo-
gies continue to evolve, some wireless carriers will eventually phase out CDMA technology 
in favor of technology advancements such as Long Term Evolution (LTE). Even though 
CDMA will still be supported in the foreseeable future, you can expect newer cellular 
phones to no longer have that capability. Of course, this depends on the part of the world 
in which you reside.

Circuit Switching vs. Packet Switching Network Technology

Circuit Switching vs. Packet Switching 
Network Technology
Before we explore the different telecommunications methods, protocols, and standards 
used with cellular networks, it will be benefi cial to get a basic understanding of two com-
mon communications technologies used to get data and other information from a source 
node to a destination node. This could be as simple as a telephone call using an analog 
phone or using wireless cellular technology via a smartphone. These two methods are as 
follows:
 
■
Circuit switching via Circuit Switched Data (CSD)
 
■
Packet switching
Circuit Switched Data
Circuit Switched Data (CSD) technology requires that a dedicated physical circuit or chan-
nel be in place during the entire conversation for the information (or data) exchange. One 
analogy to this is the public-switched telephone network (PSTN) that is used to make a 
telephone call using a standard copper cable. Basically, when a call is initiated, a direct con-
nection “circuit” is created between the two telephones across the entire network and will 
remain intact until the telephone conversation ends or either party hangs up the telephone 
to end the call (see Figure 7.7). Although reliable, this method is older technology and is 
expensive due the need to create the dedicated reliable circuits for each call.
Circuit Switched Data (CSD) was designed to operate with TDMA systems such as 
GSM (discussed later in this chapter). TDMA uses slices, or slots, of time within a radio 
frequency channel, allowing transmitters to send their data during that time period. Each 
period of time allowed is for some specifi c amount of data to be sent.

Dedicated “Circuit” between Each Telephone/Device

310 
Chapter 7 ■ Cellular Communication Technology
Global Standard for Mobile Communications (GSM) uses Circuit Switched Data and is 
discussed later in this chapter. 
Packet Switching
A packet-switched network uses TCP/IP for communications. In this scenario, there is not 
a set path or dedicated circuit as in circuit switching. Packets (small blocks) of information 
may use various routes to get to the destination. A basic example of packet switching is 
shown in Figure 7.8. Due to the nature of this type of communications, it is not as reliable 
as circuit switching and can result in issues such as congestion, packet loss, and latency. 
There are two major packet-switching modes. The fi rst one is connectionless packet 
switching, which is also known as datagram switching. This type of packet switching is 
not considered guaranteed delivery. It uses connectionless protocols such as Ethernet, IP, 
and UDP. In this method, each packet includes complete addressing or routing information. 
The packets are routed individually, sometimes resulting in different paths and out-of-order 
delivery. The second packet switching mode is connection-oriented packet switching, also 
known as virtual circuit switching. It is generally considered to be a guaranteed delivery. 
The packets include a connection identifi er rather than address information and are deliv-
ered in order.

You can see in Figure 7.8 that the data stream is broken into smaller pieces at the source 
node and is sent across different routes (paths) on the network based on the conditions and 
the best route to take. Once the data is received at the destination, it is reassembled into 
the message that was sent by the source. This is different from a circuit-switched network, 
where a dedicated circuit is created between the source and destination nodes.

Mobile Device Standards and Protocols 
311
Mobile Device Standards and Protocols
In the following sections, we will examine the different technologies that operate with cel-
lular networks for both voice and data communications. As this technology evolved over 
the past 30 years, so has the need for better and faster communications. In addition to 
voice, this includes data and Internet connections for use with a variety of mobile devices, 
including cellular telephones, tablets, notebook computers, and others. Mobile devices have 
become more sophisticated and are loaded with new technology features, for the most part 
allowing a “one-stop shop” for communications to satisfy voice and data needs. The fol-
lowing protocols and standards are used with cellular voice and data communications:
 
■
Global Standard for Mobile Communications (GSM)
 
■
General Packet Radio Service (GPRS)
 
■
Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE)
 
■
Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS)
 
■
Evolution Data Optimized (EVDO)
 
■
High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA)
 
■
High Speed Uplink Packet Access (HSUPA)
 
■
High Speed Packet Access (HSPA)
 
■
Evolved High Speed Packet Access (HSPA+)
 
■
Long Term Evolution (LTE)
Let’s take a quick look at each of these technologies. This will give you perspective on 
each technology and help you to see how mobile device standards and protocols have con-
tinued to evolve with the need for more advanced mobile wireless devices.
Global Standard for Mobile Communications
Implemented in the early 1990s, Global Standard for Mobile Communications (GSM) is a 
standard developed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and 
was fi rst used with second generation (2G) networks to allow digital cellular data com-
munication for mobile devices and to replace fi rst generation (1G) systems that were analog 
based. GSM then became the standard for mobile communications, with over 80 percent 
market share worldwide. GSM initially used Circuit Switch Data (CSD) technology, which 
was explained earlier in this chapter. Because CSD is used with GSM, it allows for data 
rates only up to 14.4 Kbps. GSM mobile devices use a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) 
card. This electronic circuit card is removable and contains a unique identifi cation number 
(serial number), and the user can store their unique data on the card.

312 
Chapter 7 ■ Cellular Communication Technology
General Packet Radio Service
General Packet Radio Service was fi rst implemented in the late 1990s. Unlike GSM, which 
was circuit-switched technology, this technology involves a packet-switched mobile proto-
col used with 2G and 3G cellular systems and allows for both voice and data communica-
tions. GPRS allows for faster speeds of up to 114 Kbps and additional capabilities. GPRS 
was originally developed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). 
It is now maintained by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). GPRS falls between 
second generation (2G) and third generation (3G) cellular technologies and is commonly 
referred to as 2.5G. 
Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution
The year 2003 is when Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) was fi rst 
deployed in the United States. EDGE is a pre-3G technology that, as the name implies, 
provides greater data transmission rates; it is a backward-compatible extension of GSM 
technology. Like GPRS, EDGE used packet-switching technology for data transmissions. In 
order for EDGE to operate on the infrastructure, wireless carriers needed to upgrade their 
systems to support the technology. The fi rst wireless carrier to use EDGE technology was 
the company that designed it, Cingular. After some rebranding and other reorganizations, 
Cingular was acquired by AT&T in late 2006. Like GPRS technology, EDGE actually is an 
interim technology between second generation (2G) and third generation (3G) cellular tech-
nologies and is commonly referred to as 2.75G. 
Universal Mobile Telecommunications System
Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) is a 3G mobile system for cellular 
networks based on the GSM standard. UTMS fi rst appeared in implementations in 2001. 
This technology is not backward compatible to GSM and requires new infrastructure and 
equipment. However, wireless carriers can provide support for multiple technologies. The 
data rates are up to 384 Kbps for downlink speeds and 128 Kbps uplink speeds, which is 
higher than the previous technologies mentioned. Keep in mind that additional technolo-
gies used with UTMS may provide much faster data speeds. A few examples are HSPA+ 
42 Mbps and HSPDA 7.2 Mbps. GSM uses circuit-switching (CSD) technology, and GPRS 
uses packet-switching technology. UMTS differs from them in that it can support both cir-
cuit- and packet-switching technologies.
Evolution Data Optimized
Evolution Data Optimized (EVDO) is a standard for fast wireless broadband Internet 
access. A cable modem or digital subscriber line (DSL) will provide high-speed Internet 
access, and EVDO was designed to accomplish the same task. This technology can be part 

Mobile Device Standards and Protocols 
313
of the mobile wireless cellular device (cell phone) or it could be in the form of a separate 
external adapter that would plug into a PC Card slot (legacy) or USB port on a computer. 
First generation EVDO provided data rates of about 2 Mbps downlink and about 150 Kbps 
uplink. Enhancements to the technology over several revisions support much higher speeds 
of up to 14.7 Mbps. EVDO is for data-only communications and not used for voice calls. A 
mobile cellular phone that is EVDO capable will use other communications technologies, 
such as GSM, for voice phone calls. Because of advances in cellular technology such as 4G 
and LTE, some carriers in parts of the world will be terminating CDMA communications 
within the next decade. Therefore, EVDO will no longer be available in those areas.
High Speed Downlink Packet Access
With the continued evolution of wireless cellular protocols, fast speeds are a natural pro-
gression. High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) is a packet-switching technology 
that allows for much higher downlink data transmission speeds. HSDPA is commonly 
identifi ed as 3.5G technology because it is an enhancement to the third generation (3G) 
technology. Depending on the technology used, the data rates can be as high as 20 Mbps. 
This would be with multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) technology utilizing a 5 MHz 
wide RF channel.
High Speed Uplink Packet Access
This protocol, commonly referred to as 3.75G, is another interim technology in the third 
generation (3G) technology evolution. High Speed Uplink Packet Access (HSUPA) works 
with the previously mentioned HSPDA. The high uplink data rates will enhance the 
user experience for device-to-device communications for a variety of application types. 
Depending on the technology used, HSUPA provides uplink data rates of up to 5.8 Mbps.
High Speed Packet Access
This newer third generation (3G) protocol is a derivation of the two previously mentioned 
protocols, High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) and High Speed Uplink Packet 
Access (HSUPA). It provides an enhancement for the performance of 3G mobile networks 
utilizing the WCDMA protocols. HSPA is the predecessor to Evolved High Speed Packet 
Access (HSPA+).
Evolved High Speed Packet Access
This new technology provides faster uplink and downlink data rates Like HSPDA, Evolved 
High Speed Packet Access (HSPA+) is multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) technol-
ogy and is capable of 2x2 MIMO utilizing 64 quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) 
for higher data rates. The uplink speeds can be as high as 10.8 Mbps and downlink data 

314 
Chapter 7 ■ Cellular Communication Technology
rates can be up to 84 Mbps based on the 5 MHz RF channel width. HPSA+ provides higher 
speeds for wireless broadband users.
Long Term Evolution
The most recent standard for wireless communication of high-speed data for mobile phones 
and other devices is known as Long Term Evolution (LTE). This technology is often pro-
moted as fourth generation 4G LTE. It is based on the GSM, EDGE, UMTS, and HSPA 
network technologies, increasing the capacity and speed using a different radio interface 
together with core network improvements. The motivation for creating LTE technology 
was faster data rates and better quality of service. LTE is based on Internet Protocol (IP) 
and supports Internet-accessible applications such as World Wide Web (WWW) browsing, 
email, VoIP, and more. The support for LTE depends on your geographic area. Figure 7.9 
shows a coverage map for the Sprint wireless LTE network. The places where LTE is avail-
able are shown with the solid dots.
F I G U R E  7. 9   Sprint’s LTE coverage map of the United States
WiMAX
The Wi-Fi Alliance provides interoperability certifi cations for IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN 
devices. Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) is the wireless broad-
band equivalent to the Wi-Fi Alliance. The WiMAX forum (www.wimax.org), established in 

Roaming between Different Network Types 
315
June 2001, provides interoperability certifi cations for WiMAX wireless broadband commu-
nications based on the IEEE 802.16 standard. 
WiMAX is sometimes confused with IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi technology. They are differ-
ent technologies and are specifi ed under different IEEE standards, but they do have similar 
characteristics. Both Wi-Fi and WiMAX technology operate at Layer 1 (the Physical layer) 
and Layer 2 (the Data Link layer) of the OSI model.  One distinct difference between the 
two technologies is that Wi-Fi is contention based and WiMAX is connection orientated. 
The data rates that WiMAX supports can be fairly high. Depending on the conditions 
and how it is used (for example, with an external USB adapter or with a mobile telephone), 
30 to 40 Mbps is not unrealistic. 
WiMAX has had its share of ups and downs. One major provider, Clearwire Inc., was a 
major player in the US market and was working on large scale deployments throughout the 
Unites States. Although they previously had part ownership, Sprint acquired 100 percent of 
Clearwire in June 2013. Since that time, Sprint has been shifting from the WiMAX side in 
favor of building its own LTE network. 
Roaming between Different Network 
Types
When a wireless device moves from one service area to another service area, it is said to be 
roaming or transitioning between networks. This can happen for a variety of reasons. 
In Chapter 6, “Computer Network Infrastructure Devices,” we looked at roaming from 
an IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN perspective. You learned that the decision to roam between 
access points in an IEEE 802.11 wireless network is always made by the wireless client 
device. That decision is based on different criteria, depending on how the manufacturer of 
the device chooses to implement it. You also saw that IEEE 802.11 roaming is now stan-
dardized through the IEEE 802.11r amendment, but most manufacturers of wireless LAN 
equipment use proprietary mechanisms on the infrastructure side. Just as in wireless LAN 
technology, cellular systems use radio coverage areas to allow wireless mobile devices to 
connect to a wireless provider’s network. 
With the advancements in wireless mobile device technology, modern cellular phones are 
also IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi capable, IEEE 802.15 Bluetooth capable, and in some cases, IEEE 
802.16 WiMAX capable. This allows the user of the mobile device to use either the cel-
lular network or another network type depending on whether it will be used for voice calls 
or data. One thing to keep in mind is that different technologies use different mechanisms 
to allow a wireless client device to connect to a wireless infrastructure. For example, if an 
IEEE 802.11 device wants to connect to an infrastructure access point, it must perform an 
IEEE 802.11 authentication and association. You learned about that process in Chapter 5. 
As long as the device has a matching set of capabilities (such as SSID and security param-
eters), it will successfully connect or roam to a comparable access point. However, for a 
cellular telephone to connect to a wireless carrier’s service, the process is more complex. 

316 
Chapter 7 ■ Cellular Communication Technology
Cellular phones are identifi ed with unique numbers to allow them to be identifi ed. The fol-
lowing kinds of identifi cation numbers are used:
 
■
Electronic serial number (ESN)
 
■
Mobile equipment identifier (MEID)
 
■
Mobile identification number (MIN)
 These numbers will allow a cellular phone to connect to and use the cellular network. 
They are also used when a phone roams from one cellular tower to another. You can con-
nect to and roam within IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs that are home or corporate based at 
no charge. One exception is a paid wireless hotspot such as in a hotel. Cellular networks 
charge the user of the device to pay fees, usually monthly, to use the cellular network. 
Therefore, these unique numbers are required for the device to be used. When wireless 
mobile devices are capable of connecting to different network types (such as Wi-Fi and 
3G cellular) and are used within the a building, it makes perfect sense to use the best and 
most cost-effective way to communicate. When a smartphone that is Wi-Fi capable and 
connected to a Wi-Fi network is used, the voice calls still traverse the cellular network, as 
do any text messages. The Wi-Fi network is used for web browsing and email and for most 
other data applications.
In some cases, the decision of which network the mobile device will use is automatic. 
In other cases, it could be a manual confi guration on the device itself. Unless your cellular 
service plan includes unlimited data usage (which is getting to be rare), it would be best to 
use the Wi-Fi network for data exchanges. This would eliminate the data usage charges 
because the cellular 3G, 4G, or LTE network is not providing that service for the mobile 
device at that time.
Summary
In this chapter you learned the basics of the common communication methods used with 
mobile devices and cellular technology. Cellular technology started this evolution in the 
early 1980s and continued with new technologies about every 10 years. We looked at some 
of the details and features of each of the generations. You learned that fi rst generation (1G) 
used analog communications and voice communications only and 2G, 3G, and 4G use digi-
tal technologies that are capable of both voice and data communications, including high-
speed Internet access via mobile broadband technology. 
You also learned that cellular networks require an access method to access the medium, 
which in this case is the air. This chapter covered Frequency Division Multiple Access 
(FDMA), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), and Code Division Multiple Access 
(CDMA).

The access method was determined by the type of cellular protocols used and the gen-
eration in which they were used. We explored the protocols cellular networks must use to 
effectively exchange voice and network data:

You also learned about the highlights of Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave 
Access (WiMAX) technology. WiMAX falls under metropolitan area networks (MANs), 
which is standardized as IEEE 802.16. Finally, we looked at wireless mobile devices roam-
ing between different types of networks such as cellular and Wi-Fi within a physical build-
ing or structure. 
Chapter Essentials
Understand the different generations of cellular technology.  Starting with slower, analog-
only fi rst generation (1G) technology and evolving to digital communications with second 
generation (2G), third generation (3G), and fourth generation (4G), cellular technology con-
tinues to evolve and provide a better user experience.
Be familiar with the different channel access methods used with cellular technology.  
Understand that FDMA uses 30 KHz wide channels that can carry only one call at a time. 
TDMA allows for multiple devices to use the same frequency by giving each device a spe-
cifi c time slot to transmit. CDMA uses unique coding methods that allow multiple devices 
to use the same RF channel.
Understand the different ways data can traverse infrastructures.  Circuit-switched net-
works use dedicated circuits to create connections between nodes. Packet-switched net-
works use TCP/IP for communications. In this situation, there is no set path or dedicated

In this chapter you will learn about the details of wireless site 
surveys for both IEEE 802.11 wireless networks and indoor 
cellular connectivity. We will explore site survey planning and 
the business aspects related to a wireless network site survey, including gathering business 
requirements, interviewing the appropriate people, and gathering additional information 
about the location in which the network will be installed. 
You will learn about site survey requirements such as understanding the business 
requirements for the intended use of the wireless LAN and asking plenty of questions by 
interviewing department managers and users to help determine the applications and secu-
rity requirements for the proposed network. Gathering information is a major part of a site 
survey to ensure a successful deployment.
You will also learn about the importance of documenting every step, from the design 
to the installation, and the importance of validating the wireless network, a process com-
monly known as a post survey. It is important to have all the necessary groundwork prior 
to starting a physical wireless RF site survey. Having all the correct information in hand 
will allow for a complete and thorough survey, which in turn will result in a successful 
wireless network deployment. In this chapter, you will see some of the components of per-
forming an RF wireless site survey, including determining areas of RF coverage and inter-
ference by using a spectrum analyzer. Taking into consideration both Wi-Fi and non-Wi-Fi 
interference sources and understanding how this interference will affect the deployment 
are also important parts of performing a site survey. We will also look at different types of 
site surveys, both manual and predictive modeling. You will learn about the two types of 
manual site surveys, passive and active, and see the advantages and disadvantages of both. 
Understanding the steps involved and the details of each site survey type will help a wireless 
engineer determine the best methodology to use. You will see some of the tools that may 
be used in a wireless site survey, including spectrum analyzers, wireless protocol analyzers, 
and wireless scanners. Finally, we will look at the two different types of channel architec-
ture and best practices for hardware placement, including access points and antennas, as 
well as some of the limitations you may encounter during the physical site survey process.
Wireless Site Surveys
Early deployments for wireless networks in many cases required only a one-time site survey. 
This is because wireless networking technology was fairly static and the radio frequency 
dynamics of the locations in which these networks were installed did not change much. The 
main goal for early deployments was to provide adequate RF coverage. However, thanks 

Wireless Site Surveys

to the rapid pace at which wireless technology is growing and the increasing use of other 
devices that use unlicensed radio frequency, site surveys can be an ongoing process for the 
areas where these wireless networks are installed. Although there are no set rules about 
when or how wireless site surveys should be performed, there are guidelines that many 
manufacturers suggest based on the deployment scenarios for wireless networks using their 
equipment. Best practices and experience also play a role in the site survey process.
The term wireless site survey can be subjective. A site survey may include walking an 
area checking for RF coverage and interference, planning for network capacity, and design-
ing the wireless network. A wireless site survey includes the following main objectives:
 
■
Evaluate areas for radio frequency coverage.
 
■
Locate and mitigate any sources of radio frequency interference.
 
■
Determine wireless network capacity requirements.
 
■
Decide on locations for hardware infrastructure devices.
 
■
Identify the antenna types to be used.
Site surveys vary in complexity, depending on the type of business or location in which 
a wireless network will be used. Many organizations are now designing wireless networks 
based on an average of three to four wireless mobile devices per user. The devices may 
include computers, smartphones, and tablets and can have a major impact on capacity 
planning.
As mentioned earlier, there is not a specifi c set of rules that must be followed. However, 
many manufacturers of wireless networking equipment have guidelines and suggestions 
when it comes to a wireless site survey and where this survey will fi t into the process of the 
design and implementation of a wireless network.
Knowing and understanding the expectations of the client or business in regard to a 
wireless installation is a critical part of a successful deployment. To understand client 
expectations, you have to gather much information. This means you will need to partici-
pate in interviews and meetings with all those who will be affected by the installation of 
the wireless network, which encompasses nearly all departments of the company in most 
cases.
The scope of the wireless site survey, capacity planning, and wireless network design is 
dependent on many factors, the following among them:
 
■
Size of the physical location
 
■
Intended use of the wireless network
 
■
Number of wireless mobile devices
 
■
Wireless client device capabilities
 
■
The environment
 
■
Understanding the performance expectations
 
■
Bring your own device acceptance
 
■
Building age and construction materials
 
■
Network infrastructure devices

Chapter 8 ■ Site Survey, Capacity Planning, and Wireless Design
Size of the Physical Location
Depending on the size of the physical location where the wireless network will be installed, 
a complete wireless site survey may not be necessary and the design will be straightfor-
ward. For example, a small sandwich shop wishes to offer free wireless Internet access (a 
hotspot) as a convenience for its patrons who choose to have a meal there. This sandwich 
shop is approximately 1,200 square feet, has seating for about 15 people, and is located in 
a small street retail mall. In this case, a single access point would more than likely be suffi -
cient for the number of users who access the wireless network at any one time and the type 
of data being sent across the access point to the Internet.
Although a full-blown physical site survey determining areas of RF interference, cover-
age, and capacity would more than likely not be required, it would still be benefi cial to visit 
the location and determine the best place for the access point. In a situation like this, what 
I like to call a “site survey lite” may be all that is necessary. This would include performing 
some simple tests to determine the best RF channel to use as well as access point mounting, 
consideration of aesthetics, and connecting to the wired network for access to the Internet.
A larger installation will require a much more extensive site survey and may include 
either a manual RF site survey or a predictive modeling site survey using elaborate soft-
ware. Manual and predictive modeling site survey software will be discussed in more detail 
later in this chapter.
Intended Use of the Wireless Network
Looking at the sandwich shop scenario again, chances are the intended use of this wireless 
network will consist of patrons staying online for short periods of time and browsing the 
Internet, interacting with social media, or checking email. It is unlikely that many users 
would be performing any high-end or bandwidth-intensive applications on this type of 
connection. Therefore, the single-access point model would be suffi cient for this deploy-
ment, providing adequate wireless access and capacity. With larger installations, the use 
of the network may include bandwidth-intensive applications such as electronic imaging, 
computer-aided design, graphics design, and database programs and would have an impact 
on the number of access points that would be required to provide adequate performance. 
Although not bandwidth-intensive, a Voice over Wireless LAN (VoWLAN) may also have 
an impact on the number of access points because of the type of wireless traffi c.
Number of Mobile Devices
The number of users and their wireless mobile devices that will be accessing a wireless 
network is also a big factor in determining the number of access points required, which in 
turn will determine the scope of a site survey. Many organizations plan on three to four 
wireless mobile devices per user, including computers, smartphones, tablets, and others. 

Wireless Site Surveys 
323
It has already been established that in our sandwich shop example a single access point 
would be suffi cient based on the size of the location and the intended use of the network. 
However, as the number of actual wireless-enabled devices increases and because of the 
added capacity requirements, the need for additional access points will also increase. In a 
case where more than one access point is required, a more extensive wireless site survey is 
also required.
Wireless Client Device Capabilities
In addition to the number of users and their wireless client devices, it is important to under-
stand the type of client devices that will be connected to the wireless network and what 
those device capabilities are. For example, notebook computers or handheld devices such 
as tablets and smartphones all have specifi c functionality and will need to meet certain net-
work requirements. Some client devices are multifunctional and include capabilities such as 
cellular voice, 3G, 4G, WiMAX, and Wi-Fi which will need to be taken into consideration. 
This type of device could be performing tasks as simple as basic web browsing or check-
ing email. Other possible device types include Wi-Fi-enabled voice handsets that may need 
their own SSIDs for quality of service functionality and may operate in the 5 GHz U-NII 
bands or even bar code scanners that will be keeping track of product inventory. With the 
advancements in wireless networking technology such as the 5 GHz IEEE 802.11ac amend-
ment, the device capabilities must be closely evaluated.
Part of the wireless site survey planning process is to question the appropriate people 
regarding the types of wireless devices and understand what their capabilities are to ensure 
that expectations of the users will be met. The following device capabilities are among 
those that need to be considered: 
 
■
IEEE 802.11b/g/n, 2.4 GHz only
 
■
IEEE 802.11a or dual band, 2.4 GHz/5 GHz capable
 
■
IEEE 802.11n capable and the number of transmit and receive radio chains (e.g., 2x2 
MIMO) 
 
■
IEEE 802.11ac capable and the extended features 802.11ac technology provides. 
 
■
MIMO capabilities, such as the number of spatial streams, channel width, or transmit 
beamforming
 
■
Notebook computers, desktop computers, multifunction smart phones, or tablets
 
■
Radio frequency identification (RFID) tags for location services
 
■
Wi-Fi-enabled voice handsets and the operating frequency in which they can be used
Future mobile device types that will be used with the wireless network must also be 
evaluated. This includes the expansion of the wireless network, new technology types that 
may be introduced based on the business model, and bring your own device (BYOD) accep-
tance and use. 

324 
Chapter 8 ■ Site Survey, Capacity Planning, and Wireless Design
The Environment
Understanding the environment in which the wireless network will be installed and the 
wireless mobile devices that will be used within the environment are important factors 
that are sometimes overlooked. Different environments will have different concerns. For 
example, areas that may have excess radio frequency noise, areas with harsh environmental 
conditions such as temperature fl uctuations, or industrial areas have their own set of chal-
lenges. Different environments may have distinct types of challenges: 
 
■
General office spaces: Walls and attenuation values
 
■
Office cube farms: User and device density
 
■
Healthcare environments: Wireless medical and other interfering devices
 
■
Industrial areas: Reflections and machine shop equipment
 
■
Educational environments: High quantity of mobile devices
These are a few examples of different environments that may use IEEE 802.11 wire-
less networks and the challenges that will need to be considered as part of the wireless site 
survey. In Chapter 4, “Standards and Certifi cations for Wireless Technology,” you learned 
about some of the various deployment scenarios for common wireless network types. 
Understanding the Performance Expectations
Keep in mind that IEEE 802.11 wireless networks are half-duplex and contention based 
and that many factors will affect the performance of a wireless network, including the 
number and capabilities of wireless and mobile client devices, types of software and hard-
ware applications used, location, and the number of infrastructure devices providing 
access. These infrastructure devices include wireless access points and bridges. Part of a 
wireless site survey involves defi ning what the customer expects for performance of the net-
work. A mutual understanding of the factors that affect performance as well as how they 
will be dealt with is imperative from the beginning of the wireless site survey process. From 
a cellular communications perspective, it is important to keep in mind that cellular signals 
are received from wireless carriers, and depending on the location, the signal may be weak 
in certain areas of the building. Adding technology such as a distributed antenna system 
(DAS) will help improve performance of cellular-enabled mobile devices.
Bring Your Own Device Acceptance
With the number of IEEE 802.11–enabled wireless mobile devices continually growing, the 
need for increased wireless network capacity is a major concern. Bring your own device 
(BYOD) describes the recent increase in company employees bringing their own personal 
IEEE 802.11–capable mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets to their place of work 

Wireless Site Surveys 
325
and using these devices to access company resources, including the Internet, printers, soft-
ware applications, and fi le servers. Take a moment and think about the number of IEEE 
802.11–enabled mobile devices you may have in your offi ce or home. Any of the following 
devices would qualify:
 
■
Notebook computers
 
■
Smartphones
 
■
Tablet devices
 
■
Wireless printers
 
■
Wireless video cameras
 
■
Wireless household appliances
 
■
DVD or Blu-ray players
 
■
Wireless-capable gaming devices
 
■
Wireless-capable televisions
These are just some of the devices that are used daily and are now IEEE 802.11 wireless 
capable. A family of four people may have as many as 20 wireless devices in the home, and 
this number will likely increase as wireless technology continues to advance. When compa-
nies or organizations allow employees to bring their personal wireless devices to the offi ce 
or place of work, that opens up an entire set of potential issues, including security, techni-
cal support, and wireless infrastructure capacity concerns.
If employees are allowed to bring their own devices to their place of business, you must 
take this into consideration when performing an RF site survey and designing a wireless 
network. Because IEEE 802.11 wireless networks are contention based and use a shared 
medium, the added number of devices will impact the performance if the network is not 
properly designed. Networks that support BYOD may require smaller RF cells and addi-
tional wireless access points in order to offer adequate performance for the number of 
connected devices. In addition to the load factor, the types of technology used—IEEE 
802.11a/b/g/n and IEEE 802.11ac—will have an impact on the need for backward com-
patibility. Figure 8.1 shows how a number of personal devices can have an impact on the 
capacity of a wireless network.
Building Age and Construction Materials
It is important to identify the building age and materials that were used for construction. 
RF propagation is required for adequate coverage and desired signal strength. In older 
buildings, for example, it may be diffi cult to determine what materials the walls consist of 
based on the building practices at the time of construction. If an RF signal does not propa-
gate suffi ciently, additional access points may be required for adequate coverage and capac-
ity requirements. Newer buildings will have lighter and thinner yet stronger construction 

326 
Chapter 8 ■ Site Survey, Capacity Planning, and Wireless Design
materials that may make it easier for an RF signal to penetrate. In addition, covering an 
offi ce with open space and cubicles will be easier than covering a hotel or enclosed areas 
with many rooms and walls. Coverage is just one part of the equation. Network capacity 
must also be considered and is discussed later in this chapter.

Network Infrastructure Devices
It is important to factor in network infrastructure devices such as Ethernet switches. For 
example, installing 500 access points in a hospital will require 500 Ethernet switch ports to 
connect the access points.  It is unlikely that a hospital or any organization for that matter 
will have that many open and available Ethernet ports.  Also, considering the access points 
will be installed throughout the building, it is important to note where the wiring closets 
are and how many Ethernet switches and ports will be required per wiring closet. When 
you’re running twisted-pair Ethernet cabling, the access point must be within 100 meters 
(328 feet) of the wiring closet. The access points will be powered using Power over Ethernet 
(PoE), so choosing a proper PoE source is critical.  In addition, it is important to ensure 
that the wiring closets have adequate supply power to support additional Ethernet switches 
and the PoE they will provide to the connected devices.
A wireless engineer conducting a wireless site survey will also work with the wired 
network engineers.  For example, adding 500 access points and many additional wireless

mobile client devices will increase traffi c to and from the WAN and Internet. The network 
infrastructure devices will need the capacity to handle to additional traffi c.
Gathering Business Requirements
Gathering information is typically the fi rst step of wireless network design and implementa-
tion. The business model or type of business where the wireless network will be deployed 
is a major part of deciding the level of a wireless site survey. The type of business will 
determine the needs and use of a wireless network. Knowing the applications used—both 
hardware (such as voiceover wireless LAN) and software (such as accessing a database)—
is a critical part of a wireless deployment because this will affect recommendations such 
as the number and locations of access points. Expectations can make or break a wireless 
deployment. The expectations of the wireless network must be discussed, evaluated, and 
documented up front. To completely understand what the customer expects, you will need 
to gather information from various areas of the business. A high-quality site survey is going 
to require many questions to be asked and answered, including the following:
Bandwidth and Capacity Needs  How much bandwidth will be required for users of the 
wireless network? The types of applications in use will have an impact on this. How many 
wireless devices per user? Most manufacturers have wireless design guides that you can ref-
erence for various deployment scenarios.
Coverage Area  In what rooms or areas of the buildings is wireless coverage expected? Is 
coverage limited to indoors only or will outdoor coverage be required? Many businesses 
want coverage over the entire location in most cases.
Applications Used  What type of applications—either hardware or software—are used at 
the facility? How will the applications affect the performance? This may include computer-
aided design, digital imaging, databases, and Voice over Wireless LAN.
Wireless Devices Used  What type of wireless client devices will be used? Are the devices 
multifunctional? These include notebook computers, handheld scanners, wireless phones, 
tablets, and other devices, whether company owned or employee owned (BYOD).
Desired IEEE 802.11 Technologies  What type of IEEE 802.11 infrastructure devices 
(IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n or IEEE 802.11ac) would be best suited to the specifi c environment 
and deployment?
IEEE 802.11 wireless networks were once primarily used as extensions of wired net-
works, providing access to a few users in areas exceeding the physical distance of an 
Ethernet or other wired medium in place. IEEE 802.11 wireless technology continues to 
evolve and is now a major part of every area in a business, corporation, or company’s com-
puter network infrastructure. It is diffi cult to fi nd any business or organization that does 
not provide some type of IEEE 802.11 wireless network access. Fully understanding the 
business requirements is part of a successful wireless network site survey and deployment.

Chapter 8 ■ Site Survey, Capacity Planning, and Wireless Design
General Office/Enterprise
Offi ce buildings and other enterprise installation locations may consist of walled offi ces or 
open spaces with many cubicles. This type of installation usually will require infrastructure 
devices to aesthetically fi t the environment and may require antennas to be mounted to 
drop ceilings with the access points located out of sight. Figure 8.2 shows an example of a 
fl oor plan for a small offi ce deployment.
F I G U R E  8 . 2   A small office wireless network installation using omnidirectional 
antennas
Some installations may have a high density of wireless mobile devices and therefore 
require more access points to handle the number of wireless devices connected to the net-
work. The software and hardware applications used in these environments will need to be 
closely evaluated to ensure optimal performance for the user base. Chances are that inter-
ference sources in this type of deployment would be limited mostly to computer network-
ing, and radio frequency challenges may be limited.
Interviewing Stakeholders
Understanding the intended use of a wireless network is a critical part of a successful 
deployment. Who better to explain what the wireless network will be used for than those 
who will be using it? Those performing a site survey may not necessarily understand the 
functional aspects of a certain type of business, so it is critical to get input from all who 
will be using the wireless network. Department managers, business unit managers, and 
team leaders usually know the function of their specifi c areas of the organization the best. 

Interviewing Stakeholders 
329
Therefore, they will also know the needs and requirements of users of the wireless network 
and how a successful deployment will help increase job productivity.
I recommend that you create some type of checklist or formal site survey questionnaire 
to use during the interview process. This will ensure that specifi c details about the busi-
ness and proposed wireless deployment are not missed. The use of such forms helps ensure 
uniform, repeatable interviews. The forms can also become part of the documentation and 
fi nal deliverable that will be presented to the customer. Although there are some general 
questions that can be asked, there will be more specifi c questions based on the business 
model of the organization or the wireless network to be installed. Figure 8.3 shows an 
example of notes that can be taken during the information gathering stage and the wireless 
site survey specifi cs.
F I G U R E  8 . 3   Sample checklist showing some information collected for a wireless site 
survey
The following list includes some generic interview questions that will pertain to most 
installations:
Has a site survey ever been performed in the past?  It is good to know whether a site sur-
vey has previously been performed at a location. Although the previous site survey is only 
as good as the person who performed it, it may be benefi cial and a timesaver to have some 
information available. Depending on when it was performed, a previous site survey report 
may not be accurate because, for example, physical changes to the location may have taken 
place, such as additions of rooms or walls or changes to the interior design.
What blueprints, floor plans, or any other site-specific documentation is avail-
able?  Blueprints, fl oor plans, or other documentation about the location are critical in 
performing an RF wireless site survey. If this information is not available, it may have to 
be created, which in turn would create an additional expense for the company or customer. 
The accuracy of these documents needs to be considered in order to provide ideal site sur-
vey results.

330 
Chapter 8 ■ Site Survey, Capacity Planning, and Wireless Design
How many wireless mobile devices and users anticipate using the wireless network? What 
are the bandwidth and capacity requirements?  The number of devices expected to be on 
the wireless network is valuable information to have. Knowing the number of devices and 
users will help determine the amount of infrastructure equipment, such as access points 
and wireless bridges, that will be required for the deployment. Discussing with department 
managers the number of devices and users on the network as well as the number of work-
ing shifts will help provide adequate planning. It will also be benefi cial to know whether 
users are allowed to bring their own devices.
Will guest access be required?  If guest access to the wireless network is required, that 
will potentially affect the number of infrastructure devices such as access points required 
for the deployment. Depending on what type of access, network capacity will need to be 
considered. In addition to the equipment, you should take into account security, the captive 
portal, and backward compatibility.
Is there any preference for a specific manufacturer’s equipment?  It is a recommended 
practice for a site survey to be performed with the same manufacturer’s equipment that will 
be used in the deployment. Therefore, customer preference for equipment manufacturers 
must be determined at the initial phases of the site survey. This will ensure good results 
based on the design of the wireless network.
What is the coverage area?  The intended coverage area of the facility also needs to be 
addressed. This helps provide a surveyor with information to accurately estimate how long 
a physical site survey may take and roughly estimate the amount of hardware required. 
Knowing the coverage area will also help determine any unexpected obstacles that may 
occur as part of the site survey process.
Is an existing IEEE 802.11 wireless network in place?  If an existing IEEE 802.11 wireless 
network is in place, it needs to be addressed as part of the site survey process. The follow-
ing questions need to be asked:
 
■
What technology is currently in use, IEEE 802.11a, IEEE 802.11b/g, or IEEE 
802.11n?
 
■
How many wireless devices and users does the network currently support?
 
■
Where are the existing access points located?
 
■
Are the existing access points and external antennas installed correctly?
 
■
What is the wireless network used for?
Knowing the answers to these and other questions will help determine the role, if any, that 
the existing IEEE 802.11 wireless network will play in the new deployment. Keep in mind 
that some organizations may have quite an extensive existing wireless network and may be 
in the process of upgrading to newer or different technology. If this is the case, it will need 
to be determined whether any of the existing network components can or will be used with 
the new deployment. Photographs of existing equipment used in a deployment are always 
useful. Figure 8.4 shows a photograph of an existing IEEE 802.11a/b/g access point with 
an incorrect installation of diversity antennas. If this was used in the new installation,

the antennas would need to be moved to the proper spacing based on the frequency 
wavelength.

Are there any known areas of RF interference?  Information regarding known areas of RF 
interference is useful in a site survey. It will save time if previous knowledge of RF interfer-
ence is made available as part of the site survey process. Keep in mind that interference 
may change and can be detected only at the time of testing or when a manual site survey is 
performed.
Are there any known areas that may lack RF coverage?  Just as previous knowledge of 
areas affected by RF interference is valuable, the lack of RF coverage in specifi c areas is 
also good to know. This will help a surveyor determine any special situations that may 
be addressed during the site survey process. Testing of various types of antennas may be 
required to help provide RF coverage in areas that are currently lacking. Available coverage 
maps may also be useful.
What type of applications will be used?  It is important to know the types of applications 
that will be used. Applications—either software or hardware—will affect the load and 
number of access points or other infrastructure devices required. These applications include 
bandwidth-intensive software, voice over wireless LAN, and so on. The surveyor should 
also become familiar with any special circumstances that may be required to support these 
applications—for example, the frequency or IEEE 802.11 technology that may be required 
for the wireless devices to operate.

332 
Chapter 8 ■ Site Survey, Capacity Planning, and Wireless Design
Will Wi-Fi voice or other real time applications that require quality of service be used?  If 
applications (such as Wi-Fi voice handsets) are planned for the location, they will have an 
impact on the site survey and design of the wireless network. Because this type of applica-
tion has greater requirements for signal quality and signal strength as well as fast transi-
tion, this will need to be taken into consideration during the site survey. Additional density 
and more access points may be required.
Real-time video communications such as a videoconference call over a wireless network 
connection is another application that may require quality of service. Like voice, real-time 
video is subject to latency and may involve special design requirements. Real-time video 
over a wireless connection is used in applications ranging from sports venues to security 
surveillance and monitoring.
Is wireless roaming (transition) required?  In most cases, the answer to this question is yes. 
This is especially true with networks that will be using Wi-Fi-capable voice handsets. Voice 
handsets are among the most commonly used wireless mobile devices that require seamless 
roaming and secure transition capabilities. Although notebook computers and tablets may 
require roaming, real-time voice and video applications are subject to latency issues. Fast, 
secure transitions may also be required for roaming. If so, the amount of overlap between 
RF cells would need to be closely looked at to ensure reliable sessions for the devices con-
nected to the network.
Is Power over Ethernet (PoE) required?  In all medium to large installations, the answer 
to this question is yes. Understanding the PoE requirements is another essential part of the 
wireless site survey. The capabilities of the network devices as well as the number of devices 
expected to use PoE—including wireless access points, hardwired Ethernet IP phones, and 
security cameras—will play a role in the design and types of equipment used in the wireless 
network. 
What are the wireless security requirements?  Although security is not necessarily part of 
an RF site survey, as much information as possible on the security requirements is helpful 
with the design of the wireless network. Some security solutions may require additional 
hardware, such as sensors that are used with a wireless intrusion prevention system (WIPS), 
or software that would have to be taken into account for the network design.
Will an escort and ID badge be required?  In many cases, people are not allowed to roam 
freely throughout a business. An escort might be and usually is needed to walk through a 
location with an outside contract site surveyor. In addition, the escort and surveyor will 
need access to areas that may be locked or secure, such as wiring closets and computer 
rooms. Escorts may be from various parts of the company, hospital, or organization, 
including facilities, information technology, medical staff, and security. Depending on 
the organization, proper paperwork for access may need to be submitted ahead of time to 
allow for adequate processing time. For example, you don’t want to show up on site on a 
Monday morning only to fi nd out it will take hours or even days to process the paperwork 
needed to get an ID badge for access.
Are there any compliance requirements?  Depending on the type of business in which 
the wireless network will be installed, there may be legislative or other compliance 

Gathering Site-Specific Documentation 
333
requirements. For example, medical institutions may have to meet HIPAA requirements, 
and retail establishments may require PCI compliance. These need to be taken into consid-
eration as part of a wireless site survey and deployment.
Are you following corporate policies?  If one exists, you should use a written corporate 
policy as a guideline or offer suggestions for changes in the policy to accommodate other 
wireless requirements. The wireless site survey questioning process should bring any policy-
related issues to light for discussion and/or change if needed.
Manufacturer Guidelines and Deployment Guides
The information just presented includes some types of questions that need to be addressed 
during the site survey process. Keep in mind that the actual questions and details depend 
on the business model and the implementation of the wireless network. For site survey and 
deployment guides, check with the manufacturer of the equipment that you will use. These 
guides will provide additional information that is helpful in generating a list of questions 
and concerns that will need to be addressed.
Gathering Site-Specific Documentation
Documentation for the location where a wireless network will be installed will make a sur-
veyor’s job much easier and result in a smoother overall deployment. Drawings and other 
documentation pertaining to the following items can provide valuable information:
 
■
Floor plans
 
■
Blueprints
 
■
Proposed location of furnishings
 
■
Electrical specifications
 
■
Existing network characteristics
Floor Plans and Blueprints
Gathering any site-specifi c documentation that exists, such as fl oor plans or blueprints, is 
extremely helpful for a site survey. This documentation is useful to a variety of individuals 
who will be participating in a wireless network design and deployment. The documentation 
can be used during a physical or predictive RF site survey and spectrum analysis to note 
areas of importance and concerns. Having fl oor plans and blueprints available allows a sur-
veyor to document specifi c parts of a site survey such as location of access points and other 
wireless devices. If a predictive modeling site survey is used, an electronic version of a fl oor 
plan can be imported into the software program to help streamline the surveyor’s job. The 
standard formats for fl oor plan (map) fi les vary from product to product for most modeling

software, but they typically include DWG, PDF, JPG, PNG, GIF, and TIF. Figure 8.5 shows 
a site survey software program that allows for various fi le formats to be imported.

Blueprints or fl oor plans will also help those who install cable and mount hardware and 
if necessary can be provided to electricians for AC power installation.
Furnishings
The proposed types and location of furnishings or other items that may affect RF signal 
propagation or penetration are also good to know if that information is available. This will 
help during the design and site survey phase to determine access point locations and pin-
point other things that may affect RF signals, such as refl ection, refraction, diffraction, and 
absorption. Unfortunately, most fl oor plan documents do not specify this kind of informa-
tion because, in many cases, furnishings are not permanent fi xtures and can change. Some 
organizations will have this information stored in asset documentation using spreadsheets 

Gathering Site-Specific Documentation 
335
or databases. Many times it will be up to the surveyor to determine where the furnishings 
or equipment are located and the effect it may have on the radio frequency.
Be sure to gather information about the following:
 
■
In an office or enterprise environment, furnishings may consist of desks, cabinets, 
chairs, and other items.
 
■
In warehousing and retail environments, furnishings will include storage racks and 
shelving as well as product inventories.
 
■
In manufacturing environments, information should be gathered about the location of 
industrial equipment used in the manufacturing process and about equipment used to 
move product throughout the factory.
 
■
In medical environments, furnishings or equipment will include devices that may cause 
interference and operate in the same frequency range as the proposed wireless network. 
Storage of items used within the hospital or medical environment for patients and 
employees may also affect RF coverage.
 
■
In educational environments, the location of lockers and internal windows is impor-
tant, as are the types of materials used in the walls, such as concrete blocks with and/
or without sound dampening material inside. All of these factors will have an effect on 
the RF propagation.
These are just some examples of the types of furnishings and other items that may affect 
a wireless network deployment and are factors to consider.
Electrical Specifications
Documentation of the electrical specifi cations of the environment is helpful in determin-
ing whether the current electrical implementation will be suffi cient to handle the proposed 
wireless network deployment. This will allow the site survey process to determine whether 
any upgrades need to be made to support devices that may be using Power over Ethernet or 
whether the existing infrastructure is suffi cient. It is best to gather information regarding 
electrical power sources, electrical panels, existing wiring, and location of electrical outlets.
Documenting Existing Network Characteristics
Documentation is a major part of any business, including documentation of computer 
networks. In order to have a successful deployment of a wireless network, it is critical to 
know the details of the existing network infrastructure as well as future implementations, 
upgrades, and modifi cations. These existing infrastructures may include a wired or wireless 
network already in place and functioning that may be upgraded or in a new deployment.

The following list includes some of the questions that you should take into consideration 
when performing a wireless site survey:
 
■
What frequency range will the new wireless network operate in?
 
■
Are there any existing IEEE 802.11 wireless networks in the same RF space?
 
■
Will all or part of the existing wireless network be utilized in the new deployment?
 
■
What effect will the neighboring wireless networks have on this deployment?

Identifying Infrastructure Connectivity and Power Requirements 
337
Ignoring existing IEEE 802.11 wireless networks may have a signifi cant impact on 
how a new wireless network will operate and result in poor performance for the clients or 
devices that will be connecting.
Documentation of networks is usually the responsibility of the IT department. Some 
organizations may lack good documentation of the existing network infrastructure. If this 
is the case, additional work may be required prior to starting a wireless site survey.
Existing IEEE 802.11 Wireless Networks  It was mentioned earlier that the scope of any 
existing wireless networks must be determined during the interview process. If a wireless 
network does exist (as it often does), it will need to be dealt with during the site survey and 
design procedure. The questions that are asked regarding the existing wireless network 
will help determine the role it is going to play. If the existing network is going to remain 
in place, understanding its technical details and how to work it into the design of the new 
or upgraded deployment will help you create a successful and productive wireless network 
deployment.
Existing IEEE 802.3 or Other Wired Networks  In addition to knowing of any existing 
wireless networks, you should know about the wired network infrastructure. Existing 
documentation on the wired network infrastructure will help streamline the process for 
connecting the IEEE 802.11 wireless components of the network. The wired infrastructure 
is discussed in more detail in the next section of this chapter.
Existing wireless networks can play a big role in a new wireless network deployment. 
Understanding the current location of infrastructure and other wireless network devices is 
an important part of a wireless site survey. One way to see devices that are part of a wire-
less network is to use a protocol analyzer. Other programs will also be able to view existing 
wireless networks, such as the MetaGeek InSSIDer program or the Xirrus Wi-Fi Inspector. 
In some cases these programs may be adequate based on the complexity and size of the site 
survey. But they typically do not have the extensive feature set that many protocol analyzer 
packages have.
Identifying Infrastructure Connectivity 
and Power Requirements
Why are there so many wires in wireless networking? Wireless networks require some type 
of wired infrastructure for many reasons, including connecting access points together, 
allowing wireless device and user access to network resources, providing access to a wide 
area network, allowing Internet connectivity, and supplying electrical power.
Network infrastructure connectivity plays a big role in wireless networking. A wireless 
site survey will require additional information about the network infrastructure and power 
requirements. In a sense, a wireless site survey also requires a wired or infrastructure sur-
vey. A wireless site survey should include information about the wired network, including 

338 
Chapter 8 ■ Site Survey, Capacity Planning, and Wireless Design
the location of the wiring closet, the wired infrastructure network devices in use, the con-
nection speed between sites, and the electrical power requirement: 
Location of Wiring Closets  A wiring closet is a room (usually secured) containing electri-
cal power and cabling for voice and data that is terminated and connected to infrastructure 
devices such as switches and routers. In most cases, these locations are noted on the fl oor 
plan or blueprint documents, but that may not always be the case, and you will need to 
fi nd them if they are not noted. When deploying a wireless network, you should know not 
only the physical locations of wiring closets but also the capacity of existing infrastructure 
devices. This is important because wired connections such as IEEE 802.3 Ethernet have 
specifi c limits for cable lengths, and infrastructure devices such as access points and bridges 
will have to be placed within these physical limits of infrastructure connectivity. For exam-
ple, the IEEE 802.3 Ethernet standard has a physical maximum cable length of 328 feet (or 
100 meters) for unshielded twisted-pair wiring.
In addition to cable length, the feasibility of running the Ethernet cable from the wiring 
closet to the desired location must be considered. For example, the intended location for an 
access point may be on a ceiling without any access from above. In this case, lack of acces-
sibility could pose a problem for installation of the Ethernet cabling from the wiring closet 
and/or AC power to the devices.
Wired Infrastructure Network Devices in Use  The wired infrastructure devices in use 
may have an impact on a successful deployment of a wireless network. An evaluation of the 
infrastructure devices by a WLAN site surveyor or a network infrastructure professional 
may be required to determine if any additional hardware is needed or if changes must be 
made prior to deploying a WLAN. If the infrastructure devices, such as Layer 2 switches 
and routers, are not adequate to support a new wireless deployment, additional hardware 
may need to be purchased.
Connection Speed between Sites  The connection speeds and type of connections between 
sites should be evaluated to determine if there are any bottlenecks that could affect the 
overall network performance. Placement of authentication servers and other network 
resources may be affected by the speed of these links.
Electrical Power  Since all wireless network infrastructure devices, including access points, 
bridges, and wireless switches, require an AC power source, and because these devices may 
be supplying Power over Ethernet (PoE) to the infrastructure devices, verifi cation of an 
adequate AC power supply must be performed. The AC power sources are sometimes taken 
for granted or not taken into consideration, which could pose a problem during the instal-
lation phase. It is also important to determine what local ordinances may apply and what 
they allow you to do for a wireless network installation.
Because PoE is used not only in infrastructure devices but also with IP telephones, secu-
rity cameras, and user devices, it may be necessary to perform calculations and verify that 
the power supply to the wiring closet will be adequate to support the powered infrastruc-
ture (including the PoE devices). Electrical components of a wiring closet may need to 
be upgraded to support a new wireless network deployment. Newer wireless networking 

Understanding Application Requirements 
339
technologies such as 802.11ac MIMO systems may require more DC power than is avail-
able with the IEEE 802.3af PoE amendment to the Ethernet standard.
If these technologies will be used, the power requirements will need to be carefully con-
sidered to verify that enough DC power will be available to the end powered devices. 
Manufacturers now provide IEEE 802.3at (with new PoE capabilities) endpoint or midspan 
devices to provide the necessary amount of DC voltage for certain PoE-capable devices. 
All manufacturers of enterprise dual-band IEEE 802.11n wireless access points claim their 
equipment will operate with standard 802.3af power. I recommend that you read the speci-
fi cation data sheet for the access point, WIPS sensor, or other wireless infrastructure device 
to determine the type of PoE required and whether IEEE 802.3af or IEEE 802.3at will be 
required to provide DC power to the device.
It is important to understand that wireless infrastructure devices require some sort of 
wired connectivity for data and electrical power. Data access will usually come by way of 
an Ethernet connection from a wired network infrastructure or backbone. As stated in the 
IEEE 802.3 Ethernet standard, the maximum length for unshielded twisted-pair Ethernet 
cable is 328 feet, or 100 meters. This limitation may have an impact on how and where 
access points and other infrastructure devices are placed.
During the wireless site survey process, the surveyor will need access to wiring closets. 
This will allow the surveyor to evaluate and perform a survey of the wired network infra-
structure as well.
Another consideration is electrical power requirements. Infrastructure devices need 
electrical power as well as data connectivity to operate. If the electrical power is decen-
tralized and located at each device, an electrician will need to evaluate and determine the 
requirements.
An option for supplying electrical power to infrastructure devices is Power over Ethernet 
(PoE). This technology is now very common and is supported by all enterprise device 
manufacturers. A survey of the wired infrastructure and devices is almost always required 
to determine if the infrastructure will be capable of handling the new PoE devices that will 
be installed. Keep in mind that zoning and building regulations, electrical contractors, and 
labor union requirements may add to the overall cost of wireless deployment. PoE was dis-
cussed in Chapter 6, “Computer Network Infrastructure Devices.”
Understanding Application 
Requirements
Understanding the application requirements for software applications is another important 
part of a successful wireless deployment. The types and number of applications used will 
affect the performance and the capacity of an IEEE 802.11 wireless network. Some soft-
ware applications are very bandwidth intensive and will require more resources than oth-
ers to perform effectively as designed. Examples of these applications are streaming video, 

340 
Chapter 8 ■ Site Survey, Capacity Planning, and Wireless Design
computer-aided design (CAD), and database programs. By contrast, applications used for 
email, social media (if policy allows), and casual Internet browsing are not bandwidth 
intensive. 
Because digital imaging, graphic design, CAD, and database applications can have a 
tremendous effect on the performance of a wireless network, they require special attention 
when the network is designed. The infrastructure resources that will be impacted include 
the processing power and memory capacity of the wireless access points and the speed of 
the wired infrastructure itself, such as 100 Mbps or 1,000 Mbps (Gigabit).
This in turn will affect the site survey. The wireless site survey will be impacted because 
the location where the wireless network is installed may require more infrastructure 
devices or access points. Other applications, such as Voice over Wireless LAN, may intro-
duce another entire set of issues. This type of deployment may use only the 5 GHz band 
for wireless voice technology, and therefore the wireless site survey must be performed 
accordingly.
Understanding RF Coverage and 
Capacity Requirements
A major aspect of a wireless site survey is to understand and verify the RF coverage 
and capacity requirements based on the network design. In Chapter 5, “IEEE 802.11 
Terminology and Technology,” you learned about coverage versus capacity and the dif-
ferences between them. A wireless network site surveyor will need to verify these require-
ments as part of the site survey. This can be accomplished either manually or automatically 
through a predictive process, both to be discussed in more detail later in this chapter.
To review, the wireless coverage and capacity requirements are going to depend on sev-
eral factors: 
 
■
Physical size of the area to be covered
 
■
Number of users or devices accessing the wireless network, including bring your own 
device (BYOD) users
 
■
Software or hardware applications in use
 
■
Obstacles and propagation factors based on the environment
 
■
Radio frequency range of the network to be installed
 
■
Wireless network hardware to be used
 
■
Output RF power of the transmitters
 
■
Receive sensitivity of the receivers

Client Connectivity Requirements 
341
In addition to an RF coverage analysis, an RF spectrum analysis will be benefi cial. An 
RF spectrum analysis allows a site surveyor to view areas of RF coverage as well as inter-
ference sources and non-IEEE 802.11 wireless devices. This topic will be discussed later in 
this chapter. Although a spectrum analysis is not required, it does allow a site surveyor to 
view sources of RF in the locations where a wireless network will be deployed.
Client Connectivity Requirements
The wireless client devices that will be connecting to the wireless network also need to be 
considered as part of a site survey. This includes knowing the radio type, antenna type, 
gain, orientation, portability, and mobility of the device. Keep in mind that a wireless cli-
ent device is both a radio frequency transmitter and a receiver. The client (receiver) must 
be able to hear the transmitter and the transmitter must be able to hear the client. The RF 
cell size will vary from device to device. It is benefi cial to survey with the type of devices 
that will be used with the wireless network whenever possible. Understanding the type and 
function of client devices will have an impact on the design of the wireless network. The 
following wireless client devices are commonly used in a wireless network:
 
■
Notebook computers
 
■
Tablets
 
■
Pocket computers
 
■
Smartphones
 
■
Bar code scanners
 
■
Point-of-sale devices
 
■
Voice handsets
Other wireless devices used in various wireless applications include but are not limited 
to the following:
 
■
Desktop computers
 
■
Printers and print servers
 
■
Manufacturing equipment
 
■
IEEE 802.11 friendly video cameras
Many environments have both desktop and notebook computers as wireless client 
devices. These devices may or may not require roaming capability. Offi ce and enterprise 
deployments commonly use handsets for voice communications. Although it is fairly dif-
fi cult to take all potential wireless client devices into consideration, it is best to understand 

342 
Chapter 8 ■ Site Survey, Capacity Planning, and Wireless Design
the type of devices that will be used. This information can be obtained through the inter-
view process and the information gathering stage of the site survey.
Antenna Use Considerations
In Chapter 3, “Radio Frequency and Antenna Technology Fundamentals,” you saw various 
types of antennas and accessories. The antenna used in any wireless network installation 
will depend on the specifi c scenario. As part of the site survey, various antenna types may 
need to be used for testing purposes to determine the best antenna for a specifi c applica-
tion. In some cases, the customer may want a specifi c type of antenna, such as an omnidi-
rectional mounted directly to the access points. Others may be using access points without 
external antenna capabilities.
Some businesses are concerned about aesthetics and are particular about the appearance 
of an antenna and the mounting location. The proper antenna selection will ensure correct 
coverage as intended by the design and site survey of the wireless network. The antenna 
type used will determine the propagation pattern of the radio frequency and is a signifi cant 
part of a successful wireless deployment. The antenna used in various deployments will 
depend on the business model in which the network is installed:
General Office/Enterprise  General offi ce/enterprise solutions usually require complete 
coverage throughout the entire location. In many cases, this type of installation will require 
access points mounted out of sight and aesthetically pleasing antennas. This could be an 
omnidirectional antenna mounted to a ceiling tile or integrated within an access point.
Manufacturing  Manufacturing environments are usually industrial facilities with high 
ceilings and various types of manufacturing and industrial equipment. These environments 
may use a combination of omnidirectional and semidirectional antennas due to the physical 
architecture of the buildings. The antennas also may need to withstand harsh environmen-
tal conditions such as extreme temperature fl uctuations and dirt.
Warehousing  Warehousing implementations have some characteristics in common with 
manufacturing. The buildings that house this type of business are in many cases large open 
areas with high ceilings to allow the storage of large volumes of product and equipment. 
Antenna mounting needs to be looked at very closely to ensure that equipment such as fork-
lifts used to move product do not come in contact and damage antennas. Warehousing also 
may use a combination of omnidirectional and semidirectional antennas for proper cover-
age. Figure 8.7 shows a sample fl oor plan for a combination small offi ce/warehouse deploy-
ment using a combination of omnidirectional and semidirectional antennas.
Retail/Point of Sale (PoS)  Retail/point-of-sale installations may have to accommodate 
publicly accessible areas as well as warehousing and storage in the back of the buildings. 
In this type of installation, antennas will be a combination of omnidirectional and semidi-
rectional. The devices may consist of computers as well as other handhelds such as wireless 
bar code scanners or portable wireless devices. Appropriate antenna selection and gain 

Antenna Use Considerations 
343
need to be considered to ensure that the devices have good signal connectivity to the infra-
structure. In many cases, the public areas will require aesthetics to be taken into account 
in antenna selection. In the storage part of the building, antennas are similar to those 
described in warehousing.
F I G U R E  8 .7   Small office/warehouse floor plan showing RF coverage using different 
antenna types
Healthcare and Medical  Many healthcare and medical deployments are publicly acces-
sible, so aesthetics and security are both important. Antenna types that fi t the environment 
and are not accessible to the public are commonly used. Some healthcare facilities, such as 
hospitals, may require the use of only omnidirectional antennas mounted to the autono-
mous access point or integrated into an access point. Others may allow semidirectional 
antennas such as a yagi to cover long hallways and corridors.
Government and Military  Government and military wireless environments are usually 
not publicly accessible and in many cases are campus based and require outdoor as well 
as indoor solutions. In these installations, antennas mounted directly to an access point 
or semidirectional antennas may well fi t the environment. For outdoor point-to-point or 
point-to-multipoint, highly directional antennas such as parabolic dishes may be required.
Education  Education deployments are typically campus based and may require the use of 
outdoor antennas to connect buildings together. However, for indoor solutions, ensuring 
that the antennas will fi t the environment and not be tampered with is important. These 
deployments may use a combination of omnidirectional and semidirectional antenna types. 
Some locations may require the use of enclosures for the infrastructure devices to ensure 
security of the physical devices. In these cases, special connectors and antenna adapters 
may be required.
Public Access, Hotspot, and Hospitality  Public access, hotspot, and hospitality sites are 
publicly accessible locations that will require aesthetics and security when it comes to 

344 
Chapter 8 ■ Site Survey, Capacity Planning, and Wireless Design
antenna selection, as with some of the previous examples. These deployments can use a 
combination of omnidirectional, semidirectional, and highly directional antennas.
Typical Steps Used in a Wireless Site Survey
Here are some basic steps to provide an overview of the wireless site survey process. 
Keep in mind that these steps may vary slightly based on the location and the type of 
wireless network deployment.
1. 
Gathering Information and Discussing Business Requirements: Determine the need 
and intended use of the wireless network and interview appropriate individuals. 
Explain the site survey process and provide an overview of wireless networking. 
Doing so will help minimize unnecessary delays caused by people who are not 
included in the process but should have been and are unaware of the wireless 
network and site survey.
2. 
Project Timeline and Planning: Understand and document the extent and estimated 
timeline of the survey process and deployment. This will include all stages of the 
wireless site survey from start to ﬁ nish, such as design, deployment, and veriﬁ cation. 
Because the wireless site survey may include people from many different areas, such 
as facilities, IT, engineering, and so on, everyone must be on the same track.
3. 
Site Visit and Pre-design Audit: It is a good idea to make a visit to the location to 
get an idea of any issues that may not be visible on a blueprint or ﬂ oor plan. This 
will also allow for checking the RF propagation with a test access point if feasible. 
Performing a wireless site survey without a site visit—especially a predictive 
modeling survey—can be done, but that will come with some risks. Knowing what 
you are dealing with will minimize mistakes caused by not knowing the environment 
and therefore possibly making inaccurate assumptions.
4. 
Wireless Network Design: Determine areas of RF coverage and interference as 
well as potential placement of access points and other infrastructure devices. This 
will be done with an onsite manual site survey, a predictive modeling site survey, 
or a combination of both. An RF spectrum analyzer can be used to view the air to 
determine the areas of RF interference.
5. 
RF Spectrum Analysis and RF Testing: Perform testing of the proposed design 
and verify RF sources of interference. Also verify coverage and lack of coverage. 
Although an RF spectrum analysis is not a required part of the wireless site survey 
process, it is highly recommended. Knowing the potential RF interference may 
impact the wireless network design as a whole. It will be much easier to deal with 

The Physical Radio Frequency Site Survey Process 
345
potential RF issues up front rather than after the wireless network is deployed. 
Testing speciﬁ c areas or audit points with an access point will allow the surveyor to 
determine the coverage and how the RF propagates from the access point.
6. 
Deployment of Infrastructure Devices: Install the infrastructure devices as described 
by the design. This may or may not be done by the same person who performed 
the wireless site survey and in many cases it is not. This means that clear, concise 
documentation and instructions must be provided to the installer. This will reduce 
the risk of having to make unnecessary visits back to the location for corrections or 
adjustments because of mistakes that could have been avoided.
7. 
Veriﬁ cation of RF Coverage: Perform veriﬁ cation testing and spot checks of RF 
coverage per the design. Make necessary adjustments based on the results of RF 
testing. Veriﬁ cation testing may consist of spot checks in key areas (audit points) or 
could include the entire facility. It is important to be certain the wireless network will 
operate as designed. Sometimes cost or budget may not allow for a veriﬁ cation of 
the entire location, but I recommend it whenever possible. If the entire area cannot 
be checked, determining the audit points should be done carefully and should be 
completed in the early stages of the site survey. If needed, make adjustments to 
allow the wireless network to operate as designed. 
8. 
Support: Provide technical support for wireless network deployment. This 
involves maintaining the wireless network infrastructure and includes RF spectrum 
monitoring and making the necessary adjustments to adapt to the dynamics 
of environment. This can be done manually or automatically, depending on the 
capabilities of the technology that is deployed.
The Physical Radio Frequency Site 
Survey Process
After all the up-front work is completed, such as gathering information (including the busi-
ness requirements and site-specifi c documentation), defi ning physical and data security 
requirements, and interviewing managers and users, it is time to start the physical RF site 
survey process and the wireless network design. This is one of the most important parts of 
a successful wireless network deployment. This process includes locating areas and sources 
of RF interference as well as RF coverage (or lack thereof) and determining the locations of 
access points, bridges, sensors, and other infrastructure devices that will be used with the 

346 
Chapter 8 ■ Site Survey, Capacity Planning, and Wireless Design
wireless network. Capacity planning is another important part of the process to ensure that 
optimal performance is achieved. The following sections detail the entire physical wireless 
site survey process and guidelines. The RF physical site survey is subjective, and people 
have different opinions on how the entire process works. In many cases, the process can be 
tailored based on the individual needs or requirements of the location where the wireless 
network will be installed. The following steps should be viewed as recommendations or 
guidelines:
1. 
Arrange a walk-through of the entire location, which may often require being escorted 
by an authorized person.
2. 
Take thorough notes and digital photographs as needed.
3. 
Perform an RF spectrum analysis.
4. 
Determine preliminary placement of infrastructure devices.
5. 
Perform on-site testing to verify the design.
6. 
Determine actual placement of infrastructure devices.
7. 
Install infrastructure hardware as specified.
8. 
Perform on-site verification testing and make adjustments to verify that the design 
meets the specifications.
9. 
Deliver the final site survey report.
In today’s wireless world, an RF site survey can be considered an ongoing process. Just a 
few years ago, not nearly as many wireless networks existed as do today, so the interference 
factor was not as signifi cant. With the RF dynamics constantly changing and more devices 
using RF for communications, it is up to the network engineer to take into consideration 
that site requirements may also be constantly changing. Therefore, the RF site survey may 
need to be updated periodically.
Radio Frequency Spectrum Analysis
The wireless site survey includes fi nding areas of RF coverage and RF interference as well 
as locations for hardware, such as access points, bridges, and other infrastructure devices. 
Although radio frequency is not visible to the human eye, some tools are available to “see” 
a visual representation of the RF. One common tool is the RF spectrum analyzer. How 
the analyzer will be used will determine the type of equipment you will need for the job. 
Radio frequency is used as a communications mechanism for so many different types of 
technology:
 
■
Radio
 
■
Television
 
■
Computing
 
■
Cellular voice

Radio Frequency Spectrum Analysis 
347
In Chapter 3 you learned about the fundamentals, characteristics, and behaviors of RF 
technology, including various antenna types. You also saw some of the common frequency 
bands that are used for various types of wireless technologies. Using the correct spectrum 
analyzer for the job is a key element to collect the data you need. Spectrum analyzers are 
available in various form factors, and some are designed for a specifi c purpose, such as 
wireless networking technology, while others can be used for a larger part of the RF spec-
trum. These tools can be PC based or dedicated instrumentation devices. In the following 
sections, we will explore spectrum analysis for both IEEE 802.11 wireless networks and 
cellular communications.
Spectrum Analysis for IEEE 802.11 Wireless Networks
A spectrum analyzer used with IEEE 802.11 wireless networking can be limited to the spe-
cifi c RF bands used with wireless networking. This includes the 2.4 GHz ISM band and the 
5 GHz U-NII bands. Figure 8.8 shows a spectrum analyzer view of the 2.4 GHz ISM band 
with the access points on various channels. Spectrum analyzers will vary in cost and com-
plexity, depending on the frequency ranges they are designed to work with.
F I G U R E  8 . 8   MetaGeek Chanalyzer shows an RF capture of the 2.4 GHz ISM band. 
The spectrum analyzers that are designed specifi cally for the wireless market usu-
ally work only in the license-free radio bands and are typically less expensive because of 

348 
Chapter 8 ■ Site Survey, Capacity Planning, and Wireless Design
spectrum limitations. Spectrum analyzers allow you to view the Physical layer of commu-
nication between devices used in wireless networking. Spectrum analyzers that work with 
IEEE 802.11 wireless networking technology are available in devices that attach to a USB 
port on the computer and instrumentation-style devices that can be used for applications 
other than wireless networking. Legacy solutions are PC card-based models, which may 
still be available in some markets. Figure 8.9 shows an example of a wireless network spec-
trum analyzer that connects to a USB port on a computer.

Some manufacturers of wireless network equipment integrate spectrum analyzer tools 
into devices such as wireless access points or wireless LAN controllers for constant moni-
toring of the radio frequency. This feature is used for troubleshooting and allows a network 
administrator to monitor the RF in any part of the company. Some manufacturers offer 
stand-alone products that can be used to monitor more specifi c areas. Here are some manu-
facturers of wireless network spectrum analyzers:

802.11 wireless networks that operate in the same radio frequency range. Although a spec-
trum analysis is not a requirement for a wireless site survey, it is benefi cial in most medium- 
to large-scale deployments of wireless networks. Because of the vast number of devices 
that use unlicensed radio bands, spectrum analysis can be considered an ongoing process. 
Performing regular spectrum analysis gives wireless network engineers the capability to 
monitor the area in which wireless devices are located for RF interference and other issues.

designed for IEEE 802.11 wireless networks.

Wi-Fi and Non-Wi-Fi Interference Sources
The performance of a wireless network can be signifi cantly affected by various types of 
interference sources. Interference may be either intentional or unintentional and caused 
both by IEEE 802.11 wireless networks and by other devices that also operate in the 2.4 
GHz ISM or 5 GHz U-NII band. The use of portable and mobile devices that employ radio 
frequency for communication continues to rise, so interference from these devices is also 
more prevalent. As mentioned in previous chapters of this book, these interfering devices 
typically operate in the unlicensed radio spectrum 2.4 GHz ISM band. Other sources of 
interference from the industrial, medical, and scientifi c communities will also affect the 
amount of interference. Non-Wi-Fi interference in the ISM band can be caused by devices 
such as these:
 
■
Microwave ovens
 
■
Cordless telephones
 
■
Medical equipment

This is by no means a complete list, but it does contain some of the devices used daily 
that may cause some level of interference in the world of wireless networking. Figure 8.11 
shows an example of interference caused by a microwave oven. Microwave ovens operate in 
the 2.4 GHz frequency range and, depending on the unit, may cause interference with IEEE 
802.11 wireless networks.

Wi-Fi Interference
Wi-Fi interference is caused by IEEE 802.11 wireless network devices that operate in the 
2.4 GHz ISM or 5 GHz U-NII bands. In some cases, this is the largest source of interfer-
ence for wireless networks. There are two types of Wi-Fi interference: co-channel interfer-
ence (other devices on the same channel) and adjacent channel interference (other devices 
on overlapping channels). The following network types will cause Wi-Fi interference:
 
■
FHSS networks: 2.4 GHz (Legacy)
 
■
DSSS networks: 2.4 GHz
 
■
ERP-OFDM networks: 2.4 GHz
 
■
OFDM: 5 GHz
 
■
HT-OFDM: 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz (802.11n)
 
■
VHT-OFDM: 5 GHz (802.11ac)
Wi-Fi devices that cause interference can be operating in either infrastructure mode 
or ad hoc mode. The number of devices that are part of the wireless network will also 
determine the extent of the interference. In Chapter 5, we discussed different types of 
spread spectrum technologies that wireless networks use to communicate. FHSS, DSSS, 
ERP-OFDM, OFDM, HT-OFDM, and VHT-OFDM are technologies used for IEEE 
802.11 wireless networking in the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands. However, some of these 
technologies are used in non-wireless-network devices as well. For example, Bluetooth 
devices operating in the 2.4 GHz ISM band also use FHSS technology for communication. 
Zigbee devices operate in the 2.4 GHz band and use DSSS technology for communication. 
Depending on the manufacturer, 2.4 GHz cordless phones may use either FHSS or DSSS. 
Performing an RF spectrum analysis is one way you can determine the source of this type 
of interference. If an instrumentation spectrum analyzer (a calibrated device that has the 
capability to view entire radio spectrums) is used, it will be necessary to understand how to 
interpret the data collected as well as how to operate the device.
It is important to note that IEEE 802.11 FHSS wireless LANs are legacy 
networks and unlikely to found with today’s wireless installations. I men-
tion this here because although it is unlikely, you could possibly encounter 
them. Also, FHSS is used with other wireless technologies such as Blue-
tooth devices.

356 
Chapter 8 ■ Site Survey, Capacity Planning, and Wireless Design
Standards vs. Industry Deﬁ nitions of Interference
The 802.11 standard loosely deﬁ nes an adjacent channel as any channel with nonoverlap-
ping frequencies for the DSSS and HR/DSSS PHYs. With ERP and OFDM, the standard 
loosely deﬁ nes an adjacent channel as the ﬁ rst channel with a nonoverlapping frequency 
space.
This contradicts how the term adjacent channel interference is typically used in the mar-
ketplace. Most Wi-Fi vendors use this term to loosely mean both interference resulting 
from overlapping cells and interference resulting from the use of overlapping frequency 
space. For example, vendors typically use this term in a case where AP-1 (channel 1) is 
located near AP-2 (channel 2).
Adjacent channel interference is a performance condition that occurs when two or more 
access point radios are providing RF coverage to the same physical area using overlap-
ping frequencies. Simultaneous RF transmissions by two or more of these access point 
radios in the same physical area can result in corrupted 802.11 frames because of the 
frequency overlap. Corrupted 802.11 frames cause retransmissions, which result in both 
throughput degradation and latency.
Co-channel interference is a performance condition that occurs when two or more 
independently coordinated access point radios are providing RF coverage to the same 
physical area using the same 802.11 channel. Additional RF medium contention overhead 
occurs for all radios using this channel in this physical area, resulting in throughput deg-
radation and latency.
Spectrum Analysis for Cellular Communications
Most newer-model wireless mobile devices have multifunction capabilities that allow them 
to be used for voice and data applications. The capabilities may include cellular voice com-
munications, 3G, 4G, LTE, WiMAX, and Wi-Fi. 
In the previous section you learned the importance of understanding the type of radio 
frequency coverage and interference sources that are contained within the physical area 
you intend to use for wireless networking. As wireless technology continues to evolve, 
the same concepts apply to cellular communications. One main difference between these 
technologies is which frequency bands are used in addition to what or who generates the 
RF signals. In a wireless local area networking deployment, the RF that is intended to be 
used for communications is generated from within the buildings from wireless infrastruc-
ture devices such as wireless access points, bridges, and the like. With cellular communi-
cations, the signal is generated from wireless cellular carriers and you are relying on the 
signal from outside to propagate throughout the building. The antennas or towers that 

Radio Frequency Spectrum Analysis 
357
provide the RF for cellular devices will encompass very large areas that may or may not 
provide adequate signal quality within the same physical space where the wireless local 
area network is installed. Therefore, having a good understanding of the RF spectrum as 
it pertains to wireless cellular technologies is equally important, and it is diffi cult to rely 
on cellular signals from outside to cover all areas inside of a building. A lower level or 
basement level of a building is one good example where you could experience weak cel-
lular signal levels. 
In Chapter 3 we looked at distributed antenna system (DAS) technology. You learned 
that RF signals such as cellular phone communications that are received from outside a 
structure or building are already weak or barely above the desired receive signal thresh-
old. Bringing that signal in from the outside and allowing it to be at an acceptable level 
in a building can be accomplished using DAS. This antenna technology may use several 
antennas that create small cells as opposed to a single antenna to provide wireless coverage 
throughout an entire area or building. 
A spectrum analyzer that is designed for these frequencies will allow you to test the 
entire building for the cellular coverage and determine if it is at an acceptable threshold 
level.  Figure 8.12 shows a commercial off-the-shelf laptop-based USB spectrum analyzer 
that is used to capture radio frequency bands used with cellular communications. 
F I G U R E  8 .12   The AirMagnet ES from Fluke Networks shows the USB spectrum 
analyzer for cellular networks in action.
You will notice in the fi gure the spectrum analyzer device connects to a USB port in 
a laptop computer or tablet device and uses an ultra-wideband antenna. The supplied 
antenna is ground plane independent with an SMA male connector and swivel mechanism 
that allows the antenna part to be rotated in various directions. This antenna is backward 
compatible with cellular applications such as GSM, UMTS, and LTE and covers all avail-
able cellular bands across the globe, signals between 698 MHz and 2690 MHz. In Exercise 
8.2, you will install a demonstration version of the AirMagnet Spectrum ES from Fluke 
Networks. Keep in mind that this will allow you to view a recording of a capture. You will 
need to purchase the product from Fluke Networks to perform live captures.

Understanding radio frequency as it pertains to cellular technology is becoming more 
important in relation to indoor wireless networking. Many wireless infrastructure devices 
now contain cellular capabilities that will allow for 3G or 4G failover connectivity in the 
event of a WAN or Internet outage. This failover will allow a company to maintain WAN 
connectivity even though the wired connection to the company has failed for whatever rea-
son. Several manufacturers of IEEE 802.11 wireless networking equipment provide branch 
offi ce or remote offi ce solutions that provide this type of failover functionally. Figure 8.13 
shows a solution that will provide wireless cellular WAN connectivity in the event of a 
wired WAN (cable modem, DSL, T1, and so on) disruption or outage.

Received Signal Strength
The main objective of a wireless network is to provide access to computer network 
resources and services for wireless devices that are connected to the network. This means 
it is essential for wireless client devices to have reliable connectivity to the wireless network 
infrastructure. To provide this connectivity, the wireless site survey process should include 
testing to verify that the received signal is adequate for the application of the device.
Devices that communicate wirelessly require two-way communications in order to oper-
ate correctly. This means the receiver must be able to receive enough of the signal to deter-
mine the data that was sent from the transmitter. Wireless client devices use what is known 
as the received signal strength to show the amount of power received from a transmission. 
Figure 8.14 shows a client utility that displays specifi cs regarding the received signal.
The amount of received signal strength required will be determined by the type or appli-
cation of the wireless device as well as the amount of radio frequency noise in the area. 
RF noise consists of extraneous undesired radio signals in the area emitted by a variety of 
devices other than the transmitter. You should check with the device manufacturer to deter-
mine the minimum amount of received signal that is acceptable for a specifi c application. 
Some applications will require more received signal than others. For example, the manu-
facturer of a voice handset used with a Wi-Fi network may recommend a minimum of –65 
dBm to –67 dBm, whereas a computer network card may require a minimum of –70 dBm.

Received Signal Strength 
363
F I G U R E  8 .14   Broadcom Wireless Utility shows signal, noise, and data rate.
The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is the difference between the received signal and the 
noise fl oor. For example, if the received signal is –65 dBm and the noise fl oor is –95 dBm, 
then the signal-to-noise ratio will be 30 dB. This value is calculated by subtracting the 
received signal from the noise. In this case, –65 dBm – (–95 dBm) = 30 dB.
The recommended signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for most wireless networks 
is a minimum of 20 to 25 dB.
In wireless network technology, the received signal strength indicator 
(RSSI) value is an arbitrary number assigned by the device manufacturer. 
There is no standard for this value, and it will not be comparable between 
devices from different manufacturers. When performing a site survey, 
whenever possible it is beneficial to survey with the same network adapter 
model that will be used in the deployment. This will provide more accurate 
results for the client devices using the network.

364 
Chapter 8 ■ Site Survey, Capacity Planning, and Wireless Design
With respect to a cellular signal, an acceptable received signal value will be a little 
more liberal. The acceptable signal for most cellular devices is three bars; I’m kidding, but 
to some people that would not be funny. Most cellular phones have a screen that shows 
between one to fi ve bars that represent signal strength. This graphical representation is 
derived from a formula in the fi rmware that is contained within the device. The formula 
will use the received signal value to represent that signal in a graphical fashion using bars, 
dots, or other means. Most smartphones include a diagnostic screen that will allow you to 
view what the actual value is, as shown in Figure 8.15.
F I G U R E  8 .15   iPhone 5 showing the received signal value in dBm
Received signal
strength = –92 dBm
The Verizon Wireless website states that “the RSSI should be greater than –58 dBm (e.g., 
–32 dBm). A value of –96 dBm indicates no signal. If the signal is between –82 dBm and 
–96 dBm, move the device to an alternate location (an outdoor location is preferable).” You 
can see the difference between what one cellular provider states is an acceptable value and 
what you learned earlier in this section pertaining to IEEE 802.11 wireless networking.
Performing a Manual Radio Frequency 
Wireless Site Survey
Although some in the industry consider the physical manual wireless network RF site sur-
vey process “old school,” it provides some of the most accurate results when it comes to 

Performing a Manual Radio Frequency Wireless Site Survey 
365
obtaining certain information. A manual site survey requires a physical walk-through of 
the area, recording information to determine the performance of clients and devices that 
will be connected to the wireless network. This type of site survey can be very accurate 
because the surveyor is recording actual statistics, such as the following:
 
■
Signal strength
 
■
Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
 
■
Data rate of connected devices
 
■
Radio frequency interference
These measurements are recorded while the site surveyor is physically moving through 
the facility or location. Recommended received signal strength and signal-to-noise ratio 
(SNR) values were discussed earlier in this chapter. Small-scale manual site surveys can be 
performed inexpensively by using a wireless client adapter with site survey functionality, 
one of several freeware/shareware utilities, or commercial software designed specifi cally for 
this type of application. Figure 8.16 shows an example of a free site survey software pro-
gram that can be used for very basic measurements.
F I G U R E  8 .16   Ekahau HeatMapper, a Wi-Fi coverage mapping site survey software 
utility, is a free download from Ekahau.
The manual site survey process can be used for recording measurements to determine the 
actual placement of hardware infrastructure devices and for spot checking, locating other 
IEEE 802.11 wireless networks, or verifi cation after a predictive site survey has determined the 
placement of these devices. Not too long ago this manual process was the only way to perform 
a wireless site survey. The main advantage of the manual process is accuracy. One disadvan-
tage is that it can be very time consuming, depending on the extent of the installation. 

366 
Chapter 8 ■ Site Survey, Capacity Planning, and Wireless Design
The process for a manual RF site survey will vary depending on the individual who is 
performing the survey. However, there are some common components and considerations 
that may be included: 
 
■
Obtaining a floor plan or blueprint
 
■
Identifying existing wireless networks
 
■
Testing access point placement
 
■
Analyzing the results
 
■
Considering the advantages and disadvantages of manual site surveys
 
■
Performing a software-assisted manual site survey
 
■
Using a manual site survey toolkit
Understanding each of these components will help provide a more accurate site survey 
and successful wireless network deployment.
Obtaining a Floor Plan or Blueprint
The fi rst step in a manual site survey is to review a fl oor plan or blueprint of the location. 
Many in the industry refer to a fl oor plan as a map. This could be a simple sketch and is 
required to note access point placement as well as readings. The readings to note on the 
fl oor plan include signal strength and signal-to-noise ratio values from client devices. 
Figure 8.17 shows a basic fl oor plan of a small offi ce building. The fl oor plan should be 
marked with approximate access point locations. In some cases, a fl oor plan or CAD 
 drawing of the location may not be available. Depending on the size of the location, a fi re 
evacuation plan could be photographed or scanned in and used as a starting point to create 
a drawing and may be adequate for the site survey.
The floor plan and approximate access point locations used in these exam-
ples are for illustration purposes only.
Identifying Existing Wireless Networks
As part of a manual site survey, you should identify existing wireless networks in the area, 
noting locations that include possible sources of radio frequency interference and may 
have an impact on the wireless network that will be installed. Using a device or software 
program designed specifi cally for wireless networks would be ideal. However, freeware 
or shareware programs may be satisfactory. Figure 8.18 shows an example of a software 
 program that can be used to fi nd existing IEEE 802.11 wireless networks.

Chapter 8 ■ Site Survey, Capacity Planning, and Wireless Design
Testing Access Point Placement
Once you have identifi ed potential locations for access points, you can start testing the 
proposed access point placement. This can be done by temporarily mounting an access 
point at the desired location to get the most accurate results. In some cases, a tool or fi xture 
made specifi cally for wireless site surveys or even a tall ladder could be used as a temporary 
mounting solution. Refer to the documentation that was created prior to going on site for 
mounting locations.
It is always best to use test access points from the same manufacturer and, if possible, 
the same model that will be used in the actual deployment during the pre- and post-
deployment manual site survey process. This practice will yield a better outcome than using 
generic access points during testing. Figure 8.19 shows an example of a temporary mount-
ing solution.
F I G U R E  8 .19   Access point temporarily mounted using an expandable light pole
Using one or possibly two temporarily mounted access points, document the results of 
the testing while moving around the facility. One testing method is the active survey pro-
cess and requires the client device used for the survey to perform an IEEE 802.11 authen-
tication and association to the test access points. This will provide the active connection. 
The passive survey process (listening to all access points in the area) may also be used for 
this type of site survey. The area to be tested should include a reasonable proximity around 
the temporarily mounted access point. The extent should be the desired minimum received 
signal threshold; –67 dBm, for example. The information recorded and documented will 

Performing a Manual Radio Frequency Wireless Site Survey 
369
depend on the surveyor but commonly includes signal strength and signal-to-noise ratio. It 
may be necessary to make adjustments to access point mounting during the testing process, 
based on the results of the onsite testing process. It would be benefi cial to test an actual 
wireless client device and software application that will be used with the network to see if 
the performance meets expectations. Software-assisted surveys, as described later in this 
chapter, are commonly used for a site survey of any size in today’s wireless deployments.
Analyzing the Results
Once all the testing is complete, it is necessary to perform an offl ine analysis to determine 
the fi nal placement of access points or other infrastructure devices that may be used in the 
wireless deployment. This may include making adjustments from the original plan prior 
to testing or possibly adding and removing access points. The use of various antennas may 
also need to be analyzed and documented.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Manual 
Site Surveys
There are several advantages and disadvantages to the manual site survey process:
 
■
Advantages
 
■
It is accurate because it is based on actual readings.
 
■
Physical characteristics of building are physically tested (attenuation values).
 
■
Allows verification of actual RF signal coverage and interference.
 
■
Allows marking exact installation locations of infrastructure hardware 
while onsite.
 
■
Disadvantages
 
■
It can be time consuming.
 
■
Usually only one access point is used for testing, so readings will need to be 
merged.
 
■
Requires a physical walk-through of entire location.
 
■
Many areas require an escort and special clearances for access.
WLAN infrastructure equipment used in a manual site survey should be 
from the same manufacturer as the hardware that will be installed in the 
actual deployment. Although in some cases it may be difficult to accom-
plish, using a site survey client device to replicate what will be used in the 
actual environment is always recommended. This will minimize any poten-
tial issues from variations between manufacturers’ devices.

Software-Assisted Manual Site Survey
The manual site survey technique discussed earlier may be adequate for smaller deploy-
ments or for organizations that have limited resources and budget. Manual site surveys can 
also be accomplished with the aid of commercial software programs designed specifi cally 
for this process. These programs vary in cost, complexity, and features and contain many 
advanced features:
 
■
Capability to perform both passive and active surveys
 
■
Capability to import floor plans with support for many graphic formats, including 
JPG, BMP, and CAD formats
 
■
Capability to record critical data such as signal and signal-to-noise ratio
 
■
Visual representation of RF signal propagation of surveyed areas
 
■
Post-survey offline analysis of collected data
The Passive Wireless Site Survey
A passive site survey consists of monitoring the air and recording the radio frequency infor-
mation from all wireless access points and wireless client stations or devices in the “hearing 
range” of the surveying station and includes radio frequency information from your own 
and neighboring devices. This type of site survey does not require an IEEE 802.11 authen-
tication and association to an access point, and no traffi c is passed between the survey sta-
tion and the access point. A passive survey will provide an overall snapshot of the RF in use 
in or around the location, including RF noise and other IEEE 802.11 wireless networks in 
the area. It is used to get an overall picture of the wireless network access points that are 
transmitting within the area being surveyed. Figure 8.20 shows an example of a commer-
cial site survey application in passive mode.
Since passive site surveys do not require an association to an access point, all radio 
 frequencies will be detected, displayed, and recorded. Most commercial software applica-
tions with this functionality will have the capability to fi lter the coverage map on specifi c 
access points from the information that was recorded.
The Active Site Wireless Survey
An active site survey consists of a survey device such as a notebook computer associating 
to an access point prior to taking readings and collecting the data. Some claim this type 
of manual survey will provide more accurate results because of this direct IEEE 802.11 
authentication and association to an access point. The association of the survey device to 
an access point will actively send and receive some basic RF information to and from the 
access point, allowing the information about signal strength and noise levels to be recorded. 
Figure 8.21 shows a commercial site survey performing an active site survey.

Performing either a passive or active site survey using software involves many of the 
same steps discussed in the section “Performing a Manual Radio Frequency Wireless Site 
Survey” earlier in this chapter. The main difference is the features and capabilities that are 
available in these commercial software packages. These elaborate features will eliminate 
the need to manually document and record all the information obtained while walking the 
area because the program handles this task for the surveyor.
In Exercise 8.3 you will explore the Ekahau HeatMapper site survey program. If you

Chapter 8 ■ Site Survey, Capacity Planning, and Wireless Design
Manual Site Survey Toolkit
To perform a manual site survey, you need a toolkit containing essential components. A 
fl oor plan or blueprint is required to record data collected during a manual site survey. If a 
software program is used, both an electronic version of the fl oor plan and a paper printout 
are necessary. Site survey toolkits will vary in complexity and cost. Planning the equipment 
and tools you will need for a manual site survey is very important. I recommend you take 
everything you will need and not take items you will not need. Taking items you do not 
need creates an unnecessary burden. Many times you may be the only person performing 
the physical survey, and therefore you need to realize your physical and time limitations. 
You can create your own site survey kit based on what you will need, or you can purchase 
from a manufacturer a kit that is built specifi cally for this purpose.
A variety of items might be included in a wireless site survey kit. Now take a look at 
some of the most common items, and keep in mind that the kit will vary based on the site 
survey and the person performing the site survey.
Spectrum Analyzer (Optional but Highly Recommended)  A spectrum analyzer is an 
optional but recommended item that may be used in an RF wireless site survey. This device 
will sweep the area to look for devices that may cause interference with the deployment 
and locate all the radio frequency information in the area. Spectrum analyzers vary in cost 
and features, as discussed earlier in this chapter. Although “optional,” this tool is highly 
recommended.
Wireless Access Points  One or two access points are needed to take signal measurements 
during the manual site survey process. It is important to use access points from the same 
manufacturer and if possible the same model that will be installed, to simulate what will be 
used in the actual installation. If this cannot be achieved, try to get an access point that is 
as close as possible to those that will be used in the deployment.
I recommend that you set the test access points’ output power level at 
about 50 percent or less during the site survey. This usually requires lower-
ing the default power, which in many cases is set at maximum. This will 
allow for adjustments after installation to help compensate for potential 
differences from when the space was originally surveyed. The output 
power settings used will be determined by the individual performing the 
site survey. It is also important to keep in mind that if you are performing a 
site survey for both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands, the amount of RF trans-
mit power as well as the gain of the antennas must be taken into consid-
eration because of the difference in wavelength, which will in turn affect 
the range.
Wireless Client Device Such as a Notebook Computer, Wi-Fi-Enabled Smartphone, or 
Tablet  A device to take measurements from the client side is an important component of 
the site survey kit. This can be a notebook computer or tablet with appropriate software 

Performing a Manual Radio Frequency Wireless Site Survey 
379
to take signal measurements. Size and weight should be considered as well. A Wi-Fi, VoIP 
handset may also be used for locations that are considering WLAN Voice over Internet 
Protocol (VoIP) capabilities. It is best to try to match the survey client devices with those 
that will actually be used in the wireless devices connecting to the wireless network. 
However, this is not required.
Portable Battery Packs or Extension Cords  Portable battery packs to temporarily power 
the wireless access points are highly recommended. However, if these are not available, 
extension cords are a good substitute. The disadvantage of extension cords is that they 
require accessible AC power outlets, which might not be available at all sites. Also, they 
may be diffi cult to use and can be cumbersome. An extra battery pack for the survey device 
is also recommended. Battery packs specifi cally designed for wireless site surveys are avail-
able from a variety of manufacturers. Most battery packs will last longer than the surveyor.
Various Antennas (If Required)  If antennas other than those mounted directly to an 
access point will be used in the deployment, a variety of them should be on hand for testing 
during the site survey process. If 802.11n technology will be tested during the site survey, 
appropriate 802.11n antennas will be required as part of the site survey kit. If you do not 
plan to use different antennas, there is no value in taking them along during the survey.
Temporary Mounting Hardware  Mounting hardware for temporarily mounting access 
points and antennas should also be considered, including expandable poles, brackets, tape, 
and nylon tie straps. You may have to be creative when it comes to temporary mounting. It 
is critical to make safety a number-one priority when performing this task.
Measuring Device, Either Tape or Wheel  A measuring tape or wheel is recommended 
for measuring distance to wiring closets and distance between access points and any other 
areas where distance is important. Laser measuring tools are also available, but many are 
capable of only short distances. If possible, it would be benefi cial to have both a tape (or 
wheel) and a laser measuring device.
Digital Camera  As they say, a picture is worth a thousand words. Using a digital camera 
to take photographs of situations that may be diffi cult to explain in writing is a great help. 
This also adds quality to wireless site survey reports. Digital camera technology is now 
inexpensive, and most smartphones and tablets have this capability built in. I recommend 
taking many digital photographs when possible, especially in areas that may be diffi cult to 
describe in writing. It is better to have the photographs if the need arises than to wish you 
had them. Photographs of potential access point locations are valuable should physical limi-
tations of the facility come into question. Also, photographs of existing devices are useful 
to determine if they are damaged or poorly deployed and need to be revisited as part of the 
new device deployment.
Pens, Pencils, Markers, and Paper  Documentation is a critical part of wireless site surveys 
as well as all other areas of the network. Keeping thorough and accurate notes will allow 
the surveyor to document areas of importance. Even with the advanced portable technol-
ogy you have in your possession, it is always a good idea to have paper and writing utensils. 
Markers can also be used to identify the locations where access points will be installed.

380 
Chapter 8 ■ Site Survey, Capacity Planning, and Wireless Design
Ladders or Lifts  Ladders or lifts are required for mounting temporary access points and 
antennas. The height of the ladder or lift will depend on the mounting locations for the 
access points. Keep in mind that the surveyor may not be allowed to use a ladder or lift at 
certain locations or in some areas. You may have to work with the facility manager to get 
someone who will be able to perform this task. 
If heavy equipment is required to install an access point in the final loca-
tion, several items should be considered. What is the cost of the equipment 
and does this cost fit into the budget? Will the equipment physically fit 
into the area where the access point needs to be installed? Will any special 
training be required to operate the equipment, or do you need to factor in 
the cost to hire an experienced operator? In some cases an alternate loca-
tion to mount the access point may be a more cost-effective solution.
Movable Cart  A movable cart or dolly to move all equipment used for the site survey will 
ease the burden of getting the equipment moved safely around the facility. Depending on 
the amount of site survey equipment and the number of access points, batteries, poles, lad-
ders, and so on, it can be a cumbersome task to move all this around. This is especially true 
in larger facilities, and carts make this task much easier.
Performing a Predictive Modeling Site 
Survey
A predictive modeling site survey can be an accurate way to design a wireless network 
without having to spend time on site performing a physical walk-through and testing of 
the entire location. A predictive modeling site survey is a software-based site survey in 
which a fl oor plan (map) or drawing of the area to be surveyed is imported into a software 
 program. The program then simulates the radio frequency propagation from access points 
by using the attenuation properties of various structural components and provides a cover-
age map based on the information that was input into the program. The surveyor can trace 
over walls, windows, doors, and other elements of the physical location in order to esti-
mate the RF attenuation and show how the RF propagates based on the environment. This 
type of site survey can be performed in several different ways depending on the equipment 
used. You can use a stand-alone commercial software program designed specifi cally for 
this purpose, or in some cases, manufacturers build this site survey functionality directly 
into a wireless controller. Some manufacturers now have Internet-based wireless site survey 
programs, and the design is performed online. You will see more information on Internet-
based survey tools later in this chapter. 

Performing a Predictive Modeling Site Survey 
381
A predictive modeling site survey requires the wireless engineer or surveyor to input a 
fl oor plan drawing of the facility, such as a CAD, JPEG, BMP (or other format) fi le, directly 
into the software program, in the controller, or to the online program. Then, details such 
as the attenuation values of the facility are added. The details can include the following 
information:
 
■
Type of walls, such as drywall, brick, or poured concrete
 
■
Thickness of walls
 
■
Types of windows, including glass, thickness, and coating
 
■
Type of doors, such as hollow core, solid core, fire doors, wood, steel
 
■
Location of certain types of furnishings, such as cubicle offices
 
■
Height of the ceiling
One thing to keep in mind about a predictive modeling site survey is that the accuracy 
and fi nal results are only as good as the information that was input into the program. 
Basically it equates to “garbage in, garbage out.” It is essential for the surveyor to use 
accurate information about the location, including the attenuation value of all the building 
materials. Figure 8.22 shows a predictive modeling wireless site survey tool.

Hybrid Approach to Wireless Site Surveys
Another common approach a wireless network site surveyor will use is a hybrid method. 
This will combine both the physical manual site survey and the predictive model site 
survey. This method can give “the best of both worlds” and will allow you to check the 
physical installation location, make notes, place an access point to take signal readings in 
key areas, and get some spectrum analysis data. You will be able to apply the information 
collected to a predictive model to get more accurate results.
Performing a Post-Site Survey
Regardless of which survey method is used for the RF wireless site survey, you should 
conduct a fi nal post-site survey. This task should be included in the initial scope of work. 
The post–site survey can be a walk-through where you spot check the coverage and signal 
strength. You should test known or suspected problem areas. This will give you a snapshot 
of the overall wireless installation. A better and more thorough method would be to do a 
complete walk-through in every area checking and recording the coverage and providing a 
coverage map. Using one of the software-based site survey programs previously discussed 
will allow you to do a passive, active, or predictive site survey and give you an accurate 
footprint of the overall wireless coverage.  A post-site survey will allow you to test the 
roaming capabilities of different wireless clients and mobile devices that may be used in the 
actual wireless installation. This type of survey may be time consuming on a large facil-
ity, but it will give you not only a footprint of RF coverage but also a baseline for ongo-
ing monitoring and troubleshooting. When performing a post-site survey, use the same 
devices  used to perform the initial manual site survey. Include a walkabout on the exterior 
perimeter of the building in order to record the RF signal around the building. During the 
post-site survey, not only can you record the RSSI and SNR of the RF signal, you can detect 
and record any dead spots or areas of RF interference to validate the design. The goal of 
the post-site survey is to ensure that the signal level meets the design goal. Most industry 
experts recommend a threshold of –65 dBm to –67 dBm as a minimum for best perfor-
mance for both data and voice.
Protocol Analysis
Wireless network protocol analyzers are becoming a common tool, and many network 
administrators will have one as part of their wireless network toolkit. A protocol analyzer 
allows a network administrator or engineer to view all wireless frames that are traversing

across the air within the hearing range of the analysis device. At one time, performing a 
protocol analysis was a specialty task, and without extensive training few people had the 
skills to perform it. Along with the evolution of wireless networking technology in recent 
years, protocol analyzers are becoming more mainstream, more affordable, and easier to 
use. Many variations of analyzers are available in the market today. Here are some of the 
manufacturers and their products:

Most wireless protocol analyzers require the use of certain network 
 adapters and in many cases a special device driver. I recommend that 
you verify that you have access to an adapter supported by the protocol 
 analyzer’s manufacturer.
Protocol analyzers are available in software programs that can be installed on a note-
book computer, and they’re are also available in specialty dedicated handheld devices. 
Many analyzers are feature rich, with the capability to view security information, perform 
legislative compliance analysis and reporting, and generate a variety of reports in addition 
to performing protocol analysis or frame decoding. Figure 8.23 shows an example of a 
wireless network protocol analyzer. Some manufacturers of enterprise wireless equipment 
provide remote packet analysis capability that allows protocol analysis from any location. 
Most wireless intrusion prevention system (WIPS) sensors also have this capability.

F I G U R E  8 . 2 3   OmniPeek by WildPackets identifies nearby wireless networks.
The main goals of a wireless network analyzer, or any protocol analyzer, are to trou-
bleshoot network problems, gather information about security issues, and optimize the 
network’s performance. When it comes to wireless site surveys, a protocol analyzer is a 
valuable tool for evaluating which wireless devices are currently in the same RF space 
where the proposed wireless network will be deployed. They can also be used to view 
the signal strength, security implementations, network name or SSID, and the channels 
on which access points and other devices are currently operating. An analyzer will show 
not only access points but any wireless device that may have an impact on the site survey 
and deployment. The following devices are among those an analyzer is able to locate and 
identify:
 
■
Access points
 
■
Ad hoc networks
 
■
Wireless bridges
 
■
Mesh networks

RF Coverage Planning
As mentioned previously, one goal of a wireless site survey is to determine areas of RF cov-
erage and RF interference. The details of the required coverage and capacity in any wireless 
network are part of the wireless network design, which involves determining the need, use, 
and business requirements of the network. This was discussed earlier in this chapter. These 
factors need to be taken into consideration during a physical site survey:
 
■
Purpose of wireless network: data, voice, video and/or location services
 
■
Size of the physical location
 
■
Number of users and wireless devices, including bring your own device (BYOD) users
 
■
Obstacles that may impact RF signal propagation
 
■
Radio frequency range
 
■
Bandwidth requirements of applications to be used
 
■
Selected radio frequency of wireless network hardware
The planning process will provide some of the answers, whereas a site visit and on-site 
testing will determine others, such as obstacles, signal propagation, and RF range.
Infrastructure Hardware Selection and 
Placement
In addition to identifying areas of RF coverage and interference, a site survey will deter-
mine the best locations for wireless access points and other infrastructure devices. The cor-
rect placement of these devices is important in order to allow clients and devices to benefi t

fully from the deployment of the wireless network. The location of these devices is tradi-
tionally based on the following criteria:
 
■
Desired RF coverage
 
■
Required bandwidth
 
■
Aesthetics requirements
 
■
Applications, both hardware and software
 
■
RF cell overlap
 
■
Channel reuse patterns
Mapping out the infrastructure device placement is considered part of the planning and 
design process. Manual, software-assisted, or predictive modeling site survey processes will 
help identify the proper locations based on the items mentioned. In most cases, a prelimi-
nary visit to the location is highly recommended regardless of the size and the site survey 
method that will be used. Knowing the physical location will benefi t the entire site survey 
process because it will help identify areas of concern (see Figure 8.24).

Testing Different Antennas
In Chapter 3, we looked at various types of antennas, including omnidirectional, semidi-
rectional, and highly directional models. The characteristics and features of these antennas 

398 
Chapter 8 ■ Site Survey, Capacity Planning, and Wireless Design
were discussed, as well as the best use for each based on a specifi c scenario. Here we’ll con-
sider how best to conduct antenna testing in a wireless site survey.
As part of a manual site survey, it may be necessary to test different antennas to deter-
mine the best RF coverage. This usually requires the surveyor to connect and temporarily 
mount various types of antennas to access points in order to determine the proper radiation 
pattern and to verify RF coverage within the desired area. Some predictive modeling site 
survey programs will allow you to change different antennas so you can see how that will 
change the RF propagation pattern. A temporary antenna mounting example is shown in 
Figure 8.25.

and patch antennas
Testing Multiple Antenna Types
If different antennas will be used in the deployment, it is important for the surveyor to 
have several types of antennas as part of the site survey kit. Some organizations that  deploy 
wireless networks are extremely concerned about aesthetics; they will allow only specifi c 
types of antennas to be used. For example, if access points with removable antennas 
are used, in many cases the only type allowed will be omnidirectional antennas that are 
attached directly to the access point with a gain of about 2 or 3 dBi. Other deployments 
may use access points in which antennas are permanently attached and cannot be removed 
or changed. 

Testing Different Antennas 
399
Keep in mind that polarization of antennas must be taken into consider-
ation during a manual site survey. Polarization of antennas for infrastruc-
ture devices is critical, and tests should mimic as closely as possible what 
will actually be installed. With the variety of wireless client devices that 
may be used in a wireless network, it is a challenge to predict the polariza-
tion of all the devices that might be used. However, it is advisable for the 
surveyor to take this into consideration during the site survey.
Choosing the Correct Antennas
Choosing the correct antenna to be used in a specifi c deployment is part of the wireless 
design and site survey process. Many factors play a role in determining which antenna 
will be best for the application. Some locations have strict requirements about the type of 
antenna that may be used. Therefore, the surveyor may have to work with specifi c antennas 
to ensure proper RF coverage. Take the following factors into consideration when choosing 
antennas:
Manufacturer’s Recommendations  The manufacturer of an access point may recommend 
only a specifi c type of antenna. If this is the case, it is important to perform the site survey 
with the same type of antenna.
Customer Requirements  A customer may require that only specifi c types of antennas be 
used. In this case, the survey should be performed with the type of antenna required by 
the customer. For example, a deployment consisting of walled offi ces may require the use 
of thin access points. Usually this type of access point uses an omnidirectional internal 
antenna.
Environmental Conditions  The environment where the wireless network is installed may 
also determine the type of antenna to be used. If the location is a factory with harsh envi-
ronmental conditions, that could have an impact on the type of antenna and may also call 
for an enclosure for the access point.
Aesthetics  Many organizations are sensitive to the type of devices that are seen by 
 customers and clients. Therefore, aesthetically pleasing antennas may be required by the 
customer in order to be a good fi t for the location in which they will be used.
Required Coverage  The required RF coverage will also affect the choice of antenna as 
well as the gain of the antenna. For example, a large offi ce area may require the use of 
omnidirectional antennas that are physically attached to access points. A manufacturing 
facility may require semidirectional antennas to cover areas of the manufacturing fl oor. 
Keep in mind that in addition to being passive bidirectional amplifi ers, antennas shape the 
coverage by either an increase or decrease in antenna gain.
Number of Wireless Access Points  The number of access points to be installed in a 
location will also be a determining factor in the type of antenna to be used. An offi ce 

400 
Chapter 8 ■ Site Survey, Capacity Planning, and Wireless Design
building with a combination of walled offi ces and cubicles may have a dense deployment 
of access points with a limited number of users connecting to any particular access point. 
Omnidirectional antennas connected directly to the access point may be an adequate solu-
tion for this type of deployment. The purpose of the wireless network also affects the num-
ber of access points. For example, a wireless network that will support voice clients will 
typically require more access points than a network supporting only data. If the wireless 
network will support location services such as RFID tracking or wireless intrusion preven-
tion mitigation, additional access points with semidirectional antennas may be required due 
to the design aspects of the technology.
Physical Geometry of Location  The attributes of the physical location will have an effect 
on the type of antenna to be installed and therefore should be tested during the site survey. 
This includes propagation of the signal and attenuation of obstacles. In the case where a 
building has long hallways or corridors, a yagi antenna would be a good candidate for a 
solution.
Regulatory Agency and Local Codes  When selecting antennas, both indoors and outdoors, 
it is important to become familiar with and completely understand any radio frequency 
limits or regulations that apply from the governing body or regulatory agency or any local 
codes that exist. In addition to the radio frequency codes, these may include, for example, 
height limitations and proximity to airports. Violations of any of these may result in large 
fi nes or other penalties.
Wireless Channel Architectures
There are two common types of channel architectures available today that pertain to IEEE 
802.11 wireless networking. In wireless technology, channel architecture is the design, 
layout, or channel plan in use. In the 2.4 GHz band, for example, the use of nonoverlap-
ping channels 1, 6, and 11 would be considered a channel architecture. The two wireless 
network architectures are commonly identifi ed as multiple-channel architecture (MCA) and 
single-channel architecture (SCA).
Multiple-Channel Architecture
Most wireless network deployments today use multiple-channel architecture (MCA). This 
type of installation will use access points set to different RF channels to avoid overlapping 
channel interference, as shown in Figure 8.26. A channel plan may be used with access 

Wireless Channel Architectures

points set to specifi c channels, or in many cases automatic channel selection allows the 
devices to choose the best channel in which to operate.

Single-Channel Architecture
Single-channel architecture (SCA) is a wireless networking technology available from only 
a couple of manufacturers. SCA allows all access points to communicate on the same RF 
channel. The controller that the access points are connected to manages these access points 
and helps to avoid co-channel interference. In single-channel deployments, not all access 
points are transmitting at the same time. The controller will determine which access points 
can transmit simultaneously based on the wireless devices that are in a specifi c area. A 
wireless site survey for SCA equates to providing radio frequency coverage based on the 
access point placements as the wireless controller manages all the radio frequency.
There are a few terms you should know with respect to single-channel architecture: 
stacking, spanning, and blanketing. They all refer to a means of managing coverage in a 
single-channel architecture.
For example, let’s look at a three-story building. Each fl oor in the building may be 
assigned a channel to use; with SCA architecture, this is known as stacking. The fi rst fl oor 
would be set to channel 1, the second fl oor would be set to channel 6, and the third fl oor 
would be set to channel 11. Since all access points on the same fl oor are set to the same RF 
channel, co-channel interference or overlapping channel interference is not a signifi cant 
issue because of how the SCA technology works.
Using single-channel architecture may help save some time when it comes to the site 
 survey. It is best to follow the manufacturer’s recommendations for deployment for this 
type of system. Figure 8.27 shows an example of single-channel architecture.

Wireless Device Installation Limitations
The installation limitations of any device that will be installed and used on the wireless net-
work need to be evaluated. Sometimes things look great on paper, but when it comes time 
to actually perform the installation, it may be a little different. Various wireless devices 
may have the following installation limitations:
Wireless Access Points  An installer may run into limitations when it comes to mounting 
access points or other infrastructure devices. For this reason, the surveyor must pay close 
attention to the location where these devices will be mounted. The type of ceiling and 
mounting hardware needs to be considered. A wireless site survey should include a physical 
walk-through evaluation of the proposed mounting locations to observe any issues that may 
affect where access points, bridges, or repeaters can be mounted.
Antennas  If antennas other than those that are designed to be connected directly to an 
access point are used, special circumstances may need to be taken into account:
 
■
Mounting issues
 
■
Cabling issues
 
■
Aesthetics
 
■
Height restrictions
Ethernet/PoE  As mentioned earlier in this chapter, the maximum distance an Ethernet 
unshielded twisted-pair cable can run is 328 feet, or 100 meters, per the IEEE 802.3 stan-
dard. Part of the wireless site survey process includes verifi cation of the distance infra-
structure devices will be mounted from the wiring closet to be certain they do not exceed 
the maximum. The capabilities of the Ethernet system must also be evaluated to verify the 

Site Survey Report 
403
capacity of the wiring system. This will ensure that there is adequate connectivity for the 
new wireless infrastructure devices.
If PoE will be used, it is important to verify that the infrastructure will be able to sup-
port the number of devices that require DC power from the PoE infrastructure devices. If 
the current wired infrastructure is not PoE compliant, the infrastructure may need to be 
upgraded prior to wireless deployment. If an upgrade is not feasible, an alternate solution 
such as single port power injectors or patch panels may be required.
Local Code Restrictions  In some cases, places like elevator shafts and stairwells have 
become areas where local codes or regulations will not allow devices to be installed. This 
must be identifi ed up front for expectation purposes, especially where voice over wireless 
LAN is used so that users are aware of the limitations that may be beyond the survey’s or 
installer’s control. Also, it is important to be aware of the fact that some fi re codes may 
require plenum-rated (fi re-retardant) cable and devices in certain places where wireless net-
works will be installed. 
Site Survey Report
The survey report should be a complete document itemizing all components of the wire-
less site survey. This includes the business aspects of the wireless site survey as well as the 
physical aspects. This report should include but not be limited to notes, charts, graphs, 
photos, test results, and any other pertinent data that will have an effect on the wireless 
network deployment. Most reports will be customized based on the individual needs and 
requirements of the customer. Most commercial site survey application programs have 
built-in reporting features that can be included in the site survey report. Figure 8.28 shows 
a  sample page from a commercial site survey application with report-generation features.
The main content of the site survey report should include the following items:
 
■
Customer requirement analysis
 
■
Radio frequency interference source analysis
 
■
Radio frequency coverage analysis
 
■
Device capacity and application analysis
 
■
Infrastructure device placement and configuration information
The RF dynamics of many environments are constantly changing as more devices using 
radio frequency for communications become a part of the wireless network or share the 
same RF space. It is a wireless network engineer’s responsibility to understand that site 
requirements may also be constantly changing. Therefore, the RF site survey is becoming 
an ongoing process, and the site survey report can be seen as a living document.

Summary
In this chapter, we explored the business aspects of wireless network site surveys. The 
objective of a site survey is to fi nd areas of RF coverage and interference, understand 
 capacity planning, and determine hardware installation locations. We explored some of 
the  factors that determine the complexity of a site survey.

Chapter Essentials 
405
You saw the importance of gathering information as well as the types of information 
required to successfully perform a wireless site survey and design a wireless network. 
Anyone designing a wireless network needs to understand completely the expectations of 
how the network will perform in the environment before deploying the network. These 
expectations will be met by asking the right questions of the right people—managers and 
users of the wireless network—because they are the ones who will be using it. Having the 
appropriate documentation is a key element to a successful deployment. Accurate docu-
mentation will also help streamline some of the site survey process and the deployment of 
wireless networking hardware. Accurate documentation will help with the installation of 
cabling and access points and minimize questions about the installation.
It is essential to know the location and type of existing networks, both wired and wire-
less. If existing wireless networks are in place, you must determine what role, if any, they 
will play in the new deployment or upgrade. 
In this chapter you learned about RF coverage and capacity requirements and the factors 
to be taken into consideration to ensure proper coverage throughout the location where the 
wireless network is installed. Client connectivity requirements and other considerations 
were discussed. The types of wireless client devices that will be used, such as notebook 
computer, tablet, or bar-code scanner, must be determined. Antenna orientation to ensure 
correct polarization will need to be considered during the site survey process. We also 
looked at the type of antennas commonly used in a particular deployment scenario.
The wireless site survey process is one of the most important components of a successful 
wireless deployment. Many areas need to be considered, including an RF spectrum analysis 
to determine RF interference sources that may affect the wireless deployment. Although 
a spectrum analysis can be considered optional, it is advisable to complete one whenever 
 possible.  Spectrum analyzers are available in various types, such as instrumentation 
devices and USB adapters, and now may be part of the wireless access point.
In this chapter we compared Wi-Fi and non-Wi-Fi sources of interference, both of which 
can have an effect on the performance of a wireless network installation. 
We looked at the various types of wireless site surveys that can be performed, including 
manual and predictive modeling. We also explored the two types of manual site surveys, 
passive and active. You saw some of the items that may be included in a survey toolkit as 
well as temporary mounting examples for access points and antennas. We looked at the use 
of a protocol analyzer in a wireless site survey and how one could be used to identify exist-
ing wireless networks in the area of concern.
Finally, you learned about both multiple-channel architecture (MCA) and single-channel 
architecture (SCA) and the differences between them. Best practices for hardware place-
ment were also reviewed, including access points and antennas, as well as some of the limi-
tations that may be encountered during the wireless network site survey process.

requirements include bandwidth needs, expected coverage area, and hardware and soft-
ware applications used (for the devices and the different technologies). Understand that the 
site survey process will vary based on the business model in which a wireless network is 
deployed. These will include enterprise, manufacturing, healthcare, and public access, to 
name a few.
Understand the interview process.  Know who you should interview and the type of ques-
tions to ask during the site survey and design process. This will help ensure a more success-
ful wireless network deployment.
Identify the importance of site-specific documentation.  Know the various types of docu-
mentation required based on the business model for the wireless network site survey. This 
includes blueprints and fl oor plans as well as other important documentation.
Know the importance of identifying existing networks.  Understand the details of existing 
wired and wireless networks and be able to defi ne the characteristics of both, such as wir-
ing closet location and power requirements.
Understand the application requirements for the wireless network.  Know that different 
applications, both software and hardware applications, will have an effect on the wireless 
network design and the site survey must take this factor into consideration.
Understand RF coverage and capacity requirements.  Know the factors involved with pro-
viding adequate RF coverage within a wireless network deployment. Understand that with 
a wireless site survey, capacity requirements must be met to ensure acceptable performance.
Understand the need for an RF spectrum analysis and how to locate sources of interference.  
An RF spectrum analysis will allow you to “see” RF in an area proposed for a wireless 
network. Identify different types of RF interference that can have an effect on a wire-
less network. Cellular communications should be validated in areas that rely on cellular 
connectivity.
Know the differences between manual and predictive modeling site surveys.  A manual 
site survey typically requires a complete walk-through and testing throughout the proposed 
area where a wireless network will be deployed. A predictive modeling site survey may 
require minimal time on site and is a software-based analysis solution.
Identify two different types of manual site surveys.  Know that manual site surveys can be 
passive or active and understand the differences between each.
Know how a protocol analyzer can be used as part of wireless network site survey.

This chapter explores network traffi c fl ow in both local area 
and wide area network installations. You will learn more 
about Network layer (Layer 3) logical addressing, including 
IP addresses, subnet masks, and how to subnet a network. Understanding subnetting is an 
important topic for any network infrastructure engineer or administrator. Although there 
are plenty of tools available to help design an IP network, a basic understanding of the 
manual process of IP subnetting is good to have. As the use of mobile devices continues to 
grow quickly, the need for more network capacity and bandwidth control is becoming a big 
factor. Different types of technology and controls are available for network administrators 
and service providers to manage the available bandwidth and allow technology such as 
voice and video services to effectively provide a quality user experience. We will look at 
some of the traffi c-shaping techniques, including bandwidth restrictions and quality of 
service.
Local Area Network and Wide Area 
Network Traffic Flow
To learn about how network traffi c is handled, you will need to have an understanding 
of some basic networking concepts. Even if you are already familiar with some of this 
information, this will be a great review. In Chapter 1, “Computer Network Types, 
Topologies, and the OSI Model,” you learned about various types of networks, including 
the local area network (LAN), the wide area network (WAN), the metropolitan area 
network (MAN), and others. Recall that LANs are typically contained within the same 
physical area and usually are bounded by the perimeter of a room or building. However, 
in some cases a LAN may span a group of buildings in close proximity that share a 
common physical connection. The WAN will connect networks over a much larger 
geographic area that consists of point-to-point or point-to-multipoint connections between 
two or more LANs. The WAN links that connect LANs together may consist of leased 
lines, fi ber-optic connections, and even wireless technology. Because the physical infra-
structure is scaled to a much larger area within the WAN, routable protocols such as 
TCP/IP and more “intelligent” infrastructure devices such as Layer 3 routers are required 
for WAN traffi c fl ow.

Local Area Network and Wide Area Network Traffic Flow 
411
Local Area Network Traffic Flow
The networking technology in use, IEEE 802.3 Ethernet, for example, specifi es a maximum 
cable length of 100 meters for 10Base-T networks and is the reason this physical limitation 
exists for many LANs. Early Ethernet LANs used coax cable for the physical connections 
that made up the bus topology you learned about in Chapter 1. This physical connection was 
known as 10Base2 which is 10 Mbps, baseband transmission, and 200 meters. In reality, 
it is 185 meters, or 607 feet, long. The baseband transmission allowed a signal (computer 
data) to travel across a wire without requiring any type of modulation. These LANs also 
used the Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) access method. 
With this access method, the devices that were connected to the wired medium (usually 
PCs) would fi rst sense the medium to see if it was clear, basically to check that there were 
no other transmissions occurring. At that time, the device would send the data. If by chance 
two devices performed this process at the exact same time, a collision would occur. The 
transmitting devices would know the collision happened (collision detection), a “jam” 
signal would be sent, and they would back off for a random period of time and try again. 
Eventually, the information would get to the destination. This technology is considered a 
single collision domain, which means all nodes can hear all traffi c on the network. Figure 
9.1 illustrates the CSMA/CD process.

Because of this collision-detection method, a LAN was limited to the number of devices 
(also known as nodes) that could be connected to it. Common sense will tell you that the 
more devices connected, the more collisions you have and the poorer the performance will be. 
One way to extend this type of LAN would be to utilize a device known as a repeater. This 
infrastructure device physically connects LANs together, extending them beyond the IEEE 
802.3 standard distance limit, and has Physical layer (Layer 1) intelligence. The repeater 
lacks any kind of intelligence to manage network traffi c and will forward all of the Ethernet 
frames it encounters. So basically, the repeater is just a way to extend the length of a physical 
network cable. Just as in a single LAN scenario, collisions will occur and degrade the 

412 
Chapter 9 ■ Understanding Network Traffic Flow and Control
network’s performance. However, in this situation, with even more nodes connected, the 
performance will be worse yet because of the increased number of nodes on the larger LAN.

In Chapter 1, you also learned about the star topology. It was mentioned that the star 
topology is the most commonly used method of connecting devices together on a LAN 
today. Early LAN installations using the star topology used an infrastructure device known 
as a hub. Recall that with the high-speed linear bus topology, a break in any part of the 
cable or bad connection at any point would cause the entire network to cease to func-
tion. This is not the case with the star topology. If a cable or connection breaks, only the 

Local Area Network and Wide Area Network Traffic Flow 
413
single connected device would be affected. This type of Ethernet technology is known as 
10Base-T, which is 10 Mbps, baseband transmissions using unshielded twisted-pair wire. 
According to the IEEE 802.3 standard, the physical imitation with this medium is 100 
meters, or 328 feet. This is the distance for each connection to the central point of all 
connections, or the hub. If by chance the hub were to fail, then again, the entire network 
would cease to function. Like the bus topology, the star is a single collision domain. This 
means that if a connected device (computer, for example) were to send a transmission to the 
hub, it would be heard by every port and every device that was connected to the network. 
Basically, this means that all connected devices are sharing the bandwidth. Whether it be a 
10 Mbps hub or a 100 Mbps hub, the entire bandwidth is shared by all devices. Hubs are 
rarely if at all used with today’s LANs for network infrastructure connectivity. Figure 9.3 
shows a star topology using a hub and single collision domain. One thing to keep in mind 
is that small hubs are great to have on hand as a tool for troubleshooting purposes.

With the evolution of networking technologies, the hub was eventually replaced with the 
Ethernet switch. Unlike the repeater or hub, an Ethernet switch is a device that functions at 
the Data-Link layer (Layer 2) of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. However, the 
Ethernet switch is Media Access Control (MAC) based and does have the ability to control 
network traffi c fl ow by processing and forwarding network data. This is because the switch 
with Layer 2 intelligence has the capability to learn the MAC addresses of the connected 

414

devices. Let’s look at an example, illustrated in Figure 9.4. The fi gure shows a 16-port Ethernet 
switch with two connected devices, computer 1 and computer 8. Computer 1 is connected to 
port 1 and computer 8 is connected to port 8. At this point, the switch has learned the MAC 
addresses of the two connected devices. Therefore, when computer 1 sends data to computer 8, 
it will send the data only to the switch port that computer 8 is connected to, port 8.

This is a much more effi cient way of communication than using a hub because each 
connected device will essentially have its own dedicated link to the infrastructure, 
providing the maximum amount of bandwidth. This will allow for much better 
performance and a better experience for the connected users. At this level, the traffi c that 
passes across the LAN is organized in frames.
It’s important to note that Ethernet switches are not limited to only Layer 
2 devices. As you learned in the previous section, Layer 2 switches are 
Data-Link layer devices that operate from a MAC address perspective. 
Advanced technology switches operate at higher layers of the OSI model 
and have Layer 3 and possibly Layer 4 capabilities. Layer 3 switches have 
data routing capabilities and are able to send traffic to a receiver based on 
the best path or route.
Wide Area Network Traffic Flow
In the previous section, you saw that network traffi c in a LAN is MAC address based and 
broadcast based; therefore, without the use of additional technology, it will commonly be 
restricted to devices that are connected within the physical limitations of the connected 

Local Area Network and Wide Area Network Traffic Flow

medium. In this section, you will see how traffi c fl ows in a WAN using higher-layer protocols 
and technology.
Recall from Chapter 1 that as networking technology evolved, WANs were needed to 
expand the LAN beyond the physical limits of a single room or building. These LANs 
began to expand into larger geographical areas and were connected by point-to-point or 
point-to-multipoint connections. A WAN can be made up of private connections between 
locations or use a public network infrastructure such as the Internet. Either way, the traffi c 
must extend beyond the physical limitations of the LAN. In addition to using the physical 
MAC address of a device, we must also use a logical address or IP address of a device in a 
routable network. We use routers to connect LANs together, which will form the WAN. 
As shown in Figure 9.5, routers have more intelligence and operate at the Network layer 
(Layer 3) of the OSI model. A router differs from a hub or a switch in that it will forward 
traffi c from one LAN to another LAN using upper-layer protocols. At this point the traffi c 
is organized into packets. Recall at Layer 2 the traffi c is organized in frames.

Chapter 9 ■ Understanding Network Traffic Flow and Control
Network Subnets
In Chapter 1, you learned that the Network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model is where the 
Internet Protocol (IP) resides, which is responsible for addressing and routing data by deter-
mining the best route to take based on what it has learned or been assigned. An IP address 
is defi ned as a numerical identifi er, or logical address, assigned to a network device that is 
confi gured to use Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) on a LAN. 
Network devices that use TCP/IP and are contained within the same LAN are known to 
be on a subnetwork, which basically is a smaller part of an IP-based internetwork. You 
learned in Chapter 1 that an IPv4 TCP/IP address is a logical address (IP address) that is 
a binary 32-bit dotted-decimal address usually written in the form of www.xxx.yyy.zzz. 
An example of an IP address is 192.168.100.100. This is what is known as a Class C IP 
address. Recall that each of the four parts is a byte, also known as an octet, and is 8 digital 
bits in length. There are two main IP address types: public addresses and private addresses. 
Private addresses are unique to an internal network, and public addresses are unique to the 
Internet. Recall that these addresses consist of two main parts: the network (subnet) and 
the host (device), as shown in Figure 9.6.

Logical addresses also require a subnet mask and may have a gateway address depending 
on whether the network is routed. The IP address shown in Figure 9.6 is based on a default 
Class C subnet mask. Subnet masks will be discussed later in this chapter.
IP Address Classes
In this section, we will take a deeper look at the IPv4 (classful) addressing scheme and how 
it relates to network traffi c fl ow. It is important to understand this concept because it will 

Network Subnets 
417
help with the more complex concept of traffi c routing. TCP/IP became a more popular 
network protocol with the expansion from the LAN to the WAN. Because TCP/IP is the 
native protocol of the Internet, the demand was even greater with the development of the 
World Wide Web and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), a Layer 7 Application layer 
protocol. IPv4 addresses are divided into what are known as address classes. The address 
classes are identifi ed as Class A through Class E addresses. Table 9.1 shows how the IPv4 
address classes are identifi ed with the number of network addresses and the number of host 
addresses.
TA B L E 9.1  IPv4 address classes

256
Class D

Class E

Reserved for future use
The Class A address of 127 is reserved for testing and diagnostics and 
therefore is not included in Table 9.1. You may be familiar with the 127.0.0.1 
address, which is used as a loopback address to test the IP stack on the 
local device.
You can see in the table that the Class A addresses offer the highest number of hosts and 
the Class C addresses offer the lowest number of hosts. The Class D addresses are used for 
multicast, which is reserved for data that will be sent to groups of devices that are part of 
a multicast group, and the Class E addresses are not used and are reserved. The Internet 
Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is the organization that was given the authority for IP 
address allocation. Class A addresses were reserved early on and are held by large company 
and government organizations, among them the U.S. Department of Defense, International 
Business Machines (IBM), Hewlett Packard, and Ford Motor Company. The Class B address 
range was the next to get depleted. As Internet technology advanced, and with the continued 
need for IPv4 public IP address ranges, it was not easy for individuals or companies to 
be assigned entire IP address ranges. Instead, IP address allocations for the most part are 
handled by Internet service providers (ISPs) because with technologies such as NAT, typically 
a single IP address is all that is required for Internet connectivity.

418 
Chapter 9 ■ Understanding Network Traffic Flow and Control
Special Use IP Addresses
There are several ranges of IP addresses that are considered special use and are not available 
as publicly assigned IP addresses. These are commonly used within an organization and are 
referred to as private IP address ranges. Table 9.2 shows the ranges reserved for this purpose.

IP Subnetting
As mentioned earlier, a subnetwork is a smaller part, or section, of an internetwork. 
A subnetwork is typically defi ned by the LAN boundaries or the LAN segments. There are 
several reasons you would want to create subnetworks:
 
■
Traffic types (broadcast traffic, for example)
 
■
Performance

IP Subnetting 
419
 
■
Logical separation of the organization
 
■
Troubleshooting
 
■
Security
One reason to subnet a network is to keep certain types of network traffi c contained 
within the LAN boundaries, such as network broadcast traffi c. This type of traffi c is 
heard by every device on the network segment (LAN) and can cause performance issues 
depending on the number of nodes or devices that are connected to the LAN. Typically, 
broadcast traffi c does not cross a LAN boundary unless the infrastructure devices are 
confi gured to do so. Subnets could be defi ned by fl oors in a building, separate buildings, 
or different physical locations. Subnetting will also aid with troubleshooting network 
problems because you will know in which LAN segment a troubling device is physically 
located. Security is another reason to subnet your networks. The division of networks will 
allow for infrastructure devices to be installed, preventing access between subnets.
With newer technologies like IP subnet calculators, dividing a network into subnets is 
not as complicated as it once was. Although these online and downloadable calculators 
make the job easier, it is still good to understand the basic concepts of IP subnetting. A 
basic understanding of the binary, or base-2, numbering system is really all that is required. 
The binary system allows us to represent numbers using two different symbols, a logical 0 
(zero) and a logical 1 (one). 
Subnet Mask
Before we explore the process of IP subnetting further, it is important to understand the 
function of the subnet mask. In an IPv4 address the subnet mask is a 4-byte, 32-bit dotted-
decimal address that will identify the IP network that the host is part of. Earlier in this 
chapter you saw the different classes of IPv4 addresses that can be used within a TCP/
IP-based network. In addition to defi ning an IP address, you need to defi ne a subnet mask. 
Table 9.3 shows the default subnet masks for the IPv4 system.

Address Class
Default Subnet Mask
Class A
255.0.0.0
Class B
255.255.0.0
Class C
255.255.255.0
The subnet mask will be used in conjunction with the IP address to determine which 
network the device belongs to. Other TCP/IP parameters, such as the default gateway and 
the DNS server, may be required in order for the device to effectively communicate on 

420 
Chapter 9 ■ Understanding Network Traffic Flow and Control
the internetwork. The main goal of this section is to learn about IP addressing and subnet 
masking, so the additional parameters will not be discussed at this time. The IP address can 
be logically combined with the subnet mask, and by performing a Boolean algebra function 
known as a logical AND, you can determine which IP network the node belongs to. To do 
this, you will fi rst need to understand the method of logical ANDing. In this example, we 
will combine two digital bits and get a result:
Input A
Input B
Output
0
0
0
0
1
0
1
0
0
1
1
1
As you can see in the table, combining the two inputs (Input A and Input B) will result 
in an output. To get an output of a logical 1, both inputs must also be a 1. Any other 
combination will result in an output of 0. Now let’s look at this in the form of an IP 
address and subnet mask. We will use the IP address example of 192.168.100.100 and 
a default Class C subnet mask of 255.255.255.0. Remember, an IP address is actually a 
32-bit binary number that is represented in decimal form because that is much easier for 
humans to comprehend and use. This 32-bit address is made up of four 8-bit sections 
known as octets, which are each 8 bits in length. Each bit in the base-2 numbering system 
is identifi ed in decimal form by using 2n power, where n is the multiplier. For example, 
22 will be 2 × 2, which equals 4. Another example is 23, which is 2 × 2 × 2 = 8. From this 
logic, we can build the following table:
27
26
25
24
23
22
21
20
128
64
32
16
8
4
2
1
Rather than raising 2n power, an easier way would be to start with the number 1, double 
it each time, and you will yield the same result:
 
■
1
 
■
1 doubled = 2
 
■
2 doubled = 4
 
■
4 doubled = 8

IP Subnetting 
421
And so on. From this method you can build the same table.
Now let’s apply this to the IP address in our example of 192.168.100.100 for each octet. 
Starting with the left, or most signifi cant, octet and using the base-2 numbering system, 
192 would be the two left bits set to a 1 and all others set to a 0.

Now add the decimal numbers together based on if it is a logical 1 or a logical 0. If there 
is a 1 in the column, you will add that number; if there is a 0 in that column, you will not 
add that number. Therefore, based on the preceding table, the answer is 128 + 64 + 0 + 0 + 
0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 192. We can now do this conversion for the remaining three octets. 
The second octet is as follows:

It happens to be the same as the third octet, so that will be easy in this case, 0 + 64 + 32 
+ 0 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 0 = 100. Now, placing these octets together from left to right will yield the 
following binary number for the dotted-decimal address IP address:
192.168.100.100 = 11000000.10101000.01100100.01100100
You can see why the decimal equivalent to the binary numbers is much easier to work 
with. 
Using the Microsoft Windows Calculator to Perform Decimal-to-Binary 
Number Conversions
You just learned the manual method of performing a decimal-to-binary conversion. The 
conversion can be accomplished much easier by using the calculator with a conversion 
feature. One such calculator is built into the Microsoft Windows operating system. Let’s 
use the same example we used for the manual method earlier, 192.168.100.100. First you 
will need to launch the Microsoft Windows calculator. Unless changes are made to your 
default settings, it should show up as a standard calculator view. 
To perform the conversions, you will need to set the calculator to the programmer view. 
You can do this by clicking the View drop-down and selecting Programmer. The Alt+3 key 
combination is a shortcut that will provide the same view.

First, select the radio button for the number type you plan to enter. In this case, you 
want to enter the decimal system number 192, which represents the ﬁ rst octet of the IP 
address. Select the Dec radio button and enter 192 on the keyboard. 
Next, select the radio button for the number type you want to display, in this case Bin for 
binary. With the click of a button, you can see that the 192 decimal system number has 
been converted to 11000000 in binary.

424 
Chapter 9 ■ Understanding Network Traffic Flow and Control
One important note regarding the Microsoft Windows calculator is that it will not show 
any 0s in the 8-bit placeholders that are preceding any 1s. For example, if you enter the 
decimal system number 8 and convert it to binary, it will show up as 1000 instead of 
00001000. You always need to think in bytes, which are 8 bits.
Now that you have an understanding of subnet masking, you can use the logical 
ANDing process to combine an IP address and the subnet mask to determine the network 
address of a device. We will use an IP address from the 192.168.100.0 network and the 
default Class C subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 from the earlier example. Remember that a 
logical AND requires both bits to be a logical 1 in order to get a result of a logical 1. Any 
other combinations of 1s or 0s will result in a logical 0.

different subnet mask, 255.255.255.224, will yield a different result for the network address.

network.
Creating Subnets
Now that you have learned more about IP addresses and subnet masks, I will now explain 
how to create IP subnets using a single IP address. Recall that subnetting is dividing a 
network into smaller parts and is done for various reasons, such as traffi c types (including 
broadcast traffi c), network performance, and logical separation of an organization. Based 
on the size of the network, the network infrastructure and the logical organization will 
determine how the subnetting will be put in place. Remember, the class of the IP address 
you use will determine the number of available networks and hosts. Let’s look at one 
possible network solution in the following case study.
Creating IP Subnets
You are the network administrator for a company named ABC Insurance Company. This 
company consists of four main departments: sales, marketing, customer service, and 
human resources. The company has a total of 65 employees who work at the single 
location, and the building comprises four ﬂ oors. The organization is laid out as follows:
 
■
Sales: 15 employees
 
■
Marketing: 6 employees
 
■
Customer service: 20 employees
 
■
Human resources: 3 employees
 
■
Other: 21

You need to design an adequate subnet strategy for ABC Company’s network. The 
employees are distributed throughout the building and the counts are as follows:
 
■
4th ﬂ oor: 15 sales employees, 5 others
 
■
3rd ﬂ oor: 6 marketing employees, 3 others
 
■
2nd ﬂ oor: 20 customer service employees, 7 others
 
■
1st ﬂ oor: 3 human resources employees, 6 others
Based on the network trafﬁ c metrics you complied over a several-week period, it is 
determined that the network trafﬁ c appears to be evenly distributed between the sales, 
marketing, and customer service departments. These three departments use computers 
and Voice over IP (VoIP) telephones for their jobs. Company policy states that BYOD 
devices are not allowed. This prevents personal cell phones, tablets, and other personal 
mobile devices from being used on the corporate network. You have also determined 
there are eight TCP/IP-based networked printers throughout the building. 
Based on these numbers, you will need a minimum of 138 IP addresses, 2 for each user 
plus 8 for the network printers. This does not count addresses for ﬁ les servers, Layer 2 
network switches, routers, or other possible IP-enabled infrastructure devices. You know 
that a single Class C address will allow for 256 hosts and therefore would be adequate for 
your organizational needs. You have decided on a private Class C address of 192.168.100.0 
for internal use and as you know a Class C address will allow for a total of 256 hosts 
address if no subnets are in use. Using this address, you can now design an IP addressing 
solution that will work for your company. 
Based on your analysis, it was determined that you will need at least four subnets, 
one for each department. As a precaution, you decide to allow for extra subnets for 
potential growth and advances in technology and decided on a minimum of six subnets. 
Remember, when you subnet an IP address range, you will be “borrowing” bits from 
(continued)

IP Subnetting 
427
the host address range in order to obtain the needed network addresses. The result will 
be more networks but fewer hosts. In this case, you will need to borrow from the fourth 
octet. Recall that you use the binary base-2 numbering system for IPv4 addressing. You 
can determine how many bits you need to borrow by using 2n: 
21 = 1
22 = 4
23 = 8
It looks like you will need to borrow 3 bits, which will give you eight networks, more 
than what is required based on the current conﬁ guration. Now you can create the subnet 
mask in the fourth octet, which will be 11100000. Remember that a Class C default sub-
net mask is 255.255.255.0 and the fourth octet will be 11100000 because you borrowed 
3 bits for the host address range. As you learned earlier, this will create a third octet in 
your subnet mask of 128 + 64 + 32 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 224, and the ﬁ nal subnet mask is 
255.255.225.224. This will leave 5 bits for host addresses; raise 2 to the 5th power to get 
the number of hosts per subnet.
25 = 32 hosts per subnet
Now it is time to determine the network numbers and the host addresses for each 
network.

I want to point out that there two special subnets known as the all 
ones subnet and subnet zero. As the names imply, the all ones subnet 
will consist of a 1 in every bit location and subnet zero will include a 0 
in every bit location. RFC 950 recommended not using all 1s or all 0s. 
Therefore, in many cases you will see 2 subtracted from the number 
of networks or the number of hosts. For example, instead of providing 
eight subnets by borrowing 3 bits, 23 = 8, you would subtract 2 from the 
number of networks, resulting in 23 –  2 = 6. This would yield six usable 
subnets instead of eight. Depending on the technology used, some will 
use these special subnets.
You just learned the manual process for creating different subnets from a single IP 
address and creating a subnet mask for the different IP networks. There are tools available 
(many of them free) that will allow you to perform the same task with very little effort. 
Even though these tools do exist, it is still benefi cial to understand how to perform IP 
subnetting using the manual method you learned earlier. In Exercise 9.1, you will install a 
free subnet calculator from SolarWinds and create subnets using the same scenario from the 
previous case study.

Routing Network Traffic
Moving traffi c across a WAN or an internetwork is known as routing. A network router is 
a device that operates at the Network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model and has more intel-
ligence than Data-Link layer devices or Physical layer devices, including network bridges, 
Layer 2 Ethernet switches, and legacy Layer 1 hubs. Where Layer 2 bridges or switches will 
use MAC addresses to handle the traffi c fl ow, a Layer 3 router uses IP addresses to control 
the traffi c fl ow. Routers will use various protocols to manage the traffi c, including these 
common routing protocols:
 
■
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
 
■
Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP), which is Cisco-proprietary

■
Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP)
 
■
Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS)
 
■
Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)
 
■
Routing Information Protocol (RIP)
Traffi c can be routed through either static routes or dynamic routes. Both methods have 
their advantages and disadvantages:
Static Routing
This type of routing will route IP traffi c based on each device’s individual routing table. With 
router hardware, a network administrator will defi ne the routes manually. One advantage to 
this type of routing is that it is always known how internetwork traffi c will fl ow.
Dynamic Routing
This type of routing uses protocols that will determine the best route for traffi c to take 
across an internetwork. This differs from static routing in that the router will learn the best 
paths, or routes, based on the protocols that are used. Figure 9.8 illustrates the dynamic 
routing process.

Network Traffic Shaping
You learned earlier in this chapter about network traffi c fl ow for both LAN and WAN 
technology. Getting data or other information from one device to another can be accom-
plished in different ways, depending on whether the devices are located on the same local 
network/subnet or are across a routed internetwork. Although network infrastructures are 
getting better by becoming faster and more reliable, in many cases we still have a limited 

Network Traffic Shaping 
435
amount of capacity, or bandwidth, available. The increasing demand for mobile access 
and networking services only adds to the concern. Network traffi c shaping, also known as 
packet shaping, allows for infrastructure managers and network administrators to manage 
the way traffi c fl ows across a network, with the hope of providing a better overall experi-
ence for all users and their connected devices. The following traffi c management techniques 
are commonly used in LANs and WANs:
 
■
Backhauling network traffic
 
■
Bandwidth and user restrictions
 
■
Quality of service (QoS) 
The following sections provide an overview of these methods of traffi c management.
Backhauling Network Traffic
The term backhaul has different meanings, depending on whether it is being used in a 
wired networking, satellite, cellular, or wireless LAN communication context. In a wired 
network, a backhaul is defi ned as the network backbone or infrastructure that connects 
servers and other core devices together. With satellite communications, the term backhaul 
refers to a broadcast is center receiving raw, unedited TV signals from a satellite transmis-
sion and rebroadcasting over a cable network infrastructure. In wireless cellular communi-
cations, backhaul the communications link connecting the cellular base station tower to the 
central offi ce location or a remote site, or even tower-to-tower communications. Therefore, 
the technology used will determine the backhaul defi nitions and methods. 
As the use of mobile devices continues to increase, so does the need for more network 
backhaul capacity. According to the Cisco Visual Networking Index white paper, annual 
global IP traffi c will exceed the zettabyte threshold (1.4 zettabytes) by the end of 2017. The 
report also mentions some other key highlights:
 
■
Global IP traffic has increased more than fourfold in the past five years, and will 
increase threefold over the next five years.
 
■
Busy-hour Internet traffic is growing more rapidly than average Internet traffic.
 
■
Metro traffic will surpass long-haul traffic in 2014, and will account for 58 percent of 
total IP traffic by 2017.
 
■
Content delivery networks (CDNs) will carry over half of Internet traffic in 2017.
 
■
Nearly half of all IP traffic will originate with non-PC devices by 2017.
 
■
Traffic from wireless and mobile devices will exceed traffic from wired devices 
by 2016.
 
■
In 2017, the gigabyte equivalent of all movies ever made will cross global IP networks 
every 3 minutes.
 
■
The number of devices connected to IP networks will be nearly three times as high as 
the global population in 2017.

Chapter 9 ■ Understanding Network Traffic Flow and Control
 
■
It would take an individual over 5 million years to watch the amount of video that will 
cross global IP networks each month in 2017.
 
■
Internet video to TV doubled in 2012.
You can get and read the Cisco Visual Networking Index white paper in 
its entirety at this book’s companion website at www.sybex.com/go/
mobilecomputing.
This list gives you an idea of the amount of network traffi c that will be backhauled 
over the next several years, and how the infrastructures will need to be built or retrofi tted 
to handle the large amounts. Figure 9.9 shows one example of a backhaul using cellular 
technology.

Bandwidth and User Restrictions
As mobile technology continues to advance, we are using it more, and the need for limit-
ing and controlling the bandwidth available to users is becoming more important. Within 
a LAN, gigabit speeds are becoming more commonplace, and gigabit wireless networks are 
following. IEEE 802.11ac technology is beginning to work its way into enterprise networks, 

Network Traffic Shaping 
437
providing much higher speeds to wireless devices operating in the 5 GHz frequency band. 
Local network infrastructures are starting to be upgraded or are being built to handle the 
newest high-speed technology. Therefore, in many cases the local network can easily provide 
higher data rates and handle large amounts of data.
The main problem lies with the wide area connections outside of this LAN. Because of 
limitations either from the service provider or the technology in general, such as Digital 
Subscriber Link (DSL), these wide area connections often become bottlenecks for users 
connecting outside of their local network. 
To provide effi cient use of the available bandwidth, limits and restrictions may need 
to be put in place. The industry uses a variety of terms, such as bandwidth restrictions, 
bandwidth throttling, and bandwidth caps, but they all essentially mean the same thing. 
Regardless of what you call it, the objective is to restrict how much of the available band-
width a user is allowed, either at a point in time or over a period of time. For an enterprise 
network, this will be put in place by the IT department to provide a better overall experi-
ence for all of the users of that network. From a service provider perspective, these restric-
tions are usually in place based on the plan you have purchased from the service provider. 
The more you pay monthly for the service, the more bandwidth you will be allowed to use. 
Bandwidth restriction can be accomplished through the use of either hardware or software 
solutions. Some of the restrictions are put in place by using policies, role-based access con-
trol, or dedicated software programs, while others are put in place through settings in the 
infrastructure hardware that is in use. Figure 9.10 shows how enterprise-grade wireless 
access point management software can limit the bandwidth for the connected users. In this 
example, a wireless user connected to the DATA SSID will be able to upload at 1 Mbps and 
download at 3 Mbps.
F I G U R E 9.10  AirTight Network’s cloud-based Management Console interface allows for 
limiting bandwidth by restricting upload and download traffic for user on a per-SSID basis.

Restrictions

438 
Chapter 9 ■ Understanding Network Traffic Flow and Control
In addition to the amount of bandwidth that can be used at any point in time, network 
providers, including cellular service providers, have the capability to limit how much 
bandwidth you are allowed to use per month, or for another specifi ed period of time. Many 
cellular wireless service providers offer all-in-one plans that will allow for a specifi c amount 
of voice, text, and data that can be used in a time period, and is usually measured in 
megabits or gigabits per month. Once the allowed limit is reached, the user will be charged 
an additional amount based on the usage. Internet service providers may also allow for a 
maximum amount of bandwidth per month, with additional penalties for those that exceed 
their own limit. Penalties may include warnings, suspension of service, and additional fees.
Open Internet
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the United States issued a change 
order in 2010 for Open Internet, also known as net neutrality. The objective of this order 
is to require Internet service providers (ISPs) to treat all Internet trafﬁ c equally. This 
would restrict ISPs from speciﬁ cally controlling the type of trafﬁ c you send or receive. For 
example, if you were to watch a streaming movie from an online content provider, the ISP 
could not slow it down to allow priority to other trafﬁ c types of trafﬁ c. This order would 
also prevent ISPs from blocking access to speciﬁ c Internet content and other features. 
In 2014, a United States federal appeals court struck down the FCC’s Open Internet (net 
neutrality) rules. This will give ISPs more control on how they regulate Internet trafﬁ c and 
access to content.
Quality of Service
Certain types of network traffi c require special attention based on how they are used. 
Other types of traffi c do not. 
Let’s look at network printing, for example. When a user sends a fi le to a network 
printer, speed is not a major concern. In many cases, there may be one printer for many 
users of a LAN. The printers are usually in a central location and easily accessible to all the 
users. After a user sends a document to the printer, they will need to get up from their desk 
and walk over to the printer to retrieve the print job. In a busy environment, there may be 
several print jobs queued up that were sent by different users. Depending on the urgency, 
the user may not retrieve the print job for several minutes or even hours. The point is that 
this kind of traffi c usually has a low priority. 
Conversely, other types of network traffi c may have a high priority, such as real-time 
applications like voice, video, and some streaming content. Using VoIP is common with 
almost all enterprise wired computer networks and cellular networks, and it’s becoming 
common with most enterprise wireless networks. The same is true for certain types of 
video communications. This type of traffi c requires special attention and priority in order 
to provide the user with a good networking experience. As the name implies, quality of 
service (QoS) will provide a better quality of network communications for traffi c such 
as voice and video. Unlike sending a fi le to a printer or saving a document to a network

fi le server, using voice and video technology involves  human senses such as hearing and 
sight. If you are having a telephone conversation with another person, you want good, 
reliable communication. The same goes for attending a live, real-time videoconference. 
The best way to accomplish this is to incorporate quality of service with the network 
communications. 
One example of technology that can benefi t from QoS is using voice on a network. Voice 
communications are not bandwidth intensive, but they are subject to issues such as latency 
and jitter.
Latency
Voice and video communication are two types of networking applications that are subject 
to latency. Latency is basically a delay in the communications from the source device to a 
destination device. The latency is measured as the time value for a frame to get to a destina-
tion device. Most network engineers try to achieve a total one-way, end-to-end delay for 
voice communications of less than 150 milliseconds (ms). High latency can result in poor 
voice or real-time video communications.
Jitter
Jitter is the variation in the delay or latency of frames received by a destination device. Jitter 
can be controlled by using something known as a jitter buffer. Buffering of  information will 
allow for the data frames to be received as a steady stream of information by the receiv-
ing device. Jitter buffers may add 30 to 50 ms to the latency to reduce the effects of jitter. 
Excessive jitter can cause poor quality VoIP calls and video delays.
Providing end-to-end QoS on a network is not necessarily a simple task, and depending 
on the device types, number of devices, and network infrastructure, it may be quite com-
plex. Quality of service is a complex topic and the technical details are beyond the scope of 
this book.
Summary
In this chapter you learned about the fl ow of network traffi c, as well as the different types 
in both LAN and WAN installations. You saw that local traffi c stays within the LAN 
boundary and wide area traffi c will cross network boundaries in an internetwork. We 
explored Network layer logical addressing, including IP addresses and subnet masks, and 
how to subnet a network. You also learned about IPv4 address classes and the number of 
networks and hosts within the different classes. You learned about IP subnetting, and how 
to subnet an IP address to support different physical networks. You had a chance to see the 
manual process of creating IP subnets, and used a free tool to perform the same task in a 
much easier way. We explored the different types of technology and controls that are avail-
able for network administrators and service providers to manage the available bandwidth 
and allow technology such as voice and video services to operate effectively to provide a 
quality user experience.

Chapter 9 ■ Understanding Network Traffic Flow and Control
Chapter Essentials
Understand how traffic flows in local area networks and wide area networks.  Local area 
network traffi c is confi ned within the boundaries of the LAN. Modern LANs use TCP/IP 
for communications on the local network, which may also be used for WAN communica-
tions. Wide area network traffi c fl ow will include routing traffi c from one LAN to another 
LAN, and will require the use of more extensive network infrastructure devices. 
Understand network subnets.  Know that a subnetwork is a smaller part of an IP-based 
internetwork. A subnet can be created by borrowing bits from the host addresses to provide 
more small IP-based networks.
Know the different IP address components and classes.  Know IP address classes used with 
IPv4 technology. There are a minimal number of Class A IP network addresses and a large 
number of host addresses. A Class C network has a large number of network addresses 
with a smaller number of available host addresses.
Understand the subnetting process.  Know that all devices using the TCP/IP protocol suite 
have, at minimum, an IP address and subnet mask. The IP address is the logical identifi er, 
and the subnet mask is used to identify which IP network the device is part of.
Understand the basics of routing network traffic.  Moving traffi c across a wide area 
network or an internetwork is known as routing, and network routers are Layer 3 devices. 
Know the two different methods of routing: static routing and dynamic routing. Be familiar 
with the common routing protocols.
Be familiar with different traffic shaping techniques.  Network traffi c shaping, or pack-
ing shaping, allows for infrastructure managers and network administrators to manage 
the way traffi c fl ows across a network, with the hopes of providing a better overall user 
experience.
Understand the various network traffic backhauling types.  Backhauling traffi c is getting 
data from one location to another. This could include large fi les such as device fi rmware, 
network device confi guration fi les, and other administrative data. Understand the different 
meanings of the term backhauling based on the technology that is used.
Know how providers and network administrators can add bandwidth and user restrictions.  
These restrictions will allow better control of network traffi c fl ow and prevent users from 
monopolizing all of the available bandwidth. Also know that network service providers can 
limit the amount of bandwidth users are allowed over a period of time, such as a month.
Understand the benefits of quality of service.   Know that quality of service technology is 
benefi cial to time-sensitive data communications such as voice, real-time video, and certain 
streaming content.

Over the past several years we have seen the infl ux of mobile 
device technology and the concept of bring your own device 
(BYOD) within the corporate world. This has created 
something of an administrative challenge for the information technology professional. 
While some organizations embrace this concept, others are skeptical of the adoption for 
various reasons, including technical support and security concerns. 
In this chapter we will explore the basics of mobile device management options, including 
both on-premise and cloud-based Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions. Mobile device 
management (MDM) solutions will provide the capability to manage mobile devices of 
 various platform types that connect to the corporate network. This includes access to 
 digital applications (apps) via online stores. You will see that with MDM solutions, you 
will require special permissions to perform specifi c tasks on mobile devices. We will explore 
how mobile apps and other device information can be pushed to devices. You will also see 
that devices can be grouped based on management requirements and why high availability 
is an important feature of MDM. 
Geo-fencing (building a virtual electronic boundary) and geo-location (the ability to 
physically locate a device) are two components of the mobile location services you will 
learn about. A captive portal will allow network administrators to restrict access to a 
 network until authentication has occurred or terms and conditions have been accepted. 
This prevents users from accessing resources or services unless they have been properly 
authorized to do so. Finally, self-service portal solutions give users the ability to register 
their devices to the network, enabling quick access to the network without the need to open 
a service ticket or contact the help desk for technical support. We will take a look at both 
the captive portal and self-service portal.
Mobile Device Management Solutions
The extensive increase in the number of multifunction wireless mobile devices gives 
users the opportunity to access information of all types from anyplace that provides 
infrastructure network access via technology such as cellular connections and wireless 
LANs  (Wi-Fi). This includes the home, public venues and the workplace. Although very 
convenient and popular, this emerging mobile technology may create something of a 
challenge for the enterprise and corporate IT services professional and help desk support 
personnel. This is where mobile device management (MDM) solutions stand out. MDM 
allows network managers, administrators, engineers, and other information technology 

Mobile Device Management Solutions 
443
personnel to manage, control, and secure multiplatform device environments that may 
be used on the network.
Choosing the correct MDM solution for your networking requirements involves some 
contemplation. The correct solution must meet the needs of the organization and will 
require careful consideration to validate it does so. When it comes to MDM, there are two 
main options that exist. In-house (on-premise) solutions or cloud-based solutions, which are 
provided as Software as a Service (SaaS) technology, are widely available. MDM solutions 
include, but are not limited to, the following features:
 
■
Application distribution (push technology)
 
■
Compliance reporting
 
■
Content management
 
■
Device registration (self-service portal)
 
■
Location-based services
 
■
Multiplatform management and support
 
■
Password control
 
■
Policy enforcement
 
■
Remote lock
 
■
Remote wipe
 
■
Remote unlock
 
■
Secure communications (virtual private network)
 
■
Telecommunications expense management
You will learn more about these and other MDM features later in this chapter and in 
Chapter 13, “Mobile Device Operation and Management Concepts.” There are many 
MDM solutions available on the market today. If your organization allows employees, 
contractors, vendors, and others to use their own personal devices or company-owned 
devices to access your network, you will need to ensure that the platforms are supported in 
order to lessen support calls and other associated costs.
Most, if not all, mobile device management providers offer a free trial 
period for their software solutions and packages. I highly recommend you 
try these products prior to purchasing a specific provider’s solution. It is 
best to know that the solution you choose will meet your specific needs. 
There is no “one size fits all” when it comes to mobile device management 
solutions. Choosing the correct solution will depend on many factors, 
including business model, number of employees and devices, and com-
pany policy requirements.
You will now see an overview of both cloud-based and on-premise solutions and how 
each has its own distinct advantages and disadvantages.

Chapter 10 ■ Introduction to Mobile Device Management
The Software as a Service (SaaS) Solution
When it comes to information technology services, the term cloud seems to be the newest 
buzzword. Cloud-based solutions are commonly known as Software as a Service (SaaS) 
solutions and are not limited to mobile device management (MDM). In many cases, the 
SaaS MDM solution is a virtual on-premise solution that has many if not all of the same 
features but without the extra administration overhead and costs that go with the on-
premise model. (On-premise MDM will be discussed in the next section.) Other SaaS 
solutions include products that are truly managed services provided from certain software 
manufacturers. 
Some of the advantages and disadvantages of a cloud-based solution are as follows:
 
■
Advantages
 
■
Hardware investment is not required.
 
■
Installation and setup time is minimal compared to an on-premise solution.
 
■
Less administration overhead and potentially better availability compared to an 
on-premise solution.
 
■
Can be administered from any location where an Internet connection is 
available.
 
■
Disadvantages
 
■
Recurring monthly subscription fees.
 
■
Internet connection is required for all management and control.
 
■
Concerns for unauthorized access of data stored on cloud provider’s server if not 
properly secured.
Depending on the environment where it is deployed, the SaaS MDM solution will be a 
great fi t in many cases. I recommend additional research and reviewing the advantages and 
disadvantages to determine the best solution.
The On-Premise Solution
Many network managers and administrators have a certain comfort level with the idea of 
an on-premise mobile device management solution as with other on-premise technology. 
This is because these solutions provide direct access and more control with the installed 
products. Some of the advantages and disadvantages of an on-premise solution are as 
follows:
 
■
Advantages
 
■
Can be maintained within the organization’s data center.
 
■
No recurring monthly subscription fees.
 
■
Internet connection is not required for management and control.
 
■
Ownership of the investment including associated hardware and software. 

Mobile Device Management Solutions 
445
 
■
Disadvantages
 
■
Initial investment with required hardware and software.
 
■
Installation requires setup time and may require additional resources.
 
■
Administration overhead, backup solution, and technical support.
 
■
May require additional setup resources and administration from outside the 
 organization.
Choosing either a SaaS (cloud-based) solution or an on-premise solution requires 
considering many factors, such as corporate policy, security concerns, and cost. It is best to 
compare all features, advantages, and disadvantages prior to purchasing any one specifi c 
solution. Following are some MDM solution providers that offer on-premise solutions,

Common Mobile Device Operating 
System Platforms
There have been many mobile device operating systems over the past decade. Some have 
come and gone and others have survived. For the corporate or enterprise mobile device 
user, there are four main players in the current market: Android, BlackBerry, iOS, and 
Windows Phone.
Android  Android is an operating system based on Linux and designed for smartphones 
and tablet devices that are mostly touchscreen capable. This O/S was originally developed 
by Android Inc. in the 2007 time frame and has undergone many revisions since the fi rst 
version was released in 2008. The Open Handset Alliance (OHA) continues to update the 
operating system. The OHA is a consortium of approximately 84 fi rms that was created to 
develop open standards for mobile devices. According to a report published in early 2014 
by Good Technology, enterprise Android activations were at about 26 percent compared to 
72 percent for Apple iOS during the fourth quarter of 2013.
BlackBerry  The fi rst BlackBerry operating system was released in 1999 for the Pager 580. 
This operating system was designed by BlackBerry Ltd. and is proprietary to BlackBerry 
mobile devices. Synchronization of various corporate email services is where the BlackBerry 
operating system rose in popularity. The Good Technology report mentioned earlier did not 
include the BlackBerry operating system because of the lack of reporting by the company. 
BlackBerry 10 is the most recent release of the operating system. Although it has had its 
share of ups and downs, BlackBerry still continues to be a popular operating system in the 
corporate world.
iOS  In 2007 Apple Inc. introduced the iOS mobile operating system for the iPhone. This 
OS is now incorporated into other Apple devices, including iPod Touch, iPad, iPad Mini, and 
Apple TV devices. According to a report from Good Technology, 73 percent of all enterprise 
activations in the fourth quarter of 2013 were Apple iOS. In the third quarter of 2013 Apple 
iOS accounted for 72 percent of enterprise activations and 69 percent in the second quarter 
of 2013. These numbers show an increase in activations over the 2013 time period.

The Mobile Application Store 
447
Windows Phone  Microsoft released its proprietary mobile operating system Windows 
Phone, also known as WP, in the fourth quarter of 2010. Unlike the Apple iOS and 
Android operating systems, Windows Phone is targeted for consumer use. Windows Phone 
replaced Windows Mobile (last updated in February 2010); however, it is not backward 
compatible with Windows Mobile. According to the same report by Good Technology, 
enterprise activations for the Windows Phone OS were about 2 percent over the fourth 
quarter of 2013, a very small number compared to Android and Apple iOS.
Mobile device multiplatform support must be considered prior to purchasing and 
implementing a mobile device management solution. The type of business in which the 
solution will be deployed and whether employee owned devices are allowed are factors that 
must be considered in the selection.
The Mobile Application Store
The mobile application store, also known as an “app” store, is a digital distribution platform 
consisting of different websites that allow users to obtain applications (apps) for their mobile 
devices. These applications may be available at no charge or may be fee based. Application 
stores fall under two different categories: enterprise app stores and consumer app stores.
The Enterprise Mobile Application Store  The enterprise app store is a site that allows 
employees of an organization to visit for company-standard mobile applications. The enterprise 
application store helps an organization control and regulate the apps that are used within its 
environment. The development of an on-premise app store can be involved and expensive, and 
therefore organizations that may not have the resources or funds for an on-premise solution can 
create their own store by using an online provider. The Gartner Group has reported that by the 
year 2017, 25 percent of enterprises will have an enterprise app store.
The Consumer Mobile Application Store  The consumer mobile application store is 
intended for the common user to download or purchase commercial, off-the-shelf mobile 
applications. The following list shows some of the available categories within a consumer 
app store and is only a small sample of what is available:
 
■
Business
 
■
Education
 
■
Games
 
■
Health and fitness
 
■
Medical
 
■
Music
 
■
Productivity
 
■
Sports
 
■
Weather

Chapter 10 ■ Introduction to Mobile Device Management
Although there are stores available for a variety of device types, the most popular 
supported platforms with stores are the Android, BlackBerry, Apple iOS, and Windows 
Phone. The following list shows popular application stores. These stores may host apps for 
both the enterprise user and the consumer user.

The use of mobile apps continues to grow at a very fast pace. As people become more 
dependent on mobile device technology, the need and variety of apps is constantly expand-
ing. Technology research groups estimate that in 2013, well over 100 billion apps were 
downloaded, with revenues from these apps exceeding more than $25 billion.
As of the third quarter of 2013, the Android Google Play Store had officially 
reached over one million apps and had beaten the Apple App Store, which 
had 900,000 available applications.
An emulator can be a valuable tool for testing prior to deploying MDM policies, 
applications, or other content. Exercise 10.1 shows you how to install a free emulator that

Although using actual devices is a great technique for development and testing, 
emulators of any type can be a valuable tool for many aspects of technology. Computer-
based Android and other mobile device emulators aid in software development, debugging, 
pilot test beds, and troubleshooting.
Pushing Content to Mobile 
Devices
Pushing content to mobile devices is a common requirement in enterprise device deploy-
ments. MDM solutions allow for corporate and other applications to be pushed out to all 
specifi ed mobile devices that connect to the corporate network, regardless of whether the 
device is a company-owned asset or an employee-owned personal device. This lessens the 
burden of requiring employees to visit the enterprise application store and download a 
 specifi c app. In addition to apps, the following information can be pushed to mobile devices 
(among other types of information):
 
■
Operating systems and updates
 
■
Configuration information such as Wi-Fi profiles and settings
 
■
Security information and updates
 
■
Videos
 
■
Email configurations
Some mobile device operating systems include platform-dependent native push services 
such as the Apple Push Notifi cation Service (APNS), which is required for Apple device 
MDM enrollments. You learned about these in Chapter 2, “Common Network Protocols 
and Ports.” 
MDM Administrative Permissions
You will need to have the proper privileges to manage mobile devices from a corporate 
network, depending on the action to be performed. This is really no different than com-
mon day-to-day network administration tasks that are usually defi ned with the corporate 
network policy. 
Mobile devices used to access corporate network resources may not be a corporate-
owned assets and may be personal property of the employees. You may need special 

452 
Chapter 10 ■ Introduction to Mobile Device Management
privileges, or administrative permissions, to use MDM solutions to perform the 
following actions: 
 
■
Creating and maintaining mobile device policies
 
■
Grouping devices with the correct policy
 
■
Allowing for remote wipe, remote lock, remote unlock, and password control
The privileges will be defi ned as part of the network policy, and that task may be 
delegated to the organization responsible for computer network administration. Assigning 
administrative permissions can be accomplished in different ways, depending on the MDM 
solution you choose. In the case of bring your own device (BYOD) solutions, device owners 
will need to be familiar with the corporate policies regarding the use and administration of 
employee-owned devices. Understanding the End-User License Agreement (EULA) process 
and how it is accepted will need to be defi ned for several reasons, including for legal 
purposes. The EULA and additional pertinent information will be discussed in more detail 
in Chapter 11, “Mobile Device Policy, Profi les, and Confi guration.” 
Understanding MDM High Availability 
and Redundancy
One important component of MDM services is to ensure that access will always be readily 
available. Consistent or high availability for any type of networking service is commonly 
accomplished by redundancy of some type and is not a new concept. Computer networking 
services redundancy dates back to the early days of local area networking. At that time, it 
was important to ensure that various types of data were always readily available and not 
just accessible from a data backup solution. This was handled in a variety of ways, includ-
ing hard drive storage failure protection by disk mirroring or using RAID technology. 
RAID is an acronym that is spelled out a couple of different ways, including redundant 
array of inexpensive disks. In the event of a hard drive or disk storage failure, the fi le server 
would be able to continue to operate and provide access to any stored data. Without this 
type of fault tolerance, the hardware would need to be repaired or replaced and the data 
restored from a backup resulting in potentially signifi cant network downtime. 
File server redundancy, including grouping, or “clustering,” servers together for fault 
tolerance purposes is another method that would allow for high availability. The cost for 
this type of redundancy is higher because you would need to have completely redundant 
servers in the event of a catastrophic hardware failure. The benefi t of this type of solution is 
100 percent uptime for the network services; hence a higher cost. 
The requirement for information to be always available with no downtime is becoming 
more common and will be part of a company’s best practice policies. MDM solutions 
are no different than other networking services such as email and the reliable storage of 
information. Therefore, redundancy will need to be considered to ensure the availability 
of appropriate services. This is something that should be considered when evaluating an 

Location-Based Services 
453
MDM solution for your organization and is more of a concern with on-premise MDM 
solutions. With Software as a Service (SaaS), or cloud-based MDM solutions, the service 
provider will be responsible for the redundancy by providing redundant data centers, an 
uninterruptible power source (UPS), and redundant Internet connectivity in addition to 
other common redundancy best practices.
MDM Device Groups
Creating device groups within your mobile device management solution will help to 
streamline administration. Creating groups will allow the MDM administrator to iden-
tify profi les, applications, and other content that will need to be made available to the 
device user. This concept is similar to computer network administration. Organizing 
device groups will simplify management by providing common access to devices based on 
the requirements of the organization. Different options are available for an administra-
tor to create device groups, which will depend on the specifi c network operating system 
and the directory service in use. The following directory service implementations are 
common:
 
■
Microsoft Windows Active Directory
 
■
Red Hat Directory Server
 
■
Novell eDirectory
 
■
Apple’s Open Directory
These directory services can be queried using Lightweight Directory Access Protocol 
(LDAP) and will aid in the simplifi cation of the administration process. 
Group management with MDM is an important component of the entire practice of 
mobile device management. Improper group development and assignments will potentially 
lead to many technical support incidents and troubleshooting issues. You can also create 
pilot and test groups that can be used prior to a large-scale deployment for policies, 
mobile applications, and other confi guration information. Troubleshooting group-related 
issues will be discussed further in Chapter 19, “Mobile Device Problem Analysis and 
Troubleshooting.” 
Location-Based Services
Location-based services (LBS) is a technology that can be used many different ways. One 
use of LBS allows for various types of assets and devices and even people to be geographi-
cally located by different methods of radio frequency technology. These methods include 
radio frequency identifi cation (RFID), Global Positioning System (GPS), and Wireless LAN 
(Wi-Fi) technology. When it comes to mobility and mobile device technology, LBS is widely 
used with social media and mapping services to help identify the location of a mobile device 

454 
Chapter 10 ■ Introduction to Mobile Device Management
for various purposes, including personal, work, and entertainment. The following sections 
will provide a brief overview of LBS technology that is used with mobile device technology 
and a focus on geo-fencing and geo-location. LBS solutions can be software based, hard-
ware based, or a combination of both. 
Geo-fencing
A fence in any sense of the word is something that will provide an enclosure for the perim-
eter of an area. This enclosure is designed to keep items from leaving and entering an area 
and to know what is contained within an area. Geo-fencing from a mobile computing 
perspective is taking this concept to an entire new level. This virtual electronic boundary 
will allow network administrators to identify when specifi c mobile devices enter or leave an 
area. With the explosion of the number of mobile devices that are now used, keeping pri-
vate company information within the boundary of the organization is critical. This is just 
one example of how geo-fencing is used. Figure 10.1 shows how geo-fencing is a boundary 
surrounding a specifi c geographic area.
F I G U R E 10 .1  Geo-fencing example
Commonly used with Global Positioning System (GPS) or wireless LAN technology, 
 geo-fencing-enabled devices can be managed from within the MDM solution. Tasks 
include managing device features, device activation and deactivation, restricting access to 
 specifi c apps such as games and social media, and protecting private company information. 
Disabling the use of other device features such as built-in cameras can also be accomplished 
with MDM. 

Location-Based Services 
455
From the consumer side, geo-fencing is also popular with social media applications. 
These applications will allow a user to notify their friends or colleagues when they leave 
a specifi c location or when they arrive at a new location. The opportunities are endless 
as to how this can be used, including intentionally informing someone of a location, iOS 
reminders (which are intended to provide an alert when arriving at or leaving a specifi c 
location), and even shopping. 
Geo-location
Geo-location technology allows for many different device types to be geographically 
located. The following devices are among those that can use this technology: 
 
■
Smartphones
 
■
Tablets
 
■
Computers
With geo-location, different methods can be used to locate a device. One example 
is Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA), which is a multilateration technology technique. 
TDoA will measure the difference in distance between two stations from known locations. 
This provides an accurate method for locating a device of some sort. Another method of 
identifying the physical location is by using the device’s assigned IP address to provide 
specifi c information about the physical location of the connected device. Figure 10.2 shows 
how geo-location can pinpoint a device at a precise location.
F I G U R E 10 . 2  Geo-location can identify the physical location of a device

456 
Chapter 10 ■ Introduction to Mobile Device Management
The use of geo-location technology covers a wide range of applications. Although with 
consumer mobile devices, the user has the capability to disable geo-location technology, 
many opt not to do so. This is because they are either not aware that the technology exists 
and is enabled or they plan to use it for social media purposes. Geo-location technology 
can be used for marketing, social media, and enterprise device security.
Mobile Device Telecommunications 
Expense Management
Managing expenses for mobile device technology can be a daunting task. Many mobile 
device management solutions, either on-premise or cloud-based SaaS, offer telecommu-
nications expense management features. One common concern with mobile device tech-
nology is that users exceed the amount of data communications available to their device 
or their data plan. Unlimited data plans are becoming a thing of the past, and data use 
will need to be strictly managed. This is where telecommunications expense manage-
ment plays a role. Enabled devices allow MDM systems to handle data plan manage-
ment and other tasks including invoicing, identifying excessive roaming, and disabling 
data capability for lost or underutilized devices. While many carriers are doing away 
with unlimited data plans, some are increasing the data cap allowed for customers while 
keeping the price the same. Therefore, the battle to retain or get new customers con-
tinues to build amongst the wireless carriers. Some will even pay an early termination 
fee to try to get subscribers to change to their company. Carriers continue to build out 
their wireless network infrastructure, providing the ability to handle the increased data 
usage.
Captive and Self-Service Portals
In the following sections, I will compare two different available methods that mobile 
devices can use to access resources on a network, including wireless networks. These 
 methods are the captive portal and self-service portals.
The Captive Portal
A captive portal, sometimes called a walled garden, is a web page redirection that a 
 wireless device user is presented with after performing an IEEE 802.11 open system 
authentication and IEEE 802.11 association when connecting to a wireless (Wi-Fi) 
 network. Captive portals are not limited to Wi-Fi networks, but this is one network type 
where they are often used. In order for the user to access permitted resources or gain 

Captive and Self-Service Portals 
457
wireless network access, a web page will require them to authenticate in some way, which 
may include the following:
 
■
Entering user credentials (username and password)
 
■
Inputting payment information
 
■
Agreeing to terms and conditions
When one or more of these methods is used, the wireless device will be able to access 
the network and use whatever resources they have permissions to use. Most if not all public 
access wireless networks have some type of captive portal enabled. This includes networks 
at public venues such as hotels, coffeehouses, restaurants, and airports. This will help to 
protect both the provider (host) and the user of the wireless network. Private corporate 
networks also use captive portals when a user connects to the guest service set identifi er 
(SSID). Using captive portal authentication with enterprise guest networks will ensure 
that a user is connecting to an authorized company access point and not a potential rogue 
access point. Most enterprise-grade wireless access points, including cloud-based access 
points and wireless LAN controllers, have built-in captive portal capabilities that are fairly 
straightforward and easy to implement.
Keep in mind that a captive portal does not offer security of any data and only 
provides a way for network infrastructure devices to restrict device and user access 
to a network until some type of successful authentication has been provided. This 
“authentication” could be as simple as agreeing to a “Terms and Conditions” web page. 
After a user connects to a wireless network through a captive portal, additional security 
measures should be put in place. For public networks, this includes options such as 
virtual private network (VPN) connections or using a secure protocol like HTTPS, at 
a minimum. With a corporate network, additional authentication may include WPA2 
passphrase authentication or IEEE 802.1X/EAP user/certifi cate-based authentication. 
These and other security concepts will be discussed further in Chapter 16, “Device 
Authentication and Data Encryption.”
The Self-Service Portal
Mobile device management platforms often include self-service portal functionality to 
allow mobile device users to register their device and connect to a network. With the con-
cept of bring your own device (BYOD) continuing to grow and more personal devices being 
allowed to connect to a corporate network, a self-service portal will help by requiring less 
administration overhead and therefore providing a cost savings to the organization. The 
MDM platform that is used will determine which management features the user will have 
access to. 
A self-service portal is a method of onboarding a device and allowing it to comply with 
the appropriate company/device policy. The way these portals operate will vary based on 
how each MDM platform incorporates the technology. If a user already has a user logon 
account such as a Microsoft Windows Active Directory account, it may be as simple as 

458 
Chapter 10 ■ Introduction to Mobile Device Management
entering their credentials to start the onboarding process. If they are a guest or new user, 
they will need to have an account created. 
Here is one example of the self-service portal process.
1. 
Create an account for the device user. This is usually done from an administrative 
console page.
2. 
A username, first and last name, email address, and phone number is usually required.
3. 
An email will be sent to the user with information regarding the device registration.
4. 
The user will then access the self-service portal web page logon screen, which requires 
them to accept any terms and conditions or specific device policies.
5. 
The user will then select their device type (iOS, Android, or other).
6. 
Depending on the use of device, a guest network or company network will determine 
the capabilities and policies. 
7. 
A text message will be sent to the device with a password or PIN, which will then 
allow the user to access to the network.
The preceding steps represent a generic process, and it is important to understand that 
the steps and processes will vary depending on the MDM platform you are using. 
Users may also be able to use their company credentials to log on to a 
guest network portal. If the company has an agreement with the provider 
or wireless carrier, the credentials may be transferable. For example, when 
the user enters an area that charges for Wi-Fi service such as an airplane 
or a stadium with which their company has an agreement, instead of pay-
ing for access, the user can log in using their company credentials. Many 
users may not even be aware of agreements such as this that exist.
There are many benefi ts that are available to the user of the device that is now being 
managed (including but not limited to):
 
■
Locating a device
 
■
Locking a device
 
■
Requesting information from a device
 
■
Remotely wiping a device
One example where these features will prove helpful is that when a device is lost or 
stolen, they can help protect the integrity of the information contained within the device.
Summary
In this chapter you learned about how the infl ux of mobile device technology and the con-
cept of bring your own device (BYOD) create administrative challenges and how these chal-
lenges can be addressed by implementing a mobile device management (MDM) solution. 

Chapter Essentials 
459
We explored the basics of mobile device management solutions including both cloud-based 
(SaaS) and on-premise solutions. You saw that various platforms can be managed using 
an MDM solution, and the management options included access to applications (apps) via 
online stores. As with computer network administration, MDM solutions require special 
permissions to perform specifi c tasks on a mobile device. 
We also explored the pushing of content to mobile devices. Devices can be grouped 
based on management requirements. By grouping servers, you can provide a high 
availability solution to help ensure maximum uptime for the services provided. We looked 
at how location-based services, including geo-fencing and geo-location, allow a virtual 
electronic boundary to be built or a device’s location to be pinpointed within a specifi c 
area. Finally, we explored the concepts of both the captive portal and the self-service portal.
Chapter Essentials
Be familiar with different mobile device management (MDM) solutions.  Know the 
main differences between an on-premise and Software as a Service (SaaS) cloud-based 
mobile device management solutions. Understand the advantages and disadvantages of 
each type.
Understand the concept of pushing content.  Know that mobile applications and device 
confi guration information can be pushed to mobile devices. This will aid in management, 
troubleshooting, and changes to device confi guration.
Know that administrative permissions allow for mobile devices to be managed from a 
corporate network.  MDM solutions may need special privileges in order to perform the 
specifi c actions on the device.
Be familiar with mobile device grouping.  Device groups will help to streamline 
administration. They will help to identify profi les, applications, and other content that will 
need to be made available to the device user.
Understand the concept of location based services.  Know the difference between geo-
fencing and geo-location and how they are used with mobile device technology. These 
concepts allow a user to build a virtual electronic boundary and will allow networks to 
be able to identify when mobile devices enter or leave an area. They are also useful for 
gathering specifi c information about the location of connected devices.
Know the differences between a captive portal and self-service portal.   Understand 
that a captive portal is a way of restricting access to network resources unless proper 
authorization has occurred and that a self-service portal allows users to register their own 
personal devices. This will give them the capability to use the network resources they have 
been assigned.

✓Backup, Restore, and Recovery Policies
 
✓Operating System Modifications and Customization
 
✓Technology Profiles
 
✓Understanding Group Profiles
 
✓Policy and Profile Pilot Testing

With respect to computer networking, a policy is documenta-
tion that defi nes rules, restrictions, acceptable use, liability, 
and more. In this chapter we will look at some of the basic 
components of a network security policy. We will also explore some of the most common 
industry regulatory legislation and the importance of compliance. The technology user 
must have a clear understanding of the policy and how to adhere to it in order to effectively 
utilize the network and services it provides. The contents of a policy will vary based on the 
business model or the organization type. There is really no one-size-fi ts-all policy.
This chapter will provide a basic outline of some of the more common policy compo-
nents that are part of the framework for most organizations. If a policy is too strict, it may 
hamper the ability for a user to perform the needed tasks while using the network; there-
fore, the appropriate balance between security and usability is important. Policies exist 
for many areas of mobile technology including passwords/passcodes, remote access, data 
backup, restore, and more. You will see an overview of and the importance of a backup 
and restore policy. Knowing how the mobile device’s operating system can affect the adher-
ence to policy is another topic we will explore. Changes to the mobile  operating system 
may also be limited based on the network security policy. We will explore profi les, which 
allow a device to connect to a network and follow  specifi c  confi gurations, requirements, or 
settings for the connected session and how applying grouping concepts will help streamline 
mobile device administration. Finally, we will look at testing and pilot programs as they 
pertain to validating technology and changes within an existing network environment.
General Technology Network and 
Security Policy
The defi nition of the term policy will vary based on its specifi c use. For example, an auto-
mobile insurance policy is a contract between an insurance provider and an individual 
known as the policyholder. The insurance policy will identify details about specifi c agree-
ments concerning what the policy covers and the responsibility of the provider if a claim is 
fi led by the policy holder. With regards to technology, a security policy defi nes an agree-
ment between a corporation or the technology provider and the technology user. This 
agreement defi nes the specifi c use as well as the terms and conditions with which the user 
will comply while using the provider’s network and services. 

General Technology Network and Security Policy 
463
The specifi c use of the network or services will determine the type of policy and the 
specifi cs that are contained within. For example, companies that work within the  medical 
fi eld will need to understand compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA) in addition to the general policy framework. Another common 
example is that organizations that process, store, or transmit credit card information must 
comply with the Payment Card Industry (PCI) standards.
Industry Regulatory Compliance
It is very important for companies, organizations, and businesses that collect private or per-
sonal information from individuals to appropriately secure all of the information. In recent 
years, there have been several legislative regulations that businesses are required to conform 
to. This compliance, of course, will depend on the type of business or the business model. 
The legislative regulations determine how data containing personal information is handled 
for health care, retail, fi nancial, and other types of businesses. Plans for complying with 
them are known as legislative compliances. 
When using mobile devices of any type that access wireless network infrastructures, it 
is imperative for companies and organizations to verify any additional requirements from a 
security perspective that may be needed when dealing with regulatory compliance. 
Two popular legislative compliance requirements are PCI and HIPAA.
Payment Card Industry (PCI) Compliance
Payment Card Industry (PCI) regulations require companies to adhere to security standards 
created to protect card information pertaining to fi nancial transactions. According to the 
PCI Standards Council, in order to be PCI-compliant, a company must meet the following 
six requirements:
 
■
Build and maintain a secure network.
 
■
Protect cardholder data.
 
■
Maintain a vulnerability management program.
 
■
Implement strong access control measures.
 
■
Regularly monitor and test networks.
 
■
Maintain an information security policy.
Businesses that perform payment card fi nancial transactions must follow all regulations 
and maintain compliance in order to ensure the cardholder will be adequately protected.
For more information on PCI, visit the PCI Security Standards Council 
 website at www.pcisecuritystandards.org.

Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
(HIPAA) Compliance
HIPAA stands for the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. The 
goal of HIPAA is to provide standardized mechanisms for electronic data exchange, secu-
rity, and confi dentiality of all healthcare-related computer information and data. HIPAA 
consists of two parts:
 
■
HIPAA, Title I
 
■
HIPAA, Title II
If someone loses or changes their job, Title I of HIPAA protects their health insurance 
coverage. This will allow them to maintain coverage for a limited time.
In the information technology industries, Title II is what most people mean when they 
refer to HIPAA. It establishes mandatory regulations to govern how healthcare providers 
conduct business by securing computer data and ensuring that confi dential personal infor-
mation stays that way.
For more information on HIPAA, visit the U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services website at www.hhs.gov/ocr/hipaa.
PCI and HIPAA are just two examples of legislative compliances that orga-
nizations must follow. Depending on the type of business or field they are 
in, organizations might also need to comply with the following laws and 
regulations:
 
■
 Gramm-Leach Bliley Act (GLBA)—Banking/Financial Services
 
■
International Organization for Standardization (ISO)/International 
Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) ISO/IEC 27002—Information 
Security Standard
 
■
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)—Education
 
■
Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS)—U.S. Government
 
■
Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX)—Public Accounting
Security Policy Framework
Keep in mind that a network security policy’s contents will vary based on the specifi c type 
of business or application in which it is applied. For example, the policy for an organization 
that handles fi nancial information will be different from the policy for a manufacturing 
company. However, most policies are based on a general framework. Using this framework 
will enable you to build a policy that will meet the needs of the organization.
Typically, computer network security policy consists of two main parts, general policy 
and functional or technical components. The general policy components consist of the 
policy purpose and business justifi cation, management approval, policy defi nition and 

Information Technology and Security Policy Implementation and Adherence 
465
documentation processes, training policies, revision processes, violations and response, 
legal concerns, and potential threat assessment. The functional or technical side commonly 
consists of administrator and user training, monitoring, auditing, response and forensics, 
defi ning acceptable use, and security requirements including authentication, encryption, 
passcode and password policies. Keep in mind this is a general framework that can be used 
as a guide to assist in developing an actual security policy. 
The best way to learn the components and features of mobile device man-
agement (MDM) solutions including defining profiles to help enforce security 
policy is to actually evaluate one and use it. Chapter 10, “Introduction to 
Mobile Device Management” lists several manufacturers of MDM solutions. 
Most if not all of these companies provide evaluation or trial periods of their 
products. In this chapter we will be using examples from Windows Intune, a 
cloud-based management solution from Microsoft. You can register for a free 
trial to evaluate this product at www.microsoft.com/intune.
Information Technology and Security 
Policy Implementation and Adherence
Every company or organization that provides technology resources of any type should already 
have an information technology and security policy in place for their computer network. If 
this is not the case then it should be a very high priority to get one in place as quickly as pos-
sible. Given that various wireless technologies are becoming a major part of all networks, it is 
critical for wireless and mobility technology to be part of this security policy. 
If a security policy already exists, adding the wireless technologies that are used will be 
a fairly straightforward process. Getting the right people involved is essential for the imple-
mentation and success of a security policy. This includes the Information Technology group 
as well as the management team. 
A well-designed policy is critical in order for network security to be successful, bal-
anced, and maintained. Because wireless networks use the radio frequency (RF) spectrum 
for communications, the legal use of unlicensed and licensed RF bands will also need to be 
understood to ensure compliance with the local governing regulating bodies and the appro-
priate authorities. The wireless communications/network portion of the security policy 
should include, at a minimum, sections defi ning the purpose, scope, policy details, enforce-
ment information, and revisions/maintenance.
Purpose  This section will provide an overview of why the policy has been put in place and 
defi ne the importance of compliance to ensure that everyone understands that misuse could 
result in severe interference with the intended use of the network and may put the organiza-
tion and users at serious security risks.

466 
Chapter 11 ■ Mobile Device Policy, Profiles, and Configuration
Scope  The scope will provide an overview of who the policy will apply to, the use of the 
wireless spectrum, the acceptable use policy, and the importance of compliance.
Policy Details  This section should contain a basic overview of the wireless  technology 
that will be used, including the allowed RF spectrum and the wireless  technology and 
devices that can or cannot be used. This section should also identify some of the more 
technical aspects such as user authentication and data encryption, the  tolerance for specifi c 
types of network traffi c and RF interference, and acceptable applications.
Policy Enforcement  This section should defi ne any actions, including  potential litigation, 
that will be taken against those who are not in compliance.
Revisions/Maintenance  With the frequent changes in technology, a security policy can be 
somewhat of a moving target. Revisions and maintenance should be documented including 
a change record or revision history page. Figure 11.1 shows an example of a cloud-based 
mobile device management (MDM) program that can be used to create device profi les 
based on policy and provide policy enforcement.
F I G U R E 11.1  Windows Intune mobile device management (MDM) dashboard
Acceptable Use Policy
One of the most basic, common, and important policies for computer networking is an 
acceptable use policy. This is typically a policy that the user must comply with in order to 
access and use any computer network resources or services. At a minimum, the acceptable 
use policy will outline the rules regarding what a user can and cannot do. In most cases this 
is an abbreviated version of the complete policy that the user will be referred to and have 
access to if further detail or clarifi cation is needed. Most organizations require all users 
to sign and agree to this policy. This could be in the form of a physical document or in an 

Backup, Restore, and Recovery Policies 
467
electronic format. For the mobile wireless guest user, the acceptable use policy may come 
in the form of a web-based captive portal and usually includes restrictions and limitations. 
You learned about captive and self-service portals in Chapter 10.
Balancing Security and Usability
When it comes to policy, the ability to maintain a good balance between security and 
usability is a key factor. Some people believe that you can have too much of a good thing. 
If a policy is too tight, it may limit productivity or a user’s ability to utilize their devices 
correctly and to get their job done. On the other hand if it is too loose, it could potentially 
compromise the security and integrity of the corporate network. Therefore, providing an 
accurate balance between the two must be closely evaluated. A poorly balanced security 
policy is directly proportional to a policy failure. One example is a passcode or password 
policy. Most industry best practices agree that the longer and more complex a passcode is 
the more secure it will be. However, if it is too long or complex, a user may have diffi culty 
remembering it, or depending on the device, it may be a challenge to type it in. Another 
example is what exactly the user of the device is allowed to do. Can they install and remove 
apps, and can they modify the system’s or device’s settings? All options must be carefully 
considered in order to maintain a good balance. Much of this will also depend on the type 
of organization where the device is used. Finding the correct balance will be a challenge 
and is contingent on understanding what you are trying to protect and what you are trying 
to prevent.
Backup, Restore, and Recovery Policies
Regardless of whether a device is a company asset or is employee-owned, the importance 
of backup, restore, and recovery cannot be overestimated. A well written backup policy 
that can be easily understood and implemented will make what is usually considered an 
unpleasant or often ignored task much easier to comply with. Mobile devices that are used 
to store corporate data and intellectual property information such as trade secrets must 
correctly implement and adhere to the specifi ed policy. Automating this task as much 
as possible will lessen the reliance on the device’s user interaction and allow for a better 
chance of policy compliance. 
Many may think of device backup as only something that is used for recovering data 
that may be lost because of device failure or unintentionally deleted. With mobile devices 
you must also take into consideration that a device can be stolen or lost, which will then 
put all information that is stored on that device at risk if the device falls into the wrong 
hands. In such a situation, a network administrator can use an MDM solution to easily 
locate the device over the Internet using location services and remotely backup the data 
stored on the device to a corporate fi le server or cloud-based storage network. After a 
backup is complete, the device can be securely locked or even remotely wiped to provide 
additional security. 

468 
Chapter 11 ■ Mobile Device Policy, Profiles, and Configuration
Backup concepts and processes are discussed further in Chapter 18, “Data Backup, 
Restore and Disaster Recovery.” 
Operating System Modifications and 
Customization
Mobile device operating systems are designed to offer specifi c features and capabilities. 
This allows for consistent functionality and operation of the devices that run the operating 
systems. However, many hardware device manufacturers customize the device to operate 
with some of their specifi c features and to include their company branding. In addition, the 
owner of the device may be able to add their own customizations which may include:
 
■
Fonts
 
■
Home screens
 
■
Ring tones
 
■
Wallpaper
 
■
Widgets
The fact that some operating systems such as Android are open source provides many 
opportunities for the device manufacturer or the owner to add their own unique fl air.
Manufacturers of mobile device technology usually have certain features “locked 
down” which means they cannot be changed. However, some devices may be “rooted” or 
“jailbroken” to remove manufacturer’s restrictions. Android rooting and iOS jailbreaking 
can void the device manufacturer’s warranty and cause other issues. These are both 
discussed further in Chapter 15, “Mobile Device Security Threats and Risks.”
Operating System Vendors
In Chapter 10, we explored some of the popular mobile device operating systems. These 
include Android, BlackBerry, Apple iOS, and Windows phone. Chances are very high that 
organizations that allow employee-owned devices to access the company network will have 
a mix of these and other various devices with different operating system vendor platforms. 
The ability to integrate the various devices and operating systems into the environment 
may come with certain challenges that limit capabilities among the different vendors. These 
capabilities include the ability for remote management of the devices, general support for 
different operating systems features, and specifi c technology capabilities such as passwords 
and resets. 
Because of the diverse number of devices and available operating systems installed, the 
MDM administrator should be proactive with keeping up to date with any technology 

Operating System Modifications and Customization 
469
changes. Some of the methods an administrator can use to stay current with mobile tech-
nology changes include:
 
■
Social media
 
■
Subscribing to available services from the manufacturers
 
■
Rich Site Summary (RSS) services or feeds
 
■
Online webinars and available training sessions
The proactive approach will allow the administrator to prevent potential issues or 
 problems from occurring by becoming familiar with various limitations between the 
mobile device operating systems in use.
Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM)
The defi nition of original equipment manufacturer (OEM) may vary depending on the 
 context in which it is used. In the automobile industry the term “OEM part” is a replace-
ment part that is manufactured by the same company that made the original part. This 
gives the buyer confi dence that the part will be an exact replacement and will work 
as designed.
With regards to mobile technology, one defi nition is when a company purchases the 
rights to resell a product under its own brand name. One example is the ability for  different 
manufacturers to sell smart phones that run the Android operating system. Integrating 
directory services into an MDM solution may allow an administrator to utilize an existing 
directory database and help streamline user/device authentication and enrollments and can 
help to gather information from the managed device and the connected user.
Vendor Default Device Applications
Mobile device operating systems often have default applications that are installed by the 
manufacturer. These applications may include Internet browsers, email applications, 
video, audio/music, documents viewers, and others. The type of fi le that is accessed will 
determine which application is launched to manage or open that fi le. On devices with 
the Android operating system installed, you will be able to select which application you 
want to use to complete the task. If you would like to, you can use the selected program 
to “always” open future fi les that are of that same type or you can specify to open the fi le 
“just once.” If you choose the latter option, you will be presented with the option again 
when a fi le of the same type is opened. If you change your mind and later want to use a dif-
ferent application, this can easily be done by resetting the default application. In Exercise 
11.1 you will reset the default application for a device that is running the Android operat-
ing system.

Resetting the Default Application—Android
This is a short exercise to demonstrate one way to reset the default applications on a 
device using the Android operating system. Keep in mind these steps may vary based on 
the operating system and the version that is in use.
1. 
Select the Android settings icon.
2. 
Select applications.
3. 
Select the application that is currently set to open the ﬁ le type you would like to change.
4. 
Scroll down to launch by default and tap clear defaults.
5. 
You will be prompted to select an application type the next time that ﬁ le type is launched.
Technology Profiles
When working with various types of technology such as wireless networking, profi les are 
used to provide confi guration or settings information and to help with security policy com-
pliance. Saving this information within a profi le will help to lessen the overhead of enter-
ing specifi c information every time you wish to connect to a network or access a network 
resource. Profi les can be used in a variety of scenarios, for example with IEEE 802.11 wire-
less networking client devices or connecting to a virtual private network (VPN) from a cli-
ent to a VPN concentrator. Mobile device profi les using MDM will simplify and streamline 
access to an infrastructure and device management.
Mobile Device Profiles
A profi le is a set of parameters or instructions that will provide a device the ability to connect 
to a network and follow specifi c requirements or settings for the connected session. These 
profi les will defi ne specifi c settings and confi guration information in addition to restrictions 
based on the device itself and who is using the device. The profi les can be assigned for oper-
ating system, individuals, and groups. Profi les may contain confi guration information for:
 
■
Email access
 
■
Internet access
 
■
Network configuration information
 
■
Wi-Fi access
 
■
VPN configuration information
In addition to confi guration and settings, a profi le will help maintain security policy 
compliance. Figure 11.2 is an example of a cloud-based MDM  software application that 
can be used to set password policy enforcement.

Directory Services Integration
From a computer networking perspective, a directory service is similar to that of a database 
where information about specifi c objects can be created, stored, and retrieved. An analogy 
is a simple address book contained within a smart phone. In this address book you could 
enter specifi c information about contacts such as their name, various phone numbers, an 
email address, and much more. Searching a person by name will provide any additional 
information that is documented about that contact. 
Microsoft Windows Active Directory and Novell eDirectory are examples of computer 
network directory services. These are X.500-compliant directory services and are used to 
centrally manage users, groups, devices, and other resources. A network administrator can 
create user and group objects and allow them access to various network resources such as a 
shared folder on a fi le server or a network printer. Integrating directory services will allow 
a network administrator to assign mobile device applications, user and device profi les, 
and other data that can be associated with their directory services group membership. 
Depending on the MDM solution that is used, you can also synchronize any changes that 
are made to the directory database to the mobile device policy that it is connected to. This 
will include any changes that are made to the user, device, or group object that the device 
is associated with. Deleting a user object in the directory services database will allow the 
MDM software to take the appropriate designated action.
Issuing Digital Certificates
A digital certifi cate can be used as an access control method for various mobile devices, com-
puters, and other devices and will ensure that only valid authorized users will gain access to 
the corporate network infrastructure. Certifi cates are one method of access control used to 
confi rm that a person is who they say they are. This will help to restrict access to a system 
or resource only to those who are entitled to the access. Digital certifi cates can use a security 
concept known as a Private Key Infrastructure (PKI). Access control methods, certifi cates, 
and PKI are discussed further in Chapter 16, “Device Authentication and Data Encryption.” 

472 
Chapter 11 ■ Mobile Device Policy, Profiles, and Configuration
In a full PKI deployment, digital certifi cates are required on the RADIUS server and the cli-
ent device. Installing digital certifi cates can be streamlined using MDM software to issue the 
certifi cates automatically without relying on any input from the user of the device.
End-User License Agreement (EULA)
When a user installs proprietary software on a device, they must agree to and comply with 
the End-User License Agreement (EULA). This is basically an agreement between the creator 
of the software package and the organization or person that purchased the software. Most 
if not all software programs used within the mobility environment include a screen that pro-
vides specifi cs regarding the EULA and is usually shown at the beginning of the install pro-
cess. This will include some basic information that the user must agree to before continuing.
It is very important that the organization understands the EULA for legal and  liability 
management regarding mobile device technology and employee-owned devices. In most cases 
these are customized by the legal department to ensure the EULA complies with the company 
 objectives and covers the specifi c use of the software. Keep in mind that in many cases this is a 
scaled-down version of a more complete document that defi nes all the specifi cs in more detail.
Figure 11.3 shows an example of a cloud-based MDM administration console used to 
create a license agreement.
F I G U R E 11. 3  Windows Intune management console used to create a license agreement
Notice in Figure 11.3 that this program allows an administrator to enter the license 
name, software publisher, product title, license count, and start and end dates. When a user 
connects to the portal, they will be able to agree to and install the program. 

Understanding Group Profiles 
473
Understanding Group Profiles
For anyone who has performed basic computer network administration tasks, understand-
ing group profi les should be fairly straightforward. Managing a network and access to its 
resources is much easier and streamlined when using a grouping methodology. See the case 
study to examine one specifi c scenario. 
Assigning Access to Network Resources Using the Group Technique
You are a network administrator and have 3 departments in the company that will each 
require access to speciﬁ c resources that are located within the computer network. The 
departments are sales (10 members), engineering (3 members), and consultants (2 mem-
bers). The sales department will require access to a marketing database, the engineering 
department must be able to access product technical speciﬁ cations, and the consultants 
department will require access to speciﬁ c company brieﬁ ngs. There are two ways to 
approach this. One would be to explicitly assign permissions to the resources to the 
members of each department. The second way would be to create a group object for 
each department, add the members to each group, and assign the groups access to the 
resources. If a user will no longer require access to the network service or resource in 
which they have permissions via the group membership, the administrator can remove 
them from the group, thereby removing their access. Using groups helps to streamline 
the administration process of mobile devices by reducing repetitive administrator work in 
maintaining policy compliance and allowing access to network resources and services.

Chapter 11 ■ Mobile Device Policy, Profiles, and Configuration
The ﬁ rst option is an inefﬁ cient method of administration because any changes are made 
on an individual per-user basis and would require potentially extra administration and over-
head. The second option is more efﬁ cient because any changes are on a per-group basis.
The case study described here is very similar to the concept of creating profi les for 
devices within an MDM environment. The needs of the individual, whether the device 
is company-owned, and departments the user of the device belongs to will be factors in 
determining the capabilities of the device and the user. Some common profi les for specifi c 
devices and users with MDM techniques include:
 
■
Corporate-owned devices
 
■
Employee-owned devices (BYOD)
 
■
Outside consultants
Corporate-Owned Mobile Device Profiles
Issuing corporate-owned mobile devices to employees provides a network administrator 
with much-needed control over how the device is managed. Unlike with employee-owned, 
BYODs (discussed next), there is less concern about the type of applications or data that 
is used or stored on the device since the network administrator can have complete control 
over ensuring that applications and profi les that are installed on the device comply with 
corporate security policy. Something to consider is whether personal applications and data 
will be allowed on a corporate-owned device. The corporate security policy will need to 
defi ne exactly how this is handled.
Employee-Owned Mobile Device Profiles
Devices that are employee-owned will require special consideration as to what exactly 
a user can or cannot do with the device once it is connected to the corporate wireless 
 network. The continued growth of the bring your own device (BYOD) concept has raised 
concerns regarding security and network capacity. However, the benefi ts of BYOD must 
also be considered. A company, organization, or school can leverage employee-owned 
or personal devices to provide a cost savings by allowing these devices to be used on the 
 company network. 
In cases such as this, the correct provisioning and policy compliance will need to be 
closely evaluated. If employee-owned devices are allowed to be used on the corporate 
network, containerization of applications and data should be considered. This will allow 
corporate applications and data to be stored, maintained, and managed separate from 
the employee’s own personal data. In the event a device is lost, stolen or unaccounted 
for, the MDM software program can take the appropriate action that will mitigate any 
potential security concerns by performing a device lockdown or remote wipe of the 
corporate data that is installed on the device. The owner of the device that is used on 
the organization’s network must be made aware that with certain security threats the 
continued

Policy and Profile Pilot Testing 
475
appropriate action will be taken in order to secure the device and protect any confi den-
tial company data. 
MDM providers offer different mechanisms or processes using  containerization technol-
ogy. It is recommended as part of the software evaluation and trial period that you take a 
close look at how the manufacturer deals with this concept and try to determine whether 
their way would be a good fi t for your organization. 
The practice of companies allowing employee-owned devices on the corporate 
 network will continue to grow. The Gartner group estimates that by the year 2017 
more than 50 percent of companies will require that employees supply their own devices for 
use on the corporate network, helping to justify the use of  MDM solutions and technology.
Outside Consultants’ and Visitors’ Mobile Device 
Profiles
Depending on the business model or organization type, providing network access to out-
side consultants and visitors can be considered somewhat of a challenge. In many cases, 
connecting to the organization’s network, wired or wireless, is not allowed under any cir-
cumstances. In situations such as this, it is not uncommon for the organization to provide 
a third-party service such as a cable modem or digital subscriber line (DSL) connection 
from an Internet Service Provider (ISP) to allow outside Internet access for the guest user. 
A benefi t of this scenario is that the outside consultants will in no way be connected to the 
organization’s network infrastructure, which may be a requirement in the network secu-
rity policy. If this type of service is not provided or allowed, then the only option a con-
sultant will have is to use a cellular data connection such as 3G, 4G, or LTE to get outside 
access. 
For various reasons including security, many organizations allow physical wired access 
to a network only to its employees but will allow wireless network access via a connection 
to the guest wireless network. This guest network is typically on a completely separate vir-
tual local area network (VLAN) to ensure it meets the requirements of the network secu-
rity policy. In this situation it is important to defi ne how the outside devices will be able 
to connect and what exactly they will be able to do once they are connected. Defi ning the 
requirements such as content fi ltering, the amount of bandwidth, and time restrictions are 
some examples of the limitations guest networks may be subject to. Most if not all of these 
restrictions can be achieved through the use of an MDM profi le.
Policy and Profile Pilot Testing
Before any new technology, software, or changes are deployed, it is benefi cial to perform 
pilot testing within key areas of the organization in order to validate that the  technology 
will work as specifi ed and designed. This is a concept that is true with various types of 
technology, including, but not limited, to Voice over Wi-Fi (VoWi-Fi) handsets, client device 

476 
Chapter 11 ■ Mobile Device Policy, Profiles, and Configuration
deployments, fi rmware updates, software patches, fi xes and upgrades, and of course mobile 
device policy and profi les. Although some consider this an option rather than a require-
ment, this process must be carefully considered as it is best to fi nd any issues that may arise 
on a smaller scale rather than after a full deployment or upgrade. The pilot program pro-
cess will vary depending on how and where the technology is used, the scale of the deploy-
ment, the type of technology, and who is performing the testing. Some common steps that 
may be used as part of pilot program testing include:
 
■
Selecting the individuals or groups to be part of the test
 
■
Soliciting feedback and monitoring the testing phase
 
■
Making adjustments or changes as needed based on the results
 
■
Getting proper approval from change management
 
■
Implementing full deployment throughout the organization
It is also important to monitor the devices and users after the implementation has 
occurred and to solicit feedback in order to identify any issues that arise that were not 
 identifi ed during the pilot program testing phase.
Summary
In this chapter we explored the importance of understanding computer networking policies, 
especially security policy. We briefl y looked at a few industry regulations including HIPAA 
for organizations that work with healthcare and PCI for those who deal with fi nancial credit 
card transactions. You saw that how policies are defi ned will depend on the organization in 
which they are used. You learned about the basic components of a network security policy, 
which include the purpose, scope, details, enforcement, and maintaining changes. I explained 
the importance of an acceptable use policy and that most if not all organizations require 
employees and guests to agree to the terms and conditions of this type of policy. You saw the 
importance of balancing security and usability and looked at some common networking poli-
cies such as device backup, restore, and recovery. In addition to policies, you learned about 
device technology profi les, which contain confi guration or settings information for the device 
based on the user and that can also incorporate specifi c profi les. Finally, you saw the impor-
tance of testing technology, mobile device profi les, and policies by using pilot programs and 
validating any potential implementation issues prior to a full scale deployment.
Chapter Essentials
Understand basic technology policy.  Know that a technology security policy defi nes an 
agreement between a corporation or technology provider and the technology user with 
instructions and rules that must be complied with.

Chapter Essentials 
477
Be familiar with policy regulatory compliance.  Understand that policy compliance is an 
important topic, regardless of whether it is for specifi c industries such as medical, fi nan-
cial, or education, or even for specifi c requirements within an organization such as mobile 
device data backup and restore. 
Know the common components of a basic Information Technology policy.  Although 
 policies will vary based on the type of organization, understand the basic components that 
will be part of the policy. These include the purpose, a scope, the policy details, policy 
enforcement, and revision/maintenance.
Understand the basic acceptable use policy.  The acceptable use policy is typically a 
requirement within most businesses or organizations. Users will agree to this policy in 
 writing or electronically before any access is granted. One common practice is to require 
wireless guest users to agree via a web-based captive portal.
Define a balance between security and usability.  Understand that a security policy that is 
too strict may limit the ability for a user to utilize their devices correctly and to be able to 
get their job done, and a policy that it too liberal may potentially compromise the security 
and integrity of the corporate network. 
Understand common security policies.  Policies such as data backup, restore, and recovery 
procedures should be seriously considered, implemented, and enforced. This will ensure the 
security and availability of corporate data.
Understand the concept of using profiles.  Know that device and user profi les can be used 
to provide a user with the ability to connect to a network and follow specifi c requirements 
or settings for the connected session. Also understand this will allow compliance with 
 specifi c defi ned company policies.
Be familiar with the grouping concept.  Understand that managing a network and access 
to resources is much easier and streamlined when using a grouping methodology. Groups 
can be created based on the company’s organization chart and will ease mobile device 
administration. Providing access to or removing access from various resources and services 
is easily accomplished using the group methodology.
Understand the concept of pilot testing.   Understand that testing new technology and 
profi les within key groups of the organization will help lessen full deployment issues. 
This allows the administrator to become familiar with any problems that may arise from 
using the new technology or how profi les and policies are implemented. This process 
 usually includes selecting which groups will be tested, soliciting feedback from the users, 
making any needed changes, getting proper approvals, and fi nally implementing changes 
throughout the organization.

Implementing any type of new technology comes with its 
own unique set of challenges. Both wireless LAN technology 
and cellular technology have grown at a tremendous pace 
over the last decade. Mobile device technology allows a user to access information in ways 
that seemed impossible not too long ago. In this chapter, we will explore some of the 
foundational components of this technology, including the processes and methodologies 
known as the System Development Life Cycle. The implementation process includes pilot 
testing to ensure the technology meets the company requirements, getting approval or 
management buy-in, training for all staff and employees, and device activation. 
It is important to be familiar with and understand the different devices that are used 
with over-the-air technology, including both infrastructure and wireless client devices for 
wireless LAN and cellular data. We will explore some of the different options that are 
available. I will explain the method used for bringing these client devices onto a network 
for the fi rst time, a process known as onboarding, and taking devices offl ine or off the 
company network, a process known as offboarding. There are several ways that devices 
can be brought on to a network, both manual and automatically. The objective is to make 
this process as transparent to the end user as possible. With offboarding, it is important to 
make sure procedures are followed to secure company data when an employee leaves the 
organization. 
Finally, I will explain the importance of preparing mobile technology devices for 
recycling or disposal after they have been decommissioned. Deleting data from a device 
may not really prevent it from being seen or accessed again, and certain technology factors 
must be considered.
System Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
The defi nition of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) will vary based on the context in 
which it is used. With regard to information technology (IT), the SDLC consists of several 
different phases and processes. One example used with IT allows for network designers 
and engineers to plan, design, test, build, and deploy the information system technology. 
Another term used to describe this methodology is application development life cycle. The 
SDLC concept in this context will help ensure the success of an infrastructure and mobile 
device deployment. The following list describes some of these common components that are 
included in the SDLC. Keep in mind that this information may vary based on how a system 
is implemented.

System Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

Plan the system.  The planning component is required to ensure that all parts of the 
organization are involved and adequately covered. This includes identifying concerns and 
addressing specifi c needs of various departments contained within the organization. The 
expectations should also be addressed to verify that all of the parties are on the same page, 
so to speak. Understanding the business requirements of the organization will help to 
provide a satisfactory solution.
Design the system.  Design is based on the information that is gathered from the planning 
phase to ensure that all of the intended technology requirements are met. This phase will 
ensure that organization-, company-, and department-specifi c conditions are met.
Test the system.  This phase is to verify that everything will work as planned and 
designed. The testing phase may include a pilot program, as explained later in this chapter. 
Adequate testing of a system will help provide positive results once the system is built and 
deployed. Including key departments and individuals will help ensure the system’s success.
Build the system.  With respect to information technology, the build phase will include 
procurement of all components per design and bill of materials. This is based on the results 
of the pilot testing. Once the design or proof of concept is complete, preparation for full 
deployment will begin.
Deploy the system.  The next step is to deploy the system per the design, and make any 
changes due to feedback from the testing phase. In some SDLCs, the build and deployment 
phases are combined, while in others they are separated as two distinct components.
Maintain the system.  Maintaining the system to provide acceptable performance, and to 
make certain the system will operate as planned and designed, is the last step. There are 
many solutions that can be put in place to help streamline the maintenance and support 
of information systems. This includes help desk software solutions, documentation, and 
system modifi cations based on environmental (physical) changes to the organization. 
Figure 12.1 illustrates the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) process as described 
in this book.
The abbreviation SDLC is used for various terms. In the context of this 
chapter, it refers to System Development Life Cycle. In the technology 
world, it also means Synchronous Data Link Control, which is a protocol 
that was developed by IBM in the early 1970s.

Chapter 12 ■ Implementation of Mobile Device Technology
Pilot Program Initiation, Testing, 
Evaluation, and Approval
In Chapter 11, “Mobile Device Policy, Profi les, and Confi guration,” I explained that 
pilot testing of mobile device policies and profi les can be a benefi cial way to ensure that 
a profi le will work as designed, and meet the required goals. Pilot programs can also be 
used to ensure that the complete technology solution hardware and software can operate 
as designed or intended. This includes testing installed applications, verifying coverage and 
capacity requirements, and testing overall performance of the network. I will now expand 
on this concept and explain its steps in more detail.
Select the individuals or groups to be part of the test.  Spend some time researching 
individuals or groups to be part of the pilot program to choose those best suited. It may 
be best to use people from different departments, because the types of applications and 
work habits will differ based on what their job responsibilities are. This could range from 
light users who only use their device for email and other simple tasks, to heavy users who 
multitask with several bandwidth-intensive applications that can stress the system. You 
should specify a timeline and provide documentation of the expectations to the people who 
are involved in the pilot testing process. 
Solicit feedback and monitor the testing phase.  It is important to have a plan in place 
that will allow you to receive feedback from users who are part of the pilot testing. This 
could be as simple as an anonymous feedback form on an intranet web page, telephone 
calls, or even personal visits if feasible. Make the users feel comfortable in knowing that 
their feedback is important and that the information they provide will help to make a 
deployment a better user experience for everyone in the organization.
Make adjustments or changes as needed based on the results.  It would be very nice if 
everything always worked as planned or designed. Unfortunately, this is usually not the 
case. This is where feedback from the pilot program will help. You can make adjustments 
or changes to address feedback you have received from users participating in the program. 
A network that functions well and addresses the needs of the user population will ensure 
user satisfaction, and help to improve the job performance of the user base. This will in 
turn make things easier for the network administrator and other support personnel. 
Get proper approvals from change management.  Getting the proper approvals from the 
change management group will ensure that your research and pilot testing has met the 
desired goals, and the deployment can move forward as planned. 
Implement full deployment throughout the organization.  This fi nal step will allow the 
technology to be put in place as intended and designed, and will provide a great user 
experience for the entire user base. This is where the hard work of testing, collecting 
feedback, and evaluation pays off.

Training and Technology Launch 
483
Training and Technology Launch
Training is an important component of all types of technology deployment. The training 
process for both the technical staff and the end user base must be taken into consideration. 
Network administrators will need to learn about the new mobile devices and associated 
hardware. This includes installation, confi guration, setup, and ongoing support. The end 
user will need to understand the technology and learn how to use the devices. This is 
especially true when it comes to understanding the security solutions that have been put in 
place, and adhering to corporate security policy.
Training for Network Administrators
This type of training will include both vendor-neutral training to learn about the 
technology in general, and manufacturer-specifi c training to learn about the products. 
Many options are available, including online videos, online instructor-led training, and 
in-person instructor-led training. The online videos and online instructor-led training 
solutions may be available for free, or they could be fee based. In most cases, in-person 
instructor-led training is fee based. Hardware and software manufacturers often have their 
own training programs that can be alternatives to vendor-neutral training solutions. These 
are benefi cial because they provide content specifi c to their products. Most manufacturers 
are appreciative if the individuals who attend the training sessions already have a basic 
understanding of the general technology. This enables the instructors to skip the basics and 
instead focus on the functions, features, and bells and whistles of their specifi c solutions.
Training for End Users
It is important not to forget about the end user of the deployed technology solution. They 
need to be adequately trained, and understand the technology that has been implemented. 
Assuming that the end user will be fi ne without proper training is a mistake that can lead 
to problems down the road. In addition, no matter how much money you spend on the 
technology, how fancy the technology is, and how proud you are of the implementation, if 
it does not improve the employee’s productivity, it is a waste of money and could result in 
overall system failure. Provide adequate training to end users to ensure proper operation of 
the equipment and that the security requirements are met and maintained.
Technology Launch
After all the requirements are met, including those described in the SDLC and during 
design, and after pilot testing, adjustments, management buy-in, and training, it is time to 
deploy the technology solution. It is important to closely monitor the performance after 
the deployment has occurred. This will allow you to identify any problems or issues that 
may not have been identifi ed during the pilot testing phase. A baseline analysis of the 

484 
Chapter 12 ■ Implementation of Mobile Device Technology
performance will provide statistics and metrics that can help you ensure the overall health 
of the system.
Documentation Creation and Updates
Quality documentation within the information technology arena will usually lead to a 
successful deployment. The task of documentation is often neglected or even forgotten, but 
its importance cannot be underestimated. From the initial gathering of information and 
business justifi cation phases to the fi nal deployment and buy-in phases, a well-documented 
process will help to provide technology that will work as designed and can be supported 
and maintained. Documentation is not just a one-time task. It is an ongoing process that 
must be maintained and updated. This is true with all areas of information technology. 
Quality documentation will help to ensure that a long-term deployment can successfully 
operate and be supported as intended.
Mobile Device Configuration and 
Activation
Many wireless mobile devices are multifunctional and can be used with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, 
WIMAX, and cellular networks. For a device to be used on any of these networks, a 
confi guration or activation of some sort is required. For Wi-Fi devices, confi guration 
will consist of connecting to the appropriate wireless access point and providing the 
correct credentials if required. Once this is completed, the device will have access to 
any of the network resources to which the user of the device has been granted access. 
Bluetooth technology is commonly used to connect devices such as smartphones, 
tablets, and computers together and to connect other devices, such as headsets, cameras, 
keyboards, and computer mice, within a personal area network (PAN). These devices use 
what is known as the discovery phase to scan the air and fi nd other Bluetooth-capable 
devices. Once other Bluetooth devices are found, the user can enter the correct personal 
identifi cation number to allow the devices to be “paired.” This pairing of devices will 
create a piconet, which is an ad hoc network for Bluetooth devices that are part of the same 
PAN. Both the Wi-Fi network and the PAN allow users to connect by having the correct 
credentials, and activation is not generally required. Figure 12.2 shows an example of a 
piconet created from connecting devices in an ad hoc Bluetooth network.
On the other hand, devices that contain cellular capabilities require some type of 
activation process to be used on the wireless carrier network. This activation will require 
the user to subscribe to a service that allows the device to function on the cellular network. 
Unlike Wi-Fi and Bluetooth networks, these services are fee based and are available with a

yearly contract agreement or monthly billing. The activation process on a cellular network 
is fairly straightforward. Calling a specifi c telephone number or using an activation web 
page are both common methods used today. Figure 12.3 shows an example of a website 
used to activate cellular phones and other devices.

Chapter 12 ■ Implementation of Mobile Device Technology
Wireless LAN, Cellular Data, and Secure 
Digital Adapters
A combination of network infrastructure and client-side devices are used for over-the-air 
communication. In Chapter 6, “Computer Network Infrastructure Devices,” we explored 
some of the common infrastructure devices that are used to allow wireless devices to access 
a network using radio frequency for communications. These devices include wireless access 
points, wireless bridges, and wireless LAN controllers, which are all used to allow wireless 
LAN–capable client and mobile devices to connect to an infrastructure and access the 
available network resources. We will now explore some of the common client devices that 
are used for over-the-air connectivity.
When we hear the term client devices, we often think of computers—either desktop or 
notebook—connected to a computer network. However, there are many other devices, both 
wired and wireless, that can connect to a network. Wireless LAN client devices include 
various types of computers, tablets, smartphones, scanners, print servers, cameras, and 
other devices that are used to send data across the network.
Devices that connect to wireless networks use various types of adapters. Which adapter 
is used depends on the client device that it connects to. You can connect wireless adapters 
to such devices as a notebook computer, tablet, desktop computer, or bar-code scanner. 
Wireless LAN adapters are available in various types, both external and internal to the 
device. External adapters will connect to an available interface in the device, such as a 
USB port or card slot. Some devices use internal adapters that may require some level of 
disassembly or removal of a cover panel prior to installation. Examples of internal adapter 
types are PCI, Mini PCI, Full Mini PCIe, and Half Mini -PCIe.
Wireless LAN client adapters differ from other network adapters (such as Ethernet 
adapters) because they contain radio hardware and use radio frequency (RF) to send the 
computer data over the air. A wireless LAN design should be partly based on the needs of 
the client applications, client device types to be supported, and the environment where they 
will be used.
Cellular data adapters are used to connect certain device types to a wireless cellular 
carrier service. These devices include laptop computers, branch offi ce wireless LAN routers, 
and others. Cellular data adapters are available in various form factors, and commonly use 
a direct Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection. They may also be built in to devices such 
as a laptop computer via a Mini PCIe adapter. Some external adapters are available that 
require a cable to connect to the device.
Secure Digital (SD) adapters were originally designed as memory storage cards, but some 
cards had wireless LAN technology added to them. Although these are not as common, 
they are available from several manufacturers. Many mobile devices can read SD cards 
directly using a port on the device or via an adapter of some sort. Both cellular data 
adapters and SD adapters are discussed in more detail later in this chapter.

Wireless LAN, Cellular Data, and Secure Digital Adapters 
487
USB Wireless LAN Adapters
Introduced in 1995, the Universal Serial Bus (USB 1.0) standard was designed as a 
replacement for legacy serial and parallel connections. Serial communication is the process 
of transmitting one data bit at a time. Parallel communication has the capability of 
transmitting several data bits at a time. Imagine a single-lane road compared to a four-lane 
highway. On a single-lane road, only one car at a time can travel, whereas on a four-lane 
highway, many cars can traverse the same path at the same time.
USB allows connectivity for keyboards, digital cameras, printers, computer networking 
adapters, and other devices that once used serial and parallel data connection ports. USB 
standards are implemented by the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF). This organization 
consists of companies from the computer and electronics industries, including Intel, Microsoft, 
NEC, and HP. Over time, they have evolved the USB specifi cation through several iterations.
USB 1.0 specifi ed data rates from 1.5 to 12 Mbps and was replaced by USB 1.1 in 1998. 
Devices using version 1.1 of the standard were common in the market.
The USB 2.0 specifi cation was released in April 2000. The fi rst revision appeared in 
December 2000, and the standard has been revised several times since. USB 2.0 incorporates 
several changes, including connector types. Data rates now allow for a maximum speed of 
up to 480 Mbps.  Keep in mind that the signaling rate is actually 480 Mbps. However, the 
effective throughput may only be as high as 280 Mbps, and is sometimes much less due to 
the bus access constraints of the devices. Figure 12.4 shows an example of a USB 2.0 port.
USB 3.0 technology was introduced in early 2010 and is commonly available to the point 
of being included on newer system boards. USB 3.0 devices have faster transfer rates and 
use a wider bandwidth, and they allow multiple logical streams and improved bus use with 
asynchronous readiness notifi cation without polling. USB 3.0 greatly increases the transmission 
speed from the 480 Mbps of USB 2.0, up to 4.8 Gbps. This is more than 10 times that of the 
earlier standard, and as a result USB 3.0 is known as SuperSpeed. In addition to speed, the 
new USB 3.0 specifi cation addresses improvements to the technology, including bandwidth, 
by using bidirectional data paths, power management, and improved bus utilization. USB 3.0 
device ports are typically blue in color and are backward compatible to USB 1 and 2 ports.
USB 3.1 will have rated speeds (signaling rate) of up to 10 Gbps. At the 
time of this writing, no devices have been released that support USB 3.1 
technology.

Chapter 12 ■ Implementation of Mobile Device Technology
Features of USB
USB uses a standard connector that replaces 9-pin serial, 25-pin parallel, and various 
other connector types. External confi guration allows the user to plug in the USB device 
and power it with a single USB port. The computer operating system will guide the user 
through the device driver installation process. External installation minimizes the need 
to open up a computer case and make adjustments within the computer, such as switch 
or jumper settings. USB also supports hot-swapping of devices, allowing connection 
and disconnection without the need to power down the device or the computer. In some 
cases, USB allows for power to be delivered to the peripheral device, eliminating the need 
for an external power supply. Fewer and fewer devices are being built with PC Card or 
ExpressCard interfaces, and most use only USB ports for adding peripheral devices.
For additional information and specifications regarding the USB standards, 
visit the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF) at www.usb.org.

Mini PCI Wireless LAN Adapters
Mini PCI is a variation of the PCI standard, designed for laptops and other small-footprint 
computer systems. One common example of a Mini PCI card is the IEEE 802.11 Mini PCI 
adapter shown in Figure 12.5.
F I G U R E 12 . 5  IEEE 802.11 Mini PCI adapter
Mini PCI cards are common in many devices, such as Fast Ethernet networks, Bluetooth, 
modems, hard drive controllers, and wireless LANs. In the wireless world, Mini PCI cards 
are used in access points and client devices such as laptop or notebook computers.
Mini PCI Express (Mini PCIe) cards are a replacement for the Mini PCI cards and are 
based on PCI Express.
Many notebook and portable computers with built-in wireless LANs use 
Mini PCI, Mini PCIe, or now Half Mini PCIe cards for wireless IEEE 802.11 
wireless LAN connectivity.
Features of Mini PCI, Mini PCIe, and Half Mini PCIe Cards
Mini PCI cards are available in three types: Type I, Type II, and Type III. Types I and II use 
a 100-pin stacking connector. Type III cards use a 124-pin edge connector. Type II cards 
have RJ11 and RJ45 connectors for telephone and Ethernet network connections. These 
cards are commonly located at the edge of the computer or docking station so that the 
connectors can be mounted for external access, such as to a modem or computer network.
Mini PCIe cards are 30 × 56 mm and have a 52-pin edge connector, consisting of two 
staggered rows on a 0.8 mm pitch. These cards are 1.0 mm thick, excluding components. 
Table 12.1 summarizes the features of Mini PCI and Mini PCIe cards.
The Half Mini PCIe cards are 30 × 31.90 mm. The main difference between this card 
and the Mini PCIe card mentioned earlier is the length. The length of this new form factor 
is about half the length of the Mini PCIe card.

Installation and Configuration of Mini PCI, Full Mini PCIe, and Half 
Mini PCIe Cards
As with the PCI card installation process, Mini PCI and Mini PCIe installation may require 
the user to physically install hardware in the computer. Location of the Mini PCI or Mini PCIe 
interface varies depending on the computer manufacturer. For example, you just have to remove 
a cover panel on the bottom of some notebook computers. And on some computers, you need 
to disassemble the computer case. Exercise 12.2 describes the typical installation steps.
Even if your computer is unplugged and the battery is removed, many 
components can still retain a dangerous electrical charge. Also, static 
 electricity from carpet or other materials can potentially damage the 
computer. Always be sure to read the instructions carefully, follow proper 
safety procedures, and avoid standing on carpet when taking the panel off 
your computer and working inside its box, even for simple procedures.
E X E R C I S E  1 2 . 2
Installing Mini PCI and Mini PCIe Cards
The following steps are typical for installation of a Mini PCI and Mini PCIe wireless LAN 
card on a notebook computer. Exact installation steps are speciﬁ c to the manufacturer, 
and I recommend that you follow the manufacturer’s setup instructions.
1. 
Shut down the computer. Verify that the computer is not in Hibernation mode. If it is, 
turn on the computer and perform a complete shutdown.
2. 
Disconnect the AC power cord from the wall jack.
3. 
Disconnect all connected peripherals and remove the battery pack.
4. 
Remove the panel covering the Mini PCI or Mini PCIe compartment (details of this 
step will depend on the computer model). 
5. 
Insert the Mini PCI or Mini PCIe card into the correct slot. Note the correct pin  orientation.
6. 
Connect the wireless antenna cables to the Mini-PCI or Mini PCIe card.
7. 
Replace the panel for the Mini PCI or Mini PCIe compartment.
8. 
Replace all peripheral devices and the battery pack. Plug the AC power cord into the 
wall jack.
9. 
Power on the computer and insert the setup CD-ROM into the CD-ROM drive. The 
program should start automatically, and a welcome or Autorun screen may appear. 
When the screen appears, click Install Drivers and follow the onscreen instructions to 
install and conﬁ gure the wireless MiniPCI or Mini PCIe card.
Always read the manufacturer’s manual regarding installation and safety before attempt-
ing installation.

493
Upgrading an IEEE 802.11g wireless Full Mini PCIe card to a newer IEEE 
802.11n or 802.11ac Half Mini PCIe card may require the use of a special 
adapter or bracket. Keep in mind that the Half Mini PCIe card is about 
half the length of the full card, and you may not be able to install the 
card securely. Therefore, you may need to purchase a special bracket to 
securely mount the new Half Mini PCIe card.
Cellular Data Adapters
One way to provide broadband Internet access to a mobile device without cellular 
capabilities, such as a notebook computer, is to add a cellular data adapter. The most 
common type of adapter uses Universal Serial Bus (USB) technology. Just like a cellular 
phone, a cellular USB data adapter requires fee-based, month-to-month or long-
term service. One advantage to using this type of adapter is the ability to get Internet 
connectivity using 3G/4G LTE anywhere a cellular signal is available. Conversely, in order 
to get connectivity using wireless LAN technology, a signal from a wireless access point 
must be available. A few other options for cellular data access include wireless broadband 
hotspot devices and smart phone tethering.
Wireless Broadband Hotspot Device  These devices are becoming very popular because 
of their convenience factor. A wireless hotspot device operates in the same manner as a 
wireless access point, but instead of being connected to a wired infrastructure, it uses a 
3G/4G LTE cellular connection for Internet access. One benefi t is that this device will allow 
Internet access anywhere a cellular signal is available. The user will confi gure the device 
to provide a secure service set identifi er (SSID), which will allow anyone with the correct 
credentials to connect using any Wi-Fi–capable device. These broadband hotspot devices 
will require activation and a fee-based monthly subscription, or a contract with a wireless 
carrier to provide a data plan.
Smartphone Tethering  For an additional fee, some cellular wireless carriers will allow 
you to tether a smartphone using a USB cable or Bluetooth technology to devices that do 
not have wireless broadband capabilities. For people who have an unlimited data plan with 
their wireless carrier, this is a nice option. It is important to understand that when you use 
this method, you will be charged depending on the amount of data your plan allows or 
the amount you use. If you frequently use the tethered device for cellular data, it can get 
expensive. One disadvantage to this option is that it allows only one device to connect to 
the Internet at any one time.
Most broadband wireless hotspot devices allow only a limited number of 
devices (typically five) to connect to the Wi-Fi connection available from 
the hotspot device. This will help with the overall performance and provide 
a better experience for the user who is connected to the Wi-Fi link. Using 
this type of device for a large number of users with bandwidth-intensive 
applications is not usually recommended.

Chapter 12 ■ Implementation of Mobile Device Technology
Secure Digital (SD) Adapters
Secure Digital (SD) was designed as a fl ash memory storage device, and now is available 
with storage capacities from 8 MB to 32 GB. The SD memory card was a joint venture 
among SanDisk, Toshiba, and Panasonic in 1999. SD adapters are available in different 
form factors, including what is known as MicroSD.
Even though the SD card was designed to provide fl ash memory, the slot will allow for 
connection of other devices such as cameras, Global Positioning System (GPS) units, FM 
radios, TV tuners, Ethernet networks, and of course wireless LANs. In this format the SD 
card is known as Secure Digital Input Output (SDIO). This card is designed to provide 
high-speed data I/O with low power consumption for mobile electronic devices. 
Features of SDIO Cards
SDIO cards are commonly available in three sizes:
 
■
The full-size SDIO card is 24 × 32 × 2.1 mm—approximately the size of a postage 
stamp. This SDIO card is intended for portable and stationary applications.
 
■
The mini SDIO is 27 × 20 × 1.4 mm in size and is used with wireless LAN and Blue-
tooth adapters.
 
■
The micro SD is 15 × 11 × 1.0 mm and is used in smartphones, tablets, and mobile devices.
For additional information regarding SD and SDIO technology, visit the SD 
Association at www.sdcard.org.
Installation and Configuration of SDIO Cards
Physically installing an SDIO 802.11 wireless LAN card is similar to installing other 
adapters used in laptop computers and mobile devices. However, there are some differences. 
The differences may include connecting a mobile device to another host PC running 
ActiveSync in order to complete the installation process. I recommend that you follow the 
manufacturer’s setup instructions for installing a specifi c card. Here are the typical steps 
for installing an SDIO wireless LAN card:
1. 
Connect the mobile device to the host PC running ActiveSync.
2. 
Install the software using the host PC.
3. 
Insert the SDIO wireless LAN card.
4. 
Start the program on the mobile device.
5. 
Find a wireless LAN to connect to, and create a profile.
6. 
Connect to the wireless LAN.
Always read the manufacturer’s manual regarding installation and safety 
before attempting installation.

Mobile Device Management Onboarding and Provisioning

Mobile Device Management Onboarding 
and Provisioning
Mobile device onboarding is the process of connecting a device to a wireless network 
for the fi rst time, and allowing a user to register it to gain access to company and other 
network resources. This may also include providing guest access to users such as visitors 
and contractors, so they can access specifi c company resources or the public Internet. The 
objective here is to make this process simple and transparent to the end user of the device, 
regardless of whether the device is company owned or employee owned (bring your own 
device). This process should require minimal, if any assistance, from the company’s technical 
support department. The onboarding process will ensure that the device is in compliance 
with corporate security policy and will provide access to only the network resources that the 
user of the device has permission to access. Onboarding can be accomplished in several ways:
 
■
Manual methods
 
■
Self-service methods
 
■
Certificate enrollment methods
 
■
Role-based enrollment methods
 
■
Other enrollment and identification methods
The method used will depend on several factors, including the size of the organization, 
number of devices, technical support constraints, whether the device is employee owned or 
company owned, and more. Figure 12.7 shows the basic fl ow for mobile device onboarding.

Chapter 12 ■ Implementation of Mobile Device Technology
Manual Method
Depending on the device and its intended use, onboarding using a manual method can be 
a cumbersome and ineffi cient process for providing access to a network. However, this 
really depends on whether you are connecting a company-owned notebook computer to 
wireless LAN or a mobile device such as an Android tablet or an iPhone. Connecting a 
company-owned computer to a wireless network could be as simple as providing the service 
set identifi er (SSID) and the proper credentials to the user. In this situation, chances are the 
user has been supplied with a computer that has the necessary software installed with the 
needed applications to effectively perform their tasks. In many cases, the organization’s 
information technology (IT) team will use special utility software to create an exact replica 
of a computer hard disk that can be stored on a fi le server and reproduced onto many other 
computers. On the other hand, for more mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, 
this might be not as easy a process because of several factors, including whether the device 
is company owned or employee owned. 
Self-Service Methods
The self-service method of onboarding is just as the name implies. This is an automatic 
method that is simple and transparent to the user. A typical confi guration is at least two 
different wireless service set identifi ers (SSIDs) that are on two different virtual local area 
networks (VLANs). One will be an open or guest network, and the other will be a secured 
corporate network. In most cases, the user will connect their wireless device to the open 
SSID. They then launch their Internet browser and access the enrollment web page. At this 
point, the user will enter their corporate credentials and follow the onscreen instructions. 
This process is explained more in the Real World Scenario “Onboarding a Mobile Device 
Using Certifi cates,” later in this chapter.
Certificate Enrollment Methods
As mobile technology and mobility of devices continues to advance, security is becoming 
even a greater concern. This advancement in technology has also made what was once a 
more-complicated method of securing mobile device communications much easier. One 
very secure method is using certifi cate-based authentication and public key infrastructure 
(PKI) technology. PKI is discussed in more detail in Chapter 16, “Device Authentication 
and Data Encryption.” With regard to mobile devices, certifi cate enrollment processes are 
becoming very popular. Many mobile device management (MDM) solutions are designed 
to distribute certifi cates to end users. If an organization already has a PKI in place, the 
process to allow for certifi cate enrollment is fairly straightforward. The main difference is 
that the certifi cate is installed on various mobile devices instead of only on computers. This 
process is explained more in the Real World Scenario “Onboarding a Mobile Device Using 
Certifi cates,” later in this chapter.

Mobile Device Management Onboarding and Provisioning 
497
Role-Based Enrollment
Role-based onboarding uses the same concept as role-based access control. Role-
based access control (RBAC) is a way of restricting access to only authorized users. 
This access is from authentication based on specifi c roles, rather than user identities. 
It was designed to ease the task of security administration on large networks. RBAC 
has characteristics like those of a common network administration practice—the 
creation of users and groups. RBAC may also fi t well under the authorization part of 
authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) services because, again, it has 
similar characteristics.
To give a user on a computer network access to a network resource, best practices 
recommend creating a group object, assigning the group permissions to the resource, and 
then adding the user object to the group. This method allows any user who is a member of 
the group to be granted access to the resource. Role-based access control can be applied to 
various activities users may perform while connected to a wireless LAN, including limiting 
the amount of throughput, enforcing time restrictions, or controlling access to specifi c 
resources such as the Internet.
Let’s look at an example. Your organization consists of several departments that use 
resources available on the wireless network. The departments are sales, engineering, 
and accounting. Each department has specifi c requirements for what they need from the 
wireless LAN, and when they need to access it. This is where RBAC would be a great fi t. 
If the network administrator wanted to restrict access to the wireless LAN for the sales 
department from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., she could create a role using this feature. If the 
engineering department was using too much bandwidth, a role could be created to restrict 
throughput for that department. These are a couple of examples where RBAC can work 
with a wireless LAN.
Other Enrollment and Identification Methods
There are other enrollment and identifi cation methods that may be used for mobile device 
onboarding. These include using the International Mobile Station Equipment Identity 
(IMEI) number, the Integrated Circuit Card Identifi er (ICCID), and Simple Certifi cate 
Enrollment Protocol (SCEP). 
International Mobile Station Equipment Identity (IMEI)  The IMEI is a number that 
uniquely identifi es cellular mobile phones. It can be used as part of the enrollment process 
to identify the device. 
Integrated Circuit Card Identifier (ICCID)  The ICCD is a number that is assigned to a 
Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card that will identify the SIM card internationally.
Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP)  Simple Certifi cate Enrollment Protocol 
(SCEP) is a protocol, which as you know is a set of rules. It was originally designed for 

498 
Chapter 12 ■ Implementation of Mobile Device Technology
installing certifi cates on infrastructure devices such as routers and Ethernet switches. 
SCEP is available as an add-on for Microsoft Windows Server Certifi cate Services, 
starting with Windows Server 2003. For mobile device enrollments, SCEP has been 
expanded to allow mobile device management (MDM) solutions to install certifi cates 
on various mobile device types. SCEP is natively supported by Apple iOS devices such 
as iPhones and iPads, starting with iOS 4, and is the preferred way for certifi cates to be 
installed on these device types.
Onboarding a Mobile Device Using Certiﬁ cates
In this Real Word Scenario, I will be demonstrating some of the onboarding topics using a 
product from Cloudpath Networks called XpressConnect. Cloudpath Networks, founded 
in 2006, is the market leader for automated device enablement (ADE) and the inventor of 
the Wi-Fi onboarding paradigm. You can read more about Cloudpath Networks and see 
the product line at its website (cloudpath.net). The Microsoft Windows 7 operating sys-
tem was used to perform these steps, and they may vary slightly depending on the device 
and operating system in use.
Access Point Setup
A common way to perform this type of onboarding is to have two service set identiﬁ ers 
(SSIDs) available. One SSID will be conﬁ gured as an open wireless network. This would 
commonly be the “guest” SSID on many corporate wireless LANs. The second SSID is 
conﬁ gured as a secure SSID using WPA2-Enterprise with CCMP/AES, and is conﬁ gured to 
connect to RADIUS services and to query a directory service such as Microsoft Windows 
Active Directory. This SSID will provide the secure communications that allow the device 
to be properly onboarded.

499
The User Experience
The end user of the device will ﬁ rst connect to the open SSID, allowing them to get a 
wireless connection to the network. Then they will enter a URL that will allow them to 
connect to the XpressConnect enrollment portal used to activate devices. Once the 
URL is entered into a browser, the welcome page will appear.

500 
Chapter 12 ■ Implementation of Mobile Device Technology
The user will read and agree to the terms and conditions, and click the Start button to 
continue. The user will then be presented with a page allowing them to select either 
visitor access or employee access. 
If the Visitors option is selected, the user will be prompted for a voucher code that can 
be obtained from an employee of the company. The employee that provides the voucher 
may be a single individual assigned to the task or the visitor’s company contact.
(continued)

Mobile Device Management Onboarding and Provisioning

Once the voucher code is entered and the user clicks the Continue button, the 
XpressConnect software will load. Depending on the operating system in use (Microsoft 
Windows, Apple devices including the iPhone and iPad, Android devices, or others), the 
user may be prompted to download and install the XpressConnect software.
After the software has loaded, the wizard program will launch and the enrollment 
process will begin. 

502 
Chapter 12 ■ Implementation of Mobile Device Technology
If the Employees option is selected, the user will be prompted to enter their credentials. 
These credentials will be used to query the organization’s directory database and will 
allow for a Transport Layer Security (TLS) certiﬁ cate to be installed on the mobile device.
(continued)

Mobile Device Management Onboarding and Provisioning 
503
After the correct credentials are entered, the user will click the Continue button and the 
XpressConnect software will load. After the software has loaded, the wizard program will 
launch and the enrollment process will begin. At this point, the user will be prompted that a 
certiﬁ cate will be installed on the device. Once the user agrees to install the certiﬁ cate, the 
wizard will continue.
Once the wizard is ﬁ nished, the user will have secure access to the network using an 
EAP-TLS certiﬁ cate.
You can view a short video about the XpressConnect enrollment system by visiting the 
Cloudpath web site at cloudpath.net and clicking the Watch A Video box.
Voucher Methods
Organizations can also use a voucher distribution method for network access. Cisco 
Systems recently acquired Broadhop, which has a policy control product, Quantum Policy 
Suite (QPS). An organization can use this product to generate vouchers that employees or 
guests can use to access the wireless LAN or other network services. Another feature of the 
Cisco QPS product is something called One-Click. Users are granted access to the network 
after reading an acceptance policy and clicking a button, thereby agreeing to the policy. 
In addition to software applications, some organizations use hardware solutions to control 
access. For example, Cisco Systems Integrated Services Gateway is basically a router that 
controls access to the network. It can be used with various access methods, including 
wireless networking. A feature known as Media Access Control Transparent Auto Login 
(MAC TAL) allows devices to be automatically logged on to the network based on the 

504 
Chapter 12 ■ Implementation of Mobile Device Technology
device’s Media Access Control (MAC) hardware address. This is typically used with web-
based authentication on publicly accessible wireless networks.
Mobile Device Management 
Offboarding and Deprovisioning
Offboarding originally was a term used to identify how the human recourses department 
of a company would verify that an employee leaving the company would be properly 
dismissed from their job duties. The process could include the following steps:
 
■
Remove all personal items from the workplace.
 
■
Return identification badges, access cards, parking passes, keys, and other items that 
allow physical access.
 
■
Return any company-owned technology assets, such as a notebook computer or cell 
phone.
 
■
Return any company credit cards and settle up any outstanding expenses.
 
■
Sign a nondisclosure and/or noncompete document.
When it comes to mobile device technology, offboarding is a similar but slightly more 
technological process. Just as onboarding allows a user to register their device to gain 
access to the company’s network resources, offboarding is required to remove any access 
when a user leaves the company. 
Before the popularity of current mobile device technology with employee-owned 
devices, offboarding was a more straightforward process. In most cases the company 
issued a notebook computer and possibly a cell phone to an employee when they started 
with the company, and those items were returned to the company upon the employee’s 
departure. Now with the advancements in mobile technology and the “bring your own 
device” philosophy, offboarding is a little more challenging. If proper offboarding policies 
and procedures are not specifi ed or followed, it could result in potential security issues 
for the organization. Depending on the business model or organization type, industry 
regulatory compliance with, for example, Payment Card Industry (PCI) standards or the 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) may also play a role in the 
offboarding procedure. PCI and HIPAA were discussed in Chapter 11.
There are different methods used with the technology offboarding process. At a 
minimum, a checklist of some type would be benefi cial to ensure all the necessary 
steps are successfully performed. The process of offboarding technology devices can be 
automated through the use of mobile device management (MDM) solutions to ensure 
that the process is properly followed and correctly executed without reliance on a manual 
checklist.

Mobile Device Management Offboarding and Deprovisioning 
505
Employee Terminations and Mobile Technology
Depending on the specifi c situation, employee termination may not be a pleasant task. 
A mutual or voluntary departure is much easier to deal with than a one-sided departure. 
With respect to information technology, companies must have a detailed policy as to how 
to handle employee terminations. 
As the use of mobile technology, both  company-owned and personal devices, continues 
to increase, so does the amount of company data that is contained within these devices. If 
not handled correctly, employee terminations could put company data such as intellectual 
property and trade secrets at risk. In addition to access to data, other considerations such as 
remote access to company network resources must also be considered. Some statistics show 
that more than 50 percent of employees who are no longer associated with their former 
company may still have access to the company’s private information. Also, more than 
25 percent of former employees may still have access to the company’s resources through 
remote access technologies. A well-defi ned corporate security policy will help prevent this type 
of issue and will help to keep company data and resources secure after employee departures.
Mobile Device Deactivation
Deactivating a mobile device can easily be accomplished using a mobile device management 
(MDM) solution. This can be done remotely in the event that the device is lost or stolen, 
or an employee leaves the company involuntarily. Performing a remote wipe or remote 
lock will help to prevent someone from using the device and potentially accessing company 
resources. Remote wipe and remote lock are discussed further in Chapter 13, “Mobile 
Device Operation and Management Concepts.”
Mobile Device Migrations
With mobile device technology advancing at a fast pace, it is not uncommon for an 
organization to change which devices and supporting technology they use as a standard. 
One example is if a company decides to move from a BlackBerry platform to an Android 
platform, or from Android to Apple iOS devices. Migrations are also likely in organizations 
that allow employee-owned (BYOD) devices, because people may upgrade to newer, more 
feature-rich devices at a quicker pace than they do with company-owned devices.
Removing Applications and Corporate Data
When someone who has been allowed to use an employee-owned device to access corporate 
resources leaves a company, it may be necessary to remove specifi c mobile applications. These 
types of applications are typically proprietary or customized for the organization, but in 
some cases they may be commercial off-the-shelf applications that are owned and licensed by 
the company. If the device is employee owned, the personal applications that do not belong 
to or are not licensed by the company should remain intact on the device. In addition to 

506 
Chapter 12 ■ Implementation of Mobile Device Technology
applications, corporate data will more than likely also need to be removed, or “wiped,” from 
the device. This may include company proprietary information, intellectual property data, 
trade secrets, and any other data that could be a security risk if obtained by individuals who 
are not employed by the company and bound by company confi dentially agreements. 
Asset Disposal and Recycling
Statistics show that technology devices that are decommissioned from use with the intent 
of being destroyed or recycled often still contain personal and company data that is either 
readily available or easily recoverable. These devices include notebook computers, tablets, 
and smartphones. Many computers still contain mechanical hard drives with a physical 
disk that is used to store the data. If you were to delete all of the data, there is still a 
possibility that some or all of the data could still be recovered with off-the-shelf software. 
Some newer computers are equipped with electronic or solid-state drives (SSDs), and even 
though there are no moving mechanical parts or physical disks, the same potential issue of 
recovering data still exists. In fact, it has been reported that in some cases it is not possible 
to reliably erase all data from a solid-state drive. 
Organizations should take proper measures to ensure that data is not accessible or 
recoverable from devices that are decommissioned. This should be defi ned in the corporate 
information technology security policy with an outline of the process and steps that should 
be taken to delete data from a device. Home users should follow best practices that are 
available from the manufacturer of the device. This usually involves performing a factory 
reset or performing a “wipe” function on the device. The physical disk is only one concern. 
Other potential media types that can store data or personal information include removable 
SIM cards, micro SD cards, and other types of internal storage. The removable cards are 
typically inexpensive, and it may be best to keep them for other uses or arrange for them to 
be physically destroyed for security purposes. 
Summary
In this chapter I explained the System Development Life Cycle. We also explored pilot 
testing, which includes selecting the individuals or groups to be part of the test, soliciting 
feedback, monitoring the testing, making any necessary changes, getting proper approvals, 
and fi nally performing the full deployment. I explained infrastructure and wireless client 
devices used with over-the-air technology such as wireless LAN and cellular. We explored 
the process used for bringing client devices onto a network for the fi rst time, which is 
known as onboarding, and taking devices offl ine or off the company network, which is 
known as offboarding. We explored both manual and automatic onboarding. We also 
looked at the offboarding process and the proper procedures to ensure that company data 
is secure after an employee leaves an organization. Finally, I explained the importance 
of preparing mobile technology devices for recycling or disposal after they have been

decommissioned. You saw that deleting data from a device may not really prevent it from 
being seen or accessed again, and that certain technology factors must be considered.
Chapter Essentials
Know the basic System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) concept.  The phases of  technology 
deployment commonly include plan, design, test, build, deploy, and maintain.
Understand the concepts of a pilot program, testing, evaluation, approval, and 
launching.  Know the common areas of a pilot test program. These include (but are not 
limited to) selecting people to participate, receiving feedback and monitoring, making 
necessary changes, getting approval from management, and deploying the technology.
Understand the importance of proper and complete documentation.  Creating clear and 
concise documentation will help in providing and maintaining a well-planned deployment. 
Understand that technical documentation is not static and will need to be maintained and 
updated due to technology, the corporate environment, and other changes that may occur.
Know that activation of mobile devices will differ depending on the device type.  Mobile 
devices that use wireless LAN technology such as IEEE 802.11 require only the proper 
credentials to connect to a network. Unless the user is at a paid hotspot, no fees are required 
for this type of connection, and no activation is required. Bluetooth technology is used 
to create a personal area network within the user’s immediate area, which requires only 
the proper credentials, such as a personal identifi cation number. Cellular devices such as 
smartphones require activation from a wireless carrier, and fees are associated with their use.
Understand the different device types and adapters used to facilitate over-the-air 
access.  Know the different device types used based on the technology. This includes 
devices used with wireless LAN and cellular data. Universal Serial Bus (USB) adapters 
allow for access and Secure Digital (SD) adapters allow for information storage.
Understand the meaning of on-boarding and provisioning.  Be familiar with the different 
methods available and used to bring a device onto a network for the fi rst time. This process 
is known as onboarding or provisioning. Know the different methods used, which include 
manual methods and automatic methods that will be transparent to the user.
Understand the meaning of offboarding and deprovisioning.   Be familiar with the 
importance of offboarding a device, or removing it from service. This process will help to 
ensure the integrity of a company’s proprietary information, intellectual property data, 
trade secrets, and other data. Understand the importance of proper mobile device disposal 
and recycling.

It is important to understand available content management 
options and evaluate what would best fi t your organization. 
In this chapter, we will look at the differences between some 
available solutions for mobile device content management and distribution, including enter-
prise server-based and cloud-based solutions. We will also explore factors related to content 
management, such as changes, permissions, data encryption, and version control. 
Understanding the remote management capabilities of mobile devices is important, 
particularly to ensure the integrity of company data and resources on a lost or stolen 
device. We will survey remote management capabilities such as location services, locking 
a device remotely, and wiping a device remotely, among others. We will also explore life 
cycle operations such as renewing expired mobile device certifi cates, software updates, and 
hardware and fi rmware upgrades. 
I will explain the importance of technology change management and why an organiza-
tion must control any and all changes to the current information technology infrastructure 
to ensure proper operation, compliance, and security. We will look at the technology 
end-of-life model and how it may have an effect on mobile device and networking 
technology. Finally, I will explain some of the common best practices used to help ensure 
a successful mobile device deployment.
Centralized Content, Application 
Distribution, and Content 
Management Systems
With a centralized location for company data, users can access content from anywhere they 
have an active Internet connection. Keeping the corporate content centralized also provides 
better collaboration opportunities, increased employee productivity, and more robust security 
management compared to the public fi le sharing services that are readily available. 
Centralized content repositories and their associated content distribution methods can 
be either corporate server-based (on-premise) or cloud-based solutions. Both of these options 
come with their own unique set of challenges. In Chapter 10, “Introduction to Mobile Device 
Management,” we explored the differences between on-premise and Software as a Service 
(SaaS) mobile device management solutions. The same principles apply to content and appli-
cation management and distribution methods. Using a corporate server-based on-premise 
solution may require extra management overhead for the IT department as well as an invest-
ment in additional hardware solutions. A cloud-based solution may incur recurring monthly 
fees and an Internet connection will always be required for all management and control 

Centralized Content, Application Distribution, and Content Management Systems

functions. It is important to weigh the pros and cons of each solution to ensure that the best 
and most cost-effective solution is selected based on your organization’s needs. 
In addition to static content such as company data and mobile device 
apps, real-time content such as streaming video needs to be taken into 
consideration. One method for delivering real-time content is multicast 
technology. Multicast technology allows for the same content to be deliv-
ered simultaneously to a large number of devices compared to unicast 
technology, which is one-to-one communication. With the continued 
development of mobile technology, the need for multicast real-time 
communications is becoming more prevalent.
Server-Based Distribution Models
Server-based content distribution gives an organization the ability to control the entire 
process of content storage and distribution, which includes physical access, permissions, 
and other administrative tasks. Like any on-premise technology solution, this type of distri-
bution has both advantages and disadvantages, as mentioned in the preceding section and 
explained in Chapter 10 with respect to MDM solutions. 
Whether the content repositories are centralized or decentralized will also have an impact 
on the overall performance of the process. Depending on the size of the network, number 
of devices, and type of content, using a centralized content storage and distribution method 
comes with its share of challenges. These include potential bottlenecks due to infrastructure 
connectivity, network latency, and server availability, potentially resulting in a below-par 
 performance for the end user. However, it really depends on the infrastructure that is in place 
in addition to the connections to the outside wide area network or the Internet. If imple-
mented correctly, the centralized method could be a viable solution, but all of the components 
must be closely evaluated to reduce the chances of poor results for the end user. 
A decentralized solution will lessen the chances of some of the issues with a central-
ized repository. However, a decentralized solution comes with its set of challenges as well, 
which include cost and potential administration issues. A decentralized solution will still be 
centrally managed but will have physical servers at various locations for content distribu-
tion to limit the negative effects of a single source location.
Cloud-Based Distribution Models
Another option for mobile device content storage and distribution is using the cloud-based 
model. This operates in a similar manner to other cloud-based networking solutions, where 
a third-party provider handles the content storage mechanisms. The cloud-based model will 
allow a user to access information from anywhere in the world an Internet connection is 
available. This offers a convenient and easy way to access information, data, and applica-
tions for which the user has been granted the adequate permissions. 

512 
Chapter 13 ■ Mobile Device Operation and Management Concepts
As with the corporate server-based model, the cloud-based model has its own set of chal-
lenges and concerns, one of which may be security. If implemented correctly, security should 
not be an issue, but the key words here are implemented correctly. It will also require end 
user cooperation to help ensure that they are following policy and are using the services cor-
rectly. If not used correctly, cloud-based storage solutions may result in an effect known as 
“shadow IT,” which occurs when information technology solutions are built and used with-
out company approval. These include publicly available fi le sharing and storage services. 
Another disadvantage is that you are at the mercy of the cloud provider when it comes to 
bandwidth and the data backup and restore solutions. 
Selecting the correct cloud service provider will take time, and statistics such as available 
bandwidth and server availability must be analyzed to determine if they are a good fi t for 
the organization.
Content Permissions, Data Encryption, 
and Version Control
As you saw in earlier chapters, wireless and mobile device technology is a moving target, 
and changes are occurring constantly. These changes can be the result of advancements 
with the actual technology used or due to device and software upgrades. Either way, it’s 
critical to have the correct plan in place to ensure consistency throughout the organiza-
tion. Basic network administration tasks include assigning permissions or rights to network 
resources and making certain data is safe in transit by using secure encryption methods. 
With mobile device technology all information is transmitted across the open air, so proper 
permissions and encryption techniques are even more critical. Maintaining a version con-
trol mechanism will help to guarantee that the user base is consistent with operating sys-
tems, applications, and device updates.
Content Permissions and Data Encryption
A well-planned and executed security strategy will help to ensure that company policy is 
implemented and enforced as intended with every technology deployment. This strategy will 
include access control methods and encryption policies to protect all company informa-
tion and available resources. Network administration tasks include validating that access 
to company resources is available only to those who need it. This is where permissions 
or rights (depending on the operating system) come into play. Because of the fact mobile 
device technology is wireless, encryption of data plays a major role.
Permissions  Permissions, or what some operating systems call rights, gives the adminis-
trator the ability to restrict access to a resource by using an access control list. The specifi c 
categorization of each user or the group they may belong to determines the type of access 
they have to a network resource. One example would be access to a shared folder for the 
sales department. People in the sales department would be added to a group called sales. 

Mobile Device Remote Management Capabilities 
513
Only the sales group would then be granted permissions to access the sales shared folder. 
Any other users who required access would have to be granted access by the network 
administrator. 
It is important to understand that different levels of permissions exist, depending on the 
user or group needs. For example, a group could be granted read only permissions, which 
would allow them to see the data in a shared folder but not make any changes to it. 
Permissions can be very strict and will be set based on the specifi c needs of your organi-
zation. The technical details of assigning permissions and the levels of these permissions are 
beyond the scope of this book.
Data encryption  In the most basic sense, data encryption is scrambling data by using some 
type of encryption algorithm so that only the sender and the intended recipients that know 
the algorithm can decrypt the data to see the contents. The only way mobile wireless devices 
can send and receive data is by using radio frequency and over-the-air technology. Therefore, 
the concept of data encryption is of the utmost importance. Data encryption will ensure that 
the information sent using over-the-air technologies is secure while in transit. Data encryption 
methods for data at rest (stationary) and data in transit (traversing a network) are  discussed in 
more detail in Chapter 16, “Device Authentication and Data Encryption.”
Version Control
In a general sense, version control or revision control is a way to ensure that all software 
and hardware technology used across an organization is consistent. This is a process that 
is also used with creating and maintaining documentation, software programs, and com-
puter code that is used to create software programs, web pages, and the like. With mobile 
device technology and employee-owned or bring your own device (BYOD) adoption, this is 
even more of a concern due to the diverse array of devices that can be used within an orga-
nization. A well-documented plan that is followed and enforced will help to ensure that 
consistent hardware and software solutions are in use and help to lessen the potential for 
technical support issues that could have been avoided.
Mobile Device Remote Management 
Capabilities
If you have ever not been able to locate your smartphone or other mobile device, you have 
experienced a terrible feeling. The fi rst thought that runs through your mind is that the 
data on the device is in the hands of someone else. Knowing that you have the ability to 
remotely lock your device provides some level of comfort if this were to happen. Most of 
the enterprise mobile device management solutions listed in Chapter 10 provide a feature 
that enables you to remotely lock, unlock, and wipe the device. There are also some apps 
available that you can install to provide the same features if a device is for personal use 
only. One example of such a product is Android Device Manager from Google (used with 
Android devices). 

514 
Chapter 13 ■ Mobile Device Operation and Management Concepts
In addition, an organization’s mobile device management solution and security policy 
will provide information on how to properly handle reporting procedures. This is true 
regardless of whether the device is employee owned or company owned.
Another remote management option is remote control. A company network administra-
tor or support person can take control of a device and assist with technical issues the user 
may be experiencing. There are also apps available that will allow you to remotely control 
your home or offi ce computer from a mobile device such as an Android device or iPhone. 
The ability to perform remote management on mobile devices is an important compo-
nent of mobile device management. These features will allow a network administrator to 
perform specifi c tasks on a device to help ensure the security and integrity of an organiza-
tion’s data and to limit unauthorized access to company resources. 
Mobile Device Location Services
In Chapter 10, I explained location services as they pertain to geo-fencing and geo-location. 
Here we will explore how location services can be enabled or disabled on a mobile device 
and the ability to track a device’s location within a few meters if it needs to be located as 
the result of device loss or theft. Depending on the solution in use, location services may 
need to be enabled on the physical device in order to physically locate it. For example, 
Android Device Manager from Google will require location services to be enabled on a 
device in order to track its physical location within a close proximity. Figure 13.1 shows 
how to enable location services on an Android tablet device.
F I G U R E 13 .1   Enabling locations services using the settings shown on an Android 
mobile device

Mobile Device Remote Management Capabilities 
515
Location services can allow you to pinpoint the exact location of a device within a very 
close range, in some cases less than 10 meters. There are different methods used for loca-
tion services:
 
■
Global Positioning Satellite (GPS)
 
■
Cellular provider network
 
■
Wireless LAN technology
 
■
Applications
 
■
Internet Protocol (IP) address
In most cases, these tracking options must be available and enabled with the device’s 
confi guration or Internet browser in order to use the location services.
Remote Lock and Unlock
Remote lock allows you to lock the screen of a device that may or may not be in your posses-
sion. This will prevent the device from being used by anyone who does not know the correct 
passcode to unlock the device. Depending on the product used for the remote lock, you may 
also be able to change the unlock password and provide a message that will appear on the 
locked screen with instructions or some other type of message. Figure 13.2 shows a screen 
capture of an Android device that was remotely locked with a message that was displayed.
F I G U R E 13 . 2  Result of a remote lock command by Android Device Manager

516 
Chapter 13 ■ Mobile Device Operation and Management Concepts
Notice in Figure 13.2 that a message was sent with the remote lock command provid-
ing instructions to the user of the device. To unlock a device, the user will need to enter the 
unlock passcode. A user may need a remote unlock, for example, if they forgot the pass-
code. Most mobile device management solutions offer the capability to clear the passcode 
so the user can get access to the device. The user will then be able to enter a new passcode 
to unlock the device.
Device Remote Wipe
If a device has been lost or stolen device and it contains data for “your eyes only,” such as 
corporate information, you may need to wipe the data and reset the device to the factory 
default settings. This pertains not only to personal devices but also to company-owned 
devices or devices that are employee owned and allowed to be used on the corporate network.
However, before any remote wipe action is implemented, it is critical to follow corporate 
security policy and determine the appropriate type of response. If data containerization is uti-
lized, only the data in the corporate container may need to be wiped. Containerization is the 
separation of corporate data and apps from personal data and apps. This concept is more preva-
lent with employee-owned devices than with company-owned devices. It is similar to partition-
ing a hard disk drive in a computer. You create different partitions on a physical device, keeping 
content separate regardless of whether it is operating systems and apps or data. Container tech-
nology allows an organization to control only what is in the corporate container rather than the 
entire device. This provides some peace of mind for the user of the device, who will know their 
personal data is separate and cannot be accessed, deleted, or remotely wiped. 
In addition to enterprise-based mobile device management (MDM) products and other web-
based products such as Android Device Manager, there are some specifi c products that will 
allow a user to perform a remote wipe. One such product is Outlook Web App (OWA, formerly 
known as Microsoft Outlook Web Access), which is a web-based email interface that is used 
with Microsoft Exchange Server. This product allows a user to access their email from any place 
they have an active Internet connection. With only a few keystrokes, a user can remotely wipe 
a device if it is lost or stolen. This particular product is not limited to only one specifi c mobile 
operating system; it works for various device types, such as Android, iOS, and Windows Phone.
Exercise 13.1 illustrates the steps to enable and use Android Device Manager provided 
by Google.
E X E R C I S E  1 3 .1
Enable Android Device Manager
In this exercise you will enable Android Device Manager, provided by Google. To perform 
this exercise, you will need an Android-capable device, or you can use the Android emu-
lator program you installed in Exercise 10.1, “Installing Android Emulator Software in 
Microsoft Windows,” in Chapter 10. To use this feature to remotely locate, lock, or wipe 
an Android device, you will need to enable it on the device and associate the device with 
a Google account. If more than one person uses a tablet, only the tablet owner can turn 
on Android Device Manager.

Life Cycle Operations 
519
You can now set up your device to be managed. The features available with this service 
are ring, lock, and erase. Keep in mind that once you associate this device to your Google 
account, there is no way to remove it. It will remain connected to that Google account. 
However, the device could be associated to different Google accounts if needed.
If you decide to use Android Device Manager or any service that provides 
location tracking and feel your device has been stolen, do not attempt to 
retrieve the device yourself. You should immediately contact the appropri-
ate law enforcement agency and let them handle it based on the laws that 
are in place.
Remote Control
Mobile device remote control allows technical support to access a device remotely and 
make changes to it as if it were physically in their possession. Many of the MDM solutions 
listed in Chapter 10 provide this feature. However, stand-alone solutions are also available. 
Remote control capabilities give support personnel the power to be able to assist a user with 
technical issues and help resolve problems from any location as long as the user is connected.
Reporting Features
Many of the products that provide location services also provide reporting features that 
allow the user of a device to store and utilize information about the device’s location. The 
ability to reuse this information provides a convenience to the user should they want to 
revisit the location. This feature will also allow for the device’s location history to be stored 
within the program or the user account database. 
Sometimes a user might not want this history to be stored. For example, some users 
travel constantly, rarely using the same location, and may not want to clutter the database 
with a lot of irrelevant information. Other users might want to protect their privacy or 
security. The steps to disable location reporting on an Android device are as follows:
1. 
From the home screen click or tap the Settings icon.
2. 
Click or tap the Google Settings icon.
3. 
Click or tap the Maps & Latitude option icon.
4. 
Select the Location Reporting option from the Location Settings screen. 
5. 
Click or tap the Do Not Update Your Location option.
6. 
Uncheck the Enable Location History option to turn the feature off.
Life Cycle Operations
In Chapter 12, “Implementation of Mobile Device Technology,” you learned about the 
System Development Life Cycle (SDLC). With respect to information technology (IT) and 
especially mobile device technology, the SDLC consists of several different phases and 

520 
Chapter 13 ■ Mobile Device Operation and Management Concepts
processes, one of which is maintaining the system that was deployed. This part of the 
SDLC includes several areas that need to be dealt with:
 
■
Certificate expiration and renewal
 
■
Software updates
 
■
Software patches
 
■
Device hardware upgrades
 
■
Device firmware updates
Certificate Expiration and Renewal
In Chapter 12, we explored mobile device onboarding, including the certifi cate enroll-
ment method. Using certifi cates is one of the most secure ways to validate a user’s identity. 
Onboarding using certifi cates is a straightforward process. Figure 13.3 shows one example 
of an onboarding solution, the certifi cate settings in Cloudpath XpressConnect.
F I G U R E  13 . 3 :  The certificate settings on the Cloudpath XpressConnect enrollment 
page where you can set the validity period of the certificate
Working with certifi cates can also mean extra administration overhead. Just as a driver’s 
license will expire and must be renewed, a device certifi cate has an expiration date and will 
need to be renewed. In addition to expiring, certifi cates can be revoked for various reasons. 
Among MDM administration tasks is the administration of user and device certifi cates. 
In most cases, MDM solutions can be set up to automatically renew a certifi cate as the 

Life Cycle Operations 
521
expiration date approaches. This will ensure that user access is not affected by an expired 
certifi cate. If corporate security policy determines that certifi cates are not to be automati-
cally renewed prior to the expiration date, then another process will need to be imple-
mented to provide uninterrupted service. 
Certifi cates may need to be revoked for various reasons, such as, for example, if a device 
is lost or if an employee is terminated. Both of these situations would justify immediately 
revoking a digital certifi cate. However, proper procedures and policy must be followed 
prior to the revocation. The task of revoking a certifi cate is no more diffi cult than the task 
to issue or renew a certifi cate. It can be done within the MDM administration console with 
a few clicks of the mouse. When a certifi cate is revoked, the device and user will no longer 
have access to corporate data, applications, and other resources. This will take effect imme-
diately after the certifi cate has been revoked.
Other life cycle maintenance operations involve keeping all aspects of the technology up-
to-date. This include software updates and patches, device upgrades, and fi rmware updates, 
which are discussed in the upcoming sections.
Software Updates
Updating operating systems and software applications will help to enhance the end user expe-
rience. Mobile devices require updates for various reasons. Many times updates become avail-
able to fi x documented issues or to provide security enhancements. In other cases, updates 
provide new features. There are several possible ways that a mobile device can be updated:
 
■
Software update tools
 
■
Through an Internet connection to the provider or carrier network
 
■
From the device itself
Device manufacturers try to make updates easy to help ensure the best and most secure 
device operation possible for the end user. Many updates are created because of experiences 
of the device user population. Therefore, providing software updates will help to lessen 
potential future technical support or help desk calls.
Although most applications provide backward compatibility to previous versions, it is 
preferred to have all devices on the same version to maintain consistent usage throughout 
the organization.
Software Patches
People are sometimes confused about the difference between a software upgrade and a 
 software patch. In some cases, the difference may be a matter of interpretation. In most 
cases a patch, or hotfi x, will fi x a problem or a bug in the software that is usually the result 
of technical support issues or engineering and programming changes. In many cases, a 
patch also provides security fi xes that have been created due to security holes that were 
discovered after the software was released to the general public. In most cases, patches are 
identifi ed by the same version number as the software, whereas a completely new version 
number is used for a software update. For example, v7.0 of a software application might 

522 
Chapter 13 ■ Mobile Device Operation and Management Concepts
have a patch named v7.0.2315, showing the original version number in addition to the ver-
sion number of the patch that was applied.
Device Hardware Upgrades
This type of upgrade is usually the result of changes to the technology that is in use. With 
respect to mobile devices such as smartphones or tablets, this occurs in many cases much 
more often than with computer technology. With BYOD implementations, it can occur 
much more frequently than with company-owned devices because a single user is much 
more inclined to upgrade their own personal devices within a shorter time frame than an 
organization’s technology refresh policy will allow.
Device Firmware Updates
Device fi rmware is the instruction set that allows hardware to operate based on its design. 
Firmware is simply software that remains in memory when the power is removed. It tends 
to be hardware oriented, but not all fi rmware involves the control of hardware. Many Layer 
7 user interfaces and agents are implemented as fi rmware burned into read-only memory 
(ROM) devices.
Conversely, there are many examples of software directly controlling hardware. Most 
drivers for hardware devices are software (loaded into volatile memory only when power is 
present) and not fi rmware (always resident in static memory regardless of power). Firmware 
upgrades are common support tasks that need to be done periodically, either to fi x issues 
with the way the hardware is operating or to provide new features for the hardware.
All wireless infrastructure devices, either SOHO grade or enterprise grade, allow you 
to upgrade the fi rmware. In enterprise environments, fi rmware upgrades can be performed 
either manually or automatically with the aid of wireless LAN management system soft-
ware. For mobile device technology, it is typically accomplished from the device itself and 
can be performed automatically.
It is imperative to follow the manufacturer’s instructions when performing 
a firmware upgrade. Failure to do so may result in the device becoming 
unusable or needing to be returned to the manufacturer for repair. Several 
items are important when you are performing a firmware upgrade on any 
device:
 
■
Always verify that you have the correct ﬁ rmware ﬁ le for the device to be 
upgraded prior to performing the upgrade.
 
■
Always read the release notes that come with the ﬁ rmware.
 
■
Never upgrade ﬁ rmware on a device that is running on battery power.
 
■
Only upgrade devices that are physically plugged into a reliable power 
source.
 
■
Never power down the device while the ﬁ rmware upgrade is in process.

Life Cycle Operations 
523
With respect to wireless LAN infrastructure devices, the fi rmware in enterprise-grade 
access points and wireless controllers can usually be upgraded using the command-line 
interface instead of the GUI if desired.
In Exercise 13.2, you will check the version number of the fi rmware on an Android 
device and perform an update if necessary.
E X E R C I S E  1 3 . 2
Update an Android Device to the Latest Firmware Version
This exercise shows the basic steps to upgrade the ﬁ rmware to the latest version on an 
Android tablet device. Prior to performing any type of ﬁ rmware upgrade, I highly recommend 
backing up all data and plugging the device into a power source. Even though chances 
are slim that you will experience a power outage or crash, it falls under best practices to 
maintain a reliable power source.
1. 
Tap or click the icon to open the device settings screen. The Android Apps and 
Widgets screen will appear.
2. 
Tap or click the Settings icon. The Settings screen will appear.
3. 
Scroll down to the bottom of the Settings screen.
4. 
Tap or click the About Tablet or About Phone button. The device’s Information screen 
will appear.

Click on the System Updates button. The device update screen will appear.
7. 
Tap or click the appropriate button to update or check for updates.
In this exercise, the system was up-to-date, as shown in the preceding screen shot. Keep 
in mind that this may not always be the case and you may need to update the device.

The Technology End-of-Life Model 
525
Information Technology Change 
Management
The purpose of information technology (IT) change management is to make sure any and 
all changes to the IT infrastructure will meet company requirements, conform to company 
policy, and maintain a high standard of functionality and reliability. By controlling, man-
aging, and approving changes, the change management group/department will help to 
reduce potential issues resulting from changes that may not have been adequately tested 
or proven. The implementation of mobile device technology within the enterprise environ-
ment creates many new challenges, especially with the adoption of bring your own device 
(BYOD) technology. Mobile device technology changes constantly; therefore, all parts 
must be considered prior to a deployment. For example, if a network administration team 
was to take it upon themselves to use remote wipe technology on mobile devices with-
out proper analysis and authority, the result could be catastrophic for the organization. 
Therefore, any changes that might have an impact on the operation of an organization 
must be carefully considered, validated, and approved prior to implementation. Proper 
research, assessment, and pilot programs will help to provide a positive experience. 
The Technology End-of-Life Model
With respect to information technology, the end of life (EOL) is when a hardware or 
software product is no longer useful. Often this is the result of advancements within the 
technology sector. Once the EOL has occurred, both the product and support for the 
product will no longer exist. The EOL is preceded by what is known as the end of sale 
(EOS). The EOS is when a manufacturer no longer produces the product or makes it 
available for sale. 
Looking at this from the perspective of a wireless LAN infrastructure device manu-
facturer, as WLAN technology changes and new standards are created, companies must 
design and manufacture new devices that will provide the newer technology to their 
current and potential new customer base. For example, the newest 802.11 technology 
used with enterprise organizations is 802.11ac. However, the availability of IEEE 
802.11ac technology does not mean that every organization will be upgrading all of their 
infrastructure devices immediately, nor does it mean that all WLAN manufacturers will 
stop manufacturing their IEEE 802.11n products. However, it is almost guaranteed that 
manufacturers no longer produce IEEE 802.11b–only access points, which makes them 
end-of-life devices. 
When it comes to mobile device technology, operating systems, hardware, and 
applications can all experience end of life.

526 
Chapter 13 ■ Mobile Device Operation and Management Concepts
Device Operating Systems
In Chapter 10 we explored some of the common operating systems that are used with 
mobile device technology, including Android, BlackBerry, Apple iOS, and Windows Phone. 
In many cases if an operating system is upgraded, an existing device will still be capable of 
supporting the new operating system. An upgraded operating system will commonly pro-
vide new features or enhancements to the existing features.
Device Hardware
The technology refresh time frame for an organization really depends on the type of orga-
nization, the number of devices it has, the need to upgrade, and the budget it has to work 
with. In some cases, the idea of “if it isn’t broken, don’t fi x it” may apply. For example, 
there are companies that use wireless bar code scanners that are considered legacy technol-
ogy, but these devices are serving their immediate purpose and therefore companies are 
reluctant to upgrade to more modern technology. 
Device Applications
Just as hardware has a specifi c life span, so do many of the available device applications. 
Device applications usually fall into one of two different categories: commercial, off-the-
shelf applications and proprietary or custom applications.
Commercial, Off-the-Shelf Applications  Chances are commercially available applications 
will be upgraded by the software manufacturer as technology advances. In most cases, the 
newer version of the applications will provide additional features and enhancements for 
the product. This is nothing new; we have been dealing with this on the computer side for 
decades. 
Proprietary or Custom Applications  An application may be developed that will provide 
specifi c functions based on an organization’s needs. In many cases, applications of this nature 
may not be updated as often. Sometimes it is cost prohibitive to update them except when 
absolutely necessary or when the budget allows.
Deployment Best Practices
Not every mobile device deployment scenario will be the same. One of the factors to be 
considered is the type of organization, such as whether it is a corporate, government, 
manufacturing, warehousing, education, or some other type of entity. Other factors include 
the number and types of devices and whether they are employee owned or company owned. 
Also, you must consider the type of applications. Following are some best practices that 
should be taken into consideration when planning a mobile device deployment.

Summary 
527
The User Base and the Device Population  Understand the type of applications that will 
be used based on the type of user, either a general user or a power user. Also, determine the 
number of devices that will be used. Keep in mind most organizations plan for three to fi ve 
devices per user.
Device Enrollment and Onboarding  Plan the device enrollment process carefully, and 
verify all potential situations that need to be covered for the devices that will be used on 
the network. This includes but is not limited to self-service methods, certifi cate enrollment 
methods, and role-based enrollment methods.
Validation of Device and User Profiles  Device and user profi les should be closely 
evaluated and tested to ensure that they meet the needs of the organization and perform as 
intended. Profi les should be pilot tested prior to deployment.
Security  Validate all processes so that the intended level of security for corporate data and 
resources is met and maintained. This includes using the correct access control methods, 
the strongest data encryption, and the correct permissions.
Device Containers  For organizations that have accepted the use of employee-owned 
devices, containerization is a recommended way to keep corporate data and personal data 
separate. Determine whether the container model is a feasible solution based on use and 
organization type.
Device and Application Compatibility  Make sure all devices and applications are 
compatible with the organization’s specifi cations and needs. This is especially important 
with organizations that allow employee-owned devices on the corporate network. Many 
organizations will use company-owned devices from the same wireless carrier to maintain 
consistency throughout.
Updates for Operating Systems and Applications  Keep all device software current by 
maintaining updates for the operating systems that are in use as well as any installed 
applications. Validate a process for testing and installing the latest patches and fi xes and 
security updates. I recommend registering with the device manufacturer or software 
developer to receive updates that may apply to the technology in use.
Push Technologies  Utilize the technology that is available to help streamline the 
deployment and support of mobile devices. For example, you can use push technology for 
notifi cations, content, confi gurations, and updates.
Feedback from the User Population  Always solicit feedback from the user population to 
ensure that the deployment is operating as intended and meets the needs of the organization. 
Summary
In this chapter, we explored the concept of content management, which includes how 
company information, including applications and data, is stored and distributed. 
We looked at enterprise server-based and cloud-based solutions that are available to 

528 
Chapter 13 ■ Mobile Device Operation and Management Concepts
provide mobile device content management. We explored factors that are related to con-
tent management, such as changes, version control, permissions, and more. We looked 
at some of the different remote management capabilities that allow an administrator 
to remotely track, lock, unlock, and wipe part of or an entire device with the under-
standing this will help to ensure the integrity of company data and resources. Enabling 
location services will allow you to locate a lost or stolen device. This chapter covered 
life cycle operations such as expired device certifi cates, upgrades, patches, and the 
importance of information technology change management. We explored the concept 
of end of life for devices and the understanding that operating systems, applications, 
and hardware all will need to be upgraded due to advancements in technology. Finally, 
I shared some of the best practices you can use for mobile device deployment to provide 
a quality user experience.
Chapter Essentials
Understand the concepts associated with the storage and distribution of corporate content.  With 
mobile device technology, different methods are available for the distribution of applications 
and company data. These include corporate server-based and cloud-based solutions.
Know the difference between server-based and cloud-based content distribution.  Be familiar 
with the differences between how company content can be stored and distributed from 
servers that are managed by the organization, which can be centralized or decentralized. 
Conversely, cloud-based solutions are available for organizations that wish to use external 
services and providers.
Know that centralized content distribution comes with its own set of challenges.  Using 
a centralized content storage and distribution method may cause some specifi c problems. 
These include potential bottlenecks, network latency, and server availability. Using a 
decentralized or distributed model can help to overcome some of these challenges.
Understand mobile device remote management capabilities.  Be familiar with the different 
ways mobile devices can be managed remotely. These include utilizing location services, 
remote lock and unlock features, remote wipe, and remote control capabilities.
Understand the potential use of mobile device location services.  Know how to enable location 
services on a device so you can track its location in the event of loss or theft. Be familiar 
with the different ways devices use location services, including Global Positioning Satellite 
(GPS), the wireless carrier network, and wireless LAN technology.
Know the potential benefits of remote lock and unlock features of mobile devices.  Understand 
the methods used to remotely lock and unlock devices in the event of loss or theft of a device. 
Mobile device management (MDM) solutions, along with some third-party applications 
and services, provide this capability. This technology will also allow an administrator or 
user to change the passcode or password that locks the device. 

Chapter Essentials 
529
Be familiar with remote wipe technology.  With the proper management technology, a 
device can be remotely wiped out and reset to factory default settings to ensure the protection 
of corporate data. Understand the concept of container technology and that partitioning 
a device allows an organization to control only what is in the corporate container rather 
than the entire device. Know that wiping a device may be a last resort and be sure to follow 
company policy.
Understand the basic life cycle operations.  Know the common life cycle maintenance 
operations, which include device certifi cate expiration, renewal and revocation, software 
updates and patches, and device upgrades. 
Know the importance of change management as it pertains to information technology.  The 
change management group in an organization is used to control, manage, and approve changes 
to the information technology infrastructure. Change management will help lessen potential 
issues that may result from changes that may not have been adequately tested or proven.
Understand the technology end-of-life model.  Due to advancements in technology, it is only 
a matter of time until aspects of mobile technology such as operating systems, device 
hardware, and applications reach the end of their life cycle.
Know the best practices for mobile device deployment.   Become familiar with mobile device 
deployment best practices, including secure onboarding with certifi cates, staying in touch 
with manufacturers for updates, and soliciting feedback from the user population.

hardware devices (such as computers, smartphones, and tablets) and the mobile operating 
systems that are used on the devices. I will explain the concept of third-party application 
vendors for online mobile app stores and the actual apps themselves. 
New risks and threats are also an unfortunate byproduct of technology advancements. 
We will look at the requirements for application (app) types that may be used within an 
organization. These include in-house, custom, and purpose-built apps. It will be benefi cial 
for you to become familiar with the three types of mobile apps, which are the native app, 
the web app, and the hybrid app. You will learn how to confi gure different applications 
and protocols (SMTP, IMAP, POP3, and MAPI) that work with electronic messaging and 
allow you to send and receive email messages. You will gain a better understanding of 
how to confi gure certain network parameters, such as network gateway and proxy server 
settings, that may be required for your devices to perform as expected in the environment 
in which they are installed. Finally, in addition to messaging, we will explore the process 
and confi guration of common push notifi cation services and network operations center 
(NOC) options.
Maintaining Awareness of Mobile 
Technology Advancements
Technology changes rapidly, which can have an impact on the enterprise deployment of the 
mobile devices used within your network. As telecommunications technology and computer 
networking technology have advanced over the past few decades, so has the distinction 
between the two. Not too long ago a telecommunications technician would be responsible 
for technology within the radio and the telephone industries. A computer 
network engineer’s responsibility would be more along the lines of working with the com-
puter network infrastructure, including LANs, WANs, and the associated network devices. 
The two teams were generally separate. The boundary between computer and mobile technology
has changed as the technologies have evolved. Telecommunication and networking 
equipment manufacturers that were once separate entities now have crossed over into each 
other’s sectors. It is not uncommon for engineers and technicians to design, deploy, and 
support telephone, voice, video, and computer networking technology. This is becoming 
more commonplace with the increase of smartphones and other mobile devices that support 
voice and data technologies. 

Maintaining Awareness of Mobile Technology Advancements

Faster, more-intelligent devices will require a stronger and more robust network 
infrastructure that will be able to support the advanced features and capabilities of these 
newer devices. The following items should be considered when it comes to mobile device 
technology advancements: 
 
■
Mobile device hardware advancements
 
■
mobile operating system(s)

New security risks and threat awareness
Mobile Device Hardware Advancements
As computing technology in general continues to advance, the mobile device hardware 
we use also evolves. This includes smaller notebook computers, smartphones, tablets, and 
other devices that are used to connect to a network of some sort and to the Internet. In 
addition to becoming more powerful, these devices are becoming more compact and much 
more affordable. With physical QWERTY keyboards, touch screens, styluses, and voice 
recognition software, the capabilities are astounding. Mobile devices are equipped with 
an operating system and allow the installation of applications (apps) with more and more 
features and are becoming self-contained computing and voice devices. Features such as 
cameras, music players, streaming video, live television, Global Positioning System (GPS) 
technology, mapping applications, location services, games, calendar services, social media, 
and Internet web access are common in many mobile devices. Using these devices for 
advanced cellular voice communications such as next-generation LTE, social media, and 
online meetings must also be considered as the technology evolves.
Mobile Operating Systems
Mobile device hardware advancements usually go hand in hand with software advance-
ments, including advancements to the operating system that are required to control the 
device. The mobile operating system(s) is what allows the keyboard, physical screen, stor-
age, wireless networks, and other physical components to operate with the graphical user 
interface and the installed applications. Common mobile operating system(s) include Apple 
iOS, Android, BlackBerry, and Windows Phone. These were explained earlier in Chapter 
10, “Introduction to Mobile Device Management.” Keeping the mobile operating system(s) 
up-to-date will allow for fi xes or patches to be installed, security updates to be enabled, 
and sometimes new features for the user to be added. In some cases, advancements with 
the physical hardware will also require the operating system to be updated in order to 
 effectively utilize the new hardware to its fullest potential.
Third-Party Mobile Application Vendors
Mobile apps are programs that run on a mobile device and allow the user to perform a vari-
ety of tasks that relate to Internet access, web browsing, email, personal calendars, music, 
games, and more. Mobile operating system(s) apps may be produced by the same large 

534 
Chapter 14 ■ Mobile Device Technology
companies that create software programs used on their larger counterparts (desktop and 
notebook computers), or apps may be created by third-party companies or even individuals. 
As you saw in Chapter 10, apps are typically available from two different online store 
types, the enterprise application store or consumer application store. These online stores 
will allow an individual to download apps for business-related activities or for personal 
use. Some apps are fee based, while others are available for free. The big players in the 
mobile app store marketplace are Google Play (for Android devices), the Apple App Store 
(for iOS devices), and BlackBerry World (for BlackBerry devices). There are other online 
app stores available. Some may consider this store type to be a third-party mobile applica-
tion store. One example is the Amazon Appstore for Android available at www.amazon.com. 
Using these stores or installing third-party apps may require changes to settings and 
confi guration parameters. This can include enabling permissions to the hardware itself. 
Figure 14.1 shows specifi c permissions that were required for an app to be installed on an 
Android device.
F I G U R E 14 .1  Settings for an app on an Android device requiring specific permissions
Notice in Figure 14.1 that the app will be able to access the device’s storage and have 
access to full network communications, phone calls, and system tools. There may be some 
risks associated with installing third-party apps from online stores that may not be well 
known, including malware, viruses, and other common security risks. You should there-
fore be cautious about what you download and any confi guration changes that may be 
necessary to install and use a mobile app. In most cases, after the app is installed, you can 
reverse any confi guration changes that may have been made but are not necessary for the 
app to operate as intended.

In-House Application Requirements 
535
New Security Risks and Threat Awareness
Unfortunately, like other types of technology, mobile devices have their share of security 
risks and threats. These include viruses, Trojans, spyware, and just malware in general. 
Keeping your devices up-to-date with the most current software protection is critical. 
Performing tasks on your devices that involve access to personal information, such as 
online banking with the ability to make payments, transfer money, and even scan and 
deposit checks, can lead to catastrophic results in the event that personal information is 
compromised. Subscribing to online forums, newsletters, and email services from software 
providers will help you stay in touch so you are aware of the latest security threats and can 
prevent security-related issues. Technology viruses, Trojans, spyware, and other issues 
related to device security are discussed further in Chapter 15, “Mobile Device Security 
Threats and Risks,” and Chapter 17, “Security Requirements, Monitoring, and Reporting.”
Configuration of Mobile Applications 
and Associated Technologies
There are many mobile device apps that require the user to change or enable settings on 
the device during the installation process. In some cases these changes are necessary for the 
app to function as intended, and in other cases the changes aren’t required but are needed 
due to lack of quality application development and programming. When a user understands 
the changes that are required for an app to be successfully installed, there’s a better chance 
they can ensure that the app will not impact the performance of the device or create any 
potential security issues. It is best for a user to read all dialog boxes and messages that 
may appear during the application installation process. If some features or settings have 
been changed and are not necessary, it is important for the user of the device to reverse any 
unnecessary changes to ensure the overall integrity of the device and its operation.
In-House Application Requirements
As mobile device technology continues to develop, so does the need for specifi c app types. 
In Chapter 10 we took a look at the two different application store models: the enterprise 
app store and the consumer app store. The enterprise app store is one that is managed and 
controlled by the organization that hosts the online app website. On the other hand, the 
consumer app store is one that is publicly accessible to anyone who has access to a device 
and an active Internet connection. 
Both store models can provide many different apps that fall under a variety of different 
categories. In addition to standard apps, many organizations require apps that are 
custom or purpose built to serve a specifi c function for their business model. In cases such 

536 
Chapter 14 ■ Mobile Device Technology
as this, there may be specifi c requirements that must be met for the deployment of the app 
to be successful. The enterprise app store would be the best method for distribution of the 
in-house developed application. Understanding these app requirements will provide the 
best possible user experience. When you are considering the requirements, you should 
keep the following in mind:
 
■
Application (app) publishing
 
■
Mobile device platforms
 
■
Device digital certificates
Application (App) Publishing
Generally, developers can publish apps to an online app store such as Google Play or the 
Apple App Store. In-house and custom apps that are developed by an organization can 
be published to an enterprise app store that is run by the company. This makes the most 
sense because such apps are usually not available for public use and are instead meant for a 
company-specifi c purpose. 
Prior to publishing any app, it is important to verify that the app works correctly and 
does not contain any programming fl aws or errors. This can be done by choosing a select 
group of individuals to test the app before it is published and launched. 
The Android developer website provides a launch checklist you can refer to before an 
app is published. The following are some highlights from the checklist you can use to make 
sure everything is covered for publishing and launching an app used with mobile devices.
 
■
Understand the publishing process.
 
■
Read and understand the store’s policies and agreements.
 
■
Validate the app for quality assurance.
 
■
Confirm the app’s total size.
 
■
Confirm compatibility with the device platform and the screen ranges.
 
■
Prepare for promotion of the app.
 
■
Upload the app to the online store.
 
■
Perform the trial or beta release of the app.
 
■
List the app in the online store.
 
■
Finalize and launch the app.
 
■
Provide product support for the app.
Keep in mind that this is not a complete list and consists of only key parts of the publishing 
process. This process can be applicable to both commercially available apps and in-house or 
custom-created apps not readily available to the general public. Some such apps in an enterprise 
app store may be available only to the organization for which it was created. Organizations can 
subscribe to developer services that provide the tools and resources needed to develop apps on 
certain mobile operating system(s). One such service is the iOS Developer Enterprise Program.

Mobile Application Types 
537
Mobile Device Platforms
With the number of diverse mobile client devices that are available for use in the 
workplace, understanding device platform support is an important component of a 
successful app development and deployment. There are three different app types that 
can be created: the native app, the web app, and the hybrid app. Some app types are 
platform dependent, and the type used will depend on the environment in which the app 
is deployed. These app types each have their own advantages and disadvantages and are 
discussed later in this chapter. 
If an organization allows employees to use their own devices on the corporate network, 
this creates challenges for in-house app development and deployment. This is mostly 
because of the diversity of platforms that are available. In such instances, an app needs to 
be developed to work on multiple platforms or to be platform independent. The number 
and types of devices that will be used on the network must be considered with application 
development and publishing.
Device Digital Certificates
Using digital certifi cates is the most secure method available to confi rm a user identity. 
With the continued increase of mobile device technology within the networking 
environment, use of digital certifi cates is becoming more commonplace for many 
different organization types. 
At one time, certifi cate management required a strong knowledge of a public key 
infrastructure (PKI) technology, extra management overhead, and more complex network 
administration. Certifi cate-based implementations were more common in areas that 
required higher-than-average security. Now, the concept of using digital certifi cates is much 
more widely accepted, mostly because technology advancements have made the certifi cate 
management process easier to design, deploy, and support. You will see more about PKI in 
Chapter 16, “Device Authentication and Data Encryption.” 
Certifi cates are also used with some push notifi cations technologies such as Apple Push 
Notifi cation Service (APNS). With this service, an encrypted Transport Layer Security 
(TLS) session is established between the mobile device and the APNS using certifi cate 
technology. You will see more about confi guring APNS later in this chapter.
Mobile Application Types
Mobile apps fall into three different categories: native apps, web apps, and hybrid apps. 
Each app type has a unique set of advantages and disadvantages, and their use will depend 
on several factors. These factors include the device platform, the mobile operating system(s) 
in use, the cost, the purpose, and the amount of time available to the developer. The mobile 
device types that will be used and the mobile operating system(s) will have an impact on the 
app type that will be implemented.

538 
Chapter 14 ■ Mobile Device Technology
Native Apps
Native apps built into the device or installed to the device from Google Play, Apple’s 
App Store, BlackBerry’s App World, or a similar app store. The native app is developed 
specifi cally for the device platform in which it operates on, such as Android, Apple iOS, 
BlackBerry, and others. Because there is a program installed on the actual device, some of 
the processing takes place locally, which will help with the overall 
performance of the app. The native app has its share of advantages and disadvantages:
 
■
Advantages of native apps
 
■
Good performance
 
■
Active Internet connection not required for use
 
■
Widely available through public consumer app stores
 
■
Disadvantages of native apps
 
■
Platform dependent
 
■
Must be installed on the device
 
■
Need to be updated when changed
Web Apps
As the name implies, a web app is one that is available over an Internet connection using 
a web browser that is installed on the mobile device. The browser acts as the interface 
between the mobile device and the app code located on a web server. This app type is not 
necessarily an app; it can be a website that the mobile device is accessing. The driving 
force behind mobile web apps is HTML5, which allows the app to run within a standard 
Internet browser. The web app has unique advantages and disadvantages:
 
■
Advantages of web apps
 
■
Web browser based and platform independent
 
■
Very limited or no client-side updates
 
■
Centralized web-side updates
 
■
Disadvantages of web apps
 
■
An active Internet connection is required
 
■
They affect performance due to no client-side software footprint installed on the 
device
 
■
HTML5 integration may cause some known issues
Hybrid Apps
In any sense of the word, hybrid means a combination of items. A hybrid vehicle is one 
that will work with more than one type of energy source, such as gas and electric. With 

Configuring Messaging Protocols and Applications 
539
regard to mobile app technology, a hybrid app is a combination of a native app and a web 
app, containing parts or functionality of both. A benefi t to hybrid apps is that they can be 
designed to be platform independent. Here are some of the advantages and disadvantages of 
the hybrid app:
 
■
Advantages of hybrid apps
 
■
Can be built quicker than native apps with less client-side coding
 
■
More functionality than web apps but may have some of the same benefits
 
■
Can be made available from app stores
 
■
Disadvantages of hybrid apps
 
■
May lack some of the native or web app functionality
 
■
Performance is somewhere between that of web apps and native apps, and it may 
not be as good as native app performance.
Configuring Messaging Protocols and 
Applications
There are many options available when it comes to confi guring your device for messaging 
services, regardless of whether it is a mobile device such as a smartphone or a tablet or 
notebook computer. In Chapter 2, “Common Network Protocols and Ports,” we explored 
several of the networking protocols that are used for messaging:
 
■
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
 
■
Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)
 
■
Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3)
 
■
Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI)
In Chapter 2, you learned that SMTP, which uses port 25, is used to send email 
messages from client device to server and to send and receive email messages between 
email servers. This is one of the most popular Internet protocols in use today. IMAP, 
which uses port 143, allows a client device to access email that is stored on a remote 
email server. Keep in mind that IMAP over SSL (IMAPS) uses port 993. The messages 
are not downloaded locally to the client device’s email software program. Instead, the 
email remains on the email server for retrieval from any device with an Internet 
connection and the proper credentials to authenticate to the email server. POP3, which 
uses port 110, is used by client devices to retrieve email from a remote email server. For 
secure sessions, you can use POP3 over SSL (POP3S), which uses TCP port 995. Currently, 
though, support for this port from Internet Service Providers is unlikely. When a user 
connects to their email server using POP3, the messages are downloaded to the local client 
device. The MAPI protocol, which uses port 135, is a proprietary protocol that was created 

540 
Chapter 14 ■ Mobile Device Technology
by Microsoft. If you are using Microsoft’s Outlook email client, you can use the MAPI 
protocol to connect to Microsoft Exchange email servers. In the following sections, we will 
explore how to confi gure these commonly used protocols and applications for designed for 
electronic messaging.
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is a messaging protocol that serves two purposes. 
It can be used for client-device-to-server email delivery and for server-to-server email delivery. 
SMTP communicates using TCP/IP and is the most common messaging protocol used to 
send messages from a client device to an email server. Other messaging protocols, such 
as POP3 and IMAP, are used to receive email messages from an email server. Figure 14.2 
illustrates the mail delivery process using SMTP.

Confi guring your device to use SMTP is straightforward. It is a common confi guration 
parameter set within the email client software and is used to access the email server to in turn 
access the email database. When you confi gure email client software, you will need to know 
several parameters, including the login username and password, the outgoing and incoming 
mail server names or IP addresses, and the protocols and port numbers used. In the case of 
SMTP, this would be the outgoing mail server, which uses port 25 by default. Figure 14.3 
shows an example of an email client confi guration screen for the Android operating system.

541
F I G U R E  14 . 3   Android email app outgoing mail server settings
Notice in Figure 14.3 that the port for SMTP is 465 and not 25. This is because this 
specifi c application is using SMTP over Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), or SMTPS, which uses 
port 465.
Configuring Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)
Confi guring your client device for IMAP is also a straightforward process. One 
main benefi t to using this protocol to access email is that the messages are not down-
loaded locally to a device and they remain on the email server until the user deletes 
them. The messages may be cached temporarily on the local client device while the 
email program is in use. This allows a user to retrieve email from any device with an 
Internet connection and the proper credentials to authenticate to and synchronize the 
messages with the email server. Here are some of the advantages and disadvantages 
of using IMAP:
 
■
Advantages of IMAP
 
■
Email client software does not need to be installed on the local device.
 
■
Email can be accessed from any device with an active Internet connection.
 
■
Because the email messages are stored on a server and not locally, they will still be 
available in the event of a device failure.

542 
Chapter 14 ■ Mobile Device Technology
 
■
Email stored on the server will be scanned for computer viruses, which lessens the 
chance of infecting the local device. 
 
■
If you change devices, you don’t need to transfer the email messages to the new device.
 
■
Disadvantages of IMAP 
 
■
An active Internet connection is required for users to read, create, and send email 
messages.
 
■
Because the email is created and read online, it uses data from a data plan if the 
user is on a cellular network connection.
 
■
Not all devices or operating systems support IMAP.
 
■
It can potentially be slow, depending on the Internet connection speed.
 
■
There may be limited storage space on the hosting email server.
In Exercise 14.1, you will confi gure an email account on an Android device to use 
IMAP.

Chapter 14 ■ Mobile Device Technology
Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3)
POP3 will allow a user to use an email software program to access an email server and 
download messages. The user will then have access to the email messages that are stored 
on the local device. This is a message-retrieval protocol that is quite common and popular 
because the user is not required to have Internet access to read and create email messages, 
so the user can work with the email in an offl ine state. Here are some of the advantages and 
disadvantages of using POP3:
 
■
Advantages of POP3 
 
■
Many software programs that support POP3 are available.
 
■
An active Internet connection is not required to access email that is stored on your 
device.
 
■
A connection to the Internet is required only to download messages and to send 
messages that are queued within the software program.
 
■
Large attachment files can be accessed quickly because they are stored locally.
 
■
Disadvantages of POP3
 
■
Email messages that include attachments are downloaded locally and can use up 
hard drive space unless properly maintained. 
 
■
Downloaded attachments may contain viruses, causing problems on a system that 
is not properly protected.
 
■
Email can be lost if a device fails and data is not properly backed up.
 
■
If someone else has access to your device, they may be able to read your email data.
 
■
If POP3 is not used with a virtual private network (VPN), SSL, or other secure 
Internet connection, all user information, including username, password, and 
server configuration, may be seen by hackers on a wireless network.
Email client device software programs that use POP3 can be confi gured to automatically 
check the server at specifi ed intervals. This will allow the client to download the email to 
the local device.
Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI)
For users of Microsoft Exchange email services and the Microsoft Outlook client soft-
ware, MAPI is a great solution. Outlook will run on a variety of device types and mobile 
 operating system(s) systems. Other third-party email client software programs may provide 
support for MAPI. As a proprietary protocol that was developed by Microsoft, it has its 
share advantages and disadvantages: 
 
■
Advantages of MAPI
 
■
Fast and efficient
 
■
Easy to configure on the client side

It is important to note that there are many web-based email programs that 
use Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) via a web browser. Many of these 
email services allow the user to configure their email to be delivered or 
viewed using protocols such as POP3 and IMAP. HTTP is an application 
layer protocol that provides a graphical user interface to the end user and is 
not considered a messaging protocol. Configuration of the messaging pro-
tocols used with this type of email will vary based on the service provider. 
Configuring Network Gateway and 
Proxy Server Settings
In Chapter 6, “Computer Network Infrastructure Devices,” we explored the functionality 
and features of various infrastructure devices for wired and wireless networking, which 
included network gateways and proxy servers. In the following sections, you will learn how 
to confi gure settings for both network gateways and proxy servers.
Configuring Network Gateway Settings
The term network gateway can be interpreted in different ways, often depending on the con-
text in which it is used. A network gateway is an interface that allows computer networks 
using different protocol sets to connect together and share information. In some cases it is 
simply the IP address of the router port that allows your device to access resources outside 
of the LAN you are connected to. In the context of this section, the network gateway is the 
point that allows your mobile device to connect to external resources outside of the local 
area. If your device is using Dynamic Host Confi guration Protocol (DHCP), which enables 
the device to receive IP settings automatically, there is no confi guration because it is pro-
vided as part of the IP settings issued by the DHCP server. If for some reason the device is 
not using DHCP and static IP settings are required, the gateway will need to be manually 
entered.

548 
Chapter 14 ■ Mobile Device Technology
F I G U R E 14 . 4  Microsoft Windows computer default gateway settings entered

Figure 14.4 shows where the default gateway settings are entered manually in the 
Microsoft Windows operating system. The same concept holds true with devices such as 
smartphones and tablets. If DHCP is used, the gateway settings are automatically provided 
by the DHCP server. If static IP settings are used, the gateway address will need to be 
entered manually. The following steps show the process of manually entering the default 
gateway information into an Android client device:
1. 
Tap the applications menu icon to show the Apps and Widgets screen.
2.

Configuring Proxy Server Settings
A proxy server can be either a hardware appliance or software server solution. It is the 
“middleman” between a device on a private network and a destination server across 
another network, which can be a WAN connection or the Internet. A proxy server provides 
features such as web page caching, content fi ltering, and more. If a proxy server is used 
to gain access to the Internet, the client devices, computers, smartphones, and tablets will

Push Notification Technology
Push notifi cation technology will allow an application to provide an announcement of 
some type to alert a user of events and messages that have been received by a device. These 
notifi cations can be delivered to the device through an app that is not even active at the 
time the alert is delivered. In Chapter 2, we explored some of the protocols and ports 
that are used with messaging and notifi cation services. Here you will see an overview 
of the confi guration of two of the most common notifi cation technologies, Apple Push 
Notifi cation Service (APNS) and Google Cloud Messaging (GSM). The device type and the 
mobile operating system(s) in use will determine how the notifi cations are delivered to the 
device for the user. For example, with Android devices, the application’s icon and a message 
will appear in the status bar, providing an alert to the user. Apple iOS devices can alert the 
user with sounds and using other graphical methods.
Configuring Apple Push Notification Service (APNS)
Apple Push Notifi cation Service (APNS) is used to enroll an Apple iOS device within a 
mobile device management (MDM) solution. APNS uses a native push notifi cation tech-
nology that is available for Apple iOS devices and allows the iPad, iPhone, and other 
devices to receive information even when the destination app is not open or running. 
The iOS notifi cations include sounds, graphical alerts/banners, and badges. Confi guring 
notifi cations on an iOS device is straightforward, and each app will need to be confi gured 
independently. 
Exercise 14.2 shows you how to confi gure APNS on an Apple iPhone.

Chapter 14 ■ Mobile Device Technology
Keep in mind that a valid encrypted IP session is established between the mobile device 
and APNS. The device will receive all notifi cations over the encrypted TLS communica-
tions tunnel that was created. The device must obtain a token that contains the required 
information that will allow the notifi cation service to locate the device where the app is 
installed and deliver the alert.
Google Cloud Messaging (GCM)
Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) allows for data to be sent from a server to Android-based 
devices, and also to receive messages from devices that are on the same connection. Like 
the APNS for iOS devices, GCM provides a push notifi cation service for Android devices. 
One benefi t to a push notifi cation service is that it will lessen the amount of network band-
width used because the device will receive information that is pushed, therefore, it will not 
have to poll a server for any of that type of data. The following steps show the process of 
enabling or disabling notifi cations on an Android client device:
1. 
Tap the applications menu icon to show the Apps and Widgets screen.
2. 
Tap the Settings icon.

If the check box is selected, the device will receive notifi cations for the selected app. If 
it is not selected, the device will not receive notifi cations for the selected app. Figure 14.7

The preceding steps show only one way to change the notifi cation settings on an 
Android device. Depending on the version of the mobile operating system(s) used, other 
methods may be available.
Information Traffic Topology
The network operations center (NOC) is where a computer network is managed, 
controlled, and monitored. Networks of all sizes will contain some sort of operations 
center, and they will vary in design, size, and complexity. The NOC engineer’s 
responsibilities include infrastructure and device monitoring, handling reported inci-
dents, and notifying the appropriate person or department when problems arise. NOC 
engineers will be able to accommodate necessary changes to help ensure 
overall network health, maintain security compliance, and verify that the network 
meets the organization’s requirements. 
Many NOCs operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and 365 days a year. An NOC 
may have support personnel organized into groups with varying levels of knowledge 
and hours of operations, which can have an effect on the overall costs. For this reason 
and depending on the size of the network, in some cases it may be more cost effective 
to outsource this responsibility. Rather than managing their own network, some 
organizations now use a managed service provider (MSP) to handle the responsibilities 
of the network. 
Basically, there are three different NOC types:
 
■
On-premise network operations center
 
■
Third-party network operations center
 
■
Hosted network operations center
On-Premise Network Operations Center
The on-premise network operations center model is the traditional type of NOC. 
This model has been around for decades and is a common implementation in organi-
zations from all types of businesses. With an on-premise NOC, the organization is 
responsible for all aspects and day-to-day responsibilities of managing and supporting 
the network infrastructure. In most cases, this will require 24/7 support and main-
tenance 365 days a year. Depending on the size of the organization and network, 
this model can be a costly endeavor. It will be up to the organization to supply the 
manpower, hardware, software, and other necessary resources. Although it is 
beneficial to have all network operations handled in-house, in some cases this model 
may be cost prohibitive; therefore, the task may be outsourced to a third-party 
organization.

556 
Chapter 14 ■ Mobile Device Technology
Third-Party Network Operations Center
The third-party network operations center is becoming a more common scenario for many 
organizations. In this model, network operations are completely outsourced to an outside 
independent company that specializes in the process. In some cases, the organization that is 
outsourcing the NOC will still provide the facilities and equipment, but the manpower is 
provided by a different company. In other cases, the entire process is handled by the third-party 
NOC. This managed services model can provide a substantial cost savings to an organization 
because the around-the-clock responsibilities of dealing with a NOC are minimized. Some 
organizations choose a third-party solution so they can get on with their business and not 
have the burden of directly managing the technology. 
Hosted Network Operations Center
Some organizations choose to have some or all of their day-to-day network operations 
hosted by what would be the equivalent of a cloud-based service provider. This solution 
will allow a company to offl oad some or all of the network operations, such as web services 
and application and data servers, to an offsite provider. The hosting service provider will 
be able to provide uninterruptible power supply (UPS) services, allowing for generators and 
battery backup power sources to supply the required power and the necessary actions in the 
event of a power outage. Also, network monitoring tasks will be handled by a staff trained 
to respond to issues that may have an impact on the performance of the network. Hosted 
network operations providers can usually provide a guaranteed amount of bandwidth and 
the ability to dynamically allow additional bandwidth. Finally, the offsite responsibility of 
data backup, storage, and restore will relieve the organization of the burden to maintain its 
data integrity.
Summary
In this chapter you learned about the importance of being aware of mobile device technol-
ogy advancements, including those that are related to device hardware and the mobile oper-
ating system(s). We also explored the concept of third-party application vendors for online 
app stores and the potential risks and threats from changes to apps and from technology 
advancements. I explained the three different app types: native apps, web apps, and hybrid 
apps. You also saw the advantages and disadvantages of each app type. You were given the 
opportunity to see how to confi gure various messaging protocols on different platforms, 
including Android and Apple iOS devices. We also explored the confi guration of specifi c 
network parameters, such as network gateway and proxy server settings that may require 
manual confi guration, including where they are located within mobile operating system(s). 
Finally, we took a quick survey of two popular push notifi cation services and explored the 
concept of different network operations center (NOC) options.

Understand the importance of maintaining awareness of advancements in mobile 
technology.  Staying informed of technology updates and enhancements will help to 
provide a quality user experience. Changes to device hardware, mobile operating system(s), 
and third-party apps can have an adverse effect on a deployment, as can new risks and 
threats. One of the best ways to stay informed is to stay in touch with hardware and 
software vendors by connecting with them through email updates and social media outlets.
Be familiar with in-house application requirements.  Some organizations use apps that are 
custom or purpose built to serve a specifi c function for their business model. These apps are 
best acquired and deployed from an enterprise app store rather than a consumer or publicly 
available app store.
Understand the different app types.  Know the advantages and disadvantages of the 
different available app types, which include native apps, web apps, and hybrid apps. 
Understand that native apps offer good performance but are platform dependent. Web apps 
are platform independent but require an active Internet connection. Hybrid apps can be 
built more quickly than native apps but may lack some common functionality.
Be familiar with the configuration of some specific messaging protocols.  Understand how 
to confi gure various messaging protocols, such as SMTP, IMAP, POP3, and MAPI. The 
confi guration process will vary based on the device hardware type and the operating system 
that is used. If IMAP is used, messages stay on the email server and any work done while not 
actively connected to the Internet will require synchronization when a connection becomes 
available. Conversely, using POP3 will allow email messages to be downloaded to the client 
device, and email can be read and created while offl ine.
Understand the configuration of additional network settings such as those for gateway and 
proxy servers.  In some cases, you may need to manually confi gure network settings such 
as network gateway and proxy server parameters. Although these settings can be delivered 
automatically, it is benefi cial to understand the manual confi guration process.
Be familiar with push notification services.   Understand how common push notifi cation 
services such as Apple Push Notifi cation Service (APNS) and Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) 
operate. Know how to enable and disable push notifi cation services on Android and iOS devices.

TOPICS COVERED IN THIS CHAPTER:
 
✓Understanding Risks with Wireless Technologies 
 
✓Understanding Risks Associated with Software
 
✓Understanding Risks with Mobile Device Hardware
 
✓Understanding Risks Affecting Organizations

Mobile devices have their share of risks and threats associated 
with the technology. The risks can be with wireless (radio 
 frequency) technology, software, hardware, and within the 
organization itself. This chapter will explore some of the threats that fall under each of 
these risk categories. Keep in mind that many of the threats discussed here are not limited 
to wireless technology; they are threats that you may already be familiar with from other 
networking technologies. Because public Wi-Fi hotspots are easily accessible to virtually any-
body, they can be a target for various types of intrusion attacks. Rogue access points (APs) 
are also wireless threats because they can result in security breaches within the organization. 
These and other wireless concerns will be discussed. You may already be familiar with risks 
associated with software, which includes threats such as malware, viruses, and spyware. 
These are also a concern with mobile device technology. In addition to software, hardware 
risks such as lost or stolen devices are a concern. In this chapter, we will explore different 
software and hardware risks and the risks that have an effect on organizations in general.
Understanding Risks with Wireless 
Technologies
In previous chapters you learned that wireless technology uses an unbounded medium 
(the air) for communications. That fact itself makes this type of communication fall into 
a high-risk category and therefore be vulnerable to various types of intrusion attacks. 
Understanding these risks is essential to provide an adequate security solution for wire-
less communications. Here are some common risks associated with wireless technology in 
general:
 
■
Public Wi-Fi hotspots
 
■
Rogue access points
 
■
Denial of service attacks
 
■
Radio frequency jamming
 
■
Cell tower spoofing
 
■
Wireless hijack attacks
 
■
Wireless man-in-the-middle attacks
 
■
Weak security keys
 
■

Understanding Risks with Wireless Technologies

The following sections provide a basic understanding of these risks and how they may be 
implemented. Figure 15.1 shows some of the risks associated with wireless technology.
F I G U R E 15 .1  Wireless-enabled devices are subject to many potential security threats.
Public Wi-Fi Hotspots
Anytime you access a wireless network from a public Wi-Fi hotspot, extra care must 
be taken to ensure a secure connection. Many public guest networks require the user to 
authenticate through a captive web portal. A captive web portal will intercept a user’s 
attempt to access the network by redirecting them to a web page for authorization of some 
sort. This web page may request account credentials, payment information from a user, or 
a simple agreement to terms and conditions before granting access to the wireless network. 
Some assume that because they were required to “authenticate,” the wireless connection 
will be secure; however, this is not the case. Once the captive web portal authentication 
has completed, all communications will be in clear-text unless other security measures 
are implemented by the user, such as using secure protocols such as Hypertext Transfer 
Protocol with Secure Sockets Layer (HTTPS) to create a secure connection or connecting 
through a virtual private network (VPN). Many people do not realize that a captive web 
portal is used only to restrict access to the wireless network and does not provide any addi-
tional encryption or security. In addition to ensuring a secure connection, additional pre-
cautions should be in place, including but not limited to the following: 
 
■
Secure personal firewall
 
■
Current antivirus software
 
■
Client-side software/agents
Rogue Access Points
In order for IEEE 802.11 wireless client devices to connect to an infrastructure network, 
they must connect to a wireless access point (AP). The AP will act as a portal for the

Chapter 15 ■ Mobile Device Security Threats and Risks 
devices using IEEE 802.11 wireless technology to connect to IEEE 802.3 wired technology 
(Ethernet). We explored this and other AP fundamentals in Chapter 5, “IEEE 802.11 
Terminology and Technology.”
It is important to understand that an AP to which you are connecting may not necessar-
ily be what is considered an authorized AP. Connecting to an unauthorized AP comes with 
its share of risks, including various types of wireless intrusion attacks. The term rogue AP 
does not necessarily mean that the AP is a specifi c threat, but it very well could be depend-
ing on the specifi c situation in which it is placed. With respect to wireless security, typically 
the term rogue means that the AP is not an authorized AP and has the potential to be a 
threat. One example is when an employee of a company brings a personal wireless AP from 
home for use in their offi ce and connects it to the corporate LAN. The user unknowingly 
has connected an unauthorized device that is not managed by the corporate IT staff, and 
the device is now considered a threat to the corporate network. This would fall under the 
unintentional rogue AP category. Although the employee meant no harm, it could compro-
mise the security of the entire corporate LAN. Conversely, when someone knowingly con-
nects an unauthorized AP to a corporate network for malicious intent, it would fall under 
the category of an intentional rogue AP.
Proper monitoring of the network for rogue devices can be a time-consuming task, but it 
must be considered as part of the corporate security policy. A couple of particular concerns 
to watch for are ad hoc networks and mobile wireless hotspots. If these are not allowed by 
corporate security policy and properly secured, they could be considered rogue AP and a 
security threat to the organization.
Ad Hoc Wireless Networks  The ad hoc, independent basic service set (IBSS) and peer-
to-peer networks can also be considered threats and may fall under the category of an AP 
point. The IBSS network explained in Chapter 5 is typically noncompliant against most 
corporate security policies. One reason is that if a network of this type is connected to a 
corporate LAN, it basically becomes a rogue AP. The ad hoc network is an independent 
unmanaged network that can pose a serious threat to a corporate LAN. 
Mobile Wireless Hotspots  Many mobile devices such as portable wireless hotspots and 
smartphones have the capability to become a “wireless hotspot.” Although these devices 
are not physically connected to a corporate network, they can also potentially become 
a threat to corporate security. This is because a user connected wirelessly to a device of 
this nature may inadvertently send a company’s private information over a network that 
is not managed by the enterprise network staff, thereby compromising corporate security. 
Although most of these devices have the capability to be secured, there is no telling whether 
they are secured or the extent to which they are secured.
Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks
A denial of service (DoS) can fall under two different categories, unintentional or inten-
tional. An intentional DoS is caused by a hacker or intruder implementing a  technology of 
some sort that will prevent authorized users from connecting to, accessing, or maintain-
ing a connection to their wireless network. With IEEE 802.11 networks, a DoS attack 

Understanding Risks with Wireless Technologies 
563
could be performed at the Physical layer (Layer 1) or the Data Link layer (Layer 2) of the 
Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. As shown in Figure 15.2, a Physical layer DoS 
attack typically entails the use of a  malicious radio frequency (RF) jamming device operat-
ing on the same RF channel as the wireless AP. This will prevent users from maintaining 
a connection to the AP, thereby  denying access to the network. Jamming is discussed in 
more detail in the next section of this chapter.
F I G U R E 15 . 2  The MetaGeek Chanalyzer spectrum analyzer shows an RF DoS attack 
using a narrow-band jamming device.
A Layer 2 DoS attack is more sophisticated, and adequate knowledge and the proper 
tools are required to perform this type of attack. With one type of Layer 2 DoS attack, 
the intruder will send either IEEE 802.11 deauthentication or disassociation frames that 
prevent an authorized device from maintaining a connection to the wireless network. 
These frames are sent by spoofi ng the Media Access Control (MAC) address of the wireless 
AP. The connected wireless devices do not realize that these are unauthorized frames and 
therefore will not be able to maintain a connection to the AP. Remember that both IEEE 
802.11 deauthentication and disassociation frames are notifi cations and not requests; 
therefore, they will not be refused by the client device.

564 
Chapter 15 ■ Mobile Device Security Threats and Risks 
Radio Frequency (RF) Jamming
Radio frequency (RF) jamming can be the result of either intentional or unintentional 
interference. Intentional jamming occurs when an illegal radio transmitter is operating on 
the same RF channel as an authorized transmitter, preventing the authorized legitimate 
transmission from occurring. With regard to IEEE 802.11 wireless networking, this is 
known as a Layer 1 DoS attack. 
Due to the unbounded nature of RF communications, there is no way to prevent this type of 
attack other than physical security. However, there are many tools available that will help you to 
locate the jamming device and therefore allow you to eliminate the source once it has been identi-
fi ed as a threat. One example is an RF spectrum analyzer with a directional antenna. This device 
will allow a network security specialist to track down the exact location of the jamming device 
and eliminate the threat. In IEEE 802.11 wireless networking, a wireless intrusion prevention sys-
tem (WIPS) is a software/hardware solution that monitors the radio waves and, using a wireless 
hardware sensor, can report captured information to software to be recorded in a server database. 
The WIPS solution will then be able to take the appropriate countermeasures to prevent wireless 
network intrusions. These countermeasures are based on identifying the intrusion by comparing 
the captured information to an intrusion signature database within the WIPS server. Figure 15.3 
shows a WIPS dashboard that displays a Layer 1 RF jamming DoS attack that was recorded.

attack that was reported.

Understanding Risks with Wireless Technologies 
565
Unintentional RF jamming is the result of devices that are operating in the same 
frequency space. Devices that can be the cause of this include microwave ovens, RF 
cameras, cordless phones, and others. Although these are not intended to be the cause 
of a jamming DoS, in some cases they will have the same overall effect. Identifying, 
locating, and removing these interference sources will help improve the performance of 
the wireless network. 
Cell Tower Spoofing
Cell tower spoofi ng is a newer form of mobile device wireless hacking, intrusion, and 
eavesdropping. Smartphones and mobile devices of all types may be vulnerable to cell tower 
spoofi ng. With the proper hardware and software, someone can transmit what appears to 
be a legitimate cellular signal and, acting as a provider or carrier, force the unsuspecting 
user to connect to their device. Devices do not require two-way authentication, and from 
the mobile device perspective a smartphone does not realize the transmitting “station” is 
not provided by the wireless carrier to which it is subscribed.
Mobile devices that are cellular capable use what is known as an international 
mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) number to uniquely identify the device. Typically 
about 15 digits in length, this number allows mobile devices to interconnect with vari-
ous cellular networks. The IMSI may be embedded within the device itself or contained 
within the Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card. If the IMSI is contained within 
the SIM card, a user can move the card from one device to another and maintain the 
same identifi er.
An IMSI catcher is a system that is used to connect unsuspecting users to an 
imposter cell tower. Once the mobile device has connected to the “fake” tower, it has 
essentially become the victim of a man-in-the-middle attack. This would allow the 
operator of the IMSI catcher to eavesdrop on all transmissions between the user and 
the legitimate  provider’s network and potentially gain access to sensitive and personal 
information.
Wireless Hijack Attacks
A wireless hijack is caused by a hacker creating a situation that will allow or even force a 
wireless client device to connect to an unauthorized wireless AP or base station. Figure 15.4 
shows the steps a hacker could use to perform a hijack using an RF DoS attack. The hacker 
would set up a rogue software AP and then perform an RF DoS attack on the channel in 
use. This will cause the authorized users to seek another AP to connect to.
This is something that can go unrecognized by a user for some time, especially if the 
hacker then follows through with a wireless man-in-the-middle attack. The AP used by the 
hacker in this specifi c situation can be software based or hardware based. There are many 
ways that a wireless mobile device using Wi-Fi can be hijacked:
 
■
The client issues IEEE 802.11 probe request frames to connect to a  network that is set 
to automatic (normal behavior).

566 
Chapter 15 ■ Mobile Device Security Threats and Risks 
 
■
The hacker creates a DoS attack against the authorized AP. This will force the device 
to roam.
 
■
The hacker sends deauthentication frames to the wireless mobile device by spoofing the 
address of the authorized AP.
Any one (or any combination) of these methods will allow for a wireless client device to 
connect to a rogue AP and become a victim of a hijack situation.
Wireless Man-in-the-Middle Attacks
Once a device has been hijacked, the hacker can follow through with a wireless man-in-
the-middle attack. This type of attack will enable a hacker to provide an unsuspecting user 
with a connection to a legitimate corporate network or to the Internet. With the hijacked 
user connected to the rogue AP, the hacker will retransmit all data to the authorized 
AP so the hijacked user does not even realize there is a problem. This is accomplished by 
the hacker having a second wireless network adapter and connecting that adapter to the 
authorized AP. All information that the user sends to the authorized AP is captured by the 
hacker, potentially exposing personal or sensitive information. Figure 15.5 shows a graphi-
cal representation of a wireless hijack and wireless man-in-the-middle attack. After the 
hacker performs the wireless hijack and forces the authorized users to connect to the rogue 
software AP, they will retransmit to the real AP, exploiting all traffi c that is sent to the 
network.

Weak Security Keys
A key in any sense of the word is something that is used to gain access to a secured environ-
ment such as an automobile, home, or offi ce. With respect to technology, a key is used for 
cryptography purposes and may be used for authentication purposes or to gain access to 
encrypted information. Software programs that will allow a hacker to break methods that 
use weak keys are freely available on the Internet.
One example involves IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN technology that uses passphrases and 
pre-shared keys. A passphrase (basically a password) is entered into all devices participating 
in the secured wireless network connection. The IEEE 802.11 standard defi nes an algorithm 
that will create a 256-bit pre-shared key from the passphrase that was entered. This 
algorithm is published in the IEEE 802.11 standard, and freely available software programs 
exist that will allow a hacker to obtain a weak passphrase. This is done by capturing specifi c 
frames used during the authentication process. With the software and use of a dictionary fi le, 
a weak passphrase can be quickly determined. Once the passphrase is known, the hacker can 
enter the passphrase into a device and gain access to the network. In addition to network 
access, the experienced hacker will be able to re-create the encryption keys created on a per-
user basis and will be able to view their encrypted information.
Warpathing
Wireless warpathing is the process of seeking and discovering wireless networks. Wardriving 
is another term used to refer to the same process. In the early days of  wireless networking, this 
was considered a popular way to fi nd and document the locations of open wireless networks.

Chapter 15 ■ Mobile Device Security Threats and Risks 
These networks could then be used by the casual hacker to gain  personal information or just 
to provide a connection to the Internet. The wireless  discovery phase is the passive and active 
scanning processes you learned about in Chapter 5 that allow devices to locate wireless net-
works. This is a normal part of the wireless  network connection process and is used by all 
devices to gain access to a wireless  network. If a  wireless network is not secured, locating the 
unsecured network and  monitoring the information traversing the air to and from the wireless 
access is a major security issue. The bottom line is if a strong security mechanism is in place 
and used for wireless  network authentication and data encryption, then the fact that the net-
work can be seen or  discovered by the warpathing method is not really an issue.
Understanding Risks Associated with 
Software
All mobile devices and computers are vulnerable to a variety of risks that are associated with the 
operating system installed on the device or the programs or apps that are used. Awareness and 
understanding of these risks will help mobile device and computer users to be better prepared to 
provide the appropriate protection and mitigation of potential threats to their devices. It is best 
for users to have the appropriate software protection installed, such as fi rewall and antivirus 
programs, to help protect against and prevent any damage software threats might cause.
Protection against software threats such as computer viruses, malware, 
and spyware are discussed further in Chapter 17, “Security Requirements, 
Monitoring, and Reporting.” The intention of this chapter is to provide you 
with an understanding of the different potential software threats to com-
puters and mobile devices.
Malware
Technology devices are subject to many attacks in which software programs or applications 
designed for malicious intent are used. These programs are known as malware, which is an 
abbreviated term for malicious software. Malware is a general term used to describe a vari-
ety of different software-based threats:
 
■
Information technology viruses
 
■
Trojans
 
■
Computer worms
 
■
Spyware
 
■
Keylogging
Although this is not a complete list, these are some of the common software threats that you 
should be aware of in order to protect your technology devices and the data contained within.

Understanding Risks Associated with Software 
569
Information Technology Viruses
I like to refer to this threat as an information technology virus rather than a computer virus 
because viruses can affect many devices other than computers, including mobile devices 
such as tablets or smartphones. The Android operating system may be more vulnerable 
to viruses than its proprietary counterparts such as Apple iOS, BlackBerry, and Windows 
Phone. This is because the Android operating system is open source.
A virus can be any code that can have adverse effects on the device that it has 
infected. The effects of information technology viruses can range from being a minor 
inconvenience for users to being serious security breaches for a corporation. Some viruses 
are programmed to replicate and reproduce themselves to other devices they connect to 
and even across entire corporate networks and the Internet. This can result in wasted 
time for the information technology staff as well as the users of the infected devices.
Jailbreaking and rooting a mobile device, both explained later in this chapter, may make 
a device more susceptible to viruses and other technology threats.
Trojans
A Trojan, also known as a Trojan horse, is a type of a technology virus, usually in the form 
of an executable program that is designed to perform malicious tasks. These will often cre-
ate a “back door” to the operating system that is installed on the device, allowing for unau-
thorized access to the device and the data it contains. Trojans don’t infect only computers. 
Mobile devices like smartphones and tablets are also vulnerable to these types of attacks. 
Trojans are sometimes programmed to perform the following:
 
■
Modify or delete data
 
■
Steal personal information such as passwords
 
■
Steal money electronically through transfers
 
■
Control cameras installed on the device
 
■
Install software such as keyloggers
This list is just a small sample of the types of security issues a Trojan can cause.
Computer Worms
A computer worm is a malicious software program that is designed to replicate and 
spread to other devices. A computer worm can be spread from data that is transferred 
 manually (such as on a removable disk drive) or from the connection to a computer 
 network. Some worms are designed to be a nuisance and cause a slowdown on the net-
work by increasing network traffi c and utilizing the bandwidth, while others can create 
more serious security issues.
Spyware
Spyware consists of computer programs that are used to gather information about the 
device and the information (data) that is stored on the device. This type of program is 
installed without the user’s knowledge or consent and can cause a variety of privacy- and 

570 
Chapter 15 ■ Mobile Device Security Threats and Risks 
security-related issues. In many cases, spyware programs are installed as a result of the 
user clicking a hyperlink contained within a web page, causing embedded code to run 
and install the unwanted software. Spyware can report back to other servers and provide 
specifi c information regarding the infected device’s use. For example, spyware can pro-
vide information on websites the user visits and online shopping habits. Spyware can also 
include software programs that are manually installed on a smartphone or other mobile 
device and used to monitor, track, and log everything the user does. 
Keylogging
Keylogging is a method by which someone with the use of software can “record” key-
strokes that are executed on computers and mobile devices. This is usually done unbe-
knownst to the user. The data that is collected from the keylogging process can then be 
viewed, possibly exposing sensitive information. This can lead to serious security issues 
such as stealing from bank accounts, sending fraudulent information to unsuspecting users, 
and even identity theft.
Mobile App Store Usage
When you download and install a mobile application from an online store, you may be 
authorizing the use of certain services regardless of whether the app requires them. These 
services often include contacts, email, and location services, among others. Therefore, the 
apps may be somewhat of a security threat and present privacy concerns. If the devices are 
allowed to be used on a corporate network, the security of both personal and company 
information can be an issue. 
Mobile Device Jailbreaking
From a mobile device perspective, jailbreaking is a way to remove manufacturer or 
 carrier restrictions from an Apple mobile device. Although jailbreaking is performed on 
Apple devices that run the iOS operating system, such as the iPad and iPhone, the term is 
 sometimes used with other devices, including Android devices. (However, a similar  concept 
that is known as rooting applies to Android devices. See the next section.) Jailbreaking 
will allow a user to modify the device’s operating system for various reasons. In  addition 
to voiding the manufacturer’s warranty, jailbreaking a phone can make the device 
more  susceptible to viruses, malware, and Trojans in addition to other security issues. 
Jailbreaking applications can damage your mobile device, rendering it useless, and once 
jailbreaking has occurred, the manufacturer or carrier where you purchased the device is 
not responsible for repairing or replacing it.
Android Rooting
Android rooting is a method of modifying an Android-enabled device to allow the owner to 
obtain administrative privileges or control over the operating system. This will allow the user to 

Understanding Risks Associated with Mobile Device Hardware 
571
modify the actual operating system code and perform tasks that are not intended for the aver-
age user to do. The following list includes some of the disadvantages of rooting your device:
 
■
Voiding the manufacturer’s warranty
 
■
Rendering the device useless
 
■
Allowing for viruses, malware, and Trojans
Keep in mind that the Android operating system is designed with several limitations and 
restrictions by carriers or manufacturers for commercial software usage and for security 
reasons. Therefore, you should consider the potential drawbacks prior to rooting a device.
Understanding Risks Associated with 
Mobile Device Hardware
In addition the potential software risks associated with mobile devices, there are certain 
hardware risks. They include loss or theft of devices and device cloning. A well-defi ned 
security policy will help to lessen the impact of lost or stolen devices. Becoming aware of 
newer technology such as femtocell technology and the threats associated with it will also 
help to lessen other potential security risks.
Mobile Device Loss or Theft
If a mobile device or computer is lost or stolen, this could have serious consequences 
for the security of an organization and its users. Many mobile devices are confi gured to 
 automatically connect to and log into a corporate wireless network. Once logged in, the 
device will have access to any data or resources that are assigned to the user. It is impera-
tive that corporate policy or company best practices educate users on the potential impli-
cations of a mobile device confi gured as such if it is lost or stolen. Asset management will 
help to identify whether a device is lost or stolen. However, in some cases it may take time 
to determine that this is the case. The user of the device must take some responsibility and 
report any missing or stolen device that may result in a security threat to the organization. 
Here are some recommended practices to help protect your information in the event of a 
lost or stolen mobile device:
 
■
Password protect the device.
 
■
Always keep the device in your possession.
 
■
Never leave the device unattended.
 
■
Refrain from having the device cache user credentials for sites capable of financial 
transactions and other sensitive information.
 
■
Keep all information backed up in a secure location (for example, a  trustworthy 
online service).

572 
Chapter 15 ■ Mobile Device Security Threats and Risks 
Mobile Device Cloning
Cloning is a generic term that means to make an exact copy or replica of something using a 
part of the original item. The concept of cloning a mobile device is no different. The tech-
nology used will determine how diffi cult the process will be. Some mobile devices, such as 
smartphones, contain numbers to uniquely identify them:
 
■
The electronic serial number (ESN)
 
■
The mobile equipment identifier (MEID)
 
■
The mobile identification number (MIN)
One way of cloning a CDMA device is with the use of a femtocell, which basically is a 
mini or personal cell tower. The characters of a femtocell are similar to those of a home 
broadband router. These devices typically have a cellular radio to connect to the mobile 
devices and a connection to the Internet through the use of a DSL or a cable modem. A 
mobile device such a smartphone will connect to a femtocell and then the data will be 
transmitted over the Internet to the cellular carrier. A modifi ed femtocell will be able to 
see specifi c information such as the unique identifi ers. The identifi ers can be entered into 
a different device, which is then made into an exact replica or clone of the original device. 
There are some limitations with this method and the details are beyond the scope of this 
book. One reason for cloning is to make free (fraudulent) phone calls from the cloned 
device. The bill for these calls would be the responsibility of the subscriber.
Understanding Risks Affecting 
Organizations
In addition to risks associated with software that is installed on computers and mobile 
devices, other situations must be taken into consideration, such as BYOD and proper use 
of removable media. These have the potential to affect an organization and the technology 
devices that are in use.
Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Ramifications
Bring your own device (BYOD) is becoming an important but debatable topic in the 
 technology sector. Many organizations are working to determine the pros and cons 
of employees bringing their own personal devices to use on the corporate network. 
Several key points must be considered with BYOD, including network capacity and 
security. Depending on when the network was installed, it may not have the capacity 
to handle this type of arrangement. Additionally, concerns about network security are 
a factor. One benefi t of BYOD is that the devices used on the corporate network may 
be leveraged for company use, therefore providing a cost savings to the organization. 
Although the device is a personal asset, it can be managed by the organization using 

Understanding Risks Affecting Organizations 
573
mobile device management (MDM)  control, mobile security solutions, and application 
management.
Risks with Removable Media
Securing removable media is an important consideration when it comes to mobile device
security. Removable media includes Universal Serial Bus (USB) drives, SIMs, Secure 
Digital (SD) cards, and other portable drive sources. These types of removable media are
convenient, are readily available online and in many retail stores, and can be considered 
dangerous. Some corporate policies do not allow the use of removable media under any 
circumstances. In some cases, the penalty for violating this policy could mean dismissal
by the organization. This is especially true in government organizations and those that 
have high security concerns. To help lessen the temptation to use these devices, some
 corporate hardware device policies will require that the devices be locked, not allowing 
the removable media to be recognized by the operating system and therefore rendering 
it unusable.
Wiping Personal Data
When the time comes to dispose of your mobile device, I highly recommend that you
delete all personal information to protect yourself from someone who might gain posses-
sion of the device. Mobile devices are often disposed of, upgraded, donated to a charity,
or recycled. You may be surprised at the amount of personal data that is retained within a 
personal device. This includes but is not limited to the following information: 
■
Your contact list
■
Your call history
■
Your text messages
■
Your personal photos
■
Your email account credentials
■
Your emails stored locally
■
Your calendar history and appointments
There are different ways to remove personal data from a device. There may be a built-in
wipe feature or you may be able to reset the device to factory defaults. Before activating any
feature that will wipe out any personal information, perform a complete backup of all data 
in case it needs to be recovered in the future. Exercise 15.1 shows how to perform a wipe of 
mobile devices.
The following steps are intended for informational purposes only. Execut-
ing these steps will erase all data and settings from the mobile device, and
the process is not reversible.

The amount of time it takes will depend on the amount of information that is deleted.
With Apple mobile devices using iOS 5 or later, the Erase All Content 
And Settings option erases user settings and information by removing 
the encryption key that protects the data. This can be a fast process and 
applies to iPhone 3GS and later and all models of the iPad and the iPod 
Touch (third generation) or later. Any other Apple device, such as the origi-
nal iPhone, iPhone 3G, iPad Touch, and iPod Touch (second generation) 
are devices that can be “erased” by overwriting memory, which is a more 
involved process. If you choose the Erase All Content And Settings option, 
the entire process can take minutes or even several hours, depending on 
the device. I recommend that you connect your device to a charger and 
leave it connected until the entire process has completed.
Unknown Devices on Network or Server
Unknown devices on a network or connected to a corporate server can create a  number of 
issues and concerns, such as how unknown devices might interact with available resources, 
network capacity, IP address management, bandwidth, and others. An unknown device 
is not necessarily a rogue device; it just may not be registered with the company as a 
 company-owned asset and could be the result of BYOD. If users are permitted to use per-
sonal devices on a corporate network and an MDM solution is not in place or a policy 
is not properly set, legitimate devices with the correct access credentials will be able to 
connect and utilize the network. MDM solutions can require that devices are properly 
enrolled, data is encrypted, and the device is compliant with corporate policy. This will 
lessen the number of “unknown” devices and relieve the network of the impact they may 
have on the resources.
Summary
In this chapter we explored the various risks that are associated with mobile device 
 technology, including risks related to wireless technology, software, hardware, and 
 organizations. Many of these risks are not limited to computers but also to mobile devices, 

576 
Chapter 15 ■ Mobile Device Security Threats and Risks 
including smartphones and tablets. You saw the risks that could have an effect on a 
 wireless connection as well as how a hacker can hijack a connection to gain control and 
then retransmit to a legitimate AP, thereby exploiting all traffi c that passes through. We 
looked at various software risks that could have a negative impact on all devices  connected 
to a network. These include threats related to malware, viruses, and spyware, to name a 
few. Finally, the chapter covered hardware risks, including lost or stolen devices and clon-
ing. Risks affecting an organization in general were also discussed.
Chapter Essentials
Understand the risks that are associated with wireless technology.  Be familiar with the 
general risks associated with wireless technology, including public Wi-Fi hotspots, 
rogue AP, cell tower spoofi ng, weak security keys, and others.
Understand that the only protection against intentional RF jamming is physical secu-
rity.  RF jamming can be intentional or unintentional, and intentional jamming devices 
must be physically located and removed to prevent potential security threats.
Know how an RF DoS attack can affect wireless mobile devices.  Understand that a 
hacker can interrupt a valid RF signal and perform a wireless hijack attack. This will then 
provide the opportunity to create a wireless man-in-the-middle attack, potentially causing 
serious security breaches.
Understand the meaning of malware.  Malware is a general term used to describe a variety 
of different software-based threats, not any one specifi c threat.
Understand the risks associated with software.  The risks associated with software include 
information technology viruses, computer worms, Trojans, keyloggers, and spyware. 
Understand the differences between these threats and that they are potentially damaging to 
both computers and mobile devices.
Be familiar with the risks associated with mobile device hardware.  Mobile device loss 
or theft may have serious adverse security effects. Understand that someone can clone a 
mobile device even without gaining physical possession of it.
Be familiar with the risks associated with an organization.  Understand the effects of 
BYOD, using removable media, wiping personal data, and other behavior that could have 
an impact on an organization.

Device Authentication 
and Data Encryption
TOPICS COVERED IN THIS CHAPTER:
 
✓Access Control
 
✓Authentication Processes
 
✓Encryption Methods for Wireless Networking
 
✓Cipher Methods
 
✓Secure Tunneling
 
✓Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Concepts
 
✓Physical Media Encryption

In computer networking, authentication is defi ned as a way 
of confi rming an identity; basically, it determines that you 
are who you say you are. Data privacy is ensuring that infor-
mation or data is understandable only by the individuals or groups it is intended for: the 
sender and the intended receiver. In this chapter you will learn about various methods of 
access control, the authentication process, and encryption types used with mobile devices 
and wireless networking. Information that is either stored on a device (at rest) or travers-
ing a network (in transit) should be secured to ensure that only those authorized to view 
it are able to do so. This chapter will explore various types of encryption and the encryp-
tion processes (ciphers) they work with. Finally, you will see that physical media such 
as hard disks and removable media are vulnerable to security breaches if they are not 
properly protected.
Access Control
Restricting access to any type of computer network system is an important part of network 
security. Access control can be accomplished in several ways using different authentica-
tion methods. One way people may think of authentication is to simply supply a username 
and password to log onto a computer. Another would be to enter the appropriate logon 
information before performing an activity like Internet banking. Here are several common 
authentication concepts that provide access control:
 
■
Username and password
 
■
Personal identification numbers (PINs)
 
■
Security tokens
 
■
Certificate authentication
 
■
Biometrics
 
■
Multifactor authentication
Username and Password
One very common way to validate a person’s identity is by supplying them with a username 
and password pair. This is a method that most users of technology can relate to. When a 
user is attempting to log on to a system, the information they supply will be challenged 

Access Control 
579
against a database for validity. If the information supplied provides a match, then the user 
will gain access to the system. One potential issue with this type of authentication is the 
fact that anyone with access to this logon information will be able to gain access to the sys-
tem with the information entered. Therefore, this access control method is only as secure 
as those who have possession of the username and password. Unfortunately, many people 
do not understand the importance of keeping this type of information confi dential and can 
make this a weak access control method. 
Personal Identification Numbers (PINs)
A personal identifi cation number (PIN) is a password that usually consists of numeric 
digits. This is a common authentication method used with ATM cards or debit cards. 
The most common length for a PIN is 4 digits. However, the international standard 
(ISO-9564-1) allows from 4 to 12 digits. Just as you would keep a password private, a PIN 
should be treated the same way to ensure security. A PIN is considered to be one of the best 
methods to restrict access to a mobile device such as a mobile phone or a tablet and is a 
common method used to lock the device from unauthorized access.
Security Tokens
Security tokens consist of an electronic device of some type, commonly part of a card 
and used for authentication in smart cards and other physical devices. Like some of the 
other authentication methods mentioned, security tokens are used to validate a user’s 
identity. A security token may also be called an authentication token and is used with 
multifactor authentication. A key fob is another physical device that can be used as a 
security token.
Certificate Authentication
Using digital certifi cates (certifi cate authentication) as an access control method for mobile 
devices, computers, and other devices will ensure that only valid authorized users will gain 
access to the corporate network infrastructure. Digital certifi cates are used to validate a 
user’s identity and help protect network resources. Certifi cates, and the public key infra-
structure are discussed in more detail later in this chapter. 
Biometrics
Biometrics is something unique to you as an individual. This may include a fi ngerprint, 
palm print, facial scan, retinal scan, or some other human characteristic. Since these are 
unique to a specifi c person, they cannot be duplicated or stolen and therefore provide a high 
level of security. Biometrics is often used in conjunction with something you know, such 
as a PIN, or something you have, such as a card, and therefore will provide  multifactor 
authentication.

580 
Chapter 16 ■ Device Authentication and Data Encryption
Multifactor Authentication
This type of authentication provides a more secure level of access control then the previously 
mentioned username and password pair. Multifactor authentication, also known as two-
factor authentication, requires at least two components of authentication criteria for a login 
to be validated and the user to gain access to a system. The information types are as follows:
Something You Know  This includes a username/password pair or personal identifi cation 
number (PIN).
Something You Have  This is something physical you have in your possession such as an 
automated teller machine (ATM) card, common access card (CAC), digital certifi cate, or 
token smart card.
Something Unique to You  This includes a biometric characteristic such as a facial scan, 
retinal scan, palm print, or a fi ngerprint.
One familiar method of multifactor authentication is an automated teller machine (ATM) 
card. The ATM card cannot be used without the physical card and knowledge of a personal 
identifi cation number (PIN). The card is something you have and the PIN is something you 
know. To use this type of multifactor authentication, you would insert the ATM card into 
a banking machine and enter a PIN. This type of access control is becoming a much more 
common method of authentication because of fraud and identity theft concerns. 
Authentication Processes
There are many different authentication processes available, and the one you choose to use 
will depend on the type of system you are planning to secure. In the following sections, 
we will focus on authentication types that are used with wireless networking and mobile 
device security. However, keep in mind that some of the authentication processes discussed 
here will also be valid with other types of systems, including wired networking systems. 
Wireless Passphrase Security
Wireless passphrase-based security was designed with the small offi ce, home offi ce (SOHO) 
or home-based wireless network user in mind. This type of security allows a user to create 
a secure wireless LAN solution without the experience or knowledge necessary to confi gure 
enterprise-level components such as an 802.1X/EAP and a RADIUS server. Passphrase-
based security requires all wireless devices that are part of the same wireless network to 
have the same 256-bit pre-shared key (PSK) in order to securely communicate with each 
other. Deriving a secure key of this length would be a daunting task; to ease the burden of 
having to create a long secure key, the passphrase was introduced. This works by requir-
ing the user to enter a strong passphrase on all wireless devices that are part of the same 
wireless network to be secured. The benefi t of a passphrase is that it can be a sequence of 
words or other text that is memorable only to the user who created it. After the passphrase 

Authentication Processes 
581
is entered into the device, with the help of an electronic algorithm from the IEEE 802.11i 
amendment, a secure 256-bit pre-shared key will be created. 
The Wi-Fi Protected Access certifications (WPA and WPA2) refer to the 
passphrase method of security as personal mode.
The characteristics of the passphrase used with IEEE 802.11 devices are as follows:
 
■
It consists of 8 to 63 ASCII (case-sensitive) or 64 hexadecimal characters.
 
■
It creates a 256-bit pre-shared key.
 
■
The longer and more random the passphrase and the more mixed-case and special 
characters and such it includes, the more secure it will be.
 
■
Weak passphrases can be compromised.
Several software programs and websites have random password genera-
tors to aid in the generation of strong passphrases. One such website 
is Gibson Research Corporation. GRC’s Ultra High Security Password 
 Generator can be found at www.grc.com/passwords.htm.

Wireless Networking WPA and WPA2 Enterprise 
Security
Concerned about problems connected with MAC address fi ltering and WEP, the industry 
drove the development of additional, improved wireless security solutions. One of these 
solutions also operates at Layer 2 and is an IEEE standard. This advanced enterprise-level 
solution is known as IEEE 802.1X, which addresses port-based access control and, used in 
conjunction with Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), allows for user-based authenti-
cation. You will learn more about IEEE 802.1X and EAP next. User-based security allows 
an administrator to restrict access to a wireless network and its resources by creating users 
in a centralized database. Anyone trying to join the network will be required to authen-
ticate as one of the users by supplying a valid username and password. After successful 
authentication, the user will be able to gain access to resources for which they have permis-
sions. This type of mutual authentication is more secure than the previously mentioned 
passphrase security method.
IEEE 802.1X/EAP
IEEE 802.1X/EAP consists of two different components used together to form an enter-
prise network security solution. In the standards-based wireless networking world, IEEE 
802.1X/EAP is defi ned in the IEEE 802.11-2012 standard but was originally part of 
the IEEE 802.11i amendment. We’ll fi rst discuss the IEEE 802.1X standard and then 
Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP). Then we’ll combine the technology and terms to 
form IEEE 802.1X/EAP.
IEEE 802.1X
IEEE 802.1X is a port-based access control method and was designed to work with IEEE 
802.3 Ethernet wired networks. However, this standard was adapted into the wireless 
world as an alternative, more powerful solution to legacy 802.11 wireless networking 
 security technologies. Wireless devices that use 802.1X technology are identifi ed using 
 different terminology than that used in IEEE 802.11 standards-based wireless networking:
Supplicant  Supplicant is another name for the wireless client device attempting to connect 
to the wireless network. This is the IEEE 802.1X terminology for the software security 
component of the wireless client device. 
Authenticator  Authenticator is the IEEE 802.1X term for the wireless access point or 
wireless LAN controller. The authenticator acts as a middleman between the wireless 
supplicant and the authentication server. When the supplicant requests to join the 
wireless network, the authenticator passes the authentication information between the 
two devices.
Authentication Server  The term authentication server is used by the IEEE 802.1X standard 
to identify the server that will authenticate the wireless supplicant. The authentication 
server receives all information from the authenticator. The authentication server may use

authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) services and perform RADIUS server 
functionality; both AAA and RADIUS are explained later in this chapter.

Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)
IEEE 802.1X is a framework that allows for an authentication process. The authentication 
process used with IEEE 802.1X is Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), specifi ed 
under RFC 3748. The IEEE 802.1X standard will employ some EAP type to complete this 
process. Many types of EAP are available in the industry that can be used with wireless 
networking technologies. They vary from proprietary solutions to very secure standard 
solutions. Here are some examples of some popular EAP types:
 
■
EAP-TLS (certificates required)
 
■
TTLS (EAP-MSCHAPv2)
 
■
PEAP (EAP-MSCHAPv2)
 
■
EAP-SIM for GSM Subscriber Identity Module (SIM)
 
■
EAP-AKA for Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS)
These and other EAP types allow a user of mobile devices to authenticate to a network 
in several ways, including using credentials such as username/password and digital 
certifi cate–based authentication.

Chapter 16 ■ Device Authentication and Data Encryption
IEEE 802.1X and EAP Together: IEEE 802.1X/EAP
Now it is time to put these two parts together to form the IEEE 802.1X/EAP authentica-
tion process. This authentication process is typically used for enterprise-level security, 
but it’s sometimes used in smaller wireless installations. As mentioned earlier, a variety 
of EAP types are available in the industry that work very well with IEEE 802.11 wireless 
networking. The EAP type chosen will depend on the environment in which the  wireless 
network is used. EAP types vary in specifi cations, costs, and complexity. Figure 16.3 
shows IEEE 802.1X/EAP confi guration on a cloud-based wireless network 
management system.

Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS)
Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) is a networking protocol that 
 provides centralized authentication and administration of user login accounts. RADIUS 
started years ago as a way to authenticate and authorize dial-up networking users. A  network 
user would dial up to a network from a remote location using the public switched telephone 
network (PSTN) and a computer modem. A modem from a modem pool on the receiver side 
would answer the call. The user would then be prompted by a remote access server to enter 
a username and password in order to authenticate and gain access to the  network. Once the 
credentials were validated, the user would have access to any resources for which they had 
permissions. Figure 16.4 illustrates the remote access service authentication mechanism.

In this example, the remote access client would be the computer dialing into the 
network, and the remote access server would be the one performing the authentication for 
the dial-up user. As computer networks grew in size and complexity and remote access 
technology improved, there was a need to optimize the process on the remote access server 
side. This is where RADIUS provides a solution. RADIUS took decentralized remote access 
services databases and combined them into one central location, allowing for centralized 
user administration and centralized management. It eased the burden of having to manage 
several databases and optimized administration of remote access services.
A company does not need a large number of RADIUS servers. For a small to medium-sized 
company, one RADIUS server should be suffi cient (with a backup if possible). Larger enterprise 
organizations may need several RADIUS servers across the entire wide area network. In 
wireless networking, the wireless access point can act as a RADIUS client, which means it will

have the capability to accept requests from wireless client devices and forward them to the 
RADIUS server for authentication. Figure 16.5 shows an example of this confi guration.

RADIUS Server
As Figure 16.5 shows, the remote access client is now the wireless access point. The 
wireless client device is authorized as a user in the database of the RADIUS server. The 
RADIUS server is the authenticating server, and if not using a protocol such as Lightweight 
Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) to query an external directory service will also contain 
the RADIUS client database. 
A RADIUS server may use authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) 
services. In this confi guration, the RADIUS server will authenticate users (validate 
credentials) and provide access to the resources for which they have permissions, which 
is also known as access control. In addition, it will keep track of all transactions using 
accounting methods by logging all information and activity.
Terminal Access Controller Access Control System (TACACS) is a legacy 
authentication protocol that was available prior to the adoption of RADIUS 
and was used to forward an encrypted user password to an external authen-
tication database. TACACS would then validate the user credentials prior to 
allowing access to a remote access server (RAS). TACACS+ is a newer, pro-
prietary protocol designed by Cisco Systems that uses Transmission Control 
Protocol (TCP) (as compared to UDP used by RADIUS) and will encrypt both 
a username and password (the entire packet). Network administrators may 
choose to use TACACS+ rather than RADIUS as a network access protocol.

Encryption Methods for Wireless Networking 
587
Encryption Methods for Wireless 
Networking
Computer data and information can be encrypted using two different methods, symmetric 
encryption and asymmetric encryption. Symmetric encryption uses a private key process 
and asymmetric encryption uses a public key process. Symmetric key encryption is used 
with wireless networking to encrypt the data payload of the wireless frame. 
The type of security in use (either passphrase or enterprise) will determine the information 
that is used with the encryption key generation process. Note that the data encryption keys 
are never transmitted across the wireless medium. However, some information (keying 
material) shared between each pair of devices will generate or derive the same data encryption 
key. Legacy WEP encryption uses static keys between all devices on the common wireless 
network. Conversely, TKIP and CCMP use a dynamic process to derive the keys based on the 
keying material that is used.
Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)
From a security perspective, one major drawback to any wireless network is the fact that all 
information, including data payload, travels through the open air from one device to another. 
This makes wireless networks vulnerable to eavesdropping and inherently less secure than 
bounded networking using other mediums such as Ethernet cabling. With IEEE 802.11 open 
system authentication, all information is broadcast through the air in plain text. This means 
anyone with knowledge of how to use a wireless packet analyzer or other wireless scanning soft-
ware program can easily see all the information that is passing between devices through the air. 
Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) was designed as a way to protect wireless networking 
from casual eavesdropping. The original IEEE 802.11 standard states that the use of WEP 
is optional. The manufacturer supplies the capability, but it is up to the user of the wireless 
device to implement it.
With wireless networks, WEP can be used in one of two ways: with IEEE 802.11 
open system authentication to encrypt the data only or with legacy IEEE 802.11 shared-
key authentication, which is used for both wireless device authentication and for data 
encryption. The original standard specifi ed only 64-bit WEP, which consists of a 40-bit key 
plus a 24-bit WEP initialization vector (IV).
It is important not to confuse IEEE 802.11 legacy shared-key authentication 
with the pre-shared key that is used currently with WPA or WPA2 pass-
phrase mode. IEEE 802.11 shared-key authentication requires legacy WEP 
encryption, which is not secure and should not be used.
WEP is fairly simple to implement. It requires all wireless devices on a common network 
to have the same WEP key. The WEP key can be either 64-bit or 128-bit; however, the 
standard requires only 64-bit WEP. 

588 
Chapter 16 ■ Device Authentication and Data Encryption
As mentioned earlier, one disadvantage to WEP is that it uses static keys, which means all 
wireless devices—access points, bridges, and client stations—must have the same key and the 
key must be manually entered into them. Anytime the key is changed, it must be changed on all 
of the wireless devices that are on the same SSID. No matter which you use, 64-bit WEP or 
128-bit WEP, you are still only using a 24-bit IV that is transmitted in cleartext. 64-bit WEP 
uses a 40-bit secret key and a 24-bit IV. 128-bit WEP uses a 104-bit secret key but still only the 
24-bit IV, making both 64-bit WEP and 129-bit WEP vulnerable to the same attacks. Gathering 
a number of frames containing these IVs allows a hacker to crack your WEP key very quickly. 
Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP)
Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) was designed as a fi rmware upgrade to WEP. This 
provided a fi x for some of the inherent fl aws with WEP and an interim solution  pending the 
release of the IEEE 802.11i amendment, which specifi ed CCMP/AES to provide a strong 
security solution. TKIP added several enhancements to the WEP algorithm and was the 
foundation for the Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) certifi cation from the Wi-Fi Alliance. 
These enhancements are as follows:
 
■
Per-packet key mixing of the IV to separate IVs from weak keys
 
■
A dynamic rekeying mechanism to change encryption and integrity keys
 
■
48-bit IV and IV sequence counter to prevent replay attacks
 
■
Message integrity check (MIC) to prevent forgery attacks
 
■
Use of the RC4 stream cipher, thereby allowing backward compatibility with WEP
Confi guring a wireless network to use TKIP is a fairly straightforward process. It can be 
accomplished either by using the web interface available on most SOHO access points or by 
using the web interface or command-line interface for enterprise-level access points. For the 
wireless client devices, TKIP will be confi gured through the client software utility. Some 
older wireless hardware devices may not support TKIP. If this is the case, replacement 
of the hardware will be necessary in order to take advantage of newer security solutions.

Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message 
Authentication Code Protocol (CCMP)
Counter Mode with Cipher-Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol 
(CCMP) is a mandatory part of the IEEE 801.11i amendment, now in the IEEE 802.11-
2012 standard and part of Wi-Fi Protected Access 2.0 (WPA2) certifi cation from the 
Wi-Fi Alliance. CCMP uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm block 
cipher. CCMP capability is mandatory for robust security network (RSN) compliance. If 
an RSN is required to comply with an industry or government regulation, CCMP must be 
used. CCMP is also intended as a replacement to TKIP. Because of the strong encryption 
CCMP provides, it may require replacement of legacy wireless hardware devices that are 
not capable of the newer technology. In some cases, it may use a separate chip to perform 
computation-intensive AES ciphering.
Confi guration of CCMP is similar to that of TKIP, discussed earlier. The main 
difference with CCMP is that legacy hardware devices may not support it and it is a 
stronger encryption solution. Figure 16.7 illustrates the CCMP encryption process. CCMP 
is the most secure encryption method to use to secure a wireless network.

Cipher Methods
The term cipher is defi ned as a method used to encrypt and decrypt information. There are 
many different cipher technologies available that are derived from two common processes, 
stream cipher and block cipher. Both processes use an encryption key and an encryption 
method to encrypt (scramble) cleartext information.
Stream Ciphers
A stream cipher will encrypt information on a per-bit basis. This means that each bit in a 
data stream will be encrypted individually. Using an exclusive OR (XOR) process, the data 

590 
Chapter 16 ■ Device Authentication and Data Encryption
stream is combined with what appears to be a random code, but it’s really not random 
and is known as a pseudorandom stream. Figure 16.8 illustrates the bit-level stream 
cipher process.

One common stream cipher is RC4. This cipher was created in 1987 and developed by Ron 
Rivest of RSA Security. The RC stands for Ron’s code, and RC4 may also be known as 
ARC4 or ARCFOUR. This cipher is used with WEP and TKIP, both discussed earlier in 
this chapter. The vulnerability with WEP was not necessarily RC4 but the plaintext 24-bit 
initialization vector (IV) used to create the encrypted ciphertext. TKIP also uses the RC4 
stream cipher, but enhancements such as a message integrity check (MIC) help to secure the 
weaknesses that were in WEP.
Block Ciphers
Unlike a stream cipher that encrypts each data bit individually, a block cipher will 
encrypt information in specifi c block sizes. A common block size is 64 bits of information. 
Figure 16.9 illustrates the block cipher encryption process.

Secure Tunneling 
591
Following are some block ciphers:
Data Encryption Algorithm (DES)  DES was developed in the early 1970s by IBM and 
uses a block size of 64 bits with a key length of 56 bits. In the late 1970s, a modifi ed 
 version of DES became Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) compliant. DES 
was compromised in early 1999, therefore making it insecure in many cases. As technology 
advanced, so did the capability to break encryption algorithms requiring more sophisti-
cated methods. 
Triple Data Encryption Algorithm (3DES)  3DES is an enhanced version of DES that 
basically encrypts three times, hence the term triple DES or 3DES. This stronger version 
of DES used the 56-bit key length but was used three times with each 64-bit block of data, 
thereby increasing the key size to 168 bits. This stronger algorithm decreased the possibility 
of security weaknesses such as brute-force attacks on the transmission of data.
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)  AES is a strong encryption algorithm that is widely 
used in modern day wireless networks. In conjunction with CCMP encryption, it is consid-
ered unbreakable and is the required cipher suite for IEEE 802.11i compliance and WPA2-
certifi ed devices. AES uses a larger block size of 128 bits (recall 64 bits with DES and 
3DES) and three possible key lengths of 128, 192, and 256 bits.
Twofish  Twofi sh was one of the fi ve fi nalists for the AES standard. Twofi sh is another 
block cipher and uses a block size of 128 bits with a key length of 128 bits up to 256 bits. 
It’s optimized for 32-bit central processing units (CPUs). Twofi sh is not under patent pro-
tection and is free for anyone to use.
Elliptical Curve Cryptography (ECC)  Based on public-key cryptography, Elliptical Curve 
Cryptography (ECC) is used widely across the Internet to secure web-based communica-
tions and data transfers. ECC is a complex method based on elliptical mathematical curves 
referenced to an x- and y-axis providing an equation and diffi cult-to-replicate results. This 
provides a very strong, if not the strongest, method for securing data on mobile devices.
The CompTIA exam objectives categorize these block cipher encryption 
algorithms as “data at rest” encryption methods for the Mobility+ (MB0-
001) certification exam. Data at rest is a term that is commonly used to 
refer to information that is physically stored on a device.
Secure Tunneling
Whether using remote or local connectivity, securing access to computer networks is 
a critical component with today’s computing technology. Connecting from a remote 
location usually involves a public Internet connection. By using a tunneling and encryp-
tion mechanism, you can securely exchange information on a public or private network 
infrastructure. In the following sections, you will learn about the virtual private network 
(VPN) technology and tunneling and encryption methods that are commonly used to 
secure data transmissions.

592 
Chapter 16 ■ Device Authentication and Data Encryption
The CompTIA exam objectives categorize the data for which some of the 
encryption techniques discussed in the following sections are used as data 
in transit for the Mobility+ (MB0-001) certification exam. Data in transit is a 
term that is commonly used to refer to information (data) that is encrypted 
as it traverses a corporate network, an intranet, or the Internet. This 
includes websites and mobile device apps. These methods will protect the 
information from hackers who know how to intercept the information as it 
traverses the infrastructure. 
Virtual Private Networking (VPN)
Virtual private networking (VPN) provides the capability to create private communications 
over a public network infrastructure such as the Internet. The security solutions discussed 
earlier in this chapter are Layer 2 security solutions; that is, they all work at Layer 2 of the 
OSI model. By contrast, VPNs are based on the Internet Protocol; they typically operate at 
several layers of the OSI model, depending on the encryption/protocol used, and there are 
some that operate at Layer 2. Figure 16.10 illustrates VPN technology in relation to the 
OSI model.

Prior to the ratifi cation of the IEEE 802.11i amendment to the standard, VPN 
technology was prevalent in enterprise deployments as well as in remote access security. 
Since Layer 2 security solutions have become stronger (mostly thanks to the 802.11i 
amendment and the Wi-Fi Alliance WPA and WPA2 certifi cations), VPN technology is not 
as widely used within enterprise LANs. However, VPN still remains a powerful security 
solution for remote access in both wired and wireless networking.

Secure Tunneling 
593
VPNs consist of two parts—tunneling and encryption. Figure 16.11 illustrates a VPN 
tunnel using the Internet. A stand-alone VPN tunnel does not provide data encryption, 
and VPN tunnels are created across Internet Protocol (IP) networks. In a very basic sense, 
VPNs use encapsulation methods where one IP frame is encapsulated within a second IP 
frame. The encryption of VPNs is performed as a separate function.

IPsec Encryption
Two common types of VPN protocols are Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) and 
Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP).
Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol
Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) is mentioned in this book because at one time 
it was a popular VPN technology due to the ease of confi guration, and it is contained 
within the Microsoft Windows operating system starting with Windows 95. You saw in 
Chapter 6, “Computer Network Infrastructure Devices” that one benefi t of PPTP is that 
it provides both tunneling and encryption capabilities for the user’s data. The encryption 
is achieved by utilizing the Microsoft Point-to-Point Encryption (MPPE-128) protocol. I 
recommend you not use PPTP because potential serious security vulnerabilities have been 
found within the protocol. The next topic discussed, Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP), is 
the recommended tunneling protocol that should be used today. 
If the PPTP configuration uses MS-CHAP version 2 for user authentication 
on a wireless network, it can be a security issue. This authentication process 
can be captured using a wireless protocol analyzer or other scanning 
software program and potentially allow someone to perform a dictionary 
attack, allowing them to acquire a user’s credentials and eventually 
giving them the capability to log on to the network. A dictionary attack is 
 performed by software that challenges the encrypted password against 
common words or phrases in a text file (dictionary). Therefore, using PPTP 
on a wireless network should be avoided. Keep in mind that the security 
vulnerability is not PPTP itself; it is that the authentication frames on a 
wireless LAN can be captured by an intruder, who can then acquire user 
credentials (username and password) and be able to gain access to the VPN.

594 
Chapter 16 ■ Device Authentication and Data Encryption
Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol
You also learned in Chapter 6 that Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) is the combination 
of two different tunneling protocols: Cisco’s Layer 2 Forwarding (L2F) and Microsoft’s 
Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP). L2TP defi nes the tunneling process and requires 
some level of encryption in order to provide the needed security which will protect the data 
in-transit. L2TP provides much improvement including enhanced security mechanism over 
a PPTP VPN solution. It is important to note that PPTP should not be used unless abso-
lutely necessary and only when more secure solutions such as L2TP are unavailable. L2TP 
became part of the Microsoft Windows operating system starting with Windows XP, is 
included with the Apple MAC OS X v10.3 and is also in mobile platform operating systems 
such as iOS and Android.
Secure Shell (SSH)
Secure Shell (SSH) is a network tunneling protocol that uses port 22 for communications. 
Network managers and administrators commonly use SSH to remotely connect to and 
administer network infrastructure devices and provide data or fi le transfers. This is often 
referred to as a replacement for Telnet, which was used for remote terminal sessions and 
used plaintext communications, making them vulnerable to interception by an unauthor-
ized user. SSH can be used within the local area network or across a wide area network 
to secure these transmissions. SSH resides on a server and will provide a redirection to 
the appropriate networking service over port 22. For example, if a network administra-
tor wanted to manage computer services such as email or web servers or even confi gure 
network infrastructure devices such as a wireless access point, SSH would provide secure 
data transmissions for the session. A benefi t to using SSH is that it is platform independent 
and server and client software are both available commercially and open source. SSH2 is a 
stronger version of SSH and should be used whenever possible.
Web-Based Security
You learned in Chapter 2, “Common Network Protocols and Ports,” about different 
 protocols that are used to secure communications over the Internet. The native proto-
cols of the Internet (TCP/IP) alone do not provide any security. Therefore, additional 
 mechanisms to secure information are necessary. The methods that include securing 
Internet protocols include Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Hypertext Transfer Protocol 
Secure (HTTPS).
Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology can be used with a variety of protocols to secure 
Internet-based communications. This includes but is not limited to HTTP, POP3, and FTP. 
As the name implies, it is a security protocol that creates an encrypted link between a client 
device and a server. Using SSL in conjunction with the protocols just mentioned will basi-
cally add the SSL functionality, resulting in HTTPS, POP3S, and FTPS. This will secure 

Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Concepts 
595
what were otherwise unsecured networking protocols and provide some level of privacy to 
the communications. 
SSL was succeeded by Transport Layer Security (TLS), which is based on SSL 
technology. SSL is native technology to most if not all modern Internet web browsers. 
Web servers that are SSL enabled will be issued a digital certifi cate from a valid certifi cate 
authority (CA). This will guarantee to the user that the server they are connecting with is in 
possession of a valid certifi cate issued from a CA and that transactions made will be secure. 
Although not the case 100 percent of the time, if a user receives a certifi cate error, it may be 
a red fl ag that the server they are connecting to is not a legitimate source. 
Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)
Browser-based Internet communication has grown by leaps and bounds over the last 20 
years. With this growth, the need for secure web communications has also increased. 
Browsers are now available on any device that has a connection to the Internet, including 
computers, smartphones, and tablets, for example. These devices are now used for applica-
tions such as online banking, online purchases and paying bills. Therefore, secure commu-
nications are a must to ensure that these exchanges cannot be compromised. 
You learned in Chapter 2 that the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) uses TCP port 80 
for communications, and TCP port 80 provides cleartext communications. Adding a secure 
socket layer to the HTTP connection ensures a secure data exchange. HTTPS uses TCP 
port 443, providing the needed SSL secure connection. It is important to understand that in 
some cases the SSL connection is used only for the authentication process to secure the user’s 
logon credentials. Once the logon is complete, the SSL is dropped and the communications 
are back to unsecured HTTP port 80 communication in cleartext. Users need to be educated 
to always be aware of this type of web-based and Internet connectivity because they 
sometimes assume that security stays in place after the logon process is complete.
Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Concepts
Another method used to secure data transmissions is public key infrastructure (PKI) tech-
nology. PKI is used in an asymmetric key encryption process that uses both public and private 
encryption keys that will secure the data communications. Each device possesses a pair of 
these keys. The public key is distributed to other devices, and the private key is kept private 
with the source device. 
PKI is a secure method but comes with extra administration overhead, which can get 
expensive. PKI implementations are typically cost prohibitive for small networks and 
therefore more common with enterprise network installations. 
The components of a PKI infrastructure are as follows:
Certificate Authority (CA)  A certifi cate authority is responsible for issuing and managing 
digital certifi cates. Two types of CAs exist: commercial trusted certifi cate authorities or 
private authorities. Private CAs are typically used for internal use and vendor access.

596 
Chapter 16 ■ Device Authentication and Data Encryption
Digital Certificates  A digital certifi cate is an electronic method of validating a user’s iden-
tity. The certifi cate is the public key component in a PKI infrastructure and is electronically 
signed by the authority from which it was issued.
Certificate Revocation lists  A certifi cate revocation list contains a list of certifi cates that 
have been revoked for a variety of reasons. The reasons for revocation include a terminated 
employee or devices that are lost or stolen. If a certifi cate is revoked, the authentication 
process will fail.
Entity  In PKI terms, an entity is a server, computer, mobile device, user, router, or other 
network component that is part of the PKI. The client device that receives the certifi cate is 
known as the end entity. 
Physical Media Encryption
Security of the physical media in which information is stored, such as a computer hard 
drive or a removable electronic disk drive, is just as important as other types of network 
security, such as authentication. Physical media encryption may consist of encrypting entire 
hard drives, folders, or even specifi c fi les. This also applies to removable media such as 
Universal Serial Bus (USB) fl ash/portable drives, mobile devices, smartphones, and tablets, 
which also have data storage capabilities. In the following sections, we will explore how 
media encryption should be considered to protect stored information.
Full Disk Encryption
Full disk encryption (FDE) is a method of protecting the contents of an entire hard disk 
from anyone with physical access to the device that contains the hard disk. FDE will ensure 
that only users who are authorized to access the information on the device will be able to 
view the contents on the disk. This is accomplished by encrypting all of the content on the 
hard disk using third-party software programs or available hardware encryption mecha-
nisms. Depending on the method used, the disk partitions, including the master boot record 
(MBR), can be encrypted. Some versions of operating systems such as Microsoft Windows 
may include disk encryption capabilities that are native to the operating system. 
One thing to keep in mind is the trade-off of security with system performance. 
Depending on the software or hardware and the devices used, FDE may have an adverse 
affect on system performance. However, this would be the best way to protect the entire 
contents of a disk and the storage capabilities of a mobile device.
Block-Level Encryption
Understanding the mechanics of how disk storage works is beyond the objectives covered 
in this book. However, it is important to note that physical hard disks store information 
on sections, or blocks, within the physical hard disk. In other words, the area reserved for 

Physical Media Encryption 
597
the information may be larger then what is required for the data to be stored. Full disk 
encryption software interacts directly with the device’s operating system architecture and 
the fi le system itself. The block-level encryption process will encrypt each individual block 
of information that is stored on the disk using a block-level encryption process. When the 
user wants to view the encrypted information, the blocks containing the data will decrypt 
the data into the device’s electronic memory (RAM), allowing the authorized user to see 
and use the encrypted information.
Folder and File-Level Encryption
Two alternatives are folder encryption and fi le-level encryption. These types of encryp-
tion will allow the user of a device to encrypt specifi c folder or fi les that are contained 
on the physical disk. They may be benefi cial where the user wishes to protect only spe-
cifi c information such as a database or fi les that contain personal information about 
the user. One benefi t to folder and fi le-level encryption is that there may be less over-
head then full disk encryption, depending on the system and the information that 
is encrypted.
Exercise 16.1 demonstrates the basic folder and fi le encryption process on a computer 
using the Microsoft Windows 7 operating system. 
E X E R C I S E  1 6 .1

In this exercise, you will encrypt a folder and its contents in Microsoft Windows 7 
Professional using the built-in Microsoft encryption technology. To encrypt a folder and 
its contents, follow these steps:
1. 
Open the C:\ drive using Windows Explorer.
2. 
Create a test folder.
3. 
Save a ﬁ le to the test folder you created.
4.

Select the Apply Changes To This Folder, Subfolder And Files radio button and click OK.
The contents of this folder and subfolder are now encrypted. You will notice text 
representing the name of the folder is a lighter shade, showing that the encryption 
attributes have been applied for that folder.

Chapter 16 ■ Device Authentication and Data Encryption
Removable Media Encryption
The advancements in device storage technology can create a big problem within the corpo-
rate security environment. Removable media is getting less expensive, smaller with larger 
storage capabilities, and available in a variety of form factors. Removable media can be 
in the form of a USB fl ash drive, portable hard disk, digital camera, smartphone, tablet, 
or other device. The same principles of encryption apply here as previously mentioned for 
software or hardware solutions. However, the removable media encryption aspect cannot 
be overlooked. 
How removable media is handled is usually indicated in a corporate security policy. 
Regardless of whether the media/device is corporate owned or a personal device, it is 
important to understand that removable media and other devices capable of data storage 
can be lost or stolen. This can be a large security concern, which is why some corporate 
security policies prohibit the use of removable media and restrict the use of USB or other 
external connected devices on corporate-owned devices. 
Summary
In this chapter we explored different methods used to restrict access to a system such 
as a computer and devices such as mobile phones and tablets. You saw that this can be 
accomplished using several methods, including but not limited to username and password 
pair, biometrics, and digital certifi cates. You also learned about the importance of data 
encryption and the methods used for encrypting data at rest (stationary) and data in tran-
sit ( traversing a network). We also explored encrypting information that is stored on both 
physical disks and removable media.
Chapter Essentials
Be familiar with the various access control methods.  Understand the different methods 
used to restrict access to a system and that some are more secure than others. Multifactor 
authentication and digital certifi cates are secure methods and are used with mobile device 
authentication.
Know the different authentication processes used with networking.  Wireless networks 
use different authentication processes for user authentication, including passphrases, 
IEEE 802.1X/EAP with various types of EAP, and RADIUS. Strong passphrases will 
provide more secure authentication than weak passphrases. IEEE 802.1X/EAP is more 
common in larger enterprise networks but is becoming more available to mid-size 
network deployments.

Chapter Essentials 
599
Understand the different encryption methods used with wireless communications.  WEP 
is a legacy encryption method and should be avoided. TKIP was a fi x for WEP and provides 
better security than WEP. CCMP is currently the strongest encryption method available for 
wireless communications.
Understand the different cipher types that are used to encrypt data.  Know that in 
addition to an encryption type, a method to encrypt that information is required. Stream 
ciphers such as RC4 encrypt at the bit level, and block ciphers such as AES encrypt chunks 
of information. A common block size is 64 bytes. Understand that different methods use 
various key sizes. AES, for example, uses three possible key lengths of 128, 192, and 
256 bits. ECC provides a very strong, if not the strongest, method for securing data on 
mobile devices. 
Know that VPN technology will create private secure communications over a public 
network infrastructure.  Be familiar with the different methods of VPN technology, 
including tunneling and other protocols or encryption methods such as IPsec. These 
protocols can help secure data in transit. SSH is a port redirection protocol and is often 
used by network administrators to manage infrastructure devices and transfer fi les using 
secure methods.
Understand the different secure protocols commonly used for secure web communications.  
Be familiar with the basics of SSL and HTTPS and how these protocols can aid with 
securing browser-based communications. Realize that these protocols are commonly used 
to secure login to websites and other activities on the Internet, such as email access.
Be familiar with public key infrastructure (PKI) concepts.  Although PKI increases 
administration overhead compared to other network security methods, it provides a very 
secure network infrastructure. Know the basic components that make up the PKI, including 
the certifi cate authority (CA), digital certifi cates, revocation lists, and entities (servers, 
computers, mobile devices, users, routers, and so on). A PKI infrastructure will build secure 
communications with devices that were previously not authorized. 
Understand physical media encryption.   Know the differences between the different types 
of media encryption, including full disk encryption, block-level encryption, folder and 
fi le-level encryption, and removable media encryption. Understand the security risks of 
unencrypted removable media such as USB fl ash drives.

In modern day business operations, IT security is no longer 
optional. Businesses that do not make a reasonable effort to 
secure their own and their customers’ data are considered to 
be negligent and can be liable for damages to third parties.
Not only must business decision makers take ownership of external threats to the 
organization, they must also ensure that authorized parties within the business are not 
using confi dential fi nancial and personal data for illicit gain, monetarily or otherwise. 
More than ever, IT security operations teams will be at the forefront of ensuring effec-
tive business continuity as the reliance on electronic transmission mechanisms has 
become almost absolute.
The use of mobile devices has added an additional, highly complex variable to the mix 
because regulators do not see any difference between data breaches on corporate-owned 
machines or those on personal devices that employees also use for work purposes. Some 
organizations have opted to completely lock down and prohibit the use of mobile devices. 
However, the advantages of being able to support operations regardless of location is driv-
ing businesses to fi nd acceptable ways to allow the use of mobile devices while at the same 
time providing reasonable controls around sensitive data.
In this chapter, we will look at the different options that are currently available to pro-
vide security controls for mobile devices and that are in line with longstanding preferences 
to help secure the corporate network as a whole. 
Not all organizations will require every single control mentioned here, nor should they 
limit themselves to only the options that follow. Yet, in order to maintain high levels of 
trust with business partners and to maintain a modern security operations team that can 
cope with a constantly fl uctuating external environment, all of these tools and strategies 
should defi nitely be considered as solutions to gaps uncovered during regularly recurring 
security audits.
Device Compliance and Report 
Audit Information
To ensure device compliance and to be able to report meaningful audit information, the 
key starting point is to have a robust mobile device asset inventory. This entails having a 
detailed record of every corporate-issued mobile device that includes (but is not limited to) 

Device Compliance and Report Audit Information  
603
device characteristics, location, currently entrusted user and permissions, and current secu-
rity software as well as proof of compliance with federal and state regulations in regulated 
environments. In some cases this also includes having full device encryption as well as other 
safeguards that would prevent unauthorized customer or patient data from being accessed 
by third parties if the device were to be lost. 
Asset inventories must be reviewed on a periodic basis to ensure that not only is the data 
accurate but also the level of device permissions and the distribution of the devices them-
selves are appropriate and consistent with a valid business case. Internal audits performed 
by employees that are not part of the immediate security team can help uncover a host of 
resolvable compliance concerns well before they become eyesores on an external third-
party report.
Security and compliance teams should also be aware of specifi c reporting requirements 
mandated by Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX), HIPAA/HITECH, GLBA, and similar regulations 
and organizations. In the case of healthcare data, large breaches or loss of devices that con-
tain patient data must be quickly reported to Health and Human Services’s Offi ce of Civil 
Rights (OCR). Failure to do so has resulted in fi nes ranging from hundreds of thousands 
to millions of dollars. Even the loss of a single thumb drive can generate large penalties, 
despite the fact that it may not be certain that any sensitive data was contained on the 
device in the fi rst place. Unless an organization can provide documentation that proves 
compliance, it will have to be prepared for some form of punitive action if it loses sensitive 
data within a regulated environment.
With so many regulations affecting handling of confidential information 
at both the federal and state levels, security teams can quickly feel over-
whelmed, especially when mobile devices are thrown in the mix. While it 
is okay to provide a level of data security that surpasses what is required 
in a particular state, a lower level is not acceptable, even if it is in line with 
federal guidelines. This can be especially cumbersome for organizations 
that have operations in different states and are handling sensitive data 
across state lines. To simplify security operations, a good rule of thumb is 
to implement security and compliance initiatives based on what is required 
by the federal government in conjunction with the strictest state laws. 
While many states do not currently have laws on the books that protect 
personally identifiable information (PII) or other sensitive data, many do or 
are in the process of developing such requirements. A proactive approach 
will help avoid being blindsided by ever more stringent expectations 
around the handling of data, even when it’s being accessed on corporate 
mobile devices.

Chapter 17 ■ Security Requirements, Monitoring, and Reporting
Third-Party Device Monitoring 
Applications (SIEM)
Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools are a combination of two 
older technologies known as Security Event Management (SEM) and Security Information 
Management (SIM). A SIEM system is designed to digest the sea of log and network data 
that an organization produces on a daily basis into actionable information that can be used 
to improve an organization’s security posture. It is also used to gain awareness of emerging 
threats in the enterprise environment. 
The amount of log and network data produced by most organizations is beyond what 
most security teams would be able to review and analyze on a daily basis. Also, many secu-
rity threats today can be detected only when multiple events are occurring in a certain com-
bination, in separate locations, which is impossible to correlate in real time on a manual 
basis. The role of SIEM is to analyze large sets of network data and security logs to fi nd 
security-relevant events that otherwise would not be detected. 
Modern SIEM systems rely on the same tools and techniques used by big data  analytical 
warehouses. Therefore, many are simply add-ons to broader searching and reporting 
devices that can provide much more business intelligence than simply tracking security 
events and correlations.
Before SIEM technology was widely available, it would take a security team months 
to fi nd out how their organization was breached, with little ability to even determine for 
a fact what the actual intent of the attackers was. In most cases, they would not even 
have known that they had been breached at all unless they had been tipped off by a third 
party. SIEM technologies allow modern-day security teams to respond in real time and in 
some cases locate who or what is actually attempting to compromise their network while 
it is occurring. 
Yet, SIEM systems have their downsides as well. Capturing and storing every log fi le 
from every device, as well as every packet that traverses the wire, is usually not possible 
outside of major government entities. Therefore, security analysts must spend a signifi cant 
amount of time defi ning rules and correlations that are actually relevant to their environ-
ment. Otherwise, they will quickly fi nd that they are unable to capture the data effectively, 
much less use it effectively in any way, and retention capabilities will be extremely limited. 
Some SIEM systems can make use of Layer 2 Berkeley Packet Filters. This 
greatly enhances the ability to rapidly sift through large amounts of data 
and allows inspection points to handle much higher traffic loads. Also, be 
aware of the advantages of SIEM systems that have a Hadoop-based, big 
data architecture over those that still rely on a traditional database model. 
The former will provide much faster query speeds and will allow the secu-
rity team to investigate and respond in a near real-time fashion.

Understanding Mobile Device Log Files 
605
Security analysts must have some understanding of what the specifi c alerts actually 
mean and the possibility of false positives. SIEM technology is still not Plug and Play and 
requires extensive user involvement. Poorly deployed and operationalized SIEM systems 
produce an unwieldy amount of security alerts that are eventually ignored, giving the orga-
nization no better security footing than before.
Provisioning adequate storage is an integral part of a successful SIEM 
deployment. During the vendor selection process, it is important to discuss 
what the data retention requirements are from the business and the ability 
of the solution to actually provide functionality within those requirements.
Many SIEM solutions cannot adequately handle extremely large amounts of data across 
extended time frames (over 90 days). Being able to store fi ve years of security log events is 
of no use if it takes months to query the data.
Corporate legal teams can become extremely frustrated when they realize that the 
effort to extract relevant data from the SIEM solution can be in excess of what’s at stake in 
 ongoing litigation.
Understanding Mobile Device Log Files
As with any computing resource, log fi les can provide a wealth of information for trouble-
shooting purposes as well as aid in security investigations. While it is defi nitely unwieldy 
and unnecessary to manipulate mobile device log fi les on the actual mobile device, there are 
excellent tools on the market that can aid in collecting and working with these log fi les in a 
desktop environment. 
It is important to realize that log collection will differ between Android and iOS devices. 
Apple provides the iPhone Confi guration Utility for free on its support website. There are 
similar tools for Android that allow for remote log collection by emailing the logs to a speci-
fi ed mailbox, among other options. While no specifi c tool will be endorsed here, new apps 
that provide Android log analysis are popping up all the time. As with any application, the 
tool should be vetted and researched before it’s adopted to avoid introducing a potential secu-
rity risk. Special caution should be exercised with any security tool being distributed for free.
At the moment, most logging for mobile devices is oriented around application debug-
ging and not security use cases. When mobile devices are interacting with the corporate 
network, the security logs from the network devices will in many cases provide much more 
robust and usable data that will allow the security team to extrapolate potential issues 
emerging from the mobile devices themselves. 
For example, while it may be expected that a mobile device might access corporate resources 
at odd hours, it may not be normal for the device to be downloading large amounts of data 
from corporate shares or to be doing so from locations far from where the user is based. 

606 
Chapter 17 ■ Security Requirements, Monitoring, and Reporting
Log files produce a wealth of useful data, but it can be extremely 
time consuming to analyze and take action on it. This difficulty is 
compounded when your security team does not have any specialized 
resources for mobile device and application security. One way to 
alleviate the load is to integrate log events and correlations into a SIEM 
solution. This will allow real-time alerting when an immediate response 
is required and permit non–mobile security specialists to stay on top of 
emerging threats.
Mitigation Strategies
An entire book could be dedicated to just a slice of the threats that are in the wild at the 
moment. Most enterprises would rather focus their time on what tools and processes can be 
implemented to mitigate the security risks of corporate use of mobile devices. Thankfully, 
many of the mitigation strategies available are extensions of options that help secure tradi-
tional networks and can be easily understood and operated by most experienced security 
professionals. 
In the following sections, I will go over many different security controls that not only 
secure your mobile footprint but also strengthen your network security posture. This may 
seem like a lot to chew on, but many of the security controls have capabilities that overlap 
because most organizations are driving vendors to develop unifi ed security tools for their 
most pressing security needs.
Antivirus
Antivirus (AV) technology has become a bread and butter item for nearly every  enterprise 
security team in the world. Very simply, a virus is an executable computer code that 
 produces unwanted and in many cases malicious results for the end user. Although the line 
between viruses, malware, and spyware is becoming increasingly blurry, AV software is 
designed to detect signatures or patterns associated with known viruses in the wild. Most 
vendors today also offer at least some capability to detect morphs of older viruses as well 
as brand-new ones. This is due to the fact that AV software relies on not only known mali-
cious signatures but also known patterns of malicious behavior. 
Antivirus software usually has two main tiers of virus detection and prevention. A real-
time component runs in the background to detect and remediate threats as they occur, and 
a scanning tool can be used on internal and external hard drives, as well as other devices 
that can be connected to a workstation, for on-demand virus scanning. Additionally, AV 
will monitor volatile memory (RAM) during normal use as well as the boot sector during 
system startup. USB keys, SD cards, external hard disks, and similar storage devices are the 
biggest culprit of transmission of boot sector viruses.

Mitigation Strategies 
607
One of the biggest problems with AV is the number of systems that are behind in 
their virus defi nition fi les. While there is some possibility that a virus will be caught 
even when AV software and associated virus defi nition fi les are old, the chance of being 
infected by an advanced viral attack increases as time passes and no updates are made. 
At a minimum, virus defi nitions should be updated daily, with real-time updates being 
preferred. Many virus outbreaks can be traced to the fact that even though the worksta-
tions and servers did have AV software running on them, their virus defi nitions were well 
out-of-date.
Software Firewalls
Software fi rewalls have long been included in server and desktop operating systems. They 
are designed to prevent network-based intrusions coming from the outside network as well 
as to prevent malicious code from using the person’s PC as a platform for launching attacks 
on other machines in the same LAN or beyond. 
While the software fi rewall included with your OS may be suffi cient for home use, most 
large organizations have preferred more comprehensive managed endpoint protection solu-
tions that combine an enterprise class software fi rewall with antivirus and anti-malware 
capabilities. The advantage of this solution is the additional capability to detect end-user 
threats as they occur as well as the ability to isolate locations that may be serving as a 
launching pad for attacks to the rest of the network. Blocking the threats as they happen is 
important, but identifying the root causes and eliminating them before they can materialize 
again is just as critical. 
Software fi rewalls are also available for mobile devices. They can provide many of the 
same functions offered for desktop environments as well as some additional options specifi c 
to mobile devices. One frequent use case is to use mobile software fi rewalls to restrict appli-
cation access to the network unless given explicit authorization. This prevents an appli-
cation that was installed by the user but is not currently known to be entirely safe from 
reaching out to other devices or downloading additional code from the Internet. Another 
option specifi cally geared toward devices with mobile phone capabilities is to block the 
device from sending or receiving spam SMS messages. 
Before implementing any software-based firewall or other security appli-
cation that includes a software-based firewall to mobile devices, be sure 
to perform extensive front-end user acceptance testing (UAT). As with any 
application, system resources will be consumed, and an excellent solution 
from the security team’s perspective may be untenable from the user’s 
perspective in terms of a degraded user experience and inferior mobile 
system performance.

608 
Chapter 17 ■ Security Requirements, Monitoring, and Reporting
Access Levels
Access levels control what users on your network are able to visualize. From a fi le system 
perspective, this includes the ability to access and open fi les on the corporate network. 
From a device perspective, this can include the ability to view fi rewall rules, incident data, 
or any other system parameters associated with a security device. Access levels can restrict 
which devices can be accessed as well as what data within the device a user can look at. 
An example of this would be to allow a security user access to a data loss prevention 
console that presents incident data only from the particular business unit that the user has 
responsibility over, such as HR. Incident data from Legal would be accessible only to the 
security user assigned to that particular team.
Such access-level restrictions allow for a clear separation of duties within and across 
security tools. In the previous example, the fi rst user would not be viewing sensitive inci-
dent data of other business units and would not be able to use their credentials to make 
changes on the corporate fi rewalls because access is specifi c to the data loss  prevention 
toolset. 
If the employee left the company under less-than-favorable terms, the exposure to risk 
has been minimized. If the individual wished to cause harm to the organization, the tools 
they accessed and the data within them was limited only to what was essential within the 
person’s job function.  
Employee access to corporate resources should be audited on a regular basis, and 
terminated employees should have their access to electronic resources revoked immediately. 
When a standard process for this does not exist, it is not uncommon to fi nd users with 
access to sensitive system resources for weeks or even months after they have departed. 
While in the overwhelming majority of cases, the user will not make use of these privileges 
once gone, it does not make sense to leave the door open to such risks.
Be wary of users logging in under generic administrator accounts that are 
not associated with a specific account holder. Not only does this obfus-
cate who actually was logged into the account, it makes it much harder 
to perform forensic investigations of who viewed and modified system 
resources and files when multiple people were using the same username. 
Permissions
Permissions govern what actions the user can actually perform on a server fi le system or 
a device’s resources on the corporate network. For example, a user may have an access 
level that allows them to view what fi rewalls are on the network or what rule sets are 
being run but at the same time not have suffi cient permissions to actually modify the 
rules on them.

Mitigation Strategies 
609
File system and device owners usually have the highest level of permissions and have the 
ability to delegate certain permissions to other users. Some users may be given full adminis-
trative access to systems, minus the ability to manage other users, and others may simply be 
given the ability to manage and monitor certain aspects of these systems. 
As with access levels, users should have only the level of permissions necessary to per-
form their current job role. When users are terminated or change roles within the organiza-
tion, these permissions should be reviewed and terminated or modifi ed, depending on the 
specifi c situation.
It is important to be wary of allowing multiple security and network teams to have 
administrative permissions over security devices. This may lead to system confi guration 
changes that are not wholly benefi cial for all parties involved. Each security device should 
have clear ownership, and changes should be made by following a standardized change 
control process. 
Similar precautions should be taken with fi les and fi le systems. Critical information 
should be locked from being deleted or modifi ed, and users should not be able to edit sensi-
tive information without prior explicit authorization. For example, employees may be given 
permission to view their own HR fi les but not be given permission to modify them.
Auditing user access levels and permissions manually on file systems is 
all but impossible in a large organization. Thankfully, there are tools on 
the market that can help automate the process and even help identify 
users that may have permissions that go well beyond their job role. More 
advanced products can even tie in to data loss prevention tools to help 
security teams determine if individuals have accessed or modified sensi-
tive data when they should not have. 
Host-Based and Network-Based IDS/IPS
IDS and IPS stand for intrusion detection system and intrusion prevention systems, respectively. 
They can be located as network devices within the corporate LAN, DMZ, or network perim-
eter. They can even be located directly on endpoint devices as software-based security tools.
Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are designed to simply detect possible malicious 
incursions into a network. While many fi rewalls today incorporate some form of IDS 
capabilities, an IDS does not necessarily have to be part of a fi rewall deployment and can 
be a separate stand-alone device. As the name implies, IDSs are not expected to block or 
respond to malicious traffi c in any way but rather just monitor and audit suspected and 
known attack signatures and behavior. One of the biggest diffi culties with IDSs is the fact 
that network traffi c across one segment may seem to be innocuous in isolation but can be 
deemed to be dangerous when taken into context with other points on the network. SIEM 
software can pick up the slack in this regard, by correlating activity across the network 
with known bad behavior.

610 
Chapter 17 ■ Security Requirements, Monitoring, and Reporting
Intrusion prevention systems (IPSs) are usually an add-on or extension to IDSs and 
provide an actual response to potentially dangerous traffi c. This can include closing con-
nections or access to certain exposed ports in addition to alerting the security team in real 
time of what is going on. 
Software-based IDS and IPS systems located on endpoints are usually referred to as 
HIDS and HIPS, where the H stands for host-based. These can be installed on desktops, 
laptops, servers, mobile devices, and virtual devices. They are usually bundled with anti-
malware and antivirus tools and serve as the last line of defense against traffi c going both 
to and from the network. They are also especially useful for traffi c traveling between end-
points within the same LAN where an intermediary IDS/IPS may not be located. 
Installing a network-based IDS and/or IPS will be fraught with issues if 
done on an unhealthy network. Network instability can overwhelm security 
administrators with false positives from the monitoring devices that incor-
rectly flag large numbers of dropped packets, session retransmits, and so 
on as a potential security risk. Before implementing any technology that 
will execute signature-based blocking of network traffic, significant threat 
analysis should be performed by the security team. A hasty implementa-
tion may result in the interruption of normal business and user activity. 
Integrated Wireless Intrusion Prevention System (WIPS) Sensor Analogy
A wireless intrusion prevention system (WIPS) is used with wireless networks and can 
consist of either an overlay system (dedicated sensors) or an integrated system (where 
the sensor is part of a wireless access point). Depending on the sensor/access point 
conﬁ guration, if an integrated WIPS solution is used, it may share radio time with wire-
less devices that are accessing the wireless network and only passively scan the air part 
time. Think about this analogy. An after-hours security ofﬁ cer is sitting at a desk watch-
ing the security monitors for any unauthorized access or other activities that could be a 
security violation. The ofﬁ cer hears a noise down the hall and leaves his post to inves-
tigate. Because he has stepped away from the desk, he cannot be watching the security 
 monitors. Therefore, an unauthorized person may be able to enter the area without being 
noticed by the security ofﬁ cer. This is similar to the way a wireless access point that is a 
part-time integrated WIPS sensor and that is servicing wireless client devices may not be 
able to see and detect potential WIPS violations. For example, if the wireless access point 
is providing Voice over Wireless LAN (VoWLAN) access, because of QoS features, the 
access point will prioritize the wireless voice frames and may forgo the WIPS monitoring. 
This will result in the WIPS server not being able to capture potential wireless intrusions 
or other wireless security violations. 

Mitigation Strategies 
611
Anti-Malware
Malware is computing software that, when run, unbeknownst to the end user, could 
harm the user’s privacy or fi nancial security or could subject the user to participation in 
damages to third parties without consent, among many other negative purposes. While 
the broader defi nition of malware would also include viruses and any software that runs 
malicious and/or undesired operations on a user’s device, a more restricted view will be 
taken here.
One well-known form of malware is a key logger. This kind of software runs in the 
background, captures user input as it is performed, and transmits the data to a third party. 
It is an excellent tool for stealing passwords, which can later be used for unauthorized 
access to personal email, banking, and social media. 
Once the bane of the desktop world, key loggers are now making their way to mobile 
devices. For mobile devices, the easiest way to install a key logger is to fi rst have actual 
 possession of the device. This means that users should be wary about sharing their corpo-
rate-issued device with third parties and make sure their device has a complex password for 
access. Additionally, users may be tricked through email to install a key-logger onto their 
device along with another seemingly legitimate application. Once it’s installed, they will 
not realize that the program is even running. 
Mobile devices have also become prime targets for groups wishing to leverage 
 distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. The number of mobile devices worldwide 
has eclipsed that of traditional laptops and desktops, with computing power that is not 
too far behind.
Combine this with the fact that most mobile users are not as proactive with their mobile 
device security as they are with their PCs, yet at the same time they have these mobile 
devices connected to the Internet on an “always on” basis, resulting in billions of poten-
tially victimized devices for use as part of botnets and groups of zombies.
Another fairly recent addition to the world of mobile malware are executables that con-
sume mobile resources for the purpose of virtual currency mining. This puts an enormous 
strain on the device’s CPU and memory while simultaneously draining battery life at a 
higher than usual rate. 
With these and other forms of malware, the so-called “human fi rewall” is the fi rst line 
of defense. Users should be made aware of the inherent risks of downloading mobile appli-
cations from untrusted publishers. If possible, corporate devices should be locked down so 
that applications that have not been tested and approved by IT security cannot be installed 
onto the device. 
At the moment, there are also software packages that can be purchased for mobile 
devices that address a wide breadth of malware as well as virus issues. They can ensure 
that the user can browse in relative safety while alerting the user of any unusual attempts 
for access to personal data on the mobile device. While any constantly running application 
will affect device performance, the state of currently marketed mobile devices may make 
such an impact seem negligible to the end user. Along with user education, anti-malware 
and antivirus software are as much a must for mobile devices today as they are for desk-
tops and laptops.

Chapter 17 ■ Security Requirements, Monitoring, and Reporting
Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
Data loss prevention (DLP), also known as data leak prevention, is based on the function-
ality of content-aware reverse fi rewalls. In other words, instead of focusing on external 
threats that can be mitigated with antivirus software, traditional fi rewalls, and so on, DLP 
is designed to prevent the loss of sensitive data from within an enterprise division or from 
the enterprise itself.
DLP has been of great interest in recent years as organizations are now maturing from 
ensuring the secure transit of data to also ensuring that the recipient of the data is autho-
rized. For example, a fi le containing credit-card data can be delivered securely by email 
with TLS encryption. But if the fi le is going to a member of organized crime for later unau-
thorized use and resale, it is unlikely that the enterprise that had custody of the data would 
be comfortable knowing that such an event had occurred. 
Regulatory compliance has also been a key driver of DLP initiatives. Large, publicly 
traded organizations are required to do everything in their power to prevent the leak-
age of nonpublic fi nancial data that could be used for illicit fi nancial gain. Healthcare 
entities are now required to ensure that private health information is not disclosed to 
unauthorized third parties. Manufacturing companies are now on the hook to make 
sure that no sensitive technological information is shared with certain blacklisted coun-
tries and organizations.
Security teams must be aware of local privacy laws when deploying DLP in 
foreign locations. While acceptable in the United States, DLP usage is ille-
gal in some countries, even when the data is traversing the corporate net-
work using corporately owned devices. Worldwide deployments require a 
country-by-country analysis to ensure that implemented controls do not 
exceed what local law allows.
Three types of components are particularly useful in dealing with data loss prevention: 
data in motion (DIM), data in use (DIU), and data at rest (DAR).
Data in motion (DIM) considers all data that is traversing network components, regard-
less of whether the components are located internally or are external to the network. 
Commonly monitored protocols include those that center on email, web traffi c, FTP, 
instant messaging (IM), and peer-to-peer fi le sharing. 
Data in use (DIU) monitors every action a user is taking as they view and manipulate 
data on a workstation, regardless of whether it is a physical or virtual instance. Normally, 
DIU requires that an agent, or software tool that is running in the background, be enabled 
for monitoring. Most organizations want DLP to be a nontransparent control, or in other 
words they want DLP monitoring to be known by the end users. This alone reduces poten-
tial incidents by over 90 percent because users modify their behavior once they know they 
are being monitored. While it is possible for an end user to completely disable an endpoint 
agent, most vendors have implemented controls that prevent this from occurring or that 
 re-enable the agent within a brief time. 

Mitigation Strategies 
613
The endpoint agent will monitor and/or prevent users from moving sensitive data to 
fi le shares, DVD/CD drives, SD cards, USB keys and hard drives, printers, and almost 
any device that physically connects to a workstation. It will additionally monitor all the 
protocols that are being monitored by DIM components, providing a kind of data loss 
defense in depth. More granular controls can even monitor and block users from copy-
ing sensitive data from one fi le and moving it to another. Some solutions also have the 
ability to provide DAR scanning at the workstation level. DAR is discussed later in this 
section. 
Android phones have been a sticking point for most DLP vendors because the way 
Android mounts its storage drive when plugged into a workstation (it appears to be an 
internal drive) confuses the DLP agent. Although DLP vendors are aware of the issue and 
are working toward a solution, this should be a consideration taken by the security team 
when deploying a DLP solution in an environment where users may be physically moving 
data to their phones. 
Data at rest (DAR) is an asynchronous monitoring component that scans internal fi le 
shares, databases, and other systems that provide data warehousing and storage for sensi-
tive data that may be located in unsecure locations. DAR scanning tools can go beyond 
simple auditing and can be set up to automatically delete or move fi les to a secure location 
upon discovery. They can even leave a “ransom note” placeholder fi le that alerts the user as 
to what action was taken with the now-moved fi le.
Setting up a large DLP deployment requires taking into account geo-
graphic scalability. Servers handling DAR are best located near the actual 
file servers and databases to be scanned, and endpoint management serv-
ers should be near the actual endpoints being managed. While alternate 
configurations are possible, they come at the cost of higher loads on WAN 
link traffic.
DLP for mobile devices has been deployed with varying levels of success by current DLP 
vendors. A mobile device management system is a must, and in many cases some form of 
VPN access to the corporate environment is required as well. While it is possible to have a 
DLP agent running on tablets, phones, and other mobile components, this will impact the 
users’ experience as it consumes system resources. The level of noticeable impact depends 
on a combination of factors, including what programs the user is actively running as well 
as the CPU, memory, and other hardware specifi cations. Developing a DLP agent with iOS 
has proven to be especially diffi cult due to inherent issues with integrating monitoring soft-
ware with the iOS operating system.
Figure 17.1 illustrates a simplifi ed DLP architecture for mobile deployments. In this 
situation, the end user is located off site and is sending emails, browsing the Internet, and 
 performing other online activities while on the corporate VPN. The end user is either 
directly connected to a nearby Wi-Fi hotspot or accessing data through a mobile phone 
 provider’s nearest cell tower and has established an end-to-end VPN SSL tunnel from 
the mobile device to the corporate VPN concentrators, using the public Internet as a 
 transmission medium.

As seen in Figure 17.1, all inbound and outbound traffi c passes through a data loss 
prevention network monitoring server, which usually is sitting as close as possible to the 
network egress point without actually facing the public Internet (which would overwhelm 
the server with uninteresting traffi c). The monitoring device will audit any instances where 
users attempt to move sensitive data out to the public Internet. It is usually limited to 
HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP protocols, although any and all protocols can be audited at the 
discretion of the local security team.
Additionally, a mobile device management (MDM) server is usually a requirement for 
successful deployment of mobile DLP. An MDM server is responsible for maintaining the 
proper confi guration of managed mobile devices. In the past MDM servers would sit in the 
DMZ, but current options include having a dedicated SSL off-loader that permits locating 
the MDM server within the relative security of the internal corporate network. 

Mitigation Strategies 
615
While many DLP deployments begin by only monitoring for the movement of sensitive 
data, over time real-time blocking, notifi cation, and remediation is possible as well. For 
example, a corporation that allows its users to use Facebook, discussions forums, and other 
social media tools can not only discover when sensitive data is being posted, they can also 
block the posting from even occurring in the fi rst place as well as notifying the user and 
other interested parties of the violating activity. 
Although DLP tools have come a long way and have achieved a high level of capability 
and maturity, most organizations are unable to leverage these capabilities in any signifi cant 
way. DLP requires a great deal of business buy-in from units outside of enterprise security 
in terms of identifying what actually is sensitive content as well as how policies should be 
enforced. Plus, it can be a challenge to even determine which federal and state regulations 
are the most critical to adhere to because companies that previously did not have DLP are 
ill-equipped to enforce everything at once.
Many DLP deployments fail because the enterprise decides to monitor a quantity of data 
that cannot be reasonably analyzed by team members or remediated by relevant parties 
in the business. It is recommendable to deploy both DLP policy and components in small 
stages that can help provide sample data that can be used to later adjust subsequent phases 
of a larger company-wide rollout. 
Many vendors claim that their security device (email gateway, mail server 
security appliance, firewall, and so on) has the added benefit of providing 
DLP capabilities. Be wary of these claims. Many can only provide so much 
as “DLP-Lite” or simple pattern matching on strings of numbers and certain 
phrases, and on only a certain threat vector such as email. In some cases, 
these add-ons are as expensive as a dedicated DLP product suite, especially 
when the customer does not take the time to do their research and negoti-
ate an appropriate price. While these tools may be a sufficient substitute 
when a full-suite DLP solution is not required, or affordable, it is important 
to ensure that a specific DLP use case has been defined before engaging 
product vendors. Otherwise, the organization may end up purchasing capa-
bilities that are not needed, or come up short on critical regulatory compli-
ance requirements, along with the additional burden of having to monitor 
different DLP toolsets located on different devices. If you are planning a 
mobile deployment that requires DLP monitoring, verify that the DLP ven-
dor being used or the product to be purchased has an actual working solu-
tion that addresses mobile. They may claim that it is under development 
and will be “coming soon,” but “soon” may be years away.
Device Hardening
Device hardening is the practice of reducing an attacker’s possible approach vectors into a 
mobile device. This includes not only keeping device applications to a minimum but also 
turning off communication protocols and ports when they are not explicitly necessary. A 
good practice is to turn off unnecessary wireless communications such as GPS, Wi-Fi, and 
Bluetooth when possible. This is a good security measure, and it will extend battery life as 

616 
Chapter 17 ■ Security Requirements, Monitoring, and Reporting
well, especially on older devices. Additionally, if Bluetooth is to be kept on, the ability of 
the device to be discoverable should be turned off. Also, it is important to ensure that any 
data on the device is in the hands of only authorized users.
Data usage of mobile devices should be monitored on a periodic basis. If there is an 
unusual spike in network bandwidth consumption after installing a particular mobile 
application, review what access the application has to the network as well as the functions 
it should be performing. Corporate IT security should be made aware if any mobile appli-
cation is behaving erratically because the root cause may be a security as well as an appli-
cation development issue. Instead of reviewing individual devices one by one, an option 
would be to export usage metrics to a SIEM or other log consumption and alerting tool. 
Other device hardening methods include strong passwords, multifactor authentication, 
and mobile device encryption. These methods have been discussed in previous sections of 
the text and will not be extensively reviewed here.
Regulations such as the Health Information Technology for Economic and 
Clinical Health Act (HITECH) consider data secure if it is either encrypted 
or destroyed. While throwing all mobile devices into a metal shredder will 
probably not be a reasonable option, pursuing a device encryption solu-
tion for all corporate devices should be. Though this may be an additional 
burden for users that access data using personal devices, noncompliance 
is not an option in regulated environments.
Physical Port Disabling
Physical port disabling is the closing of communication channels to external devices that 
may be connected to corporate computing resources such as desktops, laptops, and servers. 
This includes shutting down access to external USB storage media, CD/DVD burners, SD 
cards, mobile devices connected through a physical interface, or any other device that may 
be used to ingress/egress data into the corporate network through an endpoint location.
Special care should be taken that any physical port lockdown does not affect tools that 
are used on a daily basis by the business. For example, a full lockdown of external hard-
drive access through USB may be feasible, but a full closure of all USB ports is probably 
not. The latter would probably shut down users’ ability to use external mouse and key-
board devices that currently integrate themselves through a USB connection.
As with any security control that affects end users and endpoint devices, a site survey 
should be conducted before implementation. In modern day healthcare settings, many diag-
nostic tools connect to physician laptops through a USB or peripheral device port. Other 
industries have similar use cases as well. 
Physical port disabling is usually an option that is included with most enterprise-class 
endpoint protection software suites. They offer granularity as to the type of ports to be 
blocked, specifi c devices to allow/disallow, and the enforcement of using encrypted media 
at a managed endpoint.  

Mitigation Strategies 
617
Firewall Settings
One of the most basic but effective fi rewall controls is to lock down unnecessary network 
communications ports and protocols, or ones that are associated with unproductive use of 
network resources. Specifi cally what these ports actually are depends on an understanding 
of current corporate policy regarding the use of electronic devices. For example, if the busi-
ness does not want employees to use an instant messaging (IM) client outside of a certain 
one, such as Microsoft Lync, it is possible to set the fi rewall to block all IM traffi c on every 
port except the one allowed. 
Modern-day fi rewalls also have the ability to block traffi c based on certain traffi c signa-
tures, regardless of what port is being used. In the past, users would attempt to circumvent 
the fi rewall by using a nonstandard port as a transmission medium for whatever prohibited 
tool or software package required network access. Security teams have long ago caught on 
to this and have at their disposal the tools to prevent such usage. 
While on the surface it may sound reasonable to block all IM, peer-to-peer fi le  sharing, 
social media, and audio and video hosting websites, it is important to investigate the reali-
ties of the business before enabling fi ltering at the fi rewall level. While access to social 
media and video hosting websites may seem like a huge productivity drain for the enter-
prise, they may be a critical part of the fi rm’s marketing activities. Shutting down stream-
ing audio may seem like a no-brainer, but it’s defi nitely not the way to go if the CEO thinks 
it helps people concentrate on their work. Always make sure to communicate to the busi-
ness the total impact of any proposed security settings in order to avoid misunderstandings 
down the road.
While fi rewalls are excellent security controls in themselves, they do not liberate the 
enterprise from ensuring that the design of the network itself is inherently secure. This 
includes making sure sensitive network traffi c is segmented from nonsensitive traffi c, 
making use of VLANs to provide an additional layer of isolation between departments, 
and so forth. 
While most modern network security devices that have firewall capabilities 
come with some level of out-of-the-box capabilities, this does not obviate 
the need for firewall administrators to review deployed polices in the light 
of business requirements.
Many business leaders make the mistake of thinking that having a fi rewall is the equiva-
lent of having a secure corporate network. The security requirements of a segment handling 
Payment Card Industry (PCI) data is going to be vastly different than a segment that is set 
aside for public Wi-Fi access.
Even when not required by law, it is advisable to have regular internal and, if possible, 
third-party audits and reviews of currently enforced policies on fi rewalls and other network 
security devices. In some cases it may be found that a fi rewall is passively passing through 
all traffi c with no enforcement at all!

618 
Chapter 17 ■ Security Requirements, Monitoring, and Reporting
Port Configuration
Outside of fi rewalls, other networking devices can also provide an additional layer of secu-
rity through port confi guration. Network switches and routers can be confi gured to disal-
low any communication on selected TCP or UDP ports deemed unnecessary or dangerous 
to the organization. 
Port confi guration stops potentially harmful traffi c well before it even reaches a fi rewall 
or other network security device. Even endpoints can be confi gured to enforce a certain 
level of port confi guration. 
Nevertheless, since it is a protocol and not a signature or technology based on security 
intelligence, security teams may end up blocking traffi c that is in no way malicious simply 
because it is attempting to access a locked-down port. 
Unless it has been clearly established that a certain port will have no business use case 
and its existence is a potential risk to the organization, it is often better to rely on other 
tools such as traditional fi rewalls and IDS/IPS technology before implementing port 
 confi guration on network communication points.
Application Sandboxing
Sandboxing in the context of a mobile environment usually refers to running applications 
in an isolated portion of the OS; the entire application and all related fi les have no interac-
tion with other fi les and executables on the mobile device. 
While such an arrangement is excellent for testing purposes or for applications that will 
never require interaction with user information and system fi les, in most cases a completely 
airtight environment for code execution is not an option because it greatly degrades the 
user’s experience. 
Nevertheless, security teams also have the option to execute and test production-ready 
applications in a sandboxed environment to detect if any malicious code has been attached 
to the executable content well before it is used in the fi eld.
One caveat to be aware of with application sandboxing is that some types of 
advanced malware can actually detect if it is being run in a sandboxed environment 
and withhold from performing any malicious activity while in the sandbox. This can be 
especially frustrating for security teams, who may unwillingly deem malicious software 
as being “safe” when actual behavior will be radically different once it is in the user 
environment.  
With newer versions of Android and iOS, application sandboxing capabili-
ties have been improved to only permit applications to access the files 
and OS processes that are critical for the proper functionality of the appli-
cation, shutting the door on the possibility that a rogue application may 
exploit vulnerable system processes and file systems. 

Mitigation Strategies 
619
A best practice would be to ensure that mobile users have access to updated and more 
secure mobile operating systems as they are released. For users who refuse or are unable to 
upgrade personal devices, a good policy is to not allow access to sensitive corporate data 
through them if they present a risk of data exposure or loss.
Business decision makers should always remember that, regardless of the level of security 
imposed on mobile, any use of third-party applications has an associated risk, and func-
tionality in many cases will diminish as the level of security imposed increases. Striking an 
acceptable balance is more of an art than a proven science. 
Trusted Platform Modules
Trusted platform modules (TPMs) are physical devices that are located on a motherboard 
with the specifi c function of acting as a secure location for encryption keys. As a unique 
physical device, usually in the form of a secure microprocessor, a TPM can offer a much 
higher level of security than software-based solutions alone. 
Although TPMs are widespread in desktops and laptops, they are a fairly recent arrival 
in the world of mobile. Recently, Microsoft has incorporated TPMs in its mobile offerings, 
but other vendors have been slower to bring the technology to market. 
TPM technology still has many issues to overcome and is defi nitely not a “silver  bullet” 
for companies that are coping with employees using personal devices for work. One of 
the biggest issues is the fact that because it is a physical control attached to the device, the 
enterprise in essence cannot control it in any way.
Nevertheless, security teams managing mobile devices can expect more vendors to offer 
TPM capabilities and subsequently the opportunity to leverage them into a potentially 
more secure handling of corporate data on personal devices through better encryption key 
technology.
Data Containers
Data containers can mean a host of different things in computing. In the case of securing 
mobile devices, it represents a school of thought that wishes to avoid the monumental task 
of ensuring the security of the device as a whole, whether personal or company issued. 
Instead, it focuses on securing only the corporate data on the device as well as maintaining 
control and ownership of it.
To this end, numerous security vendors are currently offering tools that allow users 
to view and manipulate corporate data securely because it is isolated from other data 
on the device. Additionally, these tools allow security teams to remotely wipe the secure 
data container when a user leaves the organization or when otherwise instructed by 
management without affecting other data on the device or requiring physical access to 
the device itself.

620 
Chapter 17 ■ Security Requirements, Monitoring, and Reporting
Content Filtering
If a mobile device is managed and connected to the corporate network, there are many 
existing web and email fi ltering tools on the market that can be leveraged to provide con-
tent fi ltering to them.
Web fi ltering tools provide the ability to block or restrict access to sites based on a wide 
variety of factors. Currently, most vendors keep up-to-date categorizations of websites that 
host malicious code and/or are part of phishing scams. Instead of having security teams 
worrying about reacting to these threats as they are discovered by end users, many web 
fi ltering tools provide website blacklists that are updated on a daily or in some cases a real-
time basis. Also, web fi ltering tools give security teams, in coordination with management, 
the ability to control access to websites that may be legal but not appropriate for viewing 
on corporate-issued devices. This includes websites for gambling, pornography, weapons, 
and hate speech and in some cases can even include access to social media, among many 
other possible options.
Email fi ltering tools such as email gateways have the ability to stop malicious or 
unwanted content from even being received by the mobile device, and they can also block 
mobile devices on the corporate network from sending undesired content. Email gateways 
primarily have the role of fi ltering viruses, spam, and other undesirable content attached 
within email from entering or leaving the corporate network. 
For an extra layer of security, there are also tools that provide these exact same capabili-
ties for the internal mail servers and relays. Email fi ltering on internal mail servers helps 
prevent mobile users from accidentally sharing malicious content from their mobile devices 
to desktop users in the corporate environment and vice versa. Some organizations go as far 
as to provide content fi lters on email as well as instant messaging for all managed devices, 
including mobile. An example of this would be a fi lter that prevents users from using 
 profane language in internal communication. 
Ultimately, while there is a plethora of out-of-the box content fi ltering controls available 
for web, email, and IM, it is up to corporate policy makers to determine what rules are 
appropriate for an organization. While some rules are benefi cial from a legal liability stand-
point, others are purely advisable from a company-culture point of view. It is not recom-
mendable for security teams to enforce such policies without buy-in and explicit direction 
from upper management. 
In many cases, DLP, web and email filtering tools, and firewalls overlap in 
capabilities. Instead of “defense in depth,” what are often seen are cases 
of redundancy and inefficient use of technical resources. Security teams, 
in conjunction with business decision makers, should periodically assess 
the tools and processes that are in place in order to rationalize existing 
deployments. 

Mitigation Strategies 
621
Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)
A demilitarized zone (DMZ) is an essential part of securing a corporate network. 
Connecting a device to the Internet will expose it to some form of attack within minutes. 
Most servers providing critical IT services would be unnecessarily exposed if they were 
directly linked to the WAN or Internet without any intermediate fi ltering and protection 
from enterprise fi rewalls.  
Currently, there are two basic confi gurations for setting up a DMZ. The fi rst, which 
is usually selected due to lower cost and is seen more often in smaller environments, 
involves setting up a single fi rewall that has three interfaces (see Figure 17.2). One 
is connected to the Internet, another to the internal corporate LAN, and another to 
the DMZ.

The main disadvantage of a single fi rewall solution is that if the fi rewall is compromised 
in any way, whether by an attack or due to hardware failure, both the DMZ and the inter-
nal corporate network may be at risk. Yet, this is defi nitely better than nothing at all and 
may suit the needs of a small or medium-sized business with limited ability and resources 
to set up and maintain the fi rewall.

622 
Chapter 17 ■ Security Requirements, Monitoring, and Reporting
The other option is to have two fi rewalls, one on the front end facing the Internet 
or WAN and another on the backend that is facing the internal corporate network 
(see Figure 17.3). This solution can be further augmented by having hot failovers to 
 secondary devices if the front-end or backend fi rewalls fail for any reason.

While using the same vendor for the fi rewalls would save costs and make maintenance 
simpler, many security professionals prefer to have different brands for the front ends and 
backends. The thinking is that if the front-end fi rewall is breached, the same attack vector 
will not be available on the backend, thus giving the security team enough time to respond 
and prevent an incursion into the internal network. 

Chapter Essentials 
623
Summary
This chapter provided a high-level overview of the security tools and concepts that IT 
security teams should be aware of, both in traditional deployments and in deployments 
involving mobile technologies. Device compliance and report audit information ensure that 
regardless of the level of enterprise IT security (or lack thereof), distribution of electronic 
assets is well documented and can be readily communicated to third parties when neces-
sary. SIEM technology provides excellent visibility into log events occurring across the net-
work as well as being a source of usable security analytics for business decision makers that 
may or may not have extensive technical know-how. In this same train of thought, mobile 
device logs are differentiated from logs that security teams are accustomed to using with 
other devices. Mobile application developers are aware of the need to provide better event 
data and mechanisms to relay this information back to the security team and their tools as 
newer and more sophisticated mobile log management applications are arriving onto the 
Android and iOS marketplaces.
The bulk of the chapter was dedicated to mitigation strategies, including fi rewalls, access 
levels, sandboxing, content fi ltering, port confi guration and disabling, DMZ, and more.
While the security tools and techniques in this chapter do not represent an exhaustive 
list of everything that is currently available, implementation of any or all of these measures 
will help drive the organization to a better IT security state. For those who wish to further 
their knowledge in this realm, a dedicated course in network security or security specifi c to 
mobile devices would be highly recommended. 
Chapter Essentials
Understand current technical controls that are available to mitigate IT security risks and 
sensitive data loss.  Content-aware controls include DLP and content fi ltering. Firewalls, 
both software and hardware based, provide network security. Permissions and access  levels 
are part of a larger identity and access management strategy. Antivirus, anti-malware, 
host-based IDS, and physical port disabling are generally offered under the same umbrella 
within an existing enterprise endpoint protection suite. Application sandboxing, trusted 
platform modules, and data containers are all emerging security technologies being applied 
to mobile devices.
Implement a secure architecture in your network design.  A DMZ can separate perimeter-
facing devices from the rest of the corporate network. The DMZ can be built with a single 
fi rewall for a basic level of security, or it can be designed using front- and backend fi rewalls 
with failovers for enterprise confi gurations. 

624 
Chapter 17 ■ Security Requirements, Monitoring, and Reporting
Understand your security team’s compliance obligations and ability to provide meaning-
ful data and reports to auditors.  Maintain a comprehensive asset inventory that includes 
mobile devices issued by the enterprise. Internal audits should be performed on a regular 
basis to avoid any surprises during mandated external audits. Regulated industries must 
provide compliance information in accordance with federal and/or state laws.
Understand mobile device log files.  Be aware that iOS and Android devices have distinct 
log management toolsets for working with and maintaining mobile device log fi les. While 
generally robust for debugging operations, mobile logs can still be extremely useful when 
analyzed in conjunction with other network security device logs.
Understand the Concept of SIEM.   SIEM technology allows security teams rapid log col-
lection and aggregation across multiple networks and network security devices. They allow 
for real-time security alerting and event correlation, well beyond what can be accomplished 
during manual security log review.

✓Restoring Data

When it comes to technology, there is no worse feeling than 
turning on an electronic device such as a computer, tablet, or 
smartphone and realizing it no longer functions. This is often 
the time when many people think about their backup, but it may be too late if the backup 
was not created or does not work. Backing up data and confi guration information is an 
essential part of all aspects of information technology, and mobile devices are no excep-
tion. In this chapter we will explore the concept of data backup and recovery solutions for 
both network servers and client or mobile device technology. This includes understanding 
common disaster recovery procedures, high availability, and backing up and restoring data 
for both the server side and the client device side. Think about the infl ux of bring your own 
device (BYOD) technology: both corporate and personal data must be taken into consider-
ation when it comes to backup and restore policies. This chapter will also provide an over-
view of the data restoration process.
Network Server and Mobile Device 
Backup
Protecting information on a computer network is an important component of computer 
network administration. Although it may not be a pleasant task, it is something that must 
be done to ensure the availability and integrity of stored data. In the early days of local 
area networking, aside from sharing printers, one main reason local area networks were 
installed was to provide a repository of user data that would be considered secure and 
always available or recoverable if necessary. For many, backing up data was considered 
a mundane task that often caused problems because of hardware or software incompat-
ibility and availability of the technology or lack thereof. How the corporate policy was 
implemented would determine the backup policy and procedures. Backup often occurred 
after hours at times when data was not accessed to lessen both the impact on the network’s 
resources and performance degradation. For the client device side, usually a software pro-
gram known as an agent was installed and the user’s computer was left powered on for 
client-specifi c data to be successfully backed up. 
As technology has evolved, so has the backup and user data availability process. We 
now have the capability of redundant hardware or server solutions to maintain close to a 
100 percent uptime or availability in the event of a server, network, or infrastructure mal-
function. Other technologies, including high availability, cloud-based backup solutions, 

Backing Up Server Data

dynamic backup, and “hot site” solutions, are available to satisfy corporate disaster 
recovery requirements. Terms like service-level agreement (SLA) come into play. An SLA 
is basically an agreement between an organization and a service provider, or even between 
departments within an organization. An example of an SLA from a service provider is 
shown in Figure 18.1.
F I G U R E 18 .1  Amazon Web Services (AWS) web page showing the service level 
agreement (SLA)
The SLA specifi es the terms of the arrangement and consists of items such as the percent-
age of network, or service uptime and the acceptable amount of network outages. The SLA 
will also provide some accountability in the event of outages or other related service issues.
Backing Up Server Data
Chances are most information technology departments already have a plan or policy in 
place that pertains to disaster recovery options for all corporate data. This plan will include 
catastrophic recovery options, fault tolerance options, and other recovery options such as 
how or if specifi c user device data is backed up. There is no absolute “right way” or “wrong 
way” regarding the topic of data disaster recovery; this will vary based on the specifi c func-
tion of the organization. Rather, there are many different ways to accomplish the same task. 
The amount of data we create now, compared to 10 years ago, has grown tremendously. 
Statistics show that companies produce 50 percent more data every year than they did 
the previous year.  For reasons such as this, data backup solutions need to be faster, more 

628 
Chapter 18 ■ Data Backup, Restore, and Disaster Recovery
reliable, and highly effi cient. Over the years, we have seen data backup methods evolve 
from magnetic tape to optical storage to cloud-based solutions that can include consider-
ations such as high availability, load balancing, and complete redundancy. 
Keep in mind that with cloud-based backup solutions, the data does not go to some 
mysterious, magical place where it is retained forever. With cloud-based solutions, you are 
offl oading the process to a third party that still provides a physical method of data storage 
and backup. It is really no different than what you would do within your infrastructure; 
you are just offl oading the task to another company. The benefi t of a remote backup solu-
tion is that it relieves the organization and information technology staff from the burden of 
the process, which then hopefully will result in a cost savings to the organization. 
There are three common traditional backup methods available. Which one you choose 
will depend on your specifi c organization, and many different factors based on the business 
model itself. The following backup methods can be used for either server-side backup or 
client-side backup.
Full Backup  This method will back up all data, regardless of how the fi les are fl agged. 
The full backup method is the most time intensive of the three methods, and requires the 
most media because every fi le is backed up, regardless of how it is fl agged.
Incremental Backup  Any fi le that has been changed or not backed up since the last 
backup occurred will be fl agged for backup, using the incremental backup method. After it 
has been backed up, it will be fl agged accordingly. 
Differential Backup  All fi les that have been changed since the last full backup will be 
backed up with a differential backup. However, once backed up, the fi les will not be 
fl agged as such. This method is quicker than a full backup, but will take longer with each 
differential backup that occurs, because even if a fi le was backed up in a prior differential 
backup, it will be backed up again.
Flagging a fi le for backup means that an attribute for the fi le will show that it has been 
changed or that it is new, and will need to be backed up. The backup program will look at 
each fi le to see if this fi le attribute is set; if it is, the fi le will then be backed up. The backup 
method used (full, incremental, or differential) will determine if that attribute is reset after 
the backup has occurred. The way this is achieved will vary based on the operating system 
in use. For example, one method Unix systems use is to look at the time stamp of a fi le. If 
the fi le time has changed, then it will be added to the backup. Figure 18.2 shows the backup 
attribute for a fi le using the Microsoft Windows 7 operating system.
Notice in Figure 18.2 that the backup attribute in the Microsoft Windows 7 operating 
system is labeled as File Is Ready For Archiving. If this check box is selected, the fi le will 
be backed up. It will be cleared (unchecked) after the fi le has been backed up, depending on 
the backup method that is used.

Backing Up Server Data

FIGURE 18.2  File backup attribute setting for the Microsoft Windows 7 operating system
If an incremental or differential backup method is used, it is very important 
to only use that method for future backups. You cannot mix the differential 
and incremental backup methods. If you decide to change methods, 
you must first do a full backup, and then choose either differential or incre-
mental. The restore order is also very important with the incremental or 
differential methods. Restoring data will be discussed later in this chapter.
Server backup solutions are available for small, medium, and enterprise networks. These 
solutions are available in standard software formats, cloud-based solutions, physical appli-
ances, or any combination of the three. The cost of these products will vary based on the 
available feature set and capabilities. The following features are among those available with 
server-based backup solutions:

The term bare metal support is used in the information technology indus-
try to identify a data restore to a computer or device that basically has no 
operating system or other data previously installed. The information to 
be restored will be hosted on an external storage device, and a software 
program can be used to boot and restore the entire system. The operating 
system, applications, and user data are included and available from the 
external data storage source. This method is often used with computer 
software imaging programs.
In Exercise 18.1 you will view the archive attribute of a fi le using the Microsoft 
Windows 7 Professional 64-bit operating system. The archive attribute will signal the 
backup program that the fi le is ready to be backed up.

Backing Up Client Device Data
As explained earlier in this chapter, client device backup for computer data traditionally 
consisted of software of some sort that would allow a fi le server to contact the client on the 
network and retrieve data for the purpose of backup and disaster recovery. This was typi-
cally done after hours to lessen the impact on the user and the available network resources. 
At that time, in many cases the need for dynamic, “on the fl y” backup of data was not as 
urgent as it is today. 
As technology has evolved, so has the process of client device backup. Urgency, speed, 
and effi ciency are important factors with modern technology as it relates to data backup. In 
addition to the “technological” aspects, the type of data (corporate, personal, or both), its 
frequency of use, and availability need to be considered when selecting the backup solution. 

632 
Chapter 18 ■ Data Backup, Restore, and Disaster Recovery
Software imaging programs are now very affordable, and are a great option for 
performing a backup that provides an exact replica, or “image,” of what is installed on 
the client computer. This will allow an easy restore if the entire drive needs to be recov-
ered because of a device failure, if you are upgrading the client device to a bigger drive 
with more storage, or even if you are restoring specifi c fi les or folders. In addition to the 
previously mentioned backup strategies, newer backup technology for mobile devices is 
commonly used. This includes apps that can be downloaded to a device to provide the 
capability for cloud-managed backup solutions. This will give the user the capability to 
restore data in the event of a device failure, or to restore data to a replacement device 
because of loss or theft of their device. 
To perform backups, you need backup software. The following list shows some of the 
products that are available for client device backup.

Of course, corporate policy will vary based on organizational needs and requirements 
for how client device backup solutions will be implemented.
Just as when backing up servers, you can perform full, incremental, or 
differential backups with clients. For more information on this, see the 
section “Backing Up Server Data,” earlier in this chapter.

636 
Chapter 18 ■ Data Backup, Restore, and Disaster Recovery
Now you’ll take a closer look at some of the considerations for backing up client data, 
how frequently to do so, and how to test your backups.
Mobile Device Backup for Corporate and Personal Data
Corporate policy and a disaster recovery plan will defi ne how the backup data is handled, 
regardless of whether it is from a network server, desktop computer, or a mobile client 
device. The procedure will vary based on the type of organization, and specifi c business 
model. Earlier in this chapter you learned about server backups and the common methods 
and procedures. With mobile devices, many of the same principles apply.
I highly recommend that you password protect the backup archive of your 
mobile devices using a strong password. If an unauthorized person were to 
obtain access to a backup file that is not password protected, they would 
be able to restore the file and have access to all data (both corporate and 
personal) that was on your device prior to the backup.
Backing Up Data to a Device Locally
In some cases it may not be feasible to back up your device remotely or to a corporate 
backup solution, corporate server, or cloud service provider. This may be the scenario for 
people who are working on the road remotely, or with limited network or Internet access. 
In a case such as this, backing up data locally is an acceptable solution. 
It is important to be fully prepared, because you never know when you may experience 
a device failure. For this purpose I recommend that a local backup be stored on an external 
media source such as a Universal Serial Bus (USB) drive, Subscriber Identifi cation Module 
(SIM) card, Secure Digital (SD) card, or other portable drive source. Using the same 
physical device or storage drive for data backup and your user data is not recommended. 
If you were to store the backed-up data on the same device or drive, the backup would be 
useless in the event of a device failure. Keep in mind that everything on the device, such as 
the operating system, applications, and other information that can be easily replaced, may 
not need to be backed up in this situation. Depending on your needs, it is often suffi cient to 
back up only data and other information that cannot be easily replaced.
A SIM card is a small memory device that is used in GSM devices to store 
personal information about the device’s owner, and other information such 
as contacts, text messages, and address books. Although these cards are 
available with different memory capacities, you should not expect to be 
able to store large amounts of data. SIM cards are available in different 
form factors, and the capacity is relatively small, ranging from 16 KB to 
128 KB. The number of entries or amount of information the card can store 
depends on the capacity.

Disaster Recovery Principles 
637
Frequency of Backups
The frequency of backups is usually specifi ed as part of corporate policy or in the disaster 
recovery plan. Looking from the client device side, how dynamic or critical your data is 
will determine the frequency with which it is backed up. Something to think about is the 
“what if” scenario: 
 
■
What if your device failed?
 
■
What data would you be able to live without in the event of a failure?
 
■
How much time or work would it take to re-create the important information that was 
lost and not recovered? 
From the server or network side, it really depends on the size and the complexity of the 
network, and the number of servers. Some organizations are satisfi ed with what is con-
sidered a more legacy backup solution, such as nightly with a rotational scheme in mind; 
others may rely on more modern solutions such as cloud-based, server virtualization, and 
clustering technology. Keep in mind that many networks are now available 24/7/365, and 
the data can be accessed at any time of the day or night from anywhere. Remote access 
capability has really changed the landscape of the entire computing process. Some recom-
mendations include using your best judgment, researching industry best practices, contact-
ing your backup solution provider for recommendations, and reading industry white papers 
written by experts in the fi eld.
Testing Your Backup
What is worse than powering on your device only to see that it’s not working? Realizing 
that the data backup solution you used did not work and you have no way to recover your 
device’s data or the lost confi guration information. Testing a backup solution to verify that 
it works is one component of a disaster recovery plan. Just as you would test a fi re escape 
plan by executing a fi re drill, data backups should also be tested to ensure that they are 
working correctly and will be accessible if needed.
The process of testing includes determining the frequency of testing and the data types 
to be tested, which will vary based on your organization. I would start by creating fi les that 
can be deleted, and use those for the test. Back up, delete, restore, and verify that the data 
is intact. Another option would be to perform a bare metal restore on an unused server or 
device, if possible, to verify that the backup is 100 percent valid.
Disaster Recovery Principles
It is important to understand the difference between disaster recovery and restoring com-
puter data. Disaster recovery is a plan put into action after an event such as a catastrophic 
technology failure or natural disaster has interrupted normal business operations, due to 
a lack of the technology infrastructure. Restoring computer data could be as simple as 

638 
Chapter 18 ■ Data Backup, Restore, and Disaster Recovery
restoring data for a single user who has experienced a device failure that impacts only that 
user, or a non–mission-critical server that has experienced a hardware failure or software 
malfunction.
Deﬁ nition of a Disaster
Years ago I was working in a subcontractor position that involved a server migration and 
standardization project for a large enterprise network covering ﬁ ve states and over 20 
sites. One of my assignments was to develop and implement a new disaster recovery 
plan for the organization. This was before some of the newer technologies like cloud-
based and virtualization solutions. It involved a traditional hardware and software solu-
tion that provided a complete rotational backup of servers and client devices to physical 
media, with offsite storage of the media to a secure remote location. 
This disaster recovery plan was intended for recovery after a natural disaster or cata-
strophic technology failure, not for restoring a single user’s data. On more than one occa-
sion, a user would visit my ofﬁ ce and ask me to restore ﬁ les for them that were located on 
the ﬁ le server in their home directory or in the shared folder and had been inadvertently 
deleted. Depending on the speciﬁ c situation, this could be a time-consuming task. Many 
times the deleted data was not of much importance, and the amount of time it took to 
retrieve the backup and restore the ﬁ les was not cost effective. Because some users were 
taking advantage of the process, I had to inform the user base that the disaster recovery 
procedure was speciﬁ cally for disaster recovery only, and not to restore individual user 
data due to user error. 
After about a week had passed, I had a user visit my ofﬁ ce asking me to recover some 
ﬁ les that “somebody else deleted” from their home directory on the ﬁ le server. I 
explained to the user that the server backups were intended for disaster recovery 
purposes only. I was informed by this user that their ﬁ les needed to be restored because 
“it was a disaster that they were deleted.” 
My objective here is to add a little humor and to make a point. I am not suggesting that a 
backup could not be used to recover ﬁ les a user deleted. I am suggesting that guidelines 
and a policy should be implemented that also clarify the differences between disaster 
recovery and recovering user-speciﬁ c ﬁ les that were deleted. So yes, if “someone else” 
deleted their ﬁ les, they could be restored, but the policy should specify the priority of this 
speciﬁ c situation, and how it is handled.
Disaster Recovery Plan
A network disaster recovery plan is a documented procedure with specifi c sections that 
include steps and processes that will allow an organization to restore network operations 

Disaster Recovery Principles 
639
in the event of a disaster or catastrophic failure. Disasters fall under two main categories: 
natural disasters and human-created disasters.
Natural Disasters  A natural disaster is something that is out of our control, and can occur 
anytime and anyplace. These disasters include events such as fl oods, fi res, earthquakes, and 
high winds.
Human-Created Disasters  These disasters include fi re (which also could be considered a 
natural disaster), power outages, hardware or device failures due to technology issues, 
terrorism, industrial accidents, and more.
Earlier in this chapter you learned about backing up data and other information from 
servers and various client devices. The different methods for well-planned backup solutions 
were also discussed. All of this information is great, but what happens in the event of a 
network or infrastructure failure? This is where the disaster recovery plan comes into play. 
Most people know what needs be done, but it’s important to identify and document the 
actual procedures and processes.
The severity of the disaster will determine the course of action that will be taken. A 
disaster recovery plan will specify the proper procedures that need to be taken, in order to 
restore network operations to as close as normal as possible. There are many variables to 
consider. From an overview perspective, there are several main areas to be considered:
 
■
Designing and creating the plan
 
■
Obtaining management buy-in for the plan
 
■
Implementing the plan
 
■
Testing and validating the plan
 
■
Keeping it current
 
■
Planning document storage and accessibility
 
■
Identifying key contacts
Designing and Creating the Plan
To design and create a disaster recovery plan, you must understand the operation and func-
tionality of the entire business and its operation procedures. This will require research and 
interaction with the entire organization as a whole. Identify the most critical departments 
or business units within the company, and prioritize accordingly. Different businesses or 
organizations will have different priorities that will need to be taken into consideration. 
Heads of all departments need to be involved with this process, in order to ensure that 
the plan will work as designed. Gather all the necessary information regarding the details 
and day-to-day operations of each department or business within the company. This will 
require interviewing department heads and top business unit personnel. The following 
major departments are among those that must be considered:
 
■
Information Technology
 
■
Security
 
■
Human Resources

Obtaining Management Buy-in for the Plan
Management commitment to a disaster recovery plan is one of the key factors in its success. 
Surprisingly enough, this may be harder to obtain than you might expect. Let’s face it, a 
project like this will cost money, and depending on the size of the organization, it could be 
a substantial amount of money. Unless the plan is actually put into action (which you hope 
it never is), it is very diffi cult to see the return on investment. A good understanding of 
what a plan will provide, and the long-term benefi ts, must be understood by all parties, and 
you need to get the commitment of the management team.
Implementing the Plan
Once the plan has been approved by management, it should be implemented immediately. 
This will ensure that you are ready to put the plan into action if the need to do so arises.
Testing and Validating the Plan
Most companies and organizations have plans in place for how to react to emergencies such 
as fi re, tornado, earthquake, and other types of disasters. To make sure these plans work, 
they are tested. This will include fi re drills and other testing of that nature. A disaster 
recovery plan for technology should be no different. Proper testing procedures should be 
implemented to ensure that the plan will work as designed.
Keeping It Current
Like many other documents within an organization, the disaster recovery plan must be 
monitored and updated as needed. Technology and infrastructure services are constantly 
changing, and the plan can become outdated quickly. This is especially true if the plan has 
never had to be put into action. Changes should also be approved by a change management 
team, and documented within the change record pages.
Planning Document Storage and Accessibility
The plan should be stored securely on various media types, possibly in multiple locations, 
and readily accessible to those requiring access to it. This may include hard copy docu-
ments, and electronic fi les stored on CDs, DVDs, or removable electronic disk drives. 
Ensuring that those who require access are the only ones to obtain access is also important, 
especially if the document contains a company’s private information. You also may want to 
consider a cloud-based storage solution that provides only secure access to the document.

Disaster Recovery Principles 
641
Identifying Key Contacts
The main or key contacts responsible for the creation, implementation, and execution of 
the disaster recovery plan should be noted. This will allow those individuals to be reached 
if the need arises. 
The hardest part of any type of documentation is figuring out where to 
start. The objective of the disaster recovery section in this chapter is to 
provide you with an overview of the process and to stress some key points. 
There are several websites available with best practices and templates you 
can use for your disaster recovery plan. One such site is the SANS Tech-
nology Institute website at www.sans.org. From the home page, you can 
click the Infosec Reading Room link and search for a variety of technology-
related documents to review.
Disaster Recovery Locations
Disaster recovery locations will depend on the plan that is implemented, and whether 
the backup is on actual physical media or a dynamic hot site. Backup solutions that are 
stored on physical media, such as magnetic tape or optical devices, should be stored in a 
secured offsite location. This will ensure that the media with the backed-up data can be 
used to rebuild the systems with the data that was lost or destroyed from the live network. 
Recovery locations are commonly categorized as one of three types of sites: hot sites, cold 
sites, and warm sites.
Hot Site  A hot site is an exact replica of the company’s network operations or datacenter. 
It can be a dynamic site that mirrors all information in real time and would immediately 
be able to take over in the event of a network failure. Other types of hot sites may need to 
have the most recent user data restored to get it 100 percent up to date. This is the most 
expensive solution, but has the shortest recovery time.
Cold Site  The cold site location is basically a building space that would have to be 
brought up to speed with the purchase, delivery, and installation of all equipment, com-
puters, and the infrastructure, and to have all data restored from backup. This is the least 
expensive type of site, but would take the longest amount of time to be brought up to 
speed.
Warm Site  This site is the middle ground between the hot and cold sites. The warm site 
will have equipment and computers capable of acting as a temporary replacement of the 
company’s datacenter. A warm site would need to have the latest data restored in order to 
make it operational.

642 
Chapter 18 ■ Data Backup, Restore, and Disaster Recovery
Choosing the recovery location that will best fi t your needs depends on the organization, 
type of business, urgency of restoration, and, of course, your budget. You should evaluate 
all options carefully prior to making a decision.
Maintaining High Availability
Providing a physical backup mechanism may not be an adequate solution for some network 
deployments. Depending on the business model, 100 percent uptime or very close to it may 
be a requirement for day-to-day business operations to succeed. Any downtime could cost 
the organization substantial amounts of money, because of the inability to access the 
network resources or stored data. 
This is where server and network clustering may play a role. Providing an exact, real-
time replica of all confi gurations, data, and transactions will ensure the most amount of 
uptime possible. The process of clustering does not necessarily provide a static backup solu-
tion, but more of a high availability fault tolerance solution, as well as possible load 
balancing of services. Backup of servers, user data, and devices is still a factor. For exam-
ple, a company that sells widgets may have a website running that could become overloaded 
because it advertised a special promotion on a television commercial, or used social media 
to promote a product. With clustering of services, some of the traffi c can be offl oaded to 
additional web servers that are connected together through a common infrastructure, and 
possibly a storage area network (SAN). This type of confi guration provides what is known 
as an Active/Active state, meaning both sites are up and accessible, not just on standby 
in the event of a server or network failure. A basic framework of this process is shown in 
Figure 18.3.

Restoring Data 
643
This will also provide a backup solution in the event a site goes down unexpectedly, 
because the data is theoretically “mirrored” between the sites, and the combined sites act 
as one. Virtualization technology also plays a big role with high availability, allowing for 
multiple servers at different locations to be managed and accessed as one entity. If needed 
for load balancing, redundancy, fault tolerance, or disaster recovery, it can take only min-
utes to spin up a new virtual server from a snapshot that was taken of the live network. The 
snapshot is the state of the server at a specifi c point in time that can be restored quickly, in 
most cases.
When it comes to network disaster recovery I like to think of the P-Cubed, 
or P3, method.
 
■
Plan – Plan your strategy.
 
■
Prepare – Prepare for the worst.
 
■
Protect – Protect your data and infrastructure.
Restoring Data
With data backup, we must also think about the data restore process. Restoration is the 
part of the data backup and disaster recovery process that ensures that data and confi gura-
tion information can be restored or rebuilt if necessary. Because of the required accessibility 
of network resources and data, the restore process is as important as the backup process. 
Some would say it is even more important. If a restoration is needed, you may not have 
immediate access to the servers or the data required for the business to operate normally, 
or for you to do your job. Depending on the type of business, this could be much more than 
just an inconvenience. 
A few items need to be taken into consideration about the restoration process.
 
■
Why is the data restoration needed?
 
■
Does a user need a few files restored that were deleted or corrupted?
 
■
Is it the result of hardware or device failure, or a technological catastrophic event?
 
■
Is it the result of a natural disaster?
The answers to these questions will help determine how or whether the data recovery 
process proceeds. You hope the day never comes when you will need to put a disaster 
recovery plan into action, but you need to be prepared in the event that it happens. The 
disaster recovery plan will document the data restore process for servers and client devices, 
as well as how corporate and personal data types will be handled.

644 
Chapter 18 ■ Data Backup, Restore, and Disaster Recovery
Restoring Corporate Data
The restoration of data to a device that is used to access corporate data will have high 
priority. The backup method that is used will determine how the restoration is handled. 
For networks that rely on local backup technology using media that is stored at a remote 
location, the latest backup media will need to be retrieved and restored. For networks that 
use high availability, virtualization, and disk imaging technology, the process will be much 
quicker than those that use the traditional media restore process. The data restore process 
may include installing the server or device operating system to get a place to start, and then 
proceeding with the complete restore process. This will include the required applications, 
and then the user data fi les. 
Verifying the integrity of the restored data is also important. It is not safe to assume 
that after the restore is complete, everything will be 100 percent operational. Mobile device 
users may need to synchronize their mobile devices to the servers located on the remote net-
work to ensure that the data is consistent and current, because the local remote user data 
may have changed since the restore occurred.
Restoring Personal Data
Restoring personal data usually has the lowest priority (that is, unless it is the CEO’s device 
that needs to be restored, of course). All kidding aside, how personal data is handled will 
usually be specifi ed in the company’s policy document. It is important that this procedure 
be documented so the users have a clear understanding of how the process works, and the 
priority that it will be given. If policy states an employee of the company should not store 
personal data on a corporate device anyway, you have to determine whether the company 
should even be concerned about the user’s personal data. 
Newer concepts like BYOD technology shine some new light on the topic of how per-
sonal data is handled. Some corporations, organizations, school districts, and other places 
that allow people to bring their own devices will need to evaluate policy closely. In many 
situations, personal mobile devices such as computers, smartphones, and tablets are now 
allowed to be used on the corporate or organization business network, and access the avail-
able resources. Some school districts and businesses are leveraging the fact that people use 
their own devices on the network, which parlays into a cost savings because they will not 
need to provide the user with a device to use. Even so, chances are that the company’s or 
organization’s network IT staff will be responsible for personal data as well as work-related 
user data. 
Summary
In this chapter you learned about the importance of backing up data, and explored differ-
ent backup strategies that can be used to ensure the availability and integrity of corporate 
data. It’s important to have a basic understanding of a service-level agreement (SLA), which 

Chapter Essentials 
645
is an agreement that specifi es the details of a service. We explored some common meth-
ods used for backup, including traditional storage media types such as magnetic tape and 
optical storage. You learned about the different types of media backup methods available, 
which include a full backup, an incremental backup, and a differential backup. We explored 
server backup software programs and strategies, as well as the features that are available in 
many commercial off-the-shelf server backup programs. These features include support for 
various operating systems, cloud-based backups, disk imaging, and bare metal restoration. 
We also looked at the importance of client and mobile device backup for corporate and 
personal data. You learned about common disaster recovery procedures, and the impor-
tance of maintaining high availability. Concepts for high availability include redundant or 
mirrored sites and load balancing. Finally, the concept of bring your own device (BYOD) 
technology and both corporate and personal data were discussed in terms of backup and 
restore policy and procedures, and the disaster recovery plan.
Chapter Essentials
Be familiar with the different traditional backup methods.  Full, incremental, and differ-
ential backup methods are used with backup strategies to store backups to physical media 
such as magnetic tape, optical storage, and external storage devices. 
Understand the different methods used to back up servers.  Servers can be backed up 
using physical storage methods. Be familiar with technology that provides high availabil-
ity, including redundant or mirrored sites, virtualization, and load balancing of network 
servers.
Know the common methods used for client and mobile device backup.  Understand 
different methods are available for client backups, including traditional storage media, 
cloud-based storage, and disk imaging.
Understand the concepts of corporate and personal data backups.  Corporate policy will 
play a role in choosing the backup strategy for corporate and personal data. Be familiar 
with the implications and storage methods for client device local backups.
Be familiar with disaster recovery principles.  Understand the framework of a disaster 
recovery plan. Know the concepts as they pertain to backup and restore procedures.
Understand the types of disaster recovery locations.  Be familiar with the difference 
between a hot site and a cold site. Know that a hot site provides the quickest restore 
process, and provides a replica of a data center. A cold site is built from the ground up, and 
the restore process takes longer.
Understand the concept of high availability.  Technology such as site mirroring, load 
balancing, clustering, and storage area networking (SAN) provide high availability for data 
access, and will provide access until the failed systems are restored.

Be familiar with the data restoration process.   Know the options and steps regarding data 
restoration, and that it can be accomplished by restoring a complete backed-up image. It 
can also be performed manually by using traditional media methods, which may require 
restoring an operating system, then the user applications, and fi nally the user data.

Wireless networks, like most areas of technology, require 
support and maintenance. The extent depends on the size and 
complexity of the network. Troubleshooting problems is a key 
component in the maintenance, reliability, and operation of a wireless network. A wire-
less technical support engineer will encounter all the same problems that occur with wired 
networking as well as additional problems because wireless technology uses radio frequency 
for communication. In this chapter, you will learn about common problems associated with 
wireless networking, how to identify problems based on the symptoms, and how to deter-
mine whether they are global (affecting many) or isolated (affecting an individual). These 
problems range in complexity and magnitude and many times are associated with wireless 
connectivity, radio frequency signal strength, and other network-related issues. 
Troubleshooting is not something that can be learned overnight or from reading a book. 
Troubleshooting is an acquired skill that requires many hours of hard work. The steps 
involved in troubleshooting a wireless networking problem vary and depend on the complex-
ity of the network and the environment. We will explore causes and solutions associated with 
wireless network connectivity, roaming issues, authentication failures, and network saturation.
The Troubleshooting Process
A key step in troubleshooting networking problems is to identify whether an issue is a 
global problem or an isolated problem. Global problems often include wired and wireless 
infrastructure devices and components. A global problem usually involves many client 
devices or groups of devices or a complete network failure. The following network devices 
can be related to a global problem:
 
■
Wireless access points
 
■
Wireless bridges
 
■
Wireless LAN controllers
 
■
Wired infrastructure devices
In addition to wireless infrastructure devices such as access points, wired infrastructure 
components like Ethernet switches or Layer 3 routers can be a potential source of global 
problems. Keep in mind that wireless client and mobile devices nearly always require a 
wired infrastructure of some sort in order to pass information between infrastructure 
devices or outside the wireless network and to a cellular carrier network. The following 
devices and components can contribute to wired infrastructure problems:
 
■
Ethernet cabling
 
■
Ethernet switches

associated with wireless networking.

Once it has been determined whether the problem is global or isolated, appropriate steps 
are necessary to determine the solution. But before we look at common problems associated 
with wireless networking, it is important to understand a little more detail about how wire-
less technology functions. This includes understanding the components used to send and 
receive radio frequency information and is accomplished by two main components:
 
■
Radio frequency transmitter
 
■
Radio frequency receiver
Understanding Radio Frequency 
Transmitters and Receivers
As discussed in previous chapters, wireless device communications use radio frequency to 
send and receive data. This is possible because all wireless devices have transmitter and/
or receiver capability. Unlike a television or FM radio you may have in your home, both of 
which are only receivers, all wireless and mobile devices have the capability to act as either 
a transmitter or a receiver (also known as a transceiver). The following explains transmit-
ter and receiver functionality to provide the groundwork necessary to diagnose and resolve 
wireless communications problems.

650 
Chapter 19 ■ Mobile Device Problem Analysis and Troubleshooting
Radio Transmitter  In wireless communications, a transmitter combines binary digital 
computer data (all of the 1s and 0s) with high-frequency alternating current (AC) signals to 
prepare the computer data to be sent across the air. This is known as modulation. The con-
nected antenna then transforms this signal into radio waves and propagates them through 
the air. The frequency of the signal depends on the technology in use. With IEEE 802.11 
standards–based wireless networking, there are a few select frequency ranges.
Radio Receiver  A receiver collects the propagated signal from the air using an antenna 
and reverses the process by transforming the received signal back into an alternating 
current signal. Through the use of a demodulation process, the digital data is recovered. 
The modulation/demodulation technology used depends on the wireless standard or 
amendment with which the device is compliant. For example, an IEEE 802.11n wireless LAN 
will use 64 quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) when transmitting data at 300 Mbps. 
Figure 19.2 illustrates this entire process. Keep in mind that wireless network devices are 
transceivers, so they have the capability of performing either task. In Figure 19.2, the access 
point is the transmitter and the client device is the receiver.

Steps in the Troubleshooting Process
The following steps are a good rule of thumb to use as part of your troubleshooting 
process:
1. 
Establish the cause
2. 
Test to determine the cause
3. 
Establish a plan of action
4. 
Implement the solution
These four steps are typically performed in this order. The components of these steps are 
described in more detail throughout the remainder of this chapter.
Gathering Information
Gathering information is a key component in troubleshooting any type of problem. This 
is usually accomplished by asking many questions of those that are experiencing the prob-
lems. If you were experiencing a problem with your automobile, you would take it to a 
repair shop and have it evaluated by a mechanic. The mechanic at the shop would ask you 
questions about the symptoms you are experiencing. With the answers to these specifi c 
questions, the mechanic can evaluate the symptoms to establish the possible cause, perform 
tests and diagnostics to determine the cause, establish a plan of action, implement the solu-
tion, and start the repair process. 
Troubleshooting technology issues is no different. The best place to start is with those 
that are experiencing the problem. Ask them questions to gather enough information and 
help identify the symptoms. There is no specifi c method to use; just plain experience will 
play a role in the entire process. 
Chances are that when a user is experiencing a technical problem, they are not the fi rst 
person to experience it. This is one good reason for accurate and clear documentation of 
the entire process. If the problems, the fi ndings, and analysis are documented, it will make 
the next person’s job that much easier. Documenting fi ndings, actions and outcomes is 
discussed later in this chapter. 
In addition to gathering information from the user base, there are electronic methods of 
gathering information, statistics, and details about the components used within the wire-
less communications area. One such method is the Simple Network Management Protocol 
(SNMP). You learned about the details and components of SNMP in Chapter 2, “Common 
Network Protocols and Ports.” SNMP, a Layer 7 protocol, will allow a network adminis-
trator to use its features to gain valuable knowledge about the health of network devices 
that can be used for troubleshooting and the associated documentation.

652 
Chapter 19 ■ Mobile Device Problem Analysis and Troubleshooting
Understanding the Symptoms
Once you have asked the appropriate questions, you should have enough information to 
start to identify the symptoms of a problem. For example, let’s take a look at a wireless LAN 
problem where a user is complaining that they cannot connect to the wireless network. The 
network uses WPA2 personal mode to secure a group of client devices. Incorrect security 
settings can also cause connectivity issues. Although you may get a physical Layer 2 wire-
less connection to the access point even with incorrect security settings on a wireless client 
device, you will not get a valid Layer 3 TCP/IP address from the DHCP server. For example, 
assume an access point is using WPA2 personal mode for security. If a wireless client device 
has the wrong passphrase or preshared key entered, it will not complete the additional 
authentication that occurs after the IEEE 802.11 authentication and association process and 
will not have a valid Layer 3 TCP/IP address. In the Windows operating system, the network 
adapter would show “Attempting to authenticate” in the network adapter status; it would 
not be able to complete the Layer 2 connection process and would not receive a valid Layer 
3 IP address. Figure 19.3 shows an example of a wireless network adapter with the wrong 
passphrase set using the Windows 7 client utility.
F I G U R E  19. 3   The Windows 7 wireless adapter shows “Attempting to authenticate” 
when a wrong WPA passphrase is entered.
Windows 7 wireless service shows
“Attempting to authenticate” because
an incorrect passphrase was entered.
Changes to the Environment
Understanding what has changed is a key part to identifying what the problem is. 
Questioning the user base will sometimes help to discover what changes were made, which 
may help with a diagnosis. However, it is important to understand that getting this infor-
mation may not be as easy as it seems. Users may not remember or realize they changed 
something that had an impact and caused a problem. One of the fi rst questions to ask 
the user is, “What did you change?” and the response is usually, “I did not do anything,” 

Troubleshooting Specific Problems 
653
which is no help to anyone. After spending some time troubleshooting, you can sometimes 
fi nd something the user actually did change that caused a problem. When you point this out 
the response is usually, “Oh, I forgot about that,” which again is not much help to anyone. 
Infrastructure changes can also cause problems. These changes are something users have 
no control over, but they can be affected by them.
Documenting Findings, Actions, and Outcomes
Documentation is a very important component with any part of technology. This holds true 
with troubleshooting as well. The troubleshooting process and solution should be docu-
mented as accurately as possible. When the same problem appears again, the documenta-
tion will provide information to whoever is assigned to the task and will hopefully provide 
assistance to resolve the problem more quickly than if there was no past documentation to 
go by. There is no reason to reinvent the wheel, as they say. 
Help desk software is available from a variety of software manufacturers to help with 
documenting technical issues, some of which are listed here:
 
■
Freshdesk
 
■
FrontRange Solutions HEAT
 
■
Kayako
 
■
SolarWinds Web Help Desk
 
■
Zendesk
These software packages provide advanced features such as ticket/incident management 
systems, searchable knowledge bases, and self-service portals, to name a few.
Troubleshooting Specific Problems
There is a wide array of problems that can occur, and there is no way to predict them all. 
However, there are some problems that commonly come up, and there are some ways to 
identify them and to address them. The following sections will look at how to troubleshoot 
some common problems.
Problem: Shortened Battery Life
A user is complaining that the battery in their iPhone does not last as long as they think 
it should. This may be the result of an aging battery. However, there are options that may 
help the battery work for longer periods of time between charges:
 
■
Disable unused or battery-hungry applications when not needed.
 
■
Disable services that are seldom used, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS.

654 
Chapter 19 ■ Mobile Device Problem Analysis and Troubleshooting
 
■
Disable unnecessary services (such as GPS or Bluetooth) that may have been enabled 
for individual applications (apps) but are not needed and may affect the battery life.
 
■
Adjust the power save mode to a shorter time.
There are apps available that will tell you what services and features are currently 
enabled on your phone and are using the battery and how much of it they are using. An 
app like this would help you identify what you can disable and help conserve battery life. 
When you replace a battery, I recommend using one that is provided from the original 
manufacturer. Some third-party replacements have been known to not be as high in quality 
as the original. 
Problem: Synchronization Issues
Keep in mind that many mobile devices do not have the processing power or capability to 
keep information local (such as email, for example). Therefore, they will need to synchro-
nize with a service or server and rely on a connection using either cellular or Wi-Fi. In some 
cases users may experience synchronization issues for various reasons. Here are some of the 
many possible reasons for synchronization issues:
 
■
Cellular and Wi-Fi connections are not available.
 
■
Synchronization software is not available or is misconfigured. 
 
■
Services or servers are not available during the attempted synchronization.
 
■
Security or firewall settings are not configured correctly.
 
■
BYOD policy is not enabled or is out-of-date.
 
■
Power adapter or cable is defective.
Using the correct protocols is important. For example, in Chapter 2 you learned that 
the POP3 protocol will download email messages to the local device. Conversely, with 
the IMAP protocol, the messages are not downloaded locally to the client device’s email 
software program. Instead the email will remain on the email server for retrieval from any 
device with an Internet connection and the proper credentials to authenticate to the email 
server. Many mobile device email or calendaring problems are synchronization-related 
problems. 
Problem: Power Adapter/Supply
You may not expect that the power adapter you use to charge your mobile device may be 
causing a problem. Keep in mind that adapters plug into a jack on the mobile device. Every 
time the device is charged (often daily), the connector experiences wear and tear. Here are 
some of the issues that you may experience with mobile device power adapters:
 
■
Battery is not charging.
 
■
Connector on device or charger is misaligned or defective.

Troubleshooting Specific Problems 
655
 
■
Cable on power adapter is cracked or broken due to wear.
 
■
Connector on adapter or jack on device is worn from continued use and wear.
USB Connector on Phone Is Defective
I personally experienced this problem with one of my older smartphones. This particular 
phone had a cable that plugged into a jack on the phone on one side and on the other 
side plugged into a standard USB connector, either on a computer or to an adapter that 
would allow it to be plugged into an AC outlet. When the phone was connected, the bat-
tery would charge and the icon on the display would show as such. Apparently the con-
nector plug on the cable for the power adapter had become worn over time and no longer 
provided a good connection 100 percent of the time. When I plugged the phone into the 
power adapter, the icon showed as charging. If the phone or connector moved the 
slightest bit, the connection would be broken and therefore the battery would not charge 
completely, something I did not immediately notice. I was puzzled as to why my battery 
did not last nearly as long as it should have even though it showed as charging when 
it was plugged into a power source. Assuming the battery was getting weak with age, 
I replaced it. However, the problem persisted. Then I realized the problem was the jack 
on the power adapter and not the battery in the phone. In the end I replaced the power 
adapter cable, which solved the problem.
Problem: Password-Related Issues
Passwords are a very important part of technology because they help provide a level of 
security to ensure that access to resources is available only to the individual with the appro-
priate credentials. You saw in Chapter 16, “Device Authentication and Data Encryption,” 
that passwords provide a type of access control for mobile and other networking devices. 
Theoretically, corporate policy will help defi ne requirements of password usage, but we still 
have our share of issues with passwords. Here are some of the reasons for many trouble-
shooting issues related to user accounts and passwords.
 
■
Password complexity, such as length, mixed case, and special characters
 
■
Password expiration
 
■
Account restrictions, such as lockout and time of day
 
■
Users forgetting passwords
 
■
Corporate policy
Many password technical support issues are the result of a user typing in an incorrect 
password or forgetting their password. These may indirectly cause other issues, such as an 

656 
Chapter 19 ■ Mobile Device Problem Analysis and Troubleshooting
account lockout. If a user enters a password and they get an error, usually they will enter 
it again. Depending on the corporate security policy, an account lockout may occur if the 
retry attempts hit the threshold. 
Problem: Device Crash
There are many possible reasons for a device crash:
 
■
Misbehaving application
 
■
Corrupt software or device driver
 
■
Potential viruses or malware
 
■
Battery failure
A device crash can be a big troubleshooting challenge, especially if it is an intermittent 
problem. This is one place where logging is useful. Many times a log fi le or crash report 
will show the last thing that happened prior to the device crash. Analyzing that information 
may point you in the direction of the issue, easing the troubleshooting process to an extent. 
Problem: Power Outage
Because laptop computers, smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices use batteries 
to operate, the biggest concern with a power outage is the infrastructure rather than the 
mobile device. If the device has some battery life and does not need to be recharged, it 
should operate as it normally does. However, infrastructure services such as the following 
may not be available:
 
■
Internet access
 
■
Wi-Fi and network access
 
■
Cellular access (if the location is relying on a distributed antenna system, or DAS)
Although a power outage could be more of an infrastructure issue, it can still have a 
negative effect on productivity if employees cannot get access to network resources or the 
Internet. An uninterruptible power supply (UPS), which is basically a battery backup, will 
allow a certain level of infrastructure access even in the event of a power outage. In addi-
tion to providing power to the devices, it will protect the system from a crash if an unex-
pected power outage occurs and provide the opportunity for a graceful shutdown. A UPS 
will also provide protection for the connected devices against other voltage- or current-
related issues, such as voltage spikes or over voltages.
Problem: Missing Applications
You may experience what appears to be missing apps from your smartphone, tablet, or 
other mobile device. This may occur for several reasons. 
 
■
Logged into a different account
 
■
Operating system upgrade

Troubleshooting Specific Problems 
657
 
■
Disabled app
 
■
Device firmware issue
 
■
Uninstalled, deleted, or erased app
This is a common problem that could be caused by the reasons listed and is usually 
resolved fairly easily, although it may be time consuming to troubleshoot.
Problem: Email Issues
Trouble with email can be related to several different areas of technology and also depends 
on if the mobile client device is using a web-based service or an email client program based 
on Post Offi ce Protocol (POP3). One of the most common problems with email is authenti-
cation errors, which can include the email address logon username or password. The 
following problems can also occur:
 
■
No or poor Wi-Fi signal
 
■
Incorrect email settings, such as POP3 or SMTP server settings
 
■
Incorrect TCP port settings
Email is one area where users will experience many problems. One reason is that it is 
one of the most commonly used applications. In addition, there are many settings that can 
either be misconfi gured or can change, which will require user interaction. In addition to 
the potential client-side issues, the server side will play a role in how well email operates. 
In some cases, email services may be unavailable due to network issues not related to the 
email programs, ports, or processes.
Problem: Profile Authentication and 
Authorization Issues
The term authentication has different meanings depending on the context in which it is 
used. IEEE 802.11 open system authentication is performed by the 802.11 protocol and 
requires no user interaction. User-based authentication, which includes logging into a com-
puter or network, is another form, and software applications such as databases and email 
clients also require authentication. The authorization process is what a user can do once 
they have successfully logged into the system or service.  Troubleshooting profi le authenti-
cation and authorization issues will require enough background information to effectively 
diagnose the following problems:
 
■
Incorrect credentials on the client side
 
■
Insufficient permissions on the network side
 
■
Wrong profile selected

Common Over-the-Air Connectivity 
Problems
I explained earlier in this chapter that a wireless technical support engineer will encounter 
all the same problems that occur with wired networking as well as additional problems 
because wireless technology uses radio frequency for communication and to exchange 
information. Unlike wired communications, wireless uses an unbounded medium, the 
air, to send and receive radio frequency signals. With this come many potential problems, 
which are explained in the following sections.
 
■
Wireless latency
 
■
No cellular signal
 
■
No wireless network connectivity
 
■
Roaming issues
 
■
Cellular device activation issues
 
■
Access point name issues
 
■
Wireless network saturation
LAN Technology vs Cellular Technology
Many connectivity problems pertain to both wireless LAN technology and cellular tech-
nology. Even though both are wireless, they use different methods for communication 
and should not be confused. Depending on the problem, you may need to use a different 
troubleshooting methodology for each. Here are some considerations and differences 
between the two technologies:
 
■
Wireless LAN technology is usually part of a local area network, which has a much 
shorter range than cellular networks. 
 
■
Wireless LAN access is limited by the signal strength and coverage area of the infra-
structure devices such as access points.
 
■
Cellular users pay a fee to connect and gain access to voice and data services, 
whereas wireless LAN technology uses unlicensed frequency bands.
 
■
Wireless LAN users may have more control over their network and the device’s 
conﬁ guration settings.
 
■
Short-range wireless LAN devices at home allow users to control their own security. 
Cellular, on the other hand, has a longer range and infrastructure security is provided 
by the wireless carrier.

Common Over-the-Air Connectivity Problems 
659
 
■
A user who connects to a wireless network at their place of business with a device 
that is conﬁ gured to use the corporate security policy will likely use a higher level of 
security than a home user would use.
 
■
Troubleshooting a wireless LAN is generally performed locally by an administrator or 
the user. Troubleshooting cellular problems may involve calling the technical support 
department of the wireless carrier or the service provider for assistance.
Wireless Latency
Network latency is a delay and a measured time value for a packet or frame to get from 
the source device to a destination device. The application in use on the wireless LAN will 
determine the effect this will have on communications. In wireless communications, latency 
will have a big impact on both voice and video communications. Quality of service (QoS) 
will help lessen the potential impact of latency in wireless LAN communications. Common 
TCP/IP utilities can be used to measure network latency. The tracert.exe utility and the 
ping.exe utility are both available in the Microsoft Windows operating system and other 
operating systems. The proper use and syntax of the commands for these utilities is well 
documented and available from a simple Internet search and also from help screens within 
the actual programs. Apps for measuring latency are also available for mobile device oper-
ating systems, including Apple or Android devices. Using services across a wired network 
such as an Internet connection may contribute to the latency that a user experiences. For 
example, the amount of latency will vary based on the wired communication technology in 
use, such as, for example, cable modems or DSL. The acceptable levels of latency will vary 
based on the technology used, such as voice and video applications.
No Cellular Signal
A smartphone or mobile device not showing cellular signal may not necessarily mean 
there is a problem. The lack of a discernible signal could be because the device is in an area 
that has a weak signal or no coverage. If the problem occurs indoors, chances are the 
cellular signal is not strong enough to provide the necessary coverage. In Chapter 3, “Radio 
Frequency and Antenna Technology Fundamentals,” you learned that bringing a cellular 
signal in from the outside and allowing it to be at an acceptable level in a structure can 
be accomplished using technology known as a distributed antenna system (DAS). This 
is becoming more common because the multifunction mobile devices we use need high-
quality cellular signals for voice and cellular data communications and Wi-Fi signals for 
wireless LAN communications in order to operate as designed and to provide the best user 
experience possible for both technologies. Getting a better-quality cellular signal may also 
be accomplished by using a cellular repeater. The concept is the same as with DAS, which 
is bringing a signal into a structure from the outside; however, it is not as complex and is 
much less expensive because it is similar to installing an IEEE 802.11 access point.

660 
Chapter 19 ■ Mobile Device Problem Analysis and Troubleshooting
No Wireless Network Connectivity
Several components of a network can cause connectivity issues with wireless networking. 
Keep in mind that wireless networks are not bound by a physical medium such as 
Ethernet cable; therefore, issues other than wiring may result in either no connectivity or 
intermittent connection problems. Wireless LAN technology operates at Layer 1 and Layer 
2 of the OSI model and is responsible for getting data to other wireless LAN devices and to 
the wired distribution system. The “wireless” problem may be only one part of the trouble-
shooting process. Troubleshooting end-to-end wireless LAN problems that include both 
wireless and wired networks may be another process altogether. Therefore, knowledge of 
troubleshooting the wired network will also be benefi cial to the network administrator. 
In cellular communications, the wireless connection is from the end user device such as 
a smartphone to the nearest cell tower, and you are limited on what you can do with regard 
to troubleshooting this type of connection. One example is that you may have a strong 
enough signal to send a text message but not a strong enough signal to make a voice call. 
It is important to understand the limitations with cellular communications you may have 
to deal with as part of the troubleshooting process. One example of such limitations is that 
chances are you will not have access to the cellular infrastructure devices. With wireless 
LAN technology, an engineer would have full access to all equipment. 
Let’s review some of the OSI model information discussed in Chapter 1, “Computer 
Network Types, Topologies, and the OSI Model.” The Physical layer provides the medium 
for connectivity (the air) in a wireless network and is used to carry radio frequency infor-
mation that contains the computer data. This layer also includes components such as 
network adapter cards, which provide an interface to the wireless computer or other wire-
less device. Layer 1 connectivity provides the capability to transfer information that is sent 
between devices. Figure 19.4 illustrates the Physical layer and wireless connectivity.
F I G U R E  19. 4   The lower two layers of the OSI model are responsible for the operation 
of wireless networks. The Physical layer provides a connection between devices.

issue that will not affect a large number of devices or users. The following problems can 
cause client-side lack of connectivity:
 
■
Disabled radio or wireless network adapter
 
■
Misconfigured wireless client utility
 
■
Microsoft Windows AutoConfig service not running or not configured
 
■
Protective supplicants (wireless client device side) that can disable the radio in response 
to specific policy violations
A disabled radio or client adapter in a wireless client device can cause a lack of con-
nectivity. Many devices, such as notebook computers, have physical switches or a combi-
nation of keys that can disable a radio. In many cases, a user does not even realize they 
turned off the physical switch for the wireless LAN radio. A disabled radio cannot provide 
RF communication between the client device and the wireless infrastructure, such as an 
access point. With the Microsoft Windows operating system, there are built-in diag-
nostics and troubleshooting that may help with some wireless LAN connectivity issues. 
Figure 19.5 shows the wireless connection dialog box as “Not connected.” If you click the 
Troubleshoot link, Windows 7 will go through a series of steps to try to resolve the issue. In

mine this and identifi ed the problem.

If a client utility is misconfi gured—for example, an incorrect SSID is specifi ed—it 
would cause a lack of connectivity for the wireless client device. Client utilities have the 
capability to specify the SSID as a parameter. If the client does not see an access point with 
the specifi ed SSID, it will not be able to connect to the IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN. This 
feature in a client device is often set by selecting to connect to a preferred SSID only by 
using a specifi c profi le.
Remember that the service set identifier (SSID) is case sensitive and has 
a maximum length of 32 characters, or 32 octets, as defined in the IEEE 
802.11 standard. Incorrect use of case in the SSID can lead to a lack of con-
nectivity because the SSID will not match. Uppercase and lowercase 
letters are different ASCII characters. This can also lead to unnecessary 
help desk calls. Client devices will not connect to the wireless LAN if they 
have an incorrect SSID specified in the wireless client utility profile. This 
could be unintentional (accidental) or in some cases intentional, such as for 
the purpose of getting around a firewall or other SSID restriction.
The Windows built-in wireless client utility is a popular client utility for connecting 
to IEEE 802.11 wireless networks. The Windows wireless service (Microsoft Windows 7 
AutoConfi g service) runs as a service or background process in the Microsoft Windows 
operating systems. If this service is not running or if the client device is not confi gured 
correctly to use Windows wireless services, the wireless client device will not be able to 
connect to the wireless network unless a third-party client utility from the adapter manu-
facturer is used. Figure 19.6 illustrates some of these potential issues from a wireless client 
device that may cause a lack of connectivity to the wireless network infrastructure.
Roaming and Transition Issues
You learned in Chapter 6, “Computer Network Infrastructure Devices,” that Layer 2 (Data 
Link layer) transition (roaming) occurs when a computer or other wireless client device 
moves out of the radio cell of the currently associated access point and connects to a differ-
ent AP, maintaining Layer 2 connectivity. In a cellular system, this is equivalent to a user 
moving from one cell tower to another with a disruption of the signal. In a well-designed 
network, this should be a straightforward process. However, in certain cases it can also be 
a troublesome area. Roaming issues can be the result of several problems:
 
■
Low signal strength between access points
 
■
Insufficient RF cell overlap
 
■
Incompatible configurations such as SSID or frequency band
It is important to remember that roaming is always decided by the mobile or client device. 
The criteria used will determine when a device will initiate a roam. This may include roam-
ing aggressiveness or a specifi c threshold setting on the mobile device. Some wireless LAN 
manufacturers use proprietary mechanisms that will help with the roaming process. One 

Common Over-the-Air Connectivity Problems 
663
example is in the single-channel architecture (SCA) model in which all the radio frequency 
is handled by the controller. In this case, the wireless LAN controller will move the wireless 
client device transparently as it changes its physical position within the coverage area. In 
other cases manufacturers may require the client device to roam for load balancing purposes 
and will direct the device to a different wireless access point.

Cellular Device Activation Issues
A cellular device such as a smartphone, tablet, or hotspot will require activation on the 
wireless carrier’s cellular network. The activation of a new or replacement device will allow 
it to become authorized and usable on the network. Most carriers provide a straightfor-
ward activation process, and activation can be accomplished via an activation page by call-
ing into the activation line. If everything is set up with the carrier correctly, the activation 
should go very smoothly. However, occasionally cellular activation will fail for a variety of 
reasons. If you have adequate signal, the best option would be to contact the carrier’s tech-
nical support and have them walk you through the process.
Access Point Name Issues
An access point name (APN) is the name of a gateway between a 3G, 4G, or GPRS cellular 
mobile network and another computer network, usually the Internet. Do not confuse this 
with an IEEE 802.11 wireless access point. APNs are fi elds that must be completed with 

664 
Chapter 19 ■ Mobile Device Problem Analysis and Troubleshooting
information to allow a device to have a connection to a wireless carrier’s data services. 
Because cellular communications are carried out via licensed radio frequency bands, access 
point names are required. Each mobile device that uses the APN, such as a smartphone or 
a cell phone, needs to be confi gured with this information. Otherwise, the user may experi-
ence connection problems or service problems.
Wireless Network Saturation
With the increasing number of wireless devices (three to fi ve per person), network capac-
ity is an important design consideration. The types of applications that are in use on the 
network will also have an impact on the wireless network performance. Remember, wire-
less networks are contention based and use a shared medium. Every device must contend to 
win the medium to allow them to transmit data. The more devices that are connected to an 
access point, the more contention there is and the more performance will be degraded.
Network saturation is not only limited to wireless local area networks. Cellular net-
works also suffer from this problem. Because the number of devices continues to 
increase, mobile device data traffi c is expected to grow at a rate of 66 percent from 2012 
to 2017. Capacity planning is just as much of a concern in cellular networks as it is in 
wireless LANs.
Troubleshooting Common Security 
Problems
The following are some common security-related issues that pertain to mobile and wireless 
communications:
 
■
Authentication failures
 
■
Non-expiring passwords
 
■
Expired passwords
 
■
Expired certificates
 
■
Misconfigured firewalls
 
■
False negatives
 
■
False positives
 
■
Content filtering misconfigurations
Authentication Failures
Authentication failures could be the result of a variety of issues. It could be simply that the 
user mistyped or forgot their password or the result of a potential intrusion. In addition to 

Troubleshooting Common Security Problems 
665
password issues, certifi cates can cause authentication failures. In some cases authentication 
failures could cause an alert to be sent to an administrator from an intrusion detection 
system (IDS) if the set threshold is reached. Because this type of problem is wide ranging, 
you should gather as much information as possible from the user to help you effectively 
narrow down the source of the problem.
Non-expiring Passwords
A password that is set to not expire would be specifi ed in a network security policy. A 
legitimate reason to allow non-expiring passwords is also important. If a password does 
not expire, that may pose a security risk because it increases the possibility of an intruder 
gaining access to a network by discovering a password. This is a practice some network 
administrators may implement on their own account because they have the ability to do so. 
If the administrator’s account is compromised, then the person that has gained access for 
the most part has the “keys to the kingdom.” 
There are some reasons you may want to implement this setting with specifi c user 
accounts. One example is an application that needs to log into this system in order to 
function. In some cases the application requires a network user to run as a service. If the 
password expired, the user created for the service would not be able to log on; therefore the 
application would not function correctly.
Expired Passwords
Corporate security policy will determine the company password expiration interval. 
Requiring passwords to be renewed at specifi c intervals will enhance network security. 
Common policy will require users to change passwords every 30 to 90 days. Depending on 
the organization, this interval could be shorter. An expired password may not allow a user 
to log in to a system or mobile device.
Expired Certificates
Recall from Chapter 16 that a digital certifi cate will ensure that only valid authorized users 
can gain access to the corporate network infrastructure. Client-side digital certifi cates are 
used to validate a user’s identity and help protect network resources. Keep in mind that in 
a full public key infrastructure (PKI), servers as well as client devices require certifi cates. 
Certifi cates have an expiration date, and they must be renewed prior to the expiration date. 
An expired certifi cate on a web server does not necessarily mean that the website cannot be 
trusted. There is a good possibility that whoever the certifi cate was originally issued to 
simply neglected to renew before the expiration date and that may be an oversight. 
However, this does reduce the trust of the user who is accessing the site. A user with an 
expired certifi cate may not continue to do business with an organization, which can result 
in lost revenue. From the client side, an expired certifi cate will cause authentication errors 
resulting in lost productivity.

Chapter 19 ■ Mobile Device Problem Analysis and Troubleshooting
Misconfigured Firewalls
Misconfi gured fi rewalls can pose a big security threat and are the cause of most security 
breaches. Remember that a fi rewall can consist of either hardware or software that will 
analyze the contents of a packet and potentially restrict packets from entering or leaving a 
network. In addition to allowing for a security breach, misconfi gured fi rewalls can cause 
unnecessary technical support issues, such as a user not able to access the required informa-
tion because of a blocked port.
False Negatives
When you should be alerted of an event of some type but are not, this is considered a false 
negative. Here we will look at a false negative in relation to wireless LAN technology. Say 
you are using a wireless intrusion prevention system (WIPS) solution to monitor and miti-
gate potential threats to your wireless network. A potential Layer 2 denial of service attack 
(deauthentication, for example) has occurred and you were not alerted. One reason this 
could happen is because the threshold setting to alert after a specifi c number of deauthenti-
cation frames were detected may have been set to an incorrect value. Another possibility is 
that the WIPS software did not have accurate signatures for this type of attack. An experi-
enced intruder may have the knowledge and skill set to be able to elude certain systems and 
get around thresholds and signatures, which will allow for the false negatives to occur. This 
can easily become a complex issue. Systems that provide alerts such as WIPS technology 
must be confi gured correctly to ensure that they operate as intended.
False Positives
A false positive is the result of something that is identifi ed as a problem even though it is 
legitimate. One example of this is antispam software. If a user opens an email message 
that is considered spam and clicks on a link within the message, there is a possibility the 
user can be driven to an undesirable website and potentially become infected with a virus 
or malware. To protect against these types of attacks, users and network administrators 
can use antispam software. The intention of this software is to identify potentially harmful 
spam messages and protect the user. A false positive is when a valid or legitimate message 
is inadvertently marked as spam. These messages may simply be marked as such or may be 
rejected by the email server. In the WIPS example described earlier, there is a possibility 
that a WIPS may send an alert identifying an event as an issue or problem even though it 
is normal operation. Accurate confi guration, monitoring, and baselines will help lessen the 
possibility of false positives. 
Content Filtering Misconfigurations
The purpose of content fi ltering is to restrict users from accessing certain web content, 
including email access from the local network. This is typically accomplished using a 

Chapter Essentials 
667
software package designed for this specifi c purpose. Content fi ltering will provide more 
granular control over what users are accessing from the corporate network. The ability 
to access certain types of content could cause a decrease in employee productivity or may 
cause legal issues for the company. Content fi ltering is also used on home networks to allow 
parents to control what is being accessed from their own network. Misconfi gurations in 
this arena could allow users to circumvent corporate policy and cause other issues for an 
organization.
Summary
In this chapter you learned that troubleshooting and maintenance are important parts of a 
successful network deployment. A key step in troubleshooting networking problems is to 
identify whether an issue is a global problem or an isolated (individual) problem. Global 
problems often include wired and wireless infrastructure components, many client devices, 
or a complete network failure. An isolated problem will be confi ned to a single device or 
user. Understanding this nature of the problem will ease the troubleshooting process. 
You also learned that wireless communications uses transceivers to communicate and 
the unbounded medium must be taken into consideration as a potential source of a prob-
lem. Understanding symptoms and changes to the environment are key components to the 
troubleshooting process, and documentation is a must. 
We also explored common problems you come across within the mobile device 
environment, including battery life, synchronization issues, and problems with power 
adapters, to name a few. We explored common over-the-air problems including latency, 
poor or no signals with both cellular and wireless LAN technology, and roaming issues. 
Finally, you saw some common security-related problems, including authentication failures, 
password-related issues, and fi rewall misconfi gurations. 
Chapter Essentials
Understand the difference between a global problem and an isolated problem.  The trou-
bleshooting process can be simplifi ed by fi rst determining if a problem is related to a large 
number of devices (global) or an isolated (individual) user.
Understand the importance of transceiver communications.  Wireless communica-
tions, including cellular and wireless networking, use radios to send information over an 
unbounded medium, which can contribute to mobile device problems. Understand that 
these devices can transmit or receive data and are known as transceivers.
Understand the four steps of troubleshooting wireless related problems.  Know that you 
must (1) establish the cause of the problem, (2) test to determine the cause, (3) establish a 

668 
Chapter 19 ■ Mobile Device Problem Analysis and Troubleshooting
plan of action, and (4) implement the solution. Be familiar with the order in which these 
steps are performed.
Know that gathering information, understanding symptoms, and recognizing changes to 
the environment are key components of troubleshooting.  Be familiar with these stages of 
the troubleshooting process and the information obtained will provide the ability to trou-
bleshoot a variety of wireless-related communications problems.
Understand the common problem areas associated with mobile communications.   Be 
familiar with problems related to mobile devices, including problems with battery life, 
synchronization, power adapters, and others. Common over-the-air problems and common 
security-related problems include authentication failures and password-related issues.

✓Preparing for the CompTIA Mobility+ Exam
 
✓Taking the Exam
 
✓Reviewing Exam Objectives

This book is intended to provide an introduction to the excit-
ing and emerging world of wireless and mobile technology. 
Wireless technologies continue to expand at a  phenomenal 
pace, with constant improvements in speed, performance, reliability, and security. As I 
mentioned in the introduction, this book covers the capabilities of mobile devices and 
the features of over-the-air technologies, including IEEE 802.11 standards based wireless 
networking in addition to cellular and other wireless  technologies such as Bluetooth and 
WiMAX. It also discusses the concepts of how to deploy, integrate, support, and manage 
a mobile environment, ensuring that proper security measures are implemented for devices 
and platforms while usability is maintained. In  addition, you read about topics such as 
topologies and the OSI model, common network  protocols and ports, wireless site surveys, 
backup and restore, and troubleshooting. One way to demonstrate your ability in these 
areas is to attain the CompTIA Mobility+ certifi cation.
To attain this certifi cation, you will need to pass the CompTIA Mobility+ exam 
(MB0-001). The Mobility+ exam is the only mobility technology certifi cation offered by 
CompTIA. It covers all you need to know to deploy, integrate, support, and manage a 
mobile environment. The exam certifi es that the candidate has the knowledge and skills to 
understand and research the capabilities of various mobile devices and aspects of over-the-
air technologies. Professionals who have passed the Mobility+ exam make sure proper secu-
rity measures are maintained for devices and platforms to mitigate risks and threats while 
ensuring usability. The following skills are recommended for the CompTIA Mobility+ 
candidate:
 
■
CompTIA Network+ or equivalent working knowledge
 
■
At least 18 months of work experience in the administration of mobile devices in the 
enterprise
This book covers all the exam objectives, plus more, which will enable you to prepare 
for the certifi cation exam and be successful in your career as a mobile (device management) 
administrator, mobility engineer, and wireless mobility architect.
Preparing for the CompTIA 
Mobility+ Exam
Preparation is a key part to being successful. Now that you have read this book and you are 
ready to take the exam, it is a good idea to consider how the exam will look and feel so that 
nothing takes you by surprise.

Taking the Exam 
671
It is highly recommended that you visit the CompTIA website before taking 
the exam because details about the exam can change. The CompTIA web-
site for this exam is
http://certification.comptia.org/getcertified/certifications/
