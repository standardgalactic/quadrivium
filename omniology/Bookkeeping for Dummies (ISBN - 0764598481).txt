Introduction
B
ookkeepers manage all the financial data for small companies. If you sub-
scribe to the idea that information is power (which I do), you’ll agree
that the bookkeeper has a tremendous amount of power within a company.
Information tracked in the books helps business owners make key decisions
involving sales planning and product offerings and manage many other finan-
cial aspects of their business.
If it weren’t for the hard work of bookkeepers, companies wouldn’t have any
clue about what happens with their financial transactions. Without accurate
financial bookkeeping, a company owner wouldn’t know how many sales
were made, how much cash was collected, or how much cash was paid for
the products sold to customers during the year. He also wouldn’t know how
much cash was paid to employees or how much cash was spent on other
business needs throughout the year.
Accurate and complete financial bookkeeping is crucial to any business
owner, but it’s also important to those who work with the business, such as
investors, financial institutions, and employees. People both inside (managers,
owners, and employees) and outside the business (investors, lenders, and
government agencies) all depend on the bookkeeper’s accurate recording of
financial transactions.
Yes, the bookkeeper’s job is crucial and requires certain skills and talents.
Bookkeepers must be detailed-oriented, enjoy working with numbers, and be
meticulous about accurately entering those numbers in the books. They must
be vigilant about keeping a paper trail and filing all needed backup informa-
tion about the financial transactions entered into the books.
Whether you’re a business owner keeping the books yourself or an employee
keeping the books for a small business owner, your job is critical for the
smooth financial operation of the company.
About This Book
In this book, I introduce you to the key aspects of bookkeeping and how to
set up and use your financial books. I walk you through the basics of book-
keeping: starting with the process of setting up your company’s books and
developing

 A list of your company’s accounts, called the Chart of Accounts.
 Your company’s General Ledger, which summarizes all the activity in a
company’s accounts.
 Your company’s journals, which give details about all your financial
transactions.
Then I take you through the process of recording all your transactions —
sales, purchases and other financial activity. I also talk about how to manage
payroll, governmental reporting, and external financial reporting.
Finally, I show you how to start the yearly cycle all over again by closing out
the necessary accounts for the current year and opening up any new ones for
the next year.
Yes, bookkeeping is a continuous cycle starting with financial transactions,
recording those transactions in journals, posting those transactions to the
General Ledger, testing your books to be sure that they’re in balance, making
any necessary adjustments or corrections to the books to keep them in bal-
ance, preparing financial reports to understand how well the business did
during the year, and finally getting ready to start the process all over again
for the next year.
You find out all about this cycle, starting with Chapter 2 and following the
bookkeeping journey through closing out the year and getting ready for the
next year in Chapter 22.
Conventions Used in This Book
I use QuickBooks Pro throughout this book, so I show you some of its
advanced features where appropriate. I also point out when I use a feature
only available in QuickBooks Pro or a more advanced version.
Foolish Assumptions
While writing this book, I made some key assumptions about who you are
and why you’ve picked up this book to get a better understanding of book-
keeping. I assume that you are:

Bookkeeping For Dummies 

 A business owner who wants to know how to do your own books. You
have a good understanding of business and its terminology but have
little or no knowledge of bookkeeping and accounting.
 A person who does bookkeeping or plans to do bookkeeping for a small
business and needs to know more about how to set up and keep the
books. You have some basic knowledge of business terminology but
don’t know much about bookkeeping or accounting.
 A staff person in a small business who’s just been asked to take over the
company’s bookkeeping duties. You need to know more about how
transactions are entered into the books, how to prove out transactions
to be sure you’re making entries correctly and accurately, and how to
prepare financial reports using the data you collect.
What You’re Not to Read
Throughout Bookkeeping For Dummies, I’ve included a number of examples
of how to apply the basics of bookkeeping to real-life situations. If you’re pri-
marily reading this book to gain a general knowledge of the subject and don’t
need to delve into all the nitty-gritty, day-to-day aspects of bookkeeping, you
may want to skip over the paragraphs marked with the Example icon (see the
section “Icons Used in This Book” later in this Introduction). Skipping the
examples shouldn’t interfere with your grasp on the key aspects of how to
keep the books.
How This Book Is Organized
Bookkeeping For Dummies is divided into six parts, which I outline in the 
following sections.
Part I: Basic Bookkeeping: 
Why You Need It
In Part I, I discuss the importance of bookkeeping, explain how it works, and
help you get started with setting up your company’s books. I also touch on
the terms that are unique to bookkeeping and tell you how to set up the
roadmap for your books, the Chart of Accounts.

Introduction

Part II: Keeping a Paper Trail
In Part II, I explain how you enter your financial transactions in the books,
how you post transactions to your General Ledger (the granddaddy of your
bookkeeping system), and how you track all the transaction details in your
journals. I also give tips for developing a good internal control system for
managing your books and your company’s cash and talk about your options
if you decide to computerize your bookkeeping.
Part III: Tracking Day-to-Day Operations
with Your Books
In Part III, I show you how to track your day-to-day business operations, includ-
ing recording sales and purchases and any adjustments to those sales and
purchases, such as discounts and returns. In addition, I talk about the basics
of setting up and managing employee payroll as well as all the government
paperwork you need to complete as soon as you decide to hire employees.
Part IV: Preparing the Books for Year’s 
(or Month’s) End
In Part IV, I introduce you to the process of preparing your books for closing
out the accounting period, whether you’re closing out the books at the end of
a month or the end of a year. The closing out process involves making key
adjustments to record depreciation of your assets, and calculating and
recording your interest payments and receipts in your books. This part also
covers various aspects of proving out your books, from checking your cash
and testing the balance of your books to making any needed adjustments or
corrections.
Part V: Reporting Results and 
Starting Over
In Part V, I tell you how to use all the information in your books to prepare
reports that show how well your company did during the month, quarter, or
year. I also lay out all the paperwork you have to deal with, including year-
end government reports and IRS forms. Finally, you find out how to close out
the books at year-end and get ready for the next year.

Part VI: The Part of Tens
The Part of Tens is the hallmark of the For Dummies series. In this part, I high-
light the top ten accounts you need to know how to manage and the ten ways
you can efficiently manage your business’s cash using your books.
Icons Used in This Book
For Dummies books use little pictures, called icons, to flag certain chunks of
text that either you shouldn’t want to miss or you’re free to skip. The icons in
Bookkeeping For Dummies are:

 Introducing bookkeeping and its basic purpose
 Maintaining a paper trail
 Managing daily business finances
 Making sure everything’s accurate
 Putting on a financial show
F
ew small business owners actually hire accountants to work full time
for them. For a small business, that expense is probably too great, so
instead, the owner hires a bookkeeper who serves as the company accoun-
tant’s eyes and ears. In return, the accountant helps the bookkeeper develop
good bookkeeping practices and reviews his or her work periodically (usually
monthly).
In this chapter, I provide an overview of a bookkeeper’s work. If you’re just
starting a business, you may be your own bookkeeper for a while until you
can afford to hire one, so think of this chapter as your to-do list.
Delving in to Bookkeeping Basics
Like most business people, you probably have great ideas for running your
own business and just want to get started. You don’t want to sweat the small
stuff, like keeping detailed records of every penny spent; you just want to
quickly build a business in which you can make lots of money.
Well slow down there — this isn’t a race! If you don’t carefully plan your
bookkeeping operation and figure out exactly how and what financial detail
you want to track, you’ll have absolutely no way to measure the success 
(or failure, unfortunately) of your business efforts.

Bookkeeping, when done properly, gives you an excellent gauge of how well
you’re doing. It also provides you with lots of information throughout the
year so you can test the financial success of your business strategies and
make course corrections early in the year if necessary to ensure that you
reach your year-end profit goals.
Bookkeeping can become your best friend for managing your financial assets
and testing your business strategies, so don’t shortchange it. Take the time to
develop your bookkeeping system with your accountant before you even
open your business’s doors and make your first sale.
Picking your accounting method
You can’t keep books unless you know how you want to go about doing so.
The two basic accounting methods you have to choose from are cash-basis
accounting and accrual accounting. The key difference between these two
accounting methods is the point at which you record sales and purchases in
your books. If you choose cash-basis accounting, you only record transac-
tions when cash changes hands. If you use accrual accounting, you record a
transaction when it’s completed, even if cash doesn’t change hands.
For example, suppose your company buys products to sell from a vendor but
doesn’t actually pay for those products for 30 days. If you’re using cash-basis
accounting, you don’t record the purchase until you actually lay out the cash
to the vendor. If you’re using accrual accounting, you record the purchase
when you receive the products, and you also record the future debt in an
account called Accounts Payable.
I talk about the pros and cons of each type of accounting method in Chapter 2.
Understanding assets, liabilities, 
and equity
Every business has three key financial parts that must be kept in balance:
assets, liabilities, and equity. Assets include everything the company owns,
such as cash, inventory, buildings, equipment, and vehicles. Liabilities
include everything the company owes to others, such as vendor bills, credit
card balances, and bank loans. Equity includes the claims owners have on the
assets based on their portion of ownership in the company.
10
Part I: Basic Bookkeeping: Why You Need It 

The formula for keeping your books in balance involves these three elements:
Assets = Liabilities + Equity
Because it’s so important, I talk a lot about how to keep your books in balance
throughout this book. You can find an initial introduction to this concept in
Chapter 2.
Introducing debits and credits
To keep the books, you need to revise your thinking about two common
financial terms: debits and credits. Most nonbookkeepers and nonaccoun-
tants think of debits as subtractions from their bank accounts. The opposite
is true with credits — people usually see these as additions to their accounts,
in most cases in the form of refunds or corrections in favor of the account
holders.
Well, forget all you thought you knew about debits and credits. Debits and
credits are totally different animals in the world of bookkeeping. Because
keeping the books involves a method called double-entry bookkeeping, you
have to make a least two entries — a debit and a credit — into your book-
keeping system for every transaction. Whether that debit or credit adds or
subtracts from an account depends solely upon the type of account.
I know all this debit, credit, and double-entry stuff sounds confusing, but I
promise it will become much clearer as you work through this book. I start
explaining this critical yet somewhat confusing concept in Chapter 2.
Charting your bookkeeping course
You can’t just enter transactions in the books willy-nilly. You need to know
where exactly those transactions fit into the larger bookkeeping system.
That’s where your Chart of Accounts comes in; it’s essentially a list of all the
accounts your business has and what types of transactions go into each one.
I talk more about the Chart of Accounts in Chapter 3.
11
Chapter 1: So You Want to Do the Books

Recognizing the Importance 
of an Accurate Paper Trail
Keeping the books is all about creating an accurate paper trail. You want to
track of all your company’s financial transactions so if a question comes up
at a later date, you can turn to the books to figure out what went wrong.
An accurate paper trail is the only way to track your financial successes and
review your financial failures, a task that’s vitally important in order to grow
your business. You need to know what works successfully so you can repeat
it in the future and build on your success. On the other hand, you need to
know what failed so you can correct it and avoid making the same mistake
again.
All your business’s financial transactions are summarized in the General
Ledger, and journals keep track of the tiniest details of each transaction. You
can make your information gathering more effective by using a computerized
accounting system, which gives you access to your financial information in
many different formats. Controlling who enters this financial information into
your books and who can access it afterwards is smart business and involves
critical planning on your part. I address all these concepts in the following
sections.
Maintaining a ledger
The granddaddy of your bookkeeping system is the General Ledger. In this
ledger, you keep a summary of all your accounts and the financial activities
that took place involving those accounts throughout the year.
You draw upon the General Ledger’s account summaries to develop your
financial reports on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis. You can also use
these account summaries to develop internal reports that help you make key
business decisions. I talk more about developing and maintaining the General
Ledger in Chapter 4.
Keeping journals
Small companies conduct hundreds, if not thousands, of transactions each
year. If every transaction were kept in the General Ledger, that record would
become unwieldy and difficult to use. Instead, most companies keep a series
of journals that detail activity in their most active accounts.
12
Part I: Basic Bookkeeping: Why You Need It 

For example, almost every company has a Cash Receipts Journal in which to
keep the detail for all incoming cash and a Cash Disbursements Journal in
which to keep the detail for all outgoing cash. Other journals can detail sales,
purchases, customer accounts, vendor accounts, and any other key accounts
that see significant activity.
You decide which accounts you want to create journals for based on your busi-
ness operation and your need for information about key financial transactions.
I talk more about the importance of journals, the accounts commonly journal-
ized, and the process of maintaining journals in Chapter 5.
Consider computerizing
Many companies today use computerized accounting systems to keep their
books. You should consider using one of these systems rather than trying to
keep your books on paper. You’ll find your bookkeeping takes less time and is
probably more accurate with a computerized system.
In addition to increasing accuracy and cutting the time it takes to do your
bookkeeping, computerized accounting also makes designing reports easier.
These reports can then be used to help make business decisions. Your comput-
erized accounting system stores detailed information about every transaction,
so you can group that detail in any way that may assist your decision making.
I talk more about computerized accounting systems in Chapter 6.
Instituting internal controls
Every business owner needs to be concerned with keeping tight controls on
company cash and how it’s used. One way to institute this control is by plac-
ing internal restrictions on who has access to enter information into your
books and who has access necessary to use that information.
You also need to carefully control who has the ability to accept cash receipts
and who has the ability to disburse your business’s cash. Separating duties
appropriately helps you protect your business’s assets from error, theft, and
fraud. I talk more about controlling your cash and protecting your financial
records in Chapter 7.
13
Chapter 1: So You Want to Do the Books

Using Bookkeeping’s Tools 
to Manage Daily Finances
After you set up your business’s books and put in place your internal controls,
you’re ready to use the systems you established to manage the day-to-day
operations of your business. You’ll quickly see how a well-designed book-
keeping system can make your job of managing your business’s finances
much easier.
Maintaining inventory
If your company keeps inventory on hand or in warehouses, tracking the
costs of the products you plan to sell is critical for managing your profit
potential. If you see inventory costs trending upward, you may need to adjust
your own prices in order to maintain your profit margin. You certainly don’t
want to wait until the end of the year to find out how much your inventory
cost you.
You also must keep careful watch on how much inventory you have on hand
and how much was sold. Inventory can get damaged, discarded, or stolen,
meaning that your physical inventory counts may differ from the counts you
have in your books. Do a physical count periodically — at least monthly for
most businesses and possibly daily for active retail stores.
In addition to watching for signs of theft or poor handling of inventory, make
sure you have enough inventory on hand to satisfy your customers’ needs.
I talk more about how to use your bookkeeping system to manage inventory
in Chapter 8.
Tracking sales
Everyone wants to know how well their sales are doing. If you keep your
books up-to-date and accurate, you can get those numbers very easily on a
daily basis. You can also watch sales trends as often as you think necessary,
whether that’s daily, weekly, or monthly.
Use the information collected by your bookkeeping system to monitor sales,
review discounts offered to customers, and track the return of products. 
All three elements are critical to gauging the success of the sales of your
products.
14
Part I: Basic Bookkeeping: Why You Need It 

If you find you need to offer discounts more frequently in order to encourage
sales, you may need to review your pricing, and you definitely need to research
market conditions to determine the cause of this sales weakness. The cause
may be new activities by an aggressive competitor or simply a slow market
period. Either way, you need to understand the weakness and figure out how
to maintain your profit goals in spite of any obstacles.
While sales tracking reveals an increase in the number of your products
being returned, you need to research the issue and find the reason for the
increase. Perhaps the quality of the product you’re selling is declining, and
you need to find a new supplier. Whatever the reason, an increased number
of product returns is usually a sign of a problem that needs to be researched
and corrected.
I talk more about how to use the bookkeeping system for tracking sales, dis-
counts, and returns in Chapter 9.
Handling payroll
Payroll can be a huge nightmare for many companies. Payroll requires you to
comply with a lot of government regulation and fill out a lot of government
paperwork. You also have to worry about collecting payroll taxes and paying
employer taxes. And if you pay employee benefits, you have yet another layer
of record keeping to deal with.
I talk more about managing payroll and government requirements in Chapters
10 and 11. I also talk about year-end payroll obligations in Chapter 20.
Running Tests for Accuracy
All the time it takes to track your transactions isn’t worth it if you don’t peri-
odically test to be sure you’ve entered those transactions accurately. The old
adage, “Garbage in, garbage out” holds very true for bookkeeping: If the num-
bers you put into your bookkeeping system are garbage, the reports you
develop from those numbers will be garbage as well.
Proving out your cash
The first step in testing out your books includes proving that your cash trans-
actions are accurately recorded. This process involves checking a number of
difference transactions and elements, including the cash taken in on a daily
basis by your cashiers and the accuracy of your checking account. I talk
about all the steps necessary to take to prove out your cash in Chapter 14.
15
Chapter 1: So You Want to Do the Books

Testing your balance
After you prove out your cash (see Chapter 14), you can check that you’ve
recorded everything else in your books just as precisely. Review the accounts
for any glaring errors and then test whether or not they’re in balance by doing
a trial balance. You can find out more about trial balances in Chapter 16.
Doing bookkeeping corrections
You may not find your books in balance the first time you do a trial balance,
but don’t worry. It’s rare to find your books in balance on the first try. In
Chapter 17, I explain common adjustments that may be needed as you prove
out your books at the end of an accounting period, and I also explain how to
make the necessary corrections.
Finally Showing Off Your 
Financial Success
Proving out your books and ensuring their balance means you finally get to
show what your company has accomplished financially by developing
reports to present to others. It’s almost like putting your business on a stage
and taking a bow — well . . . at least you hope you’ve done well enough to
take a bow.
If you’ve taken advantage of your bookkeeping information and reviewed and
consulted it throughout the year, you should have a good idea of how well
your business is doing. You also should have taken any course corrections to
ensure that your end-of-the-year reports look great.
Preparing financial reports
Most businesses prepare at least two key financial reports, the balance sheet
and the income statement, which it can show to company outsiders, includ-
ing the financial institutions from which the company borrows money and
the company’s investors.
16
Part I: Basic Bookkeeping: Why You Need It 

The balance sheet is a snapshot of your business’s financial health as of a
particular date. The balance sheet should show that your company’s assets
are equal to the value of your liabilities and your equity. It’s called a balance
sheet because it’s based on a balanced formula:
Assets = Liabilities + Equity
The income statement summarizes your company’s financial transactions for
a particular time period, such as a month, quarter, or year. This financial
statement starts with your revenues, subtracts the costs of goods sold, and
then subtracts any expenses incurred in operating the business. The bottom
line of the income statement shows how much profit your company made
during the accounting period. If you haven’t done well, the income statement
shows how much you’ve lost.
I explain how to prepare a balance sheet in Chapter 18, and I talk more about
developing an income statement in Chapter 19.
Paying taxes
Most small businesses don’t have to pay taxes. Instead, their profits are
reported on the personal tax returns of the company owners, whether that’s
one person (a sole proprietorship) or two or more people (a partnership). Only
companies that have incorporated, become a separate legal entity in which
investors buy stock (which I explain further in Chapter 21), must file and pay
taxes. (Partnerships and LLCs do not pay taxes unless they filed a special
form to be taxed as a corporation, but they do have to file information
returns, which detail how much the company made and how much profit
each owner earned plus any costs and expenses incurred.)
I talk more about business structures and how they’re taxed in Chapter 21.

A
ll businesses need to keep track of their financial transactions — that’s
why bookkeeping and bookkeepers are so important. Without accurate
records, how can you tell whether your business is making a profit or taking a
loss?
In this chapter, I cover the key parts of bookkeeping by introducing you to
the language of bookkeeping, familiarizing you with how bookkeepers
manage the accounting cycle, and showing you how to understand the most
difficult type of bookkeeping — double-entry bookkeeping.
Bookkeepers: The Record Keepers 
of the Business World
Bookkeeping, the methodical way in which businesses track their financial
transactions, is rooted in accounting. Accounting is the total structure of
records and procedures used to record, classify, and report information
about a business’s financial transactions. Bookkeeping involves the recording
of that financial information into the accounting system while maintaining
adherence to solid accounting principles.

Bookkeepers are the ones who toil day in and day out to ensure that transac-
tions are accurately recorded. Bookkeepers need to be very detail oriented
and love to work with numbers because numbers and the accounts they go
into are just about all these people see all day. Bookkeepers are not required
to be a certified public accountant (CPA).
Many small business people who are just starting up their businesses initially
serve as their own bookkeepers until the business is large enough to hire
someone dedicated to keeping the books. Few small businesses have accoun-
tants on staff to check the books and prepare official financial reports; instead,
they have bookkeepers on staff who serve as the outside accountants’ eyes
and ears. Most businesses do seek an accountant with a CPA certification.
In many small businesses today, a bookkeeper enters the business transac-
tions on a daily basis while working inside the company. At the end of each
month or quarter, the bookkeeper sends summary reports to the accountant
who then checks the transactions for accuracy and prepares financial 
statements.
In most cases, the accounting system is initially set up with the help of an
accountant in order to be sure it uses solid accounting principles. That
accountant periodically stops by the office and reviews the system’s use to
be sure transactions are being handled properly.
Accurate financial reports are the only way you can know how your business
is doing. These reports are developed using the information you, as the book-
keeper, enter into your accounting system. If that information isn’t accurate,
your financial reports are meaningless. As the old adage goes, “Garbage in,
garbage out.”
Wading through Basic 
Bookkeeping Lingo
Before you can take on bookkeeping and start keeping the books, the first
thing you must get a handle on are key accounting terms. The following is a
list of terms that all bookkeepers use on a daily basis.
Note: This isn’t an exhaustive list of all the unique terms you need to know
as a bookkeeper. For full coverage of bookkeeping terminology, turn to the
Glossary at the back of the book.
20
Part I: Basic Bookkeeping: Why You Need It 

Accounts for the balance sheet
Here are a few terms you’ll want to know:
 Balance sheet: The financial statement that presents a snapshot of the
company’s financial position (assets, liabilities, and equity) as of a par-
ticular date in time. It’s called a balance sheet because the things owned
by the company (assets) must equal the claims against those assets 
(liabilities and equity).
On an ideal balance sheet, the total assets should equal the total liabilities
plus the total equity. If your numbers fit this formula, the company’s books
are in balance. (I discuss the balance sheet in greater detail in Chapter 18.)
 Assets: All the things a company owns in order to successfully run its
business, such as cash, buildings, land, tools, equipment, vehicles, and
furniture.
 Liabilities: All the debts the company owes, such as bonds, loans, and
unpaid bills.
 Equity: All the money invested in the company by its owners. In a small
business owned by one person or a group of people, the owner’s equity
is shown in a Capital account. In a larger business that’s incorporated,
owner’s equity is shown in shares of stock. Another key Equity account
is Retained Earnings, which tracks all company profits that have been
reinvested in the company rather than paid out to the company’s
owners. Small unincorporated businesses track money paid out to
owners in a Drawing account, whereas incorporated businesses dole out
money to owners by paying dividends (a portion of the company’s prof-
its paid by share of common stock for the quarter or year).
Accounts for the income statement
Here are a few terms related to the income statement that you’ll want to
know:
 Income statement: The financial statement that presents a summary of
the company’s financial activity over a certain period of time, such as a
month, quarter, or year. The statement starts with Revenue earned, sub-
tracts out the Costs of Goods Sold and the Expenses, and ends with the
bottom line — Net Profit or Loss. (I show you how to develop an income
statement in Chapter 19.)
 Revenue: All money collected in the process of selling the company’s
goods and services. Some companies also collect revenue through other
means, such as selling assets the business no longer needs or earning
interest by offering short-term loans to employees or other businesses.
(I discuss how to track revenue in Chapter 9.)
21
Chapter 2: Getting Down to Bookkeeping Basics

 Costs of goods sold: All money spent to purchase or make the products
or services a company plans to sell to its customers. (I talk about pur-
chasing goods for sale to customers in Chapter 8.)
 Expenses: All money spent to operate the company that’s not directly
related to the sale of individual goods or services. (I review common
types of expenses in Chapter 3.)
Other common terms
Some other common terms include the following:
 Accounting period: The time for which financial information is being
tracked. Most businesses track their financial results on a monthly
basis, so each accounting period equals one month. Some businesses
choose to do financial reports on a quarterly basis, so the accounting
periods are three months. Other businesses only look at their results on
a yearly basis, so their accounting periods are 12 months. Businesses
that track their financial activities monthly usually also create quarterly
and annual reports (a year-end summary of the company’s activities and
financial results) based on the information they gather.
 Accounts Receivable: The account used to track all customer sales that
are made by store credit. Store credit refers not to credit card sales but
rather to sales in which the customer is given credit directly by the
store and the store needs to collect payment from the customer at a
later date. (I discuss how to monitor Accounts Receivable in Chapter 9.)
 Accounts Payable: The account used to track all outstanding bills from
vendors, contractors, consultants, and any other companies or indi-
viduals from whom the company buys goods or services. (I talk about
managing Accounts Payable in Chapter 8.)
 Depreciation: An accounting method used to track the aging and use of
assets. For example, if you own a car, you know that each year you use
the car its value is reduced (unless you own one of those classic cars
that goes up in value). Every major asset a business owns ages and
eventually needs replacement, including buildings, factories, equipment,
and other key assets. (I discuss how you monitor depreciation in
Chapter 12.)
 General Ledger: Where all the company’s accounts are summarized.
The General Ledger is the granddaddy of the bookkeeping system. 
(I discuss posting to the General Ledger in Chapter 5.)
 Interest: The money a company needs to pay if it borrows money from a
bank or other company. For example, when you buy a car using a car loan,
you must pay not only the amount you borrowed but also additional
money, or interest, based on a percent of the amount you borrowed. (I dis-
cuss how to track interest expenses in a business’s books in Chapter 13.)
22
Part I: Basic Bookkeeping: Why You Need It 

 Inventory: The account that tracks all products that will be sold to cus-
tomers. (I review inventory valuation and control in Chapter 8.)
 Journals: Where bookkeepers keep records (in chronological order) 
of daily company transactions. Each of the most active accounts, includ-
ing cash, Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable, has its own journal. 
(I discuss entering information into journals in Chapter 4.)
 Payroll: The way a company pays its employees. Managing payroll is a
key function of the bookkeeper and involves reporting many aspects of
payroll to the government, including taxes to be paid on behalf of the
employee, unemployment taxes, and workman’s compensation. (I dis-
cuss employee payroll in Chapter 10 and the government side of payroll
reporting in Chapter 11.)
 Trial balance: How you test to be sure the books are in balance before
pulling together information for the financial reports and closing the
books for the accounting period. (I discuss how to do a trial balance in
Chapter 16.)
Pedaling through the Accounting Cycle
As a bookkeeper, you complete your work by completing the tasks of the
accounting cycle. It’s called a cycle because the workflow is circular: entering
transactions, manipulating the transactions through the accounting cycle,
closing the books at the end of the accounting period, and then starting the
entire cycle again for the next accounting period.
The accounting cycle has eight basic steps, which you can see in Figure 2-1.
1. Transactions: Financial transactions start the process. Transactions can
include the sale or return of a product, the purchase of supplies for busi-
ness activities, or any other financial activity that involves the exchange
of the company’s assets, the establishment or payoff of a debt, or the
deposit from or payout of money to the company’s owners. All sales and
expenses are transactions that must be recorded. I cover transactions in
greater detail throughout the book as I discuss how to record the basics
of business activities — recording sales, purchases, asset acquisition, or
sale, taking on new debt, or paying off debt.
2. Journal entries: The transaction is listed in the appropriate journal,
maintaining the journal’s chronological order of transactions. (The jour-
nal is also known as the “book of original entry” and is the first place a
transaction is listed.) I talk more about journal entries in Chapter 5.
23
Chapter 2: Getting Down to Bookkeeping Basics

3. Posting: The transactions are posted to the account that it impacts.
These accounts are part of the General Ledger, where you can find a
summary of all the business’s accounts. I discuss posting in Chapters 4
and 5.
4. Trial balance: At the end of the accounting period (which may be a
month, quarter, or year depending on your business’s practices), you
calculate a trial balance.
5. Worksheet: Unfortunately, many times your first calculation of the trial
balance shows that the books aren’t in balance. If that’s the case, you
look for errors and make corrections called adjustments, which are
tracked on a worksheet. Adjustments are also made to account for the
depreciation of assets and to adjust for one-time payments (such as
insurance) that should be allocated on a monthly basis to more accu-
rately match monthly expenses with monthly revenues. After you make
and record adjustments, you take another trial balance to be sure the
accounts are in balance.

6. Adjusting journal entries: You post any corrections needed to the
affected accounts once your trial balance shows the accounts will be bal-
anced once the adjustments needed are made to the accounts. You don’t
need to make adjusting entries until the trial balance process is com-
pleted and all needed corrections and adjustments have been identified.
7. Financial statements: You prepare the balance sheet and income state-
ment using the corrected account balances.
8. Closing: You close the books for the revenue and expense accounts and
begin the entire cycle again with zero balances in those accounts.
As a businessperson, you want to be able to gauge your profit or loss on
month by month, quarter by quarter, and year by year bases. To do that,
Revenue and Expense accounts must start with a zero balance at the
beginning of each accounting period. In contrast, you carry over Asset,
Liability, and Equity account balances from cycle to cycle because the
business doesn’t start each cycle by getting rid of old assets and buying
new assets, paying off and then taking on new debt, or paying out all
claims to owners and then collecting the money again.
Tackling the Big Decision: Cash-basis 
or Accrual Accounting
Before starting to record transactions, you must decide whether to use 
cash-basis or accrual accounting. The crucial difference between these two
processes is in how you record your cash transactions.
Waiting for funds with cash-basis
accounting
With cash-basis accounting, you record all transactions in the books when
cash actually changes hands, meaning when cash payment is received by the
company from customers or paid out by the company for purchases or other
services. Cash receipt or payment can be in the form of cash, check, credit
card, electronic transfer, or other means used to pay for an item.
Cash-basis accounting can’t be used if a store sells products on store credit
and bills the customer at a later date. There is no provision to record and
track money due from customers at some time in the future in the cash-basis
accounting method.
25
Chapter 2: Getting Down to Bookkeeping Basics

That’s also true for purchases. With the cash-basis accounting method, the
owner only records the purchase of supplies or goods that will later be sold
when he actually pays cash. If he buys goods on credit to be paid later, he
doesn’t record the transaction until the cash is actually paid out.
Depending on the size of your business, you may want to start out with cash-
basis accounting. Many small businesses run by a sole proprietor or a small
group of partners use cash-basis accounting because it’s easy. But as the
business grows, the business owners find it necessary to switch to accrual
accounting in order to more accurately track revenues and expenses.
Cash-basis accounting does a good job of tracking cash flow, but it does a
poor job of matching revenues earned with money laid out for expenses. This
deficiency is a problem particularly when, as it often happens, a company
buys products in one month and sells those products in the next month. For
example, you buy products in June with the intent to sell and pay $1,000
cash. You don’t sell the products until July, and that’s when you receive cash
for the sales. When you close the books at the end of June, you have to show
the $1,000 expense with no revenue to offset it, meaning you have a loss that
month. When you sell the products for $1,500 in July, you have a $1,500 profit.
So, your monthly report for June shows a $1,000 loss, and your monthly report
for July shows a $1,500 profit, when in actuality you had revenues of $500
over the two months.
In this book, I concentrate on the accrual accounting method. If you choose
to use cash-basis accounting, don’t panic: You can still find most of the book-
keeping information here useful, but you don’t need to maintain some of the
accounts I list, such as Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable, because
26
Part I: Basic Bookkeeping: Why You Need It 
Making the switch to accrual accounting
Changing between the cash-basis and accrual
basis of accounting may not be simple, and you
should check with your accountant to be sure
you do it right. You may even need to get per-
mission from the IRS, which tests whether
you’re seeking an unfair tax advantage when
making the switch. You must even complete the
IRS form Change in Accounting Method (Form
3115) within 180 days before the end of the 
year for which you make this change. You don’t
need to fill out Form 3115 if your business activ-
ity is changing fundamentally. For example, 
if you started as a service business and shifted
to a business that carries inventory, you proba-
bly won’t need permission for the accounting
method change.
Businesses that should never use cash-basis
accounting include
 Businesses that carry an inventory
 Businesses that incorporated as a C corpo-
ration (more on incorporation in Chapter 21)
 Businesses with gross annual sales that
exceed $5 million

you aren’t recording transactions until cash actually changes hands. If you’re
using a cash-basis accounting system and sell things on credit, though, you
better have a way to track what people owe you.
Recording right away with accrual
accounting
With accrual accounting, you record all transactions in the books when they
occur, even if no cash changes hands. For example, if you sell on store credit,
you record the transaction immediately and enter it into an Accounts
Receivable account until you receive payment. If you buy goods on credit,
you immediately enter the transaction into an Accounts Payable account
until you pay out cash.
Like cash-basis accounting, accrual accounting has its drawbacks. It does a
good job of matching revenues and expenses, but it does a poor job of track-
ing cash. Because you record revenue when the transaction occurs and not
when you collect the cash, your income statement can look great even if
you don’t have cash in the bank. For example, suppose you’re running a 
contracting company and completing jobs on a daily basis. You can record
the revenue upon completion of the job even if you haven’t yet collected the
cash. If your customers are slow to pay, you may end up with lots of revenue
but little cash. But don’t worry just yet; in Chapter 9, I tell you how to manage
Accounts Receivable so that you don’t run out of cash because of slow-paying
customers.
Many companies that use the accrual accounting method monitor cash flow
on a weekly basis to be sure they have enough cash on hand to operate the
business. If your business is seasonal, such as a landscaping business with
little to do during the winter months, you can establish short-term lines of
credit through your bank to maintain cash flow through the lean times.
Seeing Double with Double-entry
Bookkeeping
All businesses, whether they use the cash-basis accounting method or the
accrual accounting method (see the section “Tackling the Big Decision: Cash-
basis or Accrual Accounting” for details), use double-entry bookkeeping to
keep their books. A practice that helps minimize errors and increase the
chance that your books balance, double-entry bookkeeping gets its name
because you enter all transactions twice.
27
Chapter 2: Getting Down to Bookkeeping Basics

When it comes to double-entry bookkeeping, the key formula for the balance
sheet (Assets = Liabilities + Equity) plays a major role.
In order to adjust the balance of accounts in the bookkeeping world, you use
a combination of debits and credits. You may think of a debit as a subtraction
because you’ve found that debits usually mean a decrease in your bank bal-
ance. On the other hand, you’ve probably been excited to find unexpected
credits in your bank or credit card that mean more money has been added to
the account in your favor. Now forget all that you ever learned about debits
or credits. In the world of bookkeeping, their meanings aren’t so simple.
The only definite thing when it comes to debits and credits in the bookkeep-
ing world is that a debit is on the left side of a transaction and a credit is on
the right side of a transaction. Everything beyond that can get very muddled.
I show you the basics of debits and credits in this chapter, but don’t worry if
you’re finding this concept very difficult to grasp. You get plenty of practice
using these concepts throughout this book.
Before I get into all the technical mumbo jumbo of double-entry bookkeeping,
here’s an example of the practice in action. Suppose you purchase a new
desk that costs $1,500 for your office. This transaction actually has two parts:
You spend an asset — cash — to buy another asset — furniture. So, you must
adjust two accounts in your company’s books: the Cash account and the
Furniture account. Here’s what the transaction looks like in a bookkeeping
entry (I talk more about how to do initial bookkeeping entries in Chapter 4):
Account
Debit
Credit
Furniture
$1,500
Cash
$1,500
To purchase a new desk for the office.
In this transaction, you record the accounts impacted by the transaction. The
debit increases the value of the Furniture account, and the credit decreases
the value of the Cash account. For this transaction, both accounts impacted
are asset accounts, so, looking at how the balance sheet is affected, you can
see that the only changes are to the asset side of the balance sheet equation:
Assets = Liabilities + Equity
Furniture increase = No change to this side of the equation
Cash decrease
28
Part I: Basic Bookkeeping: Why You Need It 

In this case, the books stay in balance because the exact dollar amount that
increases the value of your Furniture account decreases the value of your
Cash account. At the bottom of any journal entry, you should include a brief
explanation that explains the purpose for the entry. In the first example, I
indicate this entry was “To purchase a new desk for the office.”
To show you how you record a transaction if it impacts both sides of the 
balance sheet equation, here’s an example that shows how to record the 
purchase of inventory. Suppose that you purchase $5,000 worth of widgets
on credit. (Haven’t you always wondered what widgets were? Can’t help you.
They’re just commonly used in accounting examples to represent something
that’s purchased.) These new widgets add value to your Inventory Asset
account and also add value to your Accounts Payable account. (Remember,
the Accounts Payable account is a Liability account where you track bills that
need to be paid at some point in the future.) Here’s how the bookkeeping
transaction for your widget purchase looks:
Account
Debit
Credit
Inventory
$5,000
Accounts Payable
$5,000
To purchase widgets for sale to customers.
Here’s how this transaction affects the balance sheet equation:
Assets = Liabilities + Equity
Inventory increases = Accounts Payable increases + No change
In this case, the books stay in balance because both sides of the equation
increase by $5,000.
You can see from the two example transactions how double-entry bookkeep-
ing helps to keep your books in balance — as long as you make sure each
entry into the books is balanced. Balancing your entries may look simple
here, but sometimes bookkeeping entries can get very complex when more
than two accounts are impacted by the transaction.
Don’t worry, you don’t have to understand it totally now. I show you how to
enter transactions throughout the book depending upon the type of transac-
tion that is being recorded. I’m just giving you a quick overview to introduce
the subject right now.

Differentiating Debits and Credits
Because bookkeeping’s debits and credits are different from the ones you’re
used to encountering, you’re probably wondering how you’re supposed to
know whether a debit or credit will increase or decrease an account. Believe
it or not, identifying the difference becomes second nature as you start
making regular entries in your bookkeeping system. But to make things easier
for you, Table 2-1 is a chart that’s commonly used by all bookkeepers and
accountants. Yep, everyone needs help sometimes.

Double-entry bookkeeping goes way back
No one’s really sure who invented double-entry
bookkeeping. The first person to put the prac-
tice on paper was Benedetto Cotrugli in 1458,
but mathematician and Franciscan monk Luca
Pacioli is most often credited with developing
double-entry bookkeeping. Although Pacioli’s
called the “father of accounting,” accounting
actually occupies only one of five sections of his
book, Everything About Arithmetic, Geometry
and Proportions, which was published in 1494.
Pacioli didn’t actually invent double-entry 
bookkeeping; he just described the method
used by merchants in Venice during the Italian
Renaissance period. He’s most famous for his
warning to bookkeepers: “A person should not
go to sleep at night until the debits equaled the
credits!”

C
an you imagine the mess your checkbook would be if you didn’t record
each check you wrote? Like me, you’ve probably forgotten to record a
check or two on occasion, but you certainly learn your lesson when you real-
ize that an important payment bounces as a result. Yikes!
Keeping the books of a business can be a lot more difficult than maintaining a
personal checkbook. Each business transaction must be carefully recorded to
make sure that it goes into the right account. This careful bookkeeping gives
you an effective tool for figuring out how well the business is doing financially.
As a bookkeeper, you need a roadmap to help you determine where to record
all those transactions. This roadmap is called the Chart of Accounts. In this
chapter, I tell you how to set up the Chart of Accounts, which includes many
different accounts. I also review the types of transactions you enter into each
type of account in order to track the key parts of any business — assets, 
liabilities, equity, revenue, and expenses.
Getting to Know the Chart of Accounts
The Chart of Accounts is the roadmap that a business creates to organize its
financial transactions. After all, you can’t record a transaction until you know
where to put it! Essentially, this chart is a list of all the accounts a business

has, organized in a specific order; each account has a description that includes
the type of account and the types of transactions that should be entered into
that account. Every business creates its own Chart of Accounts based on
how the business is operated, so you’re unlikely to find two businesses with
the exact same Charts of Accounts.
However, some basic organizational and structural characteristics are common
to all Charts of Accounts. The organization and structure are designed around
two key financial reports: the balance sheet, which shows what your business
owns and what it owes, and the income statement, which shows how much
money your business took in from sales and how much money it spent to gen-
erate those sales. (You can find out more about balance sheets in Chapter 18
and income statements in Chapter 19.)
The Chart of Accounts starts first with the balance sheet accounts, which
include
 Current Assets: Includes all accounts that track things the company
owns and expects to use in the next 12 months, such as cash, accounts
receivable (money collected from customers), and inventory
 Long-term Assets: Includes all accounts that tracks things the company
owns that have a lifespan of more than 12 months, such as buildings, fur-
niture, and equipment
 Current Liabilities: Includes all accounts that tracks debts the company
must pay over the next 12 months, such as accounts payable (bills from
vendors, contractors and consultants), interest payable, and credit
cards payable
 Long-term Liabilities: Includes all accounts that tracks debts the com-
pany must pay over a period of time longer than the next 12 months,
such as mortgages payable and bonds payable
 Equity: Includes all accounts that tracks the owners of the company and
their claims against the company’s assets, which includes any money
invested in the company, any money taken out of the company, and any
earnings that have been reinvested in the company
The rest of the chart is filled with income statement accounts, which include
 Revenue: Includes all accounts that track sales of goods and services as
well as revenue generated for the company by other means
 Cost of Goods Sold: Includes all accounts that track the direct costs
involved in selling the company’s goods or services
 Expenses: Includes all accounts that track expenses related to running
the businesses that aren’t directly tied to the sale of individual products
or services
32
Part I: Basic Bookkeeping: Why You Need It 

When developing the Chart of Accounts, you start by listing all the Asset
accounts, the Liability accounts, the Equity accounts, the Revenue accounts,
and finally, the Expense accounts. All these accounts come from two places:
the balance sheet and the income statement.
In this chapter, I review the key account types found in most businesses, but
this list isn’t cast in stone. You should develop an account list that makes the
most sense for how you’re operating your business and the financial informa-
tion you want to track. As I explore the various accounts that make up the
Chart of Accounts, I point out how the structure may differ for different types
of businesses.
The Chart of Accounts is a money management tool that helps you track your
business transactions, so set it up in a way that provides you with the finan-
cial information you need to make smart business decisions. You’ll probably
tweak the accounts in your chart annually and, if necessary, you may add
accounts during the year if you find something for which you want more
detailed tracking. You can add accounts during the year, but it’s best not to
delete accounts until the end of a 12-month reporting period. I discuss adding
and deleting accounts from your books in Chapter 17.
Starting with the Balance Sheet
Accounts
The first part of the Chart of Accounts is made up of balance sheet accounts,
which break down into the following three categories:
 Asset: These accounts are used to track what the business owns. Assets
include cash on hand, furniture, buildings, vehicles, and so on.
 Liability: These accounts track what the business owes, or, more specifi-
cally, claims that lenders have against the business’s assets. For example,
mortgages on buildings and lines of credit are two common types of 
liabilities.
 Equity: These accounts track what the owners put into the business and
the claims the owners have against the business’s assets. For example,
stockholders are company owners that have claims against the busi-
ness’s assets.
The balance sheet accounts, and the financial report they make up, are so-
called because they have to balance out. The value of the assets must be
equal to the claims made against those assets. (Remember, these claims are
liabilities made by lenders and equity made by owners.)
33
Chapter 3: Outlining Your Financial Roadmap with a Chart of Accounts

I discuss the balance sheet in greater detail in Chapter 18, including how it’s
prepared and used. This section, however, examines the basic components of
the balance sheet, as reflected in the Chart of Accounts.
Tackling assets
First on the chart is always the accounts that track what the company 
owns — its assets. The two types of asset accounts are current assets and
long-term assets.
Current assets
Current assets are the key assets that your business uses up during a 12-
month period and will likely not be there the next year. The accounts that
reflect current assets on the Chart of Accounts are:
 Cash in Checking: Any company’s primary account is the checking
account used for operating activities. This is the account used to
deposit revenues and pay expenses. Some companies have more than
one operating account in this category; for example, a company with
many divisions may have an operating account for each division.
 Cash in Savings: This account is used for surplus cash. Any cash for
which there is no immediate plan is deposited in an interest-earning sav-
ings account so that it can at least earn interest while the company
decides what to do with it.
 Cash on Hand: This account is used to track any cash kept at retail
stores or in the office. In retail stores, cash must be kept in registers in
order to provide change to customers. In the office, petty cash is often
kept around for immediate cash needs that pop up from time to time.
This account helps you keep track of the cash held outside a financial
institution.
 Accounts Receivable: If you offer your products or services to cus-
tomers on store credit (meaning your store credit system), then you
need this account to track the customers who buy on your dime.
Accounts Receivable isn’t used to track purchases made on other types
of credit cards because your business gets paid directly by banks, not
customers, when other credit cards are used. Head to Chapter 9 to read
more about this scenario and the corresponding type of account.
 Inventory: This account tracks the products you have on hand to sell to
your customers. The value of the assets in this account varies depend-
ing upon the way you decide to track the flow of inventory into and out
of the business. I discuss inventory valuation and tracking in greater
detail in Chapter 8.
34
Part I: Basic Bookkeeping: Why You Need It 

 Prepaid Insurance: This account tracks insurance you pay in advance
that’s credited as it’s used up each month. For example, if you own a
building and prepay one year in advance, each month you reduce the
amount that you prepaid by 1⁄12 as the prepayment is used up.
Depending upon the type of business you’re setting up, you may have other
current asset accounts that you decide to track. For example, if you’re start-
ing a service business in consulting, you’re likely to have a Consulting
account for tracking cash collected for those services. If you run a business
in which you barter assets (such as trading your services for paper goods
from a paper goods company), you may add a Barter account for business-to-
business barter.
Long-term assets
Long-term assets are assets that you anticipate your business will use for
more than 12 months. This section lists some of the most common long-term
assets, starting with the key accounts related to buildings and factories
owned by the company:
 Land: This account tracks the land owned by the company. The value of
the land is based on the cost of purchasing it. Land value is tracked sep-
arately from the value of any buildings standing on that land because
land isn’t depreciated in value, but buildings must be depreciated.
Depreciation is an accounting method that shows an asset is being used
up. I talk more about depreciation in Chapter 12.
 Buildings: This account tracks the value of any buildings a business
owns. As with land, the value of the building is based on the cost of pur-
chasing it. The key difference between buildings and land is that the
building’s value is depreciated, as discussed in the previous bullet.
 Accumulated Depreciation – Buildings: This account tracks the cumula-
tive amount a building is depreciated over its useful lifespan. I talk more
about how to calculate depreciation in Chapter 12.
 Leasehold Improvements: This account tracks the value of improve-
ments to buildings or other facilities that a business leases rather than
purchases. Frequently when a business leases a property, it must pay for
any improvements necessary in order to use that property the way its
needed. For example, if a business leases a store in a strip mall, it’s likely
that the space leased is an empty shell or filled with shelving and other
items that may not match the particular needs of the business. As with
buildings, leasehold improvements are depreciated as the value of the
asset ages.
 Accumulated Depreciation – Leasehold Improvements: This account
tracks the cumulative amount depreciated for leasehold improvements.
35
Chapter 3: Outlining Your Financial Roadmap with a Chart of Accounts

The following are the types of accounts for smaller long-term assets, such as
vehicles and furniture:
 Vehicles: This account tracks any cars, trucks, or other vehicles owned
by the business. The initial value of any vehicle is listed in this account
based on the total cost paid to put the vehicle in service. Sometimes this
value is more than the purchase price if additions were needed to make
the vehicle usable for the particular type of business. For example, if a
business provides transportation for the handicapped and must add
additional equipment to a vehicle in order to serve the needs of its cus-
tomers, that additional equipment is added to the value of the vehicle.
Vehicles also depreciate through their useful lifespan.
 Accumulated Depreciation – Vehicles: This account tracks the depreci-
ation of all vehicles owned by the company.
 Furniture and Fixtures: This account tracks any furniture or fixtures
purchased for use in the business. The account includes the value of all
chairs, desks, store fixtures, and shelving needed to operate the busi-
ness. The value of the furniture and fixtures in this account is based on
the cost of purchasing these items. These items are depreciated during
their useful lifespan.
 Accumulated Depreciation – Furniture and Fixtures: This account
tracks the accumulated depreciation of all furniture and fixtures.
 Equipment: This account tracks equipment that was purchased for use
for more than one year, such as computers, copiers, tools, and cash reg-
isters. The value of the equipment is based on the cost to purchase
these items. Equipment is also depreciated to show that over time it
gets used up and must be replaced.
 Accumulated Depreciation – Equipment: This account tracks the accu-
mulated depreciation of all the equipment.
The following accounts track the long-term assets that you can’t touch but
that still represent things of value owned by the company, such as organiza-
tion costs, patents, and copyrights. These are called intangible assets, and the
accounts that track them include
 Organization Costs: This account tracks initial start-up expenses to get
the business off the ground. Many such expenses can’t be written off
in the first year. For example, special licenses and legal fees must be
written off over a number of years using a method similar to deprecia-
tion, called amortization, which is also tracked. I discuss amortization in
greater detail in Chapter 12.
 Amortization – Organization Costs: This account tracks the accumu-
lated amortization of organization costs during the period in which
they’re being written-off.
36
Part I: Basic Bookkeeping: Why You Need It 

 Patents: This account tracks the costs associated with patents, grants
made by governments that guarantee to the inventor of a product or ser-
vice the exclusive right to make, use, and sell that product or service
over a set period of time. Like organization costs, patent costs are amor-
tized. The value of this asset is based on the expenses the company
incurs to get the right to patent the product.
 Amortization – Patents: This account tracks the accumulated amortiza-
tion of a business’s patents.
 Copyrights: This account tracks the costs incurred to establish copy-
rights, the legal rights given to an author, playwright, publisher, or any
other distributor of a publication or production for a unique work of lit-
erature, music, drama, or art. This legal right expires after a set number
of years, so its value is amortized as the copyright gets used up.
 Goodwill: This account is only needed if a company buys another com-
pany for more than the actual value of its tangible assets. Goodwill
reflects the intangible value of this purchase for things like company
reputation, store locations, customer base and other items that increase
the value of the business bought.
If you hold a lot of assets that aren’t of great value, you can also set up an
“Other Assets” account to track those assets that don’t have significant busi-
ness value. Any asset you track in the Other Assets account that you later
want to track individually can be shifted to its own account. I discuss adjust-
ing the Chart of Accounts in Chapter 18.
Laying out your liabilities
After you cover assets, the next stop on the bookkeeping highway is the
accounts that track what your business owes to others. These “others” can
include vendors from which you buy products or supplies, financial institu-
tions from which you borrow money, and anyone else who lends money to
your business. Like assets, liabilities are lumped into two types: current lia-
bilities and long-term liabilities.
Current liabilities
Current liabilities are debts due in the next 12 months. Some of the most
common types of current liabilities accounts that appear on the Chart of
Accounts are
 Accounts Payable: This account tracks money the company owes to
vendors, contractors, suppliers, and consultants that must be paid in
less than a year. Most of these liabilities must be paid in 30 to 90 days
from initial billing.
37
Chapter 3: Outlining Your Financial Roadmap with a Chart of Accounts

 Sales Tax Collected: You may not think of sales tax as a liability, but
because the business collects the tax from the customer and doesn’t
pay it immediately to the government entity, the taxes collected become
a liability tracked in this account. A business usually collects sales tax
throughout the month and then pays it to the local, state, or federal gov-
ernment on a monthly basis. I discuss paying sales taxes in greater detail
in Chapter 20.
 Accrued Payroll Taxes: This account tracks payroll taxes collected from
employees to pay state, local, or federal income taxes as well as Social
Security and Medicare taxes. Companies don’t have to pay these taxes
to the government entities immediately, so depending on the size of the
payroll, companies may pay payroll taxes on a monthly or quarterly
basis. I discuss how to handle payroll taxes in Chapter 10.
 Credit Cards Payable: This account tracks all credit card accounts to
which the business is liable. Most companies use credit cards as short-
term debt and pay them off completely at the end of each month, but
some smaller companies carry credit card balances over a longer period
of time. Because credit cards often have a much higher interest rate than
most lines of credits, most companies transfer any credit card debt they
can’t pay entirely at the end of a month to a line of credit at a bank.
When it comes to your Chart of Accounts, you can set up one Credit
Card Payable account, but you may want to set up a separate account
for each card your company holds to improve your ability to track credit
card usage.
How you set up your current liabilities and how many individual accounts
you establish depend upon how detailed you want to track each type of liabil-
ity. For example, you can set up separate current liability accounts for major
vendors if you find that approach provides you with a better money manage-
ment tool. For example, suppose that a small hardware retail store buys 
most of the tools it sells from Snap-on. To keep better control of its spending
with Snap-on, the bookkeeper sets up a specific account called Accounts
Payable – Snap-on, which is used only for tracking invoices and payments to
that vendor. In this example, all other invoices and payments to other ven-
dors and suppliers are tracked in the general Accounts Payable account.
Long-term liabilities
Long-term liabilities are debts due in more than 12 months. The number of
long-term liability accounts you maintain on your Chart of Accounts depends
on your debt structure. The two most common types of long-term liability
accounts are:
 Loans Payable: This account tracks any long-term loans, such as a mort-
gage on your business building. Most businesses have separate loans
payable accounts for each of their long-term loans. For example, you
could have Loans Payable – Mortgage Bank for your building and Loans
Payable – Car Bank for your vehicle loan.
38
Part I: Basic Bookkeeping: Why You Need It 

 Notes Payable: Some businesses borrow money from other businesses
using notes, a method of borrowing that doesn’t require the company to
put up an asset, such as a mortgage on a building or a car loan, as collat-
eral. This account tracks any notes due.
In addition to any separate long-term debt you may want to track in its own
account, you may also want to set up an account called “Other Liabilities”
that you can use to track types of debt that are so insignificant to the busi-
ness that you don’t think they need their own accounts.
Eyeing the equity
Every business is owned by somebody. Equity accounts track owners’ contribu-
tions to the business as well as their share of ownership. For a corporation,
ownership is tracked by the sale of individual shares of stock because each
stockholder owns a portion of the business. In smaller companies that are
owned by one person or a group of people, equity is tracked using Capital
and Drawing Accounts. Here are the basic equity accounts that appear in the
Chart of Accounts:
 Common Stock: This account reflects the value of outstanding shares of
stock sold to investors. A company calculates this value by multiplying
the number of shares issued by the value of each share of stock. Only
corporations need to establish this account.
 Retained Earnings: This account tracks the profits or losses accumu-
lated since a business was opened. At the end of each year, the profit or
loss calculated on the income statement is used to adjust the value of
this account. For example, if a company made a $100,000 profit in the
past year, the Retained Earnings account would be increased by that
amount; if the company lost $100,000, then that amount would be sub-
tracted from this account.
 Capital: This account is only necessary for small, unincorporated busi-
nesses. The Capital account reflects the amount of initial money the
business owner contributed to the company as well as owner contribu-
tions made after initial start-up. The value of this account is based on
cash contributions and other assets contributed by the business owner,
such as equipment, vehicles, or buildings. If a small company has sev-
eral different partners, then each partner gets his or her own Capital
account to track his or her contributions.
 Drawing: This account is only necessary for businesses that aren’t
incorporated. The Drawing account tracks any money that a business
owner takes out of the business. If the business has several partners,
each partner gets his or her own Drawing account to track what he or
she takes out of the business.
39
Chapter 3: Outlining Your Financial Roadmap with a Chart of Accounts

Tracking the Income Statement Accounts
The income statement is made up of two types of accounts:
 Revenue: These accounts track all money coming into the business,
including sales, interest earned on savings, and any other methods used
to generate income.
 Expenses: These accounts track all money that a business spends in
order to keep itself afloat.
The bottom line of the income statement shows whether your business made
a profit or a loss for a specified period of time. I discuss how to prepare and
use an income statement in greater detail in Chapter 19.
This section examines the various accounts that make up the income state-
ment portion of the Chart of Accounts.
Recording the money you make
First up in the income statement portion of the Chart of Accounts are
accounts that track revenue coming into the business. If you choose to offer
discounts or accept returns, that activity also falls within the revenue group-
ing. The most common income accounts are
 Sales of Goods or Services: This account, which appears at the top of
every income statement, tracks all the money that the company earns
selling its products, services, or both.
 Sales Discounts: Because most businesses offer discounts to encourage
sales, this account tracks any reductions to the full price of merchandise.
 Sales Returns: This account tracks transactions related to returns, when
a customer returns a product because he or she is unhappy with it for
some reason.
When you examine an income statement from a company other than the one
you own or are working for, you usually see the following accounts summa-
rized as one line item called Revenue or Net Revenue. Because not all income
is generated by sales of products or services, other income accounts that
may appear on a Chart of Accounts include
 Other Income: If a company takes in income from a source other then its
primary business activity, that income is recorded in this account. For
example, a company that encourages recycling and earns income from
the items recycled records that income in this account.
40
Part I: Basic Bookkeeping: Why You Need It 

 Interest Income: This account tracks any income earned by collecting
interest on a company’s savings accounts. If the company loans money
to employees or to another company and earns interest on that money,
that interest is recorded in this account as well.
 Sale of Fixed Assets: Any time a company sells a fixed asset, such as a
car or furniture, any revenue made from the sale is recorded in this
account. A company should only record revenue remaining after sub-
tracting the accumulated depreciation from the original cost of the
asset.
Tracking the Cost of Sales
Of course, before you can sell a product, you must spend some money to
either buy or make that product. The type of account used to track the
money spent is called a Cost of Goods Sold account. The most common
Cost of Goods Sold accounts are:
 Purchases: This account tracks the purchases of all items you plan
to sell.
 Purchase Discount: This account tracks the discounts you may receive
from vendors if you pay for your purchase quickly. For example, a com-
pany may give you a 2 percent discount on your purchase if you pay 
the bill in 10 days rather than wait until the end of the 30-day payment
allotment.
 Purchase Returns: If you’re unhappy with a product you’ve bought,
record the value of any returns in this account.
 Freight Charges: Any charges related to shipping items you purchase
for later sale are tracked in this account. You may or may not want to
keep track of this detail.
 Other Sales Costs: This is a catchall account for anything that doesn’t fit
into one of the other Cost of Goods Sold accounts.
Acknowledging the money you spend
Expense accounts take the cake for the longest list of individual accounts.
Any money you spend on the business that can’t be tied directly to the sale
of an individual product falls under the expense account category. For example,
advertising a storewide sale isn’t directly tied to the sale of any one product,
so the costs associated with advertising fall under the expense account 
category.
41
Chapter 3: Outlining Your Financial Roadmap with a Chart of Accounts

The Chart of Accounts mirrors your business operations, so it’s up to you to
decide how much detail you want to keep in your expense accounts. Most
businesses have expenses that are unique to their operations, so your list
will probably be longer than the one I present here. However, you also may
find that you don’t need some of these accounts.
On your Chart of Accounts, the expense accounts don’t have to appear in any
specific order, so I list them here alphabetically. The most common expense
accounts are
 Advertising: This account tracks all expenses involved in promoting a
business or its products. Money spent on newspaper, television, maga-
zine, and radio advertising is recorded here as well as any money spent
to print flyers and mailings to customers. Also, when a company partici-
pates in community events such as cancer walks or craft fairs, associated
costs are tracked in this account as well.
 Bank Service Charges: This account tracks any charges made by a bank
to service a company’s bank accounts.
 Dues and Subscriptions: This account tracks expenses related to busi-
ness club membership or subscriptions to magazines for the business.
 Equipment Rental: This account tracks expenses related to renting
equipment for a short-term project. For example, a business that needs
to rent a truck to pick up some new fixtures for its store records that
truck rental in this account.
 Insurance: This account tracks any money paid to buy insurance. Many
businesses break this down into several accounts, such as Insurance –
Employees Group, which tracks any expenses paid for employee 
insurance, or Insurance – Officers’ Life, which tracks money spent to
buy insurance to protect the life of a key owner or officer of the com-
pany. Companies often insure their key owners and executives because
an unexpected death, especially for a small company, may mean facing
many unexpected expenses in order to keep the company’s doors open.
In such a case, the insurance proceeds can be used to cover those
expenses.
 Legal and Accounting: This account tracks any money that’s paid for
legal or accounting advice.
 Miscellaneous Expenses: This is a catchall account for expenses that
don’t fit into one of a company’s established accounts. If certain miscel-
laneous expenses occur frequently, a company may choose to add 
an account to the Chart of Accounts and move related expenses into
that new account by subtracting all related transactions from the
Miscellaneous Expenses account and adding them to the new account.
With this shuffle, it’s important to carefully balance out the adjusting
transaction to avoid any errors or double counting.
42
Part I: Basic Bookkeeping: Why You Need It 

 Office Expense: This account tracks any items purchased in order to
run an office. For example, office supplies such as paper and pens or
business cards fit in this account. As with miscellaneous expenses, a
company may choose to track some office expense items in their own
accounts. For example, if you find your office is using a lot of copy paper
and you want to track that separately, you set up a Copy Paper expense
account. Just be sure you really need the detail because the number of
accounts can get unwieldy and hard to manage.
 Payroll Taxes: This account tracks any taxes paid related to employee
payroll, such as the employer’s share of Social Security and Medicare,
unemployment compensation, and workman’s compensation.
 Postage: This account tracks any money spent on stamps, express pack-
age shipping, and other shipping. If a company does a large amount of
shipping through vendors such as UPS or Federal Express, it may want
to track that spending in separate accounts for each vendor. This option
is particularly helpful for small companies that sell over the Internet or
through catalog sales.
 Rent Expense: This account tracks rental costs for a business’s office or
retail space.
 Salaries and Wages: This account tracks any money paid to employees
as salary or wages.
 Supplies: This account tracks any business supplies that don’t fit into
the category of office supplies. For example, supplies needed for the
operation of retail stores are tracked using this account.
 Travel and Entertainment: This account tracks money spent for business
purposes on travel or entertainment. Some business separate these
expenses into several accounts, such as Travel and Entertainment –
Meals, Travel and Entertainment – Travel, and Travel and Entertainment –
Entertainment, to keep a close watch.
 Telephone: This account tracks all business expenses related to the tele-
phone and telephone calls.
 Utilities: This account tracks money paid for utilities, such as electricity,
gas, and water.
 Vehicles: This account tracks expenses related to the operation of com-
pany vehicles.
Setting Up Your Chart of Accounts
You can use the lists upon lists of accounts provided in this chapter to get
started setting up your business’s own Chart of Accounts. There’s really no
secret to making your own chart — just make a list of the accounts that apply
to your business.
43
Chapter 3: Outlining Your Financial Roadmap with a Chart of Accounts

When first setting up your Chart of Accounts, don’t panic if you can’t think of
every type of account you may need for your business. It’s very easy to add
to the Chart of Accounts at any time. Just add the account to the list and dis-
tribute the revised list to any employees that use the Chart of Accounts for
recording transactions into the bookkeeping system. (Even employees not
involved in bookkeeping need a copy of your Chart of Accounts if they code
invoices or other transactions and indicate to which account those transac-
tions should be recorded.)
The Chart of Accounts usually includes at least three columns:
 Account: Lists the account names
 Type: Lists the type of account — asset, liability, equity, income, cost of
goods sold, or expense
 Description: Contains a description of the type of transaction that
should be recorded in the account
Many companies also assign numbers to the accounts, to be used for coding
charges. If your company is using a computerized system, the computer auto-
matically assigns the account number. Otherwise, you need to plan out your
own numbering system. The most common number system is:
 Asset accounts: 1,000 to 1,999
 Liability accounts: 2,000 to 2,999
 Equity accounts: 3,000 to 3,999
 Sales and Cost of Goods Sold accounts: 4,000 to 4,999
 Expense accounts: 5,000 to 6,999
This numbering system matches the one used by computerized accounting
systems, making it easy for a company to transition if at some future time it
decides to automate its books using a computerized accounting system.
One major advantage of using a computerized accounting system is that a
number of different Charts of Accounts have been developed based on the
type of business one plans to run. When you get your computerized system,
whichever accounting software you decide to use, all you need to do is
review the list of chart options for the type of business you run included with
that software, delete any accounts you don’t want, and add any new accounts
that fit your business plan.
If you’re setting up your Chart of Accounts manually, be sure to leave a lot
of room between accounts to add new accounts. For example, number your
Cash in Checking account 1,000 and your Accounts Receivable account 1,100.
That leaves you plenty of room to add other accounts to track cash.

Figure 3-1 is a sample Chart of Accounts that I developed using QuickBooks.
In the sample chart, you can see a few accounts that are unique to the busi-
ness in Figure 3-1, such as Cooking Supplies, and other accounts that are
common only to retail business, such as Cash Discrepancies and Merchant
Fees.

In this part . . . 
B
elieve or not, there’s a science to correctly entering
your financial transactions in the books. This part
introduces you to the basics of entering financial transac-
tions, posting transactions to your General Ledger (the
granddaddy of your bookkeeping system), and tracking
all the transaction details in your journals.
Good internal controls are a must-have for any bookkeep-
ing system, so I tell you how to set them in place to be
sure all your financial transactions not only are entered
into the books but also are entered correctly. In addition,
you want to be sure that cash coming in and going out of
the company is properly handled, so I provide recommen-
dations of how to separate various money-related duties.
Finally, I introduce you to your options when it comes to
computerized accounting systems and share the benefits
of using these types of systems to keep your company’s
books.

of Your Business Transactions
In This Chapter
 Understanding the value of the General Ledger

 Creating ledgers in computerized accounting software
A
s a bookkeeper, you may be dreaming of having one source that you can
turn to when you need to review all entries that impact your business’s
accounts. (Okay, so maybe that’s not exactly what you’re dreaming about.
Just work with me here.) The General Ledger is your dream come true. It’s
where you find a summary of transactions and a record of the accounts that
those transactions impact.
In this chapter, you discover the purpose of the General Ledger. I tell you how
to not only develop entries for the Ledger but also enter (or post) them. In
addition, I explain how you can change already posted information or correct
entries in the Ledger and how this entire process is streamlined when you
use a computerized accounting system.
The Eyes and Ears of a Business
I’m not using eyes and ears literally here because, of course, the book known
as the General Ledger isn’t alive, so it can’t see or speak. But wouldn’t it be
nice if the ledger could just tell you all its secrets about what happens with
your money? That would certainly make it a lot easier to track down any
bookkeeping problems or errors.

Instead, the General Ledger serves as the figurative eyes and ears of book-
keepers and accountants who want to know what financial transactions have
taken place historically in a business. By reading the General Ledger — not
exactly interesting reading unless you love numbers — you can see, account
by account, every transaction that has taken place in the business. (And to
uncover more details about those transactions, you can turn to your busi-
ness’s journals, where transactions are kept on a daily basis. See Chapter 5
for the lowdown on journals.)
The General Ledger is the granddaddy of your business. You can find all the
transactions that ever occurred in the history of the business in the General
Ledger account. It’s the one place you need to go to find transactions that
impact Cash, Inventory, Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable, and any
other account included in your business’s Chart of Accounts. (See Chapter 3
for more information about setting up the Chart of Accounts and the kind of
transactions you can find in each.)
Developing Entries for the Ledger
Because your business’s transactions are first entered into journals, you
develop many of the entries for the General Ledger based on information
pulled from the appropriate journal. For example, cash receipts and the
accounts that are impacted by those receipts are listed in the Cash Receipts
journal. Cash disbursements and the accounts impacted by those disburse-
ments are listed in the Cash Disbursements journal. The same is true for
transactions found in the Sales journal, Purchases journal, General journal,
and any other special journals you may be using in your business.
At the end of each month, you summarize each journal by adding up the
columns and then use that summary to develop an entry for the General
Ledger. Believe me, that takes a lot less time than entering every transaction
in the General Ledger. (I introduce you to the process of entering transac-
tions and summarizing journals in Chapter 5.)
I introduce you to the process of entering transactions and summarizing jour-
nals in Chapter 5. Near the end of that chapter, I even summarize one journal
and develop this entry for the General Ledger:
Account
Debit
Credit
Cash
$2,900
Accounts Receivable
$500
Sales
$900
Capital
$1,500
50
Part II: Keeping a Paper Trail 

Note that the Debits and Credits are in balance — $2,900 each. Remember all
entries to the General Ledger must be balanced entries. That’s the cardinal
rule of double-entry bookkeeping. For more detail about double-entry book-
keeping, read Chapter 2.
In this entry, the Cash account is increased by $2,900 to show that cash was
received. The Accounts Receivable account is decreased by $500 to show
customers paid their bills, and the money is no longer due. The Sales account
is increased by $900, because additional revenue was collected. The Capital
account is increased by $1,500 because the owner put more cash into the
business.
Figures 4-1 to 4- 4 summarize the remaining journal pages that I prepared in
Chapter 5. Reviewing those summaries, I developed the following entries for
the General Ledger:
Figure 4-1 – Summarized Cash Disbursements Journal
Figure 4-2 – Summarized Sales Journal
Figure 4-3 – Summarized Purchases Journal
Figure 4-4 – Summarized General Journal
Figure 4-1 shows a summary of the Cash Disbursements journal for a 
business.
The following General Ledger entry is based on the transactions that appear
in Figure 4-1:
Account
Debit
Credit
Rent
$800
Accounts Payable
$750
Salaries
$350
Credit Card Payable
$150
Cash
$2,050
This General Ledger summary balances out at $2,050 each for the debits and
credits. The Cash account is decreased to show the cash outlay, the Rent and
Salaries expense accounts are increased to show the additional expenses,
and the Accounts Payable and Credit Card Payable accounts are decreased to
show that bills were paid and are no longer due.
Figure 4-2 shows the Sales journal for a sample business.

Note that this entry is balanced. The Accounts Receivable account is
increased to show that customers owe the business money because they
bought items on store credit. The Sales account is increased to show that
even though no cash changed hands, the business in Figure 4-2 took in rev-
enue. Cash will be collected when the customers pay their bills.
Figure 4-3 shows the business’s Purchases journal for one month. The following
General Ledger entry is based on the transactions that appear in Figure 4-3:

Like the entry for the Sales account, this entry is balanced. The Accounts
Payable account is increased to show that money is due to vendors, and the
Purchases expense account is also increased to show that more supplies
were purchased.
Figure 4-4 shows the General journal for a sample business.

In this entry, the Sales Return and Purchase Return accounts are increased to
show additional returns. The Accounts Payable and Accounts Receivable
accounts are both decreased to show that money is no longer owed. The
Vehicles account is increased to show new company assets, and the Capital
account, which is where the owner’s deposits into the business are tracked,
is increased accordingly.

Part II: Keeping a Paper Trail 

Posting Entries to the Ledger
After you summarize your journals and develop all the entries you need for
the General Ledger (see the previous section), you post your entries into the
General Ledger accounts.
When posting to the General Ledger, include transaction dollar amounts as
well as references to where material was originally entered into the books so
you can track a transaction back if a question arises later. For example, you
may wonder what a number means, your boss or the owner may wonder why
certain money was spent, or an auditor (an outside accountant who checks
your work for accuracy) could raise a question.
Whatever the reason someone is questioning an entry in the General Ledger,
you definitely want to be able to find the point of original entry for every
transaction in every account. Use the reference information that guides you
to where the original detail about the transaction is located in the journals to
answer any question that arises.
For this particular business, three of the accounts — Cash, Accounts
Receivable, and Accounts Payable — are carried over month to month, so
each has an opening balance. Just to keep things simple, in this example
I start each account with a $2,000 balance. One of the accounts, Sales, is
closed at the end of each accounting period, so it starts with a zero balance.
Most businesses close their books at the end of each month and do financial
reports. Others close them at the end of a quarter or end of a year. (I talk more
about which accounts are closed at the end of each accounting period and
which accounts remain open, as well as why that is the case, in Chapter 22.)
For the purposes of this example, I assume that this business closes its books
monthly. And in the figures that follow, I only give examples for the first five
days of the month to keep things simple.
As you review the figures for the various accounts in this example, take
notice that the balance of some accounts increase when a debit is recorded
and decrease when a credit is recorded. Others increase when a credit is
recorded and decrease when a debit is recorded. That’s the mystery of
debits, credits, and double-entry accounting. For more, flip to Chapter 2.
The Cash account (see Figure 4-5) increases with debits and decreases with
credits. Ideally, the Cash account always ends with a debit balance, which
means there’s still money in the account. A credit balance in the cash
account indicates that the business is overdrawn, and you know what that
means — checks are returned for nonpayment.
57

Figure 4-5:

58
Part II: Keeping a Paper Trail 

The Accounts Receivable account (see Figure 4-6) increases with debits and
decreases with credits. Ideally, this account also has a debit balance that
indicates the amount still due from customer purchases. If no money is due
from customers, the account balance is zero. A zero balance isn’t necessarily
a bad thing if all customers have paid their bills. However, a zero balance may
be a sign that your sales have slumped, which could be bad news.

59
Chapter 4: Ledgers: A One-Stop Summary of Your Business Transactions

The Accounts Payable account (see Figure 4-7) increases with credits and
decreases with debits. Ideally, this account has a credit balance because
money is still due to vendors, contractors, and others. A zero balance here
equals no outstanding bills.
Figure 4-7:

60
Part II: Keeping a Paper Trail 

These three accounts — Cash, Accounts Receivable, and Accounts Payable —
are part of the balance sheet, which I explain fully in Chapter 18. Asset
accounts on the balance sheet usually carry debit balances because they
reflect assets (in this case, cash) owned by the business. Cash and Accounts
Receivable are asset accounts. Liability and Equity accounts usually carry
credit balances because Liability accounts show claims made by creditors 
(in other words, money owed by the company to financial institutions, ven-
dors, or others), and Equity accounts show claims made by owners (in other
words, how much money the owners have put into the business). Accounts
Payable is a liability account.
Here’s how these accounts impact the balance of the company:
Assets
=
Liabilities 
+ 
Equity
Cash 
Accounts 
Accounts 
Payable
Receivable
(Usually debit 
(Usually credit 
(Usually debit

balance)
Here’s how these accounts impact the balance of the company:
The Sales account (see Figure 4-8) isn’t a balance sheet account. Instead, it’s
used in developing the income statement, which shows whether or not a
company made money in the period being examined. (For the lowdown on
income statements, see Chapter 19.) Credits and debits are pretty straightfor-
ward when it comes to the Sales account: Credits increase the account, and
debits decrease it. The Sales account usually carries a credit balance, which
is a good thing because it means the company had income.
What’s that, you say? The Sales account should carry a credit balance? That
may sound strange, so let me explain the relationship between the Sales
account and the balance sheet. The Sales account is one of the accounts that
feed the bottom line of the income statement, which shows whether your
business made a profit or suffered a loss. A profit means that you earned
more through sales than you paid out in costs or expenses. Expense and cost
accounts usually carry a debit balance.
The income statement’s bottom line figure shows whether or not the com-
pany made a profit. If Sales account credits exceed expense and cost account
debits, then the company made a profit. That profit would be in the form of a
credit, which then gets added to the Equity account called Retained Earnings,
which tracks how much of your company’s profits were reinvested into the
company to grow the business. If the company lost money and the bottom
line of the income statement showed that cost and expenses exceeded sales,
then the number would be a debit. That debit would be subtracted from the
balance in Retained Earnings, to show the reduction to profits reinvested in
the company.
61
Chapter 4: Ledgers: A One-Stop Summary of Your Business Transactions

Figure 4-8:

the General
Ledger.
62
Part II: Keeping a Paper Trail 

If your company earns a profit at the end of the accounting period, the
Retained Earnings account increases thanks to a credit from the Sales
account. If you lose money, your Retained Earnings account decreases.
Because the Retained Earnings account is an Equity account and Equity
accounts usually carry credit balances, Retained Earnings usually carries a
credit balance as well.
After you post all the Ledger entries, you need to record details about where
you posted the transactions on the journal pages. I show you how to do that
in Chapter 5.
Adjusting for Ledger Errors
Your entries in the General Ledger aren’t cast in stone. If necessary, you can
always change or correct an entry with what’s called an adjusting entry. Four
of the most common reasons for General Ledger adjustments are:
 Depreciation: A business shows the aging of its assets through deprecia-
tion. Each year, a portion of the original cost of an asset is written off as
an expense, and that change is noted as an adjusting entry. Determining
how much should be written off is a complicated process that I explain
in greater detail in Chapter 12.
 Prepaid expenses: Expenses that are paid up front, such as a year’s
worth of insurance, are allocated by the month using an adjusting entry.
This type of adjusting entry is usually done as part of the closing
process at the end of an accounting period. I show you how to develop
entries related to prepaid expenses in Chapter 17.
 Adding an account: Accounts can be added by way of adjusting entries
at any time during the year. If the new account is being created to track
transactions separately that once appeared in another account, you
must move all transactions already in the books to the new account.
You do this transfer with an adjusting entry to reflect the change.
 Deleting an account: Accounts should only be deleted at the end of an
accounting period. I show you the type of entries you need to make in
the General Ledger below.
I talk more about adjusting entries and how you can use them in Chapter 17.

Using Computerized Transactions to Post
and Adjust in the General Ledger
If you keep your books using a computerized accounting system, posting to
the General Ledger is actually done behind the scenes by your accounting
software. You can view your transactions right on the screen. I show you how
using two simple steps in QuickBooks, without ever having to make a General
Ledger entry. Other computerized accounting programs allow you to view
transactions right on the screen too. I’m using QuickBooks for examples
throughout the book, because it is the most popular of the computerized
accounting systems.
1. Click the symbol for Accnt to pull up the Chart of Accounts (see 
Figure 4-9).
2. Click on the account for which you want more detail. In Figure 4-10, I
look into Accounts Payable and see the transactions for March that
were entered when the bills were paid.

Part II: Keeping a Paper Trail 

If you need to make an adjustment to a payment that appears in your com-
puterized system, highlight the transaction, click Edit Transaction in the line
below the account name, and make the necessary changes.
As you navigate the General Ledger created by your computerized bookkeep-
ing system, you can see how easy it would be for someone to make changes
that alter your financial transactions and possibly cause serious harm to
your business. For example, someone could reduce or alter your bills to cus-
tomers or change the amount due to a vendor. Be sure that you can trust
whoever has access to your computerized system and that you have set up
secure password access. Also, establish a series of checks and balances for
managing your business’s cash and accounts. Chapter 7 covers safety and
security measures in greater detail.

In This Chapter
 Starting things off with point of original entry
 Tracking cash, sales, and purchases
 Posting to the appropriate accounts
 Simplifying the journals process with computers
W
hen it comes to doing your books, you must start somewhere. You
could take a shortcut and just list every transaction in the affected
accounts, but after recording hundreds and maybe thousands of transaction
in just one month, imagine what a nightmare you’d face if your books didn’t
balance and you had to find the error. It would be like looking for a needle in
a haystack — a haystack of numbers!
Because you enter every transaction in two places — that is, as a debit in one
account and a credit in another account — in a double-entry bookkeeping
system, you need to have a place where you can easily match those debits
and credits. (For more on the double-entry system, flip to Chapter 2.)
Long ago, bookkeepers developed a system of journals to give businesses a
starting point for each transaction. In this chapter, I introduce you to the
process of journalizing your transactions; I tell you how to set up and use
journals, how to post the transactions to accounts impacted, and how to sim-
plify this entire process by using a computerized bookkeeping program.
Establishing a Transaction’s 
Point of Entry
In most companies that don’t use computerized bookkeeping programs, a
transaction’s original point of entry into the bookkeeping system is through
a system of journals.

Each transaction goes in the appropriate journal in chronological order.
The entry should include information about the date of the transaction, the
accounts to which the transaction was posted, and the source material used
for developing the transaction.
If, at some point in the future, you need to track how a credit or debit ended
up in a particular account, you can find the necessary detail in the journal
where you first posted the transaction. (Before it’s posted to various accounts
in the bookkeeping system, each transaction gets a reference number to help
you backtrack to the original entry point.) For example, suppose a customer
calls you and wants to know why his account has a $500 charge. To find the
answer, you go to the posting in the customer’s account, track the charge back
to its original point of entry in the Sales journal, use that information to locate
the source for the charge, make a copy of the source (most likely a sales
invoice or receipt), and mail the evidence to the customer.
If you’ve filed everything properly, you should have no trouble finding the
original source material and settling any issue that arises regarding any trans-
action. For more on what papers you need to keep and how to file them, see
Chapter 7.
It’s perfectly acceptable to keep one general journal for all your transactions,
but one big journal can be very hard to manage because you’ll like have thou-
sands of entries in that journal by the end of the year. Instead, most businesses
employ a system of journals that includes a Cash Receipts journal for incoming
cash and a Cash Disbursements journal for outgoing cash. Not all transactions
involve cash, however, so the two most common non-cash journals are the
Sales journal and the Purchases journal. I show you how to set up and use
each of these journals in the sections that follow.
When Cash Changes Hands
Businesses deal with cash transactions every day, and as a business owner,
you definitely want to know where every penny is going. The best way to get
a quick daily summary of cash transactions is by reviewing the entries in
your Cash Receipts journal and Cash Disbursements journal.
Keeping track of incoming cash
The Cash Receipts journal is the first place you record cash received by your
business. The majority of cash received each day comes from daily sales;
other possible sources of cash include deposits of capital from the com-
pany’s owner, customer bill payments, new loan proceeds, and interest from
savings accounts.
68
Part II: Keeping a Paper Trail 

Each entry in the Cash Receipts journal must not only indicate how the cash
was received but also designate the account into which the cash will be
deposited. Remember, in double-entry bookkeeping, every transaction is
entered twice — once as a debit and once as a credit. For example, cash
taken in for sales is credited to the Sales account and debited to the Cash
account. In this case, both accounts increase in value. (For more about debits
and credits, flip back to Chapter 2.)
In the Cash Receipts journal, the Cash account is always the debit because
it’s where you initially deposit your money. The credits vary depending upon
the source of the funds. Figure 5-1 shows you what a series of transactions
look like when they’re entered into a Cash Receipts journal.
You record most of your incoming cash daily because it’s cash received by
the cashier, called cash register sales or simply sales in the journal. When you
record checks received from customers, you list the customer’s check number
and name as well as the amount. In Figure 5-1, the only other cash received is
a cash deposit from H.G. to cover a cash shortfall.
The Cash Receipts journal in Figure 5-1 has seven columns of information:
 Date: The date of the transaction.
 Account Credited: The name of the account credited.
 PR (post reference): Where the transaction will be posted at the end of
the month. This information is filled in at the end of the month when you
do the posting to the General Ledger accounts. If the entry to be posted
to the accounts is summarized and totaled at the bottom of the page,
you can just put a check mark next to the entry in the PR column. For
transactions listed in the General Credit or General Debit columns, you
should indicate an account number for the account into which the trans-
action is posted.
 General Credit: Transactions that don’t have their own columns; these
transactions are entered individually into the accounts impacted.
For example, according to Figure 5-1, H.G. deposited $1,500 of his own
money into the Capital account on March 4th in order to pay bills. The
credit shown there will be posted to the Capital account at the end of
the month because the Capital account tracks all information about
assets H.G. pays into the business.
 Accounts Receivable Credit: Any transactions that are posted to the
Accounts Receivable account (which tracks information about cus-
tomers who buy products on store credit).
 Sales Credit: Credits for the Sales account.
 Cash Debit: Anything that will be added to the Cash account.

Part II: Keeping a Paper Trail 

You can set up your Cash Receipts journal with more columns if you have
accounts with frequent cash receipts. The big advantage to having individual
columns for active accounts is that, when you total the columns at the end of
the month, the total for the active accounts is the only thing you have to add
to the General Ledger accounts, which is a lot less work then entering every
Sales transaction individually in the General Ledger account. This approach
saves a lot of time posting to accounts that involve multiple transactions
every month. Individual transactions listed in the General Credits column
each need to be entered into the affected accounts separately, which takes a
lot more time that just entering a column total.
As you can see in Figure 5-1, the top right-hand corner of the journal page has
a box for the person who prepared the journal to sign and date and for some-
one who approves the entries to sign and date as well. If your business deals
with cash, it’s always a good idea to have a number of checks and balances to
ensure that cash is properly handled and recorded. For more safety mea-
sures, see Chapter 7.
Following outgoing cash
Cash going out of the business to pay bills, salaries, rents, and other necessi-
ties has its own journal, the Cash Disbursements journal. This journal is the
point of original entry for all business cash paid out to others.
No businessperson likes to see money go out the door, but imagine what
creditors, vendors, and others would think if they didn’t get the money they
were due. Put yourself in their shoes: Would you be able to buy needed sup-
plies if other companies didn’t pay what they owed you? Not a chance.
You need to track your outgoing cash just as carefully as you track incoming
cash (see the preceding section). Each entry in the Cash Disbursements jour-
nal must not only indicate how much cash was paid out but also designate
which account will be decreased in value because of the cash disbursal. For
example, cash disbursed to pay bills is credited to the Cash account (which
goes down in value) and is debited to the account from which the bill or loan
is paid, such as Accounts Payable. The debit decreases the amount still owed
in the Accounts Payable account.
In the Cash Disbursements journal, the Cash account is always the credit,
and the debits vary depending upon the outstanding debts to be paid. 
Figure 5-2 shows you what a series of transactions look like when they’re
entered in a Cash Disbursements journal.
71
Chapter 5: Keeping Journals

The Cash Disbursements journal in Figure 5-2 has eight columns of 
information:
 Date: The date of the transaction.
 Account Debited: The name of the account debited as well as any detail
about the reason for the debit.
Figure 5-2:

72
Part II: Keeping a Paper Trail 

 Check #: The number of the check used to pay the debt.
 PR (post reference): Where the transaction will be posted at the end of
the month. This information is filled in at the end of the month when you
do the posting to the General Ledger accounts. If the entry to be posted
to the accounts is summarized and totaled at the bottom of the page,
you can just put a check mark next to the entry in the PR column. For
transactions listed in the General Credit or General Debit columns, you
should indicate an account number for the account into which the trans-
action is posted.
 General Debit: Any transactions that don’t have their own columns;
these transactions are entered individually into the accounts they
impact.
For example, according to Figure 5-2, rent was paid on March 1st and will
be indicated by a debit in the Rent Expense.
 Accounts Payable Debit: Any transactions that are posted to the
Accounts Payable account (which tracks bills due).
 Salaries Debit: Debits to the Salaries expense account, which increase
the amount of salaries expenses paid in a particular month.
 Cash Credit: Anything that’s deducted from the Cash account.
You can set up your Cash Disbursements journal with more columns if you
have accounts with frequent cash disbursals. For example, in Figure 5-2, the
bookkeeper for this fictional company added one column each for Accounts
Payable and Salaries because cash for both accounts is disbursed multiple
times during the month. Rather than having to list each disbursement in the
Accounts Payable and Salaries accounts, she can just total each journal
column at the end of the month and add totals to the appropriate accounts.
This approach sure saves a lot of time when you’re working with your most
active accounts.
Managing Sales Like a Pro
Not all sales involve the collection of cash; many stores allow customers to
buy products on store credit using a store credit card. (I’m not talking about
buying with a bank-issued credit card, here; in that case, the bank, not the
store or company making the sale, is the one who has to worry about collect-
ing from the customer.)
Instead, store credit comes into play when a customer is allowed to take a
store’s products without paying immediately because he has an account
that’s billed monthly. This can be done by using a credit card issued by the
store or some other method the company uses to track credit purchases by
customers, such as having the customer sign a sales receipt indicating that
the amount should be charged to the customer’s account.
73
Chapter 5: Keeping Journals

Sales made on store credit don’t involve cash until the customer pays his bill.
(In contrast, with credit card sales, the store gets a cash payment from the
card-issuing bank before the customer even pays the credit card bill.) If your
company sells on store credit, the total value of the products bought on any
particular day becomes an item for the Accounts Receivable account, which
tracks all money due from customers. I talk more about managing accounts
receivable in Chapter 9.
Before allowing customers to buy on credit, your company should require
customers to apply for credit in advance so that you can check their credit
references.
When something’s sold on store credit, usually the cashier drafts an invoice
for the customer to sign when picking up the product. The invoice lists the
items purchased and the total amount due. After getting the customer’s sig-
nature, the invoice is tracked in both the Accounts Payable account and the
customer’s individual account.
Transactions for sales made by store credit first enter your books in the Sales
journal. Each entry in the Sales journal must indicate the customer’s name,
the invoice number, and the amount charged.
In the Sales journal, the Accounts Receivable account is debited, which
increases in value. The bookkeeper must also remember to make an entry to
the customer’s account records because the customer has not yet paid for
the item and will have to be billed for it. The transaction also increases the
value of the Sales account, which is credited.
Figure 5-3 shows a few days’ worth of transactions related to store credit.
The Sales journal in Figure 5-3 has six columns of information:
 Date: The date of the transaction.
 Customer Account Debited: The name of the customer whose account
should be debited.
 PR (post reference): Where the transaction will be posted at the end of
the month. This information is filled in at the end of the month when you
do the posting to the General Ledger accounts. If the entry to be posted
to the accounts is summarized and totaled at the bottom of the page,
you can just put a check mark next to the entry in the PR column. For
transactions listed in the General Credit or General Debit columns, you
should indicate an account number for the account into which the trans-
action is posted.
 Invoice Number: The invoice number for the purchase.
 Accounts Receivable Debit: Increases to the Accounts Receivable
account.
 Sales Credit: Increases to the Sales account.
74
Part II: Keeping a Paper Trail 

At the end of the month, the bookkeeper can just total the Accounts Receivable
and Sales columns shown in Figure 5-3 and post the totals to those General
Ledger accounts. She doesn’t need to post all the detail because she can always
refer back to the Sales journal. However, each invoice noted in the Sales jour-
nal must be carefully recorded in each customer’s account. Otherwise, the
bookkeeper doesn’t know who and how much to bill.

Chapter 5: Keeping Journals

Keeping Track of Purchases
Purchases of products to be sold to customers at a later date are a key type
of non-cash transaction. All businesses must have something to sell, whether
they manufacture it themselves or buy a finished product from some other com-
pany. Businesses usually make these purchases on credit from the company
that makes the product. In this case, the business becomes the customer of
another business.
Transactions for purchases bought on credit first enter your books in the
Purchases journal. Each entry in the Purchases journal must indicate the
vendor from whom the purchase was made, the vendor’s invoice number,
and the amount charged.
In the Purchases journal, the Accounts Payable account is credited, and the
Purchases account is debited, meaning both accounts increase in value.
The Accounts Payable account increases because the company now owes
more money to creditors, and the Purchases account increases because the
amount spent on goods to be sold goes up.
Figure 5-4 shows some store purchase transactions as they appear in the
company’s Purchases journal.
The Purchases journal in Figure 5-4 has six columns of information:
 Date: The date of the transaction.
 Vendor Account Credited: The name of the vendor from whom the pur-
chases were made.
 PR (post reference): Where information about the transaction will be
posted at the end of the month. This information is filled in at the end of
the month when you do the posting to the General Ledger accounts. If
the entry to be posted to the accounts is summarized and totaled at the
bottom of the page, you can just put a check mark next to the entry in
the PR column. For transactions listed in the General Credit or General
Debit columns, you should indicate an account number for the account
into which the transaction is posted.
 Invoice Number: The invoice number for the purchase assigned by the
vendor.
 Purchases Debit: Additions to the Purchases account.
 Accounts Payable Credit: Increases to the Accounts Payable account.
76
Part II: Keeping a Paper Trail 

At the end of the month, the bookkeeper can just total the Purchases and
Accounts Payable columns and post the totals to the corresponding General
Ledger accounts. She can refer back to the Purchases journal for details if nec-
essary. However, each invoice should be carefully recorded in each vendor’s
accounts so that there’s a running total of outstanding bills for each vendor.
Otherwise, the bookkeeper doesn’t know who and how much is owed.

Chapter 5: Keeping Journals

Dealing with Transactions that Don’t Fit
Not all your transactions fit in one of the four main journals (Cash Receipts,
Cash Disbursements, Sales, and Purchases). If you need to establish other
special journals as the original points of entry for transactions, go ahead.
The sky’s the limit!
If you keep your books the old-fashioned way — on paper — be aware that
paper is vulnerable to being mistakenly lost or destroyed. In this case, you
may want to consider keeping the number of journals you maintain to a 
minimum.
For transactions that don’t fit in the “big four” journals but they don’t nec-
essarily warrant the creation of their own journals, you should, consider
keeping a General Journal for miscellaneous transactions. Using columnar
paper similar to what’s used for the other four journals, create the following
columns:
 Date: The date of the transaction.
 Account: The account impacted by the transaction. More detail is
needed here because the General Ledger impacts so many different
accounts with so many different types of transactions. For example,
you will find only sales transactions in the Sales journal and Purchase
transactions in the Purchase journal, you could find any type of transac-
tion in the General journal affecting many less active accounts.
 PR (post reference): Where information about the transaction will be
posted at the end of the month. This information is filled in at the end of
the month when you do the posting to the General Ledger accounts. If
the entry to be posted to the accounts is summarized and totaled at the
bottom of the page, you can just put a check mark next to the entry in
the PR column. For transactions listed in the General Credit or General
Debit columns, you should indicate an account number for the account
into which the transaction is posted.
 General Debit: Contains most debits.
 General Credit: Contains most credits.
If you have certain accounts for which you expect a lot of activity, you can
start a column for those accounts, too. In Figure 5-4, I added columns for
Accounts Payable and Accounts Receivable. The big advantage of having a
separate column for an account is that you’ll be able to total that column at
the end of the month and just put the total in the General Ledger. You won’t
have to enter each transaction separately.
78
Part II: Keeping a Paper Trail 

Many businesses also add columns for Accounts Receivable and Accounts
Payable because those accounts are commonly impacted by non-cash 
transactions.
All the transactions in this General journal are non-cash transactions. Cash
transactions should go into one of the two cash journals: Cash Receipts (see
the section “Keeping track of incoming cash”) and Cash Disbursements 
(see the section “Following outgoing cash”).
In a General journal, transactions need to be entered on multiple lines
because each transaction impacts at least two accounts (and sometimes
more than two). For example, in the General journal shown in Figure 5-5, the
first transaction listed is the return of a cheesecake by S. Smith. This return
of products sold must be posted to the customer’s account as a credit as well
as to the Accounts Receivable account. Also, the Sales Return account, where
the business tracks all products returned by the customer, has to be debited.
March 5 – Return a portion of purchase from Henry’s Bakery Supplies, $200,
Debit memo 346. When a business returns a product purchased, it is tracked
in the Purchase Return account, which is credited. A debit must also be made
to the Accounts Payable account, as well as vendor’s account, since less
money is now owed. Cash does not change hands with this transaction.
March 5 – H.G. transferred car to business, $10,000. This transaction is
posted to the Vehicle asset account and the Capital account in Owner’s
Equity. Rather than deposit cash into the business, H.G. made his personal
vehicle a business asset.
In addition to the five columns mentioned above, the General journal in
Figure 5-5 has the following two columns:
 Accounts Payable Debit: Decreases to the Accounts Payable account.
The bookkeeper working with this journal anticipated that many of the
company’s transactions would impact Accounts Payable. She created
this column so that she can subtotal it and make just one entry to the
Accounts Payable account in the General Ledger.
 Accounts Receivable Credit: Decreases to the Accounts Receivable
account.
At the end of the month, the bookkeeper can just total this journal’s Accounts
Payable and Accounts Receivable columns and post those totals to the cor-
responding General Ledger accounts. All transaction details remain in the
General journal. However, because the miscellaneous transactions impact
General Ledger accounts, the transactions need to be posted to each affected
account separately (see “Posting Journal Information to Accounts”).

Part II: Keeping a Paper Trail 

Posting Journal Information to Accounts
When you close your books at the end of the month, you summarize all the
journals — that is, you total the columns and post the information to update
all the accounts involved.
Posting journal pages is a four-step process:
1. Number each journal page at the top if it isn’t already numbered.
2. Total any column that’s not titled General Debit or General Credit. Any
transactions recorded in the General Debit or General Credit columns
need to be recorded individually in the General Ledger.
3. Post the entries to the General Ledger account. Each transaction in the
General Credit or General Debit column must be posted separately. You
just need to post totals to the General Ledger for the other columns in
which transactions for more active accounts were entered in the General
journal. List the date and journal page number as well as the amount of
the debit or credit, so you can quickly find the entry for the original
transaction if you need more details.
The General Ledger account only shows debit or credit (whichever is
appropriate to the transaction). Only the journals have both sides of a
transaction. (I show you how to work with General Ledger accounts in
Chapter 5.)
4. In the PR column of the journal, record information about where the
entry is posted. If the entry to be posted to the accounts is summarized
and totaled at the bottom of the page, you can just put a check mark next
to the entry in the PR column. For transactions listed in the General
Credit or General Debit columns, you should indicate an account number
for the account into which the transaction is posted. This process helps
you confirm that you’ve posted all entries in the General Ledger.
Posting to the General Ledger is done at the end of an accounting period as
part of the process of closing the accounts. I cover the closing process in
greater detail in Chapter 15.
Figure 5-6 shows a summarized journal page, specifically the Cash Receipts
journal. You can see that entries that are listed in the Sales Credit and Cash
Debit columns on the Cash Receipts journal are just checked. Only one entry
was placed in the General Credit column, and that entry has an account
number in the PR column. While I don’t list all the transactions for the month,
which would of course be a much longer list, I do show how you summarize
the journal at the end of the month.
81
Chapter 5: Keeping Journals

As you can see in Figure 5-6, after summarizing the Cash Receipts journal,
there are only four General Ledger accounts (General Credit, Accounts
Receivable Credit, Sales Credit, and Cash Debit) and three customer accounts
(S. Smith, J. Jones, and P. Perry) into which you need to post entries. Even
better, the entries balance: $2,900 in debits and $2,900 in credits! (The cus-
tomer accounts total $500, which is good news because it’s the same amount
Figure 5-6:

82
Part II: Keeping a Paper Trail 

credited to Accounts Receivable. The Accounts Receivable account is
decreased by $500 because payments were received, as is the amount due
from the individual customer accounts.)
Simplifying Your Journaling with
Computerized Accounting
The process of posting first to the journals and then to the General Ledger
and individual customer or vendor accounts can be a very time-consuming
job. Luckily, most businesses today use computerized accounting software,
so the same information doesn’t need to be entered so many times. The com-
puter does the work for you.
If you’re working with a computerized accounting software package (see
Chapter 6), you only have to enter a transaction once. All the detail that nor-
mally needs to be entered into one of the journal pages, one of the General
Ledger accounts, and customer, vendor and other accounts is posted auto-
matically. Voila!
The method by which you initially enter your transaction varies depending
on the type of transaction. To show you what’s involved in making entries
into a computerized accounting system, the following figures show one entry
each from the Cash Receipts journal (see Figure 5-7 for a customer payment),
the Cash Disbursements journal (see Figure 5-8 for a list of bills to be paid),
and the Sales journal (see Figure 5-9 for an invoice). (The screenshots are all
from QuickBooks, a popular computerized bookkeeping system.)
As you can see in Figure 5-7, to enter the payment by S. Smith, all you need to
do is type “S. Smith” in the box labeled “Received From.” All outstanding
invoices then appear. You can put a check mark next to the invoices to be
paid, indicate the payment method (in this case, a check), enter the check
number, and hit “Save and close.”
When you use a software package to track your cash receipts, the following
accounts are automatically updated:
 The Cash Account is debited the appropriate amount.
 The Accounts Receivable Account is credited the appropriate amount.
 The corresponding customer account is credited the appropriate
amount.
That’s much simpler than adding the transaction to the Cash Receipts jour-
nal, closing out the journal at the end of the month, adding the transactions
to the accounts impacted by the cash receipts, and then (finally!) closing out
the books.
83
Chapter 5: Keeping Journals

Cash disbursements are even easier than cash receipts when you’ve got a com-
puterized system on your side. For example when paying bills (see Figure 5-8),
all you need to do is go to the bill paying screen for QuickBooks. In this exam-
ple, all the March bills are listed, so all you need to do is select the bills you
want to pay, and the system automatically sets the payments in motion.
Figure 5-8:

84
Part II: Keeping a Paper Trail 

The bill-paying perks of this system include:
 Checks can be automatically printed by the software package.
 Each of the vendor accounts are updated to show that payment is made.
 The Accounts Payable account is debited the appropriate amount for
your transaction, which decreases the amount due to vendors.
 The Cash Account is credited the appropriate amount for your transaction,
which decreases the amount of cash available (because it’s designated
for use to pay corresponding bills).
When you make the necessary entries into your computerized accounting
system for the information that would normally be found in a Sales journal
(for example, when a customer pays for your product on credit), you can
automatically create an invoice for the purchase. Figure 5-9 shows what that
invoice looks like when generated by a computerized accounting system.
Adding the customer name in the box marked “Customer” automatically fills
in all the necessary customer information. The date appears automatically,
and the system assigns a customer invoice number. You add the quantity and
select the type of product bought in the “Item Code” section, and the rest of
the invoice is calculated automatically. When the invoice is final, you can
print it and send it off to the customer.

Chapter 5: Keeping Journals

Figure 5-9 doesn’t show sales taxes, but that information is easily calculated
and added by the system. If sales taxes are indicated in the customer’s infor-
mation, then those figures are automatically calculated.
Filling out the invoice in the accounting system also updates the affected
accounts:
 The Accounts Receivable account is debited the appropriate amount,
which increases the amount due from customers by that amount.
 The Sales account is credited the appropriate amount, which increases
the revenue received by that amount.
 The invoice is added to the customer’s outstanding bills so that when
the customer makes a payment, the outstanding invoice appears on the
payment screen.

Computer Options 
for Your Bookkeeping
In This Chapter
 Finding the right accounting software for your business
 Getting your computerized books up and running
S
ome small business owners who have been around a while still do things
the old-fashioned way — they keep their books in paper journals and
ledgers. However, in this age of technology and instant information, the
majority of today’s businesses computerize their books.
Not only is computerized bookkeeping easier, but also it minimizes the chance
of errors because most of the work done to a computerized system’s ledgers
and journals (see Chapters 4 and 5, respectively) involves inputting data on
forms that can be understood even by someone without training in accounting
or bookkeeping. The person entering the information doesn’t need to know
whether something is a debit or credit (see Chapter 2 for an explanation of the
difference) because the computerized system takes care of everything.
In this chapter, I explore the three top accounting software packages for
small businesses, discuss the basics of setting up your own computerized
books, talk about how you can customize a program for your business, and
give you some pointers on converting your manual bookkeeping system into
a computerized one.
Surveying Your Software Options
More than 50 different types of accounting software programs are on the
market, and all are designed to computerize your bookkeeping. The more
sophisticated ones target specific industry needs, such as food services or
utilities, and can cost thousands of dollars. To check out those options, visit

www.findaccountingsoftware.com, where you can browse for accounting
software that’s grouped by industry — 29 to be exact, from Accommodations
and Food Services to Utilities.
Luckily, as a small businessperson, you probably don’t need all the bells and
whistles offered by the top-of-the-line programs. Instead, three software pro-
grams that I review in this chapter can meet the needs of most small business
people. Using one of the three systems I recommend, you can get started
with an initial investment of as little as $80. It may not be fancy, but basic
computerized accounting software can do a fine job of helping you keep your
books. And you can always upgrade to a more expensive program, if needed,
as your business grows.
The three programs that meet any small business’s basic bookkeeping needs
are Simply Accounting Pro, QuickBooks, and Peachtree Accounting. The most
affordable of the three is Simply Accounting Pro, which I’ve seen priced as
low as $77 at various Internet sites. QuickBooks and Peachtree Accounting
both offer simple systems, QuickBooks Simple Start and Peachtree First
Accounting that can get you started for as little as $100. But if you can afford
it, I recommend that you step up at least one notch to the basic levels —
QuickBooks Basic or Peachtree Accounting.
Accounting software packages are updated almost every year. That’s because
tax laws and laws involving many other aspects of operating a business
change so often. In addition, computer software companies are always
improving their products to make computerized accounting programs more
user-friendly, so be sure that you always buy the most current version of an
accounting software package.
Simply Accounting Pro
Simply Accounting Pro (www.simplyaccounting.com) is a cost-effective
choice for bookkeeping software if you’re just starting up and don’t have
sophisticated bookkeeping or accounting needs. For example, you can
process credit-card transactions and electronic features from inside the other
two accounting software programs I discuss in this chapter, but Simply
Accounting requires you to use an add-on tool. This program caters to the
bookkeeping novice and even provides an option that lets you avoid account-
ing jargon by using, for example, words like purchase and vendor instead of
accounts payable, when you want to record a purchase of goods from a
vendor. The program includes more than 100 accounting templates for things
like sales orders, quotes, receipts, and other basic needs for a variety of
industries, including medical/dental, real estate, property management, and
retail firms.
88
Part II: Keeping a Paper Trail 

Simply Accounting Pro has an integrated feature that allows you to do
Employee Direct Deposit for payroll, but for activities such as credit-card 
processing or electronic payments, you need to install an add-on feature.
However, the add-on feature doesn’t work as well as one that’s included in an
original software package, such as the one included as part of QuickBooks.
According to CNET (www.cnet.com), a company that offers excellent reviews
of computer hardware and software, Simply Accounting’s software support
team leaves a bit to be desired and isn’t always as helpful as the teams sup-
porting QuickBooks and Peachtree Accounting.
If you’re working with another software system to manage your business data
and are interesting in switching to Simply Accounting Pro, you may be able to
import that data directly into Simply Accounting. (Information about how to
import data is included with the program.) You can import data from software
such as Microsoft Excel (spreadsheet program) or Access (database pro-
gram). If you’re converting from QuickBooks or another accounting software
program called MYOB, you can easily import your data to Simply Accounting.
However, data from Microsoft Money and Intuit Quicken can’t be imported.
Peachtree Accounting
Peachtree Accounting (www.peachtree.com) is an excellent software package
for your bookkeeping and accounting needs, but it’s definitely not recom-
mended if you’re a novice. You need to be familiar with accounting jargon just
to use the Peachtree system, and its interface isn’t as user-friendly as the ones
for Simply Accounting or QuickBooks. I’ve used this program and didn’t like it
much because the user interface took much longer to learn and was not as
intuitive as QuickBooks even for someone who knew accounting jargon.
To use Peachtree Accounting, you definitely need to know your way around the
General Ledger and be comfortable with accounting terms such as Account
Reconciliation, Accounts Payable, and Cash Receipts journal. Although
Peachtree Accounting offers training options inside the program, it lacks the
sophistication of the excellent learning center now offered by QuickBooks. So if
you’re a beginner, which is probably the case since you bought this book, I
don’t recommend you start with this software.
CNET’s editors (www.cnet.com) consider Peachtree Accounting’s inventory-
management tools the best in its class. New versions of the software even
automatically generate purchase orders when inventory reaches a user-
specified level. You can also export Peachtree Accounting’s customer, vendor,
or employee databases into Microsoft Word and use the data with Word’s
89
Chapter 6: Computer Options for Your Bookkeeping

mail-merge feature to send emails or letters. CNET’s editors are very impressed
with Peachtree Accounting’s support team, which promises answers within
four hours. In fact, CNET said it sometimes got answers to questions in as
little as 15 minutes!
Peachtree Accounting costs around $200, but you may be able to find it
cheaper by searching the Internet. If you want to be able to integrate your
shipping with UPS, have more than one user, control users by screen-level
security, have advanced inventory or job costing capabilities, or have an audit
trail of your work, you need to start with Peachtree Complete Accounting,
which starts at around $300. (Multi-user capability for up to five users is a
whopping $700!)
Peachtree Accounting offers a utility that’s easy to use to convert data from
Intuit’s QuickBooks. You can also import files from Quicken. There’s no con-
version tool for Microsoft Excel data, but you can import and export Excel
files into the program without problems. Check out Peachtree For Dummies
(Wiley, Inc.), by Elaine J. Marmel and Diane Koers, to get a better feel for this
program, its capabilities, and how to use it.
QuickBooks
QuickBooks (www.quickbooks.intuit.com) offers the best of both worlds: an
easy user interface (for the novice) and extensive bookkeeping and accounting
features (for the experienced bookkeeper or accountant). That’s why I chose
to use QuickBooks to demonstrate various bookkeeping functions throughout
this book. Yes, it’s my favorite bookkeeping software, but I’m not alone — more
small business owners today use QuickBooks than any other small business
accounting software packages. Even CNET gives QuickBooks its highest rating
for accounting software packages in this class.
In 2005, QuickBooks got even better for the novice with the addition of its
learning center, which walks you through every type of key transaction with
an interactive program that not only shows you how to do the function but
also explains the basics of bookkeeping. You don’t have to use the tutorial,
but the option pops up when you do a task for the first time, so the choice is
always yours. You also can go back to the learning center to review at any
time. For additional information on this software, check out QuickBooks 2005
For Dummies (Wiley).
Most people have a love/hate relationship with Intuit support (Intuit’s the
company that makes QuickBooks). Personally, I’ve had good support experi-
ences not only with QuickBooks but also with its other popular software
packages, such as TurboTax or Quicken. But I also know others who have
complained loudly about support problems.
90
Part II: Keeping a Paper Trail 

QuickBooks Basic, priced around $200 (I found it on the Internet for as low as
$149), can meet most of your bookkeeping and accounting needs. If you want
to integrate your bookkeeping with a point-of-sale package, which integrates
cash register sales, you need to get QuickBooks Pro, which sells for around
$300 for a single user and $750 for up to five users. You also need to upgrade if
you want to do inventory management, generate purchase orders from esti-
mates or sales orders, do job costing and estimates, automatically create a
budget, or integrate your data for use with Microsoft Word and Excel programs.
QuickBooks is the most versatile software if you plan to use other software
packages along with it. It can share data with over 325 popular business soft-
ware applications. Sales, customer, and financial data can be shared easily, too,
so you don’t have to enter that information twice. To find out if QuickBooks
can share data with the business software applications you’re currently using
or plan to use, call Intuit at 888-729-1996.
Setting Up Your Computerized Books
After you pick your software, the hard work is done because actually setting
up the package will probably take you less time than researching your
options and picking your software. All three packages I discuss in this chap-
ter (see “Surveying Your Software Options”) have good start-up tutorials to
help you set up the books. QuickBooks even has an interactive interview that
asks questions about all aspects of how you want to run your business and
then sets up what you’ll need based on your answers.
91
Chapter 6: Computer Options for Your Bookkeeping
Add-ons and fees
All the accounting programs recommended in
this section offer add-ons and features you’re
likely to need, such as:
 Tax updates: If you have employees and
want up-to-date tax information and forms
to do your payroll using your accounting
software, you need to buy an update each
year.
 Online credit-card processing and elec-
tronic bill paying: Having the capabilities to
perform these tasks means additional fees.
In fact, QuickBooks advertises its add-ons
in these areas throughout its system; you
can see the advertisements pop up on a
number of screens.
 Point-of-sale software: This add-on helps
you integrate your sales at the cash register
with your accounting software.
Before signing on for one of the add-ons be sure
you understand what the fees will be. Usually,
you’re advised of the additional costs whenever
you try to do anything that incurs extra fees.

Simply Accounting Pro, Peachtree Accounting, and QuickBooks all produce a
number of sample Charts of Accounts (see Chapter 3) that automatically
appears after you choose the type of business you plan to run and upon
which industry that business falls. Start with one of the charts offered by the
software, like you see in Figure 6-1, and then tweak it to your business’s
needs.
Once your Chart of Accounts appears, all three programs ask you to enter a
company name, address, and tax identification numbers to get started. If
you’re operating as a sole proprietor or your business is based on a partner-
ship and you don’t have a federal tax ID for the business, you can use your
Social Security number. You then select an accounting period (see Figure 6-2).
If the calendar year is your accounting period, you don’t have to change any-
thing. But if you operate your business based on another period of 12 months,
such as September 1 to August 31, you must enter that information.
If you don’t change your accounting period to match how you plan to develop
your financial statements, then you have to delete the business from the system
and start over.

Part II: Keeping a Paper Trail 
Fiscal year
Many retail businesses don’t close their books
at the end of December, because the holiday
season is not a good time to be closing out for
the year. Each year with gift cards and other
new ways to give gifts, purchases after the 
holiday can be very active. So, many retail 
businesses operate on a fiscal year of Feb. 1 to 
Jan. 31, so they can close the books well after
the holiday season ends.

After you set up your business, you can customize the software so that it
matches your business’s needs.
Customizing software to match 
your operations
With the basics set up (see the preceding section), you can customize the
software to fit your business’s operations. For example, you’re able to pick
the type of invoices and other business forms you want to use.
This is also the time to input information about your bank accounts and
other key financial data (see Figure 6-3). Your main business bank account is
the one that should be used for the first account listed in your software pro-
gram, Cash in Checking.
After entering your bank and other financial information, you enter data
unique to your business. If you want to use the program’s budgeting features,
you enter your budget information before entering other data. Then you add
your vendor and customer accounts so that when you start entering transac-
tions, the information is already in the system. If you don’t have any outstanding
bills or customer payments due, you can wait and enter vendor and customer
information as the need arises.

Chapter 6: Computer Options for Your Bookkeeping

If you have payments to be made or money to be collected from customers,
be sure to input that information so your system is ready when it comes time
to pay the bills or input a customer payment. Also, you don’t want to forget
to pay a bill or collect from a customer!
You may be able to import data about your customers, vendors, and employ-
ees from software packages you’re currently using to track that information,
such as Microsoft Excel or Access. Full instructions for importing data comes
with the software program you choose.
Don’t panic about entering everything into your computerized system right
away. All programs make it very easy to add customers, vendors, and
employees at any time.
Other information collected includes the type of accounting method you’ll 
be using — either cash-basis or accrual accounting. (I talk about both in
Chapter 2.) You also need to enter information about whether or not you 
collect sales taxes from your customers and, if you do, the sales tax rates.
Also, you can pick a format for your invoices, set up payroll data, and make
arrangements for how you want to pay bills.
Converting your manual bookkeeping 
to a computerized system
If you’re converting a manual bookkeeping system to a computerized system,
your conversion will take a bit more time than just starting fresh because you
need to be sure your new system starts with information that matches your
Figure 6-3:

94
Part II: Keeping a Paper Trail 

current books. The process for entering your initial data varies depending on
the software you’ve chosen, so I don’t go into detail about that process here.
To ensure that you properly convert your bookkeeping system, use the infor-
mation that comes with your software; read through the manual, review the
startup suggestions made as you set up the system, and pick the methods
that best match your style of operating.
The best time to convert is at the end of an accounting period. That way, you
won’t have to do a lot of extra work adding transactions that already occurred
during a period. For example, if you decide to computerize your accounting
system on March 15, you’d have to add all the transactions that occurred
between March 1 and March 15 into your new system. It’s just easier to wait
until April 1 to get started even if you buy the software on March 15. While
you can convert to a computerized accounting system at the end of a month,
your best time to do it is at the end of a calendar or fiscal year. Otherwise, you
have to input data for all the months of the year that have passed.
Whenever you decide to start your computerized bookkeeping, use the data
from your trial balance that you used to close the books at the end of most
recent accounting period. (I explain how to prepare a trial balance in Chap-
ter 16.) In the computerized system, enter the balances for each of the
accounts in your trial balance. Asset, liability, and equity accounts should
have carry-over balances, but Income and Expense accounts should have
zero balances.
Of course, if you’re starting a new business, you won’t have a previous trial
balance. Then you just enter any balances you might have in your cash
accounts, any assets your business may own as it starts up, and any liabili-
ties that your business may already owe relating to startup expenses. You
also add any contributions from owners that were made to get the business
started in the Equity accounts.
After you enter all the appropriate data, run a series of financial reports, such
as an income statement and balance sheet, to be sure the data is entered and
formatted the way you like it. It’s a lot easier to change formatting when the
system isn’t chock-full of data.
You need to be sure that you’ve entered the right numbers, so verify that the
new accounting system’s financial reports match what you created manually.
If the numbers are different, now’s the time to figure out why. Otherwise the
reports you do at the end of the accounting period will be wrong. If the num-
bers don’t match, don’t assume the only place an error could be is in the data
entered. You may find that the error is in the reports you developed manually.
Of course, check your entries first, but if the income statement and balance
sheet still don’t look right, double-check your trial balances as well.

Chapter 7
Controlling Your Books, Your
Records, and Your Money
In This Chapter
 Protecting your business’s cash
 Maintaining proper paperwork
 Divvying up responsibilities
 Insuring your cash handlers
E
very business takes in cash in some form. Whether in the form of dollar
bills, checks, credit cards, or electronic payment, it’s all eventually
deposited as cash into the business’s accounts. Before you take in that first
penny, controlling that cash and making sure none of it walks out the door
improperly should be your first concern as a businessperson.
Finding the right level of cash control while at the same time allowing your
employees the flexibility to sell your products or services and provide ongo-
ing customer service can be a monumental task. If you don’t have enough
controls, you risk theft or embezzlement. Yet if you have too many controls,
employees may miss sales or anger customers.
In this chapter, I explain the basic protections you need to put in place to be
sure all cash coming into or going out of your business is clearly documented
and controlled. I also review the type of paperwork you need to document
the use of cash and other business assets. Finally, I tell you how to organize
your staff to properly control the flow of your assets and insure yourself
against possible misappropriation of those assets.

Putting Controls on Your Business’s Cash
Think about how careful you are with your personal cash. You find various
ways to protect how you carry it around, you dole it out carefully to your
family members, and you may even hide cash in a safe place in the house just
in case you need it for unexpected purposes.
If you’re that protective of your cash when you’re the only one who handles
it, consider the vulnerability of business cash. After all, you aren’t the only
one handling the cash for your business. You have some employees encounter-
ing incoming cash at cash registers and others opening the mail and finding
checks for orders to purchase products or pay bills and checks from other
sources. And don’t forget that employees may need petty cash to pay for mail
sent COD (Collect on Delivery) or to pay for other unexpected, low-cost needs.
If you were around to watch every transaction in which cash enters your
business, you wouldn’t have time to do the things you need to do to grow
your business. If your business is small enough, you can maintain control of
cash going out by signing all checks, but as soon as the business grows, you
may not have time for that either.
You can drive yourself crazy with worry about all this cash flow, but the truth
is that just putting in place the proper controls for your cash can help pro-
tect your business’s family jewels. Cash flows through your business in four
key ways:
 Deposits and payments into and out of your checking accounts
 Deposits and payments into and out of your savings accounts
 Petty cash funds in critical locations where fast cash may be needed
 Transactions made in your cash registers
The following sections cover some key controls for each of these cash flow
points.
Checking accounts
Almost every dime that comes into your business flows through your busi-
ness’s checking account (at least that’s what should happen). Whether it’s
cash collected at your cash registers, payments received in the mail, cash
used to fill the cash registers, or petty cash accounts, payments sent out to
pay business obligations, or any other cash need, this cash enters and exits
your checking account. That’s why your checking account is your main tool
for protecting your cash flow.
98
Part II: Keeping a Paper Trail 

Choosing the right bank
Finding the right bank to help you set up your checking account and the 
controls that limit access to that account is crucial. When evaluating your
banking options, ask yourself the following questions:
 Does this bank have a branch that’s conveniently located to my business?
 Does this bank operate at times when I need it most?
 Does this bank offer secure ways to deposit cash even when the bank is
closed?
Most banks have secure drop boxes for cash so you can deposit receipts
as quickly as possible at the end of the business day rather than secure
the cash overnight yourself.
Visit local bank branches yourself, and check out the type of business ser-
vices each bank offers. Pay particular attention to
 The type of personal attention you receive.
 How questions are handled.
 What type of charges may be tacked on for this personal attention.
Some banks require business account holders to call a centralized line for
assistance rather than depend on local branches. Some banks are even
adding charges today if you use a teller rather than an ATM (automatic teller
machine). Other banks charge for every transaction, whether it’s a deposit,
withdrawal, or a check. Many have charges that differ for business accounts,
and most have charges on printing checks. If you’re planning to accept credit
cards, compare the services offered for that as well.
Deciding on types of checks
After you choose your bank, you need to consider what type of checks you want
to use in your business. For example, you need different checks depending
upon whether you handwrite each check or print checks from your comput-
erized accounting system.
If you plan to write your checks, you’ll most likely use a business voucher
check in a three-ring binder; this type of check consists of a voucher on the
left and a check on the right (see Figure 7-1). This arrangement provides the
best control for manual checks because each check and voucher are num-
bered. When a check is written, the voucher should be filled out with details
about the date, the check’s recipient, and the purpose of the check. The
voucher also has a space to keep a running total of your balance in the
account.

If you plan to print checks from your computerized accounting system, you’ll
need to order checks that match that system’s programming. Each computer
software program has a unique template for printing checks. Figure 7-2 shows

accounting system. You can see there are actually three sections in a blank
computerized check: the check in the middle with two relatively blank sec-

Chapter 7: Controlling Your Books, Your Records, and Your Money

For one of the blank sections, you set up your computer accounting system
to print out the detail you’d expect to find on a manual voucher — the date,
name of the recipient, and purpose of the check. You keep this stub as a con-
trol for check use. In the other blank section, you print the information that
the recipient needs. For example, if it’s a check to pay an outstanding invoice,
you include all information the vendor needs to properly credit that invoice,
such as the amount, the invoice number, and your account number. If it’s a
payroll check, one of the blank sections should contain all the required pay-
roll information including amount of gross check, amount of net check, taxes
taken out, totals for current check, and year-to-date totals. Send the check
and portion that includes detail needed by your vendor, employee, or other
recipient to whoever you intend to pay.
Initially, when the business is small, you can keep control of the outflow of
money by signing each check. But as the business grows, you’ll probably find
that you need to delegate check-signing responsibilities to someone else, espe-
cially if your business requires you to travel frequently. Many small business
owners set up check-signing procedures that allow one or two of their staff
people to sign checks up to a designated amount, such as $5,000. Any checks
above that designated amount require the owner’s or the signature of an
employee and a second designated person, such as an officer of the company.
Arranging deposits to the checking account
Of course, you aren’t just withdrawing from your business’s checking account
(that would be a big problem). You also need to deposit money into that
account, and you want to be sure your deposit slips contain all the needed
detail as well as documentation to back up the deposit information. Most
banks provide printed deposit slips with all the necessary detail to be sure
the money is deposited in the appropriate account. They also usually provide
you with a “for deposit only” stamp that includes the account number for the
back of the checks. (If you don’t get that stamp from the bank, be sure to
have one made as soon as possible.)
Whoever opens your business mail should be instructed to use that “for
deposit only” stamp immediately on the back of any check received in the
mail. Stamping “for deposit only” on the back of a check makes it a lot harder
for anyone to use that check for other than its intended business purposes.
(I talk more about controls for incoming cash in the “Dividing staff responsi-
bilities” section, later in this chapter.) If you get both personal and business
checks sent to the same address, you need to set up some instructions for
the person opening the mail regarding how to differentiate the types of
checks and how each type of check should be handled to best protect your
incoming cash, whether for business or personal purposes.
102
Part II: Keeping a Paper Trail 

To secure incoming cash even more carefully, some businesses set up lock
box services with a bank. Customers or others sending checks to the busi-
ness mail checks to a post office box number that goes directly to the bank,
and a bank employee opens and deposits the checks right into the business’s
account.
You may think that making bank deposits is as easy as 1-2-3, but when it
comes to business deposits and multiple checks, things get a bit more com-
plicated. To properly make deposits to your business’s checking account,
follow these steps:
1. Record on the deposit slip the numbers of all checks being deposited
as well as the total cash being deposited.
2. Make photocopies of all checks being deposited so that you have a
record in case something gets lost or misplaced at the bank.
3. After you make the deposit, attach the copies of all the checks to
the deposit receipt and add any detail regarding the source of the
deposited cash; file everything in your daily bank folder.
(I talk more about filing in the section “Keeping the Right Paperwork,”
later in this chapter.)
Savings accounts
Some businesses find they have more cash than they need to meet their
immediate plans. Rather than keep that extra cash in a non-interest bearing
account, many businesses open a savings account to store the extra cash
stash.
If you’re a small business owner with few employees, you’ll probably be the
one to control the flow of money into and out of your savings account. As you
grow and find that you need to delegate the responsibility for the business’s
savings, be sure to think carefully about who gets access and how you will
document the flow of funds into and out of the savings account.
Petty cash accounts
Every business needs unexpected cash on almost a weekly basis. Whether it’s
money to pay the postman when he brings a letter or package COD, money to
buy a few emergency stamps to get the mail out, or money for some office sup-
plies needed before the next delivery, businesses need to keep some cash on
hand, called petty cash, for unexpected expenses.
103
Chapter 7: Controlling Your Books, Your Records, and Your Money

You certainly don’t want to have a lot of cash sitting around in the office, but
you should keep $50 to $100 in a petty cash box. If you find that you’re faced
with cash expenses more or less often than you initially expected, you can
adjust the amount kept in petty cash accordingly.
No matter how much you keep in petty cash, be sure you set up a good con-
trol system that requires anyone who uses the cash to write a voucher that
specifies how much was used and why. If possible, you should also ask that
a cash receipt from the store or post office, for example, be attached to the
voucher in order to justify the cash withdrawal. In most cases, a staff person
buys something for the business and then gets reimbursed for that expense.
If the expense is small enough, you can reimburse it by using the petty cash
fund. If the expense is more than a few dollars, you’d likely ask the person to
fill out an expense account form and get reimbursed by check. Petty cash
usually is used for minor expenses of $5 to $10 or less.
The best control for petty cash is to pick one person in the office to manage
the use of petty cash. Before giving that person more cash, he or she should
be able to prove the absence of cash used and why it was used.
Cash registers
Have you ever gone into a business and tried to pay with a large bill only to
find out the cashier can’t make change? It’s frustrating, but it happens in
many businesses, especially when they don’t carefully monitor the money in
their cash registers. Most businesses empty cash registers each night and
put any cash not being deposited in the bank that night into a safe. However,
many businesses instruct their cashiers to periodically deposit their cash in
a company safe throughout the day and get a paper voucher to show the
cash deposited. These daytime deposits minimize the cash held in the cash
draw in case the store is the victim of a robbery.
All these types of controls are necessary parts of modern business operations,
but they can have consequences that make customers angry. Most customers
will just walk out the door and not come back if they can’t buy what they want
using the bills they have on hand.
At the beginning of the day, cashiers usually start out with a set amount of
cash in the register. As they collect money and give out change, the register
records the transactions. At the end of the day, the cashier must count out
the amount of change left in the register, run a copy of all transactions that
passed through that register, and total the cash collected. Then the cashier
must prove that the amount of cash remaining in that register totals the
amount of cash the register started with plus the amount of cash collected
during the day. After the cashier balances the register, the staff person in
104
Part II: Keeping a Paper Trail 

charge of cash deposits (usually the store manager or someone on the
accounting or bookkeeping staff) takes all cash out except the amount that
will be needed for the next day and deposits it in the bank. (I talk more about
separation of staff duties in the section “Dividing staff responsibilities,” later
in this chapter.)
In addition to having the proper amount of cash in the register necessary to
give customers the change they need, you also must make sure that your
cashiers are giving the right amount of change and actually recording all
sales on their cash registers. Keeping an eye on cashier activities is good
business practice, but it’s always a way to protect cash theft by your employ-
ees. There are three ways cashiers can pocket some extra cash:
 They don’t record the sale in the cash register and instead pocket the
cash. The best deterrent to this type of theft is supervision. You can
decrease the likelihood of theft through unrecorded sales by printing up
sales tickets that the cashier must use to enter a sale in the cash register
and open the cash drawer. If cash register transactions don’t match
sales receipts, then the cashier must show a voided transaction for the
missing ticket or explain why the cash drawer was opened without a
ticket.
 They don’t provide a sales receipt and instead pocket the cash. In this
scenario the cashier neglects to give a sales receipt to one customer in
line. The cashier gives the next customer the unused sales receipt but
doesn’t actually record the second transaction in the cash register.
Instead, he or she just pockets the cash. In the company’s books, the
second sale never took place. The customer whose sale wasn’t recorded
has a valid receipt though it may not match exactly what he bought, so
he likely won’t notice any problem unless he wants to return something
later. Your best defense against this type of deception is to post a sign
reminding all customers that they should get a receipt for all purchases
and that the receipt is required to get a refund or exchange. Providing
numbered sales receipts that include a duplicate copy can also help pre-
vent this problem; cashiers need to produce the duplicates at the end of
the day when proving the amount of cash flow that passed through their
registers.
In addition to protection from theft by cashiers, the printed sales receipt
system can be used to carefully monitor and prevent shoplifters from
getting money for merchandise they never bought. For example, sup-
pose a shoplifter took a blouse out of a store, as well as some blank
sales receipts. The next day the shoplifter comes back with the blouse
and one of the stolen sales receipts filled out as though the blouse had
actually been purchased the day before. You can spot the fraud because
that sales receipt is part of a numbered batch of sales receipts that
you’ve already identified as missing or stolen. You can quickly identify
that the customer never paid for the merchandise and call the police.
105
Chapter 7: Controlling Your Books, Your Records, and Your Money

 They record a false credit voucher and keep the cash for themselves.
In this case the cashier wrote up a credit voucher for a nonexistent cus-
tomer and then pocketed the cash themselves. Most stores control this
problem by using a numbered credit voucher system, so each credit can
be carefully monitored with some detail that proves it’s based on a pre-
vious customer purchase, such as a sales receipt. Also, stores usually
require that a manager reviews the reason for the credit voucher,
whether a return or exchange, and approves the transaction before cash
or credit is given. When the bookkeeper records the sales return in the
books, the number for the credit voucher is recorded with the transac-
tion so that she can easily find the detail about that credit voucher if a
question is raised later about the transaction.
Even if cashiers don’t deliberately pocket cash, they can do so inadvertently
by giving the wrong change. If you run a retail outlet, training and supervising
your cashiers is a critical task that you must either handle yourself or hand
over to a trusted employee.
Keeping the Right Paperwork
When it comes to handling cash, whether you’re talking about the cash regis-
ter, deposits into your checking accounts, or petty cash withdrawals, you can
see that a lot of paper changes hands. In order to properly control the move-
ment of cash into and out of your business, careful documentation is key. And
don’t forget about organization; you need to be able to find that documenta-
tion if questions about cash flow arise later.
Monitoring cash flow isn’t the only reason you need to keep loads of paper-
work. In order to do your taxes and write off business expenses, you have to
have receipts for expenses. You also need details about the money you paid
to employees and taxes collected for your employees in order to file the
proper reports with government entities. (I discuss taxes in Chapter 21 and
dealing with the government relating to employee matters in Chapter 11.)
Setting up a good filing system and knowing what to keep and for how long to
keep it is very important for any small businessperson.
Creating a filing system
To get started setting up your filing system, you need some supplies, 
specifically:
106
Part II: Keeping a Paper Trail 

 Filing cabinets: This one’s pretty self-explanatory — it’s hard to have a
filing system with nothing to keep the files in. . . .
 File folders: Use these to set up separate files for each of your vendors,
employees, and customers who buy on store credit as well as files for
backup information on each of your transactions. Many bookkeepers file
transaction information by the date the transaction was added to their
journal. If the transaction relates to a customer, vendor, or employee, they
add a duplicate copy of the transaction to the individual files as well.
Even if you have a computerized accounting system, you need to file
paperwork related to the transactions you enter into your computer
system. You should still maintain employee, vendor, and customer files
in hard copy just in case something goes wrong, like if your computer
system crashes and you need the originals to restore the data. Of course,
you should avoid that type of crisis at all costs and back up your com-
puterized accounting system’s data regularly. Daily backups are best;
one weekly is the longest you should ever go without a backup.
 Three-ring binders: These binders are great for things like your Chart of
Accounts (see Chapter 3), your General Ledger (see Chapter 4) and your
system of journals (see Chapter 5) because you’ll be adding to these
documents regularly and the binders make it easy to add additional
pages. Be sure to number the pages as you add them to the binder, so
you can quickly spot a missing page. How many binders you need
depends on how many financial transactions you have each accounting
period. You can keep everything in one binder, or you may want to set
up a binder for the Chart of Accounts and General Ledger and then a
separate binder for each of your active journals. It’s your decision based
on what makes your job easier.
 Expandable files: These are the best way to keep track of current
vendor activity and any bills that may be due. Make sure you have an
• Alphabetical file: Use this file to track all your outstanding pur-
chase orders by vendor. After you fill the order, you can file all
details about that order in the vendor’s individual file in case 
questions about the order arise later.
• A 12-month file: Use this file to keep track of bills that you need to
pay. Simply place the bill in the slot for the month that it’s due.
Many companies also use a 30-day expandable file. At the begin-
ning of the month, the bills are placed in the 30-day expandable file
based on the dates that they need to be paid. This approach pro-
vides a quick and organized visual reminder for bills that are due.
If you’re using a computerized accounting system, you likely don’t need
the expandable files because your accounting system can remind you
when bills are due (as long as you added the information to the system
when the bill arrived).
107
Chapter 7: Controlling Your Books, Your Records, and Your Money

 Blank computer disks or other storage media: Use these to backup
your computerized system on a weekly or, better yet, daily basis. Keep
the backup discs in a fire safe or some place that won’t be affected if the
business is destroyed by a fire. (A fire safe is a must for any business; it’s
the best way to keep critical financial data safe.)
Figuring out what to keep 
and for how long
As you can probably imagine, the pile of paperwork you need to hold on to
can get very large very quickly. As they see their files getting thicker and
thicker, most business people wonder what they can toss, what they really
need to keep, and how long they need to keep it.
Generally, you should keep most transaction-related paperwork for as long as
the tax man can come and audit your books. For most types of audits, that’s
three years after you file your return. But if you failed to file taxes or filed
taxes fraudulently (and I hope this isn’t the case for you), you may be ques-
tioned by the IRS at any time because there’s no statute of limitations in
these cases.
The tax man isn’t the only reason to keep records around longer than one
year. You may need proof-of-purchase information for your insurance com-
pany if an asset is lost, stolen, or destroyed by fire or other accident. Also,
you need to hang on to information regarding any business loan until it’s paid
off, just in case the bank questions how much you paid. After the loan’s paid
off, be sure to keep proof of payment indefinitely in case a question about the
loan ever arises. Information about real estate and other asset holdings also
should be kept around for as long as you hold the asset and for at least three
years after the asset is sold. And it’s necessary to keep information about
employees for at least three years after the employee leaves. (If any legal
action arises regarding that employee’s job tenure after the employee leaves,
the statute of limitations for legal action is at most three years.)
Keep the current year’s files easily accessible in a designated filing area and
keep the most recent past year’s files in accessible filing cabinets if you have
room. Box up records when they hit the two-year-old mark, and put them in
storage. Be sure to date your boxed records with information about what they
are, when they were put into storage, and when it’s okay to destroy them. So
many people forget that detail about when it’s safe to destroy the boxes, so
they just pile up until total desperation sets in and there’s no more room.
Then someone must take the time to sort through the boxes and figure out
what needs to be kept and what can be destroyed, and that’s not a fun job.
108
Part II: Keeping a Paper Trail 

Generally, keep information about all transactions around for about three
years. After that, make a list of things you want to hold on to longer for
other reasons, such as asset holdings and loan information. Check with
your lawyer and accountant to get their recommendations on what to keep
and for how long.
Protecting Your Business 
Against Internal Fraud
Many businesspeople start their operations by carefully hiring people they
can trust, thinking “We’re family — they’ll never steal from me.” Unfortunately,
those who have learned the truth are the ones who put too much trust in just
one employee.
Too often a business owner finds out too late that even the most loyal
employee may steal from the company if the opportunity arises and the
temptation becomes too great — or if the employee finds himself caught up
in a serious personal financial dilemma and needs fast cash. After introducing
you to the various ways people can steal from a company, I talk about steps
you can take to prevent it.
Facing the reality of financial fraud
The four basic types of financial fraud are
 Embezzlement, also called larceny, which is the illegal use of funds by a
person who controls those funds. For example, a bookkeeper may use
company money for his own personal needs. Many times, embezzlement
stories don’t make it into the paper because businesspeople are so
embarrassed that they choose to keep the affair quiet instead. They usu-
ally settle privately with the embezzler rather than face public scrutiny.
 Internal theft, which is the stealing of company assets by employees,
such as taking office supplies or products the company sells without
paying for them. Internal theft is often the culprit behind inventory
shrinkage.
 Payoffs and kickbacks, which are situations in which employees accept
cash or other benefits in exchange for access to the company’s busi-
ness, often creating a scenario where the company that the employee
works for pays more for the goods or products than necessary. That
109
Chapter 7: Controlling Your Books, Your Records, and Your Money

extra money finds its way into the employee’s pocket who helped facili-
tate the access. For example, say Company A wants to sell its products
to Company B. An employee in Company B helps Company A get in the
door. Company A prices its product a bit higher and gives the employee
of Company B that extra profit in the form of a kickback for helping it
out. A payoff is paid before the sale is made, essentially saying “please.”
A kickback is paid after the sale is made, essentially saying “thank you.”
In reality, payoffs and kickbacks are a form of bribery, but few compa-
nies report or litigate this problem (although sometimes employees are
fired when deals are uncovered).
 Skimming, which occurs when employees take money from receipts and
don’t record the revenue on the books.
Although any of these financial crimes can happen in a small business, the
one that hits small businesses the hardest is embezzlement. Embezzlement
happens most frequently in small businesses when one person has access or
control over most of the company’s financial activities. For example, a book-
keeper may write checks, make deposits, and balance the monthly bank
statement — talk about having your fingers in a very big cookie jar.
110
Part II: Keeping a Paper Trail 
Caught with fingers in the cookie jar
Alice is a bookkeeper who’s been with the
Company A a long time. She got promoted to
office manager after she was with the company
for 20 years. She’s like a family member to the
business owner, who trusts her implicitly.
Because he’s so busy with other aspects of run-
ning the business, he gives her control of the
daily grind of cash flow. The beloved office man-
ager handles or supervises all incoming and
outgoing cash, proves out the bank statements,
handles payroll, signs all the checks, and files
the business’s tax returns.
All that control gives her the opportunity, cred-
ibility, and access to embezzle a lot of money. At
first, the trust was well founded, and Alice han-
dled her new responsibilities very well. But after
about three years in the role as offer manager,
her son was struck with a severe illness, and
the medical bills continued to mount.
Alice decides to pay herself more money. She
adds her husband or other family members to
the payroll and documents the checks for them
as consulting expenses. She draws large cash
checks to buy nonexistent office supplies and
equipment, and then, the worst of all, she files
the company’s tax returns and pockets the
money that should go to paying the taxes due.
The business owner doesn’t find out about the
problem until the IRS comes calling, and by
then, the office manager’s retired and moved
away.
Sound far-fetched? Well, it’s not. You may not
hear this exact scenario, but you likely to see
stories in your local newspaper about similar
embezzlement schemes.

Dividing staff responsibilities
Your primary protection against financial crime is properly separating staff
responsibilities when the flow of business cash is involved. Basically, you
should never have one person handle more than one of the following tasks:
 Bookkeeping: Involves reviewing and entering all transactions into the
company’s books. The bookkeeper makes sure that transactions are
accurate, valid, appropriate, and have the proper authorization. For
example, if a transaction requires paying a vendor, the bookkeeper
makes sure the charges are accurate and that someone with proper
authority has approved the payment. The bookkeeper can review docu-
mentation of cash receipts and the overnight deposits taken to the bank,
but he or she shouldn’t be the person who actually makes the deposit.
Also, if the bookkeeper is responsible for handling payments from exter-
nal parties, such as customers or vendors, he or she shouldn’t be the
one to enter those transactions in the books.
 Authorization: Involves being the manager or managers delegated to
authorize expenditures for their departments. You may decide that
transactions over a certain amount must have two or more authoriza-
tions before checks can be sent to pay a bill. Authorization levels should
be clearly spelled out and followed by all, even the owner or president
of the company. (Remember, as owner, you set the tone for how the rest
of the office operates; if you take shortcuts, you set a bad example and
undermine the system you put in place.)
111
Chapter 7: Controlling Your Books, Your Records, and Your Money
Employee embezzlement and theft cost companies
more than customer theft
According to the Institute for Financial Crime
Prevention, internal theft by employees is the
largest single component of white-collar crime.
You don’t hear much about it, though, because
many businesses chose to keep it quiet. The
reality is that employee theft and embezzlement
in the United States are estimated to cost
employers over $200 billion per year or over
$500 million per day. Total cost to businesses is
ten times more than the amount lost through all
other crimes against businesses combined.
Banks, for example, report 95 percent of 
their theft losses from employee misdeeds as
opposed to 5 percent of theft losses from bank
robberies and customer theft. The institute says
four key situations in the workplace provide
opportunities for theft and embezzlement: poor
internal controls, too much control given to cer-
tain individuals, lax management, and failure to
adequately prescreen employees.

 Money-handling: Involves direct contact with incoming cash or revenue,
whether check, credit card, or store credit transactions, as well as out-
going cash flow. The person who handles money directly, such as a
cashier, shouldn’t be the one who prepares and makes bank deposits.
Likewise, the person writing checks to pay company bills shouldn’t be
authorized to sign those checks; to be safe, one person should prepare
the checks based on authorized documentation, and a second person
should sign those checks after reviewing the authorized documentation.
When setting up your cash-handling systems, try to think like an embez-
zler to figure out ways someone could take advantage of a system.
 Financial report preparation and analysis: Involves the actual prepara-
tion of the financial reports and any analysis of those reports. Financial
reports should be prepared by someone who’s not involved in the day-
to-day entering of transactions in the books. For most small businesses,
the bookkeeper turns over the raw reports from the computerized
accounting system to an outside accountant who reviews the materials
and prepares the financial reports. In addition, he or she does a financial
analysis of the business activity results for the previous accounting
period.
I realize that you may be just starting up a small business and therefore not
have enough staff to separate all these duties. Until you do have that capabil-
ity, be sure to stay heavily involved in the inflow and outflow of cash in your
business.
 Open your business’s bank statements every month, and keep a close
watch on the transactions. Someone else can be given the responsibility
to prove out the statement, but you should still keep an eye on the
transactions listed.
 Periodically look at your business check voucher system to be sure
there aren’t missing checks. A bookkeeper who knows you periodically
check the books is less likely to find an opportunity for theft or embez-
zlement. If you find that a check or page of checks is missing, act quickly
to find out if the checks were used legitimately. If you can’t find the
answer, call your bank and put a stop on the missing check numbers.
 Periodically observe cash handling by your cashiers and managers to
be sure they’re following the rules you’ve established. It’s known as
management by walking around — the more often you’re out there, the
less likely you are to be a victim of employee theft and fraud.
Balancing control costs
As a small businessperson, you’ll always be trying to balance the cost of pro-
tecting your cash and assets with the cost of adequately separating those
duties. It can be a big mistake to put in too many controls that end up costing
112
Part II: Keeping a Paper Trail 

you money. For example, you may put in inventory controls that require
salespeople to contact one particular person who has the key to your prod-
uct warehouse. This kind of control may prevent employee theft, but it also
may result in lost sales because salespeople can’t find the key-holder when
they’re dealing with an interested customer. In the end, the customer gets
mad, and you lose the sale.
When you put controls in place, talk to your staff both before and after institut-
ing the controls to see how they’re working and to check for any unforeseen
problems. Be willing and able to adjust your controls to balance the business
needs of selling your products, manage the cash flow, and keep your eye on
making a profit.
Generally, as you make rules for your internal controls, be sure that the cost
of protecting an asset is no more than the asset you’re trying to protect. For
example, don’t go overboard to protect office supplies by forcing your staff to
sit around waiting for hours to access needed supplies while you and a man-
ager are at a meeting away from the office.
Ask yourself these four questions as you design your internal controls:
 What exactly do I want to prevent or detect — errors, sloppiness, theft,
fraud, or embezzlement?
 Do I face the problem frequently?
 What do I estimate the loss to be?
 What will it cost me to implement the change in procedures to prevent
or detect the problem?
You can’t answers these questions all by yourself, so consult with your man-
agers and the staff that will be impacted by the changes. Get their answers to
these questions, and listen to their feedback.
When you finish putting together the new internal control rule, be sure to
document why you decided to implement the rule and the information you
collected in developing it. After it’s been in place for a while, test your
assumptions. Be sure you’re in fact detecting the errors, theft, fraud, or
embezzlement that you hoped and expected to detect. Check the costs of
keeping the rule in place by looking at cash outlay, employee time and
morale, and the impact on customer service. If you find any problems with
your internal controls, take the time to fix them and change the rule, again
documenting the process. With detailed documentation, if two or three years
down the road someone questions why he or she is doing something, you’ll
have the answers and be able to determine if the problem is still a valid one
and if the rule is still necessary or needs to be changed.

Chapter 7: Controlling Your Books, Your Records, and Your Money

Insuring Your Cash through 
Employee Bonding
If you have employees who handle a lot of cash, insuring your business
against theft is an absolute must. This insurance, called fidelity bonds, helps
you protect yourself against theft and reduce your risk of loss. Employee
bonding is a common part of an overall business insurance package.
If you carry a fidelity bond on your cash handlers, you’re covered for losses
sustained by any employee who’s bonded. You also have coverage if an
employee’s act causes losses to a client of your business. For example, if
you’re a financial consultant and your bookkeeper embezzles a client’s cash,
you’re protected for the loss.
Fidelity bonds are a type of insurance that you can buy through the company
that handles your business insurance policies. The cost varies greatly
depending on the type of business you operate and the amount of cash or
other assets that are handled by the employees you want to bond. If an
employee steals from you or one of your customers, the insurance covers
the loss.
Employers bond employees who handle cash, as well as employees who may
be in a position to steal something other than cash. For example, a janitorial
service bonds its workers in case a worker steals something from one of its
customers. If a customer reports something missing, the insurance company
that bonded the employee covers the loss. Without a bond, an employer
must pay back the customer for any loss.

Your Purchases

n order to make money, your business must have something to sell.
Whether you sell products or offer services, you have to deal with costs
directly related to the goods or services being sold. Those costs primarily
come from the purchase or manufacturing of the products you plan to sell or
the items you need in order to provide the services.
All companies must keep careful watch over the cost of the products to be
sold or services to be offered. Ultimately, your company’s profits depend on
how well you manage those costs because, in most cases, costs increase over
time rather than decrease. How often do you find a reduction in the price of
needed items? Doesn’t happen often. If costs increase but the price to the
customer remains unchanged, the profit you make on each sale is less.
In addition to the costs to produce products or services, every business has
additional expenses associated with purchasing supplies needed to run the
business. The bookkeeper has primary responsibility for monitoring all these
costs and expenses as invoices are paid and alerting company owners or
managers when vendors increase prices. This chapter covers how to track
purchases and their costs, manage inventory, buy and manage supplies as
well as pay the bills for the items your business buys.

Keeping Track of Inventory
Products to be sold are called inventory. As a bookkeeper, you use two
accounts to track inventory:
 Purchases: Where you record the actual purchase of goods to be sold.
This account is used to calculate the Cost of Goods Sold, which is an 
item on the income statement (see Chapter 19 for more on the income
statement).
 Inventory: Where you track the value of inventory on hand. This value
is shown on the balance sheet as an asset in a line item called Inventory
(see Chapter 18 for more on the balance sheet).
Companies track physical inventory on hand using one of two methods:
 Periodic inventory: Conducting a physical count of the inventory in 
the stores and in the warehouse. This count can be done daily, monthly,
yearly, or for any other period that best matches your business needs.
(Many stores close for all or part of a day when they must count 
inventory.)
 Perpetual inventory: Adjusting inventory counts as each sale is made.
In order to use this method, you must manage your inventory using
a computerized accounting system that’s tied into your point of sale
(usually cash registers).
Even if you use a perpetual inventory method, it’s a good idea to periodi-
cally do a physical count of inventory to be sure those numbers match
what’s in your computer system. Because theft, damage, and loss of
inventory aren’t automatically entered in your computer system, the
losses don’t show up until you do a physical count of the inventory you
have on hand in your business.
When preparing your income statement at the end of an accounting period
(whether that period is for a month, a quarter, or a year), you need to calcu-
late the Cost of Goods Sold in order to calculate the profit made.
In order to calculate the Cost of Goods Sold, you must first find out how many
items of inventory were sold. You start with the amount of inventory on hand
at the beginning of the month (called Beginning Inventory), as recorded in the
Inventory account, and add the amount of purchases, as recorded in the
Purchases account, to find the Goods Available for Sale. Then you subtract the
Inventory on hand at the end of the month, which is determined by counting
remaining inventory.
Here’s how you calculate the number of goods sold:
118
Part III: Tracking Day-to-Day Operations with Your Books 

Beginning Inventory + Purchases = Goods available for sale – 
Ending inventory = Items sold
After you determine the number of goods sold, you compare that number to
the actual number of items sold by the company during that accounting
period, which is based on sales figures collected through the month. If
the numbers don’t match, you have a problem. The mistake may be in the
inventory count, or items may be unaccounted for because they’ve been 
misplaced or damaged and discarded. In the worst-case scenario, you may
have a problem with theft by customers or employees. These differences are
usually tracked within the accounting system in a line item called Inventory
Shrinkage.
Entering initial cost
When your company first receives inventory, you enter the initial cost of that
inventory into the bookkeeping system based on the shipment’s invoice. In
some cases, invoices are sent separately, and only a packing slip is included
in the order. If that’s the case, you should still record the receipt of the goods
because the company incurs the cost from the day the goods are received
and must be sure it will have the money to pay for the goods when the
invoice arrives and the bill comes due. (You track outstanding bills in the
Accounts Payable account.)
Entering the receipt of inventory is a relatively easy entry in the bookkeeping
system. For example, if your company buys $1,000 of inventory to be sold,
you make the following record in the books:
Debit
Credit
Purchases
$1,000
Accounts Payable
$1,000
The Purchases account increases by $1,000 to reflect the additional costs,
and the Accounts Payable account increases by the same amount to reflect
the amount of the bill that needs to be paid in the future.
When inventory enters your business, in addition to recording the actual
costs, you need more detail about what was bought, how much of each item
was bought, and what each item cost. You also need to track
 How much inventory you have on hand.
 The value of the inventory you have on hand.
 When you need to order more inventory.
119
Chapter 8: Buying and Tracking Your Purchases

Tracking these details for each type of product bought can be a nightmare,
especially if you’re trying to keep the books for a retail store because you
need to set up a special Inventory journal with pages detailing purchase and
sale information for every item you carry. (See Chapter 5 for the scoop on
journals.)
However, computerized accounting simplifies this process of tracking inven-
tory. Details about inventory can be entered initially into your computer
accounting system in several ways:
 If you pay by check or credit card when you receive the inventory, you
can enter the details about each item on the check or credit card form.
 If you use purchase orders, you can enter the detail about each item on
the purchase order, record receipt of the items when they arrive, and
update the information when you receive the bill.
 If you don’t use purchase orders, you can enter the detail about the
items when you receive them and update the information when you
receive the bill.
To give you an idea of how this information is collected in a computerized
accounting software program, Figure 8-1 shows you how to enter the details
in QuickBooks. This particular form is for the receipt of inventory with a bill,
but similar information is collected on the software program’s check, credit
card, and purchase order forms.
Figure 8-1:

120
Part III: Tracking Day-to-Day Operations with Your Books 

Notice that on the form in Figure 8-1, in addition to recording the name of the
vendor, date received, and payment amount, you also record details about
the items bought, including the quantity and cost. When you load each item
into the computerized accounting system, you can easily track cost detail
over time.
Figure 8-2 shows how you initially set up an inventory item in the computerized
accounting system. Note that in addition to the item name, two descriptions are
added to the system: One is an abbreviated version you can use on purchase
transactions, and the other is a longer description that shows on customer
invoices (sales transactions). You can input a cost and sales price if you want,
or you can leave them at zero and enter the cost and sales prices with each
transaction.
If you have a set contract purchase price or sales price on an inventory item,
it saves time to enter it on this form so you don’t have to enter the price each
time you record a transaction. But, if the prices change frequently, it’s best to
leave the space blank so you don’t forget to enter the updated price when
you enter a transaction.
Notice in Figure 8-2 that information about inventory on hand and when inven-
tory needs to be reordered can also be tracked using this form. To be sure
your store shelves are never empty, for each item you can enter a number that
indicates at what point you want to reorder inventory. In Figure 8-2, you can
indicate the “Reorder Point” in the section called “Inventory Information.” 
(A nice feature of QuickBooks is that it gives you an inventory reminder when
inventory reaches the reorder point.)

Chapter 8: Buying and Tracking Your Purchases

After you complete and save the form that records the receipt of inventory in
QuickBooks, the software automatically
 Adjusts the quantity of inventory you have in stock.
 Increases the asset account called Inventory.
 Lowers the quantity of items on order (if you initially entered the infor-
mation as a purchase order).
 Averages the cost of inventory on hand.
 Increases the Accounts Payable account.
Managing inventory and its value
After you record the receipt of inventory, you have the responsibility of man-
aging the inventory you have on hand. You also must know the value of that
inventory. You may think that as long as you know what you paid for the
items, the value isn’t difficult to calculate. Well, accountants can’t let it be
that simple, so there are actually five different ways to value inventory:
 LIFO (Last In, First Out): You assume that the last items put on the
shelves (the newest items) are the first items to be sold. Retail stores
that sell non-perishable items, such as tools, are likely to use this type of
system. For example, when a hardware store gets new hammers, work-
ers probably don’t unload what’s on the shelves and put the newest
items in the back. Instead, the new tools are just put in the front, so
they’re likely to be sold first.
 FIFO (First In, First Out): You assume that the first items put on the
shelves (the oldest items) are sold first. Stores that sell perishable
goods, such as food stores, use this inventory valuation method most
often. For example, when new milk arrives at a store, the person stock-
ing the shelves unloads the older milk, puts the new milk at the back
of the shelf, and then puts the older milk in front. Each carton of milk
(or other perishable item) has a date indicating the last day it can be
sold, so food stores always try to sell the oldest stuff first, while it’s still
sellable. (They try, but how many times have you reached to the back of
a food shelf to find items with the longest shelf life?)
 Averaging: You average the cost of goods received, so there’s no reason
to worry about which items are sold first or last. This method of inventory
is used most often in any retail or services environment where prices
are constantly fluctuating and the business owner finds that an average
cost works best for managing his Cost of Goods Sold.
 Specific Identification: You maintain cost figures for each inventory
item individually. Retail outlets that sell big-ticket items, such as cars,
which often have a different set of extras on each item, use this type of
inventory valuation method.
122
Part III: Tracking Day-to-Day Operations with Your Books 

 LCM (Lower of Cost or Market): You set inventory value based on
whichever is lower: the amount you paid originally for the inventory
item (its cost), or the current market value of the item. Companies that
deal in precious metals, commodities, or publicly traded securities often
use this method because the prices of their products can fluctuate
wildly, sometimes even in one day.
After you choose an inventory valuation method, you need to use the same
method each year on your financial reports and when you file your taxes. If
you decide you want to change the method, you need to explain the reasons
for the change to both the IRS and to your financial backers. If you’re running
a company that’s incorporated and has sold stock, you need to explain the
change to your stockholders. You also have to go back and show how the
change in inventory method impacts your prior financial reporting and adjust
your profit margins in previous years to reflect the new inventory valuation
method’s impact on your long-term profit history.
Figuring out the best method for you
I’m sure you’re wondering why it matters so much which inventory valuation
method you use. The key to the choice is the impact on your bottom line as
well as the taxes your company will pay.
FIFO, because it assumes the oldest (and most likely the lowest priced) items
are sold first, results in a low Cost of Goods Sold number. Because Cost of
Goods Sold is subtracted from sales to determine profit, a low Cost of Goods
Sold number produces a high profit. For more on Cost of Goods Sold, see
“Keeping Track of Inventory,” earlier in this chapter.
The opposite is true for LIFO, which uses cost figures based on the last price
paid for the inventory (and most likely the highest price). Using the LIFO
method, the Cost of Goods Sold number is high, which means a larger sum is
subtracted from sales to determine profit. Thus, the profit margin is low. The
good news, however, is that the tax bill is low, too.
The Averaging method gives a business the best picture of what’s happening
with inventory costs and trends. Rather than constantly dealing with the ups
and downs of inventory costs, this method smoothes out the numbers used
to calculate a business’s profits. Cost of Goods Sold, taxes, and profit margins
for this method fall between those of LIFO and FIFO. If you’re operating a
business in which inventory prices are constantly going up and down, this is
definitely the method you should choose.
The Averaging method always falls between LIFO and FIFO when it comes to
cost of goods sold, taxes, and profit margin.
123
Chapter 8: Buying and Tracking Your Purchases

QuickBooks uses the Averaging method to calculate Cost of Goods Sold and
Inventory line items on its financial reports, so if you choose this method,
you can use QuickBooks and the financial reports it generates. However, if
you choose to use one of the other four inventory methods, you can’t use the
QuickBooks financial report numbers. Instead, you have to print out a report
of purchases and calculate the accurate numbers to use on your financial
reports for the Cost of Goods Sold and Inventory accounts.
Check with your accountant to see which inventory method he or she thinks
is best for you given the type of business you’re operating.
Comparing the methods
To show you how much of an impact inventory valuation can have on profit
margin, in this section I compare three of the most common methods: FIFO,
LIFO, and Averaging. In this example, I assume Company A bought the inven-
tory in question at different prices on three different occasions. Beginning
Inventory is valued at $500 (that’s 50 items at $10 each).
Here’s the calculation for determining the number of items sold (see “Keeping
Track of Inventory”):
Beginning Inventory + Purchases = Goods available for sale – 
Ending inventory = Items sold
50 + 500 = 550 – 75 = 475
Here’s what the company paid to purchase the inventory:
Date
Quantity
Unit Price
April 1
150
$10
April 15
150
$25
April 30
200
$30
Here’s an example of how you calculate the Cost of Goods Sold using the
Averaging method:
Beginning Inventory 
50
$500
Purchases
150@$10
$1,500
150@$25
$3,750
200@$30
$6,000
Total Inventory
550
$11,750
Average Inventory Cost
$11,750 ÷ 550 = $21.36
Cost of Goods Sold
475 × $21.36 = $10,146
Ending Inventory
75@$21.36 = $1,602
124
Part III: Tracking Day-to-Day Operations with Your Books 

Remember, the Cost of Goods Sold number appears on the income statement
and is subtracted from Sales. The Ending Inventory number shows up as an
asset on the balance sheet. This is true for all three inventory valuation 
methods.
Here’s an example of how you calculate the Cost of Goods Sold using the FIFO
method. With this method, you assume that the first items received are the
first ones sold, and because the first items received here are those in
Beginning Inventory, I start with them:
Beginning Inventory
50@$10
$500
Next in – April 1
150@$10
$1,500
Then – April 15
150@$25
$3,750
Then – April 30
125@$30
$3,750
Cost of Goods Sold
475
$9,500
Ending Inventory 
75@$30
$2,250
Note: Only 125 of the 200 units purchased on April 30 are used in the FIFO
method. Because this method assumes that the first items into inventory are
the first items sold (or taken out of inventory), the first items used are those
on April 1. Then the April 15 items are used, and finally the remaining needed
items are taken from those bought on April 30. Because 200 were bought on
April 30 and only 125 were needed, 75 of the items bought on April 30 would
be the ones left in ending inventory.
Here’s an example of how you calculate the Cost of Goods Sold using the LIFO
method. With this method, you assume that the last items received are the
first ones sold, and because the last items received were those purchased on
April 30, I start with them:
April 30
200@$30
$6,000
Next April 15
150@$25
$3,750
Then April 1
125@$10
$1,250
Cost of Goods Sold
475
$11,000
Ending Inventory
75@$10
$750
Note: Because LIFO assumes the last items to arrive are sold first, the Ending
Inventory includes the 25 remaining units from the April 1 purchase plus the
50 units in Beginning Inventory.
125
Chapter 8: Buying and Tracking Your Purchases

Here’s how the use of inventory under the LIFO method impacts the company
profits. I assume the items are sold to the customers for $40 per unit, which
means total sales of $19,000 for the month (that’s $40 × 475 units sold). In this
example, I just look at the Gross Profit, which is the profit from Sales before
considering expenses incurred for operating the company. I talk more about
the different profit types and what they mean in Chapter 19. Gross Profit is
calculated by the following equation:
Sales – Cost of Goods Sold = Gross Profit
Table 8-1 shows a comparison of Gross Profit for the three methods used in
this example scenario.
Table 8-1
Comparison of Gross Profit Based 
on Inventory Valuation Method
Income Statement Line Item
FIFO
LIFO
Averaging
Sales
$19,000
$19,000
$19,000
Cost of Goods Sold
$9,500
$11,000
$10,146
Gross Profit
$9,500
$8,000
$8,854
Looking at the comparisons of gross profit, you can see that inventory valua-
tion can have a major impact on your bottom line. LIFO is likely to give you
the lowest profit because the last inventory items bought are usually the
most expensive. FIFO is likely to give you the highest profit because the first
items bought are usually the cheapest. And the profit produced by the
Averaging method is likely to fall somewhere in between the two.
Buying and Monitoring Supplies
In addition to inventory, all businesses must buy supplies that are used to
operate the business, such as paper, pens, and paper clips. Supplies that
aren’t bought in direct relationship to the manufacturing or purchasing of
goods or services for sale fall into the category of expenses.
When it comes to monitoring the supplies you use, just how closely you want
to watch things depends on your business needs. The expense categories you
establish may be as broad as “Office supplies” and “Retail supplies,” or you
may want to set up accounts for each type of supply used. Each additional
account is just one more thing that needs to be managed and monitored in
the accounting system, so determine whether it’s worth your time to keep a
very detailed record of supplies.
126
Part III: Tracking Day-to-Day Operations with Your Books 

Your best bet is to carefully track supplies that make a big dent in your budget
with an individual account. For example, if you anticipate paper usage will be
very high, monitor that usage with a separate account called “Paper expenses.”
Many companies don’t use the bookkeeping system to manage their supplies.
Instead, they designate one or two people as office managers or supply man-
agers and keep the number of accounts used for supplies to a minimum.
Other businesses decide they want to monitor supplies by department or
division and set up a supply account for each one. That puts the burden of
monitoring supplies in the hands of the department or division managers.
Staying on Top of Your Bills
Eventually, you have to pay for both the inventory and the supplies you pur-
chase for your business. In most cases, the bills are posted to the Accounts
Payable account when they arrive, and they’re paid when due. A large chunk of
the cash paid out of your Cash account (see Chapters 5 and 7 for more informa-
tion on the Cash account and handling cash) is in the form of the checks sent
out to pay bills due in Accounts Payable, so you need to have careful controls
over the five key functions of Accounts Payable:
 Entering the bills to be paid into the accounting system
 Preparing checks to pay the bills
 Signing checks to pay the bills
 Sending out payment checks to vendors
 Reconciling the checking account
In your business, it’s likely that the person who enters the bills to be paid into
the system also prepares the payment checks, but the other tasks should be
done by someone else. You should never allow the person who prepares the
check to review the bills to be paid and sign the checks, unless of course that
person’s you, the business owner. The person signing the checks should care-
fully review what’s being paid, verify that proper management approvals for
the payment are shown on that paperwork, and confirm that the amount
being paid is accurate. You should also separate responsibilities to be sure
that the person who reconciles your checking account isn’t preparing or sign-
ing checks. (I talk more cash control and the importance of separating duties
in Chapter 7.)
Properly managing Accounts Payable can save your company a lot of money by
avoiding late fees or interest and by taking advantage of discounts offered for
paying early. If you’re using a computerized accounting system, the bill due
date and any discount information should be entered at the time you receive
the inventory or supplies (see Figure 8-1 for how you record this information).
127
Chapter 8: Buying and Tracking Your Purchases

If you’re working with a paper system rather than a computerized accounting
system, you need to set up some way to be sure you don’t miss bill due
dates. Many companies use two accordion files: one that’s set up by the
month, and the other that’s set up by the day. When a bill first comes in, it’s
put into the first accordion file according to the month in which it’s due. On
the first day of that month, the Accounts Payable clerk pulls all the bills due
that month and puts them in the daily accordion file based on the date the
bill is due. Payment checks are then mailed in time to arrive in the vendor’s
office by the due date.
In some cases, companies offer a discount if their bills are paid early. As you
can see in Figure 8-1, the terms of the discount for the vendor, Plates Unlimited,
is “2% 10 Net 30.” That means that if the bill is paid in 10 days, the vendor
company can take a 2 percent discount; otherwise, the amount due must be
paid in full in 30 days. In addition, many companies state that interest or late
fees will be charged if a bill isn’t paid in 30 days.
The total amount due for the bill shown in Figure 8-1 is $1,000. If the company
pays the bill in ten days, it can take a 2 percent discount, or $20. That may
not seem like much, but if your company buys $100,000 of inventory and 
supplies in a month and each vendor offers a similar discount, you can save
$1,000. Over the course of a year, discounts on purchases can save your busi-
ness a significant amount of money and improve your profits.

E
very business loves to take in money, and that means you, the book-
keeper, have a lot to do to make sure sales are properly tracked and
recorded in the books. In addition to recording the sales themselves, you
must track customer accounts, discounts offered to customers, and cus-
tomer returns and allowances.
If the company sells products on store credit, you have to carefully monitor
customer accounts in Accounts Receivable, including monitoring whether
customers pay on time and alerting the sales team if customers are behind
on their bills and future purchases on credit need to be denied. Some cus-
tomers never pay, and in that case, you must adjust the books to reflect 
nonpayment as a bad debt.
This chapter reviews the basic responsibilities that fall to a business’s book-
keeping and accounting staff for tracking sales, making adjustments to those
sales, monitoring customer accounts, and alerting management to slow-
paying customers.

Collecting on Cash Sales
Most businesses collect some form of cash as payment for the goods or ser-
vices they sell. Cash receipts include more than just bills and coins; checks
and credit cards also are considered cash sales for the purpose of bookkeep-
ing. In fact, with electronic transaction processing (that’s when a customer’s
credit card is swiped through a machine), a deposit is usually made to the
business’s checking account the same day (sometimes within just seconds
of the transaction, depending on the type of system the business sets up with
the bank).
The only type of payment that doesn’t fall under the umbrella of a cash pay-
ment is purchases made on store credit. And by store credit, I mean credit
offered to customers directly by your business rather than through a third
party, such as a bank credit card or loan. I talk more about this type of sale in
the section “Selling on Credit,” later in this chapter.
Discovering the value of sales receipts
Modern businesses generate sales slips in one of three ways: by the cash reg-
ister, by the credit card machine, or by hand (written out by the salesperson).
Whichever of these three methods you choose to handle your sales transac-
tions, the sales receipt serves two purposes:
 Gives the customer proof that the item was purchased on a particular
day at a particular price in your store in case he needs to exchange or
return the merchandise.
 Gives the store a receipt that can be used at a later time to enter the trans-
action into the company’s books. At the end of the day, the receipts also
are used to prove out the cash register and ensure that the cashier has
taken in the right amount of cash based on the sales made. (In Chapter 7, 
I talk more about how cash receipts can be used as an internal control
tool to manage your cash.)
I’m sure you’re familiar with cash receipts, but just to show you how much
useable information can be generated for the bookkeeper on a sales receipt
here’s a sample receipt from a sale at a bakery:

You’ve probably never thought about how much bookkeeping information is
included on a sales receipt. Receipts contain a wealth of information that’s
collected for your company’s accounting system. A look at a receipt tells you
the amount of cash collected, the type of products sold, the quantity of prod-
ucts sold, and how much sales tax was collected.
Unless your company uses some type of computerized system at the point of
sale (which is usually the cash register) that’s integrated into the company’s
accounting system, sales information is collected throughout the day by the
cash register and printed out in a summary form at the end of the day. At that
point, you enter the details of the sales day in the books.
If you don’t use your computerized system to monitor inventory, you use the
data collected by the cash register to simply enter into the books the cash
received, total sales, and sales tax collected. Although in actuality, you’d
have many more sales and much higher numbers at the end of the day, here’s
what an entry in the Cash Receipts journal would look like for the receipt:
Debit
Credit
Cash in Checking
$84.80
Sales
$80.00
Sales Tax Collected
$4.80
Cash receipts for April 25, 2005
131
Chapter 9: Counting Your Sales

In this example entry, Cash in Checking is an asset account shown on the bal-
ance sheet (see Chapter 18 for more about balance sheets), and its value
increases with the debit. The Sales account is a revenue account on the
income statement (see Chapter 19 for more about income statements), and
its balanced increases with a Credit, showing additional revenue. (I talk more
about debits and credits in Chapter 2.) The Sales Tax Collected account is a
Liability account that appears on the balance sheet, and its balance increases
with this transaction.
Businesses pay sales tax to state and local government entities either monthly
or quarterly depending on rules set by the states, so your business must hold
the money owed in a liability account to be certain you’re able to pay the
taxes collected from customers when they’re due. I talk more about tax
reporting and payment in Chapter 21.
Recording cash transactions in the books
If you’re using a computerized accounting system, you can enter more detail
from the day’s receipts and track inventory sold as well. Most of the comput-
erized accounting systems do include the ability to track the sale of inventory.
Figure 9-1 shows you the QuickBooks Sales receipt form that you can use to
input data from each day’s sales.
Figure 9-1:
Example of
a sales
receipt in
QuickBooks.
132
Part III: Tracking Day-to-Day Operations with Your Books 

In addition to the information included in the Cash Receipts journal, note that
QuickBooks also collects information about the items sold in each transaction.
QuickBooks then automatically updates inventory information, reducing the
amount of inventory on hand when necessary. When the inventory number
falls below the reorder number you set (see Chapter 8), QuickBooks alerts you
to pass the word on to whoever is responsible for ordering to order more
inventory.
If the sales receipt in Figure 9-1 were for an individual customer, you’d enter
his or her name and address in the “Sold To” field. At the bottom of the
receipt, you can see a section asking whether you want to print or e-mail the
receipt; you can print the receipt and give it to the customer or e-mail it to
the customer if the order was made by phone or Internet. The bottom of the
receipt also has a place to mark whether or not the item should be charged
to a credit card. (For an additional fee, QuickBooks allows you to process
credit card receipts when saving an individual cash receipt.)
If your company accepts credit cards, expect sales revenue to be reduced by
the fees paid to credit-card companies. Usually, you face monthly fees as well
as fees per transaction; however, each company sets up individual arrange-
ments with its bank regarding these fees. Sales volume impacts how much
you pay in fees, so when researching bank services, be sure to compare
credit card transaction fees to find a good deal.
Selling on Credit
Many businesses decide to sell to customers on direct credit, meaning credit
offered by the business and not through a bank or credit card provider. This
approach offers more flexibility in the type of terms you can offer your cus-
tomers, and you don’t have to pay bank fees. However, it involves more work
for you, the bookkeeper, and more risk if a customer doesn’t pay what he or
she owes.
If you accept a customer’s bank-issued credit card for a sale and the cus-
tomer doesn’t pay the bill, you get your money, and the bank is responsible
for collecting from the customer and takes the loss if he or she doesn’t pay.
That’s not the case if you decide to offer credit to your customers directly. If
a customer doesn’t pay, your business takes the loss.
Deciding whether to offer store credit
The decision to set up your own store credit system depends on what your
competition is doing. For example, if you run an office supply store and all other
office supply stores allow store credit to make it easier for their customers to
get supplies, you probably need to offer store credit to stay competitive.
133
Chapter 9: Counting Your Sales

If you want to allow your customers to buy on store credit, the first thing you
need to do is set up some ground rules. You have to decide
 How you plan to check a customer’s credit history
 What the customer’s income level needs to be to be approved for credit
 How long you give the customer to pay the bill before charging interest
or late fees
The harder you make it to get store credit and the stricter you make the bill-
paying rules, the less chance you have of a taking a loss. However, you may
lose customers to a competitor with lighter credit rules. For example, you
may require a minimum income level of $50,000 and make customers pay in
30 days if they want to avoid late fees or interest charges. Your sales staff
reports that these rules are too rigid because your direct competitor down
the street allows credit on a minimum income level of $30,000 and gives cus-
tomers 60 days to pay before late fees and interest charges. Now you have to
decide whether you want to change your credit rules to match the competi-
tion’s. But, if you do lower your credit standards to match your competitor,
you could end up more customers who can’t pay on time or at all because
you’ve qualified customers for credit at lower income levels and given them
more time to pay. If you loosen your qualification criteria and bill-paying
requirements, you have to carefully monitor your customer accounts to be
sure they’re not falling behind.
The key risk you face is selling product for which you’re never paid. For
example, if you allow customers 30 days to pay and cut them off from buying
goods if their accounts falls more than 30 days behind, then the most you can
lose is the amount purchased over a two-month period (60 days). But if you
give customers more leniency, allow them 60 days to pay and cutting them off
after payment’s 30 days late, you’re faced with three months (90 days) of pur-
chases for which you may never be paid.
Recording store credit transactions 
in the books
When sales are made on store credit, you have to enter specific information
into the accounting system. In addition to inputting information regarding
cash receipts (see “Collecting on Cash Sales” earlier in this chapter), you
update the customer accounts to be sure each customer is billed and the
money is collected. You debit the Accounts Receivable account, an asset
account shown on the Balance Sheet (see Chapter 18), which shows money
due from customers.
Here’s how a journal entry of a sale made on store credit looks:

In addition to making this journal entry, you enter the information into the
customer’s account so that accurate bills can be sent out at the end of the
month. When the customer pays the bill, you update the individual customer’s
record to show that payment has been received and enter the following into
the bookkeeping records:
Debit

Accounts Receivable

Payment from S. Smith on invoice 123.
If you’re using QuickBooks, you enter purchases on store credit using an
invoice form like the one in Figure 9-2. Most of the information on the invoice
form is similar to the sales receipt form (see “Collecting on Cash Sales”), but
the invoice form also has space to enter a different address for shipping 
(the “Ship To” field) and includes payment terms (the “Terms” field). For the
sample invoice form shown in Figure 9-2, you can see that payment is due in
30 days.
Figure 9-2:

Chapter 9: Counting Your Sales

QuickBooks uses the information on the invoice form to update the following
accounts:
 Accounts Receivable
 Inventory
 The customer’s account
 Sales Tax Collected
Based on this data, when it comes time to bill the customer at the end of the
month, with a little prompting from you (see Figure 9-3), QuickBooks gener-
ates statements for all customers with outstanding invoices. You can easily
generate statements for specific customers or all customers on the books.
When you receive payment from a customer, here’s what happens:
1. You enter the customer’s name on the customer payment form (shown
in Figure 9-4).
2. QuickBooks automatically lists all outstanding invoices.
3. You select the invoice or invoices paid.
4. QuickBooks updates the Accounts Receivable account, the Cash
account, and the customer’s individual account to show that payment
has been received.

If your company uses a point of sale program that’s integrated into the com-
puterized accounting system, recording store credit transactions is even
easier for you. Sales details feed into the system as each sale is made, so you
don’t have to enter the detail at the end of day. These point of sale programs
save a lot of time, but they can get very expensive — usually at least $400 for
just one cash register.
Even if customers don’t buy on store credit, point of sale programs provide
businesses with an incredible amount of information about their customers
and what they like to buy. This data can be used in the future for direct mar-
keting and special sales to increase the likelihood of return business.
Proving Out the Cash Register
To ensure that cashiers don’t pocket a business’s cash, at the end of each
day, cashiers must prove out (show that they have the right amount of cash in
the register based on the sales transactions during the day) the amount of
cash, checks, and charges they took in during the day.
This process of proving out a cash register actually starts at the end of the
previous day, when cashier John Doe and his manager agree to the amount of
cash left in the John’s register drawer. Cash sitting in cash registers or cash
drawers is recorded as part of the Cash on Hand account.

Chapter 9: Counting Your Sales

When John comes to work the next morning, he starts out with the amount of
cash left in the drawer. At the end of the business day, either he or his man-
ager runs a summary of activity on the cash register for the day to produce a
report of the total sales taken in by the cashier. John counts the amount of
cash in his register as well as totals the checks, credit-card receipts, and
store credit charges. He then completes a cash-out form that looks something
like this:
Cash Register: John Doe

Store Credit Sales

A store manager reviews John Doe’s cash register summary (produced by the
actual register) and compares it to the cash-out form. If John’s ending cash
(the amount of cash remaining in the register) doesn’t match the cash-out
form, he and the manager try to pinpoint the mistake. If they can’t find a mis-
take, they fill out a cash-overage or cash-shortage form. Some businesses
charge the cashier directly for any shortages, while others take the position
that the cashier’s fired after a certain number of shortages of a certain dollar
amount (say, three shortages of more than $10).
The store manager decides how much cash to leave in the cash drawer or
register for the next day and deposits the remainder. He does this task for
each of his cashiers and then deposits all the cash and checks from the day
in a night deposit box at the bank. He sends a report with details of the deposit
to the bookkeeper so that the data makes it into the accounting system.
The bookkeeper enters the data on the Cash Receipts form (see Figure 9-1)
if a computerized accounting system is being used or into the Cash Receipts
journal if the books are being kept manually.
138
Part III: Tracking Day-to-Day Operations with Your Books 

Tracking Sales Discounts
Most business offer discounts at some point in time to generate more sales.
Discounts are usually in the form of a sale with 10 percent, 20 percent, or
even more off purchases.
When you offer discounts to customers, it’s a good idea to track your sales
discounts in a separate account so you can keep an eye on how much you
discount sales in each month. If you find you’re losing more and more money
to discounting, look closely at your pricing structure and competition to find
out why it’s necessary to frequently lower your prices in order to make sales.
You can track discount information very easily by using the data found on a
standard sales register receipt. The following receipt from a bakery includes
sales discount details.

From this example, you can see clearly that the stores take in less cash when
discounts are offered. When recording the sale in the Cash Receipts journal,
you record the discount as a debit. This debit increases the Sales Discount
account, which is subtracted from the Sales account to calculate the Net
Sales. (I walk you through all these steps and calculations when I discuss
preparing the income statement in Chapter 19.) Here is what the bakery’s
entry for this particular sale looks like in the Cash Receipts journal:
139

Credit
Cash in Checking
$76.32
Sales Discounts
$8.00

$80.00
Sales Tax Collected
$4.32
Cash receipts for April 25, 2005
If you use a computerized accounting system, add the sales discount as a line
item on the sales receipt or invoice, and the system automatically adjusts the
sales figures and updates your Sales Discount account.
Recording Sales Returns and Allowances
Most stores deal with sales returns on a regular basis. It’s common for cus-
tomers to return items they’ve purchased because the item is defective,
they’ve changed their minds, or for any other reason. Instituting a no-return
policy is guaranteed to produce very unhappy customers, so to maintain
good customer relations, you should allow sales returns.
Sales allowances (sales incentive programs) are becoming more popular with
businesses. Sales allowances are most often in the form of a gift card. A gift
card that’s sold is actually a liability for the company because the company
has received cash, but no merchandise has gone out. For that reason, gift
card sales are entered in a Gift Card liability account. When a customer
makes a purchase at a later date using the gift card, the Gift Card liability
account is reduced by the purchase amount. Monitoring the Gift Card liability
account allows businesses to keep track of how much is yet to be sold with-
out receiving additional cash.
Accepting sales returns can be a more complicated process than accepting
sales allowances. Usually, a business posts a set of rules for returns that may
include:
 Returns will only be allowed within 30 days of purchase.
 You must have a receipt to return an item.
 If you return an item without a receipt, you can receive only store credit.
You can set up whatever rules you want for returns. For internal control pur-
poses, the key to returns is monitoring how your staff handles them. In most
cases, you should require a manager’s approval on returns. Also, be sure
your staff pays close attention to how the customer originally paid for the
item being returned. You certainly don’t want to give a customer cash if she
140
Part III: Tracking Day-to-Day Operations with Your Books 

paid on store credit — that’s just handing over your money! After a return’s
approved, the cashier either returns the amount paid by cash or credit card.
Customers who bought the items on store credit don’t get any money back.
That’s because they didn’t pay anything when they purchased the item, but
expected to be billed later. Instead, a form is filled out so that the amount
of the original purchase can be subtracted from the customer’s store credit
account
You use the information collected by the cashier who handled the return to
input the sales return data into the books. For example, a customer returns
a $40 item that was purchased with cash. You record the cash refund in the
Cash Receipts Journal like this:
Debit
Credit
Sales Returns and Allowances
$40.00
Sales Taxes Collected @ 6%
$2.40
Cash in Checking
$42.40
To record return of purchase, 4/30/2005.
If the item had been bought with a discount, you’d list the discount as well
and adjust the price to show that discount.
In this journal entry,
 The Sales Returns and Allowances account increases. This account 
normally carries a debit balance and is subtracted from Sales when
preparing the income statement, thereby reducing revenue received
from customers.
 The debit to the Sales Tax Collected account reduces the amount in that
account because sales tax is no longer due on the purchase.
 The credit to the Cash in Checking account reduces the amount of cash
in that account.
Monitoring Accounts Receivable
Making sure customers pay their bills is a crucial responsibility of the book-
keeper. Before sending out the monthly bills, you should prepare an Aging
Summary Report that lists all customers who owe money to the company and
how old each debt is. If you keep the books manually, you collect the neces-
sary information from each customer account. If you keep the books in a
computerized accounting system, you can generate this report automatically.
Either way, your Aging Summary Report should look similar to this example
report from a bakery:
141
Chapter 9: Counting Your Sales

Aging Summary — As of May 1, 2005
Customer

H. Harris
$89.54
M. Man
$125.35
Totals
$173.86
$46.15
$65.78
$125.35
The Aging Summary quickly tells you which customers are behind in their
bills. In the case of this example, customers are cut off from future purchases
when their payments are more than 60 days late, so J. Doe and M. Man aren’t
able to buy on store credit until their bills are paid in full.
Give a copy of your Aging Summary to the sales manager so he can alert staff
to problem customers. He can also arrange for the appropriate collections
procedures. Each business sets up its own collections process, but usually it
starts with a phone call, followed by letters, and possibly even legal action, if
necessary.
Accepting Your Losses
You may encounter a situation in which your business never gets paid by a
customer, even after an aggressive collections process. In this case, you have
no choice but to write off the purchase as a bad debt and accept the loss.
Most businesses review their Aging Reports every six to 12 months and decide
which accounts need to be written off as bad debt. Accounts written off are
tracked in a General Ledger account called Bad Debt. (See Chapter 2 for more
information about the General Ledger.) The Bad Debt account appears as an
expense account on the income statement. When you write off a customer’s
account as bad debt, the Bad Debt account increases, and the Accounts
Receivable account decreases.
To give you an idea of how you write off an account, assume that one of your
customers never pays the $105.75 due. Here’s what your journal entry looks
like for this debt:
142
Part III: Tracking Day-to-Day Operations with Your Books

In a computerized accounting system, you enter the information using a cus-
tomer payment form and allocate the amount due to the Bad Debt expense
account.

Employee Payroll and Benefits
In This Chapter
 Hiring employees
 Collecting and depositing employee taxes
 Keeping track of benefits
 Preparing and recording payroll
 Finding new ways to deal with payroll responsibilities
U
nless your business has only one employee (you, the owner), you’ll
most likely hire employees, and that means you’ll have to pay them,
offer benefits, and manage a payroll.
Responsibilities for hiring and paying employees usually are shared between
the human resources staff and the bookkeeping staff. As the bookkeeper, you
must be sure that all government tax-related forms are completed and handle
all payroll responsibilities including paying employees, collecting and paying
employee taxes, collecting and managing employee benefit contributions,
and paying benefit providers. This chapter examines the various employee
staffing issues that bookkeepers need to be able to manage.
Staffing Your Business
After you decide that you want to hire employees for your business, you
must be ready to deal with a lot of government paperwork. In addition to
paperwork, you face with many decisions about how employees will be paid
and who will be responsible for maintaining the paperwork required by state,
local, and federal government entities.

Knowing what needs to be done to satisfy government bureaucracies isn’t the
only issue you must consider before the first person is hired; you also must
decide how frequently you will pay employees and what type of wage and
salary scales you want to set up.
Completing government forms
Even before you sign your first employee, you need to start filing government
forms related to hiring. If you plan to hire staff, you must first apply for an
Employer Identification Number, or EIN. Government entities use this number
to track your employees, the money you pay them, as well as any taxes col-
lected and paid on their behalf.
Before employees start working for you, they must fill out forms including
the W-4 (tax withholding form), I-9 (citizenship verification form), and W-5
(for employees eligible for the Earned Income Credit). The following sections
explain each of these forms as well as the EIN.
Employer Identification Number (EIN)
Every company must have an EIN to hire employees. If your company is incor-
porated (see Chapter 21 for the lowdown on corporations and other business
types), which means you’ve filed paperwork with the state and become a sep-
arate legal entity, you already have an EIN. Otherwise, to get an EIN you must
complete and submit Form SS-4, which you can see in Figure 10-1.
Luckily, the government offers four ways to submit the necessary information
and obtain an EIN. The fastest way is to call the IRS’s Business & Specialty
Tax Line at 800-829-4933 and complete the form by telephone. IRS officials
assign your EIN over the telephone. You can also apply online at www.irs.
gov, or you can download Form SS-4 at www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fss4.
pdf and submit it by fax or by mail.
In addition to tracking pay and taxes, state entities use the EIN number to
track the payment of unemployment taxes and workman’s compensation
taxes, both of which the employer must pay. I talk more about them in
Chapter 11.
W-4
Every person you hire must fill out a W-4 form called the “Employee’s
Withholding Allowance Certificate.” You’ve probably filled out a W-4 at least
once in your life, if you’ve ever worked for someone else. You can download
this form and make copies for your employees at www.irs.gov/pub/irs-
pdf/fw4.pdf.

147
Chapter 10: Employee Payroll and Benefits

This form, shown in Figure 10-2, tells you, the employer, how much to take
out of your employees’ paychecks in income taxes. On the W-4, employees
indicate whether they’re married or single. They can also claim additional
allowances if they have children or other major deductions that can reduce
their tax bills. The amount of income taxes you need to take out of each
employee’s check depends upon how many allowances he or she claimed on
the W-4.
It’s a good idea to ask an employee to fill out a W-4 immediately, but you can
allow him to take the form home if he wants to discuss allowances with his
spouse or accountant. If an employee doesn’t complete a W-4, you must take
income taxes out of his check based on the highest possible amount for that
person. I talk more about taking out taxes in the section “Collecting Employee
Taxes” later in this chapter.
An employee can always fill out a new W-4 to reflect life changes that impact
the tax deduction. For example, if the employee was single when he started
working for you and gets married a year later, he can fill out a new W-4 and
claim his spouse, lowering the amount of taxes that must be deducted from
his check. Another common life change that can reduce an employee’s tax
deduction is the birth or adoption of a baby.
I-9
All employers in the United States must verify that any person they intend 
to hire is a U.S. citizen or has the right to work in the United States. As an
employer, you verify this information by completing and keeping on file an I-9
form from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The new
Figure 10-2:

148
Part III: Tracking Day-to-Day Operations with Your Books 

hire fills out Section 1 of the form by providing information about his name
and address, birth history, Social Security number, and U.S. Citizenship or
work permit.
You then fill out Section 2, which requires you to check for and copy docu-
ments that establish identity and prove employment eligibility. For a new hire
who’s a U.S. citizen, you make a copy of one picture ID (usually a driver’s
license but maybe a military ID, student ID, or other state ID) and an ID that
proves work eligibility, such as a Social Security card, birth certificate, or 
citizen ID card. A U.S. passport can serve as both a picture ID and proof of
employment eligibility. Instructions provided with the form list all acceptable
documents you can use to verify work eligibility.
Figure 10-3 shows a sample I-9 form. You can download the form and its
instructions from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Web site
at www.uscis.gov/graphics/formsfee/forms/files/i-9.pdf.
W-5
Some employees you hire may be eligible for the Earned Income Credit (EIC),
which is a tax credit that refunds some of the money the employee would
otherwise pay in taxes such as Social Security or Medicare. In order to get
this credit, the employee must have a child and meet other income qualifica-
tions that are detailed on the form’s instructions.
The government started the EIC credit, which reduces the amount of tax
owed, to help lower-income people offset increases in living expenses and
Social Security taxes. Having an employee complete Form W-5, shown in
Figure 10-4, allows you to advance the expected savings of the EIC to the
employee on his paycheck each pay period rather than make him wait to get
the money back at the end of the year after filing tax forms. The advance
amount isn’t considered income, so you don’t need to take taxes out on
this amount.
As an employer, you aren’t required to verify an employee’s eligibility for the
EIC tax credit. The eligible employee must complete a W-5 each year to indi-
cate that he still qualifies for the credit. If the employee does not file the form
with you, you can’t advance any money to the employee. If an employee qual-
ifies for the EIC, you calculate his paycheck the same as you would any other
employee’s paycheck, deducting all necessary taxes to get the employee’s net
pay. Then you add back in the EIC advance credit that’s allowed.
Any advance money you pay to the employee can be subtracted from the
employee taxes you owe to the government. For example, if you’ve taken out
$10,000 from employees’ checks to pay their income, Social Security taxes,
and Medicare taxes and then returned $500 to employees who qualified for
the EIC, you subtract that $500 from the $10,000 and pay the government only
$9,500.

Part III: Tracking Day-to-Day Operations with Your Books 

Picking pay periods
Deciding how frequently you’ll pay employees is an important point to work
out before hiring staff. Most businesses chose one or more of these four pay
periods:
 Weekly: Employees are paid every week, and payroll must be done
52 times a year.
 Biweekly: Employees are paid every two weeks, and payroll must be
done 26 times a year.
 Semimonthly: Employees are paid twice a month, commonly on the 15th
and last day of the month, and payroll must be done 24 times a year.
 Monthly: Employees are paid once a month, and payroll must be done
12 times a year.
You can choose to use any of these pay periods, and you may even decide
to use more than one type. For example, some companies will pay hourly
employees (employees paid by the hour) weekly or biweekly and pay
salaried employees (employees paid by a set salary regardless of how many
hours they work) semimonthly or monthly. Whatever your choice, decide on
a consistent pay period policy and be sure to make it clear to employees
when they’re hired.

Chapter 10: Employee Payroll and Benefits

Determining wage and salary types
You have a lot of leeway regarding the level of wages and salary you pay your
employees, but you still have to follow the rules laid out by the U.S. Department
of Labor. When deciding on wages and salaries, you have to first categorize
your employees. Employees fall into one of two categories:
 Exempt employees are exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act
(FLSA), which sets rules for minimum wage, equal pay, overtime pay,
and child labor laws. Executives, administrative personnel, managers,
professionals, computer specialists, and outside salespeople can all be
exempt employees. They’re normally paid a certain amount per pay
period with no connection to the number of hours worked. Often,
exempt employees work well over 40 hours per week without extra pay.
Prior to new rules from the Department of Labor effective in 2004, only
high-paid employees fell in this category; today, however, employees
making as little as $23,600 can be placed in the exempt category.
 Nonexempt employees must be hired according to rules of the FLSA,
meaning that companies with gross sales of over $500,000 per year must
pay a minimum wage per hour of $5.15. Smaller companies with gross
sales under $500,000 can pay a minimum that’s slightly less — $4.90 per
hour. For new employees who are under the age of 20 and need training,
an employer can pay as little as $4.25 for the first 90 days. Also, any
nonexempt employee who works over 40 hours in a seven-day period
must be paid time and one-half for the additional hours. Minimum wage
doesn’t have to be paid in cash. The employer can pay some or all of the
wage in room and board provided it doesn’t make a profit on any non-
cash payments. Also, the employer can’t charge the employee to use its
facilities if the employee’s use of a facility is primarily for the employer’s
benefit.
The federal government hasn’t adjusted the minimum wage law since 1997.
Some states decided that was too long and subsequently passed higher mini-
mum wage laws, so be sure to check with your state department of labor to be
certain you’re meeting state wage guidelines.
152
Part III: Tracking Day-to-Day Operations with Your Books 
Keeping time with time sheets
For each employee who’s paid hourly, you need
to have some sort of time sheet to keep track 
of work hours. These time sheets are usually
completed by the employees and approved by
their managers. Completed and approved time
sheets are then sent to the bookkeeper so that
checks can be calculated based on the exact
number of hours worked.

If you plan to hire employees who are under the age of 18, you must pay
attention to child labor laws. Federal and state laws restrict what kind of
work children can do, when they can do it, and how old they have to be to
do it, so be sure you become familiar with the laws before hiring employees
who are younger than 18. For minors below the age of 16, work restrictions
are even tighter than for teens aged 16 and 17. (You can hire your own child
without worrying about these restrictions.)
You can get a good summary of all labor laws at the Business Owner’s Toolkit
online at www.toolkit.cch.com/text/p05_4037.asp.
Collecting Employee Taxes
In addition to following wage and salary guidelines set for your business,
when calculating payroll, you, the bookkeeper, must also be familiar with how
to calculate the employee taxes that must be deducted from each employee’s
paycheck. These taxes include Social Security; Medicare; and federal, state,
and local withholding taxes.
153
Chapter 10: Employee Payroll and Benefits
Exempt or nonexempt
You’re probably wondering how to determine
whether to hire exempt or nonexempt employ-
ees. Of course, most businesses would prefer
to exempt all their employees from the overtime
laws. You don’t have a choice if your employees
earn less than $23,660 per year or $455 per
week. All employees lower than this earning
range must be paid overtime if they work more
than 40 hours in a week. These employees are
nonexempt employees — in other words, not
exempt from the Fair Labor Practices Act, which
governs who must be paid overtime.
You have more flexibility with employees earn-
ing more than $23,660 per year. You can clas-
sify employees who work as executives, 
administrative personnel, professionals, com-
puter specialists, and outside salespeople 
as exempt. Also those who perform office or
nonmanual work earning over $100,000 per year
can be exempt. Blue-collar workers in manual 
labor positions cannot be exempt employees
and must be paid overtime. Also police, fire
fighters, paramedics, and other first responders
cannot be exempt employees and must be 
paid overtime.
For more details about who can be designated
an exempt employee, visit the U.S. Department
of Labor’s website at www.dol.gov/esa/
regs/compliance/whd/fairpay/main.
htm.

Sorting out Social Security tax
Employers and employees share the Social Security tax equally: Each must
pay 6.2 percent (0.062) toward Social Security up to a cap of $90,000 per year
per person (as of this writing). After an employee earns $90,000, no additional
Social Security taxes are taken out of his check. The federal government
adjusts the cap each year based on salary level changes in the marketplace.
Essentially, the cap gradually increases as salaries increase.
The calculation for Social Security taxes is relatively simple. For example, for
an employee who makes $1,000 per pay period, you calculate Social Security
tax this way:
$1,000 × 0.062 = $62
The bookkeeper deducts $62 from this employee’s gross pay, and the com-
pany pays the employer’s share of $62. Thus, the total amount submitted in
Social Security taxes for this employee is $124.
Making sense of Medicare tax
Employees and employers also share Medicare taxes, which are 1.45 percent
each. However, unlike Social Security taxes, the federal government places no
cap on the amount that must be paid in Medicare taxes. So even if someone
makes $1 million per year, 1.45 percent is calculated for each pay period and
paid by both the employee and the employer. Here’s an example of how you
calculate the Medicare tax for an employee who makes $1,000 per pay period:
$1,000 × 0.0145 = $14.50
The bookkeeper deducts $14.50 from this employee’s gross pay, and the com-
pany pays the employer’s share of $14.50. Thus, the total amount submitted
in Medicare taxes for this employee is $29.
Figuring out federal withholding tax
Deducting federal withholding taxes is a much more complex task for book-
keepers than deducting Social Security or Medicare taxes. You not only have to
worry about an employee’s tax rate, but you also must consider the number of
withholding allowances the employee claimed on her W-4 and whether she’s
married or single. Under the 2003 tax law still in effect as of this writing, the
first $7,000 of an unmarried person’s income (the first $14,000 for a married
couple) is taxed at 10 percent. Other tax rates depending on income are 15 per-
cent, 25 percent, 28 percent, 33 percent, and 35 percent.

Part III: Tracking Day-to-Day Operations with Your Books 

Trying to figure out taxes separately for each employee based on his or her
tax rate and number of allowances would be an extremely time-consuming
task, but luckily, you don’t have to do that. The IRS publishes tax tables in
Publication 15, “Employer’s Tax Guide,” that let you just look up an employee’s
tax obligation based on the taxable salary and withholdings. You can access
the IRS Employer’s Tax Guide online at www.irs.gov/publications/p15/
index.html. You can find tables for calculating withholding taxes at www.irs.
gov/publications/p15/ar03.html.
The IRS’s tax tables give you detailed numbers up to 10 withholding
allowances. Table 10-1 shows a sample tax table with only seven allowances
because of space limitations. But even with seven allowances, you get the
idea — just match the employee’s wage range up with the number of
allowance her or she claims, and the box where they meet contains that the
amount of that employee’s tax obligation. For example, if you’re preparing a
paycheck for an employee whose taxable income is $1,000 per pay period,
and he claims three withholding allowances — one for himself, one for his
wife, and one for his children — then the amount of federal income taxes you
deduct from his pay is $148.

Chapter 10: Employee Payroll and Benefits

Settling up state and local 
withholding taxes
In addition to the federal government, most states have income taxes, and
some cities even have local income taxes. You can find all state tax rates and
forms online at www.payroll-taxes.com. If your state or city has income
taxes, they need to be taken out of each employee’s paycheck.
Determining Net Pay
Net pay is the amount a person is paid after subtracting all tax and benefit
deductions. In other words after all deductions are subtracted from a
person’s gross pay, you are left with the net pay.
After you figure out all the necessary taxes to be taken from an employee’s
paycheck, you can calculate the check amount. Here’s the equation and an
example of how you calculate the net pay amount:
Gross pay – (Social Security + Medicare + Federal withholding tax + State
withholding tax + Local withholding tax) = Net pay
1,000 – (62 + 14.50 + 148 + 45 + 0) = 730.50
This net pay calculation doesn’t include any deductions for benefits. Many
businesses offer their employees health, retirement, and other benefits but
expect the employees to share a portion of those costs. The fact that some of
these benefits are tax deductible and some are not makes a difference in when
you deduct the benefit costs. If an employee’s benefits are tax deductible and
taken out of the check before federal withholding taxes are calculated, the fed-
eral tax rate may be lower than if the benefits were deducted after calculating
federal withholding taxes. Many states follow the federal government’s lead on
tax deductible benefits, so the amount deducted for state taxes will be lower
as well. For example, the federal government allows employers to consider
health insurance premiums as nontaxable, so the states do so also.
Surveying Your Benefits Options
Benefits include programs that you provide their employees to better their
life, such as health insurance and retirement savings opportunities. Most
benefits are tax-exempt, which means that the employee isn’t taxed for them.
However, some benefits are taxable, so the employee has to pay taxes on the
money or the value of the benefits received. This section reviews the differ-
ent tax-exempt and taxable benefits you can offer your employees.
156
Part III: Tracking Day-to-Day Operations with Your Books 

Tax-exempt benefits
Most benefits are tax-exempt, or not taxed. Health care and retirement bene-
fits are the most common of this type of benefit. In fact, accident and health
benefits and retirement benefits make up the largest share of employers’
pay toward employees’ benefits. Luckily, not only are these benefits tax-
exempt, but anything an employee pays toward them can be deducted from
the gross pay, so the employee doesn’t have to pay taxes on that part of his
salary or wage.
For example, if an employee’s share of health insurance is $50 per pay period
and he makes $1,000 per pay period, his taxable income is actually $1,000
minus the $50 health insurance premium contribution, or $950. As the book-
keeper, you calculate taxes in this situation on $950 rather than $1,000.
The money that an employee who contributes to the retirement plan you
offer is tax deductible, too. For example, if an employee contributes $50 per
pay period to your company’s 401(k) retirement plan, that $50 can also be
subtracted from the employee’s gross pay before you calculate net pay. So if
an employee contributes $50 to both health insurance and retirement, the
$1,000 taxable pay is reduced to only $900 taxable pay. (According to the tax
table for that pay level, his federal withholding taxes are only $123, a savings
of $25 over a taxable income of $1,000, or 25 percent of his health and retire-
ment costs. Not bad.)
You can offer a myriad of other tax-exempt benefits to employees, as well,
including:
 Adoption assistance: You can provide up to $10,160 per child that an
employee plans to adopt without having to include that amount in gross
income for the purposes of calculating federal withholding taxes. The
value of this benefit must be included when calculating Social Security
and Medicare taxes, however.
 Athletic facilities: You can offer your employees the use of a gym on
premises your company owns or leases without having to include the
value of the gym facilities in gross pay. In order for this benefit to qualify
as tax-exempt, the facility must be operated by the company primarily
for the use of employees, their spouses, and their dependent children.
 Dependent care assistance: You can help your employees with depen-
dent care expenses, which can include children and elderly parents, 
provided you offer the benefit in order to make it possible for the
employee to work.
 Education assistance: You can pay employees’ educational expenses up
to $5,250 without having to include that payment in gross income.
157
Chapter 10: Employee Payroll and Benefits

 Employee discounts: You can offer employees discounts on the com-
pany’s products without including the value of the discounts in their
gross pay, provided the discount is not more than 20 percent less than
what’s charged to customers. If you only offer this discount to high-paid
employees, then the value of these discounts must be included in gross
pay of those employees.
 Group term life insurance: You can provide group term life insurance
up to a coverage level of $50,000 to your employees without including
the value of this insurance in their gross pay. Premiums for coverage
above $50,000 must be added to calculations for Social Security and
Medicare taxes.
 Meals: Meals that have little value (such as coffee and doughnuts) don’t
have to be reported as taxable income. Also, occasional meals brought in
so employees can work late also don’t have to be reported in employees’
income.
 Moving expense reimbursements: If you pay moving expenses for
employees, you don’t have to report these reimbursements as employee
income as long as the reimbursements are for items that would qualify
as tax-deductible moving expenses on an employee’s individual tax
return. Employees who have been reimbursed by their employers can’t
deduct the moving expenses for which the employer paid.
Taxable benefits
You may decide to provide some benefits that are taxable. These include the
personal use of a company automobile, life insurance premiums for coverage
over $50,000, and benefits that exceed allowable maximums. For example, if
you pay $10,250 toward an employee’s education expenses, then $5,000 of
that amount must be reported as income because the federal government’s
cap is $5,250.
Dealing with cafeteria plans
When I mention cafeteria plans, I’m not talking about offering a lunch spot for
your employees. Cafeteria plans are benefit plans that offer employees a
choice of benefits based on cost. Employees can pick and choose from those
benefits and put together a benefit package that works best for them within
the established cost structure.
Cafeteria plans are becoming more popular among larger businesses, but not
all employers decide to offer their benefits this way. Primarily, this decision is
because managing a cafeteria plan can be much more time consuming for the
158
Part III: Tracking Day-to-Day Operations with Your Books 

bookkeeping and human resources staff. Many small business employers that
do choose to offer a cafeteria plan for benefits do so by outsourcing benefit
management services to an outside company that specializes in managing
cafeteria plans.
For example, a company tells its employees that it will pay up to $5,000 in
benefits per year and values its benefit offerings this way:
Health insurance
$4,600
Retirement
$1,200
Child care
$1,200
Life insurance
$800
Joe, an employee, then picks from the list of benefits until he reaches $5,000.
If Joe wants more than $5,000 in benefits, he pays for the additional benefits
with a reduction in his paycheck.
The list of possible benefits could be considerably longer, but in this case, if
Joe chooses health insurance, retirement, and life insurance, the total cost is
$6,600. Because the company pays up to $5,000, Joe needs to copay $1,600, a
portion of which is taken out in each paycheck. If Joe gets paid every two
weeks for a total of 26 paychecks per year, the deduction for benefits from his
gross pay is $61.54 ($1,600 ÷ 26).
Preparing Payroll and Posting It 
in the Books
Once you know the details about your employees’ withholding allowances
and their benefit costs, you can then calculate the final payroll and post it to
the books.
Calculating payroll for hourly employees
When you’re ready to prepare payroll for nonexempt employees, the first
thing you need to do is collect time records from each person being paid
hourly. Some companies use time clocks, and some use time sheets to pro-
duce the required time records, but whatever the method used, usually the
manager of each department reviews the time records for each employee he
supervises and then sends those time records to you, the bookkeeper.
159
Chapter 10: Employee Payroll and Benefits

With time records in hand, you have to calculate gross pay for each employee.
For example, if a nonexempt employee worked 45 hours and is paid $12 an
hour, you calculate gross pay like so:
40 regular hours × $12 per hour = $480
5 overtime hours × $12 per hour × 1.5 overtime rate = $90
$480 + $90 = $570
In this case, because the employee isn’t exempt from the FLSA (see
“Determining wage and salary types” earlier in this chapter), overtime
must be paid for any hours worked over 40 in a seven-day workweek.
This employee worked five hours more than the 40 hours allowed, so he
needs to be paid at time plus one-half.
Doling out funds to salaried employees
In addition to employees paid based on hourly wages, you also must prepare
payroll for salaried employees. Paychecks for salaried employees are rela-
tively easy to calculate — all you need to know are their base salaries and
their pay period calculations. For example, if a salaried employee makes
$30,000 per year and is paid twice a month (totaling 24 pay periods), that
employee’s gross pay is be $1,250 for each pay period.
Totaling up for commission checks
Running payroll for employees paid based on commission can involve the
most complex calculations. To show you a number of variables, in this sec-
tion I calculate a commission check based on a salesperson who sells $60,000
worth of products during one month.
For a salesperson on a straight commission of 10 percent, you calculate pay
using this formula:
Total amount sold × Commission percentage = Gross pay
$60,000 × 0.10 = $6,000
For a salesperson with a guaranteed base salary of $2,000 plus an additional 
5 percent commission on all products sold, you calculate pay using this 
formula:
160
Part III: Tracking Day-to-Day Operations with Your Books 

Base salary + (Total amount sold × Commission percentage) = Gross pay
$2,000 + ($60,000 × 0.05) = $5,000
Although this employee may be happier having a base salary he can count on
each month, he actually makes less with a base salary because the commis-
sion rate is so much lower. By selling $60,000 worth of products he made only
$3,000 in commission at 5 percent. Without the base pay, he would have
made 10 percent on the $60,000 or $6,000, so he actually got paid $1,000 with
a base pay structure that includes a lower commission pay rate.
If he has a slow sales month of just $30,000 worth of products sold, his pay
would be:
$30,000 × 0.10 = $3,000 on straight commission of 10 percent
and
$30,000 × 0.05 = $1,500 plus $2,000 base salary, or $3,500
For a slow month, the sales person would make more money with the base
salary rather than the higher commission rate.
There are many other ways to calculate commissions. One common way is to
offer higher commissions on higher levels of sales. Using the figures in this
example, this type of pay system encourages salespeople to keep their sales
levels over $30,000 to get the best commission rate.
With a graduated commission scale, a salesperson can make a straight com-
mission of 5 percent on his first $10,000 in sales, then 7 percent on his next
$20,000, and finally 10 percent on anything over $30,000. Here’s what his
gross pay calculation looks like using this commission pay scale:
($10,000 × 0.05) + ($20,000 × 0.07) + ($30,000 × 0.10) = $4,900 Gross pay
One other type of commission pay system involves a base salary plus tips.
This method is common in restaurant settings in which servers receive
between $2.50 and $5 per hour plus tips.
Businesses that pay less than minimum wage must prove that their employ-
ees make at least minimum wage when tips are accounted for. Today, that’s
relatively easy to prove because most people pay their bills with credit cards
and include tips on their bills. Businesses can then come up with an average
tip rate using that credit card data.
161
Chapter 10: Employee Payroll and Benefits

Employees must report tips to their employers on an IRS Form 4070, Employee’s
Report of Tips to Employer, which is part of IRS Publication 1244, Employees
Daily Record of Tips and Report to Employer. If your employees receive tips
and you want to supply the necessary paperwork, you can download it at
www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p1244.pdf. The publication provides details
about what the IRS expects you and your employees to do if they work in an
environment where tipping is common.
As an employer, you must report an employee’s gross taxable wages based
on salary plus tips. Here’s how you calculate gross taxable wages for an
employee whose earnings are based on tips and wages:
Base wage + Tips = Gross taxable wages
($3 × 40 hours per week) + $300 = $420
If your employees are paid using a combination of base wage plus tips, you
must be sure that your employees are earning at least the minimum wage
rate of $5.15 per hour. Checking this employee’s gross wages, the hourly rate
earned is $10.50 per hour.
Hourly wage = $10.50 ($420 ÷ 40)
Taxes due are calculated on the base wage plus tips, so the check you prepare
for the employee in this example is for the base wage minus any taxes due.
After calculating paychecks for all your employees, you prepare the payroll,
make up the checks, and post the payroll to the books. In addition to Cash,
many accounts are impacted by payroll, including:
 Accrued Federal Withholding Payable, which is where you record the
liability for future federal tax payments.
 Accrued State Withholding Payable, which is where you record the lia-
bility for future state tax payments.
 Accrued Employee Medical Insurance Payable, which is where you
record the liability for future medical insurance premiums.
 Accrued Employee Elective Insurance Payable, which is where you
record the liability for miscellaneous insurance premiums, such as life
or accident insurance.
When you post the payroll entry, you indicate the withdrawal of money from
the Cash account as well as record liabilities for future cash payments that will
be due for taxes and insurance payments. Just for the purposes of giving you
an example of the proper setup for a payroll journal entry, I assume the total
payroll is $10,000 with $1,000 set aside for each type of withholding payable.
In reality, your numbers will be much different, and I doubt your payables will
ever all be the same. Here’s what your journal entry for posting payroll should
look like:
162

In this entry, you increase the expense account for salaries and wages as 
well as all the accounts in which you accrue future obligations for taxes and
employee insurance payments. You decrease the amount of the Cash account;
when cash payments are made for the taxes and insurance payments in the
future, you post those payments in the books. Here’s an example of the entry
you would post to the books after making the federal withholding tax payment:

Depositing Employee Taxes
Any taxes collected on behalf of employees must be deposited in a financial
institution authorized to collect those payments for the government or in the
Federal Reserve Bank in your area. Most major banks are authorized to collect
these deposits; check with your bank to see if it is or to get a recommenda-
tion of a bank you can use. Figure 10-5 shows you IRS Form 8109, Federal Tax
Deposit (FTD) Coupon, which is the coupon businesses use to deposit taxes.
You can’t get a copy of this form online; it’s only available from the IRS or a
bank that handles your deposits.
163
Chapter 10: Employee Payroll and Benefits

As you can see from the figure, this form can be used to deposit many differ-
ent kinds of federal payments, including:
 Form 941, Employer’s Quarterly Federal Tax Return (includes federal with-
holding taxes, Social Security taxes, and Medicare taxes)
 Form 990-C, Farmer’s Cooperative Association Income Tax Return
 Form 943, Employer’s Annual Federal Tax Return for Agricultural
Employees
 Form 720, Quarterly Federal Excise Tax Return (specific to aviation 
industry)
 Form CT-1, Employer’s Annual Railroad Retirement Tax Return
 Form 940, Employer’s Annual Federal Unemployment (FUTA) Tax Return
 Form 945, Annual Return of Withheld Federal Income Tax
 Form 1120, U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return
 Form 990-T, Exempt Organization Business Income Tax Return
 Form 990-PF, Return of Private Foundation
 Form 1042, Annual Withholding Tax Return for U.S. Source Income of
Foreign Persons
When depositing funds using Form 8109 (the coupon shown in Figure 10-5),
be sure to include the EIN and name of the company on the coupon as well as
check off the form number related to the payment. The IRS tracks payments
by EIN number and form number filed.

For the purposes of tax payments collected from employees for the federal
government, you must complete Form 941, which is shown in Figure 10-6.
This form summarizes the tax payments made on behalf of employees. You
can get instructions and Form 941 online at www.irs.gov/instructions/

in Chapter 11.)

Chapter 10: Employee Payroll and Benefits

During the first year as an employer, the company will have to make monthly
deposits of employee taxes. Monthly payments must be made by the 15th
day of the month following when the taxes were taken. For example, taxes
collected from employees in April must be paid by May 15. If the date the
deposit is due falls on a weekend or bank holiday, the payment is due on the
next day the banks are open.
Figure 10-6b:
Form 941
(continued)
166
Part III: Tracking Day-to-Day Operations with Your Books 

As your business gets larger, you’ll need to make more frequent deposits.
Large employers that accumulate taxes of $100,000 or more in a day must
deposit the funds on the next banking day.
You can also make employee tax payments electronically using the Electronic
Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS). Employers who make payments of
more than $200,000 in any tax year must deposit funds using the EFTPS
system. Otherwise, use of the electronic system is voluntary.
Outsourcing Payroll and Benefits Work
Given all that’s required of you to prepare payroll, you may think that it’s a
good idea for your small company to outsource the work of payroll and bene-
fits. I don’t disagree. Many companies outsource the work because it’s such a
specialized area and requires extensive software to manage both payroll and
benefits.
If you don’t want to take on payroll and benefits, you can also pay for a
monthly payroll service from the software company that provides your
accounting software. For example, QuickBooks provides various levels of
payroll services for as low as $17 a month up to $100 per month depending
on the services you require. The QuickBooks payroll features include calcu-
lating earnings and deductions, printing checks or making direct deposits,
providing updates to the tax tables, and supplying data need to complete all
government forms related to payroll. The advantage of doing payroll in-house
in this manner is that the payroll can then be more easily integrated into the
company’s books.

Employer-Paid Taxes and

In This Chapter
 Tallying up the employer’s share of Social Security and Medicare
 Filing and paying unemployment taxes
 Figuring out workman’s compensation
 Keeping accurate employee records
You may think that employees will make your job as a business owner
easier, I’m afraid you’re wrong on that one. It’s really a mixed bag. While
employees help you keep your business operating and enable you to grow,
they also add a lot of government paperwork. 
After your company hires employees, you need to complete regular reports
for the government regarding the taxes you must pay toward the employees’
Social Security and Medicare, as well as unemployment taxes. In every state
except Texas, employers also are required to buy workman’s compensation
insurance based on employees’ salary and wages.
This chapter reviews the federal, state, and local government reporting
requirements for employers as well as the records you, the bookkeeper, 
must keep in order to complete these reports. You also find out how to calcu-
late the various employee taxes and how to buy workman’s compensation
insurance.
In Chapter 10, I show you how to calculate the employee side of Social Security
and Medicare taxes. This chapter looks at the employer side of these taxes,
as well as other employer-paid government taxes.

Paying Employer Taxes on Social Security
and Medicare
In the United States, both employers and employees must contribute to the
Social Security and Medicare systems. In fact, employers share equally with
employees the tax obligation for both Social Security and Medicare.
As I discuss in greater detail in Chapter 10, the employer and the employee each
must pay 6.2 percent of an employee’s compensation for Social Security up to
a salary of $90,000 in 2005. The percentage paid toward Medicare is 1.45 per-
cent for both the employer and employee. There is no salary cap related to the
amount that must be paid toward Medicare, so even if your employee makes
$1 million (don’t you wish your business was that successful?), you still must
pay Medicare taxes on that amount.
When you finish calculating payroll checks, you calculate the employer’s por-
tion of Social Security and Medicare. When you post the payroll to the books,
the employer’s portion of Social Security and Medicare are set aside in an
accrual account.
Filing Form 941
Each quarter you must file federal Form 941, Employer’s Federal Tax Return,
which details the number of employees that received wages, tips, or other
compensation for the quarter. In Chapter 10, you can see what the form looks
like. Below Table 11-1 tells what months are reported during each quarter
and when the report is due:

170
Part III: Tracking Day-to-Day Operations with Your Books 

Form 941 was revised for 2005, so be sure you’re using the newest version,
the one dated 2005. The new form requires more detail than older versions,
so you definitely don’t want to be working from an old form or you could find
yourself in big trouble.
The following key information must be included on Form 941:
 Number of employees who received wages, tips, or other compensation
in the pay period
 Total of wages, tips, and other compensation paid to employees
 Total tax withheld from wages, tips, and other compensation
 Taxable Social Security and Medicare wages
 Total paid out to employees in sick pay
 Adjustments for tips and group-term life insurance
 Amount of income tax withholding
 Advance earned income credit payments made to employees (see
Chapter 10 for an explanation)
 Amount of tax liability per month
Knowing how often to file
As an employer, you file Form 941 on a quarterly basis, but you probably
have to pay taxes more frequently. Most new employers start out making
monthly deposits for taxes due using Form 8109 (shown in Chapter 10),
which is a payment coupon that your company can get from a bank approved
to collect that money or from the Federal Reserve branch near you. Others
make deposits online using the IRS’s Electronic Federal Tax Payment System
(EFTPS). For more information on EFTPS, go to www.eftps.gov.
Employers on a monthly payment schedule (usually small companies) must
deposit all employment taxes due by the 15th day of the following month. For
example, the taxes for the payroll in April must be paid by May 15th. Larger
employers must pay taxes more frequently. For example, employers whose
businesses accumulate $100,000 or more in taxes due on any day during a
deposit period must deposit those taxes on the next banking day. If you hit
$100,000 due when you’re a monthly depositor, you must start paying taxes
semiweekly for at least the remainder of the current tax year.
171
Chapter 11: Employer-Paid Taxes and Government Payroll Reporting

After you become a semiweekly payer, you must deposit your taxes on
Wednesday or Friday, depending on your payday:
 If you pay employees on Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday, you must
deposit the taxes due by the next Wednesday.
 If you pay employees on Saturday, Sunday, Monday, or Tuesday, you
must deposit the taxes due by the next Friday.
Still larger employers, that is, those with tax payments due of $200,000 or
more, must deposit these taxes electronically using EFTPS according to the
semiweekly payment schedule. Electronic tax payments for employers with
tax payments under $200,000 are voluntary.
However you’re required to pay your payroll-based taxes, one thing you 
definitely don’t want to do is underpay. Interest and penalty charges for late
payment can make your tax bite even higher — and I’m sure you’re convinced
it’s high enough already. If you find it hard to accurately estimate your quar-
terly tax payment, your best bet is to pay a slightly higher amount in the first
and second month of a quarter. Then, if you’ve paid a bit more than needed,
you can cut back the payment for the third month of the quarter. This strat-
egy lets you avoid the possibility of underpaying in the first two months of a
quarter and risking interest and penalty charges.
Completing Unemployment Reports and
Paying Unemployment Taxes
If you ever faced unemployment, I’m sure you were relieved to get a weekly
check while you looked for a job — meager as it may have been. Did you real-
ize that unemployment compensation was partially paid by your employer?
In fact, an employer pays his share of unemployment compensation based on
his record of firing or laying off of employees. So think for a moment of your
dear employees and your own past experiences, and you’ll see the value of
paying toward unemployment compensation.
The fund that used to be known simply as Unemployment is now known as
the Federal Unemployment Tax (FUTA) fund. Employers contribute to the
fund, but states also collect taxes to fill their unemployment fund coffers.
For FUTA, employers pay a federal rate of 6.2 percent on the first $7,000 that
each employee earns. Luckily, you don’t just have to add the state rate on top
of that; the federal government allows you to subtract up to 5.4 percent of
the first $7,000 per employee, if that amount is paid to the state. Essentially,
the amount you pay to the state can serve as a credit toward the amount you
must pay to the federal government.

Each state sets its own unemployment tax rate. Many states also charge addi-
tional fees for administrative costs and job-training programs. You can check
out the full charges for your state at payroll-taxes.com, but to give you 
an idea of how taxes vary state to state, check out the sampling shown in
Table 11-2.

The percentage an employer must pay isn’t a set amount but instead is a per-
centage range. The employee income amount upon which this percentage
is charged also varies from state to state. The percentage range is based on
the company’s employment history and how frequently its employees collect
unemployment.
How states calculate the FUTA tax rate
States use four different methods to calculate how much you may need to
pay in FUTA taxes:
 Benefit ratio formula: The state looks at the ratio of benefits collected
by former employees to your company’s total payroll over the past three
years. States also adjust your rate depending upon the overall balance in
the state unemployment insurance fund.
 Benefit wage formula: The state looks at the proportion of your com-
pany’s payroll that’s paid to workers who become unemployed and
receive benefits, and then divides that number by your company’s total
taxable wages.
 Payroll decline ratio formula: The state looks at the decline in your
company’s payrolls from year to year or from quarter to quarter.
173
Chapter 11: Employer-Paid Taxes and Government Payroll Reporting

 Reserve ratio formula: The state keeps track of your company’s balance
in the unemployment reserve account, which gives a cumulative repre-
sentation of its use by your former employees that were laid off and paid
unemployment. This record keeping dates back from the date you were
first subject to the state unemployment rate. The reserve account is 
calculated by adding up all your contributions to the account and then
subtracting total benefits paid. This amount is then divided by your
company’s total payroll. The higher the reserve ratio, the lower the
required contribution rate.
These formulas can be very complicated, so your best bet is to meet with
your state’s unemployment office to review how your company’s unemploy-
ment rate will be set. In addition to getting a better idea of what may impact
your FUTA tax rate, you can also discuss how best to minimize that rate.
Calculating FUTA tax
After you know what your rate is, calculating the actual FUTA tax you owe
isn’t difficult.
As an example, consider a new company that’s just getting started in the state
of Florida; it has ten employees, and each employee makes more than $7,000
per year. For state FUTA taxes, I use the new employer rate of 2.7 percent on
the first $7,000 of income. The federal FUTA is the same for all employers —
6.2 percent. Here’s how you calculate the FUTA tax for this company:
State unemployment taxes:
$7,000 × 0.027 = $189 per employee
$189 × 10 employees = $1,890
Federal unemployment taxes:
$7,000 × 0.062 = $434
$434 × 10 employees = $4,340
The company doesn’t have to pay the full federal amount because it can take
up to a 5.4 percent credit for state taxes paid ($7,000 × 0.054 = $378). Because,
in this example, state taxes in Florida are only 2.7 percent of $7,000, this
employer can subtract the full amount of Florida FUTA taxes from the federal
FUTA tax:
$4,340 – $1,890 = $2,450
174
Part III: Tracking Day-to-Day Operations with Your Books 

So this company only needs to pay $2,450 to the federal government in FUTA
taxes. Any company paying more than $378 per employee to the state is only
able to reduce its federal bill by the maximum of $378 per employee. So,
every employer pays at least $56 per employee into the Federal FUTA pool.
Each year, you must file IRS Form 940 or 940-EZ, Employer’s Annual Federal
Unemployment (FUTA) Tax Return. Employers who only pay unemployment
contributions to one state and also pay those taxes on time are able to file
the shorter 940-EZ, which is shown in Figure 11-1. (Employers running 
businesses in the state of New York are excluded from using Form 940-EZ.)
You can find Form 940-EZ with its instructions online at www.irs.gov/pub/
irs-pdf/f940ez.pdf and Form 940 online at www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/
f940.pdf.
Figure 11-1:

175
Chapter 11: Employer-Paid Taxes and Government Payroll Reporting

You can pay taxes for Form 940 using the same coupon (Form 8109) used to
pay Form 941 taxes (see “Filing Form 941” earlier in this chapter for an expla-
nation). Most employers pay unemployment taxes quarterly, but if the amount
you must pay is less than $100 in any one quarter, you can wait until at least
$100 is due. For example, if you owe $50 in federal unemployment taxes in one
quarter, you can wait two quarters before making the payment.
Filing and paying unemployment taxes 
to state governments
States collect their unemployment taxes on a quarterly basis, and many
states allow you to pay your unemployment taxes online. Check with 
your state to find out how to file and make unemployment tax payments.
Skipping out on state taxes isn’t a good idea. If you don’t pay your state
taxes, you may end up with a lien filed against your business. You may also
end up facing penalties and interest charges for late payments. And if the
state has to take you to court to collect back taxes, you’ll have to pay court
and processing costs in addition to the back taxes, penalties, and interest.
Unfortunately, the filing requirements for state unemployment taxes are much
more difficult to complete than those for federal taxes (see the discussion of
Federal Form 940 above). States require you to detail each employee by name
and Social Security number because that’s how unemployment records are
managed at the state level. The state must know how much an employee was
paid each quarter in order to determine his or her unemployment benefit, if
the need arises. Some states also require you to report the number of weeks
an employee worked in each quarter because the employee’s unemployment
benefits are calculated based on the number of weeks worked.
Each state has its own form and filing requirements. Some states require a
detailed report as part of your quarterly wage and tax reports. Other states
allow a simple form for state income tax and a more detailed report with your
unemployment tax payment. To give you an idea of what a state form looks
like, Figure 11-2 shows Florida’s Employer’s Quarterly Report, Form UCT-6.
Florida doesn’t have an income tax, so only unemployment information needs
to be filed. Eight other states — Alaska, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota,
Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming — have no income tax on wages.
(New Hampshire and Tennessee do have a state income tax on dividends and
interest, however.)

Carrying Workman’s Compensation
Insurance
Taxes aren’t the only thing you need to worry about when figuring out your
state obligations after hiring employees. Every state (except Texas) requires
employers to carry workman’s compensation insurance, which covers your
Figure 11-2b:

Employer’s

Part III: Tracking Day-to-Day Operations with Your Books 

employees in case they’re injured on the job. Texas doesn’t require this insur-
ance but permits employees injured on the job to sue their employers in civil
court to recoup the costs of injuries.
If an employee gets hurt on the job, workman’s compensation covers costs of
lost income, medical expenses, vocational rehabilitation and, if applicable,
death benefits. Each state sets its own rules regarding how much medical
coverage you must provide. If the injury also causes the employee to miss
work, the state determines the percentage of the employee’s salary you must
pay and how long you pay that amount. If the injury results in the employee’s
death, the state also sets the amount you must pay toward funeral expenses
and the amount of financial support you must provide the employee’s family.
The state also decides who gets to pick the physician that will care for the
injured employee; options are the employer, the employee, the state agency,
or a combination of these folks. Most states allow either the employer or the
injured employee to choose the physician.
Each state makes up its own rules about how a company must insure itself
against employee injuries on the job. Some states create state-based work-
man’s compensation funds to which all employers must contribute. Other
states allow you the option of participating in a state-run insurance program
or buying insurance from a private company. A number of states permit
employers to use HMOs, PPOs, or other managed-care providers to handle
workers’ claims. If your state doesn’t have a mandatory state pool, you’ll
find that shopping around for the best private rates doesn’t help you much.
States set the requirements for coverage, and premiums are established by
either a national rating bureau called the National Council on Compensation
Insurance (NCCI) or a state rating bureau. For the lowdown on NCCI and
workman’s compensation insurance, visit www.ncci.com.
You may find lower rates over the long-term if your state allows you to buy
private workman’s compensation insurance. Many private insurers give 
discounts to companies with good safety standards in place and few past
claims. So the best way to keep your workman’s compensation rates low is
to encourage safety and minimize your company’s claims.
Your company’s rates are calculated based on risks identified in two areas:
 Classification of the business: These classifications are based on his-
toric rates of risk in different industries. For example, if you operate a
business in an industry that historically has a high rate of employee
injury, such as a construction business, your base rate for workman’s
compensation insurance is higher than that of a company in an industry
without a history of frequent employee injury, such as an office that
sells insurance.
179
Chapter 11: Employer-Paid Taxes and Government Payroll Reporting

 Classification of the employees: The NCCI publishes classifications of
over 700 jobs in a book called the Scopes Manual. Most states use this
manual to develop the basis for their classification schedules. For example,
businesses that employ most workers at desk jobs pay less in workman’s
compensation than businesses with a majority of employees operating
heavy machinery because more workers are hurt operating heavy machin-
ery than working at desks.
Be careful how you classify your employees. Many small businesses pay
more than needed for workman’s compensation insurance because they
misclassify employees. Be sure you understand the classification system
and properly classify your employee positions before applying for work-
man’s compensation insurance. Be sure to read the information at www.
ncci.com before classifying your employees.
When computing insurance premiums for a company, the insurer (whether
the state or a private firm) looks at employee classifications and the rate of
pay for each employee. For example, consider the position of a secretary 
who earns $25,000 per year. If that job classification is rated at 29 cents per
$100 of income, the workman’s compensation premium for that secretary
is $72.50.
Most states allow you to exclude any overtime paid when calculating work-
man’s compensation premiums. You may also be able to lower your premiums
by paying a deductible on claims. A deductible is the amount you would have
to pay before the insurance company pays anything. Deductibles can lower
your premium by as much as 25 percent, so consider that as well to keep
your upfront costs low.
Maintaining Employee Records
One thing that’s abundantly clear when you consider all the state and fed-
eral filing requirements for employee taxes is that you must keep very good
employee records. Otherwise, you’ll have a hard time filling out all the 
necessary forms and providing quarterly detail on your employees and your
payroll. The best way to track employee information using a manual book-
keeping system is to set up an employee journal and create a separate journal
page for each employee. (I get into how to set up journals in Chapter 5.)
The detailed individual records you keep on each employee should include
this basic information, most of which is collected or determined as part of
the hiring process:
 Name, address, phone number, and Social Security number
 Department or division within the company
180
Part III: Tracking Day-to-Day Operations with Your Books 

 Start date with the company
 Pay rate
 Pay period (weekly, biweekly, semimonthly, or monthly)
 Whether hourly or salaried
 Whether exempt or nonexempt
 W-4 withholding allowances
 Benefits information
 Payroll deductions
 All payroll activity
If an employee asks to change the number of withholding allowances and file
a new W-4 or asks for benefits changes, his or her record must be updated to
reflect such changes.
The personal detail that doesn’t change each pay period should appear at
the top of the journal page. Then, you divide the remaining information into
at least seven columns. Here’s a sample of what an employee’s journal page
may look like:
Name:
SS#:
Address:
Tax Info: Married, 2 WH
Pay Information: $8 hour, nonexempt, biweekly
Benefits: None
The sample journal page contains only seven columns: date of check, taxable
wages, Social Security tax, Medicare tax, benefits withholding, federal with-
holding, state withholding, and net check amount. (The state tax in the
sample is zero because this particular employee works in a nonincome tax
state.) You may want to add other columns to your employee journal to keep
track of things such as:

 Non-taxable wages, such as health or retirement benefits that are paid
before taxes are taken out
 Benefits
If the employee receives benefits, you need at least one column to track
any money taken out of the employee’s check to pay for those benefits.
In fact, you may want to consider tracking each benefit in a separate
column.
 Sick time
 Vacation time
Clearly, these employee journal sheets can get very lengthy very quickly.
That’s why many small businesses use computerized accounting systems to
monitor both payroll and employee records. Figures 11-3 and 11-4 show you
how a new employee is added to the QuickBooks system.

ventually, every accounting period comes to an end,
and whether it’s the end of a month, a quarter, or a
year, you need to check your work and get ready to close
out the period.
This part introduces you to the process of preparing your
books for closing out an accounting period. You find out
about the key adjustments needed to record depreciation
of your assets, such as cars and buildings. This part also
shows you how to calculate and record your interest pay-
ments and income in your books.
To round out the closing process, I show you how to
prove out your books by checking your cash, testing your

A
ll businesses use equipment, furnishings, and vehicles that last more
than a year. Any asset that has a lifespan of more than a year is called
a fixed asset. They may last longer than other assets, but even fixed assets
eventually get old and need replacing.
And because your business should match its expenses with its revenue, you
don’t want to write off the full expense of a fixed asset in one year. After all,
you’ll certainly be making use of the asset for more than one year.
Imagine how bad your income statement would look if you wrote off the cost
of a $100,000 piece of equipment in just one year? It would sure look as if
your business wasn’t doing well. Imagine the impact on a small business —
$100,000 could eat up its entire profit or maybe even put it in the position of
reporting a loss.
Instead of writing off the full amount of a fixed asset in one year, you use an
accounting method called depreciation to write off the asset as it gets used
up. In this chapter, I introduce you to the various ways you can depreciate
your assets and explain how to calculate depreciation, how depreciation
impacts both the income statement and your tax bill, and how to record
depreciation in your books.

Defining Depreciation
You may think of depreciation as something that happens to your car as it
loses value. In fact, most new cars depreciate 20 to 30 percent or even more
as soon as you drive them off the lot. But when you’re talking about account-
ing, the definition of depreciation is a bit different.
Essentially, accountants use depreciation as a way to allocate the costs of a
fixed asset over the period in which the asset is useable to the business. You,
the bookkeeper, record the full transaction when the asset is bought, but the
value of the asset is gradually reduced by subtracting a portion of that value
as a depreciation expense each year. Depreciation expenses don’t involve the
exchange of cash; they’re solely done for accounting purposes. Most companies
enter depreciation expenses into the books once a year just before preparing
their annual reports, but others calculate depreciation expenses monthly or
quarterly.
One key reason to write off assets is to lower your tax bill, so the IRS gets
involved in depreciation, too. As a business owner, you can’t write off the
cost of all major purchases in one year. Instead the IRS has strict rules about
how you can write off assets as tax-deductible expenses. I talk more about
the IRS’s rules in the section, “Tackling Taxes and Depreciation,” later in this
chapter.
Knowing what you can and 
can’t depreciate
Businesses don’t depreciate all assets. Low-cost items or items that aren’t
expected to last more than one year are recorded in expense accounts rather
than asset accounts. For example, office supplies are expense items and not
depreciated, but that office copier, which you’ll use for more than one year, is
recorded in the books as a fixed asset and depreciated each year.
Lifespan isn’t the deciding factor for depreciation, however. Some assets that
last many years are never depreciated. One good example is land; you can
always make use of land, so its value never depreciates. You also can’t depre-
ciate any property that you lease or rent, but if you make improvements to
leased property, you can depreciate the cost of those improvements. In that
case, you write off the lease or rent as an expense item and depreciate the
lease improvements over their estimated useful life.
188
Part IV: Preparing the Books for Year’s (or Month’s) End 

You can’t depreciate any items that you use outside your business, such as
your personal car or home computer, but if you use these assets for both per-
sonal needs and business needs, you can depreciate a portion of them based
on the percentage of time or other measurement that proves how much you
use the car or computer for business. For example, the portion of a car that
can be depreciated is based on the miles driven for business versus the miles
driven for personal use. If you drive your car a total of 12,000 miles in a year
and have records showing that 6,000 of those miles were for business pur-
poses, you can depreciate 50 percent of the cost of the car. That percentage
is allocated over the anticipated useful life of the car.
Another example of depreciation of a dual-usage asset is a room in your
home designated exclusively for your business. You may be able to depreci-
ate a portion of your home’s cost as part of your business expenses. The
amount you can depreciate is based on the portion of your home used for
business.
Figuring out the useful life of a fixed asset
You’re probably wondering how you figure out the useful life of a fixed asset.
Well, the IRS has done the dirty work for you by creating a chart that spells
out the recovery periods allowed for business equipment (see Table 12-1).
Recovery periods are the anticipated useful lifespan of a fixed asset. For
example, cars have a five-year recovery period because the IRS anticipates
that they’ll have a useful lifespan of five years. While the car will probably
run longer than that, you’re not likely to continue using that car for business
purposes after the first five years. You’re more likely to trade it in and get a
new car.

You can use the IRS chart to determine your fixed asset’s useful life, or you can
develop a chart that makes more sense for your business. For example, if you
run a trucking company, you may determine that your trucks get used up more
quickly than those used by a business for occasional deliveries. Although the
IRS says that five years is the normal useful life for a truck, you may determine
that trucks in your business are only useable for three years. You may need to
justify the shorter useful life to the IRS, so be sure you have the data to back up
your decision.
Most accountants use the IRS estimates of useful life unless there’s some-
thing unique about the way the business uses its fixed assets.
Delving into cost basis
In order to calculate depreciation for an asset, you need to know the cost
basis of that asset. The equation for cost basis is:
Cost of the fixed asset + Sales tax + Shipping and delivery costs +
Installation charges + Other costs = Cost basis
 Cost of the fixed asset: What you paid for the equipment, furniture,
structure, vehicle, or other asset.
 Sales tax: What you were charged in sales tax to buy the fixed asset.
 Shipping and delivery: Any shipping or delivery charges you paid to get
the fixed asset.
 Installation charges: Any charges you paid in order to have the equip-
ment, furniture, or other fixed asset installed on your business’s
premises.
190
Part IV: Preparing the Books for Year’s (or Month’s) End 

 Other costs: Any other charges you need to pay to make the fixed asset
usable for your business. For example, if you buy a new computer and
need to set up certain hardware in order to use that computer for your
business, those setup costs can be added as part of the cost basis of the
fixed asset (the computer).
Reducing the Value of Assets
After you decide on the useful life of an asset and calculate its cost basis 
(see the preceding sections), you have to decide how to go about reducing
the asset’s value according to accounting standards.
Evaluating your depreciation options
When calculating depreciation of your assets each year, you have a choice of
four methods: Straight-Line, Sum-of-Years-Digits, Double-Declining Balance,
and Units of Production. In this section, I explain these methods as well as
the pros and cons of using each one.
To show you how the methods handle assets differently, I calculate the first
year’s depreciation expense using the purchase of a truck on January 1, 2005,
with a cost basis of $25,000. I assume that the truck can be sold in five years
for $5,000. This is called the salvage value. I show you how to use the salvage
value as part of the calculations for three of the depreciation methods. The
fourth method I cover, Units of Production, is used primarily in manufactur-
ing, so the truck example doesn’t work. But you still get the idea of how to
use that method, don’t worry.
Straight-Line
When depreciating assets using the Straight-Line method, you spread the cost
of the asset evenly over the number of years the asset will be used. Straight-
Line is the most common method used for depreciation of assets, and it’s
also the easiest one to use. Another advantage of this method is that you can
use it for both accounting purposes and tax purposes. (If you use any of the
other methods, you have to keep separate depreciation records — one for
your financial reports and one for the tax man.
The formula for calculating Straight-Line depreciation is:
(Cost of fixed asset – Salvage) ÷ Estimated useful life = Annual depreciation
expense
191
Chapter 12: Depreciating Your Assets

For the truck in this example, the cost basis is $25,000, the salvage value is
$5,000, and I’m using the IRS estimate of useful life of five years. With these
figures, the calculation for finding the annual depreciation expense of this
truck based on the Straight-Line depreciation method is:
($25,000 – $5,000) ÷ 5 = $4,000
Each year, the business’ Income Statement should include $4,000 as a depre-
ciation expense for this truck. You add this $4,000 depreciation expense to
the accumulated depreciation account for the truck. This accumulated depre-
ciation account is shown below the truck’s original value on the Balance Sheet.
You subtract the accumulated depreciation from the value of the truck to show
a net asset value, which is the value remaining on the truck.
Sum-of-Years-Digits
If you think your asset loses a greater portion of its useful life in the early
years, you can speed up its depreciation by using the Sum-of-Years-Digits
(SYD) method. This method allows you to write off higher depreciation
expenses in the earlier years of useful life and lower depreciation in later
years. When you use Sum-of-Years-Digits, you assume that the fixed asset will
be used less in later years.
One big disadvantage of writing off assets quickly is that the higher deprecia-
tion expense lowers your business’s net income.
Sum-of-Years-Digits requires a three-step calculation:
1. Find the SYD using this formula, with n representing the number of
years of estimated useful life remaining as of the start of the fiscal year:
n(n+1) ÷ 2 = SYD
2. Find the applicable fraction using this formula:
n ÷ SYD = Applicable fraction
3. Calculate the depreciation expense using this formula:
(Cost – Salvage value) × Applicable fraction = Depreciation expense
To calculate the first year of the depreciation expense on the truck, this for-
mula works like so:
SYD: 5(5+1) ÷ 2 = 15
Applicable fraction: 5 ÷ 15 = 1⁄3
Depreciation expense: $20,000 × 1⁄3 = $6,666.67
192
Part IV: Preparing the Books for Year’s (or Month’s) End 

The depreciation expense written off during the truck’s first year of life is
$2,666.67 higher than it is when I calculate it using the Straight-Line deprecia-
tion method. If I do the same calculation for the remaining years of useful life,
I get the following results:
Year 2: $5,333.33
Year 3: $4,000.00
Year 4: $2,666.67
Year 5: $1,333.33
By Year 3, I’ve written off $16,000, 80 percent of the depreciable amount for
the truck.
Double-Declining Balance
The Double-Declining Balance method of depreciation allows you to write off
an asset even more quickly than the Sum-of-Years-Digits (see the preceding
section). This method is ideal for assets whose primary usefulness is in the
early years of life.
You calculate the depreciation using the Declining Balance method using this
formula:
2 × (1 ÷ Estimated useful life) × Book value at the beginning of the year =
Depreciation expense
The calculation for the truck’s depreciation expense using the Declining
Balance method is:
2 × (1 ÷ 5) × $20,000 = $10,000
As you can see, the depreciation expense for the first year of using the truck
is $10,000. If I do the same calculation for the remaining years of useful life, 
I get the following results:
Year 2: $6,000
Year 3: $3,600
Year 4: $400
Year 5: $0
Eighty percent of the value of the truck is written off in the first two years.
Clearly, the Double-Declining Balance method of depreciation reduces the
value of an asset even faster than the Sum-of-Years-Digits.
193
Chapter 12: Depreciating Your Assets

Units of Production
The Units of Production (UOP) method of depreciation works well primarily in
a manufacturing environment because it calculates depreciation based on the
number of units produced in a year. Companies whose machinery usage
varies greatly each year depending on the market and the number of units
needed for sale make use of this depreciation method.
The formula for calculating depreciation using Units of Production is a two-
step process:
1. Find the UOP rate using this formula:
(Cost – Salvage value) ÷ Estimated number of units to be produced
during estimated useful life = UOP rate
2. Find the depreciation expense using this formula:
Units produced during the year × UOP rate = Depreciation expense
You only need to use the Units of Production depreciation method if you’re
manufacturing the products you sell and if the usage of your equipment fluc-
tuates widely from year to year.
How you can use QuickBooks 
to calculate depreciation
With four different methods for depreciating your company’s assets, you’re
probably wondering which method you should use. Your accountant is the
best person to answer that question. He can look at the way your business
operates and determine which method makes the most sense for presenting
your financial data.
Depreciation doesn’t involve the use of cash. When talking about accounting,
depreciation’s purely a way to show how quickly you’re using up an asset.
If you’re using QuickBooks, the good news is that you don’t have to manually
calculate depreciation expense amounts. The Planning & Budgeting section of
QuickBooks has a function called Decision Tools, and one of those tools helps
you figure out your depreciation expense. The first step in using QuickBooks
for depreciation calculations is entering information about your assets (see
Figure 12-1).
After you enter asset information, the system automatically calculates the
depreciation expense using the Straight-Line method, the Sum-of-Years-Digits
method, and the Double-Declining Balance method (see Figure 12-2). You
select the method you want to use and save the information about each
asset, which you can then refer to at the end of each year when you need to
record the depreciation expense for that year.
194
Part IV: Preparing the Books for Year’s (or Month’s) End 

When you actually enter the data in your computerized accounting system, be
sure to check on how to enter that data based on your system. Depreciation
expense, because it does not involve cash, is a bit more complicated to enter.
I don’t give you the lengthy instructions for QuickBooks here because it
depends on how your accountant initially set up the system.

Chapter 12: Depreciating Your Assets

Tackling Taxes and Depreciation
Depreciation calculations for tax purposes are a completely different animal
than the calculations used to record depreciation for accounting purposes.
You can use Straight-Line depreciation to calculate your depreciation expense
for tax purposes, but most businesses prefer to write off the highest expense
legally permissible and reduce their tax bills by the greatest amount.
In addition to Straight-Line depreciation, two other acceptable IRS methods
for writing off assets are: Section 179 and Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery
System (MACRS). The big advantage of the Section 179 Deduction is that you
can write off up to 100 percent of the cost basis of qualifying property. (I talk
more about what qualifies in the following section.) If the property doesn’t
qualify, most businesses choose to use MACRS rather than Straight-Line
depreciation.
Section 179
Section 179, which gets its name from a section of the tax code, is a great boon
for companies. Businesses can write off up to $105,000 in newly purchased
property that qualifies for the deduction up to 100 percent of the cost basis of
the property. In 2006 and 2007, the write-off amount will go up slightly depend-
ing upon the amount of a cost of living adjustment. Then, beginning in 2008,
the Section 179 deduction drops back to $25,000 (unless Congress changes the
tax law again).
The primary reason for this part of the tax code is to encourage businesses
to buy new property in order to stimulate the economy. That’s why only cer-
tain types of property are included, and there are limits on the amount that
can be deducted for some types of property.
Basically, Section 179’s qualifying property includes tangible property such
as machines, equipment, and furniture. In addition, some storage facilities
qualify, as do some single-purpose agricultural and horticultural structures.
All cars and SUVs between 6,000 and 14,000 pounds can’t be fully written off
under Section 179. You also can’t write off property held for the production of
income (such as rental property), most real property, property acquired as a
gift or inheritance, and property held outside the United States.
You can get full details about Section 179 by ordering a copy of IRS Publication
946, How to Depreciate Property, from the IRS or accessing it online at www.
irs.gov. Be sure to work with your accountant to determine what’s eligible
and how much of the cost basis is eligible for the Section 179 deduction.
196
Part IV: Preparing the Books for Year’s (or Month’s) End 

MACRS
The most common type of depreciation write-off used by businesses is
Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System, or MACRS. The recovery period
shown in Table 12-1 is the basis for this depreciation method. After you know
what type of property you have (three-year, five-year, and so on), you use the
MACRS table in IRS Publication 946, How to Depreciate Property, to figure out
the depreciation expense you can write off. Luckily, you can leave MACRS cal-
culations for your accountant to do when he prepares your business tax
forms.
Setting Up Depreciation Schedules
In order to keep good accounting records, you need to track how much you
depreciate each of your assets in some form of a schedule. After all, your
financial statements only include a total value for all your assets and a total
accumulated depreciation amount. Most businesses maintain depreciation
schedules in some type of spreadsheet program that exists outside their
accounting systems. Usually, one person is responsible for managing assets
and their depreciation. However, in a large company, these tasks can turn
into full-time jobs for several people.
The best way to keep track of depreciation is to prepare a separate schedule
for each asset account that you depreciate. For example, set up depreciation
schedules for Buildings, Furniture and Fixtures, Office Equipment, and so on.
Your depreciation schedule should include all the information you need to
determine annual depreciation, such as the original purchase date, original
cost basis, and recovery period. You can add columns to track the actual
depreciation expenses and calculate the current value of each asset. Here’s a
sample depreciation schedule for vehicles:
Depreciation Schedule: Vehicles
Date Put in 
Description
Cost
Recovery Period
Annual 
Service
Depreciation
1/5/2004
Black car
$30,000
5 years
$5,000
1/1/2005
Blue truck
$25,000
5 years
$4,000
If you use a different method of depreciation for tax purposes (see “Tackling
Taxes and Depreciation”), you should prepare schedules for tax purposes
as well.
197
Chapter 12: Depreciating Your Assets

Depreciation can be more than just a mathematical exercise. Keeping track of
depreciation is a good way to monitor the age of your assets and know when
you should plan for their replacement. As your assets age, they’ll incur greater
repair costs, so keeping depreciation schedules can help you plan repair and
maintenance budgets as well.
Recording Depreciation Expenses
Recording a depreciation expense calls for a rather simple entry into your
accounting system.
After calculating your depreciation expense, no matter which method you
used to calculate that expense, here is how you would record a depreciation
expense of $4,000:
Debit
Credit
Depreciation Expense
$4,000
Accumulated Depreciation: Vehicles
$4,000
The Depreciation Expense account increases by the debit, and the Accumulated
Depreciation: Vehicles account increases by the credit. On the income state-
ment, you subtract the Depreciation Expense from sales, and on the balance
sheet, you subtract the Accumulated Depreciation: Vehicles from the value of
Vehicles.

Chapter 13
Paying and Collecting Interest
In This Chapter
 Understanding interest calculations
 Making the most of interest income
 Calculating loan interest
F
ew businesses are able to make major purchases without taking out
loans. Whether loans are for vehicles, buildings, or other business needs,
businesses must pay interest, a percentage of the amount loaned, to whoever
loans them the money.
Some businesses loan their own money and receive interest payments as
income. In fact, a savings account can be considered a type of loan because
by placing your money in the account, you’re giving the bank the opportunity
to loan that money to others. So the bank pays you for the use of your money
by paying interest, which is a type of income for your company.
This chapter reviews different types of loans and how to calculate and record
interest expenses for each type. In addition, I discuss how you calculate and
record interest income in your business’s books.
Deciphering Types of Interest
Any time you make use of someone else’s money, such as a bank, you have 
to pay interest for that use — whether you’re buying a house, a car, or some
other item you want. The same is true when someone else is using your
money. For example, when you buy a bond or deposit money in a money
market account, you’re paid interest for allowing the use of your money 
while it’s on deposit.

The financial institution that has your money will likely combine your money
with that of other depositors and loan it out to other people to make more
interest than it’s paying you. That’s why when the interest rates you have to
pay on loans are low, the interest rates you can earn on savings are even
lower.
Banks actually use two types of interest calculations:
 Simple interest is calculated only on the principal amount of the loan.
 Compound interest is calculated on the principal and on interest
earned.
Simple interest
Simple interest is simple to calculate. Here’s the formula for calculating
simple interest:
Principal x interest rate x n = interest
To show you how interest is calculated, I assume that someone deposited
$10,000 in the bank in a money market account earning 3 percent (0.03) inter-
est for 3 years. So the interest earned over 3 years is $10,000 x .03 x 3 = $900.
Compound interest
Compound interest is computed on both the principal and any interest
earned. You must calculate the interest each year and add it to the balance
before you can calculate the next year’s interest payment, which will be
based on both the principal and interest earned.
Here’s how you would calculate compound interest:
Principal x interest rate
= interest for year one
(Principal + interest earned) x interest rate = interest for year two
(Principal + interest earned) x interest rate = interest for year three
You repeat this calculation for all years of the deposit or loan. The one excep-
tion could be with a loan. If you pay the total interest due each month or year
(depending on when your payments are due), there would be no interest to
compound.
200
Part IV: Preparing the Books for Year’s (or Month’s) End 

To show you how this impacts earnings, I calculated the three-year deposit of
$10,000 at 3 percent (0.03):
$10,000 x .03
=
$300 - Year One interest
($10,000 + 300) x .03
=
$309 - Year Two Interest
($10,000 + 300 +309) x .03
=
$318.27 - Year Three Interest
Total Interest Earned
=
$927.27
You can see that you’d earn an extra $27.27 during the first three years of that
deposit if the interest is compounded. When working with much larger sums or
higher interest rates for longer periods of time, compound interest can make a
big difference in how much you earn or how much you pay on a loan.
Ideally, you want to find a savings account, certificate deposit, or other sav-
ings instrument that earns compound interest. But, if you want to borrow
money, look for a simple interest loan.
Also, not all accounts that earn compound interest are created equally. Watch
carefully to see how frequently the interest is compounded. The preceding
example shows a type of account for which interest is compounded annually.
But, if you can find an account where interest is compounded monthly, the
interest you earn will be even higher. Monthly compounding means that inter-
est earned will be calculated each month and added to the principle each
month before calculating the next month’s interest, which results in a lot more
interest than a bank that compounds interest just once a year.
Handling Interest Income
The income that your business earns from its savings accounts, certificates
of deposits, or other investment vehicles is called interest income. As the
bookkeeper, you’re rarely required to calculate interest income using the
simple interest or compounded interest formulas described in the earlier 
sections of this chapter. In most cases, the financial institution sends you 
a monthly, quarterly, or annual statement that has a separate line item
reporting interest earned.
When you get your monthly statement, you then reconcile the books.
Reconciliation is a process in which you prove out whether the amount the
bank says you have in your account is equal to what you think you have in
your account. I talk more about reconciling bank accounts in Chapter 14.
The reason I mention it now is that the first step in the reconciliation process
involves recording any interest earned or bank fees in the books so that your
balance matches what the bank shows. Figure 13-1 shows you how to record
$25 in Interest Income.
201
Chapter 13: Paying and Collecting Interest

If you’re keeping the books manually, a journal entry to record interest would
look similar to this:
Debit
Credit
Cash
XXXX
Interest Income
XXXX
To record interest income from American Savings Bank.
When preparing financial statements, you show Interest Income on the
income statement (see Chapter 19 for more information about the income
statement) in a section called Other Income. Other Income includes any
income your business earned that was not directly related to your primary
business activity — selling your goods or services.
Delving into Loans and Interest Expenses
Businesses borrow money for both short-term periods (periods of less than
12 months) and long-term periods (periods of more than one year). Short-term
debt usually involves some form of credit-card debt or line-of-credit debt.
Long-term debt can include a 5-year car loan, 20-year mortgage, or any other
type of debt that is paid over more than one year.
Short-term debt
Any money due in the next 12-month period is shown on the balance sheet as
short-term or current debt. Any interest paid on that money is shown as an
Interest Expense on the income statement.

Part IV: Preparing the Books for Year’s (or Month’s) End 

In most cases, you don’t have to calculate your interest due. The financial
institution sending you a bill gives you a breakdown of the principal and
interest to be paid.
How credit card interest is calculated
For example, when you get a credit-card bill at home, a line always shows you
new charges, the amount to pay in full to avoid all interest, and the amount 
of interest charged during the current period on any money not paid from 
the previous bill. If you don’t pay your credit in full, interest on most cards is
calculated using a daily periodic rate of interest, which is compounded each
day based on the unpaid balance. Yes, credit cards are a type of compounded
interest. When not paid in full, interest is calculated on the unpaid principal
balance plus any unpaid interest. Table 13-1 shows what a typical interest cal-
culation looks like on a credit card.

On many credit cards, you start paying interest on new purchases immedi-
ately, if you haven’t paid your balance due in full the previous month. When
opening a credit-card account for your business, be sure you understand how
interest is calculated and when the bank starts charging on new purchases.
Some issuers give a grace period of 20 to 30 days before charging interest,
while others don’t give any type of grace period at all.
In Table 13-1, the Finance Charges include the daily rate charged in interest
based on the daily periodic rate plus any transaction fees. For example, if 
you take a cash advance from your credit card, many credit-card companies
charge a transaction fee of 2 to 3 percent of the total amount of cash taken.
This fee can be true when you transfer balances from one credit card to
another. Although the company entices you with an introductory rate of 1 
or 2 percent to get you to transfer the balance, be sure to read the fine print.
You may have to pay a 3 percent transaction fee on the full amount trans-
ferred, which makes the introductory rate much higher.
Using credit lines
As a small business owner, you get better interest rates using a line of credit
with a bank rather than a credit card. Interest rates are usually lower on lines
203
Chapter 13: Paying and Collecting Interest

of credit. Typically, a business owner uses a credit card for purchases, but if
he can’t pay the bill in full, he draws money from his line of credit rather than
carry over the credit-card balance.
When the money is first received from the credit line, you record the cash
receipt and the liability. Just to show you how this transaction works, I
record the receipt of a credit line of $1,500. Here is what the journal entry
would look like:
Debit
Credit
Cash
1,500
Credit Line Payable
1,500
To record receipt of cash from credit line.
In this entry, you increase the Cash account and the Credit Line Payable
account balances. If you’re using a computerized accounting program, you
record the transaction using the deposit form, as shown in Figure 13-2.
When you make your first payment, you must record the use of cash, the
amount paid on the principle of the loan, and the amount paid in interest.
Here is what that journal entry looks like:
Figure 13-2:
Recording
receipt of
cash from

204
Part IV: Preparing the Books for Year’s (or Month’s) End 

Debit
Credit
Credit Line Payable
150
Interest Expense

Cash
160
To make monthly payment on credit line.
This journal entry reduces the amount due in the Credit Line Payable
account, increases the amount paid in the Interest Expense account, and
reduces the amount in the Cash account.
If you’re using a computerized system, you simply complete a check form
and indicate which accounts are impacted by the payment, and the system
updates the accounts automatically. Figure 13-3 shows you how to record a
loan payment in QuickBooks.
As you can see in Figure 13-3, at the same time that you prepare the check 
for printing, you can add the accounts that are impacted by that payment 
by splitting the detail expense information. I indicate $150 of that payment
should be recorded in the Bank Credit Card Payable account, and $10 should
be recorded as Interest Income. At the top of the check, I indicate which
account will be used to pay the bill. QuickBooks can then print the check 
and update all affected accounts. You don’t need to do any additional post-
ings to update your books.

Chapter 13: Paying and Collecting Interest

Long-term debt
Most companies take on some form of debt that will be paid over a period 
of time that is longer than 12 months. This debt may include car loans, 
mortgages, or promissory notes. A promissory note is a written agreement
where you agree to repay someone a set amount of money at some point in
the future at a particular interest rate. It can be monthly, yearly, or some
other term specified in the note. Most installment loans are types of promis-
sory notes.
Recording a debt
When the company first takes on the debt, it’s recorded in the books in much
the same way as a short-term debt:
Debit
Credit
Cash
XXX
Notes Payable
XXX
To record receipt of cash from American Bank promissory note.
Payments are also recorded in a manner similar to short-term debt:
Debit
Credit
Notes Payable
XXX
Interest Expense
XXX
Cash
XXX
To record payment on American Bank promissory note.
You record the initial long-term debt and make payments the same way in
QuickBooks as you do for short-term debt.
While how you enter the initial information isn’t very different, a big difference
exists between how short- and long-term debt are shown on the financial
statements. All short-term debt is shown in the Current Liability section of
the balance sheet.
Long-term debt is split and shown in different line items. The portion of the
debt due in the next 12 months is shown in the Current Liabilities section,
which is usually a line item named something like “Current Portion of Long-
Term Debt.” The remaining balance of the long-term debt due beyond the
next 12 months appears in the Long-Term Liability section of the balance
sheet as Notes Payable.
206
Part IV: Preparing the Books for Year’s (or Month’s) End 

Major purchases and long-term debt
Sometimes a long-term liability is set up at the same time as you make a
major purchase. You may pay some portion of the amount due in cash as a
down payment and the remainder as a note. To show you how to record such
a transaction, I assume that a business has purchased a truck for $25,000,
made a down payment of $5,000, and took a note at an interest rate of 6 per-
cent for $20,000. Here’s how you record this purchase in the books:
Debit
Credit
Vehicles
25,000
Cash
5,000
Notes Payable – Vehicles
20,000
To record payment on the purchase of the blue truck.
You then record payments on the note in the same way as any other loan 
payment:
Debit
Credit
Notes Payable – Vehicles
XXX
Interest Expense
XXX
Cash
XXX
To record payment on the purchase of the blue truck.
When recording the payment on a long-term debt for which you have a set
installment payment, you may not get a breakdown of interest and principal
with every payment. For example, many times when you take out a car loan,
you get a coupon book with just the total payment due each month. Each
payment includes both principal and interest, but you don’t get any break-
down detailing how much goes toward interest and how much goes toward
principal.
Separating principal and interest
Why is this a problem for recording payments? Each payment includes a 
different amount for principal and for interest. At the beginning of the loan,
the principal is at its highest amount, so the amount of interest due is much
higher than later in the loan payoff process when the balance is lower. Many
times in the first year of notes payable on high-price items, such as a mort-
gage on a building, you’re paying more interest than principal.
207
Chapter 13: Paying and Collecting Interest

In order to record long-term debt for which you don’t receive a breakdown
each month, you need to ask the bank that gave you the loan for an amortiza-
tion schedule. An amortization schedule lists the total payment, the amount of
each payment that goes toward interest, the amount that goes toward princi-
pal, and the remaining balance to be paid on the note.
Some banks provide an amortization schedule automatically when you sign
all the paperwork for the note. If your bank can’t give you one, you can easily
get one online using an amortization calculator. BankRate.com has a good
one at www.bankrate.com/brm/amortization-calculator.asp.
Using that calculator, I list the principal/interest breakdown for the first six
months of payment on the truck in a six-month amortization chart. You can
see from Table 13-2 that the amount paid to principal on a long-term note
gradually increases, while the amount of interest paid gradually decreases
as the note balance is paid off. The calculator did calculate payments for all
60 months, but I don’t include them all here.

In reading the amortization chart in Table 13-2, notice how the amount paid
toward interest is slightly less each month as the balance on the note still
due is gradually reduced. Also, the amount paid toward the principal of that
note gradually increases as less of the payment is used to pay interest.
By the time you start making payments for the final year of the loan, interest
costs drop dramatically because the balance is so much lower. For the first
payment of Year 5, the amount paid in interest is $22.47, and the amount
paid on principal is $364.19. The balance remaining after that payment is
$4,128.34.
As you lower your principal balance, much less of your payment goes toward
interest and much more goes toward reducing principal. That’s why many
financial specialists advice you to pay down principal as fast as possible if
you want to reduce the term of a loan.

Proving Out the Cash
In This Chapter
 Counting your company’s cash
 Finalizing the cash journals
 Balancing out your bank accounts
 Posting cash-related adjustments
A
ll business owners — whether the business is a small, family-owned
candy store or a major international conglomerate — like to periodically
test how well their businesses are doing. They also want to be sure that the
numbers in their accounting systems actually match what’s physically in their
stores and offices. After they check out what’s in the books, these business
owners can prepare financial reports to determine the company’s financial
success or failure during the last month, quarter, or year. This process of 
verifying the accuracy of your cash is called proving out.
The first step in proving out the books involves counting the company’s 
cash and verifying that the cash numbers in your books match the actual
cash on hand at a particular point in time. This chapter explains how you 
can test to be sure the cash counts are accurate, finalize the cash journals 
for the accounting period, prove out the bank accounts, and post any adjust-
ments or corrections to the General Ledger.
Why Prove Out the Books?
You’re probably thinking that proving out the books sounds like a huge task
that takes lots of time. You’re right — it’s a big job, but it’s also a very neces-
sary one to do periodically so you can be sure that what’s recorded in your
accounting system realistically measures what’s actually going on in your
business.

With any accounting system, mistakes can be made, and, unfortunately, any
business can fall victim to incidents of theft or embezzlement. The only way
to be sure that none of these problems exist in your business is to periodi-
cally prove out the books. The process of proving out the books is a big part
of the accounting cycle, which I discuss in detail in Chapter 2. The first three
steps of the accounting cycle — recording transactions, making journal
entries, and posting summaries of those entries to the General Ledger —
involve tracking the flow of cash throughout the accounting period. All three
steps are part of the process of recording a business’s financial activities
throughout the entire accounting period. The rest of the steps in the account-
ing cycle are conducted at the end of the period and are part of the process
of proving out the accuracy of your books. They include running a trial balance
(see Chapter 16), creating a worksheet (see Chapter 16), adjusting journal
entries (see Chapter 17), creating financial statements (see Chapters 18 and 19),
and closing the books (see Chapter 22). Most businesses prove out their books
every month.
Of course, you don’t want to shut down your business for a week while you
prove out the books, so you should select a day during each accounting
period on which you’ll take a financial snapshot of the state of your accounts.
For example, if you’re preparing monthly financial reports at the end of the
month, you test the amount of cash your business has on hand as of that 
certain time and day, such as 6 p.m. on June 30 after your store closes for
the day. The rest of the testing process — running a trial balance, creating a
worksheet, adjusting journal entries, creating financial statements, and clos-
ing the books — is based on what happened before that point in time. When
you open the store and sell more products the next day and buy new things
to run your business, those transactions and any others that follow the point
in time of your test become part of the next accounting cycle.
Making Sure Ending Cash Is Right
Testing your books starts with counting your cash. Why start with cash?
Because the accounting process starts with transactions, and transactions
occur when cash exchanges hands either to buy things you need to run the
business or to sell your products or services. Before you can even begin to
test whether the books are right, you need to know if your books have cap-
tured what’s happened to your company’s cash and if the amount of cash
shown in your books actually matches the amount of cash you have on hand.
I’m sure you’ve heard the well-worn expression, “Show me the money!” Well,
in business, that idea is the core of your success. Everything relies on your
cash profits that you can take out of your business or use to expand your
business.
212
Part IV: Preparing the Books for Year’s (or Month’s) End 

In Chapter 9, I discuss how a business proves out the cash taken in by each
of its cashiers. That daily process gives a business good control of the point
at which cash comes into the business from customers who buy the com-
pany’s products or services. It also measures any cash refunds that were
given to customers who returned items. But the points of sale and return
aren’t the only times cash comes into or goes out of the business.
If your business sells products on store credit (see Chapter 9), some of the
cash from customers is actually collected at a later point in time by the book-
keeping staff responsible for tracking customer credit accounts. And when
your business needs something, whether products to be sold or supplies
needed by various departments, you must pay cash to vendors, suppliers, and
contractors. Sometimes cash is paid out on the spot, but many times the bill is
recorded in the Accounts Payable account and paid at a later date. All these
transactions involve the use of cash, so the amount of cash on hand in the
business at any one time includes not only what’s in the cash registers but
also what’s on deposit in the company’s bank accounts. You need to know the
balances of those accounts and test those balances to be sure they’re accu-
rate and match what’s in your company’s books. I talk more about how to do
that in the section “Reconciling Bank Accounts” later in this chapter.
So your snapshot in time includes not only the cash on hand in your cash
registers but also any cash you may have in the bank. Some departments may
also have petty cash accounts, which means you total that cash as well. The
total cash figure is what you show as an asset named “Cash” on the first line
of your company’s financial statement, the balance sheet. The balance sheet
shows all that the company owns (its assets) and owes (its liabilities) as well
as the equity the owners have in the company. (I talk more about the balance
sheet and how you prepare one in Chapter 18.)
The actual cash you have on hand is just one tiny piece of the cash moving
through your business during the accounting period. The true detail of 
what cash has flowed into and out of the business is in your cash journals.
Closing those are the next step in the process of figuring out how well your
business did.
Closing the Cash Journals
As I explain in Chapter 5, if you keep the books manually, you can find a
record of every transaction that involves cash in one of two cash journals:
the Cash Receipts journal (cash that comes into the business) and the Cash
Disbursements journal (cash that goes out of the business).
213
Chapter 14: Proving Out the Cash

If you use a computerized accounting system, you don’t have these cash 
journals, but you have many different ways to find out the same detailed
information as they contain. You can run reports of sales by customer, by
item, or by sales representative. Figure 14-1 shows the types of sales reports
that QuickBooks can automatically generate for you. You can also run reports
that show you all the company’s purchases by vendor or by item as well as
list any purchases still on order. Figure 14-2 shows the various purchase reports
that QuickBooks can automatically run for you. These reports can be run
by the week, the month, the quarter, or the year, or you can customize the
reports to show a particular period of time that you’re analyzing. For exam-
ple, if you want to know what sales occurred between June 5 and 10, you can
run a report specifying the exact dates.
In addition to the sales and purchase reports shown in Figures 14-1 and 14-2,
you can generate other transaction detail reports including customers and
receivables; jobs, time, and mileage; vendors and payables; inventory;
employees and payroll; and banking (see the options listed on the left side 
of Figure 14-1). One big advantage of a computerized accounting system
when you’re trying to prove out your books is the number of different ways
you can develop reports to check for accuracy in your books if you suspect
an error.

Part IV: Preparing the Books for Year’s (or Month’s) End 

Finalizing cash receipts
If all your books are up-to-date, when you summarize the Cash Receipts jour-
nal on whatever day and time you choose to prove out your books, you
should come up with a total of all cash received by the business at that time.
Unfortunately, in the real world of bookkeeping, things don’t come out so
nice and neat. In fact, you probably wouldn’t even start entering the transac-
tions from that particular day into the books until the next day, when you
enter the cash reports from all cashiers and others who handle incoming
cash (such as the accounts receivable staff who collect money from cus-
tomers buying on credit) into the Cash Receipts journal.
After entering all the transactions from the day in question, the books for the
period you’re looking at may still be incomplete. Sometimes, adjustments or
corrections must be made to the ending cash numbers. For example, monthly
credit-card fees and interest received from the bank may not yet be recorded
in your cash journals. As the bookkeeper, you must be sure that all bank fees
related to cash receipts as well as any interest earned are recorded in the
Cash Receipts journal before you summarize the journals for the period
you’re analyzing.
Remembering credit-card fees
When your company allows customers to use credit cards, you must pay fees
to the bank that processes these transactions, which is probably the same
Figure 14-2:
Using
QuickBooks,

reports
showing
your
company’s

ments by

215
Chapter 14: Proving Out the Cash

bank that handles all your business accounts. These fees actually lower the
amount you take in as cash receipts, so the amount you record as a cash
receipts must be adjusted to reflect those costs of doing business. Monthly
credit-card fees vary greatly depending upon the bank you’re using, but here
are some of the most common fees your company may be charged:
 Address verification service (AVS) fee is a fee companies pay if they
want to avoid accepting fraudulent credit-card sales. Businesses that use
this service take orders by phone or e-mail and therefore don’t have the
credit card in hand to verify a customer’s signature. Banks charge this
fee for every transaction that’s verified.
 Discount rate is a fee all companies that use credit cards must pay; it’s
based on a percentage of the sale or return transaction. The rate your
company may be charged varies greatly depending on the type of busi-
ness you conduct and the volume of your sales each month. Companies
that use a terminal to swipe cards and electronically send transaction
information usually pay lower fees than companies that use paper
credit-card transactions because the electronic route creates less work
for the bank and eliminates the possibility of key-entry errors by
employees.
 Secure payment gateway fee, which allows the merchant to process
transactions securely, is charged to companies that transact business
over the Internet. If your business sells products online, you can expect
to pay this fee based on a set monthly amount.
 Customer support fee is charged to companies that want bank support
for credit-card transactions for 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Companies
such as mail-order catalogs that allow customers to place orders 24 hours
a day look for this support. Sometimes companies even want this sup-
port in more than one language if they sell products internationally.
 Monthly minimum fee is the least a business is required to pay for the
ability to offer its customers the convenience of using credit cards to
buy products. This fee usually varies between $10 and $30 per month.
Even if your company doesn’t generate any credit-card sales during a
month, you’re still required to pay this minimum fee. As long as enough
sales are generated to cover the fee, you shouldn’t have a problem. For
example, if the fee is $10 and your company pays 2 percent per sale in
discount fees, you need to sell at least $500 worth of products each
month to cover that $10 fee. When deciding whether to accept credit
cards as a payment option, be sure you’re confident that you’ll generate
enough business through credit-card sales to cover that fee. If not, you
may find that accepting credit cards costs you more than the sales you
generate by offering that convenience.
216
Part IV: Preparing the Books for Year’s (or Month’s) End 

 Transaction fee is a standard fee charged to your business for each
credit-card transaction you submit for authorization. You pay this fee
even if the cardholder is denied and you lose the sale.
 Equipment and software fees are charged to your company based on
the equipment and computer software you use in order to process credit-
card transactions. You have the option of buying or leasing credit-card
equipment and related software.
 Chargeback and retrieval fees are charged if a customer disputes a
transaction.
When deciding whether to accept credit cards as a form of payment, you
must consider what your competition is doing. If all your competitors offer
the convenience of using credit cards and you don’t, you may lose sales if
customers take their business elsewhere.
Reconciling your credit-card statements
Each month, the bank that handles your credit-card sales will send you a
statement listing
 All your company’s transactions for the month.
 The total amount your company sold through credit-card sales.
 The total fees charged to your account.
If you find a difference between what the bank reports was sold on credit
cards and what the company’s books show regarding credit-card sales, it’s
time to play detective and find the reason for the difference. In most cases,
the error involves the charging back of one or more sales because a customer
disputes the charge. In this case, the Cash Receipts journal is adjusted to
reflect that loss of sale, and the bank statement and company books should
match up.
For example, suppose $200 in credit-card sales were disputed. The original
entry of the transaction in the books should look like this:
Debit
Credit
Sales
$200
Cash
$200
To reverse disputed credit sales recorded in June.
This entry reduces the total Sales for the month as well as the amount of the
Cash account. If the dispute is resolved and the money is later retrieved, the
sale is then reentered when the cash is received.
217
Chapter 14: Proving Out the Cash

You also record any fees related to credit-card fees in the Cash Disbursements
journal. For example, if credit-card fees for the month of June total $200, the
entry in the books should look like this:
Debit
Credit
Credit-Card Fees
$200
Cash
$200
To reverse credit-card fees for the month of June.
Summarizing the Cash Receipts journal
When you’re sure that all cash receipts as well as any corrections or adjust-
ments to those receipts have been properly entered in the books (see the
previous two sections), you summarize the Cash Receipts journal as I explain
in detail in Chapter 5. After summarizing the Cash Receipts journal for the
accounting period you’re analyzing, you know the total cash that was taken
into the business from sales as well as from other channels.
In the Cash Receipts journal, sales usually appear in two columns:
 Sales: The cash shown in the Sales column is cash received when the
customer purchases the goods using cash, check, or bank credit card.
 Accounts Receivable: The Accounts Receivable column is for sales in
which no cash was received when the customer purchased the item.
Instead, the customer bought on credit and intends to pay cash at a
later date. (I talk more about Accounts Receivable and collecting money
from customers in Chapter 9.)
After you add all receipts to the Cash Receipts journal, entries for items
bought on store credit can be posted to the Accounts Receivable journal 
and the individual customer accounts. You then send bills to customers that
reflect all transactions from the month just closed as well as any payments
still due from previous months. Billing customers is a key part of the closing
process that occurs each month.
In addition to the Sales and Accounts Receivable columns, your Cash
Receipts journal should have at least two other columns:
 General: The General column lists all other cash received, such as
owner investments in the business.
 Cash: The Cash column contains the total of all cash received by the
business during an accounting period.
218
Part IV: Preparing the Books for Year’s (or Month’s) End 

Finalizing cash outlays
After you close the Cash Receipts journal (see “Summarizing the Cash
Receipts journal”), the next step is to close the Cash Disbursements journal.
Any adjustments related to outgoing cash receipts, such as bank credit-card
fees, should be added to the Cash Disbursements journal.
Before you close the journal, you must also be certain that any bills paid at
the end of the month have been added to the Cash Disbursements journal.
Bills that are related to financial activity for the month being closed but that
haven’t yet been paid have to be accrued, which means recorded in the books,
so they can be matched to the revenue for the month. These accruals are only
necessary if you use the accrual accounting method. If you use the cash-basis
accounting method, you only need to record the bills when cash is actually
paid. For more on the accrual and cash-basis methods, flip to Chapter 2.
You accrue bills yet to be paid in the Accounts Payable account. For example,
suppose that your company prints and mails fliers to advertise a sale during
the last week of the month. A bill for the fliers totaling $500 hasn’t been paid
yet. Here’s how you enter the bill in the books:
Debit
Credit
Advertising
$500
Accounts Payable
$500
To accrue the bill from Jack’s printing for June sales flyers.
This entry increases advertising expenses for the month and increases the
amount due in Accounts Payable. When you pay the bill, the Accounts
Payable account is debited (to reduce the liability), and the Cash account is
credited (to reduce the amount in the cash account). You make the actual
entry in the Cash Disbursements journal when the cash is paid out.
When proving out the cash, you should also review any accounts in which
expenses are accrued for later payment, such as Sales Taxes Collected, to 
be sure all accrual accounts are up-to-date. These tax accounts are actually
liability accounts for taxes that will need to be paid in the future. If you use
the accrual accounting method, the expenses related to these taxes must 
be matched to the revenues collected for the month they’re incurred.
219
Chapter 14: Proving Out the Cash

Using a Temporary Posting Journal
Some companies use a Temporary Posting journal to record payments that
are made without full knowledge of how the cash outlay should be posted
to the books and which accounts will be impacted. For example, a company
using a payroll service probably has to give that service a certain amount of
cash to cover payroll even if it’s not yet known exactly how much is needed
for taxes and other payroll-related costs.
In this payroll example, cash must be disbursed, but transactions can’t be
entered into all affected accounts until the payroll is done. Suppose a com-
pany’s payroll is estimated to cost $15,000 for the month of May. The company
sends a check to cover that cost to the payroll service and posts the payment
to the Temporary Posting journal, and after the payroll is calculated and com-
pleted, the company receives a statement of exactly how much was paid
to employees and how much was paid in taxes. After the statement arrives,
allocating the $15,000 to specific accounts such as Payroll Expenses or Tax
Expenses, that information is posted to the Cash Disbursements journal.
If you decide to keep a Temporary Posting journal to track cash coming in or
going out, before summarizing your Cash Disbursements journal and closing
the books for an accounting period, be sure to review the transactions listed
in this journal that may need to be posted in the Cash Disbursements journal.
Reconciling Bank Accounts
Part of proving out cash involves checking what you have in your bank
accounts actually matches what the bank thinks you have in those accounts.
This process is called reconciling the accounts.
Before you tackle reconciling your accounts with the bank’s records, it’s
important to be sure that you’ve made all necessary adjustments to your
books. When you make adjustments to your cash accounts, you identify and
correct any cash transactions that may not have been properly entered into
the books. You also make adjustments to reflect interest income or payments,
bank fees, and credit-card chargebacks.
If you’ve done everything right, your accounting records should match the
bank’s records when it comes to how much cash you have in your accounts.
The day you close your books probably isn’t the same date as the bank sends
its statements, so do your best at balancing the books internally without
actually reconciling your checking account. Correcting any problems during
the process of proving out, will minimize problems you may face reconciling
the cash accounts when that bank statement actually does arrive.
220
Part IV: Preparing the Books for Year’s (or Month’s) End 

You’ve probably reconciled your personal checking account at least a few
times over the years, and you’ll be happy to hear that reconciling business
accounts is a similar process. Table 14-1 shows one common format for rec-
onciling your bank account:

Tracking down errors
Ideally, your balance and the bank’s balance adjusted by transactions not 
yet shown on the statement should match. If they don’t, you need to find 
out why.
 If the bank balance is higher than your balance, check to be sure that
all the deposits listed by the bank appear in the Cash account in your
books. If you find that the bank lists a deposit that you don’t have, you
need to do some detective work to figure out what that deposit was for
and add the detail to your accounting records. Also, check to be sure
that all checks have cleared. Your balance may be missing a check that
should have been listed in outstanding checks.
 If the bank balance is lower than your balance, check to be sure that
all checks listed by the bank are recorded in your Cash account. You
may have missed one or two checks that were written but not properly
recorded. You also may have missed a deposit that you have listed in
your Cash account and you thought the bank already should have
shown as a deposit, but it was not yet on the statement. If you notice a
missing deposit on the bank statement, be sure you have your proof of
deposit and check with the bank to be sure the cash is in the account.
221
Chapter 14: Proving Out the Cash

 If all deposits and checks are correct but you still see a difference,
your only option is to check your math and make sure all checks and
deposits were entered correctly.
Sometimes, you have to decide whether rooting out every little difference is
really worth the time it takes. If it’s just a matter of pennies, you probably don’t
need to waste your time trying to find the error, and you can just adjust the 
balance in your books. But if the difference is a significant amount for your busi-
ness, you should try to track it down. You never know exactly what accounts
are impacted by an error or how that difference may impact your profit or loss.
Using a computerized system
If you use a computerized accounting system, reconciliation should be much
easier than if you were keeping your books manually. In QuickBooks, for
example, when you start the reconciliation process, a screen pops up in
which you can add the ending bank statement balance and any bank fees
or interest earned. Figure 14-3 shows you that screen. In this example, I’ve
added $30,000 as the ending balance and $10 in bank fees. (The bank fees
are automatically added to the bank fees expense account.)
After you click Continue, you get a screen that lists all checks written since
the last reconciliation as well as all deposits. You put a check mark next to
the checks and deposits that have cleared on the bank statement, as I’ve
done in Figure 14-4, and then click Reconcile Now.

222

QuickBooks automatically reconciles the accounts and provides reports that
indicate any differences. It also provides a reconciliation summary, shown in
Figure 14-5, that includes the beginning balance, the balance after all cleared
transactions have been recorded, and a list of all uncleared transactions.
QuickBooks also calculates what your check register should show when the
uncleared transactions are added to the cleared transactions.

Chapter 14: Proving Out the Cash

Posting Adjustments and Corrections
After you close out the Cash Receipts and Cash Disbursements journals as
well as reconcile the bank account with your accounting system, you post
any adjustments or corrections that you uncover to any other journals that
may be impacted by the change, such as the Accounts Receivable or
Accounts Payable. If you make changes that don’t impact any journal
accounts, you post them directly to the General Ledger.
For example, if you find that several customer payments haven’t been entered
in the Cash Receipts journal, you also need to post those payments to the
Accounts Receivable journal and the customers’ accounts. The same is true 
if you find payments on outstanding bills that haven’t been entered into the
books. In this case, you post the payments to the Accounts Payable journal 
as well as to the individual vendors’ accounts.

Chapter 15
Closing the Journals
In This Chapter
 Making sure your journals are correct
 Gathering journal information for closing
 Posting adjustments to the General Ledger
 Examining your journals in a computerized system
A
s the old saying goes, “The devil is in the details.” When it comes to
your bookkeeping, especially if you keep your books manually, those
details are in the journals you keep. And those small details can get you
every time.
If you use a computerized accounting system to do your books, you don’t
need to close out your journals, but you can still run a series of reports to
verify that all the information in the computer accounting system matches
what you have on paper. I talk about how to do that briefly in this chapter.
This chapter focuses primarily on how to prove out your journals and close
them at the end of an accounting period. (Chapter 14 looks at this process for
cash journals in particular, if you’re interested.) You also find out how to post
all corrections and adjustments, to the General Ledger after you make them
in the appropriate journal. (To find out how to set up your journals, flip to
Chapter 5.)
Prepping to Close: Checking for Accuracy
and Tallying Things Up
As you prepare to close the books, you first need to total what is in your jour-
nals, which is called summarizing the journals. During the process, it’s a good
idea to look for blatant errors and be sure that the entries accurately reflect
the transactions during the accounting period.

Even the smallest error in a journal can cause a lot of frustration when you
try to run a trial balance and close out your books, so it’s best to do a thor-
ough search for errors as you close out each journal for the month. It’s much
easier to find an error at this point in the closing process than to try to track
it back through all your various accounts.
Paying attention to initial 
transaction details
Do a quick check to be sure the transaction details in your journals are accu-
rate. Chapter 14 tells you how to do this type of check with the cash journals,
but when you follow the rules of accrual accounting, not all transactions
involve cash. In accrual accounting, noncash transactions can include cus-
tomer purchases made on store credit (which you track in the Accounts
Receivable journal) and bills you will pay in the future (which you track in
the Accounts Payable journal). You may also have created other journals to
track transactions in your most active accounts, and you probably also keep
details about sales in the Sales journal and payroll in the Payroll journal.
In the Payroll journal, make sure that all payrolls for the month have been
added with all the proper details about salaries, wages, and taxes. Also 
verify that you’ve recorded all employer taxes that need to be paid. These
taxes include the employer’s portion of Medicare and Social Security as 
well as unemployment taxes. (I talk more about employer tax obligations 
in Chapter 11.)
Summarizing journal entries
The first step in checking for accuracy in your journals is summarizing them,
which I explain in Chapter 5, which is primarily totaling all the columns in 
the journal. This summary process gives you totals for the accounts being
tracked by each journal. For example, summarizing the Accounts Receivable
journal gives you a grand total of all transactions for that period that involved
customer credit accounts. Figure 15-1 shows a summary of an Accounts
Receivable journal.
The Accounts Receivable journal includes transactions from the Sales journal
(where customer purchases on store credit first appear) and the Cash Receipts
journal (where customers’ payments toward their store credit accounts first
appear) as well as any credit memos for customer returns. The example in
Figure 15-1 is only a few lines long, but, in most companies, the Accounts
Receivable journal is very active with transactions posted every day the store
226
Part IV: Preparing the Books for Year’s (or Month’s) End 

is open during the month. When you summarize the Accounts Receivable jour-
nal, you get a closing balance, a balance that shows the total of all financial
activity recorded in that journal. Figure 15-1 shows a closing balance of $2,240,
which is the amount outstanding from customers.
Figure 15-1:
A sample

227
Chapter 15: Closing the Journals

Each transaction in the journal should have a reference number next to it,
which tells you where the detail for that transaction first appears in the
books. You may need to review this information later when you’re proving
out the books. When you check for errors in the journal, you may need to
review the original source information used to enter some transactions in
order to double-check that entry’s accuracy.
In addition to the Accounts Receivable journal, you also have individual jour-
nal pages for each customer; these pages detail each customer’s purchases
on store credit and any payments made toward those purchases. At the end
of an accounting period, prepare an aging summary detailing all outstanding
customer accounts. This report shows you what money is due from cus-
tomers and how long it has been due. (I talk more about managing customer
accounts in Chapter 9.)
For the purpose of proving out the books, the aging report is a quick summary
that ensures that the customer accounts information matches what’s in the
Accounts Receivable journal. Table 15-1 shows what an aging summary would
look like for the time period.

In this sample Accounts Receivable Aging Summary, the total amount out-
standing from customers matches the balance total in the Accounts Receivable
journal. Therefore, all customer accounts have been accurately entered in the
books, and the bookkeeper shouldn’t encounter any errors related to customer
accounts when running a trial balance, which I explain in Chapter 16.
If you find a difference between the information in your journal and your aging
summary, review your customer account transactions to find the problem.
An error may be the result of
 Recording a sales transaction without recording the details of that trans-
action in the customer’s account.
 Recording a purchase directly into the customer’s account without add
the purchase amount to the Accounts Receivable journal.
228
Part IV: Preparing the Books for Year’s (or Month’s) End 

 Recording a customer’s payment in the customer’s account without
recording the cash receipt in the Accounts Receivable journal.
 Recording a customer’s payment in the Accounts Receivable journal
without recording the cash receipt in the customer’s account record.
The process of summarizing and closing out the Accounts Payable journal is
similar to that of the Accounts Receivable journal. For Accounts Payable, you
can prepare an aging summary for your outstanding bills as well. That sum-
mary should look something like Table 15-2.

The total of outstanding bills on the Accounts Payable Aging Summary should
match the total shown on the Accounts Payable journal summary for the
accounting period. If yours match, you’re ready for a trial balance. If they
don’t, you must figure out the reason for the difference before closing out the
Accounts Payable journal. The problem may be the result of
 Recording a bill due in the Accounts Payable journal without recording it
in the vendor’s account.
 Recording a bill due in the vendor’s account without recording it in the
Accounts Payable journal.
 Making a payment to the vendor without recording it in the Accounts
Payable journal.
 Making a payment to the vendor and recording it in the Accounts
Payable journal but neglecting to record it in the vendor’s account.
Correct any problems you find before closing out the journal. If you know
that you may be working with incorrect data, you don’t want to try to do a
trial balance because you know that balance will be filed with errors and you
won’t be able to generate accurate financial reports. Also, if you know errors
exist, it’s like the books won’t balance anyway, so it’s just a wasted exercise
to do a trial balance.

Chapter 15: Closing the Journals

Analyzing summary results
You may be wondering how you can find problems in your records by just
reviewing a page in a journal. Well, that skill comes with experience and prac-
tice. As you summarize your journals each month, you’ll become familiar
with the expected level of transactions and the types of transaction that
occur month after month. If you don’t see a transaction that you expect to
find, take the time to research the transaction to find out why it’s missing. 
It’s possible that the transaction didn’t take place, but it’s also possible 
that someone forgot to record it.
For example, suppose that when summarizing the Payroll journal, you notice
that the payroll for the 15th of the month seems lower than normal. As you
check your details for that payroll, you find that the amount paid to hourly
employees was recorded, but someone didn’t record the amount paid to
salaried employees. For that particular payroll, the payroll company experi-
enced a computer problem after running some checks and as a result sent
the final report on two separate pages. The person who recorded the payroll
numbers didn’t realize there was a separate page for salaried employees, so
the final numbers entered into the books didn’t reflect the full amount paid 
to employees.
As you close the books each month, you’ll get an idea of the numbers you
can expect for each type of journal. After a while, you’ll be able to pick out
problems just by scanning a page — no detailed research required!
Planning for cash flow
The process you go through each month as you prepare to close your books
helps you plan for future cash flow. Reviewing the Accounts Receivable and
Accounts Payable Aging Summaries tells you what additional cash you can
expect from customers during the next few months and how much cash
you’ll need in order to pay bills for the next few months.
If you notice that your Accounts Payable Aging Summary indicates that 
more and more bills are slipping into past-due status, you may need to find
another source for cash, such as a credit line from the bank. For example, the
Accounts Payable Aging Summary reveals that three key vendors — Helen’s
Paper Goods, Henry’s Bakery Supplies, and Plates Unlimited — haven’t been
paid on time. Late payments can hurt your business’s working relationship
with vendors; they may refuse to deliver goods unless cash is paid upfront.
And if you can’t get the raw materials you need, you may have trouble filling
customer orders on time. The lesson here is to act quickly and find a way to
improve cash flow before your vendors cut you off. (For more on Accounts
Payable management, check out Chapter 8.)
230
Part IV: Preparing the Books for Year’s (or Month’s) End 

You may also find that your Accounts Receivable Aging Summary reveals that
certain previously good customers are gradually becoming slow or nonpay-
ing customers. For example, J. Doe’s account is past due, and at least some
portion of his account is overdue by more than 60 days. The bookkeeper
dealing with these accounts may need to consider putting a hold on that
account until payment is received in full. (For more on Accounts Receivable
management, check out Chapter 9.)
Posting to the General Ledger
An important part of closing your books is posting to the General Ledger any
corrections or adjustments you find as you close the journals. This type of
posting consists of a simple entry that summarizes any changes you found.
For example, suppose you find that a customer purchase was recorded
directly in the customer’s account record but not in the Accounts Receivable
journal. You have to research how that transaction was originally recorded. If
the only record was a note in the customer’s account, both the Sales account
and the Accounts Receivable account are affected by the mistake, and the
correcting entry looks like this:
Debit
Credit
Accounts Receivable
$100
Sales
$100
To record sale to J. Doe on 3/15/2005 — corrected 3/31/2005.
If you find this type of error, the Sales transaction record for that date of sale
isn’t accurate, which means that someone bypassed your standard book-
keeping process when recording the sale. You may want to research that part
of the issue as well because there may be more than just a recording problem
behind this incident. Someone in your company may be allowing customers
to take product, purposefully not recording the sale appropriately in your
books, and pocketing the money instead. It’s also possible that a salesperson
recorded a sale for a customer that never took place. If that’s the case and
you bill the customer, he would likely question the bill, and you’d find out
about the problem at that point.
The process of proving out your journals, or any other part of your book-
keeping records, is a good opportunity to review your internal controls as
well. As you find errors during the process of proving out the books, keep an
eye out for ones (probably similar errors that appear frequently) that may
indicate bigger problems than just bookkeeping mistakes. Repeat errors may
231
Chapter 15: Closing the Journals

call for additional staff training to be sure your bookkeeping rules are being
followed to a T. Or such errors may be evidence that someone in the com-
pany is deliberately recording false information. Whatever the explanation,
you need to take corrective action. (I cover internal controls in depth in
Chapter 7.)
Checking Out Computerized 
Journal Records
Although you don’t have to close out journal pages if you keep your books
using a computerized accounting system, running a spot-check (at the very
least) of what you have in your paper records versus what you have on your
computer is a smart move. Simply run a series of reports using your comput-
erized accounting system and then check to be sure that those computer
records match what you have in your files.
For example, in QuickBooks, go to the Report Navigator and click on Vendors
& Payables. The first section of the navigator page, shown in Figure 15-2, is
called A/P Aging (due and overdue bills). This section offers three possible
reports: Summary, which shows how much is due for each vendor; Detail,
which gives a list of bills due and overdue; and an Accounts Payable Graph
that illustrates your outstanding bills.

232
Part IV: Preparing the Books for Year’s (or Month’s) End 

Figure 15-3 shows you the kind of detail you get when you select the Detail
report. The Detail report is divided into:
 Current bills
 Bills overdue by 1 to 30 days
 Bills overdue by 31 to 60 days
 Bills overdue by 61 to 90 days
 Bills overdue by more than 90 days
Obviously, anything in the last two columns — overdue by more than 
60 days — is bad news. You can expect a supplier or vendor whose bills
appear in these columns to soon cut you off from additional credit until
your account is up-to-date.
In addition to locating your bill-paying problem areas, you can also use the
information in the Detail report to verify that the paper bills you have waiting
to be paid in vendor files match what you have on your computer. You don’t
need to check each and every bill, but it’s a good idea to do a spot-check of
several bills. The goal is to verify the accuracy of your records as well as
make sure that no one’s entering and paying duplicate or nonexistent bills.

Chapter 15: Closing the Journals

When it comes to cash flow out of the business, keep tight controls on who
can actually sign checks and how the information that explains those checks
is recorded. In Chapter 7, I talk more about the importance of separating
duties to protect each aspect of your bookkeeping system from corruption.
You can also run reports showing the information recorded in your Accounts
Receivable account. Figure 15-4 shows you a list of possible reports to run
from the Customers & Receivables page. In addition to the Summary, Detail,
and Accounts Receivable Graph, you can also run a report for Open Invoices,
which lists outstanding customer invoices or statements, and Collections,
which lists not only overdue customers but also how much they owe and
their contact information.
Again, running spot-checks on a few customer accounts to be sure your
paper records of their accounts match the information in your computerized
system is a good idea. There’s always a chance that a customer’s purchase
was entered in error in the computer, and you could end up sending the bill
to the wrong person.
Some companies double-check their Accounts Receivable bookkeeping for
accuracy by sending surveys to customers periodically (usually twice a year)
to see if their accounts are correct. If you choose to do this, include with the
customer’s bill a postage-paid card asking if the account is correct and giving
the customer room to indicate any account problems before mailing the card
Figure 15-4:

back to your company. In most cases, a customer who has been incorrectly
billed will contact you soon after getting that bill — especially if he or she
has been billed for more than anticipated.
In addition to keeping actual accounts, such as Accounts Payable or Accounts
Receivable, your computerized accounting system keeps a journal of all your
company’s transactions. This journal contain(s) details about all your transac-
tions over a specified time period and the accounts that were impacted by
each transaction. Figure 15-5 is a sample computerized journal page.
If you need to be reminded of how you recorded a transaction into your com-
puterized accounting system, run the Journal report by date, isolating all
transactions that took place at a particular time. Running a report by date
can be a helpful tool if you’re trying to locate the source of an error in your
books; if you find a questionable transaction, you can open the detail of that
transaction and see how it was entered and where you can find the original
source material.

Checking Your Accuracy — By
Trial and Hopefully No Error
In This Chapter
 Putting your balances on trial
 Finding and correcting errors
 Preparing a worksheet
 Generating reports from your computerized system
A
fter you close out all your journals and do your darndest to catch any
and all errors (flip back to Chapter 15 for instructions on how to do
this), the time comes to test your work. If you’ve entered all double-entry
transactions in the books correctly, the books balance out, and your trial’s a
success!
Unfortunately, few bookkeepers get their books to balance on the first try.
And in some cases, the books balance, but errors still exist. This chapter
explains how you do a trial balance of your books and gives tips on finding
any errors that may be lurking. You also find out how to take your first step
to developing financial reports, which I explain in Part V, by creating a 
worksheet.
Working with a Trial Balance
When you first start entering transactions in a dual-entry accounting system,
you may think, “This is a lot of work, and I don’t know how I’m ever going to
use all this information.” You enter all your transactions using debits and
credits without knowing whether they’ll actually produce useful financial
information that you can use to gauge how well your business is doing. It’s
not until after you close your journals and prepare your first set of financial
reports that you truly see the value of double-entry accounting. Trust me.

The first step toward useable reports that help you interpret your financial
results is doing a trial balance. Basically, a trial balance is a worksheet prepared
manually or spit out by your computer accounting system that lists all the
accounts in your General Ledger at the end of an accounting period (whether
that’s at the end of a month, the end of a quarter, or the end of a year).
Conducting your trial balance
If you’ve been entering transactions manually, you create a trial balance by
listing all the accounts with their ending debit or credit balances. (I talk more
about debits and credits in Chapter 2.) After preparing the list, you total both
the debit and credit columns. If the totals at the bottom of the two columns
are the same, the trial is a success, and your books are in balance.
The primary purpose of the trial balance is to prove that, at least mathemati-
cally, your debits and credits are equal. If any errors exist in your calculations
or in how you summarized the journals or posted the summaries to the
General Ledger, they’re uncovered in the trial balance when the columns
don’t come out equal. Also, if you entered any transactions out of balance,
you see the mistake when you add the columns of the trial balance.
The four basic steps to developing a trial balance are
1. Prepare a worksheet with three columns: one for account titles, one
for debits, and one for credits.
2. Fill in all the account titles and record their balances in the appropri-
ate debit or credit columns.
3. Total the debit and credit columns.
4. Compare the column totals.
Figure 16-1 shows a sample trial balance for a company as of May 31, 2005.
Note that the debit column and the credit column both equal $57,850, making
this a successful trial balance.
A successful trial balance is no guarantee that your books are totally free of
errors; it just means that all your transactions have been entered in balance.
You still may have errors in the books related to how you entered your trans-
actions, including:
 You forgot to put a transaction in a journal or in the General Ledger.
 You forgot to post a journal entry to the General Ledger.
238
Part IV: Preparing the Books for Year’s (or Month’s) End 

 You posted a journal entry twice in either the General Ledger or in the
journal itself.
 You posted the wrong amount.
 You posted a transaction to the wrong account.

Chapter 16: Checking Your Accuracy — By Trial and Hopefully No Error

If, by chance, the errors listed here slip through the cracks, there’s a good
chance that someone will notice the discrepancy when the financial reports
are prepared.
Even with these potentially lurking errors, the trial balance is a useful tool
and the essential first step in developing your financial reports.
Dealing with trial balance errors
If your trial balance isn’t correct, you need to work backwards in your closing
process to find the source of the mathematical error. When you need to find
errors after completing a trial balance that fails, follow these four basic steps
to identify and fix the problem. And remember, this is why all bookkeepers
and accountants work with pencils, not pens — pencils make erasing mis-
takes and making corrections much easier.
1. Check your math. Keep your fingers crossed, and add up your columns
again to be sure the error isn’t just one of addition. That’s the simplest
kind of error to find. Correct the addition mistake and re-total your
columns.
2. Compare your balances. Double-check the balances on the trial balance
worksheet by comparing them to the totals from your journals and your
General Ledger. Be sure you didn’t make an error when transferring the
account balances to the trial balance. Correcting this type of problem
isn’t very difficult or time-consuming. Simply correct the incorrect bal-
ances, and add up the trial balance columns again.
3. Check your journal summaries. Double-check the math in all your jour-
nal summaries, making sure that all totals are correct and that any totals
you posted to the General Ledger are correct. Running this kind of a
check, of course, is somewhat time-consuming, but it’s still better than
rechecking all your transactions. If you do find errors in your journal
summaries, correct them, reenter the totals correctly, change the num-
bers on the trial balance worksheet to match your corrected totals, and
retest your trial balance.
4. Check your journal and General Ledger entries. Unfortunately, if Steps
1, 2, and 3 fail to fix your problem, all that’s left is to go back and check
your actual transaction entries. The process can be time-consuming, but
the information in your books isn’t useful until your debits equal your
credits.
If this step is your last resort, scan through your entries looking specifi-
cally for ones that appear questionable. For example, if you see an entry
for office supplies that’s much larger or much smaller than you normally
expect, check the original source material for that entry to be sure it’s
correct. If you carefully proved out the Accounts Payable and Accounts
240
Part IV: Preparing the Books for Year’s (or Month’s) End 

Receivable journals as I explain in Chapters 14 and 15, you can concen-
trate your efforts on accounts with separate journals. After you find and
correct the error or errors, run another trial balance. If things still don’t
match up, repeat the steps listed here until your debits and credits 
equal out.
You can always go back and correct the books and do another trial balance
before you prepare the financial reports. Don’t close the books for the account-
ing period until the financial reports are completed and accepted. I talk more
about the closing process in Chapter 22.
Testing Your Balance Using
Computerized Accounting Systems
If you use a computerized accounting system, your trial balance is auto-
matically generated for you. Because the system allows you to enter only
transactions that are in balance, the likelihood that your trial balance won’t
be successful is pretty slim. But that doesn’t mean your accounts are guaran-
teed error-free.
Remember the saying, “Garbage in, garbage out?” If you make a mistake when
you enter transaction data into the system, even if the data’s in balance, the
information that comes out will also be in error. Although you don’t have to
go through the correction steps covered in the earlier section “Dealing with
trial balance errors” to reach a successful trial balance, you still may have
errors lurking in your data.
In QuickBooks, the trial balance report is the first report on the Report
Navigator’s Accountant & Taxes page, which appears in Figure 16-2. In addi-
tion to the trial balance, you can request a report showing the General
Ledger, transaction detail by account, journal detail, voided transactions, 
and transactions by date.
Your business’s accountant is likely to use many of the report options on 
the Accountant & Taxes page to double-check that your transactions were
entered correctly and that no one is playing with the numbers. In particular,
the accountant may use a report option called Audit Trail, which reveals what
changes impacted the company’s books during an accounting period and
who made those changes.
241

Although it doesn’t match the trial balance done manually in Figure 16-1, the
QuickBooks trial balance shown in Figure 16-3 gives you an idea of what a
computerized accounting trial balance looks like.

Developing a Financial 
Statement Worksheet
After your accounts successfully pass a trial balance test (see “Conducting
your trial balance” earlier in this chapter), you can then take your first stab at
creating financial statements, including balance sheets and income statements.
The first step in producing these statements is using the information from the
trial balance and its corrections to develop a worksheet that includes the initial
trial balance, the accounts that would be shown on a balance sheet, and finally
the accounts that would normally be shown on an income statement.
You create the worksheet that includes these seven columns:
 Column 1: Account list
 Columns 2 and 3: Trial balance (one column for debits, one column 
for credits)
 Columns 4 and 5: Balance sheet (one column for debits, one column 
for credits)
 Columns 6 and 7: Income statement (one column for debits, one column
for credits)
In Figure 16-4, you can see a sample of a worksheet developed from trial bal-
ance numbers. Note that the numbers of the trial balance are transferred to
the appropriate financial statement; for example, the Cash account, which is
an asset account, is shown in the debit column of the balance sheet. (I talk
more about developing financial statements in Chapters 18 and 19.)
After you transfer all the accounts to their appropriate balance sheet or
income statement columns, you total the worksheet columns. Don’t panic
when you see that the totals at the bottom of your columns aren’t equal —
it’s because the net income hasn’t been calculated yet. However, the difference
between the debits and credits in both the balance sheet and the income
statement totals should be the same. That amount should represent the net
income that will appear on the income statement. (You’ll see what I mean
about net income when I develop the income statement in Chapter 19.)
In Figure 16-4, the $4,500 difference for the balance sheet is shown as a 
credit, representing an increase in Retained Earnings. The Retained Earnings
account reflects the profits that have been reinvested into the company’s
assets in order to grow the company. You can find more about Retained
Earnings in Chapter 18.
243
Chapter 16: Checking Your Accuracy — By Trial and Hopefully No Error

In some incorporated companies, part of the earnings are taken out in the
form of dividends paid to stockholders. Dividends are a portion of the earnings
divided up among stockholders. The board of directors of the corporation set
a certain amount per share to be paid to stockholders.
Many other small companies that haven’t incorporated pay out earnings to
their owners using a Drawing account, which tracks any cash taken out by
the owners. Each owner should have his or her own Drawing account so that
you have a history of how much each owner withdraws from the company’s
resources.

Replacing Worksheets with 
Computerized Reports
If you use a computerized accounting system, you don’t have to create a
worksheet at all. Instead, the system gives you the option of generating many
different types of reports to help you develop your income statement and
balance sheet.
One of the advantages of your computerized system’s reports is that you can
easily look at your numbers in many different ways. For example, Figure 16-5
shows the Company & Financial Report Navigator from QuickBooks. Notice
that you can generate so many different reports that the entire list doesn’t
even fit on one computer screen! To get the report you want, all you need to
do is click on the report title.
You can generate a number of different reports within the following categories:
 Profit & Loss (income statement): Some key reports in this section
include
• A standard report that shows how much the company made or lost
during a specific period of time
• A detail report that includes all the year-to-date transactions
Figure 16-5:

245
Chapter 16: Checking Your Accuracy — By Trial and Hopefully No Error

• A report that compares year-to-date figures with the previous year
(provided you kept the accounts using the computerized system in
the previous year)
 Income & Expenses: Some key reports in this section include
• Income by customer (both a summary and a detailed report)
• Expenses by vendor (both a summary and a detailed report)
 Balance Sheet & Net Worth: Some key reports in this section include
• A standard balance sheet showing a summary of assets, liabilities,
and equity
• A detail report of assets, liabilities, and equity
• A report that compares the assets, liabilities, and equity levels
with those of the previous year
 Cash Flow: Some key reports in this section include
• A statement of cash flows for the year
• A forecast of cash flows during the next few weeks or months
based on money due in accounts receivable and money to be paid
out in accounts payable
Computerized accounting systems provide you with the tools to manipulate
your company’s numbers in whatever way you find useful for analyzing your
company’s results. And if a report isn’t quite right for your needs, you can
customize it. For example, if you want to see the profit and loss results for a
particular week during an accounting period, you can set the dates for only
that week and generate the report. You can also produce a report looking at
data for just one day, one month, one quarter, or any combination of dates.
You can also take the time to custom design reports that meet your company’s
unique financial information needs. Many companies customize reports to
collect information by department or division. You’re only limited by your
imagination!
As you work with your computerized system, you’ll be asked for information
not easily found using standardized reports. The first few times you pull that
information together, you may need to do so manually. But as you get used to
your computerized accounting system and its report functions, you’ll be able
to design customized reports that pull together information in just the way
you need it.

Chapter 17
Adjusting the Books
In This Chapter
 Making adjustments for noncash transactions
 Taking your adjustments for a trial (balance) run
 Adding to and deleting from the Chart of Accounts
D
uring an accounting period, your bookkeeping duties focus on your 
business’s day-to-day transactions. When it comes time to report those
transactions in financial statements, you must make some adjustments to your
books. Your financial reports are supposed to show your company’s financial
health, so your books must reflect any significant change in the value of your
assets, even if that change doesn’t involve the exchange of cash.
If you use cash-basis accounting, these adjustments aren’t necessary because
you only record transactions when cash changes hands. I talk about accrual
and cash-basis accounting in Chapter 2.
This chapter reviews the types of adjustments you need to make to the books
before preparing the financial statements, including calculating asset depreci-
ation, dividing up prepaid expenses, updating inventory numbers, dealing
with bad debt, and recognizing salaries and wages not yet paid. You also find
out how to add and delete accounts.
Adjusting All the Right Areas
Even after testing your books using the trial balance process that I explain 
in Chapter 16, you still need to make some adjustments before you’re able 
to prepare accurate financial reports with the information you have. These
adjustments don’t involve the exchange of cash but rather involve recogniz-
ing the use of assets, loss of assets, or future asset obligations that aren’t
reflected in day-to-day bookkeeping activities.

The key areas in which you likely need to adjust the books include:
 Asset depreciation: To recognize the use of assets during the account-
ing period.
 Prepaid expenses: To match a portion of expenses that were paid at one
point during the year, but benefits from that payment are used through-
out the year, such as an annual insurance premium. The benefit should
be apportioned out against expenses for each month.
 Inventory: To update inventory to reflect what you have on hand.
 Bad debts: To acknowledge that some customers will never pay and to
write off those accounts.
 Unpaid salaries and wages: To recognize salary and wage expenses that
have been incurred but not yet paid.
Depreciating assets
The largest noncash expense for most businesses is depreciation. Depreciation
is an accounting exercise that’s important for every business to undertake
because it reflects the use and aging of assets. Older assets need more mainte-
nance and repair and also need to be replaced eventually. As the depreciation
of an asset increases and the value of the asset dwindles, the need for more
maintenance or replacement becomes apparent. (For more on depreciation
and why you do it, check out Chapter 12.)
The time to actually make this adjustment to the books is when you close 
the books for an accounting period. (Some businesses record depreciation
expenses every month to more accurately match monthly expenses with
monthly revenues, but most business owners only worry about depreciation
adjustments on a yearly basis, when they prepare their annual financial 
statements.)
Depreciation doesn’t involve the use of cash. By accumulating depreciation
expenses on an asset, you’re reducing the value of the asset as shown on the
balance sheet (see Chapter 18 for the lowdown on balance sheets).
Readers of your financial statements can get a good idea of the health of your
assets by reviewing your accumulated depreciation. If a financial report
reader sees that assets are close to being fully depreciated, he knows that
you’ll probably need to spend significant funds on replacing or repairing
those assets sometime soon. As he evaluates the financial health of the 
company, he takes that future obligation into consideration before making 
a decision to loan money to the company or possibly invest in it.
248
Part IV: Preparing the Books for Year’s (or Month’s) End 

Usually, you calculate depreciation for accounting purposes using the
straight-line depreciation method. This method is used to calculate an amount
to be depreciated that will be equal each year based on the anticipated useful
life of the asset. For example, suppose your company purchases a car for
business purposes that costs $25,000. You anticipate that car will have a
useful lifespan of five years and will be worth $5,000 after five years. Using
the straight-line depreciation method, you subtract $5,000 from the total car
cost of $25,000 to find the value of the car during its five-year useful lifespan
($20,000). Then, you divide $20,000 by 5 to find your depreciation expense for
the car ($4,000 per year). When adjusting the assets at the end of each year
in the car’s five-year lifespan, your entry to the books should look like this:
Debit
Credit
Depreciation Expense
$4,000
Accumulated Depreciation: Vehicles
$4,000
To record depreciation for Vehicles.
This entry increases depreciation expenses, which appear on the income
statement (see Chapter 19). The entry also increases Accumulated
Depreciation, which is the use of the asset and appears on the balance sheet
directly under the Vehicles asset line. The Vehicle asset line always shows the
value of the asset at the time of purchase.
You can speed up depreciation if you believe that the asset will not be used
evenly over its lifespan — namely, that the asset will be used more heavily in
the early years of ownership. I talk more about alternative depreciation meth-
ods in Chapter 12.
If you use a computerized accounting system as opposed to keeping your
books manually, you may or may not need to make this adjustment at the end
of an accounting period. If your system is set up with an asset management
feature, depreciation is automatically calculated, and you don’t have to worry
about it. Check with your accountant (he or she is the one who would set up
the asset management feature) before calculating and recording depreciation
expenses.
Allocating prepaid expenses
Most businesses have to pay certain expenses at the beginning of the year
even though they will benefit from that expense throughout the year. Insurance
is a prime example of this type of expense. Most insurance companies require
you to pay the premium annually at the start of the year even though the value
of that insurance protects the company throughout the year.
249
Chapter 17: Adjusting the Books

For example, suppose your company’s annual car insurance premium is
$1,200. You pay that premium in January in order to maintain insurance cov-
erage throughout the year. Showing the full cash expense of your insurance
when you prepare your January financial reports would greatly reduce any
profit that month and make your financial results look worse than the actu-
ally are. That’s no good.
Instead, you record a large expense such as insurance or prepaid rent as an
asset called Prepaid Expenses, and then you adjust the value of that asset
to reflect that it’s being used up. Your $1,200 annual insurance premium is
actually valuable to the company for 12 months, so you calculate the actual
expense for insurance by dividing $1,200 by 12, giving you $100 per month. 
At the end of each month, you record the use of that asset by preparing an
adjusting entry that looks like this:
Debit
Credit
Insurance Expenses
$100
Prepaid Expenses
$100
To record insurance expenses for March.
This entry increases insurance expenses on the income statement and
decreases the asset Prepaid Expenses on the balance sheet. No cash changes
hands in this entry because cash was laid out when the insurance bill was
paid, and the asset account Prepaid Expenses was increased in value at the
time the cash was paid.
Counting inventory
Inventory is a balance sheet asset that needs to be adjusted at the end of an
accounting period. During the accounting period, your company buys inven-
tory and records those purchases in a Purchases account without indicating
any change to inventory. When the products are sold, you record the sales in
the Sales account but don’t make any adjustment to the value of the inven-
tory. Instead, you adjust the inventory value at the end of the accounting
period because adjusting with each purchase and sale would be much too
time-consuming.
The steps for making proper adjustments to inventory in your books are as
follows:
1. Determine the inventory remaining.
In addition to calculating ending inventory using the purchases and
sales numbers in the books, you should also do a physical count of
inventory to be sure that what’s on the shelves matches what’s in the
books.
250
Part IV: Preparing the Books for Year’s (or Month’s) End 

2. Set a value for that inventory.
The value of ending inventory varies depending on the method your
company has chosen to use for valuing inventory. I talk more about
inventory value and how to calculate the value of ending inventory in
Chapter 8.
3. Adjust the number of pieces remaining in inventory in the Inventory
Account and adjust the value of that account based on the information
collected in Steps 1 and 2.
If you track inventory using your computerized accounting system, the system
makes adjustments to inventory as you record sales. At the end of the account-
ing period, the value of your company’s ending inventory should be adjusted in
the books already. Although the work’s already done for you, you should still
do a physical count of the inventory to be sure that your computer records
match the physical inventory at the end of the accounting period.
Allowing for bad debts
No company likes to accept the fact that it will never see the money owed by
some of its customers, but, in reality, that’s what happens to most companies
that sell items on store credit. When your company determines that a cus-
tomer who has bought products on store credit will never pay for them, you
record the value of that purchase as a bad debt. (For an explanation of store
credit, check out Chapter 9.)
At the end of an accounting period, you should list all outstanding customer
accounts in an aging report, which I cover in Chapter 9. This report shows
which customers owe how much and for how long. After a certain amount
of time, you have to admit that some customers simply aren’t going to pay.
Each company sets its own determination of how long it wants to wait before
tagging an account as a bad debt. For example, your company may decide
that when a customer is six months late with a payment, you’re unlikely to
ever see the money.
After you determine that an account is a bad debt, you should no longer
include its value as part of your assets in Accounts Receivable. Including its
value doesn’t paint a realistic picture of your situation for the readers of your
financial reports. Because the bad debt is no longer an asset, you adjust the
value of your Accounts Receivable to reflect the loss of that asset.
You can record bad debts in a couple of ways:
 By customer: Some companies identify the specific customers whose
accounts are bad debts and calculate the bad debt expense each account-
ing period based on specified customers accounts. 
251
Chapter 17: Adjusting the Books

 By percentage: Other companies look at their bad-debts histories and
develop percentages that reflect those experiences. Instead of taking the
time to identify each specific account that will be a bad debt, these com-
panies record bad debt expenses as a percentage of their Accounts
Receivable.
However you decide to record bad debts, you need to prepare an adjusting
entry at the end of each accounting period to record bad debt expenses.
Here’s an adjusting entry to record bad debt expenses of $1,000:
Debit
Credit
Bad Debt Expense
$1,000
Accounts Receivable
$1,000
To write off customer accounts.
You can’t have bad debt expenses if you don’t sell to your customers on store
credit. You only need to worry about bad debt if you offer your customers
the convenience of buying your products on store credit.
If you use a computerized accounting system, check the system’s instructions
for how to write off bad debts. To write off a bad debt using QuickBooks
1. Open the screen where you normally record customer payments, and
instead of entering the amount received in payment, enter “$0.”
2. Place a check mark next to the amount being written off.
3. Click Discount and Credits at the bottom-right part of the screen to
open that window and see the amount due.
4. On the discount tab, which is shown in Figure 17-1, type in the
amount of the discount.
5. Select Bad Debt Expense from the Discount Account menu.
6. Click Done and verify that the discount is applied and no payment is
due (see Figure 17-2).
Recognizing unpaid salaries and wages
Not all pay periods fall at the end of a month. If you pay your employees
every two weeks, you may end up closing the books in the middle of a pay
period, meaning that, for example, employees aren’t paid for the last week of
March until the end of the first week of April.
252
Part IV: Preparing the Books for Year’s (or Month’s) End 

When your pay period hits before the end of the month, you need to make an
adjusting entry to record the payroll expense that has been incurred but not
yet paid. You estimate the amount of the adjustment based on what you pay
Figure 17-2:

Chapter 17: Adjusting the Books

every two weeks. The easiest thing to do is just accrue the expense of half 
of your payroll (which means you enter the anticipated expense as an accrual
in the appropriate account; when the cash is actually paid out, you then
reverse that accrual entry, which reduces the amount in the liability account,
Accrued Payroll expenses, and the Cash account, to reflect the outlay of
cash). If that expense is $3,000, you make the following adjusting entry to the
books to show the accrual:
Debit
Credit
Payroll Expenses
$3,000
Accrued Payroll Expenses
$3,000
To record payroll expenses for the last week of March.
This adjusting entry increases both the Payroll Expenses reported on the
income statement and the Accrued Payroll Expenses that appear as a liability
on the balance sheet. The week’s worth of unpaid salaries and wages is actu-
ally a liability that you will have to pay in the future even though you haven’t
yet spent the cash. When you finally do pay out the salaries and wages, you
reduce the amount in Accrued Payroll Expenses with the following entry:
Debit
Credit
Accrued Payroll Expenses
$3,000
Cash
$3,000
To record the cash payment of salaries and wages for the last week of March.
Note that when the cash is actually paid, you don’t record any expenses;
instead, you decrease the Accrued Payroll Expense account, which is a 
liability. The Cash account, which is an asset, also decreases.
Doing these extra entries may seem like a lot of extra work, but if you didn’t
match the payroll expenses for March with the revenues for March, your
income statements wouldn’t reflect the actual state of your affairs. Your rev-
enues at the end of March would look very good because your salary and
wage expenses weren’t fully reflected in the income statement, but your April
income statement would look very bad given the extra expenses that were
actually incurred in March.
Testing Out an Adjusted Trial Balance
In Chapter 16, I explain why and how you run a trial balance on the accounts
in your General Ledger. Adjustments to your books call for another trial bal-
ance, the adjusted trial balance, to ensure that your adjustments are correct
and ready to be posted to the General Ledger.
254
Part IV: Preparing the Books for Year’s (or Month’s) End 

You track all the adjusting entries on a worksheet similar to the one shown in
Chapter 16. You only need to do this worksheet if you’re doing your books
manually. It’s not necessary if you’re using a computerized accounting
system.
The key difference in the worksheet for the Adjusted Trial Balance is that four
additional columns must be added to the worksheet for a total of 11 columns.
Columns include
 Column 1: Account titles.
 Columns 2 and 3: Unadjusted Trial Balance. The trial balance before 
the adjustments are made with Column 2 for debits and Column 3 for
credits.
 Columns 4 and 5: Adjustments. All adjustments to the trial balance are
listed in Column 4 for debits and Column 5 for credits.
 Columns 6 and 7: Adjusted Trial Balance. A new trial balance is calculated
that includes all the adjustments. Be sure that the credits equal the debits
when you total that new Trial Balance. If they don’t, find any errors before
adding entries to the balance sheet and income statement columns.
 Columns 8 and 9: Balance sheet. Column 8 includes all the Balance Sheet
accounts that have a debit balance, and Column 9 includes all the Balance
Sheet accounts with a credit balance.
 Columns 10 and 11: Income statement. Column 10 includes all the
Income Statement accounts with a debit Balance, and Column 11
includes all the Income Statement accounts with a credit balance.
When you’re confident that all the accounts are in balance, post your adjust-
ments to the General Ledger so that all the balances in the General Ledger
include the adjusting entries. With the adjustments, the General Ledger will
match the financial statements you prepare.
Changing Your Chart of Accounts
After you finalize your General Ledger for the year, you may want to make
changes to your Chart of Accounts, which lists all the accounts in your
accounting system. (For the full story on the Chart of Accounts, see Chapter 3.)
You may need to add accounts if you think you need additional ones or delete
accounts if you think they will no longer be needed.
You should only delete accounts from your chart of accounts at the end of the
year. If you delete an account in the middle of the year, your annual financial
statements will not reflect the activities in that account prior to its deletion.
So even if you decide halfway through the year to no longer use an account,
you should leave it on the books until the end of the year, and then delete it.
255
Chapter 17: Adjusting the Books

You can add accounts to your Chart of Accounts throughout the year, but if you
decide to add an account in the middle of the year in order to more closely
track certain assets, liabilities, revenues, or expenses, you may need to adjust
some related entries.
Suppose you start the year out tracking paper expenses in the Office Supplies
Expenses account, but paper usage and its expense keeps increasing, so you
decide to track the expense in a separate account beginning in July.
First, you add the new account, Paper Expenses, to your Chart of Accounts.
Then you prepare an adjusting entry to move all the paper expenses that
were recorded in the Office Supplies Expenses account to the Paper Expenses
account. In the interest of space and to avoid boring you, the adjusting entry
below is an abbreviated one. In your actual entry, you would probably detail
the specific dates paper was bought as an office supplies expense rather than
just tally one summary total.
Debit
Credit
Paper Expenses
$1,000
Office Supplies Expenses
$1,000
To move expenses for paper from the Office Supplies Expenses account to the
Paper Expenses account.
256
Part IV: Preparing the Books for Year’s (or Month’s) End 
Moving beyond the catchall Miscellaneous
Expenses account
When new accounts are added to the Chart of
Accounts, the account most commonly adjusted
is the Miscellaneous Expenses account. In many
cases, you may expect to incur an expense only
one or two times during the year, therefore
making it unnecessary to create a new account
specifically for that expense. But after a while,
you find that your “rare” expense is adding up,
and you’d be better off with a designated
account, meaning that it’s time to create some
adjusting entries to move expenses out of the
Miscellaneous Expenses account.
For example, suppose you think you’ll only need
to rent a car for the business one time before you
buy a new vehicle, so you enter the rental cost in
the books as a Miscellaneous Expense. However,
after renting cars three times, you decide to start
a Rental Expense account mid-year. When you
add the Rental Expense account to your Chart of
Accounts, you need to use an adjusting entry to
transfer any expenses incurred and recorded in
the Miscellaneous Expense account prior to the
creation of the new account.

Chapter 18
Developing a Balance Sheet
In This Chapter
 Breaking down the balance sheet
 Pulling together your balance sheet accounts
 Choosing a format
 Drawing conclusions from your balance sheet
 Polishing electronically produced balance sheets
P
eriodically, you want to know where your business stands. Therefore, at
the end of each accounting period, you take a snapshot of your busi-
ness’s condition. This snapshot, which is called a balance sheet, gives you a
picture of where your business stands — how much it has in assets, how
much it owes in liabilities, and how much the owners have invested in the
business at a particular point in time.
This chapter explains the key ingredients of a balance sheet and tells you
how to pull them all together. You also find out how to use some analytical
tools called ratios to see how well your business is doing.
What Is a Balance Sheet?
Basically, creating a balance sheet is like taking a picture of the financial
aspects of your business.
The company name and ending date for the accounting period being reported
appear at the top of the balance sheet. The rest of the report summarizes
 The company’s assets, which include everything the company owns in
order to stay in operation.
 The company’s debts, which include any outstanding bills and loans
that must be paid.
 The owner’s equity, which is basically how much the company owners
have invested in the business.

Assets, liabilities, and equity probably sound familiar — they’re the key ele-
ments that show whether or not your books are in balance. If your liabilities
plus equity equal assets, your books are in balance. All your bookkeeping
efforts are an attempt to keep the books in balance based on this formula,
which I talk more about in Chapter 2.
Gathering Balance Sheet Ingredients
You can find most of the information you need to prepare a balance sheet on
your trial balance worksheet, the details of which are drawn from your final
adjusted trial balance. (I show you how to develop a trial balance in Chapter 16
and how to adjust that trial balance in Chapter 17.)
To keep this example somewhat simple, I assume that the fictitious company
has no adjustments for the balance sheet as of May 31, 2005. In the real world,
every company needs to adjust something (usually inventory levels at the
very least) every month.
To prepare the example trial balances in this chapter, I use the key accounts
listed in Table 18-1; these accounts and numbers come from the fictitious
company’s trial balance worksheet.

Part V: Reporting Results and Starting Over 

Dividing and listing your assets
The first part of the balance sheet is the Assets section. The first step in
developing this section is dividing your assets into two categories: current
assets and long-term assets.
Current assets
Current assets are things your company owns that you can easily convert to
cash and expect to use in the next 12 months to pay your bills and your
employees. Current assets include cash, Accounts Receivable (money due
from customers), marketable securities (including stocks, bonds, and other
types of securities), and inventory. (I cover Accounts Receivable in Chapter 9
and inventory in Chapter 8.)
When you see cash as the first line item on a balance sheet, that account
includes what you have on hand in the register and what you have in the
bank, including checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts,
and certificates of deposit. In most cases, you simply list all these accounts
as one item, Cash, on the balance sheet.
The current assets for a fictional company are
Cash
$2,500
Petty Cash
$500
Accounts Receivable
$1,000
Inventory
$1,200
You total the Cash and Petty Cash accounts, giving you $3,000, and list that
amount on the balance sheet as a line item called Cash.
Long-term assets
Long-term assets are things your company owns that you expect to have for
more than 12 months. Long-term assets include land, buildings, equipment,
furniture, vehicles, and anything else that you expect to have for longer than
a year.
The long-term assets are
Equipment
$5,050
Vehicles
$25,000
Furniture
$5,600
261
Chapter 18: Developing a Balance Sheet

Most companies have more items in the long-term assets section of a balance
sheet than the few long-term assets I show here for the fictional company.
For example, a manufacturing company that has a lot of tools, dies, or molds
created specifically for its manufacturing processes would have a line item
called Tools, Dies, and Molds in the long-term assets section of the balance
sheet.
Similarly, if your company owns one or more buildings, you should have a
line item labeled Land and Buildings. And if you lease a building with an
option to purchase it at some later date, that capitalized lease is considered 
a long-term asset and listed on the balance sheet as Capitalized Lease.
Some companies lease their business space and then spend lots of money
fixing it up. For example, a restaurant may rent a large space and then furnish
it according to a desired theme. Money spent on fixing up the space becomes
a long-term asset called Leasehold Improvements and is listed on the balance
sheet in the long-term assets section.
Everything I’ve mentioned so far in this section — land, buildings, capitalized
leases, leasehold improvements, and so on — is a tangible asset. These are
items that you can actually touch or hold. Another type of long-term asset is
the intangible asset. Intangible assets aren’t physical objects; common exam-
ples are patents, copyrights, and trademarks (all of which are granted by the
government).
 Patents give companies the right to dominate the markets for patented
products. When a patent expires (14 to 20 years depending on the type
of patent), competitors can enter the marketplace for the product that
was patented, and the competition helps to lower the price to con-
sumers. For example, pharmaceutical companies patent all their new
drugs and therefore are protected as the sole providers of those drugs.
When your doctor prescribes a brand-name drug, you’re getting a
patented product. Generic drugs are products whose patents have run
out, meaning that any pharmaceutical company can produce and sell its
own version of the same product.
 Copyrights protect original works, including books, magazines, articles,
newspapers, television shows, movies, music, poetry, and plays, from
being copied by anyone other than their creators. For example, this
book is copyrighted, so no one can make a copy of any of its contents
without the permission of the publisher, Wiley Publishing, Inc.
 Trademarks give companies ownership of distinguishing words, phrases,
symbols, or designs. For example, check out this book’s cover to see the
registered trademark, For Dummies, for this brand. Trademarks can last
forever as long as a company continues to use the trademark and file the
proper paperwork periodically.
262
Part V: Reporting Results and Starting Over 

In order to show in financial statements that their values are being used up, all
long-term assets are either depreciated or amortized. Tangible assets are
depreciated; see Chapter 12 for details on how to depreciate. Intangible assets
such as patents and copyrights are amortized (amortization is very similar to
depreciation). Each intangible asset has a lifespan based on the number of
years the government grants the rights for it. After setting an initial value for
the intangible asset, a company then divides that value by the number of years
it has government protection, and the resulting amount is than written off each
year as an Amortization Expense, which is shown on the income statement.
You can find the total amortization or depreciation expenses that have been
written off during the life of the asset on the Balance Sheet in a line item called
Accumulated Depreciation or Accumulated Amortization, whichever is appro-
priate for the type of asset.
Acknowledging your debts
The Liabilities section of the balance sheet comes after the Assets section
(see the “Dividing and listing your assets” section) and shows all the money
that your business owes to others, including banks, vendors, contractors,
financial institutions, or individuals. Like assets, you divide your liabilities
into two categories on the balance sheet:
 Current liabilities: All bills and debts you plan to pay within the next
12 months. Accounts appearing in this section include Accounts Payable
(bills due to vendors, contractors, and others), Credit Card Payable, and
the current portion of a long-term debt (for example, if you have a mort-
gage on your store, the payments due in the next 12 months appear in
the Current Liabilities section).
 Long-term liabilities: All debts you owe to lenders that will be paid over
a period longer than 12 months. Mortgages Payable, Loans Payable, and
Bonds Payable are common accounts in the long-term liabilities section
of the balance sheet.
Most businesses try to minimize their current liabilities because the interest
rates on short-term loans, such as credit cards, are usually much higher than
those on loans with longer terms. As you manage your company’s liabilities,
you should always look for ways to minimize your interest payments by seek-
ing longer term loans with lower interest rates than you can get on a credit
card or short-term loan.
263
Chapter 18: Developing a Balance Sheet

The fictional company used for the example balance sheets in this chapter
has only one account in each liabilities section:
Current liabilities:
Accounts Payable
$2,200
Long-term liabilities:
Loans Payable
$29,150
Naming your investments
Every business has investors. Even a small mom and pop grocery store requires
money upfront to get the business on its feet. Investments are reflected on the
balance sheet as equity. The line items that appear in a balance sheet’s Equity
section vary depending upon whether or not the company is incorporated.
(Companies incorporate primarily to minimize their personal legal liabilities;
I talk more about incorporation in Chapter 21.)
If you’re preparing the books for a company that isn’t incorporated, the
Equity section of your balance sheet should contain these accounts:
 Capital: All money invested by the owners to start up the company as
well as any additional contributions made after the start-up phase. If the
company has more than one owner, the balance sheet usually has a
Capital account for each owner so that their individual stakes in the
company can be tracked.
 Drawing: All money taken out of the company by the company’s owners.
Balance sheets usually have a Drawing account for each owner in order
to track individual withdrawal amounts.
 Retained Earnings: All profits that have been reinvested into the 
company.
For a company that’s incorporated, the Equity section of the balance sheet
should contain the following accounts:
 Stock: Portions of ownership in the company, purchased as investments
by company owners.
 Retained Earnings: All profits that have been reinvested in the company.
Because the fictional company isn’t an incorporated company, the accounts
appearing in the Equity Section of its balance sheet are:
Capital
$5,000
Retained Earnings
$4,500
264
Part V: Reporting Results and Starting Over 

Ta Da! Pulling Together the 
Final Balance Sheet
After you group together all your accounts (see the section “Gathering
Balance Sheet Ingredients”), you’re ready to produce a balance sheet.
Companies in the United States usually choose between two common formats
for their balance sheets: the Account format or the Report format. The actual
line items appearing in both formats are the same; the only difference is the
way in which you lay out the information on the page. A third option, the
Financial Position format, is more commonly used in Europe, but I explain it
in this section in case you ever come across it.
Account format
The Account format is a two-column layout with Assets on one side and
Liabilities and Equity on the other side.
Using the Account format, here’s a sample balance sheet.

Sorting out stock investments
You’re probably most familiar with the sale of
stock on the open market through the various
stock market exchanges, such as the New York
Stock Exchange (NYSE) and NASDAQ. However,
not all companies sell their stock through public
exchanges; in fact, most corporations aren’t
public companies but rather remain private 
operations.
Whether public or private, ownership in a com-
pany is obtained by buying shares of stock. If
the company isn’t publicly traded, shares are
bought and sold privately. In most small compa-
nies, these exchanges are made among family
members, close friends, and occasionally out-
side investors who have been approached indi-
vidually as a means to raise additional money to
build the company.
The value of each share is set at the time the
share is sold. Many companies set the initial
share value at $1 to $10.

The third type of balance sheet format, the Financial Position format, is rarely
seen in the United States but is used commonly in the international markets,
especially in Europe. This format doesn’t have an Equity section but includes
two line items that don’t appear on the Account or Report formats:
 Working Capital: Calculated by subtracting current assets from current
liabilities. It’s a quick test to see whether or not a company has the money
on hand to pay bills.
 Net Assets: What’s left over for a company’s owners after all liabilities
have been subtracted from total assets. (Note that Net Assets is the
same number as Total Equity in the other two formats.)
Using the Financial Position format, here’s the balance sheet for Company X.

Putting Your Balance Sheet to Work
With a complete balance sheet in your hands, you can analyze the numbers
through a series of ratio tests to check your cash status and track your debt.
Because these are the types of tests financial institutions and potential
investors use to determine whether or not to loan money to or invest in your
company, it’s a good idea to run these tests yourself before seeking loans or
investors. Ultimately, the ratio tests I cover in this section can help you deter-
mine whether or not your company is in a strong cash position.
Testing your cash
When you approach a bank or other financial institution for a loan, you can
expect the lender to use one of two ratios to test your cash flow: the current
ratio and the acid test ratio (also known as the quick ratio).
Current ratio
This ratio compares your current assets to your current liabilities. It provides
a quick glimpse of your company’s ability to pay its bills.
The formula for calculating the current ratio is:
Current assets ÷ Current liabilities = Current ratio
268
Part V: Reporting Results and Starting Over 

The following is an example of a current ratio calculation:
$5,200 ÷ $2,200 = 2.36 (current ratio)
Lenders usually look for current ratios of 1.2 to 2, so any financial institution
would consider a current ratio of 2.36 a good sign. A current ratio under 1 is
considered a danger sign because it indicates the company doesn’t have
enough cash to pay its current bills.
A current ratio over 2.0 may indicate that your company isn’t investing its
assets well and may be able to make better use of its current assets. For
example, if your company is holding a lot of cash, you may want to invest
that money in some long-term assets, such as additional equipment, that you
need to help grow the business.
Acid test (quick) ratio
The acid test ratio only uses the financial figures in your company’s Cash
account, Accounts Receivable, and Marketable Securities. Although it’s simi-
lar to the current ratio in that it examines current assets and liabilities, the
acid test ratio is a stricter test of your company’s ability to pay bills. The
assets part of this calculation doesn’t take inventory into account because it
can’t always be converted to cash as quickly as other current assets and
because, in a slow market, selling your inventory may take a while.
Many lenders prefer the acid test ratio when determining whether or not to
give you a loan because of its strictness.
Calculating the acid test ratio is a two-step process:
1. Determine your quick assets.
Cash + Accounts Receivable + Marketable Securities = Quick assets
2. Calculate your quick ratio.
Quick assets ÷ Current liabilities = Quick ratio
The following is an example of an acid test ratio calculation:
$2,000 + $1,000 + $1,000 = $4,000 (quick assets)
$4,000 ÷ $2,200 = 1.8 (acid test ratio)
Lenders consider a company with an acid test ratio around 1 to be in good
condition. An acid test ratio less than 1 indicates that the company may have
to sell some of its marketable securities or take on additional debt until it’s
able to sell more of its inventory.
269
Chapter 18: Developing a Balance Sheet

Assessing your debt
Before you even consider whether or not to take on additional debt, you
should always check out your debt condition. One common ratio that you
can use to assess your company’s debt position is the debt to equity ratio.
This ratio compares what your business owes to what your business owns.
Calculating your debt to equity ratio is a two-step process:
1. Calculate your total debt.
Current liabilities + Long-term liabilities = Total debt
2. Calculate your debt to equity ratio.
Total debt ÷ Equity = Debt to equity ratio
The following is an example of a debt to equity ratio calculation:
$2,200 + $29,150 = $31,350 (total debt)
$31,350 ÷ $9,500 = 3.3 (debt to equity ratio)
Lenders like to see a debt to equity ratio close to 1 because it indicates that
the amount of debt is equal to the amount of equity. With a debt to equity
ratio of 3.3, most banks probably would not loan the company in this exam-
ple any more money until either its debt levels were lowered or the owners
put more money into the company.
Generating Balance Sheets Electronically
If you use a computerized accounting system, you can take advantage of its
report function to automatically generate your balance sheets. These balance
sheets give you quick snapshots of the company’s financial position but may
require adjustments before you prepare your financial reports for external use.
One key adjustment you’re likely to make involves the value of your inventory.
Most computerized accounting systems use the averaging method to value
inventory. This method totals all the inventory purchased and then calculates
an average price for the inventory (see Chapter 8) for more information on
inventory valuation. However, your accountant may recommend a different
valuation method that works better for your business. I discuss the options
in Chapter 8. Therefore, if you use a method other than the default averaging
method to value your inventory, you need to adjust the inventory value that
appears on the balance sheet generated from your computerized accounting
system.

W
ithout one very important financial report tool, you’d never know for
sure whether or not your business made a profit. This tool is called
the income statement, and most businesses prepare them on a monthly basis
as well as quarterly and annually in order to get periodic pictures of how well
the business is doing financially.
Analyzing the income statement and the details behind it can reveal lots of
useful information to help you make decisions for improving your profits and
business overall. This chapter covers the parts of an income statement, how
you developed one, and examples of how you can use it to make business
decisions.
What Is an Income Statement?
Did your business make any money? You can find the answer in your income
statement, the financial report that summarizes all the sales activities, costs
of producing or buying the products or services sold, and expenses incurred
in order to run the business.
Income statements summarize the financial activities of a business during a
particular accounting period (which can be a month, quarter, year, or some
other period of time that makes sense for a business’s needs).
Normal practice is to include three accounting periods on an income state-
ment: the current period plus two prior periods. So a monthly statement
shows the current month plus the two previous months; a quarterly state-
ment shows the current quarter plus the two previous quarters; and an

annual statement shows the current year plus the two previous years. Providing
this much information gives income statement readers a view of the business’s
earning trends.
The five key lines that make up an income statement are
 Sales or Revenue: The total amount of money taken in from selling the
business’s products or services. You calculate this amount by totaling
all the sales or revenue accounts. The top line of the income statement
will be either sales or revenues; either is okay.
 Cost of Goods Sold: How much was spent in order to buy or make the
goods or services that were sold during the accounting period in review.
I show you how to calculate cost of goods sold in the section “Finding
Cost of Goods Sold.”
 Gross Profit: How much a business made before taking into account
operations expenses; calculated by subtracting the Cost of Goods Sold
from the Sales or Revenue.
 Operating Expenses: How much was spent on operating the business;
qualifying expenses include administrative fees, salaries, advertising,
utilities, and other operations expenses You add all your expenses
accounts on your income statement to get this total.
 Net Income or Loss: Whether or not the business made a profit or loss
during the accounting period in review; calculated by subtracting total
expenses from Gross Profit.
Formatting the Income Statement
Before you actually create your business’s income statement, you have to
pick a format in which to organize your financial information. You have two
options to choose from: the single-step format or the multi-step format. They
contain the same information but present it in slightly different ways.
The single-step format groups all data into two categories: revenue and
expenses. The multi-step format divides the income statement into several
sections and gives the reader some key subtotals to make analyzing the data
easier.
The single-step format allows readers to calculate the same subtotals as
appear in the multi-step format, but those calculations mean more work for
the reader. Therefore, most businesses choose the multi-step format to sim-
plify income statement analysis for their external financial report readers.
The following is an example of a basic income statement prepared in the
single-step format.

Chapter 19: Producing an Income Statement

Preparing the Income Statement
Before you can prepare your income statement, you have to calculate Net
Sales and Cost of Goods Sold using information that appears on your work-
sheet, which I explain in Chapter 16.
Finding Net Sales
Net Sales is a total of all your sales minus any discounts. In order to
calculate Net Sales, you look at the line items regarding sales, discounts,
and any sales fees on your worksheet. For example, suppose that your work-
sheet lists Total Sales at $20,000 and $1,000 in discounts given to customers.
Also, according to your worksheet, your business paid $125 in Credit Card
Fees on sales. To find your Net Sales, you subtract the discounts and credit
card fees from your Total Sales amount, leaving you with $18,875.
Finding Cost of Goods Sold
Cost of Goods Sold is the total amount your company spent to buy or make
the goods or services that you sold. To calculate this amount for a company
that buys its finished products from another company in order to sell them to
customers, you start with the value of the company’s opening inventory
(that’s the amount in the inventory account at the beginning of the account-
ing period), add all purchases of new inventory, and then subtract any ending
inventory (that’s inventory that’s still on the store shelves or in the ware-
house; it appears on the balance sheet, which I explain in Chapter 18).
The following is a basic Cost of Goods Sold calculation:
Opening Inventory + Purchases = Goods Available for Sale
$100 + $1,000 = $1,100
Goods Available for Sale – Ending Inventory = Cost of Goods Sold
$1,100 – $200 = $900
To simplify the example for calculating Cost of Goods Sold, I’ve assumed the
Opening (the value of the inventory at the beginning of the accounting
period) and Ending Inventory (the value of the inventory at the end of the
accounting period) values are the same. See Chapter 8 for details about cal-
culating inventory value. So to calculate Cost of Goods Sold using the detail
on Figure 16-4 (see Chapter 16), I only need two key lines of that worksheet:
the purchases made and the discounts received to lower the purchase cost.
Purchases – Purchases Discounts = Cost of Goods Sold
$8,000 – $1,500 = $6,500
274

Drawing remaining amounts
from your worksheet
After you calculate Net Sales and Cost of Goods Sold (see the preceding sec-
tions), you can use the rest of the numbers from your worksheet to prepare
your business’s income statement.
It’s standard practice to show three accounting periods on an income statement
(see the section “What Is an Income Statement?”), so the following example lists
three months’ worth of figures (but only shows actual numbers for one month).

Chapter 19: Producing an Income Statement

You and anyone else in-house are likely to want to see the type of detail shown
in this example, but most business owners prefer not to show all their operat-
ing detail to outsiders. They prefer to keep the detail private. Remember, the
more information you give to outsiders, the more they know about how your
company operates, and the easier it is for them to come up with strategies to
compete with your business. Therefore, you should consider summarizing
the Expense section in income statements that are distributed externally. For
external statements, many businesses group all advertising and promotions
expenses into one line item and all administrative expenses into another
line item.
Gauging your Cost of Goods Sold
Businesses that make their own products rather than buy them for future
sale must track inventory at three different levels:
 Raw materials: This line item includes purchases of all items used to
make your company’s products. For example, a fudge shop buys all the
ingredients to make the fudge it sells, so the value of any inventory on
hand that hasn’t been used to make fudge yet should appear in the raw
materials line item.
 Work-in-process inventory: This line item shows the value of any prod-
ucts that are being made but aren’t yet ready for sale. It’s unlikely that a
fudge shop would have anything in this line item considering fudge doesn’t
take more than a few hours to make. However, many manufacturing com-
panies take weeks or months to produce products and therefore usually
have some portion of the inventory value in this line item.
 Finished-goods inventory: This line item lists the value of inventory
that’s ready for sale. (For a company that doesn’t make its own prod-
ucts, finished-goods inventory is the same as the inventory line item.)
If you keep the books for a company that manufactures its own products, you
can use a computerized accounting system to track the various inventory
accounts described here. However, your basic accounting system software
won’t cut it — you need a more advanced package in order to track multiple
inventory types. One such system is the Premiere edition from QuickBooks,
which sells for around $500.
Deciphering Gross Profit
Business owners must carefully watch their gross profit trends on monthly
income statements. Gross profit trends that appear lower from one month to
276
Part V: Reporting Results and Starting Over 

the next can mean one of two things: Sales revenue is down, or Cost of Goods
Sold is up.
If revenue is down month-to-month, you may need to quickly figure out why
and fix the problem in order to meet your sales goals for the year. Or, by
examining sales figures for the same month in previous years, you may deter-
mine that the drop is just a normal sales slowdown given the time of year and
isn’t cause to hit the panic button.
If the downward trend isn’t normal, it may be a sign that a competitor’s suc-
cessfully drawing customers away from your business, or it may indicate that
customers are dissatisfied with some aspect of the products or services you
supply. Whatever the reason, preparing a monthly income statement gives you
the ammunition you need to quickly find and fix a problem, thereby minimizing
any negative hit to your yearly profits.
The other key element of Gross Profit, Costs of Goods Sold, can also be a big
factor in a downward profit trend. For example, if the amount you spend to
purchase products that you then sell goes up, your Gross Profit goes down.
As a business owner, you need to do one of five things if the costs of goods
sold are reducing your Gross Profit:
 Find a new supplier who can provide the goods cheaper.
 Increase your prices as long as you won’t lose sales because of the
increase.
 Find a way to increase your volume of sales so that you can sell more
products and meet your annual profit goals.
 Find a way to reduce other expenses to offset the additional product
costs.
 Accept the fact that your annual profit will be lower than expected.
The sooner you find out that you have a problem with costs, the faster you
can find a solution and minimize any reduction in your annual profit goals.
Monitoring Expenses
The Expenses section of your income statement gives you a good summary
of all the money you spent to keep your business operating that wasn’t
directly related to the sale of an individual product or service. For example,
businesses usually use advertising both to bring customers in and with the
hopes of selling many different types of products. That’s why you should list
advertising as an Expense rather than a Cost of Goods Sold. After all, rarely
277
Chapter 19: Producing an Income Statement

can you link an advertisement to the sale of an individual product. The same
is true of all the administrative expenses that go into running a business,
such as rent, wages and salaries, office costs, and so on.
Business owners watch their expense trends closely to be sure they don’t
creep upwards and lower the companies’ bottom lines. Any cost-cutting you
can do on the expense side is guaranteed to increase your bottom-line profit.
Using the Income Statement
to Make Business Decisions
Many business owners find it easier to compare their income statement
trends using percentages rather than the actual numbers. Calculating these
percentages is easy enough — you simply divide each line item by Net Sales.
The following shows a company’s percentage breakdown for one month.

Looking at this percentage breakdown, you can see that the company had
a gross profit of 65.6 percent, and its Cost of Goods Sold, at 34.4 percent,
accounted for just over one-third of the revenue. If the prior month’s Cost
of Goods Sold was only 32 percent, the business owner would need to find
out why the cost of the goods used to make his product likely went up. If
this trend of increased Cost of Goods Sold continues through the year with-
out some kind of fix, the company would make at least 2.2 percent less net
profit.
You may find it helpful to see how your income statement results compare to
industry trends for similar businesses with similar revenues; this process is
called benchmarking. By comparing results, you can find out if your costs and
expenses are reasonable for the type of business you operate, and, you can
identify areas with room to improve your profitability. You also may spot
some red flags for line items upon which you spend much more than the
national average.

Part V: Reporting Results and Starting Over 

42.5 percent. His rent was a bit lower and his salaries higher, but overall,
Company X’s costs and expenses were 76.1 percent compared to the indus-
try average of 89.1 percent. As a result, Mr. X made a higher net income
(23.8 percent) than the industry standard (10.9 percent). Not bad at all — if
your business were doing this well, you’d have good reason to be very happy.
Testing Profits
With a completed income statement, you can do a number of quick ratio tests
of your business’s profitability. You certainly want to know how well your busi-
ness did compared to other similar businesses. You also want to be able to
gauge your return (which means what percentage you made) on your business.
Three common tests are Return on Sales, Return on Assets, and Return on
Equity. These ratios have much more meaning if you can find industry averages
for your particular type of business, so you can compare your results. Check
with your local Chamber of Commerce to see whether it has figures for local
businesses, or order a report for your industry online www.bizminer.com.
Return on Sales
The Return on Sales (ROS) ratio tells you how efficiently your company runs
its operations. Using the information on your income statement, you can
measure how much profit your company produced per dollar of sales and
how much extra cash you brought in per sale.
You calculate ROS by dividing net income before taxes by sales. For example,
suppose your company had a net income of $4,500 and sales of $18,875.
(If your business isn’t a corporation but rather is run by a sole proprietor,
you don’t have to factor in any business taxes because only corporations pay
income taxes. I talk more about business taxes in Chapter 21.) The following
shows your calculation of ROS.
Net income before taxes ÷ Sales = Return on Sales
$4,500 ÷ $18,875 = 23.8%
As you can see, your company made 23.8 percent on each dollar of sales.
To determine whether that amount calls for celebration, you need to find the
ROS ratios for similar businesses. You may be able to get such information
from your local chamber of commerce, or you can order an industry report
online from BizMiner (www.bizminer.com).
281
Chapter 19: Producing an Income Statement

Return on Assets
The Return on Assets (ROA) ratio tests how well you’re using your com-
pany’s assets to generate profits. If your company’s ROA is the same or
higher than other similar companies, you’re doing a good job of managing
your assets.
To calculate ROA, you divide net income by total assets. You find total assets
on your balance sheet, which you can read more about in Chapter 18.
Suppose that your company’s net income was $4,500 and total assets were
$40,050. The following shows your calculation of ROA. The following shows
your calculation of ROA.
Net income ÷ Total assets = Return on Assets
$4,500 ÷ $40,050 = 11.2%
You calculation shows that your company made 11.2 percent on each dollar
of assets it held.
ROA can vary significantly depending on the type of industry in which you
operate. For example, if your business requires you to maintain lots of expen-
sive equipment, such as a manufacturing firm, your ROA will be much lower
than a service business that doesn’t need as many assets. ROA can range
from below 5 percent for manufacturing companies that require a large
investment in machinery and factories to as high as 20 percent or even
higher for service companies with few assets.
Return on Equity
To measure how successful your company was in earning money for the
owners or investors, calculate the Return on Equity (ROE) ratio. This ratio
often looks better than Return on Assets (see the preceding section) because
ROE doesn’t take debt into consideration.
You calculate ROE by dividing net income by shareholders’ or owners’ equity.
(You find equity amounts on your balance sheet; see Chapter 18.) Suppose
your company’s net income was $4,500 and the owners’ equity was $9,500.
Here is the formula:
Net income ÷ Shareholders’ or owners’ equity = Return on Equity
$4,500 ÷ $9,500 = 47.3%
Most business owners put in a lot of cash upfront to get a business started,
so it’s fairly common to see a business whose liabilities and equities are split
close to 50 percent each.
282
Part V: Reporting Results and Starting Over 

Branching Out with Income
Statement Data
The income statement you produce for external use — financial institutions
and investors — may be very different from the one you produce for in-house
use by your managers. Most business owners prefer to provide the minimum
amount of detail necessary to satisfy external users of their financial state-
ments, such as summaries of expenses instead of line-by-line expense details,
a net sales figure without reporting all the detail about discounts and fees,
and a cost of goods number without reporting all the detail about how that
was calculated.
Internally, the contents of the income statement are a very different story.
With more detail, your managers are better able to make accurate business
decisions. Most businesses develop detailed reports based on the data col-
lected to develop the income statement. Items such as discounts, returns,
and allowances are commonly pulled out of income statements and broken
down into further detail.
 Discounts are reductions on the retail price as part of a special sale. They
may also be in the form of volume discounts provided to customers who
buy large amounts of the company’s products. For example, a store may
offer a 10 percent discount to customers who buy 20 or more of the same
item at one time. In order to put their Net Sales numbers in perspective,
business owners and managers must track how much they reduce their
revenues to attract sales.
 Returns are transactions in which items are returned by the buyer for
any reason — not the right size, damaged, defective, and so on. If a com-
pany’s number of returns increases dramatically, a larger problem may
be the cause; therefore business owners need to track these numbers
carefully in order to identify and resolve any problems with the items
they sell.
 Allowances cover gifts cards and other accounts that customers pay for
upfront without taking any merchandise. Allowances are actually a liabil-
ity for a business because the customer (or the person who was given
the gift card) eventually comes back to get merchandise and doesn’t
have to pay any cash in return.
Another section of the income statement that you’re likely to break down into
more detail for internal use is the Cost of Goods Sold. Basically, you take the
detail collected to calculate that line item, including beginning inventory,
ending inventory, purchases, and purchase discounts, and present it in a sep-
arate report. (I explain how to calculate Cost of Goods Sold in the section
“Finding Cost of Goods Sold” earlier in this chapter.)
283
Chapter 19: Producing an Income Statement

There’s really no limit to the number of internal reports you can generate
from the detail that goes into your income statement and other financial
statements. For example, many businesses design a report that looks at
month-to-month trends in revenue, cost of goods sold, and income. In fact,
you can set up your computerized accounting system (if you use one) to
automatically generate this report and other custom-designed reports.
Using your computerized system, you can produce these reports at any
time during the month if you want to see how close you are to meeting your
month-end, quarter-end, or year-end goal.
Many companies will also design a report that compares actual spending to
the budget. On this report, each of the income statement line items appear
with their accompanying planned budget figures and the actual figures. If
you were reviewing this report, you’d flag any line item that’s considerably
higher or lower than expected and then research them to find a reason for
the difference.

and Reports
In This Chapter
 Mastering employee reporting
 Preparing forms for vendors and contractors
 Taking care of annual tax summaries
E
ven though you’ve diligently filed all your quarterly employee reports with
the federal government, you still have a lot of paperwork to complete at
the end of the year. You need to file forms for each of your employees as well as
any independent contractors you’ve paid over the course of the year.
Yes, you guessed it. End-of-the-year government paperwork takes lots of time.
To help make it as painless as possible, though, this chapter reviews the forms
you must complete, the information you need for each form, and the process
for filing your company’s payroll information with the federal government.
Year-End Employee Reporting
You may think that you’ve had to do a lot of government paperwork related
to your payroll throughout the year, but you haven’t seen anything yet. End-
of-year payroll reporting requires lots of forms and lots of time.
Although the federal government doesn’t require that you prepare a separate
wage and tax statement for each employee during the year, it’s something
you have to do at the end of the year for each employee you paid $600 or
more. The employee form is called the W-2, Wage and Tax Statement. If you
worked for anyone prior to setting up your own company, you surely got at
least one of these. The W-2 is the form people use to report any earnings
from employers when they file their personal taxes each year.

Producing W-2s for employees
In QuickBooks, you can generate W-2s automatically from the employee 
navigator page (see Figure 20-1). To start the process, all you do is click
on Process Payroll Forms. As you can see in Figure 20-2, you get a pop-up
screen asking you to select a form; choose Annual Form W-2 — Wage and
Tax Statement. (Note that you can also generate Forms 940 and 941, which
I cover in Chapter 11.)

Part V: Reporting Results and Starting Over 

Filing W-2s
When you were an employee, you probably noticed that every company you
ever worked for waited until the last possible day to provide you with your
W-2s. Now that you’re preparing these documents for your employees,
you have a better understanding of your employers’ delay — it takes time
to put W-2s together. Preparing these forms can be a very time-consuming
task, especially if you want to make sure they’re correct.
If you use a computerized accounting system’s payroll software package to
prepare your W-2s, there’s no doubt that the task is much easier, but it still
takes time to run the reports and review them to be sure everything is accu-
rate before printing the final forms. Although you can send out corrected 
W-2s if necessary, filing the additional forms is just a lot of extra work, so you
want to avoid correcting a W-2 whenever possible. The best way to eliminate
the need for corrections is to be very careful in checking all information on
the forms before distributing them to your employees.
Your company may be required to pay penalties if your W-2 forms are pre-
pared incorrectly or aren’t filed on time with your employees or with the 
government. The three levels of penalties for incorrectly filed W-2s or W-2s
not prepared on time are:
1. $15 for each W-2 that you file late or need to correct, provided that late
filing is done within 30 days of the due date. The maximum penalty at
this level for a company is $75,000. Small companies with average annual
gross revenues under $5 million face only a $25,000 penalty maximum.
2. $30 for each W-2 that you file late or need to correct more than 30 days
after the due date and before August 1. The maximum penalty at this
level for large companies is $150,000, and smaller companies face a
$50,000 maximum penalty.
3. $50 for each W-2 that you file after August 1 or fail to prepare altogether.
The maximum penalties at this level are $250,000 for large companies
and $100,000 for small businesses.
You can avoid these penalties if you can prove to the federal government that
your failure to file W-2s on time was the result of an event beyond your con-
trol, such as a fire that destroyed all your records, and not the product of
neglect. You must also indicate the steps you took to avoid filing late. You can
also avoid penalties if incorrect information on a W-2 wasn’t significant or
didn’t hinder the work of the IRS or the Social Security Administration in pro-
cessing the W-2 information.
You can also be hit with a suit for civil damages if you fraudulently file a W-2
claiming you paid someone wages you didn’t actually pay. The person may
sue you for any damages incurred because of this fraudulent W-2.
287
Chapter 20: Completing Year-End Payroll and Reports

Most of the information required to put together an employee’s W-2 should
be kept as part of your payroll records and therefore be easy to pull together.
When filling out the W-2, which you can see in Figure 20-3, you must supply
information for the following boxes:
 Box 1: Wages, tips, other compensation. The total in this box should
also include the value of any employee bonuses, prizes, awards, or non-
cash payments that aren’t exempt or excluded from taxes.
 Box 2: Federal income tax withheld.
 Box 3: Social Security wages. Some benefits are exempt from wages for
the purposes of federal income tax but aren’t exempt from Social Security
(see Chapter 10 for details).
 Box 4: Social Security tax withheld.
 Box 5: Medicare wages and tips. This amount is likely to be the same as
the amount in Box 3, Social Security wages.
 Box 6: Medicare tax withheld.
 Box 7: Social Security tips. Any tips your employees reported to you
should be reported here.
 Box 8: Allocated tips. Some businesses choose to allocate tips rather
than collect and report tips for each employee separately. If you do that,
report the tips in this box rather than in Box 7.
 Box 9: Advance EIC payment. If you paid employees advances on their
Earned Income Credit, record the value of those advances in this box.
 Box 10: Dependent care benefits. If you provide dependent care bene-
fits to an employee, report the provided amount in this box.
 Box 11: Nonqualified plans. In this box, you report any distribution to
your employees of assets from nonqualified retirement plans, which are
retirement plans that don’t meet the requirements of the federal govern-
ment. (Qualified plans such as 401Ks, IRAs, pensions, and others are
reported on 1099-R.)
 Box 12: The box contains numbers coded between A to Z. Each letter
is for reporting a different type of income. For example, Code A is for
uncollected Social Security tax on tips, and Code J is for nontaxable sick
pay. You can get a complete list of these codes in the IRS publication
Instructions for Forms W-2 and W-3, available by mail or by visiting www.
irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/iw2w3.pdf.
 Box 13: This box contains three boxes that you check according to what
applies to the employee in question:
• Check the first box, labeled Statutory employee, if the employee
can report income and expenses as a business, such as an agent or
traveling salesperson.
288
Part V: Reporting Results and Starting Over 

• Check the second box, labeled Retirement plan, if you provide a
qualified retirement plan for your employees.
• Check the third box, labeled Third-party sick pay, if you provide
payment for an employee as a third-party for sick pay. This box is
usually used if a third-party is paying an employee’s workman’s
compensation. I talk more about workman’s compensation in
Chapter 11.
 Box 14: Other. This is the place for information you want to share with
the employee, such as detail about fringe benefits that were included in
the total for Box 1.
 Boxes 15–20: In these boxes, you report payroll detail for state and local
tax information.
You must furnish your employees with W-2s by January 31. Usually, you give
employees four copies of the form:
 One for the employee’s file
 One to be filed with federal tax forms
 One to be filed with state tax forms
 One to be filed with local tax forms (which aren’t always necessary)
Figure 20-3:

289
Chapter 20: Completing Year-End Payroll and Reports

You also need to make one copy for your company files and one copy to send
along with Form W-3, the summary report of your W-2s that I discuss in the
section “Sending in wage reports” later in this chapter.
W-2s for the previous year must be delivered to employees by January 31.
However, if you’re mailing W-2s to employees, they can be mailed on or
before January 31. If January 31 falls on a weekend, you can mail the forms on
the first business day after January 31. If for some reason you can’t meet the
January 31 deadline, you must file for an extension with the IRS by sending a
letter to:
IRS – Enterprise Computing Center – Martinsburg
Information Reporting Program
Attn: Extension of Time Coordinator
240 Murall Drive
Kearneysville, WV 25430
Your letter must include:
 Your business name and address
 Your employer identification number
 A statement indicating that you’re requesting an extension to furnish 
W-2 forms to employees
 The reason for the delay
 Your signature or the signature of your authorized agent
If you don’t get an extension and can’t show reasonable cause, you’ll be penal-
ized $50 per W-2 (up to $250,000 for large companies and $100,000 for small
businesses). The penalty from the IRS can be even stiffer if it determines that
your failure to provide W-2 forms on time was an “intentional disregard of payee
statement requirements” (that’s straight from the IRS’s mouth). If your failure’s
judged as intentional, the fine is $100 per W-2 with no maximum penalty.
Sending in wage reports
After you complete your W-2s and distribute them to employees, you still
haven’t seen the last of government paperwork. At this point, you total the
numbers and fill out another form that looks very much like the W-2 — 
the W-3, Transmittal of Wage and Tax Statements. Figure 20-4 is a sample W-3.
290
Part V: Reporting Results and Starting Over 

The W-3 is essentially the cover sheet for the information you send to the
Social Security Administration. This form is your last chance to reconcile your
numbers before actually filing them with the government. The W-3 numbers
should match the totals shown on the Form 941 reports that you submitted to
the federal government quarterly throughout the year. (I discuss these reports
in Chapter 11.)
Figure 20-4:
Sample 2005
W-3 for
Transmittal
of Wage
and Tax
Statements.
291
Chapter 20: Completing Year-End Payroll and Reports

The W-3 must be filed by February 28 with the Social Security Administration.
As a small businessperson, you can mail the W-3 and the copies of the W-2s
to the Social Security Administration at:
Social Security Administration
Data Operations Center
Wilkes-Barre, PA 18769-0001
You can also file the forms online through the Social Security Administration
Web site at www.ssa.gov/bso/bsowelcome.htm, or file them electronically.
Large companies with more than 250 employees must file their W-3s and W-2s
by magnetic media or electronically. Any business filing electronically can
wait until March 31 to file.
If your company reports tips, you need to complete an additional form
called Form 8027, Employer’s Annual Information Return of Tip Income and
Allocated Tips. The deadlines for filing Form 8027 are the same as for the 
W-3 — February 28 for regular filing and March 31 for magnetic media or 
electronic filings.
Producing 1099s for Vendors
and Contractors
For each contractor and vendor you pay over the course of the year, instead of
preparing a W-2, you must complete Form 1099, Miscellaneous Income. The 1099
is an information form used to report income, interest payments, and dividend
payments. To transmit the 1099 to the federal government, you use Form 1096,
Annual Summary and Transmittal of U.S. Information Returns, which I explain in
the section “Filing Year-end Government Reports” later in this chapter.
Your computerized accounting program can automatically generate 1099s
and 1096s. If you’re using QuickBooks, you start on the Vendor Navigator
screen (see Figure 20-5) and click Print 1099s. The 1099 and 1096 Wizard then
pops up to guide you through the rest of the process (see Figure 20-6).
If you can’t generate these forms automatically from your computerized
accounting system, or if you do your books manually, you can expect to work
closely with your accountant on 1099s and 1096s. He or she can usually mini-
mize the time it takes to prepare this paperwork by using professional tax
preparation software programs.
292
Part V: Reporting Results and Starting Over 

There are actually 16 different types of 1099s. You use one form if you provide
a medical savings account for your employees, and you use another if you
distributed any money from an employee’s retirement account. You can
access full instructions for the various 1099 forms at www.irs.gov/pub/
irs-pdf/i1099.pdf.

Chapter 20: Completing Year-End Payroll and Reports

As a small businessperson, the one you’ll use the most is Form 1099-MISC,
which is shown in Figure 20-7. It’s the one used to report independent con-
tractor and vendor compensation.
The 1099-MISC contains 18 boxes, but depending on the type of payment
you’re reporting, you may only need to fill out a few of them. The boxes are
as follows:
 Box 1: Rents. This box should contain the total of any rental payments
made to the contractor or vendor for whom you’re filing the form.
 Box 2: Royalties. This box should contain the total of any royalty pay-
ments made to a contractor.
 Box 3: Other income. In this box, list any miscellaneous income that
doesn’t fit in a designated box on the form.
 Box 4: Federal income tax withheld. Most times, you don’t withhold
federal income tax from a contractor or vendor, so this box remains
empty. But sometimes a business does withhold federal income taxes
for a contractor or a contractor.
 Box 5: Fishing boat proceeds. Total any money paid to a fishing boat
contractor and list it here.
 Box 6: Medical and health care payments. It’s unlikely that you pay
medical or health care benefits for a contractor or vendor, so this box
will probably be left blank.
 Box 7: Nonemployee compensation. In this box, record any nonem-
ployee compensation that doesn’t fit in one of the other boxes.
 Box 8: Substitute payments in lieu of dividends or interest.
 Box 9: Check this box if you made direct sales of $5,000 or more of con-
sumer products to a buyer for resale.
 Box 10: Crop insurance proceeds. Indicate payments to farmers from
crop insurance coverage by the insurance company.
 Boxes 11 and 12: Blank.
 Box 13: Excess golden parachute payments. This box should contain
the total amount paid to an employee who has left the company.
 Box 14: Gross proceeds paid to an attorney.
 Boxes 15a: Section 409A deferrals, and 15b: Section 409A income.
These boxes are for payments made as part of a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
 Boxes 16–18: These boxes are reserved for state governmental 
information.
294
Part V: Reporting Results and Starting Over 

You need to make three copies of your 1099s:
 One to be sent to the vendor or contractor by January 31
 One to be filed with the IRS by February 28, so that the income reported
on a vendor’s or contractor’s individual tax return can be verified
 One to keep in your company files.
The 1099 form is for informational purposes and not attached to individual
income tax forms filed with federal and state governments, so companies
only need to provide one copy of the 1099 to its vendors and contractors.
A copy of the 1099 must be provided to contractors or vendors by January 31,
but it does not need to be filed with the government until February 28. The IRS
uses the information on this form to match income reported by these contrac-
tors and vendors on their individual tax returns. You’ll need to make three
copies of this form — one for the vendor or contractor, one for the IRS, and
one for your own files.
When filing 1099s with the government, you need a cover sheet. That cover
sheet is a summary called Form 1096, Annual Summary and Transmittal of U.S.
Information Returns. This form summarizes the information filed on 1099s,
Figure 20-7:
Sample 2005
1099 Miscel-
laneous
Income for
contractors
and vendors.
295
Chapter 20: Completing Year-End Payroll and Reports

including the total number of 1099s filed, total federal income tax withheld, and
total income reported. Other forms that are included on this summary report,
which you can see in Figure 20-8, aren’t likely to be filed by a small business,
including the 1098 (student loan information), W-2G (gambling winnings), and
5498 (Coverdell ESA contribution).

Part V: Reporting Results and Starting Over 

If your company transmits the applicable information from Form 1096 elec-
tronically, you don’t actually need to use this form.
Filing Year-End Summaries
After you complete all your tax forms for individual employees, contractors,
and vendors, you’re left with two annual summary reports that must be filed
with the federal government:
 Form 940, Employer’s Annual Federal Unemployment Tax Return contains
an annual summary of your federal unemployment tax payments.
Because you file this form quarterly as well as annually, I discuss it in
greater detail in Chapter 11.
 Form 945, Annual Return of Withheld Income Tax is a summary of all 
federal income tax withheld from vendors, contractors, pensions or
annuities. In most cases, this form just serves as a summary of the pay-
ments you make throughout the year as you withhold taxes. You can see
a sample of Form 945 in Figure 20-9.

Chapter 21
Satisfying the Tax Man
In This Chapter
 Sorting out business legal structures
 Filing sole proprietor taxes
 Reporting taxes on partnerships
 Filing taxes for corporations
 Reporting and paying sales taxes
P
aying taxes and reporting income for your company are very important
jobs, and the way in which you complete these tasks properly depends on
your business’s legal structure. From sole proprietorships to corporations and
everything in between, this chapter briefly reviews business types and explains
how taxes are handled for each type. You also get some instruction on collect-
ing and transmitting sales taxes on the products your company sells.
Finding the Right Business Type
Business type and tax preparation and reporting go hand in hand. If you work
as a bookkeeper for a small business, you need to know the business’s legal
structure before you can proceed with reporting and paying income taxes on
the business income. Not all businesses have the same legal structure, so
they don’t all pay income taxes on the profits they make in the same way.
But before you get into the subject of tax procedures, you need to under-
stand the various business structures you may encounter as a bookkeeper.
This section outlines each type of business. You can find out how these 
structures pay taxes in separate sections that follow.

Sole proprietorship
The simplest legal structure for a business is the sole proprietorship, a busi-
ness that’s owned by one individual. (If a business has only one owner, the
IRS automatically considers it a sole proprietorship.)
Most new business with only one owner start out as sole proprietorships.
Some never change their statuses, but others grow by adding partners and
becoming partnerships. Some add lots of staff and want to protect them-
selves from lawsuits, so they become Limited Liability Companies (LLCs).
Those seeking the greatest protection from individual lawsuits, whether they
have employees or are simply single-owner companies without employees,
become corporations. I cover these other structures later in this chapter.
Partnership
The IRS considers any business owned by more than one person a partnership.
The partnership is the most flexible type of business structure involving
more than one owner. Each partner in the business is equally liable for the
activities of the business. This structure is slightly more complicated than a
sole proprietorship (see “Sole proprietorship,” earlier in this chapter), and
partners should work out certain key issues before the business opens its
doors. These issues include
 How the partners will divide the profits
 How each partner can sell his or her share of the business, if he or she
so chooses
 What will happen to each partner’s share if a partner becomes sick
or dies
 How the partnership will be dissolved if one of the partners wants out
Partners in a partnership don’t always have to share equal risks. A partnership
may have two different types of partners: general and limited. The general
partner runs the day-to-day business and is held personally responsible for
all activities of the business, no matter how much he or she has personally
invested in the business. Limited partners, on the other hand, are passive
owners of the business and not involved in its day-to-day operations. If a claim
is filed against the business, the limited partners can only be held personally
liable for the amount of money that matches how much they individually
invested in the business.
300
Part V: Reporting Results and Starting Over 

Limited Liability Companies (LLCs)
The Limited Liability Company, or LLC, is a structure that provides partnerships
and sole proprietorships with some protection from being held personally
liable for their businesses’ activities. This business structure is somewhere
between a sole proprietorship or partnership and a corporation: The business
ownership and IRS tax rules are similar to those of a sole proprietorship or
partnership, but like a corporation, if the business is sued, the owners aren’t
held personally liable.
LLCs are state entities, so the level of legal protection given to a company’s
owners depends upon the rules of the state in which the LLC was formed.
Most states give LLC owners the same protection from lawsuits as the federal
government gives corporation owners. However, these LLC protections
haven’t been tested in court to date, so no one knows for certain whether or
not they hold up in the courtroom. (For more on the LLC, see the sidebar
“Growth of the LLC.”)
Corporations
If your business faces a great risk of being sued, the safest business structure
for you is the corporation. Courts in the United States have clearly determined
that a corporation is a separate legal entity and that its owners’ personal
assets are protected from claims against the corporation. Essentially, an owner
or shareholder in a corporation can’t be sued or face collections because of
actions taken by the corporation. This veil of protection is the reason many
small business owners choose to incorporate even though it involves a lot of
expense (both for lawyers and accountants) and government paperwork.
301
Chapter 21: Satisfying the Tax Man
Growth of the LLC
LLCs are relatively new to the world of business
structures. They were first established in the
United States about 20 years ago but didn’t
become popular until the mid-1990s, when most
states approved the LLC as a business structure.
Many law firms and accounting firms are set up
as LLCs. More and more small business owners
are choosing this structure rather than a corpo-
ration because the LLC’s easier and cheaper
to maintain (as in a lot less government paper-
work plus less legal and accounting fees), yet it
still provides personal protection from legal
entanglements.

In a corporation, each share of stock represents a portion of ownership, and
profits must be split based on stock ownership. You don’t have to sell stock
on the public stock markets in order to be a corporation, though. In fact,
most corporations are private entities that sell their stock privately among
friends and investors.
If you’re a small business owner who wants to incorporate, first you must
form a board of directors (see the sidebar “Roles and responsibilities of the
corporate board”). Boards can be made up of owners of the company as well
as nonowners. You can even have your spouse and children on the board —
I bet those board meetings would be interesting.
Tax Reporting for Sole Proprietors
The federal government doesn’t consider sole proprietorships to be indi-
vidual legal entities, so they’re not taxed as such. Instead, sole proprietors
302
Part V: Reporting Results and Starting Over 
Roles and responsibilities of the corporate board
Corporations provide a veil of protection for
company owners, but in order to maintain that
protection, the owners must comply with many
rules unique to corporations. The board of
directors takes on the key role of complying
with these rules, and it must maintain a record
of meeting minutes that prove the board is fol-
lowing key operating procedures, such as:
 Establishment of records of banking associa-
tions and any changes to those arrangements
 Tracking of loans from stockholders or third
parties
 Selling or redeeming shares of stock
 Payment of dividends
 Authorization of salaries or bonuses for offi-
cers and key executives
 Undertaking of any purchases, sales, or
leases of corporate assets
 Buying another company
 Merging with another company
 Making changes to the Articles of Incorpo-
ration or bylaws
 Election of corporate officers and directors
Corporate board minutes are considered official
and must be available for review by the IRS,
state taxing authorities, and the courts. If a
company’s owners want to invoke the veil of
protection that corporate status provides, they
must prove that the board has met its obliga-
tions and that the company operated as a cor-
poration. In other words, you can’t form a board
and have no proof that it ever met and managed
these key functions.

report any business earnings on their individual tax returns — that’s the only
financial reporting they must do.
Most sole proprietors file their business tax obligations as part of their indi-
vidual 1040 tax return using the additional two-page form Schedule C, Profit
or Loss from Business. On the first page of Schedule C, which you can see in
Figure 21-1, you report all the company’s income and expenses. The second
page of Schedule C, which you can see in Figure 21-2, is where you report
information about Cost of Goods Sold and any vehicles used as part of the
business.
Sole proprietors must also pay both the employee and the employer sides
of Social Security and Medicare — that’s double what an employee would
normally pay. Table 21-1 shows the drastic difference in these types of tax
obligations for sole proprietors.
Table 21-1

Type of Tax
Amount Taken 
Amount Paid 
from Employees
by Sole Proprietors
Social Security
6.2%
12.4%
Medicare
1.45%
2.9%
Social Security and Medicare taxes are based on the net profit of the small
business, not the gross profit, which means that you calculate the tax after
you’ve subtracted all costs and expenses from your revenue. To help you
figure out the tax amounts you owe on behalf of your business, use IRS form
Schedule SE, Self-Employment Tax. On the first page of this form, you report
your income sources (see Figure 21-3), and on the second page, you calculate
the tax due (see Figure 21-4).
As the bookkeeper for a sole proprietor, you’re probably responsible for
pulling together the income, Cost of Goods Sold, and expense information
needed for this form. In most cases, you then hand off this information to
the business’s accountant to fill out all the required forms.
As a sole proprietor, you can choose to file as a corporation even if you aren’t
legally incorporated. You may want to do this because corporations have more
allowable deductions and you can pay yourself a salary, but there’s a lot of
extra paperwork, and your accountant’s fees will be much higher if you decide
to file as a corporation. However, because corporations pay taxes on the sepa-
rate legal entity, this option may not make sense for your business. Talk with
your accountant to determine the best tax structure for your business.

If you do decide to report your business income as a separate corporate
entity, you must file Form 8832, Entity Classification Election with the IRS.
This form, which you can see in Figure 21-5, reclassifies the business, a step
that’s necessary because the IRS automatically classifies a business owned
by one person as a sole proprietorship.

Filing Tax Forms for Partnerships
If your business is structured as a partnership (meaning it has more than one
owner), your business doesn’t pay taxes. Instead, all money earned by the
business is split up among the partners.
As a bookkeeper for a partnership, you need to collect the data necessary
to file an information schedule called Schedule K-1 (Form 1065), Partner’s
Share of Income, Deductions, Credits, etc. for each partner. The company’s
accountant will most likely complete the Schedule K-1 forms. You can see
this form in Figure 21-6. The entire information filing for the company is
called Form 1065.

Any partner receiving a Schedule K-1 must report the recorded income on
his or her personal tax return — Form 1040 — by adding an additional form
called Schedule E, Supplemental Income and Loss (see Figures 21-7 and 21-8).
(Schedule E is used to report income from more than just partnership
arrangements; it also has sections for real estate rental and royalties,
estates and trusts, and mortgage investments.)
Unless you’re involved in a real estate rental business, you most likely only
need to fill out page 2 of Schedule E.
In Figure 21-8, pay particular attention to Part II, Income or Loss From
Partnerships and S Corporations. In this section, you report your income or
loss as passive or nonpassive income, a distinction that your accountant
can help you sort out.

Paying Corporate Taxes
Corporations come in two varieties, S corporations and C corporations; as
you may expect, each has unique tax requirements and practices. In fact, not
even all corporations file tax returns. Some smaller corporations are desig-
nated as an S Corporation and pass their earnings on to their stockholders.
Check with your accountant to determine whether incorporating your business
makes sense for you. Tax savings isn’t the only issue you have to think about;
operating a corporation also increases administrative, legal, and accounting
costs. Be sure that you understand all the costs before incorporating.

Part V: Reporting Results and Starting Over 

Reporting for an S corporation
An S corporation must have fewer than 75 stockholders. It functions like a part-
nership but gives owners more legal protection from lawsuits than traditional
partnerships do. Essentially, an S corporation is treated as a partnership for
tax purposes, but its tax forms are a bit more complicated than a partnership’s:
All income and losses are passed on to the owners of the S Corporation and
reported on each owner’s tax return, and owners also report their income
and expenses on Schedule E (see Figures 21-7 and 21-8).
Reporting for a C corporation
The type of corporation that’s considered a separate legal entity for tax pur-
poses is the C corporation. A C corporation is a legal entity that has been
formed specifically for the purpose of running a business.
The biggest disadvantage of structuring your company as a C corporation is
that your profits are taxed twice — as a corporate entity and based on divi-
dends paid to stockholders. If you’re the owner of a C corporation, you can
be taxed twice, but you can also pay yourself a salary and therefore reduce
the earnings of the corporation. Corporate taxation is very complicated, with
lots of forms to be filled out, so I don’t go into great detail here about how to
file corporate taxes. However, Table 21-2 shows you the tax rates C corpora-
tions are subject to.

Chapter 21: Satisfying the Tax Man

You may think that C corporation tax rates look a lot higher than personal tax
rates, but in reality, many corporations don’t pay tax at all or pay taxes at much
lower rates than you do. As a corporation, you have plenty of deductions and
tax loopholes to use to reduce your tax bites. So even though you, the busi-
ness owner, may be taxed twice on the small part of your income that’s paid
in dividends, you’re more likely to pay less taxes overall.
Taking Care of Sales Taxes Obligations
Even more complicated than paying income taxes is keeping up-to-date on
local and state tax rates and paying your business’s share of those taxes to the
government entities. Because tax rates vary from county to county, and even
city to city in some states, managing sales taxes can be very time-consuming.
Things get messy when you sell products in multiple locations. For each 
location, you must collect from customers the appropriate tax for that area,
keep track of all taxes collected, and pay those taxes to the appropriate gov-
ernment entities when due. In many states, you have to collect and pay local
(for the city or county governments) and state taxes.
An excellent Web site for data about state and local tax requirements is the
Tax and Accounting Sites Directory at www.taxsites.com/state.html.
This site has links for state and local tax information for every state. 
States require you to file an application to collect and report taxes even
before you start doing business in that state. Be sure that you contact the
departments of revenue in the states you plan to operate stores before you
start selling and collecting sales tax.
To get an idea of what you face in the way of state tax forms, check out
Figures 21-9 and 21-10, which show the two-page Sales and Use Tax Return
from the state of Florida. In Florida, you have to file this form monthly,
between the first and 19th days of the following month — it’s considered
late on the 20th day of the month.
All sales taxes collected from your customers are paid when you send in the
Sales and Use Tax Return for your state — you must have the cash available
to pay this tax when the forms are due. Any money you collected from cus-
tomers during the month should be kept in an account called Accrued Sales
Taxes, which is actually a Liability account on your balance sheet because it’s
money owed to a governmental entity. (For more on the balance sheet, see
Chapter 18.)

Prepping the Books for
a New Accounting Cycle
In This Chapter
 Wrapping up General Ledger accounts
 Looking back through customer accounts
 Checking for unpaid vendor bills
 Clearing out unnecessary accounts
 Transitioning into a new accounting cycle
I
n bookkeeping, an accounting period, or cycle, can be one month, a quar-
ter, or a year (or other division of time if it makes business sense). At the
end of every accounting period, certain accounts need to be closed while
others remain open.
Just as it’s best to add accounts to your bookkeeping system at the beginning
of a year (so you don’t have to move information from one account to another),
it’s best to wait until the end of the year to delete any accounts you no longer
need. With this approach, you start each year fresh with only the accounts
you need to best manage your business’s financial activities.
In this chapter, I explain the accounts that must be closed and start with a
zero balance in the next accounting cycle (see Chapter 2 for more detail
about the accounting cycle), such as revenues and costs of goods sold. I
also review the accounts that continue from one accounting cycle to the
next, such as assets and liabilities. In addition, I discuss the process of clos-
ing the books at year-end and how you begin a new accounting cycle for the
next year.

Finalizing the General Ledger
After you complete your accounting work for the accounting cycle in which
your business operates, it’s time to reexamine your General Ledger. Some
accounts in the General Ledger need to be zeroed out so that they start the
new accounting cycle with no detail from the previous cycle, while other
accounts continue to accumulate detail from one cycle to the next. When you
break down the General Ledger, the balance sheet accounts carry forward
into the next accounting cycle, and the income statement accounts start with
a zero balance.
Zeroing out income statement accounts
When you’re sure that you’ve made all needed corrections and adjustments
to your accounts and you have your cycle-end numbers, you can zero out all
General Ledger accounts listed on the income statement — that’s revenues,
Cost of Goods Sold, and expense accounts. Because the income statement
reflects the activities of an accounting period, these accounts always start
with a zero balance at the beginning of an accounting cycle.
If you use a computerized accounting system, you may not actually have to
zero out the income statement accounts. For example, QuickBooks adjusts
your income and expenses accounts at cycle-end to zero them out so you
start with a zero net income, but it maintains the data in an archive so you’re
always able to access it. You can set your closing date on the Company
Preferences tab of the Preferences box (see Figure 22-1). To control who can
make changes to prior year accounts, you should also click Set Password
(see Figure 22-2) to set a special password for editing closed accounts.
Figure 22-1:

closing date

accounts in

318
Part V: Reporting Results and Starting Over 

Carrying over balance sheet accounts
Unlike income statement accounts, you never zero out the accounts listed on
a balance sheet — that’s assets, liabilities, and equity. Instead, you note your
ending balances for each of these accounts so you can prepare a balance
sheet (see Chapter 18), and you carry forward the data in the accounts into
the next accounting period. The balance sheet just gives you a snapshot of
the financial state of your company as of a particular date in time. From one
accounting cycle to the next, your assets and (unfortunately) liabilities
remain, and you also need to maintain the information about how much
equity your investors have put into the company.
Conducting Special Year-End
Bookkeeping Tasks
Before you start the process of closing the books for the year, print a summary
of your account information from your computerized accounting system. If you
make an error while closing the books, you can always use this printout to
backtrack and fix any problems.
QuickBooks provides a Year-End Guide Checklist (see Figure 22-3) to help you
keep track of all the year-end activities you need to do. The checklist also
includes links to help screens that explain how to do all the year-end closing
tasks. You can check off each task as you complete it and save the check-
marks to keep track of your progress during the closing process.
After you complete all your year-end tasks, you can condense and back up all
your accounting data for the year being closed. Most computerized account-
ing systems have a process for condensing and archiving data. For example,
QuickBooks’s Archive And Condense wizard guides you through the process
(see Figure 22-4).

Chapter 22: Prepping the Books for a New Accounting Cycle

Checking customer accounts
As you prepare your books for the end of an accounting cycle, review your
customer accounts. Unless it’s the end of the year, you don’t close the
Accounts Receivable account, and when you start a new accounting cycle,
you certainly want to carry over any balance still due from customers.

Part V: Reporting Results and Starting Over 

Before closing your books at the end of the accounting cycle, it’s a good idea
to review customer accounts for possible bad debt expenses. (I talk about
bad debt in greater detail in Chapter 9.) Now’s the time to be more critical
of past due accounts. You can use any bad debt to reduce your tax bite, so if
you believe that a customer isn’t likely to make good on a past due account,
write off the loss.
Assessing vendor accounts
The end of an accounting period is the perfect time to review your vendor
accounts to be sure they’re all paid in full and ready for the new cycle. Also,
make sure that you’ve entered into your vendor accounts any bills that
reflect business activity in the period being closed; otherwise, expenses from
the period may not show up in the appropriate year-end financial statements.
Review any outstanding purchase orders to be sure that your vendor
accounts aren’t missing orders that have been completed but not yet billed
by the vendor. For example, if you received inventory on December 23 but
the vendor won’t bill for that inventory until January, you should record the
bill in December to reflect the receipt of that inventory during that tax year.
Deleting accounts
The closing process at the end of an accounting year is a good time to assess
all your open accounts and verify that you still need them. If an account has
no transactions in it, you’re free to delete it at any time. However, you should
wait until the end of the year to delete any accounts that you don’t think
you’ll need in the next year. If you’re assessing accounts at the end of an
accounting period that isn’t also the end of the year, just make a list of the
accounts to be deleted and wait for the year-end.
If you use a computerized accounting system, be aware that deleting an
account deletes all past transactions in that account as well. So if you want
to delete an account at the end of the year, you should mark the account as
inactive instead so that new transactions can’t be entered into the account
inadvertently.
Starting the Cycle Anew
You certainly don’t want to close the doors of your business as you prepare
all your year-end reports, such as the financial statements and governmental
321
Chapter 22: Prepping the Books for a New Accounting Cycle

reports — after all, that can be a two- to three-month process. So you need to
continue making entries for the new year as you close the books for the pre-
vious year.
If you do the books manually, you probably need easy access to two sets of
books: the current year and the previous year. In a manual bookkeeping
system, you just start new journal pages for each of the active accounts.
If you have some accounts that aren’t very active, rather than start a new
page, you can leave some space for adjustments or corrections, draw a line,
and start the transactions for the new year on the same page.
If you keep your books using a computerized accounting system, you can
zero out the necessary accounts to start the new year while leaving the data
for the previous year in the password-protected, closed accounts. You can
still make changes to those closed accounts, but access is limited to people
who know the password — most likely you, your accountant, and your book-
keeping manager.
Part of closing out your books is starting new files for each of your accounts.
Most businesses keep two years of data, the current year and the previous
year, in the on-site office files and put older files into storage. As you start a
new year, box up your two-year-old files for storage and use the newly empty
drawers for the new year’s new files. For example, suppose you’re creating
files for 2006. Keep the 2005 files easily accessible in file cabinet drawers in
your office, but box up the 2004 files for storage. Then keep your 2006 files in
the drawers where the 2004 files had been.
There’s no hard and fast rule about file storage. You may find that you need
to access some files regularly and therefore don’t want to put them in stor-
age. No problem. Pull out any files related to ongoing activity and keep them
in the office so you don’t have to run to the storage area every time you need
the files. For example, if you have an ongoing legal case, you should keep any
files related to that matter out of storage and easily accessible.

Top Ten Ways to Manage Your
Business Cash with Your Books
In This Chapter
 Keeping a handle on internal bookkeeping tools
 Monitoring profits and expenses
 Dealing smartly with vendors, contractors, and customers
M
any business owners think of bookkeeping as a necessary evil, but in
reality, if you make effective use of the data you collect, bookkeeping can
be your best buddy when it comes to managing your cash. The key to taking
advantage of what bookkeeping has to offer is understanding the value of basic
bookkeeping principles and using information collected. This chapter reviews
the top ten ways to use your books to help you manage your business cash.
Charting the Way
You may not think that a list of accounts, called the Chart of Accounts, is
worth much attention, but this chart dictates how you collect your financial
data and where in the books you put your company’s transactions. In order
for you to be able to use the information effectively, it’s crucial that your
Chart of Accounts defines each account precisely and determines exactly
what types of transactions go where. (I talk more about the Chart of Accounts
and how to set one up in Chapter 3.)
Balancing Your Entries
Balanced books are the only way to know how your business is doing.
Without them, you can never know whether your profit numbers are 

accurate. In bookkeeping, you use a process called double-entry bookkeeping
to keep the books balanced. I talk more about this basic principle and how to
keep the books balanced in Chapter 2.
Posting Your Transactions
In order to be able to use the information you collect regarding your business
transactions, the transactions must be posted accurately to your accounts. 
If you forgot to post a transaction to your books, your reports won’t reflect
that financial activity, and that’s a serious problem. Or, if you post an incor-
rect transaction to your books, any reports that draw on information will be
wrong — again, a problem. I talk more about the posting process in Chapters
4 and 5.
Tracking Customer Collections
If your business sells to customers on store credit, you certainly want to be
sure your customers pay for their purchases in the future. (Customer account
information is gathered in the Accounts Receivable account as well as in 
individual records for each customer.) You should review reports based on
customer payment history, called aging reports, on a monthly basis to be sure
customers pay on time. Remember that you set the rules for store credit, so
you may want to cut off customers from future purchases if their accounts 
are past due for 90 days or more. I talk more about how to manage customer
accounts in Chapter 9.
Paying Bills Accurately and On Time
If you want to continue getting supplies, products, and services from your
vendors and contractors, you must pay them accurately and on time.
Managing your payments through the Accounts Payable account ensures
accuracy and timeliness, and it also saves you from mistakenly paying bills
twice. To be safe, you should review aging reports on your payment history
to see that your bookkeeper is making timely and accurate payments. I talk
more about managing your payments in Chapter 8.
326
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Planning Profits
Nothing is more important to a business owner than the profits he will ulti-
mately make. Yet many business owners don’t take time to plan their profit
expectations at the beginning of each year, so they have no way to gauge how
well their businesses do throughout the year. Avoid this problem by taking
time before the year starts to develop profit expectations and a budget that
will help you meet those expectations. Then develop a series of internal
financial reports from the numbers in your bookkeeping system to help
determine whether or not you’re meeting your sales targets and maintaining
control over your product costs and operating expenses. I talk more about
sales tracking in Chapter 9, costs and expense tracking in Chapter 8, and how
to determine your net profit in Chapter 19.
Comparing Budget to Actual Expenses
Keeping a careful watch on how well your budget planning reflects what’s
actually happening in your business can help you meet your profit goals. As
with profits (see the preceding section), take time to develop a budget that
sets your expectations for the year, and then develop internal reports that
give you the ability to track how closely your actual expenses match that
budget. If you see any major problems, correct them as soon as possible to
be sure you meet your target profit at the end of the year. I talk more about
internal financial reporting in Chapter 19.
Comparing Sales Goals to Actual Sales
In addition to watching your expenses, you also need to monitor your actual
sales so that they match the sales goals you set at the beginning of the year.
Designing an internal report that tracks sales goals versus actual sales allows
you to monitor how well your business is doing. If you find your actual sales
are below expectations, correct the problem as early in the year as possible
in order to improve your chances of meeting those year-end goals. To find
out how to use internal financial reports to track your sales activity, check
out Chapters 9 and 19.
327
Chapter 23: Top Ten Ways to Manage Your Business Cash with Your Books

Tracking Cost Trends
Awareness of the costs involved in purchasing the products you sell or the
raw materials you use to manufacture your products is very important
because these costs trends can have a major impact on whether or not your
company earns the net income you expect. If you find that the costs are
trending upward, you may need to adjust the prices of the products you sell
in order to meet your profit goals. I talk more about tracking cost trends in
Chapters 8 and 19.
Making Pricing Decisions
Properly pricing your product can be a critical factor in determining whether
or not your product sells. If the price is too high, you may not find any cus-
tomers willing to buy the product; if it’s too low, you lose money.
When determining what price to charge your customers, you must consider a
number of different factors, including how much you pay to buy or manufac-
ture the products you sell, market research about what customers will pay
for a product, what you pay your employees, and advertising and administra-
tive expenses you incur in order to set a price. All these items are factors in
what you’ll spend to sell that product. I talk more about tracking costs and
expenses in Chapters 8 and 19.

Top Ten Most Important Accounts

In This Chapter

 Understanding critical liability accounts
 Taking in money
 Monitoring costs and expenses
 Tracking the owner’s share
E
ach and every account has its purpose in bookkeeping, but all accounts
certainly aren’t created equal. For most companies, some accounts are
more essential than others, so in case you’re having trouble knowing where
to start your account setup and what’s necessary, this chapter looks at the
top must-have accounts for bookkeepers.
Cash
All your business transactions pass through the Cash account, which is 
so important that you actually need two journals, Cash Receipts and Cash
Disbursements to track the activity. (I discuss these journals at length in
Chapter 5.) As the bookkeeper, it’s your responsibility to be sure that all 
cash — whether it’s coming into the business or being sent out — is handled
and recorded properly in the Cash account.

Accounts Receivable
If your company sells its products or services to customers on store credit,
you definitely need an Accounts Receivable account. This is the account
where you track all money due from customers. As the bookkeeper, keeping
Accounts Receivable up-to-date is critical to be sure that you send timely and
accurate bills to customers. I talk more about Accounts Receivable processes
in Chapter 9.
Inventory
Every company must have products to sell. Those money-making products
must be carefully accounted for and tracked because it’s the only way a busi-
ness knows what it has on hand to sell. As the bookkeeper, you contribute to
this process by keeping accurate inventory records in an Inventory account.
The numbers you have in your books are periodically tested by doing physical
counts of the inventory on hand. I talk more about how to manage inventory
and Inventory accounts in Chapter 8.
Accounts Payable
No one likes to send money out of the business, but you can ease the pain
and strain by tracking and paying bills in your Accounts Payable account.
You certainly don’t want to pay anyone twice, but you also want to be sure
you pay bills on time or else your company may no longer get the supplies,
inventory, or other things needed to operate the business. Suppliers often
penalize late-paying companies by cutting them off or putting them on cash-
only accounts. On the flipside, if you pay your bills early, you may be able to
get discounts and save money with suppliers, so the early bird definitely gets
the worm. For more on the Accounts Payable account, check out Chapter 8.
Loans Payable
There’s bound to come a time when your company needs to purchase major
items such as equipment, vehicles, and furniture. Unfortunately, you may find
that you don’t have the money to pay for such purchases. The solution is to
take on long-term loans to be paid over more than a 12-month period. The
Loans Payable account allows you to monitor the activity on these loans, in
order to get and keep the best rates, make all loan payments on time and
accurately. I talk more about the Loans Payable account in Chapter 13.
330
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Sales
No business can operate without taking in cash, mostly through sales of the
company’s products or services. The Sales account is where you track all
incoming revenue collected from these sales. Recording sales in a timely and
accurate manner is a critical job of yours because otherwise you can’t know
how much revenue has been collected every day. To find out more about
sales and the Sales account, see Chapter 9.
Purchases
Purchases are unavoidable. In order to have a tangible product to sell, your
company has to either manufacture the product, in which case you have to
purchase raw materials, or purchase a finished product from a supplier. In
the Purchases account, you track the purchases of any raw materials or fin-
ished goods. The Purchases account is a key component in calculating Cost
of Goods Sold, which you subtract from Sales to find your company’s gross
profit. I talk more about the Purchases account in Chapter 8.
Payroll Expenses
It’s a fact of business that you must pay employees to get them to stay
around. No matter how much you beg, few people want to work for nothing.
To keep up with what is for many businesses their biggest expense, you track
all money paid to employees in the Payroll Expenses account. Accurate main-
tenance of this account is essential because it ensures that all governmental
reports are filed and payroll taxes are paid. And if you don’t take care of these
responsibilities to the government, you’ll find yourself in some serious hot
water. I talk more about payroll obligations and the Payroll Expenses account
in Chapters 10, 11, and 20.
Office Expenses
One key expense that can drain a company’s profits is office expenses. From
paper, pens, and paperclips to expenses related to office machinery, these
expenses tend to creep up if not carefully monitored in the Office Expenses
account. I talk more about the Office Expenses account as well as internal
controls that you can put into place to keep costs down in Chapter 7.
331
Chapter 24: Top Ten Most Important Accounts for Any Bookkeeper

Owner’s Equity
Accounts related to owner’s equity, which is the amount each owner puts
into the business, vary depending upon the type of business for which you
keep the books. Many small businesses are owned by one person or a group
of partners; they’re not incorporated, so no stock shares exist to apportion
ownership. Instead, money put into the business by each of the owners is
tracked in Capital accounts, and any money taken out of the business by the
owners appears in Drawing accounts. In order to be fair to all owners, you
must carefully track all Owner’s Equity accounts. I talk more about business
structures and types of ownership in Chapter 21. I discuss Owner’s Equity
accounts in Chapter 18.
Retained Earnings
The Retained Earnings account tracks any profits made by the company that
are reinvested for growing the company and not paid out to company owners.
This account is cumulative, which means it shows a running total of earnings
that have been retained since the company opened its doors. Although man-
aging this account doesn’t take you a lot of time, the ongoing accuracy of the
Retained Earnings account is important to investors and lenders who want to
track how well the company is doing. I talk more about retained earnings in
Chapter 18.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Appendix
Glossary
Accounts Payable: An account used to record money due to vendors, contrac-
tors, and consultants for products or services purchased by the company.
Accounts Receivable: An account used to record income not yet received on
products sold or services provided to customers that will be collected at a
later date.
accrual accounting: The accounting method used by most businesses today.
Transactions are recorded when they actually occur, even if cash has not
changed hands. Income is recorded when it’s earned (not when the business
is actually paid for the products or services), and expenses are counted when
goods or services are received, even if the business has not yet paid for the
goods or services.
amortization: An accounting method used to show the using up of an intangi-
ble asset by writing off a portion of the asset’s value each year.
arm’s length transaction: An exchange of assets, products, or services
between two unrelated or unaffiliated parties or, if the parties are related,
conducted as if the parties were unrelated to avoid the appearance of 
conflict of interest.
assets: All things owned by the business, such as cash, buildings, vehicles,
furniture, and any other item that’s used to run the business.
average costing: An accounting method used to value inventory by calculat-
ing an average cost per unit sold.
bad debts expense: A categorization used to write off customer accounts
that are determined to be not collectible.
cash basis accounting: An accounting method that’s based on actual cash
flow. Expenses are recorded only when the company actually pays out cash
for the goods or services, and income is recorded only when the company
collects cash from the customer.
credits: Accounting entries that increase Liability or Income accounts and
decrease Asset or Expense accounts. They always appear on the right-hand
side of an accounting entry.

current assets: All items owned by the company that are expected to be
used in the next 12 months. This includes items, like cash, that can be easily
liquidated. Other examples include cash equivalents, Accounts Receivable,
inventory, marketable securities, and prepaid expenses.
current liabilities: All financial obligations owed by the company in less than
12 months, such as Accounts Payable (money due to vendors, contractors
and consultants) and Credit Cards Payable (payments due on credit cards).
debits: Accounting entries that increase Asset or Expense accounts and
decrease Liability and Income accounts. They always appear on the left-hand
side of an accounting entry.
de minimis benefits: Items that have so little value that it’s unreasonable or
administratively impracticable to track them. Cash, no matter how little, never
qualifies as a de minimis benefits and therefore is never excludable from tax
calculations.
depreciation: An accounting method used to reduce the value of an asset
over a set number of years to show that an asset is being used up and its
value is diminishing.
Equity accounts: Used to track the value of things owned by the company
owners or shareholders after accounting for liabilities.
expenses: All costs of operating a business.
First-In, First Out (FIFO): An accounting method used to value inventory that
assumes the first items put on the shelf are the first items sold.
General Journal entries: Any entries made to correct or adjust balances in
the General Ledger accounts.
General Ledger: A summary of all historical transactions that ever occurred
since the business first opened its doors. This ledger is the granddaddy of
your business’ financial information.
income: All the earnings of a business.
intangible assets: Anything the company owns that has value but can’t be
touched, such as licenses, patents, trademarks, and brand names.
Last In, First Out (LIFO): An accounting method used to value inventory that
assumes the last items put on the shelf are the first items sold.
liabilities: All debts the business owes, such as Accounts Payable, Bonds
Payable, and Mortgages Payable.
334
Bookkeeping For Dummies 

long-term assets: All things a company owns that are expected to be due in
more than 12 months, such as buildings, factories, vehicles, and furniture.
Lower of Cost or Market (LCM): An accounting method used to value inventory
based on whichever is lower: the actual cost of the inventory or its current
market value.
net profit: The bottom line after all costs, expenses, interest, taxes, deprecia-
tion, and amortization are accounted for. Net profit reflects how much money
the company makes.
operating cash flow: The cash generated by a company’s operations to pro-
duce and sell its products.
operating expenses: Expenses incurred by a company in order to continue
its operations, such as advertising, equipment rental, store rental, insurance,
legal and accounting fees, entertainment, salaries, office expenses, repairs
and maintenance, travel, utilities, vehicles, and just about anything else that
goes into operating a business and isn’t directly involved in selling a com-
pany’s products.
operating profit: A measure of a company’s earning power from its ongoing
operations.
periodic inventory method: Tracking inventory a company has on hand
by doing a physical count of inventory on a periodic basis, whether daily,
monthly, yearly, or any other time period that meets a business’s needs.
perpetual inventory method: Tracking inventory a company has on had by
adjusting the inventory counts after each transaction. A computerized inven-
tory control system is needed to manage inventory using this method.
petty cash: All cash kept on hand at business locations for incidental
expenses.
point of sale: The location where customers pay for products or services
they want to buy, such as a register or service counter.
retained earnings: An account used to track any net profits left in the business
from accounting period to accounting period and that are reinvested in the
business for future growth.
specific identification: An accounting method used to value inventory based
on the actual items sold and their individual costs.
tangible assets: Any items owned by the business that can be held in one’s
hand or touched, such as cash, inventory, or vehicles.

Appendix: Glossary

workman’s compensation: State-mandated protection for employees who are
injured on the job or become sick because of the job. The worker’s job is pro-
tected. (A worker can’t be terminated just because he’s injured on the job or
because he has filed a workman’s compensation claim.) In addition, all med-
ical expenses incurred because of the injury are paid by the employer, and
the worker’s pay is continued while he recovers from the injury or sickness.
