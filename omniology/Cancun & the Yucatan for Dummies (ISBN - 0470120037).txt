About the Authors
Victoria Veilleux (who wrote Chapters 1 through 12, 16 and 17, 
and the Appendix) travels extensively around the world as a travel
writer, uncovering the ins and outs of vacation destinations — from
the best places to eat, stay, and play, to the most efficient ways to go
about it. In fact, Victoria’s efficient travel planning secured her the
winning title of a scavenger hunt circumnavigating the globe in 23
days. She has traveled all over Mexico and personally visited each
and every hotel and restaurant listed in this guide (in the chapters
that she covered) to share her expert insights on how to make the
most out of your time in Cancún and the Yucatán. She currently
serves as Travel Editor for Private Air Magazine (for those who
travel by private jet), and as a contributor to several publications
ranging from Islands, Food Arts, Healing Lifestyles & Spas, and LIFE to
Condé Nast Traveler’s www.concierge.com.
David Baird (who wrote Chapters 13, 14, and 15) is a writer, editor,
and translator who feels uncomfortable writing about himself in
the third person (too much like writing his own obituary). Now
based in Austin, Texas, he spent years living in various parts of
Mexico, Brazil, Peru, and Puerto Rico. But, whenever possible, he
manages to get back to the turquoise-blue waters of the Yucatán
because he thinks he looks good in that color, and because he’s
excessively fond of the local cooking.
Authors’ Acknowledgments
A special thanks to the many taxi drivers, hoteliers, chefs, and other
in-the-know Mexicans that I bombarded endlessly with questions.
Further kudos goes out to Lynne Bairstow for a great foundation
upon which to build, Israel Urbina, Roger Sauri, Sue McGill-Kauffman,
Soozi Eichler, and of course Les, my husband, photographer, and
favorite amigo, who made the whole process so much more fun.
— Victoria Veilleux
I would like to acknowledge my indebtedness to the irrepressible
Desiré Sanromán, a Cozumeleña who knows her island and
befriended me for reasons that are not quite clear (sympathy?
pity? concern for the readers I might mislead?). I would also thank
that most capable of guides, Claudia Hurtado Valenzuela, who
opened the doors of the Riviera Maya to me, and whose views on
all matters touristic were well worth hearing.

Cancún & the Yucatán For Dummies, 3rd Edition

Introduction
M
exico’s Yucatán peninsula not only offers travelers some of the
best beaches in the world, but it also presents a rich, 1,000-year-
old culture and amazing natural wonders to explore. Whether it’s the
ancient Maya pyramids or the Caribbean reef off Cancún and Cozumel,
this spectacular coastline is a virtual playground for travelers. In addi-
tion to the many natural attractions, the Yucatán’s beach resorts add
golf, tennis, diving, and abundant watersports to their many lures. 
In October 2005, Wilma, a category-five hurricane and the strongest
storm to ever form in the Atlantic, crept over the Yucatán’s coastline like
a holiday grim reaper for an unprecedented 64 hours. Hotels and restau-
rants became eerie metal skeletons, craggy rocks replaced the sandy
beach, and the lush mangroves were left barren and forlorn. Luckily, this
blowhard put new wind in the sails of the tourism industry, which made
the hotels even more exclusive, the beaches wider, and the overall vibe
decidedly more upscale. 
In the following pages, we streamline the options, focusing on the high
points (and warning you about the low points) of each vacation spot.
Since this book covers a specific area and the most traveled-to region
among Mexico’s beach resorts, we’re able to focus on the most popular
(and most exciting) destinations. Through straightforward tips, we offer
how to get there, what to expect when you arrive, where to stay, where
to eat, and where to have big fun.
Cancún & the Yucatán For Dummies rescues you from both information
overload and detail deficit — those annoying syndromes that afflict far
too many would-be travelers. We give you enough specifics to help you
figure out and plan the type of trip you want and steer clear of the type
of trip you don’t want.
Dummies Post-it® Flags
As you’re reading this book, you’ll find information that you’ll want to reference as you
plan or enjoy your trip — whether it be a new hotel or a must-see attraction. Mark
these pages with the handy Post-it® Flags that are included in this book to help make
your trip planning easier!

About This Book
You can use this book in three ways:
 As a trip planner: Whether you’ve already decided on Cancún or
are still considering your options along the Riviera Maya, this book
helps you zero in on the ideal beach resort for you. It guides you
through all the necessary steps of making your travel arrange-
ments, from finding the cheapest airfare and considering travel
insurance to figuring out a budget. Chapters are self-contained, so
you don’t have to read them in order. Just flip to the chapters as
you need them.
 As a beach-resort guide: Pack this book along with your 
sunscreen — it will come in just as handy while you’re away. 
Turn to the appropriate destination chapters whenever you need 
to find the best beaches, a good place to eat, a worthwhile boat
cruise, a challenging golf course, the lowdown on a hot nightspot,
or tips on any other diversions.
 For an enjoyable overview: If you want a feel for Cancún and the
other popular beach resorts on Mexico’s Yucatán peninsula, read
this book from start to finish to get a taste of all the highlights.
Travel information is subject to change at any time — call ahead for con-
firmation when making your travel plans. Your safety is important to us
(and to the publisher), so we encourage you to stay alert and be aware of
your surroundings. Keep a close eye on cameras, purses, and wallets —
all favorite targets of thieves and pickpockets.
Conventions Used in This Book
Two of us collaborated on this book, but we each cover different desti-
nations in the Yucatán. That’s why although we call ourselves “we” in
the first nine chapters, in each destination chapter the “we” turns into
“I” — so you get the benefit of our individual opinions. (To find out who
wrote which chapters, see our “About the Author” information at the
front of the book.)
In this book, we use the Mexican method for providing street addresses.
Using this style, the building number comes after the street name, not
before it. For example, if a hotel has a building number of 22 and is
located on Calle Atocha (Atocha Street), the address is written as Calle
Atocha 22. Likewise, in many towns, you often come across an address
in which the building has no number. In these cases, the address is writ-
ten Calle Atocha s/n, where s/n stands for sin número (without number).
Another common abbreviation used in Mexico is Sm. followed by a
number, which stands for the supermanzana it is located within — a
group of residential or commercial buildings typically situated around a
park or a square. 
Cancún & the Yucatán For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
2

In this book, we include reviews of our favorite hotels and restaurants,
as well as information about the best attractions within the Yucatán. As
we describe each listing, we use abbreviations for commonly accepted
credit cards. Here’s what those abbreviations stand for:
AE (American Express)
DC (Diners Club)
DISC (Discover Card)
MC (MasterCard)
V (Visa)
We also include some general pricing information to help you as you
decide where to unpack your bags or where to dine on the local cuisine.
We use a system of dollar signs (in U.S. dollars) to show a range of costs
so that you can make quick comparisons.
Prices in this book are quoted only in U.S. dollars, because most hotels
in Mexico quote prices in U.S. dollars. So, although the value of the peso
continues to fluctuate, such currency fluctuations are unlikely to affect
the hotel rates.
Unless we say otherwise, the lodging rates given are for two people
spending one night in a standard double room. At the end of each listing,
we give prices for both high season — the most popular travel time that
runs roughly from Christmas to Easter — and the generally lower-priced
summer season (or low season). At the top of the listing, the dollar sign
pricing system indicates the high-season rates. Some hotel rates are
much higher than others no matter what time of year it is. 
Don’t be too quick to skip an accommodations that seems out of your
price range. Some rates include breakfast, both breakfast and dinner, or
even three meals per day. Other resorts are all-inclusive, which means that
after you pay for your room, you never have to dip into your pocket again
for meals, beverages, tips, taxes, most activities, or transportation to and
from the airport. Also, the Internet is a jackpot of golden opportunities to
score a much better deal, either through the hotel Web site or through
online travel consortiums like Expedia.com and so on. So, although a
price tag may seem sky-high at first, you may actually find it affordable
upon second glance. The dining rates are for main courses only.
Check out the following table to decipher the dollar signs:

Introduction 3

Foolish Assumptions
As we wrote this book, we made some assumptions about you and what
your needs may be as a traveler. Here’s what we assumed about you:
 You may be an inexperienced traveler looking for guidance when
determining whether to take a trip to Cancún (or one of the other
beach resorts of the Yucatán) and how to plan for it.
 You may be an experienced traveler who hasn’t had much time to
explore the Yucatán or its beaches and wants expert advice when
you finally do get a chance to enjoy some time in the sun.
 You’re not looking for a book that provides all the information avail-
able about Mexico or that lists every hotel, restaurant, or attraction
available to you. Instead, you’re looking for a book that focuses on
the places that offer the best or most unique experiences in the
beach resorts of the Yucatán.
How This Book Is Organized
We have divided this book into six parts. The chapters within each part
cover specific subjects in detail. Skip around as much as you like. You
don’t have to read this book in any particular order. In fact, think of
these pages as a buffet: You can consume whatever you want — and no
one cares if you eat the flan for dessert before you have the enchiladas.
For each beach resort, we include a section at the end of each chapter
called “Fast Facts.” These sections give you handy information that you
may need when traveling in Mexico, including phone numbers and
addresses to use in an emergency, area hospitals and pharmacies,
names of local newspapers and magazines, locations for maps, and
more.
Part I: Introducing Cancún and the Yucatán
In this part, we compare and contrast the Yucatán’s most popular beach
resorts so that you can decide which place best suits your tastes and
needs. Sure, they all have gorgeous beaches, but that’s where the simi-
larities end. To help you plan a vacation that’s tailored to your prefer-
ences, this part guides you through the process of figuring out which
resort or resorts are best for you.
We also give you a brief overview of the area’s history, local customs,
cuisine, language, and fiestas and celebrations. We take you through the
best — and worst — times of year to travel and explain the differences
between high season and low season. We also tell you about special holi-
days that may help you decide when to visit this part of Mexico.

Part II: Planning Your Trip to Cancún 
and the Yucatán
Here is where we lay out everything you need to make all the arrange-
ments for your trip. We start by helping you manage your money,
explaining how to estimate the total cost of your vacation. We help you
decide whether to use a travel agent, a packager, or the Internet. We
offer advice on finding the best airfare — and airline — for your destina-
tion. We also offer special trip-planning advice for families, singles, gay
and lesbian travelers, seniors, and travelers who are physically chal-
lenged. Finally, we take you through all the ins and outs of other vaca-
tion essentials, from getting a passport and considering travel insurance
to staying safe. 
Part III: Discovering Cancún
Welcome to Mexico’s most popular beach resort. This area is a great
destination for first-time travelers to Mexico. Why? Because it has all the
comforts of home (familiar restaurant and hotel chains along with great
shopping), plus easy access to diverse cultural and geographical activi-
ties (excursions to the ancient ruins of Tulum, covered in Chapter 15),
world-class scuba diving, and plenty of Mexican fiestas. All the details
for getting to, eating at, staying in, and playing at all of Cancún’s hot
spots are provided in this section.
Part IV: Traveling Around Isla Mujeres and Cozumel
Staying on a tropical island is a dream for many, and these two island
getaways, not far from Cancún, offer a distinctive, relaxed vacation expe-
rience. Although Isla Mujeres is actually an older tourist town than its
sister across the channel, it’s a decidedly laid-back antidote to the non-
stop activity of Cancún. Cozumel’s calling card has always been its
myriad water activities, mostly centered around the famous reef that
outlines the southwest coast. If you’re looking for a diver’s paradise, you
can stop and get off the boat at Cozumel! Cozumel is increasingly becom-
ing one of the most popular ports-of-call for cruise ships. 
Part V: Exploring the Yucatán
Farther south along the mainland from Cancún, the Riviera Maya pro-
vides a stunning stretch of pristine beaches, unique towns, and mega-
resorts down to Tulum, in the south. Check out the sizzling hot (as in
popular) town of Playa del Carmen, visit one of the region’s ecoparks, or
see some nearby ancient ruins. In this part you can find all the informa-
tion you need to travel to and around these areas.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
Every For Dummies book has a Part of Tens. In this part, we take a look
at the ten most common myths about Mexico and describe ten of our
favorite regional dishes.

Part I
Introducing Cancún
and the Yucatán

In this part . . .
P
lanning a trip can be daunting — so we’re here to give
you a sense of the place you’re visiting. Mexico’s
Yucatán is a vast part of a varied country with a bevy of
unique beach resorts — plus some amazing archeological
sites. In Chapter 1, we introduce you to the highlights of the
most popular resorts, restaurants, beaches, shopping areas,
and other hot spots. In Chapter 2, we dig a little deeper into
the area, giving you the lowdown on the rich history and
architecture of Cancún and the Yucatán, plus information
about local cuisine, folklore, and language. Chapter 3 helps
you choose the destination that best matches your idea of
the perfect seaside getaway, while Chapter 4 helps you decide
when to go, with special information on local festivals that
you shouldn’t miss.

Discovering the Best of
Cancún & the Yucatán
In This Chapter
 Scoping out Cancún and the Yucatán’s stellar beaches
 Discovering the top places to stay
 Uncovering the best restaurants and nightlife
 Exploring the Yucatán’s most unforgettable places and experiences
T
he Yucatán Peninsula welcomes more visitors than any other part of
Mexico. Its tremendous variety attracts every kind of traveler with
an unequaled mix of sophisticated resorts, rustic inns, ancient Maya cul-
ture, exquisite beaches, and exhilarating adventures.
Between the two of us, we’ve logged thousands of miles crisscrossing
the peninsula, and these are our personal favorites — the best places 
to go, the best restaurants, the best hotels, and must-see, one-of-a-kind
experiences.
The Best Beach Vacations
Cancún and the Yucatán have a multitude of stunning beaches — 
considered the best in Mexico. Known for powdery white sand and 
crystal-clear waters, these settings are what make great vacations. The
following are our favorite beach getaways:
 Cancún: Essentially one long ribbon of white sand bordering aqua-
marine water, Cancún has one of Mexico’s most beautifully situated
beaches. If you want tropical drinks brought to you while you
lounge in the sand, this is the place for you. Although Cancún has a
reputation as a bustling, modern mega-resort, it’s also a great place
for exploring Caribbean reefs, tranquil lagoons, and the surround-
ing jungle. The most tranquil waters and beaches on Cancún Island
are those at the northern tip, facing the Bahía de Mujeres. See
Chapter 11.

 Isla Mujeres: If laid-back is what you’re after, this idyllic island
offers peaceful, small-town beach life at its best. Most accommoda-
tions are smaller, inexpensive inns, with a few unique, luxurious
places tossed in. Bike — or take a golf cart — around the island to
explore rocky coves and sandy beaches, or focus your tanning
efforts on the wide beachfront of Playa Norte. Here you’ll find calm
waters and palapa (thatched roof) restaurants, where you can have
fresh-caught fish for lunch. You’re close to great diving and snorkel-
ing just offshore, as well as to Isla Contoy National Park, which fea-
tures great bird life and its own dramatic, uninhabited beach. If all
that tranquillity starts to get to you, you’re only a ferry ride away
from the action in Cancún. See Chapter 12.
 Cozumel: It may not have lots of big, sandy beaches, but Cozumel
has something the mainland doesn’t: the calm, waveless waters of
the sheltered western shore. The sea is so calm and full of marine
life that it’s like swimming in an aquarium. See Chapter 13.
 Playa del Carmen: This is one of our absolute favorite Mexican
beach vacations. Stylish and hip, Playa del Carmen offers a beauti-
ful beach and an eclectic assortment of small hotels, inns, and all-
inclusives. The social scene is focused on the beach by day and the
pedestrian-only Avenida 5 by night, with its fun assortment of
restaurants, clubs, sidewalk cafes, and shops. You’re also close 
to the coast’s major attractions, including nature parks, ruins, 
and cenotes (sinkholes or natural wells). Cozumel Island is just a
quick ferry trip away. Enjoy it while it’s a manageable size. See
Chapter 14.
 Tulum: Fronting some of the best beaches on the entire coast,
Tulum’s small palapa hotels offer guests a little slice of paradise far
from crowds and mega-resorts. The bustling town lies inland; at the
coast, things are quiet and will remain so because all these hotels
are small and must generate their own electricity. If you can pull
yourself away from the beach, ruins and a vast nature preserve are
nearby. See Chapter 15.
The Best Luxury Resorts
If money is no object, Cancún and the southern coast of the Yucatán
have no shortage of places to park yourself in style. There’s a string of
terrific upscale hotels in Cancún’s hotel zone, with a growing array of
luxury resorts as you head south along the Yucatán’s Riviera Maya.
As an added bonus, most of the Yucatán’s resorts have recently added
brand-new spas that raise the art of relaxation and pampering to a new
level. What could be better than a massage on the beach? (Maybe a mas-
sage on the beach with a margarita, too?)
Part I: Introducing Cancún & the Yucatán 
10

The following are a few of our favorite luxury resorts:
 The Ritz-Carlton Cancún: Perhaps it goes without saying that Ritz-
Carlton runs one of the finest hotels in Cancún, but what you may
not know is that it’s considered one of the finest hotels in Mexico,
and the only beachfront hotel in the world to be awarded three
AAA Five-Diamond ratings. From the opulent décor and unparal-
leled service to the award-winning dining venues, a Ritz is a Ritz is
a Ritz; need we say more? See Chapter 10.
 Le Blanc Spa Resort: This adults-only all-inclusive resort spared 
no expense in creating one of the most unique spa experiences in
Cancún. This design hotel’s clean geometric lines and an all-white
color scheme blend seamlessly into the white-sand beach and offer
a more modern take on luxury. In addition to the 2,695 sq. m (29,000
sq. ft.) of nonstop pampering at the spa, guests can enjoy a unique
selection of restaurants, a chilled scene around the infinity pool,
and live music nightly, creating the ideal escape for friends seeking
a low-key getaway or a romantic interlude for two. See Chapter 10.
 JW Marriott Cancún Resort & Spa: A step up from its sister resort
next door, JW is the crème de la crème of the Marriott mogul empire.
With its meandering pools (not to mention a one-of-a-kind scuba
training pool and PADI instruction), incredible balcony views, top-of-
the-line amenities, and virtually indestructible hurricane-proof con-
struction, this hotel provides a luxurious escape that doesn’t try to
overshadow its main competitor, the beach. See Chapter 10.
 Presidente InterContinental Cozumel Resort & Spa: A complete
revamping improved just about every aspect of the resort experi-
ence here. Not only have all the rooms been redesigned to be more
attractive and comfortable, but the services this resort now offers
make it stand out as one of the best hotels in the region. See
Chapter 13.
 Ikal del Mar: Small, secluded, and private, Ikal del Mar offers
extraordinary personal service and spa treatments. Rooms spread
out through the jungle, and there’s a beautiful seaside pool and
restaurant. See Chapter 14.
 Maroma: You can’t ask for a better setting for a resort than this
beautiful stretch of Caribbean coast with palm trees and manicured
gardens. You begin to relax before you even take the first sip of
your welcome cocktail. Service is very attentive, and the rooms are
large and luxurious. See Chapter 14.
The Best Good-Value Accommodations
Being on a budget in the Yucatán doesn’t mean you have to sacrifice
style — or the perfect beach vacation. There are plenty of well-priced
options, and here are our favorites:
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Cancún & the Yucatán 11

 Cancún INN Suites El Patio: This European-style inn welcomes
many guests for repeat or long-term stays. Each room is tastefully
decorated, and all surround a plant-filled courtyard. Special pack-
ages combine Spanish lessons and accommodations. It’s an oasis of
cultured hospitality in one of Mexico’s most commercial beach
resorts. See Chapter 10.
 El Rey del Caribe Hotel: Not only will you find exceptional value
here, but you’ll also support a true ecological hotel, which uses envi-
ronmentally sensitive practices from collecting rainwater to com-
posting. Sunny rooms are surrounded by lush jungle landscaping —
and all in the heart of downtown Cancún! See Chapter 10.
 Treetops: An economical, quiet hotel steps from both the beach
and Avenida 5, Treetops could easily get by on its location alone.
But the owners have gone out of their way to create a distinctive
lodging with plenty of amenities. The hotel has its very own cenote
(natural well) and piece of shady jungle, making it a lovely place to
relax after a trying day of strolling the beach and wandering the vil-
lage streets. See Chapter 14.
 Cabañas Tulum: Sure, the rooms aren’t much to look at, but they’re
right on the best beach you’ll ever find — pure-white sand, clear
turquoise water. This place is a pared-down hotel for pure beach
lovers who don’t need the frills; they ask only to be far from the
resort crowds. See Chapter 14.
 Hotel Ojo de Agua: For little money you can have a room on the
water and access to all manner of nonmotorized watersports equip-
ment, including snorkeling and windsurfing. This family-run hotel in
Puerto Morelos has friendly and helpful staff, and offers the conven-
ience of its own dive shop and windsurfing rental. See Chapter 14.
The Most Unique Places to 
Get Away from It All
The Yucatán offers a multitude of unique places to escape the world and
relax in seaside splendor. While some of the specific hotels in this sec-
tion offer more activity than others, all transport you to a truly “away”
state of mind:
 Isla Mujeres: If there’s one island in Mexico that guarantees a
respite from stress, it’s Isla Mujeres. You’ll find an ample selection
of hotels and restaurants, and they’re as laid-back as their patrons.
Here life moves along in pure mañana mode. Visitors stretch out
and doze beneath shady palms or languidly stroll about. For many,
the best part about this getaway is that it’s comfortably close to
Cancún’s international airport, as well as shopping and dining,
should you choose to reconnect. See Chapter 12.
Part I: Introducing Cancún & the Yucatán 
12

 La Casa de los Sueños Resort & Spa Zenter: This intimate inn com-
bines the sense of being at a private villa with the ideal comple-
ments of a holistic spa, daily yoga classes, and delectable cuisine
served from the on-site restaurant. The resort’s private pier is an
ideal launch for snorkeling, with Garrafon Reef just offshore — not
to mention, the ideal spot for a luxury destination wedding cere-
mony. See Chapter 12.
 Na Balam: One of Isla’s older hotels, it has made a name for itself
as a favored center of yoga retreats and workshops. Set on a broad
stretch of beach, this unique inn allows you to indulge in a daily
offering of yoga, Tai Chi, or meditation, making it an ideal place for
a change in attitude. Its restaurant offers healthful cuisine and veg-
etarian options. See Chapter 12.
 The Yucatán’s Riviera Maya: Away from the busy resort of Cancún,
a string of quiet getaways, including Capitán Lafitte, Paamul, Punta
Bete, and a portion of Xpu-ha, offer tranquillity on beautiful beaches
at low prices. See Chapter 14.
 Hotel Jungla Caribe: In a town filled with exceptional inns, this
one’s a standout. The eclectic décor combines neoclassical details
with a decidedly tropical touch. The rooms and suites surround a
stylish courtyard, restaurant, and pool. You couldn’t be better
located — 1 block from the beach, with an entrance on happening
Avenida 5. See Chapter 14.
 Deseo Hotel + Lounge: Perhaps it should be Hotel = Lounge. That
may be an overstatement, but the lounge is at the center of every-
thing, making Deseo the perfect fit if you’re an outgoing type who is
into an alternative lodging experience. Although it may be too lively
for some looking to truly get away from it all, for others, the scene
here is an ideal departure from everyday life. See Chapter 14.
 Tulum: Near the Tulum ruins, about two dozen beachside palapa
inns offer some of the most peaceful getaways in the country. This
stretch just may offer the best sandy beaches on the entire coast.
Life here among the birds and coconut palms is decidedly unhur-
ried. See Chapter 15.
The Best Restaurants
Best doesn’t necessarily mean most luxurious. Although some of the
restaurants listed in this section are fancy affairs, others are simple
places to get fine, authentic Yucatecan cuisine:
 Buenos Aires Grill or Puerto Madero: Argentinean cuisine is a
popular dining option in Cancún, making it tough to pick a favorite
spot to enjoy a grilled meaty favorite. We’ve narrowed it down to
Buenos Aires Grill (next to the bullring downtown) serving delec-
table, authentic, and more affordable Argentinean fare and Puerto
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Cancún & the Yucatán 13

Madero (in the Hotel Zone), which is more of a fine-dining experi-
ence accompanied by a wonderful view, ambience, and service. See
Chapter 10.
 Thai: With a dolphin tank serving as a wall, and thatched-roof pago-
das suspended over the lagoon constituting your table, there’s no
doubt that Thai takes the prize for the most unique dining venue in
Cancún’s Hotel Zone. However, the setting doesn’t overshadow the
cuisine, with authentic Thai specialties prepared by a chef from
Bangkok. See Chapter 10.
 La Dolce Vita: A longtime favorite, La Dolce Vita remains untouched
by newer arrivals. Both the downtown location and newer digs in
the Hotel Zone continue to draw diners with such blissful dishes as
green tagliolini with lobster medallions, veal with morels, and fresh
salmon with cream sauce, all served (at night) to the sound of live
jazz music. See Chapter 10.
 Labná: This is such a great “local joint” to enjoy Yucatecan eats after
a hard day of negotiations at Mercado 28 in downtown Cancún. Plus,
if you spent all of your money on souvenirs, you can still afford to try
regional specialties such as pork pibil, papadzules, and poc chuc. See
Chapter 10.
 Lorenzillo’s: Best known for its succulent lobster pulled straight
from the tank and unbeatable sunset views over the lagoon in
Cancún, Lorenzillo’s menu offers one of the biggest varieties of
seafood in the Yucatán. Whole fish cooked to flakey perfection and
shellfish that’s the epitome of freshness draw seafood lovers back
year after year. See Chapter 10.
 Prima: The Italian food here is fresh, fresh, fresh — from the fish to
the vegetables to the pasta and garlic bread. And it’s all prepared
by expert cooks who turn out unforgettable shrimp fettuccine with
pesto, crab ravioli with cream sauce, and crisp house salad in a
chilled bowl. See Chapter 13.
 Media Luna: The inviting atmosphere of this sidewalk cafe on
Avenida 5 is enough to lure you in. The expertly executed and inno-
vative menu, together with great prices, makes it one of the top
choices on the Caribbean coast. See Chapter 14.
 Yaxché: No restaurant in the Yucatán explores the region’s culinary
traditions and use of local ingredients more than this one. Its menu
presents several pleasant surprises and is a welcome relief from the
standard offerings of most Yucatecan restaurants. See Chapter 14.
The Best Activities and Attractions
With the ocean as tempting as it is off the Yucatán coast, you’re certain
to find multiple ways to enjoy it above and below the surface. On dry
land, you can also find plenty of ways to fill your days. Here are our
favorite things to do:
Part I: Introducing Cancún & the Yucatán 
14

 Scuba diving in Cozumel and along the Yucatán’s Caribbean
coast: The coral reefs off the island are among the top-five dive
spots in the world and constitute Mexico’s premier diving destina-
tion. The Yucatán’s coastal reef, part of the second-largest reef
system in the world, affords excellent diving all along the coast.
Especially beautiful is the Chinchorro Reef, lying 32km (20 miles)
offshore from Majahual or Xcalak. Diving from Isla Mujeres is also
quite spectacular. See Chapters 12 and 13.
 Snorkeling: Even if you’re not usually the sporting type, you don’t
want to miss the chance to try snorkeling the same reef system so
highly acclaimed by divers. The waters offshore are so clear that
snorkelers are guaranteed to see clouds of tropical fish in every
color of the rainbow, and possibly even a turtle or two. You can see
a stunningly beautiful underwater world. One of the best places is
El Garrafon Park in Isla Mujeres. See Chapters 11, 12, and 13.
 Cenote diving on the Yucatán Mainland: Dive into the clear
depths of the Yucatán’s cenotes (natural wells) for an interesting
twist on underwater exploration. The Maya considered the cenotes
sacred — and their vivid colors seem otherworldly indeed. Most
are located between Playa del Carmen and Tulum, and dive shops
in these areas regularly run trips for experienced divers. For recom-
mended dive shops, see Chapters 13 and 14.
 Fly-fishing off the Punta Allen and Majahual Peninsulas: Serious
anglers enjoy the challenge of fly-fishing the saltwater flats and
lagoons on the protected sides of these peninsulas. See Chapter 14.
 Birding: The Yucatán Peninsula is an ornithological paradise, with
hundreds of species awaiting the birder’s gaze and list. One very
special place is Isla Contoy, with more than 70 species of birds as
well as a host of marine and animal life. See Chapter 12.
 Getting a bird’s-eye view: On Isla Mujeres, The Panoramic Tower is
the best way to get the lay of the island, not to mention a stunning
view of Cancún. The gentle ride rotates at the top to give you the
perfect 360-degree perspective. See Chapter 12.
The Best Archaeological Sites
In addition to beautiful beaches, the Yucatán also offers a spectacular
glance into this region’s rich history through its various architectural
sites and ruins. These are our top picks for a day trip in the Yucatán:
 Tulum: Some dismiss Tulum as less important than other ruins in
the Yucatán Peninsula, but this seaside Maya fortress is still inspir-
ing. The sight of its crumbling stone walls against the stark contrast
of the clear turquoise ocean just beyond is extraordinary. See
Chapter 15.
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Cancún & the Yucatán 15

 Chichén Itzá: Stand beside the giant serpent head at the foot of the
El Castillo pyramid and marvel at the architects and astronomers
who positioned the building so precisely that shadow and sunlight
form a serpent’s body slithering from peak to the earth at each
equinox (Mar 21 and Sept 21). See Chapter 15.
The Best Nightlife
Although, as expected, Cancún is home to much of the Yucatán’s
nightlife, that resort city isn’t the only place to have a good time after
dark. Along the Caribbean coast, beachside dance floors with live bands
and extended happy hours in seaside bars dominate the nightlife. Here
are some favorite hot spots, from live music in hotel lobby bars to hip
dance clubs:
 Coco Bongo: Many of Cancún’s bars offer good drinks, hot music,
and great dance floors, but Coco Bongo exceeds the rest with its
Las Vegas–type show that is sure to impress, an incredible lineup of
world-class DJs, and plenty of room to get “loco.” See Chapter 11.
 Nectar Bar Lounge: This place is indeed sweet for those looking for
after-hours entertainment. The hip and beautiful hang out at this
Mexico-meets-Miami outdoor venue on the lagoon. Contemporary
outdoor couches, fashion shows projected onto a giant wall, and
tile and glass throughout create a sleek setting to sip martinis until
the sun kisses the horizon. See Chapter 11.
 The City: Currently one of Cancún’s hottest clubs, The City revels
24 hours a day. By day, it is a cool and relaxed beach club called
Playa Cabana, with canvas daybeds for lounging by the pool. By
night, the huge interior transforms into a light show extravaganza
for dancing until wee hours of the night. See Chapter 11.
 Lobby Lounge: Located in Cancún’s luxurious Ritz-Carlton Hotel,
this is the most elegant evening spot on the island. Romantic 
live music, a ceviche bar, martinis, and more than 120 premium
tequilas (plus tastings) allow you to savor the spirit of Mexico. See
Chapter 11.
 Quinta Avenida, Playa del Carmen: Stroll along the lively, pedestrian-
only Fifth Avenue to find the bar that’s right for you. With live music
venues, tequila bars, sports bars, and cafes, you’re sure to find
something to fit your mood. See Chapter 14.

Digging Deeper into 
the Yucatán
In This Chapter
 Uncovering the Yucatán’s fascinating past
 Discovering the delicacies of Yucatán dining
 Mastering a few key words and phrases in Spanish
T
he resorts of Mexico’s Yucatán are known for glorious white-sand
beaches bordering tranquil, translucent waters. It would be easy to
let that be the sole draw to this destination, but there’s so much more
here to enjoy. The Yucatán’s rich history has left mysteries still to be
uncovered and ruins that make for popular explorations. So, what’s the
story behind them? In this chapter, we relay a brief history of the area
and its cultural high-points. We also sample the unusual and memorable
culinary specialties of the region, and provide tips for attempting the
local lingo.
Introducing the Yucatán
A quick look at the geography of the Yucatán Peninsula belies the
uniqueness of this area — although the entire peninsula is a flat slab of
limestone, it is unlike anywhere else on Earth. Millions of years ago, this
area absorbed the force of a giant meteor. The impact sent shock waves
through the brittle limestone, fracturing it throughout, creating an
immense network of fissures that drain all rainwater away from the 
surface.
When driving through northern and central Yucatán, you don’t see any
rivers, lakes, or watercourses. Yet, a vast subterranean basin stretches 
for miles underground, invisible except for the area’s many cenotes —
sinkholes or natural wells that are also a one-of-a-kind phenomenon. Many
are perfectly round vertical shafts (such as the Grand Cenote at Chichén
Itzá); others retain a partial roof, often perforated by tree roots — quiet,
dark, and cool, they are the opposite of the warm, brightly lit outside
world. To the Maya, they were sacred passageways to the underworld.

The ancient Maya left behind elegant and mysterious ruins that, despite
all that we now know, seem to defy interpretation. Almost every year,
archaeological excavation leads to the discovery of more ruins, adding
to a growing picture of an urban civilization that thrived in an area
where only scantily populated jungle now exists. What can we make of
such a civilization? What value do we accord the Maya among the other
lost civilizations of the ancient world? Even this is unclear, but the art
and architecture they left behind are stunning expressions of a rich and
complex cosmological view.
Then there was the arrival of the Spaniards, in the early 1500s — an
event that in hindsight seems almost apocalyptic. Military conquest and
old-world diseases decimated the native population. A new social order
predicated on a starkly different religion rose in place of the old one.
Through all of this, the Maya held on to their language but lost most of
the living memory of their pre-Hispanic ways. What they retained they
cloaked in the language of myth and legend that was worked into a
rough synthesis of old and new. They selectively appropriated elements
of the new religion that could help make sense of the world, and this
process continues today in the many Maya communities that have
native churches.
For these reasons and more, the Yucatán is a curious place; it may
beckon you with its turquoise-blue waters and tropical Caribbean cli-
mate, but what will ultimately hold your attention is the unique charac-
ter of the land and its people. There is no other place like it.
The Land
The Yucatán is edged by the muted aquamarine Gulf of Mexico on the
west and north, and the clear cerulean blue Caribbean Sea on the east,
where the resorts covered in this book are found. The peninsula covers
almost 134,400 sq. km (84,000 sq. miles), with nearly 1,600km (1,000
miles) of shoreline. Most of the land is porous limestone, with thin soil
supporting a primarily low, scrubby jungle. In most of the Yucatán there
is no surface water; instead, rainwater filters through the limestone into
underground rivers.
In the state of Quintana Roo, where Cancún and most of the areas
explored in this book are located, there are several protected areas which
are among the region’s most beautiful, wild, and important. In 1986, the
state ambitiously set aside the 520,000-hectare (1.3 million-acre) Sian
Ka’an Biosphere Reserve, conserving a significant part of the coast in 
the face of development south of Tulum. Isla Contoy, off the coast of Isla
Mujeres and Cancún, is a beautiful island refuge for hundreds of birds, 
turtles, plants, and other wildlife. And in 1990, the 60-hectare (150-acre)

Four of Mexico’s eight marine turtle species — loggerhead, green, hawks-
bill, and leatherback — nest on Quintana Roo’s shores, and more than 
600 species of birds, reptiles, and mammals have been counted.
History 101: The Main Events
Mexico’s history extends much longer that that of her neighbor to the
north. Once the center of civilization in the Western Hemisphere, Mexico’s
ancient inhabitants were sophisticated and cultured. The Yucatán was
home to the Maya, and remnants of their advanced, mysterious civiliza-
tion are still being found, unlocking clues to their fascinating culture.
Modern-day Mexicans are proud of their deep, rich history, and within
many aspects of daily life, you find a nod to the mysticism and sacred 
traditions of ancient times.
Pre-Hispanic civilizations
The earliest “Mexicans” were perhaps Stone Age hunter-gatherers
coming from the north, descendants of a race that had crossed the
Bering Strait and reached North America around 12,000 B.C. This is the
prevailing theory, but there is a growing body of evidence that points to
an earlier crossing of peoples from Asia to the New World. What we
know for certain is that Mexico was populated by 10,000 B.C. Sometime
between 5200 and 1500 B.C. they began practicing agriculture and domes-
ticating animals.
The Pre-Classic Period (1500 B.C.–A.D. 300)
Eventually, agriculture improved to the point that it could provide enough
food to support large communities and enough surplus to free some of the
population from agricultural work. A civilization emerged that we call the
Olmec — an enigmatic people who settled the lower Gulf Coast in what is
now Tabasco and Veracruz. Anthropologists regard them as the mother
culture of Mesoamerica, because they established a pattern for later civi-
lizations in a wide area stretching from northern Mexico into Central
America. The Olmec developed the basic calendar used throughout the
region, established principles of urban layout and architecture, and origi-
nated the cult of the jaguar and the sacredness of jade. They may also
have bequeathed the sacred ritual of the ball game — a universal element
of Mesoamerican culture. In this popular game that was part ritual, part
sport, players on two teams tried to knock a hard rubber ball through one
of the two stone rings placed high on either wall of a ball court, using only
their elbows, knees, and hips (no hands). According to legend, the losing
players paid for defeat with their lives.
The Maya civilization began developing in the pre-Classic period, around
500 B.C. Our understanding of this period is only sketchy, but Olmec
influences are apparent everywhere. The Maya perfected the Olmec cal-
endar and, somewhere along the way, developed their ornate system of
hieroglyphic writing and their early architecture. Two other civilizations
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into the Yucatán 19

also began their rise to prominence around this time: the people of
Teotihuacán, just north of present-day Mexico City, and the Zapotec 
of Monte Albán, in the valley of Oaxaca.
The Classic Period (A.D. 300–900)
The flourishing of these three civilizations marks the boundaries of 
this period — the heyday of pre-Columbian Mesoamerican artistic and
cultural achievements. These include the pyramids and palaces in
Teotihuacán; the ceremonial center of Monte Albán; and the stelae and
temples of Palenque, Bonampak, and the Tikal site in Guatemala. Beyond
their achievements in art and architecture, the Maya made significant
discoveries in science, including the use of the zero in mathematics and
a complex calendar with which the priests could predict eclipses and
the movements of the stars for centuries to come.
The inhabitants of Teotihuacán (100 B.C.–A.D. 700, near present-day
Mexico City) built a city that, at its zenith, is thought to have had
100,000 or more inhabitants covering 14 sq. km (9 sq. miles). It was a
well-organized city, built on a grid with streams channeled to follow the
city’s plan. Different social classes, such as artisans and merchants,
were assigned to specific neighborhoods. Teotihuacán exerted tremen-
dous influence as far away as Guatemala and the Yucatán Peninsula. Its
feathered-serpent god, later known as Quetzalcoatl, became part of the
pantheon of many succeeding cultures, including the Toltecs, who
brought the cult to the Yucatán where the god became known as
Kukulkán. The ruling classes were industrious, literate, and cosmopoli-
tan. The beautiful sculpture and ceramics of Teotihuacán display a
highly stylized and refined aesthetic whose influences can be seen
clearly in objects of Maya and Zapotec origin. Around the seventh cen-
tury, the city was abandoned for unknown reasons. Who these people
were and where they went remain mysteries.
The Post-Classic Period (A.D. 900–1521)
Warfare became a more conspicuous activity of the civilizations that
flourished in this period. Social development was impressive but not as
cosmopolitan as the Maya, Teotihuacán, and Zapotec societies. In cen-
tral Mexico, a people known as the Toltec established their capital at
Tula in the tenth century. They were originally one of the barbarous
hordes of Indians that periodically migrated from the north. At some
stage in their development, the Toltec were influenced by remnants of
Teotihuacán culture and adopted the feathered serpent Quetzalcoatl as
their god. They also revered a god known as Tezcatlipoca, or “smoking
mirror,” who later became a god of the Aztecs.
During this period, the Maya built beautiful cities near the Yucatán’s
Puuc hills. The regional architecture, called Puuc style, is characterized
by elaborate exterior stonework appearing above door frames and
extending to the roofline. Examples of this architecture, such as the
Codz Poop at Kabah and the palaces at Uxmal, Sayil, and Labná, are
Part I: Introducing Cancún & the Yucatán 
20

beautiful and quite impressive. Associated with the cities of the Puuc
region was Chichén Itzá, ruled by the Itzaés. This metropolis evidences
strong Toltec influences in its architectural style as well as the cult of
the plumed-serpent god, Kukulkán.
The precise nature of this Toltec influence is a subject of debate. But
there is an intriguing myth in central Mexico that tells how Quetzalcoatl
quarrels with Tezcatlipoca and through trickery is shamed by his rival
into leaving Tula, the capital of the Toltec empire. He leaves heading
eastward toward the morning star, vowing someday to return. In the lan-
guage of myth, this could be a shorthand telling of an actual civil war
between two factions in Tula, each led by the priesthood of a particular
god. Could the losing faction have migrated to the Yucatán and formed
the ruling class of Chichén Itzá? Perhaps. What we do know for certain 
is that this myth of the eventual return of Quetzalcoatl became, in the
hands of the Spanish, a powerful weapon of conquest.
The Conquest
In 1517, the first Spaniards arrived in Mexico and skirmished with Maya
Indians off the coast of the Yucatán Peninsula. One of the fledgling expe-
ditions ended in a shipwreck, leaving several Spaniards stranded as pris-
oners of the Maya. The Spanish sent out another expedition, under the
command of Hernán Cortez, which landed on Cozumel in February
1519. Cortez inquired about the gold and riches of the interior, and the
coastal Maya were happy to describe the wealth and splendor of the
Aztec empire in central Mexico. Cortez promptly disobeyed all orders
from his superior, the governor of Cuba, and sailed to the mainland.
He and his army arrived when the Aztec empire was at the height of its
wealth and power. Moctezuma II ruled over the central and southern high-
lands and extracted tribute from lowland peoples. His greatest temples
were literally plated with gold and encrusted with the blood of sacrificial
captives. Moctezuma was a fool, a mystic, and something of a coward.
Despite his wealth and military power, he dithered in his capital at
Tenochtitlán, sending messengers with gifts and suggestions that Cortez
leave. Meanwhile, Cortez negotiated his way into the highlands, always
cloaking his real intentions. Moctezuma, terrified, convinced himself that
Cortez was in fact the god Quetzalcoatl making his long-awaited return. 
By the time the Spaniards arrived in the Aztec capital, Cortez had gained
some ascendancy over the lesser Indian states that were resentful tribu-
taries to the Aztec. In November 1519, Cortez confronted Moctezuma and
took him hostage in an effort to leverage control of the empire.
In the middle of Cortez’s dangerous game of manipulation, another
Spanish expedition arrived with orders to end Cortez’s authority over
the mission. Cortez hastened to meet the rival’s force and persuade
them to join his own. In the meantime, the Aztec chased the garrison out
of Tenochtitlán, and either they or the Spaniards killed Moctezuma. For
the next year and a half, Cortez laid siege to Tenochtitlán, with the help
of rival Indians and a decimating epidemic of smallpox, to which the
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into the Yucatán 21

Indians had no resistance. In the end, the Aztec capital fell, and, when it
did, all of central Mexico lay at the feet of the conquistadors.
Having begun as a pirate expedition by Cortez and his men without the
authority of the Spanish crown or its governor in Cuba, the conquest of
Mexico resulted in a vast expansion of the Spanish empire. The king
legitimized Cortez following his victory over the Aztec and ordered the
forced conversion to Christianity of this new colony, to be called New
Spain. In the two centuries that followed, Franciscan and Augustinian
friars converted millions of Indians to Christianity, and the Spanish lords
built huge feudal estates on which the Indian farmers were little more
than serfs. The silver and gold that Cortez looted made Spain the richest
country in Europe.
The Colonial Period
Hernán Cortez set about building a new city upon the ruins of the old
Aztec capital. Over the three centuries of the colonial period, Spain
became rich from New World gold and silver, chiseled out by Indian
labor. A new class system developed. Those born in Spain considered
themselves superior to the criollos (Spaniards born in Mexico). Those of
other races and the castas (mixtures of Spanish and Indian, Spanish and
African, or Indian and African) occupied the bottom rungs of society. It
took great cunning to stay a step ahead of the avaricious Crown, which
demanded increasing taxes and contributions from its fabled foreign
conquests. Still, wealthy colonists prospered enough to develop an
extravagant society.
However, discontent with the mother country simmered for years. In
1808, Napoleon invaded Spain and crowned his brother Joseph king in
place of Charles IV. To many in Mexico, allegiance to France was out of
the question; discontent reached the level of revolt.
Independence
The rebellion began in 1810, when Father Miguel Hidalgo gave the grito, a
cry for independence, from his church in the town of Dolores, Guanajuato.
The uprising soon became a full-fledged revolution, as Hidalgo and Ignacio
Allende gathered an “army” of citizens and threatened Mexico City.
Although Hidalgo ultimately failed and was executed, he is honored as
“the Father of Mexican Independence.”
Political instability engulfed the young republic, which ran through a
dizzying succession of presidents and dictators as struggles between
federalists and centralists, and conservatives and liberals, divided the
country. Moreover, Mexico waged a disastrous war with the United
States, which resulted in the loss of half its territory.
Political instability persisted and included a brief period where the con-
trol of the country was assumed by Archduke Maximilian of Austria, who
accepted the position of Mexican emperor with the support of French
Part I: Introducing Cancún & the Yucatán 
22

troops, until he was captured and executed by a firing squad in 1867. His
adversary and successor (as president of Mexico) was Benito Juárez, a
Zapotec Indian lawyer and one of the great heroes of Mexican history.
Juárez did his best to unify and strengthen his country before dying of a
heart attack in 1872; his impact on Mexico’s future was profound, and
his plans and visions bore fruit for decades.
The Porfiriato and the Revolution
A few years after Juárez’s death, one of his generals, Porfirio Díaz,
assumed power in a coup. He ruled Mexico from 1877 to 1911, a period
now called the Porfiriato. He stayed in power through repressive meas-
ures and by courting the favor of powerful nations. With foreign invest-
ment came the concentration of great wealth in few hands, and social
conditions worsened.
In 1910, Francisco Madero called for an armed rebellion that became the
Mexican Revolution (La Revolución in Mexico; the revolution against
Spain is the Guerra de Independencia). Díaz was sent into exile. Madero
became president, but was promptly betrayed and executed. For the
next few years, the revolutionaries fought among themselves, until
Lázaro Cárdenas was elected in 1934, instituting reforms that solidified
the outcome of the Revolution. He implemented a massive redistribution
of land, nationalized the oil industry, and gave shape to the ruling politi-
cal party (now the Partido Revolucionario Institucional, or PRI) by
bringing a broad representation of Mexican society under its banner and
establishing mechanisms for consensus building. Most Mexicans practi-
cally canonize Cárdenas.
Modern Mexico
The presidents who followed were noted more for graft than for leader-
ship. The party’s base narrowed as many of the reform-minded elements
were marginalized. Economic progress, a lot of it in the form of large
development projects, became the PRI’s main basis for legitimacy.
Although the PRI maintained its grip on power, it lost all semblance of
being a progressive party.
In the years that followed, opposition political parties grew in power and
legitimacy. Facing pressure and scrutiny from national and international
organizations, and widespread public discontent, the PRI had to con-
cede defeat in state and congressional elections throughout the ’90s.
Elements of the PRI pushed for, and achieved, reforms from within and
greater political openness. This led to deep divisions between party
activists, rancorous campaigns for party leadership, and even political
assassination. The party began choosing its candidates through primar-
ies instead of by appointment.
But in the presidential elections of 2000, Vicente Fox of the opposition
party Partido Acción Nacional (PAN) won by a landslide. In hindsight,
there was no way that the PRI could have won in a fair election. For most
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into the Yucatán 23

Mexicans, a government under the PRI was all that they had ever known.
Many voted for Fox just to see whether the PRI would let go of power. It
did, and the transition ran smoothly, thanks in large part to the outgoing
president, Ernesto Zedillo, who was one of the PRI reformers.
Since then, Mexico has sailed into the uncharted waters of coalition poli-
tics, with three main parties, PRI, PAN, and Partido de la Revolución
Democrática (PRD). To their credit, the sailing has been much smoother
than many observers predicted.
Building Blocks: Local Architecture
Mexico’s artistic and architectural legacy reaches back more than 3,000
years. Until the conquest of Mexico in A.D. 1521, art, architecture, poli-
tics, and religion were intertwined. Although the European conquest
influenced the style and subject of Mexican art, this continuity remained
throughout the colonial period.
Pre-Hispanic forms
Mexico’s pyramids were truncated platforms crowned with a temple.
Many sites have circular buildings, such as El Caracol at Chichén Itzá,
usually called the observatory and dedicated to the god of the wind. El
Castillo at Chichén Itzá has 365 steps — one for every day of the year.
The Temple of the Magicians at Uxmal has beautifully rounded and slop-
ing sides. Evidence of building one pyramidal structure on top of another,
a widely accepted practice, has been found throughout Mesoamerica.
Architects of many Toltec, Aztec, and Teotihuacán edifices alternated
sloping panels (talud) with vertical panels (tablero). Elements of this
style occasionally show up in the Yucatán. Dzibanché, a newly exca-
vated site near Lago Bacalar, in southern Quintana Roo state, has at
least one temple with this characteristic. The true arch was unknown in
Mesoamerica, but the Maya made use of the corbeled arch — a method
of stacking stones that allows each successive stone to be cantilevered
out a little farther than the one below it, until the two sides meet at the
top, forming an inverted V.
Throughout Mexico, carved stone and mural art on pyramids served 
a religious and historical function rather than an ornamental one.
Hieroglyphs, picture symbols etched on stone or painted on walls or
pottery, functioned as the written language of the ancient peoples, par-
ticularly the Maya. By deciphering the glyphs, scholars allow the
ancients to speak again, providing us with specific names to attach to
rulers and their families, and demystifying the great dynastic histories of
the Maya. For more on this, read A Forest of Kings, by Linda Schele and
David Freidel (Morrow), and Blood of Kings, by Linda Schele and Mary
Ellen Miller (George Braziller).
Part I: Introducing Cancún & the Yucatán

Carving important historical figures on free-standing stone slabs, or
stelae, was a common Maya commemorative device. Several are in place
at Cobá; Calakmul has the most, and good examples are on display in the
Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City and the archaeology museum in
Villahermosa. Pottery played an important role, and different indigenous
groups are distinguished by their different uses of color and style. The
Maya painted pottery with scenes from daily and historical life.
Pre-Hispanic cultures left a number of painted murals, some of which
are remarkably preserved, such as those at Bonampak and Cacaxtla.
Amazing stone murals or mosaics, using thousands of pieces of fitted
stone to form figures of warriors, snakes, or geometric designs, decorate
the pyramid facades at Uxmal and Chichén Itzá.
Spanish influence
With the arrival of the Spaniards, new forms of architecture came to
Mexico. Many sites that were occupied by indigenous groups at the time
of the conquest were razed, and in their place appeared Catholic
churches, public buildings, and palaces for conquerors and the king’s
bureaucrats. In the Yucatán, churches at Izamal, Tecoh, Santa Elena, and
Muná rest atop former pyramidal structures. Indian artisans, who for-
merly worked on pyramidal structures, were recruited to build the new
buildings, often guided by drawings of European buildings. Frequently
left on their own, the indigenous artisans implanted traditional symbol-
ism in the new buildings: a plaster angel swaddled in feathers, reminis-
cent of the god Quetzalcoatl, and the face of an ancient god surrounded
by corn leaves. They used pre-Hispanic calendar counts — the 13 steps
to heaven or the nine levels of the underworld — to determine how
many florets to carve around the church doorway.
To convert the native populations, New World Spanish priests and archi-
tects altered their normal ways of teaching and building. Often before
the church was built, an open-air atrium was constructed to accommo-
date large numbers of parishioners for services. Posas (shelters) at the
four corners of churchyards were another architectural technique
unique to Mexico, again to accommodate crowds. Because of the lan-
guage barrier between the Spanish and the natives, church adornment
became more explicit. Biblical tales came to life in frescoes splashed
across church walls. Christian symbolism in stone supplanted that of
pre-Hispanic ideas as the natives tried to make sense of it all. Baroque
became even more ornate in Mexico and was dubbed churrigueresque
or ultrabaroque. Exuberant and complicated, it combines Gothic,
baroque, and plateresque elements.
Almost every village in the Yucatán Peninsula has the remains of mis-
sions, monasteries, convents, and parish churches. Many were built in
the 16th century following the early arrival of Franciscan friars. Examples
include the Mission of San Bernardino de Sisal in Valladolid; the fine altar-
piece at Teabo; the folk-art retablo (altarpiece) at Tecoh; the large church
and convent at Mani with its retablos and limestone crucifix; the facade,
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into the Yucatán 25

altar, and central retablo of the church at Oxkutzcab; the 16-bell belfry at
Ytholin; the baroque facade and altarpiece at Maxcanu; the cathedral at
Mérida; the vast atrium and church at Izamal; and the baroque retablo and
murals at Tabi.
Religion, Myth, and Folklore
Mexico is predominantly Roman Catholic, a religion introduced by the
Spaniards during the Conquest of Mexico. Despite its preponderance,
the Catholic faith in many places in Mexico has pre-Hispanic undercur-
rents. You need only visit the curandero section of a Mexican market
(where you can purchase copal, an incense agreeable to the gods; rustic
beeswax candles, a traditional offering; the native species of tobacco
used to ward off evil; and so on), or attend a village festivity featuring
Part I: Introducing Cancún & the Yucatán

Gods and goddesses
Each of the ancient cultures had its gods and goddesses, and while the names may not
have crossed cultures, their characteristics or purposes often did. Chaac, the hook-
nosed rain god of the Maya, was Tlaloc, the squat rain god of the Aztecs; Quetzalcoatl,
the plumed-serpent god of the Toltecs, became Kukulkán of the Maya. The tales of the
powers and creation of these deities make up Mexico’s rich mythology. Sorting out
the pre-Hispanic pantheon and beliefs in ancient Mexico can become an all-
consuming study (the Maya alone had 166 deities), so here’s a list of some of the most
important gods:
Chaac: Maya rain god
Ehécatl: Wind god whose temple is usually round; another aspect of Quetzalcoatl
Itzamná: Maya god above all, who invented corn, cacao (chocolate), and writing and
reading
Ixchel: Maya goddess of water, weaving, and childbirth
Kinich Ahau: Maya sun god
Kukulkán: Quetzalcoatl’s name in the Yucatán
Ometeotl: God/goddess, all-powerful creator of the universe, and ruler of heaven,
earth, and the underworld
Quetzalcoatl: A mortal who took on legendary characteristics as a god (or vice versa).
When he left Tula in shame after a night of succumbing to temptations, he prom-
ised to return. He reappeared in the Yucatán. He is also symbolized as Venus, the
moving star, and Ehécatl, the wind god. Quetzalcoatl is credited with teaching
them how to grow cacao, harvest it, roast it, and turn it into a drink with ceremo-
nial and magical properties.
Tlaloc: Aztec rain god

pre-Hispanic-influenced dancers, to understand that these beliefs often
run parallel with Christian ones.
Mexico’s complicated mythological heritage from pre-Hispanic religion is
full of images derived from nature — the wind, jaguars, eagles, snakes,
flowers, and more — all intertwined with elaborate mythological stories
to explain the universe, climate, seasons, and geography. Most groups
believed in an underworld (not a hell), usually containing 9 levels, and a
heaven of 13 levels — which is why the numbers 9 and 13 are so mytho-
logically significant. The solar calendar count of 365 days and the ceremo-
nial calendar of 260 days are significant as well. How one died determined
one’s resting place after death: in the underworld (Xibalba to the Maya),
in heaven, or at one of the four cardinal points. For example, men who
died in battle or women who died in childbirth went straight to the sun.
Everyone else first had to make a journey through the underworld.
Taste of the Yucatán: Local Cuisine
Authentic Mexican food differs dramatically from what is frequently
served in the United States under that name. For many, Mexico will be
new and exciting culinary territory. Even grizzled veterans will be pleas-
antly surprised by the wide variation in specialties and traditions
offered from region to region.
Despite regional differences, some generalizations can be made. Mexican
food usually isn’t pepper-hot when it arrives at the table (though many
dishes must have a certain amount of piquancy, and some home cooking
can be very spicy, depending on a family’s or chef’s tastes). Chiles and
sauces add piquant flavor after the food is served; you’ll never see a
table in Mexico without one or both of these condiments. Mexicans
don’t drown their cooking in cheese and sour cream, à la Tex-Mex, and
they use a great variety of ingredients. But the basis of Mexican food is
simple — tortillas, beans, chiles, and tomatoes — the same as it was
centuries ago, before the Europeans arrived.
In the Yucatán, as throughout Mexico, you’ll frequently encounter these
basic foods. Traditional tortillas are of the corn variety — they are actu-
ally made from a paste of ground corn, water, and lime, called masa.
This grainy dough is patted and pressed into flat round cakes, tortillas,
or take on a variety of other shapes that hold meat or other fillings.
A taco is anything folded or rolled into a tortilla, and sometimes a
double tortilla. The tortilla can be served either soft or fried. Flautas and
quesadillas are species of tacos. For Mexicans, the taco is the quintes-
sential fast food, and the taco stand (taquería) — a ubiquitous sight — is
a great place to get a filling meal.
Chiles are also a staple in the Yucatán and in Mexico. Many kinds of
chile peppers exist, and Mexicans call each of them by one name when
they’re fresh and another when they’re dried. Some are blazing hot with
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into the Yucatán 27

only a mild flavor; some are mild but have a rich, complex flavor. They
can be pickled, smoked, stuffed, stewed, chopped, and used in an end-
less variety of dishes.
Yucatecan cooking is the most distinct of the many kinds of regional
cooking, probably because the Maya and Caribbean cultural traditions
influenced it. Yucatecans are great fans of achiote (or annatto, a red
seed pod from a tree that grows in the Caribbean area), which is the
basic ingredient for perhaps its most famous dish, cochinita pibil (pork
wrapped in banana leaves and baked in a pit with a pibil sauce of
achiote, sour orange, and spices). Good seafood is readily available.
Many of the most common Mexican dishes are given a different name
and a different twist here. Waiters are happy to explain what’s what.
With a couple of meals under your belt, you’ll feel like a native.
The meal system in Mexico is a distinctive as the food itself. The morn-
ing meal, known as el desayuno, can be something light, such as coffee
and sweet bread, or something more substantial: eggs, beans, tortillas,
bread, fruit, and juice. It can be eaten early or late and is always a sure
bet in Mexico. The variety and sweetness of the fruits is remarkable, and
you can’t go wrong with Mexican egg dishes.
In Mexico, the main meal of the day, known as la comida (or almuerzo),
is eaten between 2 and 4 p.m. Stores and businesses close, and most
people go home to eat and perhaps take a short afternoon siesta (nap)
before going about their business. The first course is the sopa, which
can be either soup (caldo) or rice (sopa de arroz) or both; then comes
the main course, which ideally is a meat or fish dish prepared in some
kind of sauce and served with beans, followed by dessert.
Between 8 and 10 p.m., most Mexicans have a light meal called la cena.
If eaten at home, it is something like a sandwich, bread and jam, or 
perhaps a couple of tacos made from some of the day’s leftovers. At
restaurants, the most common thing to eat is antojitos (literally, “little
cravings”), a general label for light fare. Antojitos include tostadas,
tamales, tacos, and simple enchiladas, and are big hits with travelers.
Large restaurants offer complete meals as well. In the Yucatán, antojitos
include papadzules (a species of enchilada filled with hard-boiled egg),
sincronizadas (small tostadas), and panuchos (fried tortillas filled with
bean paste and topped with cochinita pibil and marinated onions).
There are also some unique attributes to beverages in Mexico. All over
the country, you’ll find shops selling jugos (juices) and licuados
(smoothies) made from several kinds of tropical fruit. They’re excellent
and refreshing; while traveling, we take full advantage of them. You’ll
also come across aguas frescas — water flavored with hibiscus, melon,
tamarind, or lime. Soft drinks come in more flavors than in any other
country we know. Pepsi and Coca-Cola taste the way they did in the
United States years ago, before the makers started adding corn syrup.
The coffee is generally good, and hot chocolate is a traditional drink, as
is atole — a hot, corn-based beverage that can be sweet or bitter.

Of course, Mexico has a proud and lucrative beer-brewing tradition, but
tequila is Mexico’s most popular spirit. Both tequila and another liquor
called Mezcal come from the agave plant, which is not a type of cactus,
but is actually a distant cousin of the lily. Tequila is a variety of mezcal
produced from the A. tequilana species of agave in and around the area
of Tequila, in the state of Jalisco. Mezcal comes from various parts of
Mexico and from different varieties of agave. The distilling process is
usually much less sophisticated than that of tequila, and, with its
stronger smell and taste, mezcal is much more easily detected on the
drinker’s breath. In some places, it comes with a worm in the bottle; you
are supposed to eat the worm after polishing off the mezcal. ¡Salud!
Word to the Wise: The Local Lingo
Most Mexicans are very patient with foreigners who try to speak their
language; it helps a lot to know a few basic phrases. Table 2-1 gives you

Chapter 3
Choosing Where to Go
In This Chapter
 Introducing the Yucatán’s beach resorts
 Deciding which area you’d like to visit
 Examining the pros and cons of each destination
T
he Yucatán may be the beach vacation of your dreams. All those
glossy images of long stretches of pure, white-sand beaches and
tranquil turquoise waters are not simply fantastical creations by ad
agencies — they’re found along the eastern coast of Mexico’s Yucatán
Peninsula. The Yucatán also possesses the added attraction of nearby
ruins of ancient cultures, nature-oriented diversions, and enough shop-
ping, dining, spa services, and nightlife to entertain the most demanding
of consumers.
Recent improvements have made the area even more attractive. In
October of 2005, Hurricane Wilma robbed Cancún’s Hotel Zone of much
of its powdery bliss. In an effort to rebuild the shore, a Belgian company
was able to retrieve sand 32km (20 miles) offshore and then actually
blow the sand back ashore. The result was an increase in the width of
the beach by 14m (45 ft.).
The Yucatán has a lot going for it in terms of attracting travelers — warm
weather, miles and miles of coastline, and a location so close to the
United States that sometimes it almost seems like a part of it. Although
the official language is Spanish, the use of English is almost as common
as Spanish in all the resort areas covered in this book. A visit to Mexico’s
Yucatán can offer the experience of visiting a foreign country accompa-
nied by many of the familiarities of home.
Introducing the Yucatán
The beaches of Cancún and the Yucatán are, in a word, spectacular —
and the main reason most people travel here. But the two areas also
have differences. Whereas Cancún is a full-blown resort, known as much
for its sizzling nightlife as its tropical tanning opportunities, the resorts
farther south along the coast are custom-made for pure relaxation and
lazy days of napping under a palm tree.

Or, explore a couple of laid-back islands, along with unique, ecologically
oriented enclaves. Deciding which one is right for you depends upon
what you’re looking for in a vacation. As you read this chapter, think
about what you really want in a destination. Romance? Family fun?
Lively singles scene? And consider how you want to travel. Budget?
Luxury? Somewhere in between? These considerations can help narrow
down your planning. One thing’s for certain — no matter what you’re
seeking, at least one Yucatán beach resort fits the bill perfectly.
If you don’t know where to begin in choosing between Cancún or a rustic
coastal retreat, don’t worry. In this book, we tell you everything you
need to know about each of the destinations that we cover in order to
help decide which one is right for you. In this chapter, we give you a run-
down of the highlights and drawbacks of each of the region’s most popu-
lar beach resorts. Because the type of accommodations you want may
determine where you go — or don’t go — we also explain the different
types of lodging available at each destination.
Picking the Right Beach Resort
The resorts along Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula are known for their crys-
talline waters, which border the coral reefs of the Caribbean, and flat,
scrubby landscapes. This area was the land of the ancient Maya, and the
remains of their impressive civilization are close enough to the popular
beach destinations to explore easily.
More than 27,000 hotel rooms to choose from and a full complement of
attractions make Cancún the most popular choice for travelers to Mexico
today — more than 7 million visitors come here each year. But Cancún’s
popularity has also given rise to a whole range of more relaxed options
farther down the coast to the south, appealing to those who love many
aspects of Cancún, but who want a heavier dose of the natural. Cozumel
Island, actually an older and more traditional vacation destination, offers
a laid-back retreat beneath palm fronds and sunny skies — with the
added allure of world-class diving. And, all along the Yucatán coast —
now known as the Riviera Maya — you can find everything from palapa-
topped huts to extravagant, luxury hotels or sprawling all-inclusive
resorts — all of which border stunning beaches and a tropical jungle. In a
nutshell, each resort has its own look, character, and special something.
The following sections are snapshots to help you focus on the resort
that’s right for you.
Also see the “Exploring the Riviera Maya” section later in this chapter for
a concise rating of each aspect of the resort areas covered in this book.
Choosing Cancún
Located on the Yucatán Peninsula, Cancún is Mexico’s most popular
beach resort — and the reason most people travel to Mexico. Simply
stated, it perfectly showcases both the country’s breathtaking natural

beauty and the depth of its 1,000-year history. Cancún is also especially
comforting for first-time visitors to Mexico, because it offers a familiarity
of life back home that makes foreigners feel instantly at ease in the
beach resort.
Cancún offers an unrivaled combination of high-quality accommoda-
tions, dreamy beaches, and diverse, nearby shopping, dining, and
nightlife. The added lure of ancient culture is also abundant in all direc-
tions. Even if you’re a bit apprehensive about visiting foreign soil, you’ll
feel completely at home and at ease in Cancún. English is spoken, dollars
are accepted, roads are well paved, and lawns are manicured. Malls are
the place for shopping and dining, and you’ll quickly spot recognizable
names for dining, shopping, nightclubbing, and sleeping.
Cancún is comprised of two principal areas: Isla Cancún (Cancún
Island), with a 23km-long (14-mile) strip of beachfront hotels reminis-
cent of Miami Beach, and Ciudad Cancún (Cancún City), on the main-
land, with smaller hotels, as well as the functional elements of any
community. Cancún’s proximity to the islands of Cozumel and Isla
Mujeres (meaning Island of Women) makes it a great departure point for
day trips or a vacation within a vacation. Since these locales are only a
short boat ride away, you can split your time between a mega-resort
experience in Cancún with a more low-key atmosphere, where you can
enjoy boutique hotels, world-class diving, and explore inland remains of
ancient cultures.
If you’re looking for an incredible introduction to Mexico’s beaches and
want to experience a Mexican-lite vacation while enjoying world-class
shopping in a pampered environment, Cancún is your beach. (Check out
the chapters in Part III for more detailed information on this area.)
Top aspects of a vacation in Cancún include:
 Great beaches of powdery, white sand and turquoise-blue water
 First-class facilities, modern accommodations, and tons of shop-
ping and dining options
 Numerous outdoor activities including jungle tours, visits to Maya
ruins, and eco-oriented theme parks
 No need to worry about communication — an English
language–friendly destination
But also consider the following:
 You can easily forget that you’re in Mexico and may miss the
Mexican experience altogether.
 Built for tourism, the prices in Cancún are higher than in most
other Mexican beach resorts.
 Cancún’s popularity means you’ll have lots of company here!
Part I: Introducing Cancún & the Yucatán 
42

Contemplating Isla Mujeres
Isla Mujeres is a perfect island escape, offering you an idyllic Mexican
beach experience complete with a wide stretch of palm-fringed beach,
abundant opportunities for diving, snorkeling, and fishing, a tiny but
lively town, intriguing guesthouses and small hotels, and an ample dose
of culture that’s muy Mexicana. Where Mexico’s only other true island —
Cozumel — has become a bustling cruise ship port of call, Isla Mujeres
remains a laid-back island, the kind where you can string a hammock
between two palms and simply doze away a week in perfect sea breezes
and sunshine.
Isla’s proximity to Cancún and its active international airport (just 5km/
3 miles off Cancún’s shore) makes the island easily accessible. When
you’re there, you’ll feel a million miles away from the bustle of civiliza-
tion. Restaurants are of the family-owned variety, and accommodations
are in small, independently owned hotels and guesthouses, with a few
deluxe options in the mix.
If you’re looking for a true laid-back vacation, and you prefer the simplis-
tic to the superlative, Isla Mujeres is your spot. (Check out Chapter 12
for more detailed information.)
Top aspects of a vacation in Isla Mujeres include:
 Excellent value for money, with numerous inexpensive hotel and
dining options
 A relaxed pace and simple lifestyle
 Abundant options to enjoy the surrounding Caribbean waters —
snorkeling, diving, deep-sea fishing, and explorations of nearby eco-
logical preserves and a small Maya ruin
But also consider the following:
 The island may be too small and relaxed for those who prefer con-
stant activity.
 During the day, the island crowds up with day-trippers from
Cancún.
 Nightlife is quiet and the dining scene simple — this isn’t the place
for those who prefer a little glitz.
Diving into Cozumel
If underwater beauty is your most important criteria for choosing a
beach, then Cozumel will dazzle you. Considered by many to be one of
the top-five diving spots in the world, few places can top the aquatic
splendor of the waters surrounding this island, about 72km (45 miles)
south of Cancún.
Chapter 3: Choosing Where to Go 43

And when you come up for air or if you’re a nondiver, Cozumel has sev-
eral inland attractions, a variety of watersports, a new golf course, and
ample choices for dining and libations. As Mexico’s most important port
of call for cruise ships, Cozumel also has the best duty-free shopping
and one of the largest selections of fine-jewelry shops in the country.
The island’s one town, San Miguel, has a charming old-Mexico feel to it.
Cozumel has more budget-friendly accommodations and places to dine
than newer, nearby Cancún. However, while the island is really active
during the day, it’s generally a quiet place at night.
Just a short ferry ride away from mainland Mexico, Cozumel makes for a
great jumping-off point for explorations along the Yucatán’s coastline.
Just across the channel from Cozumel is captivating Playa del Carmen,
which has grown quickly in recent years due to its central location and
funky-sophisticated charms.
In addition to being a diver’s dream destination, staying in Cozumel can
be like enjoying multiple beach resorts in one vacation! On the ocean
side of the island, you find a deserted coast that you can have practi-
cally all to yourself. While on the protected mainland side (where the
town and all the hotels are), you find perfectly calm waters — just right
for swimming or snorkeling without seagrass or any surf that can wreak
havoc with those string bathing suits. (Take a look at Chapter 13 for
more on Cozumel.)
Top aspects of a vacation in Cozumel include:
 World-class diving
 Secluded beaches on one side, calm water on the other
 Relaxed island atmosphere
 Proximity to the mainland’s cultural and historical attractions —
only a short ferry ride away
But also consider the following:
 The nightlife is low-key.
 Cozumel is super-casual; there’s not a formal place on the island.
 Stores tend to be more expensive than elsewhere because they
cater to cruise-ship visitors.
 When the cruise ships arrive, crowds descend on the town and
nature park.
Considering Playa del Carmen
The hottest spot along the Riviera Maya is Playa del Carmen, which lies
64km (40 miles) south of Cancún. Playa — as locals refer to it — is a
small town that’s both funky and sophisticated. In the early ’80s, it was
Part I: Introducing Cancún & the Yucatán 
44

nothing more than the ferry landing for Cozumel, but it has since devel-
oped into an engaging resort town, with powdery-sand beaches and an
eclectic mix of lodging, dining, and shopping.
Playa attracts visitors who are looking for a combination of simplicity
and variety. Recently, though, Playa has also attracted developers. As
they rapidly change the beachscape to the north and south with the
addition of mega-resorts, they’re also changing Playa’s previously play-
ful, laid-back vibe. But Playa still has enough of its original flavor to
make it different from any other resort in the area.
Top aspects of a vacation in Playa include:
 Great beaches
 Friendly crowds (emphasis on friendly)
 Good dining scene and an active street life
 Excellent location for day-trippers
But also consider the following:
 The boomtown feel that impinges on the zen of total relaxation
 Friendly crowds (emphasis on crowds)
 A rental car is necessary if you want to snorkel or dive
 Parking problems
Exploring the Riviera Maya
Cancún’s popularity has given rise to a growing curiosity and desire to
explore other parts of the Yucatán’s Caribbean coastline. The 130km 
(81-mile) stretch of coast called the Riviera Maya is now a mix of small
resort towns, nature parks, all-inclusive resorts, and roadside attrac-
tions extending all the way from Cancún south to the town and ruins of
Tulum. This area is ideal for either more adventurous travelers or those
who simply want to get to their all-inclusive hotel and stay there.
If you love getting away from it all, the Riviera Maya is a natural choice for
exploration and relaxation. (See the chapters in Part V for more details.)
Top aspects of a vacation in the Riviera Maya include:
 Beautiful beaches and an array of ecoparks ideal for nature lovers
 Favored by more adventurous travelers, some of whom have set-
tled here to offer eclectic accommodations, shopping, and dining
options
 Smaller crowds and lower prices
 All-inclusive heaven with great savings for travelers with children
Chapter 3: Choosing Where to Go 45

But also consider the following:
 Limited shopping and dining exist outside of Playa del Carmen.
 Unless you consider stargazing an aspect of nightlife, you won’t
find much to do here.
 Without a rental car, you’ll be stuck where you stay.
Visiting More Than One Resort
Although most people who travel to the Yucatán are headed for a beach
chair or hammock slung between palm trees — and then simply want to
stay put — it’s easy to combine several destinations in one trip. Start in
Cancún to revel away a few days before heading down the coast for
some serious relaxation. Or reverse that, rest up on a silken beach for a
few days, and then head back to Cancún’s Hotel Zone to shop and dine
away your last days. With most destinations in this book within a few
hours — or less — of one another, combining destinations is easy. A few
favorite combinations are Cancún and Isla Mujeres, or Playa del Carmen
and Cozumel. However, if the thought of packing and unpacking isn’t
your idea of a vacation, it’s easy to make day trips to other destinations
from wherever you decide to settle in — and, it’s a great way to plan next
year’s vacation!

Deciding When to Go
In This Chapter
 Figuring out the Yucatán’s weather patterns
 Understanding the secret of the seasons
 Planning your trip around festivals and special events
M
exico’s Yucatán beach resorts enjoy sun-drenched and moderate
winters, and they logically attract the most visitors when the
weather at home is cold and dreary. However, almost any time of the
year has its pros and cons for travel. In this chapter, we review what you
can expect from the weather during different months of the year. We also
highlight some of the Yucatán’s most festive celebrations that you may
want to plan your trip around.
Forecasting the Weather
Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula has two main climatic seasons: a rainy
season (May to mid-Oct), and a dry season (mid-Oct through Apr). The
rainy season can be of little consequence in the dry, interior part of this
region, but the coastal region typically receives regular tropical show-
ers, which begin around 4 or 5 p.m. and last a few hours, as well as an
occasional tropical storm that passes up the coast. Although the daily
rains can come on suddenly and be quite strong, they usually end just as
quickly as they began, and they cool the air for the evening. During peak
hurricane season (Sept–Oct), take a look at the weather reports just
before traveling to see whether you may run into any particularly foul
weather.
Hurricane season runs from June through October and particularly
affects the Yucatán Peninsula.
June, July, and August are very hot and humid on the Yucatán Peninsula,
with temperatures rising into the mid-80s (30°C) and 90s (33°C). Most of
the coastal part of this region experiences temperatures in the 80s in the
hottest months. During winter months, temperatures average 70 to 75
(22°–25°C) during the days, and about 55 to 65 (12°–18°C) in the evenings.

Unlocking the Secret of the Seasons
Mexico — and its Yucatán Peninsula — have two principal travel sea-
sons: high and low. The high season begins around December 20 and
continues through Easter, although in some places the high season can
begin as early as mid-November. The low season begins the day after
Easter and continues to mid-December; during the low season, prices
may drop between 20 and 50 percent. At beach destinations popular
with Mexican travelers, such as Cancún, the prices jump up to high-
season levels during July and August, the traditional, national summer
vacation period. Prices may rise dramatically during the weeks of Easter
and Christmas, which are the two peak travel weeks in Mexico. In Isla
Mujeres and Playa del Carmen, both on the Yucatán coast, the high
season starts in mid-November as well, but a “second” high season
occurs in August, when many European visitors arrive. We mention all
these exceptions and others in the relevant chapters later in this book.
We find November to be the best month to travel to Mexico: The scenery
is still green from the recently ended rainy season, and temperatures are
just beginning to turn a bit cooler, which can produce crystal-clear skies.
Crowds are also at a minimum, and you’re likely to find some good deals.
If you are not in college then one time you may want to avoid is spring
break (usually from Mar through early Apr) when the highest concentra-
tion of high-octane party crowds is found in Cancún. While the numbers
of these notorious binge-drinkers is on the steady decline, why travel 
to see college kids behaving badly? That is, unless you want to be part 
of the action. Other times you may want to avoid are the weeks of
Christmas and Easter. During these traditional Mexican holiday periods,
both crowds and prices are at their highest, although the crowds consist
more of families and couples than young and rowdy revelers.
Yucatán’s Calendar of Events
Mexicans are known for throwing a great party — fiesta! — and their
love of fireworks is legendary. You may choose to plan your visit around
a colorful national or religious celebration. Watersports enthusiasts may
consider visiting during one of the numerous regattas and sportfishing
festivals held at many of the resorts. Remember, however, that during
national holidays, Mexican banks and government offices — including
immigration — are closed.
Christmas and Easter are celebrated similarly to the way they’re cele-
brated in the United States, but Christmas is much more religiously ori-
ented, and less emphasis is placed on Santa and the exchange of gifts.
Part I: Introducing Cancún & the Yucatán 
48

January, February, and March
Día de Reyes (Three Kings Day) commemorates the three kings bring-
ing gifts to the Christ child. On this day, children receive gifts, much like
the traditional exchange of gifts that accompanies Christmas in the
United States. Friends and families gather to share the Rosca de Reyes, a
special cake. A small doll representing the Christ child is placed within
the cake; whoever receives the doll in his or her piece must host a party
the next month that features tamales (meat or sweet filling wrapped in a
corn husk) and atole (a thick, slightly sweet hot drink). January 6.
Music, dances, processions, food, and other festivities are features of
Día de la Candelaria (Candlemass) and lead up to a blessing of seed
and candles in a celebration that mixes pre-Hispanic and European tradi-
tions marking the end of winter. All those who attended the Three Kings
celebration reunite to share atole and tamales at a party hosted by the
recipient of the doll found in the rosca. February 2.
Día de la Constitución (Constitution Day) is a celebration in honor of
the current Mexican constitution that was signed in 1917 as a result of
the Mexican Revolution of 1910. If you’re in Mexico on this day, you’ll see
a parade wherever you are. February 5.
Carnaval (Carnival) is the last celebration before Lent, and it’s cele-
brated with special gusto in Cozumel. Here, the celebration resembles
New Orleans’s Mardi Gras with a festive atmosphere and parades. You’re
best off making reservations in advance and arriving a couple of days
before the beginning of celebrations. Three days preceding Ash
Wednesday and the beginning of Lent.
Benito Juárez was a reformist leader and president of Mexico who
became a national hero. The national holiday honoring Benito Juárez’s
Birthday is the same date of the spring equinox, an important celebra-
tion of the ancient Mexicans. In Chichén Itzá (chee-chin eat-zah), the
ancient Maya city located 179km (112 miles) from Cancún, the celebra-
tion of the first day of spring is particularly interesting. The Temple of
Kukulkán — Chichén Itzá’s main pyramid — aligns with the sun, and the
shadow of the body of its plumed serpent moves slowly from the top of
the building downward. When the shadow reaches the bottom, the body
joins the carved-stone snake’s head at the base of the pyramid. According
to ancient legend, at the moment that the serpent is whole, the earth is
fertilized to assure a bountiful growing season. Visitors come from around
the world to marvel at this sight, so advance arrangements are advisable.
In the custom of the ancient Mexicans, dances are performed, and prayers
to the elements and the four cardinal points (north, south, east, and west)
are said in order to renew their energy for the upcoming year. It’s custom-
ary to wear white with a red ribbon. March 21. (You can see the serpent’s
shadow at Chichén Itzá from Mar 19–23.)
Chapter 4: Deciding When to Go 49

April, May, and June
Semana Santa (Holy Week) celebrates the last week in the life of Christ
from Palm Sunday through Easter Sunday with somber religious proces-
sions, spoofs of Judas, and reenactments of specific biblical events, plus
food and craft fairs. Businesses close during this traditional week of
Mexican national vacations. If you plan on traveling to Mexico or around
the Yucatán during Holy Week, make your reservations early. Airline
seats on flights into and out of the country are reserved months in
advance. Buses to almost anywhere in Mexico are always full, so try
arriving on the Wednesday or Thursday prior to the start of Holy Week.
Easter Sunday is quiet. The following week is a traditional vacation
period. Week before Easter.
Labor Day is a national holiday celebrating workers. It features country-
wide parades and fiestas. May 1.
Cinco de Mayo is a national holiday that celebrates the defeat of the
French at the Battle of Puebla in 1862. May 5.
The month-long Fiestas de Mayo (May Festivities) is celebrated in
Chetumal, at the Mayan Kohunlich ruins. During the first week of this
cultural celebration, visitors can witness the ritual of the sacred copal 
of Kihunlich, the pyramid of masks. Other festivities include fireworks,
dances, and theater reenactments of centuries-old wars. For more infor-
mation, visit the state’s official events Web site, www.quintanaroo.
gob.mx.
July, August, and September
Mexico begins Día de Independencia (Independence Day) — the holi-
day that marks Mexico’s independence from Spain — at 11 p.m. on
September 15, with the president of Mexico’s famous independence grito
(shout) from the National Palace in Mexico City. The rest of the country
watches the event on TV or participates in local celebrations, which
mirror the festivities at the national level. September 16 is actually
Independence Day and is celebrated with parades, picnics, and family
reunions throughout the country. September 15 and 16.
During the fall equinox, Chichén Itzá once again takes center stage as
the same shadow play that occurs during the spring equinox repeats
itself for the fall equinox. September 21 and 22.
October, November, and December
What’s commonly called the Día de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) is
actually two days: All Saints’ Day, honoring saints and deceased chil-
dren, and All Souls’ Day, honoring deceased adults. Relatives gather at
cemeteries countrywide, carrying candles and food and often spending
the night beside the graves of loved ones. Weeks before, bakers begin
Part I: Introducing Cancún & the Yucatán 
50

producing bread formed in the shape of mummies and round loaves dec-
orated with bread “bones.” Decorated sugar skulls emblazoned with glit-
tery names are sold everywhere. Many days ahead, homes and churches
erect special altars laden with bread, fruit, flowers, candles, photo-
graphs of saints and of the deceased, and favorite foods. On these two
nights, children walk through the streets dressed in costumes and
masks, often carrying mock coffins and pumpkin lanterns, into which
they expect money to be dropped. November 1 and 2.
The Annual Mexico-Caribbean Food Festival (Festival Gastronomico
del Caribe Mexicano) in Cancún features a broad range of culinary cre-
ations from the finest restaurants in this popular resort and a number of
others from the Mayan Riviera and Isla Mujeres. Generally held the first
two weeks of November, visit http://festivalgastronomico.qroo.
gob.mx or www.cancun.info for details and schedules.
Día de Revolución (Revolution Day) is a national holiday commemorat-
ing the start of the Mexican Revolution in 1910 with parades, speeches,
rodeos, and patriotic events. November 20.
During the Día de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe (Feast of the Virgin of
Guadalupe), the patroness of Mexico is honored throughout the country
with religious processions, street fairs, dancing, fireworks, and Masses.
It’s one of Mexico’s most moving and beautiful displays of traditional
culture. In December 1531, the Virgin of Guadalupe appeared to a young
man, Juan Diego, on a hill near Mexico City. He convinced the bishop
that he had seen the apparition by revealing his cloak, upon which the
Virgin was emblazoned. December 12.
Christmas Posadas celebrates the Holy Family’s trek to Bethlehem. On
each of the nine nights before Christmas, door-to-door candlelit proces-
sions in cities and villages nationwide reenact the Holy Family’s search
for an inn. December 15 to December 24.

R
eady to travel to Mexico’s Yucatán? Well then, it’s prob-
ably time to do a little planning. In this part, we help
you with all the things you need to consider when booking
your ideal trip to one of Mexico’s Yucatán beach destinations.
Nothing will take away the pleasure of lazy days faster than
worries about spending too much money, so spend some
time reading through Chapter 5 to ward off stressful thoughts
and stay in the green. Chapters 6 and 7 help you get to the
area and book your accommodations; we also help you
decide whether to use a travel agent or take care of the
arrangements on your own and cover the pros and cons of
package deals. In Chapter 8, we offer some tips for travelers
with special needs — whether you’re a solo traveler or a
family — to help ensure that you pick exactly the right place
that fulﬁlls both your personal requirements and your expec-
tations. Finally, Chapter 9 covers all the ﬁnal details — from
getting your passport to packing your bags — you need to
enjoy a hassle-free vacation.

Managing Your Money
In This Chapter
 Figuring out the expenses of your trip
 Understanding Mexican currency
 Dealing with a stolen wallet
T
he brochures are in front of you, and visions of lazy, sunny days fill
your thoughts — so who wants to think about money? Trust me —
take a few minutes to figure out your expected expenses now, so you can
enjoy a worry-free vacation later.
Your budget is greatly affected by your choice of beach resort. An all-
inclusive resort on the Riviera Maya costs more than a modest beach-
side hotel in Cozumel. Within Cancún itself, a room on the beach of Isla
Cancún is considerably more expensive than one in Ciudad Cancún
(Cancún City), and ditto for all the other expenses down the line. After
you decide where you want to go, and you have your hotel and airfare
down, it’s a good idea to calculate the other estimated costs associated
with your trip to plan a proper budget.
Most people save all year to be able to enjoy a wonderful vacation, so in
this chapter, we share with you the finer points of stretching your dol-
lars into pesos. We tell you about the nuances of changing currency to
get more for your money and present the pros and cons of traveler’s
checks, credit cards, and cash. Finally, we tell you how to regroup after
your wallet is lost or stolen.
Planning Your Budget
To make certain that you don’t forget any expenses, try taking a mental
stroll through your entire trip. Start with the costs of transportation
from your home to the airport, your airline tickets, and transfers to your
hotel. Add your daily hotel rate (don’t forget taxes!), meals, activities,
entertainment, taxis, tips, your return to the airport, and finally, your
return trip home from the airport and any parking fees you may have
incurred. Just to be safe, add an extra 15 to 20 percent for extra, unex-
pected costs that may pop up.

Calculating your hotel cost
The biggest part of your vacation budget will go toward your hotel and
airfare, so we suggest keeping those expenses as low as possible. In the
various destination chapters in Parts III, IV, and V of this book, we use
dollar signs ($–$$$$$) to indicate the price category of each hotel.
(Check out Chapter 7 for a rundown on the price categories and their
corresponding dollar signs.) You can get a room for $40 a night, or you
can get a room for $700 a night!
Keep in mind that some room rates include breakfast — or may even
include all meals, beverages, and entertainment — so be sure to com-
pare mangoes with mangoes. Also, when finalizing your reservations,
check whether the total cost includes taxes and tips. Even within a
resort, the price of rooms can vary widely.
Room location — oceanfront versus a view of a Dumpster® — is one dif-
ferential. Ask yourself how much your room location matters. Do you
view your room as simply a place to sleep, shower, and dress? Or will
you not feel officially “on vacation” unless you can fall asleep to the
sound of the surf? If so, a pricier room may well be worth it. However,
remember that many “garden view” rooms in our recommendations are
only steps away from the beach and possibly even more tranquil than
their oceanfront counterparts.
Feeling romantic? Special packages for honeymooners are really popular
in Mexican beach resorts. Even if you’ve been hitched for awhile, it
could be a second honeymoon, right? If you ask, you may end up with a
complimentary bottle of champagne and flower petals on your bed.
Mexico couldn’t be more accommodating to travelers with children.
Many of the larger chains don’t charge extra for children staying in 
the same room as their parents, and some offer special meal programs
and other amenities for younger travelers. Although rollaway beds are
common, you may have a challenge finding a crib. Ask about this contin-
gency when making your reservation.
Totaling transportation costs
After taking care of your airfare (for tips on keeping airfare costs down
see Chapter 6), your transportation costs vary depending upon your
choice of Yucatán beach resorts. Although some areas — like Cancún —
offer economical shuttles and great public transportation options,
others along the Riviera Maya are more expensive to get to and have
little in the way of local transportation once you’ve arrived at your
resort, making a rental car desirable if you’re the type of traveler who
likes to explore. These extra charges, however, can make getting around
cost even more than getting there.
One advantage of a package tour (when you make one payment that
covers airfare, hotel, round-trip transportation to and from your accom-
modations, and occasionally meals or tours) is that the round-trip
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Cancún and the Yucatán 
56

ground transportation between the airport and your hotel is usually
included. If you’re not sure whether your package covers ground trans-
portation, ask. Note that the taxi union inside Mexico is strong, so you’re
unlikely to find any shuttle transportation provided by your hotel.
Generally, renting a car doesn’t make sense, unless you’re planning to
explore the Yucatán on your own (and possibly Cozumel, if you’re look-
ing to explore the far side of the island there). Renting a small car runs
about $70 a day on average, including insurance, so you may want to
squeeze your car-dependent explorations into a day or two at the most.
Also try to time your rental-car excursions to coincide with your arrival
or departure so that you can use your wheels for either leg of your 
airport-hotel transportation needs.
As a rule, taxis tend to be the most economical and efficient transporta-
tion for getting around Cancún, Cozumel, and Isla. In each of the chap-
ters detailing these resorts in Parts III, IV, and V, we provide taxi rates for
getting around town.
Estimating dining dollars
In each resort’s dining section, we describe our favorite restaurants, all of
which include dollar signs ($–$$$$$) to give you an idea of the prices you
can expect to pay. Refer to the Introduction of this book for a detailed
explanation of these price categories.
The prices quoted refer to main courses at dinner, unless otherwise
specified. We eliminated the most expensive shrimp and lobster dishes
from our estimates to avoid pre-trip sticker shock. In most cases, you
can find additional entrees above and below the quoted price range. To
estimate your total dining expenses, add in estimated costs for bever-
ages, appetizers, desserts, and tips as well.
Hotels increasingly are offering dining plans. To help you wade through
the terminology, here’s a review of the basics:
 Continental plan (CP): Includes a light breakfast — usually juices,
fruits, pastries or breads, and coffee.
 Breakfast plan (BP): Includes a full, traditional American-style
breakfast of eggs, bacon, French toast, hash browns, and so on.
 Modified American plan (MAP): Includes breakfast (usually a full
one) and dinner.
 Full American plan (FAP): Includes three meals a day.
 All-inclusive: Includes three all-you-can-eat meals a day, plus snacks,
soft drinks, alcoholic beverages, and entertainment, including spe-
cial theme parties. Sometimes, additional charges apply for premium
liquors or wines.
 European plan (EP): No meals are included.
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 57

Mexican beach-resort hotels are known for their expansive breakfast
buffets. But the buffets can also be expensive, averaging about $20, even
for small children. If breakfast is your main meal or only meal of the day,
these all-you-can-eat extravaganzas may be worthwhile; otherwise,
you’re probably better off sleeping in or finding breakfast elsewhere.
Be sure to explore restaurants away from your hotel. You’re likely to get
a much better dining value, and you can truly savor the diverse flavors
of Mexico. For eateries that best represent the flavorful (and we don’t
mean spicy) cuisine of Mexico, look for the Viva Mexico icon that accom-
panies some of the restaurant reviews throughout this book.
While you’re in Mexico, be sure to try the local beers. Corona is the best-
known brew, but other excellent choices are Bohemia, Modelo Especial,
Pacifico, Indio, and Dos Equis Negro. Beer in Mexico is often cheaper
than soft drinks! Your vacation is looking better and better, isn’t it?
Getting tipping tips
Many travelers skimp on tips in Mexico, but please don’t. Most of the
employees in this country’s hospitality industry receive the majority of
their income from tips. For bellmen or porters, the equivalent of $1 per
bag is appropriate. For hotel housekeeping, tip between $1 and $2 per
night, depending upon the type of hotel you’re staying in. For restaurant
service, 15 percent is standard, but consider 20 percent if the service is
particularly noteworthy. Oddly enough, the one area you don’t need to
consider tips for is taxis — it’s not customary to tip taxi drivers here
unless they help with baggage, or you’ve hired them on an hourly basis,
and they double as tour guides.
You’ll no doubt run into all sorts of enterprising young boys looking for
a tip to point you in the direction of your restaurant, help you into a
parking spot, or do some other sort of unnecessary favor. In cases like
these, tip as you see fit or as the spirit moves you.
Sightseeing
You’re going to a beach resort, so regardless of your budget, you always
have the option of simply soaking up the tropical sun during the day and
then taking in the moonlit nights. It’s the most economical plan and a
relaxing and enjoyable option for many. Still, with so much to do and
see, you’re likely to want to spend some time and money getting out and
enjoying the many treasures of Mexico.
Pricing for sightseeing tours varies by the destination, the length of time
of the excursion, whether a meal and beverages are included, and other
extras. However, here are some pretty typical ranges that you can use as
a guideline: A city tour generally runs from $12 to $20; half-day boat
cruises that include lunch can cost between $40 and $60; and full-day
excursions to neighboring ruins run between $60 and $150.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Cancún and the Yucatán 
58

If you plan to take part in any sports-related activities like golf, diving,
or sportfishing, you may find the prices to be higher than back home.
Dives range from around $50 to $70 for a two-tank dive, but here, you
tend to really get what you pay for in terms of quality of equipment and
dive guides, so it’s best to pay up. Cozumel has the greatest selection of
expert dive shops, and the competition makes Cozumel’s prices the
most reasonable for the quality of experience. Going fishing? You have to
decide on variables beyond your point of departure, including size of
boat, charter options, and type of gear and refreshments, but count on
between $50 and $75 per person for a half-day charter.
Shopping
If shopping is your calling, you can plan to spend or save here. Besides
silver jewelry and other souvenirs, the best excuse for shopping in
Mexico is the great price of duty-free perfumes, watches, and other
goods in Cancún and along the Riviera Maya. We discuss shopping spe-
cialties in greater detail within the respective destination chapters.
Catching the nightlife
As for nightlife, the cost depends more on your personal tastes. The hot
nightlife is concentrated in Cancún, so if that’s important to you, this is
the spot in the Yucatán, although Playa del Carmen has some notable
options as well. In Cancún, $20 cover charges are common during busier
times. When you’re out on the town, beer is the best bargain and costs
about $1 to $3 per beer. National-branded drinks can run you around $3
to $5 each. Ladies can easily find bargains like two-for-one or all-you-can-
drink specials.
Making Sense of the Peso
The currency in Mexico is the Mexican peso, and in recent years, econo-
mists have been talking about its amazing recovery and resiliency
against the U.S. dollar. At press time, each peso was worth close to 11
U.S. cents, which means that an item costing 11 pesos would be equiva-
lent to US$1. Like most things in Mexico, the paper currency is colorful,
and it comes in denominations of 20 (blue), 50 (pink), 100 (red), 200
(green), and 500 (burgundy) pesos. Coins come in denominations of 1, 2,
5, 10, and 20 pesos and 50 centavos (100 centavos equals 1 peso).
New 50- and 500-peso bills look very similar, but 50-peso bills have a
slightly pinkish hue and are smaller in size. However, always double-
check how much you’re paying and your change to avoid unpleasant
surprises. The same applies to 10- and 20-peso coins. Although they look
very similar, 20-peso coins are slightly larger than the 10-peso coins.
Getting change continues to be a problem in Mexico. Small-denomination
bills and coins are hard to come by, so start collecting them early in your
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 59

trip and continue as you travel. Shopkeepers — and especially taxi 
drivers — always seem to be out of change and small bills; that’s doubly
true in a market. In other words, don’t try to pay with a 500-peso bill
when buying a 20-peso trinket.
Before you leave your hotel, it’s a good idea to get a hundred pesos —
about US$9 — in change so that you’re sure to have change for cab and
bus fares.
All prices in this book are quoted in U.S. dollars. When you’re in Mexico,
you’ll notice the common use of the currency symbol ($), generally indi-
cating the price in pesos. Go ahead and ask if you’re not sure because
some higher-end places do tend to price their goods in U.S. dollars. Often,
if a price is quoted in U.S. dollars, the letters “USD” follow the price.
The rate of exchange fluctuates a tiny bit daily, so you’re probably better
off not exchanging too much currency at once. Don’t forget, however, to
have enough pesos to carry you over a weekend or Mexican holiday,
when banks are closed. In general, avoid carrying the US$100 bill, the bill
most commonly counterfeited in Mexico, and therefore, the most diffi-
cult to exchange, especially in smaller towns. Because small bills and
coins in pesos are hard to come by in Mexico, the US$1 bill is very useful
for tipping. A tip of U.S. coins is of no value to the service provider
because they can’t be exchanged into Mexican currency.
To make your dollars go further, remember that ATMs offer the best
exchange rate; however, you need to consider any service fees. Mexican
banks offer the next-best fare, and they don’t charge commission, unless
you’re cashing traveler’s checks, in which case they usually charge a
small commission. After banks, casas de cambio (houses of exchange)
are your next best option, and they usually charge a commission. You
can almost always get a lower exchange rate than when you exchange
your money at a hotel front desk.
Choosing Traveler’s Checks, 
Credit Cards, or Cash
You need to think about what kind of money you’re going to spend on
your vacation before you leave home.
ATMs and cash
These days, all the Mexico beach resorts detailed in this book have 24-
hour ATMs linked to a national network that almost always includes
your bank at home. Cirrus and Plus are the two most popular networks;
check the back of your ATM card to see which network your bank
belongs to. The 800-numbers and Web sites will give you specific loca-
tions of ATMs where you can withdraw money while on vacation. Using
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Cancún and the Yucatán 
60

ATMs permits you to withdraw only as much cash as you need for a few
days, which eliminates the insecurity (and the pickpocketing threat) of
carrying around a wad of cash. Note, however, that a daily withdrawal
maximum of about US$1,000 is common, though this amount does
depend on your particular bank and type of account.
One important reminder: Many banks now charge a fee ranging from 50
cents to US$3 when a nonaccount-holder uses their ATMs. Your own
bank may also assess a fee for using an ATM that’s not one of its branch
locations. These fees mean that, in some cases, you get charged twice
just for using your bank card when you’re on vacation. Although an ATM
card can be an amazing convenience when traveling in another country
(put your card in the machine and out comes foreign currency at an
extremely advantageous exchange rate), banks are also likely to slap you
with a “foreign currency transaction fee” just for making them do the
pesos-to-dollars-to-pesos conversion math.
As in many places worldwide, ATMs in Mexico are often targets for crimi-
nals looking to capture your bank-card information for fraudulent card-
copying purposes. To be on the safe side, only use bank-sponsored
ATMs, and even then, check the ATM carefully for any small cameras or
other recording devices that can be used to copy your card. Shield the
touchpad when entering your PIN, for further protection against fraud.
Credit cards
Credit cards are invaluable when traveling. They’re a safe way to carry
“money,” and they provide a convenient record of all your travel expenses
when you arrive home.
Travel with at least two different credit cards if you can. Depending on
where you go, you may find MasterCard accepted more frequently than
Visa (or vice versa), American Express honored or refused, and so on.
You can get cash advances from your credit card at any bank, and you
don’t even need to go to a teller — you can get a cash advance at the
ATM if you know your PIN. If you’ve forgotten your PIN or didn’t even
know you had one, call the phone number on the back of your credit card
and ask the bank to send it to you. It usually takes five to seven business
days, though some banks will do it over the phone if you tell them your
mother’s maiden name or some other piece of personal information.
Remember the hidden expense to contend with when borrowing cash
from a credit card: Interest rates for cash advances are often signifi-
cantly higher than rates for credit card purchases. More importantly,
you start paying interest on the advance the moment you receive the
cash. On an airline-affiliated credit card, a cash advance does not earn
frequent-flier miles.
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 61

Traveler’s checks
Traveler’s checks are something of an anachronism from the days when
people wrote personal checks instead of going to an ATM. Because you
can replace traveler’s checks if lost or stolen, they were a sound alterna-
tive to filling your wallet with cash at the beginning of a trip.
Still, if you prefer the security of traveler’s checks, you can get them at
almost any bank. American Express offers checks in denominations of
$20, $50, $100, $500, and $1,000. You pay a service charge ranging from 
1 to 4 percent, though AAA members can obtain checks without a fee at
most AAA offices. You can also get American Express traveler’s checks
over the phone by calling % 800-221-7282.
Visa (% 800-227-6811) also offers traveler’s checks, available at
Citibank locations across the country and at several other banks. The
service charge ranges between 1.5 and 2 percent; checks come in
denominations of $50, $100, $500, and $1,000. MasterCard also offers
traveler’s checks; call % 800-223-9920 for a location near you.
Although traveler’s checks are very safe, consider that:
 You usually get charged a commission to cash your traveler’s
checks, and when you add that to the exchange-rate loss, you end
up getting fewer pesos for your money.
 Many smaller shops don’t take traveler’s checks, so if you plan to
shop, cash the traveler’s checks before you embark on your shop-
ping expedition.
Taxing Matters
There’s a 15 percent value-added tax (IVA) on goods and services in
most of Mexico, and it’s supposed to be included in the posted price.
This tax is 10 percent in Cancún and Cozumel. Unlike other countries
(Canada and Spain, for example), Mexico doesn’t refund this tax when
visitors leave the country, so you don’t need to hang on to those
receipts for tax purposes.
All published prices you encounter in your travels around Mexico’s
beaches are likely to include all applicable taxes, except for hotel rates,
which are usually published without the 15 percent IVA and the 2 per-
cent lodging tax.
An exit tax of approximately $18 U.S. dollars is imposed on every for-
eigner leaving Mexico. This tax is usually — but not always — included
in the price of airline tickets. Be sure to reserve at least this amount in
cash for your departure day if you’re not certain that it’s included in
your ticket price.

Dealing with a Lost or Stolen Wallet
Odds are that if your wallet is gone, you’ve seen the last of it, and the
police aren’t likely to recover it for you. However, after you realize it’s
gone and you cancel your credit cards, you need to inform the police.
You may need the police-report number for credit card or insurance pur-
poses later. After you’ve covered all the formalities and before you head
to the nearest bar to drown your sorrows, retrace your steps — you may
be surprised at how many honest people are in Mexico, and you may
discover someone trying to find you to return your wallet.
Almost every credit card company has an emergency toll-free number
you can call if your wallet or purse is stolen — make a list of these num-
bers and put them in a safe place. They may be able to wire you a cash
advance off your credit card immediately; in many places, they can get
you an emergency credit card within a day or two.
If your credit card is stolen, major credit card companies have emer-
gency 800 numbers. Here’s a list of numbers to call in the United States
as well as internationally:
 American Express cardholders and traveler’s check holders call 
% 800-327-2177 (U.S. toll-free); % 336-393-1111 (international
direct-dial) for gold and green cards.
 The toll-free U.S. emergency number for Visa is % 800-336-8472;
from other countries, call % 410-902-8012. Your card issuer can
also provide you with the toll-free, lost/stolen-card number for the
country or countries you plan to visit.
 MasterCard holders need to dial % 800-826-2181 in the United
States or 800-307-7309 from anywhere in the world. Also check with
your card issuer for the toll-free, lost/stolen-card number for the
country or countries you want to visit.
For other credit cards, call the toll-free number directory at 
% 800-555-1212.
To dial a U.S. toll-free number from inside Mexico, you must dial 001-880
and then the last seven digits of the toll-free number.
If you opt to carry traveler’s checks, be sure to keep a record of their
serial numbers so that you can handle this type of emergency. If you
need emergency cash over the weekend when all banks and American
Express offices are closed, you can have money wired to you via
Western Union (% 800-325-6000; www.westernunion.com).
Identity theft and fraud are potential complications of losing your wallet,
especially if you’ve lost your driver’s license and passport along with
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 63

your cash and credit cards. Notify the major credit-reporting bureaus
immediately; placing a fraud alert on your records may protect you
against liability for criminal activity. The three major U.S. credit-
reporting agencies are Equifax (% 800-766-0008; www.equifax.com),
Experian (% 888-397-3742; www.experian.com), and TransUnion
(% 800-680-7289; www.transunion.com). Finally, if you’ve lost all forms
of photo ID, call your airline and explain the situation; it may allow you
to board the plane if you have a photocopy of your passport or birth
certificate and a copy of the police report you’ve filed.

Getting to the Yucatán
In This Chapter
 Taking a look at airlines and airfares
 Understanding package tours
T
he obvious first step in enjoying your Mexican beach vacation is get-
ting there. It’s easy to do, but the options available can make a big
difference in the price you’ll pay. To help minimize both the cost and the
time it will take to arrive, in this chapter, we point you in the direction of
available planning tools — including the Internet — and explain the ben-
efits and limitations of traveling on a package tour. We offer tips on get-
ting the best airfares and choosing the best airline to whisk you away to
your dreamy beach along the Yucatán Peninsula.
Flying to Cancún and the Yucatán
The first step for the independent travel planner is finding the airlines
that fly to Cancún or Cozumel, the two major airport gateways for the
Yucatán’s beach resorts. In addition to regularly scheduled service,
direct charter services from U.S. cities to Cancún and Cozumel are
making it possible to fly direct from the largest airports in the United
States. However, if you find that no direct flights are available, you can
always reach your destination through a connection in Mexico City.
If you’re booked on a flight through Mexico City, make sure your luggage
is checked through to your final destination so that you don’t have to
lug your bags through the Mexico City airport — and it saves a lot of
time during the connection process. This arrangement is possible if
you’re flying with affiliated or code-share airlines — separate airlines
that work closely together to help travelers reach final destinations via
connecting flights. The domestic airlines in Mexico offering direct flights
to Cancún within Mexico include:
 Aeromexico (% 800-237-6639; www.aeromexico.com); flights from
Mexico City to Cancún and Cozumel
 Aviacsa (% 800-758-2188; www.www.aviacsa.com); flights to
Cancún from Mexico City and Monterrey

 Mexicana (% 800-531-7921; www.mexicana.com); flights to
Cancún from Mexico City
For information about saving money on airfares using the Internet, see
the “Researching and Booking Your Trip Online” section later in this
chapter.
At the time this books is being published, the main airlines operating
direct or nonstop flights to Cancún and the Yucatán Peninsula include:
 Aeromexico (% 800-237-6639; www.aeromexico.com); flights to
Cancún and Cozumel
 Air Canada (% 888-247-2262; www.aircanada.com); flights to
Cancún and Cozumel from Calgary, Montreal, and Toronto
 Alaska Airlines (% 800-252-7522; www.alaskaair.com); flights to
Cancún and Cozumel from Los Angeles and Seattle-Tacoma
 American Airlines (% 800-433-7300; www.aa.com); flights to
Cancún and Cozumel
 ATA (% 800-225-2995; www.ata.com); flights to Cancún
 British Airways (% 800-247-9297, 0345-222-111, or 0845-77-333-77

Getting the Best Deal on Your Airfare
Competition among the major U.S. airlines is unlike that of any other
industry. A coach seat is virtually the same from one carrier to another,
yet the difference in price may run as high as $1,000.
Business travelers, who need flexibility to purchase their tickets at the
last minute, change their itinerary at a moment’s notice, or want to get
home before the weekend, pay the premium rate, known as the full fare.
Passengers who can book their ticket long in advance, who don’t mind
staying over Saturday night, or who are willing to travel on a Tuesday,
Wednesday, or Thursday, pay the least.
Consolidators, also known as bucket shops, are great sources for inter-
national tickets, although they usually can’t beat the Internet on fares
within North America. Start by looking in Sunday newspaper travel sec-
tions; if you’re a U.S. traveler, focus on the New York Times, Los Angeles
Times, and Miami Herald. For less-developed destinations, small travel
agents who cater to immigrant communities in large cities often have the
best deals.
Bucket shop tickets are usually nonrefundable or rigged with stiff cancel-
lation penalties, often as high as 50 to 75 percent of the ticket price, and
some put you on charter airlines with questionable safety records.
Several reliable consolidators are worldwide and available on the Net.
STA Travel (% 800-781-4040; www.statravel.com), the world’s leader
in student travel, offers good fares for travelers of all ages. Flights.com
(% 800-TRAV-800; www.flights.com) has excellent fares worldwide
and local Web sites in 12 countries. FlyCheap (% 800-FLY-CHEAP; www.
1800flycheap.com) is owned by package-holiday megalith MyTravel
and so has especially good access to fares for sunny destinations. Air
Tickets Direct (% 800-778-3447; www.airticketsdirect.com) is
based in Montreal and leverages the currently weak Canadian dollar for
low fares; it’ll also book trips to places that U.S. travel agents won’t
touch, such as Cuba.
Here are some travel tips — tested and true — for getting the lowest
possible fare:
 Timing is everything. If you can, avoid peak travel times. In
Mexico, the weeks surrounding the Christmas/New Year holidays
and Easter are so jampacked that we find it unenjoyable to be at a
beach resort anyway. Airfares are relatively expensive anytime
between January and May, with September through mid-November
offering the best deals. Specials pop up throughout the year, how-
ever, based on current demand, and last-minute specials on pack-
age tours are an increasingly popular way to travel.
 Book in advance for great deals. Forgetting what we said in the
previous sentence, you can also save big by booking early — with
Chapter 6: Getting to the Yucatán 67

excellent fares available for 30-, 60-, or even 90-day advance book-
ings. Note that if you need to change your schedule, a penalty
charge of $75 to $150 is common.
 Choose an off-peak travel day. Traveling on a Tuesday, Wednesday,
or even Thursday can also save you money. Even if you can’t travel
both ways on these lower-fare days, you can still save by flying off-
peak at least one-way.
 Book travel during the midnight hour. In the middle of the week,
just after midnight, many airlines download canceled low-priced
airfares into their computers, so shortly after midnight is a great
time to buy newly discounted seats. Midnight is the cutoff time for
holding reservations. You may benefit by snagging cheap tickets
that were just released by those who reserved — but never 
purchased — their tickets.
Researching and Booking Your Trip Online
The “big three” online travel agencies, Expedia (www.expedia.com),
Travelocity (www.travelocity.com), and Orbitz (www.orbitz.com),
sell most of the air tickets bought on the Internet. (If you’re a Canadian
traveler, try www.expedia.ca and www.travelocity.ca; U.K. residents
can go for expedia.co.uk and opodo.co.uk.) Each has different busi-
ness deals with the airlines and may offer different fares on the same
flights, so shopping around is wise. Expedia and Travelocity will also
send you an e-mail notification when a cheap fare becomes available 
to your favorite destination. Of the smaller travel agency Web sites,
SideStep (www.sidestep.com) receives good reviews from users. It’s a
browser add-on that purports to “search 140 sites at once,” but in reality
beats competitors’ fares only as often as other sites do.
Other travel search engine sites will compare airfares found across-
the-board, whether on an airline Web site or on a consolidator Web 
site. A couple of our favorites to search for airfares and hotels are www.
mobissimo.com and www.kayak.com. Understand that not all airlines
and travel companies are searched, but this is an excellent way to get an
idea of the industry average for the dates that you are looking to travel.
Another favorite source of mine is www.travelzoo.com, an Internet
media company. Over 500 advertisers from airlines and hotels to travel
agencies submit outstanding travel deals to be highlighted on the Web
site as well as sent out in e-mail newsflashes and newsletters. You don’t
have to sign up or get e-mails to search the site for incredible last-
minute deals and vacation packages.
A great Web site, www.GoNomad.com, is a collection of travel stories from
destinations around the world, including Mexico. The down-to-earth and
fun-to-read travel blogs give authentic insights by experienced travelers.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Cancún and the Yucatán 
68

In addition, www.epinions.com and www.TripAdvisor.com give con-
sumers an outlet to review and share personal travel experiences — the
good, the bad, and the ugly — to help you plan your next vacation.
Great last-minute deals are available through free weekly e-mail services
provided directly by the airlines. Most of these deals are announced on
Tuesday or Wednesday and must be purchased online. Most are only
valid for travel that weekend, but some (such as Southwest’s) can be
booked weeks or months in advance. Sign up for weekly e-mail alerts at
airline Web sites or check mega-sites that compile comprehensive lists
of last-minute specials, such as Smarter Travel (www.smartertravel.
com). For last-minute trips, www.site59.com in the United States and
www.lastminute.com in Europe often have better deals than the major-
label sites.
If you’re willing to give up some control over your flight details, use an
opaque fare service like Priceline (www.priceline.com) or Hotwire
(www.hotwire.com). Both offer rock-bottom prices in exchange for
travel on a “mystery airline” at a mysterious time of day, often with a
mysterious change of planes en route. The mystery airlines are all major,
well-known carriers — and the possibility of being sent from Philadelphia
to Chicago via Tampa is remote. But your chances of getting a 6 a.m. or
11 p.m. flight are pretty high. Hotwire tells you flight prices before you
buy; Priceline usually has better deals than Hotwire, but you have to play
its “name our price” game.
Understanding Escorted and Package Tours
First, bear in mind that there’s a big difference between an escorted tour
and a package tour. With an escorted tour, the tour company takes care
of all the details and tells you what to expect at each attraction. You
know your costs upfront, and an escorted tour can take you to the maxi-
mum number of sights in the minimum amount of time with the least
amount of hassle. However, escorted tours are rare in Cancún and else-
where in the Yucatán; most travelers, once they arrive at their destina-
tion, simply book tours and excursions with local travel agents.
Package tours generally consist of round-trip airfare, ground transporta-
tion to and from your hotel, and your hotel room price, including taxes.
Some packages also include all food and beverages and most entertain-
ment and sports, when booked at an all-inclusive resort. You may find
that a package tour can save you big bucks and is an ideal vacation
option.
For popular destinations like Cancún, package tours are the smart way
to go. In many cases, a package that includes airfare, hotel, and trans-
portation to and from the airport costs less than just the hotel alone if
you booked it yourself.
Chapter 6: Getting to the Yucatán 69

Some package tours offer a better class of hotels than others, and some
offer the same hotels for lower prices. Some offer flights on scheduled
airlines; others book charter planes (which are known for having minus-
cule amounts of legroom). In some packages, your choice of accommo-
dations and travel days may be limited. Some tours let you choose
between escorted vacations and independent vacations; others allow
you to add on just a few excursions or escorted day trips (also at dis-
counted prices) without booking an entirely escorted tour.
To find package tours, check out the travel section of your local Sunday
newspaper or the ads in the back of national travel magazines such as
Travel + Leisure, National Geographic Traveler, and Condé Nast Traveler.
Liberty Travel (call % 888-271-1584 to find the store nearest you;
www.libertytravel.com) is one of the biggest packagers in the
Northeast and usually boasts a full-page ad in Sunday papers.
Another good source of package deals is the airlines themselves. Most
major airlines offer air/land packages, including Aeromexico Vacations
(% 800-245-8585; www.aeromexico.com), American Airlines Vacations
(% 800-321-2121; www.aavacations.com), Continental Airlines Vaca-
tions (% 800-301-3800; www.covacations.com), Delta Vacations (% 800-
221-6666; www.deltavacations.com), Mexicana Vacations (% 800-531-
9321; www.mexicana.com), and United Vacations (% 888-854-3899; www.
unitedvacations.com). Several big online travel agencies — Expedia,
Travelocity, Orbitz, Site59, Kayak, and Lastminute.com — also do a brisk
business in packages. If you’re unsure about the pedigree of a smaller
packager, check with the Better Business Bureau in the city where the
company is based, or go online at www.bbb.org. If a packager won’t tell
you where it’s based, don’t fly with it.
You can even shop for these packages online — try these sites for a
start:
 One specialist in Mexico vacation packages is www.mexicotravel
net.com, an agency that offers most of the well-known travel pack-
ages to Mexico beach resorts, plus offers last-minute specials.
 Check out www.2travel.com and find a page with links to a
number of the big-name Mexico packagers, including several of 
the ones listed in this chapter.
 For last-minute, air-only packages or package bargains, check out
Vacation Hotline at www.vacationhotline.net. After you find
your deal, you need to call the number to make final booking
arrangements, but it offers packages from both the popular Apple
and Funjet vacation wholesalers.
Several companies specialize in packages to Mexico’s beaches; they usu-
ally fly in their own, chartered airplanes, so they can offer greatly dis-
counted rates. Here are some of the packagers we prefer:

 Apple Vacations (% 800-365-2775; www.applevacations.com)
offers inclusive packages to all the beach resorts and has the
largest selection of hotels in Cancún, Cozumel, and the Riviera
Maya. Apple perks include special baggage handling (company rep-
resentatives take your bags from the airport directly to the hotel
room, saving you the hassle) and the services of an Apple represen-
tative at the major hotels. Apple vacations must be booked through
a travel agent, but both its Web site and toll-free number easily con-
nect you with one close to you.
 Classic Custom Vacations (% 800-635-1333; www.classiccustom
vacations.com) specializes in package vacations to Mexico’s finest
luxury resorts. It combines discounted first-class and economy 
airfare with stays at the most exclusive hotels in Cancún and the
Riviera Maya, as well as other destinations in Mexico. In many cases,
packages also include meals, airport transfers, and upgrades. The
prices are not for bargain hunters but for those who seek luxury.
 Funjet Vacations (bookable through any travel agent, with general
information available on its Web site at www.funjet.com) is one 
of the largest vacation packagers in the United States. Funjet has
packages to Cancún, Cozumel, and the Riviera Maya.
 GOGO Worldwide Vacations (% 888-636-3942; www.gogowwv.com)
has trips to all the major beach destinations, including Cancún,
offering several exclusive deals from higher-end hotels. These trips
are bookable through any travel agent.
 Pleasant Mexico Holidays (% 800-448-3333; www.pleasant
holidays.com) is another of the largest vacation packagers in 
the United States with hotels in Cancún and Cozumel.
The biggest hotel chains and resorts also offer packages. If you already
know where you want to stay, call the hotel or resort and ask whether it
offers land/air packages.

Booking Your
Accommodations
In This Chapter
 Choosing a room that’s right for you
 Surfing for hotel rooms
 Getting the best room at the best rate
W
hether you’ve chosen a package deal or you’re planning your trip
on your own, getting a room is a crucial part of your vacation
planning. In this chapter, we help you decipher the various rates and
provide some tips on how to get the best one, including searching the
Internet for your ideal place to stay. We also compare the pros and cons
of different types of places to stay.
Getting to Know Your Options
From small inns to large all-inclusives, the beach resorts along Mexico’s
Yucatán Peninsula offer every type of vacation accommodations. And
the prices can vary even more! Recommendations for specific places to
stay are in the chapters devoted to the individual beach towns. We try
to provide the widest range of options — both in types of hotels as well
as budgets — but we always keep comfort in mind. What you find in this
book is what we believe to be the best value for your money. Here are
the major types of accommodations:
 Resorts: These accommodations tend to be the most popular
option — especially with package tours — because they offer the
most modern amenities, including cable TV, hair dryers, in-room
safes, and generally, a selection of places to dine or have a drink.
Large by definition, they may also boast various types of sporting
facilities, spa services, shopping arcades, and tour-desk services.
These places also tend to be the most expensive type of accommo-
dations, but can be heavily discounted if your timing is right.
 Hotels: These quarters tend to be smaller than resorts, with fewer
facilities. In terms of style, look for anything from hacienda-style

villas to all-suite hotels or sleek, modern structures. Most hotels at
Mexican beach resorts have at least a small swimming pool, and if
they’re not located directly on a beach, hotels frequently offer shut-
tle service to a beach club or an affiliate beachfront hotel.
 All-inclusives: In Mexico, all-inclusives are gaining rapidly in popu-
larity, and they seem to be getting larger and larger in size. As the
name implies, all-inclusives tie everything together in one price —
your room, meals, libations, entertainment, sports activities, and
sometimes, off-site excursions. The advantage that many travelers
find with this option is an expected fixed price for their vacation —
helpful if you need to stay within a strict budget. Many all-inclusives
have their own nightclubs or, at least, offer evening shows and
entertainment, such as theme nights, talent contests, or costume
parties. As for the food, you may never go hungry, but you’re
unlikely to go gourmet either. Food quality can be an important
variable, about which it helps to have talked to someone who’s
recently been to the particular all-inclusive, or check online mes-
sage boards for up-to-date commentaries on the buffets.
 Condos, apartments, and villas: One of these accommodations 
can be a good option, especially if you’re considering a stay longer
than a week, and the reach of the Internet has made these lodging
options extremely viable. Many condos, apartments, and villas
come with housekeepers or even cooks. It’s hard to know exactly
what you’re getting — and often it’s futile to complain after you
arrive — so again, word of mouth can be helpful here. At the very
least, ask for references or search on the Internet to see whether
anyone can offer an experience. In addition to the Internet, select
options are always advertised in the major metropolitan newspa-
pers, such as the Los Angeles Times, the Chicago Tribune, and the
New York Times. Our recommendation? Save this option for your
second visit when you have a better idea about the various parts of
town and the area in general.
In Mexico, where smoking is still the norm, expect that your room will 
be smoker-friendly. However having said that, an increasing number of
hotels — especially the larger resorts — now offer nonsmoking rooms.
And, many of the holistic-oriented retreats along the Riviera Maya are
smoke-free. Be sure to ask when booking a room to ensure you get your
preference.
Mexico’s system of rating hotels and resorts is more generous on its
handing out of “stars.” Here, the top-of-the-line resorts are known as
“Grand Turismo,” and from there, it ranges from five stars down. So,
booking a four-star resort will generally result in much more modest
accommodations than the equivalent ranking in the United States.
Table 7-1 shows how you how we’ve categorized hotel prices in each of
the remaining chapters. Our rankings consider prices for a room based
on double occupancy for one night during high season.

These accommodations are simple and simply
inexpensive. Rooms will likely be small, and tele-
visions are not necessarily provided. Parking is
not provided but rather catch-as-you-can on the
street. These may include basic rooms with ham-
mocks for sleeping in.
$$
$101–$150
A bit classier, these midrange accommodations
offer more room, more extras (such as irons, hair
dryers, or a microwave), and a more convenient
location than the preceding category.
$$$
$151–$200
Rooms in this category are generally beachfront,
and come with plenty of extras to make your stay
comfortable — such as restaurants, a large pool,
and tour services, but may not be as modern as
other choices. Or, in some of the more remote
parts of the Yucatán, this category may be the
top-of-the-line.
$$$$
$201–$300
Higher-class still, these accommodations are
plush, and with ocean views and direct beach
access. Think chocolates on your pillow, a classy
restaurant, underground parking garages, and
often on-site spas. Many all-inclusives fall into
this category, so your meals and drinks will also
be part of the price you pay for the room.
$$$$$
$301 and up
These top-rated accommodations come with
luxury amenities such as valet parking, on-
premise spas, and in-room hot tubs, plasma-
screen TVs, and CD players — but you pay
through the nose for ’em.
Finding the Best Room at the Best Rate
Finding the best hotel room your money can buy isn’t rocket science.
With our advice in this section, you may very well find a terrific deal on
your room.
Finding the best rate
When it comes to rates, the most common term is rack rate. The rack
rate is the maximum rate that a resort or hotel charges for a room. It’s
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Cancún and the Yucatán 
74

the rate you get if you walk in off the street and ask for a room on a night
that the place is close to being full.
The rack rate is the first rate a hotel offers, but you usually don’t have to
pay it. Always ask whether a lower rate or special package is available —
it can’t hurt, and you may at least end up with a free breakfast or spa
service.
In this book, we use rack rates as a guidepost, not expecting that you’ll
have to pay them. Minimum night stays, special promotions, and sea-
sonal discounts can all go a long way in bringing the rack rate down.
Also, be sure to mention your frequent-flier or corporate-rewards pro-
grams if you book with one of the larger hotel chains. Please note that
rates change very often, so the prices quoted in this book may be differ-
ent from the prices you’re quoted when you make your reservation.
Our experience is that you’ll get the best rate by booking your hotel as
part of an air-hotel package (see Chapter 6), but in lieu of that, try con-
tacting the local number for your best chance of negotiating the best
rate. Just note — it may help if you speak Spanish.
Surfing the Web for hotel deals
Expedia offers a long list of special deals and virtual tours or photos of
available rooms so you can see what you’re paying for (a feature that
helps counter the claims that the best rooms are often held back from bar-
gain booking Web sites). Travelocity posts unvarnished customer reviews
and ranks its properties according to the AAA rating system. Also reliable
are www.kayak.com, www.hotels.com, and www.quikbook.com. An excel-
lent free program, TravelAxe (www.travelaxe.net), can help you search
multiple hotel sites at once, even ones you may never have heard of —
and conveniently lists the total price of the room, including the taxes and
service charges. Another booking site, www.travelweb.com, is partly
owned by the hotels it represents (including the Hilton, Hyatt, and
Starwood chains) and is therefore plugged directly into the hotels’ reser-
vations systems — unlike independent online agencies, which have to fax
or e-mail reservation requests to the hotel, a good portion of which get
misplaced in the shuffle. More than once, travelers have arrived at the
hotel, only to be told that they have no reservation. To be fair, many of the
major sites are undergoing improvements in service and ease of use, and
Expedia will soon be able to plug directly into the reservations systems of
many hotel chains — none of which can be bad news for consumers. In
the meantime, it’s a good idea to get a confirmation number and make a
printout of any online booking transaction.
In the opaque Web site category, Priceline and Hotwire are even better
for hotels than for airfares; with both, you’re allowed to choose the
neighborhood and quality level of your hotel before offering up your
money. Priceline’s hotel product even covers Europe and Asia, although
it’s much better at getting five-star lodging for three-star prices than at
finding anything at the bottom of the scale. On the downside, many
Chapter 7: Booking Your Accommodations 75

hotels stick Priceline guests in their least desirable rooms. Be sure to go
to BiddingForTravel.com (before bidding on a hotel room on Priceline);
it features a fairly up-to-date list of hotels that Priceline uses in major
cities. For both Priceline and Hotwire, you pay upfront, and the fee is non-
refundable. Note: Some hotels do not provide loyalty program credits or
points or other frequent-stay amenities when you book a room through
opaque online services.
 Although the name All Hotels on the Web (www.all-hotels.com)
is something of a misnomer, the site does have tens of thousands 
of listings throughout the world. Bear in mind that each hotel has
paid a small fee ($25 and up) to be listed, so it’s less of an objective
list and more like a book of online brochures.
 hoteldiscount.com (www.hoteldiscount.com) lists bargain room
rates at hotels in more than 50 U.S. and international cities. The 
cool thing is that hoteldiscount.com prebooks blocks of rooms in
advance, so sometimes it has rooms — at discount rates — at hotels
that are “sold out.” Select a city and input your dates, and you get a
list of the best prices for a selection of hotels. This site is notable for
delivering deep discounts in cities where hotel rooms are expensive.
The toll-free number is printed all over the site (% 800-96-HOTEL);
call it if you want more options than are listed online.

 Bringing the kids along
 Traveling tips for those with special needs
 Getting hitched in Mexico
M
ost individuals consider themselves unique and as having special
needs, but some types of travelers really do warrant a little extra
advice. In this chapter, we cover information that’s helpful to know if
you’re traveling with children. If you’re a senior traveler or you’re travel-
ing solo, we have plenty of tips for you, too. Individuals with disabilities
can also mine this chapter for useful info. Gay and lesbian travelers can
find a section devoted to them as well. And for those of you planning a
wedding, we include a section on tying the knot in Mexico. Throughout
the chapter, we clue you in on what to expect, offer useful tips, and
whenever possible, steer you to experts concerning your particular 
circumstances.
Traveling with the Brood: Advice for Families
Children are considered the national treasure of Mexico, and Mexicans
warmly welcome and cater to your children. Although many parents were
reluctant to bring young children to Mexico in the past, primarily due to
health concerns, we can’t think of a better place to introduce children to
the exciting adventure of exploring a different culture. One of the best
destinations for children in Mexico is Cancún. Hotels can often arrange
for a baby sitter. Some hotels in the moderate-to-luxury range have small
playgrounds and pools for children and hire caretakers who offer special-
activity programs during the day, but few budget hotels offer these
amenities. All-inclusive resorts make great options for family travel.
Before leaving for your trip, check with your pediatrician or family
doctor to get advice on medications to take along. Mexican-brand dis-
posable diapers cost about the same as diapers in the United States, but

the quality is poorer. You can purchase U.S.-brand diapers, but you’ll pay
a higher price. Familiar, brand-name baby foods are sold in many stores.
Dry cereals, powdered formulas, baby bottles, and purified water are all
easily available in midsize and large cities or resorts.
Cribs, however, may present a problem; only the largest and most luxuri-
ous hotels provide them. However, rollaway beds to accommodate chil-
dren staying in a room with their parents are often available. Child seats
or highchairs at restaurants are common, and most restaurants go out of
their way to accommodate your children. You may want to seriously
consider bringing your own car seat along because they’re not readily
available to rent in Mexico.
We recommend you take coloring books, puzzles, and small games with
you to keep your children entertained during the flight or whenever
you’re traveling from one destination to the next. Another good idea is
to take a blank notebook, in which you and your children can paste sou-
venirs from your trip — perhaps the label from the beer daddy drank on
the beach, or small shells and flowers that they collect. And don’t forget
to carry small scissors and a glue stick with you, or the blank notebook
may remain blank.
You can find good family-oriented vacation advice on the Internet from
sites like the Family Travel Forum (www.familytravelforum.com), a
comprehensive site that offers customized trip planning; Family Travel
Network (www.familytravelnetwork.com), an award-winning site that
offers travel features, deals, and tips; Traveling Internationally with
Your Kids (www.travelwithyourkids.com), a comprehensive site 
that offers customized trip planning; and Family Travel Files (www.the
familytravelfiles.com), which offers an online magazine and a direc-
tory of off-the-beaten-path tours and tour operators for families.
Throughout this book, you’ll notice the Kid Friendly icon, which will
alert you to those hotels, restaurants, and activities that are especially
suitable for family travelers. Children under 18 traveling without parents
or with only one parent must travel with a notarized letter from the
absent parent or parents authorizing the travel. We go over this in detail
in Chapter 9, in the discussion on entry requirements into Mexico. Don’t
arrive at the airport without it, or your trip to those powdery white
beaches of the Yucatán will be delayed!
Making Age Work for You: Tips for Seniors
People over the age of 60 are traveling more than ever before. And why
not? Being a senior entitles you to some terrific travel bargains. Mention
the fact that you’re a senior when you make your travel reservations.
Although all of the major U.S. airlines except America West have can-
celed their senior discount and coupon book programs, many hotels still

78

offer discounts for seniors. In most cities, people over the age of 60 qual-
ify for reduced admission to theaters, museums, and other attractions,
as well as discounted fares on public transportation.
Members of AARP (formerly known as the American Association of
Retired Persons), 601 E St. NW, Washington, DC 20049 (% 888-687-2277
or 202-434-2277; www.aarp.org), get discounts on hotels, airfares, and

Mexico is a popular country for retirees and for senior travelers. For
decades, North Americans have been living indefinitely in Mexico by
returning to the border and re-crossing with a new tourist permit every
six months. Mexican immigration officials have caught on, and they now
limit the maximum time you can spend in the country to six months in
any given year. This measure is meant to encourage even partial resi-
dents to comply with the proper documentation procedures.
Adventures in Mexico (AIM) (P.O. Box 434, New Boston, NH 03070;

We need to say that Mexico does fall far behind other countries when 
it comes to accessible travel. In fact, the area may seem like one giant
obstacle course to travelers in wheelchairs or on crutches. At airports,
you may encounter steep stairs before finding a well-hidden elevator or
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Cancún and the Yucatán 
80

escalator — if one exists at all. Airlines often arrange wheelchair assis-
tance for passengers to the baggage area. Porters are generally available
to help with luggage at airports and large bus stations after you clear
baggage claim.
In addition, escalators (and you won’t find many in the beach resorts) are
often nonoperational. Stairs without handrails abound. Few restrooms
are equipped for travelers with disabilities, and when one is available,
access to it may be via a narrow passage that won’t accommodate a
wheelchair or a person on crutches. Many deluxe hotels (the most expen-
sive) now have rooms with bathrooms for people with disabilities. Budget
travelers may be best off looking for single-story motels, although access-
ing showers and bathrooms may still pose a problem outside of specially
equipped deluxe hotels. Generally speaking, no matter where you are,
someone will lend a hand, although you may have to ask for it.
Although Cancún’s international airport has become increasingly mod-
ernized in recent years, in other parts of Mexico few airports offer the
luxury of boarding an airplane from the waiting room. You either descend
stairs to a bus that ferries you to a waiting plane that you board by climb-
ing stairs, or you walk across the airport tarmac to your plane and climb
up the stairs. Deplaning presents the same problems in reverse.
In our opinion, the wide, modern streets and sidewalks of Cancún make
it the most “accessible” resort. In addition to the superior public facili-
ties, you can find numerous accommodations options for travelers with
disabilities.
Following the Rainbow: Resources 
for Gay and Lesbian Travelers
Mexico is a conservative country with deeply rooted Catholic religious
traditions. Public displays of same-sex affection are rare, and two men
displaying such behavior is still considered shocking, especially outside
the major resort areas. Women in Mexico frequently walk hand in hand,
but anything more would cross the boundary of acceptability. How-
ever, gay and lesbian travelers are generally treated with respect and
shouldn’t experience any harassment, assuming that the appropriate
regard is given to local culture and customs. Cancún is the most gay-
friendly place in the Yucatán, with Playa Delfines being a popular meet-
ing spot, and some concentrated areas in Ciudad Cancún have several
gay nightclubs and bars.
Many agencies offer tours and travel itineraries specifically for gay and
lesbian travelers. Above and Beyond Tours (% 800-397-2681; www.
abovebeyondtours.com) is the exclusive gay and lesbian tour operator
for United Airlines. Now, Voyager (% 800-255-6951; www.nowvoyager.
com) is a well-known San Francisco–based gay-owned and -operated

travel service. Olivia Cruises & Resorts (% 800-631-6277 or 510-655-

lishes the Cancún Pink Pages guide, which is free with the booking of any
package tour or can be ordered for $5 online on its Web site.
Planning a Wedding in Mexico
Mexico’s beaches may be old favorites for romantic honeymoons, but
have you ever considered taking the plunge in Mexico? A destination
wedding saves money and can be less of a hassle compared with marry-
ing back home. Many hotels and attractions offer wedding packages,
which can include everything from booking the officiant to hiring the
videographer. Choose the package you want and, presto, your wedding
planning is done! Several properties also provide the services of a wed-
ding coordinator (either for free or at a reasonable cost) who not only
scouts out sweetheart pink roses but can also handle marriage licenses
and other formalities. A destination wedding can be as informal or as
traditional as you like. After returning from their honeymoon, many cou-
ples hold a reception for people who couldn’t join them. At these par-
ties, couples sometimes continue the theme of their wedding locale
(decorate with piñatas or hire a mariachi band, for example) and show a
video of their ceremony so that everyone can share in their happiness.
If you invite guests to your destination wedding, find out about group
rates for hotels and airfare, which can save 20 percent or more off regu-
lar prices. Plan as far ahead as possible so that people can arrange their
schedules to join you.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Cancún and the Yucatán 
82

Under a treaty between the United States and Mexico, Mexican civil mar-
riages are automatically valid in the United States. You’ll need your pass-
ports; certified proof of divorce or the death certificate of any former
spouses (if applicable); tourist cards (provided when you enter Mexico);
and results of blood tests performed in Mexico at least 15 days before
the ceremony.
Check with a local, on-site wedding planner through your hotel to verify
all the necessary requirements and obtain an application well in advance
of your desired wedding date. Contact the Mexican Tourism Board 
(% 800-446-3942; www.visitmexico.com) for information.

Taking Care of the
Remaining Details
In This Chapter
 Getting your entry and departure documents in order
 Considering travel and medical insurance
 Ensuring a safe vacation
 Deciding whether to rent a car
A
re you ready? Really ready? Before you can string that hammock
between the palms, you need to take care of a few final details to get
to your personal paradise. In this chapter, we cover the essentials and
the requirements of getting into Mexico — and then back home again. We
also review the ins and outs of dealing with travel insurance, ensuring a
safe trip, deciding whether you should rent a car, and making sure that
you pack everything you need for your Yucatán beach vacation.
Arriving in and Departing from Mexico
As of January 23, 2007, your driver’s license or birth certificate was
deemed insufficient proof of citizenship to travel to and from Mexico.
You now need a passport to go to Mexico. Department of Homeland
Security (DHS) upped these boarder requirements as part of the Western
Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI). This initiative was developed to
strengthen border security and facilitate entry into the United States for
U.S. citizens and legitimate foreign visitors by requiring them to provide
more reliable documentation. U.S. citizens must present a valid U.S.
passport when traveling via air between the United States, Canada, and
Mexico and must also use a U.S. passport when traveling via sea and
land borders (including ferry crossings).
An identification option under development at press time was The
Passport Card (also referred to as the PASS Card). This limited-use pass-
port in card format is strictly for travel via land or sea (including ferries)
between the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.

Also at press time, DHS anticipated that the following documents would
continue to be acceptable for their current travel uses under WHTI:
SENTRI, NEXUS, FAST, and the U.S. Coast Guard Merchant Mariner
Document.
While in Mexico, you must also obtain a Mexican tourist permit (FMT),
which is issued free of charge by Mexican border officials after proof of
citizenship is accepted. These forms are generally provided by the air-
line aboard your flight into Mexico. Be sure to put it somewhere safe
during your stay because you will need to present it when you leave 
and may be forced to stay in Mexico until you’re able to replace it.
Keep your passport close to the vest, as you will not be permitted to
leave the country without a full-validity passport. (Emergency passports
are only granted in very special circumstances.) This is a bureaucratic
hassle that can take as long as two weeks. In the event that a passport 
is stolen, get a police report from local authorities indicating that your
documents were stolen; having one may expedite the process. Go to the
nearest U.S. passport office, consulate, or the Passport and Citizenship
Unit of the U.S. Embassy with proof of identity such as a driver’s license,
re-apply, and pay all applicable fees.
Children will also be required to present a passport. Note that children
under the age of 18 traveling without parents or with only one parent
must have a notarized letter from the absent parent or parents authoriz-
ing the travel. The letter must include the duration of the visit, destina-
tion, names of accompanying adults, parents’ home addresses, telephone
numbers, and so on. You must also attach a picture of the child to this
letter.
Getting a Passport
To apply for a first-time passport, follow these steps:
1. Complete a passport application in person at a U.S. passport
office; a federal, state, or probate court; or a major post office.
To find your regional passport office, either check the U.S. State
Department Web site, http://travel.state.gov, or call the
National Passport Information Center (% 877-487-2778) for auto-
mated information.
2. Present a certified birth certificate as proof of citizenship.
Bringing along your driver’s license, state or military ID, or Social
Security card is also a good idea.
3. Submit two identical passport-sized photos, measuring 2 × 2
inches in size. You often find businesses that take these photos
near a passport office.
Chapter 9: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 85

Note: You can’t use a strip from a photo-vending machine because
the pictures aren’t identical.
4. Pay a fee. For people 16 and over, a passport is valid for ten
years and costs $97. For those 15 and under, a passport is valid
for five years and costs $82.
Allow plenty of time before your trip to apply for a passport; processing
normally takes three weeks but can take longer during busy periods
(especially spring).
If you have a passport in your current name that was issued within the
past 15 years (and you were over age 16 when it was issued), you can
renew the passport by mail for $67, plus a $30 execution fee ($60 for an
expedited order). The U.S. State Department’s Bureau of Consular Affairs
maintains an excellent Web site (http://travel.state.gov) that pro-
vides everything you need to know about passports (including down-
loadable applications and locations of passport offices). For general
information, call the National Passport Agency (% 202-647-0518). To
find your regional passport office, either check the U.S. State Department
Web site or call the National Passport Information Center toll-free
number (% 877-487-2778) for automated information.
Applying for other passports
The following list offers more information for citizens of Australia,
Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.
 If you’re Australian, visit a local post office or passport office, call
the Australia Passport Information Service (% 131-232 toll-free

Clearing Customs
You can take it with you — up to a point. Technically, no limits exist on
how much loot U.S. citizens can bring back into the United States from a
trip abroad, but the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) does put
limits on how much you can bring in for free. (This rule is mainly for tax-
ation purposes, to separate tourists with souvenirs from importers.)
U.S. citizens may bring home $400 worth of goods duty-free, providing
you’ve been out of the country at least 48 hours and haven’t used the
exemption in the past 30 days. This amount includes one liter of an alco-
holic beverage (you must, of course, be older than 21), 200 cigarettes, and
100 cigars. Anything you mail home from abroad is exempt from the $400
limit. You may mail up to $200 worth of goods to yourself (marked “for
personal use”) and up to $100 to others (marked “unsolicited gift”) once
each day, so long as the package does not include alcohol or tobacco
products. You’ll have to pay an import duty on anything over these limits.
Note that buying items at a duty-free shop before flying home does not
exempt them from counting toward U.S. Customs limits (monetary or
otherwise). The “duty” that you’re avoiding in those shops is the local
tax on the item (like state sales tax in the United States), not any import
duty that may be assessed by the U.S. Customs office.
If you have further questions or for a list of specific items you cannot
bring into the United States check out the U.S. Customs and Border
Protection Web site at www.cbp.gov.
Playing It Safe with Travel 
and Medical Insurance
Many of the hotels in Cancún and the Yucatán recently added hurricane
policies to help you reschedule your vacation if it’s interrupted by a hur-
ricane without any additional cost to you. However, you may want to
consider further coverage in the event that other “untimely” situations
arise. Three kinds of travel insurance are available: trip-cancellation
insurance, medical insurance, and lost-luggage insurance. The cost of
travel insurance varies widely, depending on the cost and length of your
trip, your age and health, and the type of trip you’re taking, but expect
to pay between 5 and 8 percent of the vacation itself. Here is our advice
on all three:
 Trip-cancellation insurance helps you get your money back if you
have to back out of a trip, if you have to go home early, or if your
travel supplier goes bankrupt. Allowed reasons for cancellation can
range from sickness to natural disasters to the State Department
declaring your destination unsafe for travel. (Insurers usually won’t
cover vague fears, though, as many travelers discovered who tried
to cancel their trips in Oct 2001 because they were wary of flying.)
Chapter 9: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 87

A good resource is “Travel Guard Alerts,” a list of companies 
considered high-risk by Travel Guard International (www.travel
insured.com). Protect yourself further by paying for the insurance
with a credit card — by law, consumers can get their money back
on goods and services not received if they report the loss within 
60 days after the charge is listed on their credit card statement.
Note: Many tour operators, particularly those offering trips to
remote or high-risk areas, include insurance in the cost of the trip
or can arrange insurance policies through a partnering provider, a
convenient and often cost-effective way for the traveler to obtain
insurance. Make sure the tour company is a reputable one, how-
ever: Some experts suggest you avoid buying insurance from the
tour or cruise company you’re traveling with, saying it’s better to
buy from a third-party insurer than to put all your money in one
place.
 For domestic travel, buying medical insurance for a trip doesn’t
make sense for most travelers. Most existing health policies cover
you if you get sick away from home — but check before you go,
particularly if you’re insured by an HMO.
For travel overseas, most health plans (including Medicare and
Medicaid) do not provide coverage, and the ones that do often
require you to pay for services upfront and reimburse you only
after you return home. Even if your plan does cover overseas treat-
ment, most out-of-country hospitals make you pay your bills
upfront, and send you a refund only after you’ve returned home
and filed the necessary paperwork with your insurance company.
As a safety net, you may want to buy travel medical insurance, par-
ticularly if you’re traveling to a remote or high-risk area where
emergency evacuation is a possible scenario. If you require addi-
tional medical insurance, try MEDEX Assistance (% 410-453-6300;
www.medexassist.com) or Travel Assistance International
(% 800-821-2828; www.travelassistance.com; for general infor-
mation on services, call the company’s Worldwide Assistance
Services, Inc., at % 800-777-8710).
 Lost-luggage insurance is not necessary for most travelers. On
domestic flights, checked baggage is covered up to $2,500 per tick-
eted passenger. On international flights (including U.S. portions of
international trips), baggage coverage is limited to approximately
$9.07 per pound, up to approximately $635 per checked bag. If you
plan to check items more valuable than the standard liability, see if
your valuables are covered by your homeowner’s policy, get bag-
gage insurance as part of your comprehensive travel-insurance
package, or buy Travel Guard’s “BagTrak” product. Don’t buy insur-
ance at the airport, because it’s usually overpriced. Be sure to take
any valuables or irreplaceable items with you in your carry-on lug-
gage, because many valuables (including books, money, and elec-
tronics) aren’t covered by airline policies.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Cancún and the Yucatán

If your luggage is lost, immediately file a lost-luggage claim at the
airport, detailing the luggage contents. For most airlines, you must
report delayed, damaged, or lost baggage within four hours of
arrival. The airlines are required to deliver luggage, once found,
directly to your house or destination free of charge.

insurers: Access America (% 866-807-3982; www.accessamerica.

guard.com); Travel Insured International (% 800-243-3174; www.
travelinsured.com); and Travelex Insurance Services (% 888-
457-4602; www.travelex-insurance.com).
Staying Healthy When You Travel
Apart from how getting sick can ruin your vacation, getting sick also can
present the problem of finding a doctor you trust when you’re away
from home. Bring all your medications with you in the original bottles,
as well as a prescription for more if you run out. Bring an extra pair of
contact lenses in case you lose one. And don’t forget the Pepto-Bismol
for common travelers’ ailments like upset stomach or diarrhea. Before
travel to foreign destinations, some doctors will write a prescription for
an antibiotic like Cipro, for you to bring to a pharmacy in Mexico if you
are experiencing a bout with severe diarrhea and unable to find immedi-
ate medical attention. A thorough exam and diagnosis is always pre-
ferred. Ask your physician if they think this is advisable.
If you have health insurance, check with your provider to find out the
extent of your coverage outside of your home area. Be sure to carry
your identification card in your wallet. And if you worry that your exist-
ing policy isn’t sufficient, purchase medical insurance for more compre-
hensive coverage. (See the “Playing It Safe with Travel and Medical
Insurance,” section earlier in this chapter.)
Talk to your doctor before leaving on a trip if you have a serious and/or
chronic illness. For conditions such as epilepsy, diabetes, or heart prob-
lems, wear a MedicAlert identification tag (% 888-633-4298; www.
medicalert.org), which immediately alerts doctors to your condition
and gives them access to your records through MedicAlert’s 24-hour hot
line. Contact the International Association for Medical Assistance to
Travelers (IAMAT; % 716-754-4883 or, in Canada, 416-652-0137; www.
iamat.org) for tips on travel and health concerns in the countries
you’re visiting, and lists of local, English-speaking doctors. The United
States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (% 800-311-3435;
www.cdc.gov) provides up-to-date information on health hazards by
region or country and offers tips on food safety.
Chapter 9: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 89

If you do get sick, ask the concierge at your hotel to recommend a local
doctor — even his or her own doctor, if necessary. Another good option
is to call the closest consular office and ask for a referral to a doctor.
Most consulates have a listing of reputable English-speaking doctors.

Avoiding turista!
It’s called “travelers’ diarrhea” or turista, the Spanish word for “tourist.” I’m talking
about the persistent diarrhea, often accompanied by fever, nausea, and vomiting, that
used to attack many travelers to Mexico. Some folks in the United States call this afflic-
tion “Montezuma’s revenge,” but you won’t hear it referred to this way in Mexico.
Widespread improvements in infrastructure, sanitation, and education have practi-
cally eliminated this ailment, especially in well-developed resort areas. Most travel-
ers make a habit of drinking only bottled water, which also helps to protect against
unfamiliar bacteria. In resort areas, and generally throughout Mexico, only purified
ice is used. Doctors say this ailment isn’t caused by just one “bug,” but by a combi-
nation of consuming different foods and water, upsetting your schedule, being over-
tired, and experiencing the stresses of travel. A good high-potency (or “therapeutic”)
vitamin supplement and extra vitamin C can help. And yogurt is good for healthy diges-
tion. If you do happen to come down with this ailment, nothing beats Pepto-Bismol,
readily available in Mexico.
Preventing turista: The U.S. Public Health Service recommends the following meas-
ures for preventing travelers’ diarrhea:
 Get enough sleep.
 Don’t overdo the sun.
 Drink only purified water, which means tea, coffee, and other beverages made
with boiled water; canned or bottled carbonated beverages and water; or beer
and wine. Most restaurants with a large tourist clientele use only purified water
and ice.
 Choose food carefully. In general, avoid salads, uncooked vegetables, and unpas-
teurized milk or milk products (including cheese). However, salads in a first-class
restaurant, or in a restaurant that serves a lot of tourists, are generally safe to eat.
Choose food that’s freshly cooked and still hot. Peelable fruit is ideal. Don’t eat
undercooked meat, fish, or shellfish.
 In addition, something as simple as washing hands frequently can prevent the
spread of germs and go a long way toward keeping turista at bay.
Because dehydration can quickly become life-threatening, be especially careful to
replace fluids and electrolytes (potassium, sodium, and the like) during a bout of diar-
rhea. Rehydrate by drinking Pedialyte, a rehydration solution available at most
Mexican pharmacies, sports drinks, or glasses of natural fruit juice (high in potassium)
with a pinch of salt added. Or try a glass of boiled, pure water with a quarter teaspoon
of sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) and a bit of lime juice added.

Most beach destinations in Mexico have at least one modern facility
staffed by doctors used to treating the most common ailments of tourists.
In the case of an emergency, a service from the United States can fly
people to American hospitals: Air-Evac (% 888-554-9729; www.air
evac.com) is a 24-hour air ambulance. You can also contact the service
in Guadalajara (% 01-800-305-9400, 3-616-9616, or 3-615-2471). Several
companies offer air-evac service; for a list, refer to the U.S. State
Department Web site at http://travel.state.gov/medical.html.
If you’re traveling with infants and/or children in Mexico, be extra care-
ful to avoid anything that’s not bottled. You can purchase infant formu-
las, baby foods, canned milk, and other baby supplies from grocery
stores. Your best bet is to carry extra baby eats when you go out. Most
Mexican restaurants will cheerfully warm bottles and packaged goods
for your child.
Be especially careful of sun exposure because sunburn can be extremely
dangerous. Protect the little ones with special SPF bathing suits and
cover-ups and regularly apply a strong sunscreen.
Dehydration can also make your child seriously ill. Make sure that your
child drinks plenty of water and juices throughout the day. Especially
when they’re in the pool or at the beach having fun, they may not
remember that they’re thirsty, so it’s up to you to remind them. Sunburn
also contributes to and complicates dehydration.
From our collective experience of living in and traveling throughout
Mexico, we can honestly say that most health problems that foreign
tourists to Mexico encounter are self-induced. If you take in too much
sun, too many margaritas, and too many street tacos within hours of
your arrival, don’t blame the water if you get sick. You’d be surprised
how many people try to make up for all the fun they’ve missed in the
past year on their first day on vacation in Mexico.
Staying Safe
If you find yourself getting friendly with the locals — and we mean
friendly to the point of a fling — don’t be embarrassed to carry or insist
on stopping for condoms and then use them! Too many vacationing men
and women are filled with morning-after regrets because they didn’t pro-
tect themselves. Don’t allow your fear of being judged make you do
something that’s frankly stupid. Also know that Mexico’s teen-to-20-
something population has a rapidly escalating AIDS rate — especially in
resort areas — due to the transient nature of the population and poor
overall education about this disease.
When it comes to drugs, many outsiders have the impression that the
easygoing nature of these tropical towns means an equally laid-back atti-
tude exists toward drug use. Not so. Marijuana, cocaine, Ecstasy, and
Chapter 9: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 91

other mood-altering drugs are illegal in Mexico. In some places, police
randomly search people — including obvious tourists — who are walk-
ing the streets at night.
If you do choose to indulge, don’t expect any special treatment if you’re
caught. In fact, everything bad you’ve ever heard about a Mexican jail is
considered to be close to the truth — if not a rose-colored version of it.
Mexico employs the Napoleonic Code of law, meaning that you’re guilty
until proven innocent. Simply stated, time in jail isn’t worth the potential
high.
Renting a Car
The first thing you should know is that car-rental costs are high in Mexico
because cars are more expensive. However, the condition of rental cars
has improved greatly over the years, and clean, comfortable, new cars 
are the norm. The basic cost for a one-day rental of a Volkswagen (VW)
Beetle, with unlimited mileage (but before the 15 percent tax and $15–$25
daily for insurance), is $35 in Cancún. Renting by the week gives you a
lower daily rate. At press time, Avis was offering a basic seven-day weekly
rate for a Ford Fiesta (before tax or insurance) of $216 in Cancún. Prices
may be considerably higher if you rent around a major holiday.
Car-rental companies usually write a credit card charge in U.S. dollars.
Be careful of deductibles, which vary greatly in Mexico. Some deductibles
are as high as $2,500, which immediately comes out of your pocket in
case of car damage. Hertz has a $1,000 deductible on a VW Beetle; the
deductible at Avis is $500 for the same car.
Always get the insurance. Insurance is offered in two parts. Collision and
damage insurance covers your car and others if the accident is your
fault, and personal accident insurance covers you and anyone in your
car. Read the fine print on the back of your rental agreement and note
that insurance may be invalid if you have an accident while driving on
an unpaved road.
Finding the best car-rental deal
Car-rental rates vary even more than airline fares. The price depends on
the size of the car, the length of time you keep it, where and when you
pick it up and drop it off, where you take it, and a host of other factors.
Asking a few key questions can save you hundreds of dollars. For exam-
ple, weekend rates may be lower than weekday rates. Ask whether the
rate is the same for Friday morning pickup as it is for Thursday night. If
you’re keeping the car five or more days, a weekly rate may be cheaper
than the daily rate. Some companies may assess a drop-off charge if 
you don’t return the car to the same renting location; others, notably
National, do not. Ask whether the rate is cheaper if you pick up the car
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Cancún and the Yucatán 
92

at the airport or a location in town. Don’t forget to mention membership
in AAA, AARP, frequent-flier programs, and trade unions. These member-
ships usually entitle you to discounts ranging from 5 to 30 percent. Ask
your travel agent to check any and all of these rates. And most car rentals
are worth at least 805km (500 miles) on your frequent-flier account!
As with other aspects of planning your trip, using the Internet can make
comparison shopping for a car rental much easier. All the major booking
Web sites — Kayak (www.kayak.com), Travelocity (www.travelocity.
com), Expedia (www.expedia.com), Orbitz (www.orbitz.com), Yahoo!
Travel (www.travel.yahoo.com), and Cheap Tickets (www.cheap
tickets.com), for example — have search engines that can dig up dis-
counted car-rental rates. Just enter the size of the car you want, the
pickup and return dates, and the city where you want to rent, and the
server returns a price. You can even make the reservation through 
these sites.
In addition to the standard coverage, car-rental companies also offer
additional liability insurance (if you harm others in an accident), per-
sonal accident insurance (if you harm yourself or your passengers), and
personal effects insurance (if your luggage is stolen from your car). If
you have insurance on your car at home, you’re probably covered for
most of these unlikelihoods. If your own insurance doesn’t cover you for
rentals or if you don’t have auto insurance, consider the additional cov-
erage. But weigh the likelihood of getting into an accident or losing your
luggage against the cost of these insurance options (as much as $20 per
day combined), which can significantly add to the price of your rental.
Some companies also offer refueling packages, in which you pay for an
entire tank of gas upfront. The price is usually fairly competitive with
local gas prices, but you don’t get credit for any gas remaining in the
tank. If you reject this option, you pay only for the gas you use, but you
have to return the car with a full tank or face hefty charges per gallon for
any shortfall. If a stop at a gas station on the way to the airport will
make you miss your plane, by all means take advantage of the fuel pur-
chase option. Otherwise, skip it.
Remembering that safety comes first
If you decide to rent a car and drive in Mexico, you need to keep a few
things in mind:
 Most Mexican roads are not up to U.S. standards of smoothness,
hardness, width of curve, grade of hill, or safety markings. The
roads in and around Cancún are a notable exception, but elsewhere
in the Yucatán, this observation generally holds true.
 Driving at night is dangerous — the roads aren’t good, and they’re
rarely lit; trucks, carts, pedestrians, and bicycles usually have no
lights; and you can hit potholes, animals, rocks, dead ends, or
uncrossable bridges without warning.
Chapter 9: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 93

 Never turn left by stopping in the middle of a highway with your
left signal on. Instead, pull off the highway onto the right shoulder,
wait for traffic to clear, and then proceed across the road.
 Credit cards are generally not accepted for gas purchases.
 Places called vulcanizadora or llantera repair flat tires. Such places
are commonly open 24 hours a day on the most traveled highways.
Even if the place looks empty, chances are you’ll find someone who
can help you fix a flat.
 When possible, many Mexicans drive away from minor accidents,
or try to make an immediate settlement, to avoid involving the
police.
 If the police arrive while the involved persons are still at the scene,
everyone may be locked up until responsibility is determined and
damages are settled. If you were in a rental car, notify the rental
company immediately and ask how to contact the nearest adjuster.
(You did buy insurance with the rental, right?)
Staying Connected by Cellphone
The three letters that define much of the world’s wireless capabilities
are GSM (Global System for Mobiles), a big, seamless network that
makes for easy cross-border cellphone use throughout Europe and
dozens of other countries worldwide. In the United States, T-Mobile and
Cingular use this quasi-universal system; in Mexico, USACell and Telcel
are the predominant mobile carriers, and both use GSM.
If your cellphone is on a GSM system and you have a world-capable
multiband phone such as many Sony Ericsson, Motorola, or Samsung
models, you can make and receive calls across civilized areas on much
of the globe, from Andorra to Uganda. Just call your wireless operator
and ask for international roaming to be activated on your account.
Unfortunately, per-minute charges can be high — usually $1 to $1.50.
That’s why it’s important to buy an unlocked world phone from the get-
go. Many cellphone operators sell locked phones that restrict you from
using any other removable computer memory phone chip (called a SIM
card) other than the ones they supply. Having an unlocked phone allows
you to install a cheap, prepaid SIM card (found at a local retailer) in your
destination country. (Show your phone to the salesperson; not all
phones work on all networks.) You’ll get a local phone number — and
much, much lower calling rates. Getting an already locked phone
unlocked can be a complicated process, but it can be done; just call your
cellular operator and say you’ll be going abroad for several months and
want to use the phone with a local provider.
For many, renting a phone is a good idea. (Even worldphone owners will
have to rent new phones if they’re traveling to non-GSM regions, such as
Japan or Korea.) Although you can rent a phone from any number of
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Cancún and the Yucatán 
94

overseas sites, including kiosks at airports and at car-rental agencies, we
suggest renting the phone before you leave home. That way you can give
loved ones and business associates your new number, make sure the
phone works, and take the phone wherever you go — especially helpful
for overseas trips through several countries, where local phone-rental
agencies often bill in local currency and may not let you take the phone
to another country.
Phone rental isn’t cheap. You’ll usually pay $40 to $50 per week, plus air-
time fees of at least a dollar a minute. The bottom line: Shop around.
Phone rentals in Mexico are still rare, so it’s best to rent before your
arrival. One option is to purchase an inexpensive phone that takes 
prepaid cards, which you can purchase at any Telcel service provider 
in Mexico, for just the amount of service you feel you’ll need during 
your trip.
Two good wireless rental companies are InTouch USA (% 800-872-7626;
www.intouchglobal.com) and RoadPost (% 888-290-1606 or 905-272-
5665; www.roadpost.com). Give them your itinerary, and they’ll tell you
what wireless products you need. InTouch will also, for free, advise you
on whether your existing phone will work overseas; simply call % 703-
222-7161 between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. EST, or go to http://intouch
global.com/travel.htm.
Another option that can cut down on the cost of making international
calls from Mexico is through Internet phone services, like Net2phone
(% 877-627-4663; www.net2phone.com); you can purchase an interna-
tional calling card, find out the local access number, and then use a pay
phone to make a local call, put in an access code, and dial internation-
ally for less than 5¢ a minute. If you have a laptop, you can also down-
load Skype (www.skype.com), which allows you to call from one Skype
member to another for free, or you can purchase minutes that allow you
to make international calls to regular telephones from your computer for
a really low rate.
Accessing the Internet Away from Home
You have any number of ways to check your e-mail and access the
Internet on the road. Of course, using your own laptop — or even a PDA
(personal digital assistant) or electronic organizer with a modem —
gives you the most flexibility. But even if you don’t have a computer, you
can still access your e-mail and even your office computer from cyber-
cafes and Wi-Fi (wireless fidelity) access found in many of the hotels.
It’s hard nowadays to find a city that doesn’t have a few cybercafes.
Although there’s no definitive directory for cybercafes — these are inde-
pendent businesses, after all — two places to start looking are at www.
cybercaptive.com and www.cybercafe.com.
Chapter 9: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 95

Within Mexico’s popular tourism destinations, cybercafes are very
common, catering to travelers’ increasing need — or desire — to stay con-
nected while away. In each of the different locations in Mexico’s Yucatán,
we list several recommended cybercafes, along with rates and hours.
If you’re bringing your own computer, the buzzword in computer access
to familiarize yourself with is Wi-Fi (wireless fidelity), and more and
more hotels, cafes, and retailers are signing on as wireless hotspots from
where you can get high-speed connection without cable wires, network-
ing hardware, or a phone line. You can get Wi-Fi connection one of 
several ways. Many laptops sold in the last year have built-in Wi-Fi capa-
bility (an 802.11b wireless Ethernet connection). Mac owners have their
own networking technology, Apple AirPort. For those with older comput-
ers, an 802.11b/Wi-Fi card (around $50) can be plugged into your laptop.
You sign up for wireless access service much as you do cellphone serv-
ice, through a plan offered by one of several commercial companies that
have made wireless service available in airports, hotel lobbies, and
coffee shops, primarily in the United States (followed by the U.K. and
Japan). T-Mobile Hotspot (www.t-mobile.com/hotspot) serves up
wireless connections at more than 1,000 Starbucks coffee shops nation-
wide. Boingo (www.boingo.com) and Wayport (www.wayport.com)
have set up networks in airports and high-class hotel lobbies. iPass
providers also give you access to a few hundred wireless hotel lobby
setups. Best of all, you don’t need to be staying at the Four Seasons to
use the hotel’s network; just set yourself up on a nice couch in the lobby.
The companies’ pricing policies can be byzantine, with a variety of
monthly, per-connection, and per-minute plans, but in general you pay
around $30 a month for limited access — and as more and more compa-
nies jump on the wireless bandwagon, prices are likely to get even more
competitive.
There are also places that provide free wireless networks in cities
around the world. To locate these free hotspots, go to www.personal
telco.net/index.cgi/WirelessCommunities.
If Wi-Fi isn’t available at your destination, most business-class hotels
throughout the world offer dataports for laptop modems, and a few
thousand hotels in the United States and Europe now offer free high-
speed Internet access using an Ethernet network cable. You can bring
your own cables, but most hotels rent them for around $10. Call your
hotel in advance to see what your options are.
In addition, major Internet Service Providers (ISPs) have local access
numbers around the world, allowing you to go online by simply placing
a local call. Check your ISP’s Web site or call its toll-free number and ask
how you can use your current account away from home, and how much
it will cost. If you’re traveling outside the reach of your ISP, the iPass net-
work has dial-up numbers in most of the world’s countries. You’ll have
to sign up with an iPass provider, who will then tell you how to set up
your computer for your destination(s). For a list of iPass providers, go to
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Cancún and the Yucatán 
96

www.ipass.com and click on “Individual Purchase.” One solid provider
is i2roam (www.i2roam.com; % 866-811-6209 or 920-235-0475).
Wherever you go, bring a connection kit of the right power and phone
adapters, a spare phone cord, and a spare Ethernet network cable — or
find out whether your hotel supplies them to guests. Because Mexico
shares the same electric current as the United States, you won’t need
any special adaptors or equipment other than what you’d use at home.
Keeping Up with Airline Security Measures
With the federalization of airport security, security procedures at U.S.
airports are more stable and consistent than ever. Generally, you’ll be
fine if you arrive at the airport one hour before a domestic flight and
two hours before an international flight; if you show up late, tell an air-
line employee and she’ll probably whisk you to the front of the line.
Bring a current, government-issued photo ID such as a driver’s license
or passport. Keep your ID at the ready to show at check-in, the security
checkpoint, and sometimes even the gate. (Children under 18 do not
need government-issued photo IDs for domestic flights, but they do for
international flights to most countries.)
In 2003, the TSA phased out gate check-in at all U.S. airports. And 
E-tickets have made paper tickets nearly obsolete. Sometimes passen-
gers with E-tickets can beat the ticket-counter lines by using airport
electronic kiosks, where you can print your own boarding pass by
inserting a credit card or frequent-flier card. If you don’t have luggage,
you can simply proceed to the security checkpoint where you will pre-
sent your passport. Otherwise, an expedited line at the ticketing counter
puts baggage claim tickets on your luggage and will either take the bags
or direct you to a screening area where luggage is being collected. With
the new passport law in place for Mexico, many airlines require you to
go to the ticketing desk so an agent can review your travel documents.
Call customer service of the airline that you will be traveling with to see
if self check-in is available at your departure city. Unfortunately, the con-
venience of curbside check-in is limited to domestic travel. If you need
assistance with your luggage, a bag handler can carry your bags to the
ticketing counter for you.
Airport screeners may decide that your checked luggage needs to be
searched by hand. You can now purchase luggage locks that allow
screeners to open and re-lock a checked bag with a special code or key 
if hand-searching is necessary. For more information on the locks, visit
www.travelsentry.org. You can also look for Travel Sentry–certified
locks at luggage or travel shops and Brookstone stores (you can buy
them online at www.brookstone.com). If you use something other than
TSA-approved locks, your lock will be cut off your suitcase if a TSA agent
needs to hand-search your luggage.
Chapter 9: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 97

To carry on or not to carry on . . .
Security checkpoint lines are getting shorter than they were during late
2001 and 2002, but some still get really backed-up — especially during
holidays and peak travel times. If you have trouble standing for long
periods of time, tell an airline employee; the airline will provide a wheel-
chair. Speed up security by not wearing metal objects such as big belt
buckles. If you’ve got metallic body parts, a note from your doctor can
prevent a long chat with security screeners. Keep in mind that only tick-
eted passengers are allowed past security, except for folks escorting
passengers with disabilities or children. Federalization has stabilized
what you can carry on and what you can’t. The general rule is that
sharp things are out, nail clippers, cigar cutters, knitting needles, and
corkscrews are okay, and food must be passed through the X-ray
machine. Bring food in your carry on instead of checking it, because
explosive-detection machines used on checked luggage have been
known to mistake food (especially chocolate, for some reason) for
bombs. Travelers in the United States are allowed one carry-on bag, 
plus a personal item, such as a purse, briefcase, or laptop bag. Carry-
on hoarders can stuff all sorts of things into a laptop bag; as long as it
has a laptop in it, it’s still considered a personal item.
Then, there’s the liquid quandary. You can bring liquids, gels, and aerosols
in your carry-on luggage, but they are limited to 3-ounce travel sizes
packed in a quart-sized, zip-top plastic bag. Gallon-sized bags and fold-
over sandwich bags are not acceptable. When you go through the security
check you must remove this plastic bag from your carryon or personal
item so it can be screened separately. Certain types of liquids such as
lighter fluid, fuels, and things of the like are prohibited. On the other hand,
certain liquids are not subject to these size limitations, such as breast
milk and baby food when traveling with a small child; life-supporting 
liquids such as blood products; and prescription and certain over-the-
counter medications like KY Jelly, eye drops, and saline solutions for 
medical purposes. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has
issued a list of restricted items; check its Web site (www.tsa.gov) for
details.

Discovering Cancún

In this part . . .
T
he most popular of Mexico’s beach resorts, Cancún per-
fectly showcases the country’s breathtaking natural beauty
and the depth of its 1,000-year-old history. Cancún is both the
peak of Caribbean splendor and a modern mega-resort. It
boasts translucent turquoise waters, powdery, white-sand
beaches, and a wide array of nearby shopping, dining, and
nightlife choices, in addition to a ton of other activities. To top
it all off, Cancún is easily accessible by air, making a visit here
often more convenient and more affordable than many other
beach vacations.
Many travelers who are apprehensive about visiting foreign
soil feel completely at home and at ease in Cancún: English is
spoken, dollars are accepted, roads are well paved, and lawns
are manicured. A lot of the shopping and dining takes place in
malls, and we swear that some hotels seem larger than a
small town. In the following chapters, we introduce you to
this Caribbean-coast jewel and offer lots of tips for making
the most of your stay on this nonstop island.

I
n 1974, a team of Mexican-government computer analysts selected
Cancún as an area for tourism development because of its ideal com-
bination of features to attract travelers — a reliable climate; beautiful,
untouched, white-sand beaches; clear, shallow water; and proximity to
historic ruins. Cancún is actually an island, a 23km-long (14-mile) sliver
of land shaped roughly like the number “7.” Two bridges, spanning the
expansive Nichupté Lagoon, connect Cancún to the mainland. (Cancún
means “Golden Snake” in the Mayan language.)
With more than 27,000 hotel rooms in the area to choose from, Cancún
can no longer claim to be “untouched.” But this resort town has accom-
modations for every taste and every budget. Here, I review the two main
areas — Cancún Island (Isla Cancún) and Cancún City (Ciudad Cancún),
located inland, to the west of the island.
Cancún is definitely the destination to try out an air-hotel package.
Although the rack rates at Cancún’s hotels are among the highest in
Mexico, the package deals are among the best because of the large
number of charter companies operating here. If you do arrive without a
hotel reservation — not recommended during peak weeks surrounding
the Christmas and Easter holidays — you’re likely to be able to bargain
your way into a great rate. For more information on air-hotel packages,
see Chapter 6. As of January of 2007, due to a change in Homeland
Security, you need a passport or other appropriate credentials (see
Chapter 9) to enter Cancún. After that, you couldn’t be in a more
American-friendly destination if you tried. If this trip is your first to
Mexico — or to a foreign country — you’ll probably find that any sense
of culture shock is practically nonexistent. But you’ll be more comfort-
able knowing a few details before you arrive. In this chapter, I take you
from the plane, through the airport, and to your hotel, helping you
quickly get your bearings in this easy-to-navigate resort. I continue with
tips on everything from taxis to taxes.

Arriving in Cancún
Cancún has one of Mexico’s busiest and most modern airports, which
seems to be in a constant state of construction to improve and expand
its services. Still, it’s easy to navigate. After checking in with immigra-
tion, collecting your bags, and passing through the Customs checkpoint,
you’re ready to enjoy your holiday!
Navigating passport control and Customs
Immigration check-in can be a lengthy wait, depending on the number 
of planes arriving at the same time, but it’s generally an easy and unre-
markable process in which officials ask you to show your passport and
complete a tourist card, known as the FMT. (See Chapter 9 for more
information.)
Your FMT is an important document, so take good care of it. You’re 
supposed to keep the FMT with you at all times, because you may be
required to show it if you run into any sort of trouble. You also need to
turn in the FMT upon departure; you may even be unable to leave with-
out returning it.
Next is the baggage claim area. Here, porters stand by to help with your
bags, and they’re well worth the price of the tip — about a dollar a bag.
After you collect your luggage, you pass through another checkpoint.
Something that looks like a traffic light awaits you here — otherwise
known as Mexico’s random search procedure for Customs. You press a
button, and if the light turns green, you’re free to go. If it turns red, you
need to open each of your bags for a quick search. If you have an unusu-
ally large bag or an excessive amount of luggage, you may be searched
regardless of the traffic-light outcome.
Getting to your hotel
Just past the traffic light, you’ll be offered a package of tourist 
information — take it! Included in this welcome kit, presented by the
Visitors Bureau, is a wealth of discount coupons as well as handy maps.
Next, you pass through what appears to be an information booth area,
with big glossy photos of the treasures that await you out the door.
Don’t stop here — unless you want to subject yourself to a timeshare
pitch. This pitch may reward you with free transportation to your hotel,
but there will be a cost in time spent listening to the sales presentation
at a later time. Just move on through and exit to the street, where you’ll
find transportation to your hotel. Choose between a colectivo (shared
minivan) or a private taxi. If three or more of you are traveling together,
you’re probably better off opting for the private cab service. With so
many hotels for the collective van to stop at, it can easily take an hour to
get to your room, and believe me, the drivers wait until the vans are fully
packed before departing! Check out the “Cancún Orientation Map” in
this chapter to see where your hotel is positioned relative to the airport.

Chapter 10: Settling into Cancún

The airport is on the mainland, close to the southern end of the Cancún
area. It’s about 14km (9 miles) to downtown Ciudad Cancún (Cancún
City), which is also on the mainland. The start of the Zona Hotelera
(Hotel Zone), located on Isla Cancún (Cancún Island), is 10km (61⁄2 miles)
from the airport — about a 20-minute drive east from the airport along
wide, well-paved roads.
Riding with a colectivo or hiring a taxi
If you do choose the colectivo service, which consists of air-conditioned
vans, buy your ticket at the booth that’s located to the far right as you
exit the baggage claim area. You can purchase tickets for private cab
service at a booth inside the airport terminal. Tickets for both the colec-
tivo vans and the private taxis are based on a fixed rate depending on
the distance to your destination. A taxi ticket is good for up to four pas-
sengers. The colectivos run from Cancún’s international airport into
town and the Hotel Zone and cost about $9 per person.
Rates for a private taxi from the airport are around $20 to downtown
Cancún or $28 to $40 to the Hotel Zone, depending on your destination.
There’s minibus transportation (for $9.50) from the airport to the Puerto
Juárez passenger ferry that takes you to Isla Mujeres. You can also hire a
private taxi for this trip for about $40.
No colectivo service returns to the airport from Ciudad Cancún or the
Hotel Zone, so you must hire a taxi, but the rate should be much less
than the trip from the airport. The reason? Only federally chartered taxis
may take fares from the airport, but any local taxi may bring passengers
to the airport. Ask for a fare estimate at your hotel, but expect to pay
about half what you were charged to get from the airport to your hotel.
Renting a car
Most major car-rental firms have outlets at the airport, so if you’re 
renting a car, consider picking it up and dropping it off at the airport to
save on airport-transportation costs. Another way to save money is to
arrange for the rental before you leave home. If you wait until you arrive,
the daily cost of a rental car may be around $50 to $75 for a compact car,
whereas by pre-booking, the same Ford Fiesta or similar will rent for $35
to $40 per day.
Although you certainly don’t have to rent a car here — taxis and buses
are plentiful — this destination is one where having a car may make
sense for a day or two. First, it can be a convenience, although it’s not
likely to save you bundles on transportation costs, based on the low rel-
ative prices of transportation around Cancún. The roads in and around
Cancún are excellent, and parking is readily available in most of the
shopping/entertainment malls. The second — and main — reason for
renting a car, however, is the flexibility that it provides in exploring the
surrounding areas — a day trip down the coast or to nearby sights is
definitely recommended. But if you’re not comfortable driving, you can
easily cover this ground in one of the many sightseeing tours available.

Platinum Car Rental (% 998-883-5555; www.platinumcarrental.com)
can make the experience of renting a car a fun activity as opposed to 
a simple means of getting from point A to point B — whether it’s for a
whole day or for just a few hours. Specializing in luxury and exotic cars
like the SLR McLaren, Mercedes, or Porsche, Platinum rents these beau-
ties for anywhere between $100 to $300 for four hours of fun; other dura-
tions and prices available. Just be ready to put a hefty deposit on your
credit card!
If you do rent a car, keep any valuables out of plain sight. Although
Cancún’s crime rate is very low, the only real problem tends to be rental-
car break-ins.

Getting Around Cancún
As I discuss a bit in the “Getting to your hotel” section earlier in this
chapter, there are really two Cancúns: Isla Cancún (Cancún Island) and
Ciudad Cancún (Cancún City). The latter, on the mainland, has restau-
rants, shops, and less expensive hotels, as well as all the other establish-
ments that make life function — pharmacies, dentists, automotive
shops, banks, travel and airline agencies, car-rental firms, and so on —
which are all located within an approximately nine-square-block area.
The city’s main thoroughfare is Avenida Tulum. Heading south, Avenida
Tulum becomes the highway to the airport, Playa del Carmen, and
Tulum. (It actually runs all the way down to Belize.) Heading north,
Avenida Tulum intersects the highway to Mérida and the road to Puerto
Juárez and the Isla Mujeres ferries.
The famed Zona Hotelera (Hotel Zone, also called the Zona Turística,
or Tourist Zone) stretches out along Isla Cancún, which is a sandy strip
of land 23km (14 miles) long and shaped like a “7.” The Playa Linda
Bridge, at the north end of the island, and the Punta Nizuc Bridge, at the
southern end, connect Isla Cancún to the mainland. Between these two
bridges lies Laguna Nichupté. Avenida Cobá, coming from Cancún City,
becomes Blvd. Kukulkán, the island’s main traffic artery. Actually, Blvd.
Kukulkán is the only main road on the island, so getting lost here would
really take some effort! To get the hang of pronouncing it quickly enough,
say koo-cool-can (as in, Cancún is sooo cool!). Cancún’s international air-
port is located just inland from the south end of the island.
Ciudad Cancún’s street-numbering system is a holdover from its early
days. Addresses in the city are still expressed by the number of the build-
ing lot and the manzana (block) or supermanzana (group of city blocks).
The city is still relatively compact, and you can easily cover the down-
town commercial section on foot. Streets here are named after famous
Maya cities. Chichén Itzá, Tulum, and Uxmal are the names of the boule-
vards in downtown Cancún, as well as nearby archaeological sites.
On the island, addresses are given by their kilometer (km) number on
Blvd. Kukulkán or by reference to some well-known location. The point
on the island closest to Ciudad Cancún is km 1; km 20 is found at the
very bottom of the “7” at Punta Nizuc, where the Club Med is located.
Taking a taxi
Taxi prices in Cancún are clearly set by zone, although keeping track of
what’s in which zone can take some work. Taxi rates within the Hotel
Zone are a minimum fare of $5 per ride, making it one of the most expen-
sive taxi areas in Mexico.
In addition, taxis operating in the Hotel Zone feel perfectly justified in
having a discriminatory pricing structure: Local residents pay about a
fraction of what tourists pay, and guests at higher-priced hotels pay
Part III: Discovering Cancún 
106

about twice the fare that guests in budget hotels are charged. You can
thank the taxi union for this discrepancy — it establishes the rate sched-
ule. Rates should be posted outside your hotel; however, if you have a
question, all taxi drivers are required to have an official rate card in their
taxis, although it’s generally in Spanish.
Within the downtown area, the cost is about $1.50 per cab ride (not per
person); within any other zone, it’s $5. Traveling between two zones also
costs $5. If you cross two zones, the cost is $7.50. Settle on a price in
advance or check at your hotel where destinations and prices are gener-
ally posted. Trips to the airport from most zones cost $14. Taxis also
have a rate of $18 per hour for travel around the city and Hotel Zone, but
you can generally negotiate this rate down to $10 to $12. If you want to
hire a taxi to take you to Chichén Itzá or along the Riviera Maya, expect
to pay about $30 per hour — many taxi drivers feel that they’re also pro-
viding guide services.
Catching a bus
Bus travel within Cancún continues to improve and is increasingly the
most popular way of getting around for both residents and tourists. Air-
conditioned and rarely crowded, the Hotel Zone buses run 24 hours a
day. You can easily spot the bus stops using the signs posted along the
roads that have a bus on them. Bus stops are in front of most of the main
hotels and shopping centers. In town, almost everything is within walk-
ing distance. The city buses marked Ruta 1 and Ruta 2 (also marked
“Hoteles”) travel frequently from the mainland to the beaches along
Avenida Tulum (the main street) and all the way to Punta Nizuc at the
far end of the Hotel Zone on Isla Cancún.
Ruta 8 buses go to Puerto Juárez/Punta Sam, where you can catch ferries
to Isla Mujeres. The buses stop on the east side of Avenida Tulum. These
buses operate between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. daily. Beware of private buses
along the same route; they charge far more than the public ones. The
public buses have the fare amount painted on the front; at the time of
publication, the fare was 6 pesos (60¢).
Zipping around on a moped
Mopeds are a convenient and popular way to cruise around through the
very congested traffic, but they can be dangerous. Rentals start at $25
for a day, and the shops require a credit card voucher as security for 
the moped.
When you rent a moped, you should receive a crash helmet (it’s the law)
and instructions on how to lock the wheels when you park. Be sure to
read the fine print on the back of the rental agreement regarding liability
for repairs or replacement in case of accident, theft, or vandalism.
Chapter 10: Settling into Cancún 107

Choosing Your Location
Island hotels are stacked along the beach like dominoes; almost all of
them offer clean, modern facilities. Extravagance reigns in the more
recently built hotels, many of which are awash in a sea of marble and
glass. However, some hotels, although they are exclusive, adopt a more
relaxed attitude.
The water is placid on the upper end of the island facing Bahía de
Mujeres (Bay of the Women), while beaches lining the long side of the
island facing the Caribbean are subject to choppier water and crashing
waves on windy days. Be aware that the farther south you go on the
island, the longer it takes (20–30 minutes in traffic) to get back to the
“action spots,” which are primarily located between the Plaza Flamingo
and Punta Cancún on the island — close to the point that connects the
two parts of the “7” — and along Avenida Tulum on the mainland. (To
get an idea of Cancún’s different neighborhoods, see the “Cancún
Orientation Map” earlier in this chapter.)
Almost all major hotel chains are represented along Isla Cancún, also
known as the Hotel Zone, so you can view my selections as a represen-
tative summary, with a select number of notable places to stay. The real-
ity is that Cancún is such a popular package destination from the United
States that prices and special deals are often the deciding factors for
vacationers traveling here.
Ciudad Cancún is the more authentic Mexican town of the two loca-
tions, where the workers in the hotels live and day-to-day business is
conducted for those not on vacation. The area offers independently
owned, smaller, and much less expensive stays — the difference in
prices between these accommodations and their island counterparts is
truly remarkable. Many hotels in Ciudad Cancún offer a shuttle service
to sister properties in Isla Cancún, meaning you can still access the
beach for a fraction of the price in return for a little extra travel time.
Many of the best restaurants are located here, especially if you’re look-
ing for a meal in a type of restaurant other than those you can find back
home. It also goes without saying that you get the best value for your
meal dollar or peso in Ciudad Cancún.

Living la vida local
For condo, home, and villa rentals as an alternative to hotel stays, check with Cancún
Hideaways, a company specializing in luxury properties, downtown apartments, and
condos — many offered at prices much lower than comparable hotel accommoda-
tions. Owner Maggie Rodriguez, a former resident of Cancún, has made this niche
market her specialty. You can preview her offerings at www.cancun-hideaways.
com.

Staying in Style
Each hotel listing includes specific rack rates for two people spending
one night in a standard room, double occupancy during high season
(Christmas–Easter), unless otherwise indicated. Rack rates simply mean
published rates and tend to be the highest rate paid — you can do
better, especially if you’re purchasing a package that includes airfare.
(See Chapter 7 for tips on avoiding paying rack rates.) The rack rate
prices quoted here include the 12 percent room tax — note that this tax
is 5 percent lower than in most other resorts in Mexico, where the stan-
dard tax is 17 percent. Please refer to the Introduction of this book for
an explanation of the price categories.
Hotels often double the normal rates during Christmas and Easter weeks,
but low-season rates can be anywhere from 20 to 60 percent below high-
season rates. Some rates may seem much higher than others, but many
of these higher rates are all-inclusive — meaning that your meals and bev-
erages are included in the price of your stay. All tips and taxes and most
activities and entertainment are also included in all-inclusive rates.
All hotels listed here have air-conditioning, unless otherwise indicated.
Parking is available at all island hotels.
Antillano
$
Ciudad Cancún
A quiet and very clean choice, the Antillano is close to the Ciudad Cancún
bus terminal. Rooms overlook either the main downtown street, Avenida
Tulum, the side streets, or the interior lawn and pool. Rooms facing the
lawn and pool are the most desirable because they are the quietest. Each
room has coordinated furnishings, one or two double beds, a sink area
separate from the bathroom, red-tile floors, and on-site laundry facilities.
A bonus: This inexpensive hotel provides guests the use of its beach club
on the island. To find Antillano from Avenida Tulum, walk west on Claveles
a half-block. Covered parking available.

The Bel Air Collection
$$$
Isla Cancún
After passing through Bel Air’s rather understated entrance, you feel like
you’ve somehow been transported to Miami’s South Beach. If you once
knew this hotel as Aristos Cancún Plaza Hotel, you’d be hard-pressed to
believe that they even salvaged the foundation as it’s that different. The
open courtyard of this hip design hotel is framed by flowing gauzy white
curtains, creating an undeniable romantic allure. The rooms reveal Art
Chapter 10: Settling into Cancún 109

Deco flair in all white, from the tile, cushy duvets, sheers, and furnishings,
offset with red-hot touches. The deluxe rooms comprise the majority of
the 156 rooms, but 19 suites or “Kool Lanais” feature private double
Jacuzzis and sitting area. All of the rooms feature a minifridge, TV, and
DVD, and many have balconies. The vibe couldn’t be further from the
mega-resorts lining the beach, with a small à la carte restaurant and bar,
and average-size infinity pool surrounded by bed loungers and chairs. For
those seeking a romantic escape, Bel Air offers a two-hour couples-only
spa treatment in your room or couples suite in spa complete with a hydro
cabin. While this hotel offers an all-inclusive meal plan, I think that in the
name of variety it’s best to opt for a room with only the breakfast plan and
branch out to other local dining options.

Blue Bay Getaway & Spa Cancún
$$$
Isla Cancún
Blue Bay is one of my favorite picks for couples or friends looking for an
action-packed all-inclusive resort for adults — no one under the age of 21
is allowed. That being said, the crowd bellying up to the Bikini Bar is decid-
edly younger and activities cater to this group, whether it’s a contest at
the “Sexy Pool,” water volleyball, or shakin’ it at the Disco. The prime loca-
tion makes this resort even more appealing, situated at the northern end
of the Hotel Zone, in close proximity to downtown and not far from the
Zone’s shopping plazas, restaurants, and nightlife. Blue Bay’s beach
extends calm waters for swimming, but contradictory to the name, the
color is not as turquoise as its southern counterparts. Hurricane Wilma
wrecked havoc here, which resulted in a complete renovation of all three
“phases” of the resort. New tile, furnishings, and linens throughout give
the resort a contemporary, more sophisticated edge. All rooms feature bal-
conies or terraces and everything in the room is included — unlike some
all-inclusives that charge additional fees for in-room amenities. Included
are all of your meals, served at any of the five restaurants, and libations,

Cancún INN Suites El Patio
$
Ciudad Cancún
A European-style guesthouse, Cancún INN Suites El Patio caters to travel-
ers looking for more of the area’s culture. Many guests at this small hotel
stay for up to a month and enjoy its combination of exceptional value and
warm hospitality within a homey atmosphere. You won’t find any bars,
pools, or loud parties in this place; what you do find is excellent service
and impeccable accommodations. Rooms face the plant-filled interior
courtyard, dotted with groupings of wrought-iron chairs and tables. Each
room has a slightly different décor and set of amenities, but all have white-
tile floors and rustic wood furnishings that exude old-world Mexico charm.
One room features a kitchenette, and the guesthouse also offers a common
kitchen area with purified water and a cooler for stocking your own sup-
plies. A small restaurant — actually closer to a dining room — serves
breakfast and dinner. The game and TV room has a large-screen cable TV,
a library stocked with books on Mexican culture, backgammon, cards, and
board games. The hotel offers special packages for lodging and Spanish
lessons and discounts for longer stays. Note: Bring a padlock for safe-
keeping of possessions in a lockable drawer.

The CasaMagna Marriott Cancún Resort
$$$$
Isla Cancún
The lobby’s sky-lit interior, with sweeping Romanesque arches and impos-
ing rod-iron chandeliers makes a dramatic first impression and distin-
guishes this Cancún property from many of the hotels within this price
category that are a part of the famous Marriott chain. The guest rooms
prove a little less distinctive, with contemporary furnishings, tiled floors,
and ceiling fans; most have balconies. All suites occupy corners and have
enormous terraces, ocean views, and flat-screen TVs in both the living
room and the bedroom. The CasaMagna Marriott offers five on-site restau-
rants from the famous Champions restaurant-slash-sports-bar to Mikado
serving Japanese and Thai flavors. The Lobby Bar Las Ventanas accom-
panies cocktails with live piano music. Many guests prefer their cocktails
served up with an umbrella, alongside the winding oceanfront pool. The
hotel is a bit more casual and undoubtedly cheaper than its sister resort
next door, JW Cancún Resort & Spa. The environment caters to family trav-
elers with specially priced packages. Up to two children can stay free with
parents, and participate in the Marriott Kids Club supervised children’s
program for $25 per day, which includes lunch.

Dreams Cancún Resort & Spa
$$$$$
Isla Cancún
Formerly the Camino Real Cancún, the all-inclusive Dreams Resort is
among the island’s most appealing places to stay, located on 1.5 hectares
(4 acres) right at the tip of Punta Cancún. The setting is sophisticated, in
shades of fuchsia, red, and orange, with blown glass and candle accents,
yet the hotel is very welcoming to children. The architecture of the hotel
is also contemporary and sleek, dominating the sky with strategic angles
and bringing the outside in with impressive interior atriums. Rooms in the
17-story Tower Section have extra services and amenities, including a pri-
vate lounge area, evening cocktails and hors d’ouvres, and a private
concierge. The Pyramid Section hosts ten huge two-story honeymoon
suites that overlook the casita, where many tie the knot, and the roaring
sea beyond. Almost all rooms have ocean views, as well as a balcony or
terrace, vivid color schemes, and marble and mosaic tile detailing. In addi-
tion to the oceanfront pool, Dreams has a private saltwater lagoon with
sea turtles and tropical fish. Dreams all-inclusive concept is more oriented
to quality experiences than unlimited buffets — your room price includes
gourmet meals, 24-hour room service, premium brand drinks, as well as
the use of all resort amenities, watersports, bicycles, evening entertain-
ment, airport transfers, and tips. The fitness center and newly expanded
spa is the focal point of the resort with ten treatment rooms and India-
inspired relaxation areas. For those with trouble disconnecting, there’s
also a 24-hour business center with Internet access. The hotel’s four bars
and four restaurants provide variety to the all-inclusive experience.
Dreams’s guests also receive free admission and drinks at the one of
Cancún’s best salsa dance clubs, Azucar, as well as special dining privi-
leges at popular Mexican restaurant, Paloma Bonita, located next to the
hotel — although additional charges apply at these establishments.

El Pueblito
$$$
Isla Cancún
El Pueblito looks like a traditional Mexican hacienda with the gracious,
hospitable service to match. Twenty-nine clusters of three- and four-story
buildings (no elevators) delightfully resemble various regions of Mexico
from San Miquel to Taxco and are situated in a V-shape down a gentle 
hillside toward the sea. A meandering swimming pool connected by water-
falls leads to a beachside, thatched-roof restaurant. Undergoing a com-
plete redesign after Hurricane Wilma as well as the changeover to an all-
inclusive concept in recent years has made this hotel more appealing than
ever before. Rooms are very large and have rattan furnishings, travertine
marble floors, large bathrooms, and either a balcony or terrace facing the
pool or sea. While this all may sound quite luxurious, the property proves
Part III: Discovering Cancún 
114

basic with the primary focus on providing an exceptional value, offering a
constant flow of buffet-style meals and snacks, a nightly theme party, and
entertainment. Kids will no doubt squeal at the sight of the big water slide,
and the array of activities in the comprehensive children’s program make
this place an ideal choice for young families. The hotel is located toward
the southern end of the island past the Hilton Resort.

El Rey del Caribe Hotel
$
Ciudad Cancún
This hotel, located in the center of downtown, is a unique oasis — an eco-
logical hotel, where every detail has been thought out to achieve the goal
of living in an organic and environmentally friendly manner. The whole
atmosphere of the place is one of warmth, which derives from the on-site
owners, who, caring as much as they do for Mother Earth, extend this sen-
timent to guests as well. You easily forget you’re in the midst of downtown
Cancún in the tropical jungle setting, with blooming orchids and other flow-
ering plants. A pool, hot tub, and the restaurant are surrounded by gardens
populated with statues of Maya deities — it’s a lovely, tranquil setting.
Rooms are large and sunny, and despite the ecofriendly motto, thankfully
all are air-conditioned. Attention to stylish décor is a little less diligent than
their dedication to chemical-free cleansing, which by the way must work
quite well because the accommodations (with either one king-size or two
double beds) proves tidy and livable. A few rooms also offer a kitchenette,
and three have a terrace. The detail of ecological sensitivity is truly impres-
sive, ranging from the use of collected rainwater to waste composting.
Recycling is encouraged and solar power used wherever possible — 
keeping it green and saving you a ton of it in the process. Transport to air-
port available for $29 for up to three persons.

Fiesta Americana Grand Aqua
$$$$$
Isla Cancún
Stunning, stylish, and sensual, Aqua is certain to emerge as one of
Cancún’s most coveted places to stay . . . again. It’s a sad story really; this
sparkling new resort festooned in all glass had just opened its doors when
Wilma decided that it should start from scratch. The resort rebuilt with a
vengeance and was on the brink of opening at press time, so I can’t com-
ment on service or the actual details of a stay; however, I anticipate a
strong comeback. Aqua aims to stimulate your five senses, and upon
arrival — under a crystal cube fountain — you’re offered a fusion tea, 
and a blend of relaxing and stimulating aromatherapy. The oasis of eight
Chapter 10: Settling into Cancún 115

oceanfront pools is surrounded by chaise longues, queen-size recliners,
or private cabanas. Rooms are generous in size, and all face the ocean and
have balconies. A very large bathroom features a large soaking tub and
organic bath products. Guests can tailor their turndown service by select-
ing from a pillow menu and choice of aromatherapy oils and candles. Mini-
Zen gardens or a fishbowl add unique touches to room décor, and
high-speed Internet access, flat-screen TVs, and CD/DVD players are stan-
dard. Twenty-nine rooms are “Grand Club,” which include continental
breakfast and a club room with butler service, snacks, bar service, and pri-
vate check-in. The 1,487-sq.-m (16,000-sq.-ft.) spa here is among the hotel’s
most notable attractions, with 12 treatment rooms. Another hallmark of
this hotel is certain to be its collection of restaurants, chief among them
SIETE, under the direction of premier Mexican chef and cookbook author,
Patricia Quintana.

Fiesta Americana Grand Coral Beach
$$$$
Isla Cancún
A spectacularly grand hotel, the AAA Five-Diamond all-suite Fiesta
Americana has one of the best locations in Cancún with its 300m (1,000 ft.)
of prime beachfront property and proximity to the main shopping and
entertainment centers — perfect for the traveler looking to be at the heart
of all that Cancún has to offer. The great Punta Cancún location (opposite
the convention center) has the advantage of facing the beach to the north,
meaning that the surf is calm and perfect for swimming. When it comes to
the hotel itself, the operative word here is big — everything at the Fiesta
Americana seems oversize, from the lobby to the rooms. The 198m-long
(660-ft.), multilevel swimming pool with cascading waterfalls and swim-up
bars borders the beach, where you will find a full watersports equipment-
rental service. Dining here is a highlight with an exquisite gourmet
Mediterranean restaurant, Basilique, along with two other more casual
dining options, plus four bars. If tennis is your game, this hotel has the
best facilities in Cancún. Three indoor tennis courts with stadium seating
are part of an extensive fitness center and spa. (Additionally, complimen-
tary greens fees are available to guests at the nearby Robert Trent Jones,
Jr.–designed, par 72, Pok-Ta-Pok golf course.)

Gran Melía Cancún Beach & Spa Resort
$$$
Isla Cancún
The resort is a landmark of sorts, known for its spectacular nine-story,
pyramid-shaped lobby atrium, with cascading waterfalls, bevy of palms,
and over 5,992 sq. m (64,500 sq. ft.) of interior garden space. Uniquely dot-
ting this interior space are three different spas. Wooden walkways lead to
the eco spa’s individual thatched roof massage huts suspended over
watery canals, with glass floors that allow one to peer at the fish below.
The YHI (pronounced “gee”) spa has a distinctively more Asian feel with
minimalist, geometric lines, bamboo accents, and advanced treatment
options. Every single room in the hotel has been completely renovated,
continuing the modern and minimalist feel throughout. Many offer an
ocean or lagoon view and relaxing balconies. The rooms on the lowest
floors prove larger, and an exclusive pyramid comprised of 137 rooms
extends Royal Service with private check-in lounges, private butler, and
even a pillow menu. For activities, there’s a three-par 9-hole golf course,
one lighted tennis court, two paddle tennis courts lit for night, and a fit-
ness center. Dining choices are also ample, with six restaurants to choose
from, as well as three bars and 24-hour room service. Wi-Fi Internet is more
affordable here than at many hotels, offering a rate for a 24-hour span used
in increments.

Hilton Cancún Beach & Golf Resort
$$$$
Isla Cancún
Grand, expansive, and fully equipped, this is a true resort in every sense
of the word. The omnipresent quality found throughout is the very reason
so many travelers are Hilton-brand loyalists — the on-site 18-hole, par-72
golf course, complete with brand-spanking-new Paspalum Bermuda grass
doesn’t hurt either. It’s one of only two hotels in Cancún with an on-site
course. (The other is Gran Melía Cancún, which features a 9-hole, three-
par course.) The Hilton Cancún is situated on 250 acres of prime Cancún
beachfront property, and the golf course located across the street extends
sea views from every hotel window. (Some have both sea and lagoon
views.) Like the sprawling resort, rooms are grandly spacious and immac-
ulately decorated in a minimalist style, with accent hues mimicking the
gradient colors of the sea in marine blue and turquoise. The seven inter-
connected pools with a swim-up bar, two lighted tennis courts, a large,
fully equipped gym, soccer field, and a beachfront watersports center
make the Hilton Cancún a good choice for those looking for an action-
packed stay. The Kids’ Iguana Club program is one of the best on the
island, creating Hilton loyalists for many years to come.

Hotel Margaritas

Ciudad Cancún
This four-story hotel (with elevator) in downtown Cancún is comfortable
and unpretentious. The bright and cheery lobby and street-facing restau-
rant in yellow and orange extends a cheery welcome into very standard
rooms lacking the Mexican charm of some of its downtown competitors.
Rooms have white tile floors, firm mattresses, a small balcony (no outdoor
chairs), and are exceptionally clean. The attractive pool is surrounded by
lounge chairs and has a wading section for children. The hotel offers com-
plimentary safes at the front desk and more services than most budget

Ciudad Cancún
The sound of birds chirping from elaborate cages fills the air as you
approach the thatched-roof front desk in the open-air lobby of this strate-
gically placed hotel in downtown Cancún. Murals and stone mosaics on
the walls fashion the hotel after a Maya temple, and while seemingly
“Disney-fied,” there’s strict attention to detail and the interior is welcom-
ing and clean from some of the downtown grime. Three floors of rooms
front a lovely palm-shaded pool area with comfortable tables and chairs as
well as a restaurant. There are 10 suites available that are larger in size
and 81 standard rooms with a queen-size or two double beds framed with
wrought-iron headboards, large tile bathrooms with separate sinks, and
writing desks. Throughout there are tiling and stone accents, giving more
charm to your standard bargain hotel. The on-site Spa at Nature Center
extends authentic therapies and unique treatments, such as photograph-
ing your aura or partaking in a Temazcal Aztecan Sweatlodge Ritual. The
hotel is close to many of the popular downtown restaurants between
Jazmines and Gladiolas, cater-cornered from Périco’s.

Hyatt Cancún Caribe

Isla Cancún
Hurricane Wilma should be named the patron saint of Hyatt Cancún,
because not only did the very small beach they were once located on grow
to become the largest plot of white sand on the strip, but also the hotel
underwent a nine-month renovation that birthed a beautiful new baby.
Rooms are divided into four separate buildings. The main seven-story
curved building hosts the majority of the hotel’s rooms decorated in subtle
shades of salmon and celadon green, marble and natural wood. The
Premium Tower and The Regency Club boast the most impressive suites
Part III: Discovering Cancún 
118

and ocean views — the guests also enjoy the premium amenities and addi-
tional services. The Beach Front rooms, true to their name, feature a
beachfront terrace directly off the expanded-room layout. The hotel built
a new Premier Pool with private beds, wet bar, and infinity edge. Rumor
has it that a new “spa tower” is in the works for 2008, complete with spe-
cialty programs and menus. At night, be sure not to miss the live jazz per-
formances in the Jazz Bar with windows overlooking Cancún’s skyline,
followed by high-end Cajun dining at Blue Bayou.

InterContinental Presidente Cancún
$$$$
Isla Cancún
On the island’s best beach, facing the placid Bahía de Mujeres, the
Presidente’s location is reason enough to stay here, and it’s just a two-
minute walk to Cancún’s public Pok-Ta-Pok Golf Club. Cool and spacious,
the lobby interior is dominated by a long, slate infinity fountain, and geo-
metric patterns of light reflect off the glistening marble floors from the
unique cutaway ceiling. At the far end of the lobby, the new Kih Lounge
Tequila Bar & Terraza lends an excellent view of the beach and expansive
pool accented with a pyramid-shaped waterfall and surrounded by cush-
ioned lounge chairs. Another new addition at Presidente is the convention
meeting space able to accommodate 450 people, making this location a
great choice for business or large family gatherings. All of the rooms are
clean and simple with contemporary Mexican pine furnishings and rustic,
gray marble floors. Wi-Fi Internet is available in all of the rooms with either
two double beds or one king-size bed. The sixth floor is the designated
Club Floor consisting of only 12 larger rooms that receive additional serv-
ices and upgraded amenities. A kids club schedules activities for children
ages 5 to 12, and the parents can then retreat to an adults-only pool for a
little rest and relaxation. In addition, the property has five Jacuzzis, a small
fitness center, and an area for watersports equipment rentals. The hotel
runs three restaurants, but seems to be most proud of the signature noo-
dles served up at their Italian venue, Alfredo Di Roma. Coming from
Cancún City, Presidente is on the left side of the street before you get to
Punta Cancún.

Chapter 10: Settling into Cancún 119

prime example of surpassing expectations, after Hurricane Wilma, JW
installed hurricane-resistant glass in all of their windows and framed them
with an almost indestructible steel. The rooms are what I like to call “high-
end standard,” with nothing earth-shattering in terms of design, but fea-
turing all of the best fabrics, furnishings, and toiletries. All of the rooms
have balconies, flat-screen televisions, and wireless Internet, and the suites
all come with a sofa bed, separate bedroom, and host stunning views. Club
91 is a “boutique” hotel within the hotel, offering more personalized serv-
ice, five meals a day, premium beverages, and four private balconies. For
all guests, three on-site restaurants serve meals throughout the day, and
drinks and snacks are also available at the Lobby Bar and Pool Bar. The
pool is one of the most impressive attributes of the property, meandering
free-form under bridges and walkways. Very exciting for aspiring scuba
divers is the on-site PADI certified training pool (the only one in Latin
America), 5m (18 ft.) deep and decorated with artificial coral, which really
helps in learning buoyancy. A full on-site training course can help you
become a PADI-certified diver during your stay. Of course, if you’d rather
just kick back and relax during your stay, JW’s award-winning, 3,252-sq.-m
(35,000-sq.-ft.) spa has signature Maya-inspired treatments to really soak
in the local culture, Marriott style.

Le Blanc Spa Resort
$$$$$
Isla Cancún
The all-inclusive Le Blanc Spa Resort opened their doors for the very first
time just weeks before Hurricane Wilma forced them to start over from a
“blanc” slate. It’s obvious that they didn’t skimp the second time around,
since they’re now touted by many as the best spa resort in the Hotel Zone.
Although you can spend $125 and get a day pass to enjoy the amenities
(spa charges additional), if you can afford the steep rates, the rooms won’t
disappoint. The white-washed décor is clean and contemporary, with ele-
gant yet edgy marble and glass accouterments. Comfort is not sacrificed
for style, employing high-count linens, multidirectional-shower heads, and
a pillow menu with infused options ranging from lavender to chamomile.
There are nine room categories, with most featuring an ocean view, and
step down from the king-size bed into a sitting area and balcony — all of
the rooms feature a double Jacuzzi tub and free flowing champagne for the
epitome of romance. Premium drinks are limitless, which obviously isn’t
the case with the age requirement to stay here, which is 21 and over. Euro
lounge tunes set the relaxed vibe around the infinity-edge pool with swim-
up pool bar, a smaller second-level pool, and the quieter lagoon pool.
There are four restaurant options, from the Mediterranean-inspired and
artfully designed Blancitalia to the distinctly Asian à la carte cuisine at
Blacorient, which lack a bit in overall culinary acumen in comparison to

some of the fine dining options in Cancún. There’s nightly entertainment
sans glitzy costumes and hokey performances. One night you may hear a
harpist during cocktails or acoustical guitar during lunch. High-end
touches step up the all-inclusive experience, like personalized yoga
instruction for no extra fee, and a butler available to tend to your whims.
The spa offers an extensive selections of treatments and prior to an
appointment guests are escorted through a ritual of hydro foot massage,
hot and cold plunge pools, steam, and sauna. Le Blanc also extends extra
amenities to newlyweds with proof of marriage within the last year.

Le Méridien Cancún Resort & Spa
$$$$$
Isla Cancún
Le Méridien has an elegantly casual style that makes you comfortable
enough to thoroughly relax. The hotel itself is smaller than others and feels
more like an upscale boutique hotel than an immense resort — a welcome
relief to those overstressed by activity at home. The décor throughout the
rooms and common areas is one of understated good taste — both classy
and comforting, not overdone. Rooms are generous in size, and most have
small balconies overlooking the pool with a view to the ocean. A very large
marble bathroom has a separate tub and a glassed-in shower. The hotel
attracts many Europeans and younger, sophisticated travelers, and is ideal
for a second honeymoon or romantic break. Certainly, a highlight of — or
even a reason for — staying here is time spent at the Spa del Mar, featur-
ing two levels and more than 1,394 sq. m (15,000 sq. ft.) of services dedi-
cated to your body and soul. A complete fitness center with extensive
cardio and weight machines is found on the upper level. The spa is located
below and comprised of a healthy snack bar, a full-service salon, and 14
treatment rooms, as well as separate men’s and women’s steam rooms,
saunas, whirlpools, cold plunge pools, inhalation rooms, tranquillity
rooms, lockers, and changing areas. Adjoining the spa is a large swimming
pool that cascades down three levels. Above the spa is a tennis center with
two championship tennis courts with lights. Watersports equipment is
available for rent on the beach. A bit of exercise may become a necessity
if you fully enjoy the gourmet restaurant, Aïoli, with its specialties based
on Mediterranean and Provençal cuisines (see review later in this chap-
ter). A supervised children’s program has its own Penguin Clubhouse, play
equipment, and a wading pool. Baby-sitting services are also available for
$12 per hour; after 10 p.m., add a $10 taxi charge.

Parador
$
Ciudad Cancún
The convenient location and rock-bottom prices make this otherwise non-
descript hotel among the most popular downtown hotels. Guest rooms,
located on one of three floors, are arranged around two long, narrow
garden courtyards leading back to a small pool (with an even smaller, sep-
arate children’s pool). The rooms are contemporary and basic, each with
two double beds and a shower. The hotel is almost at the corner of Uxmal.
Street parking is limited.

Radisson Hacienda Cancún
$$
Ciudad Cancún
The nicest hotel in downtown Cancún, the Hacienda Cancún is also one of
the very best values in the area, managed by Radisson. It offers all the
expected comforts of a chain like Radisson, yet in an atmosphere of
Mexican hospitality. Resembling a Mexican hacienda, rooms are set off
from a large rotunda-style lobby, lush gardens, and a pleasant pool area,
which has a separate wading section for children. All rooms have brightly
colored fabric accents; views of the garden, the pool, or the street; and a
small sitting area and balcony. Bathrooms have a combination tub and
shower. For the price, I found the extra in-room amenities of a coffeemaker,
safe, hair dryer, and iron to be nice extras. For even more extras, stay on
the Executive Floor, which enjoys a private check-in, concierge service,
and private Club Lounge. In addition to an on-site restaurant, the hotel
offers a snack bar and generally lively lobby bar, as well as a tennis court
and a small gym. Guests of the Hacienda may enjoy a complimentary shut-
tle service to Plaza Las Isla shopping center in the center of the Hotel Zone.
The hotel is located right behind the state government building and within
walking distance of downtown Cancún dining and shopping.

The Ritz-Carlton Cancún
$$$$$
Isla Cancún
The grand-scale Ritz-Carlton is the only beachfront resort in the world to
earn three AAA Five Diamond ratings by extending the ultimate in formal
service and opulence, even if it’s from the comfort of a sun lounger. The
décor — in public areas as well as guest rooms — is sumptuous and ornate
with thick carpets, elaborate chandeliers, and fresh flowers throughout.
The hotel fronts a 360m (1,200-ft.) white-sand beach, and all rooms over-
look the ocean, pool (heated during winter months), and tropical gardens.
Part III: Discovering Cancún 
122

In all rooms, marble bathrooms have telephones, separate tubs and show-
ers, and of course the finest toiletries. Ritz-Carlton Club floors offer guests
five minimeals a day, private butler service, and premium bath products.
The Club Grill, a fashionable English pub, and Fantino, serving
Mediterranean fine dining in a classical European ambience, are the only
two restaurants in Mexico holding the 2006 AAA Five Diamond Award.
Lobby Lounge is the original home of proper tequila tastings, featuring
one of the world’s most extensive menus of fine tequilas, Cuban cigars,
and a nightly ceviche bar. Sixteen white-draped casitas set on the beach
host romantic candlelit dinners under the stars, and two additional restau-
rants provide a variety of dining options. For true culinary aficionados,
Ritz added a new $25,000 Culinary Center with Viking Range equipment
and interactive cooking classes. In addition, Ritz serves up instruction on
their three lighted tennis courts with a newly implemented club operated
by legendary player and ESPN commentator Cliff Drysdale. After a chal-
lenging match, a visit to upgraded Kayantá Spa is a must, which offers an
excellent selection of Maya- and Mexican-inspired treatments and mas-
sages. The Ritz Kids program has supervised activities for children, and
baby-sitting services are also available. Special packages for golfing,
tennis, culinary, and spa getaways are definitely worth exploring.

Riu Palace Las Americas
$$$$
Isla Cancún
The all-inclusive Riu Palace is part of a family of Riu resorts in Cancún
known for their grand, opulent style. This one is the smallest of the three
in Cancún, and the most elegant (read: expensive). Its awe-inspiring pearl-
white Greco exterior dominates the skyline as if a beacon to one of the
most coveted pieces of real estate on the strip, close to shopping, dining,
bustling nightlife, and a mere five-minute walk to the Convention Center.
The décor is decidedly more European than many of the hotels in Cancún,
with crystal chandeliers, intricately carved dark wood, stained-glass sky-
lights, and Victorian-style furnishings. The rooms lack some of the refined
touches seen throughout the main areas and feel a little dated; however,
they include all of the essentials, with either two double beds or two
double beds pushed together to form a pseudo-king. Most host ocean or
lagoon views from a private balcony or terrace and have separate sitting
areas; 8 of the 32 suites also have an in-suite Jacuzzi. Full bottles of pre-
mium brand liquors and a full-stocked minifridge make most all-inclusive
resorts seem stingy by comparison. Two central pools overlook the ocean
and a wide stretch of beach, with one heated during winter months.
There’s also a solarium, fitness center, spa (extra charges apply), and a
host of sports and activities ranging from windsurfing to tennis. The hotel
has six restaurants and five bars, offering guests virtually 24 hours of all-
inclusive snacks, meals, and beverages. And, if that’s not enough, guests
have exchange privileges at the Riu Cancún next door, and the Riu Caribe

Sun Palace
$$$$
Isla Cancún
Located at the southern end of the island, the newly renovated “couples-
only” all-inclusive Sun Palace reopened its doors in December 2006. The
gleaming new facade radiates S.P.F. (Sun Palace Fantasia). The resort’s
suites feature modern Mexican décor, complete with double Jacuzzi, and
are beautifully appointed with new furniture. All rooms offer oceanview
balconies or terraces, and come with premium extras from a fully stocked
in-room liquor dispenser, minibar, and flat-screen LCD satellite TV to
Farouk bath amenities and cushy bathrobes, making you feel as if you’re
receiving all the five-star perks without paying five-star rates. In addition,
the resort offers three infinity pools, a swim-up bar, and an indoor pool
with two Jacuzzis, as well as a watersports marina, scuba diving demon-
stration, spa facilities, and fitness center. For dining, guests can choose
from one of four restaurants, hosting weekly theme parties, or order from
24-hour room service. One of the best perks to staying here are excursions
to Tulum, Chichén Itzá, Cobá, Isla Mujeres, or the Wet ’n Wild water park,
which are available through the Palace Passport Program and are included
in the all-inclusive rate. When you stay at any of the Palace Resorts prop-
erties, you are free to visit the other area Palace properties, and Cancún
Palace and Beach Palace are conveniently located within the Hotel Zone.

Westin Regina Cancún
$$$$
Isla Cancún
Westin Regina is great for anyone wanting the beauty of Cancún’s beaches
and a little distance between them and the more boisterous, flashy parts of
Cancún’s hotel strip. The strikingly austere but grand architectural style of
the Westin Regina is the stamp of leading Latin-American architect Ricardo
Legorreta. A series of five swimming pools front the recently expanded
beach, and a newly built seawall provides an added feeling of seclusion.
The décor in the main areas reveals clean lines and contemporary fur-
nishings, juxtaposed to the traditional stucco-style Mexican walls that make
the overall presence feel a little tired. The hotel is divided into two sections,
the main building and the more exclusive six-story tower section. Standard
rooms are unusually large, and the first-floor rooms have a dome ceiling
and terraces. The rooms on the sixth floor have balconies, and 120 rooms
in the tower are bigger and have ocean or lagoon views. Westin Work-Out
rooms are also available and feature an in-room treadmill or stationary bike,

medicine ball, exercise ball for core muscle training, and yoga and exercise
videos to play on the DVD. All rooms feature the signature “Heavenly Beds,”
and in 2006 this divinity in pampering was incorporated into the full-service
spa, expanding it to meet “Heavenly Spa” standards — offering Reebok
classes, yoga, Pilates, and a long list of body treatments. There are several
restaurant choices with the newest being the Sea & Stones seaside palapa
restaurant, serving dishes prepared over hot stones. All-inclusive plans are
available and prove convenient considering this hotel is a 15- to 20-minute
ride from the lively strip that lies between the Plaza Flamingo and Punta
Cancún. However, you can easily join the action when you’re so inclined —
buses stop in front, and taxis are readily available.

Dining Out
The restaurant scene in Cancún is populated in large part by U.S.-based
franchise chains, which need no introduction — Hard Rock Cafe, Planet
Hollywood, Rainforest Cafe, TGI Fridays, Ruth’s Chris Steak House,
Outback Steakhouse, and the usual fast-food burger places. And surpris-
ingly, contrary to the conventional travel wisdom, many of the best
restaurants in Cancún are located either in hotels or shopping malls. The
restaurants of the new Aqua Fiesta Americana (not yet opened at press
time) appeared to be especially promising, including one called “7,”
which is under the direction of renowned Mexican chef Patricia Quintana.
Most restaurants are located in the Hotel Zone in Isla Cancún, which is
logical because that’s where most of the tourists who dine out are stay-
ing. However, don’t dismiss the charms of dining in Ciudad Cancún
(Cancún City). You’re likely to find a great meal — at a fraction of the
price of an Isla Cancún eatery — accompanied by a dose of local color.
As in many of Mexico’s beach resorts, even the finest restaurants in town
can be comfortably casual when it comes to dress. Men rarely wear jack-
ets, although ladies are frequently seen in dressy resort wear — basically,
everything goes, attire-wise.
For those traveling with kids, Cancún has no shortage of options. 
From Johnny Rockets to McDonald’s, this destination has plenty of 
kid-friendly — and kid-familiar — places.
Prices in Cancún restaurants can cover an extended range, boosted by
shrimp and lobster dishes, which can top $20 for an entree. If you’re
watching your budget, even the higher-priced places generally have 
less-expensive options — you just need to avoid the premium seafood
dishes. Tips generally run about 15 percent of the bill, and most wait-
staff really depend upon tips for their income, so be generous if the serv-
ice warrants.
Chapter 10: Settling into Cancún 125

Cancún’s Best Restaurants
The restaurants listed here are either locally owned, one-of-a-kind restau-
rants or exceptional selections at area hotels. Many feature live music as
an accompaniment to the dining experience. I arrange the restaurants
alphabetically and note their locations and general price categories.
Refer to the Introduction of this book for an explanation of the price cate-
gories. Also see Chapter 17 for more information on Mexican cuisine.
Aïoli
$$$$
Isla Cancún
FRENCH
Aïoli, in Le Méridien Hotel, is a Provençal restaurant that offers exquisite
French and Mediterranean gourmet specialties in a warm and cozy coun-
try French setting. Although it offers perhaps the best breakfast buffet in
Cancún (for $20), most visitors outside the hotel come only for dinner,
where low lighting and superb service make for a romantic evening.
Starters include traditional pâtés and delightful escargots served in the
shell with a white-wine and herb-butter sauce. A specialty is duck breast
served in a honey and lavender sauce. Equally scrumptious is the rack of
lamb, prepared in a Moroccan style and served with couscous. Pan-seared
grouper is topped with a paste of black olives, crushed potato, and tomato,
and the bouillabaisse is laden with an exceptional array of seafood.
Desserts are decadent in true French style, including the signature Fifth
Element, a sinfully delicious dish rich with chocolate. For the quality and
the originality of the cuisine, coupled with the excellence in service, Aïoli
gets my vote for a great fine-dining value in Cancún.

$$$$
Isla Cancún
CAJUN
You may not associate Cancún with Cajun dining, but this restaurant
receives plenty of raves — not to mention repeat diners. Crawfish are
flown in daily from Louisiana, and the signature Maya blackened seafood
platter is a favorite, combining the Caribbean with the Cajun’s best. The
restaurant serves certified Angus beef, and the Rib-eye with Green
Goddess sauce is excellent. The five-tiered, white-linen setting is truly
remarkable. The lowest “grotto” level proves ideal for candlelit romance
amid a lush hanging garden, bubbling brook, and waterfall streaming down
an intricately carved column. Adding to the ambience is live jazz, played
nightly at the connecting Cassis Jazz Bar with circular windows overlook-
ing the lagoon and downtown Cancún.

Buenos Aires Grill
$$$
Ciudad Cancún
ARGENTINEAN/STEAK/SEAFOOD
I love to discover hidden culinary gems and this is by far one of my
favorites. The very authentic Argentinean fare tastes as if it came right
from the traditional asado oven and is served up in the same fashion with
mounds of meat, fish, and chicken on a hot grill at the table. The décor is
chic and modern, incorporating bona fide Buenos Aires touches, from sexy
tango music and a TV playing Argentinean shows to the signed soccer
jersey and art hanging on the walls. The open kitchen in the back serves
up delectable varieties of certified Angus beef — you can’t go wrong with
the bife de costilla rib-eye for two or the empanada de carne. The papas
fritas provenzal (fries topped with garlic and parsley) and ridiculously
fresh chimichurri (an olive oil and herb dipping sauce) make this little
eatery found at the back of the new Plaza Nayandéi next to Plaza de Toros
(the bullring) worth the trip alone. The wine list is impressive with some
of Argentina’s finest labels. Make a toast to spending half the price you’d
pay in the Hotel Zone for a meal this good!

Isla Cancún
INTERNATIONAL/SEAFOOD
Captain’s Cove’s multilevel dining room is a draw for diners who come for
the good value, heaping servings, friendly service, and the consummate
tropical ambience. Diners face big, open windows overlooking the lagoon
and Royal Yacht Club Marina. (Sunsets from the upper-level deck are stun-
ning.) For breakfast, an extremely popular all-you-can-eat buffet beats the
price and quality of most hotel offerings. The Angus steak and the seafood
dishes (the Islander coconut shrimp is a standout) are top bets at lunch
and dinner, and a menu catering to children is available. Dessert stand-
outs include flaming coffees, crêpes, and Key lime pie. Captain’s Cove sits
almost at the end of Blvd. Kukulkán, on the lagoon side opposite the Omni
Hotel.

begin the moment you enter the anteroom, with its comfortable couches
and chairs and selection of fine tequilas and martinis. The scene continues
into a candlelit dining room with padded side chairs and tables that shim-
mer with silver and crystal. Elegant plates of peppered scallops, truffles,
and potatoes in tequila sauce; grilled lamb; or mixed grill arrive at a
leisurely pace after the appetizer. The restaurant has both smoking and
nonsmoking sections. After dinner, take a turn on the dance floor in the
adjacent lounge, as a band plays romantic rhythms starting at 8 p.m. The
Club Grill is the place for that truly special night out. A dress code is
enforced: No sandals or tennis shoes, and gentlemen must wear long pants.

El Fish Fritanga
$
Isla Cancún
SEAFOOD/MEXICAN
A chef from a five-star restaurant told me about the incredible fish tacos
at this secret little spot. While the sign for this pescadillas (fish tacos)
palace is big enough, it somehow blends into the Domino’s Pizza fronting
Blvd. Kukulkán. El Fish Fritanga can only be reached by going down the
stairs between the buildings to a wonderful little plot of sandy beach
below. The plastic tables and chairs are filled with locals who know they
can get tasty seafood cocktails, fish and shrimp tacos, and fish filets for
literally a fraction of the price served at restaurants along the strip. The
owner, David Aguilar Osorio, got his hands on his grandma’s recipes and
decided to start a place where the locals could eat affordably in this
tourist-laden part of Cancún. It became such a popular spot that he
expanded the size and developed a dinner menu, making this not only a
great place for lunch, but dinner, too.

El Pescador
$$
Ciudad Cancún
SEAFOOD
El Pescador prides itself as one of the best restaurants for fresh seafood
in El Centro — just ask the apron-clad guys standing at the entrance, talk-
ing up the menu to passersby, on this popular downtown pedestrian
street. While a lot of the hustling of neighboring restaurants promising free
cocktails with your meal can be ignored, El Pescador consistently deliv-
ers good seafood; attesting to this is the line that often forms here for 
a table on the street-side patio or the upstairs venue. Feast on shrimp
cocktail, conch, octopus, camarones à la criolla (Creole-style shrimp), and
charcoal-broiled lobster. Can’t decide? Try a little of everything with the
Zarzuela combination seafood plate, cooked in white wine and garlic. El
Pescador also features a Mexican specialty menu.

El Rincón del Vino
$$
Ciudad Cancún
WINE BAR / INTERNATIONAL / TAPAS
The first wine bar in all of Cancún was the inspiration of owner Leda
Gamboa, who loved wine and often had friends over to uncork and unwind
over good food. It was getting to be quite the expensive pastime, so she
paired up with friend Alejandro Acevedo and decided to make a living
extending “friendly gatherings.” The thatched-roof palapa terrace,
accented with twinkling white lights and soft live music, creates the ulti-
mate romantic setting to share good wine and an array of delectable appe-
tizers. The all-white, über-chic, and air-conditioned interior displays
original paintings on stretched canvas and comfortable white couches for
lounging. Watching the owner warmly greet famous Cancún restaurateurs
and well-dressed Mexican socialites, it’s immediately apparent that this
place is no secret among the “in” crowd. However, the scene is hardly pre-
tentious, and as Leda Gamboa so eloquently put it, “We don’t try to pre-
tend here. Good wine is what you like.” And there are plenty of choices,
with wines ranging from California classics like Silver Oak and J. Lohr to an
incredible selection of burgeoning wines from Mexico — the majority of
the wines on the list costing around $30. (Live music 9:30–11:30 p.m.
Tues–Sat.)

Labná

Ciudad Cancún
YUCATECAN
To steep yourself in Yucatecan cuisine and music, head directly to this show-
case of Maya moods and regional foods. The interior’s dramatically high
step ceiling is covered in jute fabric, to make you feel as if you are dining
inside a Maya pyramid. Specialties served here include a sublime lime soup,
poc chuc (marinated, barbecue-style pork), chicken or pork pibil (sweet and
spicy barbecue sauce served over shredded meat), and appetizers such as
papadzules (tortillas stuffed with boiled eggs in a green pumpkin sauce).
Some nights these specialties are served buffet-style or if ordering à la carte,
you can try The Labná Special, a sampler of four typically Yucatecan main
courses, to get a taste of the traditional. The refreshing Yucatecan bever-
age, Agua de Chaya, is also served here, a blend of sweetened water and the
leaf of the Chaya plant, abundant in the area, to which D’Aristi liquor can be
added for an extra kick. Thursdays through Saturdays, follow your meal with
a live musical performance by popular Maya artists.

La Casa de las Margaritas
$$
Isla Cancún
MEXICAN
La Casa de las Margaritas’ (meaning “the house of the daisies”) vibrant
yellow exterior sets the cheery tone for this hacienda-style restaurant
serving Mexican specialties. Mariachi and marimba music, seemingly lim-
itless staff in traditional garb, and authentic crafts on the walls add char-
acter to a space that can host busloads of travelers . . . at the same time.
Popular menu choices include Margarita shrimp in a garlic, crème, and
chipotle chile sauce, prepared tableside with flair; morita beef filet (two
beef medallions served with goat cheese and spinach and marinated with
green tomato and morita pepper sauce); or chicken enchiladas topped with
a tomato and sun-dried pepper sauce. You can even try your hand at
preparing these Mexican specialties yourself by reserving a spot in the
cooking lessons and tequila tastings offered every Tuesday and Thursday
from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. (Reserve two days in advance.)

La Destileria
$$$
Isla Cancún
MEXICAN
If you want to experience tequila in its native habitat, don’t miss this 
place — although technically, this restaurant is across the country from
the region where the beverage is produced. La Destileria is more than a
tequila-inspired restaurant, it’s a mini-museum that honors the “spirit” of
Mexico with colorful murals, authentic pieces of equipment used in distil-
lation, and information compiled by museum specialists from the Mexican
Institute of Anthropology and History. Over 150 brands of tequila are
served here, including some true treasures that never make their way
across the country’s northern border — so be adventurous! If you’re not
a fan of sipping the liquid gold straight up, the margaritas are among the
best on the island. When you decide it’s time to pair some food with your
tequila, choose from dishes on the contemporary Mexican menu, ranging
from quesadillas with zucchini flowers and beef tenderloin medallions
bathed in three types of chile peppers, to shrimp in a delicate tequila-lime
sauce. If you’re lucky enough to be there while in season (not to mention
adventurous enough — or your squeamishness has been diminished by
tequila), try the escamoles (crisp-fried ant eggs) or gusano de maguey
(worms found in the mescal plant sautéed with garlic and olive oil) as an
appetizer!

La Dolce Vita
$$$
Isla Cancún and Ciudad Cancún
ITALIAN/SEAFOOD
The casually elegant La Dolce Vita is known as Cancún’s favorite Italian
restaurant. The owners closed the downtown location after the opening
of their polished new location on the lagoon in the Hotel Zone, but locals
clamored for the return of “the sweet life” (the meaning of La Dolce Vita in
Italian), and it reopened the downtown locale a few years later. Both loca-
tions serve delectable homemade pastas, fresh seafood, and hearty yet
refined meat courses. While dining on the Hotel Zone’s open-air terrace or
in air-conditioned comfort from a room with a stunning view of the sunset
can’t be beat, I prefer the charm of the downtown restaurant with its
garden atrium, intimate ambience, and incredibly attentive staff — not to
mention cheaper prices for the same high-quality dishes. But along with a
bit higher tab, comes entertainment at the Kukulkán locale, where dinner
is accompanied by live jazz from 7 to 11 p.m., Monday through Saturday.

Laguna Grill
$$$
Isla Cancún
FUSION
Laguna Grill offers diners a contemporary culinary experience in a lush,
tropical setting overlooking the lagoon. Enjoy a sunset cocktail at the adja-
cent Trágara bar overlooking the lagoon and small marina. Comfy
Victorian-style couches add an eclectic edge to the contemporary white
stucco and mosaic walls. Tableside air conditioners and imposing ceiling
fans throughout keep this open-air palapa-style restaurant cool even in
unbearably hot weather. A stone waterfall at the back of the restaurant
flows into a small creek that meanders through the restaurant set with
tables made from the trunks of regional, tropical trees. And the restaurant
goes out on a limb to develop unique Pacific-rim fare fused with regional
flavors. Fish and seafood dominate the menu of entrees, in a variety of
preparations that combine Asian and Mexican accents such as ginger,
cilantro, garlic, and hoisen sauce. In fact, the owner is an avid fisherman
and often brings back premium catches of the day to put on the menu.
Laguna Grill’s chef will also prepare a whopper you’ve reeled in during a
deep-sea fishing outing — the perfect ending to any fish tale! For beef-
lovers, the rib-eye steak served over garlic, spinach, and sweet potato
mash is sublime, and desserts are as creative as the main dishes. If you’re
an early diner, request a table on the outside deck for a spectacular sunset
view. An impressive selection of wines is available.

SEAFOOD/CARIBBEAN/MEXICAN
Enjoy some of downtown Cancún’s finest food as you dine alfresco in this
romantic garden setting. Stone facades and Maya stelas (carved standing
stones) surround the pink-and-white linen tables situated on the pebbly,
vine-draped patio. Stars twinkling overhead blend with the small white
lights in the trees and soft music plays in the background. Try habichuela
(string bean) soup; shrimp in any number of sauces, including Jamaican
tamarind, tequila, and a ginger-and-mushroom combination; and the Maya
coffee with xtabentun (a strong, sweet, anise-based liquor) poured with
theatrical flair. The grilled seafood and steaks are excellent, and La
Habichuela is also a good place to try a Mexican specialty such as chicken
mole or tampiqueña-style beef (thinly sliced, marinated, and grilled). A
more unusual — sweet and divine — choice is the restaurant’s signature
dish, Cocobichuela, lobster and shrimp in curry sauce served in a coconut
shell and topped with fruit.

La Joya (the jewel) is truly a gem of a dining experience, with a menu of
gourmet Mexican cuisine in a suitably upscale atmosphere. For starters,
try the lobster quesadillas, made with Chihuahua cheese and a traditional
tortilla soup. Main dishes range from fish filet Veracruz style (served with
tomatoes, capers, olives, pepper, and white-wine sauce) to rack of lamb
La Joya, prepared with a touch of chile pepper. Entertaining touches
include performances by the Mexican Ballet on Tuesdays, Thursdays,
Fridays, and Saturdays at 7:30 p.m., as well as live Mexican music every
night. This restaurant was Mexico’s first to earn the Five Diamond Award

La Madonna

Isla Cancún
ITALIAN / SWISS GRILL
Even though it’s located in the La Isla Shopping Village, this restaurant is
far from a run-of-the-mill mall eatery. The décor’s massive proportions
make a big statement, from the awe-inspiring 12m (40-ft.) ceiling and the
monolithic Greek statues that span the full length, to the gigantic Mona
Lisa painting revealing the same knowing smile — here, it’s no doubt
related to how one may feel in the morning after indulging in the spirits
on the five-page martini menu. With all of this Las Vegas–esque opulence
one would think the dishes would somehow be overpowered. However,
Part III: Discovering Cancún 
134

the solid culinary background of Switzerland-born owner and manager and
the commitment to quality ingredients ensure that the dishes take center
stage. Italian delicacies with Swiss accents incorporate the freshest local
ingredients, for a delightful mix of flavors. The fried flower zucchini appe-
tizer followed by fettuccini with shrimp in grappa sauce or a flambé pre-
pared tableside will not disappoint. The Tuscani charcoal grill cooks beef
imported from Louisville, Kentucky, to perfection and locks in succulent
flavor. Many people also drop in to simply enjoy the casual elegance while
sipping a cocktail on the upper Mezzanine level or on the outdoor terrace.

MEXICAN
Since 1975, one could find mariachi men strumming their guitars and shak-
ing their maracas in this lively open-air atmosphere. Vacationers sporting
a sombrero for a photo op and Mexican families celebrating birthdays
coincide at this downtown restaurant staple. Stained glass, Mexican tile,
and brick combine to create the TGI Friday’s–meets-Mexico flair. Meat
roasting rotisserie style at the front of the restaurant adds the authentic-
ity of a taqueria (Mexican taco stand); from this hot spindle, succulent
pastor (marinated pork) is shaved off in chunks and added to tacos, a dish
difficult to find in the United States because the recipe is said to be an
ancient Mexican secret. Whether it’s skirt steak from the charcoal grill,
Maya cuisine, or a traditional Mexican favorite like enchiladas washed
down with a huge margarita, the food is good, plentiful, affordable, and fun
for the whole family.

Lorenzillo’s
$$–$$$
Isla Cancún
SEAFOOD
This restaurant, suspended over the lagoon waters like an island unto
itself, is a destination within a destination for any self-respecting seafood
lover. While the sign says, SINCE 1683, don’t assume that the city of Cancún
was built around the restaurant (although it could have been); it’s based
on a legend of a pirate named Lorenzillo who pillaged and plundered in
efforts to find a good meal. While dining here isn’t exactly a steal, live lob-
ster is the overwhelming favorite, and part of the appeal is the chance to
select your dinner out of the giant lobster tank. The most romantic tables
are on the sunset terrace or along the window of the two-story thatched-
roof building. In addition to the lobster — it comes grilled, steamed, or
stuffed — good bets are the shrimp stuffed with cheese and wrapped in
bacon, the admiral’s filet coated in toasted almonds and a light mustard
sauce, or the seafood-stuffed squid. The atmosphere is festive and friendly,
and children are very welcome.

Across the street from Plaza Caracol, this palapa-style restaurant literally
sits on the water’s edge. Waves crash against the stone wall below
Mocambo’s terrace, serving as percussion for musicians strolling through-
out the restaurant. After dark, the view of the twinkling lights from neigh-
boring Isla Mujeres adds a romantic backdrop to this breezy open-air
setting. Beware: Breezy can turn to downright blustery on windier days, so
pick a calm evening to whisper sweet nothings. Reasonably priced fresh
seafood is the restaurant’s specialty, served up with big portions of lob-
ster, shrimp, and shellfish. Try Mocambo shrimp in a white-cream sauce
with sweet peppers or the whopping 10-oz. lobster in tequila sauce. The
lunch buffet runs from 1 to 5 p.m. Monday through Thursday, and there is
also a kids’ menu complete with popcorn shrimp and fish fingers. Despite
the cartoon lobster mascot donning a chef’s hat, the ambience at night is
casually elegant.

If you want a healthy reprieve from an overindulgent night — or if you just
like your meals as fresh and natural as possible — this restaurant is your
oasis. No matter what your dining preference, you owe it to yourself to try
a true Mexican tradition, the fresh fruit liquado (lee-qwa-doe) — a blended
drink that combines fresh fruit, ice, and either water or milk. (Think
combos of mango and milk, or mango and watermelon, juiced in an icy tall
glass.) Of course, other creative combinations mix in yogurt, granola, or
other goodies. But 100% Natural has more than just drinks — the restau-
rant offers a bountiful selection of basic Mexican fare and terrific sand-
wiches served on whole-grain breads. (Look for numerous vegetarian
options, too.) Breakfast here is a delight, as well as a good value. The
atmosphere is abundant with plants and bright colors. The restaurant has
two locations, one in the Hotel Zone and one downtown.

CONTEMPORARY MEXICAN
Across the street from Dreams hotel on the elbow of Isla Cancún, Paloma
Bonita is no secret to hotel guests at Dreams that can bill the meal directly
to their rooms. If you’re staying elsewhere you may miss it, as the view of
this restaurant’s delightful yellow facade is restricted from the Blvd.
Kukulkán by towering neighbor, Fiesta Americana Grand Coral. The exte-
rior looks like the mansion of a Mexican diplomat, but the moment you
step inside, it feels more like a small village with different sections reflec-
tive of various regions. Your tour begins in the circular bar, “el Tequilero,”
prominently positioned in the middle of La Cantina Jalisco section, which
serves over 100 different types of tequila. Cantina means kitchen in
Spanish, and this area displays kitchen tools and a front-row seat to seeing
tortillas being made by hand. If you can’t take the heat, get out of the cantina
and land a table on Patio Oaxaca, a more intimate space with a stone foun-
tain and arches, not to mention an oceanfront view. Salon Michoacán is the
biggest room, decorated with colorful furniture and crafts reflective of the
western Mexican state’s Pazcuaro heritage. Lively marimba and jarocho
music liven up the atmosphere — be prepared to be serenaded or asked
for a little samba between the tables. The personalized yet professional
service and authentic dishes make this one of the best places in Cancún
for Mexican cuisine in the Hotel Zone.

With colorful murals that almost dance off the walls, a bar area overhung

saddles for bar stools, Périco’s isn’t exactly your run-of-the-mill eatery.
While the waiters dressed like Pancho Villa may seem a little over-the-top
touristy, travelers love coming here for their fill of fun. The food, well, that’s
secondary even though the extensive menu offers well-prepared steak,
seafood, and traditional Mexican dishes for moderate rates. Périco’s is a
place not only to eat and drink, but also to let loose and join in the boom-
ing festivity. Don’t be surprised if everybody drops their forks, dons huge
Mexican sombreros, and snakes around the dining room in a conga dance.
People-watching is half the fun; so if you’re looking for a place to gaze
romantically into each other’s eyes, look elsewhere. There’s marimba music
from 7 to 9 p.m. and mariachis from 9:30 p.m. to midnight. Expect a crowd.

However, we would be remiss not to mention this popular clapboard
restaurant overlooking Nichupté Lagoon, serving elegant Caribbean fare.
The décor combines island-style colonial charm with elegant touches of
wood and crystal. The service is excellent, but the food is only mediocre,
especially considering the price. For starters, try the signature poached
shrimp with lemon juice and olive oil or a creamy crabmeat soup. Move on
to the main event, which may consist of veal Wellington in puff pastry with
duck pâté, fish filet crusted in spices and herbs and topped with vanilla
sauce, or lobster medallions in mango sauce. Flambéed desserts are a spe-
cialty, and the Plantation House has one of the most extensive wine lists
in town. Plantation House is generally quite crowded, which makes it a bit
loud for a truly romantic evening.

The front-runner when asking people their favorite place to eat, newcomer
Puerto Madero attracts both locals and tourists in droves for gluttonous
enjoyment — prime cuts of enormous steaks served on a hot grill at the

varietals from all over the world. A deep and fruity Malbec from Argentina
is the perfect pairing with many of the meaty morsels, and what better way
to mark the occasion in a place modeled after the Buenos Aires restaurant
with the same moniker? The architecture emulates a 20th-century dock
warehouse. Dark, rich wood and red brick create a warm yet refined atmos-

Formerly called Thai Lounge, this restaurant transports one from the
lagoon in Cancún to the riverbanks of Bangkok. A series of wooden walk-

Dim lights and lounge rhythms create a hip ambience that’s surprisingly
authentic, with many Thai staff members. Five of the pagodas feature a
chaise longue bed and separate table for dining. Request #5 or #7, if plan-
ning a romantic evening, and #20 is also a prize pagoda with steps leading
up to a private second-floor that seats four people. The owner of Thai is
also the director at the adjacent Aquarium, so he created a window from
the restaurant that is actually the side of the dolphin aquarium. Diners at
privy tables can watch dolphins frolicking about while munching on tasty
mahimahi. Classic Thai specialties like the Tom Kha Gai soup made of
coconut, chile, and lemon grass, as well as chicken and beef skewers are
incredible. For the main course, Pet Som Ros, a duck breast with mango
and fried basil, and Undamun crispy fish filet with a tamarind chile sauce
prove to be popular choices. Remember that here, spicy means “firey,” so
order conservatively. Reservations are made for two-hour seatings,
because with a setting so inviting, it would be easy to stay all night.

SANDWICH SHOP
Long lunchtime lines testify to locals’ affinity for the sandwiches and soups
served at the four Ty-Coz sandwich shop locations. The downtown restau-
rant behind the Commercial Mexicana and across from the bus station on
Avenida Tulum proves to be the nicest and most popular. The menu over-
the-counter is conveniently posted in English and Spanish and lists delec-
table selections served on soft yet crispy French bread and gigantic
croissants, all baked fresh daily. Granite tabletops and rod iron chairs emu-
late French bistro styling. The portions put the American quarter-pounder
to shame, overstuffed with ham, tuna, or chicken, as well as vegetarian
selections. The other convenient locale for tourists is in the Hotel Zone
across the street from InterContinental Presidente Hotel and is simply a
snack-shop window.

American Express
The local office is located in Ciudad
Cancún at Avenida Tulum 208 (% 998-881-
4000 or 998-884-6942; www.american
express.com/mexico). The office is
open Monday to Friday 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. and
Saturday 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Another branch is
located in the Hotel Zone, in the La Isla
Shopping Center, % 998-885-3905.
Area Code
The telephone area code is 988.
Baby Sitters
Most of the larger hotels can easily
arrange for baby sitters, but many sitters
speak limited English. Rates range from $3
to $10 per hour.
Banks, ATMs, and Currency Exchange
Most banks are downtown along Avenida
Tulum and are usually open Monday to
Friday 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., and many now
have automatic teller machines for after-
hours cash withdrawals. In the Hotel Zone,
you can find banks in the Plaza Kukulkán
and next to the convention center. Many
casas de cambio (exchange houses) are in
the Hotel Zone, in the plazas, and near the
convention center. Avoid changing money
at the airport as you arrive, especially at
the first exchange booth you see — its
rates are less favorable than any in town
or others farther inside the airport con-
course. In general, the best exchange
rates are found at ATMs, casas de cambio,
and hotels.
Business Hours
Most downtown offices maintain tradi-
tional Mexican hours of operation (9 a.m.–
2 p.m. and 4–8 p.m., daily), but shops
remain open throughout the day from 
10 a.m. to 9 or 10 p.m. Offices tend to close
on Saturday and Sunday, but shops are
open on Saturday, at least, and increas-
ingly offer limited hours of operation on
Sunday. Malls are generally open from 
10 a.m. to 10 p.m. or later.
Climate
It’s hot but not overwhelmingly humid. The
rainy season is May through October.
August through October is the hurricane
season, which brings erratic weather.
November through February is generally
sunny but can also be cloudy, windy,
somewhat rainy, and even cool, so a
sweater and rain protection are handy.
Consular Agents
The U.S. consular agent is located in the
Playa Caracol 2, 3rd level, rooms 320–323,
Blvd. Kukulkán, km 8.5 (% 998-883-0272).
The office is open Monday to Friday 9 a.m.
to 2 p.m. The Canadian consulate is
located in the Plaza Caracol 2, 3rd level,
room 330, Blvd. Kukulkán, km 8.5 (% 998-
883-3360). The office is open from Monday
to Friday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The United
Kingdom has a consular office in Cancún
(% 998/881-0100, ext. 65898; fax 998/848-
8662; information@britishconsulate
cancun.com). Irish, Australian, and New
Zealand citizens should contact their
embassies in Mexico City.
Emergencies/Hospitals
To report an emergency, dial % 060,
which is supposed to be similar to 911
emergency service in the United States.
For first aid, the Cruz Roja (Red Cross; 
% 065 or 998-884-1616) is open 24 hours 
a day on Avenida Yaxchilán between
avenidas Xcaret and Labná, next to the
Telmex building. Total Assist, a small, nine-
room emergency hospital with English-
speaking doctors (Claveles 5, Sm. 22, at
Avenida Tulum; % 998-884-1092 or

884-1058; totalassist@prodigy.net.mx) is
also open 24 hours. American Express,
MasterCard, and Visa are accepted. Desk
staff may have a limited command of
English. Another facility that caters to
English-speaking visitors is Ameri-Med
(Plaza Las Americas, in downtown Cancún,
% 998-881-3434) with 24-hour emergency
service. An air ambulance service is also
available by calling % 800-305-9400 (toll-
free within Mexico). Urgencias means
“emergencies.”
Information
The State Tourism Office (% 998-881-9000)
is centrally located downtown on the east
side of Avenida Pecari 23, next to Banco
Bancomer, immediately left of the
Ayuntamiento Benito Juárez building. The
office is open Monday to Friday 9 a.m. to 
5 p.m., and it has maps, brochures, and
information on the area’s popular sights,
including Tulum, Xcaret, Isla Mujeres, and
Playa del Carmen. A second tourist infor-
mation office, the Convention and Visitors
Bureau (% 998-881-9000), is located on the
first floor of the Cancún Convention Center
in the Hotel Zone and is open Monday to
Friday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Hotels and their rates
are listed at each office, as are ferry sched-
ules. For information prior to your arrival in
Cancún, visit the Convention Bureau’s Web
site at www.cancun.info.
Pick up copies of the free monthly Cancún
Tips or the Cancún Tips booklet, which is
published four times a year. Both contain
lots of useful information and great maps.
The publications are owned by the same
people who own the Captain’s Cove restau-
rants, a couple of sightseeing boats, and
timeshare hotels, so the information, though
good, is not unbiased.
Internet Access
C@ncunet (% 998-885-0880), located in a
kiosk on the first floor of Plaza Kukulkán
(Blvd. Kukulkán, km 13), offers Internet
access for 20 pesos per ten minutes or 70
pesos per hour from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Also,
across the street (Blvd. Kukulkán, km 12.7),
La Casa Del Habano allows all of their
patrons complimentary use of the Internet
on their computer or by tapping into their
wireless network using your laptop, as well
as making international calls for free, from
a shared cordless phone.
Maps
One of the best around is the free American
Express map, usually found at the tourist
information offices and the local American
Express office. Cancún Tips (see “Infor-
mation”) also has maps and is generally
available through your hotel concierge.
Another map that is exceptional is from
Can-Do Graphic Travel Guides, which 
contains 8 maps in one portable kit for $8.
www.cancunmap.com.
Pharmacy
With locations in both Flamingo Plaza 
(% 998-885-1351) and Kukulkán Plaza 
(% 998-885-0860), Farmacia Roxanna’s
offers delivery service within the Hotel
Zone. There are several drugstores in the
major shopping malls in the Hotel Zone
which are open until 10 p.m. IIn downtown
Cancún, Farmacia Cancún is located at
Ave. Tulum, % 998-884-1283.
Police
To reach the police (seguridad pública), dial
% 998-884-1913 or 998-885-2277.

downtown at the intersection of avenidas
Sunyaxchen and Xel-Ha. It’s open Monday
to Friday 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. and Saturday 
9 a.m. to 1 p.m.
Chapter 10: Settling into Cancún 141

Safety
Cancún has very little crime. Tourist areas
are generally safe late at night; just use
common sense. As at any beach resort,
don’t take money or valuables to the beach.
Car break-ins are about the only crimes
here, although they do happen frequently,
especially around the shopping centers in
the Hotel Zone.
Swimming on the Caribbean side presents a
danger from undertow. Pay attention to the
posted flag warnings on the beaches.
Taxes
There’s a 10 percent value-added tax (IVA)
on goods and services, and it’s generally
included in the posted price. Cancún’s IVA
is 5 percent lower than most of Mexico due
to a special exemption that dates back to its
origins as a duty-free port.
Taxis
Taxi prices in Cancún are set by zone,
although keeping track of what’s in which
zone can take some work. Taxi rates within
the Hotel Zone are a minimum fare of $5 per
ride, making it one of the most expensive
taxi areas in Mexico. Rates within the
downtown area are between $1.50 and $2.
You can also hire taxis by the hour or day
for longer trips, when you’d prefer to leave
the driving to someone else. Rates run
between $12 and $18 per hour with dis-
counts available for full-day rates, but an
extra charge applies when the driver dou-
bles as a tour guide. Always settle on a
price in advance or check at your hotel,
where destinations and prices are gener-
ally posted.
Telephone
Avoid the phone booths that have signs in
English advising you to call home using a
special 800 number — these booths are
absolute rip-offs and can cost as much as
$20 per minute. The least expensive way to
call is by using a Mexican prepaid phone
card called Telmex (LadaTel), available at
most pharmacies and mini-supermarkets,
using the official public phones, Telmex
(Lada). Remember, in Mexico, you need to
dial 001 prior to a number to reach the
United States, and you need to preface
long-distance calls within Mexico by 
dialing 01.

Chapter 11
Exploring Cancún
In This Chapter
 Enjoying Cancún’s best activities — by sea or by land
 Seeing the best sights
 Experiencing Cancún’s nightlife
 Venturing on day trips to the nearby sights
You’re likely to run out of vacation days before you run out of things
to do in Cancún. Snorkeling, jet skiing, jungle tours, and visits to
ancient Maya ruins or modern ecological theme parks are among the
most popular diversions in this resort that has a little of everything.
Beyond Cancún’s renowned beaches are over a dozen malls with 
name-brand retailers and duty-free shops (featuring European goods
with better prices than you can find in the United States), plus a seem-
ingly endless supply of nightclubs to revel in.
In addition to Cancún’s own attractions, the resort is a convenient dis-
tance from the more Mexican-feeling beach towns in Isla Mujeres (see
Chapter 12), Cozumel (see Chapter 13), and Playa del Carmen (see
Chapter 14). The Maya ruins at Tulum and Chichén Itzá are also close
by (see Chapter 15). All these diversions are within driving distance for
a spectacular day trip.
So what’s worth your time? To help you decide, I devote this chapter to
giving you an overview of the best beaches in this mecca of white sand
and crystalline waters. I also give you the rundown on the area’s popular
day trips and diversions.
Playing in the Surf
The big hotels dominate the best stretches of beaches, so you will likely
have a fine patch of sand at your hotel. All of Mexico’s beaches are
public property, so technically, you can use the beach of any hotel by
accessing it directly from the sand. Technically is the key word here.
Although this is the law, the reality is that hotel security guards regularly
ask nonguests to relocate. You choose if you want to suffer the potential
embarrassment of being asked to leave or, if asked, standing your
ground — or beach, as it were. The alternative is to go to Playa Delfines,

a beach that caters to the public or you can pay a fee to hang out at an
established beach club–meets-bar such as Fat Tuesdays, The City’s
Playa Cabana, and the Hard Rock Cafe.
If you’re intent on swimming, be careful on beaches fronting the open
Caribbean, where the undertow can be quite strong. By contrast, the
waters of Bahía de Mujeres at the north end of the island are usually
calm and ideal for swimming. Get to know Cancún’s water-safety pen-
nant system and make sure to check the flag at any beach or hotel
before entering the water.
Here’s what each flag means:
 White: Excellent
 Green: Normal conditions (safe)
 Yellow: Changeable, uncertain (use caution)
 Black or red: Unsafe (use the swimming pool instead)
In the Caribbean, storms can arrive quickly, and conditions can change
from safe to unsafe in a matter of minutes, so be alert: If you see dark
clouds heading your way, head to shore and wait until the storm passes.
For a closer look at Cancún’s beaches on a map, please see the “Cancún
Orientation Map” in Chapter 10.
Skiing and surfing
Many beachside hotels offer watersports concessions that include the
rental of rubber rafts, kayaks, and snorkeling equipment. Outlets for
renting sailboats, jet skis, windsurfers, and water skis are located on
the calm Nichupté Lagoon. Prices vary and are often negotiable, so
check around.
A very popular option for getting wet and wild is a jungle tour, offered
by several companies. Don’t let the name mislead you to believe that
you’ll be encompassed by dense rain forest, howling monkeys, and
jaguars. The tour by WaveRunner, motor scooter, or speedboat takes
you through Cancún’s lagoon and mangrove estuaries (which are still
recovering after the hurricane) out into the Caribbean Sea and by a shal-
low reef. Despite the lack of jungle lovin’ going on in these tours, driving
the marine craft is fun, and at least you get to go somewhere besides in
circles just off of the beach. The excursion runs about 21⁄2 hours (you
drive your own watercraft) and is priced from $40 to $65, with snorkel-
ing and beverages included. Some of the motorized miniboats seat you
side by side; other crafts seat one person behind the other. The differ-
ence? The second person can see the scenery or the back of his or her
companion’s head, depending on your choice.
The operators and names of boats offering excursions change often. The
popular Aquaworld (Blvd. Kukulkán, km 15.2; % 998-848-8327;
Part III: Discovering Cancún 
144

www.aquaworld.com.mx) calls its trip the Jungle Tour and charges $55
for the 21⁄2-hour excursion, which includes 45 minutes of snorkeling time.
The company even gives you a free snorkel, but its watercrafts have the
less-desirable seating configuration of one behind the other. Daily depar-
tures are scheduled for 8 a.m., 8:30 a.m., 9 a.m., 10:30 a.m., 11:30 a.m.,
noon, 1 p.m., 2 p.m., 2:30 p.m., 3: p.m., as well as 3:30 p.m. and 4:30 p.m.
during the summer months. To find out what’s available when you’re
there, check with a local travel agent or hotel tour desk; you should find
a wide range of options. You can also go directly to the Aquaworld
marina (at km 15.2) and buy your own tickets for trips on the Subsee
Explorer or to Isla Mujeres (see information later in this chapter).
What about BOB? BOB Cancún (Blvd. Kukulkán, km 4; % 998-149-2524;
www.cancunbob.com/bob), a breathing observation bubble, is the very
strange looking underwater scooter with an astronaut helmet. A scuba
tank supplies air to the helmet so that you can just breathe normally as
you cruise to depths of 7m (24 ft.) in a seated position. Plan to spend 
21⁄2 hours to partake in a 45-minute ride around Bahia de Mujeres
which costs $75, and includes instruction, beverages, wet suit, and
video. Departures at 9 a.m., 11:30 a.m., 2 p.m., and 4:30 p.m. from
El Embarcadero.
The Ocean Runner Tour (Blvd. Kukulkán, km 12.7; Ocean Marina below
La Casa del Habano across from the Police and Fire Station; % 998-267-
9703 or cell 998-577-4833) was the first to offer jungle tours riding top-of-
the-line WaveRunners. A multilingual guide takes you through the man-
groves and out into the ocean where you anchor your WaveRunner for a
little snorkeling (equipment provided). This two-hour tour departs from
Ocean Marina daily at 10 a.m., 12:30 p.m., and 3:30 p.m. You can book
directly or through your travel agent. Arrive at least 30 minutes early to
fit your fins, lifejackets, and so on. The cost is $65 per person with two
per WaveRunner.
Yachting and sailing
Living the lifestyles of the rich and famous is more accessible than ever
before in Cancún, whether it’s buying designer clothing, staying in a
luxury oceanfront villa, or sailing across the ocean blue on your very
own crewed yacht. While this is no inexpensive endeavor, if you are trav-
eling with a group of friends, you can all chip in for an experience of a
lifetime and a much more autonomous outing that you get with many of
the group tours.
Admiral Yacht Club (Blvd. Kukulkán, km 5.8; Marina Club Lagoon; 
% 800-356-6948 toll-free in Mexico; www.admiralyachtclub.com).
Speed along the water in a 13m (42-ft.) Samurai, or you and nine of your
friends can take out a 17m (55-ft.) Pegasus. From 11m to 17m (38 ft.–55
ft.), Admiral Yachts has cruisers, fishing boats (including the necessary
rods, reels, and gaffs), and includes a full-time licensed and reef-certified
captain and mate, insurance, maintenance, and concierge scheduling.
Chapter 11: Exploring Cancún 145

Opening in 2005, Yachts ET. is one of the newest luxury yacht busi-
nesses, located across from Plaza Kukulkán (Blvd. Kukulkán, km 13; Hot
Sports Marina; % 998-840-6414 or 998-883-4058; www.yachtset.com).
The 12m to 16m (40-ft.–54-ft.) vessels are equipped with staterooms and
are fully crewed. To give you an idea of cost for such a luxurious outing,
a two-hour sunset cruise for a 12m (40-ft.) yacht will cost you $650.
Appetizers and refreshments are included (48 bottles of beer, 1 quart 
of tequila, 1 quart of rum, two bottles of wine, soda, juice, and snacks).
Try to call at least four hours ahead to secure a yacht, and during peak
season, booking in advance of your trip is recommended.
You can also partake in a “Sailing Quest” aboard a catamaran sailboat
with Aquatours — a division of Dolphin Discovery, which is the same
company that operates Dolphin Swims, The Lobster Dinner Cruise, and
Jungle tours in Nichupté Lagoon. (Blvd. Kukulkán, km 6.25; % 800-417-
1736 toll-free from the U.S., or 998-849-4757; www.aquatours.com.mx).
This is a group trip over to Isla Mujeres, stopping to snorkel at Faritos
reef and then enjoy a buffet lunch and day at its beach club facilities.
Not exactly the exclusivity of a private yacht, as the catamaran hosts up
to 45 people, but a great way to put a little wind in your sails during your
vacation without blowing so much cash. The price is $55 for adults and
$27.50 for children; departures Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 10 a.m.,
returning at 5:30 p.m.
Sea Passion Catamaran offers a similar sailing tour aboard new catama-
rans to Isla Mujeres as well as a half-day cruise along the Rivera Maya
and Lobster Dinner night sailing (% 994-803-0399 or 984-803-3995).
Read more about pleasure boat trips and day trips to Isla Mujeres later
in this chapter and in Chapter 12.
Exploring the deep blue
Known for its shallow reefs, dazzling colors, and diversity of life, 
Cancún is one of the best places in the world for beginning scuba
diving. Punta Nizuc is the northern tip of the Gran Arrecife Maya
(Great Mesoamerican Reef), the largest reef in the Western Hemisphere
and one of the largest in the world. In addition to the sea life present
along this reef system, several sunken boats add a variety of dive
options. Inland, a series of caverns and wellsprings, known as cenotes,
are fascinating venues for the more experienced diver. Drift diving is the
norm here, with popular dives going to the reefs at El Garrafón and the
Cave of the Sleeping Sharks. For those unfamiliar with the term, drift
diving occurs when divers drift with the strong currents in the waters
and end up at a point different than where they started. The dive boat
follows them. In traditional dives, the divers resurface where they began,
often descending along the boat anchor rope.
Resort courses that teach the basics of diving — enough to make shal-
low dives and slowly ease your way into this underwater world of
unimaginable beauty — are offered in a variety of hotels. Scuba trips for
Part III: Discovering Cancún 
146

certified divers run around $70 for two-tank dives at nearby reefs and
$100 and up for locations farther out. Scuba Cancún (Blvd. Kukulkán,
km 5; % 998-849-7508 or 998-849-4736; www.scubacancun.com.mx), on
the lagoon side, offers a four-hour resort course for $88. In addition to
calling or visiting, you can make reservations in the evenings from 7:30
to 10:30 p.m. using the preceding phone numbers. Full certification takes
about three full days and costs around $410. Scuba Cancún is open from
8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. and accepts major credit cards.
The largest operator is Aquaworld, across from the Meliá Cancún 
hotel at Blvd. Kukulkán, km 15.2 (% 998-848-8327 or 998-848-8300; www.
aquaworld.com.mx). Aquaworld offers resort courses, full PADI dive
certifications, and dive boats to take certified divers to numerous reef,
wreck, and cave dives. Aquaworld provides resort dive and full scuba-
certification course study in several hotel pools such as the Ritz-Carlton
and the unique 5m (16-ft.) artificial reef pool at JW Marriott. The conven-
ience of having the instructor come to you is certainly worth the few
extra dollars. Aquaworld also has the SubSee Explorer, a submarine-
style boat with picture windows that hang beneath the surface. The boat
doesn’t actually submerge — it’s more like an updated version of the
glass-bottom boat concept — but it does provide nondivers with a look
at life beneath the sea. This outfit is open from 6:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. and
accepts all major credit cards.
Scuba Cancún (% 998-849-7808 or 998-849-4736) also offers diving trips
to 20 nearby reefs, at 9m (30 ft.), and the open ocean at 14m to 18m (45
ft.–60 ft.; offered in good weather only). The average dive is around 11m
(35 ft.). One-tank dives cost $54, and two-tank dives cost $68. Discounts
apply if you bring your own equipment. Dives usually start around 10 a.m.
and return by 2:15 p.m. Snorkeling trips cost $29 and leave every after-
noon at 2 p.m. for shallow reefs located about a 20-minute boat ride
away.
The Great Mesoamerican Reef also offers exceptional snorkeling oppor-
tunities near Cancún, for those who don’t want to go too deep. In Puerto
Morelos (37km/23 miles south of Cancún; see Chapter 14), this reef hugs
the coastline for 14km (9 miles). The closeness of the reef to the shore
(about 457m or 1,500 ft) is a natural barrier for the village and keeps the
waters calm on the inside of the reef. The depth of the water here is
shallow, between 2m and 9m (5 ft.–30 ft.), resulting in ideal conditions
for snorkeling. The reef here has remained unspoiled due to the strin-
gent environmental regulations implemented by the local community.
Only a select few companies are allowed to offer snorkel trips here and
must adhere to guidelines that will ensure the ecological preservation of
the reef. Among these companies, Cancún Mermaid is considered the
best — it’s a family-run ecotour company that has been operating in the
area since the ’70s, known for its highly personalized service. Its tour
typically takes snorkelers to two sections of the reef, spending about an
hour in each area; however, when conditions allow, the company will
have the boat drop off snorkelers and then follow them along with the
Chapter 11: Exploring Cancún 147

current — an activity known as drift snorkeling — which enables snorkel-
ers to see as much of the reef as possible. The price of the trip is $50 for
adults, $35 for children, and includes boat, snorkeling gear, life jackets, a
light lunch, bottled water, sodas, and beer, plus round-trip transporta-
tion to and from Puerto Morelos from Cancún hotels. Departures are
Monday through Saturday at 9 a.m. and noon (minimum of four snorkel-
ers required for a trip), and reservations are required; % 998-843-6517,
or cellphone 998-843-6517; www.cancunmermaid.com.
Reeling in the big one
You can arrange a day of deep-sea fishing at one of the numerous piers
or travel agencies for around $200 to $360 for four hours, $420 for six
hours, and $520 for eight hours for up to four people. Marinas some-
times assist in putting together a group. Charters include a captain, a
first mate, bait, gear, and beverages. Rates are lower if you depart from
Isla Mujeres or from Cozumel Island, and frankly, the fishing is better
closer to these departure points. One company that offers big game fish-
ing and small game and bottom fishing aboard 9.3m and 11m (31-ft. and
35-ft.) Bertrams equipped with Penn Senator fishing rods, down riggers,
outriggers, and a fish finder is Marina Barracuda Reef Adventures
(% 998-885-2444; www.marinabarracuda.com), located across the
street from The Ritz-Carlton Hotel at Blvd. Kukulkán, km 14.1 on Laguna
Nichupté. Four hours range from $320 to $440; up to eight hours costs
between $640 and $750 for six people.
Swimming with dolphins
In Cancún, the Parque Nizuc (% 998-881-3030; www.atlantidacancun.
com) aquatic park, home of Wet ’n Wild Cancún, offers guests a chance
to swim with dolphins and view these wonderful creatures in their own
aquarium, Atlántida. It’s a fun place for a family to spend the day, with
its numerous pools, water slides, and rides. Another attraction offers the
chance to snorkel with manta rays, tropical fish, and tame sharks. Open
10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., the park is located on the southern end of Cancún at
km 25, between the airport and the Hotel Zone. Transportation can be
arranged from your hotel. Admission to the park is $25 for adults and $19
for kids, but a solo swim with the dolphins is a splurge, $135 for adults and
$115 for children. You can even play dolphin trainer for the day for $170.
La Isla Shopping Village (see the “Cancún Orientation Map” in Chapter 10),
Blvd. Kukulkán, km 12.5, also has an impressive Interactive Aquarium
(% 800-012-0856 toll-free in Mexico, or 998-883-0411; www.aquarium
cancun.com) with dolphin swims and the chance to feed a shark while
immersed in the water in an acrylic cage. Guides inside the main tank use
underwater microphones to point out the sea life, and even answer your
questions. Open exhibition tanks enable visitors to touch a variety of
marine life, including sea stars and manta rays. The educational dolphin
program is $65, while the dolphin swim is $125. The entrance fee to the
aquarium is $13 for adults, $9 for children, and it’s open from 9 a.m. to 
5 p.m. daily.
Part III: Discovering Cancún 
148

Another option for close encounters with dolphins is found on Isla
Mujeres, where you can swim with dolphins at Dolphin Discovery
(% 998-849-4757; fax: 998-849-4758; www.dolphindiscovery.com).
There are several options for dolphin interaction, but my choice is the
Royal Swim, which includes an educational introduction followed by 
30 minutes of swim time. The price is $139, and transportation to Isla
Mujeres is an additional $5 for program participants. Reservations are
required because capacity is limited each day. Assigned swimming times
are 10 a.m., noon, 2 p.m., and 3:30 p.m., and you must arrive 11⁄2 hours
before your scheduled swim time.
Note: Swimming with dolphins has its critics and supporters. You may
want to visit the Whale and Dolphins Conservation Society’s Web site at
www.wdcs.org. For more information about responsible travel in gen-
eral, check out these two Web sites: Tread Lightly (www.treadlightly.
org) and the International Ecotourism Society (www.ecotourism.org).
Exploring on Dry Land
Even by land, Cancún has its share of winning ways to spend the day.
Although golf is a latent developer here, more courses are popping up
along the coast south of Cancún. Tennis, however, is tops as a hotel
amenity, and you can find courts throughout Cancún. Horseback riding
and all-terrain vehicle tours are also great choices for land adventures.
The top attractions
To the right side of the entrance to the Cancún Convention Center is 
the small Museo Arqueológico de Cancún (% 998-883-0305) (see the
“Cancún Orientation Map” in Chapter 10), small but interesting museum
with relics from archaeological sites around the state. Admission is $3,
with no charge for children under 13 (free for all on Sun and holidays).
The museum is open Tuesday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m., and
Saturday and Sundays from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.
Another cultural enclave is the Museo de Arte Popular Mexicano 
(% 998-849-4332; or 998-849-5583), located on the second floor of the El
Embarcadero Marina, Blvd. Kukulkán, km 4. It displays a representative
collection of masks, regional folkloric costumes, nativity scenes, reli-
gious artifacts, musical instruments, Mexican toys, and gourd art,
spread over 1,350m (4,500 ft.) of exhibition space. Admission is $5, with
kids under 12 paying $3. The museum is open Monday through Friday 9
a.m. to 7 p.m., and Saturday and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.
During the winter tourist season, bullfights are held every Wednesday at
3:30 p.m. in Ciudad Cancún’s small bullring Plaza de Toros (% 998-884-
8372 or 998-884-8248), which is located near the northern end of Blvd.
Kukulkán, next to Plaza Nayandéi (Av. Bonampak and Sayil). A sport
introduced to Mexico by the Spanish viceroys, bullfighting is now as
much a part of Mexican culture as tequila. The bullfights usually include
Chapter 11: Exploring Cancún 149

four bulls, and the spectacle begins with a folkloric dance exhibition, fol-
lowed by a performance by the charros (Mexico’s sombrero-wearing
cowboys). You’re not likely to see Mexico’s best bullfights in Cancún —
the real stars are in Mexico City.
Keep in mind that if you go to a bullfight, you’re going to see a bullfight,
so stay away if you’re an animal lover or you can’t bear the sight of
blood. Travel agencies in Cancún sell tickets: $40 for adults, with chil-
dren admitted free of charge. Seating is by general admission. American
Express, MasterCard, and Visa are accepted.
Cancún has its own Maya ruins, Ruinas del Rey (Blvd. Kukulkán, km 17,
see the “Cancún Orientation Map” in Chapter 10), a small site that’s less
impressive than the ruins at Tulum or Chichén Itzá — much less impres-
sive. The numerous iguanas seem to populate the place more than
tourists, but it’s an interesting little diversion if you are nearby. Maya
fishermen built this small ceremonial center and settlement very early in
the history of Maya culture and then abandoned it. The site was resettled
again near the end of the post-Classic period, not long before the arrival
of the conquistadors. The platforms of numerous small temples are visible
amid the banana plants, papayas, and wildflowers. The ruins are about
19km (12 miles) from town, at the southern reaches of the Hotel Zone,
close to Punta Nizuc. Look for Playa Delfines left (east) and then the
ruins on the right (west). Admission is $4.50 (free on Sun and holidays);
the hours are 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. daily.
Keeping active
With plenty of warm-weather activities at your disposal, there’s no
reason not to be active on your Cancún holiday, so don’t forget to pack
your tennis shoes!
Teeing off
Although the golf options are limited, the most well-known — and 
well-used — facility is the 18-hole Club de Golf Cancún (see the “Cancún
Orientation Map” in Chapter 10; % 998-883-0871; poktapok@sybcom.
com), also known as the Pok-Ta-Pok Club. Designed by Robert Trent
Jones, Sr., it’s located on the northern leg of the island. Greens fees run
$100 per 18 holes. Clubs rent for $27, shoes run $16, and caddies charge
$20 per bag. The club is open daily; American Express, MasterCard, and
Visa are accepted. The club also has tennis courts. Gran Melía Cancún
Beach & Spa Resort (see the “Where to Stay in Isla Cancún” map in
Chapter 10; % 998-881-1100,) offers a nine-hole executive course; the
fee is $43, and the club is open daily from 7 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. American
Express, MasterCard, and Visa are accepted.
One of the most popular and convenient options is at the Hilton Cancún
Beach & Golf Resort (see the “Cancún Orientation Map” in Chapter 10;
% 998-881-8016 ; fax: 998-881-8084). Its championship 18-hole, par-72
course was designed along the lagoon and around the Ruinas del Rey
Part III: Discovering Cancún 
150

(Ruins of the King) archaeological site. The course was recently refitted
with all new Paspalum Bermuda grass, ideal for the weather conditions
in Cancún. Greens fees for the public are $125 for 18 holes and $99 for 
9 holes; Hilton Cancún guests receive a 20 percent discount off these
rates. Greens fees include a golf cart. Golf clubs and shoes are available
for rent as well, and the club is open daily from 6 a.m., with closing time
varying depending upon the season and available daylight.
Moon Palace Golf Club (% 800-868-2802 toll-free from the U.S., or
998-881-6000 in Mexico; www.palace-resorts-cancun.com), an 18-hole,
72-par course designed by Jack Nicklaus, is located off the Cancún-
Tulum Highway (km 36.5). It’s the perfect place to play a few rounds if
you stay at the all-inclusive Moon Palace Resort where they even have
golf villas, but a bit of a trek from the Hotel Zone (20-minute cab ride
that costs about $18 there and $10 back). Four sets of tee boxes make it
ideal for a group with many different skill levels.
Puerto Cancún Golf Club (% 886-580-0749 toll-free from the U.S., or
800-523-4868 toll-free in Mexico; www.puertocancun.com), a new golf
community with over 2,100 luxury condominiums, features an 18-hole
course designed by British Open champion Tom Weiskopf, and over-
looks the ocean along the Bay of Isla Mujeres (Av. Cobá #43 Lote 16, 
Sm. 4). Arriving on the scene in 2006, the challenging design incorpo-
rates narrow fairways, water features, and treacherous bunkers. The
Clubhouse offers everything from a full-service restaurant to a fully
stocked pro shop.
Playa Mujeres Golf Club (Av. Bonampak s/n, Punta Sam; % 998-887-
7322; www.playamujeresgolf.com), an 18-hole, par 72 course, is the
brainchild of Greg Norman and is operated by Arizona-based Troon Golf.
Ocean and Lagoon holes create a nice view for an afternoon drive. A
fully equipped Clubhouse with Callaway X clubs for rent and Footjoy
golf-shoe rental lets you hit the greens even if you didn’t pack your
sticks. Greens fees run $160 to $190.
At print time, TCP Cancún, located at La Roca Country Club (% 998-
892-3616; www.larocacountryclub.com), was in the process of build-
ing two 18-hole golf courses — one designed by Tom Fazio and the other
by Nick Price. The hope is for completion by winter of 2007. Call or
check the Web site for updated information.
Making time for tennis
Many hotels in Cancún offer excellent tennis facilities, and many of 
the courts are lit for night play. Among the best are the facilities at Le
Méridien, Fiesta Americana Grand Coral Beach, and The Ritz-Carlton.
Fiesta Americana has hard surface, air-conditioned indoor tennis courts
with stadium seating and regularly hosts tournaments. The Ritz-Carlton
just built three lighted courts and has a tennis club with an instruction
program devised by legendary player and ESPN commentator Cliff
Drysdale.
Chapter 11: Exploring Cancún 151

Guided tours
Need a break from the beach? The following tours give you a great
excuse to get off the beach and explore the mainland.
Galloping along on horseback
Rancho Loma Bonita (% 998-887-5465 or 998-887-5423; www.loma
bonitamex.com) is Cancún’s most popular option for horseback riding.
Five-hour packages are available for $65. The packages include two
hours of riding to caves, cenotes (spring-fed, underground caves),
lagoons, and Maya ruins, and along the Caribbean coast. After the ride,
you have some time for relaxing on the beach. The ranch also offers a
four-wheeler ride on the same route as the horseback tour for $55.
Ranch Loma Bonita is located about 30 minutes south of Cancún. The
prices include transportation to the ranch, riding, soft drinks, and lunch,
plus a guide and insurance. Only cash is accepted.
Hacienda Andalucia Equestrian Club (% 998-206-0287 or 998-206-0288;
www.hacienda-andalucia.com) is Cancún’s newcomer in all things
equestrian. It is about a 20-minute drive from the Hotel Zone and difficult
to find if driving, so opt for the package with the round-trip transportation
from your hotel (Mz. 228 L1 Sm. 307 Alfredo V. Bonfil Lorenzo Barrera). To
make it even easier, just stay there in one of the 36 suites with a kitchen
located on-site. You can also jump in the saddle at Hacienda Andalucia for
a Jungle Trail Ride, but leave the stunts to the professionals!
Trailing away through the jungle
Cancún Mermaid (% 998-843-6517 or 998-886-4117; www.cancun
mermaid.com), in Cancún, offers all-terrain-vehicle (ATV) jungle tours
priced at $49 per person. The ATV tours travel through the jungles of
Cancún and emerge on the beaches of the Riviera Maya. The 21⁄2-hour
tour includes equipment, instruction, the services of a tour guide, and
bottled water; it departs daily at 8 a.m. and 1:30 p.m.
Loma Bonita (% 998-887-5465 or 998-887-5423; www.rancholoma
bonita.com) also offers all-terrain-vehicle (ATV) tours that can be com-
bined with snorkeling and taking a WaveRunner out for a spin. The two-
hour guided ATV Jungle, Beach & Wilderness Adventure tour takes you
through mangroves and along the beach and includes water, soda, and
snacks. There are three departures a day.
For guided tours of all things aquatic, don’t forget to refer to the
“Exploring the deep blue” section earlier in this chapter. Outside of
Cancún, visitors may take tours to explore nearby Maya ruins, ecoparks,
and even Cozumel’s marine life — in a submarine. For more information,
refer to the “Going Beyond Cancún: Day Trips” section at the end of this
chapter.

Living It Up After Dark
Ready to party? The nightlife in Cancún is as hot as the sun at noon on a
cloudless July day, and clubbing is one of the main attractions of this let-
loose town. The current hot spots are centralized near Forum by the
Sea, but it’s not hard to find a party anywhere in town. Hotels also com-
pete for your pesos with happy-hour entertainment and special drink
prices as they try to entice visitors and guests from other resorts to pay
a visit. (Lobby-bar hopping at sunset is one great way to plan next year’s
vacation.)
Partying at a club
Clubbing in Cancún can go on each night until the sun rises over 
that incredibly blue sea. Several of the big hotels have nightclubs —
sometimes still called discos here — and others entertain in their lobby
bars with live music. On weekends, expect to stand in long lines for the
top clubs, pay a cover charge of $10 to $20 per person, and spend $5 to
$8 on a drink. Some of the higher-priced clubs include an open bar or
live entertainment.
A great idea to get you started is the Party Hopper (% 998-881-4050)
by the American Express Travel Agency. For $65, it takes you by way of
air-conditioned bus from bar to club — the list currently includes Congo,
Señor Frog’s, Daddy Rock, and Coco Bongo — where you’ll bypass any
lines and spend about two hours in each place. This is especially great
for places like Daddy Rock and Coco Bongo that tend to have the biggest
lines. The price includes cover charges, open bar, and VIP drink service,
which is the biggest perk because getting a drink at the clubs can be such
a hassle and cuts into precious time on the dance floor. Transportation
shouldn’t sell you on the deal, because the bus is so easy and cheap, and
all of these clubs are very close to one another. The tour runs from 8 p.m.
to 3:30 a.m., and you can book through many tour operators at your hotel
or by calling to reserve. Visa, MasterCard, and American Express are
accepted.
What’s hot now? As any good clubber knows, popularity can shift like the
sands on the beach, but Cancún clubs do seem to have staying power. So
take this list as a starting point — extensive research showed me that
these were the current hot spots at press time, listed alphabetically:
 Basic (Blvd. Kukulkán, km 10.3; % 998-883-2186) is the dome bar
seemingly hovering over the lagoon water like a spaceship. You will
definitely feel like you’re on another planet if you show up on the
wrong night here, so check ahead if it’s the night of the “Soaking Wet
Contest,” or “Foam Party.” Young locals also make this club their
mother ship on Saturdays, jamming to house, Top 40, Latino, and
reggae. Open 10:30 p.m. to 3:30 a.m. $15 cover.
Chapter 11: Exploring Cancún 153

 Bulldog Café (formerly the disco Christine), in the Hotel Krystal on
the island (Blvd. Kukulkán, km 8; % 998-848-9800; www.bulldog
cafe.com). Many bands, from U2 to Radiohead, have performed in
this impressive space that seems to be more “rock” focused and a
little less popular than other club counterparts. The VIP Jacuzzi adds
an interesting component to nocturnal fun, and the overall ambi-
ence is casual and funky. The music ranges from hip-hop and Latino
rock to ’80s music. Bulldog opens at 10 p.m. nightly and stays open
until the party winds down. The cover charge is $15 per person, or
pay $25 for open bar all night long (domestic drinks only).
 The City (Blvd. Kukulkán, km 9.5; % 998-848-8380, ext. 13;
www.thecitycancun.com) is one of Cancún’s hottest clubs, sport-
ing the world’s largest light show with 450 robotic lights, not to
mention the world’s largest disco ball to bounce the light around
even more. Top DJs from New York, L.A., and Mexico City spin hip-
hop and dance music, and there’s an acrobatic show, but it pales in
comparison to Coco Bongo’s extravaganza. Nevertheless, the vibe
is hot and with the likes of 50 Cent and Fat Joe performing here,
you know that you will have a good time well into the night. Open
at 10:30 p.m., the 2323 sq.-m (25,000-sq.-ft.) nightclub accommo-
dates 5,000 and has nine bars, several VIP areas, and an open bar
for $35 (otherwise a $15 cover charge). You actually need never
leave, because The City is a day-and-night club. Playa Cabana
opens at 9 a.m. and features a beachfront pool and gauze-covered
cabanas with misters and personal stereo speakers playing chilled
Euro Lounge music. You can reserve a bed ahead and it’s recom-
mended during high season, as it’s a pretty exclusive space — $10
gets you a chair and a towel for the day and $25 gets the ultra-hip
food and bar service. You can also grab a cerveza at The City’s
Corona Bar, which overlooks the action on Blvd. Kukulkán and
serves food and drinks all day long. For a relaxing evening vibe, the
Lounge features comfy couches, chill music, and an extensive menu
of martinis, snacks, and desserts.
 Coco Bongo in Forum by the Sea (Blvd. Kukulkán, km 9.5; % 998-
883-5061; www.cocobongo.com.mx) continues its reputation as one
of the hottest spots in town.
 Dady’O (Blvd. Kukulkán, km 9.5; % 998-883-3333; www.dadyo.
com.mx) is highly favored; in fact, you’ll find this place has a strong
pull with the locals. There is a ton of music from the ’80s and ’90s as
well as Latino hits as people dance away on the rotating dance floor.
It opens nightly at 10 p.m. and generally charges a cover of $15. Dady
Rock Bar and Grill (Blvd. Kukulkán, km 9.5; % 998-883-1626), the
offspring of Dady’O, opens early (6 p.m.) and goes as long as any
other nightspot, offering a new twist on entertainment with a combi-
nation of live bands and DJ-orchestrated music. Dos Equis XX,
named after the popular Mexican beer, is another Dady’O dynamo
terrace bar facing the action on Blvd. Kukulkán, and next door is 
O Ultra Lounge, with a decidedly more contemporary feel, with
rooftop couches, modern interior, and progressive and trance music.
Part III: Discovering Cancún 
154

 Nectar Bar Lounge (Blvd. Kukulkán, km 8.5 next to Plaza Zocalo; 
% 998-883-3716; www.nectarbar.com), where the who’s who go
to party after-hours, is located right on the water of the Nichupté
Lagoon — many people sit on the sand (or pass out) until the sun
rises.
 KaRaMBa Bar (Av. Tulum 9 at the corner of Calle Azucenas, Ciudád
Cancún; % 998-884-0032; www.karambabar.com) is the most 
popular gay disco for males and females. With a drag show on
Wednesdays and strip shows on the weekends, there’s never a dull
moment here. If that doesn’t satisfy, Glow, another gay club, is right
around the corner at Tulipanes 3, Sm. 22.
Numerous restaurants, such as Carlos ’n’ Charlie’s, Pat O’Briens,
Margaritaville, Planet Hollywood, Hard Rock Cafe, Señor Frog’s, and
TGI Friday’s, double as nighttime party spots offering wild-ish fun at
much lower prices than the clubs. Check these out:
 Carlos ’n’ Charlie’s (Blvd. Kukulkán, km 8.5, additional locations in
Playa del Carmen and Cozumel; % 998-883-1862; www.carlosand
charlies.com) is a reliable place to find both good food and fran-
chise fun in the evenings. A popular spot by day for lunch as well,
with barbecue ribs being an all-time favorite.
 Hard Rock Cafe, at Forum by the Sea (Blvd. Kukulkán, km 9; % 998-
881-8120 or 998-883-2024; www.hardrock.com). A long red carpet
leads to this eatery and place of pilgrimage for many music afi-
cionados and Hard Rock groupies. A live band takes center stage at
10 p.m. daily in front of the huge stained-glass image of Elvis. At
other times, you get lively recorded music to have on the side of
your fajitas (or cheeseburger).
 Planet Hollywood (La Isla Shopping Village, Blvd. Kukulkán, km
12.5; % 998-883-1936; www.planethollywood.com) is the still-
popular brainchild (and one of the last-remaining 19 in the world)
of Sylvester Stallone, Bruce Willis, and Arnold Schwarzenegger.
This restaurant moved from its less busy Plaza Flamingo location
but still has the same fun décor accents, like the car from Ferris
Bueller’s Day Off hanging from the ceiling.
 Señor Frog’s (Blvd. Kukulkán, km 9.5; % 998-883-1092; www.
senorfrogs.com) is another Anderson chain highlight that packs
in crowds of those in search of a party, up to 1,500, that is. This
green icon is almost synonymous with tequila shooters and non-
stop action.
Café and lounge scene
While body shots and girls in wet T-shirts often come to mind when
thinking about partying in Cancún, there are several more sophisticated
options to enjoy a cocktail and a hip ambience. For the young profes-
sional crowd, many of these spots are cafes by day and more of a lounge
scene by night.
Chapter 11: Exploring Cancún 155

 Dub (Av. Nader 88 Sm. 3 — at C. Mero across from City Hall, Ciudád
Cancún; % 998-898-2446) is a sleek and contemporary cafe, yet
reflects the laid-back style of the young Mexican owner with a
seemingly California-surfer edge.
 Lobby Lounge at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel (% 998-881-0808) is one
of most refined and upscale of all Cancún’s nightly gathering spots.
Live dance music, martinis properly shaken, and a list of more than
120 premium tequilas for sipping are the highlights here. Best of all,
the Ceviche Bar offers nine different varieties of ceviche prepared
right in front of you by the chef. Try the tasting, so you can sample
a spoonful of each!
 Marakame Café (Circuito Copán L 25 Sm. 19 — between Avenida
Labna and Avenida Nichupté, Ciudád Cancún; % 998-887-1010).
Despite its location near Plaza Las Americas, Costco, and Sport
City, this cafe is a bit tough to find, so you may be better off jump-
ing in a cab. It’s worth the cab fare to enjoy the fabulous selection
of all natural dishes like huge salads, fresh juices, and crepes.
 Roots (Tulipanes 26, Sm. 22; % 998-884-2437). One of the best jazz
venues in town can be found in the heart of Ciudád Cancún. Both
locals and tourists head to this hacienda-style restaurant and
music venue to hear famous musicians from abroad or down the
street. The menu has a Caribbean influence, and serves pastas,
meats, and salads.
 Zanzibar (Av. Yaxchilán Edificio 148, Sm. 20 — across the circle
from Burger King; Ciudád Cancún). The theme, “Hot Music, Cool
Food,” sets the tone for this very small, verging on tiny, eatery 
serving empanadas, salads, pastas, and other tasty appetizers.
However, it’s more the lounge scene that draws the hipsters than
the food.
Enjoying a cultural event
Several hotels host Mexican fiesta nights, which include a buffet dinner
and a folkloric dance show; the price, including dinner, ranges from $35
to $50, but the quality of the performance is likely to be less professional
than the show performed at the convention center.
Azúcar (Blvd. Kukulkán, Punta Cancún; % 998-848-7000, ext. 7985)
offers insight into one of the cultural cruxes of Latin culture: dance. At
this prestigious club located next to Dreams Resort & Spa, you will see
Latin men and women dressed to the nines to watch professional salsa,
rumba, and merengue performances and then get out on the dance floor
to shake it to live Latin rhythms — often by world-famous performers
like Mexican singer Celia Cruz or Los Van Van (Cuba’s most famous
band). Of course, you don’t have to know what you’re doing to get out
there and try your hand (or should I say, foot?) at salsa. This place is
Part III: Discovering Cancún 
156

ultra popular during high season, so reservations are recommended.
Dreams Resort & Spa guests receive free admission and two complimen-
tary drinks. (Dress code for men: no shorts, hats, tank tops, or sandals.)
Tourists mingle with locals at the downtown Parque de las Palapas for
Noches Caribeñas, which involves free live tropical music for anyone
who wants to listen and dance. Performances begin at 7:30 p.m. on
Sunday, and sometimes there are performances on Friday and Saturday.
To take in the activity of Parque de las Palapas without being in the thick
of it, you can people-watch from afar. Pull up a chair or plop down on a
comfy sofa at neighboring Terraza ChacMool, an open-air, thatched-roof
terrace bar with a rooftop lounge overlooking the park. (It’s attached 
to a youth hostel.) Kick back in comfort on a couch while listening to
European lounge rhythms. If you’re a fan of mojitos, properly made with
lots of muddled mint and not too sweet, you can’t go wrong here; it will
only cost you $3.80. C. Gladiolas 18, Ciudád Cancún; % 998-887-5873.
Going Beyond Cancún: Day Trips
One of the best ways to spend a vacation day in Cancún is by exploring
one the nearby archaeological ruins or new ecological theme parks or 
by sailing away for the day to the quaint, nearby island, Isla Mujeres.
Historical and natural treasures unlike any you may have encountered
before are within easy driving distance. Cancún is a perfect base for day
trips to these places, which provide a great introduction to Mexico’s rich
historical past and diverse natural attractions.
The Maya ruins to the south of Cancún at Tulum should be your first
goal. Then check out the caleta (cove) of Xel-Ha or take the day trip to
Xcaret. See Chapter 15 for more information on the ruins at Tulum and
Chapter 14 for more on Xcaret and Xel-Ha.
For day trips by land, the organized trips are popular and easy to book
through any travel agent in town, or you can plan a journey on your own
via bus or rental car.
Day trips to Isla Mujeres
One of the most popular — and, perhaps, best — ways to spend the day
is to check out a real Mexican beach town across the narrow channel
from Cancún. Isla Mujeres (the name means “Island of Women” in
Spanish), just 16km (10 miles) offshore, is one of the most pleasant day
trips from Cancún. At one end of the island is El Garrafón National
Underwater Park, which is excellent for snorkeling and diving. At the
other end is a captivating village with small shops, restaurants, and
hotels, along with Playa Norte (North Beach), the island’s best beach.
Chapter 11: Exploring Cancún 157

To get from Cancún to Isla Mujeres, you have four options:
 The public ferries from Puerto Juárez take between 15 and 45 min-
utes and make frequent trips.
 Traveling by shuttle boat from Playa Linda or Playa Tortuga is an
hour-long ride. The boats offer irregular service.
 The water taxi is a more expensive but faster option than the
public ferry or a shuttle boat. It’s located next to the Xcaret 
terminal.
 Daylong pleasure-boat trips to the island leave from the Playa
Linda pier.
Scenic boat trips
The Atlantis Submarine (% 987-872-5671; $81 adults, $48 children ages
4–12) provides a front-row seat to the underwater action. Departures
vary, depending on weather conditions, and the submarine descends to
a depth of 30m (100 ft.). Atlantis Submarine departs Monday to Saturday
every hour from 8 a.m. until 2 p.m.; the tour lasts about an hour. The
submarine departs from Cozumel, so you need to take a ferry to get
there or purchase the package that includes round-trip ground and
water transportation from your hotel in Cancún ($103 adults, $76 chil-
dren ages 4 to 12). For more information, see Chapter 13.
You can call any travel agent or see any hotel tour desk to get a wide
selection of boat tours to Isla Contoy. Prices range from $44 to $65,
depending on the length of the trip. Still other boat excursions visit Isla
Contoy, a national bird sanctuary that’s well worth the time. However,
if you plan to spend time in Isla Mujeres, the Contoy trip is easier and
more pleasurable to take from there.
Seeing the archaeological sites
Five great archaeological sites are within close proximity to Cancún:
Tulum, Cobá, Chichén Itzá, Ek Balam, and Ruinas del Rey. You can
arrange day trips from Cancún through your hotel or through a travel
agent in the United States (before you go) or in Mexico.
 Chichén Itzá: The fabled pyramids and temples of Chichén Itzá are
the region’s best-known ancient monuments. Hours are 8 a.m. to 
5 p.m. daily. Admission is $10, free for children under 12, and free for
all on Sundays and holidays. For more information, see Chapter 15.
 Cobá: About 2.5 hours by car, Cobá is more of a trek, but there are
some day trips available. It’s more spread out and more overgrown
by rain forest vegetation than the other ruins, but it’s worth the
exercise to see these steep, classic Maya pyramids (albeit less
reconstructed than other ruins). Hours are 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily.
Admission is $3.50, free for children under 12, and free for all on
Sundays and holidays. For more information, see Chapter 15.
Part III: Discovering Cancún 
158

 Ek Balam: Located 145km (90 miles) from Cancún, this site mean-
ing “black jaguar,” is the newest to be opened to the public and fea-
tures smaller temples, altars, and living quarters. Hours are 8 a.m.
to 5 p.m. daily. Admission is $2, free for children under 12, and 
free for all on Sundays and holidays. For more information, see
Chapter 15.
 Ruinas del Rey: Cancún has some ruins of its own, which are 
convenient though far less impressive. The hours are 8 a.m. until
4:30 p.m. daily. Admission is $4.50. For more information, see the
“Exploring Dry Land” section earlier in this chapter.
 Tulum: Poised on a rocky hill overlooking the transparent, turquoise
Caribbean Sea, ancient Tulum is a stunning sight. Hours are 8 a.m. to
6 p.m. daily in the summer and 7 a.m. until 5 p.m. daily in the winter.
Admission is $3.50, with free admission on Sunday. For more informa-
tion, see Chapter 15.
Exploring an ecotheme park
The popularity of the Xcaret and Xel-Ha ecoparks has inspired a growing
number of entrepreneurs to ride the wave of interest in ecological and
adventure theme parks. Be aware that “theme park” more than “ecologi-
cal” is the operative part of the phrase. The newer parks of Aktun Chen
and Tres Ríos are — so far — less commercial and more focused on
nature than their predecessors.
Talk to ecotour local experts at Naturama, a huge open-air facility close
to Fiesta Americana Grand Coral Beach, to find out more information and
reserve various day trips and eco-adventures. (Blvd. Kukulkán, km 9; 
% 998-883-332; www.naturama.com.mx.)
Aktun Chen
This nature park, with its large, well-lit caverns and abundant wildlife, is
the first time that above-the-ground cave systems in the Yucatán have
been open to the public. The main cave contains three rivers and a deep
cenote.
Traveling to Aktun Chen on your own is easy. From Cancún, go south on
Highway 307 (the road to Tulum). Just past the turnoff for Akumal, a sign
on the right side of the highway indicates the turnoff for Aktun Chen (at
km 107, Cancún-Tulum Rd.). From there, it’s a 3km (nearly 2-mile) drive
west along a smooth but unpaved road. Travel time from Cancún is about
an hour. For more on Aktun Chen (% 998-892-0662; www.aktunchen.
com), see Chapter 14.
Chikin-Ha
The newest eco-adventure in the area is the half-day tour to Chikin-Ha
(% 984-873-2036; www.alltournative.com), also known as the Mayan
Chapter 11: Exploring Cancún 159

Zip Line. You have the option of hiking or biking through the landscape
past a series of three cenotes with deep-blue waters. You can stop and
swim in each or choose to take a zip line over the cenote and tropical
landscape. Departures from Cancún are $94, or $84 for children under 12,
and include transportation, guide, equipment, snacks, and beverages.
Cobá
Alltournative also offers a full-day trip to Cobá where you can visit the
fascinating ruins before partaking in the Mayan Encounter (% 984-873-
2036; www.alltournative.com). Go to a village to see how the Mayas
live and teach you about surrounding flora and fauna. The adventure
includes a a ride on a zip line, rappelling into a cenote, and canoeing on a
lagoon. Departures from Cancún are $104, or $94 for children under 12,
and include transportation, guide, equipment, snacks, and beverages.
Tres Ríos
Tres Ríos (% 998-887-8077; www.tres-rios.com) — meaning three
rivers — is the most natural of the area’s nature parks. Just 25 minutes
south of Cancún on more than 60 hectares (150 acres) of land, this park
is a true nature reserve that offers guests a beautiful area for kayaking,
canoeing, snorkeling, horseback riding, or biking along jungle trails.
Extremely damaged in Hurricane Wilma, Tres Ríos is scheduled to
reopen the summer of ’07 to reclaim its title as the epicenter of all these
activities. Most Cancún travel agencies sell a half-day Kayak Express
tour to Tres Ríos. At $45, it includes admission and activities, plus
round-trip transportation, lunch, and two nonalcoholic drinks.
Xcaret
Xcaret (pronounced ish-car-et), located 56km (35 miles) south of Cancún,
is a specially built ecological and archaeological theme park and one of
the area’s most popular tourist attractions. Xcaret has become almost a
reason in itself to visit Cancún. With a ton of attractions — most of them
participatory — in one location, it’s the closest thing to Disneyland in
Mexico. In Cancún, signs advertising Xcaret and folks handing out Xcaret
leaflets are everywhere. Plan to spend a full day here; children love it,
and the jungle setting and palm-lined beaches are beautiful. Past the
entrance booths (built to resemble small Maya temples) are pathways
that meander around bathing coves, the snorkeling lagoon, and the
remains of a group of real Maya temples.
Xcaret may celebrate Mother Nature, but its builders rearranged quite 
a bit of her handwork in completing it. If you’re looking for a place to
escape the commercialism of Cancún, this park may not be it. The park
is relatively expensive and may be very crowded, thus diminishing the
advertised “natural” experience.
Travel agencies in Cancún offer day trips to Xcaret that depart at 7:30 a.m.
and offer your choice of a return at 6:30 p.m., or 9 p.m., after the dinner
show Xcaret Spectacular Night. The cost starts at $59 for adults and $33
Part III: Discovering Cancún 
160

for children for basic admission. For packages with transportation from
Cancún included it’s $85 for adults ($45 for children). You can also buy 
a ticket to the park at The Xcaret Information Center/Naturama, the
former Xcaret bus terminal, located next to the Fiesta Americana Coral
Beach hotel in the Hotel Zone. Buses pick up at designated hotels or
leave the terminal at 9:45 a.m. daily. From Ciudád Cancún’s bus terminal,
bus lines leave every 30 minutes from 5 a.m. to 8 p.m. The bus will drop
you off about 1⁄2 mile from the main gate, where you can take Xcaret’s free
bus “Despeinado.” The park is open daily 8:30 a.m. to 9 p.m., and until 
10 p.m. in the summer months. For more on Xcaret (% 998-883-3143 or
998-883-0524; www.xcaretcancun.com), see Chapter 14.
Xel-Ha
The sea has carved the Caribbean coast of the Yucatán into hundreds of
small caletas, or coves. Many caletas along the coast remain undiscov-
ered and pristine, but Xel-Ha (shell-hah), near Tulum, plays host daily 
to throngs of snorkelers and scuba divers who come to luxuriate in its
warm waters and swim among its brilliant fish. Xel-Ha is a swimmer’s
paradise with no threat of undertow or pollution. It’s a beautiful, com-
pletely calm cove that’s a perfect place to bring kids for their first snor-
keling experience. Experienced snorkelers may be disappointed because
the crowds seem to have driven out the living coral and many of the fish
here. For more information on Xel-Ha (% 998-883-3293; www.xel-ha.
com), see Chapter 14.

Traveling Around
Isla Mujeres and
Cozumel

In this part . . .
I
f you’re looking for a low-key place that doesn’t have the
hustle and bustle of Cancún or the boomtown feel of the
newer towns along the Riviera Maya (covered in Part V), Isla
Mujeres and Cozumel may be right for you.
Cozumel, while a bit busier than Isla Mujeres, is so laid-back
that the name may as well be the Mayan translation for cozy
and mellow — you deﬁnitely get a tropical-island vibe here.
This town is where you come to take the plunge into scuba
diving; the offshore reefs are top-notch, and the island has
more dive shops than any town on the mainland. If scuba is
too challenging, the snorkeling is great as well. Cozumel’s
days are becoming more lively as its popularity as a cruise
ship port-of-call has grown. When you combine underwater
sights, duty-free shopping, and a little low-key nightlife, you
have yourself a great “Cozymellow” vacation.

sla Mujeres (Island of Women) is a casual, laid-back refuge from the
hyper-commercial action of Cancún, visible across a narrow channel.
This island of white-sand beaches is surrounded by shallow waters for
swimming and complemented by a town filled with pastel-colored clap-
board houses and rustic, open-air seafood restaurants. Just 8km (5 miles)
long and 4km (21⁄2 miles) wide, this fish-shaped island is known as the
best value in the Caribbean, assuming that you favor an easygoing vaca-
tion pace and prefer simplicity to pretense.
Located just 13km (8 miles) northeast of Cancún, “Isla” — as the locals
call it — is a quick boat ride away, making it a popular daytime excur-
sion. However, to fully explore the small village of shops and cafes, relax
at the broad, tranquil Playa Norte, or snorkel or dive El Garrafón Reef (a
national underwater park), you may need more time. Overnight accom-
modations range from rustic to offbeat chic on this small island where
relaxation rules.
Francisco Hernández de Córdoba landed here in 1517 and gave the
island its name upon seeing small statues of partially clad females along
the shore. These objects are now believed to have been offerings to the
Maya goddess of fertility and the moon, Ixchel. Their presence is an indi-
cation that the island was probably sacred to the Maya.
At midday, suntanned visitors hang out in open-air cafes and stroll streets
lined with frantic souvenir vendors. Calling out for attention to their 
bargain-priced wares, the vendors provide a carnival atmosphere to the
hours when tour-boat traffic is at its peak. Befitting the size of the island,
most of the traffic consists of golf carts, motos (also called mopeds), and
bicycles. Once the tour boats leave, however, Isla Mujeres reverts back to
its more typical, tranquil way of life, where taking a siesta in a hammock is
a favored pastime.

In recent years, Isla has seen the emergence of several smaller but decid-
edly upscale places to stay. Anyone wanting the proximity and ease of
arrival that Cancún offers — but not the excesses for which Cancún is
famous — should seriously consider these new options on Isla Mujeres,
where a trip to the mainland is less than an hour if you do choose to
enjoy its shopping or dining. Isla’s budget-priced hotels as well as their
more luxury-oriented offerings both offer excellent values — Isla tends
to be one of the better bargains among Mexico’s resorts. Its location, 
so close to the excellent air access of Cancún, makes this spot a great
choice for travelers wanting an authentic Mexican beach experience 
at a great price.
Settling into Isla Mujeres
Isla Mujeres is so small, it’s easy to get your bearings and find your way
around. If you do happen to need a little guidance, it’s so comfortably
casual that a friendly soul is always around to help you.
The island is about 8km (5 miles) long and 4km (21⁄2 miles) wide, with the
town located at its northern tip. “Downtown” is a compact 4 blocks by 
6 blocks, so it’s very easy to get around. The ferry docks (% 998-877-
0065) are right at the center of town, within walking distance of most
hotels, restaurants, and shops. The street running along the waterfront
is Avenida Rueda Medina, commonly called the malecón. The market
(Mercado Municipal) is by the post office on Calle Guerrero, an inland
street at the north edge of town, which, like most streets in the town, is
unmarked.
Arriving at Isla Mujeres by ferry
To get to Isla Mujeres, you need to first fly into Cancún’s International
Airport (CUN). Once inside the terminal, you enter the immigration
clearance area where you’re asked to show your passport and com-
pleted tourist card, called an FMT (see Chapter 9). Once you claim your
baggage, you exit the terminal, where taxis or other transportation serv-
ices are waiting. (See Chapter 9 for details.)
Puerto Juárez Gran Puerto (% 998-877-0618 for the Isla Mujeres
office), just north of Cancún, is the dock where you catch a 20-minute
passenger ferry to Isla Mujeres. This is the least expensive way to travel
to Isla. The Caribbean Express has storage space for luggage, and costs
about $3.50, running every half-hour between 6:30 a.m. and 10:30 p.m.
Ultramar starts a little earlier, 5 a.m., and also offers two more depar-
tures to Isla Mujeres after 10 p.m., at 11 p.m. and midnight. If your hotel
is close to Playa Tortugas (Pier Turtle Beach), Ultramar also offer depar-
tures from here — near Fat Tuesdays — in the Hotel Zone, but it costs
$15 round-trip as opposed to $6.50 and there are only six departures on
the hour from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Pay at the ticket office — or, if the ferry is
about to leave, you can pay onboard.

When you arrive by taxi or bus to Puerto Juárez, be wary of “guides” who
offer advice and tell you either that the ferry is canceled or that it’s sev-
eral hours until the next departure. They offer the services of a private
lancha (small boat) for about $40 — but it’s nothing but a scam. Small
boats are available and, on a co-op basis, are priced much cheaper — $15
to $25 for a one-way fare, based on the number of passengers. They take
about 50 minutes for the trip over and are not recommended on days with
rough seas. Check with the ticket office for information — this (clearly vis-
ible) office is the only accurate source.
Taxi fares for the trip from Puerto Juárez back to Cancún are now posted
by the street where the taxis park, so be sure to check the rate before
agreeing to ride. Rates generally run $12 to $15, depending upon your
final destination. Local buses also stop in front of Puerto Juárez, which
will take a bit longer to get to the Hotel Zone, but will cost you less than
$1 (on the R-1 bus). Moped and bicycle rentals are readily available as
you depart the ferryboat. This complex also has public bathrooms, lug-
gage storage, a snack bar, and souvenir shops.
Isla Mujeres is so small that a vehicle isn’t necessary, but if you’re taking
one, you have to use the Punta Sam port, just beyond Puerto Juárez.
The ferry runs the 40-minute trips five or six times daily between 8 a.m.
and 8 p.m., year-round except in bad weather. Times are generally as fol-
lows: Cancún to Isla at 8 a.m., 11 a.m., 2:45 p.m., 5:30 p.m., and 8:15 p.m.,
with returns from Isla to Cancún at 6:30 a.m., 9:30 a.m., 12:45 p.m., 
4:15 p.m., and 7:15 p.m.; however, check with the tourist office in Cancún
to verify this schedule. If you’re driving a car, arrive an hour before the
ferry departure to register for a place in line and pay the posted fee,
which varies depending on the weight and type of vehicle. You can find
the only gas pump in Isla at the intersection of Avenida Rueda Medina
and Abasolo Street, just northwest of the ferry docks.
Ferries also travel to Isla Mujeres from the Playa Linda, known as the
Embarcadero pier in Cancún, but they’re less frequent and more expen-
sive than those from Puerto Juárez. A Water Taxi (% 998-886-4270 or
998-886-4847; asterix1@prodigy.net.mx) to Isla Mujeres operates from
Playa Caracol, between the Fiesta Americana Coral Beach Hotel and the
Xcaret terminal on Isla Cancún, with prices about the same as those
from Playa Linda and about four times the cost of the public ferries from
Puerto Juárez. Scheduled departures are 9 a.m., 11 a.m., and 1 p.m., with
returns from Isla Mujeres at noon and 3 p.m. Adult fares are $15; kids
ages 3 to 12 ride for half price, and those under age 3 ride free.
Getting from the ferry dock to your hotel
Ferries arrive at Isla Mujeres’s ferry dock (% 998-877-0065) in the
center of town. The main road that passes in front of the ferry dock is
Avenida Rueda Medina. Tricycle taxis are the least expensive and most
fun way to get to your hotel; you and your luggage pile in the open car-
riage compartment while the driver peddles through the streets. If you
are staying on the southern end of the island, it is more of a trek and
Part IV: Traveling Around Isla Mujeres and Cozumel 
168

you’re better off opting for a car. Regular taxis are always lined up in a
parking lot to the right of the pier, with their rates posted.
If someone on the ferry offers to arrange a taxi for you, politely decline,
unless you’d like some help with your luggage down the short pier — it
just means an extra, unnecessary tip for your helper.
Getting around
A popular form of transportation on Isla Mujeres is the electric golf cart,
available for rent at many hotels for $15 per hour or $45 per day. El Sol
Golf Cart Rental will deliver one to you (% 998-877-0791), or you can
stop by the office at Av. Francisco Madero 5, if you’re just visiting for the
day. The golf carts don’t go more than 20 mph, but they’re fun. And you
don’t come to Isla Mujeres to hurry around. They accept MasterCard
and Visa, with an added 6 percent if you pay by credit card.
Many people enjoy touring the island by moto, the local name for motor-
ized bikes and scooters. Fully automatic versions are available for around
$25 per day or $7 per hour. They come with seats for one person, but
some are large enough for two. There’s only one main road with a couple
of offshoots, so you won’t get lost. Be aware that the rental price doesn’t
include insurance, and any injury to yourself or the vehicle comes out of
your pocket. Bicycles are also available for rent at some hotels for $3 per
hour or $7 per day, including a basket and a lock.
If you prefer to use a taxi, rates are about $2.50 for trips within the
downtown area, or $4.50 for a trip to the southern end of Isla. You can
also rent taxis for about $12 per hour.
Staying on Isla
You can find plenty of hotels in all price ranges on Isla Mujeres. Rates
are at their peak during high season, which is the most expensive and
most crowded time to go. Those interested in private home rentals or
longer-term stays can contact Mundaca Travel and Real Estate on Isla
Mujeres (% 998-877-0025; fax: 998-877-0076; www.mundacatravel.com).
With the exception of a few upscale places to stay along the western
shore of the island, Isla’s hotel offerings are clustered throughout the
downtown area, or along Playa Norte. Although you’ll have to walk to
the beach from the downtown hotels, remember it’s relatively close by,
and getting around is both easy and inexpensive.
As far as prices go, I note rack rates (the maximum that a hotel or resort
charges for a room) for two people spending one night in a double room.
You can usually do better, especially if you’re purchasing a package that
includes airfare. (See Chapter 5 for tips on avoiding paying rack rates.)
Prices quoted here include the 12 percent room tax.
Chapter 12: Isla Mujeres 169

I note all hotels that have air-conditioning, because this feature is not
standard in Isla hotels.
Belmar Hotel
$$
Downtown
Situated in the center of Isla’s small-town activity, above Pizza Rolandi
(consider the restaurant noise), this hotel is run by the same people who
serve up the wood-oven pizzas below. (See the “Dining in Isla Mujeres” sec-
tion later in this chapter for a review.) The 12 simple but stylish rooms
come with two twins or a double bed and tile accents. If you enjoy people-
watching along the pedestrian street and don’t mind a bit of a hike to get
to the beach, this could be just the place for you. Plus, this hotel is one of
the few on the island with televisions that receive U.S. channels in the
room. One large colonial-decorated suite with a whirlpool and a patio is
available.

Cabañas María del Mar
$$
Playa Norte
A good choice for simple accommodations on the beach, the Cabañas
María del Mar is located on the popular Playa Norte. The older two-story
section behind the reception area is closest to the beach, all with two
single or double beds, minifridges, and balconies strung with hammocks
and ocean views. Eleven single-story cabañas are closest to the reception
desk, set amid the lush bougainvillea-filled garden and small pool.
Decorated in a rustic Mexican style, these rooms feature large patios and
come with a minifridge, but they tend to get a bit less light than the other
sections of the hotel. The third section, El Castillo, is no doubt the most
updated, located across the street and built over and beside Buho’s restau-
rant and beach club. Here, white bed loungers and swings at the bar make
it a popular scene for both travelers and locals. El Castillo contains all
“deluxe” rooms with king-size beds, but some are larger than others; the
five rooms on the ground floor all have large patios. Upstairs rooms have
small balconies. All have partial ocean views, flat-screen televisions, and
a predominately white décor. No charge for one child under 5; extra-person
charge for two children under 5.

of the block.

D’Gomar Hotel
$
Downtown
A wall of windows once gave this budget hotel a prime view of the beach
and the many ferries pulling into the pier across the street. Then hurri-
cane Wilma blew into town in 2005 and wrecked havoc. While the hotel
decided to replace these exterior windows with a wall and one window,
making the interiors feel decidedly more “motel-ish,” they completely
remodeled, adding the luxuries of air-conditioning and minifridges in all
18 rooms. Configured with two double beds and a private bathroom, the
rooms are clean and basic, and four feature a balcony and television. The
only drawback is that the hotel has five stories and no elevator. But it’s
conveniently located cater-cornered (look right) from the ferry pier, with
exceptional rooftop views.

Downtown
The Magaña family operates this charming two-story inn built around a
small, shady courtyard. This hotel is very popular with families and sen-
iors, and welcomes many repeat guests. In 2006 everything, from the tiles
on the floor and linens on the bed to the furnishings and windows, was
replaced, making this impeccably clean hotel even more inviting. You’ll
notice the tidy peach-and-white facade of the building from the street. All
27 rooms have a coffeemaker, refrigerator, and toaster, and some of the
rooms also have minikitchens with sinks, air-conditioning, and ocean
views. Most rooms host either a balcony or a patio. Telephone service and
safes are available at the front desk. Kids ages 10 and under stay free, and
those over 10 are charged an additional-person charge of $10.

Ixchel Beach Hotel
$$$$
Playa Norte
The newest addition to this charming island, this chic and edgy condo-
hotel underscores the notion that Isla Mujeres is becoming the “in” place
for a weekend escape. Set on a gorgeous strip of white-sand beach on Playa
Norte, this minimalist and contemporary five-story hotel utilizes high-
quality accents, such as granite countertops and full-size appliances in the
kitchens, natural marble flooring and interesting artwork accents through-
out, and international cable TV, DVD, and CD players. The 48 rooms come
in configurations of a standard, one-bedroom suite or two-bedroom suite.
While all of the rooms are very similar in design, each is individually
owned and may contain some additional amenities. Therefore, some of the
standard rooms come with extras like minifridges, coffeemakers, and
Chapter 12: Isla Mujeres 171

microwaves, but it’s not guaranteed. The standard rooms all have two
double beds, with a sliding window, and now that Phase II of the hotel is
being constructed (which will double the size of the property), these win-
dows no longer host ocean views. It’s worth the small price of an upgrade
to a one-bedroom suite, as the separate living area, patio, and kitchenette
add a ton of light and room to move. It has the feel of a high-end boutique
hotel with a front-desk staff and guest services, wireless Internet, toiletries
in the bathrooms, and a snack bar at the infinity pool — complete with a
shallow area for loungers. Dining can be charged to your room at partner

La Casa de los Sueños Resort & Spa Zenter
$$$$$
Western Coast
This “house of dreams” is easily Isla Mujeres’s most intimate, sophisti-
cated, and relaxing property. It caters to guests looking for a rejuvenating
experience, with its adjoining “Zenter” offering spa services and yoga
classes. Its location on the southern end of the island, adjacent to El
Garrafón National Park, also makes it ideal for snorkeling and diving enthu-
siasts. The captivating design features vivid sherbet-colored walls — think
watermelon, mango, and lemon — and a sculpted architecture. Each
room’s namesake encapsulates a distinct sentiment, such as “Serenity,”
“Passion,” and “Love,” and all indulge guests with large, marble bath-
rooms, and an omnipresent serene style that blends Asian simplicity with
Mexican details. One master suite, ideal for honeymooners, has an excep-
tionally spacious bathroom area, complete with whirlpool and steam room
shower, plus other deluxe amenities.

Na Balam
$$$
Playa Norte
Increasingly, Na Balam is becoming known as a haven for yoga students
or those interested in an introspective vacation. This popular, two-story
hotel near the end of Playa Norte has comfortable rooms on an ideally
located strip of beach. Some rooms face the beach and other slightly
newer accommodations across the street are situated in a garden setting
with a small kidney-shaped swimming pool. All rooms have either a ter-
race or balcony, with hammocks. Guests can enjoy complimentary yoga
classes, and yoga or Pilates retreats are frequently scheduled. (For more,
see the “Exploring your inner self in Isla” sidebar later in this chapter.) The
restaurant, Zazil Ha, is one of the island’s more popular (see the “Dining
in Isla Mujeres” section later in this chapter), serving Mexican and

Posada del Mar
$$
Playa Norte
Simply furnished, quiet, and comfortable, this long-established hotel faces
the water and a wide beach 3 blocks north of the ferry pier, and it has one
of the few swimming pools on the island. This hotel is a good choice for
families, because there are extra touches that cater to their whims, like a
wading pool, a bit of playground equipment, and a palapa pool bar with
snacks and swings, and children under the age of 12 stay free with paying
adults. Pets are also welcome. The three-story building holds 50 basic, yet
ample-sized rooms with either a king-size bed or two double beds, patio or
balcony, air-conditioning and ceiling fans, plus cable TV and telephone.
For the spacious quality of the rooms and the location, this hotel is among
the best values on the island and is very popular, though rumor has it that
the staff can often be “less than gracious.” A wide, seldom-used but appeal-
ing stretch of Playa Norte is across the street, where watersports equip-
ment is available for rent. The restaurant Pinguino (see the “Dining in Isla
Mujeres” section later in this chapter) is by the sidewalk at the front of the
property, and also provides room service. From the pier, go left for 4
blocks; the hotel is on the right.

Secreto
$$$$$
Playa Norte
Sleek and sophisticated, this 12-suite boutique hotel looks like a celebrity
pad on Malibu beach with clean geometric lines and floor-to-ceiling glass
bathing the stark-white interior in light. Euro-lounge music sets the tone
around the 1m-deep (4-ft.) infinity pool surrounded by comfy loungers.
Three suites have patios out to the pool area and are a bit less private, but
they have two double beds as opposed to one king-size. The other nine
suites have floor-to-ceiling glass patio doors that lead to newly expanded
balconies overlooking the pool area and Halfmoon Beach from the com-
fort of outdoor daybeds. All of the rooms boast luxury accouterments like
the finest linens and toiletries, original artwork, a minifridge, flat-screen
satellite TV, DVD, CD player, and, of course, air-conditioning. Secreto is
within walking distance of town, yet feels removed enough to make for an
idyllic, peaceful retreat. Although there’s no on-site restaurant, the hotel
has as arrangement with nearby Pizza Rolandi (see “Dining in Isla
Chapter 12: Isla Mujeres 173

Mujeres,” later in this chapter) for room service. The hotel has its own
boat and divemaster staff for certified scuba training and trips, plus excur-
sions to offshore destinations. Transportation from Cancún airport to the
ferry landing can be arranged on request, for an additional $50 per van
(not per person).

Villa Rolandi Gourmet & Beach Club
$$$$$
Western Coast
Villa Rolandi is an exceptional value, with rooms styled in a Mediterranean
décor that offer every conceivable amenity, as well as its own small, pri-
vate beach in a sheltered cove. Each of the 20 oversize suites has an ocean
view across the infinity pool, with its waterfall that flows over to the cove
below. In late 2006, the hotel unveiled eight new rooms including a two-
story presidential suite with private rooftop deck and dining area. All suites
have large terraces or balconies with full-size private whirlpools. Stone-
tile floors and vaulted ceilings make the air-conditioned rooms feel cool
and spacious, while the recessed seating area adds a touch of comfort with
Italian styling. Floor-to-ceiling patio doors extend to the balcony or ter-
race, and TVs offer satellite music and movies, and a sophisticated in-room
sound system. The newly built spa trumps this in-room hydrotherapy, with
state-of-the-art treatment options. Starting with the relaxation area liter-
ally positioned in a waterfall, one can prepare to be indulged with innova-
tive therapies. Dining is an integral part of a stay at Villa Rolandi. Its owner
is a Swiss-born restaurateur who made a name for himself with his family
of Rolandi restaurants on Isla Mujeres and in Cancún (see the following
section). Only children older than age 13 are welcome.

Dining 0n Isla Mujeres
Dining on Isla — as most everything else — is a casual affair. The most
common options you find are known as cocinas económicas, literally
meaning an “economic kitchen.” Usually aimed at the local population,
these spots are great places to find good food at rock-bottom prices, and
most of them feature regional specialties. But be aware that the standard
of hygiene is not what you’ll find at more established restaurants, so
you’re dining at your own risk. The places I include here cater to a more
established tourist clientele, so although they’re higher priced, they also
offer a much better overall dining experience.
Part IV: Traveling Around Isla Mujeres and Cozumel

Here, even the best restaurants are very casual when it comes to dress.
Any man wearing a jacket would be looked at suspiciously. Ladies, how-
ever, are frequently seen in dressy resort wear — basically, everything
goes, but shorts and T-shirts are typical.
The restaurants I include are arranged alphabetically, with their location
and general price category noted. Remember that tips generally run
about 15 percent, and most waitstaff really depend on these for their
income, so be generous if the service warrants.
Café Cito

CREPES/ICE CREAM/COFFEE/FRUIT DRINKS
Sabina and Luis Rivera own this cute, Caribbean-blue and bright yellow
corner restaurant where you can begin the day with flavorful coffee and a
croissant and cream cheese, or escape midday heat with a hot-fudge
sundae. Terrific crêpes are served with yogurt, ice cream, fresh fruit, or
chocolate sauces, as well as ham and cheese. The two-page ice-cream
menu (available in English) satisfies most any craving, even one for waffles
with ice cream and fruit.

Casa O’s
$$$
ECLECTIC/SEAFOOD
On the road to Garrafón, a stop at this restaurant is a must to work into
your itinerary. This open-air palapa restaurant is often touted to be the
finest on island, with its only competition being that of Casa Rolandi. A
long walkway leads you to waterfront bliss. Pick fresh lobster from an on-
site pond or try the sea bass dripping in garlic butter. The arrachera steak
made with certified Angus beef is a succulent choice, and if you can’t
choose, you can always opt for a combination of fresh seafood and a juicy
steak with the surf ’n turf option. If you want barbecue ribs, call to order
ahead, but most importantly, save room for their signature Key lime pie.
Be prepared to pay to tantalize the taste buds with Casa O’s-so-good food.
It’s one of the priciest places to dine on the island, but worth every penny.

ITALIAN/SEAFOOD
The gourmet Casa Rolandi restaurant and bar has become the favored fine-

most sophisticated menu on island. The main dining area extends out to
open-air terrace seating perfect for drinks or light snacks during the day
Chapter 12: Isla Mujeres 175

or a romantic sunset dinner. While the cuisine here is the most notable on
the island, culinary aficionados will probably find the overall experience
falls short of fine dining, with elevator music setting the mood and some-
what lethargic service. The food is a tad overpriced, but it incorporates
quality ingredients into seafood and northern Italian specialty dishes; the
famed wood-burning oven pizzas are also a good bet. Careful: The wood-
oven baked bread, which arrives looking like a puffer fish, is so divine that
you’re likely to fill up on it!

claim Chimbo’s is their favorite on Playa Norte. Try the delicious fried fish
(a whole one), which comes with rice, beans, and tortillas. You’ll notice a
bandstand and dance floor in the middle of the restaurant; on weekends
after dark, Chimbo’s becomes a lively bar and dance club, drawing a crowd
of drinkers and dancers. (See the “Isla Mujeres after dark” section later in
this chapter.)

Picus
$
COCTELERIA/SEAFOOD
I found out about this little “seafood shack” from a five-star chef who said
this place serves the absolute “best” ceviche around. A stop in this open-
air waterfront locale is a must on a hot day for shrimp cocktail or one of
the seven different types of ceviche paired with a cold beer. It’s covered,
and the “décor” consists of plastic tables and chairs in the sand and two
old men that sometimes play marimbas (xylophone-looking instruments)
in the corner — that is, if a soccer game isn’t on the jury-rigged television
near the ceiling. There are other seafood varieties like fish tacos, whole
fish, and lobster served here, and it’s conveniently located immediately to
the left as you exit the ferry pier. There seems to be a bit of a ceviche
standoff between Picus and a restaurant called Cocteleria Mininos, who
some say clean their shrimp better. However, Mininos was in the midst of
a move during print time, and are planning to reopen farther down the
same street from Picus. Do a taste test. My guess is that you can’t go wrong
either way!

garlic, and secret sauces. The grilled seafood platter is spectacular, and
fajitas are also popular. Breakfasts include fresh fruit, yogurt, and granola,
or sizable platters of eggs served with homemade wheat bread. Both free

Poc-Chuc

YUCATECAN
All of the locals know about this place for the best authentic Yucatecan
food on the island. The bare-bones interior consists of seven wooden
tables topped with plastic tablecloths straight from the ’70s and an open
window from where your food magically appears. The mural of Maya sites
on the wall adds a touch of personality, but quite frankly, when you make
traditional dishes this well for so cheap, who needs fanfare? A great place
for a true Mexican breakfast serving scrambled eggs with Chaya (a Maya
spice), and throughout the day you can get scrumptious panuchos, salbutes,
pollo ticuleño (chicken fried with tomato sauce) and the dish the restau-
rant is named after, poc-chuc, (grilled pork steak marinated in sour orange
and seasonings).

Rolandi’s is practically an institution in Isla and you’re bound to dine at

facade doesn’t grab your attention, the scent from the open kitchen
preparing plate-sized pizzas or calzones are a likely lure. A wood-burning
oven provides the signature flavor of the pizzas, with exotic toppings
including lobster, black mushrooms, pineapple, or Roquefort cheese, as
well as more traditional tomatoes, olives, basil, and salami. The extensive
menu also offers a selection of salads and light appetizers, along with an
ample array of pasta dishes, steaks, fish, and scrumptious desserts. The
setting is the open courtyard of the Belmar Hotel, with a porch overlook-
ing the action on Hidalgo Street.

Restaurant Bar Amigos
$
MEXICAN/ITALIAN
The minute that you step into this small and skinny restaurant, you’ll real-

Isla Mujeres. Bright lighting puts a damper on any sense of ambience, not
to mention noise from an open kitchen at the back; however, the food is
tasty and affordable, and the service proves incredibly friendly. If possi-
ble, opt for the tables on the pedestrian walk of Hidalgo, where you can
munch on Mexican favorites like tacos with chicken and cheese, a platter
of grilled steak asada served with guacamole, beans, fried bananas, flautas,
and a quesadilla, or Punta de Res a la Mexicana, which is hearty chunks of
beef swimming in a tomato, onion, and green pepper sauce sided by fried
tortillas for dipping. With all of these excellent Mexican options, one
wouldn’t think that the pizzas and Italian specialties like thinly sliced red
snapper carpaccio would be such a hit. Here, there are plenty of options
and none will leave you walking away hungry or dissatisfied.

SEAFOOD
One of the newest restaurants on Isla Mujeres, Sunset Grill opened its doors
in December 2006. This “luxury” palapa’s high thatched ceiling employs
beautiful Maya woods, contemporary lighting and mosaic tile detailing. The
German and Colombian owners brought in four chefs (clad in white chefs’
jackets and hats) to develop four professional and diverse menus. Seafood
is Sunset Grill’s forte, but they also serve Mexican specialties and other
international dishes. The Gourmet Menu is a tasting menu that changes
daily, serving a starter, main, and dessert for a bargain price of $15. Other
popular choices include the coconut shrimp served with mango chutney,
black grouper, or tuna steak. Whatever you decide, make sure to save room
for a slice of Key lime pie for dessert. While the atmosphere may sound a
bit formal, it is decidedly laid-back and hands down the best place to enjoy
a meal or drinks at sunset — especially at the outdoor plastic umbrella
tables where you can sink your toes into the sand.

is enhanced by the food — terrific pasta with garlic, shrimp in tequila

specialties include coconut sailfish, jerk chicken, and stuffed squid. The
vegetarian menu is complemented by a selection of fresh juices, and even
a special menu is available for those participating in yoga retreats. On the
opposite end of the spectrum, you can enjoy a juicy rib-eye steak, which
is one of the priciest items on the menu for $28. Between the set hours for
meals, you can have all sorts of enticing food, such as vegetable and fruit
drinks, tacos and sandwiches, ceviche, and terrific nachos. It’s likely you’ll
stake this place out for several meals before you leave.

Fun On and Off the Beach in Isla Mujeres
Days in Isla can alternate between adventurous activity and absolute
repose. Trips to the Isla Contoy bird sanctuary are popular, as is taking
advantage of the excellent diving, fishing, and snorkeling — in 1998, the
island’s coral coast was made part of Mexico’s new Marine National Park.
In the evenings, most people find the slow, casual pace one of the island’s
biggest draws. The cool night breeze is a perfect accompaniment to
casual, open-air dining and drinking in small street-side restaurants. Most
people turn in as early as 9 or 10 p.m., when most businesses close. Those
in search of a party, however, can find kindred souls at the bars on Playa
Norte, which stay open late.
Isla’s best beaches
The most popular beach in town used to be called Playa Cocoteros
(“Cocos,” for short). Then, in 1988, Hurricane Gilbert destroyed the
coconut palms on the beach. Gradually, the name has changed to Playa
Norte, referring to the long stretch of beach that extends around the
northern tip of the island, to your left as you get off the boat. This beach
is splendid — a wide stretch of fine white sand and calm, translucent,
turquoise-blue water — and is definitely where you want to go to rack up
serious beach time. Topless sunbathing is permitted, and the row of bor-
dering beach bars adds to the festive atmosphere. You can easily reach
the beach on foot from the ferry and from all downtown hotels. You can
also rent watersports equipment, beach umbrellas, and lounge chairs.
The umbrellas and chairs in front of restaurants usually cost nothing if
you use the restaurant as your headquarters for drinks and food. New
palms have grown back all over Playa Norte, and it won’t be long before
it deserves to get its old name back.
Garrafón National Park is known best as a snorkeling area, but a nice
stretch of beach is on either side of this park, which now offers food
service, diving platforms, and a full range of affiliated services for one
admission fee (see the following section). Playa Lancheros is on the
Chapter 12: Isla Mujeres 179

Caribbean side of Laguna Makax. Local buses go to Lancheros and then
turn inland and return to downtown. The beach at Playa Lancheros is
nice, but the few restaurants there are high-priced.
Wide Playa Norte is the best swimming beach, with Playa Lancheros
second. No lifeguards are on duty on Isla Mujeres, and the system of
water-safety flags used in Cancún and Cozumel isn’t used here.
Deep-blue explorations in Isla
By far the most popular place to snorkel is Garrafón National Park, at
the southern end of the island, where you can see numerous schools of
colorful fish. The well-equipped park has beach chairs, a swimming pool,
kayaks, changing rooms, rental lockers, showers, a gift shop, and snack
bars. A public national underwater park since late 1999, Garrafón has
been operated by the same people who manage Xcaret, south of Cancún.
Public facilities have been vastly improved, with new attractions and
facilities added each year. Activities at the park include snorkeling and
Snuba (a tankless version of scuba diving, in which you descend while
breathing through a long air tube), crystal-clear canoes for viewing
underwater life, and a zip line that takes you over the water. The under-
water mini-sub Sea Trek provides a great view of the submarine land-
scape while you stay dry, if that’s your preference. On land, they have
tanning decks, shaded hammocks, an 11m (38-ft.) climbing tower, and —
of course! — a souvenir superstore. Several restaurants and snack bars
are available. You can also choose from various packages such as the
Garrafón Discovery for $65 for adults and $49 for children, which
includes food, beverages, zip line, locker rental, snorkeling gear, kayak
rental, and a shopping tour. All packages include round-trip transporta-
tion (% 998-884-9422 or 998-849-4950 in Cancún and 998-877-1100 or
998-877-1108 at the park).
Also good for snorkeling is the Manchones Reef, where a bronze cross
was installed in 1994. The reef is just offshore and can be reached by
boat.
Another excellent location is around the lighthouse (el faro) in the Bahía
de Mujeres at the southern tip of the island, where the water is about
2m (6 ft.) deep. Boatmen will take you for around $25 per person if you
have your own snorkeling equipment, or $30 if you use theirs.
Several dive shops have opened on the island, most offering the same
trips. Bahía Dive Shop, on Rueda Medina 166, across from the car-ferry
dock (% 998-877-0340), is a full-service shop with dive equipment 
for sale or rent, and resort and certification classes. The shop is open
daily 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. and accepts Visa and MasterCard only. Another
respected dive shop is Coral Scuba Center (% 998-877-0061 or 998-
877-0763), located at Matamoros 13A and Rueda Medina. It offers dis-
counted prices for those who bring their own gear, and it also has rental
bungalows available for short-term and long-term stays.
Part IV: Traveling Around Isla Mujeres and Cozumel

Cuevas de los Tiburones (Caves of the Sleeping Sharks) is Isla’s most
renowned dive site — but the name is slightly misleading, because shark
sightings are rare these days. Two sites where you could traditionally
see the sleeping sharks were the Cuevas de Tiburones and La Punta, but
the sharks have obviously moved on to a more secluded site — after all,
would you want to have dozens of gawkers watching you snooze? Sharks
have no gills and so must constantly move to receive the oxygen they
need. (Remember the line in Annie Hall equating relationships to sharks:
“They must constantly move forward or die”?) The phenomenon here is
that the high salinity and lack of carbon monoxide in the caves, com-
bined with strong and steady currents, allow the sharks to receive the
oxygen they need without moving. Your chance of actually seeing sleep-
ing sharks is about one in four. The best time to see them, though, is
from January to March.
Other dive sites include a wreck 9km (15 miles) offshore; Banderas Reef,
between Isla Mujeres and Cancún, where there’s always a strong current;
Tabos Reef on the eastern shore; and Manchones Reef, 1km (11⁄2 miles)
off the southeastern tip of the island, where the water is 5m to 11m 
(15 ft.–35 ft.) deep. Another underwater site, “The Cross of the Bay,” is
close to Manchones Reef. A bronze cross, weighing 1 ton and standing
12m (39 ft.) high, was placed in the water between Manchones and Isla
in 1994, as a memorial to those who have lost their lives at sea. The best
season for diving is from June to August, when the water is calm.
To arrange a day of fishing, ask at the Sociedad Cooperativa Turística
(the boatmen’s cooperative) located on Avenida Rueda Medina (no
phone), next to Mexico Divers and Las Brisas restaurant. You can share
the cost with four to six others, and it includes lunch and drinks. Captain
Tony Martínez (% 998-877-0274) also arranges fishing trips aboard his
lancha, Marinonis, with advance reservations recommended. Year-round,
you can find bonito, mackerel, kingfish, and amberjack. Sailfish and sharks
(hammerhead, bull, nurse, lemon, and tiger) are in good supply in April
and May. In winter, larger grouper and jewfish are prevalent. Four hours of
fishing close to shore costs around $110; eight hours farther out goes for
$250. The cooperative is open from Monday to Saturday 8 a.m. to 1 p.m.
and 5 to 8 p.m., and Sunday 7:30 to 10 a.m. and 6 to 8 p.m.
You can swim with dolphins at Dolphin Discovery, located at Treasure
Island, on the side of Isla Mujeres that faces Cancún. Swims take place in
groups of six people with two dolphins and one trainer. First, swimmers
listen to an educational video and spend time in the water with the
trainer and the dolphins before enjoying 15 minutes of free swimming
time with them. Reservations are recommended, and you must arrive an
hour before your assigned swimming time, at 10:30 a.m., noon, 2 p.m., or
3:30 p.m. Make your reservations in Cancún at % 998-849-4757, toll-free

and $69 for children under 12; Dolphin Swim Adventure is $99 per
Chapter 12: Isla Mujeres 181

person; and Royal Swim is $139 per person, plus $10 if round-trip trans-
portation from Cancún is required. Pregnant women and children under
1 year of age not permitted.
A very worthwhile outing on the island is to a Turtle Sanctuary, dedi-
cated to preserving Caribbean sea turtles and to educating the public
about them. As recently as 20 years ago, fishermen converged on the
island nightly from May to September, waiting for these monster-size 
turtles to lumber ashore to deposit their Ping-Pong ball–shaped eggs.
Totally vulnerable once they begin laying their eggs and exhausted when
they have finished, the turtles were easily captured and slaughtered for
their highly prized meat, shell, and eggs. Then a concerned fisherman,
Gonzalez Cahle Maldonado, began convincing others to spare at least
the eggs, which he protected. It was a start. Following his lead, the fish-
ing secretariat founded this Centro de Investigaciones ten years ago;
both the government and private donations help to support it. Since
then, at least 28,000 turtles have been released, and every year local
schoolchildren participate in the event, thus planting the notion of pro-
tecting the turtles for a new generation of islanders.
Six different species of sea turtles nest on Isla Mujeres. An adult green
turtle, the most abundant species, measures 1m to 2m (4 ft.–5 ft.) in
length and can weigh as much as 450 pounds when grown. At the center,
visitors walk through the indoor and outdoor turtle pool areas, where
the creatures paddle around. The turtles are separated by age, from
newly hatched up to 1 year. Besides protecting the turtles that nest on
Isla Mujeres of their own accord, the program also captures turtles at
sea, brings them to enclosed compounds to mate, and later frees them
to nest on Isla Mujeres after they’ve been tagged. People who come here
usually end up staying at least an hour, especially if they opt for the
guided tour, which I recommend. The sanctuary is on a piece of land
separated from the island by Bahía de Mujeres and Laguna Makax (see
map p. 167); you need a taxi to get there. Admission is $3; the shelter is
open daily 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. For more information, call % 998-877-0595.
Sightseeing and shopping in Isla
Also at Punta Sur, the southern point of the island, just inland from
Garrafón National Park (% 998-877-1100 or 998-877-1108 and toll-free
800-417-1736 in U.S.; www.garrafon.com) and part of the Park, is Isla’s
newest attraction, the Panoramic Tower (see the “Isla Mujeres” map on
p. 167). At 50m (225 ft.) high, the tower offers visitors a bird’s-eye view
of the entire island. The tower holds 20 visitors at a time, and rotates for
ten minutes while you can snap photos or simply enjoy the scenery.
Entry fee is $5, a professional photo of you at the tower (touch-ups are
included!) is $10, and package prices are available.
Nearby, you’ll find Sculptured Spaces, an impressive and extensive
garden of large sculptures donated to Isla Mujeres by internationally
renowned sculptors as part of the 2001 First International Sculpture
Part IV: Traveling Around Isla Mujeres and Cozumel 
182

Exhibition. Among Mexican sculptors represented are works by Jose
Luis Cuevas and Vlaadimir Cora.
Just before Sculptured Spaces, you’ll walk through the Caribbean
Village, with colorful clapboard buildings that house cafes and shops
displaying folkloric art. Plan to have lunch or a snack here at the kiosk
and stroll around, before heading on to the lighthouse and Maya ruins.
Just beyond the lighthouse, at the southern end of the island, are the
strikingly beautiful remains of a small Maya temple, believed to have
been built to pay homage to the moon and fertility goddess, Ixchel. From
the ticket booth it doesn’t look like much, but the location, on a lofty
bluff overlooking the sea, is worth seeing and makes a great place for
photos. (There’s a trail that descends from the precipice.) It’s believed
that Maya women traveled here on annual pilgrimages to seek Ixchel’s
blessings of fertility. If you’re at Garrafón National Park and want to
walk, it’s not too far. Turn right from Garrafón. When you see the light-
house, turn toward it down the rocky path.
Also at this southern point of the island, and part of the ruins, is Cliff of
the Dawn, the southeastern-most point of Mexico. The site is open from
7 a.m. to 8 p.m.; if you make it there early enough to see the sun rise, you
can claim you were the first person in Mexico that day to be touched by
the sun!
The Fortress of Mundaca is about 4km (21⁄2 miles) in the same direction
as Garrafón, about half a mile to the left. (See the “Isla Mujeres” map on
p. 167.) The fortress was built by a slave trader who claimed to have
been the pirate Mundaca Marecheaga. In the early 19th century, he
arrived at Isla Mujeres and proceeded to set up a blissful paradise in 
a pretty, shady spot, while making money selling slaves to Cuba and
Belize. According to island lore, he decided to settle down and build this
hacienda after being captivated by the charms of an island girl. However,
she reputedly spurned his affections and married another islander, leav-
ing him heartbroken and alone on Isla Mujeres. Admission is $2, and the
fortress is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
If you’re interested in natural attractions, put a visit to Isla Contoy at the
top of your list of things to do. This pristine uninhabited island, 31km
(19 miles) by boat from Isla Mujeres, was set aside as a national wildlife
reserve in 1981. The oddly shaped 6km-long (33⁄4-mile) isle is covered in
lush vegetation and harbors 70 species of birds, as well as a host of
marine and animal life. Bird species that nest on the island include peli-
cans, brown boobies, frigates, egrets, terns, and cormorants. Flocks of
flamingos arrive in April. June, July, and August are good months to spot
turtles burying their eggs in the sand at night.
Most excursions here troll for fish (which will be your lunch), anchor en
route for a snorkeling expedition, and skirt the island at a leisurely pace
for close viewing of the birds without disturbing the habitat, and then
pull ashore. While the captain prepares lunch, visitors can swim, sun,
Chapter 12: Isla Mujeres 183

follow the nature trails, and visit the fine nature museum. For a while, the
island was closed to visitors, but it has reopened following an agreement
that fishermen and those bringing visitors will follow a set of rules for its
use and safety. The trip from Isla Mujeres takes about 45 minutes one-
way, more if the sea is choppy. Because of the tight-knit boatmen’s coop-
erative, prices for this excursion are the same everywhere: $42 for adults
and $21 for children. You can buy a ticket at the Sociedad Cooperativa
Turística located on Avenida Rueda Medina (next to Mexico Divers and
Las Brisas restaurant), or at one of several travel agencies, such as La
Isleña Tours, on Morelos between Medina and Juárez (% 998-877-0578).
La Isleña is open daily from 7:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. and is a good source 
for tourist information. Contoy trips leave at 8:30 a.m. and return around
4 p.m. Cash is the only accepted form of payment.
Boat captains should respect the cooperative’s regulations regarding
ecological sensitivity and boat safety, including the availability of life
jackets for everyone on board. Snorkeling equipment is usually included
in the price, but double-check that before heading out. On the island,
you’ll find a small government museum with bathroom facilities.
Let me put it simply — you’d never come to Isla for the shopping experi-
ence. Shopping, as everything else in Isla, is quite a casual affair, with
only a few shops of any sophistication. More typically, you’re bom-
barded by shop owners, especially on Hidalgo, selling the whole gamut
of tourist kitsch including saltillo rugs, onyx, silver, Guatemalan clothing,
blown glassware, masks, folk art, beach paraphernalia, and T-shirts in
abundance. Prices are lower here than in Cancún or Cozumel, but with
the over-eager sellers, bargaining is necessary to avoid paying too much.
The one treasure you’re likely to take back is a piece of fine jewelry —
Isla is known for its excellent, duty-free prices on gemstones and hand-
crafted work made to order. You can purchase diamonds, emeralds, sap-
phires, and rubies as loose stones and then have them mounted while

Exploring your inner self in Isla
Increasingly, Isla is becoming known as a great place to combine a relaxing beach
vacation with various types of yoga practice and instruction. The impetus for this trend
began at Na Balam hotel (% 998-877-0279; www.nabalam.com), where yoga
classes are offered under its large poolside palapa. The classes, which take place
from Monday to Friday beginning at 9 a.m., are free to guests, or $10 per class to vis-
itors. Na Balam is also the site of frequent yoga instruction vacations, featuring
respected yoga teachers, and a more extensive practice schedule. Local yoga cul-
ture extends down the island to more luxurious Casa de los Sueños Resort and Spa
Zenter (% 998-877-0651; www.casadelossuenosresort.com), where yoga
classes, as well as Qigong and Pilates, are regularly held as well as a variety of body
treatments and massages.

you’re off exploring the island. The superbly crafted gold, silver, and
gems are available at very competitive prices in the workshops near the
central plaza. The stones are also available in the rough. Rachat & Rome
(% 998-877-0331 or 998-877-0299) is the grandest jewelry store, with a
broad selection of jewelry at competitive prices. Located at the corner
of Morelos and Juárez streets, it’s easily the largest store in Isla, open
daily 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.; it accepts all major credit cards.
Isla Mujeres after dark
Those in a party mood by day’s end may want to start out at the beach
bar of the Na Balam hotel on Playa Norte, which many nights hosts a
crowd until around midnight. On Saturday and Sunday, live music plays
between 4 and 7 p.m. Las Palapas Chimbo’s restaurant on the beach
becomes a jammin’ dance joint on weekends with a live band or DJ from
9 p.m. until whenever. Farther along the same stretch of beach, Buho’s,
the restaurant/beach bar of the Cabañas María del Mar, is a popular, low-
key daytime hangout, complete with sun daybeds or loungers and
umbrellas for rent until 5 p.m. Or, grab a swinging seat at the bar until 
11 p.m. Pinguino in the Hotel Posada del Mar offers a convivial late-night
hangout, where a band plays nightly during high season from 9 p.m. to
midnight. Om Bar and Chill Lounge, on Calle Matamoros, serves beer
on tap at each table, in a jazzy atmosphere. For a late-night dance club,
Club Nitrox, on Avenida Guererro, is open Wednesday to Sunday from 
9 p.m. to 3 a.m. Pocna, a hostel, restaurant, and bar, carries the torch for
“round-the-clock” entertainment, with volleyball by day and a packed
open-air beach bar until wee hours of the morning; here you’ll find both
locals and tourists drinking $1.50 cervezas while dancing barefoot in the
sand. Av. Matamoros 15.

C
ozumel was a well-known diving spot before Cancún even existed,
and it has ranked for years among the top-five dive destinations in
the world. Tall reefs lining the island’s southwest coast create towering
walls that offer divers a fairy-tale landscape to explore. For nondivers,
Cozumel has the beautiful waters of the Caribbean with all the accompa-
nying watersports and seaside activities. Because the island is also a
popular cruise-ship port, you find lots of duty-free shopping here. When
the cruise ships are gone, Cozumel has a get-away-from-it-all feel —
roads that don’t go very far, lots of mopeds, few buses and trucks, and a
certain sense of separation. The island is 19km (12 miles) from the main-
land, and the name comes from the Mayan word Cuzamil, meaning “Land
of the Swallows.”
Getting to Cozumel
Nothing could be simpler than arriving to the island and getting around
the place. The airport is small and presents no surprises. The island
layout is easy to understand. And if you rent a car, it’s not like you have
many roads to choose from.
By air
Because of the popularity of package vacations, more international char-
ter flights fly to the island than regularly scheduled commercial flights.
You may want to inquire about buying a ticket from one of the travel
packagers, such as Funjet or Apple Vacations, that do most of the char-
tering. (See Chapter 6 for more information.) Some packagers work with
a wide variety of Cozumel’s hotels — even some of the smaller inde-
pendent ones; others allow you to buy a ticket without making it part of
a package.

Chapter 13: Cozumel 189

Direct international flights to Cozumel include Aeromexico to and from
Atlanta, Continental to and from Houston and Newark, US Airways
to and from Charlotte, and American Airlines to and from Dallas.
Aerocozumel, a Mexicana affiliate, has flights to and from Cancún.
Mexicana flies from Mexico City (other international flights connect
through Mexico City). Frontier flies to and from Denver.
Knowing what to expect when you arrive
Cozumel’s airport is small enough to eliminate any chance for confusion.
When you walk through the main building, the lines for Immigration are
right in front of you. Since 2007, the U.S. government has required
Americans to travel with a passport, even if traveling just to Mexico. No
longer can proof of citizenship be enough to get back into the U.S. On
the plane to Cozumel, you’ll receive a Mexican immigration form to fill
out. Most people miss the fact that they have to sign it on the back in
two different places. Doing so prevents holdups in the line.
When you receive your Mexican tourist permit (FMT), keep it with your
passport in a safe place. You’re supposed to keep this permit with you in
case of emergency. You also need to turn it in upon departure, or you
may be unable to leave without first getting a replacement.
After Immigration, you pass through Customs. They ask you to push a
button, which randomly triggers either a green light or a red light. If it’s
green, you go right through. If it’s red, the Customs inspectors will ask to
look into your bags. Some people actually enjoy starting off their vaca-
tion with a little game of chance.
Getting from the airport to your hotel
Cozumel’s airport is immediately inland from the island’s only town, San
Miguel. If you’re picking up a rental car, the counters are along a short
hallway to the left of the airport exit. Both Avis (% 987-872-0099) and
Executive (% 987-872-1308) have staff there. Otherwise, you’ll want 
to buy a ticket for a cab. A counter at the exit reads “Transportes
Terrestres.” This company provides transportation to all the hotels 
in air-conditioned Suburbans. To hotels downtown, the fare is $7 per
person; to hotels along the north shore, it’s $9; and to hotels along the
south shore, it’s $12 and up.
By sea
Cozumel is a large island across from Playa del Carmen, 19km (12 miles)
off the Yucatán coast. Passenger ferries travel to and from Playa del
Carmen. See Chapter 14 for more on Playa del Carmen.
Taking the passenger ferry from Playa del Carmen
Barcos México (% 987-872-1508 or 987-872-1588) and Ultramar (% 987-
869-2775) operate ferries between Playa and Cozumel. You’ll arrive in
Cozumel at the municipal dock, 1 block from the town’s main square.

The trip takes 30 to 45 minutes, depending on the boat and the weather.
It costs $11 one-way, and the boats are enclosed and air-conditioned;
some also have outdoor decks. In Playa del Carmen, the ferry dock is 
11⁄2 blocks from the main square and the bus station. Since Hurricane
Wilma in 2005, the departure schedules have been changing every few
months. For the most part, there has been a departure every hour in the
morning and every two hours in the afternoon. Check the departure
time at the docks, especially the time of the last returning ferry if that’s
the one you intend to use. Storage for luggage is available at the
Cozumel dock for $2 per day.
Taking the car ferry from Puerto Calica
The car ferry to Cozumel from Puerto Calica (8km/5 miles south of Playa
del Carmen) takes about an hour and costs about $50 for one-way trans-
port of a standard car. For most travelers it’s of little use because you
can rent cars when you get to the island for about the same price as on
the mainland. This ferry arrives in Cozumel at the International Pier just
south of town, near La Ceiba Hotel.
Note: To take a vehicle on the ferry, arrive an hour in advance of the
ferry’s departure to purchase a ticket and to get in line. The schedule for
boats to Cozumel is daily at 4 a.m., 8 a.m., 1:30 p.m., and 6 p.m., but it’s a
good idea to call the company, Marítima Chankanaab (% 987-872-7671),
to double-check.
Getting around Cozumel
The island of Cozumel is 45km (28 miles) long and 18km (11 miles) wide. 
A road runs along its western shore. Where the road passes along the
waterfront of the island’s only town, it’s known as Avenida Rafael Melgar.
Outside of town, it has several names: North of town it’s called Santa Pilar
or San Juan; south of town it’s called Costera Sur. It eventually reaches
the southern tip of the island (Punta Sur). Another road cuts across the
island to the undeveloped east coast. It’s called Carretera Transversal.
When it gets to the ocean, it turns south and goes all the way to the south-
ern tip where it meets the Costera Sur road.
The town of San Miguel is on the west coast. Despite the development
over the last 20 years, it’s still a small town. Running parallel to the
coastal road, Avenida Rafael Melgar (north–south) are avenidas num-
bered in multiples of five — 5, 10, 15, and so on. The main east–west
street is Avenida Juárez, which starts at the passenger-ferry dock and
the main square, and heads east, crossing town before becoming the
Carretera Transversal. It divides the north–south avenidas into northern
and southern halves, so that you have Avenida 5 Norte (north) and
Avenida 5 Sur (south). The streets (calles) that run east and west, paral-
lel to Avenida Juárez, are even-numbered north of Juárez (2, 4, 6, and so
on) and are odd-numbered south of Juárez (1, 3, 5, and so on) with the
one exception of Calle Rosado Salas, which runs between calles 1 and 3.
Part IV: Traveling Around Isla Mujeres and Cozumel 
192

When driving around town, keep in mind that the avenidas running
north–south have the right of way, and traffic doesn’t slow down or stop
(except when intersecting Juárez). You often won’t see a stop sign.
Here is a brief rundown of your transportation choices in Cozumel:
 Taking taxis: Cozumel has a wealth of taxis and a strong taxi-
driver union. Fares are standardized — so don’t attempt to bargain.
Sample fares for two people (expect an additional charge for extra
passengers) include island tour, $60; from town to southern hotel
zone, $7 to $20; from town to northern hotels, $5 to $6; from town
to Chankanaab National Park (see the “Visiting the nature parks”
section later in this chapter), $7; and in and around town, $3 to $4.
It isn’t customary to tip taxi drivers in Mexico unless the driver
helps with luggage or acts as a tour guide.
 Renting cars: Driving around the island is easy. The only paved
roads are those described in the previous section, and these roads
take you to just about all the worthwhile places on the island.
There’s no point in leaving the pavement unless you’re just feeling
adventurous. Rental rates vary according to demand. An economy
car can go for as little as $35 in low season and for as much as $80 in
high season. The local agency numbers are Avis (% 987-872-0219);
Budget (% 987-872-5177); Dollar (% 987-872-1196); Executive 
(% 987-872-1308); Hertz (% 987-872-5979); and National (% 987-
872-3263).
 Renting mopeds: Moped rentals are available all over town and at
the big hotels. They cost anywhere from $20 to $35 for 24 hours,
depending upon the season. If you decide to use this mode of trans-
port, be careful. Riding a moped made a lot more sense when
Cozumel had less traffic; now, thanks to Cozumel’s numerous,
pushy motorists, it’s a risky proposition. Moped accidents easily
rank as the highest cause of injury in Cozumel. Before renting a
moped, give it a careful inspection to see that all the gizmos are in
good shape — horn, light, starter, seat, mirror — and be sure to
note any existing damage to the moped on the rental agreement.
I’ve been given mopeds that had unbalanced tires and would
wobble above 15 mph, but I was able to replace them with better
mopeds with no questions asked. Riding a moped without a helmet
outside of town is illegal (subject to a $25 fine).
 Walking around on foot: The town of San Miguel is small enough
for walking, which is helpful when pub crawling. Few places are far
enough away to warrant a cab ride.
Staying in Cozumel
Almost all of Cozumel’s hotels are on the western coast of the island,
which faces mainland Mexico. This side is also where the island’s only
town, San Miguel, is located. This coast is sheltered from the open water
Chapter 13: Cozumel 193

and has little surf, which makes it perfect for swimming. The hotels and
B&Bs in town tend to be the most economical properties on the island.
Staying in town can be both entertaining and convenient, although the
hotels in this area tend to be smaller and older. If you choose to stay
here, a number of stores, dive shops, travel agencies, restaurants, and
nightspots are within easy walking distance. To get to a beach, you need
to take a taxi. A few small beaches are nearby for you to enjoy.
But if the most you want to do is hang out around the pool with the
occasional dip into the Caribbean, you’ll want one of the beach hotels
either north or south of town. Most of the beaches on the southern
coast are nicer than the ones on the northern coast.
All the northern hotels are lined up in close proximity on the ocean side
of the road next to the golf course and a short distance from town and
the airport. The hotels to the south of town are closer to the popular
Chankanaab National Park and tend to be more spread out. Some are 
on the inland side of the road, and some are on the ocean side, making
for a difference in price. The properties farthest away from town are 
all-inclusives.
Finding the place that’s right for you
If you’re vacationing with your family and want to economize, consider
all-inclusive hotels or condo/villa rentals. Both types of lodging allow
you to cut costs, but they make for different vacations. Condos usually
rent by the week, all-inclusives by the day. If your main goal is to be
bone idle and to not work on anything harder than your tan while the
kids romp in the pool, then go with an all-inclusive. But if you enjoy
striking out on your own and engaging the locals in common activities
such as purchasing groceries, go for renting a condo.
Choosing to stay at an all-inclusive — if you reserve through one of the
large packagers such as Apple Vacations or FunJet (see Chapter 6) —
means you pay one lump price for plane ticket, lodging, food, and drink.
You pay extra for whatever tours, diving, and incidentals you decide to
purchase.
A few things to remember about all-inclusive hotels:
 They operate on narrow profit margins and large volume, so they’re
usually close to full-capacity in high season. This fact can make it
hard to avoid crowds for a little peace and quiet.
 On the other hand, they have plenty of activities for both adults
and kids. They try to increase their profit margins by charging a
little more for activities such as diving. But it may be worth the
convenience to pay a little extra.
 They make for an easy vacation in which most things, such as
entertainment and food, require a minimum of effort on your part.
Part IV: Traveling Around Isla Mujeres and Cozumel 
194

 You tend to be isolated and not get much of a feel for the island or
the people.
Renting a condo or an apartment can save you money by avoiding dining
out. This way, you also get more privacy. But you’ll most likely want to
rent a car for trips to the grocery store and for other errands, which is
something you need to remember when budgeting. For most first-time
visitors to the island, you’re probably better off staying at a hotel so that
you don’t have to get your bearings immediately and you can enjoy get-
ting acquainted with the island at a more relaxing pace.
Checking out Cozumel’s best hotels
The prices I quote here are for rack rates (the full rate without discounts)
for two people spending one night in a double room. You can usually do
better, especially if you’re purchasing a package that includes airfare.
(See Chapter 6 for tips on avoiding paying rack rates.) Prices quoted here
include the 12 percent room tax. All hotels have air-conditioning unless
otherwise indicated. Rates for the week between Christmas and New
Years are often higher than the rest of high season.
Because Cozumel is such a big destination for divers, all the large hotels
and many small ones offer dive packages. I don’t mention this fact in the
reviews, but ask about them if you plan to do a lot of diving. All the large
waterfront hotels have dive shops on the premises and a pier, so I don’t
mention these amenities either. But if you prefer staying at a particular
hotel while using a different dive operator, no one is going to say any-
thing. Any dive boat can pull up to any hotel pier to pick up customers.
Most dive shops don’t pick up from the hotels north of town, so it’s best
to dive with the in-house operator at these hotels.

Condos (Avenida 10 Sur 124, 77600 Cozumel, Q. Roo; % 00-224-5551 in

accommodations by the week.
El Cozumeleño
$$$$–$$$$$
North of town
This is a popular all-inclusive hotel located not far from town on a pretty
part of the north shore. It’s a good choice for active sorts who like to get
out and do things. One of the hotel’s strong points is that its staff coordi-
nates a lot of activities for its guests. For the not-so-active types, the hotel
has a large and stunning pool and patio area where you can plop down on
a lounger and not move a muscle all day. Unlike the other all-inclusives
reviewed in this chapter, this hotel is not built in the model of a resort vil-
lage. Instead, it occupies a nine-story building, with every guest room
having a view of the ocean. Half the building is a recent addition. Rooms
in the original tower are much longer than they are wide and have a
slightly awkward furniture arrangement. All rooms are large and have bal-
conies. You have a choice of a king-size or two double beds. Beyond the
Chapter 13: Cozumel 195

massive pool is a small sand beach, and a little bit to the south are some
rocky areas where you can snorkel and spot some fish. This is an all-inclusive
property so rates include food and drink. As with other all-inclusives, you
get a better deal buying through an agent than going directly to the hotel.

Iberostar Cozumel
$$$$–$$$$$
South of town
Just south of the Occidental Grand (see review later in this section),
almost at the end of the island, is this all-inclusive hotel laid out much like
its neighbors: one- and two-story buildings, each holding between four and
eight units, surround a large common area of pools, a snack bar, and the
beach. Also, like the Occidental properties, this hotel is operated by a
Spanish company that mastered the business of running all-inclusives on
the Spanish coast. It has sister properties on the Yucatán mainland, but
this is the smallest of the company’s Mexican properties. It closed after
the hurricanes but reopened in early February 2006. Among the changes
are expanded and improved dining areas. Iberostar does a good job with
the food and the service, which is why I think it’s a step up from most of
the other all-inclusives. The tropical foliage that graced the resort’s
grounds took a hit, but it has been coming back in the past year. The guest
rooms have been improved. They are medium-sized and well equipped and
come with a terrace or porch equipped with hammocks. The bathrooms
are ample, well lit, and come with showers. There was one benefit from
these hurricanes: They shifted a lot of sand onto the property’s beach,
making it larger and more attractive.

La Casona Real
$
In town
Formerly the Hotel del Centro, this hotel has been completely remodeled
and is under new management. It’s located five long blocks from the water-
front. The rooms are small but modern, air-conditioned, and clean. They
come with two double beds or one king-size (which costs $10 less). A small
courtyard with an oval pool makes for a lovely place to relax. From the
plaza, head straight down Juárez; when you get to Avenida. 25, it’s on your
left. There is some traffic noise in front and on the street side of the build-
ing; the rooms facing the interior courtyard are quieter.

Occidental Grand Cozumel
$$$$
South of town
This property and its older sister, the Occidental Allegro Cozumel (both
all-inclusive), are parts of a chain with several hotels across the way, on
the mainland, but these enjoy something the others don’t: the placid water
of Cozumel’s protected coast. The older Allegro has a nicer beach and
plenty of beachfront, but the rooms aren’t as large or attractive or com-
fortable as at the Grand, which is next door. Staying at the Grand allows
you access to the Allegro, but not vice versa. Both hotels are in the mold
of the village resort — rather than tall, modern buildings, groupings of two-
or three-story buildings are spread out over the property, with the pool
and activities area in the center. A mix of families and couples, North
Americans more than Europeans, make up most of the clientele. A quieter
pool, which is a little removed from the main activities, enables you to
enjoy some relative calm. Either hotel is a good choice for guests who want
only to be on the beach, and perhaps do some diving. Taking a taxi to town
from here can be expensive; this hotel, and its sister are at the far south-
ern end of the island. The hotel has three restaurants offering international
food served on a buffet, and the two others (one Mexican, one Italian) are
open only for dinner. You can also take advantage of a poolside snack bar
for lunch. The rates listed below aren’t really meaningful because more
than 95 percent of the guests come here as part of a package.

Playa Azul Golf and Beach Hotel
$$$–$$$$
North of town
This quiet, four-story hotel is perhaps the most relaxing of the island’s
beachfront properties. It is especially attractive to golfers, who receive
unlimited golf privileges at the nearby golf course and don’t pay greens
fees. It has a small beach dotted with shade palapas (thatched roofs) and
a welcoming beach bar. Almost all the rooms come with balconies and
views of the ocean. The rooms in the original section are all suites — large
suites with very large bathrooms and decorated with a taste for simplic-
ity. There are a few suites in the new wing that are not quite so large but
attractive and comfortable and with a Jacuzzi on the balcony. All rooms
come with either a king-size bed or two double beds, a small fridge, cof-
feemaker, hair dryer, and safe; standard rooms in the new section are large
and comfortable. The hotel has a dive shop with watersports equipment
rental. Service is attentive and personal. In 2006, the hotel added a small
spa, which adds to the relaxing character of the place.

Presidente InterContinental Cozumel Resort & Spa
$$$$$
South of town
Before Hurricane Wilma in 2005, this resort was the most attractive prop-
erty on the island. Now it’s much better, after a $25-million remodeling job,
which took a full year to complete. The makeover includes a second pool
(for adults only), a new spa, a new restaurant area, and a top-to-bottom
redesign of all the guest rooms. The hotel remains modern in style and
palatial in scope, with buildings from one floor to five floors stretching out
over an extended waterfront, with only distant hotels as neighbors. The
total number of rooms was reduced by combining the smallest rooms to
create larger, more uniform units. Rooms come in three categories depend-
ing mostly on location — pool view, ocean view, and beachfront. A few dif-
ferences exist in amenities and the designs of the rooms, but these are
minor. (There are ten “reef rooms,” which are almost on top of the water
and are priced as suites.) Suites come in four categories depending on
both location and size. All units are decorated in a sleek modern style that
incorporates tropical materials. A terrace or a balcony offers the indoor/
outdoor mix that’s so enjoyable in a beach hotel. Most come with a choice
of one king-size bed or two double beds. A menu of different pillow types
adds to the comfort. Bathrooms are large and beautifully finished. The
hotel has two pools, a dive shop that rents watersports equipment, two
restaurants, a beachside grill, and four bars, plus 24-hour room service.
Also on the premises are two lighted tennis courts, a state-of-the-art gym,
a full-service spa, and a children’s activities center. Service is attentive:
The hotel employs a large staff that is quick to attend to guests.

This three-story hotel is four blocks from the main square and two blocks
from the water. It offers large, plainly furnished rooms for a good price.
The lighting is okay, and the showers are good, and every room comes
with its own fridge, which for island visitors can be a handy feature. The
rooms are fairly quiet. Choose between two doubles or one king-size bed.
There is no restaurant, but there is a pool and lounge area. As is the case
with other small hotels on the island, the staff at the front desk doesn’t
speak English. It’s not generally a problem if your needs are simple.
Reservations through e-mail can be made in English. This is one of the few

Dining in Cozumel
For such a small town on such a small island, Cozumel offers a wide vari-
ety of restaurants where you can choose from extensive menus. As in
most Mexican beach resorts, even the finest restaurants are casual when
it comes to dress. Men seldom wear jackets, although women are occa-
sionally seen in dressier resort wear.
Taxi drivers may attempt to take you to restaurants that pay them com-
missions. They may tell you the restaurant you want to go to is closed or
that the quality has declined. Taxi drivers aren’t the only ones who do
this. I strongly suspect that cruise-ship staff steer their passengers toward
certain restaurants because I always see them eating at the same places.
Tips run about 15 percent, and most waitstaff really depend on these
tips for their income, so be generous if the service warrants. Please see
Chapter 17 for more information on Mexican cuisine.

LOBSTER/SEAFOOD
Lobster is the main attraction here. You select the lobster tail, and broth-
ers Fernando or Enrique will boil it for you with a hint of spices and serve
it with melted butter, accompanied by sides of rice, vegetables, and bread.
Does lobster require anything more? This is the only thing on the menu
on Fernando’s side of the restaurant, but Enrique will cook up steaks,
shrimp, or fish if you don’t feel like lobster. The setting is quite tropical —
a pair of thatched bungalows bordering a pond with lily pads and reeds,
traversed by a small footbridge. The rooms are softly lit with the glow of
candles and furnished with rustic tables and chairs. A year later, you could
still see some of the marks left by Hurricane Wilma, but, the Cabaña del
Pescador has lost none of its charm. The restaurant rambles around quite
a bit, so explore until you find the spot most to your taste.

NORTHERN ITALIAN
Great attention to details and a commitment to quality characterize the
food and service at this venerable Cozumel dining spot. To begin with, all
the pastas except for the penne are made in the house. Try any of the fet-
tuccines or the seafood ravioli. For the freshest seafood, ask the waiter
about the catch of the day. The management goes to great trouble to get
the best and freshest fish they can find. There was some fresh red snapper
on our last visit. If you crave simplicity, have them grill it. Steaks are
Nebraskan black Angus; salads are crisp and dressed with just the right
touch. Before dinner gets into full swing, Prima’s offers pizzas cooked in a
wood-burning oven. Desserts include Key lime pie and tiramisu. The dining
area is an upstairs, outdoor terrace, so it’s best to go when the weather
cooperates.

ruins tours on and off the island, glass-bottom boat tours, fiesta nights,
fishing, and other activities, go to a travel agency such as InterMar
Cozumel Viajes, Calle 2 Norte 101-B, between avenidas 5 and 10 (% 987-
872-1535; fax: 987-872-0895; cozumel@travel2mexico.com). It’s not far
from the main plaza.
One of the advantages of vacationing in Cozumel is that you can indulge
in a true island experience and still be just a short hop from mainland
Mexico and some of its remarkable sites. Playa del Carmen on the main-
land is a convenient 45-minute ferry ride away. Travel agencies on the
island can set you up with a tour to see the major ruins on the mainland,
such as Tulum or Chichén Itzá, or one of the nature parks such as Xel-
Ha and Xcaret (check out Chapter 14).
Cozumel also has its own ruins, but they can’t compare with the major
sites on the mainland. Some believe that during pre-Hispanic times, each
Maya woman traveled the 19km (12 miles) by boat to the island at least
once in her life to worship the goddess of fertility, Ixchel. More than 40
sites containing shrines remain around the island today, and archaeolo-
gists still uncover the small dolls that were customarily offered in the
fertility ceremony.
Scoring quality beach time
Although most of Cozumel’s shoreline is rocky, the island has some nice
beaches. The beaches here have advantages over the mainland because
the island’s western shore is protected — you get the optimum combina-
tion of placid water without the seaweed that you find in the sheltered
areas along the mainland. On the unprotected eastern shore, the water is
rougher and not suitable for swimming; however, if you only want to catch
some rays and avoid the crowds, you’re likely to have one of the eastern
shore’s small beaches and coves all to yourself. This side of the island
sees few people except on Sundays, when the locals have picnics here.
One of the most popular attractions is the Chankanaab National Park,
which is about 8km (5 miles) south of town. It has a nice beach with
beach chairs, shade umbrellas, food stalls, and a beautiful small inland
lagoon. It’s a good place if you don’t mind crowds, which usually arrive
late in the morning from the cruise ships, but admission prices were
increased a lot when the park reopened in 2006 after recovering from
Hurricane Wilma. If all you want is a beach, you can go to one of the
local beaches and pay a lot less than what the park charges. Admission
Chapter 13: Cozumel 203

to the park is $16, and it’s open from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily. Taxis charge
$10 for up to four people for the ride. For more details, see the upcoming
section “Visiting the nature parks.”
Along both the east and the west coasts are signs advertising this or
that beach club. A “beach club” in Cozumel usually means a palapa
(thatched roof) hut open to the public serving soft drinks, beer, and
fried fish. In the last five years or so they’ve become more elaborate.
Some beach clubs now rent water gear, have pools and locker rooms,
and even offer motorized watersports, such as banana boats and para-
sailing. The two biggest of these are Mr. Sancho’s (no phone; www.
mrsanchos.com) and Playa Mia (% 987-872-9030; www.playamia.com).
These do lots of business with the cruise ship passengers and can be
crowded on days when several cruise ships arrive at the island. Quieter
versions of beach clubs are Playa San Francisco (no phone), and Playa
Palancar (no phone). These two beach clubs are south of Chankanaab
Park, and don’t get all the cruise ship crowds that the closer ones do.
They are easily visible from the road. Each offers beach furniture, a
restaurant, and snorkel rental. The quality of the beaches is excellent.
Admission for Mr. Sancho’s is free; Playa Mia ranges from $15 for the
basic package to $42 for the most all-inclusive package, with a couple 
of half packages in between.
Beach clubs in the original, more basic, style include Paradise Cafe on
the southern tip of the island across from Punta Sur Nature Park and
Playa Bonita, Chen Rio, and Punta Morena on the eastern side.
At the very tip of the island, you can find a very lonely beach at the
Punta Sur Ecological Reserve. This place charges $10 and has activities
you may enjoy; for more details see the upcoming section “Visiting the
nature parks.”
Going deep: Scuba diving
Cozumel is the numero uno dive destination in the Western Hemisphere.
Don’t forget to bring your dive card and dive log. The dive shops on the
island rent scuba gear, but they won’t take you out on the boat until they
see some documentation. If you have a medical condition, bring a letter
signed by a doctor stating that you’re cleared to dive. A two-tank, morn-
ing dive costs around $60; some shops are now offering an additional
one-tank, afternoon dive for $15 for folks who took the morning dives. 
A lot of divers save money by buying a hotel and dive package with or
without air transportation and food. These packages usually include 
two dives a day with the standard day off at the end.
Diving in Cozumel is drift diving, which can be a little disconcerting for
novices. The current that sweeps along Cozumel’s reefs, pulling nutri-
ents into them and making them as large as they are, also dictates how
you dive here. The problem is that it pulls at different speeds at different
depths and in different places. When it’s pulling strong, it can quickly
Part IV: Traveling Around Isla Mujeres and Cozumel 
204

scatter a dive group, which is why you need a dive master experienced
with the local conditions who can pick the best place for diving, given
the current conditions. For those unfamiliar with the term, drift diving
occurs when divers drift with the strong currents in the waters and end
up at a point different than where they started. The dive boat follows
them. In traditional dives, the divers resurface where they began, often
descending along the boat anchor rope.
Fortunately, Cozumel has a lot of reefs to choose from. Here are just 
a few:
 Palancar Reef: Famous for its caves and canyons, plentiful fish,
and a wide variety of sea coral
 San Francisco Reef: Features a shallower drop-off wall than many
reefs and fascinating sea life
 Santa Rosa Wall: Monstrous reef famous for its depth, sea life,
coral, and sponges
 Yucab Reef: Highlights include beautiful coral
Finding a dive shop in town is easy: At least 50 operators are on the
island. Two that I can recommend are the following: Bill Horn’s Aqua
Safari, on Avenida Rafael Melgar at Calle 5 (% 987-872-0101; fax: 987-
872-0661; www.aquasafari.com), which is a PADI five-star instruction
center; and Liquid Blue Divers (% 987-869-7794; www.liquidblue
divers.com). Liquid Blue offers a real personal service. Owner Roberto
Castillo has a small, fast boat and takes a maximum of 12 divers per dive
trip. He’s PADI certified, and his wife Michelle handles the reservations
through e-mail, responding to any inquiry within 24 hours.
Underwater Yucatán offers two twists on diving — cenote diving and
snorkeling. On the mainland, the peninsula’s underground cenotes (say-
noh-tehs), or sinkholes, which were sacred to the Maya, lead to a vast
system of underground caverns. Here, the gently flowing water is so
clear that divers appear to be floating on air through the cenotes and
caves that look just like those on dry land, complete with stalactites and
stalagmites.
The experienced cave divers of Yucatech Expeditions (% 987-872-5659
[also fax]; www.yucatech.net) offer a trip five times a week. Cenotes are
30 to 45 minutes from Playa del Carmen, and a dive in each cenote lasts
around 45 minutes. (Divers usually do two or three.) Dives are within the
daylight zone, about 39m (130 ft.) into the caverns and no more than
18m (60 ft.) deep. Company owner Germán Yañez Mendoza inspects
diving credentials carefully, and divers must meet his list of require-
ments before cave diving is permitted. He also offers the equivalent of a
resort course in cave diving and a full cave-diving course. For informa-
tion and prices, call or drop by the office at the corner of Calle 3 Sur and
Avenida 5.
Chapter 13: Cozumel 205

Enjoying snorkeling
Anyone who can swim can snorkel. Rental of the snorkel (breathing
tube), goggles, and flippers should cost only about $5 to $10 for half a
day, and you can probably have a good time snorkeling in front of the
hotel. But what’s more fun is to take a trip to snorkel Paradise Reef and a
couple of other good locations. When contracting for a snorkel tour, stay
away from the companies that cater to the cruise ships. Those tours are
crowded and not very much fun. For a good snorkeling tour, you can
contact Victor Casanova (% 987-872-1028; wildcatcozumel@hotmail.
com). He speaks English, owns a couple of boats, and does a good five-
hour tour. He takes his time and doesn’t rush through the trip. Another
operator that specializes in snorkeling trips is the Kuzamil Snorkeling
Center (% 987-872-4637 or 987-872-0539). It’s located at the far end of
town at Avenida 50 bis 565 Int. 1, between 5 Sur and Hidalgo, Colonia
Adolfo López Matéos. It’s better to make arrangements over the phone
or through a local travel agency instead of visiting the office. A full-day
snorkel trip costs $65 per person, $50 for children younger than 12. Half-
day trips are $40 for adults and $30 for children. The price includes the
boat, the guide, a buffet lunch, and snorkel equipment.
Visiting the nature parks
Chankanaab National Park is the pride of many island residents.
Chankanaab means “little sea,” which refers to a beautiful landlocked
pool connected to the sea through an underground tunnel — a sort of
miniature ocean. Snorkeling in this natural aquarium is not permitted,
but the park has a good beach for sunbathing and snorkeling just a few
yards off shore. Arrive early to stake out a chair and palapa before the
cruise-ship crowd arrives. Likewise, the snorkeling is best before noon.
The park has bathrooms, lockers, a gift shop, several snack huts, a
restaurant, and a palapa for renting snorkeling gear.
The park suffered serious damage from the hurricane. A large botanical
garden decorated with recreations of Maya sculptures was completely
destroyed and has not been restored. Admission to the park costs $16.
This is pricey for the island. Probably the park administrators are trying
to recoup restoration costs and think the cruise-ship visitors will pay to
go. Hours are 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily. Taxis are always available.
Punta Sur Ecological Reserve (admission $10) is a large area encom-
passing the southern tip of the island, including the large Columbia
Lagoon. The only practical way of going there is to rent a car or scooter;
there is no taxi stand, and, usually, few people. This area is an ecological
reserve, not a park, so don’t expect much infrastructure. The reserve
has an information center and a snack bar. It also had some observation
towers, but these were damaged in the hurricane. Punta Sur has some
interesting snorkeling (bring your own gear) and lovely beaches kept as
natural as possible. Regular hours are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Part IV: Traveling Around Isla Mujeres and Cozumel 
206

Cruising the seas
Travel agencies and hotels can arrange boat trips, a popular pastime on
Cozumel. Your options include evening cruises, cocktail cruises, glass-
bottom boats, and more. Do inquire whether the trip will be filled with
cruise-ship passengers, because trips that cater to the cruise-ship
crowds can be packed. Tour operators are usually pretty open about
this subject, but you may want to double-check. Departures before 
10 a.m. are a good bet if you prefer smaller crowds.
One rather novel boat trip is a ride in a submarine, offered by Atlantis
Submarines (% 987-872-5671). The sub can hold 48 people. It operates
almost 3km (2 miles) south of town in front of the Casa del Mar hotel and
costs $81 per adult, $47 for kids 4 to 12 years old. Call ahead and make
reservations. This submarine ride is a far superior experience to the Sub
See Explorer offered by Aqua World, which is really a glorified glass-
bottom boat. To inquire into any of these cruises go to a travel agency
such as InterMar Cozumel Viajes (Calle 2 Norte, No. 101-B, between
avenidas 5 and 10; % 987-872-1535; fax: 987-872-0895; intermar@
cozumel.com.mx). The agency isn’t far from the main plaza.
Catching the big one
The best months for fishing offshore Cozumel are from April to
September, when the catch includes blue-and-white marlin, sailfish,
tarpon, swordfish, dorado, wahoo, tuna, and red snapper. Fishing excur-
sions costs $450 for six people for the whole day, or $80 to $85 per
person for four people for a half-day. One travel agency that specializes in
fishing (deep-sea and fly-fishing) is Aquarius Travel Fishing (Calle 3 Sur
No. 2, between Avenida Rafael Melgar and Avenida 5; % 987-872-1092;
gabdiaz@yahoo.com).
Swimming with dolphins
Dolphin Discovery (% 800-293-9698; www.dolphindiscovery.com)
has several programs for sharing a swim with these highly intelligent
animals. You need to make reservations in advance, and the surest way
is through the Web site. The most intensive dolphin swim program costs
$125. There are a couple of more economical programs costing $75 and
$99. Dolphin Discovery is located inside Chankanaab Park.
Keeping Your Feet on Dry Land
If you want some time off from all the strenuous sunbathing and pad-
dling around the pool, Cozumel offers a number of activities to interest
you. Some local Maya ruins make for a short, pleasant outing, or you can
do a day trip to one of the major Maya sites on the mainland. Several
companies offer bus tours to places like Chichén Itzá or Tulum. Or how
about a round of golf? Or perhaps some shopping. The following sec-
tions offer a few ideas to keep you busy.
Chapter 13: Cozumel 207

Hitting the links
Cozumel has an 18-hole course designed by Jack Nicklaus. It’s at the
Cozumel Country Club (% 987-872-9570), just north of San Miguel.
Greens fees are $165, including taxes and cart rental for morning tee
times ($99 for afternoon tee times). You can reserve tee times three days
in advance. A few hotels have special memberships with discounts for
guests and advance tee times, especially Playa Azul Golf and Beach
Hotel (reviewed in the “Checking out Cozumel’s best hotels” section 
earlier in this chapter).
Seeing the sights
Companies offer a couple of tours of the island, but to be frank, the best
part of Cozumel isn’t on land; it’s what’s in the water. If you’re starting to
look like a prune from all the time in the water or you simply want to try
something different, travel agencies can book you on a group tour of the
island for around $50. Prices vary a bit depending on whether the tour
includes lunch and a stop for snorkeling and swimming at Chankanaab
Park. If you’re only interested in Chankanaab, go by yourself and save
money. Taxi drivers charge $60 for four-hour tours of the island, which
most people would consider only mildly amusing depending on the per-
sonality of the taxi driver.
A horseback tour of the island’s interior is a relaxing activity. Last 
year, the tour was a sad affair because the jungle vegetation had been
stripped by the hurricane in 2005, but it’s surprising how fast the vegeta-
tion grows back. On a visit in late 2006, much of the foliage had already
returned, though you could still see hurricane damage. A few outfits
offer horseback riding, but the best is Rancho Palmitas (no phone). This
outfit has the best horses and conducts the most interesting tours. It 
has two locations, both south of town. One is near the InterContinental
Presidente Cozumel Resort and the other is across the road from the
Allegro Hotel by Occidental. Both locations are open seven days a week.
Tours depart at 8 and 10 a.m., noon, and at 2 and 4 p.m.
Part IV: Traveling Around Isla Mujeres and Cozumel 
208
“Jungle” tours a dubious choice
There are some “jungle Jeep tours” and “jungle ATV tours” on the island that are pub-
licized as adventure tours. That’s a bit of an overstatement. Most of the terrain is flat,
and the jungle is more scrublike than the term jungle indicates. Even in the best of
times, these tours can’t be called spectacular, but if you’re interested in this kind of
activity, look up the folks at the InterMar Cozumel Viajes travel agency. (See the list-
ing under the “Cruising the seas” section, earlier in this chapter.)

Exploring Maya ruins on Cozumel
One of the most popular island excursions is to San Gervasio (100 B.C.–
A.D. 1600). Follow the paved transversal road. You see the well-marked
turnoff about halfway between town and the eastern coast. Once you
pass through the gate, you drive over a barely maintained road to the
ruins (about 3km or 2 miles farther) and pay the $5 fee to enter; still 
and video camera permits cost $5 each. A small tourist center at the
entrance sells cold drinks and snacks.
When it comes to Cozumel’s Maya remains, getting there is most of the
fun — do it for the mystique and for the trip, not for the size or scale of
the ruins. The buildings, though preserved, are crudely made and would
not be much of an attraction if they were not the island’s principal ruins.
More significant than beautiful, this site was once an important ceremo-
nial center where the Maya gathered, coming even from the mainland.
The important deity was Ixchel, the goddess of weaving, women, child-
birth, pilgrims, the moon, and medicine. Ixchel was the wife of Itzamná,
the sun god, and as such, preeminent among all Maya gods.
Tour guides charge $10 for a tour for one to six people. A better option is
to find a copy of the green booklet San Gervasio, sold at local checkout
counters or bookstores, and tour the site on your own. Seeing it takes 
30 minutes. Taxi drivers offer a tour to the ruins for about $25; the driver
will wait for you outside the ruins.
Day-tripping off to the mainland
Going to the nearby seaside village of Playa del Carmen and the Xcaret
nature park on your own is as easy as a quick ferry ride from Cozumel.
(For more details on Playa del Carmen and Xcaret, see Chapter 14.)
Cozumel travel agencies offer an Xcaret tour that includes the ferry 
fee, transportation to the park, and the park admission fee for $100 for
adults, $60 for children. Given what the package includes, this price is
reasonable.
Travel agencies can also arrange day trips to the fascinating ruins of
Chichén Itzá either by air or by bus. The ruins of Tulum, overlooking
the Caribbean, and Cobá, in a dense jungle setting, are closer to
Cozumel, so they cost less to visit. Trips to Cobá and Tulum begin at 
8 a.m. and return around 6 p.m. For more information on these sites,
check out Chapter 15.
Looking at the island’s natural history
In town, fronting the water, is a small museum, Museo de la Isla de
Cozumel on Avenida Rafael Melgar between calles 4 and 6 Norte (% 987-
872-1475). It’s more than just a nice place to spend a rainy hour. The first
floor of the museum has an excellent exhibit displaying endangered
Chapter 13: Cozumel 209

species in the area, the origin of the island, and its present-day topogra-
phy and plant and animal life, including an explanation of coral formation.
The second-floor galleries feature the history of the town, artifacts from
the island’s pre-Hispanic sites, and colonial-era relics like cannons,
swords, and ship paraphernalia. The museum is open daily from 9 a.m. to
5 p.m. Admission is $3; guided tours in English are free. A rooftop restau-
rant serves breakfast and lunch.
Shopping in Cozumel
Numerous jewelry stores and duty-free stores line Avenida Rafael Melgar
and do a good bit of business with cruise-ship passengers. There are a
few Mexican handicraft stores, too: Los Cinco Soles (% 987-872-2040) is
on Melgar, 5 blocks north of the plaza; Indigo (% 987-872-1076) and
Viva Mexico (% 987-872-5466) are on Melgar 2 blocks south of the main
plaza. But the best handicraft and folk art store on the island is not on
Melgar. Inspiración (% 987-869-8293) is on Avenida 5 between Rosado
Salas and Calle 3, also 2 blocks south of the main plaza. Owner Dianne
Hartwig has created a beautiful gallery and displays the creations of
some of the best known folk artists in the Yucatán — objects that are
very hard to come by if you don’t actually go to the villages where many
of these artists live. She also represents some talented contemporary
local artists.
Enjoying Cozumel’s Nightlife
Most of the music and dance venues are in two areas: one is on Rafael
Melgar just north of the main plaza, and includes the Hard Rock Cafe at
Av. Rafael Melgar Norte #2 (% 987-872-5271); the other area is in the
Punta Langosta shopping center, in front of the pier of the same name,
about 6 blocks south of the main plaza at Av. Rafael Melgar Sur 551. 
Here you’ll find Carlos ’n’ Charlie’s (% 987-869-1646) and Señor Frog’s
(% 987-869-1650). If you’re looking for live salsa music, the All Sports
Bar (% 987-869-2246) is at present the most popular venue on the
island from Thursday to Saturday night from 9 p.m. to 3 a.m. Also, you
can look for live salsa at the corner of Rosado Salas and Avenida 5 sur
(across from Prima Restaurant). There is an upstairs nightclub that
keeps changing names and owners. It’s usually open for high season and
gets some good live bands. Another thing to do on Sundays is to go to
the main square, which usually has a free concert and lots of local
people strolling about and visiting with friends. People sit in outdoor
cafes enjoying the cool night breezes until the restaurants close.

Area Code
The telephone area code is 987.
Banks, ATMs, and Currency Exchange
The island has several banks and casas de
cambio (currency exchange offices), as
well as ATMs. Most places accept U.S. dol-
lars, but you usually get a better deal
paying in pesos.
Business Hours
Most offices maintain traditional Mexican
hours of operation (9 a.m.–2 p.m. and 
4–8 p.m. daily), but shops remain open
throughout the day. Offices tend to close on
Saturday and Sunday, but shops are open
on Saturday, at least, and increasingly offer
limited hours of operation on Sunday.
Climate
From June to November, strong winds and
some rain can prevail over the Yucatán. In
Cozumel, wind conditions in November and
December can make diving dangerous.
June to September is the rainy season.
Diving
If you intend to dive, bring proof of your
diver’s certification and your dive log.
Underwater currents can be strong here,
and many of the reef drops are quite steep,
making them excellent sites for experi-
enced divers but challenging for novice
divers.
Information
The Municipal Tourism Office (% 987-869-
0212) maintains an information booth in
front of the ferry pier on the main square.
Staff is there to answer questions from
Monday to Saturday from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.
There is also a booth at the airport that is
open regular office hours, and other booths
in front of the cruise-ship piers, which open
when cruise ships arrive.
Internet Access
Many cybercafes operate in town. Look for
any sign that uses the words “Internet” or
“cyber.” Three places offering computers
and Internet access are on Avenida 10, by
Avenida Juárez.
Police
Dial 060. Remember that you’re unlikely to
find an English-speaking operator at the
police station.
Post Office
The post office (correo) (Avenida Rafael
Melgar at Calle 7 Sur, at the southern edge
of town; % 987-872-0106) is open Monday
to Friday 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. and Saturday 9 a.m.
to 1 p.m.
Recompression Chamber
Cozumel has four recompression chambers
(cámaras de recompresión). Buceo Médico,
staffed 24 hours, is on Calle 5 Sur, 1 block
off Avenida Rafael Melgar between Melgar
and Avenida 5 Sur (% 987-872-2387 or 987-
872-1430). Another one is the Hyperbaric
Center of Cozumel (Calle 6 Norte, between
avenidas 5 and 10; % 987-872-3070).
Taxes
A 15 percent IVA (value-added tax) on
goods and services is charged, and it’s 
generally included in the posted price.
Taxis
Fares on the island are fixed with little vari-
ation and generally are not open to negotia-
tion. Taxis charge extra for more than two
passengers. It isn’t customary to tip taxi
drivers in Mexico unless the driver helps
Chapter 13: Cozumel 211
Fast Facts: Cozumel

with luggage or acts as a tour guide. Call
% 987-872-0236 for taxi pickup.
Telephone
Avoid the phone booths that have signs in
English advising you to call home using a
special 800 number — these booths are
absolute rip-offs and can cost as much as
U.S. $20 per minute. There are two inexpen-
sive ways to call. One is to make your call
at one of the Internet shops on the island.
Some offer long-distance calling over the
Internet. Inquire about rates before you
agree. The other is to buy a prepaid phone
card issued by Telmex, the Mexican phone
company. These cards, called LadaTel, are
sold at pharmacies, newsstands, and small
stores. You can use these to call from one
of the Telmex (LadaTel) public phones. In
Mexico, you need to dial 001 and then the
area code and phone number to reach the
United States. To call long distance inside
Mexico you dial 01.

Exploring the

I
f you want to leave the hustle and bustle of Cancún behind,
you’ve come to the right place. Chapter 14 covers the stretch
of coastline called the Riviera Maya, named for the yin-and-yang
combination of luxurious modern resorts and ancient Maya
ruins found throughout the region. Slower-paced than Cancún,
this area can hardly be deemed “sleepy,” with several luxury
chains clamoring for a piece of the action over the past few
years. In the beach town of Playa del Carmen, funky co-exists
with sophistication. In Tulum, a get-away-from-it-all cabaña is
the perfect escape from a high-stress job. The Riviera Maya’s
eco-theme parks provide entertaining encounters with nature.
Along this coveted strip of coastline, you can simply take a
deep breath and absorb the essence of warm-weather Mexico.
This neck of the Yucatán Peninsula is also home to some of
Mexico’s most spectacular ruins, where pyramids, statues,
and mysterious carvings provide tantalizing clues to ancient
civilizations. In Chapter 15, we introduce you to the most
impressive and easily accessible of these sites.

T
he Riviera Maya is a stretch of the Yucatán’s Caribbean coast from
just south of Cancún to the town of Tulum. It’s a beautiful coastline
dotted with a mix of ecoparks, small resort towns, and large all-inclusive
resorts. A reef system protects this coast and offers many snorkeling
and diving opportunities. Where gaps appear in the reef, you find good
beaches — mainly at Playa del Carmen (the major town on the coast),
Xpu-ha, and Tulum. The action of the surf washes away silt and seagrass
and erodes rocks, leaving a sandy bottom. Where the reef is prominent,
you can expect good snorkeling just offshore with lots of fish and other
sea creatures. And this increasingly popular stretch of coastline bustles
with development; every month it seems another new resort has opened
somewhere along the coast.
Exploring the Riviera Maya
The Riviera Maya is an easy region to navigate. A single highway connects
all the towns of the coast. From Cancún to Playa del Carmen it’s a four-
lane divided road. South of Playa recent construction has widened the
highway to four lanes as far as the town of Paamul. South of Paamul it is a
wide two-lane road all the way to Tulum, but there are plans to widen this
part, too. Although bus service is plentiful, I prefer to rent a car and set
my own schedule. (For more on seeing the region by rental car, see the
“The Riviera Maya” section later in this chapter.) Here’s a brief rundown of
the best towns and attractions:

 Playa del Carmen: Playa (as locals call it) is a medium-sized town
on one of the best stretches of beach. It’s perfect for enjoying the
simple (and perhaps the best) pleasures of a seaside vacation —
taking in the sun and the sea air while working your toes into soft,
white sand; cooling down with a swim in clear, blue water; and
strolling leisurely down the beach while listening to the wash of
waves and feeling the light touch of tropical breezes on your skin.
And you can mix all this with a little nightlife and shopping, which
makes it perfect for those who get bored easily.
 Puerto Morelos: This town located 30 minutes south of Cancún has
remained a sleepy little village with a few small hotels and rental
houses. In the immediate neighborhood are a few mega resorts, but
these seem to affect the town very little. Locals refer to it as “Muerto
Morelos” (Dead Morelos) during the off season for the lack of activity.
It’s a convenient escape from the hustle and bustle of Cancún and
Playa, perfect for a relaxed vacation of laying about the beach and
reading a book (with perhaps the occasional foray into a watersport
or two). The coast is sandy and good for beachcombing. A prominent
reef lies just offshore and is protected as a national park. There is
good snorkeling here and good diving nearby, but the water close to
the beach is shallow with a good bit of sea grass.
 Xcaret: Just south of Playa del Carmen is this large ecopark that
draws people, mostly families from Cancún, Cozumel, and all
points along this coast. Highlights include floating through an
underground river (not for everybody), nightly shows, and lots of
seaside activities.
 Xpu-Ha: You won’t find anything to see here but a long, wide stretch
of perfect sandy beach. You can elect to stay here or stay elsewhere
and make a day trip out of it.
 Akumal: This small, modern, and ecologically oriented community
is built on the shores of two beautiful bays — Akumal and Half-
Moon Bay. This community has been around long enough that it
feels more relaxed than other places on the coast that are booming,
such as Playa and Tulum. A lot of families vacation here, renting
condos by the week. The bays are shallow, with a predominantly
rocky floor, but there are numerous dive sites around here and
three good dive shops.
 Xel-Ha: A large, well-protected lagoon is the centerpiece for this
lovely ecopark. It attracts crowds of snorkelers who come to view
the fish in the calm, clear waters. The park also offers dolphin
swims and a small group of ruins.
 Tulum: The town of Tulum (132km/82 miles from Cancún and close
by the ruins of the same name) has a hotel district of about 30 small
palapa (thatched roof) hotels, stretching down a beautiful beach.
The town itself has a half-dozen restaurants, a bank, and several
cybercafes A few years ago, Tulum was mainly a destination for back-
packer types, but with some of the most beautiful beaches on this

coast and many improvements in hotel amenities, it’s attracting a
greater variety of visitors. Construction is booming, both in the town
and along the coast. But you can enjoy the beach here in relative
solitude and quiet (unless your hotel is busy building additional
rooms). Of course, the flip side of peace and quiet is that Tulum
doesn’t have the variety of restaurants that Playa and Cancún do.
Playa del Carmen
Playa started out attracting a lot of ex-hippie types who weren’t inter-
ested in the mass tourism of Cancún. Many settled into the village, build-
ing small, simple hotels and shops to supply the needs of like-minded
travelers. Over the years, it has changed, and though no longer having
the feel of a village, it still can provide that rare combination of simplic-
ity (you can go just about anywhere on foot) and variety (with its many
one-of-a-kind hotels, restaurants, and shops). This appealing combina-
tion sets it apart from all the other destinations on this coast.
If solitude is what you’re seeking, go elsewhere. Playa now draws
crowds of visitors with its lively street scene. South of town is a large
development called Playacar, complete with golf course and a dozen
large, all-inclusive hotels. Farther south is a cruise-ship pier. People
from both places come to the town’s beaches and shopping areas.
Playa has a casual feel. The local architecture has adopted elements of
native building — rustic clapboard walls, thatched roofs, lots of tropi-
cal foliage, irregular shapes and angles, and a ramshackle, unplanned
look. All these features reflect its toned-down approach to tourism. In
the last few years, though, slicker architecture has appeared along
with chain restaurants and stores.
A strong European influence has made topless sunbathing (nominally
against the law in Mexico) a nonchalantly accepted practice anywhere
there’s a beach. The beach grows and shrinks, from broad and sandy to
narrow with occasional rocks, depending on the currents and wind. Even
on a bad-weather day, it’s a beauty.
Settling into Playa
Playa is one of those places that’s easy to enjoy. Once you’ve reached
the end of the chain of taxis, airplanes, buses, and rental cars that it took
to bring you here, and you’re finally in your hotel room, you can simply
switch to autopilot. Nothing could be simpler or more effortless than
settling into this town and enjoying what it has to offer. Here’s the skinny
on how to arrive in Playa.
Getting from the Cancún airport to Playa
For getting through Customs and such at the Cancún airport, see
Chapter 9. If you’re driving, follow the signs as you exit the airport. It
feeds you right on to Highway 307 (head south, or you’re going to end
up in Cancún). The ride takes about 40 minutes.

Playa del Carmen
Chapter 14: Playa del Carmen and the Riviera Maya 219
As you approach Playa, the highway divides, and two extra lanes are
added in each direction. Stay in the left lanes; this will allow you to make
a left turn at any of several traffic lights. If you don’t stay left, you will
have to keep on the highway until you get to a traffic circle on the other
side of town.
At the third or fourth traffic light is Avenida Constituyentes, which you
want to take for destinations in northern Playa. The next is Avenida
Juárez, the artery that connects the highway to the town’s main square
and ferry pier.

A company called Autobuses Riviera offers bus service from the Cancún
airport about 12 times a day. Cost is $8 one-way. Taxi fares from the
Cancún airport are high — about $70 one-way. Playa has two bus stations.
Buses coming from Cancún and places along the coast, such as Tulum,
arrive at the Riviera station, at the corner of Juárez and Avenida 5, by the
town square. Buses coming from destinations in the interior of the penin-
sula arrive at the new ADO station, on Avenida 20 between 12th and 14th
streets.
Taking the ferry from Cozumel
A much less common route to Playa is through the Cozumel airport and
then transferring to the Cozumel ferry. (See Chapter 13 for schedules,
prices, and other details.) The passenger-ferry dock in Playa is 11⁄2 blocks
from the main square and within walking distance of hotels. Tricycle
taxis meet the ferry and can transport your luggage to any central hotel
or to a taxi if your destination is farther away.
Getting around Playa
The main street, Avenida Juárez, leads to the zócalo (town square) from
Highway 307. As it does so, it crosses several numbered avenues that
run parallel to the beach, all of which are multiples of five. Avenida 5 is
closest to the beach; it’s closed to traffic from the zócalo to Calle 6 (and
some blocks beyond, in the evening). On this avenue are many hotels,
restaurants, and shops. Most of the town is north and west of the
zócalo. South of the zócalo is the Playacar development, with a golf
course, a small airstrip, private residences, and large resort hotels.
Staying in Playa
For grown-ups, staying in one of the small hotels in Playa is usually more
fun than staying in one of the growing number of all-inclusive resorts
along this coast. Don’t hesitate to stay in a place that’s not on the beach.
Town life here is a big part of the fun, and staying on the beach in Playa
has its disadvantages — the noise produced by a couple of the beach-
side bars, for one thing. And if you choose accommodations off of the
beach, you don’t have to worry about not being able to find that perfect
strip of sand. Beaches are public property in Mexico, and you can lay
out your towel anywhere you like without anyone bothering you.
The following rates listed include the 12 percent hotel tax and assume
double occupancy. High-season rates generally don’t include the week
between Christmas and New Year’s, when rates go still higher.
Deseo Hotel + Lounge
$$$–$$$$
Playa del Carmen
This is the hippest, coolest place in town these days. It’s all about making
the scene, and the lounge plays the central role, serving all the functions

of lobby, restaurant, bar, and pool area — a raised open-air platform with
bar, pool, and self-serve kitchen. You’ll find large daybeds for sunning or
for enjoying an evening drink when the bar is in full swing. The clientele is
predominantly 25- to 45-year-olds, and the music is contemporary. The
rooms face two sides of the lounge. They are comfortable, original, and
striking. Unlike the usual plush hotel room, they try to get you to go out
and socialize; there’s no TV, no minibar, and no cushy armchair to tempt
you to vegetate. Their simplicity gives them an almost Oriental feel, height-
ened by nice touches such as sliding doors of wood and frosted glass. The
mattresses, however, are thick and luxurious. All rooms have king-size
beds. From the bottom of each bed, a little drawer slides out with a night
kit containing three things: incense, earplugs, and condoms.

Hotel Jungla Caribe
$$
Playa del Carmen
Located right in the heart of the Avenida 5 action, “La Jungla” is an imagi-
native place, with a highly stylized look that mixes neoclassical with
Robinson Crusoe. Its character is perfectly in keeping with the quirkiness
of the town. Owner Rolf Albrecht envisioned space and comfort for guests,
so all but eight of the standard rooms are large, with gray-and-black marble
floors, the occasional Roman column, and large bathrooms. Fifteen of the
rooms are suites. Catwalks connect the “tower” section of suites (my
favorite) to the hotel. There’s an attractive pool in the courtyard beneath
a giant Ramón tree. Eight small rooms lack air-conditioning and are priced
lower than the rates listed here.

Playa del Carmen
This four-story hotel (no elevator) is only 50 paces from the beach and
has bargain-priced rooms, a central location, and even a few rooms with a
view of the ocean (though that could change if the hotel next door decides
to build upward). Rooms are medium to large, with ceiling fans and attrac-
tive bathrooms. Some rooms come with air-conditioning and balconies,
some don’t. Most of the balconies look out over a small pool encircled with
tropical vegetation, which is very inviting.

Hotel Lunata
$$
Playa del Carmen
The Lunata offers a combination of location, comfort, and attractiveness,
all at a good price. It’s built in hacienda style, with cut stone and wrought
iron, and decorated in contemporary Mexican colors. The rooms show a
lot of polish, with good air-conditioning and nicely finished bathrooms.
They also come with a TV, a small fridge, and a safe. The majority of rooms
are deluxe, which are medium to large and come with a king-size bed or
two doubles with firm mattresses. A complimentary continental breakfast
is served in the garden, and the third-story terrace makes a nice place to
hang out. This hotel is right on Avenida 5; if you like to go to bed early,
think of staying elsewhere.

Iberostar Tucán
$$$
Playa del Carmen
This all-inclusive hotel is a member of a large chain of resorts based in
Spain. The Tucán is actually just one half of the resort; the other half is
called Iberostar Quetzal. They’re exactly the same, so don’t be confused
by the different names when talking to travel agents or packagers. The
cheapest rates are to be had through a vacation packager or travel agent
instead of booking the hotel yourself. In fact, most guests stay here as part
of a package that combines airfare and ground transportation. Families
make up the majority of the guests, and Iberostar makes sure to have
plenty for children to do, including evening shows and a day-time kids’
club. The food is reliable. The hotel has three restaurants: a main buffet
restaurant and two restaurants (Mexican and Italian) open only for dinner.
It also has four pools: a large general pool, an activities pool, kids pool,
and an adults-only pool with swim-up bar.

Playa Maya
$$
Playa del Carmen
Of the beach hotels in downtown Playa, this one would be my first choice.
The American management is helpful and friendly, the rooms are comfort-
able, and the location is right on the beach, in fact, the only access to the
hotel is from the beach. A casual, relaxing feel permeates the place and sets
the mood from the moment you get there. The pool and sunning terrace are
attractive and nicely set apart. Rooms are large with midsize bathrooms and
good air-conditioning. A couple of suites come with private garden terraces
with Jacuzzis; other rooms have balconies facing the beach.

Shangri-La Caribe
$$$–$$$$
Playa del Carmen
This hotel — a grouping of cabanas on one of the best beaches in Playa —
is hard to beat for sheer fun and leisure. And it’s far enough from the center
of town to be quiet yet convenient. The older, south side of the hotel (the
“Caribe” section) consists of one- and two-story cabanas. The north
(“Playa”) side is a few larger buildings, holding four to six rooms. A prefer-
ence for one or the other section is a matter of taste; the units in both are
similar in amenities, privacy, and price. The real difference in price depends
on the proximity to the water — beachfront, ocean view, or garden view.
Garden view is the best bargain, being only a few steps farther from the
water. All rooms have quiet air-conditioning and a patio or porch complete
with hammock. Most come with two double beds, but a few have king-size
beds. Windows are screened, and ceiling fans circulate the breeze.

Treetops
$$
Playa del Carmen
Treetops not only offers a good price, but good location, too: half a block
from the beach, half a block from Avenida 5, which is just enough distance
to filter out the noise. The rooms at Treetops encircle a pool, a small cenote,
and patch of preserved jungle that shades the hotel and lends the proper
tropical feel. Rooms are large and comfortable and have air-conditioning,
fans, refrigerators, and either balconies or patios. Some of the upper rooms,
especially the central suite, have the feel of a treehouse. Two other suites are
large, with fully loaded kitchenettes and work well for groups of four.

Dining in Playa
Restaurants in Playa constantly open and close. None of the following
restaurants accept reservations — which isn’t a problem, because you
rarely have trouble getting a table. Most of the restaurants are European.
If you want to try some simple, inexpensive, but safe Mexican food, I can
recommend a taco restaurant, Los Carboncitos, on Calle 4 between
avenidas 5 and 10.

Casa Mediterránea
$$
Playa del Carmen
ITALIAN
Tucked away on a quiet little patio off Quinta Avenida, this small, homey
restaurant serves excellent food. Maurizio Gabrielli and Mary Michelon are
usually there to attend to the customers and make recommendations. They
came to Mexico to enjoy the simple life, and this inclination shows in the
restaurant’s welcoming, unhurried atmosphere. The menu is mostly north-
ern Italian, with several dishes from other parts of Italy. Daily specials are
offered, too. Pastas (except penne and spaghetti) are made in-house, and
none is precooked. Try fish and shrimp ravioli or penne alla Veneta. Several
wines, mostly Italian, make a perfect accompaniment. The salads are good
and carefully prepared — dig in without hesitation.

EUROPEAN/MEXICAN
This new arrival to Playa offers some of the best of both Old and New
Worlds. What I tried was delicious — chicken in a wonderfully scented
sauce of fine herbs accompanied by fettuccine, and a well-made tortilla
soup listed as sopa mexicana. A number of cool and light dishes are appe-
tizing for lunch or an afternoon meal; for example, an avocado stuffed with
shrimp and flavored with a subtle horseradish sauce on a bed of alfalfa
sprouts and julienned carrots — a good mix of tastes and textures. The
dining area is upstairs under a large and airy palapa roof.

MEXICAN/GRILL
One of the most popular restaurants in town, this place has an open dining
area where the aroma of grilling fajitas permeates the air. The chicken faji-
tas make for a larger serving. Grilled lobster is also on the menu. The cooks
do a good job with Mexican standards, such as tortilla soup, enchiladas, and
quesadillas. Mariachis show up around 8 p.m.; you can sometimes avoid
them by showing up early or getting a table on the upper terrace in back.

SEAFOOD
“The restaurant that was born with the town,” proclaims the sign outside
of this establishment. This restaurant is also the one locals recommend

as the best for seafood. It’s right on the beach, and the water practically
laps at the foundations. Because the owners are fishermen, the fish is so
fresh that it’s practically still wiggling. The place doesn’t look like much,
but the cooks know their trade and can prepare your fish in several ways.
If you haven’t tried the Yucatecan specialty tik-n-xic fish (prepared in a
native style of barbecue), this restaurant is a good place to do so.

The owners here offer an outstanding, eclectic menu that favors grilled

Japanese. Keep an eye on the daily specials. The open-air restaurant also
makes sandwiches and salads, black bean quesadillas, and crêpes. The

MAYA/YUCATECAN
The menu here makes use of many native foods and spices to produce a
style of cooking different from what you usually get when ordering
Yucatecan food. You find such things as a cream of chaya (a native leafy
vegetable) or xcatic chile stuffed with cochinita. I also like the classic fruit
salad, done Mexican-style with lime juice and dried powdered chile. The
menu is varied and includes a lot of seafood dishes. The ones I had were
fresh and well prepared.

Having fun on and off the beach
Time spent in Playa can be as active or as relaxing as you want it to be.
You can easily arrange a trip to see the ruins or spend the day at Xcaret.
And, as is the case with just about anywhere on this coast, you can
always line up a snorkel or scuba trip, which leaves the evening free for
strolling about Playa and taking in the town’s amusing street scene.
Getting quality beach time
Playa is Spanish for beach, and in this town, life is a playa. Stroll down
the beach to find your favorite spot. The beach just north of Avenida
Constituyentes is quite nice. It’s broad and flat. You’ll find some “beach
Chapter 14: Playa del Carmen and the Riviera Maya 225

clubs” there, which for a fee, offer a variety of amenities, including
beach furniture, shade umbrellas, food and bar service, even massages.
One is called Mamitas, another is Playa Tukan. They’re a good deal if
you plan on spending the entire day at the beach.
Diving and snorkeling
Tank-Ha Dive Center (% 984-873-0302; fax: 984-873-1355; www.tankha.
com) offers dive trips to sites nearby. The owner, Alberto Leonard, came
to Playa by way of Madrid. He can set you up for a dive offshore, or, if
you’re up for it, he arranges excursions to the cenotes down the coast.
Snorkeling trips cost around $35 and include soft drinks and equipment.
Two-tank dive trips are $55; resort courses with SSI and PADI instructors
cost $75. If you’re traveling down the coast on this same trip, it’s proba-
bly best to hold off on the cenote diving until then. (See the section on
Akumal, later in this chapter.)
Teeing off and playing tennis
If golf is your bag, an 18-hole championship golf course (% 984-873-
0624), designed by Robert Von Hagge, is adjacent to the Continental
Plaza Playacar. Greens fees are $180 (includes cart) in the morning, and
$120 after 2 p.m. Club rental costs $30, and the price includes tax. The
club also has two tennis courts available at a rate of $10 per hour.
Day-tripping to Maya ruins and nature parks
One of the most popular bus tours from Playa is a day trip to Chichén
Itzá. (See Chapter 15 for information on the ruins and the surrounding
area.) The trip usually includes a couple of stops, including one for lunch
and perhaps a swim. You usually get to the ruins shortly after noon and
return about 5 or 6 p.m. In many cases, you can reserve a tour through
your hotel; if not, you can do so at any of the local travel agencies.
You can also go to Chichén Itzá by rental car. Choosing this approach lets
you enjoy a morning at the beach before driving to the ruins in the heat of
the afternoon. (Be sure to rent a car with air-conditioning.) Check into a
hotel and perhaps go see the evening sound-and-light show and then get
up early and see the ruins in the morning. When you do it this way, you
avoid most of the bus tours, which arrive in the afternoon, and you see
the ruins in the coolness of the morning. Driving to Chichén is fairly easy;
the ruins are 21⁄2 hours from Playa. For more details, see Chapter 15.
Another popular bus tour combines a half-day at Tulum (described in
Chapter 15) with a half-day at the ecopark Xel-Ha (described later in this
chapter) for swimming and snorkeling. This itinerary makes for a con-
venient, no-hassle trip with a nice combination of activities — you work
up a sweat at the ruins and then cool off in the lagoon at Xel-ha. (Don’t
do it the other way.)
Part V: Exploring the Yucatán 
226

The most popular trip is to Xcaret (see the section on Xcaret, later in this
chapter). If you want to set your own schedule, take a taxi there and back
rather than buy admission and transportation as a package. However,
some tours include dropping you back in Playa for lunch and taking you
back to the park for the afternoon and evening. You can also take tours to
Cozumel, but these trips are disappointing. You see exactly what the
cruise-ship passengers see — lots of duty-free souvenir and jewelry
shops. You’re better off going by yourself on the ferry and spending at
least a couple of nights there (see Chapter 13).
A tour agency in Playa called Alltournative (% 984-873-2036; www.all
tournative.com) offers small tours that combine a little of everything:
culture (visit a contemporary Maya village); adventure (kayaking, rap-
pelling, snorkeling, cenote diving); natural history; and ruins. It offers
these tours daily using vans for transportation. The tours are fun. You
can call the agency directly or arrange a tour through your hotel; they
pick up at most of the large resorts along the coast. A new outfit called
Selvática (% 998-849-5510; www.selvatica.com.mx), operating out of
offices in Cancún, offers guests a little adventure tourism in the jungle,
with 2.5km (11⁄2 miles) of zip lines strung up in the forest canopy. There is
also mountain biking and swimming in cenotes. They pick up from hotels
in the Riviera Maya on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The $75 cost includes
transportation, activities, a light lunch, locker, and all equipment.
Going shopping
Playa del Carmen offers lots of shopping choices. Most of the stores are
along its popular Avenida 5, or just off to one side or the other. On this
pedestrian-only street, you can find dozens of trendy shops selling
imported batik (Balinese-style) clothing, Guatemalan clothing, premium
tequilas, Cuban cigars, masks, pottery, hammocks, and a few T-shirts.
Throw in a couple of tattoo parlors, and you complete the mix.
Living la vida loca: Playa’s nightlife
It seems like everyone in Playa is out on Avenida 5 or on the square until
10 or 11 p.m. Pleasant strolls, meals and drinks at street-side cafes, and
visiting shops fill the early hours of the evening. Then music starts up at
a few locations on the avenue. For salsa, go to Mambo Café (% 984-803-
2656) on Calle 6 around the corner from Avenida 5. Down by the ferry
dock is a Señor Frog’s (% 987-873-0930), with its patented mix of
thumping dance music, gelatin shots, and frat-house antics; it’s on the
beach at Calle 4. And, of course, there’s the perennial favorite beachside
bar in Playa at the Blue Parrot (% 987-873-0083), on the beach around
the corner from Calle 12.
Chapter 14: Playa del Carmen and the Riviera Maya 227

Area Code
The telephone area code for Playa del
Carmen and Tulum is 984.
Banks, ATMs, and Currency Exchange
Playa has several banks with automated
teller machines, along with several money-
exchange houses. Many of these offices
are close to the pier and along Avenida 5 at
Calle 8. Outside of Playa, Tulum, and Puerto
Morelos there are few ATMs. It’s a good
idea to keep a cash reserve, if you’re stay-
ing elsewhere.
Business Hours
Most offices maintain traditional Mexican
hours of operation (10 a.m.–2 p.m. and from
4 p.m.–8 p.m. daily), but shops remain open
throughout the day. Offices tend to close on
Saturday and Sunday. Shops are usually
open on Saturday but still generally respect
the tradition of closing on Sunday. During
peak season, many shops remain open until
9 or even 10 p.m.
Doctor
For serious medical attention, go to Hospital
Hospiten in Cancún (% 998-881-3700). In
Playa, Dr. Jorge Mercado is a capable gen-
eral practitioner who speaks English. His
office is at the corner of Avenida 10 and
Avenida Constituyentes (% 984-873-3908).
Internet Access
Playa now has many Internet providers 
with high-speed connections. They are
everywhere. Just keep a lookout for signs
with the words “Internet” or “cyber.”
Pharmacy
The Farmacia del Carmen (% 987-873-2330),
on Avenida Juárez between avenidas 5 and
10, is open 24 hours.
Post Office
The post office is on Avenida Juárez, 3 blocks
north of the plaza on the right after the Hotel
Playa del Carmen and the launderette.
Taxes
A 15 percent IVA (value-added tax) is taxed
on goods and services, and it’s generally
included in the posted price.
Telephone
Avoid the phone booths that have signs in
English advising you to call home using a
special 800 number — these booths are
absolute rip-offs and can cost as much as
US$20 per minute. The least expensive way
to call is by using a Telmex (LADATEL) pre-
paid phone card, available at most pharma-
cies and minisupers, using the official
Telmex (Lada) public phones. Remember, in
Mexico, you need to dial 001 prior to a
number to reach the United States, and you
need to preface long-distance calls within
Mexico by dialing 01.

Fast Facts: Playa del Carmen
The Riviera Maya
Aside from Playa del Carmen, the largest towns on this coast are Puerto
Morelos, which is north of Playa, and Puerto Aventuras, Akumal, and
Tulum, which are all to the south. Highway 307 runs the entire length of
the coast. From Cancún to Playa del Carmen (51km/32 miles), it’s a four-
lane divided highway with speed limits up to 110 kmph (68 mph), with

several reduced-speed zones around the major turnoffs. From Playa
to Tulum (80km/50 miles), speed limits are the same, but with more
spots that require you to reduce your speed, and you may find some
construction areas. It takes around 13⁄4 hours to drive from the Cancún
airport to Tulum. Lots of buses travel this stretch of highway, but I prefer
renting a car because many buses only stop in the larger towns, or they
leave you a half-mile from the beach you’re trying to get to. A car gives
you more flexibility. Beyond Tulum is a large natural preserve called the
Sian Ka’an, and from there all the way to Belize the coast is predomi-
nantly mangrove with only a few poor-quality beaches.
It’s always a good idea when traveling this coast to have plenty of cash in
pesos. Outside of Playa del Carmen, you don’t find a lot of banks or cash
machines, and in the smaller towns and resorts and gas stations, you
often can’t pay with a credit card. In Puerto Morelos, there is only one
cash machine in the town, which is out of service on occasion, and
another on the highway at the turnoff junction. After Playa del Carmen,
the next cash machines are in Tulum. One more thing to note: Sometimes
power failures occur on this coast, and they can last a whole day; during
one of these failures, you can’t get cash or gasoline.
Puerto Morelos and environs
Puerto Morelos is a great place for people who want to relax and enjoy
the beach without a lot of hoopla. During low season the place is really
slow and calm. You can walk a mile up and down the beaches with
hardly seeing anyone (and the municipal government does a good job of
maintaining the beaches). Even with the opening of several mega-resorts
in the general vicinity, nothing much has changed in town because most
of the guests in those resorts have little reason to go into Puerto Morelos.
Offshore lies a prominent reef, which is protected by the federal govern-
ment. It’s very shallow and offers good snorkeling. It also protects the
beaches from the surf and allows lots of seagrass to grow. But the water
is as clear and calm as anywhere along the coast, and, because the reefs
have been declared a national park, no motorized watersports are
allowed, which adds to the town’s tranquillity (but windsurfing and
scuba diving are permitted). If you’re looking for this kind of vacation,
you’ll find Puerto Morelos to be a cozy spot. And if you neglected to
bring enough reading material, visit the large English-language bookstore
on the main square, which is open during high season.
Getting there
Drive south from Cancún on Highway 307. At the km 31 marker is a traf-
fic light for the turnoff to Puerto Morelos. It’s well marked. The town is
2km (11⁄4 miles) from the highway. Many buses going either from the
Cancún bus station or the airport to Playa del Carmen stop in Puerto
Morelos. A taxi ride costs about $50.
Chapter 14: Playa del Carmen and the Riviera Maya 229

Getting around
Puerto Morelos is so small that you can get around most of the town on
foot, but you need a car to visit nearby attractions and beaches. Or you
can hire a local taxi, which you can usually find around the main square.
For trips farther away, you can take a bus.
Staying in and around Puerto Morelos
Lodging in Puerto Morelos tends to be simple, except for the four nearby
luxury spa resorts. These resorts target a well-heeled crowd, offering
spa treatments, privacy, and personal service, all in a Caribbean setting.
Rack rates for the least expensive rooms run $400 to $800 a night, but in
the off season, you may score a discount. I review the least expensive of
the four — Ceiba del Mar — in this section.
Of the other three, Paraiso de la Bonita (% 800-327-0200; www.
paraisodelabonitaresort.com) has the largest and most impressive
spa, which specializes in French thalassotherapy (seawater-based spa
treatments). The rooms here are lovely and look out to a great stretch of
beach. Maroma (% 866-454-9351; www.maromahotel.com) has an even
prettier beach, beautiful gardens, and a cozier feel. The rooms are taste-
ful and luxurious, though not as stunning as those at Paraiso de la
Bonita; however, the common areas, especially the beachside restaurant
and bar, are more welcoming. Ikal del Mar (% 888-230-7330; www.
ikaldelmar.com) is smaller and still more private than Maroma.
Accommodations are in large individual palapas tucked away in the
jungle and connected by illuminated paths. The beach is rocky and not
as good for swimming as the beaches at Paraiso and Maroma, but all
three resorts have impressive outdoor pools. If someone were to give
me a gift certificate (please make it out to David Baird) to any of these
resorts, I’d choose Maroma, for its beauty, atmosphere, and beach.
Amar Inn
$
Puerto Morelos
Simple, rustic rooms on the beach, in a home-style setting, make this small
inn a good place for those wanting a quiet seaside retreat. The cordial host-
ess, Ana Luisa Aguilar, is the daughter of Luis Aguilar, a Mexican singer
and movie star of the 1940s and ’50s. She keeps busy promoting environ-
mental and equitable-development causes. She can arrange snorkeling and
fishing trips and jungle tours for guests with small operators. The inn
boasts three cabañas in back, opposite the main house, and five upstairs
rooms with views of the beach. The best is a third-story room with a great
view of the ocean. The cabañas get less of a cross-breeze than the rooms
in the main house but still have plenty of ventilation. They are large and
come with kitchenettes. Rooms in the main building are medium to large.
Bedding choices include one or two doubles, one king-size, or five twin
beds. A full Mexican breakfast is served in the garden.

This resort consists of seven three-story buildings, each with a rooftop

native-style steambath (temascal). The spa is quite complete and offers a
long menu of treatments. The air-conditioned rooms are large, with either
two doubles or one king-size bed, and have a terrace or balcony, and CD
player, TV/VCR, and minibar. The large, well-appointed bathrooms have
shower/tub combinations, marble countertops, and makeup mirrors.
Suites are very large, with two bedrooms, two or three full bathrooms, and
separate entryways. Emphasis is on personal service; for example, each

Hotel Ojo de Agua
$
Puerto Morelos
What I like best about this hotel is that it offers the convenience and serv-
ice of a higher-priced hotel, including a good dive shop and watersports-
equipment rental service. Two three-story buildings stand on the beach
at a right angles to each other. The simply furnished rooms have balconies
or terraces; most have a view of the ocean. Standard rooms have one
double bed. Deluxe rooms are large and have two doubles. Studios have a
double and a twin and a small kitchenette but no air-conditioning (the rest
of the rooms do have A/C). Some rooms come with TV and phone. A highly
respected instructor heads the dive shop. If you’ve wanted to try wind-
surfing, this is the place: The American who rents the boards takes his
time with customers and is quite helpful.

Morelos, points you in the direction of La Posada del Capitán Lafitte. This
Chapter 14: Playa del Carmen and the Riviera Maya 231

lovely seaside retreat sits on a solitary stretch of sandy beach. Here, you
can enjoy being isolated while still having all the amenities of a relaxing
vacation. The one- and two-story white stucco bungalows, which hold one
to four rooms each, stretch along a powdery white beach. They’re small-
ish but comfortable, with tile floors, small, tiled bathrooms, either two
double beds or one king-size bed, and an oceanfront porch. Twenty-nine
bungalows have air-conditioning; the rest have fans. The hotel offers trans-
portation to and from the Cancún airport for $50 per person (minimum of
two passengers). Your room price includes both breakfast and dinner, plus
there’s a poolside grill and bar. Amenities include a medium-sized pool,
dive shop, watersports equipment, and a TV/game room.

Dining in and around Puerto Morelos
Puerto Morelos has a few restaurants. Most are on or around the main
square and include Los Pelícanos for seafood; Hola Asia for Asian food;
and Le Café d’Amancia for coffee and pastries. A couple of blocks away,
in the Hotel Hacienda Morelos, is a German and seafood place called
Bodo’s. There is a pleasant outdoor area over the water. Bodo’s has a
good lunch special and a good menu. The most expensive restaurant in
town is John Grey’s, which is a couple of blocks north of the plaza and
about 3 blocks inland. It’s open for dinner except on Sundays. The owner
is a former chef for the Ritz-Carlton, and I’ve enjoyed his cooking.
Enjoying the great outdoors
Besides stretching out on the beach or by the pool and reading a
favorite book, the main activities are snorkeling, diving, and kayaking.
You can line up these things by asking at one of the local hotels. If you
want to snorkel along the reef, the easiest thing to do is walk out on the
municipal pier, where local fishermen take turns giving snorkeling tours
to visitors. The reef directly offshore is very shallow and is protected by
law. Snorkelers are required to wear a life vest to prevent them from
damaging the reef. This is not much hardship for the snorkeler because
the reef is so shallow that you can see everything from the surface.
Activities on dry land include jungle tours such as the one offered by a
local resident Goyo Morgan, which includes a swim in a cenote (sink-
hole) and a visit to a local ranch ($40 for a half-day tour). Also in the
area are a couple of roadside amusements. One is a zoological park spe-
cializing in crocodiles called Croco Cun (% 998-884-4782). It’s on the
east side of Highway 307, a couple of miles north of the Puerto Morelos
turnoff. It’s an interactive zoo with crocodiles in all stages of develop-
ment, as well as animals of nearly all the species that range, crawl, or
slither around the Yucatán. A visit to the new reptile house is fascinat-
ing, though it may make you think twice about venturing into the jungle.
The rattlesnakes and boa constrictors are particularly intimidating, and
Part V: Exploring the Yucatán 
232

the tarantulas are downright enormous. The guided tour lasts 11⁄2 hours.
Children enjoy the guides’ enthusiasm and are entranced by the spider
monkeys and wild pigs. Wear plenty of bug repellent. The restaurant
sells refreshments. Croco Cun is open daily 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. As with
other attractions of this sort along the coast, entrance fees are high: $18
adult, $12 children 6 to 12, free for children under 6.
Xcaret
Ten kilometers (61⁄2 miles) south of Playa del Carmen (and 80km/50 miles
south of Cancún) is the turnoff to Xcaret (pronounced ish-car-et), an
“eco-archaeological” theme park that many call Mexico’s answer to
Disneyland, with all that the label implies. Attractions are varied and
numerous, kids love it, and the jungle setting and palm-lined beaches are
beautiful. But this “natural” park is highly engineered, down to the Maya
temple–style ticket booths. Admission and food prices are high, and
crowds can be plentiful.
Pathways meander around bathing coves, the snorkeling lagoon, and the
remains of a group of real Maya temples. You have access to swimming
beaches; limestone tunnels to snorkel through; a wild-bird breeding
aviary; a charro (Mexican cowboy) exhibition; horseback riding; scuba
diving; a botanical garden and nursery; a sea turtle nursery that releases
the turtles after their first year; a pavilion showcasing regional butter-
flies; and a tropical aquarium, where visitors can touch underwater crea-
tures such as manta rays, starfish, and octopi. One of the park’s most
popular attractions is the “Dolphinarium,” where visitors (on a first-
come, first-served basis) can swim with the dolphins for an extra charge
of $85 to $115.
Another attraction is the Seawalker, a type of special suit and helmet
with an air hose. You can walk on the ocean floor or examine a coral reef
in a small bay, without having to be constantly going back up for air, as
you would if you were snorkeling. It’s great for nondivers.
The park is famous for its evening spectacle that is a celebration of the
Mexican nation. It is some show, with a large cast and lots of props. It
starts with the Maya and an interpretation of how they may have played
the pre-Hispanic game/ritual known as pok-ta-pok, and then it moves to
another version of a ballgame still practiced in western Mexico. From
there it moves on to the arrival of the Spanish and eventually to the forg-
ing of the new nation, its customs, its dress, and its music and dance.
The visitor center has lockers, first-aid assistance, and a gift shop.
Visitors aren’t allowed to bring in food or drinks, so you’re limited to the
rather high-priced restaurants on-site. No personal radios are allowed,
and you must remove all suntan lotion if you swim in the lagoon to avoid
poisoning the lagoon habitat.
Xcaret is open Monday to Saturday 8:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. and Sunday 8:30 a.m.
to 5:30 p.m. The admission price is $60 per adult, $44 for children 5 to 12.
Chapter 14: Playa del Carmen and the Riviera Maya 233

This entitles you to use the facilities, boats, life jackets, and lounge chairs.
Other attractions cost extra, such as snorkeling tour ($45), horseback
riding ($35), and scuba diving ($55 for certified divers; $75 for a resort
course). Locker rental is $2/day, snorkel equipment $10/day. Some equip-
ment (such as beach chairs) may be scarce, so bring a beach towel and, if
you have it, your own snorkeling gear. For more information, call % 998-
883-3143 or visit www.xcaret.net.
Xpu-Ha
Thirty kilometers (19 miles) south of Xcaret is the beautiful beach of
Xpu-Ha. If you want quality beach time, this is the place. Much of the bay
is taken up by private houses and condos. There are a few all-inclusive
resorts. One is Xpu-Ha Palace and another is the Copacabana. These
suffered great damage with Hurricane Emily, but they are fixed up and
open again. The beach is big enough to accommodate the hotel guests,
residents, and day-trippers without feeling crowded — except on week-
ends, when local people from up and down the coast come for the day.
To get to the beach, turn off when you see the Copacabana resort and
take either the road that goes along the south side of the hotel or the
next road after that. Construction work is always changing the signs and
road around, so I can’t provide specific directions. Another entry point
is just a bit farther south.
If Xpu-Ha sounds like your idea of the perfect home base for a Riviera
Maya vacation, then consider staying at either of these all-inclusives. The
Hotel Copacabana (% 800-562-0197 in the U.S.; www.hotelcopacabana.
com) is owned and operated by an Acapulco-based outfit. The design of
the hotel preserves much of the native flora, with large parts of the 
central area up on stilts. The rooms are in three-story buildings. The hotel
has a lovely pool and, of course, you have the beach beyond it. The Xpu-
Ha Palace (% 866-385-0256 in the U.S.; no local number; www.xpuha-
palace.com) is built on the site of a failed ecopark. The area is lovely.
Rooms are in palapa-style bungalows. This resort has a lot of things for
kids to do, and staying here involves a good amount of walking, because
the hotel is fairly spread out. You can make reservations at either of these
hotels through travel agents or packagers.
Part V: Exploring the Yucatán 
234
Up close and personal with the dolphins
Traveling south from Xcaret, you see the turnoff for Puerto Aventuras 26km (16 miles)
down the road. This marina community has a few restaurants and hotels and a lot of
condos. The buildings are mostly modern glass constructions, which makes Puerto
Aventuras look like a mini-Cancún. Make reservations with Dolphin Discovery
(% 984-883-0779; www.dolphindiscovery.com). If you want to book a fishing
while you are here contact Captain Rick’s Sportfishing Center (% 984-873-5195;
www.fishyucatan.com).

Also on the beach are a few small hotels. Two of these are expensive: Al
Cielo (% 984-840-9012; www.alcielohotel.com) and Esencia (% 984-
873-4830; www.hotelesencia.com). They are lovely places that offer
personal service and attractive rooms away from the crowds. Both are
close to Xpu-Ha Palace. And there are a few simple hotels offering basic
lodging — a couple of beds, a cement floor, small private bathroom, and
minimum decoration. These are rented on a first-come, first-served
basis. Rates vary from $50 to $70 a night, depending upon how busy
they are. Lodging options are better in nearby Akumal, and, if you’re
renting a car, you can come for the day to enjoy the beach.
Akumal
Akumal is a small, ecologically oriented community built on the shores
of two beautiful bays. This community has been around long enough
that it feels more relaxed than the booming places on the coast, such as
Playa and Tulum. It’s popular with families who can rent a condo or a
villa for a week and save money by doing their own cooking. Akumal’s
location makes it a perfect base camp for organizing expeditions for
snorkeling, diving, beachcombing, or visiting the ruins. Otherwise, you
may enjoy just stopping here for a few hours to take a dip and have a
bite at one of the restaurants.
Getting there and getting around
Continue south on Highway 307 from Xpu-Ha for only 3km (2 miles).
You’ll come to the turnoff that is marked with a sign that reads Playa
Akumal. (Don’t be confused by other turnoffs marked Villas Akumal or
Akumal Aventuras or Akumal Beach Resort.) Less than 1km (1⁄2 mile)
down the road is a white arch. Just beyond the arch is Akumal Bay; the
road to the left of the arch takes you to shallow, rocky Half Moon Bay,
lined with two- and three-story villas, and eventually to Yalku Lagoon, a
small, perfectly placid lagoon, good for swimming.
Navigating Akumal is simple. At the white arch, you find a couple of con-
venience stores (including the Super Chomak, where you can buy gro-
ceries) and a good place to take your laundry. Passing through the arch,
you come to Akumal Bay. To the right is the Club Akumal Caribe Hotel. If
you go left and keep to the left, you arrive at Half Moon Bay after cross-
ing some monster speed bumps. (Nobody speeds in this town.) The
same road, after running the distance of the bay, ends at Yalku Lagoon.
Staying in Akumal
You can rent most of the condos and villas in Akumal for a week at a time.
Here are a few agencies specializing in rentals: Info-Akumal (% 800-381-
7048 in the U.S.; www.info-akumal.com), Akumal Vacations (% 800-448-
7137 in the U.S.; www.akumalvacations.com), and Caribbean Fantasy
(% 800-523-6618 in the U.S.; www.caribbfan.com). You can also find
a few hotels, which are a more flexible option because you can rent by
the day.

Enjoying the great outdoors
On Akumal Bay are two dive shops with PADI-certified instructors. The
older is the Akumal Dive Shop (% 984-875-9032; www.akumal.com),
Part V: Exploring the Yucatán 
236

one of the oldest and best dive shops on the coast. Offshore, you can
visit almost 30 dive sites (from 9m–24m or 30 ft.–80 ft. deep). The shop
also specializes in cenote diving at some of the less-visited sites. Both
Akumal Dive Shop and Akumal Dive Adventures (% 984-875-9157), the
dive shop at the Vista del Mar hotel on Half Moon Bay, offer resort
courses as well as complete certification.
A bit beyond Akumal is the turnoff for Aktun Chen cavern (% 998-892-
0662 or 998-850-4190; www.aktunchen.com), a type of ecopark. This
park, consisting of a spectacular 5,000-year-old grotto and an abundance
of wildlife, marks the first time that above-the-ground cave systems in
the Yucatán have been open to the public. The name means “cave with
an underground river inside.” The main cave containing three rivers is
more than 600 yards long with a magnificent vault. Discreet illumination
and easy walking paths make visiting the caves more comfortable, with-
out appearing to alter the caves too much from their natural state. The
caves contain large chambers with thousands of stalactites, stalagmites,
and sculpted rock formations, along with a 12m-deep (40-ft.) cenote with
clear, blue water.
Aktun Chen was once underwater itself, and you can see fossilized shells
and fish embedded in the limestone as you walk along the paths. Caves
are an integral part of this region’s geography and geology, and knowl-
edgeable guides lead you through the site while providing explanations
and offering mini-history lessons on the Maya’s association with these
caves. Tours have no set times — guides are available to take you when
you arrive — and groups are kept to a maximum of 20 people. The tour
takes about an hour and requires a good amount of walking. The footing
is generally good.
Nature trails surround the caves throughout the 395-hectare (988-acre)
park, where spotting deer, spider monkeys, iguanas, and wild turkeys is
common. A small, informal restaurant, gift shop, and zoo with specimens
of the local fauna are also on-site.
You can easily travel to Aktun Chen on your own. On Highway 307 (the
road to Tulum), just past the turnoff for Akumal, a sign on the right side
of the highway indicates the turnoff for Aktun Chen (at km 107, Cancún–
Tulum road). From there, it’s a 3km to 5km (2-mile–3-mile) drive west
along an unpaved road. The park is open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Admission is $17 for adults, $9 for children.
Xel-Ha
Thirteen kilometers (8 miles) south of Akumal is a nature park called
Xel-Ha (% 998-884-9422 in Cancún, 984-873-3588 in Playa, or 984-875-
6000 at the park; www.xelha.com.mx). The centerpiece of Xel-Ha (shell-
hah) is a large, beautiful lagoon where fresh water and salt water meet.
You can swim, float, and snorkel in beautifully clear water surrounded
by jungle. A small train takes guests upriver to a drop-off point. There,
you can store all your clothes and gear in a locked sack that is taken
Chapter 14: Playa del Carmen and the Riviera Maya 237

down to the locker rooms in the main part of the building. The water
moves calmly toward the sea, and you can float along with it. Snorkeling
here offers a higher comfort level than the open sea — no waves and
currents to pull you about, but there’s plenty of marine life to view,
including rays.
Inside the park, you can rent snorkeling equipment and an underwater
camera. Platforms allow nonsnorkelers to view the fish. Another way to
view fish is to use the park’s “snuba” gear — a contraption that allows
you to breathe air through 6m (20-ft.) tubes connected to scuba tanks
floating on the surface. It frees you of the cumbersome tank while allow-
ing you to stay down without having to hold your breath. Rental costs
$42 for approximately an hour. Like snuba but more elaborate is “sea-
trek,” a device consisting of an elaborate plastic helmet with air hoses. 
It allows you to walk around on the bottom breathing normally and per-
haps participate in feeding the park’s stingrays. Another attraction is
swimming with dolphins. A one-hour swim costs $115; a 15-minute pro-
gram costs $40. Make reservations (% 998-887-6840) at least 24 hours
in advance for one of the four daily sessions.
Other attractions include a plant nursery; an apiary for the local, sting-
less Maya bees; and a lovely path through the tropical forest bordering
the lagoon. Xel-Ha is open daily from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Parking is free.
Admission is $33 adults, and $23 children ages 5 to 11; children under 5
enter free. Admission includes use of inner tubes, life vest, and shuttle
train to the river, and the use of changing rooms and showers. (Though
not listed on the Web page, the park often has discount admission
during the weekend.) An all-inclusive option includes snorkeling equip-
ment rental, locker rental, towels, food, and beverages. The park has five
restaurants, two ice-cream shops, and a store. It accepts American
Express, MasterCard, and Visa, and has an ATM.
If you have the opportunity don’t miss the ruins of ancient Xel-Ha. As
you walk over limestone rocks and through the tangle of trees, vines,
and palms Notice the huge, deep, dark cenote to one side, a temple
palace with tumbled-down columns, a jaguar group, and a conserved
temple group. A palapa shelter on one pyramid guards a partially pre-
served mural. Admission is $2.50.
Xel-Ha is also close to the ruins at Tulum (see Chapter 15) and makes a
good place for a dip after you finish climbing the Maya ruins. The best
time to visit both sites is during the weekend when fewer people attend
the park or the ruins.
On the way to Tulum
Only a couple of kilometers past Xel-Ha, you see a sign on your right
advertising Hidden Worlds Cenotes center (% 984-877-8535; www.
hiddenworlds.com.mx), which offers an excellent opportunity to snorkel
or dive in a couple of nearby caverns. The caverns are part of a vast 
network that makes up a single underground river system. The water is
Part V: Exploring the Yucatán 
238

crystalline (and a bit cold) and the rock formations impressive. These 
caverns were filmed for the IMAX production Journey into Amazing Caves.
If you’ve been considering snorkeling or diving in a cenote to see what it’s
like, this spot is the perfect place to do so. The site is close to a good dive
shop. Snorkel tours cost $40 and take you to two different caverns. The
main form of transportation is “jungle mobile,” with a guide who throws in
tidbits of information and lore about the jungle plant life that you see.
Some walking is involved, so take shoes or sandals.
After you pass Hidden Worlds, the next couple of turnoffs to the left
lead to Soliman and Tankah bays. On Punta Soliman Bay is a good
beach restaurant called Oscar y Lalo’s, where you can rent kayaks and
snorkel equipment and paddle out to the reefs for some snorkeling.
Approximately 3km (2 miles) farther is the turnoff for Tankah. Pull in
here, and you come to a cenote by a lovely bay. The bay is good for
snorkeling. The palapa restaurant next to the cenote serves grilled food.
A couple of small hotels are on this bay. The most interesting is Casa
Cenote (% 998-874-5170; www.casacenote.com). It has an under-
ground river that surfaces at a cenote in the back of the property then
goes underground and bubbles up into the sea just a few feet offshore.
Casa Cenote has seven rooms, all on the beach. The double rate, includ-
ing breakfast and dinner at the restaurant, is $190. The owner, an
American, provides kayaks and snorkeling gear and can arrange dives,
fishing trips, and sailing charters.
Tulum
About 15km (10 miles) south of Xel-Ha is the walled Maya city of Tulum,
a large post-Classic site overlooking the Caribbean in a dramatic setting.
(See Chapter 15 for a description.) You also find the small town of 
present-day Tulum and on the coast a long stretch of beautiful beach
dotted with small cabaña hotels. The only electricity here is what’s 
generated by each hotel. Tulum is a good choice if you like to splash
around in the water and lie on the beach far away from the resort scene.
The town has a half-dozen restaurants, three cybercafes, a bank, and
three cash machines.
Getting there and getting around
The town of Tulum (130km/81miles from Cancún) lies directly on the
highway a little beyond the entrance to the ruins. But before you get to
the town, you come to a highway intersection with a traffic light. The
road to the left leads to the Hotel Zone.
Don’t expect much when you arrive in Tulum. It’s a small town. The com-
mercial area consists of eight blocks of buildings fronting the highway.
And the rest of the town only extends for a couple of blocks on either
side of the road. To get to the hotels on the beach, turn east at the high-
way intersection that’s located just as you enter the town. (To the west
is the highway to Cobá, see Chapter 15.) Go 3km (2 miles), and you’ll run
into a “T” junction. The road to the north goes only about a mile north.
Chapter 14: Playa del Carmen and the Riviera Maya 239

The road south leads to the Sian Ka’an Biosphere Reserve and eventu-
ally stretches all the way to the end of the Punta Allen peninsula. The
road can make for slow going.
Staying in Tulum
You can stay either at one of the cabaña hotels on the beach or in one of
the cheap hotels in town, most of which go for between $35 and $55 per
night. Staying in town is obviously not as much fun. There are about 20
cabaña hotels to choose from, and they run the gamut from minimal
lodging requirements to refined luxury. All these hotels have to produce
their own electricity, so to offer air-conditioning a hotel will have to
operate a massive generator.
Ana y José
$$$
Punta Allen Peninsula
These cabañas offer a tranquil escape that feels worlds away from the rest
of civilization and provide sufficient creature comforts to make for a relax-
ing stay. The beach in front of the hotel is pure white sand. The rock-walled
cabañas closest to the water (called “oceanfront”) are a little larger than the
others and come with two double beds. So far, they haven’t been remod-
eled, and I like the simpler feel. I also like the attractive second-floor “vista
al mar” rooms, which have tall palapa roofs. The standard rooms are much
like the others but don’t face the sea. Recent remodeling has given all the
rooms except for the first mentioned a real polished look, with stone coun-
tertops and tile floors and even air-conditioning in the ground-floor units.
Electricity is available 24 hours a day. The hotel, located 6km (4 miles) from
the Tulum ruins, can have a rental car waiting for you at the Cancún airport.
Reservations are a must for any time of year, and around Christmas and the
New Year, the rates are higher than normal high-season prices.

windows, a table, one electric light, and a porch facing the beach.
Electricity is available from 7 to 11 a.m. and 6 to 11 p.m. Billiard and Ping-

A good choice for a no-fuss beach vacation, this hotel has a Robinson
Crusoe-type feel. The one- and two-story cottages are spread out through
the vegetation. Rooms are simply furnished and come with ceiling fans,
and almost all have private patios or porches. Price varies according to
the size of the rooms. The cheapest room is pretty small, and the highest
end is nice and large. The electricity is solar-generated and comes on at
6 p.m. The property is well-forested with a pure sand beach.

Punta Allen Peninsula
The owners of these cabañas, a couple from San Francisco, have made
their rustic getaway most enjoyable by concentrating on the essentials:
comfort, privacy, and good food. The cabañas are simple, attractive, well
situated for catching the breeze, and not too close together. Most rooms
are in individual structures; the suites and oversize rooms are in modest
two-story buildings. For the money, I like the six individual garden palapas,
which are attractive and comfortable, with either two double beds or a
double and a twin. Two small beachfront cabañas with one double bed go
for a little less. The most expensive rooms are the upstairs oceanview
units, which enjoy a large terrace and lots of sea breezes. I like these espe-
cially. They come with a king- and a queen-size bed or a double and a
queen-size bed. The restaurant serves the freshest seafood — I’ve seen
the owner actually flag down passing fishermen to buy their catch. A
white-sand beach stretches between large rocky areas.

Dining in Tulum
A few restaurants in the town of Tulum have reasonable prices and good
food. Charlie’s (% 987-871-2136), my favorite for Mexican food, and
Don Cafeto’s (% 987-871-2207) are two safe bets. Both places are on
the main street. There’s a good Italian restaurant called Il Giardino di
Toni e Simone (% 044-987-804-1316, a cellphone; closed Wed) 1 block
off the highway. 
Enjoying the great outdoors
In the Tulum area, the main thing to do is to visit the Tulum ruins.
Staying here gives you the advantage of seeing them early in the morn-
ing before it gets hot and before the large tour buses (and attendant
Chapter 14: Playa del Carmen and the Riviera Maya 241

crowds) arrive. If you have a car, you can also visit the nearby ruins of
Cobá. For more on these two ruins sites, see Chapter 15.
You can arrange an interesting day trip to visit the mammoth Sian Ka’an
Biopreserve. You’re guaranteed to see several species of wildlife and
learn some interesting things about the plant life in the area. Most tours
include a boat ride around the park’s large lagoon and perhaps through
one of the canals that connect it to small lakes. Visitors can arrange day
trips in Tulum from a few different outfits, whose offices are just a
couple of blocks apart and even have similar names. Sian Ka’an Tours
(% 984-871-2363; siankaan_tours@hotmail.com) is on the west side of
Avenida Tulum, next to El Basilico Restaurant, at the corner of Calle
Beta. Community Sian Ka’an Tours is on the same side of the road, 2
blocks north between Orion and Centauro streets (% 984-114-0750;
www.siankaantours.org). The latter is a community organization of
Muyil and Punta Allen. Both will pick up customers from any of the area
hotels.

Nearby Ruins
In This Chapter
 Choosing which ruins to visit
 Getting there and back
 Exploring the ruins
 Understanding the ancient Maya
F
rom top to bottom and from coast to coast, the Yucatán is littered
with the ruined cities and settlements of the ancient Maya. At its
peak, the area must have been super-populated, for even today it seems
that you can hardly trek out into the jungle without tripping over some
yet-undiscovered site.
Of course, most of these smaller ruins aren’t of interest to the casual
observer because they’re mere mounds of earth and stone overgrown by
forest; they tell you nothing about the past. It’s only with excavation and
reconstruction that you can get an idea of what this ancient civilization
was all about, and, even then, seeing these cities reconstructed gener-
ally begs more questions than it answers. But they’re fascinating sights
with dramatic architecture and exotic surroundings. If you can tear your-
self away for a day from the comforts of beach life, you may enjoy a visit
to one or more of these places.
All of the Yucatán is “tierra caliente” (the hotlands), so be prepared.
Take sun protection and remember that you’ll be walking and perhaps
climbing at these sites, so you need comfortable shoes or sandals and a
bottle of water. And try to see the sights as early in the day as possible.
At Cobá, you need mosquito repellent.
Deciding Which Ruins to Visit
From Cancún or anywhere else along the Caribbean coast, four major
ruins are within easy reach and worth visiting. Each is remarkably differ-
ent from the others, offering a lot of variety. But don’t try to see more

Part V: Exploring the Yucatán 
244
than one or two; leave the rest for another trip. You can easily overdo
the ruins, and they’re best appreciated when viewed with fresh eyes.
 Chichén Itzá: No, it doesn’t rhyme with “chicken pizza”; the
accents are on the last syllables (chee chin eat-zah). Without a
doubt, this complex is the marquee ruins site of the Yucatán. You
can marvel at many things here, but the most famous sights are the
much-photographed pyramid known as El Castillo; the mysterious
and ancient-looking sacrificial cenote (say-noh-teh, a natural well
or sinkhole found only in the Yucatán), which is 54m (180 ft.)
across and 18m (60 ft.) down to the water; and the great ballcourt
adorned with graphic depictions of players literally losing their
heads. Chichén Itzá is in the heart of the Yucatán, two hours by car
from Cancún. Many day tours by bus leave from Cancún, Playa del
Carmen, and most of the big resorts. Or you can rent your own car
and stay overnight in the area.
 Tulum: Built later than Chichén Itzá and on a much smaller scale,
these ruins represent the only major coastal ruins in this part of
the Yucatán. The setting is gorgeous: Picture a stylish Maya pyra-
mid crowning a tall cliff jutting out over the turquoise waters of the
Caribbean, and you’ve got the idea. Below this pyramid is a pretty
little beach, so take your swimsuit. To me, the buildings in Tulum
are less grand than those of the other three sites, but the other
three don’t have the Caribbean setting. Tulum is 11⁄2 hours south of
Cancún.
 Cobá: Older than Chichén Itzá and much larger than Tulum, Cobá
was the dominant city of the eastern Yucatán before A.D. 1000. The
site is large and spread out. Two lakes border the ruins, and the
tropical forest grows thickly between the different temple groups.
Rising high above the forest canopy are tall, steep classic Maya pyr-
amids. Of the four sites, this one is the least reconstructed, and so
disappoints those who expect another Chichén Itzá. Appreciating it
requires a greater exercise of the imagination. Cobá is a little more
than a half-hour inland from Tulum.
Tourism in the Yucatán follows a weekly cycle, and from Friday to Sunday
is when most are traveling back and forth. This fact makes weekends the
best time for visiting the ruins. Also, it’s obviously much more comfort-
able to view the ruins in the cool of the morning than in the heat of the
afternoon.
Chichén Itzá
Many people coming to the Yucatán for the first time will feel the need to
see these ruins, if only so as not to have to explain to their friends and
neighbors how it was that they traveled this far without seeing them.
Although it’s true that Chichén Itzá is plenty hyped, it does live up to its
reputation. But if ruins aren’t your cup of tea and the beach is, have the
courage of your convictions and be ready to tell people who ask that it’s

none of their business what you did on your vacation. I do this as a
matter of principle.
If you plan to see these ruins, the question to ask yourself is whether
you want to overnight here. The advantage is that you can catch the
sound-and-light show at night and then see the ruins in the early morn-
ing when it’s cooler and before the tour buses arrive. The drawback is
that you need to rent a car or take regular bus service.
Getting there
Chichén Itzá is on the old main Highway 180 in the interior of the penin-
sula. To get there by car, you can take the modern autopista (toll high-
way) and take the exit for Chichén Itzá and the village of Pisté. It’s
clearly marked. The toll is expensive ($22) but much faster than the free
Highway 180, which takes you through a lot of tiny villages and over
their not-so-tiny speed bumps. Once you exit the toll road, you will be on

a connecting road that joins with the old highway at the village of Pisté.
It will be a “T” junction. Turn left.
Any number of bus tours depart from Cancún and Playa del Carmen.
These tours usually stop a few times for lunch, a snack, or a swim. You
usually arrive at the ruins around noon or shortly thereafter, and you’re
back in Cancún or Playa del Carmen by nightfall. Regular bus service is
trickier and more frequent from Cancún than from Playa del Carmen.
Where to stay
The expensive hotels in Chichén all occupy beautiful grounds, are close to
the ruins, and have good food. All have toll-free reservations numbers,
which I recommend. Some of these hotels do a lot of business with tour
operators — they can be empty one day and full the next. The inexpensive
hotels are in the village of Pisté, 2km (11⁄4 miles) away. This village is not
very interesting. Another option would be to stay in the nearby city of
Valladolid.
Hacienda Chichén
$$$
At the ruins
The smallest and most private of the hotels at the ruins is also the quietest
and the least likely to have bus tour groups. This was the hacienda that
served as the headquarters for the Carnegie Institute’s excavations in
1923. Several bungalows, built to house the staff, have been modernized
and are now the guest rooms. Each is simply and comfortably furnished
(with a dehumidifier and ceiling fan in addition to air-conditioning) and is
a short distance from the others. Each bungalow has a private porch from
which you can enjoy the beautiful grounds. Standard rooms come with two
twin or two double beds. Suites are larger and have larger bathrooms and
double or queen-size beds. The main building was part of the original
hacienda and holds the restaurant, which offers dining on the terrace by
the pool or inside in air-conditioning.

The main doorway frames El Caracol (the observatory) in a stunning view —
that’s how close this hotel is to the ruins. If a drawback exists, it’s that the
hotel books large bus tours, but this isn’t so bad because the hotel is on a
large piece of property that uses space liberally. The main building is long
and three stories high. The rooms are large, with comfortable beds and large
tiled bathrooms. The suites are on the top floor of the main building and
come with terraces and two-person Jacuzzis. Bungalows, scattered about the
rest of the grounds, are built native-style, with thatched roofs and stucco
walls; they’re a good deal larger than the rooms. The grounds, including three

Exploring Chichén Itzá
When you visualize a Maya pyramid, chances are that it’s the main pyra-
mid at Chichén Itzá that springs to mind. It’s called El Castillo and it’s
dedicated to the feathered serpent god Kukulkán. No doubt you have
seen pictures of it everywhere — in guidebooks, on posters, and on Web
sites. The funny thing is that El Castillo shouldn’t be the poster child for
Maya architecture. It doesn’t look like most Maya pyramids, and experts
know for certain that the god Kukulkán was not originally worshipped in
the Maya heartland but came here from Central Mexico (where he was
known as Quetzalcoatl). Also, many architectural features of this city are
strikingly similar to the Toltec city of Tula, in Central Mexico.
The burning question about Chichén Itzá (Chichén, for short) is, “Who
really ran the show here?” Experts know that they called themselves the
“Itzá,” and, indeed, the name of the city means “Well of the Itzá.” And it’s
pretty certain that the ones following orders here — the laborers, peas-
ants, and artisans — were native Maya. Most scholars believe that the
head honchos were either invading Toltecs who later intermarried with
the Maya, or the Putún Maya, a merchant people from the lower Gulf
coast who were more receptive to foreign influences than their neighbors
Part V: Exploring the Yucatán 
248

in the Yucatán interior. Or maybe it was a combination of both. More 
digging at the site is necessary to answer this question, and that event
doesn’t look likely anytime soon.
Chichén Itzá occupies 6.5 sq. km (4 sq. miles), and it takes most of a day
to see all the ruins. Hours for the site are 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily. Service
areas are open 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. Admission is $11, free for children
under 12. A video camera permit costs $4.50. Parking is extra. Chichén
Itzá’s sound-and-light show is worth seeing and is included in the cost
of admission. For more information, see the “More cool things to see
and do” section later in this section.
The large, modern visitor center, at the main entrance where you pay the
admission charge, is beside the parking lot and consists of a museum, an
auditorium, a restaurant, a bookstore, and bathrooms. You can see the
site on your own or with a licensed guide who speaks English or Spanish.
Guides usually wait at the entrance and charge around $45 for one to six
people. Although the guides frown on it, there’s nothing wrong with
approaching a group of people who speak the same language and asking
whether they want to share a guide. Be wary of the history-spouting
guides — some of it is just plain out-of-date — but the architectural details
they point out are enlightening. Chichén Itzá has two parts: the northern
(new) zone, which shows distinct Toltec influence, and the southern (old)
zone, with mostly Puuc architecture.
El Castillo pyramid
Once you pass the entrance gates, El Castillo pyramid will be in front of
you. At 23m (75 ft.) tall, the pyramid is a giant numbers game tied to the
old pre-Columbian calendars: Four stairways have 91 steps each, which
adds up to 364; when you add the top platform where they meet, the
total is 365, the number of days in a year. On each side of these stair-
ways are 9 terraces, making a total of 18 per side, which is the number of
months in their solar calendar. Each face has 52 panels, equaling the 52
years that represented the magical cycle for all pre-Hispanic civiliza-
tions. This time period is how long it would take for the solar and the
religious calendars to coincide.
Consider the pyramid’s mysterious alignment. It’s positioned so that twice
a year, on the spring and fall equinoxes (Mar 21 and Sept 21), the corner
edges of the pyramid cast shadows on the sides of the north stairway;
these shadows resemble the geometric patterns on the body of a snake
such as the diamondback. At the bottom of each side of the north stair-
way is a serpent’s head carved in stone, so the shadow effect was proba-
bly intentional. As the sun rises, the shadows, representing the body of
the snake, move slowly downward, making the “serpent” appear to
descend into the ground. To be honest, watching the shadow effects is
more of an intellectual curiosity than a dramatic sight, especially for those
raised on the high-excitement Indiana Jones movies. I don’t think it’s
worth fighting the crowds that come to witness it. In truth, experts don’t
know what the pyramid may have looked like originally, because all the
Chapter 15: A Taste of the Maya: Nearby Ruins 249

surfaces of this pyramid, including the stairways, were covered with 
a thick coat of smooth stucco and painted bright colors, perhaps in 
patterns.
El Castillo was an enlargement of an earlier pyramid. The Maya frequently
did this kind of thing. Archaeologists have carved a narrow stairway into
the pyramid at the western edge of the north staircase. It leads inside to
the temple of the original structure, to a sacrificial altar-throne — a red
jaguar encrusted with jade. The stairway is open from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.;
the inside is cramped, humid, and uncomfortable. A visit as close to the
opening time as possible is best. Photos of the jaguar figure are forbidden.
Juego de Pelota (the main ball court)
Among all the peoples of pre-Columbian Mexico, there existed a popular
game that was part ritual, part sport. Historians only know of it as “the
ball game” or “pok-ta-pok” in Mayan. Ball courts have been found as far
north as New Mexico and as far south as Honduras and everywhere in
between. The main court at Chichén is one of at least nine in this city
and is much larger and better preserved than any ball court found else-
where. You’ll see it immediately northwest of El Castillo. Carved on both
walls of the ball court are scenes showing Maya figures dressed as ball
players and decked out in heavy protective padding. The carved scene
also shows a headless player kneeling with blood shooting from his
neck; another player holding the head looks on.
Players on two teams tried to knock a hard rubber ball through one of
the two stone rings placed high on either wall, using only their elbows,
knees, and hips (no hands). According to legend, the losing players paid
for defeat with their lives. However, some experts say the victors were
the only appropriate sacrifices for the gods. One can only guess what
the incentive for winning may be in that case. Either way, the game must
have been riveting, heightened by the wonderful acoustics of the ball
court.
Other highlights of Chichén Itzá
Temples are at both ends of the ball court. The North Temple has sculp-
tured pillars and more sculptures inside, as well as badly ruined murals.
The acoustics of the ball court are so good that from the North Temple,
a person speaking can be heard clearly at the opposite end, about 136m
(450 ft.) away.
Follow the dirt road (actually an ancient sacbé, or causeway) that heads
north from the Platform of Venus; after five minutes, you come to Cenote
de los Sacrificios (Sacrificial Cenote), the great natural well that may
have given Chichén Itzá its name. This well was used for ceremonial pur-
poses, not for drinking water — according to legend, sacrificial victims
were drowned in this pool to honor the rain god Chaac. Research done
early in the 20th century uncovered bones of both children and adults in
the well.
Part V: Exploring the Yucatán 
250

Edward Thompson, who was the American consul in Mérida, purchased
the ruins of Chichén early in the 20th century and explored the cenote
with dredges and divers. His explorations exposed a fortune in gold and
jade. Most of the riches wound up in Harvard’s Peabody Museum of
Archaeology and Ethnology — a matter that continues to be of concern
to Mexican archaeologists. Excavations in the 1960s unearthed more
treasure, and studies of the recovered objects detail offerings from
throughout the Yucatán and even farther away.
Due east of El Castillo is the Templo de los Guerreros (Temple of the
Warriors), named for the carvings of warriors marching along its walls.
It’s also called the Group of the Thousand Columns for the rows of
broken pillars that flank it. During the recent restoration, hundreds more
of the columns were rescued from the rubble and put in place, setting off
the temple more magnificently than ever. A figure of Chaac-Mool sits at
the top of the temple, surrounded by impressive columns carved to look
like enormous feathered serpents. South of the temple was a square
building that archaeologists called the Market (mercado); a colonnade
surrounds its central court. Beyond the temple and the market in the
jungle are mounds of rubble, parts of which are being reconstructed.
Construction of the El Caracol (the Observatory), a complex building
with a circular tower, was carried out over centuries; the additions and
modifications reflected the Maya’s careful observation of celestial move-
ments and their need for increasingly exact measurements. Through slits
in the tower’s walls, astronomers could observe the cardinal directions
and the approach of the all-important spring and autumn equinoxes, as
well as the summer solstice. The temple’s name, which means “snail
shell,” comes from a spiral staircase within the structure.
On the east side of El Caracol, a path leads north into the bush to the
Cenote Xtoloc, a natural limestone well that provided the city’s daily
water supply. If you see any lizards sunning there, they may well be
xtoloc, the lizard for which this cenote is named.
More cool things to see and do
From cave visits to laser shows, Chichén and the surrounding area hold
even more interest for travelers.
 “Head” on over to Tzompantli (the Temple of the Skulls). To the
right of the ball court is the Temple of the Skulls, an obvious bor-
rowing from the post-Classic cities of central Mexico. Notice the
rows of skulls carved into the stone platform. When a sacrificial
victim’s head was cut off, it was impaled on a pole and displayed in
a tidy row with others. Also carved into the stone are pictures of
eagles tearing hearts from human victims. The word Tzompantli is
not Mayan but comes from Central Mexico. Reconstruction using
scattered fragments may add a level to this platform and change
the look of this structure by the time you visit.
Chapter 15: A Taste of the Maya: Nearby Ruins 251

 Stay for the evening sound-and-light show. The kind of severe
geometry characteristic of Maya architecture really lends itself to
this kind of spectacle; besides, you already paid for the show when
you bought you ticket. The show, held at 7 or 8 p.m. depending on
the season, is in Spanish, but headsets are available for rent ($4.50)
in several languages so that you can enjoy the dramatic narrative.
 Visit Chichén Viejo (Old Chichén). For a look at more of Chichén’s
oldest buildings, constructed well before the time of Toltec influ-
ence, follow signs from the Edifice of the Nuns southwest into the
bush to Old Chichén, about 1km (1⁄2 mile) away. Be prepared for this
trek with long trousers, insect repellent, and a local guide. The
attractions here are the Templo de los Inscripciones Iniciales
(Temple of the First Inscriptions), with the oldest inscriptions dis-
covered at Chichén; and the restored Templo de los Dinteles
(Temple of the Lintels), a fine Puuc building.
 Swim in the cenote of Ik-Kil. Ik-Kil is a large cenote on the highway
just across from the Hotel Dolores Alba, 2.5km (11⁄2 miles) east of
the main entrance to the ruins. And it’s deep, with lots of steps
leading down to the water’s edge. Unlike Dzitnup, these steps are
easy to manage. The view from both the top and the bottom is dra-
matic, with lots of tropical vegetation and curtains of hanging tree
roots stretching all the way to the water’s surface. Take your swim-
suit and enjoy the cold water. The best swimming is before 11:30 a.m.,
at which time bus tours start arriving from the coast. These bus
tours are the main business of Ik-Kil, which also has a restaurant
and souvenir shops. Ik-Kil is open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily.
Admission is $6 per adult, $3 per child 7 to 12 years old.
 Explore the cave of Balankanché. You see signs for this cave
about 5.5km (31⁄2 miles) from Chichén Itzá on the old highway to
Cancún. The entire excursion takes about a half-hour, but the walk
inside is hot and humid. The highlight is a round chamber with a
central column the size of a large tree trunk. You come up the same
way you go down. The cave became a hideaway during the War of
the Castes. You can still see traces of carving and incense burning,
as well as an underground stream that served as the sanctuary’s
water supply. Outside, take time to meander through the botanical
gardens, where most of the plants and trees are labeled with their
common and scientific names. The caves are open daily. Admission
is $6, free for children 6 to 12. Children younger than age 6 are not
admitted. Use of a video camera costs $4 (free if you’ve already
bought a video permit in Chichén the same day). Tours in English
are at 11 a.m., 1 p.m., and 3 p.m.; and, in Spanish, at 9 a.m., noon,
2 p.m., and 4 p.m. Double-check these hours at the main entrance
to the Chichén ruins.
 Check out Cenotes Dzitnup and Sammulá. The Cenote Dzitnup
(also known as Cenote Xkekén) is along the same Highway 180 as
Balankanché, about 32km (20 miles) farther toward Cancún. It’s
Part V: Exploring the Yucatán 
252

worth a side trip, especially if you have time for a dip. Watch for
the signs. When you get there, you descend a short flight of rather
perilous stone steps, and at the bottom, inside a beautiful cavern,
is a natural pool of water so clear and blue that it seems plucked
from a dream. If you decide to swim, be sure that you don’t have
creams or other chemicals on your skin — they damage the habitat
of the small fish and other organisms living there. Also, no alcohol,
food, or smoking is allowed in the cavern. Admission is $2. The
cenote is open daily 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. About 100 yards down the road
on the opposite side is another recently discovered cenote,
Sammulá, where you can also swim. Admission is $2.

Tulum: Fortress City
Tulum was a Maya fortress-city built over the most rugged part of the
coast. In looking at the layout and scope of the city, it becomes clear
that the builders of this citadel were interested in two things uppermost:
trade and defense. And they picked the perfect spot for their city. It is a
beautiful site facing out over the Caribbean. On the city’s other three
sides they constructed stout walls with watchtowers and fortified areas.
The stonework used to build the ceremonial centers is of poorer quality
than in other sites such as Chichén or Cobá, as if the temples were con-
structed in haste.
Tulum is also the name of the laid-back town adjacent to the ruins,
where you find beautiful and mostly isolated beaches, as well as a string
of interesting hotels. For more on Tulum the town, see Chapter 14.
The city’s origins date from the ninth century, which was the end of the
Classic period and the beginning of Maya civilization’s decline. The large
cities to the south were abandoned, and smaller city-states rose to fill
the void. Tulum was one of these city-states. Its original name was
“Zama,” meaning dawn, a good name because it obviously faces east
toward the rising sun. It came to prominence in the 13th century as a

seaport, controlling maritime commerce along this section of the coast,
and remained inhabited well after the arrival of the Spanish. The pri-
mary god here was the diving god, depicted on several buildings as an
upside-down figure above doorways. Seen at the Palace at Sayil and
Cobá, this curious, almost comical figure is also known as the bee god.
The most imposing building in Tulum is a large stone structure above
the cliff called the Castillo (castle). Actually a temple as well as a
fortress, it was once covered with stucco and painted. In front of the
Castillo are several unrestored palacelike buildings with partial remains
of the old stucco covering. On the beach below, where the Maya once
came ashore, visitors swim and sunbathe, combining a visit to the ruins
with a dip in the Caribbean.
The Temple of the Frescoes, directly in front of the Castillo, contains
interesting 13th-century wall paintings, though entry is no longer permit-
ted. Distinctly Maya, they represent the rain god Chaac and Ixchel, the
goddess of weaving, women, the moon, and medicine. On the cornice of
this temple is a relief of the head of the rain god. If you pause a slight
distance from the building, you see the eyes, nose, mouth, and chin.
Notice the remains of the red-painted stucco — at one time, all the build-
ings at Tulum were painted bright red.
Much of what historians know of Tulum at the time of the Spanish
Conquest comes from the writings of Diego de Landa, third bishop of the
Yucatán. He wrote that Tulum was a small city inhabited by about 600
people who lived in platform dwellings along a street and who super-
vised the trade from Honduras to the Yucatán. Although it was a walled
city, most of the inhabitants probably lived outside the walls, leaving the
interior for the residences of governors and priests and ceremonial
structures. Tulum survived about 70 years after the Conquest, when it
was finally abandoned. Because of the great number of visitors this site
receives, the staff doesn’t allow visitors to climb the ruins. They ask that
you remain outside roped-off areas.
The ruins are open to visitors from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. in the winter and
from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. in the summer. If you can, go early before the
crowds start showing up around 9:30 a.m. The entrance to the ruins is
about a five-minute walk from the archaeological site. You find artisans’
stands, a bookstore, a museum, a restaurant, several large bathrooms,
and a ticket booth. After walking through the center, visitors pay the
admission fee to the ruins ($4), another fee ($1.50) if you choose to ride
an open-air shuttle to the ruins, and, if you’re driving, another fee ($3) to
park. A video camera permit costs $4. Licensed guides have a stand next
to the path to the ruins and charge $20 for a 45-minute tour in English,
French, or Spanish for up to four persons. They can point out many
architectural details that you may otherwise miss.

Cobá (“Water Stirred by Wind”)
The Maya built many intriguing cities in the Yucatán, but few grander
than Cobá (“water stirred by wind”). Much of the 67-sq.-km (42-sq.-mile)
site, on the shores of two lakes, is unexcavated. A 96km (60-mile) long
sacbé (a pre-Hispanic raised road or causeway) through the jungle —
remains of which are still visible — linked Cobá to Yaxuná, once a large,
important Maya center 48km (30 miles) south of Chichén Itzá. It’s the
Maya’s longest known sacbé, and at least 50 shorter ones lead from here.
Cobá flourished from A.D. 632 (the oldest carved date found here) until
after the founding of Chichén Itzá, around 800. Then Cobá slowly faded
in importance and population until it was finally abandoned. Scholars
believe Cobá was an important trade link between the Yucatán
Caribbean coast and inland cities.

You can line up a bus tour to Cobá from Cancún or Playa del Carmen.
(See Chapters 11 and 14 for details.) If you’re driving, follow Highway
307 down the coast to Tulum. After you pass the entrance to those ruins,
you’ll see a highway intersection with a traffic light. Turn right and
follow this road for 40 minutes to reach the ruins. Always be on your
guard for the ever-present speed bumps known as topes. They some-
times appear without warning. A couple of small restaurants are in the
town, with another one in the Hotel Villa Arqueológica.
Once at the site, keep your bearings — getting lost on the maze of dirt
roads in the jungle is easy, and be sure to bring bug spray. Past the
entrance are some bike renters. Consider renting a bike. The price isn’t
much, and biking along the trails is easy and fun. Branching off from
every labeled path are unofficial narrow paths into the jungle, used by
locals as shortcuts through the ruins.
The Grupo Cobá boasts a large, impressive pyramid, La Iglesia (Temple
of the Church), which you can find if you take the path bearing right
after the entrance. Walking to it, notice the unexcavated mounds on the
left. Although the urge to climb the temple is great, the view is better
from El Castillo in the Nohoch Mul group farther back.
From here, return to the main path and turn right. You pass a sign point-
ing right to the ruined juego de pelota (ball court), but the path is
obscure.
Continuing straight ahead on this path for five to ten minutes, you come
to a fork in the road. To the left and right are jungle-covered, unexcavated
pyramids, and at one point, you see a raised portion crossing the path-
way, which is the visible remains of the sacbé to Yaxuná. Throughout
the area, stelae (the free-standing sculpted stone columns that the Maya
were so fond of making) stand by pathways or lie forlornly in the jungle
underbrush. Although protected by crude thatched roofs, most are too
weatherworn for the observer to discern the carvings.
The left fork leads to the Nohoch Mul Group, which contains El Castillo.
With the exception of Structure 2 in Calakmul, this pyramid is the tallest
in the Yucatán (rising even higher than the great El Castillo at Chichén
Itzá and the Pyramid of the Magician at Uxmal). So far, visitors are still
permitted to climb to the top. From this magnificent lofty perch, you can
see unexcavated, jungle-covered pyramidal structures poking up
through the forest all around.
The right fork (more or less straight on) goes to the Conjunto Las
Pinturas. Here, the main attraction is the Pyramid of the Painted Lintel,
a small structure with traces of its original bright colors above the door.
You can climb up to get a close look. Although maps of Cobá show ruins
around two lakes, only two groups of ruins have truly been excavated.

Ten (or So) Top Myths and
Misconceptions about
Mexico
In This Chapter
 Getting the geography straight
 Dissecting the stereotypical preconceptions
 Solving food and drink misconceptions
I
f you’ve never visited Mexico, you may have some preconceptions
about what you’re likely to find here. Perhaps you think that the
geography — apart from the beaches — is an arid landscape with a uni-
formly hot climate. Or you may think that you should drink tequila only
as a shot — doused with lime and salt.
This chapter explains some of the most common misconceptions about
this vast country and its rich culture. Read on — and the next time
someone starts talking about how you can’t drink the water in Mexico,
you can set them straight!
Don’t Drink the Water
In the past, visitors often returned home from Mexico with stomach ill-
nesses (a condition known in Mexico as turista and colloquially in the
United States as “Montezuma’s revenge”), but this type of vacation sou-
venir is a rarity today. Massive investments in an improved infrastructure
and a general increase in standards of cleanliness and hygiene have prac-
tically wiped out the problem. However, you can easily play it safe and
drink bottled water. In addition, ice served in tourist establishments is
purified. For more on how to prevent turista, see Chapter 9.

Mexicans Who Don’t Speak English 
Are Hard of Hearing
At least it appears that many visitors buy into this statement. Some trav-
elers seem to believe that a native Spanish speaker will somehow get
over his or her inability to understand English if the English-speaking
individual talks even louder. Many Mexicans understand at least some
English, especially those in popular tourist areas.
Try this tip — and I guarantee it will work: Instead of panicking and
starting to yell in order to get your point across, ask nicely for help, and
an English-speaking local will come to assist you. (Better yet, try a few of
the handy Spanish phrases listed in Chapter 2 to start a conversation.)
Another thing to keep in mind: Should you voice any negative comments
about Mexico or Mexicans, don’t assume that no one around you can
understand your comments — you may find yourself in an embarrassing
situation.
Mexico Is the Land of Sombreros and Siestas
The common image of a Mexican napping under his sombrero exists in
some minds, but this stereotype is mostly made of myth. Today, Mexico
is a mix of contemporary business professionals and traditional agrarian
populations. The afternoon break — from 2 to 4 p.m. — is still a wonder-
ful tradition, but instead of being a time for siesta, it’s the time when
families come together for their main meal of the day. The more familiar
you become with Mexico, the more you find that the people are over-
whelmingly hard-working, hospitable, and honest.
All Mexican Food Is Spicy
Not all Mexican food is spicy although spicy sauces are likely to be in
the vicinity of the food you’re served. (See Chapter 17 for a list of some
of my favorite regional dishes.) Another common condiment you’re
likely to find are limones, the small, green citrus fruit with a taste similar
to a lemon. Squeezing a slice into a soup, or on fresh fish, is a common
practice — and provides a great complement to the chiles.
Mexico Has No Drinking or Drug Laws
When on vacation, many travelers tend to let loose — and some tend to
overindulge. Because of the welcoming and casual nature of Mexico,
many visitors believe that the sale of alcoholic beverages — or illegal
drugs — is unregulated. This belief is simply not true. The legal drinking
age in Mexico is 18, and technically, you’re not allowed to drink openly
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
262

in public. However, if you’re not acting intoxicated, you can generally
enjoy a beer or even a cocktail while you stroll around town.
As with most things in Mexico, it’s not so much what you do but how
you do it. Although you can drink on public beaches, you can’t be inebri-
ated in public, so once again, beware of how much you drink and how
well you can handle your alcohol intake. White-clad police patrolling
Mexico’s beaches are a common sight.
With regard to drugs, let me get straight to the point: They’re illegal, and
carrying even a small amount of marijuana or cocaine can earn you a very
unpleasant trip to jail. So keep your trip free of undesired encounters with
the law and don’t carry, buy, or use any kind of drugs. Remember that
Mexican law states that you’re guilty until proven innocent.
A Jeep Rental Is Really $10 a Day
One of the most common lures a timeshare salesperson uses is the “Rent
a Jeep for $10 per day” enticement. Sure, it’s true that the Jeep is only
$10, but only after you spend up to half a day listening to an often high-
pressured sales pitch. You decide — what’s your vacation time really
worth? And always remember: If it looks too good to be true . . .
If in Trouble, Pay a Mordida
The concept of paying off someone for a favor or to overlook a trans-
gression is as clichéd as the image of the sleeping Mexican under his
sombrero. Although the idea of paying a mordida (translated literally as
“little bite”) may have been rooted in truth for a long time, in Mexico’s
new political era, an active campaign is underway to keep dishonesty to
a minimum and to clean house of corrupt public servants. Many old-
school traffic cops will still take a bribe when offered; however, officers
belonging to the new generation of federal policemen are tested for hon-
esty, and the penalties for corrupt behavior are severe — as are the
penalties for those civilians inducing corruption by offering bribes to
police officers. My suggestion is don’t offer a “tip” or mordida to ease
your way out of trouble; the best course of action is to simply act
politely and see what the problem is.
You Can Go Everywhere Wearing 
Just Your Swimsuit
You may be in a seaside resort, but keep in mind that it’s also a home
and place of business for many Mexicans. Wearing swim trunks or a
pareo (sarong) skirt wrapped around your bikini while you’re on your
way to the beach is fine, but I recommend that you put on a shirt or a
Chapter 16: Ten (or So) Top Myths and Misconceptions 263

sundress when you plan to explore the town or when you take a tour
that involves riding around in a bus. You can still go casual, but
Mexicans frown upon tourists who can’t tell the difference between
beach and town — especially true when it comes to going into any
church wearing inappropriate clothing.
If you want to blend in, just take a few minutes to see what the locals
wear around town. Usually, walking shorts and T-shirts are fine every-
where. One more thing: Topless sunbathing is neither customary nor
legal in Mexico — so avoid problems with the law and keep your top on.
One exception is in Playa del Carmen, where topless tanning is common.
Mexico Is a Desert, and It’s Hot Everywhere
It’s not true that Mexico is arid year-round: The geography of Mexico
includes pine forests, and occasional snowfalls hit some of the country’s
higher elevations. Although the Yucatán beach resorts covered in this
book do enjoy sultry climates, bringing along a sweater or light jacket
for cool evenings is always wise, especially during winter months.

Ten Most Delicious
Yucatecan Dishes
In This Chapter
 Discovering the region’s most notable specialties and sauces
 Indulging in uniquely Mexican beverages
S
ome like it hot . . . and then there’s Mexican food! True Mexican cui-
sine is noted more for its unique way of combining flavors — sweet
and hot, chocolate and chiles — than for its fiery appeal.
This chapter explains some of the most flavorful and traditional Mexican
dishes popular in the Yucatán region that you’re likely to see on a menu
here. Go ahead and be adventurous! Let your taste buds have a vacation
from the foods you know and explore the authentic flavors of Mexico.
Pescado Tikik-Chik
You’re in a Mexican beach resort, so you’re almost certain to indulge in
the fresh fish and seafood. One of the most traditional and tasty ways to
prepare fish is to grill it after it’s marinated in a flavorful sauce. The
name of this preparation — and the spices in the sauce — varies by
region. Along the Yucatán coast, the Mexican-Caribbean variation of this
fish is called tikik-chik or tikin-chik and is prepared by marinating the fish
in a sauce of Worcestershire, lime juice, sour-orange juice, mild red-
pepper paste, and achiote — annatto seed paste. The fish is then sand-
wiched between two tikin palm fronds and cooked slowly over a wood
fire. Yum!
Pibil
Pibil is a thick, rich sauce used to prepare either pork or chicken. The
traditional cooking method calls for the meat to be first marinated in
this sauce made from achiote (annatto seed paste) plus a mixture of
bitter orange juice, onions, tomatoes, habanero peppers, and the herb

epazote. The meat is then wrapped in banana leaves and cooked in an
underground pit, called a pib.
Cochinita Pibil is shredded pork in pibil sauce, traditionally served in
tacos (corn tortillas). Typical garnishes include Xnipec (minced purple
onions and habanero peppers in sour orange juice) or pickled onions
(a milder version of Xnipec, prepared without habanero peppers).
Tamales
Tamales served in the Yucatán area are quite different from the ones typ-
ically found in the United States, which tend to be compact and greasy.
Here, these tasty bundles of corn dough are cooked in several different
ways, but all of them are wrapped in banana leaves, rather than the corn
husks that are used in the central and northern regions of Mexico. They
come with a variety of fillings, but usually include pork or chicken.
One popular variety is the Vaporcitos (translated as “little steamed
ones”), steamed tamales filled with either chicken or corn in a red
sauce made with annatto seed paste, tomatoes, oregano, onions, and
garlic. Other tamales are baked rather than steamed; these types are
called chachaquas. A popular variation is the Tamal Pibipollo, which is 
a huge chicken-filled tamale wrapped in banana leaves and cooked in 
an underground pit (pib). These tamales look charred due to their
method of cooking, but when you open the leaves (which you don’t
eat), you cut into a fluffy, cake-like tamale filled with juicy chicken. The
bean-filled version of this pit-baked tamale is called Tamal de Espelóns
(espelóns are tiny black beans). Colados are tamales where the dough is
cooked by simmering it in chicken broth and then wrapped in banana
leaves and steamed.
Panuchos
The Yucatán’s favorite snack, the panucho, is a must to try when you
visit these lands. Panuchos are pan-fried corn tortillas, which puff up
and are then slit and filled with refried beans and shredded pork or
chicken. The tortilla is then topped with lettuce and accompanied by
pickled onions.
Salbutes
One of the most traditional dishes in Yucatecan cuisine, salbutes are 
usually served as a snack or appetizer. A Maya version of an enchilada,
they’re made from a corn tortilla dipped in a pumpkin seed purée, which
is stuffed with hard-boiled eggs, topped with more purée, and served
warm with a mild tomato sauce.

266

Huevos Motuleños
Mexican food lovers and connoisseurs would frown if I said that huevos
motuleños are the Yucatán’s version of the traditional Mexican huevos
rancheros. Instead, I’ll say that, though they share the same basic princi-
ples of assembly, motuleños are in a class of their own. This layered dish
consists of refried beans spread on a plate topped by a pan-fried corn
tortilla, topped by a fried egg, followed by a lightly spiced tomato sauce,
another fried tortilla, and then more sauce. The whole creation is fin-
ished off with chopped ham, peas, and fried plantain slices.
Ceviche
Ceviche is one of Mexico’s more traditional ways to enjoy fish and
seafood. Ceviche is usually made of fish, but it may also be made from
other seafood, including shrimp, octopus, crab, and even conch (the last
is a Cancún specialty). The fresh fish — or seafood — is marinated in
lime and vinegar and mixed with chopped tomatoes, onions, and —
depending on the region — cucumbers and carrots. Note that the lime
and vinegar effectively “cook” the fish or seafood.
Puchero
The traditional Sunday dish in the Yucatán, puchero is a tasty three-meat
(chicken, pork, and beef) stew with mashed vegetables and cooked plan-
tains. People in the Yucatán say that Sundays aren’t complete unless they
have puchero.
Liquados
Not quite a meal, yet more than a beverage, liquados are blended drinks
of fresh fruit, ice, and either water or milk. Popular flavors include
mango, banana, pineapple, and watermelon. You can also make up your
own combination of tropical fruit flavors. They’re delicious, especially in
the sultry heat.
Café de Olla
The popularity and tradition of drinking coffee is nothing new to Mexico,
so to experience a taste of the past, try the traditional Mexican version
called café de olla. The espresso-strength coffee is prepared in an earth-
enware pot and spiced with cinnamon, cloves, and raw brown sugar. It’s
certain to wake you up!

Abbreviations
Common address abbreviations include
Apdo. (post office box), Av. or Ave. (avenida;
avenue), Blvd. (boulevard), c/ (calle; street),
Calz. (calzada; boulevard), Dept. (apart-
ments), and s/n (sin número or without a
number).
The “C” on faucets stands for caliente (hot),
and “F” stands for fría (cold). “PB” (planta
baja) means ground floor, and most buildings
count the next floor up as the first floor (1).
ATMs
Automated teller machines are widely avail-
able in the major resort towns, although you
find fewer in smaller destinations. They’re 
a great option to get cash at an excellent
exchange rate. To find the closest ATM, visit
these Web sites for the most popular net-
works: Plus (www.visa.com/pd/atm)
and Cirrus (www.mastercard.com/atm).
See Chapter 5 for further details.
Business Hours
In general, businesses in resort destinations
are open daily between 9 a.m. and 8 p.m.;
although many close between 2 and 4 p.m.
Smaller businesses also tend to close on
Sundays. The larger resort destinations have
extended business hours — many shops
stay open until 9 or 10 p.m. Bank hours are
Monday to Friday 8:30 or 9 a.m. to anywhere
between 3 and 7 p.m. Increasingly, banks are
offering Saturday hours in at least one
branch.
Credit Cards
Most stores, restaurants, and hotels accept
credit cards. However, smaller destinations
along the Riviera Maya, such as Tulum,
where telephone lines aren’t always avail-
able to process the authorization for the
charge, may not be so credit card friendly.
The same goes for smaller, family-run shops
and restaurants. You can withdraw cash
from your credit card at most ATMs, but
make sure that you know your PIN and
you’ve cleared the card for foreign with-
drawals with your bank. For credit card
emergencies, call the following numbers:
American Express % 001-880-221-7282,
MasterCard % 001-880-307-7309, and Visa
% 001-880-336-8472. These numbers con-
nect you to the U.S. toll-free numbers to
report lost or stolen credit cards; however,
the call is not toll-free from Mexico.

Appendix: Quick Concierge 269
Currency
The currency in Mexico is the Mexican
peso. Paper currency comes in denomina-
tions of 20, 50, 100, 200, and 500 pesos.
Coins come in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10,
20 pesos, and 50 centavos (100 centavos
equal 1 peso). The currency-exchange rate
is about 11 pesos to 1 U.S. dollar.
Customs
All travelers (including children) to Mexico
are required to present a valid passport. In
addition, you will need to have a Mexican
tourist card (FMT), which is free of charge
and can be attained through travel agencies
and airlines and at all boarder-crossing
points going into Mexico. For more informa-
tion, see Chapter 9.
Doctors/Dentists
Every embassy and consulate can recom-
mend local doctors and dentists with good
training and modern equipment; some of the
doctors and dentists even speak English.
See the list of embassies and consulates
under the “Embassies/Consulates,” section
later in this appendix. Hotels with a large
foreign clientele can often recommend
English-speaking doctors as well.
Drug Laws
To be blunt, don’t use or possess illegal
drugs in Mexico. Mexican officials have no
tolerance for drug users, and jail is their
solution. If you go to jail, you have very little
hope of getting out until the sentence (usu-
ally a long one) is completed or heavy fines
or bribes are paid. Remember, in Mexico,
the legal system assumes that you’re guilty
until proven innocent. (Note: It isn’t uncom-
mon to be befriended by a fellow user, only
to be turned in by that “friend,” who then
collects a bounty.) Bring prescription drugs
in their original containers. If possible, pack
a copy of the original prescription with the
generic name of the drug. U.S. Customs and
Border Protection (CBP) officials are also
on the lookout for diet drugs that are sold in
Mexico but are illegal in the United States.
Possession of these drugs may land you in a
U.S. jail. If you buy antibiotics over-the-
counter (which you can do in Mexico) —
say, for a sinus infection — and still have
some left, you probably won’t be hassled
by CBP.
Electricity
The electrical system in Mexico is 110 volts
AC (60 cycles), as it is in the United States
and Canada, but in reality, it may cycle more
slowly and overheat your appliances. To
compensate, select a medium or low speed
for hair dryers. Many older hotels still have
electrical outlets for flat, two-prong plugs;
you’ll need an adapter for any modern elec-
trical apparatus that has three prongs or an
enlarged end on one of the two prongs.
Many first-class and deluxe hotels have the
three-holed outlets (trifásicos in Spanish).
Hotels that don’t have these outlets may
have adapters to loan, but to be sure, carry
your own.
Embassies/Consulates
The embassy of the United States is in
Mexico City (Paseo de la Reforma 305; 
% 55-5209-9100). Its hours are Monday to
Friday 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. You can visit

Cancún and the Yucatán For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
270
the embassy’s Web site at www.us
embassy-mexico.gov for a list of street
addresses for the U.S. consulates inside
Mexico. U.S. consular agencies are in
Cancún (% 998-883-0272) and in Cozumel
(% 987-872-4574).
The Embassy of Canada is also in Mexico
City (Schiller 529, in Polanco; % 55-5724-
7900). It’s open Monday through Friday 
9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 to 5 p.m. (At other
times, the name of an officer on duty is
posted on the embassy door.) Visit the 
Web site at www.canada.org.mx for a
complete list of the addresses of the con-
sular agencies in Mexico. In Cancún, the
Canadian Consulate is at Plaza Caracol 3rd
floor (% 998-883-3360; e-mail: cancun@
canada.org.mx). It’s open Monday
through Friday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
The Embassy of the United Kingdom is at
Río Lerma 71, Col. Cuauhtemoc (% 55-
5207-2089 or 55-5242-8500) in Mexico City.
The embassy’s Web site, which you can
visit at www.embajadabritanica.
com.mx, has an updated list of honorary
consuls in Mexico. Honorary British con-
suls are in Acapulco (% 744-484-1735),
Cancún (% 998-881-0100), and Huatulco
(% 958-587-1742).
Emergencies
In case of emergency, always contact your
embassy or consulate. For police emergen-
cies, you must dial % 060, which will con-
nect you to the local police department.
Remember that in most cases, the person
answering the phone doesn’t speak English.
The 24-hour tourist help line from Mexico
City is % 800-903-9200 or 55-5250-0151. A
tourist legal assistance office (Procuraduría
del Turista) is located in Mexico City (% 55-
5625-8153 or 55-5625-8154). Although the
phones are frequently busy, they do offer
24-hour service, and an English-speaking
person is always available.
Health
No special immunizations are required. As
is often true when traveling anywhere in
the world, intestinal problems are the most
common afflictions experienced by travel-
ers. Drink only bottled water and stay away
from uncooked foods, especially fruits and
vegetables. Antibiotics and antidiarrheal
medications are readily available in all
drugstores.
Hot Lines
The Mexico Hotline (% 800-44-MEXICO) is
an excellent source for general information;
you can request brochures on the country
and get answers to the most commonly
asked questions. While in Mexico, contact
the 24-hour tourist help line, Infotur (% 800-
903-9200), for information regarding hotels,
restaurants, attractions, hospitals with
English-speaking staff, and so on.
Internet Access
In large cities and resort areas, most four-
and five-star hotels now offer business cen-
ters or cafes with Internet access as well as
in-room Wi-Fi service. You can also find
cybercafes in most other destinations —
even in remote spots, Internet access is
common now — it’s often their best way of
communicating with the outside world.
Language
The official language in Mexico is Spanish,
but you’ll find that a fair number of
Mexicans who live and work in resort
areas speak some English. Mexicans are
very patient when it comes to foreigners
trying to speak Spanish. See Chapter 2 for
commonly used terms in Spanish.

Legal Aid
Should you require legal assistance while in
Mexico, see “Embassies/Consulates” and
“Emergencies,” earlier in this appendix.
Liquor Laws
The legal drinking age in Mexico is 18;
however, it’s extremely rare that anyone is
asked for identification or denied pur-
chase. Grocery stores sell everything from
beer and wine to national and imported
liquors. You can buy liquor 24 hours a day,
but during major elections and a few offi-
cial holidays, dry laws often are enacted
as long as 24 hours beforehand. The laws
apply to foreign tourists as well as local
residents, even though it’s not uncommon
to find a few hotels and nightclubs that
manage to obtain special permits to sell
alcohol. Although Mexican authorities are
beginning to target drunk drivers more
aggressively, it’s still a good idea to drive
defensively.
Drinking in the street is not legal, but many
tourists do it. Use your better judgment and
try to avoid carrying on while sporting beer
bottles and cans — you’re not only expos-
ing yourself to the eyes of the authorities,
but most Mexicans consider public intoxi-
cation tacky behavior.
Mail
Postage for a postcard or letter is 59¢,
and the item may arrive at its destination
anywhere between one and six weeks
after you send it. A registered letter costs
$1.90. Sending a package can be quite
expensive — the Mexican postal service
charges $8 per kilo (2.20 pounds) — and
unreliable; it takes between two and six
weeks, if it arrives at all. Federal Express,
DHL, UPS, or other reputable, international-
mail services are the best options.
Pharmacies
Farmacias will sell you just about anything
you want, with or without a prescription.
Most pharmacies are open Monday to
Saturday 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Generally, one or
two 24-hour pharmacies are located in the
major resort areas. Pharmacies take turns
staying open during off hours, so if you’re
in a smaller town and you need to buy
medicine after normal hours, ask for the
farmacia de turno (pharmacist on duty).
Police
It’s quite common to find that the majority
of police forces in tourist areas are very
protective of international visitors. Several
cities, including Cancún, have gone so far
as to set up a special corps of English-
speaking tourist police to assist with direc-
tions, guidance, and more. In case of a
police emergency, dial % 060 to contact
the local police department, keeping in
mind that, unless you’re dealing with
tourist police, the force is unlikely to speak
English.
Restrooms
Public restrooms are usually more of an
adventure than a service — you can never
tell whether they’ll be clean or if toilet
paper will be available. Public restrooms
usually charge anywhere between 2 pesos
and 5 pesos (20¢–50¢), which gives you
access and a few squares of toilet paper.
Safety
Most resort areas in Mexico are very safe;
however, it’s better to be prepared than
sorry. A few points to keep in mind: Before
you leave home, prepare for the theft or
loss of your travel documents by making
two photocopies of them. Keep each copy
and the original documents in separate
Appendix: Quick Concierge 271

Cancún and the Yucatán For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
272
places. Lock your passport and valuables
in the hotel safety-deposit box. Keep credit
card company phone numbers and the
numbers of traveler’s checks somewhere
other than your purse or wallet. Don’t
dress or behave in a conspicuous manner.
When visiting crowded places, be aware
of your wallet or purse at all times. Leave
your best jewelry at home — who wants
jewelry tan lines anyway?
Taxes
Most of Mexico has a 15 percent value-
added tax (IVA) on goods and services,
and it’s supposed to be included in the
posted price. This tax is 10 percent in
Cancún and Cozumel, as they’re consid-
ered “port zones” and qualify for a reduc-
tion of duties. Mexico charges all visitors
an entry tax of US$15, which is usually
included in the price of your plane ticket.
Mexico also imposes an exit tax of around
US$18 dollars on every foreigner leaving
the country, which again, is usually
included in the price of airline tickets.
Telephone/Fax
To dial any number inside Mexico from the
United States, just dial 011-52 plus the ten-
digit number.
The country code for Mexico is 52. To call
home from Mexico, dial 00 plus the country
code you’re calling and then the area code
and phone number. To call the United
States and Canada, you need to dial 001
plus the area code and the number. The
country code for the United Kingdom is 44;
the country code for New Zealand is 64,
and the country code for Australia 61. You
can reach an AT&T operator at % 01-800-
288-2872, MCI at % 01-800-021-8000,
Sprint at % 001-800-877-8000, and British
Telecom (BT) at % 01-800-123-0244.
Mexican pay phones may sometimes
require a coin deposit.
To call operator assistance for calls inside
Mexico, dial 020; for operator assistance for
international calls, dial 090. Both numbers
provide assistance for person-to-person
and collect calls.
Time Zone
Mexico’s Yucatán peninsula falls within
central standard time. Also, Mexico cur-
rently observes daylight saving time.
Tipping
Most service employees in Mexico count
on tips for the majority of their income —
this is especially true for bellboys and
waiters. Bellboys should receive the equiv-
alent of US50¢ to US$1 per bag; waiters
generally receive 10 percent to 20 percent,
depending on the level of service. In
Mexico, it’s not customary to tip taxi driv-
ers, unless you hire them by the hour, or
they provide guide or other special serv-
ices. Don’t use U.S. coins to tip.
Water
Most hotels have decanters or bottles of
purified water in the rooms, and the better
hotels have purified water from regular taps
or special taps marked agua purificada.
Some hotels charge for in-room bottled
water. Virtually any hotel, restaurant, or bar
will bring you purified water if you specifi-
cally request it, but they usually charge you.
Bottled, purified water is sold widely at
drugstores and grocery stores. Some popu-
lar brands are Santa María, Ciel, and
Bonafont. Evian and other imported brands
are also widely available.

The Centers for Disease Control hot line (www.cdc.gov/travel) is an
excellent source for medical information for travelers to Mexico and
elsewhere. The main Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Web site
(www.cdc.gov/) provides detailed information on health issues for spe-
cific countries; otherwise, you can call the CDC directly at % 800-311-
3435 or 404-639-3534. For travelers to Mexico and Central America, the
number with recorded messages about specific health issues related to
this region is % 877-FYI-TRIP. The toll-free fax number for requesting
information is 888-232-3299.
Embassies and consulates provide valuable lists of doctors and lawyers,
as well as regulations concerning travel in Mexico (see “Embassies/
Consulates,” earlier in this appendix).
Mexico on the Web
Following is a list of several Web sites where you can find updated infor-
mation about Mexico’s most popular beach resorts. But keep in mind
that most of the companies that these Web sites recommend received
this lofty status by paying some sort of advertising fee.
 The Mexico Tourism Promotion Council developed another offi-
cial site (www.visitmexico.com) with more current information
on the different destinations in Mexico.
 For low-impact travel planning, visit the Eco Travels in Mexico 
section of the award-winning Web site www.planeta.com.
 The electronic version of Connect Magazine (www.mexconnect.
com) is the ideal site to begin a more in-depth, online exploration
about when and where to visit Mexico.
 Cancún South (www.cancunsouth.com) is a great site for inde-
pendent travelers looking to explore the Riviera Maya.
 Cozumel.net (www.cozumel.net) provides detailed information
about the island’s life.
