Dedication
This book is dedicated to everyone who has ever used a mobile phone and found 
it too limited, too confusing, and ultimately too frustrating. Welcome to the world 
of the iPhone, which acts as a mobile phone and handheld computer capable of 
playing games, browsing the Internet, playing music and video, retrieving and 
sending email, and much more, while being easy to use at the same time. You’ll 
find that your iPhone is one of the most sophisticated handheld computers on the 
market today. With a little guidance from this book, you’ll be able to master all the 
features crammed and buried in your iPhone. Get ready for a mobile phone expe-
rience that you’ll never receive from any other phone. The iPhone is in a class by 
itself, and you’re about to find out how to make it uniquely your own. 
Acknowledgments
This book owes its life to Bill Pollock, the publisher at No Starch Press, who pretty 
much lets me write anything I want, as long as he thinks there’s a market for it. 
Thanks also go to Kathleen Mish, Riley Hoffman, and Tyler Ortman for keeping this 
entire project together and making sure everything in the book made sense and 
really worked.
Additional thanks also go to Jack Dunning at ComputorEdge Online (http://
webserver.computoredge.com/online.mvc) for giving me a weekly Macintosh col-
umn, where I can write about Macintosh computers, iPhones, and anything else 
related to Apple and personal computers. Thanks also goes to Monish Bhatia for 
giving me a chance to write Macintosh hardware and software reviews for MacNN 
(http://www.macnn.com/), one of the best little websites for tracking the latest 
Apple news and rumors.
I’d also like to thank all the people I’ve met during my 18-year career as 
a stand-up comedian: Steve Schirripa (who appeared on HBO’s hit show The 
Sopranos) and Don Learned for giving me my first break performing in Las Vegas 
at the Riviera Hotel & Casino, Russ Rivas, Dobie “The Uranus King” Maxwell, 
Darrell Joyce, and Leo “The Man, the Myth, the Legend” Fontaine. 
I’d also like to thank my radio comedy co-hosts on CyberSports Today (http://
www.cybersportstoday.com/), which airs on ESPN Radio (800 AM) in San Diego: 
Dane Henderson and Alexia Lunaria. Dane and I are refugees from 103.7 FreeFM, 
where we ran a show focusing on the unusual and supernatural. This let us chat 
with folks who believed they were in contact with space aliens, as well as a tugboat 
museum captain and a group of paramilitary, die-hard nationalists. We may not 
have always known what we were doing, but every night was a complete blast until 
the station switched to an all-music format and kicked us off the air.
Finally, I’d like to acknowledge my wife, Cassandra, my son, Jordan, and my 
three cats, Bo, Scraps, and Nuit, for putting up with all my time spent sitting in 
front of the computer instead of doing anything else, like cleaning the house or 
putting books back where they belong.

When most people see an iPhone, their first 
reaction is awe with a little bit of covetousness 
thrown in for good measure. After most people 
buy an iPhone, their feelings of awe and envy 
soon change to a desire to show off and start 
using their new handheld computer. However, 
the iPhone offers so many cool features that 
you may feel overwhelmed, wondering how 
to get started and how to get the most out of 
your new tool. 
If you’re feeling overwhelmed by your new 
iPhone, this is the book you’ll need to gently 
guide you through the basics of using your new 
phone, browsing the Internet, and performing 
all kinds of personal and business tasks. This 
book will show you how to make the iPhone 
work best for you.
If you already know how to use a smart 
phone made by another company, you’ll 
Introduction

Introduction
discover that moving to the iPhone represents a new-generation technology that’s 
as dramatic as moving from an abacus to a personal computer. If you’re new to 
smart phones, you’ll find that the iPhone can be a friendly, forgiving, and fun tool 
that will make you wonder why anybody would ever want to use another mobile 
phone.
By the way, if you have an iPod touch, you basically have an iPhone without 
the telephone feature. Although you can’t make telephone calls with an iPod 
touch, it offers many of the same features as the iPhone. So whether you have an 
iPhone or iPod touch, you can learn something from this book. 
To avoid having to mention both the iPhone and iPod touch all the time, the 
rest of this book will use the phrase iPhone to represent both the iPhone and iPod 
touch. Just keep in mind that some tasks, such as making phone calls, sending text 
messages, and taking pictures, apply only to the iPhone.
How This Book Is Organized
To help you get started using your iPhone right away, this book is divided into 
short projects that act like recipes in a cookbook. Each project states a common 
goal, explains how your iPhone can help you reach that goal, and then lists all the 
steps you need to follow to accomplish it in a way that only an iPhone can. 
By learning how to perform fun and useful tasks via hands-on instructions, 
you’ll discover how to achieve specific results using your iPhone. You don’t have to 
go through this book in any particular order. Just bounce around, follow the proj-
ects that catch your interest, and ignore the projects that you don’t care about. 
Although your iPhone comes packed with plenty of features, don’t bother 
trying to learn them all if you don’t need to. Just learn the features that you need 
now so you can be productive right away. By following the projects in this book, 
your iPhone will become a useful and indispensable tool that you can rely on 
every day.
To help you expand the capabilities of your iPhone, this book includes short 
descriptions of some of the more popular apps you can download and install for 
free (you’ll learn how to find and install them in Project 11). These apps can help 
you do things like make free phone calls, edit pictures you’ve captured with your 
iPhone’s built-in camera, or tune in to Internet radio stations. The huge library of 
free apps available lets you expand your iPhone’s capabilities so it can help you 
accomplish what you need to do right now.

Part 1
Getting 
Started


1
Turning an iPhone on and off should be easy—
and it is. However, the iPhone can be in one of 
four states: on, off, sleep, or airplane mode. If 
all of this sounds more confusing than just turn-
ing your iPhone on and off, relax. There are 
actually valid reasons for putting your iPhone 
into different states. The trick is learning the 
advantages of each state and how best to put 
your iPhone into each state.
When your iPhone is on, you can use it to 
make calls, browse the Internet, listen to music, 
or perform a multitude of other tasks. 
After you’ve turned on your iPhone, you can 
switch it to sleep, off, or airplane mode. When 
your iPhone is in sleep mode, you’ll conserve its 
battery power while keeping it ready to receive 
calls. Most of the time, when you’re not actually 
using your iPhone, you’ll want to put it in sleep 
mode to conserve its battery power.
Turning 
Your iPhone 
On and Off

Project 1
Airplane mode turns off your iPhone’s ability to make calls, send text mes-
sages, access email, or surf the Web. This essentially cuts off your iPhone from the 
rest of the world while letting you do most other tasks, such as play music, check 
your calendar, use the calculator, or take pictures. As the name suggests, airplane 
mode is used when you’re in an airplane and can’t risk having your iPhone interfere 
with the airplane’s navigation systems. 
Turning your iPhone off stops you from receiving any calls or text messages 
altogether. You might turn off your iPhone to keep it from running down its battery, 
or to keep it from accessing your telephone company’s network and vibrating or 
ringing when you receive a call and possibly disturbing others around you (such as 
in a crowded movie theatre). 
Project goal: Learn how to turn on your iPhone, put it to sleep, put it in 
airplane mode, and shut it off completely. 
What You’ll Be Using
To turn an iPhone on and off, you need to use 
the following:
>
>
The Sleep/Wake button
The Settings application
Turning On Your iPhone
When your iPhone is off, you can turn it on by 
following these steps:
1.	
Press and hold down the Sleep/Wake 
button at the top of your iPhone, as 
shown in Figure 1-1, until the Apple logo 
appears on the screen. 
Q
Q Note: If you see a blank screen after press-
ing the Sleep/Wake button, your iPhone 
doesn’t have enough power to turn on.

Figure 1-1: The Sleep/
Wake button is located

of the iPhone.

2.	
Wait a few seconds until the Home 
screen appears, as shown in Fig-
ure 1-2. This tells you that your 
iPhone is now on.
Turning Off 
Your iPhone 
When your iPhone is on, you can turn it 
off by following these steps:
1.	
Hold down the Sleep/Wake button 
until a red arrow slider appears at 
the top of the screen. 
2.	
Drag the slider to the right (or tap 
Cancel if you don’t want to turn off 
your iPhone after all).
Putting Your iPhone 
to Sleep
After you’ve turned on your iPhone, you can change it from on to sleep mode to 
conserve battery power while still receiving phone calls or text messages. To put 
an iPhone that is already turned on to sleep, do this:
1.	
Press the Sleep/Wake button once. The screen darkens. 
Q
Q Note: At a glance, you cannot tell whether an iPhone is turned off or in sleep 
mode. If you press the Home or Sleep/Wake button and your iPhone turns on, 
then you’ll know it was asleep. If you press either button and nothing hap-
pens, then you’ll know that it’s turned off. 
Putting Your iPhone to Sleep Automatically
Since sleep mode is critical in conserving your iPhone’s battery, you may be happy 
to know that if you leave an iPhone on, it will put itself into sleep mode automati-
cally after a fixed period of time. To specify this period of time, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings screen appears, as shown 
in Figure 1-3.
2.	
Tap General. The General screen appears, as shown in Figure 1-4.
Figure 1-2: The Home screen 
contains icons for accessing 
various features.

3.	
Tap Auto-Lock. The Auto-Lock 
screen appears, as shown in 
Figure 1-5.
4.	
Tap one of the available options: 
1 Minute, 2 Minutes, 3 Minutes, 
4 Minutes, 5 Minutes, or Never.
5.	
Press the Home button to return to 
the Home screen.
Waking Up Your 
iPhone from Sleep
When you put your iPhone to sleep, you 
must wake it up to change its state from 
sleep to on. To wake up your iPhone 
in sleep mode, do this:
1.	
Press the Sleep/Wake button on 
top of the iPhone (or press the 
Home button). An arrow slider 
appears at the bottom of the 
screen.
2.	
Drag the slider to the right. The 
Home screen appears.

Figure 1-5: The Auto-Lock 
screen lets you define a 
fixed inactivity time before 
your iPhone goes to sleep 
automatically.

The slider forces you to slide your finger to unlock your iPhone. That way your 
iPhone won’t accidentally turn on if you press its Sleep/Wake button in your pocket 
or purse.
Q
Q Note: If you fail to use the slider to unlock your iPhone after a few seconds, 
your iPhone will automatically go back into sleep mode. 
Turning On Airplane 
Mode
On most airlines, you are not allowed to 
make phone calls or send or receive text 
messages; this prevents cellular phones 
from interfering with the plane’s naviga-
tional systems. To avoid this problem but 
still use your iPhone for other tasks, such 
as jotting down notes or using its calcula-
tor, you can place your iPhone in airplane 
mode by following these steps:
1.	
Make sure your iPhone is 
turned on. 
2.	
From the Home screen, tap 
Settings. The Settings screen 
appears (see Figure 1-3).
3.	
Tap the ON/OFF button next to 
Airplane Mode to turn this option 
on or off. An orange airplane icon 
will appear in the upper-left corner 
of the screen when this option is 
turned on, as shown in Figure 1-6.
Q
Q Note: When in airplane mode, a white airplane icon appears in the upper-left 
corner of the Home screen.
Additional Ideas for Turning Your iPhone 
On and Off
The four states of an iPhone are on, off, sleep, and airplane mode. When an iPhone 
is off, it can only be switched on. When an iPhone is on, it can be switched to off, 
sleep, or airplane mode.
In sleep mode, the iPhone can only be switched to on. In airplane mode, you 
can switch an iPhone to sleep or off.
Figure 1-6: An orange airplane 
icon appears when an iPhone is 
in airplane mode.

Project 1
As a general rule, turn off your iPhone whenever you don’t want to be both-
ered with incoming calls or text messages, such as at night when you’re sleeping or 
if you’re busy on a hot date. 
Airplane mode is most useful when you’re stuck in an airplane and don’t feel 
like interacting with any of your fellow passengers, preferring to let your iPhone 
amuse you instead. 
Sleep mode is generally used during the day when you need to accept 
incoming calls and text messages, but you want to conserve battery power. 
Now that you understand the basics of turning your iPhone on and off (and 
everything in between), the rest of this book will teach you how to use all the other 
features of your iPhone so you can do something useful. 
Turn Your iPhone into a 
Flashlight 
If you ever get caught in the 
dark, just turn your iPhone on—
the illumination from the screen 
can give you a little bit of light. 
In case you need a more sophis-
ticated flashlight, download the 
myLite Flashlight app, which 
turns your iPhone into a flash-
light and a whole lot more.
Besides letting you 
adjust the color and bright-
ness of your light, this app also 
lets you choose from several 
types of lights such as Strobe, 
Emergency, and Caution Flare. 
Now you can use your iPhone 
as an emergency signaling light 
to warn oncoming drivers of 
an accident ahead, attract the 
attention of the police if you 
need to signal for help, or flash 
an SOS signal so your rescuers 
can find you in case you’re lost somewhere in the wilder­ness. With this free 
app, your iPhone can literally save your life one day.

Nothing is more frustrating than wanting to use 
your iPhone and finding that it has run out of 
battery power. To help prevent this problem, 
this chapter explains how your iPhone’s battery 
works and how you can modify your iPhone 
settings to minimize power usage, thereby 
extending the daily life of your battery. 
Your iPhone runs on an internal, non­
removable lithium-ion battery, which you’ll 
need to recharge periodically, depending on 
how often you use your iPhone. Unlike other 
mobile phones, you cannot remove your 
iPhone’s battery and replace it with a spare, 
fully charged one.
Like all batteries, your iPhone’s battery will 
eventually wear out, but by then you’ll probably 
have a new iPhone model anyway (or you can 
take your iPhone to an Apple store and pay for 
a replacement battery). 
Charging and 
Conserving 
Battery Power

Project 2
Project goal: Learn how to maximize the charge of your battery to allow 
your iPhone to run as long as possible. 
What You’ll Be Using
To maximize your iPhone’s battery life, you need to use the following:
The iPhone USB cable
The Settings application
>
>
The iPhone USB power adapter
Recharging Your iPhone
Your iPhone comes with a USB cable and a power adapter that provide two ways 
to recharge your iPhone. First, you can plug the USB cable into the bottom of your 
iPhone and then plug the other end directly into the USB port of any computer. 
This not only recharges your iPhone, but it lets you transfer files from your com-
puter to your iPhone (and vice versa). 
Q
Q Note: Always plug the USB cable directly into your computer and not into the 
USB port of your keyboard. The keyboard’s USB port doesn’t provide enough 
power to recharge your iPhone.
A second way to recharge your iPhone is to plug the USB cable directly into 
the power adapter, which you can plug into a wall socket. This can be handy if you 
don’t have access to a computer with an open USB port.
To ensure a full battery, most people plug their iPhone into a computer or 
wall outlet overnight. That way, the iPhone will be fully charged the next morning. 
If you don’t use your iPhone every day, you should fully charge and discharge your 
iPhone’s battery at least once a month by following these steps:
1.	
Charge your iPhone by plugging it into the USB port of a computer or into 
the USB power adapter that’s plugged into an electrical outlet.
2.	
Unplug the iPhone from the USB cable.
3.	
Leave the iPhone turned on until its battery power completely drains away.
4.	
Recharge the iPhone.
Q
Q Warning: Hot weather (above 95°F or 35°C) can irreversibly harm your 
iPhone’s battery. Avoid storing your iPhone in direct sunlight. If your iPhone 
feels excessively warm while it’s recharging inside a carrying case, take it 
out of its case before recharging. Cold weather will only temporarily prevent 
your iPhone’s battery from holding a charge. Once you move your iPhone to a 
warmer area, its battery will hold its charge normally.

Turning Off Bluetooth
Bluetooth is primarily used to connect 
an iPhone wirelessly to a headset so you 
can listen to music or make phone calls 
without holding the iPhone. If you don’t 
use Bluetooth devices such as hands-free 
headsets, turning off Bluetooth can save 
power and increase your iPhone’s battery 
life. To turn off Bluetooth, follow these 
steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap 
Settings. The Settings screen 
appears.
2.	
Tap General. The General screen 
appears.
3.	
Tap Bluetooth. The Bluetooth 
screen appears, as shown in 
Figure 2-1.

Bluetooth to turn this option off.
5.	
Press the Home button to return to 
the Home screen.
Turning Off Wi-Fi and 3G
If you frequently surf the Internet to look up map directions, watch YouTube 
videos, or browse your favorite web pages, you’ll want to leave Wi-Fi turned on. If 
you turn Wi-Fi off and access the Internet, the iPhone uses your cellular telephone 
network, which requires more energy and drains your iPhone’s battery in the 
process.
To make Internet surfing fast over cellular telephone networks, the iPhone 
uses a technological standard known as 3G. You can turn off 3G to reduce your 
iPhone’s power consumption.
To turn off Wi-Fi and 3G, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings screen appears.
2.	
Tap General. The General screen appears.
3.	
Tap Network. The Network screen appears, as shown in Figure 2-2. 
4.	
Tap the ON/OFF button next to Enable 3G to turn this option off.

Press the Home button to return to the Home screen.
Q
Q Note: You can also put your iPhone into airplane mode (see Project 1) to save 
energy. 
Turning Off Push Accounts
Another handy feature of the iPhone is the push account. If you have a supported 
email account, your email server can deliver new messages to your iPhone auto-
matically and quickly, so you receive the information almost the instant someone 
sends it to you (see Project 32 on how to set this up). 
Since a push account requires that your iPhone periodically accesses 
your email account over the Internet, it uses energy. If you don’t need or care to 
receive email messages as quickly as possible, you can turn off the push account 
by following these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings screen appears.
2.	
Tap Mail, Contacts, Calendars. The Mail, Contacts, Calendars screen 
appears.
3.	
Tap Fetch New Data. The Fetch New Data screen appears, as shown in 
Figure 2-4.

Q Note: If you want to keep the push 
account turned on, tap an option 
under the Fetch category to define 
how often you want your iPhone to 
check for new messages. The longer 
the time interval, the less power your 
iPhone will consume.
Turning Off Location 
Services
Location Services is a fancy term that 
means some iPhone programs, such as 
the Maps program, rely on GPS (global 
positioning system) and triangulation 
of cellular phone towers to identify the 
physical location of your iPhone. If it 
knows your physical location in the world, 
an iPhone application can then help you 
find the nearest restaurant or gas station, 
for example.
Naturally, Location Services burns 
up battery energy, so if you don’t need 
this type of service, you can turn it off to 
reduce power consumption by following 
these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap 
Settings. The Settings screen 
appears.
2.	
Tap General. The General screen 
appears, as shown in Figure 2-5.

Additional Ideas for Conserving Power
Two ways to increase your iPhone’s battery life involve conservation and additional 
power sources. If you’re sure that you don’t need (or want) to receive phone calls 
or text messages, you can turn off your iPhone completely instead of putting it in 
sleep mode. Conserving power can help you get the most out of your battery, but 
another solution is to keep your iPhone charged at all times.
Many third-party companies sell power packs that plug into your iPhone. The 
moment your iPhone runs out of power, you can slap a power pack on it and con-
tinue using your iPhone. Of course, this means lugging around a spare power pack 
and remembering to keep it charged, but it can be handy in an emergency to help 
you avoid being stranded somewhere with a dead iPhone battery. 
Another solution is to buy special adapter cables that let you recharge your 
iPhone through the cigarette lighter in your car. You can even connect a solar 
panel to your iPhone to recharge it with sunlight. 
Carry your iPhone’s USB cable and you’ll be able to recharge it from any 
computer with a USB port. If you lug around a laptop computer, use the laptop as 
a spare power source to keep your iPhone charged. (Of course, remember that this 
will drain your laptop’s battery if it’s not plugged into the wall.)
Q
Q Warning: If you connect an iPhone to a computer through its USB cable, 
make sure the computer doesn’t go to sleep and don’t turn it off. If this hap-
pens, your iPhone can’t recharge its battery, and staying connected to a 
computer that’s asleep or turned off can actually drain the iPhone’s battery. 
Don’t forget that your iPhone is actually an iPod too, so you can recharge 
your iPhone by plugging it into any iPod-compatible device such as a stereo charg-
ing dock. 
If you combine conservation techniques with additional power sources, 
there’s no reason you should ever run out of power for your iPhone—unless, of 
course, you forget to charge your power packs or laptop, forget to bring along 
your cigarette lighter adapter cable, or forget to carry a solar panel charger 
with your iPhone.

Find Your Lost iPhone 
It’s easy to plug your iPhone into an electric outlet in a 
library or coffeehouse and then walk away without it. To 
make sure you don’t lose your iPhone, use the free app, 
If Found, Please…, which lets you customize your wall-
paper to include a phone number and email address.
Even if your iPhone is locked, anyone can turn it 
on and see the wallpaper message that appears. Then 
if you’re lucky, someone will contact you so you can get 
your iPhone back. 
If Found, Please…  http://www.polka.com/
If you subscribe to MobileMe, you can use the 
built-in Find My iPhone feature to locate a misplaced 
phone. (You must activate this feature through the 
MobileMe screen, in the Mail, Contacts, Calendars 
screen in the Settings app.) In the event that you lose 
your iPhone, just sign in to your MobileMe account with 
any web browser, click the Account icon, and enter your 
password again. In the list of information that appears, 
click Find My iPhone. A map will appear showing the 
general location of your iPhone. From here, you can 
choose to display a message on your iPhone’s screen, 
have it play a sound, or erase all the data on your 
iPhone. For more detailed instructions on how to do 
this, download the bonus chapter at http://www
.nostarch.com/newiphone.htm.
Use If Found, Please… to dis-
play contact information on your 
wallpaper.
Through MobileMe, you can display a custom 
message to appear on your lost iPhone.

The iPhone may be one of the easiest mobile 
phones to use. While other mobile phones 
waste space with cluttered and cryptic keypads 
that force you to press the same button mul­
tiple times just to type a single character, or 
display clumsy menus that more closely resem-
ble a computer operating system, the iPhone 
offers its unique Multi-Touch interface, which 
lets you control your entire iPhone with the tip 
of your finger.
The Multi-Touch screen forms the basis 
of the iPhone. By tapping or sliding your fin-
ger across the screen, you can select items or 
scroll across the screen. 
Of course, the iPhone offers ordinary but-
tons on the front, top, and side that you can 
press. These buttons typically control the basic 
functions of the iPhone (such as turning it on 
or off), while the Multi-Touch screen handles

the dedicated features such as letting you type messages on the screen or display 
web pages. 
Project goal: Learn how to control your iPhone using its physical buttons 
and Multi-Touch screen. 
What You’ll Be Using
To learn how to control your iPhone, you need to use the following:
>
>
The Ring/Silent switch
The Calculator application
>
>
The Volume Up and 
Volume Down buttons
The App Store application
The Maps application
Viewing the Home 
Screen
After the Sleep/Wake button at the top of the 
iPhone, the physical button you’ll use most 
often is the Home button, which appears at 
the bottom of the iPhone, on the front. No 
matter what program you may be using at the 
time, pressing the Home button immediately 
displays the Home screen, which displays icons 
that represent all the different programs you 
can run on your iPhone, as shown in Figure 3-1. 
(Try it now!)
Modifying the Home 
Button
Press the Home button once and you’ll always 
see the Home screen. Press the Home button 
twice and you can view one of five screens:
>
>
The Home screen
>
>
The Search screen
>
>
The Phone Favorites screen
>
>
The Camera screen
>
>
The iPod screen
The Home screen displays icons for all the programs available on your 
iPhone such as Maps and Safari. The Search screen lets you search for information 
stored on your iPhone, such as a name in the Contacts program or a song title.

The Phone Favorites screen displays the 
names of people you call most often. 
The Camera screen allows you to take 
photos with the iPhone’s built-in camera. 
The iPod screen lets you start listening to 
music stored on your iPhone. By default, 
pressing the Home button twice displays 
the Phone Favorites screen, but you can 
change this by following these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap 
Settings. The Settings screen 
appears.
2.	
Tap General. The General screen 
appears.
3.	
Scroll down and tap Home Button. 
The Home Button screen appears, 
as shown in Figure 3-2.
4.	
Tap Home, Search, Phone 
Favorites, Camera, or iPod. A 
checkmark appears next to the 
option you choose. From now on, 
pressing the Home button twice 
will display the screen you choose 
in this step. (Try it now!)
Turning the Ringer 
On and Off
Like most mobile phones, the iPhone can 
vibrate to alert you when you receive a 
phone call, or it can vibrate and play a 
ringtone. In most cases, you’ll want to let 
the iPhone vibrate and play a ringtone 
to make sure you don’t miss an incoming 
call. However, you may sometimes want 
to turn off the sound to avoid annoying 
others in a public area.
The Ring/Silent switch appears on 
the left side of the iPhone, as shown in 
Figure 3-3.
Unlike the other buttons on the 
iPhone that you press, the Ring/Silent 
button slides up and down toward the 
front and back of the iPhone. Sliding it 
Figure 3-2: The Home But-
ton screen lets you choose 
which screen appears when you 
press the Home button twice.

up (toward the screen) turns the ringer on. Sliding it down (toward the back of the 
iPhone) turns the ringer to vibrate mode only.
Adjusting the Volume
To make it easy for you to increase or decrease the volume, the iPhone includes 
Volume Up and Volume Down buttons on its left side, as shown in Figure 3-4.
You can adjust the volume by pressing and releasing a Volume button or by 
holding it down. When you adjust the volume, the iPhone displays a ringer icon 
with a horizontal bar underneath that visually displays the current volume level, 
as shown in Figure 3-5.
Using the Multi-Touch Screen
The Multi-Touch screen functions as both a display and a user interface that you 
can control with your fingertip. You can perform three main touch commands:
>
>
Select (tap)
>
>
Scroll (drag)
>
>
Zoom (pinch or double tap)
Q
Q Note: The Multi-Touch screen lets you rotate the iPhone vertically or horizon-
tally to make it easy to view data. No matter how you rotate your iPhone, the 
select, scroll, and zoom touch commands work the same.

Using the Select Command
The simplest command is select, which lets you tap an item that you want to select. 
To use the select command, point at an icon or button, press it lightly, and lift your 
finger off the screen again. When done correctly, the select command involves 
nothing more than tapping the screen. 
Q
Q Note: The Multi-Touch screen works 
only when it detects your fingertip 
touching the screen. If you tap the 
screen with your fingernail or while 
wearing gloves, the Multi-Touch screen 
won’t recognize this physical contact.
To see how the select command 
works, follow these steps to use the built-
in calculator: 
1.	
Hold the iPhone vertically.
2.	
From the Home screen, tap 
Calculator. The four-function Cal-
culator screen appears, as shown in 
Figure 3-6.
3.	
Rotate the iPhone horizontally. 
Notice that the Calculator screen 
now expands and changes orienta-
tion to display the Scientific Calcu-
lator screen shown in Figure 3-7.
4.	
Tap number keys to perform a calculation.

Q
Q Note: Not all programs change orientation when you rotate the iPhone 
vertically or horizontally. To find out whether your favorite program can auto-
matically change orientation, just rotate your iPhone while running a specific 
program and see what happens.
Using the Scroll Command
Since the iPhone’s tiny screen can’t always display everything at once, you may 
need to scroll to see more information. You can actually choose between three 
different scrolling commands: controlled scroll, quick scroll, and scroll to top of 
the page.
The controlled scroll lets you scroll horizontally or vertically by sliding or 
dragging your finger across the screen. To practice the controlled scroll, quick 
scroll, and scroll to top of the page commands, try the following to acquaint you 
with the App Store, where you can buy and download new programs for your 
iPhone:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap 
App Store. 
2.	
Tap Featured. The App Store 
screen appears, as shown in 
Figure 3-8.
3.	
Near the bottom of the screen, 
slide your finger up and down the 
screen. Notice that the screen 
scrolls up and down as your finger 
slides up and down the screen. As 
soon as you lift your finger off the 
screen, it stops scrolling. This is a 
controlled scroll.
4.	
Near the bottom (or top) of the 
screen, slide your finger up or 
down quickly, and lift your finger 
off the screen in a quick flicking 
motion. Even after you lift your 
finger off the screen, the screen 
should continue scrolling in the 
direction you flicked your finger. 
This is a quick scroll.
5.	
(Optional) Repeat the last step, except before the screen can stop scrolling, 
tap your finger on the screen. This immediately stops the scrolling and is 
known as a quick scroll stop. 
6.	
Scroll down and then tap the top bar that displays the time and battery life 
of your iPhone. The top of the page suddenly scrolls into view. This is a scroll 
to top of the page.
7.	
Press the Home button. The Home screen appears again.
Figure 3-8: The App Store 
screen

	
Controlling the User Interface

Sliding your finger across the screen lets you control the scrolling rate (the 
controlled scroll). Flicking your finger across the screen lets you scroll quickly (the 
quick scroll). Flick your finger and then tap your finger on the screen to stop a 
scrolling screen. Tap the top bar of any screen to display the top of the page.
Since the iPhone’s tiny screen can barely display one window of information, 
programs can’t display multiple, overlapping windows like an ordinary computer 
screen. Instead, some programs display multiple windows as individual, side-by-
side panes. One pane is always visible, but other panes are tucked out of sight to 
the left or right of the screen.
To let you know that a screen consists of multiple panes, two or more dots 
are displayed at the bottom of the screen—each dot represents a pane. A bright 
dot represents the current screen, while dimmed dots represent hidden screens. 
To view these additional screens, you need to slide the current screen left or right 
with your finger.
The Home screen actually consists of multiple panes (up to a maximum of 
nine). To practice scrolling horizontally to view other panes, follow these steps to 
get acquainted with the Home screen:
1.	
From the Home screen, slide your finger to the left across the screen. 
Another Home screen pane fills the screen, as shown in Figure 3-9.
2.	
Slide your finger to the right across the screen, and the original Home screen 
pane appears again.

Project 3
Using the Zoom Command
The iPhone’s tiny screen can actually display entire web pages. Of course, the 
images and text appear so small that they may be nearly impossible to read, so 
the iPhone gives you the option to zoom in and zoom out. To enlarge or shrink an 
image, you can use two fingers in a pinching motion. Touch the screen with your 
fingers spread out and bring them closer together to cause the iPhone image 
to shrink. If you start with your fingers close together and slide them apart, the 
iPhone image enlarges. 
A second way to zoom in and out is to tap the screen. To zoom in, tap one 
finger twice on the screen in rapid succession. To zoom out, tap two fingers on the 
screen once at the same time. 
Q
Q Note: Not all programs allow you to zoom in and out. 
To practice zooming in and out, try the following steps to get acquainted 
with the Maps program:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Maps. 
The Map screen appears, as shown 
in Figure 3-10. 
2.	
Zoom in using the pinching ges-
ture: Place two fingers close 
together and slide them apart 
while maintaining contact with the 
iPhone screen. Notice that the Map 
screen zooms in. 
3.	
Zoom out using the pinching ges-
ture: Place two fingers apart and 
slide them together while main-
taining contact with the iPhone 
screen. Notice that the Map screen 
zooms out. 
4.	
Zoom in by tapping one finger on 
the screen twice in rapid succes-
sion. Notice that the Map screen 
zooms in.
5.	
Zoom out by tapping two fin-
gers on the screen at the same 
time. Notice that the Map screen 
zooms out. 
6.	
Press the Home button. The Home 
screen appears again.

Additional Ideas for Controlling Your iPhone
By using both the physical buttons on the iPhone and the Multi-Touch screen, you 
can control all aspects of your iPhone. After the Sleep/Wake button, you’ll find that 
your most commonly used physical buttons are the Home button and the Volume 
Up and Volume Down buttons, so be sure you’re familiar with their locations. 
Also practice using the select, scroll, and zoom commands on the Multi-
Touch screen. By knowing these three commands, you’ll be able to control and get 
the most use out of your iPhone.

Primitive mobile phones include a fixed keypad 
used for typing both numbers and letters. This 
standard telephone numeric keypad may be 
optimal for typing numbers, but unfortunately, 
it can be clumsy for typing letters, punctuation 
marks, and symbols. To overcome the draw-
backs of trying to cram multiple characters 
onto a miniature keyboard, the iPhone offers a 
virtual keyboard. 
When you need to type something like a 
website address (such as http://www.nostarch
.com/), a text message, a note to yourself, a 
calendar appointment, a stock to watch, or any 
other item that requires typing in letters, num-
bers, and symbols, you’ll be using the iPhone 
virtual keyboard. In this chapter, you’ll get 
comfortable using this keyboard in different 
programs.
Project goal: Get familiar with how the vir-
tual keyboard works.

Project 4
What You’ll Be Using
To learn how to use the iPhone virtual keyboard, you need to use the following:
The YouTube application
The Safari application
The Settings application
Switching Between Keyboards
If you look at a typical computer keyboard, you’ll see that some keys represent 
letters, while others represent numbers and symbols. Since the iPhone screen is 
far smaller than a computer keyboard, the iPhone virtual keyboard can’t display all 
of these characters at once. Instead, the virtual keyboard displays characters on 
one keyboard, numbers and symbols on a second keyboard, and another group of 
symbols on a third keyboard:
>
>
The Character keyboard is for typing uppercase and lowercase letters.
>
>
The Numeric keyboard is for typing numbers, symbols, and punctuation 
marks.
>
>
The Symbol keyboard is for typing mathematical symbols such as + or =, 
seldom used symbols such as square brackets [ ] and curly brackets { }, and 
even currency symbols such as €.
To get to the Symbol keyboard 
from the Character keyboard, you’ll first 
need to go into the Numeric keyboard. 
To practice switching between these 
three keyboards, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap 
YouTube. The YouTube screen 
appears. (If you have previously 
searched for a YouTube video, 
you’ll see a list of your last dis-
played videos. Otherwise, the 
screen will be blank.) 
2.	
Tap the Search icon at the bottom 
of the screen. The YouTube search 
text box appears at the top of the 
screen.
3.	
Tap the YouTube search text box. 
The Character keyboard appears at 
the bottom of the screen, as shown 
in Figure 4-1.
4.	
Type any word or letters.

Now tap the .?123 button. The Numeric keyboard appears, as shown in 
Figure 4-2.
6.	
Type any symbol or number.
Q
Q NOTE: If all you need is a period (.) while you’re using the Character keyboard, 
try tapping the spacebar twice. You’ll stay on the Character keyboard and get 
a period with a space after it.
7.	
Tap #+=. The Symbol keyboard appears, as shown in Figure 4-3. 
8.	
From the Symbol keyboard, you can switch to the Character or Numeric key-
board. Tap ABC or 123. The Character or Numeric keyboard appears.
9.	
Press the Home button to return to the Home screen.
By switching between the Character, Numeric, and Symbol keyboards, you 
can type practically all the letters, numbers, and symbols available on a full-size 
computer keyboard. 
Q
Q NOTE: If all you need to do is type one digit or symbol from the Numeric key-
board (such as a comma or the number 3), try pressing and holding the .?123 
button, sliding your finger to the character you want, and then releasing. 
You’ll be back at the Character keyboard, and you’ve saved yourself some 
taps.

Using the Virtual Keyboard
Since the virtual keyboard is so tiny, you’ll probably need to type on it using your 
thumb or fingertip. Each time you tap a key, you’ll see the character you chose pop 
up on the screen. If you accidentally hit the wrong key, just slide your finger across 
the screen until your finger touches the character you really meant to type. Then 
lift your finger off the screen.
Beyond tapping keys to choose the characters you want to type, the virtual 
keyboard offers four additional features:
>
>
Moving the cursor
>
>
Deleting characters
>
>
Typing uppercase and lowercase letters
>
>
Accepting word suggestions
Moving the Cursor
On a computer, you can move the cursor by pointing and clicking the mouse or 
pressing the arrow keys on the keyboard. The iPhone’s keyboard doesn’t have 
room for arrow keys and there’s no mouse, so you have to point and move the cur-
sor using your finger.
To learn how to move the cursor, try this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap 
YouTube. The YouTube screen 
appears. 
2.	
Tap the Search icon at the bottom 
of the screen. The YouTube search 
text box appears at the top of the 
screen.
3.	
Tap the YouTube search text box. 
The Character keyboard appears at 
the bottom of the screen.
4.	
Type the name of your favorite 
band, such as Coldplay or Wilco.
5.	
Press and hold your finger on the 
text you just typed. A magnifying 
glass appears, enlarging your text 
and showing the exact position of 
the cursor, as shown in Figure 4-4.
6.	
Slide your finger left or right to 
move the cursor.
7.	
Remove your fingertip from the 
screen when the cursor appears 
in the position that you want. The 
magnifying glass disappears, allow-
ing you to type again.

Typing Uppercase Letters
Normally when you type on the Charac-
ter keyboard, all letters appear in lower-
case. To type an uppercase letter, you 
must first tap the Shift key, as shown in 
Figure 4-10. 
When the Shift key appears clear, 
typing creates a lowercase letter. When 
the Shift key appears to “glow,” the next 
character you type will be an uppercase 
letter. Immediately after typing an upper-
case letter, the Shift key switches back to 
typing lowercase letters until you tap the 
Shift key again. 
Typing Words Automatically
Since typing on the small virtual key-
board isn’t always easy, the iPhone 
offers an auto-correction feature. As you 
type, the iPhone displays a word that it 
thinks you’re trying to type, as shown in 
Figure 4-11.
Each time you see a word sugges-
tion pop up on the screen, you have two 
choices:
>
>
Tap the spacebar to make your 
iPhone finish typing the suggested 
word automatically.
>
>
Tap the displayed suggested word 
to make it go away.
The more you type on the virtual 
keyboard, the more the auto-correction 
feature adapts to the words you’re most 
likely to type. Eventually, you’ll find that 
the word suggestions offered will actu-
ally be the words that you’ll want to type, 
Shift key

so you can save time by typing part of a word, waiting for the suggested word to 
appear, and then tapping the spacebar.
To try out the auto-correction feature, do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap YouTube. The YouTube screen appears. 
2.	
Tap the Search icon at the bottom of the screen. The YouTube search text 
box appears at the top of the screen.
3.

bottom of the screen.
4.	
Type Id. A window suggests the word I'd.
5.	
Tap the spacebar to watch the word I'd magically appear in place of the word 
you typed.
Customizing the Virtual Keyboard
To make typing even easier and faster, the virtual keyboard offers four additional 
shortcuts that you can customize:
>
>
Auto-Correction  This feature turns auto-correction on or off. When turned 
on, auto-correction will suggest a word such as I'd whenever you type a simi-
lar phrase such as id. When auto-correction is turned off, you won’t see any 
word suggestions pop up as you type.
>
>
Auto-Capitalization  This feature automatically turns on the Shift key when 
starting a new sentence.
>
>
Enable Caps Lock  This feature 
allows you to lock the Shift key by 
tapping it twice so you can type in 
uppercase without constantly hav-
ing to tap the Shift key.
>
>
“.” Shortcut  This feature allows 
you to tap the spacebar twice 
to insert a period and a space 
automatically.
To turn these features on or off, do 
the following:

From the Home screen, tap 
Settings. The Settings screen 
appears. 
2.	
Tap General. The General screen 
appears.

Using Safari’s 
Keyboard
The virtual keyboard appears whenever 
you need to type text in any program, 
such as typing names and addresses 
in the Contacts program or names of 
videos you want to watch in the YouTube 
screen.
When typing a website address in 
Safari, the virtual keyboard appears in 
a slightly different way to help you type 
website addresses more easily. The most 
prominent difference is the .com key, 
which lets you type the common .com 
extension at the touch of a single button 
rather than typing the period and the let-
ters com in four separate key taps.
The Safari keyboard consists of 
a Character keyboard and a Numeric 
keyboard. To switch to the Numeric key-
board, tap the @123 key that appears 
in the lower-left corner of the Character 
keyboard, as shown in Figure 4-15.
Figure 4-14: A dialog gives you 
one last chance to change your 
mind before resetting your key-
board dictionary.

Project 4
To switch to the Character keyboard from the Numeric keyboard, tap 
the ABC button in the lower-left corner of the Numeric keyboard, as shown in 
Figure 4-16.
When you tap the .com key, you’ll insert the entire .com portion of a website 
address. However, many website addresses use different endings such as .net, 
.edu, or .org. Rather than typing these letter-by-letter, you can also type them 
automatically using the .com key. Just hold down the .com key until a list of alterna-
tives pops up, as shown in Figure 4-17. Then tap the option you want to use, such 
as .net or .edu.
Rotating the Keyboard 
Many people find typing on the virtual keyboard difficult. To fix this problem, you 
can rotate your iPhone sideways and display the virtual keyboard horizontally. To 
rotate the virtual keyboard while using Safari, do this: 
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Safari. The Safari screen appears.
2.	
Rotate your iPhone horizontally. The Safari screen now appears horizontally.

Tap in the address text box. The virtual keyboard appears horizontally on 
the screen, as shown in Figure 4-18. Notice how the horizontal virtual key-
board displays its keys in a larger size, making it convenient to type with your 
thumbs. 
Q
Q Note: The virtual keyboard can appear horizontally in other apps such as 
Notes, Messages, or Mail. However, it may not appear horizontally in all apps, 
so if you rotate your iPhone and nothing happens, you may not be able to use 
the virtual keyboard in a horizontal position within that particular app. 
Additional Ideas for Typing on Your iPhone
Typing on your iPhone can take some getting used to, especially since the keys on 
the virtual keyboard are so tiny that your fingers may accidentally press the wrong 
ones. The only solution to this problem is to practice typing on the virtual key-
board as often as possible so you get used to the quirks and size of these keys.
Get familiar with the virtual keyboard now, since you’ll always need it for a 
variety of programs. If you need to type text, you’ll have to use the virtual key-
board, so spending a little time learning it now will save you time later when you 
need to type text and can’t figure out how the virtual keyboard works.

the virtual keyboard horizontally.

Use Your iPhone to 
Check Your Spelling
Since the iPhone’s virtual key-
board is so tiny, you may find 
typing to be clumsy. To protect 
yourself from spelling mistakes, 
download the free Speller app, 
which checks your spelling as 
you type. Unlike the iPhone’s 
built-in feature that tries to 
guess which word you’re typing, 
Speller displays an entire list of 
possible spelling variations. 
Instead of trying to tap 
every word out, just type a few 
characters, wait for Speller to list 
the most likely words, and then 
tap the word that you want. Now 
you’ll be able to type faster and 
more accurately using less tap-
ping so you don’t wear out your 
fingers and thumbs.

Use Speller to check the spell-
ing of your words automatically.

After you’ve stored something on your iPhone 
(such as contact information for your friends, 
songs, podcasts, and third-party apps down-
loaded from the App Store), you’ll probably 
want to find it again. 
The best way to do this is to use the Search 
feature, which lets you type the name (or part 
of the name) of an item that you want to find. 
Type Al, and you’ll suddenly see a list of all 
names and song titles that begin with Al, such 
as the name Albert or the song title All Out of 
Love. The Search feature lets you look for words 
or phrases stored in Mail (to find messages or 
names), Calendar (to find appointments), Notes 
(to find ideas), and iPod (to find song titles). By 
using the Search feature, you’ll be able to find 
your data whenever you need it.

What You’ll Be Using
To search on your iPhone, you need to use the following:
The Search screen
Using the Search Feature 
The Search screen displays the virtual keyboard so you can type the name (or part 
of the name) of an item you want to find. As you type, your iPhone displays a list of 
items that match what you’ve typed so far. The Search screen is located to the left 
of the first Home screen pane. 
To use the Search screen, do this:
1.	
Place your finger on the Home screen and slide it to the right to access the 
left pane. The Search screen and the virtual keyboard appear, as shown in 
Figure 5-1.
2.	
(Optional) If text already appears in the search text box, tap the clear button 
(the white X in a gray circle to the far right of the search text box).
3.	
Type the letter A. If you’ve stored anything on your iPhone, you’ll see a list of 
items that match your search criteria, as shown in Figure 5-2. To help identify 
where a particular item is stored on your iPhone, you’ll see an icon in the left 
column, such as the iPod, Contacts, or App Store icon.
Q
Q Note: The exact items that appear on your screen will depend on the items 
(such as names, apps, and songs) you’ve stored on your iPhone. If you haven’t 
stored anything on your iPhone yet, the Search feature will only find the apps 
that come with your iPhone.
4.	
Tap the item you want to view, such as a person’s name or a song title. Your 
iPhone loads the app where your selected item is stored. For example, if you 
select a song title, the iPod application will open and play the song.

Additional Ideas for Searching Your iPhone
The most obvious way to use the Search feature is to search for a person’s name 
stored in the Contacts app. Another way is to use the Search feature to find a spe-
cific song or a list of songs from your favorite recording artist. 
Just type part of a song name, and your iPhone will display all matching 
song titles right away. Type part of a recording artist’s name, and you can see all 
songs by that artist stored on your iPhone. Tap the song you want to hear, and your 
iPhone starts playing it immediately. By using the Search feature to help you sort 
through your music library, you can hear the exact song you want without scroll-
ing through every song stored on your iPhone. 
If you’ve loaded a bunch of apps on your iPhone, you may have screens full 
of app icons. You could try searching through these multiple screens (you can have 
up to 11), but a faster way is to use the Search feature and type part of the app 
name that you want. When the Search feature finds your app, just tap the icon to 
start it up. 
The Search feature can be great for finding all the goodies you have stored 
on your iPhone. The more stuff you store on your iPhone, the more useful the 
Search feature will be. Now all you have to remember is where to find the Search 
feature (to the left of the Home screen).

The Home screen displays icons for all the 
applications and features available on your 
iPhone. To view the Home screen, press the 
Home button on the front of the iPhone. 
Since you’ll often be starting at the Home 
screen when using your iPhone, you may want 
to customize its appearance by rearranging 
icons on the screen, moving them off of (or on 
to) the main home screen pane, or deleting cer-
tain programs altogether. 
Project goal: Learn how to customize the 
Home screen of your iPhone. 
Rearranging 
Icons on the

Project 6
What You’ll Be Using
To customize your iPhone’s Home screen, you need to use the following:
The Settings application
Rearranging Icons
The Home screen displays icons that represent the features and apps on your 
iPhone, such as Calendar or iTunes. If you find yourself using some features or 
apps more often than others (or ignoring some features altogether), you may want 
to rearrange the icons on the Home screen so that they appear in the order you 
prefer.
For example, suppose you use the Calendar and iTunes programs every day, 
but you rarely use the Camera or Text messaging programs. To make it easy to 
access the Calendar and iTunes programs, you could put these icons in the corners 
of the screen (to make it easy to tap them with your thumbs) and place seldom-
used program icons in the middle of the screen. 
To rearrange icons on the Home 
screen, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, point to 
the icon that you want to move and 
hold your finger on that icon until 
all icons on the Home screen start 
jiggling. 
2.	
Slide your finger to a spot where 
you want to move the icon. A 
“ghost” image of the icon will 
appear to show you where the icon 
will land, as shown in Figure 6-1. 
When you move an icon in between 
two others, those two icons glide 
out of the way.
Q
Q Note: The bottom of the Home screen 
can display your four most commonly 
used application icons, such as Phone 
or iPod. You can move any icon off this 
bottom bar and move another icon in 
its place. You can store a maximum of 
four icons on the bottom bar.
Figure 6-1: An icon appears as a 
“ghost” image when you move 
it across the Home screen.

3.	
Lift your finger off the screen when 
you’re happy with the new location 
of the icon. Then move any other 
icons you’d like to rearrange.
Q
Q Note: At this time, you can tap the 
close button (the white X) in the 
upper-left corner of any application 
icon you installed on your iPhone, as 
shown in Figure 6-2. Tapping the close 
button deletes the app entirely from 
your iPhone. (You cannot delete the 
standard iPhone apps such as Phone or 
Safari.)
4.	
Press the Home button to stop all 
the Home screen icons from jig-
gling and end your rearranging 
session.
Q
Q Note: Remember that the Home 
screen actually consists of at least two 
panes. To move an icon off one pane 
and onto another, hold your finger 
on the icon and slide it to the left or 
right until the other pane appears. You 
can have up to 11 separate panes full 
of icons.
Resetting Your Home Screen
You can rearrange the icons on the Home screen to customize your iPhone, but if 
you get carried away and wind up making a mess out of your icons, don’t worry. At 
any time, you can return the Home screen to its original factory settings. To reset 
the appearance of the Home screen, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings screen appears. 
2.	
Tap General. The General screen appears.
3.	
Scroll down the General screen until you see the Reset button.

Q Note: Resetting the Home screen 
rearranges icons but does not delete 
any icons, such as those programs 
you’ve installed since getting your 
iPhone. They may appear on another 
Home screen pane, however. 
7.	
Press the Home button. The Home 
screen appears. Notice that your 
Home screen has now returned to 
its original appearance.
Additional Ideas for Customizing Your 
Home Screen
Since you can have up to 11 panes for your Home screen, try moving all your 
seldom-used program icons to another pane and keeping all your favorite pro-
grams on the first pane. That way, each time you open the Home screen, you’ll see 
only your favorite program icons. When you need to use a seldom-used program, 
slide your finger over the screen from right to left to reveal the other Home screen 
panes with additional application icons.
As a rule, try to keep your Home screen as uncluttered as possible. One day 
when you’re in a hurry and see a clean, uncluttered Home screen instead of a clut-
tered one with icons for programs you haven’t used in months, you’ll be thankful 
you followed this advice.

If you have a Wi-Fi network 
and iTunes on your computer 
or Apple TV, you can turn your 
iPhone into a remote control 
so you can choose the music or 
movies to play without having 
to get up out of your chair. Now 
you can forget about all those 
cheap remote control devices 
that you’ll probably lose within 
a few days anyway, and put all 
that functionality on your iPhone 
(which you’ll probably keep 
better track of than a regular 
remote).

Every new iPhone is nearly identical in appear-
ance, so you may want to take some time to 
modify your iPhone and make it uniquely your 
own. The two most common ways to custom-
ize your iPhone involve changing sounds and 
pictures. You can use customized sounds 
so that your iPhone plays different noises to 
alert you of incoming calls or text messages. 
Customizing pictures simply makes your iPhone 
look just the way you like it.
In addition to modifying the way your 
iPhone plays audio or displays pictures, you 
can also change the regional settings of your 
iPhone to view dates and times in a format 
common in your part of the world.

Project 7
What You’ll Be Using
To learn how to customize your iPhone, you need to use the following:
The Settings application
Turning Vibrate Mode On and Off
When you receive a phone call, your iPhone can vibrate and/or play a sound called 
a ringtone. You can silence the ringtone by using the Ring/Silent switch (see Proj-
ect 3). You can also turn off both vibrate and ring mode in case you don’t want a 
vibrating or ringing iPhone disturbing you, such as when you’re trying to sneak out 
of the house without your parents/spouse/boyfriend/girlfriend hearing you.
To turn vibrate mode on or off, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap 
Settings. The Settings screen 
appears.
2.	
Tap Sounds. The Sounds screen 
appears, as shown in Figure 7-1.
3.	
(Optional) Tap the ON/OFF button 
next to Vibrate under the Silent cat-
egory. This turns the vibrate mode 
on or off when the ringer is off. If 
you turn vibrate mode off in this 
category, your iPhone won’t vibrate 
or play a sound when you receive a 
phone call. This can be useful if you 
want to keep your iPhone from dis-
turbing you while you’re watching a 
movie at a theatre, for example.
4.	
(Optional) Tap the ON/OFF but-
ton next to Vibrate under the Ring 
category. This turns the vibrate 
mode on or off when the ringer is 
on. If you turn vibrate mode off in 
this category, your iPhone won’t 
vibrate but will play a sound when 
you receive a phone call. 
5.	
Press the Home button to return to 
the Home screen.
Figure 7-1: The Sounds screen 
lets you choose sounds for your 
iPhone.

	
Customizing Your iPhone 	 |

Changing Sounds
To alert you of incoming calls or text messages or to provide audio feedback when 
you type on the screen, your iPhone can play various sounds. You can get as quirky 
as you want with sounds, although you should choose sounds that you won’t mind 
hearing periodically, or else you’ll risk driving yourself crazy.
The two most common uses for sound are for ringtones and text messages. 
A ringtone plays when you receive a phone call, and a text message sound plays 
when you receive a text message. 
Changing Ringtones
Most people like customizing their ring-
tone to play something unique or differ-
ent when they receive a call. To choose a 
ringtone, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap 
Settings. The Settings screen 
appears.
2.	
Tap Sounds. The Sounds screen 
appears (see Figure 7-1).
3.	
Tap Ringtone. The Ringtone 
screen appears, as shown in 
Figure 7-2.
4.	
Tap a ringtone sound to select and 
hear it. (You may need to scroll 
down the list of ringtones to see 
them all.)
5.	
Press the Home button to return to 
the Home screen.
Q
Q Note: See Project 18 to see how to 
create a ringtone from your favorite 
song.
Changing Text Message Sounds
Every time you receive a text message, your iPhone can play a sound to alert you. 
To choose a sound to play for incoming text messages, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings screen appears.
2.	
Tap Sounds. The Sounds screen appears (see Figure 7-1).

4.	
Tap a sound (such as Bell or Chime) 
to hear and select it.
5.	
Press the Home button to return to 
the Home screen.
Turning Audio Feedback 
On and Off
Since most controls on an iPhone involve 
touching its screen, you don’t receive any 
tactile feedback like you would when you 
press a button on a regular keyboard or 
a mouse. To compensate for this, your 
iPhone can play audio to let you know 
when you’ve done something, such as 
tapping a letter on the keyboard or send-
ing an email message. You can modify 
audio feedback for the following iPhone 
features on the Sounds screen:
>
>
New Voicemail  Your iPhone can 
play a sound when you receive new 
voicemail.
>
>
New Mail  Your iPhone can play a sound when you receive a new email 
message.
>
>
Sent Mail  Your iPhone can play a sound when you send an email message.
>
>
Calendar Alerts  Your iPhone can play a sound to alert you of a calendar 
event.
>
>
Lock Sounds  Your iPhone can play a sound when you wake it from sleep 
mode.
>
>
Keyboard Clicks  Your iPhone can play a sound when you type a character 
on the keyboard.
To turn these audio feedback options on or off, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings screen appears.
2.	
Tap Sounds. The Sounds screen appears (see Figure 7-1).
3.	
Tap the ON/OFF button next to an option such as Keyboard Clicks or Sent 
Mail.

Changing the Screen Brightness
The iPhone’s screen is useless if you can’t see it, so you can adjust its brightness to 
make it brighter or dimmer. (Just remember that the brighter the screen, the more 
power it consumes, reducing the battery life of your iPhone.)

Customizing the Regional Settings
Different parts of the world have accepted ways to display times, dates, and tele-
phone numbers. To make your iPhone display this information correctly for your 
part of the world, your iPhone lets you choose your current location. Based on the 
region you choose, your iPhone then automatically displays information common 
to that particular region. (To learn how to change the language your iPhone uses 
and how to type in that language, see Project 9.)
To change the regional settings for your iPhone, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings screen appears.
2.	
Tap General. The General screen appears.
3.	
Scroll down and tap International. The International screen appears, as

Additional Ideas for Customizing Your 
iPhone 
Customizing your iPhone can be a fun way to express yourself—you can use a pic-
ture of your significant other as wallpaper or play unique sounds as ringtones. 
You may also want to customize your iPhone if you move to another part 
of the world and take your iPhone with you. By modifying the way your iPhone 
displays dates, times, and telephone numbers, you can blend right into your new 
culture and act like a native. 
As an alternative, you can leave your iPhone settings the way they work in 
another country and spend your time feeling like a rebel in your land. As long as 
you’re happy with the way your iPhone displays information, you’ll be more pro-
ductive, so don’t worry about what anyone else may think.
Keep Track of Your 
Expenses with Your 
iPhone
If you need to keep track of your 
daily expenses, grab iXpenseIt, 
which has both a free and a paid 
version. The free version only lets 
you store up to 50 items, while 
the paid version lets you store an 
unlimited number of items. Using 
this app, you can keep track of all 
those minor, daily expenses that 
often slip your mind such as tips, 
books and magazines, or a cup 
of coffee. 
The more you can track 
your expenses, the better you’ll 
be able to see where your money 
is going. That way you’ll be able 
to budget your money. (Now if 
the government would only get 
this app on its iPhone, maybe it 
could find a way to balance the  
budget.)

The iPhone is nothing more than a fancy, 
power­ful computer that happens to fit in your 
hand. Like most computers, the iPhone comes 
with built-in software known as firmware. The 
firmware controls the basic functions that make 
the iPhone actually work. 
The problem with computers is that all soft-
ware contains problems (known as bugs). To 
fix any bugs in the iPhone’s firmware, or to add 
new features to the iPhone, Apple periodically 
issues firmware updates. By ensuring that your 
iPhone runs the latest firmware, you can keep 
your iPhone working and using the latest fea-
tures possible.
Project goal: Learn how to update the firm-
ware on your iPhone. 
Updating 
Your iPhone

62	
|	
Project 8
What You’ll Be Using
To update the firmware on your iPhone, you need to use the following:
iTunes (on your Mac or PC)
The iPhone USB cable
Downloading iTunes
The only way you can update your iPhone’s firmware is to connect your iPhone 
to a computer and use the iTunes program. Every Macintosh comes with iTunes 
installed, but Windows PCs do not. If you use a PC running Windows XP, Vista, or 
Windows 7, you must download iTunes from Apple’s website at http://www.apple
.com/itunes/download/. 
After you’ve installed iTunes on your Windows PC, you’ll be ready to con-
nect your iPhone and start working. (Mac users should periodically click the Apple 
menu and choose Software Update to download the latest version of iTunes.)
Getting Updates
To update the firmware on your iPhone, you need to use iTunes. The first time you 
follow these steps, iTunes may ask you to register your iPhone. After following this 
registration process, you won’t see the registration screen again.
To update your iPhone firmware, follow these steps:
1.	
Open iTunes on your computer.
2.	
Make sure your computer is connected to the Internet.
3.	
Plug your iPhone into your computer using the USB cable that came with 
your phone. The iTunes window displays your iPhone under the DEVICES 
category in the left pane, as shown in Figure 8-1.
Q
Q Note: Depending on what's installed on your computer, programs such as 
iPhoto, Image Capture, and Adobe Photoshop Elements may try to access 
pictures, video, or music stored on your iPhone. You may need to exit these 
program windows after plugging your iPhone into a computer.
4.	
Click Check for Updates. If updates to your iPhone’s firmware are available, 
iTunes will automatically download and install them on your iPhone.
Q
Q Warning: Don’t unplug your iPhone while the update process is occurring, or 
you could temporarily wreck your iPhone. To fix this problem, you’ll have to 
restore it and start the firmware update all over again.

	
Updating Your iPhone

5.	
When you see a message at the top of the iTunes window stating that it’s 
safe to disconnect the iPhone, you can click the eject button that appears to 
the right of your iPhone’s name in the left panel. This tells your computer to 
stop accessing your iPhone.
6.	
Unplug your iPhone from your computer. 
Additional Ideas for Updating Your iPhone
As a rule, you should keep your iPhone updated with the latest firmware. This not 
only makes your iPhone more stable and reliable, but it can also add new features 
that make your iPhone easier or faster to use.
Just be aware that you may not always want to update your iPhone the sec-
ond Apple announces a new firmware update. Sometimes, firmware updates can 
actually cause more trouble than good, so when iTunes tells you there’s a new 
firmware update, take a moment to browse the Internet and look for reports of 
problems with the latest update. If you don’t see anything about problems and the 
firmware has been available for a few days, then it’s probably safe to download the 
latest firmware and update your iPhone. 
The iPhone is remarkably stable, but like any computer, you never know 
when it might crash or act erratically at the worst possible moment. By updating 
your iPhone periodically, you can make sure that your iPhone will work reliably 
when you need it.

Read an Electronic Book on Your iPhone
The next time you’re bored, you could call someone, send a text message, 
listen to music, or just watch a TV show or movie that you’ve downloaded. For 
another way to keep yourself amused with your iPhone, grab an ebook reading 
program like Stanza or Kindle. 
Both programs let you access a variety of free books including classic 
literature. If you want the latest best-sellers, you can pay to get the electronic 
versions and read them on your iPhone. With either Stanza or Kindle, you 
can turn your iPhone into an endless library that’s only limited by the storage 
space available for saving your electronic books.
Stanza  http://www.lexcycle.com/
Kindle  http://www.amazon.com/
An electronic book reader like Stanza can give 
you access to the latest best-sellers.

By default, every iPhone uses a language based 
on where you bought it. So, for example, if 
you bought your iPhone in the United States, 
the default language is English; if you bought 
your iPhone in France, the default language is 
French.
If you move to another country, or you just 
like practicing your language skills by using 
another language, you can make all icons and 
menus appear in the language of your choice. 
To complete the language experience, you can 
also change the keyboard settings to another 
language. That way, as you type, your iPhone 
will suggest words in that particular language.
Project goal: Learn to change the default 
language used for typing and displaying icons 
and buttons.

Using International 
Keyboards
After you’ve set your iPhone to display a 
particular language, your next step is to 
get the iPhone to recognize any text that 
appears in that language. To do this, you 
must configure the keyboard to display 
characters in that language. You can type 
in French, English, Finnish, or any other 
supported language.
Using these international key-
boards takes two steps. First, you need 
to turn on the particular language key-
board. Second, you need to switch to 
that language keyboard when you want 
to type in that particular language.
Defining a Foreign Language 
Keyboard
You can turn on as many foreign lan-
guage keyboards as you want, but the 
iPhone can display only one keyboard at 
a time. By default, the iPhone has only 
one keyboard turned on (the native lan-
guage of your country), but if you want to 
add more, do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap 
Settings. The Settings screen 
appears.
2.	
Tap General. The General screen 
appears. Scroll down the General 
screen until you see the Keyboard 
button.

Switching to a Foreign Language Keyboard
After you’ve chosen two or more foreign language keyboards, you can use 
the International key on the keyboard to switch between your chosen languages. 
The International key appears as a wire-frame globe to the left of the spacebar. 
When you switch from one lan-
guage keyboard to another, the actual 
characters on the keys may remain identi-
cal or display characters for that particu-
lar language, such as Korean, as shown 
in Figure 9-5. The automatic word sug-
gestion feature will now recognize words 
typed in that particular language.
To switch between foreign lan-
guage keyboards, do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap 
YouTube. The YouTube screen 
appears. (If you’ve previously 
searched for a YouTube video, 
you’ll see a list of your last dis-
played videos. Otherwise, the 
screen will be blank.) 
2.	
Tap Search at the bottom of the 
screen. 
3.	
Tap the search text box at the top 
of the screen. A keyboard appears 
at the bottom of the screen.
4.	
Tap the International key, as shown 
in Figure 9-6. Notice that each 
time you tap the International key, 
it displays a different foreign lan-
guage that lists terms for space 
and search.
5.	
Type a word in the language you 
chose. Notice that the automatic 
word suggestion feature now offers 
words in that language. 
6.	
To type foreign language characters with accent marks (such as é or ç), tap 
and hold down the appropriate letter on the keyboard until a menu of char-
acters with accent marks appears, as shown in Figure 9-7. Slide your fingertip 
over the character with the accent mark that you need. (If you lift your finger­
tip off the screen, this pop-up menu of foreign language characters will 
disappear.)
7.	
Press the Home button to return to the Home screen. 
Figure 9-5: Some languages, 
such as Korean, display com-
pletely different characters on

Additional Ideas for Changing Your iPhone’s 
Language
If you’re learning a foreign language, turn on the keyboard for that language and 
practice writing in the language that you’re studying. By using the automatic word 
suggestion feature, you can learn common words in another language.
Students of other languages can also help themselves learn by changing 
the default language of the iPhone. By making yourself read buttons and icons in 
Japanese, Spanish, or Portuguese, your iPhone can get you to start thinking in that 
other language. Now all you have to worry about is learning to speak and under-
stand that language when dealing with an actual human being.
Figure 9-7: Tapping and hold-
ing down a letter key displays 
variations of that letter with

If your iPhone starts acting like a bad PC and 
seems to be hopelessly fouled up, you may 
need to reset it to its original factory settings. 
This will wipe out any private information you’ve 
stored on your iPhone, but it will also wipe out 
any potential conflicts that may be causing your 
iPhone to crash, freeze, or behave erratically. 
Sometimes you can fix an erratic iPhone by 
updating its firmware (see Project 8). Firmware 
is the program that makes your iPhone actually 
work. It performs functions such as displaying 
icons on the screen. Apple constantly updates 
the iPhone’s firmware to fix problems iPhone 
users may be experiencing.

You can reset your iPhone in several ways, ranging from the mild to the dras-
tic. Sometimes programs may freeze or hang, just as they can on any computer. 
When that happens, you can often shut down the offending program, restart it, 
and everything works just fine again. If you run into persistent problems, you can 
also try updating specific apps on your iPhone that may be causing the problem. 
One way or another, you can find a way to keep your iPhone working properly.
Project goal: Learn how to reset your iPhone. 
What You’ll Be Using
To reset your iPhone, you need to use the following:
>
>
The Sleep/Wake button
The iPhone USB cable
The Settings application
iTunes (on your Mac or PC)
Shutting Down a Frozen Program
Occasionally a program may freeze and be unresponsive to anything you may do 
(including screaming and cursing). If this happens, you can shut down (also known 
as force quit) the frozen program by doing the following:
1.	
Press and hold down the Home button for approximately 10 seconds.
2.	
Release the Home button when the program closes by disappearing from 
the screen.
Try running the same program again to see if it works. If not, you may either 
need an updated version of that app or you may need to restart your entire iPhone, 
as explained in the following section.
Restarting Your iPhone
Restarting an iPhone is similar to rebooting a computer. Restarting essentially 
clears out the iPhone’s memory and allows it to start all over again. To restart an

Restoring Your iPhone
If you’ve used a PC, you’re probably familiar with the problems that occur when the 
computer acts up for no apparent reason. When this happens, you might have to 
reinstall the operating system and start all over again. Since the iPhone is nothing 
more than a miniature computer, it’s possible that your iPhone may start acting up, 
and you might have to resort to restoring it to its original factory settings. When 
you do this, you’ll wipe out all data that you’ve added to it, such as music or new 
apps. 
Q
Q Note: Restore your iPhone only as a last resort when you can’t get it to work 
any other way.
To restore an iPhone and wipe out everything on it in the process, follow

Additional Ideas for Troubleshooting Your 
iPhone 
Restarting programs can often cure their erratic behavior, but sometimes you need 
to go nuclear and wipe out everything so you can start all over again. Resetting all 
parts of your iPhone can be especially useful if you’re getting rid of your iPhone 
and want to erase any private information stored on it. 
For the most part, you’ll find your iPhone reliable and ready to use at all 
times. However, if problems occur and resetting your iPhone doesn’t stop them, 
try updating the firmware on your iPhone (see Project 8). As a last resort, bring your 
iPhone in to your nearest Apple store and let the experts worry about making the 
reluctant hardware work again.

Even though the iPhone is a full-fledged com-
puter disguised as a mobile phone, you can’t 
buy programs at your local computer store 
and install them like software on an ordinary 
computer. The only way you can install new 
programs on your iPhone is to go through 
Apple’s App Store.
The reason for this is security. When you 
install programs from any source, there’s 
always a chance of malicious software (known 
as malware) sneaking on to your computer 
and damaging it. That’s why Apple requires 
that software developers offer programs only 
through the App Store. After Apple examines 
a program to ensure that it’s safe, it can be 
installed on your iPhone.

Finding Software for Your iPhone
Before you can install software on the iPhone, you need to visit the App Store to 
find a program you want. Since so many people sell iPhone applications, the App 
Store consists of five different areas to help you choose what you need:
>
>
Featured  Lists the newest released apps (New) or the current batch of 
apps that are most popular (What’s Hot)
>
>
Categories  Lets you search for an iPhone program based on its function, 
such as Education, Finance, Games, or Productivity
>
>
Top 25  Lists the 25 most popular iPhone applications that others have 
downloaded
>
>
Search  Lets you type a descriptive word or phrase to search for an applica-
tion that matches your criteria
>
>
Updates  Shows if any of your cur-
rently installed apps have updates 
available
To find an application for your 
iPhone, you have two choices. First, you 
can install an app directly through your

Reading and Writing Software Reviews
After you find a program that you want to install, you can check its star rating, 
which ranges from one to five stars. As a general rule, you’ll find five-star apps 
more useful than one-star apps. 
To read reviews from other people about a particular app, beyond the sim-
plistic one-to-five-star rating system, do this:
1.	
Follow the steps in the section “Finding Software for Your iPhone” on page 78 
to find an application. Tap the name of the app to see to its Info page. 
2.	
Scroll down until you see the Reviews button that lists the app’s current rat-
ing (one to five stars) and how many reviews are available; Figure 11-4 shows 
a 9 Reviews button. (The bottom of each app’s Info screen also lists general 
information about that app, such as the version number, the company that 
made it, and the company’s web address.)
3.	
Tap the Reviews button. The Reviews screen appears, letting you see 
reviews from other people, as shown in Figure 11-5.
4.	
Scroll down to read the reviews for the app.
5.	
(Optional) Tap Write a Review. Type your iTunes Store password, and then 
use the virtual keyboard to type your review.
Figure 11-4: The Reviews but-
ton appears on the app’s Info 
screen.

Installing a Program
After browsing through the App Store, you’re sure to find a program that you want 
to install on your iPhone. To install a program, do this:
1.	
Find the program you want to install, and then tap the blue button to the 
right of the program name displaying the program’s price. Some apps are 
free, and some cost a few dollars. Once you tap it, the Price button changes 
into a green INSTALL button, as shown in Figure 11-6.
Q
Q Note: If you tap INSTALL, you’ll install the program right away, and the cost 
of the program will be charged to your iPhone cellular phone account, so 
make sure you really want to pay for a program before you tap that button. 
2.	
Tap INSTALL. An iTunes Password dialog appears, asking you to type your 
password, as shown in Figure 11-7.
3.	
Type your password and tap OK. The application icon appears on the Home 
screen with a loading message, as shown in Figure 11-8. 
4.

Updating Programs
Software developers frequently update their programs, which may offer new fea-
tures or eliminate problems with a previous program. To check whether any of 
your programs need updating, the App Store provides a handy Updates icon. This 
feature compares the applications installed on your iPhone to the latest versions 
of the same programs offered in the App Store. If you have an older version of a 
program, you can install the updated version through the App Store.
To check for and install updates on your iPhone, do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, you can check 
whether updates for your installed programs 
are available. If a number appears in the 
upper-right corner of the App Store icon, as 
shown in Figure 11-9, you know that updates 
are available.
2.	
Tap App Store. The App Store screen 
appears.
3.	
Tap Updates at the bottom of the screen. 
The Updates screen appears, listing any 
applications that can be updated. 
4.	
Tap the updates you want to install.

Deleting a Program
If you’ve installed programs on your iPhone, you can always delete the program 
icons and uninstall those programs. (You cannot, however, uninstall any programs 
that came preinstalled on the iPhone, such as iTunes, Maps, or Calendar.)
To delete an icon and uninstall the 
program that the icon represents, do 
this: 
1.	
From the Home screen, press and 
hold your finger on the program 
icon that you want to delete. A 
close button (an X in a red circle) 
appears in the upper-left corner 
of the icon. (If a close button does 
not appear, it means you cannot 
delete that icon and uninstall that 
program.)
Q
Q Note: Press the Home button if you 
decide you don’t want to delete the 
icon after all. The close button disap-
pears from the appropriate icon.
2.	
Tap the close button. A Delete 
dialog appears, as shown in 
Figure 11-10.
3.	
Tap Delete. The chosen icon dis-
appears from the Home screen, 
and the application is removed 
from your iPhone.
Installing and Deleting Software with iTunes
While you can install and delete apps directly on your iPhone, you can also use 
iTunes on your computer to install and delete apps. When you use iTunes, you’ll 
have to sync your iPhone with your computer for the new software changes to 
appear on your iPhone (see Project 12).
Installing Software in iTunes
Using iTunes to find iPhone apps can be convenient, since you can read an entire 
screen of information about a particular app rather than trying to read information 
on the screen of the iPhone. 
To install a program through iTunes, do this:
1.	
Open iTunes on your computer.
2.	
Click iTunes Store under the STORE category in the left pane. The iTunes 
screen appears, as shown in Figure 11-11.

Q Note: If an app costs money, be sure you’re willing to pay for it before you 
click the GET APP button. 
6.	
Click the GET APP button to download the app into iTunes. After download-
ing a program into iTunes, you’ll need to synchronize your iPhone with your 
computer to transfer the app to your iPhone (see Project 12).
Deleting Software in iTunes
You can also delete apps from within iTunes by following these steps: 
1.	
Open iTunes on your computer.
2.	
Plug your iPhone into your computer using the iPhone USB cable.
3.	
Click Applications under the LIBRARY category in the left pane of the iTunes 
window. A list of applications that you’ve downloaded appears.
4.	
Right-click the app you want to delete from your iPhone. A pop-up menu 
appears, as shown in Figure 11-14.

Click Delete. A dialog appears, asking if you really want to delete the 
chosen app.
6.	
Click Remove. Another dialog appears, asking if you want to keep the files or 
move them to the Trash.
7.	
Click Move to Trash (or click Keep Files if you think you might want to rein-
stall that app again in the future). The next time you synchronize your iPhone, 
iTunes will update your iPhone with the newly added or deleted apps.
Additional Ideas for Installing and 
Uninstalling Applications
The more programs you install on your iPhone, the harder it will be to find the one 
you want. You should feel free to install as many programs as you want, but the 
moment you don’t need an app any more, don’t be afraid to get rid of it. 
With so many free programs available, it’s tempting to download and 
install as many as possible. Resist that urge and install only the programs you 
really need. Then you can keep your iPhone lean and uncluttered so you can actu-
ally get important work done and have fun at the same time, which you’d be hard 
pressed to do with many other mobile phones on the market.

Lose Weight with Your 
iPhone
Uninstalling unwanted apps 
can lighten the load on your 
iPhone and give you more stor-
age space to install other apps. 
If you’re interested in losing 
weight yourself, one free app 
you might want to consider is 
Lose It!. The next time you’re in 
a restaurant, run this app and 
find out how many calories a 
turkey sandwich or cup of yogurt 
contains. By watching what you 
eat, you can lose weight or learn 
to eat healthier so you can live 
longer.

Chances are you have data stored on your com-
puter that you want to store on your iPhone. 
For example, you might have a huge music 
library that you want to transfer to your iPhone 
so you can listen to your favorite songs while 
you’re away from your computer. 
If you have crucial names, addresses, or 
appointments stored on your computer, you’ll 
probably want that information stored on your 
iPhone as well. You could retype all this infor-
mation into your iPhone, but a better solution is 
to synchronize data to transfer it between your 
computer and iPhone automatically.
To synchronize your data, you need to 
use the USB cable that came with your iPhone 
and the iTunes program. Every Macintosh 
comes with iTunes, but if you have a Windows 
PC, you’ll need to download and install iTunes 
Synchronizing Data

Project 12
directly from the Apple website (http://www.apple.com/itunes/download). After 
you have installed iTunes, you’ll be ready to synchronize your data.
Project goal: Learn how to synchronize data between your computer and 
your iPhone. 
What You’ll Be Using
To synchronize data, you need to use the following:
iTunes (on your Mac or PC)
The iPhone USB cable
Q
Q Note: The iPhone can transfer data to or from a Macintosh or a Windows 
PC, but if you have data trapped on another mobile phone, such as a Black-
Berry or Palm Treo, visit Mark/Space (http://www.markspace.com/) and buy 
a copy of the Missing Sync for iPhone program. This program can transfer 
data from other mobile phones and store it on your iPhone. Then you can 
toss your other mobile phone in the trash (or recycle it!) and happily use your 
iPhone instead.
Synchronizing Data
You can synchronize data between your iPhone and only one computer. If you have 
a laptop and a desktop computer, and each computer contains different music 
files and contact information, your iPhone can synchronize data with only one of 
them. If you try to synchronize with more than one computer, you’ll risk losing all 
your iPhone data. 
You can synchronize the following types of data:
>
>
Contacts and appointments
>
>
Email
>
>
Safari browser bookmarks
>
>
Ringtones
>
>
Music
>
>
Digital photographs
>
>
Podcasts
>
>
Video
>
>
iPhone applications
When synchronizing data, select the type of data you want to synchronize 
(such as email), and then choose the specific data you want to transfer (such as 
email from a particular account). After you select everything you want to transfer, 
you can synchronize the data with a click of the mouse. 

	
Synchronizing Data Between Your Computer and Your iPhone

Defining Synchronization Options
When you plug your iPhone into a computer with the iPhone USB cable, you have 
three choices for synchronizing your data:
>
>
Automatically synchronize all your selected data
>
>
Automatically synchronize only audio and video files
>
>
Manually synchronize audio and video files
If you select the third option, you’ll have to synchronize all of your data 
manually. To do this, just select the content you want to put on your iPhone in the 
right pane of iTunes library window, then drag it over to the icon for your iPhone 
in the Devices list in left pane of the iTunes window. Managing your data manually 
can be particularly convenient if the data on your computer is too large to fit on 
your iPhone; you can just pick and choose your favorites. (If your music library is 
too large to fit on your iPhone, you can create a playlist in iTunes with the content 
you want to transfer to your iPhone, and just sync this playlist.) 
To select synchronization options, follow these steps:
1.	
Connect your iPhone to your computer using the iPhone USB cable. 
2.	
Open iTunes on your computer. 
3.	
Click the name of your iPhone under the DEVICES category in the left pane 
of the iTunes window. The Summary tab should appear automatically, but if 
it doesn’t, just click the Summary tab to view the options for synchronizing 
your iPhone, as shown in Figure 12-1.

Syncing Contacts, Appointments, Email, and Bookmarks
If you’ve stored contact information in Address Book (on Mac OS X), in your Yahoo! 
Address Book Contacts, or in Google Contacts, you can synchronize this data and 
store it on your iPhone. The main reason you’d do this is to make sure you have the 
same data stored in multiple locations.
You can also synchronize appointments, email, and even bookmarks stored 
in Safari. Doing this essentially duplicates your computer data in your iPhone so 
you’ll never risk missing an appointment or an email message. 
Q
Q Note: If you use a Mac browser other than Safari, you can import bookmarks 
from your other browser into Safari, and then synchronize your bookmarks to 
your iPhone. If you have a PC, you can import bookmarks from either Safari or 
Internet Explorer.
To synchronize contacts, appointments, email, and Safari bookmarks to your 
iPhone, follow these steps:
1.	
Connect your iPhone to your computer and open iTunes.
2.	
Click the Info tab. Contacts and Calendars options appear, as shown in 
Figure 12-2.

Additional Ideas for Synchronizing Data
Keeping your music and data synchronized is crucial, so make sure you regularly 
synchronize your iPhone to your computer. If you plug your iPhone into your com-
puter using the iPhone USB cable, you can recharge your iPhone and keep your 
data synchronized at the same time.
Ultimately, your iPhone will only be as useful as your synchronization habits. 
If you fail to synchronize your data and your iPhone gets stolen or your computer 
suffers a hard disk crash, all your precious songs and contact information could be 
wiped out forever. 
Make it a habit to synchronize regularly. That way, if you lose your computer 
or your iPhone, you’ll be able to restore your data. Remember that the most impor-
tant part of your iPhone is its data. You can always buy another iPhone, but you can 
never easily replace your data once it’s gone.
Automatically Sync 
Your iPhone’s Contact 
Information 
If you have contact informa-
tion trapped in Gmail, Yahoo!, 
or Windows Live Hotmail, you 
can synchronize your informa-
tion using the free TrueSwitch 
Mobile Sync app. Although this 
app only synchronizes contact 
information (if you want to learn 
how to sync your calendar, see 
“Syncing Contacts, Appoint-
ments, Email, and Bookmarks” 
on page 92), this Rolodex infor-
mation is usually the most 
important part of everyone’s 
data. 
To make sure every-
thing remains updated, you can 
schedule this app to synchronize 
data for you automatically. Now 
when you look up someone’s 
contact information, you can be 
assured that it’s accurate.

Making 
Phone Calls


13
Although the iPhone is an all-in-one personal 
digital assistant (PDA), digital music player, and 
handheld computer, it’s also a full-featured 
mobile phone. Like other mobile phones, the 
iPhone lets you make calls, but you can do a 
whole lot more with your calls. As you’ll see in 
this project, making calls with your iPhone can 
be as simple or as sophisticated as you want. 
Talking to people is the main reason to use 
your iPhone, so learning how to make calls is 
important.
Project goal: Learn how to make phone 
calls with your iPhone.

What You’ll Be Using
To learn how to make calls with your iPhone, you need to use the following:
The Settings application
The Phone application
Dialing a Phone Number
Your iPhone gives you four ways to dial a phone number and make a call:
>
>
Keypad  Lets you dial a number directly
>
>
Contacts  Lets you search for a name stored in the Contacts program so 
you can dial the saved phone number for that person
>
>
Recents  Tracks the phone numbers of people who have called you so you 
can return their calls
>
>
Favorites  Lets you select names of people you call frequently from the 
Contacts program
Dialing a Number with the Keypad
The most straightforward way to dial a number is to use the keypad to type the 
phone number one digit at a time. To dial a number with the keypad, do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Phone. 
The Phone screen appears.
2.	
Tap Keypad at the bottom of 
the screen. The numeric keypad 
appears, as shown in Figure 13-1.
3.

numeric keypad. If you tap the 
wrong number by mistake, tap the 
Backspace key (the button directly 
to the right of Call) to correct it.
4.	
Tap Call to make your phone call.
Using the Keypad to Store 
a Number in the Contacts 
Program
If you dial a phone number and decide 
you want to save it for future use, you can 
store it in the Contacts program. That 
way, you’ll always be able to find it again 
and can just tap the phone number to 
call rather than typing the whole number.

are already stored in the Contacts 
program.
3.	
(Optional) Tap the All tab to view 
a list of phone numbers you have 
called and phone numbers that 
have called you. Tap the Missed 
tab to view only a list of calls you

Outgoing, or Missed Call screen 
appears, as shown in Figure 13-5.
Q
Q Note: An Incoming Call is a phone 
number that called you, which you 
answered. An Outgoing Call is a phone 
number that you called. A Missed Call 
is a phone number that called you, but 
you did not answer.

Tap Create New Contact or Add 
to Existing Contact. (Adding a 
phone number to an existing con-
tact can be handy if you’ve stored 
someone’s home number and 
recently received his or her mobile 
phone number, or vice versa.)
Storing a Number in the Favorites List
The Contacts program can store hundreds of names and phone numbers. 
Chances are good that out of all the names and phone numbers stored in the 
Contacts program, you’ll need quick access only to a handful of those numbers. 
Rather than wade through the Contacts program to find a phone number, you can 
store that phone number in your Favorites list. That way, you’ll be able to access 
the phone number quickly and easily. 
To store a number in the Favorites list, do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Phone. The Phone screen appears. 
2.	
Tap Favorites. A Favorites list appears, as shown in Figure 13-6.

Additional Ideas for Making Calls from 
Your iPhone
If you’re terrified of technology, you can still make calls from the iPhone by using 
the familiar numeric keypad, which turns your expensive iPhone into a simple 
telephone. If you often need to make calls to the same people, you can store your 
most frequently called numbers in the Contacts program and in your Favorites list.
Add the names and phone numbers of your immediate family members to 
your Favorites list (unless you don’t want to talk to them). Add your friends’ names 
and numbers to the Favorites list, too. You can also store emergency numbers, 
such as your automotive club phone number, in the Contacts program. That way, 
if you’re driving and get stuck on the road, you can dial for help without having to 
search for the right number to call. 
Making calls from your iPhone is easy, simple, and fun—which is how all our 
technological appliances should work. The first time you get an iPhone, practice 
calling different people using all the methods described in this chapter. You can 
brag to your friends and family about your new iPhone while learning all the differ-
ent ways to dial a phone number and make a call. 
Figure 13-7: This screen lets you 
modify your calling options.
Figure 13-8: The Show My 
Caller ID screen lets you turn 
caller ID on or off.

Answering a phone call might seem like a trivial 
task, but your iPhone offers a variety of options 
for responding to a call. If you can’t answer your 
iPhone when it rings, you can set up voicemail 
or forward your calls to another phone num-
ber. While you’re talking to someone, you can 
answer another call by using call waiting. With 
so many different ways to answer an iPhone, it’s 
possible to receive calls at your convenience, 
whatever that may be at the time.
Project goal: Learn how to answer phone 
calls and use voicemail and other options on 
your iPhone.

What You’ll Be Using
To learn how to answer and manage calls 
with your iPhone, you need to use the 
following:
The Settings application
The Phone application
The Contacts application
Answering and 
Ending a Call
If you receive a call on your iPhone while 
your iPhone is in sleep mode, the screen 
displays the phone number of the caller 
and gives you the option of answering 
the call by sliding the arrow across the 
bottom of the screen.
If you are using your iPhone when 
you receive a call, the caller’s phone 
number appears on the screen along 
with a red Decline button and a green 
Answer button, as shown in Figure 14-1.
Q
Q Note: If you want your iPhone to display the caller’s name on the screen 
instead of his or her telephone number, you’ll need to store that person’s 
name and phone number in the Contacts program (see Project 13).
If you want to take the call, tap Answer. If you don’t want to answer the call, 
tap Decline. (You can also ignore the call completely, but then your iPhone will 
continue vibrating or ringing, which you may find annoying.) 
If you’re wearing your iPhone headset and receive a call, you can answer it by 
pressing the mic button attached to the cord, as shown in Figure 14-2.
Figure 14-1: Decline and 
Answer buttons appear when 
you receive a phone call.
Figure 14-2: The mic 
button lets you answer 
a call while wearing the 
headset.

|	 113
When you’re ready to end your call, 
move the iPhone away from your ear; the 
iPhone automatically displays a red End 
Call button at the bottom of the screen, 
as shown in Figure 14-3. To end your call, 
tap End Call.
Using Ringtones
Storing a person’s name and phone num-
ber in the Contacts program can help 
identify that person by name whenever 
he or she calls you. To help you identify 
who is calling, you can also set up differ-
ent ringtones for each caller.
Normally, when you receive a 
call, your iPhone plays the same sound, 
whether the person calling is your best 
friend or a bill collector. Ringtones give 
you the option of assigning each caller 
a particular ringtone. The ringtone your 
iPhone makes when you get a call can 
help you decide whether or not you want 
to answer that call.
To define a ringtone for a name 
already stored in the Contacts program, 
do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap 
Contacts. (You may need to slide 
the Home screen to the side to 
see the second screen where the 
Contacts icon appears.) The Con-
tacts screen appears.
2.	
Tap a name that you want to iden-
tify with a unique ringtone. The Info 
screen appears, showing the stored 
information about that person, as 
shown in Figure 14-4.
Figure 14-3: The End Call but-
ton appears when you move the 
iPhone away from your ear.
Figure 14-4: The Info screen 
lets you choose a ringtone for a 
caller.

Project 14
3.	
Tap Ringtone. A Ringtones screen 
appears, as shown in Figure 14-5.
4.	
Tap a ringtone name and press the 
Home button. The next time this 
person calls, his or her name will 
appear, and you’ll hear a unique 
ringtone play.
Using Voicemail
Since you can’t always answer every call, 
you can do the next best thing (besides 
ignoring people) and set up your voice-
mail account. Now if people call and you 
don’t answer, they’ll get routed to your 
voicemail, where they can hear a brief 
message and then leave a message of 
their own. 
Setting Up Voicemail
When you first get an iPhone, you’ll need 
to set up a password and record a greet-
ing by doing this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Phone. 
The Phone screen appears.
2.	
Tap Voicemail in the lower-right 
corner of the screen. A Setup 
screen appears.
Q
Q Note: If you have already set up your 
voicemail, you can modify your out­
going message by tapping Greeting 
in the upper-left corner of the screen. 
Skip to step 6.
3.	
Tap Set Up Now. A Password 
screen appears, asking you to type 
a four-digit voicemail password, as 
shown in Figure 14-6.
Q
Q Note: Rather than try to memorize a 
numeric password, think of a short, 
memorable word that you’ll never 
forget and type that word as your 
password, using the letters on the 
numeric keys as a guide.
Figure 14-5: The Ringtones 
screen lists all the different ring-
tones available.
Figure 14-6: The Password

voicemail, you won’t see any mes-
sages saved there yet.
8.	
Press the Home button to return to 
the Home screen. 
Listening to Voicemail
If you miss a call or have voicemail wait-
ing for you, your iPhone screen displays 
an alert so you can take action (or just 
ignore that call altogether). To listen to 
your voicemail messages, do this: 
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Phone. 
The Phone screen appears. A num-
ber in a red circle appears in the 
upper-right corner of the Voicemail 
icon to let you know how many 
voicemail messages you haven’t 
heard yet, as shown in Figure 14-8.
2.	
Tap Voicemail at the lower-right 
corner. The Voicemail screen 
appears and displays a blue dot 
next to all new messages. 
3.	
Tap a message that you want to 
hear. The message starts playing, 
as shown in Figure 14-9.

Q
Q Note: If you have stored the caller’s name and phone number in the Contacts 
program, you can tap the arrow that appears to the right of the caller’s name 
to view contact information for that person.
5.	
Tap Call Back to call that person back, or tap Delete to erase the mes-
sage. (If you tap Delete, your iPhone stores the deleted message in a special 
Deleted Messages area. If you tap the Voicemail icon and then tap Deleted 
Messages, you’ll see a Deleted screen, where you can undelete a message 
or clear it and wipe it out for good, as shown in Figure 14-10.)
6.	
Press the Home button to return to the Home screen.
Setting Up Call Forwarding and Call Waiting
If you don’t want to miss a phone call, the iPhone gives you the option of setting 
up call forwarding. If someone calls you on your iPhone, you can automatically 
route the call to another phone and answer it there. This feature lets callers call 
your iPhone number so you don’t have to give out new phone numbers whenever 
you happen to be somewhere else, such as a place that doesn’t have cell phone 
service.
Another way to answer calls is through call waiting. This feature lets you put 
your current caller on hold so you can answer a new incoming call.

Additional Ideas for Answering Calls
To help screen your calls, you can store the names and phone numbers of people 
you know in the Contacts program. That way, every time you receive a call, you’ll 
see a real name on the screen instead of a meaningless phone number. Once 
you see a name that you recognize, you’ll know whether the caller is someone you 
want to talk to or avoid. 
To help you identify a caller from a ringtone, you can choose distinctive 
ringtones for each caller. Play a happy sound for someone you like and a mournful 
sound for someone you want to avoid.
By using voicemail, you can effectively turn your iPhone into an answering 
machine, so you’ll never have to take another phone call again. Get creative with 
answering your iPhone. Remember that just because someone calls you, it doesn’t 
mean you’re obligated to talk to that person. The less time you let others interrupt 
you with phone calls, the more time you’ll have to pursue and achieve the goals 
most important to you. 

15
You can do more than just talk on your iPhone. 
If you need to speak to someone standing next 
to you while you’re using your iPhone, you can 
mute the iPhone so you can chat in private. 
Or, if you want everyone around you to hear 
your caller’s comments and make comments of 
their own, you can turn on the iPhone’s built-in 
speakerphone and let everyone participate.
If you’re talking on your iPhone and you 
need to look up somebody’s phone number in 
the Contacts program, you can do that quickly 
without having to end your call. If you find your-
self talking to someone important, you can 
make a conference call so multiple people can 
join in the conversation. With so many options 
available, you can make talking on the iPhone 
both convenient and productive.
Project goal: Learn the different options for 
talking on your iPhone.

What You’ll Be Using
To learn to use the various talk options on your iPhone, you need to use the 
following:
The Phone application
Displaying Options
When you’re talking on your iPhone, you 
can’t see the screen since it’s pressed 
against your ear. The moment you move 
your iPhone away from your ear, it senses 
the movement and displays a screen 
with seven different options, as shown in 
Figure 15-1:

>
Mute
>
>
Keypad
>
>
Speaker
>
>
Add Call
>

To choose an option, just tap it. 
Muting the Speaker
If you’re talking on your iPhone and need to speak to someone standing next to 
you, you can cover the iPhone’s speaker so that the caller can’t hear your side con-
versation, or you can mute the speaker.
To mute the speaker during a call, do this:
1.	
Move the iPhone away from your face so you can see its screen.
2.	
Tap Mute. The Mute icon appears highlighted, and you can say anything 
you want without the caller hearing what you say (unless you accidentally tap 
Mute again).
Figure 15-1: Seven different 
options are available during a 
phone call.

Using Keys on the 
Keypad
If you call many businesses, you may 
often wind up listening to a computer 
telling you to choose different options by 
pressing a number. To tap numeric keys 
on the iPhone, do this:
1.	
Move the iPhone away from your 
face so you can see its screen.
2.	
Tap Keypad. The Keypad screen 
appears, as shown in Figure 15-2. 
Tap any numeric keys you need to 
indicate your choices.
3.	
Tap Hide Keypad to hide the Key-
pad screen.
Turning on the 
Speakerphone
Talking on the phone is usually a private 
affair, but if you’re in a crowded room 
with other people, you may want your 
cohorts to hear what the caller has to 
say. Rather than force everyone to crowd 
around your iPhone, you can turn on your 
iPhone’s speakerphone so that everyone 
nearby can hear the conversation. 
To turn on the iPhone’s speaker-
phone, do this:
1.	
Move the iPhone away from your 
face so you can see its screen.
2.	
Tap Speaker. The Speaker icon 
appears highlighted, as shown 
in Figure 15-3. Now your iPhone 
will broadcast the conversation 
through the speakerphone.
3.	
Tap Speaker again to remove the 
highlight and turn off the feature.

Using Conference Calls
A conference call lets you connect with up to five people simultaneously. This can 
be handy for speaking to multiple people at once without the nuisance of calling 
each person individually. To set up a conference call, you first call one person and 
then add other people to that call. Repeat the process to add additional callers. 
Initiating a Conference Call
You can start a conference call at any time while chatting on your iPhone with 
another person. To start a conference call, do this:
1.	
Call someone on your iPhone, 
either by tapping the number on 
the keypad or selecting a stored 
number in your Contacts program. 
2.	
Move the iPhone away from your 
face so you can see its screen.
3.	
Tap Add Call. The Contacts screen 
appears, where you can select a 
stored number to dial. 
4.	
(Optional) Tap Keypad and dial a 
phone number of the person you 
want to add to your conference 
call. 
Q
Q NOTE: While you’re dialing another 
number to add to your conference call, 
you automatically put your other call-
ers on hold. When you put a caller on 
hold, that caller can still chat with oth-
ers in the same conference call.
5.	
Move the iPhone away from your 
face so you can see its screen after 
you’ve connected to another caller. 
Notice that Merge Calls and Swap 
icons now appear on the screen, as 
shown in Figure 15-4.
6.	
(Optional) Tap Swap to put your current caller on hold and talk to the other 
person currently on hold.
7.	
Tap Merge Calls to merge all calls so everyone can chat with each other.

Dropping a Caller and Chatting Privately on a Conference Call
If you’re in the midst of a conference call and want to hang up on one of your con-
ference callers or chat with someone privately, do this:
1.	
Move the iPhone away from your face so you can see its screen. Notice that 
the top of the screen displays the word Conference to let you know you’re 
currently in a conference call, as shown in Figure 15-5. 
2.	
Tap the arrow to the right of the word Conference at the top of the screen. 
The Conference screen appears, as shown in Figure 15-6.

(Optional) To end a conversation and hang up, tap the red phone button that 
appears to the left of a name, and then tap End Call when it pops up.
4.	
(Optional) Tap PRIVATE, which appears to the right of a name, to have a 
private conversation with that person. Others involved in the conference call 
will not be able to hear you speak in this private conversation.
5.	
When you want to rejoin the conference call, move the iPhone away from 
your face and tap Merge Calls. 
6.	
(Optional) Tap Swap to put the current caller on hold and chat with someone 
else waiting on hold.

Putting a Caller on Hold
If you’re in the middle of a call and suddenly need to temporarily halt your conver-
sation, you can put the caller on hold by doing this:
1.	
Move the iPhone away from your face so you can see its screen.
2.	
Tap Hold. The Hold icon appears highlighted.
3.	
Tap Hold again to return to your initial conversation.
Taking Another Call While Talking to 
Someone Else
If you’re in the middle of a call and someone else calls, you have three choices. 
First, you can ignore the incoming call. Second, you can put your current call on 
hold and then answer the incoming call. Third, you can end your current call and 
answer the incoming call. 
To choose one of these options, do 
the following while you’re on a call:
1.	
When an incoming call comes in, 
move the iPhone away from your 
face so you can see its screen. 
The phone number or person’s 
name (if you’ve stored it in the 
Contacts program) of the incom-
ing call appears, along with a 
menu of three buttons, as shown 
in Figure 15-7.
2.	
Tap Ignore to send the incoming 
call directly to your voicemail. 
3.	
Tap Hold Call + Answer to switch 
calls and talk exclusively to the 
incoming caller. After you answer a 
call, you can swap callers (put the 
new caller on hold and go back to 
your first caller) or merge the new 
caller into a conference call.
4.	
Tap End Call + Answer to hang up 
on the current caller and talk to the 
incoming caller.
Figure 15-7: When an incom-
ing call interrupts your current 
conversation, you’ll have three 
options for handling that new 
call.

Viewing Your Contacts
In the middle of a conversation, someone may ask you for another person’s email 
address or phone number. If you’ve stored this information in the Contacts pro-
gram, you can view this information without having to end your call. To view the 
Contacts screen during a phone call, do this:
1.	
Move the iPhone away from your face so you can see its screen.
2.	
Tap Contacts. The Contacts screen appears. 
3.	
Tap the person’s name to view his or her information.
Additional Ideas for Talking on Your iPhone
Using the speakerphone can be particularly handy when you’re driving and you 
don’t want to hold your iPhone against your ear, so you can keep both hands on 
the steering wheel. The Mute feature is also useful for times when you want to say 
something that you don’t really want the caller to hear. You can pretend to make 
a call to your boss and launch into a tirade of insults (with the Mute feature turned 
on, of course) so that your co-workers will think you’re brave (or just extremely 
foolhardy).


16
To contact someone immediately, you’ll usually 
make a phone call. However, sometimes you 
or the other person can’t speak on the phone 
(maybe the person is in a library, a classroom, 
or a business meeting). In that case, you can 
still contact that person by sending him or her a 
text message.
A text message (also called an SMS, for 
short message service) is a short message that 
you type and send directly to another person’s 
mobile phone number. (Sending a text mes-
sage to a non–mobile phone number won’t 
work and will return an error message.) You can 
also send audio (using the Voice Memos app 
explained in Project 36) and pictures (captured 
through the built-in camera) via text messages. 
Sending audio and picture files is known as 
MMS, for multimedia messaging service. Just 
remember that not all mobile phones support 
MMS, so your message may not be delivered.
Sending and 
Receiving Text 
Messages

128	 |	
Project 16
Students and bored co-workers often text message each other so they 
don’t bother anyone around them. Other people text message rather than make 
an actual phone call because they enjoy the whole text messaging process. 
(Then again, some people have been known to walk into walls or oncoming traffic 
because they’re too busy text messaging to pay attention to their surroundings—
so be careful when you decide to read or write text messages.)
Project goal: Learn how to write, send, and read text messages with your 
iPhone. 
What You’ll Be Using
To learn how to text message with your iPhone, you need to use the following:
The Messages application
The Contacts application
Sending Text Messages
The two parts of any text message are the message itself and the mobile phone 
number to which you want to send that message. You can type a phone number 
or tap a phone number saved in your Contacts program. Each time you send or 
receive a text message from the same person (identified by his or her mobile 
phone number), your iPhone stores that message in a list. 
To write and send a text message, do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap 
Messages. The Messages screen 
appears, listing all your text mes-
saging conversations, as shown 
in Figure 16-1. (The number of 
unread text messages appears in 
parentheses next to the Messages 
heading.) 
2.	
Tap the New Message icon (the 
square with the pen) in the upper-
right corner of the screen. A New 
Message screen appears, as shown 
in Figure 16-2.
3.	
Type a phone number in the To 
text box, or tap the plus sign that 
appears in the blue circle to the 
right of the To text box to display 
the Contacts screen, where you 
can tap the name of the person you 
want to receive your text message. 
4.	
Tap the message text box and type 
a message.

Tap the back button in the upper-left corner of the screen to return to the 
Messages screen.
Clearing and Deleting Text Messages
When you start receiving text messages, your iPhone sorts them by phone num-
ber so that you can read all text messages received from each cell phone number. 
However, the more text messages you receive, the more cluttered your collection 
of text messages will get. To reduce the number of text messages stored on your 
iPhone, you can clear all text messages sent from a phone number or delete an 
entire collection of text messages from a phone number. 
Clearing Text Messages
Once you start sending messages, you’ll wind up with long lists of old messages 
from specific people. You can choose to clear out all your stored messages or just 
select the messages that you want to delete. 
To clear one or more messages from a particular mobile phone number, do 
this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap 
Messages. The Messages screen 
appears, listing all your text mes-
saging conversations (see Fig-
ure 16-1). (If you just see messages 
from a specific conversation, tap 
the Messages button in the upper-
left corner of the screen to view the 
entire list of conversations stored 
on your iPhone.)
2.	
Tap a conversation that contains 
the messages you want to clear. 
The screen displays all messages 
for that phone number.
3.	
Tap Edit. Radio buttons appear to 
the left of each message, as shown 
in Figure 16-12.

another mobile phone number.
Deleting a Text Message List
If you want to wipe out both your text messages and the mobile phone number 
from which you’ve been receiving those text messages, you can delete an entire 
text message list. This can come in handy if you no longer need to store some-
one’s mobile phone number (because you no longer need to talk to that person or 
because that number has been changed). 
To delete an entire text message list, do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap 
Messages. The Messages screen 
appears, listing text messaging 
conversations (see Figure 16-1).

Tap Delete. Your iPhone deletes 
the chosen text message list 
and the associated mobile phone 
number. (If you suddenly change 
your mind and don’t want to delete 
a message, just tap the white minus 
sign in the red circle again.)

Additional Ideas for Using Text Messages
Messaging can be a less intrusive and more reliable way to communicate with 
someone. Rather than leave a voicemail that someone might not understand or 
listen to, you can type a message, send a picture, or send an audio file so he or she 
can read, see, or hear your message right away.
Messages are perfect for communicating with someone without the hassle 
of making an actual phone call. For example, you might want to message someone 
to send a note of encouragement right before he goes to an important business 
meeting or takes a crucial exam. That way, you can send your message without 
interrupting his concentration.
Sending messages is also handy for communicating short bits of information 
that would seem trivial to ask via a phone call, such as reminding your spouse to 
pick up eggs and milk when he’s on his way to the supermarket or letting someone 
know that you’re running late to an appointment.
If you’re on vacation, send pictures of yourself relaxing on the beach or visit-
ing an exotic location. Use messages wisely, and you can increase your communi-
cation with others at your convenience.

After using your iPhone, you might be curious 
to know how much storage space is available, 
how many songs or pictures you’ve saved, how 
many minutes you’ve used to make calls, or 
even what your phone number is. Fortunately, 
your iPhone saves this information and much 
more, so you can review the technical details of 
your iPhone at any time.

What You’ll Be Using
To browse information about your iPhone, you need to use the following:
The Settings application
Finding Your Phone 
Number

away so you can give it to someone else, 
do this: 
1.	
From the Home screen, tap 
Settings. The Settings screen 
appears.
2.	
Scroll down and tap Phone. The 
Phone screen appears with your 
number displayed at the top, as 
shown in Figure 17-1.

Additional Ideas for Reviewing Your iPhone 
Information
The technical details of your iPhone (such as the model number or version number) 
might seem irrelevant, but you should take the time to jot down this information 
and store it in a safe place. That way, if you lose your iPhone, you’ll be able to pro-
vide technical identification numbers to the authorities in case they find it so they 
can give your iPhone back to you. 
If you keep storing songs, videos, and pictures on your iPhone, review your 
storage capacity periodically so you won’t run out of room. You don’t want to try to 
capture a picture of a UFO or the Loch Ness monster that could be worth a million 
bucks, only to find out your iPhone can’t save the picture since it ran out of free 
space three days ago.

A ringtone is a unique sound, typically a frag-
ment of a popular song, that you can set as 
your default ringtone to notify you of a call 
or that you can associate with a specific per-
son in your Contacts program. When ordinary 
people call, you’ll hear a default audio ring, 
but if you’ve set a ringtone for a person in your 
Contacts program, you’ll hear that particular 
ringtone only when that person calls. You can 
use unique ringtones to identify certain types 
of people (such as customers or family mem-
bers) or to identify a specific person such as 
your boss, stockbroker, or significant other. 
The most common way to get a ringtone is 
to buy it through the iTunes Store, usually for 
99 cents. However, there are ways to create 
ringtones that won’t cost you anything, and 
you’ll learn about them in this chapter.

7.	
Click the Preview button to hear your ringtone.
8.	
Click the Buy button when you’re ready to buy your ringtone for 99 cents.
Creating Ringtones in GarageBand ’09
The problem with creating ringtones in iTunes is that you can convert only songs 
you purchased through iTunes into ringtones. If you just imported a song from an 
audio CD, and you try to use it as a ringtone, iTunes will display an error message 
saying that it can convert only purchased songs, indirectly scolding you for not 
doing your part to spend money at the iTunes Store. 
If you use a Macintosh, however, you can create free ringtones with the 
GarageBand program. Use GarageBand to convert your song into a ringtone by 
doing this:
1.	
Open GarageBand on your computer. The GarageBand opening screen 
appears, as shown in Figure 18-3.

Additional Ideas for Using Ringtones
After you create a ringtone on your computer, you’ll have to sync your iPhone to 
your computer to transfer it (see Project 12). You can then assign a ringtone to a 
contact (see Project 14).
While most people use song fragments for their ringtones, you can use any 
audio recording as a ringtone, so get a copy of various sound effects and let your 
imagination go wild. Grab a sound effect of a man snoring, and use that as a ring-
tone to identify your boss. (Don’t worry. If your boss is within earshot, he’ll never be 
calling you, so he will never hear the snoring ringtone.) 
Rather than use sound effects, you can also use parts of recorded speeches 
as ringtones. Assign part of Martin Luther King, Jr.’s “I have a dream” speech as a 
ringtone to identify when a prominent business leader or politician calls you. Use 
your favorite movie quotes as a ringtone, such as Clint Eastwood saying, “You’ve 
got to ask yourself one question, ‘Do I feel lucky?’ Well, do ya, punk?” Between 
your favorite songs, sound effects, and speeches, you’re sure to find the perfect 
ringtone for everyone who calls you most often.

Your iPhone comes with external speakers, so 
you can listen to your favorite songs by holding 
your iPhone up to your ear (so you can pretend 
that you’re actually making a call). Or you can 
listen through ear buds or headphones that you

As soon as you store your favorite songs on 
your iPhone, you’ll probably want to start listen-
ing to them, so this chapter will show you how 
to do that right away.

To learn how to listen to music with your iPhone, you need to use the following:
The iPod application
Playing Your Songs
After you’ve stored songs on your iPhone, you can listen to the songs stored in 
your music library in two ways:
>
>
In alphabetical order by song title
>
>
In random order
Q
Q NOTE: You’ll learn how to play groups of songs in Project 20.
Playing Songs in Alphabetical Order
Your iPhone stores songs in alphabetical order, which is handy when you’re try-
ing to find a particular song by name. If you want to play every song in your music 
library, tap the first song in the alphabetical list and your iPhone will play that song, 
and then all the songs that follow it in the list. If you select a song from the middle 
of the list, such as the first song whose title begins with the letter E, your iPhone 
will play all songs whose titles start with the letters E through Z and then cycle 
back to the beginning with all song titles starting with the letter A. 
To play music in alphabetical order, 
do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap iPod. 
The iPod screen appears.
2.	
Tap Songs. The Songs screen 
appears, listing songs in alphabeti-
cal order, with the entire alphabet 
displayed vertically on the right 
side of the screen, as shown in 
Figure 19-1.
3.	
Scroll down to a song you want to 
hear, or tap a letter on the alpha-
betical list on the right side of the 
screen to see song titles that begin 
with that letter.
4.	
Tap the song title that you want 
to hear first. Your iPhone plays the 
chosen song, and will then play 
the rest of the songs on the list in 
alphabetical order. When it reaches 
the end of the list, it starts all over 
again from the top, starting with

Controlling Your Music
When your iPhone plays a song, you have several options for controlling the song 
or viewing information about it. If you want, you can ignore all these options and 
just listen to music, but by learning what you can do while listening to a song, you 
can better control your listening experience. 
Adjusting the Volume and Pausing
The most obvious way to adjust a song is by changing the volume. The Volume Up 
and Volume Down buttons on the side of the iPhone let you adjust the volume, but 
while each song is playing, you’ll see a horizontal volume slider at the bottom of 
the Now Playing screen that you can slide to the left or right with your fingertip, as 
shown in Figure 19-3.
Q
Q Note: If you press the Volume Up and Volume Down buttons on the side of 
the iPhone, you’ll see the volume slider move left and right.
If you need to pause a song, tap the pause button, which then changes to a 
play button. When you’re ready to hear your song again, tap the play button.

Skipping Songs
Sometimes you may hear a song and decide that you want to skip over it. To skip a 
song, do one of the following:
>
>
Tap the next button.
>
>
Press the mic button on the iPhone headset twice.
Playing the Previous Song
Rather than skip a song, you might want to play the previous song again. If you 
tap the previous button twice in rapid succession, you can play the song that you 
heard prior to the current song. 
Suppose, for example, you listened a song by Jessica Simpson and are now 
listening to a song by the Rolling Stones. Tapping the previous button twice will 
jump back to play the Jessica Simpson song from the beginning.
Choosing Which Part of a Song to Play
Your iPhone always plays a song starting from the beginning, but you can start 
listening to a song at a different position, such as in the middle of the song.
To choose a position to start playing a song, do this:
1.	
Follow the steps in “Playing Your Songs” on page 152 to listen to a song. 
2.	
(Optional) Tap the previous button to start playing a song from the begin-
ning after it has already started playing. 
3.	
Tap the screen to display the position slider at the top of the screen (see 
Figure 19-2).
4.	
Drag the position slider left or right to listen to a different part of the song.
Repeating Songs
When you tap the screen while a song is playing, the position slider appears near 
the top of the screen. In the lower-left corner of the position slider is the repeat 
icon (see Figure 19-2). 
This repeat icon can appear in one 
of three ways, as shown in Figure 19-4:
>
>
Off  The repeat icon is not high-
lighted and all songs play only 
once.
>
>
On  The repeat icon is highlighted 
in blue and keeps playing all the 
songs in your library or playlist 
indefinitely.
>
>
Single  The number 1 appears on 
the blue highlighted repeat icon, 
which causes the currently playing 
song to keep playing over and over 
again.
Figure 19-4: The repeat icon 
lets you choose to repeat a 
song or a playlist.

156	 |	
Project 19
Each time you tap the repeat icon, it changes; keep tapping it until it displays 
the repeat cycle that you want for your song or playlist.
Navigating Between Screens While Playing 
Music
When you play a song, you can continue doing other things on your iPhone, such 
as playing games, looking up names in your Contacts, or browsing the Internet. 
(Your iPhone temporarily shuts off your music when you’re making an actual phone 
call.) While you’re listening to a song, you can either switch to another program 
altogether or view other screens in the music program. 
Running Another App
To run another app while continuing to play music, do this: 
1.	
Follow the steps in “Playing Your Songs” on page 152 to start listening to a 
song. 
2.	
Press the Home button. The Home screen appears. From here, you can tap 
the icon for any app to start using that app while listening to music.
3.	
To view your currently playing song again, press the Home button to return 
to the Home screen, and then tap iPod.
Viewing Another Part of the iPod Screen
To navigate your way around the various music screens in the iPod application 
while continuing to play music, do this:
1.	
Follow the steps in “Playing Your Songs” on page 152 to start listening to a 
song. 
2.	
Tap the back arrow button that appears in the upper-left corner of the screen 
(see Figure 19-3). The Songs screen appears with a Now Playing button in the 
upper-right corner. At this point, you can tap any of the icons at the bottom 
of the screen to view other screens, such as your list of videos.
3.	
Tap Now Playing in the upper-right corner of any iPod screen (see Fig-
ure 19-1) to see the Now Playing screen for the currently playing song.
Additional Ideas for Listening to Music
Listening to music can turn your iPhone into a portable jukebox so you can hear 
your favorite songs any time no matter where you go. Of course, you don’t have to 
limit yourself to music. You can listen to inspirational or motivational speeches and 
turn your iPhone into a private and portable audio-educational center. Add record-
ings of foreign-language tutorials and learn to speak another language. The more 
audio files you store on your iPhone, the larger your audio collection will get and 
the more likely you’ll be able to listen to everything in your music library without 
hearing the same thing twice.

Turn Your iPhone into a Musical Instrument
Almost everybody loves music of one kind or another (although nearly every-
one can get just as passionate about the types of music they don’t like). While 
listening to music can be fun, you might want to go one step further and learn 
how to make your own music.
Rather than buy or rent an expensive instrument, download one of 
many apps that can turn your iPhone into everything from a piano or drum kit 
to a kazoo or a flute. While these apps aren’t a substitute for a real instrument, 
they can help you make simple music while also learning the basics of different 
types of instruments.
The next time you get tired of listening to recorded music, start making 
your own. Who knows? You just might find yourself playing music more than 
just listening to it.
Mini Piano  http://jyproduct.webhop.net/jyblog/index.php/minipiano/
Kalimba  http://discovolos.com/Discovolos/Discovolos.html
You can turn your iPhone into a keyboard or 
other musical instrument.


20
If you have a large music library on your iPhone, 
listening to every song could take hours or 
even days. Rather than listen to all your songs, 
you may want to listen to a handful of songs, 
such as songs by a particular recording artist or 
perhaps a collection of songs that you like best 
for driving, meditating, or exercising.

What You’ll Be Using
To learn how to create playlists and listen to particular music on your iPhone, 
you need to use the following:
The iPod application
iTunes (on your Mac or PC)
The iPhone USB cable
Creating a Playlist
A playlist is a collection of songs that you’ve grouped together for any reason, such 
as a list of your favorite heavy metal songs, the best songs to hear while you’re 
meditating, or some old favorite songs from a specific year. 
You can create a playlist in three ways:
>
>
Create an on-the-go playlist on your iPhone.
>
>
Create a Genius playlist on your iPhone.
>
>
Create a playlist on your computer using iTunes.
Creating an On-the-Go Playlist
Making a playlist on your iPhone is handy when you’re in the mood for listening to 
certain songs and don’t have time to create a playlist through iTunes on your com-
puter. You can create only one on-the-go 
playlist. After you create an on-the-go 
playlist, you can later edit or clear songs 
on the list. 
To create an on-the-go playlist, 
do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap iPod. 
The iPod screen appears.
2.	
Tap Playlists at the bottom of 
the screen. The Playlists screen 
appears. If you’ve created other 
playlists and synchronized them 
through iTunes, you’ll see those 
playlists displayed as well, as shown 
in Figure 20-1.
3.	
Tap On-The-Go. The Songs screen 
appears, where you can choose 
the songs you want to add to the 
on-the-go playlist, as shown in 
Figure 20-2.
Figure 20-1: The Playlists screen 
lists all available playlists.

	
Listening to Groups of Songs	
|	 161
4.	
Tap the plus sign to the right of each song you want to add to your on-the-go 
playlist. (You may need to scroll down to see all your songs.) Each song title 
you choose appears dimmed to let you know that you’ve chosen it for your 
playlist.
5.	
When you’re done adding songs to your on-the-go playlist, tap Done in the 
upper-right corner of the screen. The On-The-Go screen appears with a list 
of all your songs, as shown in Figure 20-3. 
6.	
At this point, you can tap Shuffle to play your entire on-the-go playlist ran-
domly, or you can tap a song name to play it first and then let your iPhone 
play the songs in alphabetical order.
Deleting an On-the-Go Playlist
You can have only one on-the-go playlist at a time on your iPhone, so if you want 
to change it, you can either edit individual songs on the playlist or clear the whole 
thing out and start over again. To clear out your entire on-the-go playlist, do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap iPod. The iPod screen appears.
2.	
Tap Playlists. The Playlists screen appears (see Figure 20-1).
3.	
Tap On-The-Go. The On-The-Go screen appears. 
4.	
Tap Clear at the top of the screen, and then tap Clear Playlist at the bottom 
of the screen to clear out your entire on-the-go playlist.
Figure 20-2: Tap the plus sign 
next to all the songs you want 
to include in your on-the-go 
playlist.

Project 20
Editing an On-the-Go Playlist
If you want to delete or add some songs to your on-the-go playlist, you don’t have 
to clear the whole thing out and start from scratch. It’s much easier to delete and 
add songs individually. To edit your on-the-go playlist, do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap iPod. The iPod screen appears.
2.	
Tap Playlists. The Playlists screen appears (see Figure 20-1).
3.	
Tap On-The-Go. The On-The-Go screen appears. 
4.	
Tap Edit. Red circles with white 
minus signs appear to the left of 
each song title, and three horizon-
tal bars appear to the right of each 
song title. 
5.	
(Optional) Slide the three horizon-
tal bars to the right of a song up 
or down to rearrange the order of 
your songs.
6.	
Tap the white minus sign in the red 
circle next to a song you want to 
remove from the list. A red Delete 
button appears to the right of the 
song, as shown in Figure 20-4.
7.	
Tap Delete to remove the song 
from the on-the-go playlist (or tap 
the minus sign again to keep the 
song in your playlist). 
Q
Q NOTE: Deleting a song from the play­
list does not delete the song from your 
iPhone.
8.	
Tap the plus sign in the upper-left corner of the screen. The Songs screen 
appears. 
9.	
Tap the plus sign to the right of each song you want to add to your on-the-go 
playlist. Repeat for each song you want to add.
10.	
Tap Done in the upper-right corner of the Songs screen. The On-The-Go 
screen appears again.
11.	
Tap Done at the top of the On-The-Go screen. 
Creating a Genius Playlist
If you like a particular song, you may also like similar songs recorded by other art-
ists. To help you find similar songs stored on your iPhone, you can create a Genius 
playlist. A Genius playlist lets you choose a song and then tries to identify similar 
songs. So if you picked a hip-hop song, the Genius playlist would look for similar 
songs and likely ignore love ballads or country music.

from the same album you have 
stored on your iPhone appears, as 
shown in Figure 20-14. Your iPhone 
now plays all songs starting from 
the current song all the way to the 
bottom of the album song list. 
Additional Ideas for 
Listening to Playlists
Playlists give you a convenient way to 
group related songs together, even if 
they have no apparent connection to 
anyone but you. You might think a tender 
ballad by Frank Sinatra fits in perfectly 
with a heavy metal song by Metallica, so 
why not add these two songs to the same 
playlist? In addition to creating your 
own playlists and listening to tunes from it, you can listen to songs from the same 
album. That way, you can hear the best songs from a particular album without 
wasting time listening to the boring stuff on the same album. 
Remember that songs can appear in more than one playlist. You can add 
the same song to one playlist of love songs and another playlist of songs you 
enjoy hearing while gardening. If you run out of ideas for how to group your songs 
together, let the Genius feature create playlists for you.
As a general rule, the larger your music collection gets, the more helpful 
you’ll find playlists for keeping everything organized. Everyone’s audio tastes can 
range dramatically, and it’s unlikely that you’ll want to listen to all your music all the 
time, so you can create playlists to accommodate your every mood. 
Figure 20-14: Tapping the play­
list icon displays all songs from 
that album.

Identify Music with Your 
iPhone
If you like a song you hear on 
the radio or over a speaker in a 
restaurant or store, you might 
want to buy that song to store 
on your iPhone. Unfortunately, 
if you don’t hear the name of 
a song or recording artist, you 
may never know how to find that 
song again.
Unless, of course, you get 
the Shazam app. The next time 
you hear a song you like, just 
place your iPhone next to the 
audio source and run Shazam. 
This app listens to the song 
and tries to identify the title 
and recording artist so you can 
buy that song from iTunes. In 
addition, the app also lists the 
recording artist’s discography 
so you can find other songs from 
that same artist. 
If you love music and are constantly hearing new songs that you like, let 
Shazam help you track down that song so you’ll always keep your music library 
fresh with new music.

Modifying Audio Output
Most people are happy with the ability to play music on their iPhone without 
dealing with bothersome obstacles or problems. However, some people are 
pure audio fanatics who appreciate the ways they can modify how their iPhone 
plays audio files:
>
>
Shake to Shuffle  Lets you choose the shuffle command just by shaking 
your iPhone
>
>
Sound Check  Lets you play songs recorded at different volume levels at 
nearly identical volume
>
>
EQ  Lets you define equalizer settings to adjust the different sounds in an 
audio file
>
>
Volume Limit  Lets you define a maximum volume limit for playing any 
audio files, keeping you or someone else from playing songs too loud and 
risking hearing loss
To modify one or more of these 
audio settings, do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap 
Settings. The Settings screen 
appears.
2.	
Scroll down and tap iPod. The

Additional Ideas for Customizing Your iPod 
Settings
If you want to make sure you or anyone else who uses your iPhone doesn’t suffer 
from hearing loss by playing music too loud, you can set the volume limit and lock 
it with a four-digit passcode. Of course, you could always help someone prevent 
hearing loss by taking away his or her iPhone altogether, but that’s probably not 
practical. 
Although the audio quality of the iPhone is perfectly fine for most people, 
you can experiment with the equalizer settings to make your iPhone sound even 
better. If you regularly plug your iPhone into a separate stereo or car radio adapter, 
you may need to experiment with different settings to get the best sound out of 
your iPhone in these listening environments.
Your iPhone may be a great music player, but with a little bit of tweaking on 
your part, it can be an even better music player that’s customized just for you. 
Listen to Relaxing 
Sounds on Your iPhone
Many people listen to music 
while studying. In case all of 
your music sounds more dis-
tracting than helpful when 
you’re trying to concentrate, 
try Binaural Beats. This app 
includes recordings of ocean 
waves, wind, and thunder-
storms. Just pick a sound, set a 
time limit, and listen to soothing 
background noise. 
Binaural Beats  http://www
.rockifone.com/
Binaural Beats can play relaxing 
background noise to help you 
sleep, concentrate, or soothe a 
headache.

No matter how much storage space is available 
on your iPhone, it’s probably not enough to 
store every possible song you might ever want 
to hear. Rather than switch to another iPhone 
with more storage capacity, you can download 
and install free apps on your iPhone that let the 
iPhone act like a radio, which means you can 
listen to a lot more music and other audio.
Although these apps won’t let you access 
all your local radio stations on your iPhone, 
as a real radio would, they will let your iPhone 
access streaming audio broadcasts over the 
Internet, essentially giving you free music or 
information from around the world. The only 
costs you incur are any Wi-Fi Internet and 
cellular telephone network connection fees. 
(Unfortunately, if you cannot connect to your 
cellular telephone company’s network or a 
Wi-Fi connection, you can’t listen to streaming 
audio.)

AOL Radio  Offers more than 200 radio stations, covering a wide variety of 
categories including comedy, classical, blues, rock, jazz, sports, pop, and talk 
radio
>
>
Pandora Radio  Allows you to enter a song or artist, then automatically 
plays music similar in style to your selection
>
>
Stitcher Radio  Lets you put together (stitch) your own radio channel from 
different stations offering news and talk radio content
Q
Q Note: AOL, Pandora, and Stitcher are not the only free radio apps you can

on songs or artists that you choose. You simply type the name of an artist, band, or 
song that you like into a Create a New Station field, and Pandora Radio plays music 
that is similar in style and sound. Type Beatles, and Pandora Radio will not only play 
various Beatles songs, but music from other artists that are similar to the Beatles.
Before you can use Pandora Radio, you need to set up a free account either 
through the Pandora Radio website (http://www.pandora.com/) or through your 
iPhone. After you’ve created an account and installed the application on your

Additional Ideas for Listening to the Radio 
on Your iPhone
AOL Radio is most useful when you want to browse different stations and listen to 
both music and news. One unique feature of AOL Radio is that it offers access to 
international music, so if you ever want to listen to your favorite Brazilian, African, 
or Japanese pop songs, turn on AOL Radio and satisfy your audio cravings.
If you live in a major city that Stitcher Radio supports, such as Boston, Chi-
cago, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, or San Francisco, Stitcher Radio can 
give you access to radio stations in those cities so that you can catch the latest 
traffic news.
By letting you listen to radio stations all over the world, your iPhone can be 
your constant companion at work and at home. Plug your iPhone into a power 
source, put on headphones or ear buds, and listen to the radio at your conve-
nience. With a good pair of noise-canceling headphones, you can listen to the 
radio on your iPhone at work and never hear your boss screaming at you for not 
getting anything done.
Find Your Favorite NPR 
Station
If you’re a fan of National Public 
Radio (NPR), grab a copy of 
the NPR Mobile app, and you’ll 
be able to find your local NPR 
station no matter what part 
of the country you may be in. 
Besides helping you track down 
a local NPR station, this app 
also lets you retrieve podcasts 
of past shows so you can hear 
your favorite NPR show at your 
convenience.

One way to keep yourself amused with your 
iPhone is by watching short video clips on 
YouTube. Since watching YouTube videos is 
such a popular pastime, Apple added a special 
YouTube app to the iPhone so you can access 
videos right away without having to load Safari 
and type the YouTube web address.
YouTube can be handy for watching old 
music videos, interesting news clips of planes 
or cars crashing, or homemade videos of 
people doing strange things or animals acting 
in bizarre ways. The video quality on YouTube 
may not always be the best, but the sheer 
quantity of material available gives you a vari-
ety of ways to entertain yourself.

Additional Ideas for Watching YouTube 
Videos
YouTube offers plenty of old music videos, both the official versions issued by the 
recording artists and tribute videos that individuals have created for their favorite 
songs. If you’re stuck somewhere and want to hear your favorite music, you can 
browse YouTube and watch music videos or clips from concerts.
YouTube is also a great place to watch trailers for movies about to be 
released as well as old favorites. If you’re thinking about renting a video, check out 
its trailer first, and if the trailer interests you, the movie might be worth watching. 
Or you might save yourself a few hours and a couple bucks if the trailer looks like 
a dud.
YouTube also offers clips of popular comedians, skits from amateur film­
makers, and videos of unusual events such as hurricanes ripping roofs off build-
ings, monkeys riding bicycles, or cars crashing into each other. 
People have also posted hundreds of educational and instructional videos, 
so if your idea of entertainment isn’t watching some guy get hit in the crotch, you 
can view yoga, martial arts, or how-to videos so you can learn something new.
Think of YouTube as a chaotic television channel that offers a wealth of video 
content if you have the time to dig and find it all. The next time you have a free 
moment waiting for an airplane or sitting in a doctor’s office, browse through You-
Tube and see what it offers. With YouTube and your iPhone, there’s no reason to be 
bored again—unless your iPhone’s battery runs out of power.

If you missed a movie or TV show episode 
in the old days, you’d be out of luck. If you took 
the time to record it (assuming you could figure 
out how to work your VCR or DVR), you could 
watch your favorite missed TV show or movie at 
your convenience. 
Now there’s another way to watch TV shows 
and movies: You can buy them from the iTunes 
Store and then download them to your iPhone. 
Now you can turn your iPhone into a portable 
TV screen and watch your favorite TV pro-
grams or the latest Hollywood blockbusters 
wherever you take your iPhone—whether on a 
long airplane ride or while waiting in line at a 
govern­ment office to fill out paperwork.

What You’ll Be Using
To watch TV shows and movies on your iPhone, you need to use the following:
iTunes (on your Mac or PC)
The Settings application
The iPhone USB cable
The iPod application
Downloading TV Shows and Movies
The fastest and most convenient way to download TV shows and movies is through 
a fast Internet connection using iTunes on your computer. Since TV shows and 
movies are stored in large files (such as 60 megabytes or more for TV shows and 
1 gigabyte or more for movies), downloading TV shows and movies directly to your 
iPhone is much slower, even when using a Wi-Fi connection.
To search for and download TV shows, movies, or music videos, do this:
1.	
Open iTunes on your computer.
2.	
Click iTunes Store under the Store category in the left pane of the iTunes 
window, as shown in Figure 24-1. 
Figure 24-1: The iTunes Store displays categories of products 
along with ads for the latest songs or videos.

4.	
Click the Buy button that appears to the right of the TV show or movie name 
to purchase it and download it to your computer.
Q
Q Note: After you’ve downloaded a video file to your computer, you’ll need to 
transfer it to your iPhone, as explained in Project 12.
Viewing a Video
After you’ve downloaded a show or 
movie to your iPhone, you’ll probably 
want to watch it eventually. To watch a 
show or movie, do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap iPod. 
The iPod screen appears.
2.	
Tap Videos at the bottom of the 
screen. The Videos screen appears, 
as shown in Figure 24-2. 
3.	
Tap a TV show or movie that you 
want to view. Your chosen TV show 
or movie appears sideways on your 
iPhone screen. You’ll need to rotate 
the iPhone to view it properly.
4.	
Tap the screen to display the video 
controls, as shown in Figure 24-3, 
and tap the play button to start 
playing the video.
Long videos, such as movies, are 
often divided into chapters. Chapters 
simply make it easier to jump to a differ-
ent part of the video without tediously 
rewinding or fast-forwarding through the 
entire video.

Once you have a video file stored in a compatible file format, you can down-
load it into iTunes by doing this:
1.	
Open iTunes on your computer.
2.	
Choose File4Add to Library. An Add to Library dialog appears, displaying 
folders and files.
3.	
Click the file you want to add to iTunes. (You may need to dig through differ-
ent folders to find the file you want.) After the file is loaded into iTunes, you 
can synchronize and transfer this video file to your iPhone by following the 
synchronization steps described in Project 12.
Additional Ideas for Watching TV Shows 
and Movies
You can buy movies for $9.99 and up (more for the latest releases) and TV show 
episodes for $1.99 and up. If you find a TV show that you really like, you can sub-
scribe to a whole season for a much lower cost than purchasing individual epi-
sodes. However, many networks release a single episode of popular or new TV 
shows for free. The hope is that people will watch the shows on their iPhone, get 
hooked, and either watch the shows on TV when they’re officially broadcast or buy 
more episodes through the iTunes Store. Movie studios also release free trailers of 
the latest movies so you can watch them and decide whether you want to see the 
whole movie. 
If you have a Macintosh, you can use the iMovie video editing program to 
create your own movies that you can store on your iPhone. Instead of storing still 
images of your loved ones, store videos so you can relive special moments in your 
life that no Hollywood production could possibly capture.
With the ability to download and view classic TV show episodes and movies 
or store and play your home movies, you can turn your iPhone into an entertain-
ment time machine that lets you relive the past through the wonders of old video, 
TV shows, and movies. Laugh at the strange clothes, poke fun at the dated hair-
dos, and then congratulate yourself for living in modern times, where everyone 
looks and acts cool—until you look back one day at these TV shows and movies 
to realize how silly we all really look in hindsight.

Watch Your Favorite TV Shows and Movie Trailers  
on Your iPhone
If you’ve missed your favorite CBS show, you can still catch up on the latest 
episodes by downloading the TV.com app. Developed by CBS, this app only 
lets you view select CBS shows and television schedules. 
For those more interested in movies, download Flixster and check out 
the latest DVD releases, currently playing movies, and upcoming movies. 
While you can’t watch entire movies through Flixster, you can peek at trailers 
and track the movies you want to see next (or avoid altogether).

Although nearly everyone enjoys listening to 
music on their iPhone, some people prefer 
using the iPhone’s audio-playing capabilities to 
expand their minds by listening to audiobooks 
and podcasts. 
An audiobook is a recording of someone 
reading a book. A podcast is often an audio 
recording of a radio show, TV show, or another 
spoken presentation that focuses on a par-
ticular topic, such as managing your money or 
stopping smoking. The next time you get tired 
of listening to music and want some audio vari-
ety, try listening to an audiobook or a podcast.
Project goal: Learn how to listen to audio-
books and podcasts on your iPhone.

Project 25
What You’ll Be Using
To listen to audiobooks and podcasts on your iPhone, you need to use the 
following:
iTunes (on your Mac or PC)
The iPod application
The iPhone USB cable
The iTunes application
Downloading Audiobooks and Podcasts
Audiobooks tend to be large files that can contain up to several hours’ worth of 
audio, so you can only download them to your iPhone from iTunes. Podcasts are 
usually much smaller, so you can download them directly to your iPhone or through 
iTunes. Some podcasts are strictly audio files, while others contain video as well.
Audiobooks almost always cost money to download. Depending on the 
book and the length of the audio file, an audiobook can cost as little as $1 or as 
much as $20 or more. Podcasts, on the other hand, are usually free to download, 
although you can purchase subscriptions to some podcasts for a minimal cost 
that’s usually much lower than the price of an audiobook.
Downloading in iTunes
To download an audiobook or podcast in iTunes, do this:
1.	
Open iTunes on your computer.
2.	
Click iTunes Store under the Store category in the left pane of the iTunes 
window, as shown in Figure 25-1. 
3.	
Click the Audiobooks or Podcasts category under the iTunes Store cat-
egory on the main screen. 
4.	
Click Genres and choose a genre from the pop-up window, click a category 
under the Categories section, or select an audiobook or podcast to down-
load by clicking its image in the middle pane.
5.	
After you’ve made a selection, a new screen appears with more information 
about the particular audiobook or podcast you selected. Click Buy Book to 
purchase the audiobook and download it to your computer. Click Subscribe 
to subscribe to a podcast and download episodes to your computer.
Q
Q Note: After you’ve downloaded an audiobook or podcast to your computer, 
you’ll need to transfer it to your iPhone, which is explained in Project 12.
You can find and download audiobooks in other places, such as 
Audible (http://www.audible.com/), AudioBooks (http://www.audiobooks.com/), 
Amazon.com (http://www.amazon.com/), and LibriVox (http://librivox.org/). LibriVox 
is particularly attractive, since this site focuses exclusively on free audiobooks.

Downloading Podcasts to Your 
iPhone
Most podcasts are part of a larger col-
lection of related podcasts, so when 
you download a podcast, you’re actu-
ally downloading a single episode of an 
ongoing show. For example, if you down-
load a podcast from ESPN, you’ll have 
a choice of downloading one of many 
podcasts all recorded by ESPN.
To download a podcast directly on

Additional Ideas for Listening to 
Audiobooks and Podcasts
If you want to listen to audio files other than music, you can start with podcasts, 
since most of them are free. Many radio and TV shows offer podcasts that let 
you enjoy the show even if you missed it when it first aired. Once you get used to 
listening to podcasts, you may want to graduate to audiobooks and listen to the 
latest best-sellers. Just remember that audiobooks usually cost money, while most 
podcasts are free. 
Audiobooks and podcasts can both entertain and educate you. Listen to the 
latest best-sellers, business or health tips, or amusing commentary from people 
all over the planet. With the right audiobook or podcast, you can either stimulate 
your brain or numb it through mindless entertainment.
Listen to an App 
Podcast on Your iPhone
One problem with the App 
Store is that there are so many 
apps available that you may not 
have time to dig through all the 
selections to find an app that 
you might need. To help you sift 
through the App Store, Jerad 
Hill offers an App Podcast that 
highlights a different app so you 
can learn what it does before 
wasting time downloading, 
installing, and trying it yourself.
To find Jerad Hill’s App 
Podcast, tap iTunes from the 
Home screen, then tap the 
Search icon at the bottom of 
the screen. Type Jerad Hill 
and you’ll see a list of App Pod-
cast episodes ready for you to 
download.

The iTunes Store is an online music store where 
you can search for your favorite recording art-
ists and songs and download music directly 
to your iPhone. When downloading videos, 
you’ll need to use a Wi-Fi connection for maxi-
mum speed, since downloading videos through 
a cellular phone network will be very slow. 
Ideally, you should download videos through 
your computer and then copy these videos 
to your iPhone. That way you’ll spend less time 
downloading video files and more time actually 
enjoying them.

What You’ll Be Using
To browse and download audio content from the iTunes Store, you need to use the 
following:
The iTunes application
Browsing Through iTunes 
The iTunes Store sells all types and genres of audio content, including rock, clas-
sical, jazz, country, hip-hop, spoken word, and comedy. When you find a song or 
audio clip that you want to download, you can buy it and download it directly to 
your iPhone. 
To help you navigate your way through this massive online library of songs, 
your iPhone provides several categories that can help narrow your search in finding 
music you enjoy:
>
>
Featured  Displays currently promoted songs, organized in three catego-
ries: New Releases, What’s Hot, and Genres
>
>
Top Tens  Offers the top ten songs in every genre, such as Pop and 
Alternative
>
>
Search  Lets you search for a song or recording artist by name
Viewing the Featured Category
The Featured category typically displays 
the latest or most popular songs. Most 
people find popular songs worth a listen, 
so by browsing the Featured category,

Additional Ideas for 
Browsing the iTunes 
Store
If you are squeamish about buying music 
from the iTunes Store, you can start by 
downloading free songs. Every Tuesday, 
Apple releases one to three songs for 
free as a way to entice people to start 
downloading songs and listening to dif-
ferent recording artists. When the next 
Tuesday rolls around, Apple releases a 
new batch of free songs, and the week’s 
previously free songs will then cost 
money to download.
To find a list of the currently free iTunes songs, use any search engine (such 
as Google) to search for free iTunes songs. Various websites keep track of the lat-
est free songs. Browse through this list, search for the free songs in the iTunes 
Store, and start building up your music collection for free while learning how to 
browse and download songs to your iPhone at the same time.
After you’ve downloaded audio files to your iPhone, you can synchronize 
your files to copy them on to your computer (see Project 12). As another alterna-
tive, you may find it convenient to browse and download audio files using iTunes 
on your computer and then synchronize your iPhone with your computer to trans-
fer newly downloaded audio files to your iPhone. As long as you synchronize your 
iPhone regularly with your computer, you can be sure that your music collection 
will always remain current, whether you’re at your computer or traveling with your 
iPhone.

for a song title or artist, you can

Browsing the 
Internet


27
Browsing the Internet is easy on a desktop or 
laptop computer, but on most mobile phones, 
finding and viewing different websites can be 
an exercise in frustration. Many mobile phones 
can’t display actual web pages; instead, they 
display simplified pages designed for small 
mobile phone screens.
Fortunately, the iPhone is different. Not 
only can you view web pages exactly as they 
appear on a regular computer, but you can eas-
ily select links simply by tapping them with your 
fingertip. On your iPhone, you’ll find that web 
browsing can be just as easy and fun as it is on 
a full-size computer.

Pages

Q
Q Note: The version of Safari on your iPhone can’t display Flash animations on 
websites. If you visit a website that uses Flash, you’ll see a blank space where 
a Flash animation should be playing.
Project goal: Learn how to view web pages on your iPhone. 
What You’ll Be Using
To browse the Internet with your iPhone, you need to use the following:
The Safari application
Connecting to the Internet
Your iPhone can connect to the Internet through a Wi-Fi network or through your 
cellular company’s network (see Project 31 for more on connecting to Wi-Fi). Con-
necting through a Wi-Fi network is much faster than connecting through your cell 
phone service. The one significant drawback to Wi-Fi is that you must be within 
range of a Wi-Fi network to use it, and you may need to enter a password to access 
that network. If the Wi-Fi network to which you’re trying to connect isn’t yours and 
it’s protected by a password you don’t know, you won’t be able to connect.
When you attempt to connect to the Internet, your iPhone always tries to 
connect to a Wi-Fi network first. If your iPhone can’t connect through a Wi-Fi net-
work, it can still connect through your cellular telephone network. The advantage 
of connecting with your cell service is 
that you’ll be able to access the Internet 
while riding in your car or walking down 
the street, as long as you can get cell 
coverage. The drawback is that surfing 
the Internet through the cellular network 
can be painfully slow. 
To connect to a Wi-Fi network, 
do this: 
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Safari. 
The Safari screen appears. If you’re 
within range of multiple Wi-Fi net-
works, a dialog appears, listing all 
available Wi-Fi networks, as shown 
in Figure 27-1. 
2.	
A lock icon next to a Wi-Fi name 
means you need to enter a pass-
word to access that network. If a 
lock icon does not appear, you can 
access that network without typing 
a password. The signal strength 
is represented by the radio signal 
Figure 27-1: You can access a 
Wi-Fi network by tapping its 
name.

	
Viewing Web Pages 	 |	 217
icon. The stronger the signal, the more shaded bars will appear. Generally, 
the closer you are to a Wi-Fi router, the stronger the signal. A weak Wi-Fi 
signal can be unpredictable and may cut you off suddenly.
3.	
Tap the Wi-Fi network you want to access. If you need a password, a dialog 
will appear, asking you to enter the password.
Viewing a Website
You can visit a website in two ways. You can enter its address (such as http://www
.nostarch.com/) and go directly to the site, but this method can be clumsy, espe-
cially if the address is long. Alternatively, you can enter a word or phrase in the 
search field, and when a list of websites appears on the search engine page, you 
can tap the site you want to visit. This method is handier when you want to visit 
a website but don’t know its actual address (or URL, which stands for Uniform 
Resource Locator). Most likely, you’ll wind up using both methods to find websites.
Entering a Website Address
If you know the exact URL of a website that you want to visit, you can use the virtual 
keyboard to enter its address by doing this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Safari. The Safari screen appears, as shown in 
Figure 27-2. 
2.	
Tap the address text box on the left side of the title bar. A virtual keyboard 
appears, as shown in Figure 27-3.

lets you access websites.

(Optional) Tap the clear button (the 
X in a gray circle) to the right of the 
address field to clear any text dis-
played there.
4.	
Type an address in the address 
text box. 
Q
Q Note: You can save time by skipping 
the http://www part of the address 
and starting with the actual website 
name itself—such as nostarch.com.
5.	
Tap Go. Safari displays the website.
Q
Q Note: If you hold your finger on the 
.com button, the virtual keyboard 
displays a list of other common URL 
domains, such as .org and .net, as 
shown in Figure 27-4.
Using a Search Engine
If you don’t know the exact address for a 
website, you can often find it through a 
search engine. To use a search engine, 
follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Safari. 
The Safari screen appears. 
2.	
Tap the search text box (to the right 
of the address text box). A virtual 
keyboard appears (see Figure 27-3).
3.	
(Optional) Tap the clear button (the 
X in a gray circle) to the right of the 
search text box to clear any previ-
ous search.
4.	
Type a word or phrase in the search 
text box. As you type, your iPhone 
displays previous search terms 
you have typed, as shown in Fig-
ure 27-5. You can tap a displayed 
search term or finish typing in a 
different word or phrase.
5.	
Tap Google. Safari displays your 
search results.

Tap the link for the website you 
want to visit.

Changing How Your iPhone Displays Web 
Pages
No matter how you view a web page, you may still find the iPhone’s tiny screen too 
small to read comfortably. To solve this problem, the iPhone offers two solutions 
that you can use alone or together:
>
>
Rotate your iPhone sideways, and the currently displayed web page rotates 
to show more of it, as shown in Figure 27-6.
>
>
Pinch two fingers on the screen and then spread them apart to zoom in. 
Close the two fingers on the screen to zoom out.
Opening and Switching Between Multiple 
Websites
On a regular computer, you can use a browser such as Safari to open multiple web-
sites and quickly switch between them. You can do the same on your iPhone, but 
the process is slightly different. Instead of displaying multiple web pages as tabs, 
your iPhone displays multiple web pages as thumbnail images. You tap a thumb-
nail image to switch between sites.
To open and view multiple web pages, do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Safari. The Safari 
screen appears. 
2.	
Tap the New Page icon (the two little screens) 
in the lower-right corner of the Safari screen, as 
shown in Figure 27-7.

You can think of the iPhone as a miniature computer in your pocket (or purse) that 
can connect to the Internet from almost anywhere. If you’re inside your favorite 
electronics store, pull out your iPhone, browse the Internet, and check the store’s 
prices compared to prices for the same items online. If you’re stuck in line some-
where, pull out your iPhone and browse through your favorite news websites to 
catch up on the latest headlines and pass the time.
With few exceptions, browsing the Internet on the iPhone is nearly identical 
to browsing the Internet on a normal computer. With the Internet available from 
your iPhone, you can view the world’s information at your fingertips. It’s up to you 
to decide what you need and what you’re going to do once you have the informa-
tion you want.

Use Your iPhone to Search Google with Voice Commands
Browsing the Internet on the iPhone is no different than browsing the Internet 
on a normal computer. To take full advantage of the iPhone, Google offers its 
Google Mobile App, which lets you search using your voice. Just load the app, 
say a word or phrase, and this app searches for your spoken phrase through 
Google. Now you can search the Internet without typing anything at all.

Voice Search lets you search Google just by speaking into your 
iPhone.

Almost everyone has a list of favorite websites 
to visit. While you could memorize and type 
the web address of each website whenever you 
want to see it, it’s much simpler to save your 
favorite web addresses as bookmarks. 
When you bookmark a site, you can quickly 
jump to that site just by tapping its bookmark. 
To help you get started, your iPhone comes 
with a bookmark list of popular websites such 
as Yahoo! and Apple. You can add your own 
favorites to this list to create your own custom 
bookmarks. 
Project goal: Learn how to bookmark web-
sites on your iPhone.

Q
Q Note: If you already have a set of bookmarks on your home computer, you 
can easily sync them to your iPhone instead of tediously re-entering each one. 
See Project 12 for instructions on how to sync your bookmarks between the 
iPhone and Internet Explorer or Safari.
What You’ll Be Using
To bookmark websites on your iPhone, you need to use the following:
The Safari application
Viewing a Bookmarked Website
For your convenience, your iPhone 
includes a list of popular websites that 
have already been bookmarked for you 
(you can modify this list if you want). To 
view a bookmarked site, do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Safari. 
The Safari screen appears. 
2.	
Tap the Bookmarks icon (the open 
book symbol) at the bottom of 
the screen. The Bookmarks screen 
appears, as shown in Figure 28-1.
3.	
Tap a bookmark, such as Yahoo! or 
Apple. Its website appears on the 
screen.
Q
Q Note: A bookmark folder appears in 
the Bookmarks screen with a right-
pointing arrow next to it. Tapping a 
bookmark folder displays a submenu 
of bookmarked websites.
Saving a Bookmark
When you run across a particularly interesting website that you think you will want 
to revisit, you can save it as a bookmark and store it in your bookmark list or as an 
icon on the Home screen. 
Adding a Bookmark to the Bookmark List
The bookmark list is usually the easiest place to store a link to a favorite website. 
To add a bookmark to the list, do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Safari. The Safari screen appears. 
Figure 28-1: The Bookmarks 
screen lists current bookmarks.

2.	
Open a website by typing its address or searching for it in the search 
text box.
3.	
Tap the plus sign at the bottom of the screen. Four options appear, as shown 
in Figure 28-2.
4.	
Tap Add Bookmark. An Add Bookmark screen appears, as shown in Fig-
ure 28-3, where you can enter a descriptive name for your bookmark and 
choose a place to store it.
5.	
Type a descriptive name for your bookmark.
6.	
Tap Bookmarks. A screen appears, displaying several folders where you can 
store your bookmark.
7.	
Tap the folder where you want to store your bookmark. The Add Bookmark 
screen appears again (see Figure 28-3). 
8.	
Tap Save. Now you can visit this website again by tapping the Bookmarks 
icon at the bottom of the screen and then tapping the site’s bookmark.
Adding a Bookmark to the Home Screen
Saving a website as a bookmark can help you quickly find that site whenever 
you want to revisit it. But if you visit a site often (such as Amazon.com or eBay, 
for example), you might want to save a link to that website as an icon directly on 
your Home screen. Adding a bookmark to the Home screen gives you immediate 
access to a website just by tapping its icon; no need to open Safari first.
Figure 28-2: You can choose 
where you want to store a 
bookmark.
Figure 28-3: The Add Bookmark 
screen lets you type a name 
and choose a location for your 
bookmark.

play a bookmark icon on the Home 
screen titled Apple - iPhone.
Q
Q Note: To remove a bookmark icon from the Home screen, hold your finger 
on the icon until a close button appears in the upper-left corner. This causes 
all icons on your Home screen to jiggle. Tap the close button, and when the 
Delete Icon dialog appears asking if you want to delete this icon, tap Delete, 
and then press the Home button to stop all your icons from jiggling.
Emailing a Website Link
You can share a website with a friend by emailing your friend a link to that site.
Q
Q Note: To email a website link, you’ll first need to set up an email account, as 
explained in Project 32.
To email a website link, do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Safari. The Safari screen appears. 
2.	
Tap the plus sign at the bottom of the screen.

If you want to save a website address, 
you’ll have to bookmark it.
Organizing 
Bookmarks
After a while, you may save so many 
bookmarks that it becomes difficult to 
find the one you want. To solve this book-
mark clutter problem, you can delete 
bookmarks you no longer need or reor-
ganize related bookmarks into folders.
Deleting Bookmarks
The simplest way to organize your book-
marks is to delete those you no longer 
need. To delete a bookmark, do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Safari. 
The Safari screen appears. 
2.	
Tap the Bookmarks icon. The 
Bookmarks screen appears (see 
Figure 28-1).
3.	
Tap Edit in the lower-left corner of 
the screen. Red circles with white 
dashes appear to the left of all your 
bookmarks.
4.	
Tap the red circle next to a book-
mark you want to delete. A red 
Delete button appears to the 
right of the bookmark, as shown 
in Figure 28-6.

Tap Done in the lower-left corner of the screen.
7.	
Tap Done in the upper-right corner of the screen to display the Safari screen 
again.
Creating Bookmark Folders
You can organize bookmarks by grouping related websites into folders. For exam-
ple, you might create a folder that contains bookmarks to news sites and another 
with bookmarks to your favorite funny cat or skiing sites. 
Before you can store bookmarks in folders, you’ll first need to create a folder. 
To create a folder, do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Safari. 
The Safari screen appears. 
2.	
Tap the Bookmarks icon. The 
Bookmarks screen appears (see 
Figure 28-1).
3.	
Tap Edit in the lower-left corner of 
the screen. A New Folder button 
appears in the lower-right corner of 
the screen.
4.	
Tap New Folder. The Edit Folder 
screen appears, as shown in 
Figure 28-7.
5.	
Type a descriptive name for your 
folder in the Title field.
6.	
Tap Bookmarks. The Bookmarks 
screen appears.
7.	
Tap the location where you want to 
store your folder.
8.	
Tap Bookmarks in the upper-left 
corner of the screen. The Book-
marks screen displays your newly 
created folder.

Rearranging Bookmarks and 
Moving Bookmarks to Another 
Folder
After you have stored a bookmark in a 
folder, you can rearrange it or move it to 
another folder later. (However, you can-
not rearrange or move bookmarks that 
are not inside a folder.) To move a folder, 
do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Safari. 
The Safari screen appears. 
2.	
Tap the Bookmarks icon. The 
Bookmarks screen appears (see 
Figure 28-1).
3.	
Tap a folder that contains the 
bookmark you want to rearrange or 
move. The screen lists all the book-
marks in the selected folder.
4.	
Tap Edit in the lower-left corner of 
the screen. A minus sign in a red 
circle appears to the left of each 
bookmark, and three horizontal 
bars appear to the right of each 
bookmark, as shown in Figure 28-8.
5.	
(Optional) Place your fingertip on 
the three horizontal bars to the 
right of a bookmark, and then slide 
your finger up or down to change 
the location of the bookmark in the 
list. Lift your finger to drop the 
bookmark at its new location.
6.	
Tap a bookmark. The Edit Book-
mark screen appears, as shown in 
Figure 28-9.

Press the Home button to return to 
the Home screen.
Q
Q NOTE: If you’ve synchronized your 
bookmarks from your computer to 
your iPhone, you may see two folders: 
Bookmarks Menu and Bookmarks Bar. 
These simply refer to the folder names 
of the bookmarks stored on your com­
puter. Your iPhone will not display 
bookmarks in drop-down menus or 
as toolbar icons as a browser does on 
a standard computer.
Revisiting Previously Viewed Websites
Have you ever wanted to revisit a website, but you didn’t bother to bookmark it? 
To help you find previously visited websites, Safari automatically tracks your visited 
websites in a special History list. This essentially bookmarks every website you’ve 
visited recently. To access this list and revisit your favorite websites, do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Safari. The Safari screen appears. 
2.	
Tap the Bookmarks icon. The Bookmarks screen appears (see Figure 28-1).
Figure 28-10: The Bookmarks 
screen displays all available 
bookmark folders.

Tap History at the top of the 
screen. The History screen 
appears, as shown in Figure 28-11.
4.	
Tap a bookmark. Safari reloads 
that website. (You may need to tap 
a folder to open a list of sites that 
you visited on a particular date.)
Additional Ideas for 
Saving Bookmarks
Unless you have a photographic memory 
and don’t mind doing a lot of extra 
typing, you should take some time to 
bookmark your favorite sites. Turn your 
favorite bookmarks into icons on the 
Home screen, and you’ll always have fast, 
one-tap access to the sites you visit most 
often. Store links to less frequently vis-
ited sites as ordinary bookmarks so you 
won’t forget them.
For fun, create a folder to store the 
silliest websites you can find. Then when 
you need a laugh with your friends, let 
them browse through these silly sites. 
How about starting with these?

Bookmarks can be time savers (or time wasters, depending on which sites 
you bookmark), so go ahead and browse the Internet, save your favorite sites, and 
visit them often so that you won’t have to do any actual work during the day.

Use Your iPhone to 
Save Web Clips
Ordinary bookmarks are nice 
for storing addresses to entire 
web pages, but if you only want 
to save part of a web page, such 
as images or text, you should 
use the Evernote app. To use 
this app, you’ll need to set up an 
account, but then you’ll be able 
to clip text and pictures from 
web pages or anything else on 
your screen that you want to 
save.
More remarkable is that 
Evernote can actually identify 
text stored in images, so, for 
example, you can take pictures 
of signs and search for the text 
captured in the image. Evernote 
also offers free desktop ver-
sions of the program for PC and 
Macintosh, so you’ll be able to 
synchronize your iPhone notes 
with notes on your computer 
and vice versa.
If you find bookmarks too limiting, try Evernote and start clipping and 
saving only the information you really want to save. If you save part of a web 
page, Evernote is even smart enough to store the web page’s address so you 
can find and view that information again.
Evernote  http://evernote.com/
Evernote lets you clip and store 
text or graphic images.

Many people are happy to use Safari just the 
way it comes on their iPhone. However, not 
everyone will want to accept these default set-
tings. Fortunately, you can customize Safari to 
make it work exactly the way you want. 
You might want to customize Safari for 
personal reasons. Perhaps you prefer using a 
search engine other than Google. You might 
also want to customize Safari for added secu-
rity. If you don’t like the idea of websites 
tracking your activity through cookies, you 
might want to turn this feature off.
Whatever your reasons for customizing 
Safari, you’ll be happy to know you have plenty 
of settings you can change to make it work 
exactly the way you want.

Turning AutoFill On and Off
Many websites require you to log in with your name or email address and a pass-
word. Since typing this information repeatedly using the virtual keyboard can get 
tiresome and clumsy, Safari offers an AutoFill feature, which can store and enter 
this information for you. To turn the AutoFill feature on or off, do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap 
Settings. The Settings screen 
appears.

login forms and re-enter it on sub-
sequent web page visits.

(Optional) Tap the Clear All but-
ton to clear all stored names and 
passwords.
Securing Safari
Although your iPhone is currently safe from most online security risks, that proba-
bly won’t be true forever, as some hackers like to play with and distribute malicious 
code. To protect your iPhone from websites that contain malicious code that can 
be downloaded on your iPhone, you can turn off various features; unfortunately, 
doing so will probably make browsing less enjoyable. Some of the features you can 
turn on and off include the following:
>
>
Fraud Warning  Lets Safari warn you when you might visit malicious sites 
attempting to masquerade as legitimate ones
>
>
JavaScript  Used to create interactive web pages
>
>
Plug-ins  Used to play video and audio
Figure 29-3: The AutoFill screen 
lets you choose the data you 
want Safari to automatically 
enter.

236	 |	
Project 29
>
>
Pop-ups  Used to display pop-up ads or additional website content
>
>
Cookies  Used to store information that identifies you to a particular 
website
Fraud Warning can detect sites that may be trying to trick you into typing in 
your password by mimicking a bank or other trusted website. Hackers set up these 
fraudulent websites and then send an email to millions of people, telling them that 
their account has been compromised and they need to type their password into a 
new security site. This “security site” then captures people’s passwords or credit 
card information.
JavaScript is a simple programming language used on websites to offer 
interactive games or menus. Turning off JavaScript on your iPhone can make Safari 
run faster, but at the expense of some websites’ features, because they will not be 
able to display some interactive options. Try turning off JavaScript and see how it 
affects the websites you visit the most. If you don’t notice any difference, you can 
leave JavaScript turned off for good.
Plug-ins are programs that add features to Safari, such as the ability to play 
audio or video files stored on a website. Disabling this feature can speed up your 
web browsing, but it prevents you from seeing all the content on some websites. 
Blocking pop-ups can keep websites from opening additional web pages 
that show ads, which can slow down your web-browsing experience. Unless you 
like being bombarded with ads, you’ll probably want to keep the Block pop-up 
feature turned on.
There are three options for allowing cookies: Never, From visited, and 
Always. If you choose the Never option, websites won’t be able to identify you or 
track your browsing history. This might prevent you from shopping online (but is 
that a bad thing?), and it will likely prevent sites such as Amazon.com from display-
ing a list of recommended books for you. I’ll leave it up to you to decide whether 
this is a good or a bad thing.
If you choose the From visited option, Safari will store cookies only from sites 
that you visit. If you choose the Always option, Safari can store cookies from sites 
you haven’t even visited. (In general, there are very few reasons to choose the 
Always option.)
To turn these features on or off, do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings screen appears. 
2.	
Tap Safari. The Safari screen appears (see Figure 29-1).
3.

Press the Home button. 
Clearing Your Tracks
Every time you browse the Internet, you 
leave behind traces of where you’ve been 
in your web history; these are called 
cookies, and they are saved in a cache. 
(This is not unique to the iPhone; it’s the 
case with most web browsers.)
The iPhone’s history list stores 
a list of all the websites you’ve visited. 
The cookies list stores cookies on your 
iPhone left by sites you’ve visited. (You 
might think of these as breadcrumbs that 
you’ve left behind, except that each one 
has identifying information on it. Sites 
such as Amazon.com store cookies so they can recognize you when you revisit the 
site.) The cache stores bits and pieces of visited websites, so the next time you visit 
that site, your iPhone can retrieve part of the web page from its cache, which can 
make the web page load faster.
The problem with storing this sort of history information on your iPhone is 
that anyone who has access to your iPhone can examine your browsing habits. If 
this bothers you, take some time to wipe out your browsing records by doing the 
following:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings screen appears. 
2.	
Tap Safari. The Safari screen appears (see Figure 29-1).
3.	
Tap one or more of the following buttons: Clear History, Clear Cookies, or 
Clear Cache. A dialog pops up, asking if you really want to clear the chosen 
option.
4.	
Tap your choice (such as Clear Cookies), or tap Cancel if you change your 
mind.
5.	
Press the Home button.

Additional Ideas for Modifying Safari
For most people, Safari’s default settings work perfectly fine. Still, if you just don’t 
like the way Safari works, or if you like digging into the guts of a program to find 
ways to tweak it, feel free to dig into these customization settings. 
While changing the default search engine to Google or Yahoo! may be a 
matter of personal preference, changing the other settings in Safari can speed up 
your web browsing and protect your privacy. If someone manages to peek at your 
iPhone without your permission, he or she could open Safari and see all the web-
sites you’ve visited. 
If you give your iPhone away, make sure you clear out your history and 
cache settings. Otherwise, someone else can visit the websites you’ve browsed 
and use the cookies stored on your iPhone to impersonate you on a website such 
as Amazon.com. (Of course, this works the other way around, too, so if you can 
grab your boss’s iPhone, you can blackmail him based on websites that he’s been 
visiting.)
Whatever your reasons for customizing Safari, you can modify a lot of set-
tings, a few, or none at all. Safari works perfectly fine on its own, but with a little 
customization, you can make it work exactly the way you want it to.
Browse the Internet 
Privately on Your 
iPhone
The Safari browser works fine 
for surfing the Internet on your 
iPhone, but if you value your 
privacy, you may get tired of 
clearing out its cache and cook-
ies periodically. To avoid this 
problem, try browsing with the 
Privately app. Unlike Safari, Pri-
vately never stores any data in a 
cache or in cookies, so you can 
safely browse the Internet anon-
ymously without leaving a trail 
behind that others can follow. 
Privately  http://www
.saxorama.net/
The Privately browser lets you 
browse the Internet without 
storing any personal data.

When you’re using your computer, you can visit 
your favorite web page, copy some text from it, 
and then paste that text into an email or word 
processor file. Since this can be a handy way 
to share or save interesting information you 
find on the Internet, you may want to copy text 
from web pages that you view on your iPhone, 
as well.
By copying chunks of text from a web page 
and pasting the text into another app, you won’t 
have to bother bookmarking an entire site. (To 
learn more about copying, cutting, and pasting 
text, see Project 4.)

Copying Text from a Web Page
Copying text from a web page involves three steps. First, you need to find a web 
page that contains text. (You can’t copy graphics.) Second, you need to select and 
copy a chunk of text. Third, you need to 
paste that text into another app, such as 
Notes or Mail.
To copy text, do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Safari. 
The Safari screen appears.
2.	
Navigate to a web page that con-
tains text that you want to copy.
3.	
Press and hold your fingertip over 
the text you want to copy. Your 
iPhone highlights the entire para-
graph, as shown in Figure 30-1. 
(You may need to wait until a web 
page completely loads before you 
can select text.)
4.	
(Optional) Drag one of the handles 
(the round dots) surrounding the 
selected text to select more or less 
text.
5.	
Tap the Copy button that appears 
next to the selected text.
Pasting Text 
After you have copied text from a web page, you can paste it into any app that 
allows text, such as the Notes or Mail apps. Just like a computer, your iPhone 
stores copied text in memory called the Clipboard. Once you have a chunk of 
Figure 30-1: Holding your fin-
gertip over text selects that 
chunk of text.

copied text stored on the clipboard, you 
can keep pasting that text as many times 
as you want. But the moment you copy 
something new to the Clipboard, your 
old copied text is erased for good.
To paste text you’ve copied from a 
web page, do this:
1.	
Make sure you have copied text 
from a web page.

Additional Ideas for Copying Text From a 
Web Page
If you copy text from a web page and store it in the Notes app, you can keep track 
of interesting tidbits of information that you might find handy in the future. If you 
copy and paste text into the Mail app, you can send off useful information to oth-
ers without forcing them to access a website link and then hunt around for the text 
you wanted them to see. If you’re only copying a short chunk of text, you can even 
send it as a text message. 
Copying text from a web page and pasting it in another app lets you keep 
track of useful information without the hassle of saving an entire website as a 
bookmark. 
With a little research and a lot of copying and pasting, you could gather 
enough notes to write a term paper or report on your regular computer. Now you 
have no excuse for not getting any work done, as long as you have an Internet con-
nection and your iPhone.

You can happily browse the Internet with your 
iPhone through your cellular phone company’s 
network, but doing so may be slow. For faster 
Internet access, latch onto a Wi-Fi network if 
one is in range. Many public places, such as 
airports and coffeehouses, now offer Wi-Fi as 
a free service, and there’s a good chance that 
you may also have a Wi-Fi connection at home 
(or you may be in range of an altruistic neigh-
bor’s network). When you’re using Wi-Fi, you’ll 
enjoy higher speeds than you’re likely to get 
from your cell phone network.

What You’ll Be Using
To set up a Wi-Fi connection with your iPhone, you need to use the following:
The Settings application
Configuring an iPhone to Work with a 
Private Wi-Fi Connection
Wi-Fi networks are either public or private. A public network is free for anyone 
to access without a password; these are common in coffee shops and libraries. 
However, private, password-protected networks are also common these days. 
To access a secure Wi-Fi network, you need to know and enter the password, as 
shown in Figure 31-1. 
To configure your iPhone to connect to a private Wi-Fi network (such as your 
home Wi-Fi network), do this: 
1.	
From the Home Screen, tap Settings. The Settings screen appears.
2.	
Tap Wi-Fi. The Wi-Fi Networks screen appears, as shown in Figure 31-2.
3.	
Tap the ON/OFF button next to Wi-Fi to turn it on. (If you turn this option 
off, you won’t be able to access any Wi-Fi networks.)
4.	
(Optional) Tap the ON/OFF button next to Ask to Join Networks to turn it on 
or off. When it’s turned on, a dialog will pop up asking if you want to connect 
Figure 31-1: Before accessing a

your iPhone should be able to connect to this particular Wi-Fi network in the 
future without your having to reenter the password.
Choosing Between Multiple Wi-Fi Networks
When your iPhone detects multiple Wi-Fi connections, it displays a Select a Wi-Fi 
Network dialog so you can choose the Wi-Fi network you want to use, as shown in 
Figure 31-6.
If you’re currently connected to a Wi-Fi network but you want to switch to 
another one, you can choose another Wi-Fi connection by doing this:
1.	
From the Home Screen, tap Settings. The Settings screen appears.
2.	
Tap Wi-Fi. The Wi-Fi Networks screen appears, listing available Wi-Fi net-
works from which you can choose, as shown in Figure 31-7.
3.	
Tap the Wi-Fi network you want. If a lock icon appears next to the network 
name, you’ll have to type a password to access that network.

Forgetting a 
Wi-Fi Network 
If you find your iPhone trying to latch 
on to a Wi-Fi network that you don’t 
want to use, you can stop this by mak-
ing it “forget” that particular network. 
That way, your iPhone will skip that net-
work and try to latch on to another one 
instead. 
To ”forget” a Wi-Fi network, do 
this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap 
Settings. The Settings screen 
appears.
2.	
Tap Wi-Fi. The Wi-Fi screen 
appears. 
3.	
Tap the white arrow inside the blue 
circle that appears to the right of 
the network you want your iPhone 
to forget. The network screen 
appears, as shown in Figure 31-8.
4.	
Tap Forget this Network. A red 
Forget Network button and a Cancel button appear at the bottom of the 
screen. 
5.	
Tap the red Forget this Network button, and then press the Home button 
to return to the Home screen.
Deleting Wi-Fi Network Information
If you decide to give away or sell your iPhone to somebody else, guess what? If 
you’ve configured your iPhone to connect to a private Wi-Fi network, your network 
settings will still be stored in your iPhone, which means that person can access 
those private networks. Since you may not want to give another person access to 
a private Wi-Fi network, you’ll need to wipe out your network settings by resetting 
them and reconfiguring the settings to the factory settings. 
To reset your network settings, do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings screen appears.
2.	
Tap General. The General screen appears. 
3.	
Scroll down and tap Reset at the bottom of the screen. A Reset screen 
appears, as shown in Figure 31-9.
4.	
Tap Reset Network Settings. A dialog appears, telling you that your choice 
will delete your current network settings, as shown in Figure 31-10.

Tap Reset Network Settings. Your iPhone should restart, at which point 
you’ll have to reconfigure your iPhone’s Wi-Fi settings if you want to connect 
to a private Wi-Fi network.
Additional Ideas for Connecting to a Wi-Fi 
Network
Even if you don’t have a Wi-Fi network of your own, you might as well take a few 
moments to learn how to configure a Wi-Fi network on your iPhone. This informa-
tion can be handy later when you do need to connect to a private Wi-Fi network at 
work or at home.
A Wi-Fi network gives you faster Internet access for browsing web pages, 
viewing YouTube videos, or downloading apps from the App Store. In general, 
you’ll want to use a Wi-Fi network for greater speed and rely on your cell phone 
company’s network only if Wi-Fi is unavailable. By knowing how to configure a 
Wi-Fi connection and switch between connections, you’ll be able to keep your 
iPhone connected to the Internet wherever you go.

Part 6
Using Email


32
The iPhone is all about staying in touch with 
people, via phone calls or text messaging, 
for example. One of the most popular ways 
to communicate with others is through email 
messages. 
You can send and receive email messages 
from your existing email accounts using your 
iPhone, but before you’ll be able to do so, you’ll 
need to configure your email account to work 
with your iPhone. 
You can set up any type of email account to 
work with your iPhone. However, your iPhone 
already knows how to connect to the following 
types of email accounts, so they’re the easiest 
to set up:

Q
Q Note: If you need to set up an email account that iPhone doesn’t already 
support, you may need to find your Post Office Protocol (POP) or Internet 
Message Access Protocol (IMAP) server names. If that confuses you, ask your 
Internet/email service provider for help.
Project goal: Set up your email account so that you can access it from your 
iPhone using your email address and your account password.
What You’ll Be Using
To set up an email account on your iPhone, you need to use the following:

Additional Ideas for Setting Up Email 
Accounts
You can set up as many email accounts to work with your iPhone as you wish, such 
as a personal email account and a work account. Of course, if you create too many 
email accounts, you’ll have a hard time keeping them all organized, but at least you 
can boast how important you are by linking your iPhone to multiple email accounts 
at once. You can also create and access multiple email accounts with different 
services, such as Gmail or Yahoo! Mail. 
Why would you want to use multiple personal accounts? Well, if one account 
starts getting overrun by spam, you can kill that account, create a new one, and 
switch to using the new account. (Of course, you’ll probably want to let your friends 
know when you make the change. Or maybe not.) With the ability to create and use 
multiple email accounts, you’ll no longer have a reason not to communicate with 
people—unless you really just can’t stand them. 
Figure 32-5: A typical email 
account screen

33
With your iPhone, you can access your email 
no matter where you are. The next time you’re 
expecting a message from a friend, loved one, 
or co-worker, you don’t have to wait until you 
get back to your computer. Once you’ve set 
up an email account with your iPhone, you can 
start reading email messages right away, as 
long as you’re within range of a Wi-Fi network 
or cellular phone network. 
Project goal: Learn how to read email on 
your iPhone. 
Reading 
Email

Project 33
What You’ll Be Using
To learn how to read email with your iPhone, you need to use the following:
The Mail application
The Settings application
Reading a Message
Every email account consists of multiple 
folders, as shown in Figure 33-1:
>
>
Inbox  Contains new messages
>
>
Drafts  Contains outgoing mes-
sages until you’re ready to send 
them
>
>
Sent Mail  Contains copies of 
messages you’ve sent
>
>
Trash  Contains deleted mes-
sages that you can still read and 
retrieve if necessary, until you 
empty your trash
To read individual messages, you 
need to choose the email account, the 
folder, and the specific message that you 
want to read. 
Choosing an Email Account
Since you can set up multiple email 
accounts on your iPhone, you may need 
to choose which email account to use by 
doing this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Mail. 
The number of unread email mes-
sages appears as a white number 
inside a red circle at the upper-
right corner of the Mail icon at the 
bottom of the screen, as shown in 
Figure 33-2.

(Optional) If a specific email 
account screen appears (see 
Figure 33-1), tap Accounts in the 
upper-left corner of the screen. The 
Accounts screen appears, as shown 
in Figure 33-3.
3.	
Tap the account you want to use.
Choosing a Folder and a 
Message
Once you’ve selected an email account, 
your next step is to select a folder (most 
likely the Inbox folder) and a message in 
that folder to read. To read an email mes-
sage, do this:
1.	
Follow the steps in the section 
“Choosing an Email Account” on 
page 256 to display the folders of an 
account.
2.	
Tap a folder, such as the Inbox 
folder. A list of stored messages 
appears, as shown in Figure 33-4.
3.	
Tap a message that you want to 
read. The message appears on the 
screen. 
Viewing File Attachments
Many people send files attached to an 
email message. If you receive a message 
with a file attachment, a paper clip icon 
appears next to the sender’s name (see 
Figure 33-4). Unlike a regular computer, 
your iPhone can open and display only 
a limited number of file types, including 
Microsoft Word and Excel files, text files, 
PDF (Adobe Acrobat) files, and HTML 
(web) files. 
Figure 33-3: The Accounts 
screen displays all the email 
accounts set up on the iPhone.
Figure 33-4: Each folder can 
contain multiple messages.

Project 33
Since file attachments can be large, your iPhone won’t waste time download-
ing them until you specifically ask it to do so. To view a file attachment, do this:
1.	
Follow the steps in the section “Choosing a Folder and a Message” on page 
257 to display a list of messages in an account.
2.	
Tap a message that contains a file attachment (a message that displays 
the paper clip icon next to the sender’s name). The message appears with 
a downward-pointing arrow icon that represents your file attachment, as 
shown in Figure 33-5.
3.	
Tap the file attachment icion to download it. After the file is downloaded, the 
file attachment icon changes its appearance, as shown in Figure 33-6.
4.	
Tap the file attachment icon to display it. You may need to scroll up and 
down to view the contents of the entire file. To view the original message 
that came with the file attachment, tap Message in the upper-left corner 
of the screen.

Email Messages
When you’re viewing a message on 
the screen, you’ll see up and down 
arrows in the upper-right corner and 
an Inbox button in the upper-left 
corner, as shown in Figure 33-7.
After displaying a message, 
you can choose from among several 
options to view other messages:

To return to your list of mes-
sages, tap Inbox.
>
>
To view the previous message, 
tap the up arrow.
>
>
To view the next message, tap 
the down arrow.
Deleting a Message
When you delete a message, your 
iPhone stores the deleted message 
in a special Trash folder, which allows 
you to view that message again or 
move it out of the Trash folder to 
retrieve it. To delete messages per-
manently, delete them from the Trash 
folder.
Sending a Message to the Trash Folder
To delete a message stored in another folder, such as the Inbox folder, and send it 
to the Trash folder, do this:
1.	
Follow the steps in the section “Choosing an Email Account” on page 256 to 
display the folders of your email account.
2.	
Tap a folder, such as the Inbox folder. A list of messages stored in that folder 
appears (see Figure 33-4).
3.	
Tap the message you want to delete. The Trash icon appears at the bottom 
of the screen (see Figure 33-7). 
4.	
Tap the Trash icon. The message disappears from the folder and is moved to 
the Trash folder.

Emptying the Trash 
After you send unwanted messages to the Trash folder, they’ll just pile up like a 
wastebasket that nobody has bothered to empty. That means all your unwanted 
messages are still gobbling up space, so you’ll need to clean out this Trash folder 
periodically. To delete a message for good, you must empty the Trash by doing 
this:
1.	
Follow the steps in the section “Choosing an Email Account” on page 256 to 
display the folders for an account.
2.	
Tap Trash. A list of deleted messages appears.
3.	
Tap a message that you want to delete permanently.
4.	
Tap the Trash icon to delete the message.
Moving a Message
You can move messages from one folder to another, such as between the Trash 
folder and your Inbox folder, to retrieve a previously deleted message.
To move a message between fold-
ers, do this:
1.	
Follow the steps in the section 
“Choosing an Email Account” on 
page 256 to display the folders of an 
email account.
2.	
Tap a folder (such as the Trash 
folder) that contains the message 
you want to move. A list of mes-
sages appears.

Defining How Often Messages Are 
Retrieved 
You can access email in two ways: Push and Fetch. The Push option works only for 
certain email accounts, such as MobileMe or Gmail, where the service tries to send 
new messages to your iPhone as soon as it receives them without your having to 
do anything. When messages are pushed to your phone, you should receive and 
be able to read messages within seconds after they’re sent to you (theoretically).
The Fetch option works the way most email works, by periodically checking 
your email account for new messages. Because Fetch checks only periodically, 
such as every 15 minutes, the time delay 
between receiving a new message and 
it actually appearing on your iPhone 
can vary from a few seconds to several 
minutes, depending on the setting. The 
shorter you set this time interval, the 
more frequently your iPhone will check 
for email. (More frequent checking can 
slow things down on your phone, so you 
might try different settings to see which 
works best.)
To define how fast your iPhone will 
retrieve email data, do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap 
Settings. The Settings screen 
appears. 
2.	
Tap Mail, Contacts, Calendars. 
The Mail, Contacts, Calendars 
screen appears.
3.

Additional Ideas for Reading Your Email
Reading email can be fun, especially when you receive messages from people you 
like. If you like receiving email, but you’re not receiving enough messages, sign 
up for Google Alerts (http://www.google.com/alerts) or Yahoo! Alerts (http://alerts
.yahoo.com). Both free services can send you email messages containing the latest 
news on any topic that you choose. You can fill up your Inbox with all sorts of infor-
mation almost instantly, if that’s what you would like.
Whether you enjoy tracking the latest sports, technology, or entertainment 
news, set up a Google or Yahoo! Alert and you’ll be assured of receiving a steady 
supply of useful email messages every day. With an Inbox folder crammed full of 
messages, you’ll always have interesting reading material, or just a bunch of time-
wasters, to peruse whenever you have a free moment during the day. But do try to 
avoid that spam.

Reading email from friends, loved ones, and 
co-workers is nice, but you’ll eventually want to 
respond to some of those messages. You can 
type email messages and send them directly 
from your iPhone so you can stay in touch with 
others whether you’re at home, on the road, or 
stuck in traffic somewhere around town.

What You’ll Be Using
To learn how to write and send email on your iPhone, you need to use the 
following:
The Settings application
The Contacts application
The Mail application
The Photos application
Configuring Settings for the Mail 
Application
When writing email messages, you may want to configure two additional settings 
for the Mail program:
>
>
Signature  This setting displays text at the end of your message, such as 
your company name and motto. You can also choose not to display the “Sent 
from my iPhone” signature.
>
>
Default Account  This setting defines the email account to use when send-
ing email from a program other than the Mail program, such as the Contacts 
program.
To modify these settings, do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap 
Settings. The Settings screen 
appears. 
2.	
Tap Mail, Contacts, Calendars. 
The Mail, Contacts, Calendars 
screen appears, as shown in 
Figure 34-1.
3.	
Tap Signature. A Signature screen 
appears, as shown in Figure 34-2.
4.	
Type or edit the text using the vir-
tual keyboard, and then tap Mail in 
the upper-left corner of the screen 
to return to the Mail, Contacts, 
Calendars screen.
Q
Q Note: Signatures are a great place to 
put the address for your personal or 
company’s website. Every message 
you send will act like a free advertise-
ment for your site.

Tap the email account you want to 
set as the default account. This will 
be the email address that all your 
messages will come from.
7.	
Press the Home button to return to 
the Home screen. 
Writing a New 
Message
A new message lets you initiate email 
contact with a person. To create a new 
email message, you can use the Mail 
program or the Contacts program.
The Mail program is useful for typ-
ing an email address to send your mes-
sage to. The Contacts program is useful 
if you’ve already stored an email address 
and don’t feel like typing it again.
Writing a Message from the 
Mail Application
The Mail program lets you either type 
an email address or retrieve an email 
address from the Contacts program. To 
use the Mail program to write and send a 
message, do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap 
Mail. The Mail screen appears. 
(If you have set up multiple email 
accounts, you may first need to 
select which account to use.) The 
New Message icon, which looks 
like a slip of paper with a pencil, 
appears in the lower-right corner of 
the screen, as shown in Figure 34-3.
Figure 34-2: The Signature 
screen displays text that 
appears at the end of every 
message you send.

person’s saved email address 
automatically.)
4.	
Tap in the Subject text box and 
type a subject for your message.
5.	
When you’re done typing your 
message, tap Send in the upper-
right corner of the screen.
Writing a Message from the 
Contacts Application
If you want to send a message to some-
one whose contact information is stored 
in your Contacts program, it’s much 
easier to use that person’s saved email 
address than type it in yourself. You can do this directly from the Contacts pro-
gram. To send a message to a contact stored in your Contacts program, do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Contacts. The Contacts screen appears. 
2.	
Tap a name that contains an email address of a person to which you want 
to send your message. An Info screen appears, listing that person’s contact 
information.
3.	
Tap the email address to which you want to send your message. A New Mes-
sage screen appears (see Figure 34-4) with the recipient’s email address 
already added.
4.	
Tap in the Subject text box and type a subject for your message.

already added to the To text box, a subject already added to the Subject 
text box, and the contents of the old message in the Message text box so 
the recipient can view the message to which you are replying. (If you tap 
Forward, you’ll need to add an email address in the To text box.)
6.	
Tap Send when you’re done typing your message.

Working with Drafts
Sometimes you may start writing a message and need to stop to do something 
else. Rather than wiping out your partial message and starting all over again later, 
you can save your message in the Drafts folder. Then you can leisurely complete 
your email and send it when you’re ready.
Storing a Message in the Drafts Folder
The Drafts folder is meant to store all draft messages until you’re ready to send 
them. To store a message in the Drafts folder, do this:
1.	
Create an email message by tap-
ping the New Message icon in 
the lower-right corner of the Mail 
screen. Or, to reply to or forward 
an existing message, tap the reply 
icon and then tap the Reply or 
Forward button.
2.	
Tap Cancel in the upper-left corner 
of the screen. Save, Don’t Save, 
and Cancel buttons appear at the 
bottom of the screen, as shown in 
Figure 34-7.
3.	
Tap Save to store your message in 
the Drafts folder. To edit it again, 
you’ll need to open the Drafts 
folder and tap this message. 
4.	
(Optional) Tap Don’t Save to 
delete and discard the message. 
5.	
(Optional) Tap Cancel to return to 
your message in the Drafts folder 
so you can continue typing.
Sending a Message from the 
Drafts Folder
After you’ve saved an email message in the Drafts folder, you can always go back 
when you’re ready to finish writing it. To send a message from the Drafts folder, do 
this:
1.	
Open the Drafts folder that contains the email message you want to send. A 
list of messages stored in the Drafts folder appears.
2.	
Tap the email message that you want to send. The message appears on the 
screen.
3.	
(Optional) Make changes to your message.
4.	
Tap Send in the upper-right corner of the screen.

Deleting a Message from the 
Drafts Folder
Sometimes you may store a message in 
the Drafts folder and then decide that 
you don’t want to send it after all. To 
delete a message from the Drafts folder, 
do this:
1.	
Open the Drafts folder that con-
tains the message you want to 
delete. A list of messages stored in 
the Drafts folder appears.
2.	
Tap Edit in the upper-right cor-
ner of the screen. Radio buttons 
appear to the left of each message, 
and a red Delete button appears at 
the bottom of the screen.

message(s) you want to delete. A 
checkmark appears in each of the 
selected radio buttons, as shown in 
Figure 34-8.
4.	
Tap Delete. (If you tap Move, you’ll 
be able to select a folder and move 
your messages there.)
Sending a Photo
In a regular email program on a com-
puter, you can attach all sorts of files to 
your messages, such as word processor 
documents, videos, and audio files. With 
the iPhone, the only file attachments you 
can send are pictures. To send a picture, 
do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap 
Photos. The Photo Albums screen 
appears. 
2.	
Select a photo album and then 
scroll through your pictures until 
you see one that you want to send.

Additional Ideas for Writing and Sending 
Email
If you often write and send messages to the same people, take a moment to store 
their email addresses in the Contacts program. That way, you can spare yourself 
typing each person’s email address every time you want to send him or her a mes-
sage. If you’d rather not use the Contacts program, just reply to your messages 
and let your iPhone add the recipient’s email address automatically. 
If you want to promote your business or your contact information, you can 
modify your signature. Add your name, your company name, and your website 
address, or add a funny saying that you want to share with everyone who reads 
your email messages. Since the email messages you write can express your creativ-
ity, let your imagination run wild and create a signature that uniquely reflects your 
personality.
By storing messages in the Drafts folder, you can take your time writing mes-
sages so you can say exactly what you mean without feeling rushed, or you can 
go back and spell check your email message to get rid of typos and grammatical 
errors.


Part 7
Business Stuff

Have you ever had a great idea and couldn’t 
find a pen and paper so you could write it 
down? Too often, we promise ourselves we’ll 
jot down our wonderful ideas as soon as we 
can—and then the whole day goes by and 
we’ve not only forgotten to write down our 
ideas, but we’ve forgotten what they were in 
the first place.
To capture your thoughts as soon as they 
occur, you can type them into the Notes pro-
gram on your iPhone. Not only will this let you 
save your ideas immediately, but it also ensures 
that you’ll be able to find and read them instead 
of trying to decipher hasty scribbles on a nap-
kin or a scrap of paper that happened to be 
convenient at the time.
Project goal: Learn how to type, save, and 
find notes stored on your iPhone.

What You’ll Be Using
To type, save, and find notes on your iPhone, you need to use the following:
The Notes application
Typing a Note
The Notes program acts like a simple word processor that lets you type a note and 
save it. To create and save a note, do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Notes. The Notes screen appears. 
2.	
Tap the plus sign in the upper-right corner of the screen. The virtual 
keyboard appears at the bottom of the New Note screen, as shown in 
Figure 35-1.
3.	
Type your note text. When you’re finished, tap Done. The Notes screen 
appears again, briefly displaying a few words from each of your saved notes, 
as shown in Figure 35-2.
Figure 35-1: The virtual key-

Viewing and Editing a 
Note
After you’ve typed and stored one or 
more notes on your iPhone, you can view 
and edit them at any time by doing this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Notes. 
The Notes screen appears, show-
ing each note on a separate line 
(see Figure 35-2).
2.	
Tap a note, and it appears, along 
with four icons (Previous Note,

at the bottom of the screen, as 
shown in Figure 35-3. 
3.	
(Optional) Tap the Previous Note 
or Next Note icon to view a dif-
ferent note. (If either icon appears 
dimmed, that means you are 
already viewing the first or last 
note.)
4.	
(Optional) Tap your note if you 
want to edit it or type new text. 
The virtual keyboard appears at the 
bottom of the screen. 
5.	
Tap Done when you’re finished 
viewing and editing a note.

Deleting a Note
Notes are handy for storing information you need for a while, such as a shopping 
list. Eventually, you’ll probably want to delete most of your notes when you don’t 
need them anymore. To delete a note, do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Notes. The Notes screen appears with a list of 
all your notes.
2.	
Tap the note you want to delete. The note appears and displays four icons 
(Previous Note, Email Note, Trash, and Next Note) at the bottom of the

Emailing a Note
Sometimes you may write a note that you 
want to send to someone else, such as 
a cool business idea. Rather than retype 
your note into an email message, you 
can send your note directly as an email 
message. To do this, you must have first 
set up an email account to work with your 
iPhone (see Project 32). Then do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Notes. 
The Notes screen appears, listing 
all of your saved notes.
2.	
Tap the note you want to email. 
Your chosen note appears on the 
screen. 
3.	
Tap the Email Note icon. An 
email screen appears, displaying 
your note as the text in an email 
message. 
4.	
Tap the To field. A virtual keyboard 
appears at the bottom of the 
screen, as shown in Figure 35-5.
5.	
Type an email address in the To 
text box. (If you tap the plus sign 
that appears at the far right of the 
To text box, you can access your 
Contacts list of names and email 
addresses.)

7.	
Tap Send to send your note in an email.
Using Phone Numbers and Email Addresses 
in a Note
If you type a phone number or email address, Notes is smart enough to recognize 
it as such and underline it. If you tap an underlined phone number, your iPhone 
gives you the option to call that number. If you tap an underlined email address, 
your iPhone displays a New Message screen with the email address already in the 
To text box.
To see how to dial a phone number 
and send an email from Notes, do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Notes. 
The Notes screen appears.
2.	
Tap the plus sign in the upper-right 
corner of the screen. The virtual 
keyboard appears at the bot-
tom of the New Note screen (see 
Figure 35-1).
3.	
Type your note text. Make sure you 
include a real phone number and 
email address. When you’re fin-
ished, tap Done. (Notice that after 
you tap Done, the phone number 
and email address both appear 
underlined.)
4.	
Tap the phone number. A dialog 
appears, asking if you want to Can-
cel or Call that number, as shown in 
Figure 35-6.
5.	
Tap Cancel or Call. If you tap Call, 
your iPhone dials your selected 
number.
6.	
Tap the underlined email address in your note. A New Message screen 
appears. (Notice that it contains the email address already typed into the To 
text box.) Now you can type a message and tap Send to send the email or 
tap Cancel to discard it.

Additional Ideas for Using Notes
Notes can be handy for jotting down ideas and keeping track of your thoughts. 
Keep your iPhone with you, and when you have an idea, make a note of it before 
you forget. You can also use a note to remind yourself of things you need to do, or 
to help you remember your grocery list. Carry your iPhone so you can review your 
list at the store.
Type positive affirmations or goals into a note, and whenever you have a 
spare moment, take out your iPhone and review your affirmations or goals. This 
can help you stay focused on what you want to achieve and spare you the bore-
dom of being stuck someplace, such as waiting in line, where you can’t do any-
thing productive.
If you want to transfer your notes to your computer, just email them to your-
self. When you open that email message on your computer, your note will appear 
as ordinary text that you can copy and paste into another program, such as a word 
processor. 
Notes can safely store your thoughts so you’ll always be able to find them 
again. You’ll never risk losing a good idea—unless, of course, you lose your iPhone.
Use Your iPhone to 
Sketch Your Ideas
The Notes app is great for jot-
ting down ideas by typing on 
the virtual keyboard. However, 
if you prefer jotting down ideas 
by scribbling on a napkin, you 
might prefer Napkin Genius 
Lite. This app lets you draw on 
your iPhone’s screen and save 
your images as a picture file, 
much like drawing on a napkin. 
Now you can capture your ideas 
in visual form.
Napkin Genius Lite  http://
www.atomicpowered.net/
iphone/napkingeniuslite
Napkin Genius Lite lets you 
sketch your ideas.

If you are suddenly struck with inspiration, you 
could type your thoughts into the Notes app to 
store them in print. But inspiration isn’t always 
convenient—you may be busy driving and don’t 
want to take the time to type out your ideas. 
As an alternative to the Notes app, use the 
Voice Memos app, which lets you turn your 
iPhone into a digital audio recorder. Now if you 
have anything that you want to remember, you 
don’t have to waste time typing it. Just speak it 
into your iPhone, and store your information as 
an audio file that you can play back later. 
This makes it handy to save telephone num-
bers, email addresses, or just random thoughts 
by recording them. After you record your ideas, 
you can even email the audio file or send it as a 
multimedia message (see Project 16).

Editing a Memo
If you tend to take a while getting to your 
point when you’re talking, you might 
want to edit your voice memos after you 
record them. You can either cut a memo 
from the beginning or the end—you can-
not cut out chunks of your memo from 
the middle. 
Besides trimming a voice memo, 
you can also give it a unique label or 
name such as Podcast, Idea, or Lecture. 
That way you can easily identify what 
content your voice memo contains.
To trim the beginning or end of a 
voice memo and give it a label, do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap the 
Voice Memos icon. The Voice 
Memos screen appears.
2.	
Tap the button that appears in the 
bottom-right corner of the screen. 
The Voice Memos screen appears, 
listing all your recorded memos 
(see Figure 36-2).
3.	
Tap the arrow button that appears 
to the far right of the voice memo 
you want to edit. An Info screen 
appears, as shown in Figure 36-7.
4.	
Tap the Trim Memo button. A 
slider appears along with a Trim 
Voice Memo button at the bottom 
of the screen.
5.	
Place your finger at the beginning 
or end of the slider (on the three 
vertical lines), and drag your finger 
left or right to trim the beginning 
or end of your voice memo, as 
shown in Figure 36-8.
6.	
Lift your fingertip off the screen 
when you’re happy with the amount 
of time you’ve trimmed from your 
voice memo. 
7.	
(Optional) Tap the play button that 
appears to the left of the slider to 
hear your trimmed voice memo.

voice memo was recorded. A Label 
screen appears, listing ways you 
can label your voice memo, as 
shown in Figure 36-9. 
10.	
Tap a label such as Memo or 
Interview. (If you tap Custom at 
the bottom of the screen, you can 
use the virtual keyboard to type 
your own label.)
Deleting a Memo
Eventually, you’ll probably want to delete 
some voice memos to avoid cluttering 
your iPhone with old recordings. You can 
do that by following these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap the 
Voice Memos icon. The Voice 
Memos screen appears.
2.	
Tap the button that appears in the 
bottom-right corner of the screen. 
The Voice Memos screen appears, 
listing all your recorded memos 
(see Figure 36-2).
3.	
Tap the voice memo that you 
want to delete. A red Delete but-
ton appears at the bottom of the 
screen (see Figure 36-4).
4.	
Tap the red Delete button. A 
red Delete Voice Memo button 
appears at the bottom of the 
screen, as shown in Figure 36-10.
5.	
Tap the Delete Voice Memo but-
ton (or tap the Cancel button if 
you’ve changed your mind).
Figure 36-9: The Label screen 
lets you give your voice memo a 
descriptive name.

Additional Ideas for Recording Voice 
Memos
Voice Memos can be handy for capturing your own thoughts or the voices of oth-
ers. Instead of writing down somebody’s phone number or email address, just ask 
that person to tell you and record it in a voice memo. Then you can listen to that 
information later! 
If you’re attending a class or a meeting, use your iPhone to record a lecture 
or a presentation so you can replay it and review it later. If you get stopped by the 
police, record your interactions with them. That way, you’ll have a record of every-
thing you said to the police officers and what they said back to you. 
Rather than clutter your iPhone with voice memos, send them to yourself by 
email, download them to your computer, and then delete them from your iPhone. 
Your computer probably has far more storage space than your iPhone. 
The next time you go to the grocery store, record your shopping list as a 
voice memo. Then you can listen to your list to make sure you never forget to 
buy milk or eggs. With the Voice Memos app, you can throw away your old audio 
recorder and use your iPhone instead.

Unless you’re a hermit, you probably need to 
contact certain people occasionally, such as 
friends, family members, co-workers, and busi-
ness associates. You could try memorizing each 
person’s contact information—name, address, 
email address, and phone number—but a 
much simpler solution is to store this informa-
tion in your iPhone so you can find it any time 
you need it.
To store contact information, you can use 
the Contacts program, which acts like a simple 
database, similar to a Rolodex of business 
cards. After you’ve stored important contact 
information, you’ll be able to send email, make 
a phone call, or send a text message just by 
tapping a person’s name. You can even attach 
a picture of each person so you’ll never forget a 
face.

information on your iPhone.

Information

Project 37
What You’ll Be Using
To store contact information on your iPhone, you need to use the following:
The Contacts application
The iPhone USB cable
The Settings application
Importing Contact Data from Other 
Programs
If you have contact information stored in another program (such as a database pro-
gram on Windows or Mac OS X), or you’ve stored information on a mobile phone 
such as a BlackBerry or Windows Mobile device, you can transfer that data to your 
iPhone, but it may take a few extra steps. Fortunately, you’ll only have to do this 
once, so here’s the basic idea of how it works.
To transfer contact data trapped on another mobile phone, you must first 
synchronize the data with your ordinary database program on your computer (such 
as Microsoft Outlook). After all your data is current in your computer database 
program, you’ll have to export all the data to one of four types of files:
>
>
vCard  A standard file format for storing business card data
>
>
LDIF  Lightweight Data Interchange Format, a format for storing individual 
pieces of data
>
>
Tab-delimited  A text file in which data is separated by tabs
>
>
Comma-separated values (CSV)  A text file in which data is separated by 
commas
Most contact database programs, such as Microsoft Entourage and Out-
look, can export data in either the vCard or LDIF format. Other databases or 
spreadsheets, such as FileMaker, MS Excel, or MS Access, can export data as tab-
delimited or CSV files. 
After you’ve exported your data from a database program, your next step is 
to import that data into the Address Book (Mac OS X) or Outlook (Windows). From 
here, you can sync your data with your iPhone by connecting your iPhone to your 
computer with your USB cable and using iTunes (see Project 12).
If your data is trapped in your old mobile phone, such as a BlackBerry, Palm, 
or Windows Mobile device, you can spare yourself much hassle by getting a pro-
gram called The Missing Sync for iPhone (http://www.markspace.com/). Not only 
will The Missing Sync program transfer your contact information, but it will transfer 
photographs and appointment information, as well. 
If your contact information is stored in Google Contacts, you can synchro-
nize the data using the Google Sync for iPhone program (http://www.google.com/
mobile/apple/sync.html).

	
Storing Contact Information	
|	 293
Storing Names and Other Information
The Contacts program relies on you to add information. In addition to adding a 
person’s name, you can also add his or her street address, phone number, email 
address, website address, and a variety of other contact information you might 
need. You can store different information about each person, such as the name 
and phone number of one person and the name and email address of another 
person.
The basic idea behind any database, such as the Contacts program, is that it 
provides blank areas, called fields, where you can store data. The following fields 
are included in the Contacts program:
>
>
Add new Phone  Add a person’s phone number and label it as mobile, 
work, home, or another description—if someone calls you from a phone 
number that you’ve stored in the Contacts program, your iPhone will display 
that person’s name on the screen.
>
>
Ringtone  Define a unique ringtone to play when a particular person 
calls you.
>
>
Add new Email  Store a contact’s work, home, or other type of email 
address.
>
>
Add new URL  Store a contact’s 
personal, work, or other type of 
website address.
>
>
Add new Address  Store a con-
tact’s home or work street address.
>
>
Add Field  Add unique informa-
tion about a person, such as a 
birthday, a nickname, or a phonetic 
pronunciation of his or her name.
To add a name and contact infor-
mation to your iPhone, do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap 
Contacts. (You may need to scroll 
to the second pane to find the 
Contacts icon.) The All Contacts 
screen appears, as shown in Fig-
ure 37-1. (If you haven’t stored any 
names, the All Contacts screen will 
be blank.)
Figure 37-1: The All Contacts 
screen displays a list of saved 
contact names.

2.	
Tap the plus sign in the upper-right corner of the screen. The New Contact 
screen appears, as shown in Figure 37-2.
3.	
Tap First Last. The Edit Name screen appears, where you can type a per-
son’s first and last name and company, as shown in Figure 37-3.
4.	
Type a first and last name and a company name, if appropriate. Then tap 
Save. The New Contact screen appears again (see Figure 37-2).
5.	
Tap a button to add new contact information, such as Add new Phone, Add 
new Email, or Add new Address. An Edit screen appears, where you can 
type information using the virtual keyboard. For example, if you tap Add new 
Phone, the Edit Phone screen appears, as shown in Figure 37-4. Tap Save 
after you’ve entered the new contact information, and you’ll see the New 
Contact screen. Repeat this step for each new chunk of information you want 
to add about a person.
6.	
 (Optional) In the New Contact screen, tap Add Photo. Two buttons appear 
near the bottom of the screen, as shown in Figure 37-5. Tap Take Photo, 
and you can take a person’s picture with your iPhone camera. Tap Choose 
Existing Photo to select a stored picture that will appear next to a person’s 
name.
7.	
Tap Save. The Contact screen displays your newly added name.

Finding a Contact
The simplest way to find a name in the Contacts program is to scroll down the list 
of stored contacts. If you’ve stored a small number of contacts, this can be accept-
able, but if you’ve stored dozens of names, scrolling to find one can be too time 
consuming. Instead of scrolling, you can search alphabetically or search by typing 
all or part of a name.
Searching Alphabetically
The right side of the All Contacts screen displays the alphabet from A to Z. If you 
know a person’s last name, you can search for that name by doing this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Contacts. The All Contacts screen appears.
2.	
Tap the letter on the right side of the screen that corresponds to the last 
name of the contact you want to find. For example, if you want to find some-
body whose last name begins with an S, tap the letter S. All contacts whose 
last names begin with the chosen letter appear on the screen. 
3.	
Scroll up or down until you find the name you want.
4.	
Tap the name to view the person’s contact information.
Figure 37-4: In the Edit Phone 
screen, you can type a phone 
number and choose a label for 
that number.
Figure 37-5: You can take a 
picture or choose an existing 
image to add to your contact 
information.

296	 |	
Project 37
Searching by Text
Another way to search for a contact is to 
type all or part of the person’s name or 
company name. To search by typing text, 
do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap 
Contacts. The All Contacts screen 
appears.
2.	
Tap the search text box. A virtual 
keyboard appears.
3.	
Type a partial contact or com-
pany name. As you type, a list of 
matching names appears above 
the virtual keyboard, as shown in 
Figure 37-6.
4.	
Tap the name to view the person’s 
contact information.
Editing Contacts
After you’ve stored a name and contact 
information, you can edit that informa-
tion later by changing it or adding new 
information. To edit contact information, 
do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap 
Contacts. The All Contacts screen 
appears.
2.	
Tap the name of the contact 
you want to edit. An Info screen 
appears, listing all your stored 
information.
3.	
Tap Edit. Two types of circles 
appear to the left of various fields, 
allowing you to add or edit infor-
mation, as shown in Figure 37-7. 
4.	
(Optional) Tap the white minus sign 
inside a red circle that appears next 
to saved information. A Delete but-
ton appears; tap Delete to delete 
the currently saved data.

(Optional) Tap the white plus sign inside a green circle next to a field. The 
green circle means you haven’t stored data in this particular field. A new 
screen appears, where you can type information to save.
6.	
Tap Done when you’re finished adding or deleting information. Tap All 
Contacts in the upper-left corner of the screen to view the Contacts screen 
again.
Sharing Contacts
Chances are good that you have a phone number and address for someone stored 
on your iPhone that someone else wants to have. While you could read this infor-
mation aloud and let the other person type it into their mobile phone, this method 
is slow, tedious, and prone to error. To make things easier, you can send contact 
information in an email or MMS message.
To share contact information, 
do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap 
Contacts. The All Contacts screen 
appears.
2.	
Tap the name of the contact whose 
information you want to share. An 
Info screen appears, listing all your 
stored information for that person.
3.	
Tap Share Contact. (You may need 
to scroll down to find this option 
on the screen.) Email, MMS, and 
Cancel buttons appear, as shown 
in Figure 37-8.
4.	
Tap Email or MMS. If you tap 
Email, you’ll need to choose an 
email address to send the informa-
tion to. If you tap MMS, you’ll need 
to choose a mobile phone num-
ber to send the information to.
Deleting Contacts
Rather than delete individual fields for a stored contact name, you might want to 
delete an entire contact altogether. To delete a contact name and all information 
saved with that name, do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Contacts. The All Contacts screen appears.
2.	
Tap the name of the contact you want to delete. An Info screen appears, list-
ing all your stored information.
Figure 37-8: You can share con-
tact information by sending it in 
an email or MSS.

3.	
Tap Edit in the upper-right corner of the screen.
4.	
Scroll down until you see the red Delete Contact button at the bottom of the 
screen, as shown in Figure 37-9. 
5.	
Tap Delete Contact. Another Delete Contact button and a Cancel button 
appear, as shown in Figure 37-10. 
6.	
Tap Delete Contact to delete the information (or tap Cancel if you’ve 
changed your mind). The All Contacts screen appears, and the deleted name 
is nowhere in sight. 
Customizing the Contacts Application
By default, the Contacts program displays each contact’s first name followed 
by the last name. However, you can switch this order if you want. When sorting 
names, the Contacts program sorts according to the contact’s last name followed 
by the first name. If you’d rather sort by first name, you can switch this around, too. 
The sort order determines how your iPhone arranges names. So if you 
choose Last, First as your sort order, all your names appear sorted alphabetically 
by last name.
The display order determines how your iPhone actually displays names. So 
if you choose Last, First as your display order, all your names appear with the last 
name first such as Smith, John. 
Figure 37-9: The Delete Contact 
button appears at the bottom 
of the Info screen.

delete the contact or cancel the 
action if you’ve changed your 
mind.

Additional Ideas for Storing Contacts on 
Your iPhone
Everyone can think of friends and family members whose contact information can 
be saved in the Contacts program, but another handy use for the Contacts data-
base is to store crucial information, such as toll-free numbers you need to call if 
Figure 37-11: The Contacts 
options allow you to change the 
sort and display orders of con-
tact names.
Figure 37-12: The Sort Order 
screen lets you define how to 
sort contact names.

Project 37
your credit cards are stolen, or your insurance company’s name and phone number 
and policy numbers so you can find this information quickly if you need to file a 
claim. 
If you’re not careful, the Contacts program can soon become as cluttered 
as most people’s closets, so it’s a good idea to take time periodically to weed out 
unnecessary contact names. That way, you can save only important names and 
get rid of people you’ll never contact again in a million years (such as some of your 
relatives).
Use Your iPhone 
to Store Contact 
Information from 
Business Cards 
Typing in someone’s contact 
information can be painfully 
slow, especially if you try to type 
it directly in your iPhone using 
the virtual keyboard. For a faster 
way, use the CardLasso app.
Just take a picture of 
a business card using your 
iPhone’s built-in camera, upload 
the picture to CardLasso, and 
you’ll receive the contact infor-
mation in a spreadsheet or email 
format so you can easily import 
it into your Contacts database.
You’ll need to pay a 
monthly fee that varies, depend-
ing on how many business cards 
you need to store each month. 
But the cost is minimal, espe-
cially if you’d rather not spend 
your time typing in data from 
business cards.
CardLasso  http://www.lasso2go.com/
CardLasso lets you take pictures 
of business cards to store that 
information.

Everyone needs to be in different places at 
specific times, but it’s often too easy to for-
get crucial appointments, especially when you 
start getting overwhelmed by all your work and 
personal commitments. To help you stay orga-
nized and on time, the iPhone offers a Calendar 
application. 
The Calendar application lets you store 
your appointments in a single location and pro-
vides reminders to alert you when a specific 
appointment is coming up. By using automatic 
calendar alerts, you can ensure that you’ll never 
miss a crucial appointment again (unless you 
really want to).

What You’ll Be Using
To save, view, and edit appointment information on your iPhone, you need to use 
the following:
The Calendar application
Importing Appointment Data from Other 
Programs
If you’ve been using a computer or another mobile phone to keep track of your 
appointments, you’ve already stored appointment information there. If you haven’t 
stored too much information, you might find it easy to retype it into your iPhone’s 
Calendar application. However, if you have dozens of stored appointments, retyp-
ing all this information would probably be too much trouble. Fortunately, there is a 
simple solution. 
Your iPhone syncs with iCal or Entourage (Mac OS X) or Outlook (Windows). 
If you want to synchronize data with a different program, you may need to get 
special synchronization software that works with your program. Whatever program 
you’ve used to store current appointments, the data can be exported to a comma-
separated values (CSV) file and then imported into iCal or Outlook. From there, 
you can sync your data with your iPhone by connecting your iPhone to your com-
puter with your USB cable and using iTunes (see Project 12).
If your appointment data is trapped on another mobile phone, buy The Miss-
ing Sync for iPhone (http://www.markspace.com/) and make your life easier. If you 
use Google, you can synchronize your Google calendar information using the free 
Google Sync for iPhone program (http://www.google.com/mobile/apple/sync.html).
Setting an Appointment
Every appointment involves a time and a location. In addition to defining a start-
ing time, you can also define an ending time and indicate whether you want your 
iPhone to alert you ahead of time and whether you want to schedule the appoint-
ment to repeat at particular times.
To create an appointment, do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Calendar. If you have already created appoint-
ments, they’ll be listed in the Calendars screen, as shown in Figure 38-1, 
which shows how appointments look in the list view. If you haven’t created 
any appointments, this screen will be blank.

type separate appointment information for every instance of a recurring appoint-
ment, the Calendar program lets you type recurring appointment information 
once and specify how often you want that appointment to repeat.
You can define a recurring appointment when you first create the appoint-
ment, or you can edit an existing appointment and turn it into a recurring one. To 
edit an appointment to make it a recurring appointment, do this:

Additional Ideas for 
Storing Appointments on Your iPhone
In addition to storing obvious appointments, such as doctor’s appointments, Little 
League practices, or hot dates, you can use the Calendar program as a reminder 
system to help you complete tasks that you might otherwise forget about. 
If you’ve set a goal, such as losing weight or stopping smoking, set a recur-
ring appointment every day that will alert you and display a friendly reminder 
about your goal. If you need to take medication at a certain time of day, set a 
reminder for that, too. If you always forget to take out the garbage on trash pickup 
day, set another reminder so you’ll never be stuck with a pile of trash for an extra 
week. 
The Calendar program helps you keep track of your schedule. Now you just 
need a reason to be in a particular place at a certain time.
Figure 38-11: The Event Alert 
screen lets you set an event 
reminder.

Use Your iPhone to 
Get More from Your 
Calendar
If you already store appoint-
ments in Google Calendar, you 
can sync it with the Calendar 
app on your iPhone. However, if 
you want a more powerful alter-
native to the built-in calendar, 
skip the Calendar app and con-
sider using GooSync. GooSync 
provides advanced features, 
such as the ability to use data 
from Google Calendar and label 
each appointment by a priority 
number, a classification, a busy 
status, and even map coordi-
nates. By switching to GooSync, 
you now have a more powerful 
alternative to the Calendar app 
that comes with your iPhone.

GooSync provides additional 
ways to classify an appointment.

We’ve all gotten lost in an unfamiliar neighbor-
hood. In the old days, we asked strangers for 
directions or used a mobile phone to call for 
help. To prevent this dilemma, many people 
now print out maps before they venture out 
toward a new or unfamiliar part of town, but 
maps can be easy to lose and useless if you 
don’t know where you are to begin with. For a 
better solution, you can use the Maps applica-
tion on your iPhone.
Project goal: Learn how to view maps on 
your iPhone.

Maps

Project 39
What You’ll Be Using
To view maps on your iPhone, you need to use the following:
The Maps application
Viewing a Map
The Maps program relies on the Internet to retrieve maps and directions, so you’ll 
find that the program runs faster when you’re connected to a Wi-Fi network. If 
you aren’t able to connect to a Wi-Fi network, your iPhone will access your cellular 
telephone company’s network, but the Maps program will run much slower. 
Of course, having a map is pretty useless unless you know where you are on 
that map to begin with. You can use Maps to find out where you are. To view a map 
of your current location, do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Maps. The Maps screen appears. 
2.	
Tap the crosshair icon in the lower-left corner of the screen. The screen dis-
plays a map with a blue dot highlighting your current location, as shown in 
Figure 39-1.
3.	
(Optional) Press your fingertip any-
where on the map and slide your 
finger up, down, left, or right on 
the screen to view different parts 
of the map. 
4.	
(Optional) Pinch two fingers on the 
screen and then spread them apart 
to zoom in. Close the two fingers 
on the screen to zoom out.
Q
Q Note: If you’re driving a car or riding 
a bus as you’re viewing a map, you’ll 
see the blue dot move to display your 
location as you travel. Your iPhone 
uses various cellular network towers to 
triangulate your location, so if you find 
yourself in an area without any cellular 
phone coverage, the Maps program 
won’t be able to show your current 
location. 
Figure 39-1: The map displays a 
blue dot to identify your current 
location.

Viewing Different Types of Maps
Normally, the Maps screen displays a simplified map, which makes it easy to iden-
tify roads and highways. However, your iPhone offers three different types of map 
views, as shown in Figure 39-2:
>
>
Map  Displays roads and highways in a simplified map
>
>
Satellite  Displays a satellite photograph of roads and highways, along with 
buildings and other physical features
>
>
Hybrid  Displays a simplified map superimposed over a satellite 
photograph
To change the way the Maps screen displays a map, do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Maps. The Maps screen appears. 
2.	
Tap the Options icon (which looks like a page with a corner curling back) in 
the lower-right corner of the screen. The lower-right corner of the map curls 
back, revealing several options, as shown in Figure 39-3.
Figure 39-2: Three types of map views are available: Map, Satellite, and Hybrid.

Tap Map, Satellite, or Hybrid at 
the bottom of the screen.

Q Note: If you tap List, you’ll see a list 
of all the companies responsible for 
creating your iPhone’s maps.
4.	
Tap the Options icon to cover up 
the options and view the map 
again.
Checking Traffic
If you need to drive somewhere in a 
hurry, Maps can not only help you figure 
out how to get there, but by display-
ing real-time traffic data, your iPhone 
can also show you how to avoid traffic 
bottlenecks. Your iPhone draws green 
lines to show you where traffic is flowing 
smoothly on the highways. Yellow lines 
are used to show routes where traffic is 
slowing down, and red lines show routes 
where traffic is at a standstill. By knowing 
the locations of traffic jams and avoiding 
those areas, you can get to your destina-
tion as quickly as possible.
Q
Q Note: Traffic data appears only for major highways, not for side streets.
To view real-time traffic data on a map, do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Maps. The Maps screen appears. 
2.	
Tap the crosshair icon in the lower-left corner of the screen.
3.	
Tap the Options icon in the lower-right corner of the screen. The lower-right 
corner of the map curls back, revealing several options (see Figure 39-3).
Figure 39-3: Tapping the 
Options icon causes the map 
to curl back and reveal addi-
tional options for customizing 
the map.

4.	
Tap Show Traffic in the middle 
of the screen. The map displays 
green, yellow, and red lines to 
reveal traffic congestion informa-
tion for several highways, as shown 
in Figure 39-4. 
Q
Q Note: To turn off traffic data, tap 
the Options icon, and then tap Hide 
Traffic. 
Additional Ideas for 
Viewing Maps
Maps are always handy whenever you’re 
lost in an unfamiliar neighborhood. 
Instead of pulling into a gas station to 
buy a map or asking a stranger for direc-
tions, you can use Maps to help you 
navigate to your current location so you’ll 
know where you’re at and where you 
want to go. 
Maps can also be a fun way to study geography. From the Maps screen, type 
the name of a major city in the search text box at the top of the screen, and then 
tap Search at the bottom of the screen. If you slide your finger to move the map 
view left, right, up, or down, you can view different areas. This can be a fun way to 
keep bored children amused and get them interested in studying maps and learn-
ing about other parts of the world.
With a cellular phone connection and your iPhone, you’ll always know where 
you are. Now you just need to worry about where you want to go.

Use Your iPhone to Find a Restaurant
A map is useless if you don’t know what you’re looking for. In case you’re look-
ing for something to eat, use the Urbanspoon app. This app displays a slot 
machine–like interface of three reels that identify a location, a type of cuisine 
(such as Mexican or Indian), and a price. 
You can lock one or two of these reels in case you only want to find 
Chinese restaurants in a certain neighborhood, and then shake your iPhone to 
set the reels spinning. Your iPhone will display a restaurant that matches your 
criteria. Just tap the Map field to view a map of the restaurant’s location, and 
you can go get something to eat. Urbanspoon and your iPhone can help you 
find the best restaurants wherever you happen to be, so you won’t have to rely 
on locals to give you recommendations.
Urbanspoon  http://www.urbanspoon.com/
Urbanspoon can help you find a restaurant near you.

Looking at a map, you may have no idea 
where a favorite restaurant or sports bar might 
be. On a traditional paper map, you can mark 
a big X on a spot to help you quickly identify a 
specific location. That makes it easy to find that 
place again.
While you can’t write directly on an iPhone 
map, you can place a cartoon push pin on the 
map to identify a favorite place, so you’ll always 
be able to find your favorite sushi restaurant or 
the cheapest gas station every time you glance 
at your iPhone map. Better yet, your iPhone 
can give you driving, walking, and mass tran-
sit directions to help you get where you want 
to go.
Project goal: Learn how to find the most 
direct route to any location on a map displayed 
on your iPhone. 
Finding a Location 
and Getting 
Directions

318	 |	
Project 40
What You’ll Be Using
To get locations and directions using your iPhone, you need to use the following:
The Maps application
Getting Directions
The Maps program can give you directions to help you get from one place to 
another through the magic of GPS (Global Positioning System) technology. Before 
you can get directions, you need to define your starting and ending destinations 
by doing one of the following:
>
>
Type in a street address.
>
>
Use your current location.
>
>
Use a previously saved location.
To find directions with a starting and ending destination, do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Maps. The Maps screen appears.
2.	
Tap Directions at the bottom of the screen. The Directions screen appears 
and displays Start and End text boxes at the top of the screen. By default, 
the Start text box contains your current location using GPS, as shown in 
Figure 40-1.
3.	
(Optional) Tap the swap icon (the wavy double-sided arrow) to switch the 
current location from the Start text box to the End text box. 
Figure 40-1: The Directions screen lets 
you choose starting and ending locations.

an X, as shown in Figure 40-2. Tap 
the X to clear that text box.
5.	
Tap the Start text box and type a 
street address (including the city 
and state). Or, if you tap the Book-
marks icon that appears to the right 
of the field, the Bookmarks screen 
appears, listing all previously saved 
locations; choose a location by tap-
ping its name.
6.	
Tap the End text box and type a 
street address (including the city 
and state). Or, if you tap the Book-
marks icon that appears to the right 
of the field, the Bookmarks screen 
appears, listing all previously saved 
locations; choose a location by tap-
ping its name. After you’ve chosen 
an ending location, a blue Route 
button appears in the lower-right 
corner of the screen.
7.	
Tap Route. The iPhone map highlights a route and displays car, bus, and 
walking icons at the top of the screen, as shown in Figure 40-3.
Figure 40-2: You can clear 
the contents of a destination

map with directions telling you 
which way to go, along with the 
number of screen directions and 
the current screen you’re looking 
at (such as 1 of 10), as shown in 
Figure 40-4.
10.	
Tap the left and right arrow buttons 
in the upper-right corner to view 
each screen of instructions that will 
get you closer to your destination. 
Finding Businesses on 
a Map
Having a map is useless if you don’t know 
where anything is. To help you out, your 
iPhone lets you type in a description of 
a place you want to find. The map then 
displays pins that highlight those loca-
tions. For example, if you want to find a 
nearby coffeehouse, just type coffee into 
your iPhone. If you want to find the clos-
est sushi restaurant, type sushi.
To find a specific type of business 
on a map, do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Maps. 
The Maps screen appears. 
2.	
Tap the Search button at the bot-
tom of the screen. 
3.	
Tap in the search text box at the 
top of the screen. The virtual key-
board appears at the bottom of the 
screen.
4.	
Type a description of a business 
you want to find, such as gas 
station or pizza, and tap the Search 
button in the lower-right corner of 
the screen. Your iPhone displays 
red push pins at the locations of 
relevant businesses, as shown in 
Figure 40-5.
Figure 40-4: The Maps program 
displays travel directions.
Figure 40-5: Red push pins 
identify multiple businesses that 
match your search criteria.

5.	
(Optional) Tap a red push pin to display the name of the business repre-
sented. Then tap the white arrow in the blue circle to view the phone number 
and address of the business. You can also tap the Directions To Here button 
to get directions to this business.
Marking a Location on a Map
If you find a location on a map that you want to save, you can place a virtual push 
pin on that spot, called a dropped pin. After placing the pin, you can move it 
around until it appears exactly where you want it. Then give it a distinctive name so 
you’ll always be able to find a specific location, such as the site of a favorite park or 
hiking trail, which may not have a specific street address. You can also delete a pin 
from a map later if you want.
Dropping a Pin on a Map
When you drop a pin on a map, the pin appears in purple. The purple color means 
that you can move the pin around, because you haven’t yet given it a descriptive 
name. The moment you name the pin location, the color of the pin changes to red.
To place a pin on a map, do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Maps. 
The Maps screen appears. 
2.	
Tap the Options icon in the 
lower‑right corner of the screen 
(it looks like a corner of a page 
curling back). The lower-right 
corner of the map curls back, 
revealing several options.
3.	
Tap Drop Pin in the middle of the 
screen. The map now displays a 
purple pin floating above your 
map, as shown in Figure 40-6. This 
pin probably won’t appear exactly 
where you want it, so you’ll have to 
move it.
4.	
Press and hold your fingertip on 
the pin until it appears to lift off the 
map. (You may find it easier to “lift” 
the pin off the map if you press 
your fingertip near the bottom of 
the pin image.)
5.	
Lift your finger off the screen when 
the pin is exactly where you want it. 
The pin appears to drop and stick 
in the map.
Q
Q Note: Only one purple pin can appear on the map at a time.
Figure 40-6: A purple pin lets 
you mark a specific location on 
a map.

Project 40
Naming a Pin Location
After you’ve placed the pin on a map, you’ll probably want to name it; otherwise, 
the pin won’t represent anything obvious. To give a pin a name, do this:
1.	
Tap the white arrow in the blue circle that appears above the purple pin on 
the map. The Info screen appears, as shown in Figure 40-7.
2.	
Tap Add to Bookmarks. An Add Bookmark screen appears with the virtual 
keyboard, so you can type a descriptive name for the pin’s location, as shown 
in Figure 40-8.
3.	
Type a descriptive name and tap Save. The Info screen appears again.
4.	
Tap Map in the upper-left corner of the screen. Notice that the pin color has 
changed to red, and your descriptive name appears in the dialog directly 
above the pin. 
Q
Q Note: Although you can have only one purple pin on the map at a time, you 
can have as many red pins on the map as you want.
Figure 40-7: The Info screen lets 
you bookmark your pin location.
Figure 40-8: The virtual key-
board lets you type a descrip-
tive name for your chosen 
location.

|	 323
Finding a Pin Location
After you’ve placed multiple red pins on a map, you may want to find a specific 
location in a hurry. To find a location identified by a pin, do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Maps. 
The Maps screen appears. 
2.	
Tap Search. The Search or Address 
text box appears at the top of the 
screen. 
3.	
Tap the Bookmarks icon that 
appears in the text box. (If the 
Bookmarks icon does not appear, 
tap the close button.) The Book-
marks screen appears, as shown in 
Figure 40-9. 
4.	
(Optional) If the Bookmarks screen 
does not appear, tap Bookmarks 
at the bottom of the screen.
5.	
Tap the location you want to find. 
The Maps screen appears, display-
ing a red pin on the map that rep-
resents the location you chose. 
6.	
(Optional) Tap the white arrow in 
the blue circle. The Info screen 
appears. Now you can tap Direc-
tions To Here or Directions From 
Here to get directions for your 
chosen location.
Viewing Google Street View
When viewing maps of major cities, you can often view actual photographs of 
your desired location using Google Street View, a feature of Google Maps. Basi-
cally, Google hired cars with 360-degree cameras mounted on their roofs to drive 
around major streets of the United States and take pictures. By using Google 
Street View, you can see how your destination looks before you get there. That 
way, you’ll be familiar with the building you want to find. 
To use Google Street View, you must first identify a specific location with a 
red pin. Then you can check whether Google Street View is available for that loca-
tion by doing this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Maps. The Maps screen appears. 
2.	
Find a red pin by following the steps in “Finding a Pin Location” on page 323.
3.	
Tap the red pin to display a description dialog.
Figure 40-9: The Bookmarks 
screen lets you choose a spe-
cific location.

Project 40
4.	
Look for an orange circle with a 
white silhouette of a man that 
appears to the left of the red pin’s 
descriptive dialog, as shown in Fig-
ure 40-10. This orange circle identi-
fies street addresses that can be 
seen through Google Street View.
Q
Q Note: Not all streets have Google 
Street View photographs available for 
you to view.
5.	
Tap the orange circle. Google 
Street View for that address 
appears, as shown in Figure 40-11. 
6.	
Slide your finger across the screen 
to swivel the view. (You can rotate 
the iPhone to view the street hori-
zontally or vertically on the screen.)
7.	
Tap the screen to display a blue 
Done button in the corner. Tap 
Done to exit street view.

Deleting a Pin
After you’ve placed pins on a map, you’ll eventually want to delete at least some of 
them to keep them from cluttering up your map. To delete a pin, do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Maps. 
The Maps screen appears. 
2.	
Tap the Bookmarks icon in the 
Search or Address text box. (If the 
Bookmarks icon does not appear, 
tap the close icon.) The Bookmarks 
screen appears (see Figure 40-9). 
(If the Bookmarks screen does not 
appear, tap Bookmarks at the bot-
tom of the screen.)
3.	
Tap Edit in the upper-left corner 
of the screen. A white minus sign 
inside a red circle appears to the 
left of all your bookmarked pin 
locations.
4.	
Tap the white minus sign inside the 
red circle to display a red Delete 
button, as shown in Figure 40-12.
5.	
Tap Delete, and the bookmarked 
pin location disappears.
6.	
Tap Done twice. The map reap-
pears, and the selected pin has 
been removed.
Finding a Recent Search
If finding a certain location was important to you once, chances are it will be 
important for you to find it again. Each time you search for a location, the Maps 
program stores that search in a Recents list, which you can view. So instead of typ-
ing the same address over and over again, you can browse the Recents list of past 
location searches, tap the one you want, and view the location right away.
To view and choose from a list of recent searches, do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Maps. The Maps screen appears. 
2.	
Tap the Bookmarks icon. The Bookmarks screen appears (see Figure 40-9). 
Figure 40-12: A red Delete 
button lets you delete a book-
marked pin from the map.

3.	
Tap Recents at the bottom of the screen. The Recents screen appears, list-
ing past location searches, as shown in Figure 40-13. 
4.	
Tap a location. The Maps screen displays a pin identifying that location or 
route.
5.	
(Optional) Tap Clear in the upper-left corner of the screen to clear your list 
of past searches. Tap the Clear All Recents button to clear your list, or tap 
Cancel if you change your mind, as shown in Figure 40-14.
Additional Ideas for Getting Directions
Whenever you’re lost, use the Maps program to get your current location so you’ll 
know where you’re at and where you need to go. Check out your current location 
the next time you’re riding in a taxi. Turn on your iPhone, look at a map, and you 
can tell whether the cab driver is taking the shortest route possible or driving you 
all over town to increase your cab fare. 
If you’re traveling to an unfamiliar location, check Google Street View to 
scope out the area. This can help you identify potential parking spots or recognize 
the building when you get close to it. Using Maps on your iPhone, you should be 
able to navigate through many new places without getting lost. 
Figure 40-13: The Recents 
screen shows your previous 
searches.

Use Your iPhone to Find 
Cheap Gas 
Getting directions from your 
current location to a destination 
may be nice, but if you’re driv-

gas somewhere along the way. 
Most people just stop at the 
first gas station they find, but if 
you’d rather look for the lowest 
prices around, use the Cheap 
Gas! app.
This app uses your cur-
rent location and ties it into a 
constantly updated database 
of the lowest gas prices in a 
neighborhood. At the touch of 
a button, you’ll be able to find

Fun Stuff

Few of us carry a camera everywhere we go, 
but we may regret it when we see something 
worth capturing, such as Sasquatch or a UFO. 
To avoid this problem, the iPhone includes a 
built-in camera. Since you usually always carry 
your iPhone with you, its built-in camera means 
you’ll always have a camera available when you 
really need one.
Of course, the built-in iPhone camera isn’t 
nearly as good as a real digital camera. The 
iPhone’s camera offers only 2-megapixel reso-
lution, while most digital camera models offer 
7-megapixel resolution or higher. In addition, 
the iPhone camera doesn’t allow you to zoom 
in, so unless you’re close enough to capture the 
image detail, you’ll be out of luck if that’s what 
you’re looking for. Despite these limitations, 
the iPhone camera can be handy for capturing 
quick images at the spur of the moment.
Taking 
Pictures

332	 |	
Project 41
In addition to capturing images around you, you can also use your iPhone to 
capture images that appear on your iPhone’s screen. Capturing such images can 
be handy for showing people how to use different features of the iPhone (such 
as the screenshots in this book) or for capturing error messages or quirky iPhone 
behavior that you want to show to others to verify that something strange really did 
happen and wasn’t just your imagination.
Project goal: Learn how to take pictures and capture screenshots with your 
iPhone. 
What You’ll Be Using
To take pictures and capture screenshots with your iPhone, you need to use the 
following:
The Camera application
The Photos application
Taking and Viewing Pictures
The iPhone’s camera lens is on the back of the iPhone near the Sleep/Wake but-
ton. The lens looks like a little hole, so make sure your finger doesn’t accidentally 
cover it when you take a picture. After you take a picture, you’ll probably want to 
view it, so this section shows you how to do that, too. 
Q
Q Note: When you capture pictures 
using the iPhone camera, your iPhone 
saves them in the JPEG file format. 
When you capture screen images, your 
iPhone saves them in the PNG file 
format.
Taking Pictures
To take a picture, you need to run the 
Camera program by doing this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap 
Camera. The Camera screen 
appears and displays a dialog 
asking if you want to tag the photo 
with your current location, as 
shown in Figure 41-1. 
2.	
Tap OK or Don’t Allow. After a few 
seconds, the screen will appear to 
open and whatever image you’re 
aiming at with the lens will appear.
Figure 41-1: The Camera 
screen is blank before the lens 
engages.

3.	
Point the camera at an object and tap the camera icon at the bottom of the 
screen to take the picture. The picture is automatically stored in the Camera 
roll.
4.	
Press the Home button to return to the Home screen, or stick with the Cam-
era screen if you want to view your image.
Viewing Pictures on the Camera Screen
Immediately after you take a picture, you can look at it to see if it’s worth keeping 
or if you need to take another picture right away. To view your pictures without 
exiting the Camera screen, do this:
1.	
With the Camera screen displayed 
on your iPhone, tap the thumb-
nail icon in the lower-left corner 
of the screen. The Camera Roll 
screen appears, displaying the last 
image you captured, as shown in 
Figure 41-2.
2.	
(Optional) Scroll left or right to 
view all the images stored on your 
iPhone. Tap the Trash icon in the 
lower-right corner if you don’t like 
the image you just captured. When 
a dialog appears asking if you really 
want to delete the currently dis-
played photograph, tap Delete.
3.	
Tap the Done button in the upper-
right corner of the screen. You’ll 
then return to the camera screen 
so you can take more pictures.
Q
Q Note: You may notice a lag while you’re taking photos with your iPhone. To 
minimize it, you can tap and hold your finger on the camera button as you 
set up your shot; then simply release your finger when you’re ready to take a 
picture.
Viewing Pictures on the Photo Albums Screen
After you’ve exited the Camera screen, you can view your stored pictures through 
the Photo Albums screen, which you can open by doing this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Photos. The Photo Albums screen appears, as 
shown in Figure 41-3.

picture, respectively.
Capturing 
Screenshots
Anything you see on your iPhone screen can be captured and stored as a digital 
file. This can be handy for creating iPhone tutorials or for showing someone the 
neat features of your iPhone so he can feel inadequate about his own ancient 
mobile phone that already looks like a relic from the dustbins of history. 
To capture screenshots of anything that appears on your iPhone screen, hold 
down the Sleep/Wake button and then press the Home button. The screen should 
flash white briefly to signal that you have just captured a screenshot. Now release 
both buttons. The screenshot is saved to the Camera Roll.
To view your screenshots, you’ll need to open the Photo Albums screen, as 
explained in “Viewing Pictures on the Photo Albums Screen” on page 333.
Additional Ideas for Taking Pictures with 
Your iPhone
A camera can come in handy at the most unusual times. If you are involved in an 
accident, take pictures of the scene for evidence. If you see Bigfoot or a UFO, whip 
out your iPhone and capture a picture to provide solid photographic evidence 
once and for all.
Take pictures of your friends, family members, and loved ones so you’ll 
always have their pictures stored on your iPhone. Then if you go on a long trip 
away from home, you can still see their smiling faces on your iPhone whenever you 
miss them.
Figure 41-3: The Photo Albums 
screen displays all your stored 
photo albums.

	
Taking Pictures

Capturing screenshots can be useful when you’re trying to show someone 
how to use an iPhone or if you’re having problems using your iPhone yourself. Take 
a screenshot and show someone what they should do to accomplish a particular 
task. If you see a strange error message, capture that screenshot and show the 
geniuses at the Apple Store what happened so they can help troubleshoot prob-
lems on your iPhone.
Your iPhone can double as a simple camera when you don’t have a real digi-
tal camera with you. Have fun, take pictures, and erase any that you don’t like. Now 
you can experiment with photography without buying an expensive camera to 
do it. 
Use Your iPhone to Draw on Your Photos
Taking pictures can be fun, but to keep yourself even more amused, use the 
Photo Brush Lite program, which lets you modify any pictures stored on your 
iPhone. Take pictures of your friends and draw mustaches on them. Capture 
pictures of landmarks or scenery and draw cartoon space aliens and monsters 
running around. By using your existing photographs as a starting point, you 
can exercise your creativity by finger painting on your iPhone.

Whether you capture pictures with your iPhone 
or copy them from your computer, you’ll prob-
ably want to view your images on your iPhone. 
You can turn your iPhone into a slideshow 
viewer and cycle through your pictures, or you 
can look at pictures individually (and delete 
them if you don’t need them any more). By 
using your iPhone to store and view pictures, 
you can turn your iPhone into a portable digital 
picture frame so you can take along your favor-
ite pictures wherever you go.

What You’ll Be Using
To view pictures with your iPhone, you need to use the following:
The Settings application
The Photos application
Viewing Pictures as a Slideshow
Since you can store literally thousands of photographs on your iPhone, you might 
find it most convenient to view them in a slideshow, where each picture appears on 
the screen for a few seconds before automatically switching to a new picture. By 
viewing pictures as a slideshow, you won’t have to switch pictures manually.
Defining Your Slideshow
When defining your slideshow, you can 
modify four options:
>
>
How long each slide appears on 
the screen
>
>
The transition time between 
each slide
>
>
Whether or not to repeat the 
entire slideshow
>
>
Whether to display pictures in 
order or at random
To customize a slideshow, do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap 
Settings. The Settings screen 
appears. 
2.	
Scroll down and tap Photos near 
the bottom of the screen. The 
Photos screen appears, as shown in 
Figure 42-1.
3.	
Tap Play Each Slide For. The Play 
Each Slide For screen appears, 
where you can choose a duration 
to display each picture, as shown in 
Figure 42-2.

left corner of the screen to return to the Photos screen. (The Cube transition 
rotates pictures as if they appear on the face of a cube, and the Dissolve 
transition makes pictures seem to disappear slowly. The Ripple transition 
makes pictures look like water ripples. The Wipe Across and Wipe Down 
transitions make it appear as if a picture is sliding out of the way to reveal 
another one.) 
7.	
Tap the ON/OFF button next to Repeat. If turned on, your iPhone will play 
the slideshow continuously until you press the Home button. If turned off, 
your iPhone will play your slideshow only once, until every picture has been 
displayed exactly one time.
8.	
Tap the ON/OFF button next to Shuffle. If turned on, your iPhone will display 
pictures in random order. If turned off, your iPhone will display pictures in the 
order that you stored them.

Additional Ideas for Viewing Pictures on 
Your iPhone
Since you can assign pictures to names stored in your Contacts program, you can 
take a picture of a certain animal and associate that picture with someone you 
don’t like. Take vacation pictures and send them to your friends and family mem-
bers back home so they can see what a wonderful time you’re having without wait-
ing for you to return and bore them with a typical vacation slideshow later. 
If you’re the type who forgets shopping lists and doesn’t like writing things 
down, take a picture of the inside of your refrigerator. Then, at the store, you can 
see at a glance what you’re missing and what you need. They say that a picture 
is worth a thousand words, so feel free to experiment with different uses for pic-
tures. As long as you have your iPhone with you, you’ll always have a photographic 
memory.

Almost everyone needs to check a weather 
forecast once in a while to plan for a visit or 
an outdoor excursion. To see a current tem-
perature and a weather forecast for the next 
six days for a particular place, you can use the 
iPhone’s Weather application. As long as you 
have Internet access through a Wi-Fi network 
or your cellular telephone network, you can 
get the latest forecast for nearly any city in the 
world.

What You’ll Be Using
To learn how to view weather conditions and the latest forecast on your iPhone, 
you need to use the following:
The Weather application
Defining a City for a Forecast
Before you can view a weather forecast, you must first define one or more cities for 
which you want to display weather information. First, you’ll probably want to add 
the city where you live. You can also add other cities so you’ll be able to view mul-
tiple weather forecasts for different areas at the same time. 
Adding a City
To add a city to your weather forecast list, do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Weather. The Weather screen appears, as 
shown in Figure 43-1. (Until you define a location, your iPhone will simply 
display the default city, Cupertino, where Apple headquarters is located.)
2.	
Tap the information (i) button in the lower-right corner of the screen. 
3.	
The Weather screen displays a list of default cities as well as any cities that 
you’ve added, as shown in Figure 43-2.
Figure 43-1: The Weather 
screen displays the current tem-
perature and the forecast for a 
pre-selected city.

a city. If you start typing a city 
name, a list of matching city names 
appears, as shown in Figure 43-3.
6.	
Tap the name of the city you 
want to add. The Weather screen 
appears again, including your 
newly added city.
7.	
(Optional) Tap °F or °C to display 
temperatures in Fahrenheit or 
Celsius, respectively.
8.	
Tap the Done button in the upper-
right corner to view the weather 
forecast screen.
Deleting a City
If you no longer want to view forecasts 
for a particular city, you can remove 
it from your weather forecast list by 
doing this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Weather. The Weather screen appears (see 
Figure 43-1). 
2.	
Tap the information (i) button in the lower-right corner of the screen. The 
Weather screen displays a list of cities currently stored on your iPhone (see 
Figure 43-2).
3.	
Tap the white minus sign inside a red circle to the left of the name of the city 
you want to remove from the list. A red Delete button appears.
4.	
Tap Delete. The city disappears from the forecast list.
5.	
Tap the Done button in the upper-right corner to view the weather forecast 
screen.
Viewing a Forecast
If you defined only one city in your forecast list, tapping Weather from the Home 
screen will always display weather information for that city. If you have defined two 
or more cities, you can view forecasts for each of those cities by doing this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Weather. The Weather screen appears. Dots 
appear at the bottom of the weather screen to show you how many city fore-
casts are available.

Project 43
2.	
Slide your finger to the left or right 
on the Weather screen to display 
the previous or next forecast, 
respectively, as shown in Fig-
ure 43-4. If you have added more 
than one or two cities, keep sliding 
until you see the forecast for the 
city you want. 
3.	
Press the Home button to return to 
the Home screen.
Additional Ideas 
for Checking the 
Weather Forecast
If you plan to travel to multiple cities, 
take a moment to add each of those 
cities to your forecast list. That way, 
you’ll be able to prepare for the weather 
in those areas without running into any 
nasty surprises such as extreme heat 
or cold.
In addition to checking the weather 
for a destination, you might also want to 
check the latest events happening in that 
city. If you have the time and the weather 
is nice, you can attend events unique to 
that particular area, such as a museum 
event. To view the latest cultural events in 
a city on your forecast list, do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap 
Weather. The Weather screen 
appears. 
2.	
Tap the Yahoo! icon in the lower-
left corner of the screen. A Yahoo! 
web page appears.
3.	
Scroll down to view the weather 
forecast and a list of events occur-
ring in that city today, as shown in 
Figure 43-5.

Tap an event to view more 
information.

lar area, but if you crave more detailed information, grab a copy of the Weather Channel’s iPhone app. 
This app lets you see a map of an area, view ten-day forecasts, and even view videos so you can see 
weather conditions for yourself. If you need to know the absolutely latest news about the weather, let 
the Weather Channel app turn your iPhone into your up-to-date weather forecasting source.

Many people invest in the stock market. While 
some people buy stocks and forget about 
them, many more actively enjoy watching a 
stock’s price go up (hopefully) or down. By 
carefully tracking the price of your stocks, you 
can decide the best time to buy or sell.
In the old days, you’d check a stock listing 
in the newspaper or visit a financial website and 
type in the stock name to view current prices. 
If you were following several stocks, typing and 
retyping stock symbols could get annoying; 
your iPhone lets you type the symbols of the 
stocks you want to track once, and then you 
can view the latest prices at any time as often 
as you want. From the convenience of your 
iPhone, you can check to see if you’ve made or 
lost money in the stock market.

Project 44
What You’ll Be Using
To view stock quotes on your iPhone, you need to use the following:
The Stocks application
Defining Stocks to Watch
To retrieve stock quotes, you must first define which stocks you want to watch. To 
do this, you must identify the stock symbol for each stock, which is usually a one- 
to four-letter acronym, such as T for AT&T, TM for Toyota Motor Company, RHT for 
Red Hat Software, or AAPL for Apple, Inc. To find a symbol for a stock, you’ll need 
to visit a financial website and look up the symbol—simply type the name of the 
company to see the specific stock symbol for that company. Two popular financial 
websites that offer symbol lookups are the New York Stock Exchange (http://www
.nyse.com/) and NASDAQ (http://www.nasdaq.com/). 
After you’ve identified the symbol for each stock that you want to track, you 
can open the Stocks program, delete stock symbols you don’t want to track, and 
add stock symbols that you do want to track. 
Deleting a Stock
The Stocks application includes several 
sample stock quotes, just so you can see 
how the program works. You might not 
care about these sample stock quotes, 
so you can delete them to make room for 
stocks that you do care about.
To delete a stock, do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Stocks. 
The Stocks screen appears, as 
shown in Figure 44-1. 
2.	
Tap the information (i) button in the 
lower-right corner of the screen. 
The Stocks screen displays a list of 
stocks currently chosen, as shown 
in Figure 44-2.
Figure 44-1: The Stocks screen 
initially shows sample stock 
quotes.

price, such as +1.82%. The Numbers button lets you see the actual price rise 
or drop in a stock, such as -0.68.
4.	
Tap the red circle with the white minus sign next to the stock you want to 
remove. A red Delete button appears to the right of the stock name, as 
shown in Figure 44-3.
5.	
Tap Delete. The stock disappears from your list.
6.	
Tap Done.
Adding a Stock
To view the stocks that you care about, you’ll need to add them to the Stocks 
screen by doing this:
1.	
While running the Stocks program, tap the information (i) button in the 
lower-right corner of the screen. The Stocks screen displays a list of stocks 
currently chosen.

Additional Ideas for 
Viewing Stock Quotes
The Stocks application can help you track 
your stock portfolio so you can see how 
much money you’ve made (or lost) that 
day. Even if you don’t own any stocks, 
you might want to track stock prices of a 
few popular companies just to be aware 
of their financial health.
For example, compare the stock prices of Apple (AAPL) with Microsoft 
(MSFT), and you can get a rough idea which company seems to have a brighter 
future. Do the same with search engine rivals Google (GOOG) and Yahoo! (YHOO), 
and you can see which company is financially stronger. By watching stocks on your 
iPhone, you can see if you have what it takes to make (or lose) money consistently 
in the stock market.

Use Your iPhone to Play the Stock Market  
with Virtual Cash
Playing the stock market can be like a game, but if you don’t know how to play 
intelligently, you could lose a good chunk of money. Before you risk buying 
and selling stock with real cash, try the Virtual Stock Market app, which lets 
you paper trade with an imaginary portfolio of $100,000. 
By playing this game, you can test out different stock trading strategies 
and track your results. If you’re the competitive type, you can even compete 
against others to see who can generate the highest score by making the most 
money in the stock market. Once you feel comfortable paper trading, you can 
make that step into risking real money.
The Virtual Stock Market app lets you paper trade with real 
stock data.

In addition to making telephone calls, you can 
use your iPhone to view the time. Rather than 
wear a watch, many people glance at their 
iPhone for the current time. And in addition to 
acting like a watch, it can also function as an 
alarm clock, stopwatch, and timer.
If you need to know the correct time, or you 
need to keep track of time, let your iPhone do 
the work so you can do something else and 
have fun instead.

What You’ll Be Using
To work with time on your iPhone, you’ll need the following:
The Clock application
The Settings application
Viewing the Time 
When you need to know the time, do one of the following:
>
>
If your iPhone is in sleep mode, press the Sleep/Wake button or the Home 
button to display the current date and time on the screen along with a slider 
that lets you access your iPhone, as shown in Figure 45-1.
>
>
If your iPhone is currently running, press the Home button to view the Home 
screen. The current time appears at the top of the screen, as shown in 
Figure 45-2.
Sometimes you may want to know both the current local time and the time in 
another time zone. For example, if you live in Los Angeles but need to call London 
or Tel Aviv on a regular basis, you’ll need to know the current time in those cities.
Rather than force you to perform mental calculations when you need to know 
the current time in another time zone, your iPhone World Clock can show you the 
time in major cities around the world.

Setting the Time
Most likely, your iPhone has already 
accessed your cellular phone network to 
find the correct time and date. However, 
if you let your battery die and you hap-
pen to be out of range of cellular phone 
coverage, or if you just like setting your 
clock five minutes ahead so you’ll never 
be late, you may need to set the date and 
time manually. To set the time, do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap 
Settings. The Settings screen 
appears.
2.	
Tap General. The General screen 
appears.
3.	
Scroll down the General screen 
and tap Date & Time. The Date & 
Time screen appears, as shown in 
Figure 45-18.
4.	
(Optional) Tap the ON/OFF button 
next to 24-Hour Time. When this 
is set to off, your iPhone identifies 
time with am/pm designations, such as 2:49 pm or 9:10 am. When this button 
is set to on, your iPhone displays times in 24-hour time, with morning times 
shown as usual (such as 9:10) and afternoon times shown in 24-hour time—
so, for example, 2:29 pm would appear as 14:29). 
5.	
(Optional) Tap the ON/OFF button next to Set Automatically. If the button 
is set to on, your iPhone will set the correct time by itself. If your iPhone is 
displaying the wrong time, you’ll need to set the time manually by continuing 
with the remaining steps.

Additional Ideas for Using the Clock 
Application
With so many ways to play with time, your iPhone can replace a watch, an alarm 
clock, a stopwatch, and a timer. If you’re on a blind date and want an escape route 
if the date isn’t going well, set an alarm for a time that will occur in the middle of 
your date. When the alarm goes off, you can pretend it’s an important phone call 
and excuse yourself from your date. 
Run Multiple Timers on 
Your iPhone 
For a more practical applica-
tion, set time limits for different 
tasks, such as reminding yourself 
that you need to clean out the 
garage or exercise on a treadmill 
for an hour. Then use the timer 
on your iPhone to let you know 
when your time is up. With your 
iPhone as your constant com-
panion, you should never lose 
track of time again—unless, of 
course, you forget to recharge 
your iPhone. The iPhone’s timer 
is handy for measuring time, but 
it can only display one timer at 
a time. If you want to keep track 
of multiple times, you’ll need the 
Chronology app, which lets you 
display up to twelve timers on 
the screen simultaneously. 
Now you can measure time, such as how fast someone can run a fixed 
distance while also counting down from a specified time (such as 20 minutes) 
so you can tell when you need to do something, such as pulling a pot roast out 
of the oven or making an important phone call.

If you lose or temporarily misplace your iPhone, 
anyone can pick it up, turn it on, and start mak-
ing phone calls at your expense. To protect 
yourself from unauthorized users, you can pro-
tect your iPhone with a four-digit passcode.
This passcode forces anyone (including you) 
to type a four-digit number every time you 
turn on your iPhone or wake it up from sleep 
mode. If someone (including you) can’t type 
the proper four-digit passcode, your iPhone 
remains securely locked to prevent unauthor-
ized access.

Project 46
What You’ll Be Using
To protect your iPhone with a passcode, you need to use the following:
The Settings application
Setting a Passcode
To set a passcode, you must choose a four-digit number that will be easy for you 
to remember but difficult for someone else to guess. For example, a passcode of 
1234 might be easy to remember, but it’s also way too easy for someone to guess.
Ideally, choose a four-digit number that means something to you and that 
no one else will know about. For example, use the first four numbers of your Social 
Security number or the year that your favorite sports team last won a major cham-
pionship (such as 1997). 
When you’ve decided on a four-
digit passcode, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap 
Settings. The Settings screen 
appears.
2.	
Tap General. The General screen 
appears.
3.	
Tap Passcode Lock. The Set Pass-
code screen appears, as shown in 
Figure 46-1.
4.	
Type your four-digit number on the 
numeric keypad that appears on 
the screen. A second Set Passcode 
screen appears, asking you to re-
enter your four-digit passcode.
5.	
Type your four-digit number again. 
The Passcode Lock screen appears, 
as shown in Figure 46-2.
6.	
(Optional) Tap Require Passcode. 
The Require Passcode screen 
appears, as shown in Figure 46-3.

Modifying Your Passcode
At any time, you can modify your passcode to change the four-digit code or 
change the time limit before your passcode locks down your iPhone.
Changing Your Passcode
For security reasons, it’s a good idea to change your four-digit passcode periodi-
cally. That way, if someone has guessed or stolen your passcode, you can change 
it to lock that person out of your iPhone. To change your passcode, follow these 
steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings screen appears.
2.	
Tap General. The General screen appears.
3.	
Tap Passcode Lock. The Enter Passcode screen appears.
4.	
Type your current four-digit passcode on the numeric keypad that appears 
on the screen. The Passcode Lock screen appears.
5.	
Tap Change Passcode. The Change Passcode screen appears.
6.	
Type your new four-digit passcode. A second Set Passcode screen appears, 
asking you to re-enter your new four-digit passcode.
7.	
Type your new four-digit code again. The Passcode Lock screen appears.
8.	
Press the Home button to return to the Home screen.
Figure 46-2: The Passcode Lock 
screen lets you modify your 
passcode settings.
Figure 46-3: The Require Pass-
code screen lets you define how 
much time can elapse before 
requiring a passcode.

Project 46
Changing Your Passcode Time Limit
The default time limit is Immediately, which means as soon as your iPhone goes to 
sleep, you’ll need to type your passcode to wake it up. If this gets to be too annoy-
ing, you can choose a delayed time limit, such as After 5 minutes. Choosing a lon-
ger time limit lets you wake up your iPhone within this time limit without having to 
type your passcode. Although this makes it convenient for you to turn your iPhone 
on and off while you’re using it, it can also give others a chance to use your iPhone 
within this time limit.
To choose a different time limit for your passcode, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings screen appears.
2.	
Tap General. The General screen appears.
3.	
Tap Passcode Lock. The Enter Passcode screen appears.
4.	
Type your four-digit passcode. The Passcode Lock screen appears.
5.	
Tap Require Passcode. The Require Passcode screen appears (see 
Figure 46-2).
6.	
Tap a time limit, such as After 15 minutes or After 1 minute.
7.	
Press the Home button to return to the Home screen.
Disabling Passcode Protection
Although a passcode can help secure your iPhone, it can also make your iPhone 
less convenient to use. If you want to turn off the passcode feature altogether, 
follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Settings. The Settings screen appears.
2.	
Tap General. The General screen appears.
3.	
Tap Passcode Lock. The Enter Passcode screen appears.
4.	
Type your current four-digit passcode. The Passcode Lock screen appears.

Protecting Your iPhone with a Passcode

Additional Ideas for Protecting Your iPhone 
Passcodes can help prevent your iPhone from being accessed by unauthorized 
users, but the best way to keep others from using your iPhone is to make sure you 
never lose or misplace it. Consider buying a protective carrying case that you can 
attach to your belt. This will help keep your iPhone with you at all times, although 
there’s still the risk of misplacing it or losing it to a skilled pickpocket. 
Passcodes can also come in handy for parents who buy their children an 
iPhone. If your kids misbehave, you can passcode-protect their iPhone with a four-
digit number that they’ll never guess in a million years. This effectively renders 
their iPhone useless until you’re ready to grant them iPhone privileges again. 
Ultimately, the best protection for your iPhone is knowing where it is at 
all times and keeping it tucked out of sight whenever possible. Since using your 
iPhone will alert a potential thief, always make sure you have a secure way to carry 
your iPhone whenever you’re in a public area. 
For the truly paranoid, do what street-savvy New Yorkers do with their wal-
lets: Carry a “disposable” wallet with a little cash in it while hiding your real wallet 
somewhere safe. If a mugger wants your wallet, you can give him this disposable 
wallet. Adapting this technique, find a secure place to store your iPhone and keep 
a “dead” iPhone look-alike nearby. If someone wants to steal your iPhone, they 
may take the useless iPhone look-alike instead.
Ultimately, the best security for your iPhone is to keep an eye on it at all 
times, but consider using passcodes as an additional layer of defense to protect 
your iPhone from unauthorized users.

If you have children, they may want to share 
your iPhone or even use one of their own. 
Although you could punish your kids by forcing 
them to use a clumsier, more frustrating mobile 
phone, you might decide that torturing your 
children with other phones is too cruel. While 
giving a child an iPhone may be the ultimate in 
parental benevolence, you may not want your 
child using certain features. If you’re worried 
about outside media corrupting your child, take 
some time to make the iPhone kid friendly.
Making an iPhone kid friendly involves 
restricting access to certain features, including 
playing video with explicit content, browsing 
the Internet, watching YouTube videos, using 
iTunes, or installing new iPhone applications.
Project goal: Learn how to restrict access 
to certain iPhone features to make the iPhone 
kid friendly.

What You’ll Be Using
To restrict access to certain iPhone features, you need to use the following:
The Settings application
Blocking iPhone Features
To restrict access to certain iPhone features, you need to use a four-digit pass-
code. The only way someone (including you) can access these blocked features is 
by first typing the correct four-digit passcode. 
You can block the following features of your iPhone to make it more kid 
friendly:
>
>
Watching video or listening to audio labeled as Explicit
>
>
Accessing the Internet with the Safari web browser
>
>
Watching YouTube videos
>
>
Listening to music through iTunes
>
>
Installing iPhone applications
>
>
Taking pictures with the built-in camera
>
>
Tagging pictures with your current location
When you purchase video or audio files through iTunes, certain files may 
be tagged as Explicit due to their violent or sexual nature. It’s important to note 
that your iPhone can block only explicit video and audio files that were purchased 
though iTunes. So, for example, if you load an R-rated movie or adult-content 
audio file to your iPhone that you received from a source other than iTunes, your 
iPhone won’t recognize the file as explicit, and you won’t be able to block access 
to it. 
Blocking access to the Internet serves two purposes: First, it can keep your 
child from using the iPhone to access pornographic sites. Second, blocking Inter-
net access can also keep your child from running up huge bills by spending too 
much time on the Internet if you don’t have a flat-rate data usage plan.
You may want to block access to YouTube videos, too—not necessarily 
because they may contain adult content, but because you may not want your child 
wasting time watching music videos or silly homemade videos of someone getting 
hit in the crotch.
Besides blocking YouTube video and Internet access, you may also want to 
block iTunes access. This can keep your child from spending too much time listen-
ing to music and not paying attention to doing anything else (like studying, doing 
homework, or showing up to school every day). 
Blocking access to installing additional iPhone applications can also be 
a good idea. It can keep your kids from installing a bunch of useless applica-
tions that clutter up your iPhone. Or you may not want your kids downloading 
iPhone applications that cost money to buy. Finally, you may not want your kids to 

	
Making an iPhone Kid Friendly

download and install the multitude of 
iPhone games available, which will give 
them an excuse to waste time playing 
with their iPhone instead of doing some-
thing perhaps a bit more productive.
To block access to one or more of 
these features, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap 
Settings. The Settings screen 
appears.
2.	
Tap General. The General screen 
appears.
3.

Restricting Content
In addition to blocking access to certain features, your iPhone can also block 
access to certain content with ratings, such as movies, TV shows, or music. Just 
remember that your iPhone can only block content that comes from the iTunes 
Store. If you download content from another source, it probably won’t be tagged 
with a rating or label, so your iPhone won’t know to block it.

1.	
From the Home screen, tap 
Settings. The Settings screen 
appears.
2.	
Tap General. The General screen 
appears.

Additional Ideas for Using Restrictions on 
Your iPhone 
The main purpose of restricting access to certain iPhone features is to keep your 
kids from wasting time and corrupting their minds watching explicit video or listen-
ing to adult-content audio. However, you may also want to restrict your own access 
to certain features to avoid the temptation to waste time.
For example, suppose you’re addicted to the Internet, and you’re spend-
ing way too much time surfing when you should be working. You can simply 
Figure 47-4: You can define the 
rating for acceptable content on 
your iPhone.

Project 47
restrict access to Safari and/or YouTube and remove the temptation from your 
Home screen. 
To make this even more effective, have someone else type in a passcode 
to restrict your access to certain features. Now you won’t be tempted to turn off 
these features, since even you won’t have the proper four-digit passcode. (Just 
make sure that you trust the person restricting your access to your own iPhone, or 
else you may never gain access to those features again without completely reset-
ting your iPhone.)

Many people love keeping up with the latest 
news, whether it’s international events, political 
or business news, or just mindless entertain-
ment and celebrity gossip. If it’s something 
different and fresh, people want to learn about 
it as quickly as it they can. 
To help you keep up with the latest news, 
major news networks offer special apps that 
let you tap into their news whenever you need 
a quick update (or just need something to dis-
tract you from the boredom of waiting in line or 
sitting at your desk at work).

Additional Ideas for Keeping Up with the 
News on Your iPhone
Browse through the News category in the App Store and you’re sure to find news 
apps from other major news sources such as the Associated Press, USA Today, or 
even your local news stations and newspapers. With print newspapers scaling back 
or cutting printing altogether, the future of news is digital. By reading news from 
your favorite app, you can see just what you want to read and get it faster than any 
newspaper or magazine could ever provide.
By keeping up to date with the latest news, you can keep yourself amused 
the next time you’re waiting at a doctor’s office or bored at work. The more news 
you read, the better informed you will be. Maybe you’ll even begin to challenge 
your way of thinking or expose yourself to different points of view.

their standard cell phone.

Additional Ideas for 
Using Your iPhone 
While Traveling
Your iPhone can be more than just a 
mobile phone; it can also be a handy 
source of information the next time 
you need taxi or airline information but 
don’t want to waste time searching the 
Internet.
If you join Trapster (for free), you 
can even help report speed traps and 
notify your fellow motorists of potential 
traps. The more people are aware of the 
police, the more carefully they’ll drive, which is the whole purpose of monitoring 
traffic in the first place (other than generating revenue for the city). 
By letting your iPhone take away the hassle of traveling, you can focus on the 
fun part of traveling by sight-seeing, meeting new people, or just enjoying your 
freedom from a nine-to-five job (until you have to go back, that is). 
Figure 50-5: The Flight Sites

Since many people like to play games on their 
desktop or laptop computers, it’s no surprise 
that many people use their iPhones to play 
games as well. There are plenty of games you

Using the iChess App
The iChess app lets you play chess against your iPhone or against another person 
by turning your iPhone into a chess board, as shown in Figure 51-1. Just drag a 
piece around the board with your finger to move it to a new location.
If you want to customize the iChess app, just tap the icon in the lower-right 
corner of the screen, which resembles two gears. This displays the iChess screen, 
where you can choose the color you want to control (black or white), define the 
difficulty level of the game, change the appearance of the board, display a clock 
to time your moves, and show you statistics about your games, as shown in 
Figure 51-2.

Using the Checkers Free App
The Checkers Free app lets you play against your iPhone or a human opponent. 
When you first run the game, as shown in Figure 51-3, you can tap the Options but-
ton to change whether players are forced to make jumps. 
In case you make a mistake while playing against the iPhone or a human 
opponent, you can undo moves and learn from your mistakes. Just tap the Undo 
button in the upper-right corner of the screen, as shown in Figure 51-4. 
Using the Sudoku App
Sudoku is a deceptively simple game that involves aligning rows and columns of 
numbers between one and nine so that no two numbers appear in the same row or 
column, as shown in Figure 51-5. When you play Sudoku on your iPhone, you can 
choose different difficulty levels and keep track of your fastest times for solving the 
puzzle.
Using the WordSearch Unlimited Lite App
WordSearch Unlimited Lite is a free version of a commercial program that displays 
words hidden within a matrix of seemingly random letters. Your job is to find words 
that are hidden horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game displays a list of 
words to find, and then it’s up to you to drag your finger across letters to spell out 
those words (see Figure 51-6).

Additional Ideas for Playing Games on Your 
iPhone
The iPhone apps for chess, checkers, Sudoku, and wordsearch let you enjoy time-
tested games that nearly everyone understands and can play. Obviously, these 
aren’t the only types of games available. With the iPhone’s motion detection fea-
tures, many games even let you tilt the iPhone to control the movement of charac-
ters and objects. 
Load up your iPhone with some free games and play them the next time you 
get stuck in line somewhere. Play a game on a long airplane trip, while waiting for a 
train or bus, or anywhere you need to take a mental break.
Games can help keep you mentally sharp and active. Then again, you’re 
already pretty smart if you own an iPhone.

You can stay in touch with friends and family by 
making phone calls or sending text messages. 
Of course, your calling plan may limit you to 
a fixed number of minutes or text messages. 
Once you exceed those limits, every call or 
message will cost extra. 
Here’s a way to avoid this problem and stay 
in touch with everyone for free. By connecting 
to a Wi-Fi network (such as your home network 
or a free one in a coffeehouse), you can send 
messages and even make phone calls without 
paying anything extra. 
Project goal: Learn ways to communicate 
for free with your iPhone.

Using Skype
Skype lets you make free phone calls through the Internet, but only if you’re con-
nected to a Wi-Fi network. (Skype can’t make free calls through your cellular phone 
network.) To use Skype, you need to create a Skype account (http://www.skype
.com/). Creating an account involves defining a username and password.
Q
Q Note: You can also use Skype to call mobile or landline phone numbers. The 
only difference is that when you call a non-Skype number, you need to pay  
per minute. 
After you tap Skype from the Home screen, you’ll see five icons at the bot-
tom of the screen:
>
>
Contacts  Displays a saved list of phone numbers and usernames 
>
>
Chats  Displays any incoming or outgoing instant messages 
>
>
Call  Lets you type a phone number or Skype username to make a call
>
>
History  Displays a list of all recent calls
>
>
My Info  Displays options for customizing your profile
Customizing Your Profile
Before making a call, you may want to take some time to customize your profile, 
which can display additional information along with a picture of yourself or a visual 
image that you want to associate with yourself (such as a picture of a flower or a 
sports car). To add information about yourself or to add a picture for others to see, 
do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Skype. You may need to slide your Home screen 
to the left or right, depending on where you stored the Skype icon. 
2.	
Tap the My Info icon at the bottom of the screen. Your info screen appears, 
as shown in Figure 52-1.
3.	
Tap the Camera icon in the upper-left corner of the screen. Buttons appear 
at the bottom of the screen, giving you the option of capturing a picture 
through your iPhone’s camera or using a picture already stored on your 
iPhone, as shown in Figure 52-2.

Tap the Status button if you want to change your status to Online, Offline, or 
Do Not Disturb.
Making a Call to Another Skype User
You can make free, unlimited phone calls to other Skype users, but you’ll need to 
know their unique Skype name. Make a call to another Skype user by doing this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap Skype. You may need to slide your Home screen 
to the left or right, depending on where you stored the Skype icon. 
2.	
Tap the Contacts icon at the bottom of the screen. The Contacts screen 
appears, listing the usernames of all your saved Skype contacts.
Figure 52-1: The Info screen lets 
you modify information about 
yourself.

be able to send instant messages 
to another Skype user, which 
you can do over a cellular phone 
connection.)
If you know someone’s Skype 
username but haven’t yet stored it in the 
Contacts list, you can still retrieve it from 
the Skype directory by doing this:

you want to call and tap the Search

that person’s Skype information, as 
shown in Figure 52-5.
7.	
Tap Call to talk or tap Chat to send 
an instant message.
Using AIM
You can send instant messages through 
Skype to another Skype user, but when 
most people use instant messages, 
they usually use a dedicated messaging 
service such as AOL Instant Messenger 
(AIM). AOL offers two versions of AIM, 
a free, ad-supported version and a paid 
version without any ads. Both work identically.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of AIM is that you can send text messages to 
mobile phone numbers. That way, if you get charged for text messages or go over 
your text message limit, you can just use AIM to send text messages for free.
To use AIM, you need a MobileMe account (which you need to pay for) or a 
free AOL or AIM account. (You can set up an AIM account at http://www.aim.com/.) 
When you tap the AIM icon from the Home screen, you’ll see five icons at the bot-
tom of the screen:
>
>
Buddy List  Displays a list of AIM contacts, including bots that provide 
information such as movie theatre showtimes
>
>
Favorites  Displays a list of your favorite contacts for quick access
>
>
Contacts  Displays the names and information stored in the iPhone’s 
Contacts program
>
>
My Info  Displays options for customizing your profile and account settings
>
>
IMs  Lists all sent and received messages 
Q
Q Note: The main difference between Contacts and the Buddy List is that 
you can access your Buddy List whenever you run AIM, whether it’s on your 
computer at home, at work, or on your iPhone. Contacts just lets you access 
names stored in the Contacts application on your iPhone.

Sending a Message by Typing a 
Screen Name or Phone Number
To send a message through AIM by typ-
ing a screen name or mobile phone num-
ber, do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap AIM. 
You may need to slide your Home 
screen to the left or right, depend-
ing on where you stored the AIM 
icon. 
2.	
Tap IMs at the bottom of the 
screen. The Active IMs screen 
appears, as shown in Figure 52-6.
3.	
Tap the New Message icon that 
appears in the upper-right corner 
of the screen. The virtual keyboard 
and a new message screen appear 
so you can type an AIM screen 
name or mobile phone number to 
send a text message to. Then you 
can type a message and tap the 
Send button to send your message 
on its way.
Adding a Contact to Your 
Buddy List
If you find yourself sending messages to 
someone regularly, you might want to 
store that person’s name in your Buddy 
List by doing this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap AIM. 
You may need to slide your Home 
screen to the left or right, depend-
ing on where you stored the AIM 
icon. 
2.	
Tap Buddy List at the bottom of 
the screen. 
3.	
Tap Edit in the upper-right corner 
of the screen. A plus sign appears

as in the Family or Co-Workers 
group). 
6.	
Tap Save in the upper-right corner 
of the screen. 
7.	
Tap Done in the upper-right corner 
of the screen.
Sending a Message Using the 
Buddy List or Favorites
After you have stored screen names in 
your Buddy List, you can just tap that 
person’s screen name when you want 
to contact them instead of typing out 
a name. You can send a message to a 
saved contact by doing this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap AIM. You may need to slide your Home screen to 
the left or right, depending on where you stored the AIM icon. 
2.	
Tap Buddy List or Favorites at the bottom of the screen. (If you tap Buddy 
List, you may need to dig through various Buddy List groups, such as Co-
Workers or Family, until you find the screen name you want to use.)
3.	
Tap a screen name. The virtual keyboard and a new message screen appear 
so you can type a message.
4.	
 Tap Send in the lower-right corner of the screen.
Sending a Message from Your Contacts List
If you’ve already stored someone’s AIM screen name or mobile phone number in 
the Contacts application (see Project 37), you may find it easier to choose a name 
by doing this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap AIM. You may need to slide your Home screen to 
the left or right, depending on where you stored the AIM icon. 
2.	
Tap Contacts. The Contacts screen appears. 
3.	
Tap a name to display that person’s mobile phone or AIM screen name. 
4.	
Tap a mobile phone number or AIM screen name. The virtual keyboard and a 
new message screen appear so you can type a message. 
5.	
Tap Send in the lower-right corner of the screen.

Using TwitterFon and Twitter Trend
TwitterFon is a free app that lets you connect to Twitter so you can read and send 
tweets (updates that all your Twitter followers can read). You’ll need to set up a 
Twitter account first (http://www.twitter.com/). Twitter Trend is a free app that lets 
you spot the words people are using most often in their tweets. 
Reading and Sending Tweets Through TwitterFon
If you want to read what other people are doing, or want to send a tweet of your 
own, do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap TwitterFon. You may need to slide your Home 
screen to the left or right, depending on where you stored the TwitterFon 
icon.
2.	
Tap Friends at the bottom of the screen. The Friends screen lists all tweets 
from your friends (or strangers who call themselves your Twitter friends), as 
shown in Figure 52-9.
3.	
Tap the New Message icon in the upper-right corner of the screen. A New 
Tweet screen appears, as shown in Figure 52-10.
4.	
Type your tweet, and then tap Send in the upper-right corner of the screen 
when you’re done.

Monitoring the Most Popular 
Words on Twitter
With so many people using Twitter, you 
may be curious to see what they’re all 
talking about. To find out, do this:
1.	
From the Home screen, tap 
Twitter Trend. You may need to 
slide your Home screen to the left 
or right, depending on where you 
stored the Twitter Trend icon. The 
Twitter Trend screen appears, as 
shown in Figure 52-11.
2.	
Tap Hot, Rising, or Emerging 
at the top of the screen. The Hot 
category lists those words that are 
currently most popular. The Ris-
ing category lists those words that 
are growing in popularity, usually 
because of a major news story. 
The Emerging category lists those 
words that aren’t the most popular, 
but are steadily growing anyway.
Additional Ideas for Communicating for 
Free
By using Skype, AIM, or TwitterFon, you can stay in touch with your friends without 
ever paying a penny (not including the money you spent to buy your iPhone and 
pay your phone bill). With so many different ways to communicate, get your friends 
to stick to one method, such as Skype or AIM. Then everyone will know which pro-
gram to use for the best way to reach others.
For a more radical approach to talking for free, use one of the apps men-
tioned in this chapter to arrange a time to meet in person. Then you can actually 
talk to a real person, which may seem like a revolutionary form of communication.

Between the creation of new apps and updates 
from Apple, you’ll always have something new 
to learn about your iPhone. No book can teach 
you everything there is to know, but this book 
gave you a solid foundation so you can feel 
comfortable using your iPhone every day. After 
you get comfortable using your iPhone for basic 
tasks, you’ll be ready to learn more about how 
to use it for more specific endeavors.
Then again, you don’t have to learn every-
thing about your iPhone as long as you know 
how to do the things you need to get done. 
The iPhone comes packed with more features 
than most people will ever need or use, so you 
don’t need to waste time learning some fea-
ture just because it’s there. Use your iPhone as 
a tool to do something useful, and then get on 
with the rest of your life.
The Next 
Step

424	 |	
The Next Step
Think of this book as a gentle push in the right direction; now that you’ve 
started on your journey, it’s time for you to take off on your own. Don’t be afraid of 
making mistakes, and don’t be afraid to experiment. The iPhone is a forgiving tool, 
and if you make a mistake and find yourself looking at a screen you don’t under-
stand, just turn off your iPhone or press the Home button to get back to the famil-
iar comfort of your Home screen icons again. 
As long as you’re having fun and being productive, it doesn’t really matter 
how much or how little you know about your iPhone. All you really need is some-
thing that will help you throughout the day, and for most people, that something 
will be their constant companion: the iPhone.

My New™ Mac, Snow Leopard Edition
52 Simple Projects to Get You Started
by wallace wang
Mac OS X is a beautiful operating system, but it can be confusing to brand-new Mac own-
ers—especially if they come from Windows. Using 52 essential step-by-step projects every 
Mac owner should know, My New Mac, Snow Leopard Edition encourages readers to treat 
their new computer as an opportunity for fun and exploration, not something serious and 
overwhelming. Rather than focus each chapter on a specific program or feature of Snow 
Leopard (as most beginner books do), Wallace Wang takes a project-oriented approach that 
mirrors the sorts of things people want to do with their Mac, such as surf the Internet, send 
email, listen to CDs, take notes, or play with digital photos.

Steal This™ Computer Book 4.0
What They Won’t Tell You About the Internet
by wallace wang
This offbeat, non-technical book examines what hackers do, how they do it, and how read-
ers can protect themselves. Informative, irreverent, and entertaining, the completely revised 
fourth edition of Steal This Computer Book contains new chapters that discuss the hacker 
mentality, lock picking, exploiting P2P filesharing networks, and how people manipulate 
search engines and pop-up ads. Includes a CD with hundreds of megabytes of hacking and 
security-related programs that tie in to each chapter of the book.

The Manga Guide™ to Physics
by hideo nitta, keita takatsu, and trend-pro co., ltd.
The Manga Guide to Physics teaches readers the fundamentals of physics through authentic 
Japanese manga. Megumi, an all-star tennis player, is struggling in physics class. Luckily for 
her, she befriends Ryota, a patient physics geek who uses real-world examples to help her 
understand classical mechanics. Readers follow along with Megumi as she learns about the 
physics of everyday objects like roller skates, slingshots, braking cars, and tennis rackets. 
As the book progresses, Megumi begins to master even the toughest concepts of physics, 
like momentum and impulse, parabolic motion, and the relationship between force, mass, 
and acceleration. Using a lively and quirky approach, The Manga Guide to Physics combines 
a whimsical story with real educational content so that readers will quickly master the core 
concepts of physics with a minimum of frustration.
