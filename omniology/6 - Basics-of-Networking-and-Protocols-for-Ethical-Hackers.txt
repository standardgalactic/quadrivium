BASICS OF NETWORKING AND
PROTOCOLS FOR ETHICAL HACKERS
Networking is the foundation of digital
communication, 
connecting 
billions 
of
devices worldwide and facilitating data
exchange on an immense scale.
Mastery 
of 
IP 
addresses, 
subnetting,
transport layer protocols, ports, and DNS is
crucial for ethical hackers to identify
vulnerabilities, 
manipulate 
data, 
and
protect digital pathways.
The OSI model with its seven layers serves
as a roadmap for understanding network
communication, guiding ethical hackers
through the intricacies of networking.
