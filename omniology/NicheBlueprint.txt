Introduction
In this Niche Blueprint I will tell you exactly how you are going to target 
your copycat sites within this Macro Download Niche.  
I will start by telling you how to divide the macro niche in sub niches first. 
After that I will tell you exactly how you should target these sub niches on 
your copycat sites for the best results.
IMPORTANT: Once again  You could go many directions with how you 
target your sub niches on your copycat sites. I recommend just doing as I 
will reveal to you in this blueprint. Keep the experimenting for a later 
moment! 

Dividing the Macro Niche in Sub Niches
Let’s have a look at for instance download.com again:
Sites like download.com have huge lists of programs that can be 
downloaded for free.
Download.com has top lists of the programs that are most popular and 
they also have all programs nicely listed in categories.
The first step you should take to get up your copycat sites is selecting a 
few good programs from the extensive lists of free programs that are 
offered nowadays on the net (100k+). There are many download sites 
like download.com.  You could get your information from other download 
sites as well.

I recommend to start with 25 copycat sites so choose 25 free downloads 
for every copycat site one!
These are 25 programs for which I have copycat sites running. (I 
recommend you to choose your own programs though. It’s just a few 
seconds work)

Once again search traffic on these free downloads are AMAZING. I 
guess only for this 25 program a millions per day. I guess you get the 
point.
You only have to grab a small part of the cake and you get thousands of 
visitors per day to your copycat sites that are floating around on the 
internet (what if you setup 100 or 200 copycat sites)

Turning these programs into a sub niche
Once you have selected  your programs you have to turn them into a 
niche or subniche.
Of course we could say the program names themselves are a good 
niche. But I feel like it is too general still.
We are going to target our copycat sites with these programs for the ‘free 
download” sub niches. These two words “free” and “download” are the 2 
words that are mostly used when people look for these programs.

I wouldn’t use the version numbers of the programs, but just the 
program name. No more, no less.
•
I will also go over this in the Copycat Sites Blueprint. But targeting 
your copycat site for for example Download Realplayer Free. 
Doesn’t mean you have to use that exact phrase all the time.  Play 
with the order of the words.
