Preface
The focus of this book is on electroactive polymer (EAP) actuators and sensors. 
The book covers the introductory chemistry, physics, and modeling of EAP 
technologies and is structured around the demonstration of EAPs in robotic 
applications. The EAP field is experiencing interest due to the ability to build 
improved polymeric materials and modern digital electronics.  To develop robust 
robotic devices actuated by EAP, it is necessary for engineers to understand their 
fundamental physics and chemistry.

1.1 Introduction 
In this time of technological advancements, conventional materials such as metals 
and alloys are being replaced by polymers in such fields as automobiles, aerospace, 
household goods, and electronics. Due to the tremendous advances in polymeric 
materials technology, various processing techniques have been developed that 
enable the production of polymers with tailor-made properties (mechanical, 
electrical, etc). Polymers enable new designs to be developed that are cost-
effective with small size and weights [1].  
Polymers have attractive properties compared to inorganic materials.  They are 
lightweight, inexpensive, fracture tolerant, pliable, and easily processed and 
manufactured. They can be configured into complex shapes and their properties 
can be tailored according to demand [2]. With the rapid advances in materials used 
in science and technology, various materials with intelligence embedded at the 
molecular level are being developed at a fast pace. These intelligent materials can 

2 
R. Samatham et al. 
sense variations in the environment, process the information, and respond 
accordingly.  Shape-memory alloys, piezoelectric materials, etc. fall in this 
category of intelligent materials [3]. Polymers that respond to external stimuli by 
changing shape or size have been known and studied for several decades. They 
respond to stimuli such as an electrical field, pH, a magnetic field, and light [2]. 
These intelligent polymers can collectively be called active polymers.
One of the significant applications of these active polymers is found in 
biomimetics—the practice of taking ideas and concepts from nature and 
implementing them in engineering and design. Various machines that imitate birds, 
fish, insects and even plants have been developed. With the increased emphasis on 
“green” technological solutions to contemporary problems, scientists started 
exploring the ultimate resource—nature—for solutions that have become highly 
optimized during the millions of years of evolution [4]. Throughout history, 
humans have attempted to mimic biological creatures in appearance, functionality, 
intelligence of operation, and their thinking process. Currently, various biomimetic 
fields are attempting to do the same thing, including artificial intelligence, artificial 
vision, artificial muscles, and many other avenues [5]. It has been the dream of 
robotic engineers to develop autonomous, legged robots with mission-handling 
capabilities. But the development of these robots has been limited by the complex 
actuation and control and power technology that are incomparable to simple 
systems in the natural world. As humans have developed in biomimetic fields, 
biology has provided efficient solutions for the design of locomotion and control 
systems [6]. Active polymers with characteristics similar to biological muscles 
hold tremendous promise for the development of biomimetics. These polymers 
have characteristics similar to biological muscles such as resilience, large 
actuation, and damage tolerance. They are more flexible than conventional motors 
and can act as vibration and shock dampers; the polymers are similar in aesthetic 
appeal too. The polymers’ physical makeup enables the development of 
mechanical devices with no gears, bearings, or other complex mechanisms 
responsible for large costs and complexity [5].  
Active materials can convert electrical or chemical energy directly to 
mechanical energy through the response of the material. This capability is of great 
use in rapidly shrinking mechanical components due to the miniaturization of 
robots [7]. Realistically looking and behaving robots are believed possible, using 
artificial intelligence, effective artificial muscles, and biomimetic technologies [8]. 
Autonomous, human-looking robots can be developed to inspect structures with 
configurations that are not predetermined. A multifunctional automated crawling 
system developed at NASA/JPL, operates in field conditions and scans large areas 
using a wide range of NDE instruments [9]. 
There are many types of active polymers with different controllable properties, 
due to a variety of stimuli. They can produce permanent or reversible responses; 
they can be passive or active by embedment in polymers, making smart structures. 
The resilience and toughness of the host polymer can be useful in the development 
of smart structures that have shape control and self-sensing capabilities [2]. 
Depending on the type of actuation, the materials used are broadly classified as 
nonelectrically deformable polymers (actuated by nonelectric stimuli such as pH, 
light, temperature, etc.) and electroactive polymers (EAPs) (actuated by electric

inputs). Different types of nonelectrically deformable polymers are chemically 
activated polymers, shape-memory polymers, inflatable structures, light-activated 
polymers, magnetically activated polymers, and thermally activated gels [2]. 
Polymers that change shape or size in response to electrical stimulus are called 
electroactive polymers (EAP) and are classified depending on the mechanism 
responsible for actuation as electronic EAPs (which are driven by electric field or 
coulomb forces) or ionic EAPs (which change shape by mobility or diffusion of 
ions and their conjugated substances). A list of leading electroactive polymers is 
shown in Table 1.1.

Conducting polymers (CP) 
Carbon nanotubes (CNT) 
The electronic EAPs such as electrostrictive, electrostatic, piezoelectric, and 
ferroelectric generally require high activation fields (>150V/ȝm) which are close to 
the breakdown level of the material. The property of these materials to hold the 
induced displacement, when a DC voltage is applied, makes them potential 
materials in robotic applications, and these materials can be operated in air without 
major constraints. The electronic EAPs also have high energy density as well as a 
rapid response time in the range of milliseconds. In general, these materials have a 
glass transition temperature inadequate for low temperature actuation applications.  
In contrast, ionic EAP materials such as gels, ionic polymer-metal composites, 
conducting polymers, and carbon nanotubes require low driving voltages, nearly 
equal to 1–5V. One of the constraints of these materials is that they must be 
operated in a wet state or in solid electrolytes. Ionic EAPs predominantly produce 
bending actuation that induces relatively lower actuation forces than electronic 
EAPs. Often, operation in aqueous systems is plagued by the hydrolysis of water. 
Moreover, ionic EAPs have slow response characteristics compared to electronic 
EAPs. The amount of deformation of these materials is usually much more than 
electronic EAP materials, and the deformation mechanism bears more resemblance 
to a biological muscle deformation. The induced strain of both the electronic and 
ionic EAPs can be designed geometrically to bend, stretch, or contract [2]. 
Another way to classify actuators is based on actuator mechanisms. The various 
mechanisms through which EAPs produce actuation are polarization, mass/ion 
transportation, molecular shape change, and phase change. Dielectric elastomers 
and piezoelectric polymers produce actuation through polarization. Conducting 
polymers and gel polymers produce actuation basically through ion/mass 
transportation. Liquid crystal elastomers and shape-memory polymers produce 
actuation by phase change.  
As can be observed, various stimuli can be used to actuate active polymers. 
Development of polymers that can respond to a noncontact mode of stimuli such as 

4 
R. Samatham et al. 
electrical, magnetic, and light can lead to the diversification of the applications of 
active polymers. Electrical stimulation is considered the most promising, owing to 
its availability and advances in control systems. There has been a surge in the 
amount of research being done on the development of electro-active polymers 
(EAPs), but other kinds of stimulation have their own niche applications.  
Initially, the electrical stimulation of polymers produced relatively small 
strains, restricting their practical use. But nowadays, polymers showing large 
strains have been developed and show great potential and capabilities for the 
development of practical applications. Active polymers which respond to electric 
stimuli, electroactive polymers (EAPs), exhibit two-to-three orders of magnitude 
deformation, more than the striction-limited, rigid and fragile electroactive 
ceramics (EACs). EAPs can have higher response speed, lower density, and greater 
resilience than shape-memory alloys (SMAs). However, the scope of practical 
applications of EAPs is limited by low actuation force, low mechanical energy 
density, and low robustness. Progress toward actuators being used in robotic 
applications with performance comparable to biological systems will lead to great 
benefits [2].  
In the following paragraphs, all types of active polymers are briefly described 
and thoroughly reviewed in cited references. Also, some of the most recent 
developments for certain polymers are presented. Some of the applications of 
active polymers are given as well.  
1.2 Nonelectroactive Polymers 
1.2.1 Chemically Activated Polymers 
A polymer can change in dimension by interacting with chemicals, but it is a 
relatively slow process. For example, when a piece of rubber is dropped into oil, it 
slowly swells by interacting with the solvent [2]. 
The first artificial muscle was a pH actuated polymeric gel developed in 1950. 
Since then, a wide variety of polymer gel materials have been developed that can 
respond to stimuli such as pH, temperature, light, and solvent composition. The 
interaction with surroundings causes a change in shape or size of these polymers. 
Some of these polymers are sensitive to pH in aqueous environments.  
Most of the earlier work on the gel muscles was done on pH actuation. Cross-
linked polyacrylic acid gel is the most widely studied polymer for chemical 
actuation. This gel increases dimensionally when moved from an acid solution to a 
base solution and shows weak mechanical properties. To find stronger polymers, 
different materials were developed during the last 20 years.  
Yoshida et al. [10] developed an oscillating, swelling-deswelling, pH-sensitive 
polymer gel system. Rhythmic swelling-deswelling oscillations were achieved by 
coupling temperature and pH-sensitive poly (N-isopropylacrylamide-co-acrylic 
acid-co-butylmethacrylate) gels with nonlinear oscillating chemical reactions. A 
pH-oscillating reaction was generated in a continuous-flow-stirred tank reactor, in 
which the pH of the system changed after a specific time interval.  When polymer 
gels are coupled with reactions in a reactor, an oscillating response is produced.

One of the interesting materials in the this family is the polyacrylonitrile (PAN) 
gel fiber [11], which when oxidized and saponified shows behavior similar to that 
of polyacrylic acid gels. The strength of the PAN fibers is higher, and the response 
time is minimal. A change in length of 70% was observed in a few seconds when 
the system was moved from an acid to a base, which is very fast compared to 
polyacrylic acid gels (which could take days or weeks). A volume change of more 
than 800% was observed for PAN fibers [12]. Moreover, among the available 
polymer based actuator materials, PAN fiber is already produced commercially in 
large volumes and used in the production of textiles and as a precursor for making 
carbon fibers. Coupled with a simple activation process, the easy availability of 
PAN fiber makes it one of the most suitable materials for use in the development 
of practical applications. It was found that when fibers transform into gels, they 
have stronger mechanical properties and larger volume change, more closely 
resembling biological muscle than any other polymer gel actuators [11]. The 
diameter of commercially available PAN fiber is on the order of microns in its 
swollen state, so the response time is rapid as the response depends on the 
dimension (diameter) of the fibers. The response characteristics of the PAN fibers 
were found superior to other chemically activated polymer materials, but still not 
comparable to the response characteristics of skeletal muscles. To improve the 
response characteristics, sub-micron diameter PAN fibers were produced using a 
process called “electrospinning.” Macroscopic observation of a PAN nanofiber mat 
made from electrospinning showed more than 600% deformation in a few seconds, 
but the mechanical properties of electrospun fiber-mat were found to be poorer 
than the commercial PAN fibers. Typically, the PAN fibers used in those of the 
textile industry are co-polymerized with a small amount of another polymer such 
as acrylamide, methyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate; therefore, there may be some 
differences in the mechanical properties of such modified PAN fibers. Efforts are 
underway to improve the mechanical properties and observe the deformational 
characteristics of the fibers on a microscale. The use of these PAN fibers has more 
potential in the development of the linear actuators and artificial muscles. For 
example, the force to weight ratio from experimentation in our lab showed that 
0.2g of PAN fiber (5g in an activated state) can generate more than 150gmf (30–
750 times of one weight) [13].   
1.2.2 Shape-Memory Polymers 
Shape-memory materials are stimuli-responsive materials that change shape 
through the application of external stimuli. The thermally-induced shape-memory 
effect is used widely. Thermally responsive shape-memory polymers change shape 
when heated above a certain temperature and can be processed into two shapes. 
One form, the permanent shape, is obtained through conventional processing 
techniques such as extrusion and injection molding. During this process, the 
material is heated above the highest thermal transition temperature (Tperm). The 
phase above Tperm forms physical cross-links which enable the polymers to form 
permanent shapes. The second phase fixes the temporary phase, acting as a 
molecular switch. The switching segments can be fixed above the transition 
temperature (Ttrans), either the glass transition temperature (Tg) or the melting 

6 
R. Samatham et al. 
temperature (Tm). This transition temperature is usually less than Tperm. The 
material can be formed into a temporary shape by thermal processing or cold 
drawing and cooling below the transition temperature. When the material is heated 
above the Ttrans, the physical cross-links in the switching phase are broken, forcing 
the material into a permanent shape known as recovery [14]. The operation of a 
shape-memory polymer is schematically depicted in Figure 1.1.  
Figure 1.1. Cartoon showing one-way shape-memory effect produced by thermal activation. 
The permanent shape is transformed into a temporary shape through a programming 
process. The permanent shape is recovered when the sample is heated above the switching 
temperature. 
As early as the 1930s, scientists discovered that certain metallic compounds 
exhibited the shape-memory effect when heated above a transition temperature. 
Since then, shape memory alloys (SMAs), such as the nickel-titanium alloy, have 
found uses in actuators and medical devices, such as orthodontic wires that self-
adjust and stents for keeping blood vessels open. Despite their broad range of 
applications, SMAs are expensive and nondegradable, and in many cases, lack 
biocompatibility and compliance, allowing for a deformation of about 8% for Ni-Ti 
alloys [15]. 
Linear, phase-segregated multiblock copolymers, mostly polyurethanes, are the 
commonly used shape-memory polymers. Note that the shape-memory effect is not 
the property of one single polymer, but it is a combined effect of polymer structure 
and polymer morphology along with processing and programming technology. 
Programming refers to the process used to fix the temporary phase.  The shape-
memory effect can be observed in polymers with significantly different chemical 
compositions. A significant, new development in the design of shape-memory 
polymers is the discovery of families of polymers called polymer systems. The 
properties of these polymer systems can be tailored for specific applications by 
slightly varying their chemical composition [14]. The memory effect of shape-
memory polymers is due to the stored mechanical energy obtained during 
reconfiguration and cooling of the material [16]. 
Shape-memory polymers (SMPs) are finding applications in varied fields from 
deploying objects in space to manufacturing dynamic tools [16]. The versatile

characteristics of SMPs make them ideal for applications in dynamic configurable 
parts, deployable components, and inexpensive, reusable custom molds [16]. One 
type of SMP is the cold hibernated elastic memory (CHEM) structure that can be 
compressed into a small volume at a temperature higher than the glass transition 
temperature (Tg) and stored at temperatures below this Tg. When this material is 
heated again above Tg, the original volume of the structure is restored. Volume 
ratios of up to forty times have been obtained [2]. Structures having different sizes 
and shapes can be erected by the self-deployable characteristics of these CHEM 
materials due to their elastic recovery and shape-memory properties. One of the 
advantages of these materials is that they are a fraction of their original size when 
compressed and stored below Tg and are lightweight. Commercial applications of 
these materials include building shelters, hangars, camping tents, rafts, and outdoor 
furniture. CHEM materials have good impact and radiation resistance as well as 
strong thermal and electrical insulation properties. One of the disadvantages of 
these materials is their packing needs: a pressure mechanism which may not be 
available readily in the outdoors, where they are most applicable [2]. 
Biodegradable and biocompatible SMPs are being developed which have 
tremendous potential in the development of minimal, invasive surgery technologies 
[14]. The permanent shapes of these fibers are programmed into a wound stitch, 
stretching to form thin fibers. This fiber is then heated above the transition 
temperature of the material inducing permanent deformation in the material sealing 
the wound. Biodegradable shape-memory polymers also show strong promise for 
implantable devices in biomedical applications [17]. 
1.2.3 Inflatable Structures 
Pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs, often called McKibben muscle) can be 
defined as contractile linear motion gas  pressured engines. Their simple design is 
comprised of a core element that is a flexible reinforced closed membrane attached 
at both the ends to the fittings, acting as an inlet and an outlet. Mechanical power is 
transferred to the load through the fittings. When the membrane inflates due to gas 
pressure, it bulges outward radially, leading to axial contraction of the shell. This 
contraction exerts a pulling force on its load. The actuation provides unidirectional 
linear force and motion. PAMs can be operated underpressure or overpressure, but 
they are usually operated overpressure as more energy can be transferred. In 
PAMs, the force generated is related to the applied gas pressure, whereas the 
amount of actuation is related to the change in the volume. Therefore, the 
particular state of PAM is determined by the gas pressure and length [18]. The 
unique, physical configuration of these actuators gives them numerous variable-
stiffness, spring like characteristics: nonlinear passive elasticity, physical 
flexibility, and light weight [19]. Like biological muscles, they are pull-only 
devices and should be used in antagonistic pairs to give better control of the 
actuation. Using an antagonistic pair provides control of the actuator stiffness 
allowing a continuum of positions and independent compliances. Like a human 
muscle, stiffness can be increased without change in the angle at the joint, giving 
an actuator control of both its stiffness and compliance [6].

PAMs, which are only one membrane, are extremely light compared to other 
actuators. Their power-to-weight ratio of 1 kW/kg was observed. They have easily 
adjustable compliance depending on the gas compressibility and varying force of 
displacement. PAMs can be directly mounted onto robot joints without any gears, 
eliminating inertia or backlash. They are easy to operate without such hazards as 
electric shock, fire, explosion and pollution.  
The design of PAMs dates back as far as 1929, but, due to their complex design 
and poor reliability, they did not attract the attention of the research community. 
One of the most commonly used PAMs is the McKibben muscle (Figure 1.2, [20]) 
also called braided PAM (BPAM) due to its design and assembly. The muscle 
consists of a gas-tight bladder or tube with a double helically braided sleeve around 
it. The change in the braid angle varies the length, diameter, and volume of the 
sleeve. BPAMs have been widely used for orthotic applications because their 
length–load characteristics are similar to those biological muscles, but, due to the 
lack of availability of pneumatic power storage systems and poor valve technology, 
the interest in McKibben muscles has slowly faded in the scientific community. 
The Bridgestone Co. in Japan reintroduced the BPAMs for industrial robotic 
applications such as the soft arm, and Festo AG introduced an improved variant of 
PAM.     
Figure 1.2. Braided muscle or McKibben muscle 
Most of the PAMs used are in anthropomorphic robots, but various weak points 
exist in the design of braided muscle. They show considerable hysteresis due to the 
friction between the braid and shell, causing an adverse effect on the behavior of 
actuator, and a complex model is needed to determine the characteristics. PAMs 
generate low force and need an initial threshold pressure to generate actuation. 
They are plagued by low cycle life, but their generated force, threshold pressure 
and life cycle are dependent on material selection. The wires in the sleeve also 
snap from the ends during actuation, and they have limited actuation capacity (20 
to 30%). A new design of PAM called netted Muscle (ROMAC) was designed to 
have better contraction and force characteristics with little friction and material 
deformation, but they have complex designs [18].

Figure 1.3. Schematic of a pleated, pneumatic artificial muscle in a stretched and inflated 
state 
Another new PAM called pleated PAM (PPAM) (Figure 1.3) has a membrane 
rearrangement.  The membrane is folded along its central axis to form an accordion 
bellows that unfurls during the inflation of the membrane. The membrane is made 
of a highly tensile, flexible material. Both ends of the membrane are tightly locked 
to the fittings. This design eliminates friction and hysteresis because the folded 
faces are laid out radially so the unfolding of the membrane needs no energy, 
giving a higher force output. PPAMs were found to be strong, operating with a 
large stroke and virtually no friction. They are very light in weight; a 60 g actuator 
pulls a 3500 N load and are easy to control when providing accurate positioning. 
PPAMs provide safe machine-man interaction. By using the right material, the 
material deformation can be eliminated while getting high tensile forces. 
Depending on the number of pleats, a uniform membrane loading can be obtained. 
As the number of pleats increases, a more uniform loading can be obtained. 
PPAMs need low threshold pressure to give high values of maximum pressure 
output. A maximum contraction of 45% was obtained that depended on the 
slenderness of the material [18].  
A short actuation response time can be obtained to improve the flexibility of the 
actuator by employing high flow rate valves. This will occur through the 
development of a better closed-loop controller. These valves will be large and 
heavy and need high control energy which leads to a decrease in the energy 
efficiency of the whole system [19]. The diameter of the usable, transferable tubing 
is limited by the increase in gas viscosity, which increases the diameter. The 
flexibility is also compromised by large diameter tubing, and the efficiency of the 
system depends on the gas sources. Gas can be obtained from a reservoir or 
compressor motor or engine, or from a low-pressure reservoir with a heating 
chamber. The use of a compressor with a motor or engine will decrease the energy 
efficiency of the system and make it heavy and noisy. Using a heat chamber with a 
gas reservoir will enable higher efficiency as the heat energy is directly converted 
to mechanical energy [19].  
It was found that the static characteristics of actuators are very similar to those 
of biological muscles, but actuators have a narrow, dynamic range. Actuators can 
be improved by employing lubricants to decrease the coulomb friction and viscous 

10 
R. Samatham et al. 
material is used to increase the viscous friction. One of the positive aspects of 
actuators is their high tension intensity compared to biological muscles. Their 
passive elastic characteristics can be improved using parallel and serial elastic 
elements. The pneumatic system used to drive the actuator needs more work to 
improve the efficiency of the whole system, and a lighter valve that can give a high 
flow rate needs to be designed. A light, quiet gas source with reasonable energy 
efficiency is needed, and to solve the tubing length and wrapping problem, better 
integration of tubing needs to be developed [19].  
One of the main limitations of BPAMs for practical applications is short fatigue 
life (~10,000 cycles). Festo Corporation built a fluidic muscle to have a longer 
fatigue life by impregnating the fiber mesh into an expandable bladder [6]. The 
bladder, made from natural latex, was found to have 24 times more life than a 
synthetic silicone rubber bladder [2]. 
McKibben muscles have attractive properties for the development of mobile 
robots and prosthetic applications [21]. Most of the models used to predict the 
characteristics of McKibben muscles are concentrated on the effect of the braided 
sheath, but introducing the properties of the bladder into the design gave improved 
prediction of properties such as output force. A mathematical model is needed to 
understand the design parameters and improve desirable properties such as output 
force and input pressure, while minimizing undesirable properties such as fatigue 
properties. By coupling the effect of the properties of the braid and bladder, the 
performance prediction of the actuator was improved. Still, some discrepancies 
observed between the predictions of the model and the experimental results are 
believed to be due to mechanisms of elastic energy storage, the effects of friction 
between the bladder and braid, and friction between the fibers of the braid. The 
above effects are believed to be functions of   the properties of braid and bladder, 
the actuation pressure, and the instantaneous actuator length [21].  
A cockroach like robot with reasonable forward locomotion was built using 
only a feed-forward controller without any feedback circuit. The passive properties 
of BPAMs compensate for controller instabilities, acting as filters in response to 
perturbations, without the need for intervention of a controller. The speeds of 
BPAMs are higher when compared to biological muscles which are inherently 
slow because of neurological inputs [6].  
1.2.4 Light Activated Polymers 
The phenomenon of dimensional change in polyelectrolyte gels, due to chemically 
induced ionization, is explained by mechanochemistry. The deformation of 
polyelectrolyte gels produced by light-induced ionization was observed and labeled 
as the mechanophotochemicaleffect [22]. Observed irradiation with ultraviolet 
light caused the gel to swell by initiating an ionization reaction, developing an 
internal osmotic pressure. The gel collapsed when the light was removed and 
switched to its neutral state. The phase transition observed was slow due to the 
slow photochemical ionization and subsequent recombination of ions [23]. Phase 
transition due to visible light was observed later so harmful ultraviolet rays could 
then be eliminated when performing a phase transition.

Active Polymers: An Overview 
11 
Poly(p-N,N-dimethylamine)-N-gamma-D-glutamanilide) produces a dilation of 
35% in each dimension, when exposed to light [22]. When irradiated for 10 
minutes, poly(methylacrylate acid) gels buffered with cis-trans photoisomerizable 
(p-phenylazophenyl)trimethylammonium iodide dye produced a 10% elongation. 
The physical properties governing the deformation are (1) high polymeric 
amorphous or crystalline structures; (2) distinguishing features of porous, cross-
linked gel matrices; and (3) suitable combinations of ionizeable groups. While (1) 
and (2) cannot be manipulated, the deformation properties of the gels can be 
controlled through (3).  The deformation produced is independent of the stimuli 
used for ionization. The main demand on photoionization is that the charged 
species produced should have a sufficiently long life span to induce deformation; 
therefore, a suitable photoionization technique should be used.  
A high-intensity light source is needed to produce meaningful concentrations of 
ions [22]. The observed transition was due to direct heating by the radiation, giving 
fast response. Gels were made from N-isopropylacrylamide with a light-sensitive 
chromophore and trisodium salt of copper chlorophyllin, and a 100-micrometer 
inner diameter capillary was used to form the gels. The phase transition 
experiments were carried out in a glass chamber where the temperature can be 
controlled within a ±0.1oC range. Argon laser radiation with a 488 nm wavelength 
was used, and the light intensity varied from 0–150 mW. The incident beam had a 
Gaussian diameter of ~7 mm and focused diameter of ~20 ȝm, using a lens with a 
19 cm focal length. At a temperature of ~35oC, the gels gave a sharp, but 
continuous, volume change without any radiation. The transition temperature 
decreased as the intensity of light radiation increased. A more pronounced volume 
change was observed at a temperature of 33oC when a 60 mW light was applied, 
and discontinuous volume transition was observed with 120 mW of radiation. The 
light-sensitive gels collapsed when radiation in the visible wavelength was used 
(Figure 1.4 [22]). Shrinkage was observed throughout the whole temperature 
range, but the largest effect was observed at a transition region. A discontinuous 
transition was observed at an appropriate “bulk” equilibrium temperature, when the 
intensity was varied from 0–150 mW [22]. The light intensity at the transition state 
varied from gel to gel, believed to be due to the variation in the ratios of gel and 
beam diameters or bleaching conditions [23].  
The effect of irradiation was observed to transform continuous transition to 
discontinuous 
transition 
and 
decrease 
the 
transition 
temperature. 
The 
chromophores incorporated in the gel absorb light energy and dissipate heat locally 
by causing radiationless transitions, increasing the local temperature of the 
polymer. The temperature increase in the gel, due to radiation, is proportional to 
the light intensity and chromophore concentration [23]. The rate of observed 
deformation was dependent on the intensity of the light source and was found to be 
due to dilation instead of phase transition induced by photoionization. A 5% cross-
linked polymer was too stiff to produce photo-deformation, but deformation was 
observed with 1.5% cross-linking. Potential applications envisaged include 
printing, photocopying and actinometry [22]. It was observed that the phase 
transitions were due to the radiation forces instead of local heating, as observed 
previously. A direct influence on the balance of forces was caused when a gel was 

12 
R. Samatham et al. 
irradiated with a laser beam and became shrinkage in the gel.  The shear relaxation 
process induced gel shrinkage of several 10s of microns [24].  
Figure 1.4. Cartoon showing the collapse of a light-activated gel under illumination  
The combination of stimuli-responsive polymer gels and laser lights enables the 
development of a new gel-based system for actuation and sensing applications. It is 
known that radiation force immobilizes particles against Brownian motion and any 
convection [24]. These photoresponsive gels are used in such applications as 
artificial muscles, switches, and memory devices [23].  
Azobenzene polymers and oligomers show surface relief features, when 
irradiated with polarized laser light. An atomic force microscope investigation of 
the amplitude mask irradiation of side-chain azobenzene polymers showed 
trenches and peaks, depending on the architecture of the polymer. Mass was 
transferred long distances, enabling the development of nanostructure replication 
technology. This technology, using polarized light, allows the storage of 
microscopic images as topographic features on produced polymer surfaces [25].  
Extensive research is being conducted to discover other polymeric materials 
that change volume due to light exposure. These polymers are considered to be 
made of “jump molecules”—molecules that change in volume due to light 
exposure. Experiments have revealed that the volume change is not due to the 
heating of the water of hydration in the gel; instead, it is considered due to the 
contraction obtained by the attraction between the excited molecules in the 
illuminated region and surrounding molecules. Therefore, shrinkage is due to laser-
induced phase transitions [2].

1.2.5 Magnetically Activated Polymers 
Sensitive polymeric materials showing strain due to changes in the magnetic field 
are called magnetoelastic or magnetostrictive polymer materials, also often called 
ferrogels. The gradient of the magnetic field applied acts as the driving force [26].  
A magnetic field induces forces on all kinds of materials; solid materials 
experience more forces than fluids. By combining fluidlike and solidlike properties 
in a material, the effect of magnetic force can be enhanced [3]. A magneto-
controlled medium can be considered a specific type of filler-loaded swollen 
network. Ferrogels are a chemically cross-linked polymer network, swollen by a 
ferrofluid, which is a colloidal dispersion of monodomain, magnetic particles. In 
these gels, the magnetic particles are attached to the polymer chains by strong 
adhesive forces [26]. Under a uniform magnetic field, no net forces are observed 
on the gel, except the Einstein-de Haas effect which is caused by a change in the 
magnetic field vector. When these gels are subjected to a magnetic field gradient, 
the particles experience a net force toward the higher magnetic field. These 
particles carry the dispersing fluid and polymer network with them, producing a 
macroscopic deformation of the gel. Elongation, contraction, bending, and rotation 
can be obtained depending on the geometric arrangement of these materials. With 
their ability to create a wide range of smooth motions along with quick operation 
and precise controllability, these magnetic fields controlling soft and wet gels show 
good promise in the development of stimuli-responsive gels and actuators [26].  
Electric and magnetic field-induced shape and movement was obtained in a 
polymer gel with a complex fluid as the swelling agent. Magnetic particles were 
incorporated into poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) and poly(vinyl alcohol) gel beads. 
The beads aligned as a chainlike structure in uniform magnetic field lines, and they 
aggregated in a nonuniform field due to magnetophoretic force. These magnetic 
gels give quick and controllable changes in shape, which can be exploited in 
applications mimicking muscular contraction [3]. The use of polymer gels as 
actuators creates a quick and reliable control system, and the use of electric or 
magnetic stimuli facilitates the development of these control systems.  
A PVA gel, with magnetic nanoparticles, contracted in a nonuniform magnetic 
field (Figure 1.5 [26]), which is smaller than the field strength observed on the 
surface of common permanent magnets. By coordinating and controlling the 
magnetic field, muscle-like motion can be obtained, leading to the development of 
artificial muscles [3]. To better exploit these materials, the basic relationship 
between the magnetic and elastic properties of these materials should be 
investigated. The applied magnetic field on the gel can be better controlled using 
an electromagnet, where the current intensity gives the controllability. The 
relationship between deformation and current intensity needs to be determined for 
the efficient use of electromagnets [26].  

14 
R. Samatham et al. 
Figure 1.5. A schematic representation of the setup used to study the magnetoelastic 
properties of ferrogels 
In a ferrogel, magnetic particles are under constant, random agitation when not 
under a magnetic field. Due to this random agitation, there is no net magnetic field 
in the material. It was observed that the magnetization of the ferrogel is directly 
proportional to the concentration of the magnetic particles and their saturation 
magnetization. In small fields, it was determined that the magnetization is linearly 
dependent on the field intensity, whereas in high fields, saturation magnetization 
was achieved [26].  
For a ferrogel suspended along the axis of the electromagnet, the elongation 
induced by a nonuniform magnetic field depends on a steady current flow. A very 
small hysteresis was observed. It was determined that the modulus of the ferrogel 
is independent of the field strength and the field gradient. The relationship between 
elongation and current intensity found was a function of cross-linking densities as 
well. For small uni-axial strains, the elongation produced is directly proportional to 
the square of the current intensity [26]. The response time is only one-tenth of a 
second and observed to be independent of particle size. Ferrogels are generally 
incompressible and do not change in volume during activation [2]. Voltairas et al.
[27] developed a theoretical model, in constitutive equations, to study large 
deformations in ferrogels when the hysteresis effect was not considered. This 
model can be used for quantitative interpretation of the magnetic field’s dependent 
deformation of ferrogels for valve operations [27].

Through induction, magnetically heated, triggerable gels have been developed, 
where the heat generated from various loss mechanisms in the gel produces a 
thermal phase transition. The loss mechanisms include ohmic heating from eddy 
current losses, hysteresis losses, and mechanical (frictional) losses. Volume change 
was observed in these materials when a quasi-static (frequency of 240 kHz to 3 
MHz) magnetic field was applied. When the field is removed, the gel returned to 
its initial shape, due to cooling of the material. Power electronic drives are being 
developed which will aid in the development of closed-loop servomechanisms for 
actuators. These materials show the potential in contact-less actuation and 
deformation wherever the magnetic field can reach, e.g. triggering gels under the 
skin [28, 29, 32]. 
MR rubber materials are being used in the development of adaptively tuned 
vibration absorbers, stiffness-tunable mounts and suspensions, and automotive 
bushings. These materials usually show continuously controllable and reversible 
rheological properties while under an applied magnetic field [30]. 
Magnetic polymers, with magnetic particles dispersed in a rubber matrix, have 
been used in magnetic tapes and magnetic gums for more than three decades [31].  
1.2.6 Thermally Activated Gels 
Thermally activated gels produce a volume change due to thermal phase 
transitions, usually within a temperature range of 20oC to 40oC. These polymers 
exhibit a contractile force of 100 kPa with a response time of 20–90 seconds [2]. 
Most of the studies on thermal phase transitions of gels were done on N-substituted 
polyacrylamide derivatives. Hirokawa and Tanaka (1984) first reported the volume 
phase transition of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) gel [69].  
Poly(vinyl methyl ether) (PVME) is one of the most widely used thermo-
responsive polymers. It undergoes phase transition at 38oC; at a temperature below 
the phase-transition temperature, PVME is completely soluble in water. The 
polymer precipitates with an increase in the temperature, and the polymer network 
is transformed from a hydrophilic to a hydrophobic structure. When a gel was 
employed, the transition produced a volume change. PVME can be cross-linked 
into a hydrogel by gamma-ray radiation. High-energy radiation is the one of the 
most widely used methods to make cross-linked polymer hydrogels. With an 
increase in the temperature, water is expelled from the gel network, causing it to 
shrink. The volume phase transition, induced by temperature change, can be 
exploited in the development of thermoresponsive soft actuators, thermo-
responsive separation, etc. [33].  
The deformation characteristics of a thermoresponsive hydrogel can be 
controlled by incorporating surfactants, or ionic groups, into a polymer network. 
The deformation properties of the hydrogel vary depending on the type and 
concentration of the surfactant or ionic groups. Quick, responsive thermo-
responsive hydrogels are being developed using porous PVME gels, which swell 
and shrink much faster than homogeneous gels. A 1 cm cube of PVME porous gel 
showed a response time of 20–90 seconds, with a change in temperature from 10–
40oC, where as a homogenous gel showed no response within the same time 

16 
R. Samatham et al. 
period. PVME porous gels show potential in the development of practical actuating 
devices due to this rapid temperature change [33].  
Thermally sensitive polymer gels show great potential in the development of 
artificial muscles. Hot and cold water can be used for actuation, a favorable option 
compared to acid and base in chemically activated polymer gels. As the 
temperature increases, the swelling ratio of the PVME gel fiber decreases; this 
reaction increases as the temperature nears the transition point. A contractile force 
of 100 kPa was generated when the temperature was raised from 20 to 40oC [33].  
Figure 1.6. Automatic gel valve made of a thermoresponsive gel, which allows only hot 
water through the pipe 
Thermoresponsive polymer gels are being studied for different applications. 
Modified NIPAAm gels are being developed for metered drug release by thermally 
controlling drug permeation. Gels can be used as a substrate for the immobilization 
of enzymes. In thermoresponsive gels, the activity of the immobilized enzyme was 
controlled by thermal cycling. Artificial finger and gel valve models were also 
developed using thermoresponsive polymer gels. The gel valve shrinks to allow 
only hot water while blocking the flow of cold water [33]. The solid-phase 
transition of a polymer was also used in the development of paraffin-based 
microactuators. Although large thermal expansion at the solid–liquid phase 
transition is a general property of long-chained polymers, the low transition 
temperature of paraffin was exploited in these actuators, using micromachining 
techniques which allow the production of many actuators on the same die. A 
deflection of 2.7 micrometers was obtained using a 200–400 micrometer radius 
device with a response time in the range from 30–50 milliseconds [34].   
Thermally activated microscale valves are being developed for lab-in-a-chip 
applications. These valves will open and close due to a temperature-change 
induced phase transition (Figure 1.6). The valves also provide an advantage in

production using lithographic techniques; noncontact actuation, which employs 
heating elements; or using heat from the fluid itself [35]. 
1.3 Electroactive Polymers 
As stated earlier, since the last decade there has been a fast growing interest in 
electroactive polymers.  The non-contact stimulation capability, coupled with the 
availability of better control systems that can use electrical energy, is driving the 
quest for the development of a wide range of active polymers. These polymers are 
popularly called electroactive polymers (EAPs), and an overview of various types 
of EAPs is given in the following sections.  
1.3.1 Electronic EAPs 
Based on the mechanism of actuation, EAPs are classified into electronic and ionic 
EAPs. Various characteristics of electronic EAPs have been discussed in previous 
paragraphs, but an overview of electronic EAPs is covered in this section.  
1.3.1.1 Ferroelectric Polymers  
Ferroelectric materials are analogous to ferromagnets, where the application of an 
electric field aligns polarized domains in the material. Permanent polarization 
exists even after the removal of the field, and the curie temperature in ferroelectric 
materials, similar to ferromagnetic materials, disrupts the permanent polarization 
through thermal energy [36].  
Poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)) is commonly used 
ferroelectric polymer. Local dipoles are created on the polymer backbone due to 
the high electronegativity of fluorine atoms.  Polarized domains are generated by 
these local dipoles aligning in an electric field. The alignment is retained even after 
the removal of electric field, and the reversible, conformational changes produced 
by this realignment are used for actuation [36].  
The polymers have a Young’s modulus of nearly 1–10 GPa, which allows high 
mechanical energy density to be obtained. Up to 2% electrostatic strains were 
obtained with the application of a large electric field (~200 MV/m) which is nearly 
equal to the dielectric breakdown field of the material [2]. Up to a 10% strain was 
observed in ferroelectric polymers during the transition from the ferroelectric phase 
to the paraelectric phase, but the presence of hysteresis is a drawback. Hysteresis in 
ferroelectric materials is due to the energy barrier present when switching from one 
polarization direction to the other or when transforming from one phase to another 
[37]. A large field, in a direction opposite to the initial field, is required to reverse 
the polarization, dissipating substantial energy [36].  
The energy barrier can be significantly reduced by decreasing the size of the 
coherent polarization regions to the nanoscale. This reduction is achieved by 
introducing defects in the polymer chains, which are created by electron radiation. 
Proper high electron irradiation eliminated the large hysteresis, and exceptionally 
large electrostatic strain was achieved. It is crucial to note that effective structures, 
induced by electron irradiation, cannot be recovered by applying a high electric 

18 
R. Samatham et al. 
field. For soft material, Maxwell stress can generate high strains. Ferroelectric 
polymers show better performance in strain and strain energy density compared to 
traditional piezoceramic and magnetostrictive materials [37]. Ferroelectric relaxors 
are practical, useful materials which show strong performance characteristics. 
When the Curie point in these materials is brought near to room temperature–the 
normal operating temperature–a nonpolar, paraelectric phase is present.  This is 
achieved by introducing imperfections in the structure either by using radiation or 
incorporating a disruptive monomer along the chain [36]. These imperfections 
break the long-range correlation between the polar groups. Polarization is induced 
when an electric field is applied to these materials, but, due to the decrease in the 
energy barrier to the phase change, the hysteresis is reduced or eliminated [36].
The large molecular conformational changes (introduced) associated with the 
ferroelectric-to-paraelectric transition lead to macroscopic deformations that are 
used to generate actuation [36]. 
P(VDF-TrFE) contracts in a direction of the field and expands in the direction 
perpendicular to the field. The strain can be enlarged by prestraining, and moderate 
strains (up to 7%), with high stresses (reaching 45 MPa) have been achieved. High 
stiffness (70.4 GPa) was achieved but was dependent on the density of 
imperfections and a large work per cycle (approaching 1 MJ.m-3) [36]. 
Ferroelectric polymers are easy to process, cheap, lightweight, and conform to 
complicated shapes and surfaces, but the low strain level and low strain energy 
limit the practical applications of these polymers [37]. Ferroelectric polymers can 
be easily patterned for integrated electronic applications. They adhere to wide 
variety of substrates, but they are vulnerable to chemical, thermal, and mechanical 
effects [38]. Ferroelectric EAPs can be operated in air, a vacuum, or water in a 
wide range of temperatures [2].  
Limitations of ferroelectric polymers include fatigue of the electrodes, high 
electric fields, and high heat dissipation. Procurement of the fluorocarbons is also a 
problem due to environmental restrictions, and the e-beam irradiation process is 
expensive. The maximum strain of the polymers can be achieved only at an 
optimal loading condition that is dependent on the material used. This strain can 
decrease substantially above and below the optimal value [36].   
The potential use of ferroelectric polymers can be extended by decreasing their 
operating potential. This can be achieved by using thin films (100 nm) or by 
increasing the dielectric constant. The film thickness is limited by the relative 
stiffness of the electrode material but can be overcome by using more compliant 
electrodes. The dielectric constant can be increased by adding high dielectric 
constant filler material. The operating temperature depends on the density of 
imperfections, which can be fine-tuned up or down to change the temperature 
range of operation. The typical range is between 20 and 80oC [36]. Instead of 
electrostatic energy, heat can also be used to activate ferroelectric polymers. 
Reversible actuation can be obtained when the materials are heated and cooled 
above and below their Curie points, which is just below room temperature [36].  
1.3.1.2 Dielectric Elastomers 
Dielectric elastomer actuators are made with an incompressible and highly 
deformable dielectric medium. When an electric field is applied across the parallel 

Active Polymers: An Overview 
19 
plates of a capacitor, the coulombic forces between the charges generate a stress, 
called the Maxwell stress, causing the electrodes to move closer. This movement 
squeezes the elastomer, causing an expansion in the lateral direction[39]. Dielectric 
elastomers are often called electrostatically stricted polymers (ESSP) actuators [2]. 
Figure 1.7 illustrates the operational mechanism of a dielectric elastomer with 
compliant electrodes. Dielectric elastomers show efficient coupling between 
electrical energy input and mechanical energy output [36]. Also, applying prestrain 
to dielectric elastomers can prevent the motion along an arbitrary direction and also 
introduce the motion to specific directions. It has also been observed that prestrain 
results in a higher breakdown potential of strains.  These materials can be used as 
both actuators and sensors. With careful design, efficiencies as high as 30% can be 
obtained and be operated satisfactorily over large temperature ranges (e.g. silicone 
–100 to 250oC). Operation below the glass-transition temperature leads to the loss 
the of elastic characteristics of the material. Three commercially available 
materials are Dow Corning HS3 Silicone, Nusil CF 19-2186 Silicone, and 3M 
VHB 4910 acrylic. VHB is available in adhesive ribbons and silicones can be cast 
into thin films. The silicone surfaces are coated with conductive paint, grease, or 
powder to act as electrodes, and the typical voltages applied are in kilovolts 
(~10 kV) with currents in the range of  less than several milliamperes [36]. 
Extensive theoretical and experimental studies have been done by de Rossi et al.
[40] to characterize the effect of different electrodes and prestrain on the dielectric 
elastomers. The data presented help in the selection of the best electrode and 
prestrain values to obtain efficient response for different ranges of electric fields 
[40]. 
            
Figure 1.7. Operating principle of a dielectric elastomer 
In general, the strain induced in a material is proportional to the square of the 
electric field and the dielectric constant. One of the ways to induce large strains is 
to increase the electric field, but the high electric fields involved in the actuation of 
dielectric elastomers can result in dielectric breakdown of the material. The strain 
can be increased using either a material with a high dielectric constant or films 
with low thicknesses. An electric breakdown field is defined as the maximum 
electric field that can be applied to dielectric elastomers without damaging them 
[41]. It was observed that the breakdown field increases with the prestrain of the 
elastomer. Dielectric elastomers require high electric fields for actuation 
(~100 V/ȝm), and it is a challenge to increase the breakdown strength of the 
elastomer at these fields. The small breakdown strength of air (2–3 V/ȝm) presents 
an additional challenge [36].

An actuator with three degrees of freedom (DOF) made of a dielectric 
elastomer, was developed recently. The structure has a wound helical spring with a 
dielectric elastomer sheet. The electrodes are patterned into four sections which 
can be connected to respective driving circuits. With this arrangement, the actuator 
can bend in two directions and also extend, giving it three degrees of freedom. 
Much larger deflections can be obtained from the above, and other envisaged 
applications include speakers (tweeters), pumps, and legged walking robots [36].  
A newly designed lightweight, hyperredundant manipulator was developed 
which is driven by dielectric elastomers [41]; i.e. can produce precise and discrete 
motions without the need for sensing and feedback control. The manipulator 
showed great potential in the development of miniaturized actuators that have high 
DOFs; these binary robotic systems can have various applications from robotics to 
space applications. Dielectric elastomers are in the advanced stages of 
development for practical microrobots and musclelike applications, such as the 
biomimetic actuator developed by Choi et al. [42], which can provide compliance 
controllability [42].  
The development of practical applications of dielectric elastomers requires the 
development of models for their design and control. The modeling of dielectric 
elastomers involves multiphysics, including electrostatic, mechanical, and material 
terms [43].  
1.3.1.3 Electrostrictive Graft Elastomers 
The electrostrictive graft elastomer is a new type of electroactive polymer 
developed in the NASA Langley Research Center in 1999 [44]. The graft 
elastomer consists of two components: flexible macromolecular backbone chains 
and crystallizable side chains attached to the backbone, called grafts (Figure 
1.8(a)). The grafts on the backbone can crystallize to form physical cross-linking 
sites for a three-dimensional elastomer network and to generate electric field-
responsive polar crystal domains (Figure 1.8(b)). The polar crystal domains are 
primary contributors to electrostromechanical functionality. When the materials is 
under an electrical field, the polar domains rotate to align in the field direction due 
to the driving force generated by the interaction between the net dipoles and the 
applied electric field.  The rotation of grafts induces the reorientation of backbone 
chains, leading to deformational change and the polar domains randomize when the 
electric field is removed, leading to dimensional recovery.  The dimensional 
change generated demonstrates quadradic dependence on the applied electric field 
as an electrostrictive material does [44].  
From the experimental observations [44], it was noted that the negative strains 
were parallel to electric field and positive strains were perpendicular to the field. 
The same deformation was observed for a 180o shift in the electric fields, and the 
direction of strains remained unchanged. The amount of strain is dictated by the 
electric field strength [44]. According to Wang et al. [45], the deformation of the 
graft elastomers can be described by considering two mechanisms: crystal unit 
rotation and reorientation of backbone chains. Crystal unit rotation draws the 
backbone chains toward themselves, causing an increase in the atomic density near 
the crystal units, that causes a negative strain. Local reorientation of backbone 
chains was considered to occur in three stages. In the first stage, a negative strain is 

Active Polymers: An Overview 
21 
generated in the direction parallel to the electric field and a positive strain 
perpendicular to the electric field. In the second stage, a positive strain is generated 
in both directions. In the third stage, negative strains will also be generated in both 
directions, due to the Maxwell stress effects [45].  
Figure 1.8. Schematic showing (a) molecular  structure and (b) morphology of a grafted 
elastomer
One of the distinctive properties of graft polymers compared to other 
electrostrictive polymers is their high stiffness. Polyurethane has a modulus 
between 15 and 20 MPa, whereas modules of a graft elastomer are around 550 
MPa, approximately thirty times more [44]. This property can be exploited in the 
development of an actuator that provides higher output power and mechanical 
energy density. Electrostrictive graft elastomers offer large electric-field-induced 
strains (4%) [44] and have several advantages such as good processability and 
electrical and mechanical toughness. Various bending actuators based on bilayers 
have been designed and fabricated. The sensitivity studies done by Wang et al.
[45] showed that for a bilayer bending actuator, the curvature of the beam can be 
tailored by varying the thickness of the active layer. In this study, a 10% decrease 
in the thickness of active layer gave 30% more curvature in the beam. 
An electrostrictive-piezoelectric multifunctional polymer blend was developed 
[44] that exhibits high piezoelectric strain and large electric-field induced strain 
responses. A material with the above combination can function both as an 
electrostrictive actuator and a piezoelectric sensor [72]. Various electrical, 
mechanical, and electromechanical properties of these elastomer-piezoelectric 
blend systems can be optimized by adjusting the composition, molecular design, 
and processing techniques [73].  
1.3.1.4 Electrostrictive Paper 
Paper, as an electrostrictive EAP (EAPap) actuator, was first demonstrated at Inha 
University, Korea [2]. The EAPap was made by bonding two silver-laminated 
papers with silver electrodes placed on the outside surfaces (Figure 1.9). A bending 
displacement was produced when an electrical field was applied to the electrodes. 
The performance of the actuator depends on the host paper, excitation voltage, 

22 
R. Samatham et al. 
frequency and type of adhesive used to bond the papers. Fabrication of these 
lightweight actuators is quite simple [2].  
Figure 1.9. Schematic of the electrostrictive paper cantilever actuator 
The successful development of a paper actuator for practical applications requires 
addressing various issues such as small displacement output, large excitation 
voltage, sensitivity to humidity, and performance degradation with time. In the 
initial studies, the electrostrictive effects were observed to be dependent on the 
adhesives used to make laminated layers. Different types of paper fibers such as 
softwood, hardwood, cellophane, and Korean traditional paper, all tested with 
various chemicals, were used to improve the bending performance of an EAPap 
actuator [46]. To eliminate the predominant effect of the electrodes, two different 
techniques were studied: the direct adhesion of aluminum foil and the gold-
sputtering technique. It was determined, owing to the lower stiffness, that gold-
sputtered electrodes gave better performance than aluminum foil electrodes. The 
paper with more cellulose, in an amorphous structure, gave a stronger response 
than the paper with crystalline cellulose. Cellophane gave a better response 
because of its amorphous cellulose with a low degree of polymerization. A 
combination of the piezoelectric effect and the ionic migration effect both 
associated with the dipole moment of the paper constituents is considered 
responsible for the strain observed in electrostrictive paper [46]. Although 
electrostriction may be an important mechanism of actuation, studies are needed to 
elucidate the fundamental physics of the actuation principle. 
Various applications envisaged include active sound-absorbing materials, 
flexible speakers, and smart shape-control devices [2]. One of the unique 
applications being considered for the EAPap paper is an electronic acoustic tile, 
which broadcasts antinoise to cancel out sound or white noise in a room.  
1.3.1.5 Electroviscoelastic Elastomers 
Electroviscoelastic elastomers are the solid form of an electrorheological fluid 
(ER), which is a suspension of dielectric particles. When these ER fluids are 
subjected to an electric field, the induced dipole moments cause the particles to 
form chains in the directions of the field, forming complex anisotropic structures. 
During this process, the viscosity of the fluid increases greatly. An ER solid is 
obtained if the carrier in the ER fluid is polymerized. By careful selection, the 
carrier can be an elastomeric material and result in an electroviscoelastic elastomer. 
The ER elastomers have stable anisotropic arrangements of polarizable particles 
[2]. When an electric field is applied in the chain direction, these particles tend to 

Active Polymers: An Overview 
23 
move toward each other, creating stress, which causes deformation of the 
materials. Work can be obtained by opposing this deformation.  
ER gels have unique advantages compared to ER fluids: no leakage, no 
sedimentation of particles, and ease of fabricating custom-made shapes and sizes. 
The key aspects of the structure of ER materials that are important for performance 
include the size and shape of particles, the dielectric properties, and the 
organization of the particles.  
The numerical analysis of the ER response showed that it is strain dependent, 
and its response depends on the interparticle forces that increase as the particle 
spacing decreases [47]. It was observed that a polymer with low carrier density and 
mobility in an electric field would form an ideal matrix, and maximum ER 
responses can be observed when the particles align as a body-centered structure.
Metallic particles can be considered ideal due to their high polarizability, but 
their high density and conductivity precludes their use in ER fluids. This problem 
was eliminated in ER elastomers by maintaining enough gaps between particles in 
the elastomer to avoid a short circuit and by swelling the cured elastomer with 
curable silicone prepolymers [47]. The prepolymer acted as insulation between the 
particles to prevent shorts in the chain direction. The trapped particles in the 
swollen polymer act as isolated dipoles. The combined effect of these dipoles gives 
better performance.  
Diluents were added to reduce viscosity and to increase swelling of the gel; the 
modulus of the gel doubled with an application of a 2 kVmm-1 field, with only a 
1% particle concentration. Potential applications include actuators, artificial 
muscles, smart skins and coating, displays, switches, valves, etc. [47]. 
1.3.1.6 Liquid Crystal Elastomers 
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCE) can be activated by electrical energy applied 
through joule heating. LCEs are composite materials made of a monodomain 
nematic liquid crystal elastomer with conductive polymers distributed in the 
network structure [2]. In LCEs, actuation is produced through the stresses 
generated by the order change and alignment of liquid-crystalline side chains. 
These alignment changes are due to the phase changes induced by thermal or 
electrostatic energy [36]. Usually, flow induced in liquid crystals by stress fields 
prevents the build up of static forces. In liquid crystal elastomers, the liquid crystal 
molecules are bonded to cross-linked polymer backbones. This flexible polymer 
backbone allows the polymer chains to reorient themselves but prevents the flow of 
molecules leading to the build up of static forces that produce stresses and strains. 
These stresses are instead transferred, via the polymer backbone, to do mechanical 
work. This reorientation of the mesogens can be induced by temperature changes 
or by the application of an electric field [36]. The response times are typically less 
than a second, but the relaxation process is slower, in the range of 10 seconds. 
Cooling is needed to expand the material to its original dimensions [2].  
In a thermally driven system, the rate-limiting factor is the heat transfer time 
constant that is governed by the thermal diffusivity of the base material. It is 
expected that the rate is proportional to the inverse of the square of thickness of the 
flat films. A time constant of 0.25 and 0.5 seconds was observed for a 100 ȝm
thick flat film with heat transferred on one side, where as a time constant < 0.125 

24 
R. Samatham et al. 
seconds was observed when heat was transferred from both sides. A time constant 
in microseconds may be obtained by using thin films (~1 ȝm) [36]. Efforts are 
underway to decrease the nematic isotropic transition temperature to below sub-
ambient to obtain an effective elastic response [2]. 
The mesogen units in ferroelectric liquid crystals have intrinsic polarization or 
an anisotropic dielectric constant. These LCEs contract or expand in an electric 
field due to the reorientation of the mesogen units which induce bulk stresses and 
strains in the backbone. A better response can be obtained in electrostatically 
driven films because the electric field can be applied very quickly through the bulk 
of the material [36]. 
Factors influencing the response time include specific mesogens, the structure 
of the polymer backbone, and the degree of cross-linking. Faster responses can be 
obtained with smaller mesogens that have less cross-linked matrices [36]. Fast 
response time (~10ms) and large strains (~45%) were obtained from 
electrostatically driven and thermally driven LCEs, respectively. The applied 
electric fields are lower (1.5 to 25 MV/m) compared to those used in ferroelectrics 
and dielectric elastomers (approx 100 MV/m). Faster responses can also be 
obtained by irradiative heating of a thermally driven LCE film, but the cooling is 
still by conduction which is relatively slow in thick samples [36]. A reduction in 
response time was also demonstrated by employing a photoabsorption mechanism 
without the least effect on mechanical properties. The LCE films are coated with a 
thin layer of carbon on the surfaces to absorb more light energy and increase the 
absorption of heat by radiation [48]. Generally, the LCE samples consisted of 50–
200 ȝm thick monodomain films, where the measured contraction stress, strain, 
and frequency gave values of 210 kPa, 45% and subsecond relaxation time, 
respectively. Optimization of the mechanical properties of these materials can be 
achieved through the effective selection of the liquid crystalline phase, the density 
of cross-linking, the flexibility of the polymer backbone, the coupling between the 
backbone and the liquid crystal group, and external stimuli [2]. 
LCEs are in the early stages of development, but it is known that due to the low 
stiffness and tensile strength of these materials, a relatively small change in load 
can induce large strains. Laser heating can be used to overcome the limitations 
caused by heat transfer during thermal actuation but at the cost of reduced 
efficiency [36]. LCEs are being studied to develop membranes that can separate 
right-handed and left-handed forms of drugs in the pharmaceutical industry [49]. 
Along with applications in artificial muscles and actuators, the elastomers can also 
be developed to be mechanically tunable optical elements. A swimming motion 
was obtained when a light was shone on a dye-doped LCE sample floating on 
water [50].  
LCEs exhibit piezoelectric behavior: when the liquid crystals are in a smectic 
phase, the mesogens arrange themselves in a distinctive layered structure. The 
mesogens within a layer form a smectic C phase by tilting to one side at a constant 
tilt angle, and if the mesogen has a chiral center near the core, the chirality breaks 
symmetry in the unit cells, creating a degree of polarity without an external field. 
This material exhibits ferroelectric behavior in response to spontaneous 
polarization. The production of piezoelectric sensors and actuators from LCEs is 
easy because they do not require poling [2].

1.3.2 Ionic-EAPs 
The following paragraphs give a brief overview of the various “ionic” electroactive 
polymers being developed. 
1.3.2.1 Ionic Polymer Gels 
As stated in the chemically activated polymer section, pH activated polymers such 
as PAN hold tremendous promise in actuator technology. However, pH changes 
using chemical solutions typically cause deformation of gels and are somewhat 
inconvenient. The formation of salts is inevitable due to the chemical reaction 
between the acid solution and the basic solution. The salts created may be attached 
to the polymer surface and block contact between the polymer chain and the 
protonated hydrogen ion environment, affecting the response time. The chemical 
actuation of synthetic gels is undesirable except in some underwater applications, 
and the development of the electrically driven system makes it a potential material 
in robotic applications. Control of the electrically driven system is easy, and the 
electrochemistry of the system comes into to play when electrical actuation is 
considered.  
Electrical actuation of polymeric gels was first studied by Tanaka et al. [51] on 
polyacrylic acid gels. The gel changed shape and size when placed between 
electrodes that were surrounded by an aqueous solution. The gel shrank near the 
anode when it touched the electrode, but when the gel was not touching an 
electrode, it swelled near the anode. The phenomenon can be reversed by reversing 
the polarity of the electric field. The electrolysis of water is considered to affects 
the pH of the solution near the electrodes and can be superimposed on the electrical 
response of the gel actuators. Due to electrolysis, the region near the cathode (a 
negative electrode) will become more basic, as OH- is released. Similarly, the 
region near the anode will become more acidic. Due to this phenomenon, when the 
gel system is placed near the anode, it will contract. The bending of an acrylic 
acid-acrylamide copolymer gel was observed by Shiga and Kurauchi [52] when the 
gel was placed between the electric field in aqueous solution.  
Note that the response of gels is not a material property but rather is dependent 
on the dynamics of the electrolytic reactions of the system, the geometry of the 
system, the composition of the electrolyte and electrodes, and the previous history 
of the gel. A detailed study of the relationship between the electric field and the 
volume change mechanism of polymer gels is needed to determine the possibility 
of building a practical mechanical system with an electrically induced 
polyelectrolyte actuator and to better control an electrochemically driven gel 
actuator that is free from undesired chemical reactions. Poor mechanical properties 
of ionic gels are a major constraint in the development of practical applications.  
Electrical activation of PAN fiber bundles has been studied by Schreyer et al.
[53]. When the PAN muscle is near the anode side, the muscle shrinks, and when 
in the cathode vicinity, the PAN fiber is elongated. The elongation and contraction 
is done simply by changing the polarity. Furthermore, using a high-conductivity 
material–such as graphite or platinum coating–the PAN fiber itself can be used as 
an electrode. The advantage of this method is that the control motion of the PAN 
actuator is quite simple; the disadvantage is that the conductive material on the 

26 
R. Samatham et al. 
PAN surface is delaminated after three to four cycles. The actuation is completely 
stopped after the conductive material is wiped out [13]. 
For electrochemically driven PAN filaments, it was observed that the diameter 
changes in PAN filaments are quite similar to the pH activated ones, but with a 
longer response time (approximately ten minutes). Single strands of fibers 
produced an approximate force of 10 gmf for both aforementioned activation 
methods and have similar standard deviation ranges. Force generation reached a 
steady state within a few seconds of the chemical activation system. On the other 
hand, it took approximately 10 minutes for the force generation to reach a steady 
state in the electrochemically-driven system [13]. Efforts are currently underway to 
improve the response characteristics utilizing submicron-diameter electrospun 
PAN fibers. Actuation of ionic polymer gels is slow due to the required diffusion 
of ions, and the large displacement produced by electrodes deposited on the gel 
surface causing damage. Better performance can be obtained by using thin layers 
and robust electroding techniques [2]. Figure 1.10 shows an electochemically 
driven PAN crane system [70].

before and (right) after 20minutes [70] 
1.3.2.2 Ionic Polymer-Metal Composite (IPMC) 
Ionic polymer-metal composites have been studied extensively in the past 15 years. 
Oguro et al. [54] initially determined that the composite of a polyelectrolyte 
membrane-electrode, which is a perfluorinated, sulfonate membrane (Nafion® 
117) chemically coated with platinum electrodes on both sides of the membrane, 
deforms and bends when a low voltage (~1–5V) is applied across the electrodes in 
an aqueous solution [55]. A change in the ion concentration, induced by an electric 
field, attracts water and causes deflection toward one of the metal electrodes. 
Swelling occurs on one side and shrinkage on the other side due to the nonuniform 
distribution of water in the polymer electrolyte network [36].  
An ion exchange membrane (IEM) forms the bulk of the material of the IPMC. 
IEMs are permeable to cations but impermeable to anions because of the unique 
ionic nature of the fixed perfluorinated polymer backbone. Different membranes 
can be used to make IPMCs, but the most commonly used are NafionTM from 
DuPont, USA and Flemion from Asahi, Japan. The primary applications of these 
polymers are in fuel cells used in hydrolysis. Nafion can exchange H+ with other 

Active Polymers: An Overview 
27 
cations. The top and bottom electrode surfaces are formed when the metal ions are 
reduced by exchanging H+ ions with metal ions. These two metallic surfaces have 
good conductivity and can be manipulated by the chemical process. IPMC’s cross 
section resembles a sandwich with electrode layers outside and a polymer matrix in 
the center [55]. 
An ionic polymer consists of a fixed network with negative charges, balanced 
by mobile positive ions. The polymer network consists of pockets of solvents, and 
two, thin boundary layers are generated by the application of anelectric field. A 
cation-poor layer forms on the anode side while a cation-rich layer forms on the 
cathode side. Due to the accumulation of cations on the cathode side, water 
molecules move to this side and cause hydrophilic expansion. The stresses in the 
polymer matrix cause bending toward the anode. With time, the back diffusion of 
water molecules causes a slow relaxation toward the cathode. The degree of 
actuation obtained is a function of the type of polymer used, the type of counter-
ion, the amount of water, the quality of metallization, and the thickness and surface 
area of the polymer membrane [36]. When a voltage higher than the electrolysis 
voltage of water is applied, blistering and damage to the electrodes was observed, 
causing degraded performance of the material [55].
The IPMC matrix is made of a hydrophobic polymer backbone and hydrophilic 
anionic sidechains and forms clusters of concentrated anions which neutralize 
cations and water within the polymer network. These ionic polymers, with a 
standard thickness, are commercially available. The solution-recasting technique 
developed by Kim et al. [56, 71] enabled control over the thickness of the films. 
Films with thickness in the range of 30 ȝm to 2 mm were produced. Ionic polymers 
were transformed into IPMCs by depositing metal on both sides. Metal particles 
(3–10 nm) were loaded on both sides penetrating the polymers up to 10–20 ȝm. 
These metal particles balance the charging at boundary layers. Metal particles are 
chemically loaded by soaking in Pt(NH3)4HCl and then reducing through LiBH4 or 
NaBH4. Because this process is expensive, an inexpensive loading process was 
developed by Shahinpoor and Kim (2002) [56], where metal particles are 
physically loaded with electrode layer deposition. IPMCs produced in this way 
show properties comparable to chemically loaded IPMCs. This procedure also 
gives better flexibility in the selection of the electrode material: a wide variety of 
metals such as platinum, palladium, silver, gold, carbon, and graphite can be 
deposited by this procedure. Platinum is a widely used electrode material due to its 
high corrosion resistance and its higher deflection and work densities. The metal 
electrode decreases the surface resistance and increases current densities, giving 
faster actuation. IPMCs are being developed for wide range of applications and for 
hydrodynamic propulsion. Various swimming and flapping applications have been 
also been researched [36].  
1.3.2.3 Conducting Polymers 
Conducting polymers are electronically conducting organic materials. Actuation is 
produced in these materials when the electronically changing oxidation state–
usually positive charges–leads to the flux of ions into or out of the polymer 
backbone, causing deformation. Solvent flux may also occur when there is a 
difference in ion composition. The insertion and removal of ions between polymer 

28 
R. Samatham et al. 
chains is considered the primary factor for dimensional change, whereas 
conformational change and solvent flux are considered secondary factors [36]. The 
basic structure of a conducting polymer actuator is a sandwich of two polymer 
strips with electrolyte between them (Figure 1.11). The polymer strips act as 
electrodes in electrochemical cells. When a potential is applied to the electrodes, 
oxidation occurs at the anode and reduction at the cathode. To balance the charges, 
ions are transferred into and out of the polymer and electrolyte. Swelling occurs 
when there is an addition of ions, and contraction is present when ions are 
removed. The sandwich bends when one electrode swells and the other shrinks, as 
shown in Figure 1.11 [2,57].  The chain orientation in the polymer network affects 
the rate of doping and redoping. The greater the orientation, the lower the rate of 
doping, which affects the response time of the actuators. But the higher orientation 
provides more achievable strength and modulus [57]. Linear actuators can easily be 
made by separating the electrodes from each other.  Strains in this case are 
measured to be between 2 and 20 %. 
The response of a conducting polymer actuator depends on the molecular 
diffusion when the electrodes are thick. When they are thin, the electrodes are 
limited by the RC time due to electric double-layer and electrolyte resistance 
effects. These issues can be addressed by using very thin electrodes with small 
interelectrode separation and filled with electrolytes that have high conductivity. 
By using this method, the conducting polymer actuator is a suitable material for the 
development of micromechanical actuator elements [57]. The most widely used 
conducting polymers include polypyrrole and polyaniline; thin films of these 
materials are usually produced by electrodeposition or chemical synthesis. The 
properties of these conducting polymers depend on the solvent and salt used during 
the electrodeposition synthesis. The cycle life of these polymers can be increased 
to hundreds of thousands using ionic liquid electrolytes. Forces up to tens of 
newtons are being obtained along with displacements of several millimeters. A 
displacement of 100 mm was obtained through mechanical amplification. Currents 
in the range of several hundreds of milliamperes have been used with voltages up 
to 10 V. In steady state, minimal current is needed to provide a catch state, where 
the deformation state can be held with minimal energy. This deformation can be 
exploited in robotic applications [36].  
Compared to piezoelectric materials, conducting polymers are predicted to have 
higher work densities per cycle, slightly lower force generation, lower power 
densities, and require lower operational voltages. Conducting polymers suffer from 
disadvantages such as low cycle life and energy conversion efficiency, and they 
also need electrodes with large surface areas to achieve high actuation rates. 
Various applications for conducting polymer actuators being considered by 
researchers include actuators for micromachining and micromanipulation, 
microflaps for aircraft wings, micropumps, and valves for “labs on a chip”; 
actuators for adaptive optics and steer-able catheters; and artificial muscles for 
robotic and prosthetic devices [57]. Conducting polymer actuators need low 
actuation voltage, which is a special advantage for medical actuator applications 
such as catheters or for microactuators [57]. Conducting polymers are considered a 
suitable material as a matrix for enzymes in biosensors, which is believed to 
enhance speed, sensitivity, and versatility [58]. 

Active Polymers: An Overview 
29 
Conducting polymers have several properties–high tensile strength (>100MPa), 
large stresses (34 MPa), stiffness (~1 GPa modulus), and low actuation voltage 
(~2V)–that make them attractive actuator materials. However, in general, like other 
ionic EAPs, these materials have low electromechanical coupling (<1%), leading to 
low efficiency. Their efficiency can be improved by recovering a significant 
amount of energy. The low electromechanical coupling and voltages may require 
high currents for operation, a major constraint in the development of large 
autonomous applications. Practical applicability should also address encapsulation 
issues. Moderate strains (typically ~2–9%) can be obtained by mechanical 
amplification, and a maximum strain rate of 12%/s was observed. The strain rate is 
limited by the internal resistance of polymers and the electrolytes and ionic 
diffusion rate in the polymer backbone [36]. 
Figure 1.11. Schematic representation of three states during the electromechanical cycle of 
a rocking-chair type of bimorph-conducting polymer actuator. Both electrodes have the 
same concentration of dopant (K+) when the cantilever is undistorted, and electrochemical 
transfer of dopants between electrodes causes bending either to the right or to the left.  
The response rate of a polypyrrole (PPy) conducting polymer is being improved by 
using polymers doped with bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI) and lithium 
bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide/propylene 
carbonate 
(LiTFSI/PC) 
as 
an 
electrolyte instead of water or propylene carbonate (PC). A response of 10.8% s-1
was observed, where the conventional PPy polymers gave a peak response rate of 
0.1% s-1, and a maximum strain of 23.6% was observed [59]. A linear actuator was 
developed using a PPy-metal coil composite which gave a strain of 11.6%. The 
composites provide tremendous flexibility in the design of actuators with a wide 
range of displacement and force capabilities, as they can be connected and bundled 
to suit the requirement. The composites can also be encapsulated and used in air 
[60]. 
Encapsulated polypyrrole actuators have been developed using a gel, doped 
with salt, as the electrolyte. The gel electrolyte was made of agar or polymethyl-
methacrylate (PMMA) and gave good actuation responses [61]. Composite 
conducting polymers, reinforced with textile fibers such as polyester-PPy or nylon-
PPy, have good electrical properties and good structural properties, similar to 
textile fibers. These composites are believed to have great potential, with stealth 

30 
R. Samatham et al. 
and camouflage capabilities, in the design of aircraft fuselages. The composites can 
also be used in the design of continuous transport belts in coal mines, where static 
dissipation is of great importance. They are also being studied in the design of 
solar cells and displays [62]. 
1.3.2.4 Carbon Nanotube Actuators 
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) emerged as a formal EAP in 1999, bringing their 
exceptional mechanical and electrical properties to the realm of actuator 
technology [2]. Typically, single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have a 
minimum diameter of 1.2 nm but can be larger. Carbon nanotubes form bundles, 
due to van der Waal forces, are used in actuator studies, and have a typical 
diameter of 10 nm. The actuation of carbon nanotubes depends on charging the 
surface; therefore, multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are considered 
inefficient because of their less accessible surface area [36]. Actuation was 
observed in nanotubes that were suspended in an electrolyte. The change in bond 
length, due to the injection of large charges into nanotubes, is considered 
responsible for the observed deformation. In a carbon nanotube, the electron flow 
path is provided by a network of conjugated bonds connecting the carbon atoms. 
The electrolytes form an electric double layer around nanotubes, creating an ionic 
imbalance between nanotubes and electrolytes (Figure 1.12 [63]). The C-C bond 
length also increases because of the repulsion between positively charged carbon 
atoms formed by electron removal. These dimensional changes are translated into a 
macroscopic deformation in a network of entangled nanotubes. When this network 
is used, the bond length changes translate into macroscopic deformation [2]. 
Coulombic forces dominate from low to moderate levels of charging, giving a 
parabolic relationship between the strain and the applied potential. At higher 
potentials, the relationship is lost because ions and solvent in the solution start 
exchanging electrons with nanotubes, discharging the double layer. The loss of the 
double layer limits the amount of maximum strain that can be obtained from CNT 
actuators; approximately 0.1% to 1% strains were observed. The problem of low 
strain is overshadowed by the huge work densities (~200 MJ/m3) that can be 
obtained owing to the high elastic modulus (640 GPa) and enormous tensile 
strength (>>1 GPa) of these materials [36].  
Present studies are being done on nanotube sheets or papers that are composed 
of bundle of nanotubes joined by mechanical entanglement and van der Walls 
forces. Actuators are fabricated by attaching strips of a CNT sheet on both sides of 
double-sided scotch tape (a mechanism similar to the one shown in Figure 10). 
Voltage applied in electrolyte bending was observed; the direction of the bending 
reversed with a change in the direction of potential applied [63]. Due to the random 
orientation and weak van der Walls forces between the nanotubes in CNT paper, 
the properties of these fibers and sheets were many orders in magnitude less than a 
single nanotube. Advances in carbon nanotube spinning techniques are providing 
ways to make a variety of macroscopic objects for different applications. It is 
believed that the unique mechanical and electrical properties of CNT strands will 
extend to larger scales. E-textiles are being developed composed of distributed 
layers of actuator and sensor segments, each segment consisting of woven CNT-
based filament yarn sandwiched between two electrodes. These nanotube-based

fabrics are believed to provide technology for a variety of macroscopic textile 
applications such as lightweight sensor systems, membrane structures with 
actuation and shape-changing capabilities, and power generation [64].

Nanotube actuators need significantly fewer volts compared to 100s of volts 
needed for piezoelectric actuators. Nanotube actuators have been operated at 
350oC. If the mechanical properties of single nanotube can be translated to 
nanotube sheets, a strain of 1% will provide order-of-magnitude advantages 
compared to commercial actuators in work per cycle and stress generation 
capabilities. A maximum isometric actuator stress of 26 MPa was reported to work 
for a SWCNT actuator. The achievable strain is independent of an applied load, so 
the work done during constant load contraction increases linearly until the failure 
of the material occurs. High-stress applications are limited because of the creep 
effect. The potential applications of these nanotube actuators depend on the ability 
to improve the properties of nanotube sheets. These sheets are created by 
increasing the alignment and binding of the nanotubes. The strain rate of nanotube 
actuators is low compared to piezoelectrics, etc., and depends on ion diffusion [65].  
The actuation strain rate and amount of strain for carbon nanotube sheet actuators 
have been improved by employing the resistance compensation technique. In the 
resistance compensation technique, a higher input voltage is applied to compensate 
for the ohmic drop that occurs across the electrolyte [66]. The strain rate of a CNT 
actuator depends on the rate of charge injection. Due to the availability of a huge 
internal surface area, enormous capacitance exists in carbon nanotubes. To obtain 
high strain rates, one of the critical requirements is to decrease the internal 
resistance of the cell. Another factor to be considered is the speed of ion transport 
in carbon nanotube fibers and papers [36]. It appears that the rate drops rapidly in 
large devices after several seconds. The rate drops further in composite carbon 
nanotube fibers due to the slow rate of ion transport in a polymeric binder. To 
develop large nanotube actuators, electrode spacing, diffusion distances, and 
conduction paths should be minimized by microstructuring. Due to the limited 
strains obtained, mechanical amplification is needed for practical applications, but 
their limitations include the high cost of materials, low efficiency, and poor bulk

mechanical properties compared to single nanotubes [36]. At high positive 
potentials, a pneumatic mechanism was observed to provide giant actuation up to 
300% of the thickness in the direction of carbon nanotube sheets [67].    
Carbon nanotube-electroactive polymer composites are also exploited for their 
superior mechanical and electrical properties. They exhibit a deformation 
mechanism similar to polyaniline but with improved mechanical properties, 
allowing higher strains with higher stresses and mechanical energy densities [68]. 
A large electromechanical response was also reported for a carbon nanotube-
nematic liquid crystal elastomer. Carbon nanotubes were aligned along the nematic 
director during preparation, creating a very large dielectric anisotropy. A uniaxial 
stress of ~1kPa at a constant field of ~1MV/m was reported showing a potential in 
the development of electrically driven actuators [7].   
1.4. Concluding Remarks 
It can be seen from the above reported research and the scale of the academic 
interest in active polymer materials, that they have the potential to become an 
indispensable part of future technological developments. With each polymer 
having its own niche applications, they are bound to be the materials of future. 
With growing emphasis on interdisciplinary research, different active materials can 
be combined to develop tailor-made, multifunctional properties, where single 
materials can act as sensors, actuators, structural elements, etc.
To date, the robotics community has adopted only two major active polymer 
technologies: dielectric elastomers and ionic polymer-metal composites because 
the maturity of these two technologies is inevitable.  However, other technologies 
are also quite promising and leaves one the great potentials to use them in robotic 
applications. Two other technologies that the robotics community is currently 
considering are conducting polymers and electrostrictive graft elastomers.  In later 
chapters, we will focus on four major active polymer technologies: dielectric 
elastomers (Chapters 2 and 3), electrostrictive graft elastomers (Chapter 4), 
conducting polymers (Chapter 5), and ionic polymer-metal composites (Chapters 
6–10). We all expect that the robotics community will adopt other promising active 
polymer materials as their maturity and availability improve.

2.1 Introduction 
Natural muscles have self-repair capability providing billions of work cycles with 
more than 20% of contractions, contraction speed of 50% per second, stresses of 
~0.35 MPa,  and adjustable strength and stiffness [1].  Artificial muscles have been 
sought for artificial hearts, artificial limbs, humanoid robots, and air vehicles.  
Various artificial muscles have been investigated for large strain, high response 
rate, and high output power at low strain using their own material characteristics 
[2].  Among the candidates for artificial muscles, the dielectric elastomer has 
typical characteristics of light weight, flexibility, low cost, easy fabrication, etc., 
which make it attractive in many applications. Applications of dielectric elastomer 
include artificial muscles and also mobile robots, micro-pumps, micro-valves, disk 
drives, flat panel speakers, intelligent endoscope, etc. [3–7].   
Dielectric elastomer actuators have been known for their unique properties of 
large elongation strain of 120–380%, large stresses of 3.2 MPa, high specific 
elastic energy density of 3.4 J/g, high speed of response in 10-3 s, and high peak 
strain rate of 34,000%/sec [1,2,4,8]. They transform electric energy directly into 
mechanical work and produce large strains. Their actuators are composed primarily 
of a thin passive elastomer film with two compliant electrodes on the surfaces, 
exhibiting a typical capacitor configuration. As with most rubbery materials, the 
elastomer used in actuator application is incompressible (Poisson’s ratio = 0.5) and 
viscoelastic, which consequently exhibits time- or frequency-dependent 
characteristics that could be represented by stress relaxation, creep, and dynamic-
mechanical phenomena under stressed and deformed states [9–10]. When the 
electrical voltage is applied to the electrodes, an electrostatic force is generated 
between the electrodes. The force is compressive, and thus the elastomer film 
expands in the in-plane direction. 

38 
J.-D. Nam et al. 
As an advantage of dielectric elastomer actuators, the performance of elastomer 
actuators can be tailored by choosing different types of elastomers, changing the 
cross-linking chemistry of polymer chains, adding functional entities, and 
improving fabrication techniques with ease and versatility in most cases. The 
deformation of elastomers complies with the theories of rubber elasticity and 
nonlinear viscoelasticity. When an electrical field is applied, the elastomer 
deformaton is influenced primarily by the intrinsic properties of moduli and 
dielectric constants of elastomers in a coupled manner.  In addition, maximum 
actuation capabilities are often restricted by the dielectric strength (or breakdown 
voltage) of elastomer films. Although the low stiffness of elastomers may increase 
strain, maximum actuator stroke, and work per cycle, it should be considered that 
the maximum stress generation decreases with decreased moduli. Accordingly, the 
property-processing-structure relationship of elastomers especially under the 
electrical field and large deformation should be understood on the basis of the 
fundamental principles of deforming elastomers and practical experience in 
actuator fabrication.  
2.2 General Aspects of Elastomer Deformation 
Elastomers can be stretched several hundred percent; yet on being released, they 
contract back to their original dimensions at high speeds. By contrast, metals, 
ceramics, or other polymers (linear or highly cross-linked polymers) can be 
stretched reversibly for only about 1%. Above this level, they undergo permanent 
deformation in an irreversible way and ultimately break. This large and reversible 
elastic deformation makes elastomers unique in actuator applications. The 
fundamental dielectric and mechanical properties of most common elastomers are 
summarized in Table 2.1. 
Elastomers are lightly-crosslinked polymers. Without cross-linking, the 
polymer chains have no chemical bonds between chains, and thus the polymer may 
flow upon heating over the glass transition temperature. If the polymer is densely 
cross-linked, the chains cannot flow upon heating, and a large deformation cannot 
be expected upon stretching. Elastomers are between these two states of molecular 
conformation. The primary chains of elastomers are cross-linked at some points 
along the main polymer chains. For example, commercial rubber bands or tires 
have molecular weights of the order of 105 g/mol and are cross-linked every 5–
10x103 g/mol, which gives 10–20 cross-links per primary polymer molecule. The 
average molecular weight between cross-links is often defined as Mc to the express 
degree of cross-linkage. 
A raw elastomer is a high molecular weight liquid with low strength. Although 
its chains are entangled, they readily disentangle upon stressing and finally fracture 
in viscous flow. Vulcanization or curing is the process where the chains of the raw 
elastomer are chemically linked together to form a network, subsequently 
transforming the elastomeric liquid to an elastic solid. The most widely used 
vulcanizing agent is sulfur that is commonly used for diene elastomers such as 
butadiene rubber (BR), styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), acrylonitrile-butadiene 
rubber (NBR), and butyl rubber (IIR). Another type of curing agent is peroxides, 

Dielectric Elastomers for Artificial Muscles 
39 
which are used for saturated elastomers such as ethylene propylene rubber, 
chlorinated polyethylene (CSM), and silicone elastomers. The mechanical behavior 
of an elastomer depends strongly on cross-link density. When an uncross-linked 
elastomer is stressed, chains may readily slide past one another and disentangle. As 
cross-linking is increased further, the gel point is eventually reached, where a 
complete three-dimensional network is formed, by definition. A gel cannot be 
fractured without breaking chemical bonds.  Therefore, the strength is higher at the 
gel point, but it does not increase indefinitely with more cross-linking. The 
schematic of elastomer properties is shown as a function of cross-link density in 
Figure 2.1. The elastomer properties, especially the modulus, are significantly 
changed by the cross-link density in most elastomer systems, and thus the actuator 
performance can be adjusted by controlling the degree of elastomer vulcanization 
(degree of cross-link density).  The cross-link density can be adjusted by the 
kinetic variables of vulcanization reactions such as sulfur (or peroxide) content, 
reaction time, reaction temperature, catalyst (or accelerator), etc. Note that the 
elastomer vulcanization process is not a thermodynamic process but a kinetically-
controlled process in most cases.

Another significant phenomena in elastomers is the hysteresis loop of stress-strain 
curves. As seen in Figure 2.2, the stress under loading and unloading is different in 
the pathway. Furthermore, the unloading curve usually does not return to the 
origin. As the elastomer is allowed to rest in a stress-free state, the strain will reach 
the origin. It should also be mentioned that the shape of the hysteresis loop changes 
with loading-unloading cycles, especially in the early stage of cycles, eventually 
reaching an identical hysteresis loop. The hysteresis phenomena of elastomers 
should be considered in the development of actuators for long-term durability.

electrostatic pressure in Eq. (2.2) is twofold larger than the pressure in a parallel-

both the thickness and area of actuator systems.   
Actuator performance has been derived by combining Eq. (2.2) and a 
constitutive equation of elastomers. The simplest and the most common equation 
of state may combine Hooke’s law with Young’s modulus (Y), which relates the

However, it should be mentioned that Eqs. (2.4) and (2.6) are based on Hooke’s

Elastomers usually have nonlinear and viscoelastic behavior in stress-strain 
relations, and thus the performance of the elastomer actuator should be analyzed by 
using a more realistic equation of state based on the fundamental theory and 
modeling methodology of rubber elasticity.

2.4 Rubber Elasticity and Equation of State of Elastomers 
The relationships among macroscopic deformation, microscopic chain extension, 
and entropy reduction have been derived by many researchers providing 
quantitative relations between chain extension and entropy reduction [9,11,13,14].
The fundamental principle is that the repulsive stress of an elastomer arises from 
the reduction of the entropy of elastomers rather than through changes in enthalpy. 
As a result, the basic equation between stress and deformation is given as (for 
unidirectional compression and expansion)

where R is gas constant, T is temperature, and O  is the ratio of length (L) to the

, and thus it is related to the thickness strain in 
Eq. (2.3) as 
1
zs
O  
. The quantity n represents the number of active network 
chain segments per unit volume [15, 16]. It should be mentioned that the extension 
(or contraction) ratio is usually used in the description of deformation in elastomer 
systems instead of strain because the extent of deformation is relatively large. The 
quantity n represents the number of active network chain segments per unit 
volume, which is equal to 
/
c
M
U
, where U  and Mc are the density and the 
molecular weight between cross-links.  As can be seen in Eq. (2.8), the equation is 
nonlinear and consequently the Hookean relation does not hold. However, Eq. 
(2.10) is often valid for relatively small extensions in most elastomers. The actual 
behavior of cross-linked elastomers in unidirectional extension is well described by 
the empirical equation of Mooney-Rivilin [17]:

2.5 Nonlinear Viscoelasticity of Elastomers in Creep                 
and Stress Relaxation 
For the application of elastomer actuators, the prestrain condition (~50–100%) is a 
substantial factor in actuator design and application. The prestrained condition of 
elastomers can be suited to nonlinear viscoelastic creep or stress relaxation 
characteristics in a large deformation. Various theories and models have been 

44 
J.-D. Nam et al. 
developed to analyze the nonlinear viscoelastic behavior of polymers in a large 
strain [9,10,13].  Here, we will introduce several methods applicable to the 
development and analysis of elastomer actuators under prestrained or actuating 
conditions.

To describe the creep behavior of elastomers with a large deformation (~100%), 
separable stress and time functions have been proposed.  The model proposed by 
Pao and Marin is based on the assumption that the total creep strain is composed of 
an elastic strain, transient recoverable viscoelastic strain, and a permanent non-
recoverable strain [18]:

When a constant strain is applied to the elastomer actuators as a prestrain, the 
stress changes as a function of time and prestrain values.  The nonlinear stress 
relaxation behavior with a large strain has taken a rheological approach.  For

2.6 Tunable Properties of Dielectric Constant and Modulus
of Elastomers 
According to Eq. (2.5), actuator performance is directly influenced by the stiffness 
and dielectric constant of an elastomer. In terms of actuator strain, lower values of 
the modulus and higher values of the dielectric constant are desirable.  However, in 
terms of stress, the lower modulus values are not always desirable because the 
maximum stress attainable from an actuator increases with the modulus of 
elastomers.  Accordingly, the dielectric constant and modulus should be optimized 
to give the desired performance of dielectric elastomer actuators.   
The dielectric constant of elastomers can be enhanced simply by incorporating 
high dielectric materials. For example, copper phthalocyanine oligomere (CPO) 
has been blended with silicones to increase dielectric constants [2,21,22].  In this 
approach, the dielectric constant increased from 3.3 to 11.8 from the pristine 
silicone to a silicone blend with 40 wt% of CPO, which corresponds to a 250% 
increment in the dielectric constant. As discussed in Eqs. (2.4) and (2.5), the 
increased dielectric constant provides increased strain of the elastomer actuator [3]. 
However, it should be mentioned that the dielectric strength (or breakdown 
voltage) of an elastomer film is one of the most substantial factors in actuator 
applications.  Incorporating heterogeneous entities or ionic chemicals usually 
decreases the dielectric strength, and subsequently the actuator performance should 
be limited by the applicable electric fields.  Although the strain of the CPO/silicone 
blend system is increased, the maximum attainable strain is decreased by a 
deteriorated breakdown voltage [3].   
It has also been reported that the gallery height of montmorillonite (MMT), a 
layered inorganic clay nanoplatelet system forms distributed effective 
nanocapacitors when incorporated in polymers [23]. The resulting dielectric 
constant and ionic conductivity have increased by 20–4300% and two to three 
orders of magnitude, respectively, in phenolic resin/MMT nanocomposite systems 
without a significant decrease in breakdown voltage. A similar nanocapacitance 
effect has been observed in polyurethane elastomer/MMT nanocomposite systems 
exhibiting an increment in dielectric constant from 2.6 to 5.6 [24]. It should be 
mentioned that the morphology of the layered nanoplatelets determines the 
dielectric constant as well as the modulus of nanocomposite systems. When 

46 
J.-D. Nam et al. 
nanoplatelets are homogeneously dispersed (or exfoliated) in a polymer, the 
modulus is significantly increased with a slight increment in the dielectric constant.  
On the other hand, when the polymer is intercalated between nanoplatelets, the 
modulus is not much increased but the dielectric constant is increased [24].

commercial montmorillonite systems (Southern Clay Production): Na+/MMT and 
92.6 meq/100 g (d001=11.7Å), and methyl tallow bis-2-hydroxyethylammonium 
(MT2EtOH)/MMT 90 meq/100 g (d001=18.5Å), where tallow is predominantly 
composed of octadecyl chains with small amounts of low homologues (~65% of 
C18, ~30% of C16 and ~5% of C14). The layer thickness of an MMT sheet is around 
1 nm and the lateral dimensions vary from several nanometers to micrometers. The 
Na+/MMT system gives an exfoliated or isotropically dispersed state of 
nanoplatelets, and the MT2EtOH/MMT system gives an intercalated structure 
maintaining the layered structure of MMT platelets. As with the urethane elastomer 
system, the intercalated MMT/silicone nanocomposite provides a higher dielectric 
constant than the exfoliated system seemingly due to the nanocapacitance effect. 
The well-known fact that the exfoliated nanocomposites give the highest modulus 
value is also demonstrated in these silicone nanocomposite elastomer systems; 55 
kPa for silicone, 88 kPa for a Na+-MMT nanocomposite, and 72 kPa for a 
MT2EtOH-MMT nanocomposite. 
For these three systems of silicone-based materials, the generated stress is 
compared in Figure 2.4. As can be seen, the intercalated MT2EtOH-MMT actuator 
provides the highest stress values generated in the whole range of the electric field 
up to the breakdown voltage. It is due to the increased dielectric constant induced 
by the layered nanocapacitance effect.  It should be pointed out that the breakdown 
voltage of the nanocomposite system is not decreased by the incorporation of 
nanoplatelets, which can hardly be achieved in other chemicals or fillers.

3.1 Introduction 
For the last few decades, the roles of robots have been widely expanded from 
handling of routine manufacturing processes to hosting various entertainment 
applications. With the evolution of the information technology that creates 
ubiquitous communication environments in human life, the expectation of 
advances in robotic technology has been more intensified. Obviously, development 
of new robot applications has outpaced the improvement of mechanical and 
electrical functionality of robot hardware. One of the most languid activities in the 
hardware development in robotics might exist in the field of sensors and actuators. 
For instance, the efficacy of control algorithms or information handling of the 
current cutting-edge robots is often constrained by actuator performance, sensing
capabilities, mechanical locomotion, or power sources. 
According to the development trends of robots, their functionality is recently
concentrated on mimicking human movements or animal functions. Introduction of 
new kinds of actuators, so-called soft actuators, might be of key interest in the new 
robot technology development. However, the physical properties of traditional 
transducers such as electromagnetic motors, voice coil motors, are truly different 
from that of animal muscles so that operation of a robot equipped with actuators 
should be confined and efficient only in a structured environment. As a result, 
providing some level of flexibility to a robot skeleton and also to actuators will be 
the critical development path of the next generation of robots. 
Energy transduction considered from the thermodynamic point of view does 
not provide ample research opportunities mainly because the macroscopic

observation of energy flow has been well characterized. Especially energy flow in 
mechanical-electrical domain energy transformation that most likely relies on 
electromagnetic phenomena has been scrutinized for some decades. Consequently, 
most of the engineering applications, where the mechanical-electrical energy 
transformation is needed, employ electromagnetic transducers. Material 
development for energy transduction is, however, in its infancy. Recognizing the 
available number of transducer types that could be adopted in mechanical-electrical 
domain energy transformation, the development of an innovative new energy 
transformation material is well motivated. 
Despite the tremendous engineering research opportunities in the development 
of soft actuators for robotic applications, this field of study has been in a lukewarm 
stage for years. The advent of EAPs (electroactive polymers) recently constitutes 
an enormous impact on lingering development activity. There are a couple of 
reasons why the materials deserve keen attention from the robotic engineering 
field.  First, they could provide rectilinear motions without any assistance from a 
complicated power train. Recognizing that a complicated power transfer 
mechanism creates bulky robots and it hampers accomplishing delicate missions, 
total elimination or partial reduction of the power train mechanism benefits 
expansion of robot application where precise operation is required. Besides, 
reducing the number of power transmission stages, of course, improves energy 
efficiency. Second, the inherent flexibility of polymeric materials offers many 
engineering possibilities for creating biomimetic machines. Acknowledging the 
fact that animals are naturally soft, more precisely their actuation devices are soft, 
development of the soft energy transducer should be one of the most important 
prerequisites for biomimetic robot operations [1, 2]. 
Although actuators made with the polymers seem to provide many advantages 
over the traditional electromagnetic actuators, there are still some controversies 
over the feasibility of actuators. Stability and durability issues of the material, 
when it is manufactured as an actuator, are the principal concerns of the 
contention. However, considering the development progress that remains at a 
primitive stage and the lack of refined manufacturing technology, the debate might 
not be the limitation or failure of the technology but the consequences for 
improvement. There are many different polymeric materials available for 
development, and the research on the polymer transducers is truly 
multidisciplinary. Especially when a multidisciplinary technology is in its infancy, 
typically no dominant solution or consensus can be easily made to concentrate 
resources and accelerate research activities. Despite the ongoing arguments, the 
prominent beneficiary of polymer actuator technology might be the field of 
robotics. There are a number of books and articles available on polymer sensors 
and actuators. Most of them deliver quite a broad range of information about 
energy transformation from the basic principles to advanced physical phenomena. 
However, this chapter departs from the norm. In this chapter, robotic devices made 
with the polymer, especially dielectric elastomer, are introduced. All devices are 
successfully controlled with the standard feedback or feedforward algorithms. 
Focusing on robotic applications by coupling polymeric physics and robotic 
devices, this chapter would be a valuable asset and also an arsenal for readers to 
explain emerging robotic actuator technology.

There are various types of EAPs available for actuator development, and they 
are categorized in two groups by energy transduction characteristics. Ionic and 
nonionic are the groups of materials.  Dielectric elastomers are a sort of non-ionic 
material. In addition, they are normally incompressible but highly resilient so that a 
high strain level can be achieved. Silicone and acrylic materials are typical 
examples of dielectric elastomers. An actuator made with dielectric material is 
basically a two-plate capacitor. A laminated dielectric elastomer sheet is coated 
with compliant electrodes on both sides. When an electrical field is applied across 
the electrodes, positive and negative charges are accumulated near the electrode. 
This generates coulombic attraction forces between the electrodes, and it results in 
mechanical pressure, called Maxwell stress. Compressive mechanical pressure 
moves the electrodes closer to each other. Consequently, the incompressible 
elastomer expands in lateral directions and yields displacement [3].  
Although a wide range of active researches has been undertaken for the 
improvement of many different EAPs, emphases on dielectric elastomer actuators 
are made in this chapter because the materials are currently more popularly applied 
to industrial applications than the other EAPs. Two distinct implementations of the 
material to robotic actuation are introduced. The construction and functionality of 
the polymer actuators are closely dependent on the initial stretching of the material, 
so the design concepts and fabrication of polymer actuators with prestrain are 
provided and followed by those without prestrain.  
3.2 Prestrained Dielectic Elastomer Actuator 
3.2.1 Fundamentals of Prestrained Actuator 
The basic operation of the dielectric elastomer actuator is simply that the polymer 
intrinsically deforms either in expanding or in contracting when electrical voltage 
is applied to the electrodes. Basic principle actuation mechanisms are well 
explained in many publications [4-6]. Although numerous authors recently have 
presented various polymer actuators, few have demonstrated practical feasibility of 
designs and controllable actuator systems that can be implemented with a 
reasonable amount of control action. In this section, an antagonistically configured 
dielectric elastomer actuator is presented. Given the material and the geometrical 
constraints which should be well accounted in controllable actuation, it 
successfully delivers controlled bidirectional rectilinear mechanical motions by 
changing its compliance and exerting force.
The principal operation is similar to the electromechanical transduction of a 
parallel two-plate capacitor, as shown in Figure 3.1. When an electric potential is 
applied across the polymer film coated with compliant electrodes on both sides, the 
material is compressed in thickness and expands in the lateral direction. By virtue 
of this contraction, mechanical actuation force is generated. This physics couples 
mechanical and electrical energy domains so that energy transduction happens. The 
effective mechanical pressure, called Maxwell stress along the thickness direction 
by electrical input, is given by

Although the way to acquire mechanical actuation from the basic dielectric 
elastomer is straightforward, there is still a significant limitation for the basic 
actuation to be used for a practical application mainly due to its low exerting 
forces. It is simply because the actuation is provided by a soft and thin polymer 
film. In addition, the thin polymer film used for the basic operation can be easily 
ruptured by even small normal forces or buckled by lateral forces. Moreover, the 
operation is hardly controlled so that it is practically called a simple movement 
rather than an actuation. One of the possible solutions to overcome the critical 
limitation of the basic actuation mechanism is prestrained actuator design. This 
concept was originally proposed by researchers in SRI and they demonstrated a 
100% length change of a dielectric polymer sheet by applying pretension in the 
actuation direction [5]. 
3.2.2 Antagonistic Configuration of a Prestrained Actuator 
Noting the fundamental limitations of the basic actuation mechanism, a noYel 
design of an antagonistically configured actuation mechanism, called ANTLA 
(antagonistically driven linear actuator) is introduced. A schematic illustration of 
the mechanism is provided in Figure 3.2. With the prestrain effect of the 
configuration, a polymer sheet may produce a relatively larger displacement [4], 
although a recent study proves that it is not necessary for acquiring a large strain 
[6]. Having the prestrained polymer sheet connected to both frame and output 
terminal, a combination of push-pull forces produces larger actuation 
displacements.

Figure 3.2. Fabrication of antagonistically driven actuator 
In this design, the actuator is actually composed of a single prestretched 
elastomer film affixed to a rigid square frame, which provides uniform pretension 
in the direction of actuation. For the antagonistically driven mechanism that 
requires two independent polymer sections, a polymer sheet is stretched and a 
compliant electrode paste is placed on the top and bottom surfaces. Finally, the top 
compliant electrode is partitioned in two sections. They are called electrode A and 
B of the top surface, and the common electrode C of the bottom in Figure 3.2. In 
addition, a mechanical output terminal is attached at the boundary of the 
partitioned electrodes. Although it is fabricated from a single elastomer film, it 
works as the antagonistically driven actuator with partitioned electrodes so that it 
can provide bidirectional “push-pull” actuation.

Figure 3.3. Operation

H.R. Choi et al. 
In detail, the device presented works as follows. Assuming that uniform 
pretensions are engaged, tensions on both sides of the elastomer film are initially 
balanced. When the electrical input is applied to one of the elastomers, it expands, 
and the force equilibrium is broken. The output terminal, therefore, moves to 
rebalance the broken elastic equilibrium. For example, as shown in Figure 3.3a, if a 
positive input voltage is given on electrode A, a negative one on B, and a negative 
one on C, then the output terminal moves toward electrode B because the elastomer 
on electrode A expands due to the input voltage on A. Similarly, if a positive 
voltage input is given on electrode B while a negative input is applied to A and C, 
then the output terminal moves toward electrode A. Besides the basic actuation, the 
design presented can provide an additional feature that is normally difficult to 
acquire from existing traditional actuators. The compliance of the actuator can be 
actively modulated by controlling input voltages. For instance, as shown in Figure 
3.3c, if positive input voltages are given on electrodes A and B while applying 
negative voltage to C, the actuator becomes more compliant. On the contrary, it 
becomes stiffer when all applied voltages are the same. The actuator presented 
delivers four different actuation states; forward, backward, compliant and stiff, 
which are characteristics of human muscles. 
3.2.3 Modeling and Analysis 
3.2.3.1 Static Model 
In this section, a static model of the actuator presented is discussed. The modeling 
process starts from longitudinally dividing the actuator into two sections, as shown 
in Figure 3.4.

It is then horizontally discretized into a number of elements with infinitesimal 
width. Then a force balance on an element can be derived, as shown in Figure 3.5. 
Initially, both the left and right sections of the dielectric elastomer sheet are in 
elastic force balance.

To derive a dynamic model the actuator presented is simplified as a lumped model , 
as shown in Figure 3.6. Nevertheless, the mathematical model still has a

damping. Based on the lumped model, the dynamic equation of the actuator can be

3.2.4 Control of Actuator 
In this section, a method for control of both displacement and compliance of the 
antagonistically configured actuator is explained. For reasonable handling of the 
nonlinear characteristics of the actuator, a linearization of the actuator system is 
performed, and a modified nonlinear decoupling control method is applied to the 
linearized system.

terms. Therefore, a linearization about the equilibrium position is needed to 
elaborate the inverse solution and the control law. By employing Taylor's series 
expansion (limited to the first order), a linearized model for the overall system is 
obtained as follows:

3.2.4.2 Modified Nonlinear Decoupling Control System 
By using the linearized system model, a modified nonlinear decoupling controller 
is developed. The controller employs a plain scheme popularly used in various 
control and robotic applications. It provides the ability to control both position and 
stiffness. Figure 3.8 shows the overall structure of the controller. 
A detailed internal structure of the compliance controller that is a subpart of the 
controller shown in Figure 3.8 is provided in Figure 3.9. The controller is 
composed of an inverse equation and a stiffness compensator. Shown in Figure 3.9,  
the inputs of the controller are the load F , the desired stiffness 
dk , and the 
displacement x . The outputs of the controller are 
L

3.2.5 Inchworm Microrobot Using Prestrained Actuator 
The design of ANTLA can be directly applied to biomimetic microrobots. Some 
examples are shown in this section.  
Annelid animals such as earthworms or maw worms, etc., contain metameric 
structures composed of numerous ringlike segments. In their movements, annelid 
animals use longitudinal muscles as well as circular ones and carry out locomotion 
by contracting these muscles alternatively without looping their metameric 
structures. To reproduce this muscle combination, three ANTLAs embedded in the 
metameric structure of the robot provide actuation forces, while they play the role 
of the frame as well. It not only enables efficient actuation but also makes it 
possible to manufacture a robot by a totally new fabrication method that enables 
mass production of a robot through processes such as injection molding or 
stamping [10,11]. In addition, there are possibilities to easily mimic the natural and 
delicate motions such as animal skin motions, wrinkling, and eyebrow movement 
without using many actuators. The design of the segment addressed in this section 
illustrates a realization of embedding actuators in the robot without using 
complicated mechanisms or their substitutes. 
3.2.5.1 Design of a Segment 
The metameric structure of annelid animals features a number of ringlike segments. 
The segment can be regarded as an independent actuator capable of exerting 
multiple DOFs of motion. As shown in Figure 3.10, the segment is composed of 
two parts, a lower body and the upper body. The outer diameter of the segment is 
30 mm and the length is 18 mm. The lower body is composed of a plastic frame 

64 
H.R. Choi et al. 
and three ANTLAs. The ANTLAs are fixed equidistantly along the circumferential 
direction on the frame. The actuators are attached to the frame of the segment body 
made with plastics, so there is a large cavity in the central part of the segment that 
can be used for embedding devices and equipment that a robot has to carry for its 
main missions. The lower body plays a role as a connector that contains a 
mechanical joint and a structure for attaching another adjacent segment.

Figure 3.10. Schematic structure of a segment 
Each ANTLA generates a single degree-of-freedom linear motion, so a segment 
composed of three of them produces three-degrees-of freedom motion. Actuation 
of the three actuators produces motion of the upper body relative to the lower body, 
thus motions like translation, panning, and tilting are possible. A segment can be 
modeled as a parallel mechanism with three linear actuators. The push-pull motion 
of the ANTLA is represented as a couple of active prismatic joints so are 
connectors between the upper and the lower body simplified as spherical joints.  
In Figure 3.11, the motion of a segment is illustrated. The moving direction of 
the segment is designated with an arrow. As illustrated in Figures 3.11c and b, the 
segment moves up or down when all of the actuators (ANTLA) go up or down 
simultaneously. On the contrary, the segment turns if one ANTLA moves upward 
and the others go downward, as shown in Figure 3.11d. Consequently, the segment 
can generate three DOF motions.

3.2.5.2 A Microrobot 
By connecting several segments in series, an inchworm microrobot can be created, 
as shown in Figure 3.12. The microrobot can generate multiple DOF motions with 
five segments (or can be extended to a hyperredundant one if the number of 
segments is increased). The robot has plenty of hollow space inside that provides a 
morphological structure similar to an annelid as well as a space for accommodating 
electronic parts, power supply, electrical wiring, and control systems for the robot 
operation. 
An accumulated turning angle of each segment generates a bending motion of 
the robot, as shown in Figure 3.13. By a proper combination of sequential motion 
of each segment, the microrobot generates translational motion, as illustrated in 
Figure 3.14. The shaded region in the figure represents an active segment. First, the 
front segment of the actuator expands while the others remain still. Then, the next 
actuator expands while the front segment contracts. By a consecutive motion of the 
aforementioned actuation pattern from the front to the tail, the robot moves 
forward. A demonstration of the robot motion for translational movement in a tube 
is shown in Figure 3.15.

3.2.6 Multi-DOF Linear Motor Using a Prestrained Actuator 
In the previous sections, the basic working principles, benefits, and drawbacks of 
an antagonistically configured dielectric elastomer actuator have been delineated. 
Given the material and the geometrical constraints which should be well accounted 
for by controllable actuation of the material, the prestrained ANTLA successfully 
provides controlled bidirectional linear mechanical motions by changing its 
compliance and exerting force. Guaranteed controllability of motion with a simple 
control law is, of course, one of the most important design requirements of any 
kind of actuator. Especially, when they are applied to human-muscle like motion 
generators, simple architecture and easy control should be ensured.  
One of the significant drawbacks of the simple ANTLA design is fragility of 
the film by direct external forces normal to its surface. Recognizing the 
disadvantages of the simple ANTLA design, a new actuator concept using dual 
films is introduced so that it successfully bears heavy transverse forces. This 
design provides a rugged linear actuation mechanism as well as expandability to 
multi-degree-of-freedom actuation. Furthermore, the new design is not limited to 
dielectric elastomer but can be directly applied to other types of polymeric 
actuators. 
3.2.6.1 Single DOF Linear Motor 
The actuator is constructed with two films made from a dielectric elastomer. A 
schematic of the design concept is provided in Figure 3.16.

Figure 3.16. Schematic view of linear motor actuator concept 
Two sheets of elastomer film are used for the design. Each film is mounted on a 
circular frame that works as a ground electrode. It is designated electrode C in the 
figure. The two mounted films are prestrained by sandwiching a pretensioning rod. 
Once the assembly is done, the rod is positioned and remains at the strain force 
equilibrium of the two pretensioned elastomer units unless electrical input is 
applied. If the elastic force equilibrium is broken for any reason, the rod will move 
either upward or downward and stops at a new equilibrium position. This is the 
fundamental working mechanism of the actuator. 
A more detailed explanation of the actuator working mechanism is provided in 
Figure 3.17. When an electric potential is applied to electrodes A and C across the 
top film, the dielectric elastomer film expands, and it results in breaking the initial 
strain force balance.

Hence, the rod will move upward and stop at a new equilibrium position. Because 
both polymer films are constrained by each other through the rod, the proposed 
actuator motion should be controllable only by adjusting the stiffness of the films.

The actuator is to return to its original state as soon as the input is removed, and the 
actuation can be, of course, easily reversed by applying electrical input to the 
bottom film. Similarly, a push-pull actuation is possible by alternating actuations 
of the two. Some example patterns of actuator driving are listed in Table 1. This 
paradigm provides four distinct working modes, forward, backward, highly 
compliant, and highly stiff, those are similar to human muscle fibers. 
Having controllability of the linear actuator introduced, a single-DOF linear 
actuator is constructed, named a polymer motor. A schematic cross-sectional view 
of a fully packaged motor assembly is shown in Figure 3.18.

The thrust force and physical size of the actuator are potentially scalable so that it 
could be applied for various actuator operations ranging from microrobotics to 
consumer electronics. Moreover, it generates a thrust force by a true linear 
mechanism without any mechanical transformers, which guarantees higher energy 
efficiency, quiet operation, and easy control. A prototype of the polymer motor is

3.2.6.2 Multi-DOF Polymer Motor 
The concept presented of the single-DOF polymer motor can be easily extended to 
a multi-DOF motion actuator using a partitioned electrode coating scheme that is 
illustrated in Figure 3.20. The actuator consists of eight polymer film sections, four 
sections on each side. It could be manufactured by simply partitioning the 
elastomer surface and applying the carbon coating separately on each partitioned 
area during the electrode coating process. Each polymer section is divided with 
separate electrodes, so each quadrant must be controlled independently.

A proper combination of individual motions of each section might provide 
continuous multi-DOF actuation. For example, when sections d and h are actuated, 
the output terminal moves in the positive x direction. Figure 3.21 shows the generic 
idea for creating translational motions. If sections c and f are turned on in a non- 
symmetrical input pattern, the output terminal will be tilted with respect to the 
positive x axis. Then, if the control action succeeds in providing electrical input to 
sections d and e, the terminal will rotate about the positive y axis. 
Further continuous control action with proper adjustment of the input voltage 
during the transition of the rotating axis helps to keep the terminal in smooth 
rotation.  A prototype of the multi-DOF polymer motor is shown in Figure 3.22 
with its control circuit that could be combined in an actuator assembly.

3.3 Nonprestrained Dielectric Elastomer Actuator 
3.3.1 Fundamentals of Nonprestrained Actuator 
Having some amount of prestrain on dielectric elastomer actuators improves the 
deformation and helps in generating macromotions. However, there are a few 
counteractions due to the prestrain. One of the critical drawbacks is stress 
relaxation and hysteresis, although the extents depend on the materials, and it is 
still the key concern over the actuator. 
Recognizing the disadvantages of prestrained actuator designs, in the following 
sections, a different actuator design concept without using pretension is introduced 
that maintains the initial performance without the rapid aging process that happens 
by relaxation. The stress relaxation of the prestrained actuator is illustrated in 
Figure 3.23. The working procedure of the actuator  depicted in Figure 3.23 is (a) 
initial state - the restoration force of stretched actuator 
L
F  is balanced by the 
restoration force of elastic body 
R
F  such as a spring or other elastomer; (b) 
actuation state - a longitudinal expansion force
m
F , which leads from the 
electrostatic force 
Maxwwell
F
 that is engaged on the actuator in the vertical direction 
by applying voltage, is added to the restoration force; (c) new equilibrium state - 
the two materials, dielectric elastomer actuator and elastic body, are deformed to 
rearrange the equilibrium condition of the restoration forces.  
Assuming uniform pretensions are engaged along the prestrain, the tensions on 
both elastomer films are initially balanced in that direction. Once the electrical 
input is applied that induces Maxwell stress, the balance is broken. Then, the mid 
point is moved by the unbalanced force, and it stops at a new balanced position. 
This process generates a large force and displacement. 
As mentioned, however, the actuator design has a couple of drawbacks. First of 
all, the most significant problem is caused by the viscoelastic characteristic of 
polymer materials. A viscoelastic material shows a combination of elastic and 
viscous behavior so that an applied stress results in an instantaneous elastic strain 
followed by a viscous time-dependent strain. 
The time-dependent behavior of the material under a quasi-static state can be 
categorized into three types of phenomena: creep, stress relaxation, and constant 
rate stressing. Figures 3.24 and 3.25 show the viscoelastic behavior of VHB4905 
(3M) that is one of the most representative dielectric elastomers.  
Most prestrained actuator designs suffer from viscoelastic characteristics. 
Hence the stress induced by the stretching of the elastomer gradually decreases and 
the output force of the actuator may decrease because the maximum actuation force 
is dependent on the pretension of the elastomer. In addition, the actuation of the 
pre-strained elastomer normally requires another elastic counterpart such as a 
spring or elastomer, as shown for ANTLA.

To avoid the time-dependent behavior of the dielectric elastomer actuator, the 
pretension should be removed and only a pure compressive force induced by the 
Maxwell stress should be used for actuation. For the first step of the nonprestrained 
actuator design, the amount of deformation of the dielectric elastomer caused by 
the Maxwell stress must be calculated. The governing equation should be modified

dielectric elastomers are incompressible, so if the actuator is assumed to be a thin

Eq. (3.26) means that the usable strain is only half of the vertical strain. For that 
reason, either a material with a higher dielectric constant or very high input voltage 
is required for a better actuator performance. However, neither seems to be very 
practical because the polymeric materials commercially available have limited 
dielectric characteristics and the electrical circuit devices handling high voltage are 
also limited. Therefore, a new actuating method has to be developed for the 
nonprestrained actuator. 
The basic operating concept of the nonprestrained dielectric actuator is 
illustrated in Figure 3.27. As shown in Figure 3.27a, a thin dielectric elastomer 
sheet is confined by rigid boundaries. Once a compressive force is applied to the 
sheet, it must expand. That induces buckling situation in the sheet and the sheet has 
to become either convex or concave. This idea makes an efficient actuation without

silicone that has a lower viscosity than VHB4905 is used. The spin-coated 
elastomer film has been coated with carbon electrodes. They are stacked to make 
multiple layers. The total membrane thickness is 0.75 mm and each dielectric 
elastomer is approximately 0.05 mm thick. To make an insulated area between 
electrodes, both sides of the dielectric elastomer have a nonelectrode area. The 
diameter of the membrane ( d ) is slightly larger than that (
f
d ) of the fixed frame 
and it might create either a concave or convex circular membrane that could 
provide more stable control of deformation in the desired direction during 
actuation. Figure 3.29 shows an actual fabricated prototype of a dielectric 
elastomer actuator.

3.3.1.2 Driving Circuit 
A schematic diagram of the driving circuit for the elastomer actuator is provided in 
Figure 3.30. The response and output characteristic of the actuator are closely 
related to the charging-discharging characteristics. The duration of the charging 
process depends on the physical properties of the polymer and is difficult to 
improve electrically, whereas the discharging duration can be reduced by adding a 
simple switching device, as shown in the figure. By the addition of the discharging 
circuit, the actuator can be operated at more than 100 Hz input frequency without 
significant attenuation.

3.3.1.3 Simulation and Experimental Results 
A test and an analysis have been compared in Figure 3.31. The simulation and the 
experiments have shown good agreement. There is a small error between the 
calculated result and the experiment that might happen because of the disparity and 
difference in the thickness of each layer, the externally coated shield layer, and the 
fabrication process.  
For complete measurement of the actuator performance, the frequency response 
of the actuator is also tested in both displacement and force. As shown in Figure 
3.32, the soft actuator generates a fairly large displacement and force. The weight 
of the actuator is only 0.02 g, and its diameter is 6 mm with a 0.75 mm thickness. 
Besides, the actuator shows a fast response for square waveform inputs, as shown 
in Figure 3.33.

3.3.2 Inchworm microrobot Using a Nonprestrained Actuator 
An inchworm robot made with the nonprestrained actuator has been developed as 
an example of actuator applications. In Figure 3.34, an actuator module that has 
three degrees of freedom is shown. If the module is serially connected, a multi-
degree-of-freedom inchworm could be constructed. The actuator module is made 
with 12 serially connected modules. This actuator module works as both a power 
plant for the movement and a body skeleton of the inchworm robot structure. In 
other words, the inchworm robot can be built by simply stacking the actuator 
modules without any additional mechanical structure.  
The actuator module shown in Figs. 3.34 has a 20mm diameter, 3mm thickness 
and 0.4g weight. In Figure 3.35, a fully assembled inchworm robot is shown. This 
robot has eight actuator modules (96 actuators). Four wires for supplying electric 
power are connected to the each module. For connecting each module, small 
silicone cylinders, which have a 1mm diameter and 0.2~0.4mm height, are used to 
make point-to-point connections between modules and they are bonded by silicone

has four actuator modules. Each sector is operated sequentially to create inchworm 
motion.

3.3.3 A Braille Display Using Nonpestrained Actuators 
Although visual graphical display devices have been the dominant method for 
information interchange, the role of tactile sense is getting more attentions as a new 
the way of modern information exchange in various technical fields such as 
robotics, virtual reality, remote manipulation, rehabilitation, and medical 
engineering. For human-device interface application, a tactile display transfers 
information through controlled displacement or force that stimulates human skin.  
Communications relying only on graphical presentations are definitely 
impossible for the visually impaired. For that reason, a large population in the 
world might be left out of Internet access that results in isolation from educational 

Robotic Applications of Artificial Muscle Actuators 
83 
resources and cultural activities. Advances in tactile display technology for higher 
sensitivity and higher resolution might benefit the handicapped. 
Braille is a tool for exchanging information among the visually disabled and 
has been extensively used to transfer textual information. It consists of six pins 
arranged in pattern of a 3 u 2 matrix (a 4 u 2 matrix for Chinese characters). 
Information is delivered by stimulating fingertips by vertical displacement of the 
pins. The tactile display device can be used as a refreshable dynamic braille. In 
particular, application of the display also can be expanded to a tablet capable of 
displaying textural or graphical information. With that capability, even an entire 
web page can be delivered in a single display step. However, it is very difficult to 
enable braille to deliver graphical information mainly due to the limitation of 
arranging massive braille dots for high spatial density. The complicated and bulky 
driving mechanism of a conventional tactile display hampers development of high- 
resolution tablet type braille. According to a physiological study for 
standardization of braille devices, the pin-matrix density of a tactile display is 
typically up to one cell per square millimeter, the actuating speed should be faster 
than 50Hz, and the energy density must be about 10W per square centimeter 
[12,13]. Although the numbers are based on experimental studies, the outcome of 
the display function is often deceptive because the sensitivity of responses depends 
on testing conditions such as speed, depth, and strength of stimulation. Meanwhile 
various mutated tactile display types are introduced to accommodate variable 
human sensitivity that normally varies from fingertips to palms. Many publications 
introduce several different types of tactile display devices that employ pneumatics, 
solenoids, voice coil, shape-memory alloy, electrostatics, or electroactive polymers.  
Although previous developments deserve serious attention, most of them 
commonly suffer from low actuation speed due to a complex actuation mechanism. 
Moreover, the complicated actuator design limits expansion to the tablet type 
application due to high manufacturing cost and low integration density. In this 
section, an alternative new type of dynamic braille display is introduced. 
Employing a dielectric elastomer as the basis of the tactile display, it is constructed 
with a notably simple mechanical and electrical architecture. The proposed device 
is organized with a dual-layered array of tactile cells, shown in Figure 3.29, which 
generates vertical motion to push the braille pins up or down. These electrically 
driven tactile cells can generate either small-scale vibratory motion or linear 
displacement, and they differ from the conventional devices in softness and 
controllable compliance, cost effectiveness, simple manufacturability, and high 
actuator density. Furthermore, the small size of the design introduced enables 
development of a high-resolution display device. Realizing the advantages of the 
nonprestrained actuator cell, shown in Figures 3.28 and 3.29, a braille display 
device has been developed using the cells. In this section, a detailed construction 
procedure for the device and its electronics is presented.  
A typical braille display unit is constructed with six stimulating pins that are 
arranged in a 3u2 array format, and an array normally represents a character as 
defined by the Braille alphabet. The standard braille display unit is illustrated in 
Figure 3.36.

The construction concept is depicted in Figure 3.37. Although the dielectric 
elastomer based tactile cell is driven with high-voltage electricity, users have no 
direct contact the actuator surface. A braille pin made of insulating material 
actually contacts with human fingertips. In addition to the predeformed convex 
feature of a cell, directional balls are placed underneath each cell to guarantee 
unidirectional actuation. Packaging the six pin actuators and corresponding electric 
wires in a constrained small space normally requires an expensive manufacturing 
process. Dual-layer construction is introduced to alleviate fabrication problems. By 
allocating three pins in each layer in a staggered pattern, interference caused by 
complicated wiring can be minimized. Each layer is shown in Figure 3.39.

As shown in Figure 3.39, the fully assembled device is only about 9mm high 
excluding the length of the terminals. Each braille cell is modularized for 
convenient installation, so each unit can be simply plugged onto a circuit board. 
With this simple drop-in feature, a number of braille cells can easily be combined 
so that a braille tablet may be manufactured by arranging many braille cells in a 
matrix format, as illustrated in Figure 3.40. A complete actuator system for a 
braille display unit composed of an embedded controller, high-voltage driving 
circuit, and a host PC is organized and its schematic description is provided in 
Figure 3.41. All necessary control electronic parts are embedded and packaged on 
a PCB and it communicates with a hosting PC through a universal serial bus. A 
microcontroller (AVR, Atmega 163) is used for the controller and USB 1.1 (Philips, 
PDIUSBD12) works for communication. A D/A converter (TI TLV5614) and OP-
Amp (TI TLV4112) have been integrated in the controller for the modulation of 
high electric voltage. A complete circuit board is pictured in Figure 3.42.

The device is organized by cramming many small-scale actuators into a tiny space, 
electrical wiring might be one of the key problems to be resolved. Identifying 
constructional and functional analogies of the braille device to a computer input 
keyboard, a control scheme, so-called dynamic scanning actuation(DSA), can be 

88 
H.R. Choi et al. 
used here. This strategy enables easy control of nun braille cells with only 2n 
electrical lines. The concept of the control is depicted in Figure 3.43. One of the 
lines named a data line delivers high-voltage driving electric power to each cell 
and the other line called a scan line functions as a ground. Therefore, each actuator 
cell can be driven using n lines of the data line and n lines of the scan line with 
alternating ‘On-Off’ patterns on both lines.

For example, refer to Figure 3.43, although the data lines D0, D1, D2 get 
‘High’/‘On’ signal during three clocks, only one actuator located in the upper left 
corner operates because only one scan line S0 maintains ‘High’/‘On’ during the 
time. In essence, an actuator cell moves only if those two lines are synchronized 
with a ‘High’/‘On’ signal. The scan frequency is L u M when the number of 
actuators in a row is M and the desired driving frequency is L.
Because a dielectric elastomer actuator normally operates with high electrical 
voltage of about 1~2kV, introduction of the proposed control scheme DSA 
provides significant benefits by reducing the number of required high-voltage 
sources. For example, a single braille unit composed of six tactile cells can be 
actuated with only a single voltage source, and the number of cells can be easily 
expanded. In Figure 3.44, HVSC (high-voltage switching circuit) high-voltage reed 
switches and photocouplers are shown. For faster actuator operation, the method 
shown in Figure 3.30 has been implemented in the circuit.

3.4 Conclusions 
Research and development of the dielectric elastomer actuator have produced 
significant progress for decades. A remarkable amount of work has focused on 
delivering the feasibility of the industrial application of the material. However, few 
commercial products equipped with polymer actuators have been introduced in the 
market, probably because most of the research has been dedicated either to 
discovering new actuation properties of the polymeric material or comparative 
study of the operating range of a particular traditional actuator and its polymeric 
substitute.  
One of the implications of the term “actuator” might be a “controllable” motion 
generator. If a material produces just some motions, it can not be referred as an 
actuator unless its motions are controlled. The actuator designs introduced in this 
chapter have been developed under a common philosophy that actuator motions 
should be controllable with a reasonable amount of control actions. This clearly 
differs from many previous developments. The physics of the polymeric material 
actuation and its construction as an actuator is quite straightforward if a proper 
application is well sought in advance. In other words, if a good application where 
the polymer actuators can be used is established and the actuator functionality is 
well defined, application of the current dielectric elastomer actuator technology to 
industrial products could be accomplished before long. Future research activity 
may focus on development of a new energy effective material that has higher 
permittivity and creation of new application fields such as biomimetic robotics and 
tactile or braille displays.

4.1 Introduction 
Piezoelectric and ferroelectric polymers have been recognized as a new class of 
electroactive materials since the significant piezoelectricity in polyvinylidene 
fluoride (PVDF or PVF2) was discovered in 1969 by Kawai [1]. Since then, a 
variety of new piezoelectric polymers have been developed including copolymers 
of vinylidene fluoride and trifluoroethylene, p(VF2-TrFE), odd-numbered nylons, 
composite polymers, etc. [2–8]. These materials offer options of material selection 
for sensor and actuator technologies that need lightweight electroactive materials.  
In this chapter, the origins of piezoelectricity and the properties of several kinds of 
piezoelectric and ferroelectric polymeric materials are introduced for reference.  
4.2 Dipole Moment and Polarization 
4.2.1 Dipole and Dipole Orientation 
An electric dipole can be defined as an entity in which a positive charge, q, is 
separated by a relatively short distance, d, from an equal negative charge [9].  The 
electric dipole moment, P, is a vector quantity and is defined as 
P { qd
(4.1) 
By convention, its direction points from the negatively charged end toward the 
positively charged end. Traditionally, the Debye has been used as the unit of 
measure of the dipole moment.  In international units, 
 
1 D = 3.338 u 10
-30 C-m

A dipole moment is defined as a permanent dipole moment if it exists in the 
absence of an external electric field, while an induced dipole is the dipole formed 
by an applied electric field. Besides these, "defect dipole moments" can be 
introduced, which are associated with some structural heterogeneity, such as a 
missing lattice site, crystallite interface, crystallite-amorphous interface in solids, 
or an interface between two media [10]. At structural defects, the bonding energy 
is decreased and the radius of the defects is, correspondingly, increased. In the 
presence of an external electric field, a dipole may be formed at structural defects.  
This can be referred to as a defect dipole. Since the bonding energy is dependent 
on the dielectric constant of a medium, any heterogeneity in the dielectric constant 
should result in a corresponding change in the formation of dipoles in the presence 
of an external field. This change is known as the Maxwell-Wagner effect.  If the 
sample contains regions of different dielectric constants in an external electric 
field, an interfacial dipole polarization builds up [11]. The electric dipoles 
mentioned above are schematically illustrated in Figure 4.1. 
Figure 4.1. Schematical illustrations of the formation of a dipole. (a) a typical dipole, (b) a 
defect dipole, and (c) interfacial dipoles when an interface is formed by two consituents that 
have different dielectric constants (H1  H 2).
           Figure 4.2. The torque acting on a dipole under an electric field 
When an electric field is applied to a permanent dipole, the positive charge at one 
end of the dipole experiences a force in the direction of the applied field and the 
negative charge experiences an equal force in the opposite direction.  
Consequently, the net force on the dipole is zero; therefore, the translational 
movement will be zero. However, the charges are separated by a fixed

displacement d, so a torque (or moment) may exist. The torque consists of two 
components, F+ sinT  and F- sinT , acting on the dipole, as shown in Figure 4.2. 
The torque will tend to align, or orient, the dipole in the direction of the applied 
electric field [12]. As is well known, torque is a quantity which is defined as a 
cross product of the force F and length vector d:

Here, the amount of work or energy which is needed to align a dipole at an angle T
to an applied electric field E is given. Thus, a dipole, P, inclined by an angle, T, to 
an electric field, E, has a potential energy, w, given by w = PE cosT , or the scalar 
product w = P  E. The alignment, or orientation, of the dipole under an electric 
field is called polarization. However, even in the presence of an electric field, 
dipoles are still under the influence of thermal motion amounting to an energy, a
kT, where k is the Boltzman constant (1.38 u 10
-23 J-K
-1) and T is temperature. 
Therefore, the torque aligning the dipoles in the field direction is always 
counteracted by thermal energy to some extent. 
4.2.2 Polarizability and Polarization 
Polarization, P, is defined as a vector quantity expressing the magnitude and 
direction of the electric dipole moment per unit volume. In the absence of the 
external electric field, the polarization is equal to the charge per unit area on the 

94
J. Su
surface of the material. In general, there are four fundamental components of 
polarization: electronic, atomic, orientational, and interfacial (or space charge) 
polarizations [13]. 
4.2.2.1  
Electronic Polarization 
An electric field will cause a slight displacement of the electron cloud of any atom 
in a molecule relative to its positive nucleus. As a result, the nucleus is no longer at 
the centroid of the electronic charge. This situation is termed electronic 
polarization. The applied electric field is usually very weak compared with the 
intra-atomic field at an electron, so this polarization is quite small. 
4.2.2.2 
Atomic Polarization 
When atoms of different types form molecules, they will not normally share their 
electrons symmetrically, as the electron clouds will be displaced eccentrically 
toward the atoms having higher electronegativity. Thus atoms acquire charges of 
opposite polarity. When an electric field is applied, these net charges tend to 
change the equilibrium position of the atoms themselves. This results in atomic 
polarization. The magnitude of atomic polarization is usually quite small, often 
only one-tenth that of electronic polarization. 
4.2.2.3 
Orientational Polarization 
If the molecules already possess a permanent dipole moment, the moment will tend 
to be aligned by the applied field to a net polarization in the direction of the applied 
electric field. The orientational polarization that develops when the field is applied 
is the average of the orientations of the permanent dipole moments favoring the 
direction of the applied field. The tendency to revert to random orientation opposes 
the tendency of the field to align the dipoles and thus allows for polarization to 
vary in proportion to the applied field. 
4.2.2.4  
Interfacial (Space Charge) Polarization 
Besides electronic, atomic and orientational polarization, another polarization, 
interfacial polarization, should be introduced, especially for heterogeneous 
systems. Charge carriers usually exist in such systems and they can migrate 
through the material under an electric field. When the carriers are impeded in their 
motion, they become trapped at defect sites or at an interface between two media 
having different dielectric constants and conductivity, and they cannot be freely 
discharged or replaced at the electrodes. This can give rise to space charges and 
macroscopic field distortion [14]. These effects will create a localized 
accumulation of charges that will induce image charges on electrodes and give rise 
to a dipole moment, therefore making contributions to the total polarization of the 
system. 
If we think of polarization on the molecular level, the polarization mechanisms can 
also be expressed in terms of a molecular physical quantity called polarizability D.
Polarizability is defined as the average molecular polarized dipole moment 
produced under the action of an electric field of unit strength [15].  Suppose that 
the action of the local electric field strength El on each molecule produces a 
polarized dipole moment, P which is  generally proportional to El, or 

Ferroelectric Polymers for Electromechanical Functionality 
95 
P = D El
(4.9) 
where the proportionality constant is the polarizability. 
Assume that the total number of dipole moments per unit volume is No and all 
of them are equally polarized. In that case, the polarization, P, will be obtained by 
P = NoP = No D El .
(4.10) 
Here, El is the local electric field, which is different from the applied electric field 
E. Clausius-Mossotti's calculation based on a spherical model of the Lorentz local 
field assumes that an imaginary sphere is drawn around a particular molecule and 
that the local field at that point is the sum of the fields resulting from the real 
charges on the electrodes which sustain the external applied field and all of the 
charges lying outside and inside the sphere.  For a molecular arrangement that 
gives a zero field at the point due to the material inside the sphere, the Lorentz 
local field can be obtained as [9]

polarization, and Pi is interfacial polarization. And  
D  = De + Da + Do + Di
(4.14) 
where De is electronic polarizability, Da is atomic polarizability, Do is orientational 
polarizability, and  Di is interfacial polarizability [16]. 
As previously mentioned, the mechanisms of polarization in dielectrics are 
associated with the type of charge displacement, so they should be dependent on 
frequency. A particular mechanism of polarization gives rise to resonance 
phenomena in a particular frequency range. Figure 4.3 shows the relationship 
between polarization mechanism and frequency [9].

4.3 Piezoelectricity and Ferroelectricity 
A material is defined as piezoelectric if the short-circuit current resulting from the 
change in polarization when the material is stressed is large enough to be 
measurable; a material is defined as ferroelectric if the material is polar and the 
polarization is reorientable under an external electric field. 
The piezoelectric response of materials was discovered by the Curies in 1880 
[17]. They found that some crystals can convert mechanical energy into electrical 
energy. In 1881, W. G. Hankel contended that the response must obey certain laws 
of its own (like other intrinsic properties of materials), and Hankel proposed the 
term “piezoelectricity” [18], which means pressure-electricity [piezo means press
in Greek], to describe the property. Later, a classical theory for single crystals was 
developed by W. Voigt [19] and others. According to the classical theory for single 
crystals, among the 32 crystal classes, 20 with noncentrosymmetry can be 
piezoelectrically active. Ten of these 20, which have neither a reflection plane nor 
a two-fold axis perpendicular to a particular direction, can possess a net intrinsic 
dipole moment in their crystal unit cell, and thus exhibit “pyroelectricity” which 
means thermal-electricity [pyro means heat/thermal in Greek]. A crystal is defined 
as ferroelectric when the intrinsic dipole moments in the crystal can reverse their 
direction, following the application of a sufficiently high external electric field 
[20]. Figure 4.4 shows a simple box-relationship to distinguish ferroelectricity, 
piezoelectricity, and pyroelectricity by the nature of crystal materials. 
Figure 4.4. A simple method to distingduish ferroelectricity, piezoelectricity, and 
pyroelectricity by the nature of crystal materials 
4.3.1 Definition of Piezoelectricity 
Piezoelectricity can be defined thermodynamically [21].  According to the first and 
second laws of thermodynamics,  
dU = dQ + dW 
(4.19) 
where U is the internal energy density, and Q is the heat given to a unit volume of 
a crystal from outside,  
Electrets (crystalline or noncrystalline) 
Piezoelectrics: Noncentrosymmetry
Pyroelectrics: No reflection plane or no twofold 
axis perpendicular to a particular direction 
Ferroelectrics: Intrinsic dipole moments 
can reverse their direction by an electric 
field

98
J. Su
dQ = TdS  
(4.20) 
for a reversible process, where T is Kelvin temperature and S is the entropy. 
Considering dW as the work done by electrical and mechanical forces on the unit 
volume, it can be expressed as  
dW = Xdx + EdP 
(4.21) 
where X is the stress, x is the strain, E is the electric field and, P is electric 
polarization.  If the Gibbs free energy is given by 
G = U - TS - Xx - EP 
(4.22) 
Then, 
dG = -SdT - xdX - PdE . 
(4.23) 
Since X and E are independent parameters of G, G(X,E) can be expanded at X = 0, 
E = 0 by using the Maclaurin series and by neglecting the higher order terms:

4.3.2 Ferroelectricity and Polarization Reversal  
Ferroelectrics are materials that possess a spontaneous electric polarization, Ps,
which can be reversed by applying a suitable electric field E. This process is 
known as polarization reversal, or polarization switching, and is always 
accompanied by hysteresis. This characteristic property of a material was 
discovered by Valasek in 1921 and is known as ferroelectricity [22]. The electric 
field at which the polarization reversal occurs is defined as the coercive field, Ec.
Most ferroelectrics cease to be ferroelectric when the temperature is above a 
critical one, which is called the Curie transition temperature. The process is known 
as a ferroelectric-paraelectric transition [23]. 
Figure 4.5. (a) Typical ferroelectric hysteresis characteristics and (b) the Sawyer-Tower 
circuit to conduct the characterization
Ferroelectrics may be distinguished by their characteristic response to a changing 
electric field E, as indicated in Figure 4.5a, where t is the time and i is the current. 
E and i are a function of t. Ferroelectrics show a current (i) peak at the coercive 
field, Ec which is attributed to polarization reversal, whereas nonferroelectrics (P = 
0 when E = 0) show a linear relationship of the current to the applied electric field 
[23]. This result can be obtained by using a (hysteresis) bridge circuit called the 
modified Sawyer-Tower circuit [24, 25] which is shown in Figure 4.5b.  In the 
bridge, Co is a standard capacitor with a capacitance much larger than that of the 
sample Cs.  The voltage, V, is applied to Cs and to plates 1 and 2 of the 
oscilloscope, which have a small capacitance. Then, the electric charges, Q, stored 
in Cs and Co should be equal. The voltage between plates 3 and 4 is  then equal to 
Q/Co. The curve of Q/Co versus the applied voltage V can then be observed. For 
loss-free dielectrics, or nonferroelectrics, the charge stored on the sample

electrodes should be proportional to V and a linear relationship between them 
should be observed. If a material inserted as Cs is ferroelectric, the charge Q will be 
proportional to the electric displacement D, (DE=0 = Q/A, therefore, Q = ADE=0,
where A is a unit area), instead of to the electric field E, and a hysteresis loop 
should be observed.  The electric displacement is vectorially defined as 
D = HoE + P 
(4.31) 
where Ho is the vacuum permittivity, E is the applied electric field (which equals 
V/d), V is the applied voltage, d is the thickness of the sample, and P is the 
polarization magnitude. If the change in the electric displacement with the applied 
electric field exhibits a hysteresis loop when the applied electric field is changed 
alternatively, reaching a maximum in one direction, passing through a zero field 
and reaching a maximum in the opposite direction, the material usually possesses 
spontaneous polarization, Ps, i.e. the polarization persists when the electric field is 
returned to zero. However, the stable polarization, or remanent polarization, Pr is 
usually less than Ps due to the thermal motion of molecules that form dipoles, or 
thermal disturbance.  By the relationship  shown in Eq. (4.31), the spontaneous 
polarization, Ps, is represented by the intersection of P at E = 0, whereas the field 
needed to switch the polarization, or coercive field, Ec, is represented by the 
intersection at D = 0.  Practically, the D vs. E hysteresis is considered a typical 
characteristic of a ferroelectric. Figure 4.6 shows a typical ferroelectric hysteresis 
loop with the important ferroelectric characteristics [26]. As mentioned earlier, a 
transition phenomenon is commonly observed in ferroelectrics. When the 
temperature is above the Curie transition temperature, the spontaneous polarization 
of a material decreases rapidly to zero, that is, the material changes from 
ferroelectric to become paraelectric, or nonferroelectric.  Accompanying the 
transition, a large change in the electric permittivity, or dielectric constant, is 
generally observed. Curie-Weiss, in 1907, developed the relationship between the 
measured dielectric constant and temperature [27]. When the temperature is above 
the transition temperature, the dielectric constant becomes

4.4 Ferroelectric and Piezoelectric Polymers 
Investigations of piezoelectric effects in polymers have been carried out since 1924 
when Brian first studied a number of dielectrics, including some polymers [28].  
However, no significant piezoelectric response had been observed until 1969 when 
Kawai discovered that poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVF2), prepared by a proper 
thermal, mechanical, and poling treatment, can show unusually large piezoelectric 
coefficients[1]. Thereafter, the piezoelectricity, pyroelectricity, and ferroelectricity 
of PVF2 and related mechanisms have been extensively studied worldwide. 
Bergman and co-workers first reported in 1971 that PVF2 was pyroelectric as well 
as piezoelectric and speculated on the possibility that PVF2 was ferroelectric 
[29,30]; this was later confirmed by others [31–34]. Meanwhile, the crystal 
structures of PVF2 had been studied by Lando et. al. and the polymorphism of 
PVF2 crystal structures was reported [35–37]. Investigations of the origins of 
piezoelectric and pyroelectric properties and mechanisms of ferroelectricity of 
PVF2 were carried out and reported by Wada, Broadhurst, Davis, and Kepler et. al.
[38–44].  Based on the piezoelectricity and the ferroelectricity of the E-phase 
(phase I) PVF2 and knowing that copolymers of vinylidene fluoride (VF2) and 
trifluoroethylene (VF3) crystallize directly from the melt into the E-phase crystal 
structure, VF2-VF3 copolymers were developed and their piezoelectricity and 
ferroelectricity were also extensively investigated [43–49]. 
Another class of ferroelectric and piezoelectric polymers is odd-numbered 
polyamides (nylons).  Hydrogen bonds formed by –NH and –C=O groups provide 
essential polar elements for piezoelectricity in the polymer.  The significant 
piezoelectric properties of nylon 11 were studied and reported in the early 1980s 
[50–52].  Its ferroelecticity was predicted based on study of its chemical structures

and crystal phases.  However, the ferroelectricity in nylons was not confirmed until 
1990 when Scheinbeim et al. reported a typical ferroelectric hysteresis loop from 
the electric displacement, D, vs. the applied electric field, E, test of specially 
treated nylon 11 films [53–55]. 
 
4.4.1 Models and Origins of Piezoelectricity of Polymers 
The origins of piezoelectricity in polymers have been being discussed for more 
than two decades.  Several models have been introduced since 1978 for the only 
ferroelectric and piezoelectric semicrystalline polymer, at the time, PVF2, by 
Broadhurst and Davis [56], Taylor and Purvis [57], Taylor and Al-Jishi [58], and 
Wada and Hayakawa et. al. [59]. 
Figure 4.7. A schematic of the mechanism of piezoelectricity in semicrystalline polymers 
due to the libration of polar domains  
Figure 4.8. A schematic of the mechanism of piezoelectricity based on the analysis of 
response of  unsymmetrical distribution of charge
In the Broadhurst and Davis model, sample dimension effects and local field 
effects as well as dipole libration and space charge effects are included. Figure 4.7 
shows a schematic of the mechanism of dipole libration for piezoelectricity in a 
semicrystalline polymer. A Lorentz approximation was used to determine the local 
field and dipole polarizability. Through the calculation of the hydrostatic 
piezoelectric coefficient, it was concluded that 34% of the experimentally  
measured coefficient arose from the local field effect, 10% from dipole fluctuations,

and 56% from dimensional changes. The Taylor-Purvis model is based on the 
consideration of point dipoles and an orthorhombic lattice for determination of the 
local field, but the dipole libration and space charge effects were not included. 
Later, Taylor and Al-Jishi modified the Taylor-Purvis model by introducing a 
better approximation for the dipoles. For the modification, the dipoles were 
represented by separated charges instead of by point dipoles.  
Wada and Hayakawa proposed a model based on an analysis of the response of 
charges unsymmetrically distributed in materials. The schematic of the mechanism 
is shown in Figure 4.8, considering a point charge q in the bulk of a polymer 
sample. If the electrodes are shorted, the induced charges on the electrodes, Q1 and
Q2, are, respectively,

(4.33) 
where C1(C2) is the capacitance between the upper (lower) electrode and the plane 
passing through q parallel to the electrodes. This equation indicates that the 
magnitudes of Q1 and Q2 change when the ratio C1/C2 changes with applied strain; 
this results in a piezoelectric current in the external circuit. Three possibilities exist 
for the measured change in Q1 and Q2 with strain: 
1) The charge q is not fixed to the macroscopic plane in the material and moves 
out of the plane as a function of strain, that is, the displacement of the point charge 
is not the same as the macroscopic displacement in the material. This strain is 
called internal strain. 
2) The charge q is fixed to the material (embedded charge), but C1/C2 changes 
with strain owing to the heterogeneity of the materials.  Since the capacitance is  
proportional to H/d (d is the separation of the two plates constituting the capacitor), 
heterogeneity in the electrostriction constant and/or Poisson's ratio induces the 
change in C1/C2.
3) The material possesses a spontaneous polarization which changes either due 
to internal or external strain.

result of sample heterogeneity, representing the piezoelectricity due to mechanism 
2), whereas the intrinsic piezoelectricity appears in the average ¢ei², including the 
contributions of mechanisms 1) and 2). 
Later, Wada and Hayakawa modified the point charge model for 
semicrystalline polymers containing polar crystals [60]. In this model, polar 
crystals, as spherical particles, which possess spontaneous polarization Psc and 
dielectric constant H c, are embedded in an  isotropic amorphous matrix with 
dielectric constant Ha. The origins of Psc may be due to dipolar orientation in the 
crystal, dipolar orientation in the oriented amorphous phase, and dipoles arising 
from the trapped charges in the interfacial region. Based on this model and with the 
assumption of N spheres of volume v, the following equation is derived:

An alternative approach based on a two-phase system of crystals embedded in

From Eq. (4.39), it should be noted that the heterogeneity of the 
electrostriction, dimensional change, or strain dependence, Poisson's ratio, and 
intrinsic piezoelectricity (polarization) are considered main effects on the measured 
piezoelectric response.  The comparison of the proposed mechanisms is 
summarized in Table 4.1. 
The origins of the piezoelectric properties of polymers are still not completely 
understood.  Contributions of dimensional change and polarization as well as  
electrostriction effects are widely accepted.  It is also suggested by several 
researchers that space charge effects should be considered as another significant 
factor [29].  It is believed that the space charge plays an important role in the 
piezoelectric properties of polymers.  Space charges can have two effects on 
spontaneous polarization, Ps: direct contribution to polarization and modification 
of the local field during the poling process, which gives rise to local heterogeneity. 
Coupled with an appreciable heterogeneity, space charges can contribute to the 
measured piezoelectricity of a sample (previously mentioned mechanism 2).

Detailed discussion on the contributions of mechanisms presented here can be 
found in the references [56–59]. However, due to the complicated nature of the 
piezoelectric properties of polymeric materials, it is extremely difficult to 
determine exactly which theoretical model is closest to presenting the real 
mechanisms. However, the theoretical models proposed by researchers are useful 
in providing insight into the physical basis of the observed piezoelectricity. 
4.4.2 Representative Ferroelectric and Piezoelectric Polymeric Materials 
4.4.2.1 
Polyvinylidene-Fluoride (PVDF or PVF2) and its Copolymers 
The discovery of the significant piezoelectric response of poly(vinylidenefluoride) 
(PVF2) films which were mechanically stretched followed by electrical poling 
initiated comprehensive investigations of structure and morphology of the polymer. 
The investigations led to several significant accomplishments in understanding the 
intrinsic mechanisms of the ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties of PVF2. The 
understanding of the nature of ferroelectricity and piezoelectricity in PVF2,
including the formation of polymorphic crystal structures,  the control of 
semicrystalline morphology, and the thermal stability of crystal phases, as well as 
their effects on ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties, guided the development 
of a series of PVF2-based copolymers with trifluoroethylene.  Systematic studies of 
this class of polymers have resulted in a more comprehensive understanding of the 
mechanisms of ferroelectricity and piezoelectricity of this type of polymer, 
especially the phase transition phenomena. Several review papers have been 
published separately by Wada and Hayakawa [38], Furukawa [42], Davis [40], 
Lovinger [61], and Kepler and Anderson [41,62]. 
Structures and Ferroelectricity of PVF2
The repeatunit in the molecular structure of PVF2 is –CF2–CH2–.  The –CF2–
groups are perpendicular to the molecular chain axis and are primary dipoles

contributing to the remnant polarization. When the molecules crystallize, four 
primary crystal phases can be formed. They are D phase (II), or trans-gauche-trans-
gauche' (TGTG') phase,  E phase (I), or all-trans (TT) phase, G phase (III), and J
phase (IV), or trans-trans-trans-gauche-trans-trans-trans-gauche' (TTTGTTTG'). 
The TGTG' conformation of D phase (II) and the molecular chain packing in the 
crystal result in a nonpolar unit cell.  The other three phases are polar. However, E
phase (I) which has an all-trans (TT) conformation is the most stable polar phase.  
D phase (II) and E phase (I) are the two most commonly studied and understood 
because D phase (II) is the primary thermodynamically stable phase when PVF2
film is formed by solution processing and thermal processing techniques, whereas 
E phase (I) is the desired phase for electromechanical activities (ferroelectricity and 
piezoelectricity). Figure 4.9 shows a schematic representation of the view parallel 
to the chain axis in a crystal unit for a comparison of nonpolar D phase (II) and 
polar E phase (I). The dipole cancellation due to the opposite orientation of the 
polar groups happens in D phase (II), whereas the dipoles in E phase (I) are all 
aligned in one direction.

Figure 4.9. A schematic comparison of the view parallel to the chain axis in crystal units of 
(a) nonpolar D phase (II)  and (b) polar E phase (I)
To make E  phase (I) PVF2, mechanical stretching, electrical poling, and 
combinations of mechanical and electrical processing are commonly used to 
transfer thermodynamically stable and nonpolar D  phase (II) PVF2 to 
electromechanically active polar E phase (I). Figure 4.10 provides a block chart 
demonstrating the routes to make polar E phase (I) PVF2 from nonpolar D phase 
(II) PVF2.
In the as-mechanically-stretched PVF2 film, the polar axis, i.e. the dipole 
moment axis, is randomly oriented to the stretching direction. An electrical poling 
treatment is needed to make the dipole axis reorient to align predominantly along 
the poling z-axis, that is, perpendicular to the film’s plane.  The field-induced 
dipole alignment in phase I crystals has been investigated by Raman spectroscopy, 
x-ray diffraction, and infrared dichroism [60], and all of the investigations suggest 
that the phase I crystal form in PVF2 is ferroelectric according to the observation of 
polarization reversal via a cooperative switching process.

Ferroelectricity in PVF2 was suggested by Bergman [29], Nakamura, and Wada 
[31] in 1971. Since then, various experimental findings in agreement with this 
speculation have been reported [63–69], particularly the hysteresis loop of 
spontaneous polarization Ps, the piezoelectric coefficient e, and the pyroelectric 
coefficient py, as well as the infrared absorbency vs. the poling field.  Details of the 
dipole switching mechanisms in PVF2 crystals occurring during poling are still not 
known. Suggested possible mechanisms are a) rotation of individual chains or 
cooperative rotation of a small number of chains around the chain axis, b) motion 
of domain walls, c) rotation of individual crystals, and d) intramolecular rotation 
(for the transition between phase II and phase IV).  A theoretical model for dipole 
alignment in a polarizing field was first proposed by Aslasen [70].  Dvey-Aharon 
et.al. developed a theory of kink propagation as a model for poling [71,72]. 
Broadhurst and Davis presented a cooperative dipole orientation model.  It is 
commonly accepted that the dipole orientation in the polymer is close to being 
perpendicular to the surface of the sample through a 60r switching mechanism, if 
the sample is sufficiently poled [32]. 
The ferroelectric phase I of PVF2 does not show a Curie point [73] or 
ferroelectric-paraelectric transition in thermal characterization even though it 
exhibits clear typical ferroelectric D-E hysterisis when a Sawyer-Tower circuit-
based ferroelectric characterization is conducted. The reason for the interesting 
phenomenon was not understood until it was observed that with an increase in the 
content of introduced defects, such as head-head (H-H) or tail-tail (T-T) joints in 
the chain, phase I, instead of phase II, might become the energetically stable phase 
[74].  
Lando and Doll reported that copolymers of the VF2, (–CH2–CF2–), and VF3, (–
CHF–CF2–), when the VF3 content is more than 17 mol %, accommodate the more 
extended all-trans conformation, which is similar to phase I of PVF2 [75]. Yagi et.
al. synthesized the copolymers with various relative mole compositions (50-80 mol 
%) in 1979 [76]. Because of the advantage of being crystallized directly into the 
planar zigzag (all-trans) conformation, which is similar to phase I of PVF2, the 
ferroelectricity and piezoelectricity of these copolymers have been extensively 
studied [77]. Ferroelectric transition phenomena have been observed in 
investigations of the copolymers. Curie transition temperatures of the copolymers 
were found to be dependent on the relative compositions of VF2 and VF3. The 
higher the VF2 content, the higher the Curie transition temperature.  If the VF2

content is higher than 81 mol %, the Curie transition disappears because the 
transition temperature of such copolymers is higher than the melting temperature, 
which also explains why PVF2 homopolymer does not show a Curie transition 
[78]. Table 4.2 provides the melting temperatures and the Curie transition 
temperatures of various copolymers and PVF2 homopolymers.  If (Tm–Tc) < 0, the 
Curie transition temperature cannot be observed by a thermal test such as a 
differential scanning calorimeter (DSC).

Piezoelectricity of PVF2
The piezoelectric properties of semicrystalline polymers, such as PVF2 and its 
copolymers, are determined by the remanent polarization in the materials and the 
mechanical properties. The remnant polarization depends primarily on the 
crystallinity, or the content, of polar crystals and the alignment of the polar crystal 
domains. The most popular method to increase crystallinity is thermal treatment, or 
annealing. The annealing temperature should be significantly above the glass 
transition temperature and below the melting temperature and Curie transition 
temperature if the Curie transition temperature is lower than the melting 
temperature. In the effective temperature range, the higher the temperature, the 
better the annealing effect. The method to generate good alignment of polar crystal 
domains, that is, the remnant polarization, is electrical poling. Three primary 
factors are important for poling the materials to achieve high remnant polarization: 
poling temperature, poling field, and poling time. Generally, higher poling 
temperature, higher poling field, and longer poling time result in a higher remnant 
polarization. Usually, an optimization of the three primary factors is needed for the 
best poling effect. A well-poled (at room temperature) uniaxially stretched (five 
times) PVF2 film usually can offer the remanent polarization, Pr, of 50 mC/m2 and 
a piezoelectric strain coefficient, d31, of 25 pC/N at room temperature (d31 means 
that the electric signal collected in the out-of-surface direction, direction 3, is 
generated by the mechanical force applied in the in-surface direction, direction 1). 
The piezoelectric response of a poled PVF2 depends on the temperature.  When the 
temperature is below its glass transition temperature, Tg, which is around –50 oC,

Ferroelectric Polymers for Electromechanical Functionality 111 
the piezoelectric strain coefficient is very small (less than 2 pC/N) above its Tg, the 
piezoelectric strain coefficient increases and reaches the maximum around room 
temperature. As the temperature keeps increasing, the piezoelectric coefficient 
starts to decrease around 50oC due to thermal depolarization [79].  
4.4.2.2 
Odd-numbered Polyamides (Nylons) 
Another class of representative ferroelectric and piezoelectric polymers is odd-
numbered polyamides (nylons).  Hydrogen bonds formed by –NH and –C=O 
groups provide essential and stable polar elements in the polymer for 
piezoelectricity. The significant piezoelectric properties of nylon 11 were studied 
and reported in the early 1980s [50].  Its ferroelecticity was predicted based on 
study of its chemical structures and crystal phases.  However, ferroelectricity in 
nylons was not confirmed until 1991 when Scheinbeim et al. reported a typical 
ferroelectric hysteresis loop from the electric displacement, D, vs. the applied 
electric field, E, test of a specially treated nylon 11 film.  The film was produced 
by a melt-quench and cold-stretching method. The melt-quenched and cold-
stretched nylon 11 not only exhibited the ferroelectric switching mechanism but 
also increased its piezoelectric property significantly compared to that previously 
reported, especially at an elevated temperature [53–55]. The discovery has led to a 
series of achievements in research on the ferroelectricity and the piezoelectricity of 
odd-numbered nylons, including nylon 9, nylon 7, and nylon 5, in Scheinbeim’s 
group in the following years [82].  
Molecular structures and ferroelectricity of odd-numbered nylons
The alpha-phase crystal structure of nylon 11 suggested by Slichter in 1959 is 
polar. The molecular conformation of the proposed structure is all trans, and for an 
odd-numbered nylon, this entails a net dipole moment per chain.  Figure 4.11 
shows the molecular structures of odd-numbered nylons and even-numbered 
nylons) [79]. As can be seen, in odd-numbered nylons, the electric dipoles formed 
by amide groups (H–N–C=O) with a dipole moment of 3.7 Debyes are sequenced 
in a way that all the dipoles are in the same direction. Therefore, a net dipole 
moment occurs. In even-numbered nylons, one amide group is in one direction, the 
next one will be in the opposite direction, alternately. This results in an intrinsic 
cancellation of the dipole moments, as demonstrated schematically in the figure. 
The ferroelectricity of nylon 11 and nylon 7 was discovered by Lee et al. in 1991, 
when typical electric displacement, D, versus electric field, E, hysteresis loops 
were obtained.  The reversion of polarization for the ferroelectricity in the nylon 11 
films was confirmed in molecular structure characterization by x-ray diffraction 
(XRD) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) [80]. The typical ferroelectric 
characteristics were also observed in the following studies on other odd-numbered 
nylons, including nylon 9, nylon 7, and nylon 5 films produced using the melt-
quench and cold-stretching method [82].

numbered nylons (Adapted from J. Su [79]) 
The investigation also discovered that cold-stretching following melt-quenching is 
a very critical step in obtaining the polyamide chains in the parallel form needed 
for ferroelectric polarization switching and piezoelectricity.  For instance, when a 
nylon 11 film is prepared using a melt-quenched, uniaxially cold draw technique, a 
doubly oriented structure is formed, with dipole orientation in the sheet plane 
parallel to the surface of the film, whereas the molecular chains are oriented in the 
drawing direction.  There are two possible molecular arrangements: parallel 
(progressive) chain packing and antiparallel (staggered) chain packing, which are 
known as the molecular bases of the D form and E form crystals, respectively.  In 
both cases, hydrogen bonded sheets are formed.  A 90o followed by an 180o
polarization switching mechanism was reported for nylon 11.  When an electric 
field is applied in the direction perpendicular to the film surface, the dipoles rotate 
to the field direction by 90o from a doubly oriented state to parallel to the applied 
electric field.  In the following polarization reversals, the dipoles switch by 180o
when the applied electric field reverses direction [81]. A diagram of the simplified 
switching mechanism is shown in Figure 4.12 and the arrows represent the 
orientation of the axial direction of the neighbering molecular chains (up or down 
alternatively as the arrows indicate).

The remnant polarization of ferroelectric odd-numbered nylons is a function of the 
number of carbon atoms per repeat unit, which is decisive for the electric dipole

density. The smaller the number, the higher the dipole density. The 
interrelationship between the number and the remnant polarization is tabulated in 
Table 4.3 as reported by Mei et.al. in 1993 [82].

*Predicted 
Piezoelectricity of some representative odd-numbered nylons
As with the piezoelectric properties of PVF2, the piezoelectric properties of odd-
numbered nylons, as semicrystalline polymers, are determined by the remanent 
polarization in the materials and the mechanical properties. The remnant 
polarization primarily depends on the crystallinity, or the content, of polar crystals 
and the alignment of the polar crystal demains. Thermal annealing is the most 
popular method to increase crystallinity. However, for odd-numbered nylons,  the 
melt-quench and cold-stretching process is critical for the parallel sheet structure 
formed by hydrogen bonds. Parallel-sheet-structured, the odd-numbered nylons can 
generate typical ferroelectric property, and therefore, can result in expected 
piezoelectric properties after being poled.  Three primary factors are important for 
poling the materials to achieve high remanent polarization: poling temperature, 
poling field, and poling time. Generally, a higher poling temperature (higher than 
glass temperature), higher poling field, and longer poling time generate higher 
remnant polarization. Usually, an optimization of the three primary factors is 
needed for the best poling effect. For instance, a well-poled (at room temperature) 
melt-quenched and uniaxially stretched (3.5 times at room temperature) nylon 11 
film usually can possess a remanent polarization, Pr, of ~50 mC/m2 and offer a 
piezoelectric strain coefficient, d31, of 2.8pC/N at room temperature. The d31 is 
much less than that of PVF2 at room temperature because the piezoelectric 
response of a poled nylon 11 also depends on the temperature, and room 
temperature is below its glass transition temperature (which is around 70oC). As 
the temperature increases above its Tg, the piezoelectric strain coeffiecient 
increases to as much as 9pC/N [79].   

114
J. Su
Lee et.al. reported, in 1991, that annealing of poled nylon 11 and nylon 7 
results in both an enhanced piezoelectric strain coefficient and improved 
piezoelectric stability [53].  Annealed odd-numbered nylons (both nylon 11 and 
nylon 7) possess high and stable piezoelectric properties at high temperatures (up 
to 200oC), which is a significant advantage over PVF2 which melts at ~182oC.
Figure 4.13 shows a comparison of the temperature dependence of the piezoelectric 
strain coefficients of annealed nylon 11, nylon 7, and PVF2.

4.4.2.3 
Ferroelectric and Piezoelectric Polymer-polymer Composite Systems    
Nylon 11-PVF2 bilaminates
The development of the two ferroelectric and piezoelectric polymers: PVF2 and 
odd-numbered nylons provides the possibility of making all-polymer ferroelectric 
and piezoelectric composite systems. Using PVF2 and nylon 11, Su, et.al. 
developed nylon 11-poly(vinylidene fluoride) bilaminates by a co-melt-pressed-
stretched process in 1995 [83]. The bilaminate exhibits a typical ferroelectric D-E
hysteresis loop with significantly enhanced remnant polarization, Pr, of 75 mC/m2,
which is 44% higher than those of individual nylon 11 or PVF2 films made by an 
identical process. The results of the D-E hysteresis ferroelectric characterization of 
a 1:1 bilaminate are shown in Figure 4.14a with a comparison with those of 
individual PVF2 and nylon 11. The piezoelectric strain coefficients, including the  
strain coefficient, d31, the stress coefficient, e31 and the hydrostatic coefficient, dh,
also show significant enhancement. The enhancement in the piezoelectricity 
becomes more obvious when the temperature is above the glass transition 
temperature of nylon 11. Figure 4.14b shows the temperature dependence of the 
piezoelectric strain coefficient, d31, of a nylon 11-PVF2 bilaminate having a 1:1 
ratio with a comparison to that of individual nylon 11 and PVF2.

nylon 11/PVF2 bilaminate, (b) PVF2, and (c) nylon 11 films.  (Adapted from J. Su et al.
[83]) 
The enhancement is attributed to interfacial space charge accumulation and the 
asymmetrical distribution of the accumulated space charges in the direction across 
the interface between the two constituents [84]. The remnant polarization and 
piezoelectric coefficients of the bilaminates are a function of the fraction of the two 
constituents because the fraction of the two constituents decides the distribution of 
the effective electric field on each constituent due to the difference in their 
dielectric constant, therefore, the distribution of the accumulated space charges in 
the interfacial region.
Nylon 11-PVF2 blends
In 1999, Gao et. al. reported the development of nylon 11-PVF2 blends which also 
exhibit significantly enhanced remnant polarization, Pr. The Pr of the blend with 
the 50:50 composition is 85 mC/m2, which is more than 60% higher than those of 
individual nylon 11 and PVF2 [85].  The curves of the electric field displacement, 
D, versus the applied electric field, E, are shown in Figure 4.15.  The same paper 
also reported that the ferroelectricity of the blends depends on the fraction of the 
two constituents and that the enhancement might also be attributed to the space 
charge accumulation and distribution [86]. The piezoelectric strain coefficient, d31,
of nylon 11-PVF2 blend films also shows significant enhancement compared with 
individual nylon 11 and PVF2 films. The coefficient depends on the the fraction of 
the two constituents in blends.

Summary of Ferroelectric and Piezoelectric Properties of Ferroelectric 
and Piezoelectric Polymers 
To summarize the ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties of the ferroelectric and 
piezoelectric polymers discussed, some important ferroelectric and piezoelecetric 
parameters are tabulated in Table 4.4.   
Table 4.4. Summary of ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties 
As discussed in the previous sections, the ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties 
of polymeric and polymeric composite systems depend on various factors, such as 
crystallinity, poling conditions, glass transition temperature, and before- and after-
poling treatments (electrical, mechanical, and thermal treatments).  In addition to 
the factors mentioned above, for composite systems, laminates, or blends, the 
fraction of constituents and interfaces are also important.  Therefore, the properties 
tabulated may vary due to the dependence of the ferroelectric properties and

4.5 Remarks 
Electroactive polymers including ferroelectric and piezoelectric polymers and their 
applications are still relatively new research fields. Due to several advantages of 
electroactive polymers over electroactive ceramics (light weight, good 
processability, low cost, and mechanical toughness, etc.) these research fields have 
been drawing more and more attention of researchers worldwide since the 
significant ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties of poly(vinylidene fluoride), 
PVF2 or PVDF, were discovred and reported in 1969.  In the past three decades, 
various ferroelectric piezoelectric polymers have been developed.  Among them, 
PVF2 and its copolymers and odd-numbered nylons are two representative classes 
of polymers that have been systematically investigated, and the mechanisms of 
their ferroelectricity and piezoelectricity have been well understood. This chapter 
provides readers with primary information about these two classes of ferroelectric 
and piezoelectric polymers and these polymer-based ferroelectric and piezoelectric 
polymer-polymer composite systems.  The information provided may serve readers 
as a guideline for understanding the nature of ferroelectric and piezoelectric 
polymers and for developing techniques to tailor or control the ferroelectric and 
piezoelectric properties as desired.

5.1 Summary 
Polypyrrole actuators are low-voltage (1–3 V), moderate to large strain (2–35%), 
and relatively high stress (up to 34 MPa) actuator materials.  Strain rates are 
moderate to low, reaching 11%/s, and frequency response can reach several hertz.  
Faster response (> 1 kHz) is anticipated in nanostructured materials.  Forces can be 
maintained with minimal power expenditure.  This chapter reports on the current 
status and some of the anticipated properties of conducting polymer actuators.  
Applications investigated to date include braille cells, shape changing stents, and 
variable camber foils.  Situations where low voltage operation is valuable and 
volume or mass are constrained favor the use of conducting polymers.   
Polypyrrole and other conducting polymers are typically electrochemically 
driven and can be constructed in linear or bending (bilayer) geometries.  Synthesis 
can be by chemical or electrochemical means, and raw materials are generally very 
low in cost.  These polymers are electronically conducting organic materials.  They 
also allow ions to diffuse or migrate within them. An Increase in the voltage 
applied to a polymer electrode leads to removal of electrons and an increasingly 
positive charge within the volume of the polymer.  This charge is balanced by 
negative ions that enter the polymer from a neighboring electrolyte phase (or by 
positive ions that leave).  Ion insertion is generally accompanied by expansion of 
the polymer.  The ions, solvent, and synthesis conditions determine the extent of 
this expansion, which can be anisotropic.  A change in modulus has also been 
observed as a function of the oxidation state. 
Models relating charge, strain, voltage, stress, and current have been developed 
that allow designers to evaluate the feasibility of designs.  One of these modeling 
approaches is presented with the aim of enabling selection of appropriate device 
geometry. 
The field of conducting polymer actuators is developing rapidly with larger 
strains, stresses, cycle lifetimes, and rates reported every year.  The background 
needed to understand these developments and to decide if polypyrrole and in 

122 J. D. Madden 
general conducting polymer actuators are appropriate for use in a given application 
is provided. 
5.2 Introduction and Overview 
Conducting polymer actuators are relatively new, and applications are at an early 
stage of development.  In this article, basic properties and models are presented, 
and a few example applications are given, in the hope that this information will 
guide and stimulate further applications.  The introduction provides a general 
overview, following the format of a recent review article on electroactive polymers 
[1]. Many of the topics are discussed subsequently in more detail, including an 
overview of conducting polymer properties, a description of electrochemical 
synthesis of the polymers, and a brief overview of two basic device configurations.  
This is followed by a discussion of models that are intended to guide design.  
Conducting polymers are electronically conducting organic materials featuring 
conjugated structures, as shown in Figure 5.1.  Electrochemically changing the 
oxidation state leads to the addition or removal of charge from the polymer 
backbone, shown in Figure 5.2, and a flux of ions to balance charge.  This ion flux, 
often accompanied by solvent, induces swelling or contraction of the material [2–
8].  Insertion of ions and solvent between polymer chains likely induces the 
majority of the volume changes. Conformational changes in the backbone may also 
play a role.  Changes in oxidation state and in dimension can also be chemically 
induced [6]. 
Important advantages relative to most other electroactive polymers are the high 
tensile strengths, which can exceed 100MPa [9], and large peak stresses of up to 
34MPa [10].  The stiffness is also higher than in many electroactive polymers, 
with the modulus generally exceeding 0.1 GPa and often reaching ~ 1 GPa 
modulus [11–13].  Furthermore, the modulus can be a function of oxidation state, 
potentially enabling controllable stiffness [14]. A major advantage over 
piezoelectrics, electrostatic actuators, dielectric elastomers, and ferroelectric 
polymers is low voltage operation (~ 2 V), which is particularly useful in portable, 
battery-driven applications, and often enables the actuators to be driven without the 
need for extensive and costly voltage conversion circuitry.  Initial work 
demonstrated only moderate strains of several percent – much greater than 
piezoceramics, but less than those observed in a number of other emerging 
actuation technologies [1].  Recent work has demonstrated that significantly larger 
strains can be obtained, in excess of 35% for a few cycles and routinely around 9% 
[15–17].

general, the polymer expands when ions are inserted
The electromechanical coupling is generally less than 1%, except for small strains 
[18,19]. This means that only a small fraction of the input electrical energy is 
converted to mechanical work [1]. This does necessarily mean that the efficiency is 
low because much of the input electrical energy is stored and can be recovered.  
The principal impact is the need to shunt a lot of charge, as discussed below. This 
shunting can become an issue for the power supply in large devices. Encapsulation 
is often required to contain electrolyte, which is generally in the form of a liquid or 
gel. Strain rates are moderate (11%/s max to date [20]), but there is an opportunity 
for substantial improvement [18]. Rates are limited by internal resistance of the 
polymers and electrolytes and by mass transport rates of ions inside the polymer 
[18,21]. 
Experiments show that strain, H, is proportional to the density of charge, U,
transferred over a range of strains of about 1% or more:

where V is the applied stress and E is the elastic modulus [4,9,11,18,19]. The strain 
to charge ratio, D, is approximately r1–5u10-10m3C-1 [22]. The strain to charge 
ratio is negative when cations dominate the ion transfer and positive when anions 
serve to balance charge [5]. For larger strains, this relationship continues to hold to 
first order.  When loads exceed several megapascals, creep and stress relaxation 
can be significant [10]. 
In some systems, the volume change observed appears to be close to the 
volume of ions inserted [22,23], but often this model of actuation is an 
oversimplification.  For example, the polymer can exhibit gel-like behavior, where 
change in oxidation state is associated with large solvent flux, large volume 
changes, and significant changes in modulus [24]. 
Rate is determined by the speed at which charge can be injected.  Current is 
restricted by the resistance of the cell (when electrochemically activated) and by 
the rate at which ions are transferred within the polymer [18,19,21].  Some of the 
internal resistance can be compensated for, leading to substantially faster rates, as 
discussed below [25].  The fastest response occurs in thin, highly conducting films 
[12]. Changes in oxidation state have been observed at kilohertz rates [26].

Polypyrrole Actuators: Properties and Initial Applications 125 
Polypyrrole and polyaniline are the most widely used conducting polymers, but 
actuation has also been demonstrated in polyacetylenes [3], polythiophenes, and 
polyethyldioxithiophene [27]. Starting materials are readily available (e.g.,
www.aldrich.com, www.basf.com ). Electrodeposition is commonly used [28], 
producing thin (~0.3–40 Pm thick) films with typical widths of 10 mm and lengths 
up to 1 m or more.  An example synthesis process for polypyrrole is described 
below. Samples may be electrodeposited as tubes [29], often with an ingrown 
conductor to improve conductivity and maximize rate.  Chemical synthesis may 
also be used in polypyrrole and other conducting polymers [30–32].  The 
properties of the polymers are very dependent on the solvent and salts used in 
deposition and also the electrolyte employed during actuation [8,11,13,33–40].  For 
example the cycle life (for redox cycling at least, and potentially for actuation) can 
be extended to approximately one million cycles from several tens of thousands by 
using ionic liquid electrolytes [32]. 
Forces can reach tens of newtons with displacements of several millimeters, 
and mechanical amplification increases displacements up to about 100 mm [41].  
Voltages of only 1–2 V are sufficient for activation, but higher voltages help speed 
the response by overcoming internal resistance [42]. Currents reach hundreds of 
milliamperes.  When not moving current is minimal, even when forces are applied.  
In such a case, virtually no energy is expended, and the condition is known as a 
catch state.  This state is particularly useful where actuation is intermittent because 
no power is dissipated during periods where the actuator is simply holding a load. 
Response under conditions other than room temperature and pressure have 
received little attention.  Conductivity and mass transport are expected to decrease 
in proportion to the square root of absolute temperature, affecting rates at low 
temperatures.  Electrolyte freezing will drastically reduce rate.  Typical freezing 
temperatures are between –60oC and 0oC. Creep may increase substantially with 
temperature.   
Conducting polymers are well suited to low voltage, moderate to high force, 
and small length scale applications.  For macroscopic applications to be effective, 
layers of thin porous films could enable extremely fast, high power response (> 
100 kW/kg) [18].  Recovery of stored electrochemical energy should enable 
moderate efficiencies to be achieved even at full strain.  Newly designed 
conducting polymers promise larger strains and higher electromechanical coupling 
but are still at an early stage of development [17,43–46].  
Data and models valuable to engineering design of conducting polymer 
actuators, and particularly polypyrrole based actuators, are provided by Madden  et 
al. [18,19] and Mazzoldi et al. [13], a discussion of current status, promise and 
remaining challenges is given by Smela et al. [47,48].  Some early work on 
applications including braille cells, variable camber hydrofoils, and actively 
steerable catheters are provided by Spinks [49], Madden et al. [41,50] and De 
Rossi [51], respectively.

5.3 Polypyrrole and Conducting Polymers – Background 
What are conducting polymers, and what other properties do they have that can be 
useful in robotics?  This section defines conducting polymers based on their 
molecular structure and describes their electronic properties.   
Conducting polymers exhibit electronic conductivity, making them unusual 
among organic materials, as depicted in Figure 5.3 [52,53].  A defining feature of 
conducting polymers is their conjugated backbone, seen in Figure 5.1, enabling 
some degree of electron delocalization and hence electronic conduction, akin to the 
electronic behavior in benzene and graphite [54].   
The polymers shown in Figure 5.1 are semiconductors.  Charge carriers must 
overcome a band gap to become delocalized and enable conduction [55].  The band 
gap in polyacetylene is 1.7 eV [56].  Conductivity decreases with temperature, as 
the number of carriers with sufficient thermal energy to reach the conduction band 
is reduced.  The band gap is reduced in a process analogous to doping in crystalline 
semiconductors [56]. Doping involves the addition or removal of charges from the 
polymer chain, resulting in structural changes and the creation of states in the band 
gap.  These changes in polymer oxidation state are generally performed chemically 
or electrochemically.  In the chemical doping process, electrons or protons are 
effectively donated to or withdrawn from the polymer backbone via chemical 

Polypyrrole Actuators: Properties and Initial Applications 127 
reactions with dopant molecules.  In electrochemical doping, the conducting 
polymer is in electrical contact with an electrode in an electrochemical cell, as 
shown in Figure 5.4.  Electrons are added to or removed from the polymer via the 
electrode, thereby changing the oxidation state.  The electrochemical oxidation 
process leads to a change in the polymer charge state, which is balanced by the flux 
of ions to or from the electrolyte.  These ions are referred to as dopants. 
Although the doping process is analogous to doping in silicon and other 
crystalline semiconductors, there are some notable differences.  Doping levels in 
conducting polymers are much higher, reaching one dopant for every two or three 
monomer units on the polymer backbone.  The dopant need not be a donor or an 
acceptor in conducting polymers, often it is present simply to maintain charge 
balance.  Charge carriers in the polymer are not simply electrons or holes, but are 
coupled with local conformational distortions in the polymer chain, among other 
differences [57].  In the doped state, conductivities can be appreciable, as shown in 
Figure 5.3.  
In general, doping is chemically or electrochemically reversible.  Conductivity 
can be switched by up to 13 orders of magnitude, an effect used in electrochemical 
transistors [58].  Reversible doping is used in many applications including 
batteries, electrochromic devices, supercapacitors, and chemical sensors, as well as 
being associated with volume change.  The dimensional changes are used to 
perform mechanical work, as shown in Figure 5.4.  Thus, actuation in conducting 
polymers is derived from dimensional changes associated with changes in the 
polymer oxidation state.

Conducting polymers are extremely versatile materials which have been employed 
to make high energy density storage devices, sensors, gas filters, generators, 
computational elements, display technologies, conductive wires, strong fibers, and 
actuators [57].  This diversity, combined with techniques for processing and 
patterning, make conceivable the fabrication of entire, multifunctional, and 
autonomous devices from a single material, as is currently being done with silicon 
microelectromechanical systems. Conducting polymers have a number of 
advantages over silicon, including much higher energy storage capability and an 
actuator technology that is superior in a number of respects.  For example, the 
capacitance of > 100 F/g in polypyrrole [59, 60] is about five orders of magnitude 
higher than that achieved on the surface of silicon.  The polymer actuators operate 
at low voltages, unlike the piezoelectrics and electrostatic actuators used in silicon 
microelectromechanical systems, offer much higher work densities than 
electrostatics, and ten or more times the strain offered by piezoceramics [61]. 
In conducting polymers, actuation is the result of molecular level interactions.  
The ability to tailor material properties by molecular design creates the potential to 
rationally design polymers that will achieve required mechanical properties.  
Ultimately, it may be possible to develop molecular stepping motors akin to 
muscle.  Steps towards this goal are already being taken [1,62,63].  This article 
focuses on the current performance of conducting polymer actuators.  This is a 
rapidly developing field however, in which performance limits are continually 
being pushed to new limits. 
5.4 Synthesis 
Properties of conducting polymer actuators are critically dependent on synthesis 
conditions.  All polypyrrole actuators and many others reported in the literature are 
electrochemically synthesized, and thus an example electrodeposition proceedure 
is presented here.  Electrochemical synthesis leads to the highest conductivity and 
the best mechanical properties in polypyrrole.  It is also the most accessible method 
to nonchemists.  The method presented leads to very conductive and high tensile 
strength films and requires only readily available solvents, salts, and monomers.  A 
source of current is all the instrumentation required.  The amount of material 
deposited depends only on time and current. 
In this commonly used method, films are grown as summarized in Figure 5.5. 
A solution of 0.06 M freshly distilled pyrrole monomer (Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI, 
USA, www.aldrich.com) and 0.05 M tetraethylammonium hexafluorophosphate 
(Aldrich) in propylene carbonate is employed, following the procedure of Yamaura 
and colleagues [28]. The pyrrole monomer need not be distilled, but the 
conductivity and mechanical proerties are greatly improved by purification.  If 
distillation is not available, the pyrrole monomer, which is a liquid at room 
temperature, can be purified by passing it through activated alumina or stirring in 
alumina powder and then removing the powder using a filter.  Polypyrrole is 
deposited galvanostatically (constant current) onto polished glassy carbon 
substrates (Alfa Aesar, Ward Hill, MA, USA, www.alfaaesar.com) at current 
densities of between 1 and 2 Am-2, resulting in a film thickness between 8 and 100 

Polypyrrole Actuators: Properties and Initial Applications 129 
Pm, depending on time.  Other substrates can be used, including platinum, gold, 
and stainless steel.  When using gold or stainless steel, it is found that thicker films 
can lift off the mandrel during electrodeposition, leading to films that look bubbled 
or warped.  This liftoff may be reduced by employing a roughened surface.   A 
copper counterelectrode is used.  For best results, deposition should take place at 
temperatures between –30qC and –45qC in a nitrogen saturated solution. The 
resulting films have conductivities between 20 and 45 kSm-1, densities of 1500 to 
1800 kg·m-3 dry, and tensile strengths that can exceed 100 MPa.   
The polished glassy carbon substrates take the form of either 100 mm u 100 
mm u 1 mm thick plates, or a crucible.  The crucible is employed to obtain films 
that are up to 1.5 m in length, with a width of 4 mm.  Figure 5.6 shows the crucible 
after deposition, including the Kapton© tape that is spirally wound to mask the 
surface so that a continuous film is electrodeposited.  Also shown is a 1.3 m long 
film that has been removed from the crucible.

The reaction steps involved in electrochemical synthesis have been proposed by 
Baker and Reynolds [64] and are shown in Figure 5.7.  It is not necessary to 
understand the synthesis steps, but it can help in analyzing failed depositions.  
When current density is too low, the solution is sometimes black, often indicating 
that only oligomers (short chains) have been formed.  These short chains drift away 
from the electrode before they reach a the critical size for precipitation onto the 
electrode. 
As synthesized, polypyrrole has a backbone configuration shown at the bottom 
of Figure 5.2, where roughly one-third of the monomers are charged [28,34,64-66].  
The backbone charge is balanced by the presence of anions.  In this state, 

130 J. D. Madden 
polypyrrole is shiny black in appearance and has typical conductivities of up to 
~104 Sm-1, reaching 105 Sm-1 when stretch aligned [28]. Reduction leads to a 
semiconducting state, shown in Figure 5.1.   
In bulk, the monomer costs ~US$1.00 per kilogram.  The estimated minimum 
cost of electrodeposited polypyrrole is ~$1.50 per kilogram. 
Variations on the method presented include growth on a platinum wire onto 
which a smaller wire is spirally wound [67].  The smaller wire is incorporated into 
the polypyrrole that is grown onto the larger wire, and the polypyrrole plus small 
wire are pulled off the larger wire following deposition.  A key advantage of this 
approach is that the small wire increases electrical conductivity and hence, in many 
cases, the rate of actuation.  It also allows the polymer to be taken deeper into its 
reduced (nonconducting) state, allowing larger actuation.  In a variation of this 
approach, polymer is grown onto a spirally wound wire that does not have a core.  
This approach relies on the polymer growing between spiral windings but does not 
require removal of the large diameter wire.

The polypyrrole described typically produces strains in the 2–4% range.  Larger 
strains can be obtained by varying deposition conditions.  For example, Kaneto et
al. showed a >10% strain by operating polypyrrole in an aqueous (water-based) 
solution of NaPF6 [68], and larger strains have been claimed in other papers 
[16,44].  Spinks, Wallace, and others at the University of Wollongong and Santa 
Fe Science and Technology have shown that growth in propylene carbonate 
followed by redox cycling in ionic liquids can lead to increased cycle life, 
suggesting that it may be possible to increase the lifetime beyond 1 million cycles 
[32,69]. 

Polypyrrole Actuators: Properties and Initial Applications 131 
5.5 Actuator Configuations and Applications 
Some applications require large forces, other large displacements, and sometimes a 
combination of both is needed.  There are two common actuator configurations – 
linear actuators in which films or fibers contract or expand producing linear 
displacement, and bending actuators in which a bending motion is produced.  The 
advantage of bending actuators is that they produce large displacements, but this is 
done at the expense of force.  Linear actuators generate high forces – typically in 
the range of 1 to 10 MN per square meter of cross-sectional area–but their change 
in length can be relatively small – generally 1–10 % of the original length.  In 
designing a device, the challenge is then to scale up the forces produced by 
bending actuators or scale up the displacements produced by linear actuators [41].  
Bending actuators consist of two or more laminated films, as depicted in Figure 
5.8.  In the simplest case one of the films contracts leading to bending.  If two 
sheets of polypyrrole are used, then one may expand while the other contracts.  In 
this case, the sheets are separated by an ionically conductive medium.   
The equations for the deflections and forces of bilayer and trilayer structures 
follows the same approach as is used in bimetallic strips [5]. For a trilayer in which 
both outer layers are active polymer of the same thickness and equal and opposite 
strain, separated by a passive layer, the equations for relative curvature, K, charge 
per unit volume, ȡ, and force at the end of the beam, F, are [70]

Figure 5.8. Bilayer and trilayer actuation configurations. In bending bilayers and trilayers, 
one layer expands whereas the other is passive or contracts, leading to a bending motion. 
An example trilayer actuator is shown in Figure 5.9 [41].  It is employed to create a 
camber change in a propeller blade.   The structure generates 0.15 N of force.  
Bilayers have been shown to be very effective for microscale actuation and have 
been used by Elisabeth Smela and her colleagues to create contracting fingers, cell 
enclosures, moveable pixels, and “micro-origami.”  Micromuscle.com in Sweden 
is working to commercialize actuated stents and steerable catheters, which appear 
to use the bilayer principle for operation [51].

Figure 5.4 shows the basic geometry of a linear actuator approach.  As in all 
actuator configurations, a counterelectrode and an electrolyte are required. 
Generally, a mechanism must be available to allow transmitting force and 
displacement to the load.  Thus, the counterelectrode, electrolyte, and any 
packaging must not significantly impede actuation.  Also, the counterelectrode 
must accept a tremendous amount of charge from the polymer actuator, which 
stores charge within its volume with an effective capacitance of approximately 100 
Farads per gram of polymer.  The counterelectrode is best made of a polymer that 
can itself absorb a lot of charge without requiring a large voltage or degrading the 
electrolyte.  One of the simplest solutions is to employ a conducting polymer 
counterelectrode.   
In some cases with linear actuators, no amplification of strain is needed.  One 
such application is the creation of braille cells for the blind.  These tablets feature 
arrays of pins that must be actuated up or down in a pattern across a tablet so as to 
generate text and refresh once the reader has completed the page.  A group at the 
University of Wollongong in collaboration with Quantum Technology of Australia 
is developing a braille display in which each pin is driven by a polypyrrole tube 
actuator [71]. The polypyrrole tube is grown on a platinum wire (~ 0.5 mm 
diameter) which has a smaller diameter wire wrapped around it (~ 50 Pm).  The 
polypyrrole with the small wire encapsulated in it is removed from the larger wire 
by sliding it free. This approach allows relatively long actuators to be produced 
which, when driven with large currents, have very little voltage drop along their 
length due to the incorporation of the platinum wire.  Voltage drop needs to be 
prevented because a gradient in voltage leads to a different degree of strain as a 
function of length along the actuator. Sections of the actuator distant from the 
electrical contact points receive very little charge and produce negligible actuation 
when the resistance of the actuator is large.  The spiral winding of the wire allows 
its mechanical stiffness to be low, minimally impeding the strain of the 
polypyrrole.  The hollow core enables electrical and mechanical connection via a 
wire.  Tensile strengths are not as high as in the freestanding films, but operation at 
several megapascals of stress is common. 
Figure 5.10 shows an example of a linear-actuator-driven variable camber foil 
[41].  In this case, a lever mechanism is needed the 2% strain of the polypyrrole 
employed needs mechanical amplification by a factor of 25.  The actuators shown 
produce 18 N of force, which is reduced to 0.7 N in the process of amplifying the 
displacement.  The actuators are sheets of freestanding polypyrrole. 
5.6 Modeling and Implications for Design
In this section, a model of the relationship between electrical input and mechanical 
output is presented and used to explore the advantages and limitations of 
conducting polymer actuators.  The presentation is similar to that given elsewhere 
by the author [18,19].  In particular rate limiting factors are discussed, as well as 
factors that determine efficiency and power consumption.  These considerations 
allow designers to determine the feasibility of employing conducting polymers in 
specific applications and then to generate designs.

which is found to describe the behavior of polypyrrole and polyaniline actuators to 
first order under a range of loads and potentials.  In polypyrrole grown in PF6
- , for 
example, if it is operated at loads of several megapascals and below and kept 
within a limited potential range (~ -0.6 V to +0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl), this equation 
works resonably well. The strain to charge ratio, D, is analogous to a thermal 
expansion coefficient, but for charge rather than temperature.  In conducting 
polymers, the strain to charge ratio is experimentally found to range from 0.3–
5u10-10 m3C-1 for polypyrrole and polyaniline actuators [9,13,19], and the modulus 
ranges between 0.1 and 3 GPa [12,13,72].

E(t, V), the time and voltage dependent modulus [19,22].  The modulus has been 
found to exhibit both time and voltage dependence, showing a viscoelastic 
response at higher  loads, for example [18]. When taken over large potential 
ranges, the modulus can change significantly, leading to increases or decreases in 
strain as load increases, depending on whether the change in modulus adds or 
subtracts from the active strain [3,72]. Over long time periods (> 1000 s) at high 
stresses (> 10 MPa), the modulus becomes highly history dependent [73].  Also, 
rate of creep can be enhanced during actuation [10]. The strain to charge ratio can 
be load independent, but frequency and time dependence have been observed [10]. 
The strain to charge ratio is particularly time dependent when more than one ion is 
mobile, a situation that is particularly difficult to model when both positive and 
negative ions move, simultaneously swelling and contracting the material [5].  The 
strain to charge ratio can also change as a function of voltage.  
5.6.1 Relationship Between Voltage and Charge at Equilibrium 
A complete electromechanical description includes input voltage in addition to 
strain, stress, and charge.  In conducting polymers, the relationship between 
voltage and charge is difficult to model because the polymer acts as a metal at one 
extreme and an insulator at the other.  A wide range of models have been proposed.  
In  general, the response is somewhere between that of a capacitor and a battery 
[13,74–80].  In a capacitor, voltage and charge are proportional, whereas in an 
ideal battery, the potential remains constant until discharge is nearly complete.  In 
oxidation states where conductivity is high, it is not unusual to find that charge is 
proportional to applied potential over a potential range that can exceed 1 V [18], 
thereby behaving like a capacitor [19,22,76,79–81].  In hexafluorophosphate-doped 
polypyrrole, this capacitance is found to be proportional to volume [22], and has a 
value of CV =1.3108 Fm-3 [19].  At equilibrium, the strain may then be expressed 
as

where V is the potential applied to the polymer.  In many conducting polymers and 
for extreme voltage excursions, the capacitive relationship between voltage and 
charge is not a particularly good approximation.  These situations are difficult to 
model from first principles, so an empirical fit to a polynomial expansion in charge 
density may provide the most practical approach.  The capacitative model is useful 
in evaluating rate-limiting factors even if the relationship between voltage and 

Polypyrrole Actuators: Properties and Initial Applications 137 
charge is complex.  In such cases, the capacitance is determined by dividing the 
charge transferred by the voltage excursion.  Before considering rate-limiting 
mechanisms, some considerations in choosing maximum actuator load are 
presented. 
5.6.2 Position Control and Maximum Load 
The designer must determine the stresses at which to operate an actuator.  
Conducting polymer actuators are able to actively contract at 34 Mpa [22,82].  In 
general, however load induces elastic deformation and creep [19,22,82–84].  To 
maintain position control, the actuator must be able to compensate for these effects.  
Over short periods, only the elastic response need be considered.  The elastic strain 
induced by load is simply the ratio of the load induced stress, 'V, and the elastic 
modulus, E.  This strain must be less than or equal to the maximum active strain, 
Hmax, for an actuator to maintain position: 
E
V
H
'
t
max
.
 (5.7)  
The maximum strain is typically 2% in PF6
- doped polypyrrole, and the elastic 
modulus is 0.8 GPa, suggesting that the peak load at which elastic deformation can 
be compensated for is 16 MPa.  At 20 MPa, the sum of the creep and the elastic 
deformation reaches 2% after ~ 1 hour, as shown in Figure 5.11.  The designer 
must determine the extent of elastic deformation and creep that is acceptable and 
the time-scale and cycle life of the actuator.  Measured creep and stress-relaxation 
curves and viscoelastic models will then assist in determining the appropriate 
upper bounds in actuator stresses.

138 J. D. Madden 
In some designs, the maximum load will be determined by the maximum stress that 
can be actively generated by the actuator from an unloaded condition, or when 
acting against another actuator (an antagonist).  In such cases, peak stress 
generated is simply given by the product of the modulus and the active strain:

(5.8) 
This peak stress will be observed at zero strain.  For tetraethylammonium-doped 
polypyrrole this peak stress is once again 16 MPa.   
5.6.3 Actuator Volume 
How much space will a conducting polymer actuator consume?  Many applications 
allow only limited volumes.  Where a single actuator stroke is used to create 
motion, as in the action of the biceps muscle to displace the forearm or of a 
hydraulic piston on a backhoe, the amount of work performed per stroke and per 
unit volume, u, is a key figure of merit.  The actuator volume required, Volmin, is 
determined based on the work , W, required per cycle: 
u
W
Vol
t
min
             
(5.9)
This volume is the minimum required because energy delivery, sensors, linkages, 
and often means of mechanical amplification generally also need to be 
incorporated.

Work per unit volume is the integral of stress times incremental strain.  The 
maximum stress against which mammalian skeletal muscle can maintain position is 

Polypyrrole Actuators: Properties and Initial Applications 139 
350 kPa and typical strain at no load is 20% in vivo [61].  The achievable strain in 
muscle decreases with increasing stress, the work density is less than 70 kJm-3, the 
product of the peak stress and strain, and in general will be in the range [85] of 8–
40kJ·m-3.  Work densities of 70 kJ·m-3 have been reported in polypyrrole [72] and 
exceed 100 kJ·m-3 in new, large strain polypyrrole [68].  Note that unlike muscle, 
conducting polymers can perform work both under compression and tension, and 
therefore can generate a further doubling in work per volume where this property is 
used.  
5.6.4 Rate and Power 
Generally, in any given application,  a certain rate of response or output power is 
required.  This section is dedicated to presenting a number of factors that determine 
the rate of response and estimating how rate will be a function of geometry in such 
cases.  Other factors affecting rate are polymer and electrolyte conductivities, 
diffusion coefficients, and capacitance.  The equations presented enable the 
designer to determine the physical and geometrical constraints necessary to achieve 
the desired performance.   
As discussed, conducting polymers respond electrically as batteries or super-
capacitors with enormous quantities of charge stored per unit volume.  The 
capacitance can exceed 100 F/g [22].  Given that strain is proportional to charge, 
high strain rates and powers require high currents.  Although other factors could 
also limit rate, including inertial effects and drag, the generally moderate to low 
rates of actuation in conducting polymers to date suggest that such situations are 
unusual.  
The factors that limit current in conducting polymer actuators are the same as 
those that limit the discharging rate in batteries and supercapacitors.  Internal 
resistance is one factor.  To charge and discharge a battery, the time limit due to 
internal resistance is the product of the total amount of charge multiplied by the 
resistance and divided by the voltage.   In a capacitor, the time constant is 
determined by the product of the internal resistance and the capacitance.  The two 
are essentially equivalent because the capacitance is the ratio of the charge and the 
voltage.  The second major limiting factor that will be discussed is the rate of 
transport of ions into the polymer.   Another factor that could also limit response 
time is the rate at which electrons are exchanged between the conducting polymer 
and the contacting metal electrode (kinetics). This will not be discussed because it 
is considered not to be a significant factor, providing that the conducting polymer 
is in a relatively highly conducting state.  More complex effects than those 
discussed here can also arise due to changes in ionic and electronic conductivity as 
a function of voltage, which often lead to the advancing of sharp fronts of 
oxidation state through the material rather than a concentration gradient observed 
in diffusionlike behavior.  Models for these effects are being evaluated and are 
likely important when the oxidation state of the polymer is brought substantially 
down toward the completely reduced state [21, 86].  Mechanical relaxation and 
solvent swelling may also be important [21].  These cases will not be covered here.

behaving as a capacitance.  The right-hand expression restates the impedance in 
terms of the polymer capacitance per unit volume, CV, and the polymer volume, 
Vol.  Details of the derivation, assumptions, and physical significance of the 
variables are provided elsewhere [12,19].  In essence it assumes that the rate is 
determined by either RC charging or the time it takes for ions to go through the 
polymer.  It also assumes that ionic mobiility or the diffusion coefficient does not 
change significantly over the range  of potentials employed and that the electrical 
conducitivity within the polymer is sufficiently high to eliminate any potential

drop.  A time constant accounting for potential drop along the polymer due to finite 
electrical conductivity is discussed below. 
The model provides a reasonable description of hexafluorophosphate-doped 
polypyrrole impedance over a 2 V range at frequencies between 100 PHz and 100 
kHz [19,22].  It also suggests the rate-limiting factors for charging and actuation.  
One is the rate at which the double layer capacitance charges, which is limited by 
the internal resistance, R.  A second is the rate of charging of the volumetric 
capacitor, which is determined by the slower of the rate of diffusion of ions 
through the thickness and the RCVVol charging time.  These time constants and 
their implications are discussed further below. 
The impedance model represented in Figure 5.12 is very general in the sense 
that the time constants derived from it are present in all conducting polymer 
systems.  As a result, it provides a good basis for describing all systems.  A more 
general model will require the addition of finite and changing electronic and ionic 
conductivities, kinetics effects, and material anisotropies. 
Ion transport within the polymer can be the result of diffusion or convection 
through pores, molecular diffusion, or field-induced migration along pores 
[13,22,76,77,79–81,88,89]. The mass transport model described by Eq. (5.10) 
appears to represent only a diffusion response. Eq. (5.10) mathematically describes 
all of these effects, not just diffusion.  The equivalent circuit for the diffusion 
element is shown in Figure 5.14. It is identical to the equivalent circuit used to 
describe migration and convection and thus these effects are indistinguishable 
based on the form of the frequency response alone.  It is quite likely that the 
diffusionlike response is due to a combination of internal resistance (ionic or 
electronic) and internal capacitance.

may represent solution resistance, or fluid drag, and the capacitors double layer charging or

resistance is significant compared to that of the adjacent electrolyte. In this case, the 
resistance is that of the polymer, and the capacitance is the double layer capacitance or the

5.6.4.1 Polymer Charging Time 
In conducting polymers, charging occurs throughout the volume.  Independent of 
the nature of the charge-voltage relationship (e.g., battery or capacitor), the charge 
density is delivered through an internal resistance.  There are two primary sources 
 of resistance – the electrolyte and the polymer.  To minimize electrolyte 
resistance, the electrolyte ideally covers the polymer surface area on both sides, A
= 2lw, with as small an electrode separation, d, as possible (refer to Figure 5.13 
for dimensions).  In a liquid electrolyte, the conductivity, Ve, can be a high as 1 to

where electrolyte resistance is large compared to the polymer resistance.  To 
charge a 10 Pm thick film in 1 s and given an electrolyte conductivity of 10 Sm-1,
the electrolyte dimension, d, must be less than 20 mm. 
The polymer resistance can dominate RC charging time in long films, poorly 
conductive polymers, or over a range of potentials where the conducting polymer 
is no longer in its quasi-metallic state.  In such a case, the combination of the film 
resistance and the volumetric capacitance forms a transmission line, as depicted in 
Figure 5.14, with the polymer resistance along the length of the film.  The charging 
time constant can be reexpressed in terms of the polymer conductivity, Vp, and the 
film length, l:

The factor of 4 is appropriate only when both ends of the film are electrically 
connected. If the electrical connection is only from one end, the four is replaced by 
one.  A 20 mm long film having a conductivity of 104 Sm-1 (typical of 
hexafluorophosphate-doped polypyrrole) has a time constant WRCVP = 1 s. 
The keys to improving RC response times are to reduce the distance, l,
between contacts, the distance between electrodes, d, and the polymer thickness, a.
Maximizing electrolyte and polymer conductivities is also important.  Finally, if 
the volumetric capacitance can be reduced without diminishing strain, the charge 
transfer is reduced.  New polymers are being designed and tested whose strain to 
charge ratio is much larger and capacitance is lower [90].  These polymers promise 
to charge faster while also developing greater strain, compared to polypyrrole. 
5.6.4.2 Resistance Compensation 
Higher current in a circuit can generally be achieved by applying higher voltage. 
However, extreme voltages applied to the polymer lead to degradation.    There is a 
simple case in which the application of a high voltage for a short amount of time 
will lead to faster actuation without degradation.  If the solution resistance (and any 
contact resistance) is large compared to the polymer resistance, then immediately 
after the application of a step in potential, nearly all the potential will be across this 
series resistance.  This is essentially the same as a series RC circuit, in which 
initially all the potential drop is across the resistor.  At long times, as in the series 
RC circuit, all potential drop is across the capacitor.  If we can prevent the 
resistance across the polymer from exceeding a threshold value, then we can avoid 
degradation while having increased the initial rate of charging and hence the 
actuation rate [19]. 

Polypyrrole Actuators: Properties and Initial Applications 143 
The polymer diffusion impedance, ZD, and double layer capacitance, C, in 
Figure 5.12, act as a low-pass filter.  The electrolyte resistance is then easily 
identified (e.g., using a step, impulse, or high-frequency sinusoidal input).  The 
product of the current and the resistance, IR, is the drop across the electrolyte.  
Subtracting this voltage from the total applied potential, V, provides an estimate of 
the double layer potential, Vdl.  If the double layer potential should reach but not 
exceed a voltage, Vdl
max, then the controller must simply maintain the input voltage 
such that the applied potential V:

This method effectively eliminates the rate-limiting effects of the resistance, R, in 
Figure 5.12 [42,91].  The remaining rate-limiting factors are then due to polymer 
resistance and mass transport, which are now discussed.  The method does not 
work if polymer resistance is similar in magnitude or larger than the cell resistance. 
5.6.4.3 Mass Transport 
Ions move in the polymer to balance charge during oxidation and reduction.  This 
can occur by molecular diffusion [19,22], conduction, or diffusion through 
electrolyte filled pores [76,77,79–81,88,89] and convection through pores [13].  
The mathethematical form of the solutions is represented by Equation (5.10).  The 
mass transport related charging time constant is

(5.15) 
where D is the effective diffusion coefficient and a is the film thickness.  The 
factor of 4 is removed if ions have access only from one side of the film.  Diffusion 
coefficients in hexafluorophosphate-doped polypyrrole appear to range[19,22]  
between 0.7 and 7 u 10-12 m2s-1.  To obtain a 1 s response time, the polymer film 
thickness must be less than approximately 5 Pm.   
5.6.5 Summary of Rate-Limiting Effects 
Volumetric charging times, (WRCV and WRCVP) and diffusion time (WD) are key rate-
limiting factors that can be minimized by reducing the distance between electrodes, 
d, the spacing between contacts, l, and the film thickness, a.  Reduction in film 
thickness and length are particularly effective because diffusion time and 
volumetric charging time are proportional to the squares of these lengths.   
How fast could a conducting polymer film actuate?  A 10 nm thick polypyrrole 
actuator that is several micrometers long is predicted to exhibit a diffusion time 
constant of 3 Ps. Charge and discharge curves from similarly thin 
electrochemically driven transistors and electrochromic devices approach such a 
rate [26, 58].   The need for small dimensions to achieve fast response suggests that 
conducting polymer actuators are well suited for micro- and nanoscale

applications.  The next section takes a general look at what applications and scales 
are currently attractive for conducting polymer actuators. 
5.7 Opportunities for Polypyrrole Actuators 
Established actuator technologies used in robotics [92] for which artificial muscle 
technologies might offer an alternative include internal combustion engines, high-
revving electric motors, direct drive electric motors, and piezoelectric actuators. 
Conducting polymers are not ready to compete with the internal combustion engine 
and high-revving electric motors in high power propulsion systems.  They are 
appropriate for intermittent or aperiodic applications with moderate cycle life 
requirements and could replace solenoids, direct drive electric motors, and some 
applications of piezoceramics.  This section follows the format of the introduction 
in a paper on the application of polypyrrole in variable camber foils [93] which 
seeks to answer the general question where conducting polymer actuators are 
useful.  The challenges in creating large, high power actuators based on conducting 
polymers are then discussed in Section 5.8 using the example of a simulated biceps 
muscle.   
5.7.1 Propulsion 
The internal combustion engine with its 1000 W/kg power and fuel energy of ~43 
MJ/kg is hard to beat for high-speed propulsion of automobiles and ships.  Electric 
motors achieve specific power similar to the internal combustion engine and 
efficiencies of >90% [92].  Fuel cells and hybrid engines provide energy sources 
that make such high revving electric motors feasible.   Of the available actuator 
technologies, only shape-memory alloys and piezoceramic actuators clearly 
surpass the power to mass of internal combustion engines and electric motors [61], 
but there are efficiency and cycle life issues with shape-memory alloys and 
mechanical amplification challenges with piezoelectrics.  Can conducting polymers 
offer any advantages in propulsion? 
The power densities of conducting polymers and carbon nanotubes are within a 
factor of four of the combustion engine [94].  Their musclelike nature may make 
polymers and nanotubes more suitable for biomimetic propulsion – such as robot 
walking, swimming, or flying.  However, the low electromechanical coupling of 
conducting polymers (ratio of mechanical work output to electrical energy input) 
means that either the efficiency will be low, or additional energy recovery circuitry 
will be required.  No polymer-based actuator technology has yet demonstrated 
cycle lifetimes [90] of more than 107 and thus lifetime is generally not long enough 
for sustained propulsion.  For example, continuous operation at 10 Hz may lead to 
failure after 10 days or less. Conducting polymer and other novel polymer 
actuators do not yet offer compelling alternatives to electric motors and 
combustion engines for high power, continuous propulsion. 

Polypyrrole Actuators: Properties and Initial Applications 145 
5.7.2 Intermittent Actuation 
Motions such as the grasping of parts by a robot arm, the opening of a valve, and 
the adjustment of a hydrodynamic control surface are difficult to perform using 
high revving electric motors and combustion engines.  Direct drive electric motors 
are often used instead. Direct drive motors suffer from relatively low torque and 
force.  Honda’s elegant servomotor driven Asimo, for example, is limited in 
walking speed to ~ 2 km/hr due to the low torque of its muscles 
(http://world.honda.com/ASIMO/P3/spec/). Also electromagnetic actuators expend 
energy to hold a force even without displacement, wasting energy.  Conducting 
polymers expend minimal energy while holding a force, feature high work density, 
and produce high stresses and strains, making them well suited for discontinuous, 
aperiodic tasks such as the motion of a robotic arm or the movement of a fin [85].  
Some challenges are encountered in using the current properties of conducting 
polymers for moderate to large scale applications, as explained in the next section. 
5.8 Challenges in Fabrication and Energy Delivery: 
Example – Biceps Muscle 
To contract quickly, conducting polymer actuators need to be thin.  They also have 
relatively low electromechanical coupling.  Low electromechanical coupling does 
not necessarily mean low efficiency, as energy can be recovered from conducting 
polymers due to their capacitive nature.  However, it does imply that a much larger 
amount of electrical energy needs to be transferred to the polymer than the amount 
of work performed, this energy then is either dissipated or recovered.  Conducting 
polymer actuators operate at low voltages and the coupling is low, the implication 
is that currents will be very high in large, high power devices.  Thin films and 
relatively large currents are less of a concern in micro and nano devices where 
dimensions are small, heat transfer is good, and batteries are readily available.  
However in scaling up even to moderate size, the challenge can be considerable, as 
made clear in the example of creating a biceps muscle.   
The biceps muscle does about 45 J of work in one stroke [18].  Using Eq. (5.9) 
relating work and work density to the minimum actuator volume and assuming a 
work density of about 100 kJ/m3, the volume of conducting polymer required to 
produce this work is approximately 500 ml.  For the contraction to occur in one 
second, then based on Eq. (5.15), the polymer thickness must be about 5 Pm.  
Assuming a biceps length of 150 mm and a square cross section that is 55 mm 
across, 11,000 layers of conducting polymer are needed to achieve the desired 
speed.  Equation (5.l2) predicts that the counterelectrode must be placed within 40 
mm of the working electrode, and thus will have to be integrated with it.  Equation 
(5.13) suggests that the electrical contacts to the polymer must be spaced by less 
than 20 mm.  The need for the multiple thin layers and separators suggests a 
considerable fabrication challenge.  This may be eased by using porous polymers 
in which mass transport is enhanced by allowing ions to travel into the polymer via 
liquid filled capillaries [59].  Nevertheless the challenge is significant. 

146 J. D. Madden 
The current needed to charge a conducting polymer bicep is substantial.  
Assuming a capacitance of 130 farads per ml (based on 100 F/g), it will take about 
65 000 C, which needs to be delivered within 1 second.  Normally such huge 
currents would be unthinkable.  Fortunately, beacuse conducting polymers act as 
energy storage devices, enough energy for one cycle can be stored in the counter-
electrode (which likely will also be polymer, and act as the antagonistic muscle – 
e.g., triceps).  90% or more of the input energy is recoverable [19,22], a 
combination of batteries and capacitors can be used to store the additional 10 % of 
energy needed for each cycle.  The fabrication and control are not trivial, however.   
As the size scales down, the currents also drop dramatically.  For example, a 1 
mm3 actuator needs only about 130 mA of current.  At present, moderate to small 
size actuator applications are the most promising for conducting polymer actuators.  
Larger devices require substantial attention to the details of design and fabrication.  
New materials are being developed [63,95] which promise to dramatically increase 
electromechanical coupling and reduce the amount of charge transferred, easing 
scaling issues [90]. 
5.9 Summary of Properties 
The chapter has described the current state of synthesis, modeling, application, and 
analysis of polypyrrole actuators.  Polypyrrole and other conducting polymer 
actuators are evolving rapidly, with strains increasing dramatically over the past 
two years alone, for example [96,97].  It is likely that further improvments will be 
made in cycle life [98] and possibly also in load bearing capacity.  Currently, the 
advantages and limitations of polypyrrole actuators are 
Limitations: 
Mass transport of ions and the high capacitance limits rates of actuation; high 
rates are several hertz, though these can potentially reach kilohertz 
frequencies using microstructured electrodes.
Low electromechanical coupling and low voltage operation mean that very high 
currents are needed to drive large actuators at moderate speeds, making 
scaling a challenge.  In principle, high currents can be delivered by 
polymer supercapacitors, solving the problem.
Cycle life is still only moderate, limiting the range of applications unless 
regeneration or replacement strategies can be used.
If a liquid electrolyte is to be used, some encapsulation is often required. 
Advantages: 
Low voltage operation (several volts), 
Low cost, flexible materials, 
High work density (~100 kJ/m3),
Moderate stress (1–5 MPa typical), 
Moderate to high strain (2 – >20%), 
Catch state (no work expended to hold a load),

Ionic Polymer-Metal Composite as a New Actuator and 
Transducer Material 
K. J. Kim 
Active Materials and Processing Laboratory, Mechanical Engineering Department (MS 312), 
University of Nevada, Reno, Nevada 89557, U.S.A. 
6.1 Introduction 
Ionic polymer-metal composites (IPMCs) are a unique polymer transducer that 
when subjected to an imposed bending stress exhibits a measurable charge across 
the chemically and/or physically placed effective electrodes of the electroactive 
polymer. IPMCs are also known as bending actuators capable of large bending 
motion when subjected to a low applied electric field (~10 kV/m) across the 
metalized or conductive surface (Figure 6.1). The voltage found across the IPMC 
under an imposed bending stress is one to two orders of magnitude smaller than the 
voltage required to replicate the bending motion input into the system. This leads 
to the observation that the material is quite attractive by showing inclination for 
possible transduction as well as actuation [1–25]. In 1993, an IPMC was first 
reported as an active polymeric material by Oguro and his co-workers [21]. Since 
then, much attention has been given to IPMCs with the hope that they can be used 
as a soft actuator and sensor/transducer material for new opportunities in future 
engineering. IPMCs have been considered promising actuator materials, in 
particular for biorobotic applications. 
Figure 6.1. Actuation of a typical IPMC (from [8]) 
Part of what makes an IPMC so unique are its inherent transductive/sensing 
properties in addition to its actuation capabilities. Similar to piezo materials, 
IPMCs can show displacements under an applied electric field and can also 

154 K. J. Kim 
engender a current from an imposed bending moment that is applied to the material. 
The voltage can be as high as in the 10’s of millivolts range for larger imposed 
bending displacements. This makes IPMCs possibly effective for large motion 
sensor or damper applications if their behavior can be properly controlled. 
6.2 How IPMC Works 
In 2000, De Gennes et al. [18] presented a set of coupled equations based on linear 
irreversible thermodynamics to describe the behavior of a typical IPMC. The 
model is a compact description of the transduction and actuation principles 
inherent in the IPMC by defining it in the linear regime and in static conditions. 
They introduce the linear irreversible thermodynamic relationship for charge 
transport (with a current density J normal to the membrane) and solvent transport 
(with a flux Q) to describe this electromechanical coupling of ionic gels (i.e.
IPMCs, see Figure 6.2 [18]). The standard Onsager relations for the system have 
the form,

(6.2) 
Equations (6.1) and (6.2) couple the electric field, E, as well as the mechanical 
pressure gradient, p, the driving forces for the phenomenon involved.  These 
equations can be elaborated upon to explain the direct effect (actuation) as well as 
the inverse effect (sensing or transduction) of IPMCs.  Note that these Onsager 
relations developed by De Gennes et al. are for a static model.  Note also that ı,
L12 (=L21), and K are electric conductance, cross-coefficient, and permeability, 
respectively.

Ionic Polymer-Metal Composites as a New Actuator and Transducer Material 155 
IPMCs as transducers have been modeled and developed for actuation, sensing. 
and control applications by several investigators. Their work can be found 
elsewhere [19–25]. 
6.3 IPMC Manufacturing Techniques 
6.3.1 Metal Reduction Technique 
The current state-of-the-art IPMC manufacturing technique [6] incorporates two 
distinct preparation processes: initial compositing process and surface electroding 
process. Due to different preparation processes, the morphologies of precipitated 
platinum are significantly different. The initial compositing process requires an 
appropriate platinum salt such as Pt(NH3)4HCl for chemical reduction processes. 
The principle of the compositing process is to metalize the inner surface of the 
material (usually, Pt nano–particles, in a membrane shape) by a chemical-reduction 
means such as LiBH4 or NaBH4. The ion-exchange polymer is soaked in a salt 
solution to allow platinum-containing cations to diffuse through via the ion-
exchange process. Later, a proper reducing agent such as LiBH4 or NaBH4 is 
introduced to platinize the materials by molecular plating. It has been 
experimentally observed that the platinum particulate layer is buried a few microns 
deep (typically 1–10 Pm) within the IPMC surface and is highly dispersed. A TEM 
image near the boundary region of an IPMC strip on the penetrating edge of the 
IPMC shows a functional particle density gradient where the higher particle 
density is toward the surface electrode. Figure 6.3 describes Ni-doped IPMC 
manufacturing developed at the Active Materials and Processing Laboratory of the 
University of Nevada, Reno. 
6.3.2 Physical Loading Technique 
Although the traditional metal reduction processes described above are known to 
be effective in manufacturing IPMCs, one may realize that one drawback of using 
these processes is their relatively high cost due to the use of noble metals 
(platinum, gold, palladium, etc.) and associated complex chemical processes. For 
IPMCs to be successfully adopted as industrial actuators or sensors, one should be 
able to reduce their manufacturing cost significantly. One way to do so is to 
simplify the compositing and electroding processes.  
The principal idea of processing this new IPMCs is first to physically load a 
conductive primary powder into the polymer network forming a dispersed layer 
which can function as a major conductive medium near boundaries and, 
subsequently, to further secure such a primary particulate medium within the 
polymer network with smaller particles (Pd or Pt in this case) via a chemical 
plating process so that both primary and smaller secondary particles can be secured 
within the polymer network. Furthermore, an electroplating process can be applied 
to integrate the entire conductive phase intact, serving as an effective electrode. For 
more details, readers are referred to recent work done by Shahinpoor and Kim [15]. 

156 K. J. Kim 
This physical loading technique has been elaborated by Leo and his co-workers 
[25].  They used a high surface area-to-volume ratio of metal particulates to 
achieve high capacitance at low frequencies.

6.4 Engineering Properties of Interest 
In this section, important engineering properterties of typical IPMCs are presented.

Figure 6.4 shows the results of dynamic material analysis (DMA) tests for a 
pristine NafionTM film and a Ni-doped IPMC in tensile. The experiment was 
performed in air. In the tensile mode, Ni-doped IPMCs have higher storage 
modulus (E’) with regard to stiffness than pristine NafionTM film.

6.4.2. Electrical and Electrochemical Properties 
6.4.2.1 General Electrical Properties 
To assess the electrical properties of an IPMC, the standard AC impedance method 
that can reveal the equivalent electric circuit has been adopted. A typical measured 
impedance plot, provided in Figure 6.5, shows the frequency dependency of the 
impedance of the IPMC. It is interesting to note that the IPMC is nearly resistive in 
the high–frequency range and fairly capacitive in the low–frequency range.

Figure 6.5.  The measured AC impedance spectra (magnitude) of an IPMC sample [6] 
Based upon the above findings, a simplified equivalent electric circuit of the 
typical IPMC can be considered, such as the one shown in Figure 6.6. In this 
approach, each single unit-circuit (i) is assumed to be connected in a series of 
arbitrary surface-resistance (Rss) in the surface. This approach is based upon the 
experimental observation of the considerable surface-electrode resistance. We 
assume that there are four components to each single unit-circuit: the surface-
electrode resistance (Rs), the polymer resistance (Rp), the capacitance related to the 
ionic polymer and the double layer at the surface-electrode/electrolyte interface 
(Cd), and an impedance (Zw) due to charge transfer resistance near the surface

6.4.2.2 Electrochemical Properties 
Figure 6.7 shows cyclic voltammograms of an IPMC with platinum electrodes. 
Potentiostat/galvanostat (PGZ40, Voltalab) was used for the cyclic voltammetry as 
well as AC impedance. By examining the voltammogram of the IPMC, it is clear to 
see the polycrystalline characteristics of the platinum that has been significantly 
altered by the presence of the base polymeric material within the testing specimen 
showing a unique behavior. This exhibits the importance of the surface properties 
of the electrodes of an IPMC. The electrochemical behavior at the surface 
electrodes is yet to be determined and is currently under investigation.

6.4.2.3 Measurement of the Force-displacement Relationship 
The electromechanical properties considered are determined by the force–
displacement relationship of an IPMC actuator. The method used to measure these 
properties is graphically depicted in Figure 6.8. An IPMC actuator is cantilevered 
at one end, and the other end is constrained, as shown in Figure 6.8a. The reaction 
force (or actuation force) at the right end of the actuator is generated by an 

 
Ionic Polymer-Metal Composites as a New Actuator and Transducer Material 159 
electrical field. We measure the reaction force with a small force transducer. After 
the right-end constraint is moved up with amount of the displacement s , the same 
test is conducted. In this way, the actuation force corresponding to the end 
displacement s  can be measured, as illustrated in Figure 6.8b. Finally, without the 
constraint, the free end displacement can be determined. Following this procedure, 
the force-displacement relationship was obtained as shown in Figure 6.9. Figure 
6.9 shows the measured force-displacement relationship for an IPMC actuator for 
two- and three-volt inputs across the IPMC. Regions A and B in Figure 6.9 include 
the maximum actuation forces and the maximum displacements, respectively. The 
specimen tested was a NafionTM-based IPMC in Li+ form and plated with platinum. 
The length of the IPMC actuator was 20 mm with a width of 5 mm and a thickness 
of 0.3 mm.

6.5 Robotic Flapping Wings 
Pneumatic and motor-driven actuators have been widely adopted and used in 
aerospace applications as well as in other industrial robot systems. However, these 
actuators are not feasible for use in small or microscale flying and locomotive 
vehicles due to their large payload and system complexity. Furthermore, they are 
not suitable for mimicking the flapping motion of bird or insect wings. Using 
microrobots to create flapping flight is attractive due to their maneuverability that 
could not be obtained by conventional, fixed or rotary wing aircraft. An 
electroactive polymer, IPMC is a good candidate for the flapping motor because it 
is lightweight and can create a large deformation under low electric voltage input. 
Bird/insect wings can generate lift and thrust at the same time during flapping 
motion because the wing can flap and twist during the flapping motion [26]. To 
mimic the motion, the artificial flapping mechanism should also be able to create 
flap and twist simultaneously. Also, the width of a bird wing tip is pointed 
compared with the remaining parts of the wing. This reduces drag during the up-
/down-strokes of the wing and also strengthens the tip of the vortex. Thus, the 
actuation mechanism and shape are both important for successfully mimicking a 
bird wing. The IPMC can generate this particular motion if it has a specially 
designed plan form. 
Since the flapping wing must create a twisting motion as well as a bending up 
and down motion for thrust generation, the IPMC actuators have nonsymmetric- 
shapes, as shown in the two wings in Figure 6.10. The wing shapes and dimensions 
of the wings are also shown in Figure 6.10. Note that the areas of the IPMC 
actuators in the two wings are kept the same for fair comparison in the actuation 
displacement analysis. The wing itself is made of a thin plastic film.

The numerical deformation analysis has been conducted to determine the shape of 
the IPMC actuator such that the designed wing can produce maximum bending and 
twisting motion at the same time. Deformation of the wing has been estimated by 
using the equivalent bimorph beam model and MSC/ NASTRAN with the thermal 
analogy. For finite-element modeling, QUAD4 elements were used for both Wing 
#1 and #2 as shown in Figure 6.11a and Figure 6.12a. Material properties and 
thicknesses for the calculations are shown in Table 6.1.

The flap-up displacement and twisting angle at the tip under 3 V (i.e.,

E = 10 
V/mm) are calculated as 4.42 cm and 3.4º, for Wing #1, and 4.68 cm and 9.1º, for 
Wing #2. The deformed shapes are shown in Figure 6.11b and Figure 6.12b for 
Wing #1 and #2, respectively. Wing #2 is the better design for the flapping wing in 
terms of a twisting angle. Noted that our analysis is based on linear elasticity and 
thus may not accurately predict the actuation displacement. However, the present 
approach provides a simple but effective design tool to determine the shape of an 
IPMC actuator for a specific purpose.

7.1 Introduction 
7.1.1 Ionic Polymer-Metal Composite (IPMC) 
A bimorph-type soft polymer gel actuator, which we call an artificial muscle, is an 
ionic polymer-metal composite (IPMC) consisting of a perfluorosulfonic acid 
membrane with chemically plated gold or platinum as electrodes on both sides [18, 
1]. It has some excellent characteristics for robotic applications compared with 
other soft polymer actuators [2] as follows. 
Driven with low voltage (<3 V). 
Low power consumption. 
Fast response (>10 Hz in water). 
Mechanically and chemically durable and stable. 
Soft and compliant. 
Works in water (or in wet conditions). 
Moreover, it has an advantage for miniaturization with its simple actuator 
structure. With these characteristics, we expect to apply it to micromanipulations in 
the bioengineering or medical fields. Our goal is to realize bioinspired soft robots, 
for example, a snake-like swimming robot [15, 16, 17] or a multi-degree-of-
freedom (DOF) microrobot manipulator [13, 14].  
The snake-like motion of a swimming robot sweeps a smaller area than a 
simple bending motion. It is easy to miniaturize the actuator because of its simple 
structure. In the future, we may be able to make robots that can swim in thin tubes 
or in blood vessels, or various kinds of micromanipulators in the biomedical field. 

166 Y. Nakabo, T. Mukai, and K. Asaka 
7.1.2 Multi-DOF Motion of IPMC 
To realize a snake-like or a multi-DOF bending motion, we laser cut special 
electrode patterns on the surface of the actuator to control each segment 
individually.We have developed a variety of motions from this patterned actuator, 
including a snake-like motion. A kinematic modeling of the manipulator simply 
describes various multi-DOF motions of the artificial muscle. This model is 
applied to visual feedback control of the manipulator system using a Jacobian 
control method. For the feedback control, we have developed a visual sensing 
system using a 1 ms high-speed vision system which has a fast enough response to 
capture the fast actuator motion. 
We have also measured the propulsion speed generated by the snake-like 
motion. By changing voltages and phases to each segment, we can control the 
direction of the propulsion. Finally, we have made the robot swim freely forward 
and backward by finding the optimal voltage, phase, and frequency. In this report, 
we show some results from simulations of the proposed manipulator control 
method and experimental results from visual sensing of the bending motion and 
snake-like swimming of the actuator. 
7.2 Multi-DOF Microrobot Manipulator 
7.2.1 Concept of Multi-DOF Microrobot Manipulator 
Micromanipulations in bioengineering or in the medical field can be one of the 
applications of the artificial muscle. Our goal is to realize a multi-DOF microrobot 
manipulator that is automatically controlled by visual feedback, as shown in Figure 
7.1. 
In previous research studies on manipulators using an IPMC, Tadokoro et al.
have fabricated a multi-DOF micromanipulator using a “3D-EFD” element [19] 
that consists of two arch-shaped IPMC components placed crosswise and works 
with a mechanism similar to that of parallel-link manipulators. Guo et al. have 
developed a multi-DOF microcatheter with active guide wires [6]. Using this 
catheter at a diverging point of a vessel, the direction of the catheter can be 
selected by the bending motion of an IPMC. However, up to this point, the 
kinematic modeling of multi-DOF bending motions or automatic visual feedback 
control have not yet been attempted. Automatic control will be required for  
applications of micromanipulators.  
On the other hand, Mallavarapu et al. have implemented feedback control for 
dynamic bending motions in IPMC membranes [10]. They measured the bending 
motions of IPMC using a laser vibrometer to identify the dynamic models of 
bending responses to electrical stimuli and controlled them by sensor feedback. 
However, a laser vibrometer can only measure a distance from the sensor to a 
certain point of an IPMC; it cannot measure various shape changes in multi-DOF 
motion. For this, we need a better vision sensor.  
In this research, we propose to use visual information for automatic feedback 
control of the IPMC. Our 1 ms vision system [12] enables high-speed and contact-

Biomimetic Soft Robots Using IPMC 167 
free measurement of fast shape changes in an IPMC. Also, we propose a new type 
of multi-DOF manipulator that is compactly designed using a patterned artificial 
muscle. The patterning of electrodes on an IPMC enables the multi-DOF bending 
motions of a manipulator with a simple structure. 
Figure 7.1. Application of multi-DOF micromanipulator with artificial muscle and visual 
feedback control 
In the next section, we will describe details of our manipulator and how the 
patterning is carried out on the electrodes. The kinematic modeling for visual 
control is described in Section 7.4. The visual sensing system and proposal of 
feedback control are shown in Section 7.5. In Section 7.6, the experimental results 
of visual sensing are presented. 
7.3 Patterned Artificial Muscle 
7.3.1 Patterning with a Laser Beam 
One way to realize this multi-DOF motion is to connect some of them using joints. 
The process of connecting them together is, however, complex, and it is difficult to 
make the joints flexible. So we propose another method to realize multiple degrees 
of freedom. In this method, we make special electrode patterns separated 
electrically by laser-cutting the gold-plated surface of the IPMC to control each 
segment individually. This method makes the IPMC bend as required without 
losing flexibility, and it is suitable for miniaturization because the process is 
simple. 
The IPMC used in this study is a Nafion 117 membrane (by DuPont) five times 
chemically plated with gold. The thickness of the IPMC is 200 ȝm. After the 
plating, we cut a pattern on both sides of the membrane using a laser beam. By 
laser patterning, the thin gold layer is removed, and insulation between segments of 
the electrodes is achieved. By optimizing the conditions of the bursts of the laser

beam, sufficient insulation was achieved at the minimum groove size of 50 ȝm
wide and approximately 20 ȝm deep. 
Photomicrographs of the laser-cut pattern are shown in Figure 7.2. The left 
photograph shows a cross section of the membrane with a groove and a gold layer. 
The right one shows a closeup of the segmented electrodes seen from above the 
membrane. In both photographs, plated gold remained in the bright areas and was 
removed in dark areas. The photographs have different magnifications, but the 
minimum width of insulation grooves is the same (50 ȝm). From the photographs, 
the sharp lines cut by the laser can be seen.

plated gold layer, (b) patterned lines viewed from above 
7.3.2 Patterning for a Multi-DOF Manipulator 
Using the above laser cutting method, we have formed the electrode pattern shown 
in Figure 7.3. The pattern on the opposite side of the membrane has small 
differences only at the interconnections of electrodes. 
Figure 7.3. Pattern of electrodes on IPMC 
The pattern on the membrane consists of three areas, a connector area, an arm area, 
and a hand area. The connector area is for providing electricity and mounting the 
manipulator to a stable base through an electric connector. The arm area is 
composed of three wide insulated segments for multi-DOF arm bending and many 
thin lines for electrical interconnections. Finally, the hand area is composed of 
three segments that are mechanically split so that it can grab a target object, as

Note that three beads are attached to the joints of the arm segments, which are used 
for visual sensing, as explained later.

7.4 Kinematic Modeling 
7.4.1 Modeling of One-Link Kinematics 
Next we propose the kinematic model of an IPMC. Our approach is similar to the 
modeling of conventional serial-link multi-DOF robot manipulators, but has a 
marked difference in that instead of joint rotation, the link itself bends on an IPMC. 
We treat each segment of an electrode as a link of a manipulator that can be bent 
independently. Figure 7.6 shows the kinematic model of a one-link bending motion. 
We assume that a link bends with a constant curvature. Although this assumption is 
not true for very large bending angles in real IPMC membranes, it is the first step 
in the approximation in kinematic modeling, and for small values of curvature, this 
is a good approximation.  

170 Y. Nakabo, T. Mukai, and K. Asaka 
Either from the kinematic model or from real IPMC bending motion, it is 
important to note that the position and direction of an end point of the link is 
restricted to one constant trajectory, that is, one link can make only one DOF 
motion. 
7.4.2 Modeling of Multi-Link Kinematics 
To realize the multi-DOF motion of a manipulator, we can connect several links in 
series in the same way as in conventional serial-link manipulators. In this study, as 
a first step in our research, we restrict the motion of the manipulator to a two-
dimensional space, in which two DOF for position and one DOF for the tangential 
direction of the end point are controlled. We can control all three DOF 
independently by controlling the three links of an IPMC. 
We now define coordinate systems

a control system simulation is shown in Figure 7.8. Results obtained by the inverse

All results show that each segment of an IPMC membrane is properly bent to 
realize the given trajectories of positions and orientations of the end points. By the 
inverse Jacobian method, trajectories in Cartesian coordinates are straightforward 
and exponentially converged to the objective, where they are not by the transposed 
Jacobian. However, an inverse Jacobian is not stable near a singular position, in 
this case, at the upright position, whereas a transposed Jacobian is defined and 
stable at any point. From these results, it is confirmed that we can control all three 
DOF of a 2-D manipulator by the proposed methods.

Because the artificial muscle is a soft actuator and the membrane itself bends, 
limited types of sensor can be used. We propose the use of a vision sensor that can 
measure the overall shape changes of multi-DOF motions by contact-free sensing. 
However, conventional CCD cameras do not have sufficient sampling speed due to 
their limited video transfer rate. Thus, we used a 1 ms high-speed CPV system [12], 
which can capture an image and execute a processing algorithm in a cycle time of 
1 ms.

The proposed feedback control system is shown in Figure 7.11. It includes a visual

and a multi-DOF patterned artificial muscle (IPMC). Figure 7.12 shows the camera 
head of our visual sensing system and an IPMC manipulator. The manipulator is 
hung in water above the electric connector.

7.6 Experimental Results of Multi-DOF Manipulator 
In this study, we have realized all parts of the control system shown in Figure 7.11 
except the theta control stage which is enclosed by the dotted line in the figure. 
First, we tested the multi-DOF bending motion of the IPMC. A problem 
encountered was the voltage drop through interconnection lines on the IPMC. We 
found that more than 3V is needed at the connector area to provide sufficient 
voltage at each link segment (up to 2V). With such a high voltage, the electrolysis 
of water occurs and this heat causes breakdown of the thin interconnections. In 
subsequent experiments, we wired electrodes directly to each arm segment.  
Next, we conducted experiments using the visual sensing system. We applied 
sine waves with maximum voltages of 2V and cycle times of 1s to the arm 
segments. First, their phases are synchronized so that a swing motion of the arm 
was made. An image obtained using the high-speed vision system and a result of 
recognition of the reference beads are shown in Figure 7.13. The center points of 
three reference beads are identified accurately, as shown by three crosses. 
The curvatures estimated from the images by online calculation using Eq. (7.7) 
are shown in Figure 7.14. The reconstructed bending motion of the IPMC using the 
curvature data and the proposed kinematic model is shown in Figure 7.15. 
In the next experiment, we applied the same sine waves with a cycle time of 
1.5s; their phases are shifted 60° from each successive segment. 
A snakelike motion has been realized by a phase-shifted sinusoidal input. 
Online estimated curvatures of a bending motion caused by the shifted sine waves 
with a cycle time of 1.5s are shown in Figure 7.16. The bending motions 
reconstructed from the curvature data and kinematic model are shown in Figure 
7.17. The sequential photographs of a real bending motion caused by the shifted 
sine waves with a cycle time of 3s are shown in Figure 7.18.  
From the experimental results of both estimation and reconstruction, we can see 
that the estimated parameters match the real motions of the segmented IPMC. Our 
vision system and algorithms work properly for sensing a multi-DOF IPMC 
manipulator.

7.7 Snake-Like Swimming Robot 
7.7.1 Concept of a Snake-Like Swimming Robot Using IPMC 
The underwater microrobot is also a novel and potential application of the IPMC. 
There are several studies on underwater propulsion robots using the IPMC. For 
example, Mojarrad and Shahinpoor developed a propulsion robot using the IPMC 
as a fin to generate a forward impelling force [11]. Guo et al. developed a fish-like 
microrobot that uses two actuators for right and left turning [5]. However, in these 
studies, a strip-shaped IPMC is used, which generates only a simple bending 
motion, thus a backward movement could not be achieved, although forward 
propulsion and a directional change have been realized. Not only that, such a 
simple bending motion has a lower efficiency than a snake-like wavy motion in 
propulsion, which has been found by the biological analysis of the swimming 
mechanism of fish or other living creatures. To realize more complex motions, 
such as multi-DOF motions, a patterned IPMC, each segment of which could be 
bent individually, is required.  
Now, we are aiming at realizing a swimming robot with a patterned IPMC that 
bends like a snake. A snake-like motion sweeps a smaller area than a simple 
bending motion. Thus, it is suitable for future swimming robots in thin tubes, such 
as blood vessels, as shown in Figure 7.19. We input voltages as phase-shifted 
sinusoidal waves to each segment of the patterned IPMC, so that a progressive 
wave is generated as its bending motion. The system can control its impelling force 
and swimming directions left, right, forward, and backward. We can change 
amplitudes, frequencies, and phases of input waves to control the speed and

and its propulsion by experiments.

7.7.2 Natural Creatures Swimming in Water 
There are many creatures swimming in water, among which eels, morays, and sea 
serpents can control their swimming directions forward and backward. Their 
bodies, called anguilliform, are slender or long and thin like a ribbon. The heights 
of their bodies are almost constant from head to tail. When they move forward, 
they generate a forward impelling force by sending progressive waves toward the 
rear along their bodies [20, 3]. Similarly, to move backward, they send progressive 
waves toward the front along their bodies. As an example of swimming by

progressive waves, the swimming of the sperm of starfish is shown in Figure 7.20 
[7]. 
The snake-like swimming of the anguilliform is most efficient in a high-
Reynolds-number environment such as that on a microscale. It is also efficient for 
slender body fishes in a normal-scale underwater environment, including carps and 
gibels. A wavy motion is better at reducing an angular recoil from water than a 
simple bending motion [8]. 
7.8 Patterning of IPMC for a Swimming Robot 
7.8.1 Comparing Single- and Multi-DOF Motions 
Although many natural creatures use a wavy or snake-like motion, on the other 
hand, a single artificial muscle in the form of an IPMC cannot generate various 
motions on its own. The static form of an IPMC depends uniquely on an input 
voltage, indicating that it has only a single DOF. Figures 7.21 (a) and (b) show 
simulations of a simple swing motion of an IPMC and a multi-DOF motion of the 
IPMC controlling its three segments independently. These simulations are based on 
the kinematic model in which a constant curvature for each segment of the IPMC is 
assumed [14]. A sinusoidal input is given to the IPMC in (a) and 60° phase-shifted 
sinusoidal waves are given to each segment in (b). A wavy motion is realized in (b).

We verified the electric insulation between segments.

The IPMC used in this study was a Nafion 117 membrane (by DuPont) five times 
chemically plated with gold. The thickness of this IPMC was 200 ȝm. This IPMC 
was electrically isolated to seven segments. To input voltages, we used seven 
connectors and electric wires touching each segment directly. They were small and 
sufficiently thin not to disturb the movement of this IPMC. We also used floats to 
prevent this IPMC from sinking (Figure 7.23).

A block diagram of the control system of the swimming robot is shown in Figure

segments of the IPMC. Control signals for latter experiments are composed of

7.10 Experiments of Snake-Like Swimming Robot 
7.10.1 Forward and Backward Propulsions 
We first investigated the forward and backward propulsions by the snake-like 
bending motion of the patterned IPMC. An experimental system for measuring 
speed is shown in Figure 7.26. A long string and a long balancing rod cancel the 
obstruction of electric wires and allow free movement of the floats in forward and 
backward directions. 
Figure 7.26. Experimental setup for measuring propelling speed 
We searched for an optimal condition for propulsion by changing the frequency f
and phase shift ș. In our experiments, an amplitude of input waves is fixed at 
V
2
 
A
. Although a high voltage generates a large bending motion and a large 
impelling force, a voltage of more than 2V induces the electrolysis of water and 
this heat harms the IPMC. 
Figure 7.27 shows the change in propelling speed with input frequency f, where 
error bars show standard deviations of the trials. Sine waves with the amplitude 
V

A
 and phase delay ș = 60° are input to each segment of the patterned IPMC 
from frequencies f = 1 to 10Hz. Speeds were calculated by measuring the forward 
or backward distance traveled in 10s. We obtained the maximum speed at the 
frequency f of 2Hz.

with which our IPMC produced the maximum speed in the first experiment. 
Figure 7.28 shows the results of this experiment, where error bars show 
standard deviations of the trials. We successfully controlled the propelling 
direction of the IPMC forward or backward by changing the direction and speed of 
propagation of waves along the body by advancing and delaying the phases of the 
sine waves. We obtained the maximum speed at the phase shift ș of ±60°. Figure 
7.29 shows the input voltage and current response of the IPMC. Figure 7.30 shows 
the bending motions of forward and backward propulsions.

7.10.2 Right Turn and Left Turn 
We next attempted the right turn and left turn of the patterned IPMC. In generating 
right and left directed biased forces for turning the robot, simply biased sine waves 
are not effective because nonlinear dynamics of bending responses of an IPMC 
cancels averagely biased input voltages in a few seconds. Instead of using the 
biased sine waves, we propose the use of a sawtooth-like waveform, whose rising 
and falling times of input voltage are not uniform, as shown in Figure 31. In this 
case, the frequencies during the rising and falling of the input waves are different. 
The first experiment suggests that the change in frequency induces the change in 
impelling force; thus, the direction of propulsion may be biased to the right or left 
by the proposed sawtooth-like waveform. 
An experimental setup for measuring turning speed is shown in Figure 7.32. A 
long string allows free rotation of the robot in the right and left directions. 
To evaluate the proposed sawtooth-like waveform, we conducted an 
experiment to investigate the turning speed of the IPMC by changing the ratio of 
the rising time to the falling time of the input waves (T1/T2) from 0.026 to 38.8 
using a piecewise sinusoidal waveform, as shown in Figure 31. The amplitude, 
phase delay, and total frequency of the oscillating waves are fixed at A = 2V, ș = 
60° and f = 2Hz with which the IPMC produced the maximum speed in the 
previous two experiments. The turning speeds are calculated by measuring the 
angle of turning right or left in 10s.

The results are shown in Figure 7.35, where error bars show standard deviations of 
the trials. From these results, we found that the robot can be turned right and left by 
changing the ratio of the rising time to the falling time of the proposed piecewise 
sinusoidal waveform. Figures 7.33 and 7.34 show the input voltages and current 
responses of the IPMC that induce the maximum left-turn and right-turn speeds of 
the robot. Figure 7.36 shows the bending motion of the IPMC for the right turn and

first consider the forward and backward propulsions and then the right turn and left 
turn based on a propulsion model for microorganisms [4] that swim with a snake-
like motion.

7.12 Applying Propulsion Model 
In the previous section, we presented the propulsion model of the swimming 
motion in which the position 
t
x
z
,
 of each point of the IPMC should be 
determined to calculate the propelling and turning forces of the robot. In this study, 
we extracted 
t
x
z
,
 from the real bending motion of the experiments and applied it 
to the propulsion model to calculate the propelling force. 
Moreover, the drag resistance coefficient 
L
C  and normal resistance coefficient 
N
C  should be given in the model. However, we did not estimate them by ourselves 
and used only the values described in a previous study [9], in which the 
coefficients of drag resistance of a cylinder 
L
C  = 0.82 and of normal resistance of 
a circular plate 
N
C  = 1.17 were obtained. These values may not be so different 
from the true values, although precise measurements for real IPMC devices should 
be an important future work.  
7.12.1 Extracting Bending Motion 
To extract the position 
t
x
z
,
 of each point of the IPMC, we captured a sequence 
of images of the bending motion in our experiments and extracted the bending 
curve, as shown in Figure 7.39. We sampled 15 points with equal spaces on the 
extracted curved line, as shown in Figure 7.39(d). 
These sets of points extracted from the image sequence are the sampling points 
of

t
x
z
,
 and were used to calculate the differential 
dx
dz
 and 
dt
dz
 in the 
propulsion model. Figure 7.40 shows an example of the extracted 
t
x
z
,
 and 
calculated differential 
dx

 and 
dt
dz
 from the corresponding 
t

,
.

7.12.2 Applying Model on Forward and Backward Propulsions 
We first calculated the propelling force 
x
F  by (7.13) using 
t
x
z
,
 extracted from 
the experiments of forward and backward propulsions. This 
x
F  varies with a 
change in average propelling speed 
x
V , as shown in Figure 7.41. 
Generally, when a robot is propelling at a constant speed, the propelling force 
Fx is zero. In this case, if Fx = 0 in the result of the analysis shown in Figure 41, the 
forward and backward constant speeds are Vx = í5.3×10í4m/s and Vx = 9.8 × 
10í4m/s, respectively. On the other hand, the true forward and backward speeds 
measured in the previous experiment are Vx = í4.2 × 10í3m/s and Vx = 3.5 × 
10í3m/s, respectively. These differences between the speeds of the real IPMC and 
the speeds analyzed from the model can be induced by the force that is not 
proportional to the speed and not considered in this model.

7.12.3 Applying Model to Right Turn and Left Turn 
We next calculated the moment of force M by (7.18) using 
t

z
,
 extracted from 
the experiments of the right turn and left turn of the IPMC. This M varies with a 
change in average propelling speed 
x
V , as shown in Figure 7.42. 
Figure 7.42. Moment of force vs. propelling speed 
By fixing Vx as zero, the moments of force M = 1.2 × 10í4 Nm for the left turn and 
M = 5.6 × 10í5 Nm for the right turn are obtained from Figure 7.42. These values 
indicate the moments of force for the left turn on both. Although this is not true, 
comparing the relative differences between the two values obtained, the moment of 
force for the left turn is larger than that for the right turn, which is considered a 
reasonable result. These biased results can be induced by an error in the estimation 
of the moment center of the IPMC. In the analysis, we calculated only the average 
position of the 15 sampled points as the moment center, which may not be 
accurate. Moreover, force that is not proportional to speed can be the other reason 
for this error. 
7.13 Conclusions 
In this study, we described our new type of multi-DOF manipulator using a 
patterned artificial muscle (IPMC), and proposed the kinematic modeling of multi-
link motions for the control of the manipulator using an inverse Jacobian or a 
transposed Jacobian with visual sensing. Simulations and experiments verify our 
approach. Our future work should address the problem of the low conductivity of 
segment interconnections. We can increase the width of the interconnections

and/or increase the amount of gold plating, so that their conductive layers become 
thicker. Another issue is the dynamic aspect of the bending motions of the IPMC 
membrane. Although bending velocity generally follows a given voltage signal, 
nonlinear characteristics, such as swing back motion, also contribute to a dynamic 
response. Extensive work has been carried out to identify and model the dynamics. 
In the future, we will examine these models and realize dynamic control of an 
IPMC manipulator. 
We have also developed a biomimetic snake-like swimming robot using an 
IPMC. We demonstrated that the swimming speed and direction can be controlled 
using a patterned IPMC. The IPMC has segments, each of which can be controlled 
individually. By inputting sine waves with different phases, we can make 
progressive waves move along the body of the IPMC, and these waves induce an 
impelling force. We also proposed an analytical model for the robot propulsion 
considering the drag and resistance forces induced by the bending motion of the 
IPMC. We applied the results of the experiments to the proposed model and 
estimated the propelling forces of the robot propulsion. The following are our 
future plans: (1) make an IPMC that can generate a stronger impelling force and 
swim faster and (2) mount a battery and a controlling circuit on the IPMC, instead 
of connecting them to a host PC.

8.1 Introduction 
Machines and robots have big impacts on our life and industry to realize high-
speed, high-power, and high-precision motion; however, recently other factors are 
demanded, e.g., miniaturization or flexibility. For robots working in ordinary 
human life, it is desired to use safe and soft actuators, which are sometimes called 
artificial muscle. A high polymer gel actuator is one of the candidates for artificial 
muscle actuators due to their softness and miniaturizability.  
For several decades, electroactive polymers (EAP) 0, which respond to electric 
stimuli with shape change, received little attention because of their actuating 
limitations. During the last ten years, development of EAP materials with large 
displacement and quick response changed the potential capability, and EAP 
received much attention from engineers and researchers in many disciplines, e.g.,
robotics, medical service, and the toy industry. 
The ionic polymer-metal composite (IPMC) is one of the most promising EAP 
actuators for applications. IPMC is produced by chemically plating gold or 
platinum on a perfluorosulfonic acid membrane which is known as an ion-
exchange membrane. When an input voltage is applied to the metal layers of both 
surfaces, they bend at high speed. The phenomenon of this motion was discovered 
by Oguro et al. in 1992 0. The characteristics of an IPMC are as follows: 
Driving voltage is low (1~2 V). 
Speed of response is fast (> 100 Hz). 

200
M. Yamakitaet al. 
It is durable and stable chemically. (It is possible to bend more than 106
times.) 
It is a flexible material. 
It moves in water and in wet conditions. 
Miniaturization and weight saving is possible. 
It is silent. 
It can be used as a sensor. 
By exploiting the characteristics, IPMC actuators have been applied to robotic 
applications such as an active catheter [3,4], a fish-type underwater robot [4~10], a 
wiper for a nanorover 0, a micropump 0, a micromanipulator 0, and a distributed 
actuation device 0. 
It, however, also has disadvantages that the actuation force is still small and 
that the input voltage is restricted to the range where electrolysis of the ionic 
polymer does not occur. To improve performance, development of the ionic 
polymer membrane and plating method are required. 
IPMC actuators also have another noteworthy property; the characteristics of 
bending motion depend highly on counterions. In application to mechanical 
systems such as robots, the possibilities exist to change the properties of the 
dynamics adequately according to the environment or purpose. We have called this 
property the “doping effect”, and verified the effect on robotic applications. 
The goal of our study is applying an artificial muscle actuator to robotic 
applications especially to a bipedal walking robot, and we developed a linear 
actuator using IPMC. The structure of our proposed actuator is very simple, and 
the actuator transforms bending motion into linear motion. We assume that 
elementary units are connected in parallel and series to realize the desired 
displacement and force. In this paper, we describe the structure of the actuator and 
identify an empirical model of the actuator. Numerical simulations of bipedal 
walking are demonstrated, and the doping effect is investigated by the walking 
simulation and an experiment using a snakelike robot. Finally, control of doping 
speed by exercise is also considered.  
8.2 Proposed IPMC Linear Actuator 
In this section, the structure and basic properties of the proposed IPMC linear 
actuator will be explained 0. 
8.2.1 Structure of IPMC Linear Actuator 
The proposed linear actuator is composed of many basic units connected in parallel 
and series so that enough force and displacement can be obtained. The structure of 
the elementary unit is shown in Figure 8.1. This elementary unit consists of four 
IPMC films. One side of the unit is formed from a pair of films that are connected 
by a flexible material or the same thin film. When an input voltage is applied to 
electrodes on the surface with the anode outside, each membrane bends outside, 
then the actuator is constricted. The actuation force and displacement of each unit

201 
are small; however, the elementary units can be connected in parallel and series as 
in Figure 8.2, so the actuator can realize the desired force and displacement. By 
shifting the series of elementary units by a half pitch to avoid interference as in 
Figure 8.2, the total actuator is made compact, and high power/volume and 
miniaturization are realized. 
Figure 8.1. Structure of IPMC actuator 
Figure 8.2. Basic concept of IPMC linear actuator 
8.2.2 Properties of the Elementary Unit 
To check the characteristics of the actuator, we carried out fundamental 
experiments. Figure 8.3 shows the experimental setup. In this experiment, one edge 
of the actuator is fixed on a board floating on water to reduce the effects of the 
weight of electrodes and ties. Displacement of the linear actuator was measured by 
a laser displacement meter. 
8.2.2.1 Response in Step Voltage 
Figure 8.4 shows the response in a step voltage without loads, where step input 
voltages of 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 V were applied at 0 s. The IPMC film which we used 
in this experiment is Nafion®117 (DuPont) plated with gold. A counterion doped in 
the film is Na+. Though the response of the actuator varies depending on its 
condition, it was confirmed that the unit whose total length is 40 mm is constricted 
by 10 mm with a step input voltage of 2.5 V in average. As the applied voltage is 
increased, the peak value of the displacement is also increased.  
In this experiment, it is observed that when a step voltage is applied, the IPMC 
membrane bends toward the anode side quickly and bends back gradually. The 
characteristic varies according to the counterion, as mentioned below. It was also 

202
M. Yamakitaet al. 
observed that the current increased sharply at the moment when the input voltage 
was applied, and then it decreased exponentially.

8.2.2.2 Response with Loads 
Figure 8.5 shows the response in step voltage with loads; a step input voltage of 
2.5 V was applied in loading. As the load is increased, displacement becomes small 
but the current almost does not change. 
Note that to avoid damage of IPMC actuators by electrolysis, the control input 
voltage is limited to about 3.0 V. So it is not so effective to change the dynamic 
properties by changing the control voltage. In the following, changing the dynamic 
properties chemically is considered by changing the doped ions in the film.

8.2.2.3 Responses with Different Doped Counterions 
It is known that IPMC changes bending characteristics with respect to doped 
counterions 0. Figure 8.6 shows the responses of actuators for the same input 
voltage of 2.5 V, which are doped with sodium (Na+), cesium (Cs+), and 
tetraethylammonium (TEA+) as the counterion, respectively. From the figure, it is 
observed that the raising time of the unit with Na+ is shorter than that with Cs+ and 
the rising time of the unit with TEA+ is largest. On the other hand, the tendency of 
the response to decay is large for the unit with Na+ or Cs+, but it is very small for 
the unit with TEA+. The doping of the counterion is easily done by just putting the 
unit in a solution containing the target counterion, and higher condensed 
counterions are doped into IPMC films. Also, the change of the doped ion is 
reversible. The property suggests that the characteristics of the actuator can be 
changed for specific purposes. In Section 8.4.3, we will show the effect of doping 

204
M. Yamakitaet al. 
in the walking pattern and efficiency of a small bipedal robot, and in Section 8.5 
we will show experimental results of doping on a snakelike robot. In 0, it was 
discussed how to change equivalent characteristics of the actuator mechanically.

8.3 Model Identification
To know the capability of the linear actuator for a robotic system, we identify the 
linear actuator as a mathematical model. IPMC actuators have been modeled in 
various ways as a black or gray box model 0, and a detailed model based the 
physical and chemical phenomena [19~21]; however, it is difficult to represent 
these models by systems of ordinary differential equations because of their 
complexity. In this paper, in consideration of model-based control, we use a gray 
box model which has two inputs, i.e., control voltage and external force. We 
identify the actuator as a linear time-invariant model with static nonlinearity from 
input-output data using a subspace identification algorithm [15,22]. 
8.3.1 Identification Method 
First, the model of the actuator is assumed to be represented by the system in  
Figure 8.7. This model has two inputs and one output, and it consists of two 

Robotic Application of IPMC Actuators with Redoping Capability 
205 
subsystems, P1(s) and P2(s), which are connected in series. P1(s) is a system with 
one input v, input voltage, and one output f1 which is a force generated by electric 
stimuli. P2(s) is a system with one input force f2 which is exerted on the actuator, 
and one output y, displacement of actuator. f2 is assumed to be the difference 
between f1 and fl. P(s) is defined as P2(s) P1(s).
For the moment, it is assumed that the actuator is driven in a small operating 
range, and the dynamics is identified as an LTI model as follows: 
Identification of P(s): Measure a response from input voltage v to displacement 
y; then compute the system P(s)=P2(s)P1(s) from input-output data using a 
subspace identification algorithm.  
Identification of P2(s): Measure a response from load fl to displacement y; then 
compute the system P2(s) from input-output data using a subspace 
identification algorithm. 
Computation of P1(s):  Compute the system P1(s) as P2(s)-1P(s).
 In procedures 1 and 2, we performed the system identification using the 
N4SID function in MATLAB, and from the discrete time model obtained, the 
corresponding continuous model was determined.

If the relative degree of P2(s) is 2, then it is easy to simulate an impulsive effect of 
collision. In procedure 2, the relative degree of P2(s) was estimated as 1, but the 
coefficient of the highest order term in the numerator of P2(s) was much smaller 
than the other. Thus we eliminated it, and obtained the transfer function whose 
relative degree is 2. In procedure 3, small coefficients of P1(s) ware also 
eliminated.

Figure 8.8 shows a comparison between the experimental result and the 
simulation result using the identification model. It is shown that a quick transient 
of simulation result is nearly equal to the experimental one. But in part of the slow 
decay, there is a little error between them. As the results of identification with a  
linear approximate model, the characteristics of the actuator are captured. 
 When the control voltage and external load are given simultaneously, as in 
Figure 8.9, we can observe the large error between them.  The reason for the error 
can be inferred as nonlinear effects due to the large deformation of the structure of 
the unit. So we should consider other models to deal with such a large deformation 
and the nonlinearity. 
Figure 8.8. Identification result 1 
8.3.3 Introduction of Nonlinear Effect 
To reduce the error due to nonlinearity, a nonlinear compensation term is 
introduced. First, the system is identified as an LTI model and static nonlinearity 
which is represented as a polynomial or weighted sum of Gaussian functions is 
introduced, i.e., we use a Hammerstein model for the P2 part. Weights for the basis 
functions are determined to minimize the mean square error. Figure 8.9(b) shows 
the result with the nonlinear terms. To the inputs of P2(s), f1 and fl, nonlinear 
elements which are represented as a weighted sum of Gaussian functions and 
polynomials are introduced. Compared to the result of Figure 8.9 (a), it can be seen 
that the mean square error is reduced by 40% and the model is valid for a large 
operating range.

terms 
8.3.4 Experiment of Feedback Control  
To check the validity of the identified model, a feedback control experiment using 
an LQ servocontroller was conducted.  
A position controller was designed based on the Hammerstein model and an 
LQ servocontroller was designed for a compensated Hammerstein model. Because 
the Hammerstein model contains static nonlinearity in front of the LTI part, the 
nonlinearity is compensated by the inverse system of the nonlinear function, and a 
linear controller was designed for the LTI part. Figure 8.10 shows a whole system 
composed of the Hammerstein model and the designed controller. The controller is 
designed as follows: 
(1) Design a linear controller K for LTI part P,
(2) Put N -1K in front of the Hammerstein model P N.
Please notice that in general the nonlinear block N might not be invertible. 
There, however, exists N -1 for our model during the considered operating range. 
Figure 8.11 shows the control results. The state of the system required for an 
LQ servecontroller was estimated by a linear observer. The actuator used for the 
experiment was composed of IPMC films doped with Na+. From the figure, it is 

208
M. Yamakitaet al. 
observed that the desired position control is achieved, though some oscillation is 
observed. In figure (b), the control voltage of the experiment and simulation are 
shown and we can see some deviation. Especially, the actual control voltage 
gradually increased due to integral operation. The reason inferred for the deviation 
is that such a slow mode was not identified by our Hammerstein model. We 
consider, however, that our model is valid for a periodic motion with a short period 
considered below.

8.4 Application to Walking Robot
This section addresses an application of the linear actuator to a small-sized bipedal 
walking robot shown in Figure 8.12, and realization of walking with the proposed 
actuator is investigated by numerical simulations. The parameters of the robot are 
set as ml =5 g, mh =10 g, a=50 mm, b=50 mm, l=100 mm, rh =4 mm, g=9.81 m/s2,
and rf =0 mm. This small bipedal robot can exhibit passive dynamic walking 0 
without any actuator on a gentle slope. In the following simulation, we assume that 
actuators are attached between legs, as in the right side of Figure 8.12. In the 
simulations, we assume that contact between a leg and ground is pin contact and 
collision of the swing leg with the ground is perfectly inelastic. 
8.4.1 Simulation Results 
Figure 8.13 shows the simulation results of walking on level ground. The number 
of units connected in parallel and series is set as 4 and 3, respectively. In this 
simulation, we applied a square pulse as input voltage whose cycle was 0.48 s and 
whose amplitude was 2.5 V. From the results, it can be seen that a one-period 
walking gait is generated and the walking cycle synchronizes with the cycle of the 
input signal.

8.4.2 Walking Control with Synchronization 
8.4.2.1 Open-Loop Control 
In the previous section, we applied time-variant signals as open-loop inputs, i.e.,
constant periodic square pulses, and it was shown that the bipedal walking robot 
with actuators can walk on level ground with the period synchronized with the 
period of the input signal. In this section, we consider time-invariant input signals, 
that is, switch the input signals in response to the state of the robot, e.g., the angle 
of a stance leg. 
Figure 8.14 shows the simulation results of open-loop control. In this 
simulation, the parameters of the robot are set as ml= 9.6 g, mh =32.1 g, a=42.9
mm, b=56.9 mm, l=99.8 mm, rh =11.3 mm, g=9.81 m/s2, and rf =0 mm due to an 
experimental system, and the input signals are switched by the angle of a stance 
leg. From the results, it is observed that a one-period walking gait is generated. In 
comparison with time-variant input, there is not much difference in the 
convergence to steady state or the basin of attraction; however, we are able to 
simplify the experimental setup and to adjust easily the timing of inputs and the 
start of walking. Moreover, the systems with the open-loop inputs are autonomous, 
then we can apply a simple feedback control method, as described below.

8.4.2.2 Feedback Control 
Robots with the actuator can walk on level ground with open-loop control; 
however, the walking gait is not robust, and the basin of attraction of the limit 
cycle is limited; then it is difficult to continue walking under the disturbance. To 
realize robust walking and to enhance the basin of attraction, we apply a feedback 
control based on the linear approximate model of trajectories on a limit cycle 0.

of the basin of attraction and the robustness of the control is left for future work.

8.4.3 Doping Effect on Walking 
As shown in the previous section, the bending characteristics of IPMC film are 
highly affected by the doped counterion. There exist possibilities to change the 
properties of the actuator according to the environment or purpose. If we consider  
walking application, we can change the property so that the actuator is suitable for 
slow walking with low energy consumption or fast walking with high energy 
consumption, or possibly running. We investigate the possibility of adaptation with 
doping of the actuator for walking control by numerical simulations 0. Recall that 
the doped ion can be exchanged as many times as required.   
We compare walking speeds and walking efficiencies with actuators composed 
of IPMC films doped with Na+ and Cs+ for the same input voltage. The input 
voltage is rectangular, its amplitude is 2.5 V, and it is applied to the system in an 
open-loop fashion. The parameters of the robot are set as ml=5.0 g, mh=10.0 g, 
a=50.0 mm, b=50.0 mm, l=100.0 mm, rh=4.0 mm, rf = 0.0 mm, and g=9.81 m/s2.
We assume also that in the simulation the number of units connected in parallel 
and series is set as 4 and 3, respectively. 
Figure 8.17(a) shows a plot of average walking speed vs. the applied frequency 
of the input where the solid line shows the plot for the actuator with Na+ and dotted 
line for that with Cs+. From the figure, it can be seen that if the same control 
frequency input is applied to the robot, faster walking is realized by the actuator 
doped with Na+ rather than by that with Cs+. The maximum speed of the robot 
doped with Na+ is higher than that with Cs+. Note here that this kind of property 
may not exist if the parameters of the robot are not designed properly. So the 
design of the robot is important for the doping to be effective for walking. Figure 
8.17(b) shows a plot of walking speed vs. the average consumed power. Because 
the input current for the actuator is almost irrelevant to the walking pattern, the 
peak value of the injected current of the actuator doped with Na+ is large, and the 
corresponding consumed power is large. 
From the observation, it can be suggested that if the input voltage is the same, 
the actuator doped with Na+ realizes high-speed walking with high energy 
consumption, and the one doped with Cs+ can generate a slow walking pattern with 
low energy consumption when the mass is rather heavy, i.e., m=5 g. On the other 
hand, when m=1 g, the actuator with Cs+ can realize a wide range of walking 
speeds with low energy consumption. Note here that even if the average input 
power is increased in the case of Cs+, the walking speed is not increased because 
the walking pattern is not proper and the energy dissipated in a collision is 
increased.

8.5 Application to Snakelike Robot
In the last section, it was shown that the efficiency of walking with different 
walking speeds was confirmed by numerical simulation. In this section, the effect 
is checked by a snakelike robot swimming in water experimentally.  

Robotic Application of IPMC Actuators with Redoping Capability 
217 
8.5.1 Snakelike Robot 
Figure 8.18 shows an experimental machine, a three-link snakelike swimming 
robot with IPMC actuators. The frame of the robot is made of styrene foam. Thin 
fins are attached to the bottom of the body frame, and each frame is connected by 
an IPMC film. The total mass of the robot is 0.6 g and its total length is 120 mm. 
The IPMC film which we used in this experiment is Nafion®117 (by DuPont) 
plated with gold; the thickness of this film is about 200 ȝm in a wet condition, and 
it was cut into a ribbon with a width of 2 mm and length of 20 mm. 
To check the performance of the robot, we also performed experiments using 
the snakelike robot as shown in Figure 8.18. 
Figure 8.19 shows the experimental results with input signals whose cycle is 2 
s, amplitude is 2.5 V, phase shift is 90 ,q  and the kind of counterion is sodium 
(Na+). From figures (a) and (b), it can be confirmed that the robot performs an 
undulating motion and moves forward. Figure 8.20 shows sequential photographs 
of the experiment. For more details of the experimental setup and the properties of 
the motions, refer to 0.

8.5.2 Doping Effect 
To verify the doping effect, we performed experiments on IPMC actuators which 
were doped with Na+, Cs+ and TEA+ as counterions. We compare propulsive speed 
and efficiencies of the actuators doped with each ion for the same input voltage. 
The inputs voltages were square pulses whose amplitude was 2.5 V and phase shift 
was 90 ,q  and we repeated measurements at various input frequencies.  
In Figure 8.21 (a), the average propulsive speed vs. consumed power is plotted. 
The snakelike robot doped with Na+ can move faster; however, consumed power is 
large. If it need not move at high speed, we should use the actuators doped with 
other counterions that can be driven by low power. Figure 8.21(b) shows the 
average propulsion speed vs. power consumed per distance. If there is no limit to 
the capacity of a power source, it can be considered that the actuators doped with 
Na+ are effective because the robot can move for a short time; however, there is a 
region of low consumed power achieved only by the robot doped with TEA+.
From the observation, it can be summarized that if the input voltage is the 
same, the actuator doped with Na+ realizes a high-speed swimming motion with 
high energy consumption, the one doped with TEA+ can generate slow swimming 
speed with low energy consumption, and the one doped with Cs+ has 
characteristics between those of Na+ and TEA+. Note that the actuators can be

adjusted to various characteristics by selecting an appropriate counterion or by 
mixing several ions in appropriate proportions.

8.6 Control of Partial Doping Effect by Exercise
The doping effect is caused by exchanging counterions and a higher condensed 
counterion is doped into IPMC films. The doping of the counterions is easily done 
just putting the actuators in a solution containing the target counterion just as the 
robots take a bath containing a nutritional supplement. When the robots cannot

221 
take a bath, liquid containing the counterion can be delivered to the actuators 
through tubes like blood vessels. Figure 8.22(a) illustrates these doping processes. 
If the speed of changing the ion can be controlled by exercises, i.e., bending  IPMC 
films, the property of particular actuators can be changed by such motions. This 
phenomenon can be considered similar to muscles in a human body that can be 
trained by exercise for a particular purpose, as in Figure 8.22 (b).

8.6.1 Experiment 
To investigate the possibility of the effect in IPMC actuators, we conducted an 
experiment as follows. Two linear actuators doped with TEA+ were prepared, and 
one of the actuators was just immersed in the Na2SO4 solution with Na+. On the 
other hand, another actuator was actuated in the same solution so that the bending 
motion was caused frequently.  
At every interval, the characteristics of the two actuators were measured. In our 
experiment, step responses for a constant voltage input are stored.  
The length, width, and thickness of the films were 25 mm, 2 mm, and 200 ȝm, 
respectively, and they were immersed in the liquid by 15 mm. For the activated 
film, a rectangular input whose levels were


  V and whose frequency was 
0.5 s was injected. The step responses of the films were measured at 0, 10, 30, 60, 
120, and 180 minutes where the input voltage was 2.0 V.

When the step response was measured, the actuators were immersed in pure water 
for 10 minutes to avoid changes due to the mechanical effects of motion.  
Figure 8.23 shows the experimental results. In the figure, (a) shows the changes 
in the current profile for each step input, and (b) shows peak values of the current, 
with respect to the intervals. From the figure, it can be seen that the peak values of 
the current increased according to the increase of the interval, and the property was 
changed from the property of TEA+ to that of Na+. Note that the property of the 
actuator immersed with motion changed more quickly than that without motion. 
Actually, the property of the film without motion at 180 minutes was achieved by 
the film with motion at 30 minutes.  
8.7 Conclusions 
We have discussed the development of a linear actuator using IPMC materials and 
its applications to a walking robot and a snakelike robot. In this monograph, the 
doping effects on motion were focused on especially, and it was shown by 
numerical simulations of walking control and by an experiment of a swimming 
control of the snakelike robot that the properties of the actuator can be adjusted 
according to particular motions, i.e., slow speed motion with low energy 
consumption or high speed motion with high energy consumption. Also, a 
possibility that some actuators distributed in a system can be partially doped with a 
desired ion by moving the actuators mechanically was shown by a preliminary 
experiment. The authors consider that the developed IPMC linear actuator can be 
used for biomimetic control systems where the properties of the system can be 
adapted to an environment using doping effects.  
To apply the artificial muscle actuator to a general robotic system, there exist a 
lot of problems such as limitation of output force; however, we think the mutual 
evolution of improvement of actuator technology and design of control system is 
important for further applications.

9.1 Introduction 
The ionic polymer-metal composite (IPMC, which is also known as ICPF* ) [1, 2] 
is one of the electroactive polymers that have shown potential for practical 
applications. IPMC is an electroless plated electroactive polymer (EAP) material 
that bends when subjected to a voltage across its thickness (see Figure 9.1). IPMC 
has several attractive EAP characteristics that include: 
(1) 
Low drive voltage is 1.0 – 5.0 V). 
(2) 
Relatively high response (up to several tens of Hertz). 
(3) 
Soft material (E = 2.2 × 108 Pa). 
(4) 
Possible to miniaturize (< 1 mm). 
(5) 
Durability to many bending cycles (> 1 ×106 bending cycles). 
(6) 
Can be activated in water or in a wet condition. 
(7) 
Exhibits distributed actuation allowing production of mechanisms with 
multiple degrees of freedom. 
The IPMC generates a relatively small force where a cantilever-shaped actuator 
(2 × 10 × 0.18 mm) can generate about 0.6 mN, and therefore its applications need 
to be scoped accordingly. Some of the applications that were investigated for 
IPMC include an active catheter system [3, 4], a distributed actuation device [5–7], 
* Kanno and Tadokoro named the Nafion-Pt composite ICPF (Ionic Conducting Polymer gel Film) in 
1992.  In the field of robotics, most researchers use the name ICPF, and it is well recognized.   

228 M. Konyo, S. Tadokoro, and K. Asaka 
an underwater robot [8], micromanipulators [9, 10], a micropump [11], a face-type 
actuator [7], a wiper of an asteroid rover [12, 13], and a tactile haptic display for 
virtual reality [14–17]. The actual number of applications that were considered is 
still small, but the list is expected to grow in the coming years with the emergence 
of requirements that account for the limitations while taking advantage of the 
unique capabilities. 
Figure 9.1. Ionic polymer metal composite (IPMC) actuator shown for Pt/Nafion composite 
EAP 
Many investigators have studied models for IPMC, with the largest number 
addressing Nafion-Pt composite EAP [18–27]. 
A soft sensing system is also important for advanced applications of IPMC 
actuators, because conventional solid sensors may cancel the flexibility of an 
IPMC. One possible sensor would be an IPMC itself. An IPMC can also be used as 
a sensor, because an electric potential will be generated across the composite when 
the strip is bent suddenly. The authors showed that the velocity of deformation of 
an IPMC strip was in proportion to the sensor output voltage and two kinds of 
velocity-sensing systems were proposed [28]. One is a 3-DOF tactile sensor that 
has four IPMC sensor modules combined in a cross shape and can detect both the 
velocity and the direction of the motion of the center tip. Another is a patterned 
IPMC strip that has both actuator and sensor functions. This strip can sense the 
velocity of bending motion made by the actuator part. 
In this chapter, we describe several robotic applications developed using IPMC 
materials, which the authors have developed as attractive soft actuators and sensors. 
In Sections 9.2 to 9.4, several applications of IPMC actuators which have soft 
actuation mechanisms are described. We introduce several unique applications as 
follows: 
(1) Haptic interface for a virtual tactile display 
(2) Distributed actuation device 
(3) Soft micromanipulation device with three degrees of freedom 
In Section 9.5, we focus on aspects of the sensor function of IPMC materials. The 
following applications are described: 
(1) 3-DOF tactile sensor  
(2) Patterned sensor on an IPMC film

9.2. Haptic Interface for Virtual Tactile Display 
9.2.1 Background 
A novel technology to display to humans more realistic tactile sensation including 
qualitative information will realize advanced telecommunication directly 
connected to human physical skills and human mental sensibilities. A cutaneous 
display in addition to a force display helps human dexterous telemanipulation for 
use in medicine, space, and other extreme environments. For virtual reality 
applications, a tactile display is also effective to produce human emotional 
responses such as a rich texture feel, comfort of touch, and high presence of virtual 
objects.
A number of tactile displays have been proposed for evoking the cutaneous 
sense accepted by subcutaneous receptors for rough or frictional feeling on the 
surface of an object [29]. Conventional mechanical stimulation displays are 
equipped with a dumbbell-shaped vibration pin, a linear motor, and a pneumatic 
device. Consequently, it is difficult for the subject to perform contact motion freely 
in a 3-d space with this type of display due to the weight and size of its actuator . 
EAP materials have many attractive characteristics as a soft and light actuator 
for such a stimulation device. The authors have developed a tactile display using 
IPMC actuators [14–17]. In our research, the target of tactile information is quite 
different from conventional ones. Our display can produce a delicate touch 
including even qualitative information such as a haptic impression or material feel 
when we stroke the surface of cloth. 
The most characteristic feature of tactile sensation is a diversity of perceptual 
content. This variety is reflected in physical factors of target materials such as 
rigidity, elasticity, viscosity, friction, and surface shapes. It is interesting that 
tactile receptors in human skin cannot sense the physical factors directly. They can 
detect only the inner skin deformations caused by contacting to the objects. This 
suggests that the reproduction of the same physical factors of materials is not 
necessary for representing the virtual touch of materials. Virtual touch needs only 
the reproduction of internal deformations in the skin. Furthermore, a tactile illusion 
can even be provided by reproduction of nervous activities of tactile receptors, 
regardless of the inner deformations. 
Based on this standpoint, several researchers proposed tactile display methods 
that make a selective stimulation on each tactile receptor using a magnetic 
oscillator and air pressure [30] and electrocutaneous stimulation [31]. However, 
selectivity of stimuli for all kinds of receptors was not enough to reproduce various 
tactile sensations. By using IMPC actuators, the authors proposed a tactile 
synthesis method that could control three physical characteristics, which are 
roughness, softness, and friction, as tunable parameters of textures. This method 
realizes selective stimulations on each kind of tactile receptors based on its 
temporal response characteristics [14–17]. 
In addition, an active perceptual process based on contact motion is very 
important for human tactile perception. To confirm the feel against hands (haptic 
impression) people use hand movements consciously or actively to clarify the 
properties of an object. Such an active touch in connection with contact motion 

230 M. Konyo, S. Tadokoro, and K. Asaka 
excels passive sensory perception qualitatively and quantitatively. We successfully 
developed a wearable tactile display presenting mechanical stimuli on a finger in 
response to hand movements by using a small interface [16]. Almost no studies had 
realized a wearable tactile display that could make a multi degree-of-freedom 
mechanical stimulation on the skin.  
In this chapter, haptic interfaces using IPMC actuators are described.  Our 
display can realize a selective stimulation on human skin. We also describe a 
tactile synthesis method that can control three physical characteristics, which 
consists of roughness, softness, and friction, as tunable parameters of textures. 
9.2.2 Wearable Tactile Display Using ICPF Actuators 
Haptic interfaces for presenting human tactile feel were developed using IPMC 
actuators [14–17]. To express delicate tactile feel including even qualitative 
information such as tactile impression or material feel, we need to control the 
sensory fusion of elementary sensations that are generated by different sensory 
receptors.  
Conventional tactile displays could hardly control such delicate sensation 
because it was difficult to make fine distributed stimuli on a human skin under the 
limitation of their actuators such as magnetic oscillators, piezoelectric actuators, 
shapememory alloy actuators, pneumatic devices, and so on.  EAP materials have 
many attractive characteristics as a soft and light actuators for such a stimulation 
device. IPMC is suitable for the following reasons: 
(1) High spatial resolution:  The required spatial resolution for stimulating 
sensory receptors, especially Meissner’s corpuscle in the finger tip, is less 
than 2 mm. IPMC films are easy to shape, and their simple operating 
mechanism allows miniaturizing a stimulator to make a high-density 
distributed structure. Conventional actuators can hardly control such minute 
force because of their heavy identical mass and high mechanical impedance. 
IPMC has enough softness that special control methods are not required to 
use the passive material property. 
(2) Wide frequency range:  Tactile display can stimulate several tactile 
receptors selectively by changing frequency ranges because each tactile 
receptor has different time response characteristics for vibratory stimulation 
[17]. The required frequency  range is from 5 Hz to  200 Hz to stimulate all 
kinds of tactile receptors. The response speed of IPMC is fast enough to 
make a vibratory stimulation on a skin higher than 200 Hz. This means that 
IPMC can stimulate all receptors selectively. 
(3) Stimuli in multiple directions:  Each of the tactile receptors has selectivity 
for the direction of mechanical stimuli. Meissner’s corpuscle detects 
especially the shearing stress toward the skin surface. Figure 9.2 shows that 
bending motions of an IPMC, which contacts with a surface of skin in a 
tilted position, make a stress in both the normal direction and shearing 
direction. 
(4) Wearability:  In human tactual perception, an active perceptual process 
based on hand contact motion is very important. To generate the virtual 
reality of tactile feel, we should move our hand actively and freely, and 

 
Applications of Ionic Polymer-Metal Composites 231 
receive appropriate stimuli in response to the hand movements. For 
conventional mechanical stimulation devices of tactile display, it is difficult 
to attach the device to a finger, so that the subjects cannot perform contact 
motion freely in a 3-D space. An IPMC based wearable display was 
successfully developed, which was made so smaller in size and weight that 
there was no interference with hand movements [16]. 
(5) Safety: The low driving voltage (less than 5 V) is safe enough to touch with 
a human finger directly.

In an early prototype [14], tactile feel has been presented as shown in Figure 9.3a. 
In that case, subjects obtained only passive tactual perception because they could 
not perform contact motion. As shown in Figure 9.3b, the new wearable device 
[16] can be attached to the tip of a finger. 
The structure of the wearable stimulation device  is shown in Figure 9.4. The 
ciliary part is provided with Nafion-Au composite actuators, where each cilium is 3 
mm long and 2 mm wide, in 12 rows leaving 1 mm gaps horizontally and 1.5 mm 
gaps vertically. All cilia are tilted 45° to transmit mechanical stimuli both in the 
normal and the tangential directions to the surface of the skin efficiently as shown 
in Figure 9.2. The power supply line of the IPMC is provided with a flexible  
wiring board in to minimize restrictions on the hand, so the fingertip can be bent 
flexibly. The use of silicon rubber of 25 × 25 × 8 [mm] applied to the base of the 
ciliary part has made it possible to lighten the device to approximately 8 g 
including the flexible wiring board. 
An IPMC needs to be kept moistened because its actuators are operated by ionic 
migration. Even in a little wet condition in the air, however, the device can provide 
stimuli sufficiently for several minutes. 
Figure 9.5 shows the total display system. The stimulation device is attached to 
the middle finger tip. The system is designed to read positional information of the 
hand using Polhemus' FASTRAK, which can read information according to a 
magnetic field.

9.2.3. Concept of the Selective Stimulation Method 
In human skin, tactile receptors generate elementary sensations such as touch, 
pressure, vibratory sensation, pain, temperature sense, and so on. A Tactile 
impression is an integrated sensation of these elementary sensations. To present 
tactile feel arbitrarily, stimuli applied to these receptors should be controlled 
selectively and quantitatively. As mentioned previously, tactile receptors cannot 
sense the physical factors of environments directly. They detect only the skin
deformation caused by contacting objects. A tactile illusion can be provided by 
reproduction of activities of tactile receptors, regardless of the inner deformations.

Figure 9.6. Concept of selective stimulation method 
Figure 9.6 illustrates the concepts of the selective stimulation method. There are 
four types of mechanoreceptors embedded in human fingers, FA I type (Meissner's 
corpuscle), SA I type (Merkel corpuscle), FA II type (Pacinian corpuscle), and SA 
II type (Ruffini endings) [32]. It is known that each receptor has temporal response 
characteristics for mechanical stimulation and causes subjective sensation 
corresponding to its responsive deformation. For example, SA I detects static 
deformations of skin and produces static pressure sensation, and FA I detects the 
velocity of the deformation and produces the sense of fluttering vibration. Tactile 
impression is an integrated sensation of these elementary sensations. To present 
tactile feel arbitrarily, stimuli applied to these receptors should be controlled 
selectively.  
The first problem is how to stimulate each receptor selectively. We have focused 
on the frequency response characteristics of tactile receptors. Figure 9.7 [33] 
illustrates the human detection threshold against vibratory stimuli, which 
represents the sensibility of each receptor to frequency variation. A smaller 
amplitude threshold means higher sensibility. This figure shows that there are three 
frequency ranges in which the most sensitive receptor changes. In the lowest 
frequency range, SA I is most sensitive relatively. The best becomes FA I in the 
middle range and FA II in the highest range, respectively. This suggests that the 
selective stimulation can be realized using these frequency characteristics, and 
arbitral tactile feels can be produced by synthesizing several frequency components.

Figure 9.8. Perceptual range of simple vibratory sensation 
For the IPMC tactile display, selective stimulation is realized by changing drive 
frequencies, utilizing the receptors’ response characteristics. It was confirmed by 
subject’s introspection that the contents of sensation vary with the change of drive 
frequency as follows: 
(1)
Less than 5 Hz: static pressure sensation (SA I). 
(2)
10 – 100 Hz: periodical pressing or fluttering sensation, as if the surface of a 
finger is wiped with some rough material (FA I). 
(3)
More than 100 Hz: simple vibratory sensation (FA II). 
Figure 9.8 shows the experimental results of the perceptual range of simple 
vibratory sensations for (a) fixed-type display and (b) wearable display. It 
considered that the subjects begin to feel simple vibratory sensation when the 

 
Applications of Ionic Polymer-Metal Composites 235 
information from FA II exceeds that from FA I. Figure 9.7 shows that the detection 
threshold of FA II exceeds that of FA I in the vicinity of a frequency from 50 to 
100 Hz.  This agrees with the results of the perceptual range of vibratory sensation. 
To create integrated sensations, a stimulating method using composite waves of 
several frequencies was proposed.  Composite waves can stimulate the different 
kind of tactile receptors at the same time based on the selective stimulation 
method. In the earlier experiment using the fixed-type IPMC display [14], 
composite waves of high and low frequencies that present both pressure sensation 
and vibratory sensation at the same time were applied.  The result clearly shows 
that over 80 % of the ten subjects sensed some special tactile feeling, which is 
clearly different from a simple vibratory sensation. The authors confirmed that the 
composite stimulations of two frequency components selected from both the 
middle and high frequency range illustrated in Figure 9.8 could produce the 
various qualitative tactile feelings like cloth such as a towel and denim fabric [14]. 
9.2.4 Texture Synthesis Method 
We focused on the following three sensations to produce total textural feeling 
related to the physical properties of materials: (1) roughness sensation, (2) softness 
sensation, and (3) friction sensation. These sensations are fundamental to express 
the textural feel of cloth like materials. The three sensations are produced by the 
following parameters based on the proposed method described later: 
(1) Roughness sensation: changes in the frequency and the amplitude caused by 
the relationship of the wavelength of the desired surface and the hand 
velocities (Section 9.2.5). 
(2) Softness sensation: the amount of pressure sensation when the finger 
contacts the surface (Section 9.2.6). 
(3) Frictional sensation: changes in the amount of subjective sensation in 
response to hand accelerations when the finger slides across a surface 
(Section 9.2.7). 
The problem is how to connect the stimulation on each receptor with contact 
phenomena caused by hand movements and physical properties of objects. We 
have proposed stimulation methods connected to the relationship between hand 
movements and the physical properties of objects [17]. For roughness sensation, 
the frequencies of natural stimuli caused by contacting rough surfaces are changed 
in response to hand movements. Human beings have the possibility to use those 
changes of frequencies positively.  It is known that the slope of the detection 
threshold of FA I is –1 in the range of less than 40 Hz, as shown in Figure 9.7. The 
activities of FA I reflects vibratory frequencies proportionally. This means that FA I 
can perform as a frequency analyzer in a certain range. Based on this hypothesis, 
we proposed a frequency modulation method for displaying the roughness 
sensation in response to hand velocity, as described in the next section.

9.2.5 Display Method for Roughness Sensation 
9.2.5.1 Method 
As mentioned in Section 9.2.4, we suppose that human beings perceive roughness 
sensation as the change in frequency detected by FA I in the relationship between 
their hand movements and the physical properties of the roughness of materials. 
The roughness of the surface is defined approximately as a sinusoidal surface, 
which has a given wavelength O as shown in Figure 9.9. When the finger slides on 
the sinusoidal surface at a given velocity v, the frequency of stimuli f, which are 
generated in a finger point, is expressed by a wave equation as follows. 
O
v
f  
                       
(9.1)
This equation shows that if the hand velocity becomes faster or if the wavelength O
becomes shorter, the frequency f increases. We should consider the response 
characteristics of FA I, which is known as a tactile receptor related to the 
roughness sensation. It is known that FA I respons to the velocity of mechanical 
stimuli [32]. Here, when the finger slides across the surface, as shown in Figure 
9.9, a displacement of stimulus y at a given time t is defined as a sinusoidal 
function as follows,

and the frequency change in response to the velocity v. Based 
on this assumption, the roughness sensation can be presented by changing both the 
frequency and the amplitude of stimulation in accordance with hand velocity. In 

 
Applications of Ionic Polymer-Metal Composites 237 
this manner, the roughness sensation can be defined by the wavelength O. For 
practical use of this method, we applied phase adjustments to produce smooth 
outputs in response to changing frequencies with respect to each sampling time.  
Note that these frequencies are just in the high responsive range of FA I. 
Although the proposed frequency-modulation method is not allowed to apply a 
suitable range of frequency for FA I explicitly, the appropriate frequencies can be 
generated by human hand movements consequently, when the wavelength is 
defined of the order of several millimeters. 
9.2.5.2  Evaluations 
As evaluation indexes of roughness sensation, nine kinds of close-set lead balls 
that had different diameters from 0.5 to 10 mm were used as shown in Figure 9.10. 
The wearable tactile display system shown in Figure 9.5 was used. The amplitudes 
of stimulations were fixed at 6.0 V (= the maximum input) and each offset was 0.5 
V. The offset was needed to avoid an insensitive zone caused by shortage of 
amplitudes of the actuators. 
The subjects put the device on the right middle finger. They touched the index 
with their left hand at the same time. There was no restriction on time to explore. 
The subjects were six males in their twenties. 
Figure 9.11 shows the relationship between the defined wavelengths and the 
mean value of selected indexes with each error bar representing one standard 
deviation. The results showed that as the defined wavelength became longer, the 
roughness sensation seemed to increase when the two half groups were considered 
separately. Especially, as the wavelengths became shorter, the standard deviations 
became smaller and the roughness sensations were expressed clearly. 
From the results, it was confirmed that roughness sensation could be expressed 
by the parameter of the wavelength in the case of relatively short wavelengths. In 
addition to the wavelength, it is confirmed that the maximum amplitude of 
stimulus affects the amount of the subjective sensation of roughness.

9.2.6. Display Method for Pressure Sensation 
9.2.6.1 Method 
It is known that SA I detects static deformations of the skin and generates static 
pressure sensation [32]. Therefore, selective stimulation on SA I can generate 
pressure sensations. As shown in Figure 9.7, the detection thresholds of SA I hasve 
flat frequency characteristics in the range of less than 100 Hz. In most of the range 
of Figure 9.2, FA I is more sensitive than SA I. However, in the range of less than 
5 Hz, SA I becomes more sensitive than FA I. This means that the very low 
frequency vibration can generate pressure sensations relatively larger than the 
sensation of FA I. The authors confirmed that this assumption was true when the 
amplitude of simulation was enough small not to sense the vibratory sensation. 
9.2.6.2 Evaluations

stroke motions in the horizontal direction. The stimulation was simple sinusoidal 
vibrations at a frequency from 2 to 5 Hz. The stimulations were generated only 
when the hand velocity was higher than 25 mm/s despite the direction of 
movement. For measuring pressure sensation, the subjects pushed their left middle 
finger on a sponge that was set on an electric balance, controlling their finger to the 
same amount of pressure sensation of the artificial pressure sensation for 3 
seconds.  And then, the amount of the pressure sensation was calculated as the 
mean of the force for 3 seconds.  
    Figure 9.12 shows the relationship between the amplitude of vibration and the 
amount of pressure sensation at each frequency. The amounts of pressure sensation 
were calculated by a Z-score because the subjects had different sensitivities for the 
amount of the subjective sensation. The number in the parenthesis shows the mean 
value of actual forces at the frequency of 5 Hz as a reference. It was confirmed that 
as the amplitudes increase, the pressure sensations became larger for every 
frequency component. Utilizing this method, the softness of materials, which we 
feel instantaneously when the finger touches a surface, can be expressed by the 
parameter of amplitude for the frequency components of 5 Hz. If the pressure 
sensation is larger, the contacting object has more stiffness. 
9.2.7  Display Method for Friction Sensation 
To express a cloth-like textural feeling in response to contact motions, synthesis of 
both the roughness sensation and softness sensation is not enough. In this section, 
we introduce friction sensation. In this study, the definition of friction sensation is 
not a usual description based on physical contact conditions. We assumed that the 
friction sensation can be produced as changes in the amount of subjective sensation 
in response to hand acceleration when the finger slides across the surface. 
Especially, the friction sensation is used for expressing the sticking tendency of 
materials at the beginning of sliding motion.  
The authors confirmed that stimulation of high-frequency components 
corresponding to the acceleration of hand movements could produce a natural 
sliding feeling [16]. It is known that FA II detects the acceleration of stimuli, and it 
seems that FA II is related to the detection of hand movements such as by a gyro 
sensor.  Figure 9.13 illustrates the relationship between hand acceleration and 
amplitudes of the high-frequency component. The high-frequency component is 
fixed at 200 Hz, in which FA II become most sensitive. Therefore, the parameters 
of the friction sensation are the maximum and minimum values of the amplitude 
shown in Figure 9.13.

9.2.8 Synthesis of Total Textural Feeling 
9.2.8.1 Method 
In this section, syntheses of total textural feeling related to the physical properties 
of materials based on the three methods described above were evaluated. The 
voltage inputs generated by the three methods were combined into a signal by a 
simple superposition. Four materials were selected as targets of the tactile 
syntheses. The artificial textural feelings were tuned subjectively by changing the 
parameters of the roughness, softness, and friction sensations. The tunings of 
textural feelings were extremely easy compared with the author's conventional 
study because each parameter was related to the physical properties of the 
materials. The following were the properties of the four materials and the tuned 
parameters: 
(1) Boa: shaggy, thick, uneven and very rough surface  
 (O = 10, a = 5.0, P = 0.0, Fmax = 2.0) 
(2) Towel: rough surface, thick, and soft  
 (O = 2.0, a = 3.0, P = 2.0, Fmax = 1.0) 
(3) Fake leather: flat surface, thin, hard, and high friction  
(O = 8.0, a = 1.0, P = 4.0, Fmax = 3.0) 
(4) Fleece: smooth surface, thin, soft, and low friction  
(O =0.5 = 1.0, P = 5.0, Fmax = 1.0) 
9.2.8.2  Evaluations 
As shown in Figure 9.14, four artificial textures, which were tuned as mentioned 
above, were set in a matrix. The four real materials, which were boa, towel, fleece, 
and fake leather, were put on the cardboard in the same order as the artificial 
textural feelings. The wearable tactile display system shown in Figure 9.5 was 
used. The subjects put the device on the right middle or index finger. They could 
perform stroke motions with their left hand in the horizontal direction. Before the 
experiments began, the subjects had experience with the four textural feelings only 
once. The subjects compared each artificial texture with the corresponding real 

 
Applications of Ionic Polymer-Metal Composites 241 
material.  They were to evaluate the similarity of the both feelings at five levels (1: 
Poor, 2:  Fair, 3:Good, 4:Very Good, and 5:Excellent). There was no restriction on 
time to explore the textures.

Figure 9.15. Evaluations of artificial tactile feeling compared with the real materials 
The subjects were divided into two groups: three sight-restricted people (two 
females in their fifties and one female in her forties) and five ordinary persons (five 
males in their twenties). The sight-restricted people have more sensitive tactile 
sensation than ordinary persons. It was expected that the sight-restricted people 
could evaluate more correctly. 
Figure 9.15 shows the evaluation results for the sight-restricted people and the 
ordinary persons, respectively. Both of the sight-restricted people and the ordinary 

242 M. Konyo, S. Tadokoro, and K. Asaka 
persons judged more than score of 3, that is “Good”, for the almost all artificial 
textures. These results demonstrated that the proposed methods could synthesize 
the artificial textural feeling corresponding to the real materials. In addition, the 
sight-restricted people gave higher evaluations than the ordinary persons so that the 
synthesized textural feelings had the reasonable reality. 
Our tactile synthesis method is based on the physical properties of a material. 
These parameters of textural feeling can be measured as physical properties. This 
means that the artificial textural feelings could be synthesized automatically, if the 
tactile sensors could detect such physical parameters. The authors are also 
developing the tactile transmission system combining the tactile display and tactile 
sensors as a master-slave system. 
9.3. Distributed Actuation Device 
The softness of end-effectors is important in manipulation of soft objects like 
organs, food materials, micro-objects, etc. This softness can be actualized using 
two approaches: (1) drive by hard actuators with soft attachments and (2) direct 
drive by soft actuators by themselves. The former appears to be a sure method 
because of present technological development. However, to create micromachines 
or compact machines like miniature robot hands, the former is limited so it is 
difficult to find a breakthrough. The problem with the latter is that a readily 
available soft actuator material does not exist. However, the material revolution 
currently underway will surely result in the discovery of an appropriate material in 
the near future. For these reasons, it is meaningful to study methodologies for the 
effective use of such materials for manipulation with an eye to future applications. 
A promising candidate for such a soft actuator material is gel. Many gel 
materials for actuators have been studied up to the present. The Nafion-platinum 
composite (IPMC or ICPF) is a new material that is closest to satisfying the 
requirements for our applications. Because such materials are soft, it is impossible 
to apply large forces/moments at only a few points on an object, contrary to the 
case with conventional robot manipulation. At the same time, however, it is an 
advantage that large pressures cannot be applied actively or passively. So as not to 
detract from this feature, a number of actuator elements should be distributed for 
applying the driving force.  
The distributed drive is also desirable from the viewpoint of robust 
manipulation. Even if there are elements that cannot generate appropriate force, in 
principle, it is possible for the other elements to compensate for them. This 
signifies insensitivity to environmental fluctuation. In human bodies, for example, 
excretion of alien substances is performed by a whipping motion of numerous cilia. 
Paramecia move by paddling their cilia. Centipedes crawl by the cooperative wavy 
motion of a number of legs. Any of these can robustly accomplish their objectives 
irrespective of environmental change.  
An elliptical friction drive (EFD) element is an actuator element that generates 
driving force by friction using bending actuators. Figure 9.16 shows an 
experimental development using the Nafion-Pt composite. It has two actuator parts 

 
Applications of Ionic Polymer-Metal Composites 243 
with platinum plating for actuation and one Nafion part without plating for an 
elastic connection. The whole structure is fixed to form the shape of an arch. 
Figure 9.16. Structure of EFD actuator element 
When sinusoidal voltages with a phase difference are applied to the two actuators, 
the excited sinusoidal bending motions also have a phase difference. This results in 
an elliptical motion at the top point (A) of the connecting part. Figure 9.17 shows a 
developed distributed EFD device. It has 5 u 8 EFD elements on a plate. They 
cooperatively apply a driving force to an object. 
The driving principle is shown in Figure 9.18. Adjacent elements make elliptical 
motions with a phase difference of S (a two-phase drive). On the planar contact 
face, a frictional force in the x direction is generated alternately by adjacent 
elements, and then the object is driven.  
This element could be applied to a robot hand, for example, as shown in Figure 
9.19. The Nafion-Pt composite is produced by a process consisting of surface 
roughening, adsorption of platinum, reduction, and growth on a Nafion membrane. 
A masking technique using crepe paper tape with a polyethylene coating can be 
used to form any arbitrary shape of actuator on the Nafion. This technique is called 
the pattern plating method. It is an essential technique for creating the various 
shapes in the gel material required for the actuator. It is also important for 
supplying electricity efficiently.

Figure 9.18. Principle of distributed drive 
Figure 9.19. Application of device developed as a robotic hand (palm manipulation hand) 
Figure 9.20. Design parameters of EFD element 
The manufacturing process is as follows. First, composite actuators are produced 
on the supports of a Nafion membrane cut in a ladder shape. The ladder is formed 
into rings by rolling the membrane around a column in a hot water bath. The 
resultant multiple EFDs are fixed together on a plate. Then, they are wired 
electrically and the shape of each element is adjusted. 
An EFD element has many design parameters of mechanism and control, as 
shown in Figure 9.20. These parameters have effects on the performance of the 
element. It is difficult for analytical methods to give an optimal design of these 
parameters because (1)  the actuator part is not a point, (2) the motion of each part 

 
Applications of Ionic Polymer-Metal Composites 245 
of the actuator is not uniform (output internal stress and time constant), and (3) 
function of each part interferes each other. 
Investigating changing parameters by trial and error, such as in Figure 9.21, is 
necessary. Models and simulation tools minimize the number of experiments. 
The design parameters of the mechanism and control are determined by 
simulation and analysis using the Kanno-Tadokoro model and an assumption of a 
viscous friction driving mechanism, as shown in Figure 9.22. The mechanical 
parameters are listed in Table 9.1. 
Figure 9.23 shows the experimental result obtained by varying the phase 
difference, I, between the sinusoidal input voltages for each EFD element. The 
shape of the elliptical motion changes according to this phase difference. At the 
same time, the velocity of the plate changes. Consideration of the analytical and 
experimental results shows that the elliptical motion in the x direction becomes 
large when the two phases are similar, and that the y displacement increases when 
the difference between them is close to S. The speed of the object is determined by 
these two displacements. The optimal value found in this experiment is I S/2.

Applications of Ionic Polymer-Metal Composites 247 
The results from varying the frequency of the sinusoidal input are shown in Figure 
9.24. Analytical results, assuming elasticity of the material, indicate that the 
resonant frequencies of the element are approximately 5, 10, and 16 Hz. The 
experimental curve shows good correspondence because the speed is high at these 
frequencies. The viscous resistance of water is so minor that complex flow near the 
device can be ignored. The major analysis error results from a modeling error of 
the contact and the element shape. Under 3 Hz, the experimental result indicates 
that the velocity increases linearly with frequency. In this range, the speed of the 
elements is proportional to the frequency because the effect of distributed 
flexibility is small. 
The resonant frequencies vary by 20% depending on the shape of the elements. 
These frequencies depend on the initial shape and the pressure exerted by the 
object being manipulated. 
9.4. Soft Micromanipulation Device with Three Degrees of 
Freedom
Micromanipulators require the following elements: (1) compact micro-
mechanisms, (2) passive softness, (3) many DOF of motion, and (4) multimodal 
human feedback. The microactuator is one of the key issues for actualization of 
such advanced micromanipulators. They are difficult to construct using 
conventional actuators [36–38].  
The important features of the actuators are (1) soft material, (2) force output, (3) 
ease of miniaturization and machining, and (4) multi-DOF motion ability. A 3-
DOF manipulation device is developed by crossing a pair of EFD elements 
perpendicularly at the end point, as shown in Figure 9.25. 
Figure 9.25. Structure of the 3-DOF micromotion device developed 
The most important factors in its design are: (1) high flexibility and softness, (2) 
minimum internal force, and (3) large displacement (especially in 2 DOF). 
According to a characteristic synthesis using the Kanno-Tadokoro model, the 
width of the actuator is designed to be as thin as possible (w = 0.4 mm), and the 
pair of actuators is installed on a fixture in parallel. When external force and

moment fi = [fx, fy, fz, nx, ny, nz]T are exerted at the end of the i’th actuator segment,

property, it becomes a time-varying matrix depending on the deformation history.

Therefore, this device is safer than a conventional device in manipulation of 
fragile microstructures. Only the dynamics of the micromanipulator itself were 
considered here. The actual compliance is affected by surface tension, Van der 
Waals force, electrostatic force, etc. Addressing this issue is beyond the scope of 
this chapter because these parameters depend on the working environment and 
cannot be estimated for the manipulator. 
Figure 9.26 shows the relation between the magnitude of step input voltage and 
the resultant maximum displacement. Frequency characteristics under sinusoidal 
input are shown in Figure 9.27. All experiments in this chapter were performed in 
water. It was observed that the displacement increases by a quadratic curve 

 
Applications of Ionic Polymer-Metal Composites 249 
according to the voltage. Displacement in the z direction is small because the 
IPMC (or ICPF) actuators are installed in parallel and this characteristic has been 
predicted at the stage of design. Displacement in the xy direction (diagonal motion 
in a direction 45o to the x axis) is larger than the others because of the effect of the 
section shape and reduction of internal friction caused by water molecule 
movement in the material. The maximum displacement observed was 2 mm, and 
the available frequency range was up to 13 Hz. These performances are sufficient 
for the micromanipulation application. These characteristics can be predicted by 
computer simulation using models. In this application, rough estimation was 
performed using the Kanno-Tadokoro model. However, the accuracy was 
insufficient to determine the final design. 
Figure 9.26. Effect of the step input voltage on the displacement 
Figure 9.28 illustrates experimental Lissajou figures in the xy plane. This 
demonstrates that the developed device has sufficient motion for micro-
manipulation. 
The feasibility of telemanipulation by the 3-DOF device was proven using the 
experimental setup shown in Figure 9.29. Motion commands from an operator are 
given by a joystick and transmitted to the device via a PC. Actual motion is fed 
back to the operator by a microscopic image on a monitor. Figure 9.30 is a 
photographic view of the manipulation setup. The following are revealed as a 
result of various motion tests: 
(1) If the joystick is moved without rest, the device responds to high-speed 
motion commands completely, and the operator can control the motion very 
easily.
(2) When the joystick stops, the device does not stop and return to the initial 
position. The period for which the device could stop at arbitrary points was 
3 seconds. The latter characteristic exists because the Nafion-Pt composite 
material is not a position-type actuator but a force-type actuator.

Experiments have shown that the new device is capable of supporting dynamic 
micromanipulation strategies where dynamic conditions, such as adhesion and 
pushing, can be major. Gripping or grasping is possible using this manipulator, 
particularly for short-duration applications that require soft handling. Although 
effective operation was observed, issues of control still require improvement.

9.5  IPMC Sensors 
9.5.1  Background 
'A soft sensing system is extremely important for advanced applications of IPMC 
actuators, because conventional solid sensors may cancel the flexibility of IPMC. 
One possible sensor would be IPMC itself. It was reported that IPMC could be a 
motion or pressure sensor [39–40], because an electric potential would be 
generated across the composite when the strip is bent suddenly. Although 
Shahinpoor et al.[39] reported that IPMC sensor output was in proportion to the 
quasi-static displacement of bending, it is easily confirmed that an IPMC sensor 
does not respond to static deformation and that there are phase differences between 
the sensor outputs and the displacements. The authors investigated the relationship 
between the sensor output and dynamic deformations and showed that the velocity 
of deformation was in proportion to the sensor output voltage [28].  
An IPMC sensor has the following advantages in common with an IPMC 
actuator's features: (1) Soft material does not cause injury to an object and does not 
interfere with movements of soft actuators, (2) Light weight and simple structure 
make device size small.  
For example, if an IPMC sensor were used in an active catheter system [3,4], the 
system could detect contacts with blood vessels without causing injury and could 

252 M. Konyo, S. Tadokoro, and K. Asaka 
avoid a critical operational error. Another example is utilization for a tactile 
display [14–17], as mentioned above. If IPMC sensors were arranged among the 
vibrators in the same shape and materials, the display system could control the 
stimulation by measuring the pressure between the ciliary device and the human 
skin without a negative influence upon tactile feel. 
In this manner, a good combination of IPMC sensors and actuators will extend 
the ability of EAP applications. The following three arrangements can be 
considered to combine them: 
(1) Switching the sensor/actuator functions 
Both IPMC sensors and actuators can be operated by the same electrodes, if the 
electric circuits can be switched in two ways. This arrangement seems useful for a 
system that has many end effectors like a multilegged walking robot. 
(2) Parallel arrangement 
IPMC sensors can be set in parallel with the actuators in order to detect the motion 
of their body caused by actuation or external disturbances. It is possible to control 
the actuators based on sensor feedbacks. 
(3) Patterning both functions on an IPMC film
If an IPMC film is separated electrically by cutting grooves, both the sensor and 
the actuator can be unified in the same film. This arrangement is more effective to 
sense motion than the parallel arrangement because there is less interference with 
the actuation by the sensor part. Using the patterned IPMC cilium, an active 
sensing system like an insect's feeler can be realized by comparing motion 
command and sensor feedback. 
9.5.2  Basic Characteristics of IPMC Sensor 
To investigate the basic characteristics of an IPMC sensor, the relationship 
between the sensor output and the displacements of vibration were measured, when 
the IPMC strips were bent by free vibrations. Multiple vibrations with different 
frequencies were measured by changing the length of an IPMC strip from 8 to 15 
mm. The experimental setup is shown in Figure 9.31. A cantilevered IPMC strip 
was fixed by electrodes. The tip of the strip was hit by the rotary hummer 
periodically (about 1 Hz) and made a free vibration. An Au-Nafion composite type 
IPMC [41], which contained the sodium ion, was applied as a sample. The direct-
current components of the sensor output are not stable due to the hysteretic 
influence of previous motion. To avoid the influence, the alternating current 
components were extracted by a high-pass filter (cutoff frequency: 0.5 Hz), which 
was set ahead of the amplifier.

Figure 9.34. The relationship between velocities and sensor outputs
Figure 9.32 shows the example of the relationship between the displacement and 
the sensor output for the length of 15 mm. The displacements were measured at 
points 5 mm inside from the free ends. 
The outputs were generated in the same frequencies as each free vibration, and 
the mutual relationship between the amplitude of vibration and that of output was 
sufficiently estimated from the result of measurement. However, it was confirmed 
that there the sensor outputs had a phasedelay of approximately 90° toward the 
displacements. These results suggest that the sensor generates voltages in response 
to the physical value delayed on the displacement by 90°, that is, the velocity that 
is given by the differentiation of the displacement. 
Figure 9.33 shows the results of the relationship, corresponding to Figure 9.32, 
between sensor outputs and velocities, which were calculated by the difference of 
the displacements at each sampling time (1 ms). This figure shows clearly that the 
phases of the velocity are synchronized exactly with that of the output. Figure 9.33 
shows the relationship of the velocities and the sensor outputs on the 15 mm length 
of IPMC. These results showed that an excellent linear relationship exists between 
the sensor output and the velocity of bending motion despite the length of the 
IPMC. 
9.5.3  Three-DOF Tactile Sensor 
A 3-DOF tactile sensor was developed that has four IPMC sensor modules 
combined in a cross shape and can detect both the velocity and direction of motion 
of the center tip. The parallel arrangements of IPMC sensors contribute to the 
sensing ability to detect a multi degree of freedom and to the improvement of 
sensing accuracy by error correcting with several outputs. This cross-shape 
structure of the IPMC was also studied as a 3-DOF manipulator [10]. If the electric 
circuits could be switched to actuator driving circuits, the 3-DOF tactile sensors 
would perform as a soft manipulator.

Figure 9.35. The structure of the 3-DOF tactile sensor
Figure 9.36 illustrates the structure of the 3-DOF tactile sensor. Four IPMC strips 
are combined at the center pole in a cross shape. The center pole is also connected 
to the domed urethane rubber, which has enough softness and durability and can 
move in multiple directions. This center pole has the function of extending the 
deformation of the IPMC strip. To make a quantitative vibratory stimulation, the 
tip of the center pole was connected to an arm module with a low-adhesiveness 
bond. The sensor outputs were recorded when the arm module made a sinusoidal 
motion at several frequencies. The displacements of the tip of the center pole were 
measured by a laser displacement sensor. In addition, to change in the angle of 
vibration, the sensor rotated 15° at a time from 0° to 180° as shown in Figure 9.36.

Figure 9.36. Rotational angle of vibratory stimuli 
The 3-DOF tactile sensor can detect both the velocity and the direction of motion 
of the center pole by calculating from the four outputs of the IPMC sensors. The 
four sensors, however, have individual differences in their outputs, because of 
individual differences in the IPMC sensor itself and structural differences in the 
manufacturing process. In this study, the four sensor outputs were calibrated by the 
mean of the peak-to-peak value of sensor outputs when the rotated angle was 0°. 
and the frequency was 1 Hz on each sensor. 
The direction of motion can be estimated by the relationship of the four sensors. As 
shown in Figure 9.36, consider two axes of Sx and Sy, and consider the four sensor 
outputs are S1, S2, S3, and S4. Supposing VX and VY are the components of the the 
velocity on Sx and Sy, they can be expressed by the four sensor output as follows

9.5.4  Patterned Sensor on an IPMC Film 
If an IPMC film is separated electrically by cutting grooves, both the sensor and 
the actuator can be unified in the same film. This arrangement is more effective to 
sense motion than the parallel arrangement because there is less interference with 
the actuation by the sensor part.  
The authors investigated the possibility of a patterned IPMC strip that had both 
the actuator and the sensor functions [28]. The strip could sense a velocity of 
bending motion made by the actuator part. As shown in Figure 9.39 an IPMC strip 
gave a groove to the depth to be isolated using a cutter for acrylic resin board.

Figure 9.42. Velocity vs. sensor output 
The size of the strip is 3 × 20 [mm]. The strip is separated into the two sections, the 
sensor part is 1 mm wide, and the actuator part is 2 mm wide. The experimental 
setup is shown in Figure 9.40. Two couples of electrodes were arranged for the 
actuator and the sensor. The actuator part was driven by a sinusoidal input at a 
frequency of 10 Hz and in an amplitude of 1.5 V. Displacement of the center of the 
tip was measured by a laser displacement sensor. 
Figure 9.41 shows the relationship between the displacement and the sensor 
voltage. Figure 9.42 also shows the relationship between the velocity and the 
sensor voltage. It is clear that the latter agrees more with the sensor output, again. 
The results demonstrate that a patterned IPMC sensor can detect the velocity of the 
motion made by the actuator part. 
This patterning is a preliminary test to investigate the ability of patterned IPMC. 
Recently, a patterning technique using laser machining, which can cut a groove of 
50 Pm wide and about 20 Pm deep, was developed by the RIKEN Bio-mimetic 
Control Research Center team [42]. They have developed a multi-DOF robot using 
the patterned IPMC actuator. If this technique is utilized for the IPMC sensor, an 
active sensing system like an insect' s feeler can be realized by comparing a motion 
command and sensor feedback. 
9.6.  Conclusions 
In this paper, we described several robotic applications developed using IPMC 
materials, which the authors have been developed as attractive soft actuators and 
sensors. We introduced following unique devices as applications of IPCM 
actuators: (1) haptic interface for virtual tactile displays, (2) distributed actuation 
devices, and (3) a soft micromanipulation device with three degrees of freedom. 
We also focused on aspects of sensor function of  IPMC materials. The following 
applications are described: (1)a three-DOF tactile sensor and (2)a patterned sensor 
on an IPMC film.

10.1 Configuration of Segmented IPMC Actuator 
Herein, we introduce an analytical modeling method for a segmented IPMC 
actuator which can exhibit varying curvature along the actuator. This segmented 
IMPC can generate more flexible propulsion compared with a single strip IPMC 
where only forward propulsion can be generated by a simple bending motion [1,2]. 
It is well known in biomimetic system research that a simple bending motion has 
lower efficiency than a snakelike, wavy motion in propulsion [3]. To realize this 
complex motion, a segmented IPMC can be a possible solution where each 
segment of the IPMC can be bent individually.  As shown in Figure 10.1, the 
segmented IPMC design consists of a number of independently electroded sections 
along the length of the actuator. Each segment of the IMPC can be made by 
carving the surface of the IPMC and monitoring the electric insulation of each 
segment. Figure 10.2 shows a three-segment actuator consisting of Nafion 
(ionomeric polymer) passive substrate layer of thickness hb where two layers of 
metallic electrode (platinum) of thickness hp are placed on both sides. The 
electrodes for each segment are wired independently from the others, and by 
selectively activating each segment, varying curvature along the length may be 
obtained. The magnitude of curvature can be controlled by adjusting the voltage 
level applied across each segment. By controlling the curvature of the actuator 
along the length, it is possible to use this actuator as a steerable device in the water. 
Here, we focus on the development of an analytical model to predict the free 
deflection of this segmented actuator.

10.2 RC Model of IPMC 
The analytical model is developed based on the clumped RC model of the IPMC 
[4,7] and a beam bending theory accounting for large deflections. The clumped RC 
model relates the input voltage applied to the IPMC strip to the charge. It has been 

Dynamic Modeling of Segmented IPMC Actuator 265 
shown that the IPMC often exhibits slow relaxation toward a cathode after quick 
bending towards an anode. However, this relaxation phenomenon associated with 
the bending curvature of the IPMC strip is ignored in this RC model.  The finite- 
element approach is used to describe the dynamics of the segmented IPMC strip. It 
is considered as composed of finite elements that can be used to represent a large 
mechanical deflection of the IPMC using a geometrical approximation of the 
IPMC shape under no axial and shear loading condition. An energy approach is 
used to formulate the equations, and the bending moment applied in each segment 
is assumed to be proportional to the bending curvature determined from the simple 
first-order model.  The modeling steps are described briefly in this section.  
Figure 10.3. Clumped RC model for segment i
The IPMC has two parallel electrodes and electrolyte between the electrodes. The 
capacitance formed between two electrodes and internal resistance of electrolyte 
can be modeled as a simple RC circuit shown in Figure 10.3. For a voltage input to 
segment i, Vi, the electric charge, Qi, and the current, Ii, in the circuit become

where s is a Laplace complex variable. 
Under a step input voltage, the IPMC strip shows a bending towards an anode 
due to cation migration towards a cathode in the polymer network. This bending 
moment is modeled using a simple first-order model of

10.3 Mechanical Model of IPMC 
10.3.1 Kinematics 
Analytical solutions are available for several special cases of geometric 
nonlinearity in a cantilever beam [8]. Here, the finite-element approach is used to 
describe the dynamics of the segmented IPMC strip. We assume that the number of 
segments, n, is the same as the number of elements used in the modeling as shown 
in Figure 10.4. Hence, there are n+1 nodes with the nodes of a element (i) being 
node (i) and (i+1).  The displacement of any point on the IPMC is described in 
terms of nodal displacements and slopes. The lateral displacement at distance xi
can be expressed as follows:

The IPMC would not experience axial loading and the axial deformation is 
ignored, however, its position in the x direction is determined geometrically by the 
lateral deformation only. As shown in Figure 10.5, an infinitesimal deformation du
in the axial direction can be expressed as dx

In the kinematic analysis of a beam, axial extension and shearing deformation are 
ignored, and only lateral velocity contributes to the inertia. This assumption can be 
justified considering the thin geometry of the IPMC and the pure bending moment 
assumption. Based on these assumptions, the kinetic energy of the i-th element

 and s is the Laplace variable. The viscoelastic property of the 
IPMC can be included here by replacing E with complex modulus E*. It is well 
known that the stress-strain relationship of a viscoelastic material includes not only 
the instantaneous strain, but the strain history as well. This frequency-dependent 
term of the complex modulus E* can be modeled by the transfer function h(s) 
represented by the sum of appropriate rational polynomials that depends on the 
types of viscoeleastic models [5,6].

10.3.4 State Space Model 
Unlike the small deflection model of the IPMC [4] the large deflection model 
cannot be modeled as a standard linear state space model because the deflection in 
the axial direction is determined by the lateral deflection of the IPMC, as shown in 
Eq. (10.10). To realize the combined dynamic model for an entire IPMC length of 
n segments including linear RC models, Eq. (10.4) can be written as

Equation (10.33) can be used for designing control laws for the segmented IPMC 
strip for various applications. Note that extra state variables must be defined for the 
viscoelastic property of the IPMC expressed as E* or h(s) in Eq. (10.26) for the 
state variable of Eq. (10.33). 
10.4 Computer Simulation 
Computer simulation was performed for Eq. (10.33) for n=3 for different 
magnitudes of input voltage in each element. Table 10.1 shows the simulation and 
material parameters used in this computational study. Figures 10.6 and and 10.7 
show the large deflection simulation of the segmented IPMC for the step input 
voltage of V={3 3 3}T volt and V={-3 2 3}T, respectively. In this simulation, the 
viscoelastic property of the IPMC is ignored, i.e., E*=E or h(s)=0.

10.5 Conclusions
In this study, we described the analytical framework for deriving the dynamic 
model of the segmented IPMC. For the electromechanical property of the IPMC, a 
simple RC model is used and the finite-element approach is used for dynamic 
modeling of the mechanical portion of the segmented IPMC. The proposed 
modeling approach can be used for designing various controllers for effective 
underwater propulsion and other robotics applications where soft and complex 
motion are required. The proposed segmented IPMC can be a possible solution 
because each segment of the IPMC can be bent individually. The state space 
equation developed using a large deflection beam model was simulated for 
different input voltages, and simulation results show that the proposed model can 
be effectively used for estimating the motion of the segmented IPMC in various 
applications.
