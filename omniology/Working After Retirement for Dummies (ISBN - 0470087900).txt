About the Author
Lita Epstein, MBA, excels at translating complex financial topics critical to
people’s everyday life. She enjoys helping people develop good financial,
investing, and tax-planning skills. She designs and teaches online courses on
topics such as investing for retirement, getting ready for tax time, and finance
and investing for women. 
Lita lives in a 55-plus community in Florida and works (and plays) with many
people who moved there after retirement, but for various reasons have gone
back to work.  Some because they were bored, but many because their
money just isn’t going as far as they thought.  Others have gone back to work
to get access to group health insurance, because it is just too expensive to
buy on an individual basis.
Lita has over a dozen books on the market, including Streetwise Crash Course
MBA, Streetwise Retirement Planning, and Alpha Teach Yourself Retirement
Planning in 24 Hours, as well as books on Social Security and Medicare.  Lita
also is a faculty member in the College of Graduate Business and
Management at the University of Phoenix.
She was the content director for the financial services Web site,
MostChoice.com,  and managed the Web site Investing for Women. She 
also wrote TipWorld’s Mutual Fund Tip of the Day in addition to columns
about mutual fund trends for numerous Web sites.

Working After Retirement For Dummies

Introduction
C
an you imagine yourself sunning by the pool, playing cards, or golfing with
friends and then eating out — all day, everyday for the rest of your life?
That might sound great when you first start doing it, but few people find they
want to keep doing it for the 20 to 30 years they will likely live in retirement.
More and more of today’s retirees are choosing to go back to work, whether
it’s because they need the money, they need access to healthcare insurance,
or they just want to do something more productive. Many are choosing to
start their own business from their homes just to avoid getting back into the
day-to-day grind — and the politics — of working in a traditional job.
Others are going back to work part-time in a totally new field to try some-
thing new or just to bring in some extra cash. Still others are going back to
work full time, many in service environments where they don’t make much
more than minimum wage but need to get access to group health insurance.
I fit into the category of someone who was downsized just before the age of
50 and had to decide what to do next. I decided I wanted to work from home
and started my own writing business. As you can see, I’m still at it.
Actually I started to work on building that business even before being laid off
because it was a direction that I’d hoped to take at some point in the future.
That point of decision came sooner than expected when I was laid off after the
dot.com I was working for imploded, but I’ve never regretted it. I love being
my own boss and deciding what I want to do next and when I want to do it.
That’s true for many people once they reach the age of 50. I live and work in a
55-plus active-adult community with neighbors all around me that chose to
work again. Some work from home as consultants for their former company
or for others in their former industry; others choose to start their own home-
based businesses.
Many work for Disney World, who has been so successful recruiting from my
community that they set up shop here one day a month to recruit both full-
and part-time workers. My neighbors enjoy the ticket and merchandise bene-
fits, which they use when their families visit. Most work part-time, but those
who need access to healthcare insurance often choose to work full-time. The
money may not be great, just barely over minimum wage, but the benefits
make up for it.

Working After Retirement For Dummies 
Scenarios like this one repeat themselves in communities all over the country
as baby boomers reach retirement age. You’ve probably seen many articles
written about how baby boomers are changing the meaning of the word
retirement. It’s true, and companies are changing the way they think of retire-
ment as well.
About This Book
In Working After Retirement For Dummies, I introduce you to alternative ways
to work after retirement, as well as talk about things you must consider to
live in retirement — how to manage your finances, your retirement portfolio,
and your healthcare.
More and more companies are creating alternatives to traditional retirement,
making it possible for people to work part-time and collect partial retirement
benefits. Others find they need the brain power of all the baby boomers
whose decisions to retire are draining these companies of years of needed
experience, so they are finding creative ways to keep them involved after
retirement through mentor programs, consulting, part-time work, or other
innovative programs.
Throughout this book, I explore the various work alternatives and give you the
ammunition you need to look for a new job or run your own business. Most
people over the age of 50 face some job discrimination and must respond 
to the myths about our age group, so I help you deal with those challenges 
as well.
Although I’d love for you to read this book from cover to cover, you don’t
have to. Because this is a reference book, you can pick and choose what you
want or need to read. Throughout Working After Retirement For Dummies, I’ve
included information that might be of interest to only some readers depend-
ing on their individual choices. For example, if you want to start your own
business, you won’t need to read about how to write a resume or deal with
tough interview questions. You can easily pick and choose the topics that are
most relevant to you and skip chapters that don’t match your particular situ-
ation. Of course, you won’t be penalized for reading everything!
Foolish Assumptions
While writing this book, I made some key assumptions about who you are
and why you’ve picked up this book to plan your work life after retirement:

 You’re a retiree who just found out that their pension will be much less
than expected and now must consider going back to work.
 You’re a retiree who just can’t afford to pay for healthcare insurance or
can’t get access to it at all, so you must find a way back into a group
health insurance package by going back to work.
 You’re a retiree who wants to do more than just play cards, golf, or swim
and is looking for more intellectual stimulation either by working, volun-
teering, or maybe going back to school.
What You’re Not to Read
You don’t have to read the paragraphs marked tech stuff or those gray-shaded
boxes. That’s extra information you might find interesting, but isn’t required
for you to understand the points I’m making.
How This Book Is Organized
Working After Retirement For Dummies is divided into six parts, which I out-
line in the sections that follow.
Part I: Getting Ready to Retire . . . Not!
In Part I, I discuss the reasons people are going back to work, offer you tools
for how to assess your own skills and interests, and then talk about how to
figure out what you want to do next.
Part II: Your Wallet to Your Health: The
411 When You Re-Enter the Workforce
In Part II, I focus on your pocketbook and your healthcare. I help you sort out
how much money you do have available in retirement and figure out how to be
sure you don’t run out of money during retirement. I also introduce you to the
maze of healthcare and insurance issues that you’ll face in retirement. I do split
that into two discussions — one for people who retired early and don’t have
Medicare and a second for people who do have Medicare. In addition, I introduce
you to the Social Security maze and discuss tax impacts for retirees.

Introduction

Part III: Finding Your Next Job
In Part III, I talk about all the basics you need to find your next job. I start
with ideas for rebuilding your job search and interviewing skills. Then I talk
about the myths you’ll need to combat when looking for a job when you’re
over the age of 50 and give you ideas for how to fight back. Finally, I explore
options to full-time work.
Part IV: Revisiting Your Former Career or
Starting Your Own Business
In Part IV, I explore various ways to stay in your field or think about starting
your own business. First I talk about alternatives to working full-time within
your own company. Then I explore consulting for your former company or
within your former industry. Finally, I talk about starting your own business,
buying an existing business, or buying a franchise.
Part V: Knowledge to Philanthropy:
Opportunities to Broaden the Mind 
and More
In Part V, I explore options for you to consider if you don’t need the money,
but want to go back to work to expand your knowledge or travel. First I
explore various learning opportunities, then I talk about volunteering both in
the United States and globally.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
The Part of Tens is the hallmark of the For Dummies series. In this part, I high-
light the top ten companies to work for in retirement, the top ten business skills
in retirement, and ten great volunteering experiences you may want to try.

Getting Ready to
Retire . . . Not!

In this part . . .
N
ot quite ready to retire yet? Well, you’re not alone.
Many retirees need or want to go back to work. 
In this part, I review the reasons people are choosing 
to go back to work. I help you find tools to assess your
strengths and weaknesses and then help you find
resources that will aide you in figuring out what you want
to do next.

Chapter 1
The World of Work 
After Retirement
In This Chapter
 Retiring or working
 Managing money and health
 Exploring work alternatives
 Running a business
 Expanding your knowledge
 Giving back to your community
A
s you face the fact that you’ll probably be living 20 to 30 or more years
in retirement and begin to realize that it’s a long time to just play in
retirement, you may start wondering whether that’s really what you want to
do for the rest of your life.
You also may wonder if you truly have the financial resources in place to fund
that long of a period without working. Even if you do, you may wonder if
you’ll need more intellectual stimulation than you currently have planned.
In this chapter, I introduce you to all the challenges you face as you plan your
retirement years. You may decide retirement isn’t all it’s cracked up to be and
consider the possibility of returning to work — whether it’s because you
need the money, you want to do something to give back to your community,
or you want to explore options for stimulating yourself intellectually.
Making that Critical Decision — Stay
Retired or Go Back to Work
After you get home from your final retirement party and you face a life with-
out having to go into work every day, the initial sense of relief is wonderful.

10
Part 1: Getting Ready to Retire . . . Not! 
But, when you continue to do that for weeks or months on end, you may end
up deciding this is not how you want to spend the rest of your life.
While you may not want to go back to the daily grind of working 40 to 60
hours a week or more, you may find that you don’t have enough money to
maintain the lifestyle you’ve come to know and enjoy. You’re now at cross-
roads to decide whether or not to go back to work, how to go about doing
that, and what you want to do.
Needing or wanting to work
Many newly retired people find they must face a difficult truth — their retire-
ment nest egg just won’t go as far as they thought it would, especially with
healthcare costs rising twice as fast as incomes. That makes things even
more difficult when you’re on a fixed-income retirement budget with no
chance for raises to cover those ever increasing costs. Here are some sce-
narios of why people need or want to go back to work:
 Without going back to work at least part-time to supplement your retire-
ment income, you could quickly find that your spending money you
thought would be available for entertainment and travel quickly disap-
pears. As healthcare and other costs of living continue to rise during
retirement, you could find that you don’t even have enough money for
the day-to-day basics you need.
 You’ve probably read stories in your local paper about seniors eating
pet food in order to be able to afford their medicines. While Medicare
prescription drug coverage helps to some extent, the infamous Medicare
Part D donut hole, where all of a sudden seniors find they have no cover-
age for awhile, is still creating financial crises for many people depend-
ent on a fixed income who can’t afford monthly financial surprises.
 While healthcare expenses can be the biggest problem, people who
worked for companies that were sold or went bankrupt can be hard hit
too. Many of these people who expected a certain guaranteed pension
find they’re earning about half what they expected when the company
switched to another type of employer-retirement plan, such as a cash-
balance plan. Suddenly they find out that they have no choice but to go
back to work to pay the bills.
 Others just have to admit they didn’t save enough to keep up the
lifestyle they’ve become accustomed to and want to continue to enjoy.
Still others who thought they had equity of $500,000 to a million dollars
in the home they bought 20 to 30 years ago and planned to use that for
their retirement portfolio, found it’s worth half what they expected as

the housing bubble burst around the U.S. in 2006. I talk more about man-
aging your retirement assets in Chapters 5 and 6.
 Money is not the only reason people choose to go back to work. Some
find they miss the professional camaraderie they enjoyed in the work-
place and want to return there to reconnect with their professional 
network.
 Some retirees decide they want to go back to school or teach to get the
intellectual juices going. Throughout this book you’ll find many alterna-
tives you can consider to the traditional retirement of golfing, swimming,
card playing, and periodic travel. You can either go back to work, volun-
teer, or go back to school and still be among the ranks of today’s
retirees.
Assessing your talents
Suppose you do make the choice that you want to earn some money, but you
just can’t face going back to the same old grind. You’re ready for a complete
job change doing anything but what you did before.
Or, you may just want to step out of your comfort zone and look for new and
different ways to use your talents, but you’ve got to figure out what it is you
want to do next. In Chapter 3, I introduce you to the resources you can
access to assess your talents and determine your next steps.
You can use these tools to gauge your strengths and weaknesses and figure
out what you truly enjoy doing and what you hate to do. You can also figure
out how you like to work, whether it’s alone or in teams and whether you like
to work under the direction of someone else or if you prefer to be
autonomous.
Figuring out what you want to do
After you’ve assessed yourself, you then need to figure out the type of job
you want to do. In Chapter 4, you can find information about whether or not
to seek a job counselor and how to find one.
I also give you pointers about how to set up an effective network to improve
your professional contacts and tap into possible work opportunities. If you
find you need the support of others, I introduce you to how support groups
work and how to find them.

Chapter 1: The World of Work After Retirement

Managing Your Money and Your Health
Managing your retirement savings and pensions, especially after paying the
ever-increasing costs of healthcare, can require a difficult balancing act. You
certainly don’t want to run out of money during retirement, so you want to be
sure that the amount you take out each year leaves you with enough in your
portfolio for your future needs as well.
If you’ve never managed a large investment portfolio before retirement, when
you get a sizeable lump sum from rolling out your employer-sponsored retire-
ment savings, you’ll be faced with a daunting task of what to do with all that
money.
You also could be faced with decisions about how to get and pay for health
insurance, if you retire before you’re eligible for Medicare.
Taking inventory on what you have
Your first step should be to take an inventory of what you do own in retire-
ment savings and what cash flow you can expect from pensions. Then you
need to learn rules that govern how and when you can start to use that
money.
You also need to learn how to invest those assets wisely, so they’ll continue
to grow at an appropriate rate and help you to extend the life of your portfo-
lio throughout your retirement years. I discuss how to do all that in Chapter
5. You’ll find that your strategies for managing your portfolio will change as
you age.
Keeping yourself solvent
Once you understand how to manage the funds, you then will need to
develop withdrawal strategies for each type of retirement asset you have,
whether it’s an annuity, IRA, or traditional pension. You find the key things
you need to consider in Chapter 6.
Another new set of rules you need to learn in retirement are the tax rules for
your pension funds and retirement savings. I give you an overview of these
critical rules and how to deal with them in Chapter 6.
12
Part 1: Getting Ready to Retire . . . Not! 

Sorting out the rules of Social Security 
and work
If you do go back to work and have already started to collect from Social
Security, the rules governing that can be a maze of confusion. You can work
and collect your Social Security benefits after you’ve reached your full retire-
ment age (which was 65 but is gradually increasing to 67) without facing a
reduction in your benefits.
But, if you started collecting Social Security early before you reached full
retirement age and then decide to go back to work, you will face a partial
reduction in your Social Security benefits. I talk about all this and what you
need to do in Chapter 7.
Completing your tax returns when you work and collect Social Security can
be a bit more complicated. In some cases, your Social Security benefits may
be taxed and in other situations they may not be, it all depends on how much
income you have and how that income is derived. You can find more informa-
tion on these tax issues in Chapter 7.
All the news is not bad though; you can improve your Social Security benefits
for the rest of your life if you go back to work and replace some low-dollar
earning years with years that you earn more money. That’s because Social
Security calculates benefits based on your highest 35 years of earnings. So,
for example, if you stopped working for 10 to 20 years to raise a family, all
those zero-dollar-earning years can get replaced with higher earnings as you
work after retirement.
You can decide not to collect Social Security at all when you first retire even
if you’re eligible. If you’re too young, you may not yet be eligible to apply for
Social Security. Most people must wait at least until the age of 62. There are
some exceptions to the rule, but that impacts very few and I won’t go into
those details here.
You do get a benefit for waiting though. If you delay collecting Social Security
past full retirement age, your lifetime monthly benefit will go up every month
until age 70. So if you plan to work until 70 and you’d like to increase your
potential Social Security payment, you may want to delay collecting benefits
until age 70, but don’t wait any longer.
Your benefits won’t increase any higher after age 70, except for cost of living
adjustments. I discuss all these rules about delaying Social Security in
Chapter 8.
13
Chapter 1: The World of Work After Retirement

Staying healthy with and without
Medicare
Your health insurance will vary dramatically depending on whether or not you
qualify for Medicare and have retiree health coverage through your former
employer. If you’re not eligible for Medicare, individual health insurance for
many people age 50 or older will likely be more than $600 to $700. You can
double those estimates if you and your spouse both need individual plans.
Many people 50 years and older have difficulty even getting individual health
coverage because of their preexisting conditions. Even arthritis, which
afflicts more than 50 percent of people over age 50, can result in a denial of
coverage or a rider that won’t cover anything the insurance deems related to
arthritis. You can forget any coverage for joint-related medical needs.
Access to affordable group health insurance sends more people back to work
after retirement than any other single issue. Some people I know who even
have retiree group health coverage from their former employer find premi-
ums and other out-of-pocket expenses they must pay skyrocketing, driving
them back to work. Those who do not have access to group healthcare tend
to look for a job that includes health insurance benefits.
Even friends who do have Medicare are finding that the premiums for Part B
and D plus the required out-of-pocket expenses that are still required are
eroding their monthly retirement income. They, too, have sought either part-
time jobs or started a small home-based business to supplement their
income primarily to pay medical-related expenses.
I talk about healthcare issues for people under age 65 in Chapter 9 and focus
on Medicare and related issues for people 65 and older in Chapter 10.
Going Job Hunting
If you’re going back to work after a long stint at the some company for most
of your life, you probably haven’t had to build a resume and look for a job in
a very long time. The job market definitely changed dramatically and job-
seeking skills are very different than ones you used many years ago.
As you look for a job today, you’ll find that most companies prefer contact
electronically, either by e-mail or by filling out an application online or both.
You won’t find many situations where telephone contact is encouraged early
in the application process unless you find the opening through a friend who
can give you contact information for the hiring manager.
14
Part 1: Getting Ready to Retire . . . Not! 

Yes, it’s true, networking is still the best way to get a job, but you’ll still need
to conform to the new resume rules and deal with what can sometimes be
tough interview questions directed primarily at older workers. I talk about
rebuilding your job search skills in Chapter 11.
I talk about difficult interview questions you may be asked and how to
answer them in Chapter 12. Finally, in Chapter 13 you can read a discussion
of the myths you’ll need to combat during your job search. I give you some
ammunition for detecting and responding to them as well, if they crop up
during your job search.
Working Less Than Full Time
You don’t have to go back to work full-time after retirement. More and more
companies are adopting flexible hiring policies. You can usually find what
you’d probably think of as traditional part-time work, but you may find the
hours more flexible. You also could search for telecommuting jobs that will
let you work primarily from your home.
If you don’t want to guarantee your time year-round to a company, you will
find temporary agencies that focus on serving the 50-plus age group. They
can find you assignments that range from a few weeks to a few months.
You can find more details about flexible work alternatives in Chapter 14. You
may also want to review the top ten companies to work for in Chapter 21, to
get an idea of what some of the top companies offer older workers in benefits
and flexibility to keep them happy and working.
In the 1980s and early 1990s many companies downsized and laid off older
workers offering sizeable retirement packages to lure them to leave, you won’t
find that as common today. Many companies face a different problem — brain
drain. They don’t know how they’ll be able to find enough qualified workers to
replace those Baby Boomers who will be retiring.
Revisiting Your Past or Starting Your
Own Business
Often after retiring, people realize they want to work for their company again
or maybe even start their own business. In either case, you can find several
opportunities to fit the bill.
15
Chapter 1: The World of Work After Retirement

Working for your company — again
Even if you’ve left your company, you may want to revisit working for them
again either in a part-time position, as an independent contractor, or as a
consultant. More and more companies are starting to offer phased retirement
programs that let you cut back your hours and collect a partial retirement
pension.
Others are allowing their workers to leave and roll out their 401(k) or other
employer-based retirement savings. Once they’ve formally left and gotten
their money, companies rehire them when they are ready to come back to
work. This helps the worker, who can afford to cut back hours because he
can then supplement his part-time income by withdrawing funds from the
rolled-out pension plan. I talk about going back to work for your old company
in Chapter 15.
If you were a high-level executive with a unique set of skills, you may be able
to set up a consulting contract with a guaranteed income in exchange for a
minimum number of work hours. I discuss various consulting arrangements
you may want to consider with your former employer in Chapter 16.
If you can’t work something out with your former employer, or you just don’t
want to go back there, you can also consider consulting in your former indus-
try. I talk more about how to do that in Chapter 17.
Following your dream of owning 
your own business
Another option you have may be to take this time to follow a life-long dream
of being your own boss and running your own company. You can do that in
three different ways — start a business from scratch, buy an existing busi-
ness, or buy a franchise (a business in a box). I discuss the pros and cons of
each of these options in Chapter 18. In Chapter 22, I review the top ten skills
you need to run a business.
Many retirees I know have chosen to run a one- or two-person (usually hus-
band and wife) business from their home. Others have turned a hobby into a
business.
For example, some who enjoy painting, now work as painting contractors in
the area. A former business owner who ran a new-home construction com-
pany, now runs a new-home construction inspection company from his home.
He gets most of his clients through referrals of other people who bought
homes in the area.
16
Part 1: Getting Ready to Retire . . . Not! 

Many of my friends who run home-based businesses are not looking to earn big
bucks. They just want to supplement their income, primarily to pay healthcare
premiums and out-of-pocket expenses and to have some additional money for
more entertainment and travel expenses. They don’t want to work the hours or
endure the stresses of managing a larger company.
Expanding Your Horizons
If you don’t need to make money, but want to do something more stimulating
than the traditional retirement activities of playing golf, cards, or mahjong or
going swimming, you may want to consider going back to school. Some
retirees decide they want to complete a traditional degree program, but
others just take courses for the joy of learning.
In Chapter 19, I explore all the educational options people aged 50 and older
can consider, both in this country and globally. You’ll find you can often com-
bine an educational program with an enjoyable vacation trip.
If you don’t need the money, but would like to work and help others, you can
consider volunteering your time. Myriad volunteer options are available for
seniors right in their own community, or they can travel and volunteer around
the world. In Chapter 20, I explore some excellent volunteer opportunities
both in the U.S. and around the globe.
Now for the best stuff: In the Part of Tens section you can find the best compa-
nies to work for, key skills you’ll need if you want to start your own business,
and the top ten volunteer opportunities you may want to explore. Whatever
you decide to do in retirement, always remember that it should be something
you enjoy doing!

Why You May Need or Want 
to Go Back to Work
In This Chapter
 Needing the money to live
 Paying for doing the things you enjoy
 Staying in touch professionally
 Getting bored
U
nfortunately, you may have discovered that your retirement nest egg
will not go as far as you planned. Or your company may have defaulted
on its pension plan and you are receiving much less per month than expected.
Many of you found that your 401(k) became a 201(k) after the stock market
crash of 2001. Perhaps healthcare costs have sent you back to work. For what-
ever reason, if you run short on funds in retirement, you have to go back to
work.
Even if you don’t need the money, you may be thinking of going back to work
because you’re bored or want more professional contact. The fact is, if you’re
heading back to work, you’re not alone. In this chapter, I explore the reasons
many people are going back to work after retirement; I give you ideas of what
you can do to minimize your risk of being forced back to work and yet main-
tain your lifestyle; and I share ideas of how you can avoid becoming bored in
retirement.
Facing the Financial Facts
Your dream retirement may include traveling to all the spots you never had
time to visit, spending time with friends and family, working on your favorite
hobby, learning new crafts, or whatever else fits your idea of the perfect
retirement.

Part 1: Getting Ready to Retire . . . Not! 
Now that you’ve made it to the other side, you find that your finances just
aren’t enough. People find there are three key reasons they just don’t have
enough in retirement — their planned nest egg was lost because investments
went sour, their pension payments are not as high as expected, or they just
didn’t save enough. I keep you up-to-date on what is happening to retirement
and people’s finances on my Web site “Working After Retirement” (www.
workingafterretirement.info).
Lost nest egg
Millions of Americans lost their retirement nest eggs in the stock market as it
crashed between 2000 and 2002. Most had funds invested through their
employers’ retirement savings programs, such as a 401(k). Others had their
own retirement savings in Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs).
Just to give you an idea of how people’s retirement savings in 401(k)s turned
into 201(k)s, here’s what happened to the two key stock indexes:
The Dow Industrial Average dropped from 11,497 to 8,341. That’s a 25 per-
cent drop in 30 of what many think are the most solid companies.
Nasdaq dropped from 4,069 to 1,336. That’s a 67 percent drop in what
were primarily high-growth technology stocks, which were all the rage in
the late 1990s and early 2000s. Many people thought the bubble would
never burst and kept pouring more and more of their hard-earned savings
into these growth stocks.
Unfortunately, too many people forgot the basics of asset allocation, or chose
to believe the tech-stock hype that asset allocation was dead. Asset allocation
is a means to invest your portfolio in a number of asset classes, such as
stocks, bonds, and cash. A smart investor keeps a well-balanced portfolio that
mixes stocks, bonds, and cash, as well as assets that meet various investment
strategies, such as growth, value, or balanced. How much you allocate to each
type of asset in this mix is called the allocation. A conservative allocation
could be 20 percent in stock and 80 percent in bonds and/or cash. An aggres-
sive portfolio could be the opposite — 80 percent in stocks and 20 percent in
cash and/or bonds. Many different types of asset allocations fit between these
two scenarios. I talk more about asset allocation and managing your portfolio
in Chapter 5.
Asset allocation also looks at the individual assets you hold. Many portfolio
managers will tell you never to hold more than 4 percent of your portfolio in
the stock of one company. That’s for your safety. If the company goes bust
(and we’ve seen how even multi-billion-dollar companies such as Enron can
go bust), you still have other assets (such as real estate, mutual funds, or
bonds) to prevent a dramatic drop in your retirement savings portfolio.

If you work in a company that made its contribution to your 401(k) in stock,
you can quickly end up with more than 4 percent of that company’s stock in
your portfolio. Take a look at what’s in your 401(k) and be sure it’s not over-
loaded with your company’s stock. That can be an even greater risk for some-
one still working at the company. Not only is their retirement fund tied to the
company, but their employment is as well. That’s definitely putting too many
eggs in the same basket and is a recipe for disaster.
Dependence on stock in even great companies that look very safe can be a
big mistake as well. For example, when I was living in Atlanta, I met many
people who worked at Coca-Cola and filled their retirement portfolios with its
stock, watching their portfolios grow gleefully as the stock climbed. In June
1995, Coca Cola reached the highest high that it was going to reach for ten
years — $63.75. At the end of June 2006 it was trading in the low 40s. That’s
more than a 35 percent loss to people who held on hoping for recovery.
The drop from the $60 range to the $40 range was a fast one. It happened
between December 2000 and March of 2001. A few times since then, Coca
Cola reached into the $50 range. Hopefully some of the folks whose portfolios
were heavy in Coca-Cola stock wised up and shifted assets during these times
before the stock dropped back into the $40 range. Even if they did, they’re
still looking at significant losses because they held too many eggs in the same
basket.
Stock losses are not the only reason nest eggs are lost
While poor choices in managing one’s retirement portfolio is the primary
reason people lose their nest eggs, other things can happen as well:
 Your company closes or goes bankrupt and the 401(k) assets cannot be
found. I talk more below about what types of protections are in place
and how you might be able to find the assets.
21
Chapter 2: Why You May Need or Want to Go Back to Work
Employer-based retirement savings 
programs vary greatly
While I focus in this chapter on the 401(k), 
which is the most common form of an employer-
sponsored retirement savings fund, you may have
a different kind of employer-sponsored fund.
People working for nonprofit entities have 403(b)s,
which are similar to 401(k)s. If you work in a small
company, you may not have a 401(k), instead your
plan may be called a Simplified Employee Pension
(SEP) IRA, a Savings Incentive Match Plan for
Employees (SIMPLE) IRA, or a Keogh Plan (these
are very rare today). Deferred profit-sharing plans
may also be offered by your employer.

 You leave your job and take your 401(k) assets with you and then spend
them. That’s a big no-no if you want money in retirement, but more than
45 percent of employees that take out their 401(k) when they switch
jobs spend at least part of it before putting the money into an individual
retirement plan.
 You borrow against your 401(k) and are not able to pay it back fully in
the designated time or before you’re retired, so you lose the assets.
 You divorce and don’t protect your rights to your spouse’s retirement
savings at his or her place of employment and then can’t find the money.
Finding a lost retirement account
If you worked for a company that went bankrupt, merged, was acquired by
another, or for any other reason closed, your retirement savings may not be
lost. The U.S. Department of Labor has an Abandoned Plan Coordinator that
may be able to help you locate your missing nest egg. For information about
the Abandoned Plan Program, call 1-866-444-3772 or you can write the coordi-
nator at:

Part 1: Getting Ready to Retire . . . Not! 
Protecting your retirement savings in divorce
Many people do not think of retirement when
divorcing, but this can be the only time you will
be able to guarantee your rights to your spouse’s
employer-based retirement plans. If you’ve
stayed at home and taken care of the children
while your spouse was working, you probably
didn’t save for retirement or, at the very least, you
didn’t save an equivalent amount to what your
spouse’s retirement plan offered at work. You do
have the right to get part of that employer-based
retirement plan, but you must protect that right
with a Qualified Domestic Order signed by the
court at the time of your divorce. The order is
then filed with the company that manages the
retirement plan.

Reduced pension payments
Not all people’s retirement income comes from retirement savings plans. In 
fact, up until about the 1980s, most people retiring could count on what is 
called a defined-benefit plan or pension plan. In that type of plan, your employer
contributes a certain amount of your income into a retirement portfolio man-
aged by the company, and you get a monthly benefit for the rest of your life
when you retire based on the income you earned and your years of service.
This type of retirement plan is rapidly disappearing today. In 2003, only 15.5
percent of people working for private companies were covered by a defined-
benefit plan and another 16.6 percent had some combination of a defined-
benefit plan and a defined-contribution plan (those are 401(k)-type plans
where you and the employer contribute to the plan, but you manage how the
money will be taken out).
Getting your pension paid by PBGC
If you were expecting a pension from a company that went bankrupt, you
may still have a chance to collect the funds. Most pension plans are pro-
tected by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), which protects
the retirement incomes of 44.1 million American workers in 30,330 private-
sector defined-benefit pension plans. The PBGC was created by the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). ERISA protects other forms
of employer-based retirement programs also.
Companies that offer pension plans guaranteed by PBGC pay insurance pre-
miums for that guaranty. If the company at some time in the future cannot
fund its pension benefits, the PBGC takes over and pays those benefits out of
its insurance fund. If you worked for a company that offered you a pension
and it no longer exists, you may find that you can still collect on the pension
through PBGC. On its Web site, PBGC provides a tool that you can use to
search for pensions that may be available to you. To find out if there are pen-
sion funds waiting for you, a family member, or a friend:
1. Go to www.pbgc.gov.
2. Look for the section called, “Workers and Retirees.”
3. Then click on “Pension Search: Help Us Find Missing Participants.”
4. Search by name to find out if a pension is available for you.
I know people who needed to leave the 55-plus community I’m living in now
because they found that their pensions were cut dramatically when PBGC
took over. PBGC by law guarantees a maximum monthly payout of up to
$3,971.59 for a single straight-life annuity, if you retire at age 65, but it drops
to just $1,787 if you retire early at age 55. These amounts are even lower if
you chose an annuity that protects your spouse as well. To find out more
about how PBGC works, go to www.pbgc.com.

Chapter 2: Why You May Need or Want to Go Back to Work

Losing pension benefits and getting cash
Many employers are terminating their defined-benefit plans. Between 1975
and 2004, more than 165,000 pension plans were terminated. Most of these
terminated plans involved small businesses. For more information about
changes in pension law, read Chapter 8.
Others were converted to a new type of retirement plan called a cash-balance
plan, which is a hybrid between the traditional defined-benefit plan and the
defined-contribution plan.
Over 350 large corporations switched to cash-balance plans, including
American Airlines, American Express, AT&T, BP, CBS, Chase Manhattan,
Citigroup, Duke Energy, GE, Hallmark, IBM, JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, and
Xerox, and many more are considering doing so. If you want to follow the
trend to cash-balance plans, there is an excellent Web site that monitors
them called Cash Pensions (www.cashpensions.com). If your company is
considering the conversion, you may find there are employee groups organiz-
ing to influence the decision.
Employees converted to a cash-balance plan may find that they will have a
lot less money each month in retirement. While they will get a lump sum cash
payout when they retire, whether or not they have enough money throughout
retirement will depend on how well they manage these funds.
Didn’t save enough
Even if you receive a retirement pension or lump-sum payment from your
employer’s retirement plan, you may find you still haven’t saved enough to
pay for all the things you need and want during retirement. In fact, fewer than
50 percent of workers today calculate how much they will need to retire and
develop a specific plan specifying how much they need to save to make that
goal.
More than half of the workers saving for retirement have less than $50,000
saved. How long do you think that would last? Not long if you plan an income
of $30,000 per year. How much do you need to save? That depends on so
many different factors, but the best way to figure that out is to prepare a
budget for retirement and estimate your monthly cash needs. In the next sec-
tion, “Maintaining Your Lifestyle in Retirement,” I talk about the items you
need to consider when planning your retirement budget.
Generally, you can expect to safely draw between 4 and 5 percent out of your
retirement nest egg each year, if you want to be certain that you don’t outlive
your assets. For example, if you have $300,000 in retirement savings, then at 
4 percent you could draw $12,000 per year and at 5 percent you could draw
$15,000 per year. If you get a $1,000 per month check from Social Security,
then your total income in retirement would be between $24,000 and $27,000.
24
Part 1: Getting Ready to Retire . . . Not! 

Maintaining Your Lifestyle in Retirement
The primary reason most people go back to work after retiring is the need for
additional money. While the reasons most often heard are to remain active
and to learn new things, when people who go back to work are asked to name
one reason, money is the reason for working after retirement. So if your
dream retirement does not involve working, then you need to be sure you are
saving enough money for your expected life span.
One of the best interactive tools on the Internet for calculating how much
money you need in retirement is the Ballpark E$timate (www.choosetosave.
org/ballpark/). The interactive worksheet collects information about your
current age, retirement age, salary when working, expected age at death,
inflation assumption, wage growth assumption, rate of return on your invest-
ments, pension benefits, retirement income, and retirement savings.
Budgeting for specific phases 
of retirement
When planning your budget and income needs during retirement, you need to
consider several different budgets depending on the phase of retirement you
are in. You may think now that you can supplement any needed funds by
working, but at some point you may not be able to work, so you need to plan
for that contingency as well.
Most people actually need to think of retirement in at least three different
phases, and if you retired before you could collect Social Security, then you
would need to think about budgets for four distinct phases. So review the
four phases below and calculate your budget needs for the ones you still
expect are relevant based on your age and health.
Phase 1
If you retired early before you could collect Social Security, you’re included in
Phase 1. You need to calculate financial needs without Social Security bene-
fits, plus you need to figure out how to get and pay for healthcare until you
can qualify for Medicare. In many cases, you need even more cash than you
did while working to pay for your health insurance and medical care. Health
costs drive most of the retirees in Phase 1 back to work for more money to
pay for healthcare and, in some cases, to get access to a group health plan. I
know retirees who would not need the money from working if they could get
reasonable health insurance. I talk more about health insurance in the sec-
tion, “Paying for healthcare,” below.
25
Chapter 2: Why You May Need or Want to Go Back to Work

Phase 2
Count yourself a member of Phase 2 once you’re retired, collecting Social
Security, eligible for Medicare, but still very active. You may also be getting
funds from an employer pension or drawing down funds from a retirement
portfolio. Your financial needs will be a bit less than when you were working
because you don’t need to spend as much money on clothes, travel, work
and other work expenses. Usually you can plan for a budget that is about 90
percent of the budget you had while working. Since many people end up with
a monthly income that is less than that, they go back to work to supplement
that income.
Phase 3
If you’re retired, collecting Social Security, getting medical coverage through
Medicare, but are not as active in your community, you’ve reached Phase 3.
In this phase of retirement, you don’t spend money on travel and entertain-
ment and can usually live on about 70 percent of the income you earned
while working.
Phase 4
Phase 4 includes the oldest group of retirees: you’re collecting Social Security,
are on Medicare, and likely are receiving funds from a pension or from your
retirement portfolio, but your medical costs are on the rise as you age. Once
you’ve reached this phase, you probably need about 85 percent of the income
you needed while working to cover your daily needs as well as your increased
medical expenses.
Knowing what to budget for
After you identify your phases of retirement (see the section, “Budgeting for
specific phases of retirement” earlier in this chapter), you then need to
guesstimate a budget for each one. Yes it will be a guess. No one can be
absolutely positive of what will be needed and what the future costs will be
for anything. But, you can get pretty close with some careful budgeting. Here
are some tips for what items to consider when budgeting.
Funding travel and entertainment
Travel and entertainment ends up on the list of most people’s dream retire-
ment. Whether or not they’ll be able to take those trips or participate in
entertainment activities depends upon how much cash they have each
month.
Working at least part time helps many people pay for the travel and entertain-
ment they want as part of their retirement. Many people’s retirement income
includes enough for the basics of life, but not enough for any extras. In order
26
Part 1: Getting Ready to Retire . . . Not! 

to take those trips, dine out regularly with friends, or buy tickets for enter-
tainment, many seniors go back to work.
Maintaining your home
Ideally, by the time you enter retirement, your mortgage should be paid off.
Carrying a mortgage on a fixed retirement income can be a big drain on your
budget and may be the primary reason you are forced back into the work-
force. Yet 40 percent of retirees today do still have a mortgage to pay.
In addition to the mortgage, you will need to pay for insurance, property
taxes, maintenance, and utilities. On a fixed retirement income, as these costs
rise each year they can put a greater and greater strain on your fixed income.
Many states do give seniors a reduction in property taxes, so be sure to
check with your property tax collector regarding tax benefits for seniors.
Keeping food on the table
How much money you’ll need for the food portion of your budget will depend
entirely on how you plan to make your meals. Many seniors go out to eat reg-
ularly with friends, others live by making their meals as cheaply as possible
at home. Those who do have expensive dining out habits are more likely to
work part-time to make a little extra money to pay for their dining out fun.
As you prepare your food budget, think about whether you believe you’ll eat
frugally at home or want to spend more as part of your social life and eating
out with friends. Estimating this carefully can help you determine how much
money you will have for other things on your fixed budget — like travel and
entertainment.
Remember, in retirement your income is fixed and you can’t expect to get
raises like you did while you were working. As your expenses increase, you’ll
either need to cut back on other things in your budget, you’ll need to draw
down more funds from your retirement savings, or you’ll need to go back to
work to make some extra money.
Paying for healthcare
Too often I see stories in the paper that indicate seniors are having to make
the choice between keeping food on their table and staying healthy. Once you
are old enough to get Medicare, healthcare costs will drop, but if you retired
before being eligible for Medicare, those few years may be very expensive.
Even if you are on Medicare, out-of-pocket costs can still be high because
Medicare doesn’t pay all your costs.
I know couples who do not yet qualify for Medicare and are paying over
$20,000 per year just for their medical insurance. I know others who can’t
qualify for medical insurance because of their preexisting conditions. Millions
of people who retired early in their 50s or were laid off and couldn’t find
other work are left without health coverage.
27
Chapter 2: Why You May Need or Want to Go Back to Work

If you have recently left your place of employment and health insurance is not
one of your retiree benefits, which is more and more common today, be sure to
hold on to your COBRA benefits until you can find an individual health policy.
COBRA is short for Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, which
protects your right to continuing health coverage after you leave a job. While
you must pay for the full costs for COBRA benefits, and they can be very
expensive, I can guarantee you that an individual health policy will be more
expensive than your group plan.
I talk more about the types of individual health plans available to seniors, as
well as alternatives under Medicare in Chapter 10. But, don’t forget to con-
sider healthcare costs when planning your retirement budget. Needing to pay
the ever rising costs of healthcare drives more seniors back to work than any
other expense factor.
Losing Professional Contact . . . or Just
Getting Bored
After years of getting up, rushing to work, and filling your day solving prob-
lems in your workplace, you may be finding it hard to just get up and have no
where to go. If you didn’t take the time to plan your retirement, you’re proba-
bly finding it even harder to transition from work to retirement.
You can always go back to work — many people do — but, the good news is
that if you’re bored, it’s not hard to find alternatives to work for your time,
especially if you treat looking for alternatives the same way you looked for a
solution in your workplace. Start by researching alternatives for volunteer
opportunities that need your involvement either in your neighborhood or
around your city or town. What those opportunities might be will depend on
what you enjoy doing. I talk more about volunteer opportunities in Chapter 20.
Keeping your professional network alive
For many people who have worked their entire lives, their professional lives
are dependent on the people with whom they work. Once you stop working,
you may find that while you don’t miss the daily grind, you do desperately
miss the professional contracts you had each day.
You don’t have to stop making contact with the people you worked with pro-
fessionally, but you do have to change how you see them. If you haven’t left
your workplace yet, be sure to get contact information for all the people
you’d like to stay in touch with. If you have already retired, set up a lunch
date or meet people for drinks after their work and get the contact informa-
tion you need.
28
Part 1: Getting Ready to Retire . . . Not! 

Take your newfound time and organize some fun social activities that can
include you and other professionals you worked with, whether they are still
working or not. This will help you stay in touch with your work life as you
transition to your new life outside of work.
Finding a new network of retired 
professionals
You will find it hard to fill your days with people who are still committed to
the workplace, so you also may need to find networks of retired professionals
in your area. There are a number of ways you can find new professional
friends:
 Build a strong social network by volunteering to work at your favorite
nonprofit organization. Help others or work toward solving a problem
that you care about.
 Join a club with people who enjoy doing the same activities that you
enjoy doing. Your local newspaper probably has a long list of clubs. You
can also find ideas through your church or synagogue. Another good
source for a professional club near you could be the national profes-
sional organization you participated in while working. It’s possible that
there are local groups not connected to your old workplace through
which like-minded professionals meet.
 Get involved in community service. You can remain connected with all
types of professionals doing work to help your community.
 Make your hobby your profession. Join a group that also enjoys doing
the same hobby you enjoy. It’s a great way to meet new people and build
a new social network.
 Don’t forget to rebuild your relationships with your spouse and other
family members. If you’ve been working full-time and now finally have
the time you want in retirement, take the time to renew your relation-
ship with your family.
I talk more about volunteer opportunities for retirees in Chapter 20.
Going back to school
Another way to keep your mind active and remain involved professionally is
to go back to school. You can do this to further your professional knowledge
or to learn something entirely new.
29
Chapter 2: Why You May Need or Want to Go Back to Work

Many seniors have decided to go back to school to avoid getting bored, so
you won’t be the only older person in the classroom. In fact, in Chapter 19, I
discuss opportunities around the world for retirees who want to continue to
learn.
Teaching others in your field
Some of you might enjoy teaching, and many retirees do teach. Cities and
counties around the country are begging for teachers. Many have certifica-
tion programs that they sponsor for people who don’t have a teaching certifi-
cation, but want to teach.
There is a shortage of teachers in most fields, and you will probably find it
relatively easy to find openings if teaching is how you want to fill your day.
You can teach children in public school settings or you can teach classes
through your professional organization. Many technical schools and commu-
nity colleges also are constantly looking for professionals who can teach
courses.
While committing to a full-time, public-school teaching job may not be what
you’re looking for in retirement, teaching periodic courses through a private
school, community college, a technical college, or your professional organiza-
tion might be just what you need.

Assessing Your Talents 
for Your Next Job
In This Chapter
 Exploring strengths and weaknesses
 Finding your likes and dislikes
 Discovering your worker type
 Gauging your interests
 Cornering your creativity
S
o what do you want to do next? After retiring, most people are ready for
a complete job change — doing anything but what they did before.
Others don’t want to step out of their comfort zone.
Before you can decide what to do next, you must take stock on what you like
and don’t like to do, as well as assess your talents, to help figure out what
your next job should be. In this chapter, I discuss the types of self-exploration
you can do to help you determine what your next job might be.
Determining Your Strengths 
and Weaknesses
One of the hardest things for most people is to admit that they have some
weaknesses. Well get over it. If you have a hard time admitting to weaknesses
now is not the time for pride. You certainly don’t want to pick a job after
retirement at which you’ll constantly be struggling to keep up.

You don’t have anything to prove. You’ve already had one successful career.
Most likely if you’re going back to work now you’re doing it to help make
financial ends meet or to get in on a group health insurance plan. You’re not
at the beginning of your career when you needed to prove yourself.
Take some time to think about your strengths and weaknesses — write them
down if you want to. What is it that you are really good at doing? If you enjoy
doing that, it’s even better. In retirement, you certainly don’t want to be doing
something that makes it hard to get up in the morning and get out of the
house. Your aches and pains will already be making it hard to get out of bed.
If you can find a job that builds on your strengths and doesn’t depend on
things at which you feel you are weak, it will be much easier to show up at
the workplace every day. So make a list of all your strengths and weaknesses
and seek work that helps you build on your strengths.
Assessing Your Last Job
One of the best ways to figure out what you want to do next is to look at what
you liked best at your previous job or jobs. Also, consider what you liked to 
do least. For example, I’m sure most of you hated filing (I know that’s my least
favorite thing to do), but some of you might really enjoy getting things orga-
nized for someone else. Boy — if that’s the case — I could sure use a volunteer.
Make a list of all the things that you really enjoyed doing at work. It doesn’t
have to be things that were even part of your job. For example, if you really
enjoyed helping others work out their personal finances, then a good job
after retirement might be something in the financial industry. Or if you
enjoyed helping people decide on decorations for their homes, maybe you
would enjoy working as an interior decorator. Or maybe you’d like to work
for a new homes builder in his decorator department helping people who just
purchased a new home make color choices or pick other items for their new
home’s interior.
You need to take stock of what you enjoyed doing through most of your career
and what you really hated doing. Definitely avoid taking a job in retirement
that will require you to do most of the things you hated doing. I can guarantee
that it will be much more difficult to go to work if you hate being there. Once
you’ve retired, other pressures, such as being with friends and family or going
out to play a round of golf, will be getting in the way of going to work. So, it’s
best to find something that you look forward to doing each day.

Part I: Getting Ready to Retire . . . Not! 

Uncovering Your Worker Type
One helpful tool to assist you with deciding what to do next is to discover your
worker type. In Chapter 4, I introduce you to some formal self-assessment tests
you can take on the Internet or through a professional counselor to assist you
with self-assessment.
In this section, I introduce you to a quick quiz to help you sort out the type of
worker and work that might fit you the best. Hopefully this will help you iden-
tify your strengths and lead you to a job that you truly will enjoy doing.
Determining your working type
Quickly circle eight words or phrases in the list in Table 3-1 that best fit your
image of yourself. Don’t spend a lot of time choosing. This works best when
you pick the words quickly. If you want this to mean something, don’t cheat
by looking at the explanations of the values below.

You will most likely have one dominant value of three or more and several 
of one or two. The dominant value matches your strongest worker type, 
but the other values also influence what you like to do — the next section,
“Understanding your worker type,” explains how your specific worker types
can influence the kind of job you may enjoy.

Part I: Getting Ready to Retire . . . Not! 

Understanding your worker type
So, what do the values in Table 3-1 mean? First let me tell you what the values
stand for:
A = Artistic (also known as Creators)
C = Conventional (also known as Organizers)
E = Enterprising (also known as Persuaders)
I = Investigative (also known as Thinkers)
R = Realistic (also known as Doers)
S = Social (also known as Helpers)
In the following sections, I discuss each worker type individually, exploring
each type’s strengths and what each type likes to do including favorite hob-
bies. Then I give you some examples of possible job choices that fit each type
to get you to starting thinking about what type of job you might like to do.
Use this information to help you sort out the type of job you want to do next.
You probably found that you actually fit into several worker type categories,
but one more strongly than others. You certainly can mix and match the skill
sets to discover what you might look for and enjoy if you go back to work.
Artistic (creators)
The skills in which Artistic people excel include drawing; painting; playing a
musical instrument; writing stories, poetry, or music; singing; acting; dancing;
or fashion or interior designing. For fun they most enjoy attending concerts;
going to the theater; visiting art exhibits; reading fiction, plays, or poetry;
working on crafts; taking photographs; and expressing themselves in other
creative ways. They also excel at dealing with ambiguous ideas.
If your worker type is Artistic, your might be able to turn your hobbies into
your own business for profit. The type of Artistic hobbies that have success-
fully been turned into small businesses include photography, writing, desk-
top publishing, sewing, homemade crafts, painting, designing sets for plays,
or speaking a foreign language. Other hobbies you might enjoy but probably
won’t help you make any extra money include taking dance lessons, playing a
musical instrument, or traveling.
With these skills, you may be able to find paying jobs as a copywriter, drama or
English teacher, graphic or interior designer, writer, photographer, or editor.

Chapter 3: Assessing Your Talents for Your Next Job

Conventional (organizers)
Conventional worker types work well within a system and can do a lot of
paperwork in a short time. If you’re a Conventional worker type, you also
probably excel at keeping accurate records, using a computer terminal, and
writing effective business letters. You probably prefer following clearly
defined processes, enjoy using data-processing equipment, like working with
numbers, excel at keeping track of details, and enjoy collecting or organizing.
Your hobbies might include collecting memorabilia, playing computer or card
games, keeping club or family records and files, reading home magazines, and
writing your family history. None of these translate easily into a small busi-
ness, but your organizational skills can certainly be used to start one that
assists other small businesses with record keeping, bookkeeping, or other
organizational needs.
With these skills (and possibly a few courses in accounting) you could get
work as an accountant or bookkeeper. You may also enjoy working as a
cashier, librarian, bank teller, clerk, or data-processing worker.
Enterprising (persuaders)
Enterprising worker types like to initiate projects and convince people to do
things their way. If this is your worker type, you likely enjoy selling things or
promoting ideas. You also enjoy giving speeches or leading a group. You
probably like to organize activities amongst your friends and persuade others
to join you.
You particularly enjoy wining a leadership or sales award, being elected to
office, or having power or status. You would likely enjoy starting your own
business or campaigning for someone else in a political campaign. Your hob-
bies might include discussing politics, reading business journals, watching
the stock market, attending meetings and conferences, and leading commu-
nity organizations.
With these skills you might want to consider looking for work as a financial
planner, bartender, interpreter, manufacturer’s representative, salesperson,
public relations representative, real estate agent, or travel agent.
Investigative (thinkers)
Investigative worker types excel at thinking abstractly, solving mathematical
problems, or understanding scientific theories. If this is your worker type,
you probably enjoy doing complex calculations, using a microscope or com-
puter, and interpreting formulas. You like to work independently, using com-
puters or working in a lab doing experiments.
You probably like to read scientific or technical journals, analyze data, and 
do research to challenge your intellect. Your hobbies might include joining 
36
Part I: Getting Ready to Retire . . . Not! 

a book club, studying astronomy, doing crossword puzzles, and collecting
things (such as rocks, stamps, or coins). You may enjoy operating an amateur
radio or flying recreationally. You also might enjoy getting involved in conser-
vation efforts or working to save an endangered species.
With these skills the types of work you might want to consider include tech-
nical writer, science teacher, management consultant, medical lab technolo-
gist, or research analyst. If your computer skills are strong, you may also
want to look for work in this area.
Realistic (doers)
Realistic worker types like to fix things. If this is your worker type, you proba-
bly enjoy solving electrical problems, reading a blueprint, or operating tools
and machinery. For fun you might like to go camping and pitch a tent or you
might like to play sports games or maybe even plant a garden.
Realistic worker types usually like to work outdoors and work with their
hands. They enjoy being physically active and building things.
Hobbies for Realistic worker types might include refinishing furniture, growing
plants and flowers, hunting and fishing, playing sports, woodworking, coaching
team sports, building models, repairing cars or other equipment, target shoot-
ing, and landscaping. Most of these hobbies could be a good way to make a
little extra money doing things for others who are not as good with their hands.
In retirement, depending on what you enjoy doing most, you may want to
take a job or start your own business as an automobile mechanic,
groundskeeper, painter, carpenter, electrician, or plumber.
Social (helpers)
Social worker types enjoy teaching or training others. If you are a Social
worker type, you likely can express yourself clearly and break things down
into smaller pieces to make it easier for other people to learn. You usually
enjoy leading a group discussion and possibly even mediating a dispute. You
work well with others and enjoy planning or supervising activities.
You like to help people solve their problems, participate in meetings, or do
volunteer work. You like to work with young people and help others. Your
hobbies likely include volunteering in social action groups, joining commu-
nity organizations, and helping others with personal concerns. You also prob-
ably enjoy caring for children. You like to meet new friends, go to parties, and
play team sports or attend sporting events. You’re also likely to be active in a
religious organization.
In retirement, you may want to consider jobs as a teacher, retirement counselor,
school counselor, librarian, real estate appraiser, social worker, or mediator.

Chapter 3: Assessing Your Talents for Your Next Job

Using How You Like to Work 
to Find the Ideal Job
Some people enjoy working totally by themselves while others prefer working
within teams. Also, some people need a lot of direction, while others prefer 
to work without a supervisor looking over them all the time. How you like to
work also influences what kind of job you may enjoy most. In the next sec-
tions, I explore different ways people work and the types of jobs that best fit
those working ways.
Working autonomously
If your preference is to work autonomously, you need to find a job that will
allow you to work by yourself without much supervision. Otherwise you will
be spending most of your day resenting your supervisor.
You likely won’t last long at a job that requires you be supervised regularly,
either you’ll quit or get fired, so avoid accepting that type of job. Be sure to
talk about your preference to work autonomously during your interview.
If this creates a problem during the interview, it’s best that you don’t get 
the job. You would probably butt heads with someone who prefers to keep 
a tight reign on his or her staff. Your best bet is to move on and look for
something else.
Needing direction
If you like the type of job where you’re given lots of direction and don’t need
to make decisions, then you should look for a job in which the supervisor
prefers to be in control and give you direction.
Many people in retirement actually prefer not having the responsibilities of
being the boss, but instead just enjoy being out among people. You might
enjoy taking direction and not having to make decisions. This might be just
the right match for you in retirement, especially if you’ve been making deci-
sions all your work life and are burned out.
You may find that when you get into your job you don’t enjoy taking direction.
Often, retirees take a job that requires them to accept direction, and they find
that the younger people giving the directions keep making the wrong deci-
sions. It can be frustrating. If that happens to you, you might have to rethink
your job choice and find something else.
38
Part I: Getting Ready to Retire . . . Not! 

Working in teams
Some people really enjoy working in teams rather than alone. If that is your
preference, you need to find a job that encourages teamwork. In today’s
world that is probably the most common theme for most businesses, so you
shouldn’t have a hard time finding a job where teamwork is the norm.
Applying Your Skill Sets
You may be wondering if you have all the skills for a particular kind of job —
or perhaps you’re wondering what skills are even needed for a particular job.
In the next sections I give you a couple of options for figuring out your skill
sets and applying them to your job search.
One of the best ways to research skill sets is to use a tool online at America’s
Career InfoNet. You may also pass this information on to your grandchildren
if any of them are having a hard time figuring out what they want to do. If
you’re not Internet savvy, ask a friend or family member to help you explore
this site. It’s well worth the time if you’re not sure what you want to do next.
To use the career skills profiler, go to www.acinet.org/acinet/skills.
Using the tool, you can get a comprehensive list of the skills you need for just
about any job. You can start the search in one of three ways — by browsing
job families, searching by keyword, or searching by skills you have. The type
of search you do depends if you:
 Know that you want to work in a particular field, but aren’t sure
exactly what you want to do in that field: You can find a job type by
searching job families. For example, if you know you’d like to work in
healthcare, but are not sure what type of job you want, then you would
start the Skills Profiler by selecting the “Menu Search” button.
 Know exactly what you want to do, but want to know more details
about the skills needed or the work activities involved in a particular
job choice: You can start the process by doing a “Keyword Search” for
the job or jobs that interest you. As you start typing the job, choices will
pop up on the screen. Pick the one that comes closest to the type of job
you want to consider. You will then get a comprehensive list of the skills
you need. The rest of the process is similar to the one discussed above
for the search by job families.
39
Chapter 3: Assessing Your Talents for Your Next Job

 Have absolutely no idea what you want to do, but instead prefer to
start out by doing a skills inventory: You should choose the “Search
without an Occupation” option. After you get to the skills profile and you
see the list of occupations that match your profile, you will then be able
to click on any occupation listed to find a comprehensive overview of
the particular occupation on a state by state basis. This overview will
include wages that can be expected, job trends nationwide and in your
state, a list of the most important knowledge, skills and abilities for the
occupation you’ve chosen, the education and training you need, and any
related occupation profiles.
Carving Out Your Creative Talents
If you want to go back to work after retirement, the most important thing to
help you get out of the house each day is trying to find a job that lets you do
something you truly enjoy. Working in a job that allows you to draw on your
creative talents might be the best answer for finding a job that you love.
So what are your creative talents? Do you like to write, paint, draw, do pho-
tography, work with plants, do home crafts, or anything else that sparks your
creative bug?
If so, you may be wondering how you can turn your creative ideas into a way
to make the extra money you need. One of the best ways to get started is by
networking (I discuss networking in-depth in Chapter 4). You can network at
art fairs, by introducing yourself to others who own businesses with a cre-
ative element similar to your talent, or by joining an online community.
Through networking, you can find people with the same creative talents who
have found a way to make money with their craft. They may give you tips and
suggestions and may even let you help out with their current business. You
just never know until you ask!

Chapter 4
Seeking Help to Determine What
You’d Like to Do Next
In This Chapter
 Talking with a counselor
 Testing yourself
 Building a network
 Seeking support
You’re finally free from the rat race. You know you’d like to do something
else, but aren’t sure what that is. You don’t have to figure that out alone.
There are numerous services out there you can tap into — counseling, test-
ing, networks, and support groups. This chapter will review the resources
available for helping you to decide what to do next.
Talking with Someone One on One
You may have discussed your retirement plans with your family and friends
numerous times, but can’t seem to decide what to do next. Sometimes you
need to find a dispassionate third party that can help you sort out your
choices and dig into your psyche to help you find what’s best for you.
Seeing the need for a career counselor
You might think that you are a little too old to work with a career counselor,
but you’re not. People are living 20 years or more in retirement. You’ve got
lots of time, and you need to figure out something that best suits you at this
point in your life. Today, career counseling involves much more than just fig-
uring out what you want to do when you get out of school. Career counselors
frequently work with older adults to sort out career- and life-planning issues.

Don’t be concerned if you seem as undecided as you were when you first
graduated high school or entered college. You are entering an entirely new
phase of life and it’s not unusual to need a little help.
You’re facing an entirely new path:
 When you were younger you were on a career path. Now you need to
take the time to plan a path that fits your personal values, interests,
likes, dislikes, and skill levels at this phase of your life. I’m sure you’re
finding that these values, interests, likes, and dislikes are much different
than they were when you were 20.
 If you worked all your life, you probably clocked in at work at least 2,100
hours annually (and with overtime even more). Now you have all that
extra time you need to fill and you probably don’t want to fill it with
another highly stressful and demanding job, but you do want to work
whether for money, health insurance, or just to stay intellectually active.
 You had a set daily routine while you were working. Now you’ve got to
figure out an entirely new routine.
 You always had to meet deadlines while working. Now you only need to
meet them if you set them yourself.
 Your schedule was set by your job requirements. Now you get to set
your own schedule.
 You had to be accountable to your boss, and even if you were a boss,
you had to be accountable to your business. Now you’re only account-
able to yourself.
 Your social circle was likely dominated by your colleagues. Now you
need to find an entirely new social circle.
These changes are huge for anyone, and getting help from a professional can
make this transition much easier for you, as well as help you make the right
choices that will lead to an enjoyable retirement with work you enjoy that fits
your personality.
Finding a career counselor
So, how do you go about looking for a career counselor? One of the best ways
to find a good counselor is to seek references from friends, associates, or
possibly the human resources staff at your company. If you don’t know
anyone who can recommend someone, a good place to start is the National
Board of Certified Counselors (www.nbcc.org/counselorfind2). There
you can find counselors with a specialty in aging.
42
Part I: Getting Ready to Retire . . . Not! 

After you do find a number of counselors, choose the one that is right for 
you by:
 Examining the counselors’ backgrounds
 Making sure you connect with the counselor
 Requesting referrals
 Asking the counselors about:
• Credentials: Career counselors don’t have to be licensed in most
states, so anyone who is self-trained can hang out a shingle. Ask
where the counselor trained, whether he has an advanced degree
in psychology or social work, and whether he’s sought certification
from a professional group, such as the National Board of Certified
Counselors or the National Career Development Association.
• Clientele: Ask the counselor what type of clients he specializes in,
such as those beginning careers or transitioning to retirement. You
definitely want to find a counselor who works with clientele near
your age group.
• Testing: Ask what type of testing is used as part of the process.
Does he assess career change and transferable skills? Does he 
provide an interpretation of test results?
43
Chapter 4: Seeking Help to Determine What You’d Like to Do Next
Retirees redefining space
“As people approach retirement, they must
redefine their space,” says Martha Russell of
Russell Career Services and former president of
the National Career Development Association.
She says this redefinition affects three key
areas — your role, your physical space, and the
impact caregiving has on your life.
 Your role as a person is changing, especially
the role you may play as a parent and grand-
parent. When you stop working full-time, you
will have more time for your role as a parent
and grandparent. Many people, especially
men who’ve had demanding jobs, want to be
there for their grandchildren in a way they
couldn’t be available for their kids.
 Your physical space will change — even
more dramatically if you plan to relocate to
a retirement community. You must decide
how to redefine the people around you and
build a new social network — choosing
new friends and changing how you interact
with the family.
 Caregiving can have a major impact on
careers and retirement plans — especially
caring for elderly family members. This
becomes a value issue — balancing around
family, work, and social obligations.

• Scope: Ask about the scope of your counselor. Can he help you not
only with decisions related to your job choice, but also how that
choice impacts this period of change, such as any personal barri-
ers, family roles, and changing values? For example, in the past,
career advancement may have been your priority, but now your
role as grandparent and the time you can spend with family may 
be more important.
• Outcomes: Ask how the counselor can help you discover your next
steps. What can you expect will be the outcome of your work with
the counselor?
Be sure you ask the counselors you are considering for a detailed explanation 
of their services. Make sure you understand the services being offered, their
expectations about your degree of involvement, and your financial commitment.
When you choose a professional, be sure to pick one that understands your
career is a part of your life, so he will carefully consider your values as you
start your next life adventure as you enter your retirement years. You want a
counselor that can help put your decision-making process in perspective —
considering all your life choices, not just those related to work.
Determining what to talk about
After you’ve found the right person, you’re probably wondering what you
should talk about and how the process works. Many counselors start by
giving you a series of assessment tests, while others prefer to talk with you
once or twice to get to know you before testing.
Your career counselor likely will do one or more of the following:
 Invite you to participate in individual and group counseling sessions to
help you clarify your life and career goals.
 Help you identify your options by administering and interpreting tests
and inventories to assess your abilities, interests, values, and personality.
 Encourage you to explore your options through activities and planning
experiences.
 Help you improve your decision-making skills.
 Assist you in developing your career plans while in retirement.
 Help you relearn job-hunting strategies (you probably haven’t looked for
a job in a long time) and assist with the development of a resume.
 Help you understand how to integrate whatever type of work you
choose with your other changing life roles.
 Provide support as you experience the stress of transitioning from your
previous work to what you will do for the rest of your life in retirement.
44
Part I: Getting Ready to Retire . . . Not! 

Before your appointment with a counselor, think about what types of help
you want so you’ll be able to work with your counselor effectively to find out
what’s best for you.
Testing Your Values, Interests,
Personality, and Skills
You probably have taken career tests before when you were trying to figure
out what you wanted to do for the rest of your life, while you were in high
school or college. You’re also probably wondering why you should take any
more now. You will find you answer the questions on these tests differently at
different points of your life, depending on the type of decisions you are trying
to make and how these decisions will impact your life planning.
First, let me say that you shouldn’t think of these as tests, but more as tools
for helping you to make a decision. Don’t expect these tests to find the perfect
job for you or to map out your next steps. These tools will help you explore
yourself. They will give you an opportunity to look at yourself in a type of
intellectual mirror and help you determine what you might want to do next.
You will find tests that focus on several specific areas — your values, your
interests, your personality, and your skills. I explore tests you can take for
free or for a small fee on the Internet in each of these areas. If you do seek
professional counseling, your counselor may give you similar tests as part 
of the counseling process. You can find the most current set of links for 
tests on the Internet on my Web site, “Working After Retirement” (www.
workingafterretirement.info).
Exploring your values
You explore your values by taking value inventories that measure what moti-
vates you and how important different values are to you. These can include
autonomy, flexible work schedule, helping others, interpersonal relations,
leisure time, outdoor work, prestige, salary, and security. You may find it 
hard to make a list of what you like and don’t like from past work experi-
ences. Value inventories can help you determine that. Here are three good
ones available on the Internet:
 The Value Questionnaire
(www.mrs.umn.edu/services/career/career_planning/
valquestion.php): This questionnaire from the University of
Minnesota helps you explore the things most important to you 
right now.
45
Chapter 4: Seeking Help to Determine What You’d Like to Do Next

 Prioritizing Work Values Exercise
(www.mrs.umn.edu/services/career/career_planning/
workvalues2.php): Also from the University of Minnesota, this exer-
cise, like the Value Questionnaire (see bullet above) assists you with
exploring the things most important to you at this point of your life.
 Soul Survival (www.career-intelligence.com/assessment/
career_values.html): From the Career-Intelligence Web site, this
assessment first explains the importance of determining your values and
then includes an accompanying exercise to help you do just that. You do
have to join the Web site to use its tools, but there is no fee to join. You’ll
find lots of useful resources on this site.
 Work Related Values Assessment (www.nwc.edu/career/planning/
phase1/workvalues.htm): Developed by the U.S. Department of
Labor and found online at Northwestern College Career Development
Center, this worksheet defines each of the core work values. Armed with
this information, you are then asked to pick your three most important
values.
Determining your interests
Narrowing down your interests can be a hard thing to do, or you may even
find it difficult to list your interests. Interest inventories help you figure out
your interests by asking questions regarding what activities you like to do
and what activities you don’t like to do. By determining these likes and dis-
likes, you can get some help in finding work that you might enjoy doing.
Career interest inventories are not free on the Internet. If you’re sure you
know what you like and don’t like to do, you probably don’t need to take
them at this point. But, if you are curious to explore your interests, here 
are three good interest inventories that you can use for a small fee on the
Internet:
 The Campbell Interest and Skill Survey used to be available only to
career counselors, but is now available on the Internet for an $18 fee. 
It was developed by internationally recognized career expert, David
Campbell and is published by NCS Pearson. This is a 320-question
survey and your results will be compared to people who are success-
fully employed in the fields you’re interested in. You can access the test
online at U.S. News and World Report (www.usnews.com/usnews/
edu/careers/ccciss.htm).
 The Career Key (www.careerkey.org) helps you match your interests
and skills. You can take the test for a fee of $7.95. In addition to learning
more about yourself, you’ll get information about jobs that match your
personality.
46
Part I: Getting Ready to Retire . . . Not! 

 Self-Directed Search (www.self-directed-search.com) is an inter-
est and skills assessment that is popular among career counselors. You
can take this 15-minute test on the Internet for $9.95. Your report will
appear on the screen once you’ve paid for the assessment. Before taking
the test, you can quickly review the format online, including questions
about your likes and dislikes of various activities, your competencies,
your occupations, as well as a self-assessment of your abilities.
Taking personality tests
You’ll find that many personality inventories are based on the theories of 
psychologist Carl Jung. He believed there were eight personality types —
extroverts, introverts, thinking, feeling, sensing, intuitive, judging, and per-
ceptive. Basically what these inventories do is sort out the ways people
prefer to take in information and make decisions. These assessments also
look at how you get your energy — from the outside world or your inner 
self. Finally, these inventories assess whether you are the type of person 
who likes to find closure or a person who prefers to keep options open.
You won’t be able to find these tests for free either. In fact, the most
respected personality test — the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)
requires that you pay for the interpretive assistance of a certified MBTI 
practitioner. How much you pay will be determined by the type of test you
take (online or on paper) and the amount of counseling time involved. You
can find sources for the test online at Career-Intelligence.com.
I don’t recommend you seek to take the MBTI on the Internet. If you do think
you need this extensive personality profiler, then your best bet is to work
with a professional counselor, since you’ll need to have the results inter-
preted by a professional, and the results are more meaningful if done by
someone who knows you.
But, if you are thinking of opening your own business, Career Intelligence offers
a good package that includes the MBTI and the Strong Interest Inventory with 
a focus on whether you would do well opening your own business. This assess-
ment package will help you determine whether your personality and your 
interests fit the role of a small business owner. Interpretive counseling is 
also included in this package, which is called “Strong and MBTI Entrepreneur
Report” (www.career-intelligence.com/assessment/Entrepreneur.
asp). The fee for the package is $149.
One test you can take on the Internet that is similar to the MBTI, but much
cheaper, is the Keirsey Temperament Sorter (www.advisorteam.com/
temperament_sorter), which is used by corporations, professional coun-
selors, and major universities. It’s a simple test to take and you can complete
it quickly online. After answering the 70 questions in this test, you’ll get
47
Chapter 4: Seeking Help to Determine What You’d Like to Do Next

insights into your temperament, personality types, and motivations. You can
get an initial temperament analysis for free and a more detailed analysis of
your personality types and motivations for $14.95.
Taking skills assessments
You may have a hard time listing all your skills. Many people overlook all the
things they’ve learned over a lifetime of work. Don’t despair, there are a number
of skill profilers that can help you put together a list of your skills. Here are
three good Web sites you can use for free to construct your skill profile:
 Career InfoNet Skills Profiler (www.acinet.org/acinet/skills) is
an excellent tool that helps you not only to get a comprehensive list of
your skills, but also helps you find career options that match those
skills. I talk more about how to use this tool in Chapter 3.
 Career-Intelligence.com offers an excellent article about how to
develop your career skill set and a worksheet to help you do just that.
You can access the article at www.career-intelligence.com/
assessment/career_skillset.asp and the worksheet at www.
career-intelligence.com/assessment/career_skillset_
worksheet.asp. You will have to register for the site, but registration 
is free.
 Lifework Transitions.com (www.lifeworktransitions.com/
exercises/exercs.html) provides a series of exercises to help 
you sort out your skills. You’ll find several different skill surveys you 
can complete.
Networking with others
I’m sure you’ve heard the phrase, “It’s not what you know, but who you
know.” That’s so true, and it becomes even more important when you’re
trying to get around the hidden myths that make it difficult for you to get a
job as you get older. I talk more about these myths in Chapter 13.
Building a strong network can be your best defense at any time of your
career, but even more critical when trying to go back to work after retire-
ment. A network helps people to share information about openings not nec-
essarily advertised on the job market. Your network may also help introduce
you to the person who is doing the hiring. In addition to building a core
group of people who can assist you in finding a job, you’re also building 
a group of people who can support you emotionally as well.
48
Part I: Getting Ready to Retire . . . Not! 

In order to build an effective network, you should use both formal and infor-
mal networks you already have in place. Formal networks include those you
actually join and pay dues to, such as professional associations, alumni
groups, or clubs such as the Lion’s Club. Informal networks include people
you think of as friends from work, your religious organization, or other social
situations.
How to build your network
You can build an effective network if you follow these six steps:
1. Plan your network. First you must write out your goals for your net-
work. Think about what you want to achieve by forming this network.
Do you want to learn information about potential jobs, get ideas for how
to improve yourself, learn about new developments in your field, dis-
cover training opportunities, or seek emotional support? Most likely you
want to do a combination of these options. You also want to think about
how you might help the people in your network. Networks are about
sharing. So you should think about what you have to offer to the mem-
bers of your potential network as well.
2. Build your contacts. Start by writing down the types of people you want
in your network. This can include their background, position, personal-
ity traits, leisure interests, and values. Then make a list of people who
you already know that you want in your network. Next make a list of
people you’d like to have in your network, but don’t know yet. Decide
how you will contact your potential network members — by phone,
e-mail, chat rooms, online discussion groups, or meeting them in person.
You probably will use a mix of these options.
3. Conduct information interviews. This is a great way to find out about
types of jobs, as well as make contact with people who you would like in
your network but don’t know well. Before even going on the interview,
learn all you can about the type of work you are considering. Develop a
list of people you do know who might help you make the contacts you
want to make. If you don’t know the person, the best way to contact
them first is with a brief personal note that talks about what you want to
learn and asks for an appointment. Tell them you’ll follow up by tele-
phone in a few days. Then call to set the appointment. Make it clear that
you’re not seeking a specific job, but want to learn more information
about the job opportunities in their industry. People do enjoy talking
about themselves and their work. Be sure to ask open-ended questions
and listen carefully. Don’t overstay your welcome. As you finish the
interview, ask for recommendations of others you can talk to for more
information. Be sure you write a thank you note and mention a key piece
of information you learned from the interview.

Chapter 4: Seeking Help to Determine What You’d Like to Do Next

4. Organize your network. Once you’ve pulled together all your names,
you need to organize them. Figure out how the information you’ve col-
lected will be helpful to you. One good tool to use is Microsoft Outlook.
There you can put each person’s contact information and any specific
notes you may have about their background and your contact with
them. You can use the Outlook calendar to set up contact reminders you
may want to track. You can set up category lists and periodically plan to
send out e-mails to members in your network based on the categories
you’ve developed. You can then keep track of your individual contacts
with each of them in their individual contact record in Outlook.
5. Take action. Set up a plan for contacting your network. For example,
you can plan to make one cold call (a call to someone you’d like in your
network but don’t know — possibly to set up an information interview),
meet someone for lunch, and reconnect with two others in your network
each week. Make notes in the individual records for each person you
contact, including the key information you discussed during the contact,
so you’ll have the information for follow-up contact later.
6. Continue to build your network. Your network is something that will
never be complete. You should always be looking for people to add to
your network and expand your horizons.
You’ll be surprised how quickly you can build an effective network that will
help you not only find a job after retirement, but will also help build an active
social network outside of work. One of the hardest things for most retirees is
the loss of professional contacts. You can avoid this feeling of loss by proac-
tively building your network even before you retire.
Online job networks for seniors
You’ll find online networks for people over 55 that are looking for jobs pop-
ping up all over the Internet. Seniors can log onto these sites and find work,
primarily consulting work but also some salaried jobs. Most of these sites
focus on specific areas, such as finance, engineering, or biotechnology and
some of them were even started by companies seeking to reconnect with
retired workers. Here are four of the top sites you can find on the Internet:
 YourEncore.com (www.yourencore.com): Eli Lilly and Company and
Proctor & Gamble started this site in 2003 to reconnect with retirees
from these two companies. By 2006, the site is flourishing and assists
older job seekers with positions in member and nonmember companies.
The members seek older professionals who were scientists, engineers,
or product developers during their careers before retirement. The jobs
50
Part I: Getting Ready to Retire . . . Not! 

posted are primarily short-term projects designed to solve specific prob-
lems. Boeing, National Starch, 3M Co., and Ethicon Endo-Surgery joined
the founders as member companies. YourEncore.com hires the job seek-
ers as contractors because many corporations have pensions that are
set up that do not legally allow the corporation to hire someone already
drawing a pension from that company, even on a contract basis.
 Seniors4Hire (www.seniors4hire.org): Seniors4Hire started by acci-
dent in 2003. Forward Group actually intended to start a site for teens look-
ing for jobs called Teens4Hire, which does still exist on the Internet, but
found that many employers were interested in hiring older adults. They
didn’t believe teens had the right attitude. Three companies that are now
members of the site urged the Forward Group to develop Seniors4Hire —
Bank of America, RadioShack Corp., and Regal Entertainment Group. You
can join the site for free as long as you are at least 50 years old. In 2006, the
site had over 200,000 job seekers age 50 or older and more than 550
employers that post jobs. Industry groups that post on the site include
financial services, retail, telecommunications, and healthcare.
 Employment Network for Retired Government Experts
(www.enrge.us): This site focuses on building a job network for former
U.S. government workers who want to try working in the private sector.
The founder Jay Zavala is a Vietnam-era veteran and retired government
professional. In addition to running this site, he owns his own business
consulting firm, Zavala, Inc., based in Massachusetts. He created this 
network for men and women who dedicated their careers to government
service and want to remain productive in their professions or fields of
expertise after retirement. Only retired federal, state, or local government
employees or government employees within 12 months of a scheduled
retirement can use this free service. Government contractors, entrepre-
neurs, venture capitalists, human resource managers, investors, inven-
tors, industrialists, small, large, and emerging business owners, and other
employers use this site’s database of candidates. Jobs offered through
this site tend to be contract-based, but some are full- or part-time.
Employers pay $1,000 to access the database for an 18-month period.
 SeniorJobBank (www.seniorjobbank.org): This is the older of the
senior job-networking sites on the Internet. It was started in 1999, but
didn’t really take off until the NHC Group of Massachusetts relaunched it
in 2005. You’ll find about 200 jobs available each day and listings are on
a state-by-state basis. Anyone over the age of 50 can use the site for free.
Employers pay $89 per job posting. You’ll find jobs ranging from entry
level to senior executive.

Joining a Support Group
As you sort out all the changes you’re facing moving from a full-time career to
retirement, you may find that you need support from others who face similar
challenges. While your family and friends may be there for support, some-
times only someone else experiencing the same life changes can really offer
the type of support you need.
Support groups provide mutual aid and support for people who share the
same quandary. A good support group can be a place where you can find
accurate and current information to help you make informed choices, as 
well as provide emotional support for the changes you are going through.
Support group successes have been shown over and over again in the med-
ical field. People who participate in support groups for a particular disease
from which they are recovering usually show faster improvement than those
who do not participate.
Support groups can communicate through newsletters, meetings, or discus-
sion forums on the Internet. Moral support from a group can be very helpful
when struggling with a lifestyle change. They can help you improve and pro-
mote coping skills and reduce the stress associated with the change. Change
isn’t easy, and knowing there are others out there struggling with the same
life stresses makes it easier to cope. You won’t feel so alone trying to handle
the stresses that come with this major life change. I can guarantee that
moving from full-time work to retirement is a major life change, probably 
one of the most major changes you still have to face.
Uncovering how support groups work
Support groups work a bit differently depending on the method of communi-
cation chosen for the group. I participated in or ran groups using each of the
three common methods — newsletters, meetings, and discussion forums.
Newsletter support groups
Newsletter support groups are primarily for information sharing. You won’t
get much individual support from this type of support group. But, if you are
the type of person who just wants a place to share information and aren’t
comfortable talking with a group of strangers, this might be your best choice.
You also may find that the newsletter support group provides information
you can share with another type of support group — meetings or discussion
forums.
52
Part I: Getting Ready to Retire . . . Not! 

Meeting support groups
Meeting support groups set a specific meeting time — usually once a week,
once every two weeks, or once a month. People share issues related to the topic
of the group and help each other sort through the issues. It’s important to have
some strict rules in this type of support group. In ones that I’ve run in the past,
I’ve always insisted that people agree to these rules before participating:
 Anything said in the room stays in the room. People must feel secure
that they can open up regarding private issues and that these private
issues will not be discussed outside the room.
 People should not respond by telling someone they are wrong, but
instead discuss how they might handle a situation in a better way.
If people are critical of each other, groups will tend to break down as
people become more and more afraid to speak up and clam up to avoid
criticism. The environment must be supportive and helpful, not destruc-
tive and critical.
 Set a time limit for each person to speak initially, so everyone gets a
chance to participate. You don’t want someone dominating the group
and not giving others time to discuss issues critical for them.
The leader of the group should maintain the rules set by the group, but should
not impose so much structure that the group becomes stifled. The leader usu-
ally gathers information about issues discussed that can be shared in the next
meeting or asks someone else to do the research on a particular issue.
Discussion forum support groups
These forums usually are managed by professional associations for their
members, but you can also find them on the Internet in places like Delphi
Forums (www.delphiforums.com), which are member-managed communi-
ties. Delphi Forums started in 1983 and is a thriving group of communities on
just about any topic you might want.
Usually a discussion forum will have a series of discussion threads, initially
created by the forum manager. The organization of the threads helps people
to find the information they are seeking. Also the threads help participants to
carry on discussions about specific topics. You’ll be amazed by how much
support you can receive through these types of support groups, but you also
must be careful. Even though most of these groups require password access,
they still are not as private as those small face-to-face meetings where you
know and can see who is participating.
53
Chapter 4: Seeking Help to Determine What You’d Like to Do Next

What type works best for you will depend on the type of person you are.
Meetings work the best if you need that personal face-to-face contact in order
to open up. Discussion forums can be the best if you like to have feedback,
but prefer not to talk about things in front of others. You can even create an
identity in a discussion forum that is different than the name you use in the
real world. That’s both a blessing and a curse; while you can hide your true
identity, so can anyone else who is participating. So be careful what you post
on an Internet forum.
Finding support groups near you
The best place to find support groups near you is through organizations to
which you belong. This can include professional organizations, business orga-
nizations, religious organizations, or social organizations to which you belong.
Many churches, synagogues, and mosques provide various types of support
groups for their members and don’t necessarily advertise them. The best way
to find out about them is to talk with your religious leader. Often the support
groups based within a religious community are kept secret to provide sup-
port in a confidential way to the people participating.
Other good places to start when looking for support groups are community
centers, especially ones that provide senior activities. Many community cen-
ters host support groups of all types.
If you’re having no luck finding groups in your area on your own, you can try
searching for one through the American Self-Help Clearinghouse (mentalhelp.
net/selfhelp). Search for a topic of your choice at this site and you’ll get a
list of groups that may be near you. The clearinghouse maintains a database
of over 1,100 national, international, model, and online self-help support
groups for addictions, bereavement, health, mental health, disabilities, abuse,
parenting, caregiver concerns, and other stressful life situations. You can also
find lists of local self-help clearinghouses worldwide, information on starting
face-to-face and online groups, and a registry for persons interested in start-
ing national or international self-help groups.

you qualify for Medicare or you don’t.

Chapter 5
Getting a Grasp on Managing
What You Saved for Retirement
In This Chapter
 Exploring what you own
 Following the distribution rules
 Investing wisely
You likely own a large portfolio of investments to manage from your
employer-based retirement savings plans (401(k)s, cash benefit plans,
profit-sharing plans, and others. In addition, you may also have IRAs or other
retirement savings. Each type of plan has a different set of rules for how you
can manage the money and how you can withdraw the money.
In this chapter, I review the many different types of retirement accounts you
may hold and the rules for each. I also talk about investing strategies to help
you continue to grow your portfolio in retirement.
Exploring Your Retirement Accounts
Hopefully, you’ve been saving all your life for retirement through various
types of employer-based retirement savings plans or individual retirement
accounts. Most likely your contribution was automatically taken out of your
paycheck, and if you had retirement benefits, your employer contributed to
your retirement savings account as well.
But do you understand what you have? The language of retirement savings is
unique. Many people paid into a retirement account their entire working life,
but have no idea how to manage the nest egg they now own.

Before we discuss management strategies, I first want to explore exactly what
you might have. I also want to introduce you to the language of retirement
savings.
Defined contributions versus 
defined benefits
Every retirement account is either a defined-contribution or defined-benefit
account. They differ greatly regarding who manages them and how much
freedom you have to get your money.
 Defined-benefit plans are traditional pension plans. In these types of
plans, the rules specify what your benefit will be no matter how much
you or your employer put into the plan. The benefit usually is deter-
mined by your last three or last five years of wages or salary. Another
key factor that is used to determine your benefit is the number of years
you worked for the company or government entity. Once determined,
your defined benefit will be the same for the rest of your life and will
never run out. Your employer continues to manage the money to be sure
you won’t run out.
 Defined-contribution plans include various types of retirement plans
that you can contribute to while working, such as a 401(k) or 403(b).
Many times the employer matches at least part of your contribution.
When you are ready to retire, the nest egg you’ve saved will have to last
you for the rest of your life. You will decide how and when to take the
money out of the account. It’s your responsibility to manage the way the
funds are invested. You also must be sure you don’t run out of money in
retirement.
If you’re already collecting your retirement benefits, this chapter will help
you understand what you have. If you haven’t started to collect benefits and
are just beginning your pre-retirement planning, this chapter will help you
with your decision making about how to handle your employer-sponsored
retirement savings.
Pensions (defined-benefit plan)
Traditional pensions gradually are becoming extinct (read Chapter 8 for more
information about why). If you do have one, consider yourself lucky. Most
companies are shifting their pension plans to cash-balance plans (a hybrid
58
Part II: Your Wallet to Your Health: The 411 When You Re-Enter the Workforce 

between a defined-contribution and defined-benefit plan) or changing the
rules for new hires so they don’t qualify for them. Instead, new hires only get
access to a defined-contribution plan.
Pensions were started in the workplace to reward employees for loyalty and
long-term service to a company. The benefits are considered “backloaded,”
because you have to be with a company a long time to see any value in a
defined-benefit plan.
Calculating payout
The money you’ll actually receive at retirement is based on your age, your
earnings, and your years of service. Some companies calculate their benefits
as a percentage of your salary and years of service. For example, 1 percent of
final pay times the number of years of service. Other plans calculate the ben-
efit by a specific dollar amount. For example, $25 per month for every year
that you worked for the company. Other companies promise an exact dollar
amount per month, such as $100 per month. All companies set a minimum
age before you can qualify for benefits.
Most pension benefits are calculated using this common formula:
Pay × Years of Service × Benefit Factor = Pension Payment
Here’s what each element refers to:
 Pay: The figure to be used for pay varies greatly from company to com-
pany. Some use the highest three to ten years, others use the most
recent three to ten years. In some companies, bonuses and incentives
are included in the calculation, while others don’t include those extras.
You’ll need to read the fine print in your pension plan documentation to
find out how the pay level to be used in the formula is determined.
 Years of Service: If you worked steadily for a company without taking
any extended breaks, then this is an easy number to calculate. But, if
you took an extended break, such as time off under the Family Medical
Leave Act, then the way these breaks are handled can impact your years
of service. In some companies or government entities, you can buy back
the years of service lost during breaks.
 Benefit Factor: All pensions have a benefit factor that will be stated in
your documents. The factor usually ranges between 1 and 2 percent of
your pay. This is usually set to give the highest benefit to a long-term
employee who has worked the ideal maximum number of years for 
the company. For example, if a company wants to reward a 40-year
employee with a guarantee of 50 percent of his salary at retirement, the
factor would be 1.25 percent (40 × .0125 = 50 percent).
59
Chapter 5: Getting a Grasp on Managing What You Saved for Retirement

Using this formula, I can show you how a company backloads a pension plan.
I will look at three employees. Larry who worked 40 years for the company,
Sandy who worked 20 years for the company, and Kathy who worked 10
years for the company. All three ended their careers with their highest five
years averaging $50,000. Check out what their individual formulas look like:
Kathy’s pension benefit: $50,000 × 10 × .0125 = $6,250
Sandy’s pension benefit: $50,000 × 20 × .0125 = $12,500
Larry’s pension benefit: $50,000 × 40 × .0125 = $25,000
You can see that Larry’s pension is four times Kathy’s and twice Sandy’s. The
employer in this example wanted people to stay around for a long time and
rewarded them with a good pension to encourage that longevity. That type of
reward is rare in today’s global economy. If your grandchildren are just enter-
ing the job market today, they will have a hard time finding a company that
still offers pensions to their newly hired employees.
Deciding payout method
The key decision you have to make when filling out the paperwork to start
collecting your pension benefits is how you want to receive them. Most com-
panies offer you a number of different payout options. Here are the three
most common:
 Single life allowance: You will get the biggest monthly check if you
choose this option, but all payments stop upon your death. If your
spouse does not have a pension plan, that means he or she would have
to live on savings and Social Security benefits.
 Joint allowance: You will get a reduced monthly check for your lifetime,
but if you die first, your spouse (or other named beneficiary) will con-
tinue to get the check. Many companies offer a variation on this and you
can set it up so your beneficiary gets 25, 50, or 75 percent of your bene-
fit. If you choose the reduced beneficiary benefit, your check will be
higher, but be careful. Often the costs of living in retirement are not
much different for the sole remaining person and can sometimes be
higher if medical costs are high. So think twice before agreeing to a
reduced benefit for your beneficiary.
 Pop-up joint allowance: You will get a lower monthly check than the
standard joint allowance, but the big advantage of this option is that if
your beneficiary dies first, your check will pop back up to the single life
allowance. This option also provides for a 25, 50, or 75 percent benefit
for your beneficiary rather than the full benefit.
60
Part II: Your Wallet to Your Health: The 411 When You Re-Enter the Workforce 

Before you decide how you want to take your retirement benefits, you also
might want to think about whether you want to work for the company again
as a consultant or part-time after you retire. Most companies don’t allow you
to earn money directly from the company once you’re collecting a retirement
check. So, if you do think you’d like to go back to work after you officially
retire, check the rules before starting your pension payout.
You might find that your company offers other options as well. In making
your decision about which one to choose, take a look at what you will receive
monthly and add in whatever your spouse will receive. Also compare what
the benefits will be after one of you dies and determine what will give both of
you the best benefit through both of your lifetimes.
You may want to consult a financial advisor before making a choice about
your pension options. You will have to live with your choice for the rest of
your life. You can’t change the decision you make at retirement three years
into retirement.
Changing the pension rules
Companies made these pension plan promises, but now most don’t want to
keep them. Their retirement benefits are a heavy burden, especially because
so many companies underfunded their retirement portfolios and don’t have
the cash they need to pay all their retirees. So instead, many large companies
converted to a hybrid called the cash-balance plan, which is somewhere
between a defined-benefit and defined-contribution plan, but much closer to
a defined-contribution plan.
If your traditional defined-benefit plan was converted to a cash-balance plan,
then a formula was used at the time of conversion to determine a cash value
for the traditional defined-benefit plan based on your years of service and
your salary. After conversion, your employer will continue to contribute to
this plan. When you retire, your payout will be based on the cash value at
retirement.
Your employer manages the money in your cash-balance plan. Each year you
are still working, your employer contributes a portion of your pay plus an
interest credit (which can be a fixed amount or a variable amount set to an
index, such as the one-year U.S. Treasury bill interest rate).
If your company converted to a cash-balance plan, then at retirement you will
be offered one of two ways to get your money:
 Annuity: An annuity guarantees you a set amount each month for the
rest of your life. Your company or a company they designate (usually an
insurance company or financial institution) continues to manage the
money.
61
Chapter 5: Getting a Grasp on Managing What You Saved for Retirement

 Lump-sum cash payout: The lump-sum cash payout should be rolled
into an individual retirement account (IRA) or you’ll be hit with a huge
tax bill. You’ll be responsible for managing the money.
Employer savings plans (defined-
contribution plans)
In today’s world, few people stay with a company long enough to earn a pen-
sion. Many people move around to get promotions and pay increases. Others
find they are laid off before they have enough time with the company for the
pension to be worth anything.
In answer to this changing world, many companies have changed their retire-
ment benefits to something more portable called a 401(k). If you work for a
nonprofit entity, you have a similar type of plan called a 403(b). Both of these
plan names are parts of the tax code.
They are called defined-contribution plans because it is defined upfront how
much the company will contribute to the plan rather than how much the
company will give you as a retirement benefit. Most companies structure
their defined-contribution plans based on a matching system. You decide to
put in a certain percentage of your salary and the company will match it
dollar for dollar up to a certain percentage or dollar amount. For example, a
common match companies offer is that for the first 5 percent you contribute
to your 401(k), your company will contribute 5 percent.
You should contribute at least as much as the company will match. If you
don’t contribute an amount equal to the match the company offers, it’s like
giving up free money.
The biggest benefit defined-contribution plans offer over defined-benefit
plans is that you can take your contributions with you when you change jobs.
How much you will be able to take with you depends on how long you work
with the company.
Vesting (getting ownership rights)
Everything you contribute to the 401(k) or 403(b) is yours to take whenever
you leave. But, contributions your employer made must become vested (get
ownership rights) before you can take the money with you. Be sure you
understand the vesting rules before deciding to change jobs. If you’re a year
or less away from being fully vested, you may want to hold on and be sure to
get your employer’s contributions.
62
Part II: Your Wallet to Your Health: The 411 When You Re-Enter the Workforce 

Employers have two ways they can set up vesting rules — three-year cliff
vesting and six-year graded vesting. Here’s how they work:
 Three-year cliff vesting: You will become fully vested and be able to
take all your employer’s contributions to your retirement plan with you
once you’ve worked for a company for at least three years. If you leave
before that time, you lose all your employer’s matching contributions,
but you can take your contributions with you.
 Six-year graded vesting: You start building your rights to your
employer’s contributions after you have worked for the company for
one year. Beginning with year two, you become 20 percent vested each
year. After you’ve worked six years for the company, you are 100 percent
vested and can take all your employer’s contributions to your retirement
plan with you.
If you change jobs and are 100 percent vested, you can roll out the funds in
your employer’s retirement account to an individual retirement account IRA
or you can roll the funds into your new employer’s 401(k). I’ve always rolled
them into my personal IRA so I could pick my own investments and not be
limited to those chosen by my employer as part of the 401(k) plan.
Don’t ever take the money and spend it. Unfortunately, 40 percent of the
people who roll out their 401(k)s spend at least part of the money rather than
roll it over into another retirement savings account. If you do that, you’ll be
living on a very limited income in retirement or you’ll be working until you
die. Not only do you extend your working years, you also get a lot less of the
money.
There are stiff penalties and taxes on the money when you withdraw it early.
You pay a 10 percent penalty, plus it’s taxed at your regular income tax rate.
Many people give up as much as 40 percent of their lump sum to taxes if they
decide to use it right away.
While the portability is an important benefit of 401(k)s and 403(b)s, the 
big thing you lose is the portfolio management skills of a professional 
pension plan manager. You make the investment choices for your defined-
contribution plan. You are responsible to be sure you’ll have enough 
money to make it through retirement.
Types of defined-contribution plans
The 401(k) and 403(b) are the most common types of defined-contribution
plans if you worked for a major corporation, but if you worked for a small
business, you may have a different type of plan from your current or former
workplace:
63
Chapter 5: Getting a Grasp on Managing What You Saved for Retirement

 SEP-IRA: The Simplified Employee Pension (SEP-IRA) is actually a type of
IRA your employer sets up for you. Your employer makes all contribu-
tions to your SEP-IRA. Your employer can contribute as much as 25 per-
cent of your compensation (but most do contribute much less) up to a
max of $44,000. You are immediately fully vested in this type of plan and
can take it all with you when you leave.
 SIMPLE IRA: The Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees (SIMPLE
IRA) allows contributions from the employer and employee. In a SIMPLE
IRA, the employer can contribute up to 3 percent of your salary. Employees
can contribute up to $10,000. If you are 50 or older, you can contribute up
to $12,500 beginning January 1, 2007. You are immediately fully vested in
this type of plan.
 Profit-sharing plans: Some small businesses set up profit-sharing plans
rather than defined-contribution plans. These allow you to share a slice
of your company’s profits. Annual contributions to these types of plans
are based on the company’s performance and are likely to vary each
year. Your employer can contribute as much as 25 percent of your salary
up to a maximum of $44,000. Vesting rules vary from company to com-
pany. You’ll have to check with your company to find out when you
become fully vested and can take the money with you when you leave.
 Keoghs: These are the granddaddy of small-business retirement plans,
which were established in 1962. You won’t find many of these around
today. Some are structured similarly to a traditional pension plan while
others are closer to a defined-contribution plan. It all depends on how
your employer set it up. If you are part of a Keogh plan, you will need to
ask the person responsible for benefits to explain how the plan works
and what your benefits will be when you leave.
IRAs
In addition to employer-sponsored retirement savings, you can also open
individual retirement accounts. Individual retirement accounts come in three
different options — traditional tax-deductible, non-tax-deductible, and ROTH.
Traditional tax-deductible IRA
This type of IRA is primarily for someone who does not have a retirement
savings plan or pension through their employer. If you have a traditional IRA,
you can contribute up to $4,000 per year and it’s fully tax deductible. If you
are 50 years old or older, you can add $1,000 and contribute up to $5,000. In
2008, the base amount per year will go up to $5,000 and anyone 50-plus will
be able to contribute $6,000 toward the traditional IRA.
64
Part II: Your Wallet to Your Health: The 411 When You Re-Enter the Workforce 

The amount you contribute is tax deductible provided you are not covered
by an employer-sponsored retirement plan. If you are covered, you can’t fund
a traditional IRA once you make more than $60,000 if single and $85,000 if
married. Your IRA grows tax-deferred until you start taking the money out at
retirement. I talk about withdrawal rules in the section “Taking Out Your
Money — the Official Rules,” later in this chapter.
Traditional non-tax-deductible IRA
This type of IRA is primarily for someone who wants to sock away a bit more
money tax-deferred, but already has an employer-sponsored retirement sav-
ings plan or pension at work. The amount you can contribute to a traditional
non-tax-deductible IRA are the same as the tax-deductible type, but you won’t
be able to write your contributions to the IRA off on your taxes.
The traditional non-tax-deductible IRA doesn’t make much sense today
because there is a better option. Since you can’t write off your contributions,
you’re much better off with a Roth IRA.
Roth IRA
Roth IRAs are an excellent way to save extra money for retirement com-
pletely tax free. You can’t deduct the amount you contribute, but all the
money you withdraw in retirement after the age of 591⁄2 can be withdrawn
without having to worry about taxes. That means your money can grow
inside an IRA and you won’t pay taxes on any of the earnings from interest,
dividends, or capital gains.
The amount you can contribute to a Roth IRA is the same as the traditional
tax-deductible IRA. You can contribute to a Roth IRA even if you have an
employer-sponsored retirement plan. Your modified adjusted gross income
(MAGI) must be less than $110,000 if you are single and less than $160,000 if
you are married to be eligible to contribute to a Roth IRA.
65
Chapter 5: Getting a Grasp on Managing What You Saved for Retirement
What is MAGI?
Many people wonder how modified adjusted
growth income differs from adjusted growth
income. The MAGI is only used when calculat-
ing IRA contributions. Your adjusted growth
income is modified by adding back in certain
items, such as foreign income, foreign-housing
deductions, student-loan deductions, IRA-
contribution deductions, and deductions for
higher-education costs. If you are near the qual-
ifying income of $100,000 for a Roth IRA, these
additions can make you ineligible.

If you have a traditional tax-deductible IRA or other retirement funds to
which you contributed tax-deferred (such as a 401(k) that you take out when
you leave a job), you can roll these funds into a Roth IRA, but you will have to
pay income taxes on the money. If your MAGI exceeds $100,000, you can’t
contribute to a Roth IRA by rolling over funds from tax-deferred accounts.
The rules for withdrawing the funds are more flexible than traditional IRAs. 
I talk more about that in the next section “Taking Out Your Money — the
Official Rules.”
Taking Out Your Money — 
the Official Rules
Every one of these retirement savings plans has slightly different rules
regarding when you may start to draw the money and how much you must
withdraw. Some have rules that require you start to withdraw the money by a
particular date, while others leave the decision about when you want to start
taking out the money completely in your hands.
I talk more about how to actually manage your withdrawals to make sure you
don’t run out of money during retirement in Chapter 6. That’s actually a very
different topic than the official withdrawal rules.
When you must start to draw money
When you can start taking out the money will depend on the type of retire-
ment account you have. Each type has its own set of rules. All but the Roth
IRA require that you pay income tax on the money as it is withdrawn. The
amount of tax you will pay will depend on your income-tax bracket.
401(k)s and 403(b)s
You must make a decision about how you want your money distributed when
you leave the company that provided you with a 401(k) or 403(b). If you’re
not near retirement age when you leave, you’re best bet is to roll it out into
an IRA and take control of the money. You may be able to roll the funds into
your new employer’s retirement savings plan, but check out the investment
options before you do. Usually you can find better options in your own IRA.
If you don’t roll out your account balance into an IRA, you may be able to
leave the money in your employer’s care and choose an annuity when you
reach retirement age. If offered, the annuity options will be similar to those
66
Part II: Your Wallet to Your Health: The 411 When You Re-Enter the Workforce 

mentioned above in the “Pensions (defined-benefit plan)” section — single-
life allowance and joint allowance. There will also likely be a cash certain
option, where you can decide how many years you want to receive a pay-
ment, such as 5-year certain, 10-year certain, or 20-year certain. If you die
before the end of the period chosen, your beneficiary will receive the remain-
ing payments. If you choose an annuity, you will have payments for life (or
the time period chosen), but your beneficiary will only get additional money
if you choose a joint allowance.
You can leave your money in the account if you go back to work after retire-
ment, but no matter what you do, when you reach age 701⁄2 you will have to
start taking out your money. You can’t delay it longer than that.
Traditional IRAs
If you have a traditional IRA, you can’t start withdrawing your funds without
penalty until the age of 591⁄2. You also must start taking the funds, even if you
don’t need them because you are working, once you reach age 701⁄2.
If you retire early and want to draw the funds sooner or you decide you need
the money before age 591⁄2, you will likely face a penalty of 10 percent when
withdrawing the funds. You also will have to pay taxes due on the amount of
money you withdraw. You can avoid the penalty but not the income taxes if
you take the money out for higher education, first-time home purchase, or
death or disability.
Whenever you take funds out of a traditional IRA, you will have to pay income
taxes on the money withdrawn. The one exception to this rule is that if you
put money into a non-tax-deductible traditional IRA, your contributions to
the fund are not taxable because you paid taxes on them before depositing
the money in the IRA, but you do pay taxes on any gains made with the
money contributed.
Be sure you keep your non-taxable traditional IRA separate from all other
IRAs. If you co-mingle the funds of a tax-deductible IRA and a non-tax-
deductible IRA, you will need to pay income taxes on all the money.
SIMPLE or SEP-IRAs
If your employer sponsored a SIMPLE or SEP-IRA for you, the rules for with-
drawal are the same as they are for a traditional IRA. You own the account
from the day your company opens it for you and you will be able to withdraw
the money the same way you would with a traditional IRA. If you keep the
money in your SIMPLE IRA for less than two years, you will have to pay a 
25 percent penalty rather than just a 10 percent penalty.
67
Chapter 5: Getting a Grasp on Managing What You Saved for Retirement

Profit-sharing plan
If your company offered a profit-sharing plan, its withdrawal rules will be the
same as those for a 401(k). You will have a 10 percent penalty if you withdraw
the funds before age 591⁄2 and you will have to pay income tax on the funds as
you withdraw them.
Roth IRA
The Roth IRA is the only type of retirement savings you have that is not taxed
as you withdraw the money as long as you wait until age 591⁄2. If you need to
withdraw the money before that age, you can withdraw your annual contribu-
tions tax-free.
If you need to withdraw the money for the purpose of buying a house for the
first time, you can withdraw the money from your Roth IRA tax-free provided
the money was deposited in the Roth IRA for at least five years. If you with-
draw the money for any other purpose, you will need to pay taxes on the
earnings, but not on your initial contributions.
Exceptions for illness and unemployment
If you are younger than 591⁄2, you may be able to avoid paying taxes and penal-
ties on your retirement savings for certain reasons.
If your medical expenses exceed 7.5 percent of your adjusted gross income,
you can withdraw funds from your tax-deductible IRA without a penalty, but
you will have to pay income taxes on the money. You can also withdraw the
money you contributed in a non-tax-deductible IRA without penalty, but you
will have to pay taxes on the earnings. Money in a Roth IRA can be withdrawn
without paying any taxes or penalties if needed for these purposes.
You can also use IRA funds for paying health insurance if you collect federal
unemployment benefits for 12 consecutive weeks. The rules for withdrawals
to pay health insurance benefits are the same as those for medical expenses.
How much you must withdraw
Once you reach the age of 701⁄2, you don’t have a choice. Even if you are work-
ing, you will have to start withdrawing funds from your retirement savings
accounts. The only exception to this are funds in your Roth IRA. There are no
mandatory withdrawal rules for the Roth IRA.
68
Part II: Your Wallet to Your Health: The 411 When You Re-Enter the Workforce 

The amount you must withdraw will be lower than the amount you will likely
withdraw once you start depending on your retirement savings to meet your
budget. I talk more about managing your withdrawals so you don’t run out of
money in Chapter 6. In this section, I will just briefly discuss the official rules
for how much you must withdraw to avoid taxes and penalties.
You probably won’t have to worry about these rules unless you are working
and not ready to start funding your retirement with your savings. Many work-
ing retirees decide to leave the money in their retirement savings accounts as
long as possible, and some even add to them.
If you don’t take out the minimum amount required, you will have to pay a 
50 percent penalty on any shortfall. It’s a hefty penalty, so don’t make this
mistake. The money is much better off in your pocket than the government’s.
Luckily it’s not too hard to figure out your required minimum each year. The
IRS developed two tables. One table assumes your beneficiary is not more
than 10 years younger than you. There is a separate table if your beneficiary
is 10 years younger than you (see Table 5-1).

This table does go up to 114, but to save space I’m just including the num-
bers up to age 90. You can find this full table, as well as the table to use if you
have a younger beneficiary, in IRS Publication 590 (traditional IRAs) online at
www.irs.gov/publications/p590. By the time you reach 701⁄2, any money
you are not withdrawing is likely sitting in a Traditional or Roth IRA. If you do
still have money sitting in your former employer-sponsored retirement
account that you have not started to withdraw, check with your former
employer about withdrawal rules.
To calculate the amount you must withdraw each year once you reach 701⁄2,
pick out the distribution factor next to your age. Then divide the amount you
have in your IRA account by this distribution factor. For example, suppose a
retiree who is 72 years old has $300,000 in retirement funds. Here are the
steps for calculating his minimum withdrawal:
1. Find his distribution factor on the chart. It’s 25.6.
2. Divide $300,000 by 25.6.
3. The amount that must be withdrawn at age 72 to avoid a 50 percent
penalty is $11,718.75.
Even the most conservative financial planner will tell you that it is safe to
withdraw 4 percent yearly from your retirement savings. A 4 percent with-
drawal would total $12,000. So you can see the minimum withdrawals are
70
Part II: Your Wallet to Your Health: The 411 When You Re-Enter the Workforce 

slightly below that and shouldn’t create a major burden for you even if you
are working and have to pay income taxes on your salary, Social Security, and
the distribution.
Yes, by age 72 you should be getting your Social Security benefits as well.
While you can delay taking those benefits, there is no reason to do so after
age 70. I talk more about why that is true in Chapter 8.
If you don’t need the mandatory distribution funds because you are still
working, you can always deposit them in a Roth IRA. There is no age limit for
depositing money in that type of IRA. That way your money can grow tax free
for the rest of your life. If you never need it, you can leave it to your heirs.
There is never an obligation to withdraw funds from a Roth IRA.
Investing the Money You Have
Hopefully by the time you reach retirement you will have a sizeable nest egg
that you can tap as you enjoy your retirement years. Most people decide to
go back to work when they realize their nest egg isn’t quite large enough to
do the things they want to do.
Avoiding common mistakes
Investing your nest egg properly, whatever size you have, is critical to extend-
ing its life throughout your life span. Avoiding these mistakes can help you
manage your nest egg better during retirement:
 Forgetting about asset allocation: Many people think that the most
important aspect of managing a portfolio is picking the right stocks,
bonds, and mutual funds. They’re wrong. The individual stocks, bonds,
or mutual funds account for only 5 to 10 percent of a portfolio’s success.
More than 90 percent of that success can be credited to the way you allo-
cate your assets among stocks, bonds, and money market instruments.
 Playing it too safely: Another key mistake most people make as they
prepare for retirement is to move all their assets into investment vehi-
cles with fixed returns, such as bonds and money market funds. That’s a
big mistake because most people live at least 20 years in retirement. If
you depend solely on interest, which usually falls below the inflation
rate, your portfolio will gradually be eaten away by inflation.
71
Chapter 5: Getting a Grasp on Managing What You Saved for Retirement

You must continue to grow your portfolio in the early years of retire-
ment. In order to continue to grow your portfolio and beat inflation, you
do need to have at least a 20 percent stock component in that portfolio.
That can be either through purchasing stocks directly or by buying
stock mutual funds and letting a professional money manager do 
the stock picking for you.
Allocating your investments
Proper asset allocation involves five key factors — investment goal, time
horizon, risk tolerance, financial resources, and investment mix. You must
weigh your needs, your personality, and how well you accept risk in order to
best plan your asset allocation.
Your investment goal
Why are you saving? That’s an easy answer for most of you at this time — to
have enough money in retirement. But some of you may be thinking you want
to start a business or you may have other goals.
You may want to have enough money to help grandchildren go to col-
lege. You may want to set aside money for your grandchildren’s or great-
grandchildren’s life events — such as weddings or christenings or bar and
bat mitzvahs.
Make a list of all the things you’d like to have money for in the future and
tally up what you might need to figure out your investment needs. If your
needs are higher than what you have in your portfolio, you must do one of
two things — change your goals or go back to work to earn more money.
Your time horizon
How long will you have until you are going to need the money? When you
need the money does impact how you should invest it.
If you think you will need to use the money in two to three years, that portion
of your portfolio should be in cash or money market funds. Money you’ll
need in three to five years is best socked away in a bond fund. The rest can
be put in a faster-growing stock fund or individual stocks. Each year you can
reallocate your funds to keep this mix in place.
You don’t want to be forced into a situation where you have to sell a losing
investment, like a stock that’s not performing well at the time, just to meet
your bills. By giving yourself at least a five-year horizon to sell a stock asset,
72
Part II: Your Wallet to Your Health: The 411 When You Re-Enter the Workforce 

you can usually find a good time to sell and avoid a huge loss. Don’t get me
wrong: I’m not saying you can avoid selling every stock asset without accept-
ing some possible losses (mistakes are made and economic shocks can
impact the market for a long time), but if you have at least five years to sell
an asset, you have a better chance of finding a good time to sell and avoid a
loss.
Your risk tolerance
How much risk can you accept in your portfolio and still be able to sleep at
night? You need to think about that carefully. If your portfolio allocation is so
risky that you’re worrying about it each day, it’s not worth the risk.
If you want to try to gauge your risk tolerance, answer these four questions:
 Do fluctuations in the market keep you up all night?
 Do you have a minimal understanding about investing?
 Do you think of yourself as a saver more than an investor?
 Do you have a great fear about losing more than 25 percent of your
assets in a few weeks?
If you answered yes to all four questions, you are likely a conservative
investor. You should still have a stock component in your portfolio to insure
that your funds continue to grow throughout your retirement, but your best
bet may be to pick a balanced mutual fund or a life-cycle mutual fund that
manages the risk for you without taking any great swings up or down. You
won’t ever have a significant growth spurt, but you also won’t experience a
significant loss for a short period of time.
If you think you can tolerate a bit more risk, answer these questions:
 Do you feel comfortable with the ups and downs of the market?
 Do you understand the ins and outs of investing, as well as how the
securities markets work?
 Do you understand the concept of investing for the long-term and not
worrying about short-term loses in a down market?
 Can you accept significant short-term loses without panicking and sell-
ing your holdings?
If you answered yes to these questions, you are likely an aggressive investor
and willing to take more risk with your portfolio to grow your money.
73
Chapter 5: Getting a Grasp on Managing What You Saved for Retirement

If your answers were a mix among these sets of questions, then you are a
moderate investor and fall between these two extremes.
Your financial resources
How much do you have in your portfolio? How much you have will impact
how well you can diversify your portfolio. Basically, it’s not wise to put more
than 4 percent of your portfolio in any one investment, such as an individual
stock or bond. If you don’t have enough to diversify properly, use mutual
funds that are already well diversified.
Your investment mix
How well is your portfolio balanced among these three key elements — cash,
stocks, and bonds? The way you mix the three key elements will impact the
return you can get. A portfolio invested mostly in cash vehicles (money
market funds and certificates of deposit) will have the lowest return, but is
the safest, if your primary concern is loss of principal and you’re not worried
about taxes or inflation eating away your returns. A portfolio invested only in
stocks will have the highest return but is the riskiest. By properly allocating
those components, you can reduce risk and still grow your money.
In Chapter 6, I discuss withdrawal strategies. Your portfolio mix also affects
how much you can withdraw from your portfolio each year and not run out of
money.
Your home and your retirement portfolio
Another big part of most people’s holdings in retirement is their home. By the
time you retire, it’s best to own that home free and clear, so you don’t have a
mortgage payment.
That will free up a sizeable lump of cash you can use to do other things you
want. It also gives you a great safety net that you can fall back on in your
later retirement years if you run out of money in your retirement savings
accounts.
If you do need to take the money out of your home, you can stay in the home
and apply for what is called a reverse mortgage. These mortgages can be
structured to allow you to stay in your home for life and pay you a set
monthly amount rather than you paying the bank. For more information on
reverse mortgages, check out Reverse Mortgages For Dummies (Wiley).
Be careful though if you decide to take a reverse mortgage. Make sure you
involve an attorney who understands reverse mortgage contracts. You will
find some crooks out there who just want your home and will not worry
about your needs.
74
Part II: Your Wallet to Your Health: The 411 When You Re-Enter the Workforce 

Changing your strategies as you age
When you first retire, you can have 60 to 70 percent of your portfolio in
stocks, but you may want to start shifting some of that money into bonds
pretty quickly as long as market conditions are good. Remember, you likely
will live about 20 years in retirement, so you want that money to last you a
long time.
Stock and bond markets can be erratic with lots of ups and downs. Yes,
bonds do lose value. They are safer than stocks, but you may not be able to
get the face value of the bond if you want to sell it before it matures.
Bonds tend to move in the opposite direction of stocks, which makes them a
good choice for balancing out a portfolio. Bonds will drop in value when
interest rates rise and will increase in value when interest rates fall. That’s
because as interest rates rise, a bond that pays a lower interest rate will be
worth less because it has a lower return.
You can decide to invest directly in bonds or stocks or use a mix of mutual
funds. Mutual funds do give you the advantage of professional management,
but be cautious of paying any upfront commissions (front load) or back-end
commissions (back load). You also need to watch the annual fee structure for
every mutual fund. Look for no-load funds (commission free) and funds
whose fees are under 1 percent. A great book to read more about investing
through mutual funds is Mutual Funds For Dummies (Wiley).
Your primary goal is to have the cash you need when you need it without
having to take a loss on any part of your portfolio. I can’t guarantee that you
will never take a loss, everyone makes a mistake in choosing investment
opportunities sometimes. But following the general rule of moving money to
cash one to two years before needing it minimizes your risk of taking a loss.
The key thing you want to avoid is being forced to sell a stock or bond in a
losing position just because you need the cash. Carefully managing your
investment mix as you age helps you avoid this type of crisis.
Follow these steps while managing your portfolio in retirement to minimize
your risk of taking a loss:
1. Shift some stocks to bonds. It’s best to shift stock holdings to bonds
about three to five years before you need the money. As you age, it’s
good to be sure that your portfolio balance includes bonds for the
money you think you will need in three to five years. That way you can
count on a higher level of growth than cash accounts offer, but your
principle is less likely to be at risk.
75
Chapter 5: Getting a Grasp on Managing What You Saved for Retirement

You can, of course, convert your stock immediately to cash holdings and
not touch your bond holdings if the stock market is up and the bond
market is down.
2. Shift some bonds to a cash vehicle. Convert your bond holdings from
Step 1 into cash when you think you are one or two years away from
needing the money. Giving yourself that much time will enable you to
convert the bonds at a good time when you will get the best return on
your bonds.
Your time horizon for needing the money is a critical factor in deciding
where to put your funds. You don’t want to be caught in a down market
when you need to sell stocks or bonds. You can avoid being caught by
shifting money that you know you will need in the next two years into a
cash vehicle, such as a money market fund or a certificate of deposit.
You won’t earn much on the money, but your principle will be safe.

Chapter 6
Managing Your Money 
So It Doesn’t Run Out
In This Chapter
 Developing a budget
 Scheduling withdrawals
 Getting your assets in gear
 Exploring tax obligations
You likely will be living 20 years or more in retirement. When you retire,
you probably won’t have the means to save more. Even if you do go
back to work, you probably won’t be earning the same amount as you did
when working full-time in a high-pressure job.
You don’t want to run out of money, but how do you manage a portfolio so it
will last 20 years or more? You need to figure out how much money you’ll use
each year. Also, you want to figure out how much money you can safely with-
draw from your retirement savings portfolio to avoid running out of money
during your lifetime. If you do have a shortfall, you’ll need to go back to work
or find some other way to raise funds.
In this chapter, I discuss the basics of budgeting in retirement. Then I explore
strategies for managing your portfolio and safely withdrawing funds so you
don’t run out. I also discuss the bite that taxes will take out of your retire-
ment funds.
Determining Your Budget
You won’t need the same amount of money throughout retirement. In fact,
most people will move through at least three phases of life during retirement.
You also need to budget for different types of things than you did while you
were working. In this section, I review budgeting for the phases of retirement
and what items you need to include in your budget.

Budgeting for each phase of retirement
Budgeting for retirement can get very complicated. You actually have to think
of retirement in three phases — active, passive, and dependent:
 Active phase: During this phase of your life you will still be very active,
whether or not you retired early or have gone back to work. You want to
take time to enjoy the money you socked away while working before
retirement. You also may decide to go back to work to supplement what
you saved. This is especially true for retirees who are not yet old enough
to collect Social Security and get the benefits of Medicare. You’ll need
extra money for travel and other things you dreamed of doing during
retirement. Your living costs may be a bit less than they were when you
were working, but not much.
 Passive phase: During this phase of your life you start to slow down. You
are probably well enough to continue living on your own, but probably
not well enough to continue traveling or doing the other activities you
did during the active phase. Your living costs will actually be the cheap-
est during this phase, because you’ll likely cut back on travel, entertain-
ment, transportation costs, and clothing purchases.
 Dependent phase: Some people avoid this phase. They are the lucky few.
Most of you will get to a phase in your life where you must be dependent
on others for help to meet your daily needs of life, such as help with
bathing, dressing, and preparing food. Your living costs could actually 
be the highest in this phase of life, especially if you need to enter an
assisted-living or nursing home. Either way, your medical costs will likely
be much higher than in the active and passive phases of retirement.
You actually need to develop three estimated budgets to calculate what you
might need in retirement. No one can be sure exactly how long they will live
in retirement, but by considering your family history and your current health,
you can make an educated guess.
MSN Money provides you with an excellent life-expectancy calculator at 
moneycentral.msn.com/investor/calcs/n_expect/main.asp. This
calculator asks some key questions about your lifestyle, your health, and
your family’s health history, and then it provides a guesstimate for your life
expectancy.
Accounting for everything
For budget purposes, you’ll probably have most of the same line items on
your budget as you did while you were working full-time, but you will be able
to drop costs for commuting, child care (if they hadn’t already been dropped
78
Part II: Your Wallet to Your Health: The 411 When You Re-Enter the Workforce 

before you retired), business gifts, and professional dues. In exchange for
these budget items, you’ll probably add increased health insurance premi-
ums, increased healthcare expenses, and increased travel and leisure costs.
Initially, your clothing budget might shoot up as you shift from needing daily
business attire to daily leisure attire.
The following sections give you some key things to consider as you develop
your retirement budget.
Food and shelter costs
Your shelter costs may change depending on whether you plan to stay in
your home or move to a smaller retirement home. Or you may decide to keep
two homes going in the active phase of retirement — your family home where
you live now (possibly in the cold north) and a retirement home (possibly in
the warmer south).
Your food costs will depend on whether you want to eat out more or save
money and do more cooking at home. Your budget for personal care items
may drop a little bit because you’re not getting ready for work each day, but
probably not by much. In the last phase of retirement, the dependent phase,
these costs could rise dramatically if you need assistance with the basics of
daily life.
Healthcare costs
Your healthcare costs will likely take a much larger chunk out of your budget.
Before you qualify for Medicare, you probably will be paying all your medical
insurance and expenses out of pocket. Some employers do offer medical
insurance as part of a retirement package, but those benefits can be dropped
at any time. More and more employers are cutting back their retiree health
insurance coverage.
Even after you do qualify for Medicare, you need to pay premiums for
Medicare Part B and Part D. You also will have out-of-pocket costs for
deductibles and co-pays and will likely have additional coverage to pay for
things Medicare doesn’t. I discuss healthcare costs in greater detail in
Chapters 9 (before Medicare) and 10 (after Medicare).
Transportation costs
During the active and passive phases, you will probably be driving yourself
around, so you can budget about the same as you would for the upkeep and
feeding of your car. During the dependent phase, you probably won’t be driv-
ing anymore and will need to plan for public transportation or taxi services,
but you won’t have car expenses.
79
Chapter 6: Managing Your Money So It Doesn’t Run Out

Insurance costs
You probably won’t see a big difference in most of your insurance costs. If
you did run your own business, of course you won’t have to carry business
insurance any more once you’re retired. Health insurance will probably
increase though in retirement.
Leisure and travel costs
Leisure and travel costs will vary greatly in the three phases of retirement.
Initially they will probably be higher than you now spend, but as you age they
will probably drop.
Entertainment
Entertainment costs will likely go up during the active phase, but will likely
drop some during the passive phase, depending on what type of entertain-
ment you enjoy. For example, if most of your entertainment budget is for pur-
chasing movies on DVDs and music on CDs, the budget could remain the
same in the first two phases of retirement.
If you have a big family, you may need to budget for more family gatherings at
your house and the additional costs for food and other expenses to host
those gatherings. In the dependent phase, you probably won’t need to plan
for entertainment.
Hobbies
If you enjoy a hobby, this can take a much bigger chunk of your budget in
retirement because you’ll have much more time to spend on your hobby. You
will need to try to guesstimate your increased hobby budget and may even
need to hold yourself back if you don’t have enough money for all you want
to do.
Pets and plants
Many people will get additional pets during retirement. In fact, studies have
shown over and over throughout the years that seniors are happier and
healthier if they have pets. Plants can also make a room feel more alive. You
should plan for these increased costs in your budget, unless you really hate
both pets and taking care of plants.
Reading materials
If you are an avid reader, you’ll likely read a lot more books during retire-
ment. Plan to increase your budget in this area if reading is one of your 
hobbies.

Debt obligations
Hopefully, by the time you reach retirement you’ve gotten rid of most of your
debt and don’t carry over balances on your credit cards. On a fixed income,
debt becomes more and more of a burden as the basics of life continue to
rise, but your fixed income doesn’t. Most pensions don’t include cost-of-living
raises. Your retirement savings likely will be going down, not up. But, if you
do still have debts to pay, add them to your budget figures.
Donations
You’ll probably cut back on your donations in retirement because you no
longer have the extra cash. If you do still plan to keep up a certain level of
donations, calculate that in your budget as well.
Professional services
Expenses for professional services will vary depending on how much you
have saved. It’s a good idea to work with a financial planner at least in the
beginning of your retirement years to be sure your financial assumptions are
correct and you have come up with a good plan for spending down your
assets. Even if you were good at managing your portfolio before retirement,
managing your money so you don’t run out is a very different skill set. If you
do choose to work with an advisor, be sure you find someone that has experi-
ence managing portfolios for retirees.
You should also review your will and be sure that everything is in order for
your estate. Another thing you may want to consider is working with an attor-
ney to prepare a living will, so your wishes regarding your medical care are
carefully spelled out on paper. That makes it much easier for your family to
carry out your wishes if you are not able to make decisions for yourself.
Savings and investments
Most people don’t add to their savings and investments during retirement.
But if you do plan to work, you may be able to budget for additional savings
and investments.
Taxes
Even in retirement you do have to budget for taxes. I talk about taxes on your
retirement pension and savings in “Dealing with Taxes” later in this chapter.
You won’t have to pay taxes to Social Security and Medicare unless you go
back to work, and then you’ll only have to pay taxes on the money you earn
working.
Most states reduce property taxes and some reduce state income taxes once
you reach retirement age, so be sure you check out tax rules in your state
after you retire. The Retirement Living Information Center maintains a state-
by-state breakdown on taxes at http://www.retirementliving.com/
RLtaxes.html.

Developing a retirement budget
Now that you have a better idea of how to budget in retirement, you might
like to take the time to develop a retirement budget. While no one can know
what inflation will be over the next 20 years, you may want to increase your
numbers by 3 or 4 percent per year to estimate a budget that shows the pos-
sible impact of inflation. Use Table 6-1 to make it easier for you.

TOTAL BUDGET
Planning Your Withdrawal Strategies
After you get an idea of how much you’ll need in retirement (if you don’t
know, check out the section, “Determining Your Budget,” earlier in this chap-
ter), you should figure out how much you can safely withdraw from your
retirement savings portfolio without the possibility of running out of money.
You may have your money sitting in several different types of retirement 
82
Part II: Your Wallet to Your Health: The 411 When You Re-Enter the Workforce 

savings accounts — annuities, IRAs, and traditional pensions. In the following
sections, I review the strategies you need to consider for each of them.
Tracking everything
First, you should set up a chart of all your retirement holdings, so that you
know what you actually have and can calculate your allocation of assets. (I
talk more about asset allocation in Chapter 5. I will show you how asset alloca-
tion impacts the amount you can safely withdraw in retirement in the section
called “Allocating Your Assets and Withdrawing Safely” later in this chapter.)
Make a list of all the retirement savings you hold. For each type of account
you have, you should list:
 Account type: This includes annuities, IRAs, Employee stock plans, pen-
sions, and so on.
 Asset name: Use a name by which you can quickly identify the account
listed.
 Market value: How much you can sell the asset for today. You’ll find that
information on your most current statement for the account.
 Dividends/interest: How much you get in dividends and interest yearly.
 Yearly payout: How much you receive yearly as a payout. This column
will primarily be for pensions and annuities at this point, but as you
start to take withdrawals from IRAs, you can add them here, too.
 Costs to sell: Estimate what your fees or commission would be if you
wanted to sell it. Leave this column blank for now if you don’t know. It’s
not critical unless it’s something you do plan to sell.
 Your cost basis: How much you paid to get this asset and the date you
purchased it. For many of your retirement accounts, you’ll have made
periodic contributions, so just put in the total cost to date. You should
have a total of your contributions and your employer contributions on
your annual statement. For date, put the date you started your retire-
ment savings account with your employer.
 Years held: List the number of years you’ve had the asset.
If you know how to use Microsoft Excel, then it’s best to set this up as a work-
sheet in that program. To give you an example, I set up a worksheet using
Excel in Figure 6-1. The big advantage of starting with a spreadsheet is that
you won’t have to add all the columns, plus you’ll have a working document
you can easily adjust as you move your assets around in retirement. If you
don’t know how to use Excel, you can start a worksheet in the same format
manually, or you can grab Excel 2007 For Dummies or Excel For Dummies,
2nd Edition (both published by Wiley), to help walk you through the process.
83
Chapter 6: Managing Your Money So It Doesn’t Run Out

After pulling together this list, add up your total assets and your total income
from dividends and interest and from yearly payouts. Total assets include all
you have to work with in retirement. You want this principal to last for the
rest of your life. Total dividends and interest and yearly payouts will give you
an idea of how much income your portfolio is generating for you each year.
Exploring what you have
After making this list, you may know what you have, but may not be sure
what these payouts all mean. I briefly review these asset types and how you
receive withdrawals from each.
Annuities
If you own annuities, you can set up your withdrawal options in three differ-
ent ways — single life, joint and survivor, and term certain. You may already
have made this choice when you retired from your company, if your company
rolled out your 401(k) into an annuity. Here’s a more detailed look at the
options:
Figure 6-1:
Sample
worksheet
for tracking
your assets
in retire-
ment.
84
Part II: Your Wallet to Your Health: The 411 When You Re-Enter the Workforce 

 Single life: This option means that you’ll be paid a certain amount for
the rest of your life. This is the best choice for people who are single,
divorced, or widowed and don’t need to worry about income for a
spouse after their death. This type of annuity does offer the highest
payout, but all payouts stop when you die.
 Joint and survivor: With this option, you continue getting payouts
during your life span and the life span of your beneficiary, such as your
spouse. You can designate what percentage your spouse will receive,
such as 50 percent, 75 percent, or 100 percent. Many people make the
mistake of choosing 50 percent thinking that their spouse will only need
half the money after they die. That’s usually not true because living
costs don’t get cut in half when a spouse dies. In fact, medical costs usu-
ally increase, especially if medical bills must be paid off if the person
who died was very sick at the end. Also, medical costs continue to rise
as you age.
 Term certain: You decide the number of years you want an annuity to
last and you’ll get a guaranteed payment for that number of years. This
can be risky if you outlive the term you pick. The one advantage this
option has over single life and joint and survivor payouts is that the
number of years for payout are guaranteed. If you die before that
number has been paid out, your beneficiary gets the rest of the pay-
ments. With the other two types of payouts, once you and your benefi-
ciary die, there is nothing left for any heirs.
Whatever payout decision you make about your annuities cannot be
changed, so choose carefully. If you do consult a financial advisor to plan
your retirement withdrawals, be sure to get his counseling before signing any
withdrawal papers.
If you don’t own an annuity, but think you’d prefer to have someone else
manage your portfolio, you can consider buying a single premium annuity
with your retirement savings. But, be sure you understand all the fees you’ll
be paying and how much you will be guaranteed to receive each month for
the rest of your life. You can find out more about annuities by reading this
excellent article at Kiplinger’s Finance (www.kiplinger.com/personal
finance/basics/archives/2002/04/story25.html).
Traditional pensions
If you are one of the lucky few that still has a traditional pension, your com-
pany will determine your payout amount. Just like with an annuity discussed
above, you will need to select a payout option similar to those available for
an annuity. Your employer will give you information on payout options.
Your yearly statement from your company probably doesn’t give you a total
value for your pension asset, so don’t worry about adding that to the market
value column if you don’t have it.
85
Chapter 6: Managing Your Money So It Doesn’t Run Out

Employee stock purchase plan
If you do hold shares of company stock in some type of stock purchase plan,
you probably do want to sell it as soon as you can without taking a loss.
Many times you can buy company stock at 10 to 15 percent lower than you
can get it on the market, so unless your company lost value significantly, you
probably won’t have a loss with this stock.
You can look at your plan statement to find out how many shares of stock you
hold. To find out its current market value, you’ll need to look up the share
price in your daily newspaper or on the Internet. One easy Web site to work
with to get price quotes online for stock is Yahoo! Finance (www.finance.
yahoo.com). At the top of the page you’ll see a box called “Get Quotes.” Put
in the stock symbol for your company. If you don’t know it, click on “Symbol
Lookup” to find it.
Generally, it’s not safe to hold more than 4 percent of your portfolio’s assets
in any one company. If you’re already getting a pension from that company,
you probably already depend on more than 4 percent of your retirement
income from that company.
To properly allocate your assets, you should sell your company stock to
reduce your holdings to the 4 percent level as soon as you can. You do want
to be careful to avoid a major tax hit when you sell, so be sure to review any
potential sales with your tax advisor first.
IRAs
Most of the retirement cash that you’ll manage individually will be in your
IRAs. These are the funds for which you’ll be making your withdrawal plans
and which can run out if you’re not careful.
As I discuss in Chapter 5, there are numerous types of IRAs. You may even
have several different IRA accounts. You will probably find it easier to roll all
these accounts into one large portfolio. It will be much easier to manage if
the money is all in one place.
But, be careful. If you do have both traditional tax-deductible and non-tax-
deductible IRAs, keep them separate. Also if you have a Roth IRA, do not roll
it into any other type of IRA, you’ll lose the advantages of the Roth. You may
even want to roll some of your traditional IRA money into a Roth IRA because
its funds grow completely tax free. You can take money out of your Roth IRA
without paying any taxes. I talk more about the tax benefits of a Roth IRA
later in this chapter in “Dealing with Taxes.”
86
Part II: Your Wallet to Your Health: The 411 When You Re-Enter the Workforce 

If you do roll traditional IRA money into a Roth IRA, you will have to pay
taxes on the rollover. You can figure out whether or not it’s worth it for you to
consider rolling over your traditional IRAs into a Roth IRA by reading this
excellent article and using the interactive tool at Smart Money.com (http://
www.smartmoney.com/retirement/roth/index.cfm?story=convert).
Allocating Your Assets and 
Withdrawing Safely
In Chapter 5, I talk about how to invest wisely using asset allocation. Now I
want you to look at how to carefully withdraw these funds so you don’t run
out of money. Generally, the rule of thumb most financial advisors give their
clients is that they can safely withdraw 4 percent of their retirement savings
each year and their money will last for their lifetime.
That’s a short and quick rule that does work, but if you need more income
than that from your portfolio, you may want to take a bit more risk with how
you allocate your asset mix. By holding a greater percentage of stocks, you
may be able to withdraw more annually as long as you keep growth stocks in
your portfolio. Sound scary? Well, I’ll guide you through it in the sections that
follow.
Checking out the chart
The chart in Figure 6-2 looks at various asset mixes between stocks and
bonds. It then shows you what percentage you can withdraw based on your
risk tolerance and the number of years you expect to live in retirement.
I grouped withdrawal rates into three risk levels based on your chances of
having enough money throughout your retirement years — 90 to 100 percent
chance that you won’t run out of money, 75 to 90 percent chance, and less
than 50 percent chance that your money will last throughout retirement. I
also developed withdrawal rates based on the number of years you expect to
live in retirement.
I developed the chart you see in Figure 6-2 using data from a study of histori-
cal stock returns over a 70-year period. Stocks historically averaged a return
between 10 and 12 percent, bonds historically averaged a 4 to 6 percent
return, and cash historically averaged 3 percent. I used a 3 percent inflation
rate average for this chart. The withdrawal rates I show you in Figure 6-2 are
adjusted for inflation.
87
Chapter 6: Managing Your Money So It Doesn’t Run Out

Keep these points in mind while using the chart:
 Use MSN Money’s life-expectancy calculator (moneycentral.msn.
com/investor/calcs/n_expect/main.asp) to calculate a life-
expectancy guesstimate and then use that figure to determine the
number of years you’ll live in retirement. If you expect to live more than
30 years in retirement, you probably should choose the safe route and
not increase your withdrawal rate above 4 percent. You may want to
play it safe with 3 percent.
 In looking at the chart, notice that there really isn’t much advantage to
picking an asset mix for your portfolio riskier than 50 percent stocks and
50 percent bonds. But, you can see that if you choose a portfolio with
just 25 percent stocks and 100 percent bonds, you will need to cut the
percentage of your money that you can withdraw each year to 3 percent
if you think you will live about 30 years in retirement. If your asset mix is
100 percent bonds, then you can only withdraw 3 percent of your portfo-
lio if you think you will live 25 years in retirement.

Part II: Your Wallet to Your Health: The 411 When You Re-Enter the Workforce 

 As I discuss in Chapter 5, if you do want to keep growth in your port-
folio, be sure to convert some of your portfolio to cash at least two
years before you’ll need it to be sure you’re not stuck selling stocks 
or bonds during a downturn in the market. You should also be sure to
sell stocks and use the money to invest in bonds when you are about 5
years away from needing it.
By following those two rules, your chances are very good you can avoid
selling any portion of your portfolio at a loss. If five years out the stock
market are down, you have the time to wait out a reversal of a down
market before you’ll need the money. You don’t have to sell stock at
exactly five years. Use the time you have before needing the money to
find the best time to sell and minimize any loss.
Following an example
To show you how to use the chart, I assume a retiree, Nancy, has a retirement
portfolio of $300,000 and expects to live 25 years in retirement. Looking at the
chart, Nancy decides to compare three asset mixes — 50 percent stocks and
50 percent bonds, 25 percent stocks and 75 percent bonds, and 100 percent
bonds.
Nancy decides to take on a bit more risk and use the rate for a 75 to 90 per-
cent chance of not living longer than her assets in order to get a bit more
cash initially. Nancy wants the extra money during the most active phase of
retirement, but may decide to be more conservative as she gets older.
Using the above scenario, Nancy can use a 5 percent withdrawal rate if she
allocates her portfolio with a 50/50 asset mix. She can withdraw only 4 per-
cent of her portfolio annually if she allocates her funds using a 25/75 asset
mix. She can only take out 3 percent per year if she chooses to keep all her
retirement savings in bonds.
Here’s how much she can take out each year using these three scenarios:
50/50 Asset Mix:
$300,000 × .05
=
$15,000
25/75 Asset Mix:
$300,000 × .04
=
$12,000
All Bonds:
$300,000 × .03
=
$9,000
If about five years into retirement, she does decide to be more conservative,
she can always recalculate her withdrawal amount using the 20-year column
and the remaining funds in her portfolio at that time.
89
Chapter 6: Managing Your Money So It Doesn’t Run Out

If you have never managed a portfolio before, don’t try to do this totally on
your own at first. I highly recommend that you work with a financial planner
to put together your strategy for withdrawing your funds. Even if you do have
a lot of portfolio experience, it doesn’t hurt to pay for a few hours of consul-
tation time with a financial planner to be sure your assumptions are correct.
A third-party view from someone who is not as personally involved in the
outcome is always a good idea when you’re making significant financial
choices that will impact your ability to maintain your desired lifestyle in the
future. When looking for a financial advisor, just keep these tips in mind:
 Ask for recommendations from friends.
 Use the resources of the Financial Planning Association to find a good
advisor near your home. Check out its resources, as well as find an advi-
sor at www.fpanet.org/public.
 Be sure that you understand how your financial advisor will be paid. It’s
best to choose someone who is paid a fee for their advice rather than
someone who makes commissions on what they sell. Commission-based
financial advisors do not always have your best interests in mind,
because they are looking to increase their own income by making a sale.
Calculating Whether Your Income 
Is Enough
Now that you have developed your estimated budget, your income from your
annuities and pension plans, and the amount you’ll be able to withdraw from
retirement savings you hold, you can calculate whether you’ll have enough to
live on in retirement by following these steps:
1. Calculate your annual budget needs.
2. Calculate your annual income by adding any annual annuity payouts,
pension payouts, Social Security benefits (if old enough to collect — see
details in Chapter 7), retirement savings withdrawals, and any other
money you expect to have each year.
3. Subtract your budget from your income.
4. Find out whether you have a surplus or a shortfall. If the number is posi-
tive, you do have enough money for retirement. If the number is nega-
tive, you have a shortfall and you’ll need to find some more — most
likely by going out to work.
90
Part II: Your Wallet to Your Health: The 411 When You Re-Enter the Workforce 

If you do have a shortfall, you’re better off correcting the shortfall by taking a
job as soon as possible after retirement. As you get older, it will be more and
more difficult to work. By bringing in extra income, you may be able to
reduce the amount you take out of your retirement savings each year and let
your portfolio grow a bit more. That way you’ll be able to increase your
income in your later years because you’ll be able to withdraw more from
your portfolio.
When you do decide to quit work entirely, you can then recalculate your
annual payouts by considering the number of years left at that time in retire-
ment. Recalculate your withdrawal rate based on your asset mix and number
of years in retirement when you quit.
Dealing with Taxes
Everyone hates to pay taxes. Unfortunately, you do still have to pay them in
retirement. In the following sections, I review how retirement income is taxed.
Taxation of your pensions
Taxation of your pension payout is usually done for you by your company,
just as taxes were taken out of your paycheck while you were working. Most
pensions are taxed based on your current income tax rates. You likely will fill
out a form (or may already have done so) indicating whether to take out
taxes when you pick your pension payout method.
After your first year of receiving your pension payout, work with your tax
advisor to be sure the proper amount is being taken out of your pension. If
not, you can file a form to change the amount of tax you pay. But, you proba-
bly are better off paying any additional taxes needed by filing quarterly esti-
mated tax forms and paying any additional taxes that way.
Paying estimated taxes quarterly gives you more control over any changes
you may need as you move through the various phases of retirement and
your tax deductions change. As you complete your taxes each year, do an
estimation of your income for the next year and recalculate any estimated
taxes you might need to pay.
Most tax advisors do this automatically as part of your income tax prepara-
tion without any additional charge. If you use a tax preparation package and
prepare your own taxes, most tax preparation software for your home com-
puter also will automatically calculate payments for the next year’s quarterly
estimated taxes.
91
Chapter 6: Managing Your Money So It Doesn’t Run Out

Taxation of your retirement savings
Taxation of your retirement savings is much more complicated because
whether you’re taxed depends on the type of retirement savings account you
have. Keep these factors in mind and talk to a tax professional to assess your
needs:
 Most of your accounts will be taxed based on your current income tax
rate. This includes money you withdraw from your traditional IRAs, your
401(k)s, your 403(b)s, and most other employer retirement savings
plans. This will change each year depending on how much income you
draw from your IRAs, how much you are paid through a pension or
annuity, as well as any other income you receive including income you
earn working full- or part-time in retirement.
 If you are old enough to collect Social Security, that adds another com-
plication to the mix. I talk more about Social Security and taxes in
Chapter 7.
 The one exception to the rule in the previous bullet is any funds you
withdraw from a Roth IRA. Money you take out of a Roth IRA will not be
taxed as long as you start taking it out after you reach age 591⁄2.
Another big advantage of the Roth IRA is that you are not forced to take
your money out at any time. You can decide to leave all your money in a
Roth IRA to your heirs if you so choose.
 You will have to take out mandatory distributions of all your other
retirement savings. I talk more about the mandatory distribution rules in
Chapter 5. If you fail to take out enough to meet the IRS mandatory dis-
tribution requirements, you will be taxed 50 percent of any shortfall.

Collecting Social Security and
Going Back to Work
In This Chapter
 Following the Social Security work rules
 Getting less benefits
 Receiving increased benefits
 Taxing complications
You can collect Social Security while you’re working, but if you started
collecting Social Security before you reached your full retirement age,
your benefits may be reduced. The news is not all bad. If you go back to
work, your future Social Security benefits may go up.
In this chapter, I review the Social Security rules about working and collect-
ing. I also discuss how working affects the taxes you might have to pay on
your Social Security benefits.
Working and Collecting
You can collect Social Security and work at the same time, but your Social
Security benefits could be reduced. In this section, I review the rules about
your benefits and work.
Following the rules
Social Security’s rules about collecting and working differ depending on
whether or not you’ve reached full retirement age. That age varies depending
on the year you were born.

Full retirement age for Social Security used to be 65, but under new rules
passed to improve Social Security’s solvency, the age is gradually increasing
to 67. You can find out what your benefits will be by calling the Social Security
Administration and asking for your statement at 1-800-772-1213. (This is the
same statement that is sent to you automatically each year.) You can also
request a statement online at www.socialsecurity.gov. If you’d like to 
calculate your future benefits based on numerous earnings scenarios, you can
use the Social Security Administration’s calculators at www.socialsecurity.
gov/planners/calculators.htm.
Table 7-1 gives you a breakdown of your full retirement age based on your
year of birth.

Figuring benefits if you retire early
As a retiree, the earliest age you can begin to collect Social Security is 62, but
if you start to collect Social Security before your full retirement age, your
benefit amount will be reduced for the rest of your life.
94
Part II: Your Wallet to Your Health: The 411 When You Re-Enter the Workforce 

Table 7-2 shows you the factors you need to consider to calculate the per-
centage by which your benefits will be permanently reduced, if you start col-
lecting benefits before full retirement age. Because full retirement age is
gradually increasing to age 67, notice that the year you were born impacts
the amount your Social Security benefit will be reduced.
For example, if your full retirement age is 65 and you retire at age 62, you
start benefits three years early. But, if your full retirement age is 67, you’ll be
starting benefits five years early.

*Monthly percentage and total reductions are approximate due to rounding. The actual reductions
are .555, or 5⁄9 of 1 percent per month for the first 36 months and .416 or 5⁄12 of 1 percent.
The factor in the column “Monthly Reduction” gives you a way to calculate
your reduction by the number of months you retire early. For example, if your
full retirement age is 66 and you decide to retire at age 63, then the number of
months that you will be retiring early is 36. Use the factor in the Monthly
Reduction column to calculate what your permanent reduction in benefits
will be.
95
Chapter 7: Collecting Social Security and Going Back to Work

Using this example, if your Social Security benefit at full retirement age is sup-
posed to be $1,000 per month, here’s how to do the calculation:
1. Multiply the number of months you will be retiring early by your
monthly reduction factor.
36 months × .520 = 18.72% reduction in benefits
2. Multiply the percentage reduction in benefits.
18.72% × $1,000 = $187.20
3. Subtract the amount of the reduction in benefits from your benefit at full
retirement age.
$1,000 – $187.20 = $812.80
So in the example above, a person whose full retirement age is 66, but who
decides to retire three years early at age 63 will experience an 18.72 percent
reduction in benefits for the rest of his life. If the Social Security benefit was
supposed to be $1,000, instead it will be only $812.80. If you do decide to
retire early, be sure you can live with that reduction in benefits before you
start collecting.
Impacting Your Current Benefits 
by Going Back to Work
When you go back to work after you retired early and already started collect-
ing Social Security, you could end up with reduced benefits. It all depends on
whether you’ve reached your full retirement age.
Understanding the Retired Earnings Test
(RET) basics
If you decide to go back to work before full retirement age, but have already
started collecting Social Security, your benefits will be temporarily reduced
by the Retirement Earnings Test (RET). The designers of Social Security made
this test a requirement because they believed people who went back to back
work should not collect full benefits. Congress changed this rule in 2000.
Today only people who retire before their full retirement age must pass this
test.
96
Part II: Your Wallet to Your Health: The 411 When You Re-Enter the Workforce 

For the purposes of the RET test, only wages that you earn by working out-
side the home or on a part-time basis from home count as income. You don’t
have to include any government or military benefits, investment earnings,
interest, pensions, annuities, or capital gains when calculating income for a
RET test.
Once you reach full retirement age, you can work as much as you like without
impacting your Social Security benefits. There are no earning limitations once
you reach full retirement age.
In changing the rules to allow you to regain your benefits lost because of the
RET, Congress took the position in 2000 that Social Security is something that
you earn by years of work and that these benefits should not be withheld
from people who choose to go back to work for whatever reason once they
reach their full retirement age.
Prior to this change in rules in 2000, 960,000 Social Security beneficiaries
were working and had their benefits reduced by the RET. More than 800,000
of them had already reached their full retirement age. They lost a total of 
$4.1 billion in benefits because of RET rules.
Reviewing the rules
If you go back to work after you start collecting Social Security but before
you reach full retirement age, your Social Security benefits will be reduced
under two levels of RET rules:
 People between ages 62 and the year they reach full retirement age will
have $1 of benefits withheld by Social Security for every $2 earned in
excess of their allowable earnings threshold. The allowable earnings
threshold was $12,480 in 2006. This allowable earnings threshold is
adjusted each year by Social Security based on a formula managed by
Social Security called the national wage index. The new threshold infor-
mation is released in the month of October, prior to the year it will be in
force.
 During the year you reach your full retirement, you will only have $1 of
Social Security benefits withheld for every $3 earned above the allow-
able earnings threshold. The allowable earnings threshold was $33,240
for 2006 and will be adjusted each year by Social Security’s national
wage index.
97

Calculating how much you can lose
Table 7-3 gives you a ballpark estimate of how your earnings will be impacted
if you go back to work before you reach your full retirement age.

To give you an idea of how to calculate your loss of benefits if you retire
early, I created a fictitious scenario of early retiree Lucy who gets a yearly
benefit of $9,600 ($800 per month) and earns $20,000 part-time. Lucy was
born in 1943 and retired at age 62 in 2005. After retiring, she decided to go
back to work. Her full retirement age is 66.
Here is how Lucy would calculate her reduction in benefits:
1. Subtract $12,480 from the amount of earnings above the allowable
threshold.
$20,000 – $12,480 = $7,520
2. Calculate the amount by which the Social Security benefit will be
reduced. Since the benefit reduction is $1 for every $2 earned, you
divide the amount of earnings over the threshold by 2.
$7,520 ÷ 2 = $3,760
3. Subtract the amount by which Lucy’s Social Security benefit will be
reduced from the full benefit amount.
$9,600 – $3,760 =$5,840
98
Part II: Your Wallet to Your Health: The 411 When You Re-Enter the Workforce 

So Lucy’s income for the year will be $5,840 in Social Security benefits and
$20,000 from part-time work for a total of $25,840. If she didn’t go out to work,
her total income would have been $9,600 from Social Security.
Now take a look at what happens to Lucy during the year she reaches full
retirement age, which will be in August 2009. During that year the RET rules
change and she is allowed to make up to $33,240 without impacting her Social
Security benefit.
So even though she hasn’t yet reached full retirement age in her last year
before retirement, she can continue to earn $20,000 and get her full Social
Security benefit of $9,600 for a total $29,600. She can even decide to increase
her earnings by as much as $13,240, for a total of $33,240, and still get all her
Social Security benefits.
Getting special treatment in your 
first year of retirement
Many people who retire early exceed the earnings limit allowed during the
first year, but there are special rules. The RET test for new retirees is based
on a monthly earning amount rather than the total first year amount. That
way if you continue to work at your full salary for the first half of the year and
then retire six months into the year, you can earn a part-time income without
losing all of your Social Security benefits.
For example, suppose Tom earns $60,000 per year and plans to retire in July.
The first six months he will earn $30,000 or $5,000 per month. If he’s only 63,
under the regular RET rules he would have exceeded the maximum allowable
income of $12,480, but luckily that doesn’t apply during the first year he
retires.
Instead, during your first year of retirement, you can use a special RET test
based on a monthly income. For 2006, that monthly allowable income was
$1,040. So as long as Tom doesn’t earn more than $1,040 per month, he 
won’t lose any Social Security benefits even though he earned $30,000 before
retiring.
If he were to earn $2,000 per month, then he would exceed the allowable
income by $960 per month and would lose $1 in Social Security benefits for
every $2 he earns, so his monthly benefit would be reduced by $480.
99
Chapter 7: Collecting Social Security and Going Back to Work

If that special rule was not in place, then the $12,000 he earns in the last six
months of the year plus the $30,000 that he earns in the first six months of
the year would total $42,000. If you subtract $12,480 from $42,000, you find
that he would exceed allowable earnings by $29,520, and $14,760 of his Social
Security benefits would be lost. During a six-month period of collecting 
Social Security, that would be $2,460 per month, which is well above the 
maximum Social Security benefit.
Increasing Benefits When 
You Go Back to Work
If you go back to work after retirement, you may end up with an increase in
your Social Security benefits. This is especially true for people who took a
long break from working during their prime earning years.
For example, a women who took off 15 years to raise a family would not have
earned any income to credit to her Social Security account. Those years
would be counted as $0 earning years.
Social Security calculates your benefit by using your top 35 earning years. 
If 15 of those years are zero-dollar earning years, it can lower your benefit 
significantly.
For example, suppose you earned $30,000 a year for 20 years and $0 a year
for 15 years. Your average earnings per year would be calculated this way:
1. 20 years × $30,000 = $600,000
2. 15 years × $0 = $0
3. 35-year earning history (total of Steps 1 and 2) = $600,000
4. Average earnings per year = $600,000 ÷ 35 = $17,143
Your Social Security benefits would be based on an earnings average of just
$17,143 and result in a much lower benefit amount than you would have
received if you had income of $30,000 for 35 years.
Now, suppose you went back to work for ten years part-time for $20,000 per
year after you started to collect your benefits at age 62. Social Security would
then automatically recalculate your benefits each year that you continued
working. As you replace those $0 earnings years with $20,000 earnings years,
your Social Security benefit would gradually increase.
100
Part II: Your Wallet to Your Health: The 411 When You Re-Enter the Workforce 

Now, I recalculate your average earnings after five years of no earnings and
ten years of part-time earnings of $20,000 in retirement:
1. 20 years × $30,000 = $600,000
2. 5 years × $0 = $0
3. 10 years × $20,000 = $200,000
4. 35-year earning history (total of Steps 1, 2, and 3) = $800,000
5. Average earnings per year = $800,000/35 = $22,857
You can see that your average earnings that Social Security now would use to
calculate your benefit is $22,857, which is $5,714 higher than at age 62 when
you had 15 years of no earnings.
The calculation I just showed you is a simplification of how Social Security
calculates your benefits. During a 35-year work history, there are adjustments
to earnings based on the national wage index. I just wanted to show you how
your benefit amount could be increased by a decision to go back to work in
retirement, especially if you had a lot of zero-dollar work years or very low
earnings years.
Starting Your Own Business 
and Social Security Benefits
If you are thinking of working from home and starting your own business,
that too could mean that you would be subject to the RET test, but it’s differ-
ent for people who are self employed. Self-employed people must include any
income earned if they performed substantial services in their business.
So what does substantial really mean? Social Security measures whether or
not someone has performed substantial services by the number of hours
spent on one’s business. If you work 45 hours or more per month on your
own business, that is considered substantial and any money earned could
reduce benefits.
If you work fewer than 15 hours per month, you are considered fully retired.
Time spent working on your own business between 15 and 45 hours per
month may or may not count depending on your occupation and size of your
business.
101
Chapter 7: Collecting Social Security and Going Back to Work

If you do want to start your own business and work part-time before you
reach full retirement age, be sure you sit down with a Social Security claims
representative and review your plans to find out if you could lose benefits
based on self-employed RET rules. The Social Security claims representative
can let you know how your benefits might be impacted by your business
plans.
When calculating how much income to claim from your business, you would
use your net income figure after you subtract all your business expenses. You
do not have to use your total gross sales figure, which would be the total
income you take into the business from sales. Everyone who runs a business
has some expenses they can use to reduce their gross sales number.
Complicating Your Taxes
If you do go back to work after retirement, you will be complicating the way
you must file your income taxes. You also could end up paying more taxes on
your Social Security benefits.
Your total income from earnings, Social Security, pensions, and retirement
savings withdrawals could kick you up into a higher tax bracket. Here is a
review of tax implications of going back to work after retirement when col-
lecting Social Security.
How Social Security benefits are taxed
Each year that you collect Social Security, you have to determine whether
your Social Security benefits are taxable. You do this by comparing your
actual income to the base amount of income you can make without owing
additional income taxes.
To calculate the amount you must compare to the base amount, you must
include one-half of your Social Security benefits in the calculation plus all
other income including pensions, interest, retirement savings withdrawals,
and capital gains.
What is the base amount? That depends on how you file your taxes. Here is
the base amount you are allowed without paying taxes on your Social
Security:
 $25,000 if you are single, head of household, or qualifying (widow)
 $25,000 if you are married filing separately and living apart from your
spouse during the current tax year.
102
Part II: Your Wallet to Your Health: The 411 When You Re-Enter the Workforce 

 $32,000 if you are married and filing jointly.
 $0 if you are married filing separately and you lived with your spouse at
any time during the current tax year.
When you compare your total income to the base amount, if the total income
exceeds your base amount, your Social Security benefits will be taxed. If you
file a joint return, you and your spouse must combine your incomes and ben-
efits when you do this comparison.
Even if your spouse is not yet collecting benefits, you must add in your
spouse’s income when trying to determine whether or not your Social
Security benefits will be taxed.
If the only income you receive is from Social Security, your benefits most
likely will not be taxable. You may not even have to file a tax return. If you do
have income in addition to Social Security, you will have to file an income tax
return even if you don’t owe any money.
Calculating your income
The IRS has worksheets for everything and, yes, there is even one to help you
figure out whether your Social Security income will be taxed. (Your Social
Security benefits will be reported on form SSA-1099, by the way.) In this sec-
tion, I not only walk you through the calculation, but I also give you some
examples as well as tips on avoiding a tax bill come April.
Figuring out if your benefits are taxable
Use the following steps for the calculation to determine if your Social
Security benefits are taxable:
1. Write in the amount from box 5 on all of your SSA-1099s. Include the
full amount of any lump-sum payments received in 2006. If you are a rail-
road retiree, you will get a similar form called RRB-1099.
2. Enter one half of the amount on line A.
3. Add your taxable pensions, wages, interest, dividends, and other tax-
able income and write in the total.
4. Write in any tax-exempt interest (such as interest from municipal
bonds), plus any exclusions from income.
5. Add lines B, C, and D and write in the total.
103
Chapter 7: Collecting Social Security and Going Back to Work

When calculating income, you must include wages and any other compensa-
tion you receive for services. You also must include interest, dividends, rents
from any rental property, royalties, income from partnerships, estate and
trust income, gains from sales or exchanges of assets, and business income
of all kinds.
Compare the total you get using the steps above to the base amounts allowed
according to your tax filing status. If your total (Step 5) equals or is less than
the base amount for your filing status, then none of your Social Security ben-
efits are taxable for that year. If your total in Step 5 is more than your base
amount, then some of your Social Security benefits may be taxable.
If your income exceeds the base amount, then 50 percent of your Social
Security benefits will be taxable. Now that does not mean you will pay 50 per-
cent of your benefits in taxes. What it does mean is that 50 percent of your
Social Security benefits must be added as income when filing your 1040 form
with the IRS. This amount will then be taxed at your current income tax rate.
This will be true until your income exceeds $34,000 if you are single or
$44,000 if you are married and filing jointly.
Once your joint income tops $44,000 or your single income tops $34,000,
more than 50 percent of your Social Security benefits will be taxable at your
current tax rate, and the amount taxable can go as high as 85 percent
depending on how much you are earning. But, remember, that’s taxable bene-
fits, not the amount you are taxed. The amount you are taxed will depend on
your current income tax rate.
For example, suppose married couple Tom and Judy added up all their
income, which included $12,000 in Social Security for Tom and $10,000 in
Social Security for Judy for a total of $22,000 from Social Security benefits.
Tom also earned an additional $20,000 from a part-time job.
To calculate the amount to compare to the base amount, they would need to
use one-half of their total Social Security benefits, which would be $11,000
($22,000/2) plus $20,000 in part-time income. So their total income would be
$31,000. The base amount allowed for a married couple filing jointly is
$32,000, so their Social Security income would not be taxed.
Checking your status
Income tax rates vary depending on your filing status and income earned.
They range from 10 percent to 35 percent. Just to give you an idea of how 
to find your tax rate, Table 7-4 is an example income tax table for a couple
filing jointly. Use the IRS Web site www.irs.gov/formspubs/article/
0,,id=150856,00.html to find the most current tax rates.
104

Table 7-4

$188,450
$336,550
no limit
$91,043 plus 35% of the amount over
$336,550
So, you can see from this chart, as long as your total income is below $15,100,
you only need to pay a 10 percent tax on your income. Income over $15,100 is
taxed at a 15 percent rate until your income exceeds $61,300. If you work
during retirement and have a total income of more than $61,300, you would
then be kicked up into the 25 percent tax bracket.
Avoiding a tax bill
Okay, so you can’t avoid the tax bill altogether, but if you prefer not to be
stuck with a tax bill at tax time, you can request that the federal government
take more income taxes out of your Social Security benefits. You do that by
filing form W-4V with the IRS, which is similar to the W-4 forms you filed when
you were working. You can download this form at http://www.irs.gov/
pub/irs-pdf/fw4v.pdf.
Another route, which I recommend, is that you file quarterly estimated taxes
rather than asking the government to take additional money out of your
Social Security check. You can do that by downloading the instructions and
forms from the IRS Web site at http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/
f1040es.pdf.
The reason you are better off using the estimated tax method is that you con-
trol the amount of additional taxes you want to pay each quarter. Your
income situation could change during the year and it is a lot easier to adjust
your quarterly payment than it is to get the government to change the
amount it is taking out of your Social Security check.
105
Chapter 7: Collecting Social Security and Going Back to Work

Taxes on pensions and retirement 
savings when collecting
I discussed taxes on pensions and retirement savings in Chapter 6. The way
that you calculate how much you’ll pay in taxes on the money you get from
your pensions or retirement savings does not change whether or not you are
collecting Social Security. What does change is that if you do get a pension,
plus take more of out of your retirement savings, you could end up kicking
yourself over the line and being forced to pay taxes on your Social Security
benefits or having to pay a larger percentage of taxes on those benefits.
As you plan the amount you want to withdraw from your retirement savings,
consider what impact that amount might have on your Social Security bene-
fits. Follow the steps in the section “Figuring out if your benefits are taxable”
above to compare the income you plan to take out with the base amount you
are allowed based on your filing status. If you can avoid paying taxes on your
Social Security benefits, you will save money and it might be enough so that
you don’t need to draw as much from your savings.
For example, suppose you and your wife have a total of $20,000 a year in
Social Security benefits. You plan to take out $23,000 per year from your
retirement savings. You will then have to pay income tax on one-half of the
$20,000 Social Security benefit. In the following sections, I compare how your
taxes may be impacted below if you take only $22,000 and avoid paying taxes
on your Social Security benefits versus taking out $23,000 and paying taxes.
Scenario one — Taking out $22,000 and avoiding taxes on benefits
In calculating your comparison income amount, you would use $22,000 in
retirement savings income plus $10,000 in Social Security benefits (remember
you only use 1⁄2 of your Social Security benefits for this calculation) for a total
of $32,000. Your base income allowed as a married couple filing jointly is
$32,000. So your Social Security benefits would not be taxable.
Income tax would be based on the $22,000 retirement savings income only.
You can then claim a standard exemption of $3,200 for each of you plus a
standard deduction of $10,000 as a couple, which means you could subtract
$16,400 from $22,000. That means your income would be only $5,600 and
your taxes would be only $560 ($5,600 x 10%).
Scenario two — Taking out $23,000 and paying taxes on benefits
In this scenario, your total income for comparison would be $33,000 ($13,000
from retirement savings and $20,000), which means you exceed your allow-
able base amount by $1,000.
106
Part II: Your Wallet to Your Health: The 411 When You Re-Enter the Workforce 

In this scenario, you do have to include 1⁄2 of your Social Security benefits
when calculating income for income tax purposes. Income tax would be
based on $23,000 retirement savings plus $10,000 (half of your Social Security
benefit) for a total income of $33,000 that is taxable.
You can subtract $3,200 in exemptions for each of you plus $10,000 for a 
standard deduction for a total of $16,400, so your taxable income would be
$16,600. You would have to pay $1,510 plus 15 percent of the amount over
$15,100 or $1,500, which is an additional $225. So your total tax bill would be
$1,735 ($1,510 + $225).
So you can see if you’re sitting on the edge of whether or not your Social
Security benefits will be taxable, test to see if it’s worth taking out the addi-
tional money. As you can see from this example, taking out that extra $1,000
resulted in an extra $1,175 in taxes ($1,735–$560).
What isn’t taxed?
Believe it or not there are some types of income you can get in retirement
that will not be taxed. These include the following:
 Compensation for sickness or injury (such as workers compensation) is
not taxable.
 Benefits you collect from an accident or health-insurance policy are not
taxable as long as you paid the premiums or the premiums paid by your
employer were included in your gross income.
 Payments from long-term care insurance companies generally are not
taxable.
 Life insurance proceeds paid after the death of an insured person are
not taxable unless the policy was turned over for a price.
 Veterans’ benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs are not
included in gross income.
 Payments you receive from a state fund as a victim of a crime should not
be included in your income, but you cannot deduct as medical expenses
any expenses reimbursed by the fund.
 Some government benefit programs designed to help the elderly cope on
a fixed income are not included as gross income. For example, benefits
from the Nutrition Program for the Elderly would not be included when
calculating your income.

Delaying Social Security 
and Working
In This Chapter
 Collecting pensions and working
 Saving after retirement
 Increasing Social Security by delaying
 Knowing when to stop delaying
You decided to retire from your job, or maybe you were offered an early
retirement package, but want to keep working elsewhere. You’ve got 
lots of decisions to make regarding how to handle your retirement nest egg
while still working. If you are eligible for Social Security, you’re probably won-
dering whether you should start collecting or delay collecting until you stop
working.
In this chapter, I explore the issues of what to do with your employer-based
pension and savings plans, if you continue to work after you’ve left where
your funds are still being held. I also discuss how you should figure out when
you can and should start collecting your Social Security benefits. And because
new pension legislation has begun to change the rules by which traditional
pensions were governed, I take you through the old and new rules for pen-
sions so you can better understand how you may be affected by the change.
Taking a Look at Pension Legislation
If you’re thinking of going back to work for your company part-time or as a
consultant or independent contractor after you retire, be sure you can do
that at the same time as you’re collecting your retirement pension. Most com-
panies don’t allow their retirees who are collecting pensions to work for them
in any capacity.

Companies don’t discriminate against you by not letting you come back to
work for them. Numerous federal tax and pension rules made it difficult, if
not impossible for companies to hire people to whom they are paying tradi-
tional pension benefits if those people are younger than the pension plan’s
normal retirement age. However, Congress changed these pension rules
through the Pension Protection Act of 2006 passed in August, but because no
one can determine how quickly each company will begin to change its rules
based on the new legislation, you need to understand your pension’s past as
well as its future.
Checking out the past on pensions
The rules that made it difficult for a company to hire people who are younger
than the pension plan’s normal retirement age but to whom it is paying tradi-
tional pension benefits can be found in the two key laws that govern aspects
of traditional pension plans, as well as in the tax codes.
The two key laws are
 ERISA (Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974): This law
governs the operation of most employee benefit plans including tradi-
tional pensions as well as employee retirement savings plans, such as
401(k)s.
 ADEA (Age Discrimination in Employment Act): This prohibits discrim-
ination in employment. The law governs early retirement benefits and
voluntary early retirement incentive plans.
Rules developed based on these laws made it nearly impossible for compa-
nies to rehire workers who retired early and then wanted to come back to
work. The rules mandated by ERISA and ADEA were eased somewhat with
passage of the Pension Protection Act of 2006. Under this law, companies will
be able to pay employees age 62 or older a partial pension if they decide to
stay on the job part time. Employees who are younger than 62 and receive a
pension from the company still can’t work for that company.
The barriers in place prior to the 2006 pension law that prevented you from
working for a company from which you receive a pension included the 
following:
 Tax rules required that a person separate from his employer to be legiti-
mately considered retired. If pension benefits are paid before the
employee is separated, severe penalties could be imposed and the tax-
qualified status of the pension plan could be at risk. The problem was
that the IRS had never put out a rule specifying how long an employee
must be separated from a company to be considered legitimately retired.
110
Part II: Your Wallet to Your Health: The 411 When You Re-Enter the Workforce 

 ERISA rules created problems for companies that rehired employees.
These companies ran the risk of losing the tax-qualified status of their
retirement plans, which would hurt all employees as well as the company.
 Rehiring workers could cross paths with ADEA rules involving voluntary
early retirement. The ADEA rules were meant to protect workers from
age discrimination and being forced out against their will with early
retirement packages.
 Some companies put their employees on an independent contractor
status after they’ve retired, but the way the work is designed after retire-
ment doesn’t actually fit the definition of an independent contractor. If
the IRS questions the designation, severe tax penalties are possible.
Companies don’t pay benefits or Social Security taxes for independent
contractors. The IRS could require the company to pay back taxes 
and back benefits if an employee is paid as an independent contractor
incorrectly.
Looking to the future
After you reach age 62 or older, these rules will no longer be a barrier to your
being rehired by your old company once the 2006 pension law is fully in place
(see the section earlier in this chapter, “Checking out the past on pensions,”
for more info on the pre-2006 legislation rules). If you decide you do want to
continue working for that company part-time or as a consultant or indepen-
dent contractor, the new rules based on the 2006 law should make this possi-
ble. (I discuss more about going back to work for your old company in
Chapters 15 and 16.)
If you are retiring in the next couple of years, 2007 to 2009, you may find the
barriers are still in place at your company. The Pension Protection Act was
signed into law in August of 2006 and the rules based on that law still had to
be written while I was working on this book.
I don’t know exactly what the rules will say or when the new rules will be
available for companies that want to design programs for their workers to
return after retirement. Once the companies get those rules, they will then
have to work within their own corporate structure to change the rules inter-
nally that govern their retirement plans, as well as rules that govern employ-
ees that want to come back to work.
All this rule changing could take some time to work through the system. I
can’t predict how fast companies will change their rules, which of course will
vary company to company.
111
Chapter 8: Delaying Social Security and Working

Some companies are actively rehiring workers through temporary agencies
or consulting firms. That was how they skirted the rules mentioned above.
The temporary agency or consulting firm officially hired and paid the person,
who was then contracted back to the company after retirement.
Companies with systems already in place to rehire workers after retirement
likely will move more quickly to revise their rules to match what will now be
allowed under the 2006 pension law. They could decide to continue doing
business with the outside companies or they could decide to bring all hiring
back inside the company.
If they rehire workers directly, then they have to pay benefits, which they
don’t have to pay if they hire the workers through an outside firm. So, if you
do work for a company that has established a rehire program through an out-
side temporary agency or consulting firm, you may not see any changes.
Going the way of dinosaurs
Traditional pensions are rapidly becoming extinct, and the new pension law
likely will hasten their demise. The new law does give companies incentives
to freeze or close their pension plans as well as automatically enroll employ-
ees into 401(k) plans. The following sections cover the ins and outs of these
possibilities.
Freezing pension plans
When a company freezes a plan, it can be a hard freeze (no additional enroll-
ments allowed [no new employees qualify] and no more accrual of benefits)
or a soft freeze (all new employees are locked out of the plan).
Major companies announced freezes of their pension plans as final passage of
the new bill was being considered or shortly after it was signed into law.
Some big names in this group include IBM, Verizon, Motorola, and Hewlett
Packard. Delta Air Lines and Northwest followed suit soon after as they
worked their way out of bankruptcy. DuPont announced within days after the
bill was signed that it would cut all contributions to its pension plan and
instead increase contributions to its employee retirement savings plans.
Why are companies rushing to drop their pension obligations to long-term
employees who were counting on these pensions in retirement? People are
living longer, so the costs of providing this benefit continues to increase. Any
shortfalls a company has in meeting its pension obligations must be sub-
tracted from a company’s net worth under the new law. That could negatively
impact a company’s market value (stock price), as well as make it more
expensive for the company to borrow money.
112
Part II: Your Wallet to Your Health: The 411 When You Re-Enter the Workforce 

Also, according to provisions in the new law, most companies must fund their
pension plans 100 percent by 2017. Some companies in bankruptcy, such as
the major airlines, have an additional seven years to fully fund their plans.
Estimates are that private pension plans are underfunded by $300 billion to
$450 billion. Rather than try to make up this shortfall, many companies will
instead just freeze their pensions.
Getting automatically enrolled in a 401(k)
Through the new pension legislation, companies also got the green light to
automatically enroll employees into a 401(k). So if you take a new job with a
company that has a 401(k), some portion of your salary will likely be taken
out for your company’s retirement savings plan. If you are earning too little
and can’t afford the deduction, you will have to opt out of the 401(k) in most
companies after this law is fully in place.
Why is automatic enrollment a good thing? Many people never get around to
enrolling in their 401(k). They end up having very little saved for retirement.
The powers that be hope that by making enrollment in an employer-sponsored
retirement plan automatic, people will be less likely to make the effort to opt
out and more people will save for retirement.
The new law also opens the doors for companies to provide investment 
advisors to their employees. These advisors will primarily represent the
firms that are handling the savings programs, usually mutual fund compa-
nies, insurance companies, or other types of financial institutions. Some are
concerned that the advisors will not be independent enough and may steer
people to mutual funds or other investments that will make more money for
the financial company giving the advice. The choices may not be what’s best
for the employee.
If your company does offer you access to a financial advisor for your
employer-sponsored retirement, check out the advisor’s background. You
may be better off finding your own independent advisor rather than working
with someone who stands to make a profit from his advice.
Understanding the fate of your funds
How does the new legislation impact you if you’ve already left the company?
That depends on the financial state of your pension fund. If the company’s
pension funds are in serious trouble and are less than 60 percent funded, you
will not be able to get a lump sum of your pension obligation. To avoid being
locked out of your funds, you may want to take a lump sum rather than risk
the possibility that your company’s funds may fall below this threshold.
113
Chapter 8: Delaying Social Security and Working

How will you know whether your company’s pension plan is in danger? The
2006 law requires companies to report the financial health of their pension
plans to all its pension plan beneficiaries within 120 days after the end of the
fiscal year. If you do have funds sitting in a pension plan at a company you no
longer work for, ask to get a copy of this report.
If your former company’s pension fund is short of being 100 percent funded,
read carefully what it intends to do to meet the requirements. You may find it
difficult to interpret the report. If you’re not sure what it says, contact your
accountant or financial advisor and get a good explanation of the company’s
pension plan prospects.
Rolling out your funds into a retirement portfolio you manage or one that is
managed by your financial advisor may be a better option for you. You may
find that there is less risk in having total control over the funds than letting
them stay in a company fund that is in trouble. Not all pensions are set 
up with provisions that allow you to take the money as a lump sum, but 
most are.
You will need to check with your company’s benefits coordinator in charge of
retirement issues to find out the policies that govern your company’s retire-
ment plan. If there is a provision within your pension fund agreement that
allows you to take a lump sum, and you question the solvency of your com-
pany’s pension fund, you’re safest bet is to roll the funds into a IRA. You cer-
tainly don’t want to wait around until your company falls below 60 percent
and you can no longer get your money out.
114
Part II: Your Wallet to Your Health: The 411 When You Re-Enter the Workforce 
Major changes for retired public service workers
Policemen, firemen, teachers, and other public
service workers will have more options for
going back to work under the 2006 pension law.
Public safety workers, who frequently retire at
age 50 years or earlier, will no longer be penal-
ized for collecting their early retirement bene-
fits between the ages of 50 and 55. Under the old
law, these public safety workers had to pay a 10
percent penalty if they started to collect their
pensions before age 55. Many public safety
workers stay on the job 20 years and retire,
which can often be when they are in their mid-
40s. Now they only have to wait until age 50 to
start collecting their pension without a penalty.
The new law made it easier for all public service
employees to buy back lost years in order to
collect a full pension. For example, if a teacher
taught in a public school system for 15 years
and then moved to a private school system for
five years, she could buy back the five years lost
in the public system to qualify for a 20-year pen-
sion. For many public retirement systems, pen-
sions are significantly lower for people who
worked less than 20 years. Money saved in a
403(b) plan can be used to buy back these
years.

Retiring Early — Not Eligible 
to Collect Social Security
If you’ve spent 25 to 30 years with one company or as a public servant with a
state or federal government agency, you may end up retiring well before you
reach the age of 62, (which for most people is the earliest age you can start
collecting your Social Security benefits).
Although you probably have some form of retirement benefits from your
former employer, you may or may not be able to collect them. Some compa-
nies require you to reach full retirement age (whatever age that company
sets) before allowing you to collect any retirement money. Others allow you
to get benefits at a significantly reduced level if you want to start collecting
early. Still others, who want to reduce their payroll expenses, encourage
higher-paid workers to retire with attractive early retirement packages.
You have a lot of decisions to make about how to be paid your retirement
pension (if you are eligible for one) and how to manage your retirement sav-
ings over which you likely will have full control (such as funds from your
401(k) or other employer-sponsored retirement savings plan).
You will also need to manage your retirement savings portfolio to be sure you
don’t run out of funds. I talk more about managing retirement portfolios in
Chapter 5.
Taking pensions while still 
working for your company
If you are one of the lucky few who are eligible to collect money from your
company’s pension plan (only about 30 percent of people retiring from pri-
vate companies in 2007 have traditional pensions), you do have to decide
whether or not you want to take them early (before full retirement age). You
also must decide how you want to be paid those funds from your company. 
I talk more about the options for pension payments and managing with-
drawals in Chapter 6.
Trying out retirement part-time
The new pension law did give the green light for companies to allow employ-
ees who are at least 62 years old take a partial pension payout and stay on
the job part-time. If you are younger than 62, you probably will not be able to
go back to work directly for the company from which you just retired. (I dis-
cuss the new pension law in-depth in the section, “Taking a Look at Pension
Legislation,” earlier in this chapter.)
115
Chapter 8: Delaying Social Security and Working

You will need to find out if the company is hiring ex-employees through a
third party. I talk more about how to find that out in Chapters 15 and 16.
What the new law does do is open the door for what many people call a
phased retirement program, where you can collect a partial pension and con-
tinue working part-time. I talk more about phased retirement programs and
how they work in Chapter 15.
Withdrawing a lump sum
When you leave your job, but are not ready to stop working, you may decide
you want to take the lump sum value of your traditional pension plan. Not all
companies allow you to do this, but some do.
If your company does allow you take a lump sum, you will need to be fully
vested (have worked long enough to earn the right to take out 100 percent of
the funds) to get the full cash value of your pension. Should you decide to
take out your pension funds in one lump sum, you should then roll out the
funds into an Individual Retirement Account to avoid taxes and penalties.
Don’t just spend it! If you spend it, you risk running out of money during
retirement (when you finally do decide to stop working). You will also have to
pay hefty tax penalties if you spend it rather than roll it into a qualified IRA.
You’ll have to pay a 10 percent penalty for any funds you withdraw and spend
before you reach the age of 591⁄2. In addition, you will have to pay tax on the
money you withdraw at your current income tax rate no matter what age 
you are.
Given that your pension fund will likely total hundreds of thousands of 
dollars, you will be hit with taxes at the highest tax bracket — 35 percent.
Adding the 10 percent penalty plus 35 percent in income taxes, your total tax
hit would be 45 percent. That means almost half of the money in your retire-
ment pension would be lost to the government in the form of income taxes
and penalties.
You will not have to pay the penalties if you spend the lump sum immedi-
ately, but are already older than 591⁄2. But either way, you will have to pay the
income taxes.
Seeking help if you do take the money
The total amount in your pension fund will be a large sum of money.
Complicated financial calculations of present cash value can dramatically
impact how much you get, so seek financial advice from an independent
accountant or financial advisor who you know is looking out for your best
interest. Your company will be looking to save money and minimize how
much it pays to you.
116
Part II: Your Wallet to Your Health: The 411 When You Re-Enter the Workforce 

An independent financial advisor can review the calculation as well as your
company’s pension payout rules and help you determine whether it is better
for you to leave the money in the pension fund or take a lump sum. If you
don’t know an advisor, get recommendations from friends.
You can also find a certified financial planner at the Financial Planning
Association (http://www.fpanet.org/public/). There you will find
basic information about the planning process, as well as a search tool to find
a planner near your home.
Withdrawing employer retirement savings
When you leave your job, you’re usually offered the options to keep your
401(k) or other employer retirement savings in the account managed by your
employer, or you can roll those funds into your own individual retirement
account (IRA) and manage them yourself. Whether or not you do that
depends on the investments permitted in your employer retirement savings
plans.
You may find that the options are limited and you’re stuck with a large por-
tion of your 401(k) in your company’s stock. The options offered may not
give the opportunity to properly diversify your retirement portfolio. Luckily
in the new pension law, companies are required to let you sell company stock
much sooner and convert it to a different type of investment that will give
you more diversity.
I talk more about proper asset allocation in Chapter 5. If you don’t like your
investment options in your employer retirement savings plan, then you
should definitely roll the funds out into an IRA and pick your own invest-
ments or have a financial advisor help you do so if you don’t know much
about managing a portfolio.
If you do decide to take out your retirement savings, don’t spend them. You
will have to pay a 10 percent penalty if you withdraw funds before the age 
of 591⁄2.
Continuing to save
If you retire early and take another job, you may be earning enough so you
can continue to save. If so, the following sections give you some ideas on the
best vehicles to put your savings in.
117
Chapter 8: Delaying Social Security and Working

Catching up on IRA contributions
After the age of 50, the government allows you to do what are called catch-up
contributions. That means you can save even more money in a traditional or
Roth IRA than someone under the age of 50.
The new pension legislation not only affected the rules for pension funds, it
also made permanent many of the rules that let older workers save more.
These catch-up contributions can be critical, especially if your retirement
savings fall short of what you’ll need to live comfortably in retirement.
The savings rules allow you to put $4,000 into an IRA in 2007. It will increase
to $5,000 in 2008 and then be adjusted by inflation after that. People who are
50 years old can benefit by additional contributions that are allowed just for
them. If you are 50 or older, you can add an additional $1,000. If the new law
hadn’t passed in time, your contributions to IRAs would have dropped back
to just $2,000 per year in 2010.
If you are working for a company that has a 401(k) or other qualified
employee retirement savings plans, there are catch-up contributions avail-
able for those plans too that were made permanent under the new law. In
401(k) plans, all workers can contribute up to $15,000 annually. Workers 
who are 50 and older can also contribute an additional catch-up contribution
of $5,000.
If the change in law had not been made, you would have lost the ability to
make catch-up contributions. Also, the maximum you could put into an
employer-sponsored retirement savings plan would have gone back to
$13,000 in 2011.
Taking credit if you don’t earn much
Many people who decide to go back to work after retiring earn considerably
less than they did when they were working full-time. If you do take a job at
which you are not earning much, you may become eligible for the Saver’s
Credit. This is another benefit for retirement savers that was made perma-
nent in the new pension law.
Lower and middle-income taxpayers can qualify for this credit based on the
amount they put into a qualified retirement savings account. This includes
both an IRA and an employer’s qualified retirement savings plan. The tax
credit can be subtracted from your income tax bill.
A tax credit can be a more powerful tool than a tax deduction. That’s because
a tax deduction is subtracted from your taxable income. Then you calculate
your taxes based on the lower income. A tax credit is subtracted from the tax
due amount and lowers your tax bill directly.
118
Part II: Your Wallet to Your Health: The 411 When You Re-Enter the Workforce 

You are eligible for the Saver’s Credit if your adjusted gross income is $25,000
or less for singles ($50,000 or less for married couples). These adjusted gross
income figures will be adjusted for inflation beginning in 2007. So expect the
maximum allowable salary to increase.
If you do qualify, you may be eligible for a deduction as much as 50 percent of
the first $2,000 you deposit in a retirement savings account. The IRS provides
a worksheet with your Form 1040 filing instructions to help you figure your
tax credit.
This gives your contribution to a tax deductible IRA double power to reduce
your tax bill. You can use the amount you contributed into your IRA as a
deduction to lower your gross income tax. Plus you can use it to figure the
Saver’s Credit you’ll be allowed.
Delaying Benefits — 
Deciding Not to Collect
You can start collecting Social Security when you reach age 62, but your ben-
efits will be reduced significantly and this reduction is something you must
live with for the rest of your life.
You can find out more information about the reduction and how to calculate
that in Chapter 7. I also talk about collecting Social Security and working in
that chapter.
In this section, I focus on the benefits of continuing to work and not collect-
ing Social Security. This can improve your ultimate Social Security benefit
and give you more money every month throughout your retirement years.
Improving future Social Security benefits
You can improve your monthly Social Security benefits in three ways if you
delay collecting your benefits beyond age 62 (the age when you first become
eligible for benefits):
 Your benefits won’t be reduced as much the closer you get to your full
retirement age. I discuss the rules related to collecting Social Security
early in Chapter 7.
119
Chapter 8: Delaying Social Security and Working

 Continue to work and delay retirement. Your benefits may actually
increase, especially if you had some years in your 35-year work record
when you made no money or very little money. By continuing to work,
you can replace these very low or zero-dollar earning years with higher
earnings.
Social Security uses your 35 highest-earning years to calculate your
Social Security benefit. If some of your work history includes years where
you did not earn any money or years where your income was very low,
the money you earn after retiring, but before you start collecting Social
Security, can help to improve the amount you will end up collecting.
 Work past your full retirement age. Your benefits could increase even
more if you decide to continue working past your full retirement age.
The amount you can collect from Social Security goes up each year that
you wait.
Whenever you work, you must pay into Social Security. Your employer
matches your contribution. Each quarter (a quarter is three months of
the year), your employer reports your earnings to Social Security. So if
you continue to work, your work record just gets longer. It can never
hurt you, but it might help you.
For example, suppose you stayed home to raise a family for 15 years and
didn’t earn any money. In this scenario, about 40 percent of your work his-
tory could be $0 earnings years. If you continue working after retirement,
those zero dollar earnings years will be replaced gradually, increasing the
amount you will be able to collect when you do decide to take Social Security.
Once you do start collecting Social Security, if you continue working, your
benefit amount is automatically adjusted each year and improves your earn-
ings history. You don’t need to do anything. Social Security will adjust it
based on earnings reported by your employer.
Understanding the benefit 
of delaying benefits
The biggest benefit of waiting past your full retirement age to collect Social
Security is that each year that you wait, your benefit will go up between 6 and
8 percent, depending on when you were born. Table 8-1 shows you what your
yearly increase will be by year of birth.
120
Part II: Your Wallet to Your Health: The 411 When You Re-Enter the Workforce 

Table 8-1
Social Security Benefit Increases 
for Delayed Retirement

Yearly Rate of Increase
Monthly Rate of Increase
1935-1936
6.0%
1⁄2 of 1%
1937-1938

7⁄12 of 1%
1941-1942
7.5%
5⁄8 of 1%
1943 or later
8%
2⁄3 of 1%
The percentage of benefit increase differs by year of birth because full retire-
ment age is gradually increasing to age 67 from age 65. People who can retire
at age 65 will have 5 years to accrue additional benefits, while people who
can retire at 67 will have only three years to benefit from waiting.
So what does this mean for someone born in 1943 whose full retirement age
is 66 (Chapter 7 has a chart that shows the change in retirement ages by year
of birth.), but decides to wait until 70? Each of the four years the person
waits after the age of 66 will result in a benefit increase of 8 percent.
To show you how much waiting can help you, I used the Social Security Web
site’s benefits calculator to find the benefits for a fictitious retiree named
Sally. She earned an average of $30,000 per year during her 35-year work 
history.
Sally was born in 1944, so she could start collecting benefits as early as 2006
at age 62. She could also decide to wait until 2010, when she will reach full
retirement age. Or she could put it off until 2014 when she will be 70. Here are
her three options in today’s dollars according to the Social Security benefits
calculator (www.ssa.gov/planners/calculators.htm):
Sally at age 62 = $684
Sally at age 66 = $955
Sally at age 70 = $1,320
You can see that by waiting until she is 70 rather than collecting early at age
62, her monthly benefit will be $636 more, almost double what she could
have gotten at age 62. If you haven’t saved enough for retirement, this can
certainly go a long way to helping you make ends meet.
121
Chapter 8: Delaying Social Security and Working

Social Security benefits do increase each year based on the cost of living,
called the COLA (cost of living adjustment). Social Security announces the
amount of the COLA increase for the next year in October of the previous
year. For example, in October 2007, the COLA increase will be announced for
January 2008.
Unfortunately, at the same time the COLA is announced, Social Security also
usually announces the premium increase for Medicare Part B. Often this
increase is about the same amount as the COLA, so your Social Security
check won’t change by much when you start collecting. I talk more about
Medicare and its costs in Chapter 10.
Social Security is one of the few retirement benefits that increase each year
based on a COLA. Most private pensions do not increase at all. The amount
that you are promised at the time you retire is the amount that you must live
with for the rest of your life.
Calculating your best time to start 
collecting Social Security
I’m sure you’re wondering how to figure out when the best time is for you to
start collecting Social Security. That depends on your expected lifetime. But
who really knows how long they will live?
No one can be sure how long they will live, but you can use the MSN Life
Expectancy Calculator to guesstimate it. You can find the calculator at
http://moneycentral.msn.com/investor/calcs/n_expect/
main.asp.
To show you how to figure out your best option, I assume three different ages
for Sally to die — 70, 80, and 90. I calculate the total benefits she will receive
before each age of death depending on when she started to collect.
Started collecting at age 62
If Sally dies at age 70, she will collect Social Security benefits for a total of 96
months. She’ll collect these benefits for 216 months if she dies at age 80.
She’ll collect these benefits for 336 months if she dies at age 90. The total
amount of benefits she will collect if she started collecting Social Security at
age 62, based on a monthly amount of $684, is
By age 70 = $65,664
By age 80 = $147,744
By age 90 = $229,824
122
Part II: Your Wallet to Your Health: The 411 When You Re-Enter the Workforce 

Started collecting at age 66
If Sally dies at age 70, she will collect Social Security benefits for a total of 
48 months. She’ll collect benefits for 168 months if she dies at age 80. She’ll
collect benefits for 288 months if she dies at age 90. The total amount of ben-
efits she will collect if she started collecting Social Security at age 66, based
on a monthly amount of $955, is
By age 70 = $45,840
By age 80 = $160,440
By age 90 = $275,040
Started collecting at age 70
If Sally dies at age 70, she will collect Social Security benefits for a total of 
0 months. She’ll collect benefits for 120 months if she dies at age 80. She’ll
collect benefits for 240 months if she dies at age 90. The total amount of
Social Security benefits she will collect if she started collecting at age 70,
based on a monthly amount of $1,320, is
By age 70 = $0
By age 80 = $158,400
By age 90 = $316,800
You can see from these calculations that if your family has traditionally long
life spans past the age of 80, you may be better off waiting until 70 to start
collecting Social Security. Of course, you must also consider your own health
status. But, provided your health is good enough, you likely will live as long
as your other family members.
On the other hand, if it’s common in your family for people to die before the
age of 70, you’re best off starting to collect Social Security as soon as possi-
ble at age 62. That way you will have more money to use during your early
retirement years.
Deciding not to wait any longer
Your benefits of waiting to collect do have an end point. Once you reach the
age of 70, there is absolutely no benefit to waiting any longer. If you forego
your Social Security benefits after the age of 70 because you still haven’t
retired, you’re just giving your money away.

Chapter 8: Delaying Social Security and Working

If you are still working, you can always bank your Social Security check. You
won’t have any penalties if you continue working. You won’t face any reduc-
tion in your Social Security benefits.
If you do still work at the age of 70 and you improve your earnings history by
replacing some $0 earnings years, your benefits will be adjusted upward auto-
matically. But, that will happen whether or not you are collecting.

R
etirees, especially those who retired before age 65, often find they can’t
afford to stay retired because they can’t get health insurance — or can’t
afford to pay for it. Some early retirees must choose to go back to work not
for the money, but instead just to get access to group health benefits.
This chapter will look at the difficult job of finding health insurance after
retirement, but before you qualify for Medicare.
Exploring Health Insurance Types
When looking for health insurance, if you can figure out how to stay in a
group plan after retirement rather than be forced to apply for individual
plans, do so. While the monthly premium may seem high to you, I can guaran-
tee that comparable coverage, if you were able to find it, would be more
expensive through an individual plan. I talk more about health insurance
costs in the section, “ Finding and Paying for Health Insurance . . . After You
Retire but Before Medicare,” below, but first I want to explore the various
types of health insurance on the market today.

Group health plans
Most of you probably had group health insurance at least at some point 
in your working life. Many companies give people a choice of coverage
among a number of different options — Health Maintenance Organization
(HMO), Preferred Provider Organization (PPO), Point-of-Service Plan (POS),
Indemnity Plan, and High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP) with Health Savings
Account (HSA).
Health Maintenance Organization (HMO)
HMOs are the oldest type of a managed-care plan. They offer not only care for
illness, but also preventive care. They can be formed in two different ways:
 Some are set up where doctors, nurses, and other medical personnel are
hired as employees of the plan. When you seek care, you must go to
specified HMO facilities and get help from one of the medical personnel
on the staff of the HMO.
 Another type of HMO structure involves contracting with physician
groups or individual doctors who will see you in their private offices.
The HMO will pay these doctor groups a set amount per patient per
month, no matter how often the doctor sees you in a given month. If you
join this type of group, beware, you may be seeking a new doctor on a
regular basis. Arguments about treatment and payment arrangements
frequently result in the doctor leaving the group, whether by choice or
not. This is managed care, and sometimes the private doctor doesn’t
agree with the HMO’s managers.
Here are some characteristics common to HMOs:
 Co-payment: No matter what type of underlying structure, HMO facilities
or private offices, you as a patient will only have to pay a co-payment
when you see a doctor. Co-payments can be as low as $5 per visit or as
high as $25 for the primary care provider and $50 for specialists. You
will get a list of fees when you apply for the plan.
 Primary care provider (PCP): Each person in the HMO is assigned a
PCP. This is the doctor you must see for everything. In some managed-
care systems, you are assigned a doctor, or in others, you can pick a
doctor from a list of providers given to you.
 Referrals: You can only see a specialist about a medical problem you’re
having, if your PCP decides you need to see a specialist. Then you will
be given a referral slip. Don’t go to see a specialist without a referral
from your PCP, or the HMO won’t pay for it.
 Rules for reimbursement: Even when you travel, you may have diffi-
culty getting reimbursement, except for emergency care in this type of
closed system. If you do select an HMO, be certain you understand the
rules for seeking medical care while you are traveling before you go on
126
Part II: Your Wallet to Your Health: The 411 When You Re-Enter the Workforce 

your trip. If an emergency does arise, the last thing you want to do is try
to find out the rules while you’re sitting in an emergency room or the
office of an urgent-care doctor.
Point-of-Service Plan (POS)
Many HMOs offer a bit of a twist to their HMOs called a Point-of-Service
(POS) plan. In this type of plan, your primary care physician (PCP) will usu-
ally make referrals to specialists who are part of the HMO network. But, if you
want to see someone outside the network of providers approved by the HMO,
you can get some reimbursement. HMOs do pay less of the bill if you use a
provider outside the plan. For example, the HMO may pay 100 percent of
costs after your co-pay of $50 if you see a doctor in the HMO network, but
only 50 percent or 70 percent outside the network.
Sometimes the PCP may decide to refer you to a specialist outside the net-
work. If that happens, then the plan will pay most if not all of the bill.
If you do get a referral outside the HMO network, be sure you know how
much you are going to have to pay out-of-pocket before seeing the specialist.
You don’t want to find out after seeing the specialist that you’re going to be
socked with 30 or 50 percent of the bill. PCPs have been known to make a
mistake because specialists, as well as primary care doctors, drop in and out
of the network. When you make an appointment with the specialist, make
sure he or she will accept your HMO as the paying insurer.
Sorting out the maze of an HMO can be a full-time job if you’re sick. Take the
time to learn the ropes before you need the care.
Preferred Provider Organizations (PPO)
A PPO is a type of managed care, but it operates much more like a traditional
health insurance plan that you had when you were growing up, which today
are called Indemnity Plans. PPOs contract with doctors, hospitals, and other
medical care providers who agree to accept lower fees to be part of the
insurer’s network.
You may wonder why doctors would agree to accept lower fees. Well, if they
want patients today, they probably don’t have a choice. Few people can get
Indemnity Plans (see the section “Indemnity or Fee-for-Service Plan,” below)
through their workplace today. Even if they are offered, the cost of these
plans is too high for most employees.
As long as you see a physician inside the PPO network of providers, you will
pay a co-payment specified in the plan, usually between $10 and $25 for your
primary care provider (PCP) and $25 to $50 for a specialist. You can seek care
outside the PPOs network of providers, but you will likely have to pay co-
insurance. For example, a PPO likely will pay all charges above the co-pay if
you see a doctor inside the network and only 50 or 70 percent of the charges
outside the network.
127
Chapter 9: Trying to Stay Healthy — Before Age 65

Indemnity or Fee-for-Service Plan
An Indemnity Plan is most likely the type of plan you had when you were
growing up. You could see any doctor without having to worry about whether
or not they were in the network of providers for your health insurer. Your
parents likely paid 20 or 30 percent of the doctor’s bill and the insurance
company paid the rest.
You can find Indemnity Plans on the market today, but you will probably decide
the monthly costs are too high. Since you can see the doctor of your choice,
the insurance company most likely has not negotiated rates with the doctor
and will be forced to pay the full fee, rather than a discounted fee that would
have been negotiated with a doctor who is part of the insurer’s network.
Few companies offer this choice any more for their employees, and for those
that do, the cost is so much higher that many people choose not to pay for
them. I’ve seen employers charge $200 or more per month to employees who
decide they want the Indemnity Plan for their family. Most employees that
choose to pay the extra premium do so because there are doctors they want
to see regularly that are not in the PPO or HMO network the employer offers.
High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP)
A new type of plan, called the High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP), that first
became available to the group health insurance market in 2004 is growing very
slowly in popularity. With this type of plan, you have a high deductible, which
you must pay out-of-pocket before the insurance company pays anything.
Deductibles can be as low as $1,000 for an individual and $2,200 for self and
family, but they can also be as high as $5,000 for an individual and $10,000 for
self and family. So if you choose this type of plan, be sure you understand
how much you could be paying out-of-pocket if you get sick.
Promoters of this type of plan believe that they put you in the driver’s seat to
control the rising costs of medical insurance. But, if you do sign up for this
plan, it won’t take you long to realize that it’s a false promise. You will find it
very difficult to get information to be able to compare fees. Even if you try to
call for a quote by phone, you likely will be told it depends on what the med-
ical provider has to do, and the list of fees are so long that they can’t provide
you with a quote. You may be able to get a quote for one particular day after
the doctor sees you, but by then you’ve already seen the doctor and will
have to pay the fees anyway.
On top of the doctor’s bill, you’ll also get bills from the lab for any blood tests
or other tests run. If the doctor sends you for an x-ray, you’ll get billed for
both the x-ray and for the radiologist who reads the x-ray. You’ll be amazed at
how quickly a doctor’s visit for a wellness exam can turn into a $500 or $1,000
bill or even more.
128
Part II: Your Wallet to Your Health: The 411 When You Re-Enter the Workforce 

If you choose to see a doctor in the HDHPs network of providers, you will
receive a discount on your bill. As long as you stay in the HDHP’s network,
you likely will see discounts of 20 to 60 percent on the bill. It all depends on
the fees the network provider negotiated with the HDHP. I have found that if
you choose a doctor in a group connected with a hospital, you tend to get a
better discount if billed through the hospital system.
Health Savings Account (HSA)
HSAs are tax-free savings plans that you can open and deposit up to $2,700
per year, provided your deductible is at least that high. If you do sign up for
an HDHP, make sure that the plan is HSA compatible. Some are, but some 
are not.
Any money put into these savings accounts can grow tax-free and be taken
out tax-free as long as you use the money for allowable medical care. Any
unused funds in a given year can be rolled over to the next year. The savings
account is yours to keep throughout your life, but you can only add to it
when you are enrolled in an HDHP that is compatible. Once you start on
Medicare, you can no longer add to the savings account, but you can still
draw funds from this account to pay Medicare co-pays and deductibles. I talk
more about your out-of-pocket costs while on Medicare in Chapter 10.
Money put into the HSA is tax-deductible in the year you deposit the money. If
you are over the age of 50, you can put an extra $700 per year into the plan to
help you catch up in saving for medical care when you are older. Catch-up 
contributions are permitted with many retirement savings plans, such as
Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) and 401(k)s. So if you are still adding to
yours, you may be able to save more and reduce your tax bill at the same time.
Medical expenses for which you can withdraw money tax-free from the HSA
include the costs of diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of
disease, and the costs for treatments affecting any part or function of the
body. They include the costs of equipment, supplies, and diagnostic devices
needed for these purposes. They also include dental expenses. You cannot
pay expenses that are just beneficial to general health, such as vitamins or a
vacation. These funds can also be used to pay premiums for qualified long-
term care services and limited amounts paid for any qualified long-term care
insurance contract.
Losing a Group Plan
After you retire, you could find out at some point that your company no
longer offers health insurance to its employees as part of their retirement
package. Even if you are initially offered the coverage, the company doesn’t
have to guarantee that it will offer it for the rest of your life or until you qual-
ify for Medicare.
129
Chapter 9: Trying to Stay Healthy — Before Age 65

Needing coverage . . . quickly!
If you find out that you are no longer eligible for a group plan, act quickly to
check out your alternatives. Once you are without group coverage for 60
days, it becomes much more difficult, if not impossible, to find coverage for
any pre-existing conditions.
By the time you reach 50, you’re likely to have at least one pre-existing condi-
tion. For example, if you take medicine for high blood pressure, a company
could determine that is a pre-existing condition and not offer coverage or
offer coverage at a much higher rate per month than if you did not have the
health problem. They also could exclude coverage for anything related to
your high blood pressure. When an insurance company adds this type of
exclusion, it’s called a rider. A rider can exclude coverage for the medical con-
dition for which you need coverage the most.
Health insurance companies are famous for cherrypicking who they will
insure and who they won’t. That means they only pick the best cherries
(healthiest people) on the tree, all others are left to fend for themselves.
Often if you have even one thing wrong with you, such as high blood pressure
or diabetes, you will not be able to get individual health insurance from most
companies — even if you can prove you’ve kept it under control for years.
Those that do offer coverage will charge outrageous sums. If you have a more
serious illness, forget about it. I know couples paying over $20,000 per year
just for their health insurance.
Checking out your options
So before you give up on the idea of being part of a group, check carefully
into your options, which include
 COBRA: You may be able to continue coverage under COBRA. You
should be able to keep your group coverage for 18 months more as long
as you pay 100 percent of the premiums. Federal law makes it manda-
tory for a company to offer you continuing coverage under COBRA if
you’ve lost your job or you’ve experienced a change in your family life,
such as a divorce. A divorcee who was covered on the ex-spouse’s plan
can get COBRA coverage for up to 36 months.
 Conversion: You might be able to convert your group plan into an indi-
vidual plan. Sometimes this can be done without taking COBRA for 18
months, and sometimes you can’t apply for a conversion until after
you’ve exhausted your COBRA benefits. If you can convert to an individ-
ual plan, you won’t have to worry about being denied coverage for pre-
existing conditions.
 Professional or Social Associations: If you belong to professional or
social associations, you may be able to get a group policy through one of
those associations. Contact any association to which you belong to find
out if they have access to group health insurance for their members.
130
Part II: Your Wallet to Your Health: The 411 When You Re-Enter the Workforce 

Group insurance does offer you the best rates and more comprehensive cov-
erage, so if you can find a way to stay within a group, do so. I explore your
other options below, including COBRA, association health plans, individual
health plans, and state guaranteed issue insurance pools.
You may also find health plans that offer a discount for services rather than
insurance. These are not health insurance plans, but they may save you
money if you can’t find a way to get health insurance. But be careful, many of
these plans are not accepted by doctors even if the doctors’ group may be
listed on the promotional materials. I had one for a short time and called 15
doctors’ groups on the list only to find out that most of them had never heard
of the plan. If you are considering a discount plan, call the doctors on the list
for the plan and find out if the doctor has heard of the plan and will honor it.
Understanding state influence
Another thing that makes it so difficult to find health insurance wherever you’re
living is that health insurance is managed by the states, so insurance companies
lobby for the easiest rules they can get in each state. You will find very different
health insurance rules state by state. For example, if you had a good plan when
you were living in New Jersey, which has some of the strongest consumer-
oriented health insurance laws, you won’t find the same type of coverage in
Florida, which tends to bend more easily to insurance company wishes.
Some states have rules that make it easier for you to get health insurance if
you are a small business. For example, in Florida, the state makes it possible
for self-employed individuals to join the small business group. So if you live
in Florida and run a small business out of your home, you can get group
health insurance. You can find out which states offer this option at Health
Insurance.org (www.healthinsurance.org). You will find links there to
insurance Web sites for the states that do have special provisions for small
business owners.
COBRA
COBRA is short for a 1985 law (Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1985) that guaranteed continuing group health coverage for employees
working at companies with 20 or more people. You are entitled for COBRA
benefits if:
 You work for a company that has more than 20 workers.
 You were covered on a group health insurance plan prior to the change
in your work or family life. You can check with your human resources
person to see if you are in a plan covered by COBRA.
 You lost your coverage because of a change in your work or family life
that qualifies, such as you change jobs, you get divorced, or your spouse
loses coverage at his or her workplace.
131
Chapter 9: Trying to Stay Healthy — Before Age 65

You must send your company a notice within 60 days of any life change event
that qualifies. The company must let you know if you are eligible for COBRA
within 14 days of receiving your notice.
If you do qualify for coverage, then you will need to pay for 100 percent of the
health insurance costs. This likely will be a huge jump in monthly premiums
you must pay out of pocket. Most companies subsidize health insurance;
very few pay for it completely. Most employers today expect employees to
pay between 20 percent and 40 percent of their health insurance premiums,
so your health insurance premium bill likely will jump by 60 to 80 percent
depending on how much of it was paid by the employer previously.
Don’t get angry and drop the insurance without first researching your
options and finding alternative health insurance coverage. If you are without
group health coverage for 60 days, you will find it difficult to get coverage for
any pre-existing conditions.
When you do your search, you probably will find out that an individual health
plan will cost you a lot more money, if you can even qualify for that plan. If
you or a member of your family has pre-existing conditions, most individual
health insurance won’t consider covering you or will put a hefty surcharge on
your monthly premium. This is called rating you up and it can be as much as
100 percent more than you would have to pay if you didn’t have the condition.
That means a $350 monthly premium could all of sudden turn into a $700
monthly premium for an individual. Family health insurance is even higher.
Association health plans
If you can’t get COBRA or convert your group plan into an individual plan,
you may have one other choice before entering the maze of seeking individ-
ual health coverage — association health plans. Many professional and social
associations provide their members with a way to get group health insur-
ance. Check with any professional or social associations in which you are a
member to find out if they offer access to a group health insurance plan.
AARP
The AARP started offering a Personal Health Insurance Plan to its members
aged 50 to 64 who do not yet qualify for Medicare. The Plan offers insurance
through the United HealthCare Insurance Company.
You won’t be able to access the AARP’s plan in all states, but as of September
2005, it was available in these 15 states: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas,
Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Missouri, Nebraska, 
Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Virginia.
132
Part II: Your Wallet to Your Health: The 411 When You Re-Enter the Workforce 

If you are having difficulty finding a health insurance plan, you may want 
to check out the AARP plan online at http://www.aarp.org/aarp_
benefits/offer_health/aarp_personal_health_insurance_plan.
html. I’m not aware of any other group plan available for this age group.
The AARP has numerous options available for you as part of this plan. For
comprehensive coverage, you can choose from deductible levels of $1,000,
$2,000, and $5,000. There is also a plan that offers limited coverage with a
$2,000 deductible. Premiums do vary state by state.
Individual health plans
Options for individual health plans are similar to those available under group
plans. You can find HMOs, PPOs, POSs, HDHPs, and Indemnity Plans, but you
likely won’t find that their coverage is as comprehensive as that available on
a group plan. You’ll have to carefully scour the list of what they cover and
what they don’t.
When picking an individual health plan, be sure you understand how much
the plan will pay for services. Some plans provide coverage based on a
schedule of fees. If your doctor charges more for any type of procedure listed
on the schedule, you have to pay the difference out of pocket. For example, if
the plan lists the fee for a specific operation as $15,000 and your doctor
charges you $25,000, you’ll have to pay the difference out-of-pocket.
Be sure to read the fine print of any individual health plan that you choose. If
you find something written in your contract that you don’t understand, ask
questions until you do. Definitely do not wait until you need the care to find
out what kind of coverage you have. That will be too late to fix the problem
with your coverage.
State guaranteed issue 
health insurance pools
State guaranteed issue insurance pools should always be your last resort.
They provide the least amount of coverage for the most amount of money.
When my COBRA ran out and before I found the current small business group
I could join, the best quote I could find through guaranteed issue was $780
per month for a high deductible health plan, and other options were consid-
erably higher.
Contact your state health insurance commissioner to find out if guaranteed
issue health insurance pools are offered in your state. If your state does offer
these types of pools, they will include a list of health insurance companies
that can be contacted for coverage.
133
Chapter 9: Trying to Stay Healthy — Before Age 65

Finding and Paying for Health 
Insurance . . . After You Retire but
Before Medicare
Your health insurance premiums will skyrocket once you lose the coverage
you’ve come to depend on through your workplace. In fact, many people
after they start to research health insurance costs, decide they can’t afford to
retire early and must wait until they are closer to qualifying for Medicare.
If you do work for a company that offers COBRA coverage, that does allow
you to retire at least 18 months early and still carry your group insurance
coverage.
As you start to make your plans for early retirement before you qualify for
Medicare, make sure you check out your health insurance options carefully
and what they will cost before you take the leap. You won’t be able to rectify
this mistake easily if you find out you’re going to lose your health insurance.
Researching coverage exclusions
As you age, you have to face the fact that health problems will appear. For
example, most people over 50 have some signs of arthritis — that can result
in being rated up for higher premiums and possibly total denial of health
insurance in some states because of what insurance companies would con-
sider a pre-existing condition. In others, even if you can find coverage, the
health insurance company will write the policy only if you accept an exclu-
sion for anything related to your pre-existing condition of arthritis.
When you consider how many joints can be affected by arthritis, if you’re
told by the health insurance company that it’s excluding coverage for any-
thing related to arthritis, you likely won’t have coverage for anything involv-
ing your joints. You can be sure they’ll deny payment on the basis of arthritis
if you need joint surgery.
It’s very difficult to find out what a company may or may not exclude in cov-
erage. All of this is part of the secretive world of underwriting. No insurance
company puts out an extensive list of things it will or will not cover. You can
only find out if you have a coverage problem with a specific insurance com-
pany after you’ve filled out their extensive questionnaire and provided them
with a comprehensive health history. I can guarantee if you haven’t been
through this process, you will find it one of the most intrusive things you
ever have to do.
134
Part II: Your Wallet to Your Health: The 411 When You Re-Enter the Workforce 

In addition to the questions they will ask you, they can use a secretive data-
base available to health insurers that lists all the payments that were made
on your behalf by all the insurance companies. So they know what types of
medications you’ve taken in the past, as well as whatever diagnoses you’ve
received from the doctor.
You can be denied coverage based on information in your file, but you can’t
get a copy of your file to find out if it is correct. When you do get denied or
coverage gets excluded, only then can you ask for details about why the com-
pany has denied coverage. If you think the information in your file is wrong,
you have the onus of paying for a doctor’s appointment and getting whatever
information you may need to prove the information in the file is not correct. If
that involves additional tests, you pay for the tests out-of-pocket unless you
have existing health insurance coverage that has not yet expired.
The underwriting process can take 30 days or more. That’s why you should
start seeking replacement coverage at least 60 days before your current cov-
erage expires.
Finding insurance coverage
When looking for health insurance, the insurer definitely has the upper hand
and holds all the cards. You may be able to look for health insurance options
and try to find the best price on the Internet. But, the quotes you’ll receive
from all these Web sites are based on someone in excellent health with no
problems.
135
Chapter 9: Trying to Stay Healthy — Before Age 65
Recruiting retirees
Many people end up going back to work after
retiring solely to get health insurance coverage.
I live near Orlando, Florida, and know many
people who took full-time jobs a Disney not
because they needed the money, but because
they wanted access to a group health insurance
plan. I know couples who were paying over
$1,500 per month to get health insurance, prior
to joining Disney. Other neighbors and friends
are luckier, and have continuing health cover-
age through their former place of employment
as part of their retirement health package.
Disney has had so much success recruiting
workers in my retirement community, that their
recruiters come to the community once a month
to find new workers. Health insurance is not the
only driving force. Many are looking for free
tickets and other discount benefits they can use
when their grandchildren are visiting.

You won’t actually know what your health insurance will cost you until after
you fill out an online questionnaire and answer a verbal list of questions from
the underwriter. In addition, the underwriter will ask you to send medical
records related to the questions you answer. The entire underwriting process
can take more than a month, and when it’s over, you may not like the price
you get. You then have to start the entire process over again with another
insurance company.
You do have a couple of options for making the most of your time during your
search:
 Start the underwriting process at the same time with a number of
companies. You will find that after the underwriting process, some com-
panies will reject your application, some will increase your monthly rate
considerably because of certain medical conditions, and others will not
cover a chronic disease. The process can take 60 to 90 days, so it’s a
good idea to apply with several companies. That way when the final
offers come in after underwriting, you can choose the company that
offers you the best option at the best price.
 Find an insurance agent that specializes in health insurance. That’s
not an easy person to find in most states. Agents don’t make much
money selling individual health insurance policies because so many of
their successful sales fall through. Many times the individuals who apply
for insurance don’t qualify. Individual health insurance agents find out
very quickly that they’ll run around to see potential customers, but few
will turn into successful sales. It’s not hard to get someone to fill out the
application, but it is hard to get someone through the underwriting
process. The agent only makes money if someone qualifies. So, you may
find it difficult to find an individual health insurance agent who has been
around for awhile and can help you. Ask your friends and neighbors if
they know someone that can help.
Uncovering hidden costs
Premiums are not the only thing you must consider when picking a health
insurance plan. In addition to premiums, you likely will have to pay:
 Deductibles: The amount you must spend before the health insurance
company will pay any part of your medical bills is called a deductible.
Deductibles can be as low as $100 and as high as $5,000, depending on
the type of health insurance plan you choose.
 Co-payments: A co-payment is a set dollar amount you will pay each time
you see a medical provider. For example, you may have to pay $20 each
time you see your primary care provider.
136
Part II: Your Wallet to Your Health: The 411 When You Re-Enter the Workforce 

 Co-insurance: Co-insurance is usually a percentage you will pay of the
allowable charges a doctor or other medical provider bills for your care.
For example, if the insurance company pays 80 percent of your hospital
bill, then your co-insurance will be 20 percent of that bill.
Also, you need to check whether or not the insurance company has pre-
certification requirements. These are common when you need surgery or
other major medical procedure. If you fail to get pre-certification before the
surgery or procedure, the insurance company can refuse to pay the bill.
You may also find that some companies charge you to even apply for their
coverage, called an application process charge or administrative fee. These
fees will likely be in the $50 to $100 range. They do have to pay their under-
writers, and you foot part of the bill for that intrusive process.
Figuring Out When Your Health 
Coverage Will End
Whatever coverage you choose after retirement, but before Medicare, will
end when you become eligible for Medicare at age 65. At that point, you’ll
have to decide among numerous options to figure out what type of health
coverage you want. I talk about health coverage options under Medicare in
Chapter 8.
Before that time, there are a number of ways your coverage can end:
 You send a note to the insurance company to drop the coverage. You
must do this in writing. Hopefully before you do this, you do have
another health insurance plan lined up. You don’t want to have a break
in coverage, because you will find difficulty getting another plan if you
have pre-existing conditions, and you may not have coverage for these
conditions if you have a break in coverage of more than 60 days. So
don’t act in anger if you find your plan is not providing the coverage you
expected. Act slowly and carefully to protect your rights to continuing
health insurance coverage.
 You fail to pay the premium. If you don’t pay the premiums on time, the
company can drop your insurance and you will have to start the applica-
tion process all over again. You can be denied coverage even if you pay
the bill late. If a new medical condition has developed since your initial
application, you probably will be denied coverage. Don’t forget to pay
those health insurance premiums on time. Many health insurance com-
panies will set up an automatic payment process that takes the money
out of your bank account. You may want to consider that option to avoid
this mistake.
137
Chapter 9: Trying to Stay Healthy — Before Age 65

 You reach a certain age. Some companies will specify that they will only
cover you up to a certain age. If the age is less than 65, don’t consider
the policy. Find one that will cover you until you are eligible for
Medicare. You don’t want to have to search for insurance again and risk
denial because of a pre-existing condition. The number of medical condi-
tions you face do increase as you age.
 Making fraudulent misstatements. If you tried to hide a health problem
during your application process and the health insurance company finds
out that you provided false information, the company does have the
right to cancel your coverage as though you never had it. Even an omis-
sion can be interpreted as a fraudulent misstatement.
Finding health insurance as an individual may be one of the most difficult
processes you face when you retire. You’ll find it frustrating and you may end
up deciding you have to go back to work just to get the medical coverage you
need. Your only comfort will be that you are not alone. Many people return to
work because they can’t find or can’t afford individual health insurance.

Exploring Medicare’s 
Maze of Benefits
In This Chapter

 Paying for what Medicare doesn’t
 Covering long-term care
I
f you think you had a hard time figuring out health insurance benefits
when you were covered in a group plan through your company, you’ve 
not seen anything yet. Medicare’s maze of benefits with its Parts A, B, C, 
and D can be difficult to explore even if you have a PhD in healthcare. In 
this chapter, I sort out myriad benefits and rules to help make your journey
through this maze a bit easier.
Getting Started with Medicare
You probably have heard about the As, Bs, Cs, and Ds of Medicare but aren’t
sure what these letters mean. Keeping it brief — the devil’s in the details
below — I list the basics in their simplest form:
 Part A covers hospitalization.
 Part B covers doctors and most of your other medical needs.
 Part C includes all managed-care options to Parts A and B.
 Part D covers drugs.

You likely did pay for Medicare through payroll taxes your entire working 
life. You contributed 1.45 percent of your paycheck, and your employer 
contributed a matching amount.
Because medical expenses continue to rise each year, and the taxes for it
have not, Medicare is facing a financial crisis. Medicare’s coverage options
could change dramatically while you’re in retirement. You need to carefully
read news stories about changes to Medicare coverage each year. A great
Web site that keeps you up to date on Medicare is the Medicare Rights Center
(www.medicarerights.org).
Starting coverage
You might be wondering how you start your Medicare coverage. If you’re 65
and already collecting Social Security, Part A coverage should start automati-
cally. You should get your Medicare card in the mail without having to do
anything. This automatic enrollment works for people who started to collect
Social Security before the age of 65 or people who apply for Social Security at
age 65.
The only coverage that doesn’t involve paying a monthly premium is Part A.
You will have to pay for Parts B and D. Part C you only have to pay for if you
choose a managed-care plan. I talk more about Part C in the section,
“Medicare Advantage Plans — Part C,” below.
Missing Medicare deadlines
If you’re not already collecting Social Security, and that will be true for more
and more people as the full retirement age to collect Social Security gradually
increases to 67, you will need to sign up for Medicare about three months
before your 65th birthday.
Unlike Social Security, you have a limited time to apply for Medicare. You
must apply some time during a seven-month window, which starts three
months before your 65th birthday and ends four months after. If you miss
this window, you will have to wait for the next general enrollment period,
which happens between January 1 and March 31 each year. Missing the dead-
line means paying more for Medicare Parts B and D as well as paying penal-
ties. (See the next section, “Facing penalties,” for more on the financial
details of missing Medicare application windows.)
140
Part II: Your Wallet to Your Health: The 411 When You Re-Enter the Workforce 

Facing penalties
If you delay your application and miss the deadline, you’ll end up paying
more for Medicare Parts B and D for the rest of your life because you’ll 
incur penalties for both of them if you don’t take all parts immediately 
upon becoming eligible. The following penalties get added to the monthly
premium you pay for these Medicare options when you do sign up:
 If you miss the deadline for Medicare Part B, you’ll get a 10 percent
penalty added to your monthly premium for the rest of your life for
every 12 months you miss.
 If you miss the deadline for Medicare Part D, you’ll get a 1 percent
penalty added to your monthly premium for every month you miss.
These premiums have increased at a rate of 10 to 12 percent each year as
medical costs increase, so expect increases in these premiums in the future
as well. Medicare Part D premiums vary widely, since this option is provide
by private insurers, but premiums average about $20 to $30 per month for
the basic plan. More comprehensive coverage is higher. If you miss the dead-
line and have to wait a year for Parts B and D, then a $9.84 penalty would be
added to your future Part B monthly premium. The penalty for your Medicare
Part D payment will vary depending which private plan you choose.
Delaying coverage because 
you’re covered at work
You can avoid these penalties, if the reason you delayed signing up for
Medicare was because you had coverage through your place of work. You can
continue your coverage at work if you’re still working at age 65 for a company
that has at least 20 employees. If you are working and have benefits, compare
the health insurance benefits offered by your workplace to those offered by
Medicare. Pick whichever one will be better for you.
What are the rules if you delay signing up for Medicare because you do have
coverage at work? You must apply for Medicare within eight months of leav-
ing your job. If you don’t, you will be liable for the penalties discussed above
for Parts A and B.
141
Chapter 10: Exploring Medicare’s Maze of Benefits

Traditional Medicare — Parts A and B
Traditional Medicare is structured like an Indemnity Health Insurance Plan.
You can go to any doctor that will accept Medicare reimbursement. You pay
20 percent of the medical provider’s allowable charges and Medicare picks up
80 percent. Your 20 percent is called the co-insurance.
In addition, there is a deductible that you must pay before Medicare starts to
pay for things. That deductible depends on the type of medical care you need
and under which part it is covered — A or B. You can also buy additional cov-
erage that will pay any medical costs that Medicare doesn’t cover. I talk more
about that later in this chapter in the section, “Paying for Things Medicare
Doesn’t Cover.”
Part A
You receive automatic coverage under Part A when you turn 65, but what
exactly gets covered? And what exactly do you have to pay? I break it all
down for you in the sections that follow.
Knowing what’s covered under Part A
Part A covers the inpatient portion of your medical care, including care in the
hospital, at skilled-nursing facilities (as long as you go directly to the nursing
home from at least a three-day hospital stay), in your home after a hospital
stay, and hospice care. When you are in a hospital or skilled-nursing facility,
Medicare will pay for a semi-private room, meals, general nursing, and other
hospital services and supplies.
The only time that Medicare Part A will pay for your stay in a skilled-nursing
facility is if you went directly from at least a three-day stay in a hospital to a
skilled-nursing facility. Sometimes a physician will decide to order in-hospital
testing for three days rather than outpatient testing just to make it possible
for a patient that needs skilled-nursing care to qualify for that care under Part
A. If you go home between a hospital stay for a few days and then go into a
nursing facility, Medicare will not pick up the bill.
After a hospital stay you can get coverage for home healthcare needs, as long
as your doctor recommends it. Many different types of care can be ordered
by the doctor including part-time skilled-nursing care, physical therapy, occu-
pational therapy, speech-language therapy, home health aid services, medical
social services, durable medical equipment (such as wheelchairs or a hospi-
tal bed), oxygen, medical supplies, and any other medically necessary ser-
vices deemed important by the doctor.
142
Part II: Your Wallet to Your Health: The 411 When You Re-Enter the Workforce 

People diagnosed with a terminal illness can also get coverage under Medicare
for hospice care. Hospices specialize in assisting people and their family after a
doctor has determined the person has six months or less to live. Hospices help
with the legal, financial, and emotional needs and decision making of both the
patient and his or her family. Care can be provided in the home, at a hospice
facility, or in the hospital.
Detailing what Part A doesn’t cover
You won’t get coverage for private duty nursing or a telephone or television
in your hospital or skilled-nursing facility room. You have to pay for those
items out-of-pocket if the skilled-nursing facility or hospital charges extra for
them. You also have to pay the extra costs of a private room unless your
doctor can make the case that it was medically necessary.
Unfortunately, Part A doesn’t cover 100 percent of your inpatient care. You will
have to pay both a deductible and co-insurance for each hospital stay. The
deductible and co-insurance amount is adjusted each year by the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services, an agency of the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services.
In 2007, the inpatient deductible is $992. Coinsurance is $238 a day for the
61st to 90th day of inpatient care. Co-insurance then jumps to $476 a day for
the 91st to 150th days of inpatient care, as long as you haven’t used up your
lifetime reserve days. You are responsible for all costs after the 150th day of
care in a hospital.
Calculating the costs of inpatient care
So how do you figure out the costs of inpatient care? Say you needed to 
be in the hospital for 100 days. Here is what you would need to pay out-
of-pocket if you don’t have some additional coverage that pays for what
Medicare does not:
Day 1 to Day 60:
$992 deductible
Day 61 to Day 90:
$7,140 co-insurance
Day 91 to Day 100:
$4,760 co-insurance (as long as you still
have lifetime reserve days available)
Total cost out of pocket:
$12,892
This deductible and co-insurance is based on something unique to Medicare
called benefit periods. A benefit period starts when you enter a hospital or
skilled-nursing facility and ends when you’ve been out of the hospital or
skilled-nursing facility at least 60 days. If you need additional hospitalization
or skilled-nursing care within that window, you don’t need to pay an addi-
tional deductible. But, if your need for care falls outside that window, then
you will have to pay a new set of deductibles and co-insurance.
143
Chapter 10: Exploring Medicare’s Maze of Benefits

You must pay the deductible each time you enter the hospital during a new
benefit period. The good news is that when you start a new benefit period, 
it restarts the clock for co-insurance as well. That means you can be in the
hospital another 90 days if needed. Sometimes family members are forced to
take a sick family member home when their family member has maxed out
his or her in-patient days. They must find a way to keep their loved one alive
until the benefit period runs out — 60 days after the family member leaves
the hospital or skilled-nursing facility.
Coinsurance for a skilled-nursing care facility is less. You won’t have to pay a
deductible because you must be transferring into the facility from at least a
three-day hospital stay and have already paid your deductible for that benefit
period. Medicare will cover the first 20 days in a skilled-nursing facility 100
percent. After that your cost per day is $119 a day for the 21st to 100th day.
Sometimes you can find a nursing facility that will charge you less than the
$119 a day.
Working around the rules for Part A
You are responsible for all costs after the 100th day. You can avoid these
costs if you are able to go home for at least 60 days. Then your doctor can
restart the clock with a new benefit period by putting you in the hospital for
tests for at least 3 days. You will have to pay a new deductible, but then you
will be able to get Medicare coverage for another 100 days in a skilled-nursing
facility.
Yes it is a maze, and as you get deeper into that maze it becomes much trick-
ier. Luckily, most hospitals and skilled-nursing facilities have social workers
who spend their entire day helping people work within and around the
Medicare rules. It’s good to understand them, but you won’t be alone trying
to navigate them.
144
Part II: Your Wallet to Your Health: The 411 When You Re-Enter the Workforce 
Using lifetime reserve days and 
understanding benefit periods
Lifetime reserve days add another unique twist
to Medicare coverage. Officially you can only
get 90 days of inpatient coverage during a ben-
efit period. A benefit period under Medicare
starts when you enter a hospital. It ends when
you’ve been out of the hospital or a skilled-nurs-
ing facility for at least 60 days. In addition to the
90-day limit, Medicare recipients also get 60
lifetime reserve days that can be used any time
you need more than 90 days of inpatient care.
But, you only get a total of 60 days for your
entire life, so it’s important to use them spar-
ingly. Once you’ve used them up, you’ll have to
pay 100 percent of all inpatient costs.

If you are ever told that your time has run out for care in a hospital or skilled-
nursing facility, be sure you talk with the social worker assigned to your case to
see what alternatives there might be for you. But sometimes, the only alterna-
tive will be coverage through long-term healthcare insurance, which I discuss
below in the section, “Paying for Things Medicare Doesn’t Cover.” Otherwise
you have to pay cash or apply for Medicaid, a healthcare program for the poor.
There are strict income and asset levels that determine whether you’re allowed
to qualify for Medicaid.
Part B
Because you’re automatically covered under Medicare Part A, you’re proba-
bly wondering why you’d want to pay for coverage with Part B. Well, check all
that Part B covers (and don’t forget to review what it doesn’t cover!), and
when you see how much you’ll pay for coverage, you’ll understand that Part
B is the cheapest health insurance plan on the market.
Checking out what Part B covers
Part B covers your outpatient medical care. In addition to covering your doc-
tors appointments, Part B covers outpatient medical and surgical procedures,
diagnostic tests, ambulatory surgery center fees for approved procedures,
and durable medical equipment including wheelchairs, hospital beds, oxygen,
and walkers. Part A pays for durable medical equipment if it was ordered as
part of a home healthcare plan after a hospital stay. You can also get coverage
for second surgical opinions and outpatient physical, occupational, and
speech therapy.
Part B also pays for many preventive care screenings and services including
 Bone mass measurements: Your and your doctor will determine how 
frequently you need this test. Medicare patients with a diagnosis of
osteoporosis will need this test more frequently than those who do 
not have the disorder.
 Cardiovascular screenings: You can get Medicare to pay for screening
tests for cholesterol, lipid, and triglyceride levels every five years.
 Colorectal cancer screening: You and your doctor determine your level
of risk for colorectal cancer and how frequently you need preventive
screening tests. These tests can include Fecal Occult Blood Test, Flexible
Sigmoidoscopy, Colonoscopy, and Barium Enema.
145
Chapter 10: Exploring Medicare’s Maze of Benefits

 Diabetes screenings plus services and supplies: You can get Medicare
to pay for screenings to check for diabetes every year if you have any of
the following risk factors: high blood pressure, abnormal cholesterol or
triglyceride levels, obesity, or a history of high blood sugar. Medicare
also will pay for screenings if you have two or more of these characteris-
tics: age 65 or older, overweight, family history of diabetes, or a history
of diabetes during pregnancy. In addition to screenings, Medicare pays
for glucose monitors, test strips, and lancets as well as diabetes self-
management training.
 Glaucoma screening: Your Glaucoma screening will be paid by Medicare
once every 12 months. It must be done or supervised by an eye doctor
who is legally allowed to do this service in your state.
 Mammogram screening: Women on Medicare can get coverage for a
mammogram once every 12 months. Medicare also covers new digital
technologies for mammogram screening.
 Pap test and pelvic examination: Medicare will pay for a woman’s Pap
test once every 24 months, if you have no evidence of cancer risk. You
can be tested once every 12 months if you are at high risk for cervical or
vaginal cancer. Medicare does not cover a clinical breast exam.
 Prostate cancer screening: Men are covered by Medicare for a digital
rectal examination and a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test once every
12 months.
 Shots (vaccinations): You can get Medicare to pay for a flu shot once a
year in the fall or winter. You can also get a Pneumococcal pneumonia
shot (one shot may be all you ever need; ask your doctor). Hepatitis B
shots are covered by Medicare for people at high or medium risk for
Hepatitis B.
 “Welcome to Medicare” Physical Exam: When you first sign up for
Medicare, you get a one-time review of your health, as well as education
and counseling about preventive services, within the first six months of
coverage under Part B. This exam is required if you choose to accept Part
B. It will include screenings, shots, and referrals for other care if needed.
Understanding what Part B doesn’t cover
Medicare Part B does exclude a number of medical services from its cover-
age. The most important is that you can’t get a routine or yearly physical.
The only physical included as part of your coverage is the first “Welcome to
Medicare” physical mentioned above.
You also won’t get coverage for any prescription drugs under Part B, but if
you pay an additional monthly premium, you can get that coverage under Part
D. Other exclusions from coverage include custodial care, acupuncture, dental
care, cosmetic surgery, hearing aids and exams, orthopedic shoes, routine
foot care, routine eye care, and most shots except for those listed above.
146
Part II: Your Wallet to Your Health: The 411 When You Re-Enter the Workforce 

Calculating the coverage costs for Part B
You pay a monthly premium for Part B coverage, but that premium is cheaper
than any other health insurance plan on the market. The monthly premium
for 2007 is $93.50 per month and more if you earn over $80,000 per year (see
Table 10-1). In addition to the monthly premium, your deductible for Part B is
$131. After that you pay 20 percent of all your covered medical costs and
Medicare pays the rest. The only exception to this co-payment is if you need
mental health care. Medicare Part B only pays 50 percent of that type of care.
In 2007, Medicare Part B premiums will be set through means testing, which
means you pay more if your income is above $80,000 (filing single) or
$160,000 (filing jointly). If your income is under $80,000 (as an individual) or
under $160,000 (filing jointly), you will pay $93.50 per month. Table 10-1
shows you Medicare Part B premiums beginning in 2007.
Table 10-1
New Medicare Part B Premiums for 2007
Income
Part B Premium
Under $80,000 for single ($160,000 if filing jointly)
$93.50 per person
Between $80,001 and $100,000 for single 
$105.80 per person
($160,001 and $200,000 if filing jointly)
Between $100,001 and $150,000 for single
$124.40 per person 
($200,001 and $300,000 if filing jointly)
Between $150,001 and $200,000 for single 
$142.90 per person
($300,001 and $400,000 if filing jointly)
Above $200,000 for singles ($400,000 if filing jointly)
$162.40 per person
When you are on Medicare, you must check to be sure you doctor will 
accept assignment. This is another of those Medicare-specific terms you’ll 
get to know quickly. If the doctor doesn’t accept assignment, it means he 
or she will not take the responsibility of billing Medicare and waiting to 
be paid. You will have to pay the entire bill at the time you receive services. 
If your doctor does not accept assignment, you may want to consider 
finding another doctor. Be sure to check this out before your appointment 
or you could be shocked at the end when you have to come up with $100 or
considerably more.

Chapter 10: Exploring Medicare’s Maze of Benefits

Medicare Advantage Plans — Part C
Medicare Advantage Plans are a managed-care alternative to traditional
Medicare that you can purchase through private insurers. You must pay for
Parts A and B in order to apply for Part C, but you may find a managed-care
plan in which you won’t have as many out-of-pocket costs as you do by just
paying for Part B.
Examining the plans
Medicare offers several managed-care plans as alternatives to traditional
Medicare. All Part C options are available through private insurers rather
than the government, and the following sections describe how each of the
various plans work.
Medicare Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs)
If you choose to enroll in an HMO, you can only use the doctors, hospitals, or
other providers in the HMO network. You must select a primary care doctor,
who then serves as a gatekeeper to decide when you can see a specialist and
which specialist you can see. Neither Medicare nor the HMO will pay for
unauthorized visits to specialists. They also will not pay for visits to medical
providers outside your HMOs network. For an additional premium, you may
find an HMO that offers partial coverage for point-of-service (POS) benefits
outside the plan, which means you can choose your own doctors but you’ll
pay more. HMOs usually provide more benefits than traditional Medicare,
which includes coverage for some of the out-of-pocket deductibles and co-
payments mentioned above, as well as more preventive care, such as annual
physicals. How much more you’ll pay in monthly premiums will depend on
the level of coverage provided by the HMO. Each private insurer sets its own
premium rates, but Medicare does monitor these rates. Some HMOs also
include drug coverage as part of their plan, so you don’t need to pay for
Medicare Part D separately, but you will pay a higher premium to get drug
coverage through the HMO.
Medicare Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs)
If you want more flexibility regarding which doctors you can see, you might
prefer a PPO to an HMO. More of your costs for medical care will be covered
if you see in-network doctors, but you can get reimbursed for care from doc-
tors or hospitals outside the network. You don’t have to see a primary care
physician before being permitted to contact a specialist. You will pay higher
premiums for a PPO than an HMO to get this increased flexibility.
148
Part II: Your Wallet to Your Health: The 411 When You Re-Enter the Workforce 

Provider-Sponsored Organizations (PSOs)
Medicare is experimenting with a new type of organization called Provider-
Sponsored Organizations (PSOs), which are medical-provider owned and
sponsored ventures that operate much like an HMO. The big difference is
that rather than being owned and managed by an insurer, they are owned 
and managed by a medical-provider group (which can include doctors, labo-
ratories, and hospitals). You may find it hard to find this option in your state.
The rules for this option vary state by state, so do a lot of research in your
state before choosing one of these. The best place to start your research in
your state’s health insurance regulator.
Private Fee-for-Service Plans (PFFS)
If you want a traditional Indemnity plan, but prefer to work with a private
insurer rather than the government, you may want to consider a PFFS if you
can find one. There aren’t many out there. You pay an initial premium for the
plan plus deductibles and co-payments.
Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs)
Congress hoped to engage in an experiment allowing 390,000 Medicare 
recipients to open MSAs. Under this experiment, you can choose to save 
for your own medical costs in tax-advantaged medical savings accounts. 
With this option, you can buy a high-deductible insurance plan (usually 
with a deductible of $1,000 to $3,000) and pay all medical costs up to that
deductible. As of August 2006, there were no MSAs available for Medicare
recipients, but you can learn more about how they will work if they do
become available at http://hiicap.state.ny.us/medicare/msa.htm.
149
Chapter 10: Exploring Medicare’s Maze of Benefits
Finding Medicare Part C alternatives
Medicare Part C options vary state by state.
Health insurance programs are managed on a
state-by-state basis and not at the Federal gov-
ernment level. You can search online to find out
which Medicare Advantage Plan options are
available in your state. In fact, you may find that
options vary city by city or among regions in
your state because it depends on where the
health insurance providers set up a doctor’s
network. You’ll find more options if you live near
a major city than you will if you live in a rural
area. Use Medicare’s Personal Medical Plan
Finder at www.Medicare.gov/MPPF/home.
asp to check out your options. If you’re not
comfortable searching online, you also can get
the information about specific plans by calling
1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227).

Figuring out which plan is best for you
How do you decide what is best for you? It depends on what is more impor-
tant to you. Read the following statements and find which one you identify
with most to determine which plan will work best for you:
 You want to keep your doctors. If you use a specific group of doctors,
specialists, or hospitals and don’t want to risk having to change them
periodically, you will be safest staying on traditional Medicare. While
you may find your doctors in the network of the HMO or PPO, that 
doesn’t guarantee you they will always be in that network.
 You want more benefits or you want to reduce your medical costs. You
may be able to reduce your out-of-pocket costs and likely find more bene-
fits in one of the Medicare Advantage plans. After paying the premium for
these plans, your co-pay will be a set amount, usually between $5 and $25
depending on the plan you choose rather than the 20 percent co-pay
required for traditional Medicare. But, be sure you understand what is
being covered before you sign up. Many of these Medicare Advantage
insurers prefer to cover only the healthiest seniors and do not provide
good coverage if you have a chronic health condition. Before you switch
to a Medicare Advantage plan, be sure you ask a lot of questions about
the coverage provided for your specific health conditions and how much
that coverage will cost.
 You have good supplemental coverage from your former employer.
Some retirees have coverage that pays for anything not covered by
Medicare, such as the deductibles and 20 percent co-pay for traditional
Medicare. If you do have retiree health coverage, check with your former
employer before signing up for a Medicare Advantage plan. You could lose
your retiree health benefits if you sign up for a Medicare Advantage plan.
 You receive Medicaid benefits. If you currently receive Medicaid bene-
fits, be sure to coordinate any decision about your Medicare coverage
before considering a change. Contact your state Medicaid office and be
sure you pick a plan that will be acceptable under the Medicaid rules in
your state. Your state may even pay the premiums for you to switch to
an acceptable Medicare Advantage Plan, but if you choose the wrong
one, you could lose Medicaid benefits.
Prescription Coverage — Part D
If I had to pick one word to describe Medicare Part D, that word would be
confusing. I don’t believe the government could have designed a more con-
fusing plan to cover your prescriptions if the powers that be set out to do
just that.
150
Part II: Your Wallet to Your Health: The 411 When You Re-Enter the Workforce 

Yes, all the complaints you hear about this plan are true:
 You will find it difficult to sort out the more than 40 options available
in most states.
 You will find it difficult to figure out your annual costs for each plan
option. The U.S. General Accountability Office (GAO) even found that
customer service representatives got it wrong 86 percent of the time
during calls made by GAO researchers to test the accuracy of the infor-
mation Medicare recipients received from these private insurers.
 You will find it difficult to figure out whether or not the drugs you are
taking are covered by the plans you are considering. Insurers may
even list your drug as being covered, but when you need to actually pick
up a prescription, you find out that the coverage is for a dosage level
lower than the one you take.
 You will find it difficult to get approval for coverage for a drug not
currently covered. If you find out your drug is not covered, you and
your doctor have to go through an extensive process to get approval 
for you to take the drug, and it’s not guaranteed you ever will get the
coverage. Without that approval, you must either change drugs or pay
for your prescription out-of-pocket.
Are you ready? In this section, I take Plan D step by step, but I warn you: The
plan can be confusing. Take it slowly and read carefully so you can best
understand how this coverage can benefit you.
The worst mistake the government made in setting up Part D was to make it
illegal for the government to leverage the power of the 43 million Medicare
recipients to reduce prescription drug costs. The government cannot negoti-
ate lower drug prices for seniors, but it can negotiate lower drug prices for
veterans.
Demystifying the basic drug benefit
You can choose from several options when choosing your drug coverage.
Congress made this a plan available through private insurers rather than
through Medicare, but, of course, the government foots the bill anyway.
Insurers have great flexibility in how they can design their plans, as long 
as they meet the minimum requirements outlined in the following list:
 Anyone who is covered by Medicare Parts A or B is eligible for Part D.
 Your enrollment in Part D is voluntary, but if you do decide to enroll in
the Medicare prescription drug plan, you will pay a monthly premium
for the plan and that premium will depend on the private insurer and the
specific plan you choose. Remember, you have more than 40 to choose
from in most states.

Chapter 10: Exploring Medicare’s Maze of Benefits

 You have to pay a deductible of $250, which means you’ll have to spend
$250 on drugs before your drug costs will be covered under the plan.
 After you’ve met your deductible, you have to pay 25 percent of pre-
scription costs and the insurer will pay 75 percent of the costs. The 25
percent is your co-pay. This division of payments continues until you
spend $500 out-of-pocket on drugs and you receive drugs worth $2,000.
 You then lose all coverage until you spend another $2,850 on drugs. This
is what you’ve probably heard called the donut hole. That’s a nickname
given to this gap in coverage, because you have to pay 100 percent of your
drug costs at this point. By the time you get coverage again, you’ll have to
spend a total of $3,600 out-of-pocket since the beginning of the year (the
$250 deductible, plus the $500 co-pay, plus the $2,850 donut hole).
 Once you’ve spent $3,600 out-of-pocket (that includes the $250
deductible, plus the $500 co-pay, plus the $2,850 in the donut hole) 
and the total value of drugs received is $5,100 ($250 deductible, plus
$2,000 paid by insurer, plus $2,850 paid by senior once the donut hole 
is reached), then you will only pay 5 percent of all future drug costs and
the insurer will pay 95 percent. The amount of co-pays to be paid out-of-
pocket will be adjusted yearly.
Insurers have many alternatives that give you more coverage as long as you
are willing to pay more money in monthly premiums. Most of the alternatives
cover the $250 deductible, and many offer coverage during the donut hole.
Obtaining Plan D prescription coverage
There are two ways to get Medicare’s Plan D prescription coverage: through
the stand-alone Prescription Drug Plan (PDP) or through the Medicare
Advantage Prescription Drug Plan (MA-PD). The average PDP costs $32 per
month nationwide, but there are options in some states for less than $2 per
month or more than $100 per month. I tell you how to sort out the options 
for PDP and MA-PD plans below in “Finding the right plan for you — it can
happen!”
You also must be careful about how you sign up for Medicare Part D if you
qualify for SSI and get help with your Medicare Part B premiums. You must
pick a plan that meets the requirements set by the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services. If you choose one that has premiums that are too high,
you will have to pay out-of-pocket for the additional premium and possibly
co-pays. Be sure to check with Medicare to make sure you pick a plan that
gives you fully paid coverage.

Knowing what to do if you have drug 
coverage from another source
You may be eligible for Part D coverage, but you might not want to sign up for
it. Many people who are eligible already get their prescription drugs from
other sources, such as state plans, retirement benefits from a company or
union, or an alphabet soup of other plans including COBRA, TRICARE, VA,
FEHB, PACE, ESRD, ADAP, and SPAP. If you do get prescription drug coverage
from somewhere else, check with your current provider before signing up for
the new Medicare plan.
If you do get prescription coverage from another source, you need to find out
whether or not your current provider offers a creditable plan. If your plan is
creditable, that means that its coverage is at least as good as Medicare and
probably is even better. If you are currently in a creditable plan, don’t sign 
up for Part D. If you sign up for Part D, you likely will lose your existing drug
coverage and you may even lose your coverage for other medical needs, so
proceed with caution. Check with your current medical insurance provider
before signing up for Part D or a Medicare Advantage Plan.
The sections that follow describe what you should do if you do have pre-
scription coverage from another one of these sources.
Employer or Union Plan
You may still have prescription coverage through your former employer or
union. Most did continue offering prescription coverage in 2006. In fact, 93
percent of employers who provided prescription drug coverage to their
retirees prior to 2006 continued doing so after Part D was available. The future
doesn’t look as rosy though for this coverage, which is usually better than
what is offered under Medicare Part D. By 2010, 50 percent of employers indi-
cate they might not continue to offer prescription drug coverage. Employers
do get an enticement from the government to continue offering prescription
drug coverage, which ranges from about $640 to $825 per individual covered
depending on the type of coverage offered.
State Pharmacy Assistance Program (SPAP)
You may live in a state that still offers a SPAP program. Some states decided
to continue offering these plans after Part D came on the market, others 
cancelled it when Part D started in 2006. To find out more about how your
state is handling prescription drug coverage, as well as other health coverage
for seniors, go to www.statehealthfacts.org and click on the tab for
individual state profiles.
153
Chapter 10: Exploring Medicare’s Maze of Benefits

COBRA
If you have drug coverage through COBRA (which permits you by federal law
to continue your employer-provided health insurance plan for 18 to 36
months after you leave the job), check with your insurer to see if your cover-
age is creditable. If your coverage is creditable, you may want to keep the
COBRA coverage in place. You must make this decision before enrolling in
Medicare Part D. Many COBRA plans will not let you drop your prescription
drug coverage in that plan if you do want to keep the coverage for your other
medical needs. If you decide to keep your COBRA plan and it is not cred-
itable, and then eventually sign up for Medicare Part D, you will have to pay a
penalty of 1 percent for each month you did not enroll in Medicare Part D
after being eligible, plus you will have to wait to enroll in Medicare Part D
until the Annual Coordinated Election Period (November 15 to December 31
each year). I talk more about annual enrollment below.
VA or TRICARE
If you receive your prescription drug coverage from the Department of
Veterans Affairs (VA) or the Military Health Care System (TRICARE), your
drug coverage is creditable and you don’t need to sign up for Medicare Part
D. If you lose your VA or TRICARE benefits in the future, you will have 63 days
after losing those benefits to sign up for Medicare Part D, as well as other
parts of Medicare, without a penalty.
FEHB
If you receive your prescription drug coverage through the Federal
Employees Health Benefits, your coverage is creditable and better than
Medicare Part D. You probably do not want to enroll in a private Medicare
Part D plan.
PACE
If you receive your prescription drug coverage through PACE (Program of All
Inclusive Care for the Elderly), do not sign up for Medicare Part D. If you do
so, you will lose your PACE coverage.
ADAP
Each state designs its own AIDS Drug Assistance Programs, so you will need
to contact your state to find out whether or not you should sign up for
Medicare Part D. In some states, the plans are creditable and even better
than Part D; in other states, the plans are not as good as Part D.
ESRD
If you receive your prescription drug coverage from Medicare because you
are in end-stage renal disease, contact your benefit specialist to determine
whether or not you should sign up for Medicare Part D.

Part II: Your Wallet to Your Health: The 411 When You Re-Enter the Workforce 

Ensuring the drugs you take are covered
Another major mess created with this plan is trying to find a plan that covers
all your medications. Each private insurer has their own drug formulary,
which lists all the drugs that plan will cover. Medicare did develop basic
guidelines for formularies and each insurer must include drugs that are com-
monly used to treat common conditions, but insurers don’t have to cover all
drugs available on the market, and different brand-name drugs are covered
on different plans. The key is to find the private plan that best matches your
drug needs.
Formularies also are developed using a tier structure. Tier 1 are generic
drugs covered by the plan. Tier 2 are the preferred brand-name drugs. Some
plans also have a Tier 3. These are the more expensive, non-preferred, brand-
name drugs for which you may be able to get coverage.
In addition to the formularies and tiers, you’ll also find that most of the pri-
vate plans limit use of certain types of drugs. Plans can limit use in one of
three ways:
 Prior Authorization: They can require that you get prior authorization
from the insurance company before your physician can prescribe the
drug if you want the plan to pay for it. Your physician will have to prove
that your condition requires this drug rather than other drugs on the
formulary that are likely cheaper but don’t work.
 Limit the Quantity: Plans will only coverage a certain dosage of many
common drugs. For example, if you normally take 30 mg of a drug, but
the more common dosage is 10 mg, the insurer may not cover the higher
dosage unless your physician proves to the insurer why you need the
higher dosage.
 Step Approach: Your insurer may require that you try a series of
cheaper drugs and prove that they don’t work for you before they will
pay for the more expensive drug. This is called “step therapy.”
If you have been on a particular drug therapy for a while and the drug plan
you choose does not cover that drug, then the insurer must work with you
and your doctor to transition you to another drug therapy. Plans are sup-
posed to provide you with a 30-day supply to give you and your physician
time to change your prescription or apply for an exception to the formulary.
Each drug plan has a different process for filing for exceptions. You should be
able to find information about the exception process on the plan’s Web site
or call the customer service number for the plan.
155
Chapter 10: Exploring Medicare’s Maze of Benefits

Finding the right plan for you — 
it can happen!
If you explore the Part D mess I describe throughout this chapter, you’re
probably wondering how you can possibly find a plan that is right for you.
Luckily Medicare did develop a decent tool for sorting all this out at its 
Web site www.medicare.gov. There will be a link on the Web site called
“Compare Medicare Prescription Drug Plans.” This link will walk you through
the process of picking a plan. You can also call 800-633-2273 to work with
someone by telephone.
You will need to know the names of all the drugs you take as well as your
dosage in order to use the tool. You’ll need to put in both the name of the
drug and the amount of the drug you take each day or every 30 days.
Once you select a plan, you can only change that plan during the Annual
Coordinated Election Period (ACEP). This period will occur each year from
November 15 to December 31. Even if you are happy with the plan you have,
you probably should check out any new plans that might be better for you
during ACEP. Plans can and will make changes each year as this new program
gets sorted out. Plans can change the list of drugs covered, change the premi-
ums, and change the co-pays each year.
You can only change plans outside the ACEP if one of these three things
happen:
 You move out of the area served by your current plan.
 You enter or leave a nursing home.
 Your plan changes and no longer covers your service area.
Adding up the costs
Your total drug cost will depend on four elements:
 Monthly premium: This is the amount you must pay each month to buy
the Part D benefit.
 Deductible: This is the amount you will need to pay out of pocket before
the insurer will pay anything. For the standard plan, it’s $250, but some
plans do offer a $0 deductible.
156
Part II: Your Wallet to Your Health: The 411 When You Re-Enter the Workforce 

 Co-pay: This is the amount you will pay each time you pick up your drug
from the pharmacy. Co-pays vary greatly among drug plans, so be sure
you look closely at the data.
 Donut hole: Some plans offer no coverage during the donut hole, others
provide full coverage.
The most important number to look for is your total annual costs. Since there
is so much variation regarding types of drugs covered, the amount of your
co-pay, the dosage that may be covered, and whether or not you will have a
deductible or coverage during the donut hole, it’s important to look at the
annual cost number.
Donut hole coverage may be critical for you. Remember that’s the point in the
plan where you get no coverage after you’ve spent $500 and gotten $2,000 in
drugs. Some plans do cover you in the donut hole. Their monthly premium
may be more expensive, but when you look at the total costs of your drugs for
the year, you may find that the coverage during the donut hole will actually
save you money by the end of the year even if the monthly premium is higher.
Paying for Part D coverage
You can pay for Part D in three different ways:
 You can have the premium deducted from your bank account.
 You can have the premium taken out of your Social Security check. The
Part B premium also is taken out of your benefit check.
 You can mail the company a check or money order each month. I don’t
recommend this method. If you forget to send the check, you could lose
your coverage.
If you can’t afford to pay for Part D, you may be eligible for the Extra Help
program. There are three levels of assistance:
 Group 1 includes individuals with incomes below $9,570 (or couples
with incomes below $12,830). Assets cannot exceed $7,500 for individu-
als or $12,000 for a couple. People in this group do not have to pay a pre-
mium for Part D and can get their generic drugs for $1 and their
brand-name drugs for $3.
 Group 2 includes individuals with incomes below $12,919 (or couples
with incomes below $17,320). Assets cannot exceed $7,500 for individuals
or $12,000 for a couple. People in this group can get their generic drugs
for $2 and their brand-name drugs for $5.
 Group 3 includes individuals with incomes below $14,355 (or couples
with incomes below $19,245). Assets cannot exceed $11,500 for individu-
als or $23,000 for a couple.
157
Chapter 10: Exploring Medicare’s Maze of Benefits

Your house and vehicles are not counted as part of your assets for this test.
Less than half of your earned income will be counted, so if you think you are
close to passing the test, you should apply and find out.
Paying for Things Medicare 
Doesn’t Cover
You can encounter a lot of out-of-pocket expenses for Parts A and B, but you
can get supplemental coverage for those costs. If you don’t have coverage
through a supplemental plan offered by your former company or union, you
may want to consider a Medigap or Medicare Advantage Plan (Part C; you
can find more info on these plans earlier in this chapter under “Medicare
Advantage Plans — Part C”).
Medicare Advantage Plans
The Medicare Advantage Plans (Part C) do offer coverage for the deductibles
as well as lower co-pays than you’ll find with Parts A and B. You do need to
pay for Part B before you qualify for Part C, but you may be able to save
money by signing up for a Part C plan.
I talk about the pros and cons of the Medicare Advantage Plans in the section
“Medicare Advantage Plans — Part C,” earlier in this chapter. The key thing
you lose is complete flexibility in what doctor you can choose, but the cost
savings might make sense for you.
Medigap
Another alternative that can give you more flexibility in choosing your doc-
tors is a Medigap supplemental insurance policy. These policies pay your
costs that Medicare doesn’t cover.
Discovering what Medigap can and can’t cover
How much of your costs will be paid depends on the type of Medigap policy
you choose. Your choice will also determine how much your premium will be.
Options available in a Medigap policy include
158
Part II: Your Wallet to Your Health: The 411 When You Re-Enter the Workforce 

 Coverage of the Medicare hospital deductible.
 Skilled-nursing facility daily co-insurance.
 Coverage of the Part B $131 deductible.
 Coverage while traveling outside the U.S. (This is only available for the
first two months of your trip.)
 Coverage of doctor’s fees that exceed the Medicare approved charges.
 Medically necessary home care costs not paid by Medicare.
 Preventive care coverage.
You can’t get coverage for custodial care (such as feeding, bathing, or groom-
ing) at home or in a nursing home or other long-term care facility under the
Medigap plan. You also can’t get coverage for prescription drugs, vision care,
dental care, or a private nurse.
Searching for the right-priced policy
Shop carefully for a Medigap policy. They do differ state by state because
they’re based on state health insurance laws. You’ll find up to 12 different
types of Medigap policies in your state and the insurance companies have
three different ways to price them:
 Community rated premiums: These are based on the cost of providing
coverage in your area. They are not based on age. Premium increases
are based on inflation.
 Issue-age rated premiums: These are based on the age at which you first
buy the plan. Premiums do not increase as you get older. Inflation is the
only reason your premium can go up. The younger you are when you
first buy this insurance, the cheaper your premium will be.
 Attained-age rated premiums: These premiums change each year based
on your age. You will find lower premiums when you first sign up at age
65 for this type of policy, but as you get older you may not be able to
afford the increases to these premiums.
Look for discounts when you shop around for Medigap insurance. Some com-
panies offer better discounts for women. Some offer discounts for nonsmokers.
Some also offer discounts for married couples that sign up for a Medigap plan
at the same time.
Monthly premiums do vary greatly state by state. You can find them as low as
$53 for Medigap A, which is the most basic level of coverage, and as high as
$900 for some of the more comprehensive types of Medigap. Most range
between $100 and $400 monthly.
159
Chapter 10: Exploring Medicare’s Maze of Benefits

Long-term healthcare
Medicare coverage for long-term healthcare maxes out at 150 days. If you need
inpatient care for longer than that, you need to have private health insurance
to cover the costs of that care. This includes care in a hospital, skilled-nursing
facility, assisted-living facility, or even home healthcare services.
Understanding the need for long-term care insurance
Over $140 billion dollars is spent each year on long-term care services. More
than $60 billion of that is paid by Medicaid and about $24 billion by Medicare.
In order to qualify for Medicaid, you must first use up most of your assets.
Long-term care includes anyone who has difficulty performing two or more
activities of daily living including bathing, dressing, toileting, eating, and trans-
ferring from one location to another. Nearly 80 percent of seniors who need
assistance with daily living live at home or in community-based settings, such
as assisted-living facilities. About 20 percent live in nursing homes or other
institutional settings.
If you want to have some control of the level and type of care you’ll be able 
to receive, you should buy a long-term healthcare policy. Without it you’re
limited to facilities that will accept Medicaid if you run out of money and
need long-term care as you get older.
An extended nursing home stay can quickly use up any assets you might
have saved for retirement. Nursing homes cost an average of $3,000 per
month and can be as high as $100,000. For seniors, the average nursing 
home stay is 19 months.
Finding and purchasing a policy
Long-term care insurance can pay for most of that and allow you to avoid dig-
ging into your retirement assets, which you’ll need for other costs of living,
such as food and housing. If you purchase long-term care insurance over the
age of 65, premiums can be high. They range from $2,000 to $10,000 annually.
But, you can lock in a much lower premium level if you buy the insurance at 
a younger age. Usually the best time to buy it is between age 55 and 60 to get
the best rates. But, be sure you buy a policy that locks in your premium level
for life. It doesn’t help to start coverage early if your premium can go up. The
primary reason most people end up dropping long-term life insurance as they
age, when they may have the greatest need for it, is because the premiums
jumped too high and they could no longer afford to pay them.
160
Part II: Your Wallet to Your Health: The 411 When You Re-Enter the Workforce 

Selecting a long-term care insurance policy can be difficult. They are filled
with hard-to-understand legal fine print. You might not even realize that the
policy you choose will actual fall short of what you need until it’s too late.
Your task of picking the right one can be even harder because many policies
are sold through a slick sales presentation in which the salesperson may
overstate what is actually being covered. When you need the coverage years
later, the salesperson will be long gone. Many of these sales presentations are
designed to scare people into buying them.
Don’t rush to make the decision and never sign a contract for a long-term
care policy without taking the time to read it and compare it with other possi-
ble offers. Carefully research options available in your state and seek at least
three proposals before making a decision. You may want to ask an attorney
who is familiar with long-term care contracts to review the contracts you are
considering. The money you spend for that review can save you a lot of
headaches later if you find out that coverage you were expecting is not
included in the contract.
You also want to check out the insurance company that is offering the policy.
If the insurance company does not have a good financial rating, then there is
no guarantee that company will still be around when it comes time to pay for
your benefits. There are two key financial ratings services you can check
online — A.M. Best (www3.ambest.com/ratings) and Standard & Poor’s
(www2.standardandpoors.com). If you don’t have Internet access, you can
find these ratings in a public library.
Getting Medicare Coverage, 
If You Don’t Qualify
Some people were not required to pay Social Security and Medicare taxes 
while they were working. If you worked most of your life for the state or federal
government, this could be true for you. The government entity you worked for
may have started taking out for Medicare late in your working career.
To be eligible for Medicare, you must have worked 40 quarters in which 
you paid into the Medicare system. That equates to 10 years of work because
you earn 1 quarter for every three months. You may also be eligible for
Medicare if you were married to someone who worked for 10 years and paid
Medicare taxes.
161
Chapter 10: Exploring Medicare’s Maze of Benefits

If you have less than 30 quarters of work, you may still be able to buy into
Medicare coverage at age 65. If you have fewer than 30 quarters, your pre-
mium for Part A will be $393 per month. The Part B premium will be $98.40
for a total of $491.40. If you have between 30 and 39 quarters of Medicare-
covered employment, you can get Medicare Part A for $216 per month and
Medicare Part B for $98.40 per month for a total of $314.40.
To determine whether or not you qualify, contact the Social Security
Administration at 800-772-1213 to find out if you have enough quarters 
to qualify for Medicare.

In this part . . .
You’ve likely been out of the job-search arena for a long
time, and things have changed. In this part, I help you
rebuild your job search skills and get ready for some tough
interview questions you’ll likely face as a retiree trying to

many hiring managers believe about older workers, so I
give you ammunition for that as well. Finally, I explore the

f you’re looking for a job during retirement, you probably haven’t looked
for a job in a long time. Searching for a job is so different today than it was
when you first got out of school.
To help you in the hunt, this chapter reviews the skills you need to conduct a
successful job search in today’s high-tech environment. In addition, I discuss
what to include and not to include on your resumé. You can also use this
chapter to figure out how to find jobs that are available.
Building Your Resumé
If you haven’t needed to build a resumé and look for a job for 20 years or
more, be ready to totally change your idea of how to write a resumé. In
today’s fast-paced world, where jobs are posted on the Internet and people
can easily respond with the click of their mouse, companies are inundated
with hundreds of resumés for every job posting.
Often screening of resumés is done by computer using a program that looks
for a set of key words that have been developed specifically for each job
available in the company. If your resumé doesn’t include the requisite key
words, it likely won’t even be looked at by a human being.

Even if a human being does sort through the resumés, initial screening of
each resumé will be done in a matter of seconds per resumé. You must be
certain that you’ve hit the key points in the opening paragraph or two, which
should be a highlight of your accomplishments. In the sections that follow, I
give you all the information you need to build your best resumé.
Keeping up with change
Rules for resumés have changed dramatically over the years. Know today’s
rules before drafting your resumé.
Going over one page
Keeping your resumé to one page is no longer the rule. You should give 
yourself enough space to highlight your critical skills and experience, but 
you don’t need to write a book. Keep your resumé to two pages, unless
you’re looking for a job in academia. Academic resumés frequently can be
four to five pages long if your experience warrants it.
Nixing the line “references available upon request”
You don’t have to include that phrase at the bottom of resumés anymore.
Everyone assumes that to be the case.
Keeping just the key words
You don’t have to list every single job you ever had. Not only will that date
you, but it will also give you little room to highlight your accomplishments
that match specifically the position you’re hoping to get.
Remember, whether it’s a computer program scanning the resumés or a human
being spending just seconds looking at them, you don’t want a lot of extraneous
information on the resumé. You want the resumé to be packed with the key
words that say, “Yes I’m the perfect person for the position you have.”
Your resumé should be a marketing piece that highlights the most critical
aspects of your career. It doesn’t need to have every detail of your working
life. Its only purpose is to get you into the interview where you can really sell
yourself.
Selecting your job history carefully
You don’t have to limit your job history to the last ten years. Pick and choose
the jobs that are the best match for the position you are seeking. Focus on
listing the jobs that are most relevant to the position you are seeking, no
matter how long ago you did that job.
166
Part III: Finding Your Next Job 

Tailoring your resumé
You don’t need to design one resumé that you use for every job application.
In fact, you probably should design several resumés if you are seeking sev-
eral different types of positions. Each resumé can highlight your past work
experience that best matches the type of work you’re seeking.
Your resumé doesn’t have to be limited to paid work either. You may have
worked as a volunteer for many years, while you earned money doing some-
thing else. Now in retirement you want to get paid for the type of work for
which you volunteered in the past. Build a resumé for that type of work
based on your successes as a volunteer.
Avoiding snail mail
You probably went to a copy store and printed out 50 or more copies of your
resumé on top-quality linen stationary in the past. Don’t bother spending the
money. In most cases, you’ll be sending your resumé by e-mail or responding
to a job posting on the Internet. Few people use snail mail to send their
resumé today. If you do, that will date you!
Also, if you get into the habit of just printing out your resumé as you need 
it, you can then tailor each resumé specifically to the job for which you 
are applying. You can be sure that the skills and key words mentioned in a 
company’s ad are clearly spelled out in your resumé. If not, tweak it so it’s a
better match.
Preparing your resumé
You should prepare your resumé in a standard Word format that you can use
to print out the resumé or that you can use as an e-mail attachment. You can
buy a package of quality stationary for the resumés you’ll need to take with
you on a job interview or for the rare occasion when someone asks you to
send in a resumé.
Even if you’ve sent your resumé by e-mail or posted it using an Internet job
site, you should always bring a copy with you to an interview. Many times
your resumé prints out differently than intended when you send it electroni-
cally, so bring a good-looking, clean copy with you.
You should also prepare a resumé in text format that you can cut and paste
into online forms. If you cut and paste from a Word document, you’ll also
copy some formatting codes that will drive the online form crazy. Then you’ll
have to correct all those strange format errors.
167
Chapter 11: Rebuilding Your Job Search Skills

Here are the steps to save a Word document in text format:
1. Click on file and click “Save As.”
2. In the “Save as type” field, click on the down arrow and select “Plain
Text.” You should also give the document a different name. For example,
if you named your resumé “Writing Jobs,” you might want to call this
one “Writing Jobs_Plain Text,” so you can quickly differentiate the docu-
ment when you scan down your list of documents.
3. You will get a warning that you’ll lose all your formatting, pictures, and
objects in the file. That’s okay. You want to lose those things in a plain text
document. You’ll be given the option to save it using Windows (which will
be the default), MS DOS, or other encoding. Use the Windows default.
4. Open the document in the new plain text version and fix any problems
created when you lost the formatting. Yes, it will be a lot of work, but it’s
much easier to do it once on your home computer than do it each time
you cut and paste your resumé into an online form.
Using the employer’s needs
Hiring managers often tell their human resources staff that they just want 
to see the top 10 or 20 resumés. You can only be one of those top 10 or 20
resumés by being as close to a perfect match as possible, which means you
probably need to show that your knowledge and experience meets all the key
skills wanted.
The computer programs likely will be looking to find key words that match
the experience and skills necessary for the job. Even if human beings are
screening resumés, they will not do the hiring. Initially all screening is done
by a lower-level employee who is working off a list developed by the hiring
manager. They want to please the hiring manager by finding resumés that fit
the list.
Researching the employer’s needs
Before even starting to write your resumé, research the types of jobs you
want by reading the advertisements on the key job-search Web sites (such 
as Career Builder). As you look at the detailed job descriptions, you’ll see 
the key words that are commonly used by employers when they write a job
description for a particular type of job. I talk more about Internet search sites
in the section “Tapping the Internet.”
For each type of job you are seeking, you will probably find 10 to 20 key
words or types of skills that all employers want for that type of job. Keep
these in mind as you develop your resumé.
168
Part III: Finding Your Next Job 

For example, suppose you decided that you’d like to work as a bank teller.
Reviewing several advertisements on Career Builders, I found these key 
skills listed:
 Proven customer service skills
 Cash handling skills
 Effective verbal/written communication skills
 Ability to complete a teller training program
 Basic computer skills
If you were looking to apply for a bank teller position, you would then use
this list to develop your resumé.
Your research on the key job sites should give you all that you need to
develop a list of key words that should be found easily in your resumé. Don’t
be afraid to repeat key words in several descriptions of your past jobs if
appropriate.
Highlighting skills that meet those needs
As you begin to write your resumé, highlight skills that meet the needs of
employers seeking to hire people for the types of positions you seek. Pick 
the jobs you’ve worked in over the years that best match the ones you are
seeking even if it means highlighting a job you did more than ten years ago.
For example, when building your resumé for a bank teller position, you should
have a paragraph at the top of the resumé that highlights your experiences
directly related to the key skills listed above, even if they were learned doing
work for a different type of business.
Review your former positions and write descriptions for each position that
include some of the key words and skill sets. For example, if you ever worked
in retail sales or for a fast-food restaurant and had to handle cash, be sure to
highlight that job and its cash-handling aspects, as well as the customer ser-
vice skills you demonstrated in that position. Or if you ran events for a volun-
teer organization and were responsible for the cash collected, you can
highlight that position.
Don’t be afraid to use the same key words in several job descriptions. Many
computer scanning programs score the resumé, and you get the highest
score by having more years doing the required skills. If it’s a human being
quickly scanning through the resumé, the easier it is for him to find the key
words the better chance you’ll get put in the interview pile.
169
Chapter 11: Rebuilding Your Job Search Skills

Emphasizing accomplishments
Company recruiters look for a sign that you’ve been successful in the past. They
want evidence that you did produce in former jobs and will produce for their
company. So, follow these tips to ensure your accomplishments stand out:
 As you write your job descriptions, think about what you accomplished
in each job. Use active words such as “developed,” “organized,” “imple-
mented,” or “established” to show your successes.
 Also put a number to your successes when appropriate. For example, if
you were responsible for selling $3 million in a year, state that. Don’t
leave out the numbers. Quantify your successes when possible.
Avoiding dating yourself
Your resumé needs to show that you are current, and the following two
things will date you quickly if you can’t prove that you’ve kept up with times:
 Terminology: Each industry has its own type of “industry speak,” so be
sure the terms you use on your resumé match what is currently being
used in your industry.
If you’ve got old job descriptions that you plan to reuse, be sure to first
read through publications from professional associations within your
industry. As you look through articles on their Web sites, you will likely
pick up some catch phrases and other terms that are used commonly
today. You may find these common terms are different from terms
you’ve been using over the past 20 years. Be sure to update your job
descriptions using the more recent terms and phrases.
 Technology: Also, if you’ve been on a job for 20 or 30 years, you may 
not be working with the most current technology for the industry. It all
depends on your former company and whether or not they kept up with
the changing times. Or you may have continued supporting the older
hardware and software as your company gradually switched over to the
new technology.
Review job listings in your industry and see what types of technologies
are needed for the jobs that are available. If you do want to stay in your
industry, you may need to go back to school to update your skills before
looking for another job. You probably can find adult-education classes at
local community colleges or possibly even online. I talk more about edu-
cational opportunities in Chapter 19.
170
Part III: Finding Your Next Job 

Taking advantage of writing tips
Writing a resumé can be the hardest thing for most people to do. As you write
your resumé, keep these points in mind:
 Mind your length. You don’t have to limit your resumé to just one page,
but more than two pages could hurt you. Few will read the entire resumé
and some may even be turned off by its windiness. Remember, you only
want to highlight the positions you’ve had in which you can focus on the
key skill sets the person doing the hiring will want to see.
 Avoid personal info. Don’t include information about your family or
your hobbies, unless the information is relevant to the type of job you
are seeking. Also, don’t include your height, age, weight, sex, or religion,
unless it’s somehow related to the position. For example, if you are
applying to work at your church or synagogue, you certainly want to
indicate your religious affiliation.
 Keep it relevant. Be sure all the information you include on your resumé
is relevant to the position you are seeking. Don’t include nonwork expe-
rience, unless it helps to demonstrate skills that you believe are relevant
to the type of job you want. For example, if your hobby is woodworking
and you’re looking for a position where those skills would be helpful,
include information about your hobby.
 Address work gaps. If you took time off to raise your family or care for a
sick parent, you should briefly address that time and turn it into a posi-
tive. You certainly learned skills that could be useful. For example, if you
are thinking of applying for a position as a home health aide, the skills
learned caring for an elderly family member would be relevant to your
job search.
 Check your spelling and grammar carefully. You could be the perfect
person for the job, but if the hiring manager sees typos on your resumé,
you may not even make it into the door for an interview. Errors on the
resumé indicate to an employer that you’re not detail oriented.
Formatting Your Resumé
Traditionally resumés have been formatted in chronological order. That may
not be the best thing for you if you are thinking about going back into the
workforce after retirement, especially if you don’t want to work at the same
type of job from which you just retired.
171
Chapter 11: Rebuilding Your Job Search Skills

If you’re changing fields, it’s possible that your hobbies or volunteer work 
may be more relevant than your most recent jobs. Many people who go back 
to work after retirement seek jobs that they would enjoy doing. But, they 
couldn’t take the risk of changing careers when a steady income was so 
critical.
For those of you looking to change careers, your best choice may be a 
resumé that shows your chronological work history, but highlights your 
functional skills. Here are the parts of this type of combination resumé:
 Contact info: You should include your name, address, telephone
number, and e-mail address. Many human resources departments 
prefer to contact candidates initially by e-mail rather than play 
phone tag.
 Highlights or summary: Summarize the highlights of your career. 
Be sure to use the key words that match the list you compiled 
researching the necessary job skills for the type of position you 
are seeking.
 Experience: Don’t list your job history in this section. Instead prepare 
a series of paragraphs that talk about your skills and prove that you
have the skills needed for the job. For example, looking at the skill list
for the bank teller above, you would write a paragraph about Cash
Handling, Customer Service, Verbal/Written Communications, and
Computer Skills. Write these paragraphs using brief sentences that 
highlight your accomplishments. In the Cash Handling paragraph, you
may talk about your volunteer work where you handled cash, such as
managing the collection of over $100,000 at each event you ran for
Junior Achievement.
 Work history: Use this section to provide a list of your previous jobs 
in chronological order. Each job can be just one line that includes your
job title, your company, and your dates of employment.
 Education: List your degrees and the schools you’ve attended with any
related information about your course emphasis.
 Certifications or technical skills: If you have related certifications or
technical skills that are relevant to the type of job you seek, include
them in this section.
I give you an example of how this resumé looks in Figure 11-1.
172
Part III: Finding Your Next Job 

Using Your Network
While many people spend most of their time searching the Internet job sites
or answering ads in the newspapers, the reality of the situation is that 80 per-
cent of jobs are filled through networking and only 20 percent are filled from
job ads in the newspaper or on the Internet.
Summary
Write two or three sentences that summarize the parts of your former career that highlight
your accomplishments directly related to the position you are seeking. Remember to use
the key words in this summary.
Experience
Skill One (i.e. Cash Handling Skills)
Write a summary that highlights your skills in this area. Be sure to start each sentence
with an action word that emphases your accomplishment, such as “managed,”
“organized,” “implemented,” or “developed.”
Skill Two (i.e. Written/Verbal Communication Skills)
Again write a summary as described in Skill One.
Skill Three (i.e. Computer Skills)
Again write a summary as described in Skill One.

Chapter 11: Rebuilding Your Job Search Skills

Your networking will do more to help you find a job than hours spent quietly
in your home writing the best resumé and top-notch cover letters. In Chapter
4, I talk about the six steps to building and maintaining your network. If you
don’t know how to build a network, review those steps.
Once you’ve got an active network in place, you won’t have any trouble 
tapping into it for job leads and job introductions. Remember, hundreds 
of people answer each job posting, whether it’s on the Internet or in a news-
paper advertisement.
If you want your resumé to get to the desk of the person making the job hiring
decision, it helps to have an inside contact. With so many unknown people
coming through human resources, a known entity recommended by an associ-
ate or friend often is more likely to make it to the top of a job interview list.
Tapping the Internet
You’ll find a wealth of information on the Internet. In addition to job listings,
you can research how to improve your job-searching skills, as well as do
research about the companies that you plan to approach. The more you
know about a company, the better you can target your cover letter and your
resumé to match the company’s needs. You’ll also present yourself as a much
stronger candidate when you get to the interview. So don’t only think of the
Internet as a communication and job-search tool, also plan to use it for
research so you can make a better overall approach for the job you want.
Scouring job-listing sites
Most people looking for a job will visit the well-known job Web sites such as
Career Builder (www.careerbuilder.com) and Yahoo! careers (careers.
yahoo.com). But, there are many others out there that you might find better.
The big Web sites may have lots of job listings, but they also get lots of visi-
tors, so that means you’ll be competing with hundreds if not thousands of
applicants for each job.
You may want to visit the lesser-known Web sites that are more targeted 
to the types of jobs searches you’re interested in pursuing. In Chapter 4, I
mention a few good ones that focus on seniors including YourEncore (www.
yourencore.com), Seniors4Hire (www.seniors4hire.org), Employment
Network for Retired Government Experts (www.enrge.us), and Senior Job
Bank (www.seniorjobbank.org). You can find out more about what each
one of these job sites offers in Chapter 4.
174
Part III: Finding Your Next Job 

Another good place to find alternative, less busy job sites is to use the
Google directory (www.google.com/Top/Business/Employment/Job_
Search), which lists over 50 job search sites. You’ll also find job sites grouped
by industry, executive search, seasonal, staffing services, and worldwide.
If part of your retirement dream is to spend a lot of time traveling, check out
the worldwide firms listed at Google. You may find some interesting opportu-
nities that can help your dream come true. In addition to job listing sites,
you’ll find sites for resumé building and interviewing advice.
Checking in on company Web sites
Company Web sites provide you with a wealth of information. In addition to
scouring a company’s job openings, you can find a great deal of information
about the company, its mission and goals, and its future plans.
Take the time to read the most recent annual report to find out more about
what the company did during the past year and what it plans to do in the
future. You may have looked at annual reports before, but didn’t read the fine
print. Many people just enjoy looking at the pretty pictures and reading the
large, glossy text. That’s not where you’ll find the most useful information.
Unfortunately, to get the most useful information, you will have to read the
fine print. Get out those magnifying glasses!
175
Chapter 11: Rebuilding Your Job Search Skills
Posting your resumé online
When you post a resumé online, it’s like putting
up an ad about you that anyone can read, even
folks you may not want to hear from, such as
spammers or scammers. Be aware that if you
do decide to post your resumé, you will get a lot
of garbage e-mails.
So, if you plan to post your resumé, your first step
is to get an e-mail address that you’ll use solely
for online posting. You can get them easily for
free at Yahoo! or Google, if your provider doesn’t
let you set up a unique address or if you want to
limit the mail coming directly into your computer.
When you use the online e-mail services, you
pick up your mail online and then decide if you
want to forward it on to your primary e-mail
account on your computer. This gives you an
extra veil of protection against viruses and other
sorts of bugs, as well as limits the amount of mail
you get on your home computer.
Also, if your resumé is more than one page, con-
sider adding key words to your second page to
be sure all computer scanners recognize those
skills and alert recruiters who may be looking
for your particular set of skills. You can do that
by hiding your key words on the second page of
your resumé at the bottom of the page. You cer-
tainly don’t want people to see those words, so
change the text color for those key words to
white before posting the resumé. That way your
key words won’t print out when the recruiter
gets your resumé, but a scanning program will
pick them up.

Your best place to look for key information about what the company did over
the past year and what it plans to do in the future is a section of the annual
report called, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis.” You can use the
information to find out about key future plans. Once you have a good idea 
of where the company wants to go, you can use that information to develop
your cover letter.
If you read about a project planned for the future that you think would be
perfect for you, use the company’s language as you develop your letter
spelling out your prior experience directly related to that new project. You
could just hit the right cord and be picked out of the pack of hundreds of
applicants just because you showed that you do your homework, making 
you a good potential asset for the company.
You may want to start by looking up the best companies for people over 50 
to find a few companies that you want to target in your area. In Chapter 14, 
I talk extensively about the AARP’s program for recognizing top employers
that actively recruit people over 50. In most cases, these employers provide
benefits packages directly targeted to meet the needs of retirees that want to
go back to work.
Once you’ve picked a few companies that interest you from AARP’s list, visit
their Web sites, find out more about each company and its programs for
people over 50, and then search for available jobs on the company’s Web site.
You can find the list of best employers at AARP’s Web site: www.aarp.org/
money/careers/employerresourcecenter/bestemployers.
Looking through the Classifieds
You can also search for jobs using a more traditional approach by reading
advertisements in newspapers or looking for jobs on job-posting boards at
places that you frequent.
Newspapers
Your daily and weekly newspapers probably have an employment section.
Most often the best day to use the newspaper’s employment section is
Sunday, when the greatest number of job ads can be found.
But, you may not realize that many newspapers also offer their advertisers
the ability to post the job listings on the newspaper’s Web site. That way you
can check for jobs regularly as the newspaper gets new ads throughout the
week. You can even use the newspaper’s Web site search capabilities to
quickly find job listings that match your key words. That can be a lot faster
than looking through pages and pages of job ads that don’t interest you.
176
Part III: Finding Your Next Job 

Grocery stores
You may not think a grocery store is a likely place to find job listings, but
many of the larger food store chains do have boards where people can post
all kinds of things, such as jobs available, items for sale, or pets that need a
home. Often a small business that doesn’t want to be inundated with hun-
dreds of resumés and that wants to find a person that already lives nearby
will post an announcement on these types of job boards.
Senior centers
Many communities have senior centers that offer daily activities for older
members. You can find them at YMCAs, Jewish Community Centers, as well
as at centers run by community groups.
Often one service offered by these centers is to help members find jobs and
to help employers find seniors to fill positions. If you are a member of a com-
munity center, find out if they do have a program for seniors that includes
job-searching services.
Churches or synagogues
Don’t forget to contact the church or synagogue to which you belong. Many
religious institutions today do provide job assistance to their members.
Your church or synagogue likely has a job board where members can post
information about positions open in their company to help other members of
the church or synagogue who are looking for work.
If your church or synagogue doesn’t do this, it might be a good way for you
to serve the institution if you help them start such a service. While you’re
doing it, you may find just the right job for yourself!
In addition to being the first person who will learn about all available positions,
you will also be able to expand your network of people who can help give you
an introduction to the hiring manager. The best way to get an interview is to
know someone who can recommend you directly to the hiring manager.
Counting on Your Support Groups
Job searching can be very depressing, especially if you’re getting a lot of
rejections or not getting any responses at all. Don’t be discouraged, but do
look for support.
177
Chapter 11: Rebuilding Your Job Search Skills

Your friends and family likely will offer some support, but they may also be
wondering why you want to go back to work in the first place. They may not
be your strongest support network. You should look to support groups that
are in place and who can provide you with the emotional boost you’ll likely
need as you look for jobs.
In Chapter 4, I talk about how support groups work. If you want to find out
more details about support groups, you can read more about them there.
Senior centers
As I mentioned above, senior centers can be a good source for job listings,
but they can also be a place where you’ll find support groups. Contact the
senior centers you have worked with before or that are located in community
centers with which you are familiar.
If you don’t know of any, call your local YMCA or Jewish Community Center
and they may be able to help you find senior centers or support groups for
job seekers. Your city or town may also have a senior services department
who can help you locate support groups.
Health centers
If you find you are getting depressed, you shouldn’t wait too long to seek
help. You’re facing a lot of changes in your life related to the loss of your
daily work routine and the loss of your network of co-workers. At the same
time, you’re also trying to search for a job.
Many people do face depression during times like these because they are
times of major job stress. Contact your doctor to get references for help if
you are feeling depressed. You can also contact the local mental health
center to find out about support groups in your area.
Churches or synagogues
Another good place to find out about support groups is your church or syna-
gogue. Often these groups are run privately without a major announcement.
Check with your religious leader to find out what support groups are operat-
ing through your religious institution and how you can plug into them.

Surviving the Interview —
Especially Those Tough Questions
In This Chapter
 Psyching yourself up
 Dealing with interview basics
 Answering the tough questions
 Checking out your checklist
G
etting past the interview can be the hardest part of getting a new job,
especially for someone who is a retiree looking to get back into the
work force. Actually, interviews are rough for everyone, not only for older
workers.
This chapter will review the types of interview questions retirees may find
hard to answer, and give you alternatives for how to answer them. I also dis-
cuss good basic interview preparation tasks that can help you improve how
you present yourself during an interview.
Getting Ready for the Interview Mentally
For most people, the hardest thing to do before an interview is calm down
enough to think and answer questions strategically. Even though you’ve done
all your homework, researched the company, and made sure you can clearly
tell your interviewer how your skills match the job, your nerves may make
you forgot all your research and interview preparation.

Understanding the need to stay calm
You need to find a way to calm down. The more relaxed you can be during
the interview, the better you’ll do. You’ll then be able to focus on what needs
to be said and present your real self.
When you present yourself calmly in an interview, you’ll be in a better state
of mind to say what you want to say. Also, you’ll be more aware of any nega-
tive impressions the interviewer may have and try to correct them. I talk
about how to do that in more detail below, when I review dealing with the
hard questions.
Reducing stress before an interview
You can use a number of stress-reduction techniques. Some take a lot of prac-
tice, such as meditation, yoga, and tai chi. But, others you probably can learn
quickly and use successfully. Pick one or two of these and practice using them
before you start interviewing for jobs. Use the one that works best for you.
Visualization
Pick something that makes you feel calm, such as a walk along the beach or
watching a sunset. Close your eyes and picture yourself there. Focus on this
image for two or three minutes. If you are able to focus on the picture and
kick out any other thoughts, you’ll be amazed at how quickly this can calm
you down.
If you need some help, get a CD of nature sounds that match your image and
listen to it at the same time. On the day of your interview, bring a photo that
depicts your favorite place. That will help you visualize in a particularly
stressful situation.
You may even want to paste the image to the inside of your notebook or 
calendar that you plan to bring to the interview. Take a quick look at it while
you are waiting in the office before your interview. The picture could help
you maintain a sense of calm, as you get more and more nervous waiting. I
know that sometimes waiting can be worse than the actual interview.
This relaxation technique is particularly good if you tend to worry a lot before
an interview. Looking at a relaxing image can take the place of worrying.
180
Part III: Finding Your Next Job

Deep breathing
Take a long deep breath through your nose for four or five seconds, then hold
your breath for another four to five seconds, and finally breathe out through
your mouth for the same four to five seconds. If it’s working for you, you
should notice that you feel a sense of relaxation that takes over in your chest,
your shoulders, and other tense muscles.
Repeat this method of deep breathing for at least two to three minutes. The
first few times you try this you may need to make some noise as you breathe
in deeply to help get you started. After you’ve practiced doing this for awhile,
you’ll find you don’t need to make the noise and will still benefit from deep
breathing quietly.
You certainly don’t want to do this noisily waiting to be interviewed. You’ll
attract too much attention and may make a negative impression. Most will
think you’re really nervous if they hear you deep breathing. Some may 
even think it’s the sign of a medical emergency. You certainly don’t want to
bring unnecessary attention to you while you wait.
This relaxation technique can calm the nerves throughout your body and let
you sit in a more relaxed position. You’ll present yourself as calm and confi-
dent in the interview if your body is relaxed.
Thought blocking
You may find that during a stressful situation, your mind constantly second
guesses itself. You’re constantly worrying that you may say something wrong
or have already done so. Or you may frequently criticize yourself as you think
through the answers to questions and don’t really listen to what the interview
is asking. You should instead be focusing on what you want to say next.
Thought blocking helps you control unwanted thoughts. If you are constantly
thinking, “oh no,” I shouldn’t have said that or some other critical phrase,
practice stopping yourself in everyday conversation.
Each time you start being self-critical, just say the word “stop” quietly to
yourself. Don’t say it out loud or people will start looking at you weird and
wondering what you want them to stop doing. You may want to add the prac-
tice of deep breathing when you say stop to help you release tensions and
clear the negative thoughts from your mind.
This relaxation technique should help you gain more control over what you
are thinking and give you the opportunity to concentrate on what you need
to say in the interview.
181
Chapter 12: Surviving the Interview — Especially Those Tough Questions

Reviewing the Basics for Answering
Interview Questions
As a retiree who wants to go back to work, you have more of a challenge
during the interview process than younger workers. Your life has been so full
of work experiences that you tend to have too much to talk about and don’t
focus on the key things specific to the job for which you are applying. So
follow these guidelines to give the best interview:
 Gather relatable experiences. As you prepare for the interview, think
about your experiences that you want to talk about. The experiences
that you pick should be directly related to the job you are seeking.
If you’ve done your homework about the company and its culture, you
should think about experiences in your background that will demon-
strate how you can fit in. Once you get to the interview, if you see that
it’s a very young workforce, talk about experiences you’ve had in the
past working side-by-side with younger workers.
 Let the interviewer know that you will be comfortable being in that
type of the work environment. Do it subtlety though, don’t create a 
barrier that may not be there.
 Read the interviewer’s body language. You should be able to judge by
the interviewer’s body language whether or not the interviewer is com-
fortable talking with you. If you find the interviewer is very nervous and
seems to be looking for a way to get you quickly out the door, you can
either make him more comfortable or just accept that it’s not the right
company for you and move on.
 Avoid talking negatively about your former employers or co-workers.
You’ll look like a complainer and will likely turn off the interviewer.
Instead, if asked about something you didn’t like about your former job,
turn a negative into a positive by giving an example of how you corrected
a problem and improved the working environment for everyone.
 Never criticize the company. Don’t tell the interviewer that the com-
pany is doing something wrong and you know how to do it better. You
don’t want to appear combative or overly critical, but you can make sug-
gestions more gently about how you could improve what they are doing.
 Be ready to ask questions. Make a list of questions based on your
research, and ask several during the interview to show your interest.
You’ll also show how well prepared you are and that you do your 
homework.
182
Part III: Finding Your Next Job

 Always show enthusiasm for the job. Even if it’s something that you’re
planning to do just to make a few extra bucks, show your enthusiasm.
No one wants to hire someone who isn’t even enthusiastic during the
interview. If you’re not exited about the job during the interview, your
interviewer will certainly assume you’re not going to be enthusiastic
when you start work.
 Prepare yourself and practice. Prepare a response for questions you
think you will be asked. Do some research, develop your answers, and
then practice your responses until you are comfortable talking about 
the issue. You may want to develop a list of the tough questions and
then ask a family member or friend to use them to do a mock interview.
If you’d like and you have the video equipment, tape your interview.
Then you can watch yourself and improve your responses. (You can 
get a list of questions just by checking out the section, “Dealing with 
the Tough Questions,” later in this chapter, where I discuss specific
interview questions.)
Answering Basic Questions
Everyone gets asked certain basic questions on interviews, so anticipate
them and think about how you can best answer them to emphasize the key
points you want to make. The three most common interview questions are
 Can you tell me about yourself?
 Why do you want to work here?
 What are your goals?
These questions are actually ice breakers. How you answer them will set the
tone for the interview, so think about your responses and how you can influ-
ence the rest of the interview so that the interviewer focuses on the key
things you want to present.
But, remember these questions are ice breakers. The interviewer is not
expecting a long-winded response. Keep your initial response brief and bring
out the key points you want to make. If the interviewer is interested, he will
then ask a follow-up question about a specific point.
You can control where the interview goes, by saying just enough to peak the
interviewer’s interest and encouraging his desire to learn more. That way he
asks more questions about what you want to talk about.
183
Chapter 12: Surviving the Interview — Especially Those Tough Questions

Getting to know you
When you’re asked, “Can you tell me about yourself?” the interviewer is not
looking for your life history, so don’t go into a long-winded story about your
childhood and how you got to where you are. No one ever wants to hear your
entire life story in an interview situation where they are meeting you for the
first time.
Before you even get into the first interview, think about how you do want to
answer this question. Plan to mention a few personal things that are relevant
to the job you are seeking, point out a few job-related things, and talk about
any educational background that you have that is relevant.
Testing your knowledge of the company
With the question, “Why do you want to work here?” the interviewer is test-
ing your knowledge of the company and its products or its services. If you
did your homework, you should be well prepared to answer this question
based on the research you did on the company’s Web site.
Pick out a few things you want to talk about related to the company’s goals
and missions that you can tie directly to the type of position you are seeking.
Don’t be afraid to even use the company’s wording as you develop your
answer to this question.
If the company actively recruits older workers, mention some of the pro-
grams it promotes to attract older workers that you are particularly inter-
ested in, but only if that program fits the type of job you are seeking. For
example, you may want to discuss benefits that the company promotes to
seniors, such as long-term care insurance. That way you let the recruiter
know the company’s recruitment advertising is working.
Don’t bring up a benefit if it’s not appropriate for the position you are seek-
ing. For example, if the company talks about telecommuting as an option for
its workers and you’re applying for an onsite sales job, it’s obviously not
something you want to discuss as a benefit. Pick the benefits for people over
50 that won’t conflict with the job you want.
Sizing up your longevity
When asking, “What are your goals?” the interviewer is testing how long
you’ll stay around on the job. He probably wants to know if you just want the
job for a year or two or if you think it’s something you’ll take for a lot longer.
184
Part III: Finding Your Next Job

Don’t talk about goals you have outside the company unless they somehow
relate to how you’ll be staying around the area. For example, suppose you
just bought a new retirement home near the company, talk about how you
want to find a way to supplement your retirement income with a position
close to your home.
If you are thinking of starting a small business or doing something else once
you get settled in your new retirement home, and you know that this job is
just a short-term bridge to get some extra bucks, definitely don’t talk about
that. Think instead about how you can answer this question to give the inter-
viewer the impression that you will be at the job for awhile.
Dealing with the Tough Questions
Retirees do get some tough questions that probably aren’t asked of younger
candidates. While age discrimination is against the law, there are lots of ways
you can pick up clues that you may actually be sitting in front of someone
that just doesn’t want to hire you because you are an older worker.
The types of questions asked by an interviewer can certainly give you a clue
to their age bias. In fact, if you are asked many of the questions in this sec-
tion, it could be a sign that your age may be a barrier to your getting the job.
Tough questions for older workers usually fall in one of two areas — questions
related to your qualifications and questions related to your longevity with the
company. Be prepared to answer these questions before you go in. Practice
your answers, so you can answer the questions calmly and in a way that will
be beneficial to your getting the job. You also may need to deal with a lot of
myths people doing the hiring believe. You can get some ideas on how to
answer those in Chapter 13.
Sometimes if the hiring person just won’t hire workers over 50, there is 
little you can do. Yes, you can file a compliant with the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission, but you’ll be waiting months and possibly years
for it to settle. At the same time, word could also get out on the rumor mill
that you are a troublemaker, which can make it harder for you to find a job,
especially if you are looking for one in a small, tightly knit industry. You can
find out more about age discrimination laws in this excellent article at AARP’s
Web site: www.aarp.org/money/careers/jobloss/a2004-04-28-
agediscrimination.html.

How to deal with qualification 
questions, like . . .
While all applicants are asked questions about their qualifications, the types
of questions older workers are asked often differ. In this section, I point out
some of the most difficult questions you could be asked and give you some
ideas of how to answer them effectively. Handled properly, you may even be
able turn a negative into a positive.
You’re overqualified . . . won’t you get bored?
Talk about how impressed you are with the company and its products or ser-
vices. Tell the interviewer how much you would enjoy working for such an
excellent company. Remind him that your experience is exactly what the
company needs.
186
Part III: Finding Your Next Job
Dealing with age discrimination
Don’t be surprised if you recognize signs of age
discrimination as you look for work after you’ve
retired. You do have protections under the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), but
they can be difficult to enforce.
The ADEA states that there must be a lawful
reason that is not connected to age when
making employment decisions. You fall under the
aegis of the ADEA if you are age 40 or over and
you are applying for, or working in, a company
with at least 20 employees. Sometimes age can
be a factor in hiring. For example, if a director
needs a teen to play a particular role in a play,
he can decide not to hire a person over 40.
Even if you are applying for a job in a company
with fewer than 20 employees, you may have
some age discrimination protections in your
state. Many states do have laws that protect
against age discrimination that cover smaller
companies.
The ADEA makes it unlawful for job ads or other
materials to mention age requirements or state
that a certain age is preferred, unless of course
it falls under an exception, such as the need for
a teen to play a particular part in a play. Also, a
company cannot set age limits for training it
offers. Age can’t be a factor in hiring decisions,
when making decisions about promotions, or
when deciding who to lay off.
ADEA also protects you from being forced to
retire at a certain age, but there are exceptions
for certain types of position. For example, many
times people who work in public safety posi-
tions are encouraged to retire at a younger age.
If you do file a complaint with the Equal Em-
ployment Opportunity Commission, the com-
pany can’t take action against you if you are still
working for them, but you may find that infor-
mation about your claim gets passed quietly
among other business managers in your area.

Also point out that with your experience, he won’t need to waste as much
time and money training you. When you’re hired, you can hit the ground run-
ning and begin earning your paycheck much faster than someone with less
experience.
Can you keep up with this fast-track company?
Imagine an employer asking someone in their 20s this question? Sure it’s one
of the clearest signs that age discrimination is lurking somewhere nearby, but
don’t get angry. Discuss your technical knowledge that matches what the
company needs and the strategies you use to stay current on all the issues
related to your field, as well as keep up with technology changes.
If you’re an athlete or have some other story to share to talk about your abil-
ity to stay at the top of your game, you may want to share it when you hear
this question. You can also show your interviewer that you are on the fast
track by talking about your energy and attitudes. You can also discuss how
you dealt with rapid change in your former company and how much you got
done in a day on your last job.
You’ve never worked in this industry; can you transfer your skills?
This question probably is not as related to age as it is to experience, and
could be thrown at anyone seeking to change industries. If you’ve done a
good job of research, you should be prepared with a list of examples of skills
you have that can easily be transferred to the skills needed.
As you prepare for the interview, jot down some ideas that you can discuss
about what you did during your career that matches what you think this 
company made need based on its products and services. Talk about how you
think these experiences and skills will make it easy for you to quickly become
a valuable employee.
Can you relate your past experiences to our current business needs?
You’re likely to be hit with this type of question if you’re changing industries
or type of work. As you prepare for the interview, make a list of past experi-
ences that you think are relevant to the industry in you which you plan to
seek employment or the type of position you are seeking.
Compare this list of past experiences with the industry or job you want to
move into. Identify any skills that you think are relevant, and be prepared to
discuss how they would meet the needs of the hiring manager.
Don’t hesitate to talk about your ability and eagerness to learn new things.
Discuss how quickly you learn things and how much effort you put into any-
thing you do. If you’ve taken some coursework to prepare for the job change,
be sure to discuss the coursework and how that will help meet the new com-
pany’s needs.
187
Chapter 12: Surviving the Interview — Especially Those Tough Questions

How to deal with longevity 
questions, like . . .
Most hiring managers hate the process of hiring people, and hope to find can-
didates who will stay around awhile, so they don’t have to go about hiring
someone again too soon. Older workers frequently will be asked about how
long they plan to stay.
Expect to be asked and decide how you want to respond to longevity ques-
tions before you start interviewing. That way when the discussion starts,
your response will sound sincere and well thought out.
I see you’ve been out of work for over six months, why?
If you’ve been out of work for a while because you lived the life of a retiree
for about six months or more, don’t be afraid to say that. Talk about how you
tried retirement and it didn’t work for you. Let the interviewer know that you
enjoy being more active and believe you have many years of productivity left.
You can also talk about how you wanted to take time off to think about what
to do next and, after carefully researching your options, you’ve chosen to do
the type of work you’re applying for at the new company. Talk about your
research and make the hiring manager comfortable that you have thought
things through and know what you want to do.
Don’t ever give the interviewer the indication that you were looking around
and this job sounded like something you wanted to try out. Be more positive
than that and make your reasons for choosing the particular line of work
clear and decisive.
If you took time to learn a new skill, that’s a great reason to be out of work for
a while. Retraining will show the hiring manager how interested you are in
the job change. Talk about the skills you’ve learned and how you believe they
will contribute to the company.
You’ve moved around a lot, can you explain?
Many older workers have been forced to go from job to job, especially if they
were victims of downsizing in the 1980s and 1990s. Your resume may look
very spotty because of all the job changes you had to take after losing the
career position you had.
188
Part III: Finding Your Next Job

Be ready to talk about and explain your reasons for your job changes. If you
changed fields or industries, you may want to discuss how you had to work
your way back up the ladder, which required job changes to broaden your
knowledge or skills. If you changed jobs for promotions, be sure to point that
out and how quickly you learned and moved up in your new career.
If it’s relevant to your reason for job change, you can discuss the economy
and how you’ve had to make changes to meet the challenges of an ever-
changing economic world. Talk about your willingness to learn new industries
and new skills to stay competitive through this period of dramatic change.
You can easily change the negative of moving around into a positive about
managing and responding to change effectively, but you do have to prepare
and practice your response before the interview so it sounds sincere and
convincing.
You’ve been working as a consultant, is that just a way 
to say you were out of work and looking for a job?
Many people try to make their resumes look better by filling in a long gap
without work with their own consulting business. Hiring managers see it 
all the time, so be prepared to talk about your consulting work if that is on
your resume.
If you continued working for your former company as a consultant so you
could complete several ongoing projects, talk about those projects and why
the company wanted only you to finish them. You should be able to make
yourself sound indispensable and build your credibility.
Now that you’ve finished the projects, you’re ready to start work on some-
thing new and exciting. Talk about how the position fills your desire for a
new challenge.
If you have just used “consultant” as a filler, you may want to joke about it,
but you’re probably better off not trying to hide the fact that you were out of
work. Instead, talk about what you did do to keep yourself competitive in the
marketplace.
Be ready to discuss how you filled your day, which could include reading pro-
fessional journals to keep up on the most current information in your field or
maybe to catch up because you just didn’t have the time to read all that stuff
when you were working full-time.
189
Chapter 12: Surviving the Interview — Especially Those Tough Questions

You may just have been looking for work, so be prepared to handle the ques-
tion without sounding guilty. Know what you want to say, because if you have
a significant gap on your resume. You will be asked about it.
You’ve been at one company so long, can you adapt to our company?
You may be someone who worked all your adult life at one company, or least
for the past 20 or 30 years before retiring. While that makes you look like a
very stable person, it also may make you look like you’ll have a hard time 
getting used to a change.
You can handle this type of question in several different ways. One way is just
to say that you’re looking forward to a change. You waited around to get your
retirement benefits, but now that you qualify, you’re eager to do something
different. After much research, you’ve decided this is exactly the right type 
of position for you. Talk about the research you did and how you came to the
decision to seek work in the field for which you are interviewing.
You can also talk about all the changes your former company went through
over the years and how you thrived during those periods. If you led the
change during one or more of those periods for your former department 
or company, be ready to discuss your change-management skills and what
you learned about change. This will help to convince the hiring manager 
that you handle change well and are worth considering for the position you
are seeking.
Preparing an Interview Checklist
I’m a big believer in preparing lists, especially when I expect to be nervous
about doing something. Everyone tends to forget things when they are ner-
vous. So the day before an interview, use the checklist in Figure 12-1 to be
sure you’ve reviewed all the key points for the interview and you’re ready 
to make a great impression.
I recommend you review the checklist the day before the interview, so you
have time to fix any last-minute problems. You should also take one more
quick look at the checklist before you walk out the door for the interview, 
just to be sure you’re not forgetting anything — like your Social Security 
`card, driver’s license, or other documentation you planned to bring.
190

You are prepared to discuss the education and/or
training that qualifies you for the job.
You know which hobbies or activities you want
to discuss that are relevant to the job.
You can write down your employment history on
an application accurately or you have the detail with

traveling to a location for the first time, do a test
run before the day of the interview to be sure you
know where the interview will take place and how
long it will take you to get there.

Overcoming Myths About Older
Workers During Your Job Search
In This Chapter
 Debunking training myths
 Pounding productivity myths
 Dealing with cost myths
M
yths about older workers can do more to damage your chance of being
hired than anything you write in your resume or say in an interview.
Unfortunately, myths about older workers abound, and many times you don’t
even know if the person doing the hiring believes them. You need to under-
stand these myths and counteract them when they rear their ugly head. This
chapter will review the myths and arm you with the facts you can use to dis-
prove them.
Going Toe to Toe with Training Myths
Many employers still believe these two well-debunked training myths:
Myth 1: You can’t teach an old dog new tricks.
Myth 2: Training older workers is a lost investment because they will not
stay on the job for long.
Both have been disproved in study after study. I give you the ammunition you
need to quickly disprove these myths in a conversation with employers who
seem to be hinting that they don’t think its worth the time and expense to
train you for the job.

Emphasizing your ability to learn
Many employers think you can’t teach an old dog new tricks. However,
although you may experience a negligible loss of cognitive function as you
age, the experience, knowledge, maturity, and loyalty you bring to a company
quickly overcome any of the negatives. Older workers do tend to take longer
to absorb completely new material, but their better attitudes toward study-
ing new things, as well as their accumulated experience, more than makes up
for the time. In fact, the experience and knowledge older workers bring to the
table actually lowers the costs of training them. In fact, people 50+ are one of
the fastest-growing populations on the Internet. Those in the 50+ age group
have the financial resources, and, if needed, can get help from their children
and grandchildren.
When interviewing, be sure to discuss your experience in learning new tech-
nologies both on the job and at home. Tell potential employers how much
you enjoy learning new technologies. If they buy into the myth that you can’t
learn anything new, you can dazzle them with your love of learning.
Leveraging your longevity
Many employers believe that older workers aren’t worth training because
they won’t stay long enough with the job, but this myth couldn’t be farther
from the truth. In reality, people over 50 are more likely to stay with a job
than their younger colleagues. Younger workers frequently are still trying to
find their niche, changing jobs to experiment with career alternatives and
company choices.
Mid-career employees have been there and done that. They’ve navigated
their job changes and chosen their career directions or redirections, as the
case may be. And the trend in desire to change jobs levels out in the 50s.
Older workers tend to be more engaged in their work and more committed to
their organization. In fact, human resources managers list loyalty and dedica-
tion as the number one quality for older employees. The number two quality
is commitment to doing quality work. Certainly two excellent reasons to train
the older worker.
When it comes to technology, how long of a commitment does the employer
need from a worker after he or she is trained? Since new technology arrives
at workers’ doorsteps every two to three years, and even more frequently in
some fast-paced industries, there is little chance that over-50 trainees won’t
outlast the technology they are being taught today.
194
Part III: Finding Your Next Job 

Talk about your experiences and how they have helped you to find just the
right job for you based on your knowledge and experience. Discuss how the
job that’s on the table fits your profile for the ideal job and that you are less
likely to look for something new once you find that ideal job. The best way to
debunk the myth that you won’t stay long is to prove that the job available is
a perfect match for you given your knowledge and experience.
Poking Holes in Productivity Myths
When it comes to productivity, three myths can be particularly difficult to
overcome when you talk to employers who believe the following myths:
Myth 1: Older workers are not as productive as younger workers.
Myth 2: Older workers are less flexible and adaptable.
Myth 3: Older workers are not as creative or innovative.
All three myths have been debunked by study after study. I discuss each of
these myths in the sections below and give you the ammunition you need to
disprove them if you suspect your potential employer believes any of them.
Pointing out your increased productivity
The official definition for productivity by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics is
“the ratio of output of goods and services to the hours of work required to
produce that output.” No one actually collects information by age and job, so
there are no specific numbers to debunk the myth that older workers are less
productive. Instead, you must look at studies that have been done that focus
on the relationship between productivity and aging to give you the facts you
need to debunk this myth.
195
Chapter 13: Overcoming Myths About Older Workers During Your Job Search
Home Depot believes “Passion Never Retires”
Home Depot, one of the leaders in debunking the
over-50 myths, actually designed an entire
recruitment campaign to attract older workers
called “Passion Never Retires.” Home Depot has
an immense need for skilled, knowledgeable,
and passionate employees. They’ve found that
over-50 workers bring extensive experience and
provide good leadership, which benefits their
stores nationwide. Home Depot even has a pro-
gram called the “snowbird special” to attract
retirees who want to return to work after retire-
ment. Snowbirds usually live half the year in the
north (during the warmer months) and half the
year in the south to avoid the cold. Home Depot
lets them work in both places.

Some studies that seem to support this myth (and probably these are what
fuel the misconception held by many employers today) conclude that worker
productivity begins to decline between the ages of 30 and 40. These studies
focused on manual dexterity and work-and-motion observations. Others
found there was no significant relationship between productivity and age.
Studies that will help you debunk this myth focus on acquired knowledge and
how that can compensate for age-related effects of declines in mental effi-
ciency. One key study was done by Neil Charness, who studied experienced
chess players versus less experienced ones. He found experienced chess
players can remember more detail about familiar, structured chess positions
than players with less experience and skill. Charness’s finding has been con-
firmed by researchers studying the productivity implications of aging. Study
after study has proven that experience in a domain can offset cognitive
declines that may occur with age.
Companies tend to avoid hiring older workers for fast-paced jobs that require
speed of execution, but study after study shows that communication skills
and decision-making skills continue to sharpen with age, which can more
than compensate for any declines in manual dexterity. For example, one
study that looked at hotel clerks found that while older clerks handled calls
more slowly, they achieved a higher success rate by making more bookings
than the younger clerks.
Don’t let employers use the excuse that you’re too old to handle a fast-paced
job. Give them examples of how your communication and decision-making
skills can more than make up for any decline in your manual dexterity.
Advertising your adaptability
Employers may be fooled into thinking that older workers are less flexible
than younger workers. However, although older workers may not be able to
turn cartwheels the way they used to, they’re just as adaptable to change as
younger workers.
Older workers are more likely to ask why, but that’s not because they’re
trying to be difficult. Older workers have seen many changes in processes
and procedures during their work life in the past. Too often these changes
have been abandoned in midstream because they didn’t bring about the
expected rewards quickly enough. So, older workers will question the rea-
sons for the change and help to make that happen more quickly once they
buy into the process.
In fact, one researcher, Dr. Tracey Rizzuto, at Louisiana State University, stud-
ied the ability of younger versus older workers to accept change when she
looked at the upgrade to computer systems in the state of Pennsylvania. She
found that older workers were more willing to learn the new technology than
196
Part III: Finding Your Next Job 

their younger counterparts. Although she found some isolated examples 
of older workers who resisted change, generally the older workers saw the
value of the change and felt an obligation and loyalty to their co-workers to
learn and implement the new technology.
You can easily debunk this myth by talking about change processes you’ve
experienced in the past and how you have helped to make the change happen.
Capitalizing on your creativity
No myth could be further from the truth than the one that has employers
believing that older workers aren’t creative or innovative.
Creativity can be found in two forms: completely new ideas never tried
before and new ideas that expand upon or change current practices.
Although younger people primarily come up with new ideas that have 
never been tried before, the older, more experienced worker can better 
come up with new ideas that expand on or change current practices, based
on experience. So older workers are creative from a different perspective.
Organizations need both types of creative talent. There’s no question that
today’s workplace needs the employee commitment and knowledge that
comes with experience. In today’s competitive environment, experience can
be a far more important driver in the workplace. Companies do need the
younger minds who can create things from pure novelty, but they also need
the older minds who can look at what’s being done and use their experience
and knowledge to find new and better ways of doing things.
When applying for a job, talk about the innovations you put into place over
the years at your former workplaces. Show that you can be creative and how
your experience can help the company find new and better ways to improve
their processes.
197
Chapter 13: Overcoming Myths About Older Workers During Your Job Search
Factoring in creativity in the over-50 set
If anyone tries to tell you that once you hit 50
you’re over the hill and not creative, you just
need to remind them of some of our greatest
thinkers and most creative people in history:
 Giuseppe Verdi composed Ave Mariaat age 85.
 Martha Graham performed until she was 75
and was a choreographer into her 90s.
 Benjamin Franklin invented bifocals at 78.
He needed to find a way to correct his own
vision problems.
 Frank Lloyd Wright worked on his design for
the Guggenheim Museum into his 90s. He
died at the age of 91.

Coping with Cost Myths
All companies look for ways to cut their costs. Labor costs definitely take the
largest chunk out of most companies’ budgets. That’s what makes the myths
related to costs some of the hardest to overcome when you’re a retiree look-
ing to reenter the workforce. The three common cost myths are
Myth 1: Older works cost more than hiring younger workers.
Myth 2: Benefit costs are higher for older workers.
Myth 3: Accident costs are higher for older workers.
Unfortunately, if the employer has already bought into these myths, you
probably won’t even get called in for an interview. You may be able to over-
come these myths if you hear about them when networking with others
already inside the company. I debunk the myths with facts in the sections
that follow.
If you suspect cost issues are a factor when trying to get an interview with a
company, try using some of these facts in a creative way when writing your
cover letter — especially if you can talk about your cost-cutting expertise you
developed during your past work experiences.
Keeping reality in check when 
it comes to your paycheck
Yes it’s true that the 55-year-old worker who’s been with a company for 25
years or more likely will earn more than a 30-year-old worker who’s been in
the same job for only 5 years. But, the older worker likely assumes greater
responsibility and performs at a higher productivity level because of his or
her experience.
When you are a retiree returning to the workforce at a new company, you
won’t command the same income level as the person who has worked for 
the company for 30 years. Today’s employers pay according to the market
rate for a position regardless of age. Service, position, and performance are
the primary drivers of cash compensation, so age shouldn’t be a factor in
determining cash compensation. No significant difference in pay should be
expected for a 45-year-old or 55-year-old doing the same job at the same level
of performance.
Don’t expect to command the same salary you did at your former company.
While job hunting, if you seek a lot more than the market rate for a new
employee in the type of position for which you are applying, you likely 
won’t get the job.

Telling the truth about benefit costs
The three key benefits that cost the most for any company include healthcare
costs, retirement costs, and paid time off. In the following sections, I sort out
the actual cost factors and how you can reveal the truth about these cost fac-
tors to potential employers.
Healthcare costs
Rising healthcare costs worry all companies that provide health benefits to
their employees. How to deal with these costs continues to be one of the
biggest concerns for all companies. Use the following list to overcome some
misconceptions you may hear during your job hunt when the issue of health-
care costs is discussed:
 Although as people age they are more likely to use more medical services,
companies must also consider that older workers likely have fewer depen-
dents, which helps to offset some of the rising claims costs.
 Although age factors into how much workers utilize healthcare, some of
the key risk factors, including high blood pressure, obesity, high choles-
terol, smoking, and alcohol use, drive up healthcare costs more than age
alone and can be an issue for much younger people.
 Healthcare costs incurred by older workers may not be as high as
expected because older workers have proven that they’re better part-
ners than younger workers in finding ways to become better consumers
in healthcare purchasing, such as looking for generic drugs when avail-
able. They also are more willing to accept the fact that they must pay a
larger share of their health services than younger workers.
Retirement benefit costs
You shouldn’t need to discuss retirement benefits when looking to return to
work because retirement benefit costs for workers returning to the workforce
after they already retired are no different than those costs of newly hired,
younger workers. In today’s world, most companies offer a 401(k)-style retire-
ment plan, where both the company and the employer contribute to the plan.
In some cases, the employer doesn’t even contribute to the plan.
Age is not a factor in determining what the employer contribution will be.
The primary factor is the amount of time the employee has worked for the
company and his salary.
If you are returning to work for the same company from which you have
retired, be sure to talk with your benefits specialist to find out how that
might impact any retirement benefits you are now receiving. Each company
has a different set of rules regarding their retirement benefits.

Chapter 13: Overcoming Myths About Older Workers During Your Job Search

Paid time off
You shouldn’t have to worry about paid time off being a negative factor for
cost considerations of hiring older workers. Vacation, holidays, and personal
days depend on a person’s length of service with a company. Age should not
be a determining factor for paid time off.
Older workers going back to work after retirement may want to discuss the
possibility of more unpaid time off. If you do want to go back to work, but
want more flexibility to take time off unpaid to be able to travel or do other
“retirement” type activities, be sure to discuss that up front during the inter-
view. While it may not cost the company anything when they don’t have to
pay you, if they don’t have a plan for how to get the work done while you’re
gone, you may not have a job when you come back. Find a company and a job
that allows you that unpaid time off flexibility.
Accident costs are higher for older workers
If an employer expresses concerns that as an older worker you may be more at
risk of being involved in an accident, remind him that studies show older, more
experienced workers are less likely to drive accident costs up for a company. 
In fact, older workers take fewer risks in accident prone situations. They’ve
learned from experience what they can do safely and what they should avoid.
Statistically, older workers have fewer accidents than younger workers.

Your Hourly Options
In This Chapter
 Going part time
 Locating employment agencies
 Working from home
 Reviewing the top part-time jobs
You don’t have to look for a full-time job. You may decide you want to
work part-time or just work certain days of the week. Know how much
you want to work before you start looking, and then look for opportunities
that meet your time requirements.
This chapter discusses the variety of opportunities seniors can find in the
workplace, from working part-time at a job location to working at home
through telecommuting. Also, I discuss employment agencies that seek to
place workers over 50.
Seeking Part-Time Work
If you’re like most people, as you get near your full retirement age, you’re
looking forward to slowing down. You may not be ready to spend 100 percent
of your day figuring out what to do in retirement though. Instead, you want to
find less stressful work that requires fewer hours so you can do some of the
things you’ve been putting off for years while working in a highly stressful
full-time position.
Other people find once they start retirement that they just don’t have enough
money to make ends meet. They would like to make some extra cash, but
don’t won’t to get back into the daily grind of a full-time job.

Considering your needs and wants
When looking for a job, you’re not in the same position you were in when you
first got out of school. You know what your ideal working conditions would be
and you know what you absolutely don’t want to accept in working conditions.
Looking for your own ideals
Whatever your reasons for wanting to go back to work part-time, you will find
many different options depending on your interests and skills.
The three key things most older workers seek when looking for a new job
include
 Ability to set your own hours: Older workers want more flexible sched-
ules. Many employers do offer flexible scheduling where workers can
choose when they want to begin and end their work day. You will find
that the employer usually sets a core time of the day when you must be
in the office.
 Ability to take time off when needed: Older workers often have family
members who they must care for or they find they must deal with other
life priorities. Many retirees who go back to work part-time want the
type of job where the company can be flexible about time off.
 Benefits that answer your needs: Older workers have specific needs,
such as healthcare insurance, long-term care insurance, and assistance
with eldercare or grandchild care issues.
Finding a job that factors in what’s important to you
If you’re looking for specific things that are important to you (see the list in
the section earlier in this chapter), be sure to discuss them even before you
get hired. You and the employer should have a clear agreement on these
issues or neither of you will be happy when these issues crop up.
How do you find these types of ideal working conditions? One good way is to
watch for clues that the company’s hiring processes, training, benefits, and
alternative work arrangements welcome older workers. Here are some clues
you should watch for:
 Recruiting: Companies whose ads mention that they are looking for
maturity, decision-making skills, and work experience likely will hire
older workers. A really good sign is an employment ad that is designed
to appeal to older workers.
202
Part III: Finding Your Next Job 

 Training: Companies that indicate they offer training to workers of all
ages clearly welcome older applicants. If during the hiring process the
employer makes it clear that you should take advantage of all training
opportunities, you know that the company is serious about the training
being offered and that it will be available to older workers.
 Health benefits: Companies seeking to hire older workers will include
some benefit options that are critical to people as they age, such as
long-term care insurance. Read the benefit package that is being offered.
If you see that it appeals to workers of all ages, you’ve found an age neu-
tral employer.
 Flexible work arrangements: If you find an employer that offers flexible
work schedules, such as flextime or telecommuting, you’ve found a good
place to work. The best possibility is a firm that has already established
a phased retirement program (I talk more about them in Chapter 15). If
this type of program does exist in a company, then it won’t be hard for
you to discuss your needs for a flexible work arrangement. The com-
pany already recognizes the needs of its older workers if they have a
phased retirement program.
Finding the best of the best for part-time
work and flexible schedules
Your quickest way to find the best employers for older workers is stopping
by AARP’s “Best Employers for Workers Over 50 Program” at www.aarp.
org/money/careers/employerresourcecenter/bestemployers/. At
this site, you can find a list of all the companies that have been named a best
employer during the seven years since AARP started the program (www.
aarp.org/money/careers/employerresourcecenter/bestemployers/
winners/2006.html). You can click on the link for any employer listed and
get details about the employer’s innovative programs for workers over 50, as
well as a link to the employer’s Web site so you can find out what types of
jobs are available.
Just to give you an idea about the innovative programs AARP has found
through its “Best Employers for Workers Over 50 Program,” I want to focus
on the number one winner of this award in 2005 and 2006 — Mercy Health
System in Wisconsin (see the sidebar, “Mercy! What a great job!” for more
info). If more companies realized the benefits of these innovative programs,
your job search would be easy.
Mercy Health System is innovative in so many aspects of its hiring and bene-
fits that I review some of its key programs in the sections that follow so you
know what to look for and ask about as you conduct your own job search
near your home.
203
Chapter 14: Working 9 to 5 or Not! Exploring Your Hourly Options

Recruiting
Mercy conducts recruiting using e-cards (e-mails in the form of a card sent to
potential employees) and direct mailings to targeted lists of mature workers
and retirees. It also recruits new employees by sponsoring booths at job and
product fairs that target senior populations. Personal recommendations from
other happy employees are another tool Mercy uses to find workers over 50.
Cultural and learning opportunities
Many different types of cultural and learning opportunities are offered to
both its full- and part-time staff including tuition reimbursement, in-house
classroom training, on-line training, and certification programs. Employees
must work at least 20 hours a week to be eligible for the tuition reimburse-
ment program and certification classes.
Health benefits
Both full- and part-time employees who work at least 20 hours a week get
individual and family medical and dental coverage including prescription
drug coverage. In addition, they get long-term care insurance and short-term
disability insurance. Employees must work at least 36 hours a week to get
long-term disability benefits. Health benefits for employees 65 and older
include spousal medical and drug coverage, dental insurance, and long-term
care insurance. Even new hires are eligible for these health benefits when
they retire.
204
Part III: Finding Your Next Job 
Mercy! What a great job!
Mercy’s Health System recognized the shortage
of healthcare employees and realized there was
a large untapped resource of potential workers
over the age of 50. It developed its human
resources program with that focus in mind. In
2006, 28 percent of Mercy’s workforce was over
the age of 50 and 16 percent of the new hires in
the past year fit in the age group.
Rather than losing the older health worker, as
many hospitals are facing today, Mercy’s
employees stay around thanks to its innovative
programs. The average tenure of its workers
over the age of 50 is 10.25 years.
Mercy won the AARP award for the second year
in a row because of these flexible work options:
 Weekender program:Employees can choose
to work on weekends only.
 Traveler Option: Employees can take work
assignments based on 6- to 13-week assign-
ments and travel in between.
 Registry pool option: Employees can work
between 48 and 96 hours per month and still
get full benefits.
 Work-to-retire program: Employees can
work reduced hours or seasonally as they
get closer to retiring. Employees who are 55
or older with 20 years of service can work
just 1,000 hours per year at their discretion
and get benefits for the entire year.

Financial benefits
Mercy offers both a 401(k) and a cash-balance retirement to its full- and 
part-time employees. Employees age 50 and older can make catch-up contri-
butions to their 401(k) account, which can be as high as $5,000 per year.
Catch-up contributions became permanent under the new 2006 pension law.
You can find out more details about that law in Chapter 8. The hospital also
offers referral services for elder care and child care for employees’ children
and grandchildren.
205
Chapter 14: Working 9 to 5 or Not! Exploring Your Hourly Options
Working with winners
Healthcare employers are not the only ones
recognized as best employers by AARP. Here is
a brief overview of some other innovative pro-
grams that won in different industries:
 Education: Brevard Public Schools in Veira,
Florida, won for its “Life Hub” program. The
school system offers a confidential, no cost
service to employees and their families so
they can address issues related to child care,
grandchild care, and elder care. The school
system also holds an annual Wellness
Conference that features health screenings,
biometric assessments, as well as presenta-
tions that increase awareness about good
health and disease prevention. Forty percent
of the school system’s employees are age 50
or older. Retired school principals serve as
recruiters to help hire new teachers at
school fairs. The school system also taps
retired educator organizations to recruit new
teachers.
 Financial: The Principal Financial Group,
based in Iowa, offers a “Wellness Time Off”
program that allows employees extra time
away from work to take care of health and
wellness needs. In addition, it has a “Happy
Returns” program that helps retirees return
to work with the assistance of Manpower
staffing service.
 Theme parks: Anheuser-Busch Adventure
Parks, which include SeaWorld and Busch
Gardens in Florida, offers an on-line and
telephone service called “Life Assistance
Services” to assist employees with select-
ing day care services and elder care ser-
vices. Employees can also get advice on
finding the right nursing home. Busch’s
long-term care policy is available not only
to employees, but also to the employees’
parents and grandparents. Another innova-
tive program is its “Legends Ambassadors,”
which is a team of people aged 55 and older
who are committed to helping SeaWorld
and Busch Gardens provide quality employ-
ment and job satisfaction to the 55-plus
population. The Ambassadors are selected
annually to help new hires learn the ropes
and offer suggestions, concerns, and ideas
to Human Resources. Ambassadors also
participate in job fairs, recruiting efforts,
and training. Busch also uses senior place-
ment agencies to target mature workers
and retirees for employment.
You’ll find more than 75 companies all around
the country that have developed innovative pro-
grams on AARP’s Web site. I’ve just given you a
brief overview of the variety you can find there.

Alternative work arrangements
Mercy offers a number of different types of work arrangements including flex
time where employees can set their own hours within certain guidelines;
telecommuting, which allows employees to work at home provided that is
possible for the type of work they do; a phased retirement program (I talk
more about how phased retirement programs work in Chapter 15); and job
sharing, where two employees share one job. Full-time employees can also
move to part-time work on a permanent or temporary basis.
Maintaining relations with retirees
Mercy currently has 100 retirees and it hired an individual whose direct
responsibilities include retiree relations. The hospital stays in touch with 
its employees on a regular basis and invites them to organization events and 
celebrations. It also provides retirees with ongoing access to retirement-
planning workshops.
Retirees can choose to come back to work on a temporary basis. They can
work as consultants or do contract work. Telecommuting from home, work-
ing full-time, or working part-time are all options for retirees that decide
they’d like to work again.
While many hospitals around the country are struggling with hard to fill
vacancies, Mercy has shown them how to maintain their needed workforce for
years to come. This is crucially important given the fact that the workforce is
aging and soon there won’t be enough workers to fill their shoes unless com-
panies find innovative ways to attract and retain their older workforce.
Finding Temporary Agencies that
Specialize in 50+ workers
One of the best ways to find jobs once you’re 50 or older is through tempo-
rary agencies that specialize in placing workers 50 and older. One thing you
will find consistently in the descriptions for most of the companies that won
AARP’s “Best Employers” award is that they recruit through senior placement
agencies or agencies that focus on mature workers (www.aarp.org/money/
careers/employerresourcecenter/bestemployers/).
There are a number of top agencies out there. You can probably find one 
near you by looking in the yellow pages of your local telephone book. Kelly
Services won one of the “Best Employers” awards from AARP in 2005.
Manpower Services was named by a number of “Best Employers” as their
source for mature workers.
206
Part III: Finding Your Next Job 

If you don’t find any specific mention of seeking “mature workers” or other
clues I mention above, call the temporary agency and ask whether they pro-
vide placement services for older workers. If they answer you enthusiastically
that they do, you probably do have a match. I find that when an employment
agency gives a pat answer about nondiscrimination, they probably won’t
make any special efforts to help the older worker find a job.
Working with the nation’s largest senior
placement and training service
The nation’s largest senior placement and training service is Experience
Works (www.experienceworks.org), which started out as Green Thumb 40
years ago. It was originally chartered in 1965 as a small, rural demonstration
program.
Today, Experience Works helps seniors get the training they need to find
good jobs in their own communities. It is one of the leading providers of
training, employment, and community service for low-income older people.
Checking out its services
Experience Works provides its services through older-worker training pro-
jects across the country. Projects include training in occupational skills,
classroom training, or on-the-job training:
 Occupational skills: This type of training helps older workers develop
skills for high-growth occupations such as home health aide, nurse
assistant, and computer operator. Experience Works identifies the high-
growth occupations within each specific project locality before setting
up the training.
 Classroom training: Classroom training is customized depending on the
needs of the participants. This type of training is focused on developing
the basic skills some participants need in order to become ready to
work at a job.
 On-the-job training: Sometimes employers will ask Experience Works to
develop and coordinate training for participants with specific jobs that
require special skills. The employer that requests this training can get
partial reimbursement for the extraordinary costs that may be associ-
ated with training a particular individual.
207
Chapter 14: Working 9 to 5 or Not! Exploring Your Hourly Options

Checking out its largest program — SCSEP
Experience Works’s largest program is the Senior Community Service
Employment Program (SCSEP), which is funded under Title V of the Older
Americans Act as well as state and local grants. Thousands of low-income
people age 55 and older have been helped under this program throughout
the United States.
Seniors can get training, counseling, and community service assignments at
faith-based and community organizations in their communities, which will help
them transition into a paid position in the workforce. Initially, participants are
placed at host agencies where they will be paid the minimum wage for an aver-
age of 20 hours per week. Host agencies can include either a private nonprofit
organization or a public agency operated by a unit of government.
SCSEP has had great success training older workers and finding them jobs.
After completing the program, 38 percent of Experience Works’s SCSEP par-
ticipants found permanent jobs, primarily as teachers’ aides, emergency dis-
patchers, care providers, and clerical assistants.
Participating in SCSEP
You can qualify for this program as long as you are 55 years of age or older
and a resident of a state where the SCSEP program operates. Your annual
family income must not be more than 125 percent of the established federal
poverty income guidelines. You also must be eligible to work in the United
States and be currently unemployed.
To find out if there is a program in your state, go to the Web site. Near the
top-left side of the Web site, you will see a box that says “For Seniors.”
Choose your state from a drop-down list and enter your county to find out 
if there is an Experience Works program near you.
For example, to test the system, I put in a Florida county and found that 
2,000 seniors are helped annually in Florida. There are nine regional offices 
in that state.
To make contact with Experience Works, you can either send an e-mail or call
the numbers given for your state. There is no cost for the training programs
and you can earn while you learn.
Using online resources
Resources can be as close as your computer, or your grandson’s or grand-
daughter’s computer. You’ll find lots of good information on the Web for locat-
ing companies that hire older workers. Here are some good places to start.
208
Part III: Finding Your Next Job 

National Council on Aging resources
The National Council on Aging (www.maturityworks.org) maintains a job
database for the senior network. To find available job postings, click on “Job”
near the top left of the Web site.
You can search job listings there. People searching for a job can post 
their resume for free on the Web site. Employers can post a job listing for 
free if they are a member of the council, but must pay $50 per listing if they
are not.
Senior Employment Resources (SER)
Senior Employment Resources (www.seniorjobs.org) focuses on helping
people age 50 or older who want to work in the Washington D.C. area, primar-
ily in Northern Virginia. SER is a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization
that receives a small portion of its funding from Fairfax County. SER is an
equal opportunity service.
Seniors4Hire
When the Forward Group started Seniors4Hire (www.seniors4hire.org),
they were actually planning to start a job site for teens called Teens4Hire.
They were inundated with requests by companies that wanted to hire
seniors, so Seniors4Hire was born.
Companies that encouraged the Forward Group to start the site include Bank
of America, RadioShack Corp., and Regal Entertainment Group, and they are
still actively involved in the site. You can join the site for free as long as you
are at least 50 years old.
In 2006, the site had over 200,000 job seekers age 50 or older and more than
550 employers that posted jobs. Industry groups that post on the site include
financial services, retail, telecommunications, and healthcare.
Senior Job Bank
One of the oldest senior job-placement sites on the Internet is Senior Job
Bank (www.seniorjobbank.org). You’ll find hundreds of jobs available
there each day. Listings are organized by state. Access to the site is free for
seniors, but employers must pay $89 per job posting. A wide variety of jobs
are available, from entry level to senior executive.
209
Chapter 14: Working 9 to 5 or Not! Exploring Your Hourly Options

Finding work if you’re 
a scientist or engineer
Eli Lilly Company and Proctor & Gamble started YourEncore.com (www.
yourencore.com) to reconnect with their retirees. In 2006, the site is flour-
ishing as a place that job seekers who were scientists, engineers, or product
developers can find work.
Most of the jobs posted on this Web site are short-term projects that are
designed to solve a specific problem. In addition to the two founders, you’ll
also find projects from Boeing, National Starch, 3M Co., and Ethicon Endo-
Surgery. Yourencore.com was started to bypass the pension rules that made
it difficult to rehire workers that were drawing a pension from the company.
The 2006 pension law lifts some of the barriers to hiring retirees who are col-
lecting a pension and are at least 62 years old, but the barriers do still exist if
you are younger than that, so this Web site will probably continue to operate
after the 2006 law is fully in force.
Searching for jobs if you’re 
a retired government expert
Yup, there is even a Web site dedicated to helping former U.S. government
workers find work after retirement in the private sector. It’s called the
Employment Network for Retired Government Experts (www.enrge.us).
This Web site focuses on building a job network for former U.S. government
workers who want to try working in the private sector.
You must be a retired federal, state, or local government employee, or a gov-
ernment employee within 12 months of a scheduled retirement, to use this
free service. Government contractors, entrepreneurs, venture capitalists,
human resource managers, investors, inventors, industrialists, small, large,
and emerging business owners, and other employers use this site’s database
of candidates. Jobs offered through this site tend to be contract-based, but
some are full- or part-time. Employers pay $1,000 to access the database for
an 18-month period.
Telecommuting — Not Telemarketing!
Telecommuting is becoming more and more popular. More than 24 million
workers telecommute at least one day a week. About 25 percent of these
workers work at home every day.
210
Part III: Finding Your Next Job 

Understanding telecommuting
A telecommuting job is in no way a telemarketing job (where you call people
on the phone in the middle of their supper or favorite television show to sell
them something they don’t want and don’t need). Telecommuting simply
means you work somewhere other than the regular workplace for the com-
pany. Most often that place is your home, but it can be a satellite office or
telework center.
A telework center is a place where computers, Internet access, and other
office equipment are available. Some companies that allow telecommuting set
up these workspaces for workers who live far from the regular office. These
employees can work at the telework center rather than travel all the way into
the office for at least part of their work week.
If you do want to telecommute from home, you will need to have an office 
set up in your home and be able to stay in close contact with your employer
throughout the day. Sometimes employers will even provide the equipment
workers need to telecommute from home.
The biggest advantage of telecommuting is that you can set your own hours.
If you have something to do at home or must errands outside the home, you
can take care of those things and then make up the time later in the day.
Finding a telecommuting job
How do you find telecommuting jobs? Some of the Web sites mentioned 
earlier in this chapter do list contract work, which often can be done by
telecommuting. You will also find telecommuting jobs on Internet job sites. 
If you know that you can do the job from home, even if telecommuting is not
listed, it never hurts to ask during a job interview whether telecommuting is
a possibility.
One of the largest Web sites for contract work, freelance projects, and part-
time jobs that does include telecommuting is Sologig (www.sologig.com),
which boasts that it lists 10,000 jobs daily. A wide variety of jobs are listed on
the site including Web and graphic design, marketing, writing, editing, trans-
lation, programming and database development, networking, engineering,
architecture, business and administrative support, and sales.
Sologig is affiliated with Career Builder.com. In fact, if you indicate that you
want to work freelance or on a contract basis when applying for a job on
Career Builder, you will be sent to Sologig. Job seekers do not have to pay a
fee for the service, but if you want priority placement when an employer
searches for a freelancer, there is a premium membership that costs $39.99
per month.
211
Chapter 14: Working 9 to 5 or Not! Exploring Your Hourly Options

To get started with Sologig, you develop a personal profile that focuses on
the types of projects or jobs you’re interested in finding. Then you can search
the database for projects, which Sologig says numbers 100,000. If you find a
project that interests you, you can apply for the project online. Employers
will then view your profile and contact you if they are interested.
Each employer sets its own rules regarding hiring processes, project parame-
ters, and compensation. Sologig.com does not charge any fees per project
that you accept.
Most Popular Part-Time Jobs 
for Older Workers
You may be wondering what types of jobs are the most popular among older
workers who do want to work part-time. Well, you’ll find there are lots of 
different job types available to people 50 and older.
The following sections list the most popular part-time jobs older workers 
are choosing:
Bank teller
Banks prefer to higher older workers because they are reliable, responsible,
and have excellent customer-service skills that they have developed over
many years of working. Teller positions give you a lot of opportunity to inter-
act with people throughout the day.
Many banks also offer tellers part-time hours and flexible schedules to attract
and keep good workers. Often part-time positions are available at busy times
of the day, such as lunch time. Check with the banks in your area to find out if
they have any jobs available. Even if there isn’t a job in the branch nearest
you, your branch will likely know how to apply for a position with another
branch nearby that does have openings.
Customer greeters
You probably saw customer greeters for the first time at your local Wal-Mart.
They are the people that stand near the entrance to the store and greet cus-
tomers as they come in.
212
Part III: Finding Your Next Job 

Wal-Mart started a trend that has become very popular in many other retail
businesses. Car dealerships and banks are two of the retailers that often
employ customer greeters today.
Take notice as you walk into various retail stores in your area. If you do see 
a customer greeter near the entrance, that’s a good place to check to see if
there are any openings. Even if there are no openings in the specific store 
you are visiting, the employment office can give you information about other
locations that might have openings.
One of the nice benefits of working at a retail store is that you get employee
discounts that will make it much cheaper to buy gifts for your grandkids.
English instructor
If you like to travel, working as an English instructor might be the perfect
opportunity for you. To learn more about teaching English abroad, visit the
Web site Transitions Abroad (http://www.transitionsabroad.com/
listings/work/esl/index.shtml). There you will find information about
certification training and employers that hire people to teach English abroad.
You will need some training to learn how to teach English as a second lan-
guage. Once you’re certified, you will be able to find work and get a work
permit abroad in countries throughout Asia and Eastern Europe. Many other
English teaching jobs exist around the globe.
Countries that have jobs for English teachers and that are listed on
Transitions Abroad include Canada, Chile, China, Costa Rica, Czech Republic,
France, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Russia, Spain, Taiwan, Thailand, and
United Kingdom. There are also opportunities in the United States if you
don’t want to travel abroad.
College or university faculty member
If you enjoy teaching and have at least a Master’s degree, you may be able to
find a faculty or instructor position at a local community college or through
one of the nationwide private universities, such as the University of Phoenix.
Contact your local community college to find out what types of teaching
opportunities are available.
213
Chapter 14: Working 9 to 5 or Not! Exploring Your Hourly Options

The University of Phoenix hires instructors at satellite facilities all over the
country who teach inside the classroom, through a program called FlexNet
(that is partially online and partially in the classroom) and through classes
entirely online. The university seeks faculty members with extensive work
experience to teach, so it makes a perfect fit for retired workers.
I do have some direct experience teaching there. I am a faculty member for
the Graduate Business and Management program at the university’s Tampa
campus. Each faculty member is contracted on a course-by-course basis for
four- to six-week courses. So it’s easy to set your own schedule, teach, and
then travel in-between contracts.
Floral assistant
If you enjoy being around plants and want flexible schedules, a floral assis-
tant might be your best choice for a part-time job. You’ll even get some
health benefits from this choice because flowers have been shown to
decrease depression and enhance memory for older people.
You will need to work many holidays if you choose this type of position.
Floral shops, of course, are their busiest during the holiday seasons.
Home care aides
If you’ve already cared for an elderly parent or spouse in your home, you
know what a home care assistant needs to do. As the U.S. population ages,
the need for home care assistants grows rapidly.
You can find out more details about the scope of duties for Home Care Aides
at the Department of Labor Web site (http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos173.
htm). In some states, all you will need is on-the-job training, which you can
get through your future employer.
Other states do require formal training, which you can get through local com-
munity colleges, vocation schools, elder care programs, or home healthcare
agencies.
You can get a national certification as a home care aide through The National
Association for Home Care and Hospice (NAHC) (www.nahc.org), but certifi-
cation is voluntary. If you do decide to get certified, it requires completion of
a 75-hour course and written exam developed by NAHC. After the test, home
care aides seeking certification are evaluated on 17 different skills by a regis-
tered nurse.

Mystery shopping
Do you like to shop? If you do, you can get paid for it by working as a mystery
shopper.
Remember all those times you’ve gotten bad service and wanted to tell some-
one about it, but there was no one around to tell or you didn’t want to take the
time to do it? Well, mystery shopping lets you get out some of that frustration.
Many retailers, including fast-food restaurants, grocery stores, banks, car
dealers, and new home builders, use mystery shoppers. Almost any area 
that you enjoy shopping in probably hires mystery shoppers.
Be careful though, many Web sites on the Internet or job listings on job
boards offer you mystery shopping opportunities provided you pay a fee to
join. Don’t do it! You don’t have to pay to be a mystery shopper, and the good
companies don’t charge.
The best place to find out more about mystery shopping is the Mystery
Shopping Providers Association (www.mysteryshop.org/shoppers). They
do offer two levels of certification — Silver and Gold. It does help to have at
least a Silver certification to get picked up by the better mystery shopping
firms. You can get that certification online for $15 at www.mysteryshop.
org/shoppers/certification. You will read through a quick course on
the basics of how to mystery shop and take a short exam online. After you’re
certified, you can use the association’s resources to search for shopping
opportunities.
Three good mystery shopping firms to work with include Service Intelligence
(www.serviceintelligence.com), Maritz (www.maritz.com), and
Jancyn (www.jancyn.com). Most of your better mystery shopping firms do
value your getting the Silver certificate. You have a better chance of getting
picked up if you can give your certificate number when applying to be a mys-
tery shopper.
Teacher’s assistant
Do you like working with children? Many school systems around the country
are looking for teacher’s assistants as classroom sizes continue to grow.
Some school systems even provide on-the-job training for teacher’s assis-
tants. If you think this might be a good match for you, you can find out more
about the job requirements at the U.S. Department of Labor’s Web site
(www.bls.gov/oco/ocos153.htm). You can also find out about training
programs that are offered in your state at your state department of education
Web site or by contacting your county’s school system.
215
Chapter 14: Working 9 to 5 or Not! Exploring Your Hourly Options

About 40 percent of teacher’s assistants work part-time, and you can likely
find a part-time job that fits your schedule, especially since many school 
systems have a great shortage of workers.
Each state sets its own rules about educational requirements, which can vary
greatly. In some states, you may find that all you need is a high school
diploma, while others require some college training.
If you do have experience working with special education students or can
speak a foreign language, you will find that you are in even greater demand.
Tour guide
If you enjoy giving tours, you may find lots of opportunities near your home
at museums, parks, resorts, casinos, and other hospitality-based businesses.
Many of these types of facilities use older workers to explain the attractions
and inform customers about the various services and amenities offered.
Large new home developments also hire tour guides who give a basic tour of
the community and free up salespeople to work with serious buyers.
If this type of job interests you, stop by museums, parks, resorts, or new
home developments near you to find out if they do hire tour guides and how
you can apply for the spots.

Revisiting Your
Former Career 
or Starting Your 
Own Business

In this part . . .
You may decide you don’t really want to change jobs
or that you’d like to work as a consultant for your
former company or within your former industry. Or maybe
you’d like to follow your dreams and run your own busi-
ness. In this part, I talk about creative ways to stay on your
current job part time or convince your boss to let you work
as a consultant. I also explore how you can start your own
consulting business providing services to other companies
in the industry you know best. Finally, I help you explore
various alternatives you may want to consider if you’d like
to run your own business.

Chapter 15
Staying on the Job Part-Time
In This Chapter
 Going part-time
 Sharing your job
 Working from home
 Contracting independently
 Temping awhile
 Retiring in phases
You may be ready to slow down, but not ready to stop work completely
as you near full retirement age. Many companies do offer alternative
working arrangements for their older workers, including part-time work
schedules, job sharing, telecommuting, and independent contracting. More
and more companies are realizing the value of retaining their older workers
as they find it harder and harder to hire well-qualified candidates to replace
all the baby boomers ready to retire.
In this chapter, I look at the alternatives to a full-time position, explain how
they work, and give you some suggestions on how to make them happen.
Unfortunately, some of you will be working for a company that has not seen the
value of retaining their older workers and the powers that be won’t be willing
to consider these alternatives. If that’s the case, you’ll find some great ideas for
how to continue working part-time for a different company in Chapter 14.
Switching to Part-Time
The traditional way to slow down on a job is to reduce your time at work by
switching to a part-time position, which would be any work assignment
below what your company considers full-time — usually 35 to 40 hours a
week. Part-time positions can be structured as five half days, three days a

week, four days a week, or any other combination of days depending on what
you and your boss can work out. But to switch to part-time, you need to
restructure your day and get approval for the switch. I discuss both of these
ideas in the sections below.
Developing a restructuring plan
You need to do your homework before talking to your boss about working
part-time. Follow these steps:
1. Develop a detailed list of everything you do. This should be a much
more extensive list of your daily functions than your job description.
You should include even the most mundane tasks in this list, such as
filing — yeah, unfortunately everyone has to do some of that — copying,
or other support functions that may not be in your official job descrip-
tion but are part of your daily routine.
2. Figure out what you must do. Obviously, if you do get permission to go
part-time, you can’t do everything that you were doing full-time, unless
you have a job that really doesn’t require a full-time employee. So you
need to look at your list of daily functions and determine what you must
do, what could be passed on to a co-worker or another department, and
what could be eliminated.
3. Create a new job description. Be sure that you can handle this descrip-
tion given the work week you prefer. Keep the tasks that are critical to
your current skills and talents. Also be sure to list tasks that have been
assigned to you because they are a priority of your boss or your com-
pany and you’ve been designated as the best person to do them — even
if you hate doing those tasks. You want to show your boss that you will
continue being a team player even as a part-timer.
4. Evaluate the leftover tasks. Determine if the tasks left can be eliminated
because they really are “busy work” or no longer needed. Be ready to
make the case for their elimination and be sure you don’t put a task on
that list that you know is important to your boss even if you don’t think
it’s important. Trying to make the case against something your boss
wants when you are trying to get something for yourself will just give
your boss ammunition to reject your entire request to go part-time.
You’re sure to have some tasks left on your list that still need to be done,
but you believe others in your department or possibly another depart-
ment can take over those tasks. You may or may not want to recommend
who should take over those tasks.
220
Part IV: Revisiting Your Former Career or Starting Your Own Business 

5. Make the call about how far your recommendations should go based
on your relationship with your boss. You may think it’s better to just
list tasks you don’t think are critical for you to do or you may find it
better to develop a plan for who should do them.
If you’re a manager or a supervisor, you’ll be in a stronger position to
recommend restructuring. If you’re not in a supervisory role, it’s proba-
bly best to leave the restructuring to your boss, but be ready to make
some suggestions if he asks for them.
Proposing the change
Obviously, your best shot at getting what you want is to ask for the change
when your boss is praising you for your work. So develop your proposal 
and sit on it until the timing is right. If you’re scheduled for a review and
you’re expecting it to be a good one, that may be the best time to bring 
up the discussion. Another good time is shortly after you’ve completed 
a project for which you were praised. (I talk more about how to write the 
proposal and prepare for the approach to your boss in the section below,
“Convincing Your Boss.”)
You do take some risks proposing a part-time arrangement. If your boss says
no, he may then question whether you are still willing to put in a full-time
effort or may be thinking about leaving the job. Your relationship with your
boss, as well as your outstanding job reviews, could be hurt. So tread care-
fully and be sure you are ready for a possible negative impact on your stand-
ing within the company if your proposal is rejected.
Sharing Your Job
Job sharing became popular when women reentered the job force 
after having a child. Many women did want to go back to work, but not full-
time. They wanted more time to spend raising their family. So they talked
with other co-workers in the same boat, found a partner who also wanted 
to job share, and then proposed it to their boss. If you want to job share, 
you need to follow the same route — I take you through it in the sections 
that follow.
221
Chapter 15: Staying on the Job Part-Time

Finding the right fit
In order to job share, you’ll need to find someone else in the company that
has similar or complementary job skills and also wants to work part-time.
The two of you can then propose to share one job instead of two. That way
the company only has to hire one person and keeps two people already
trained in the job, who can then help train the new person.
Today, job sharing is a popular alternative for workers nearing retirement.
For example, suppose you are in a department that has a total of six workers
and four of them are near retirement age. If the four workers near retirement
age would like to cut back on their hours and reduce their stress as they near
retirement, job sharing might be the best alternative.
The company could make two of the four positions job-sharing positions and
only need to hire two new employees. The four job-sharers could then serve
as mentors to the new hires and make the transition much smoother for both
the company and the employees.
The key to getting a job-share arrangement to work is finding someone who is
not only willing to share a job with you, but is willing to share that job during
the hours you don’t want to work. For example, suppose you want to work in
the mornings from 9 to 1. You would need to find a job-share partner who is
willing to work from 1 to 5.
Companies that do permit job sharing usually structure the job-share part-
nerships in the following three different ways:
 Skill sets: When a job-sharing arrangement is based on skill sets, each
member of the job share brings skills and experiences that complement
the other member of the arrangement. Working together, they meet the
full expectations of the job. For example, one person may be a very good
number cruncher while the other person on the job-share team is good
with managing people or projects. Pairing them can create an even more
effective working environment for the company.
 Mentor/subordinate: When a job-sharing arrangement involves a team
with a supervisor or manager and subordinate, each one handles the
tasks that best meet their skills and experience. The supervisor won’t 
be bogged down with tasks that can be handled by someone at a lower
level with less experience, which frees him up to focus his time on man-
aging people and organizing the department or function. This type of job
share can be the most cost effective type of job share and it also serves
as the ideal mentoring relationship in which the subordinate can be
trained to take over when the supervisor is promoted or moves on.
222
Part IV: Revisiting Your Former Career or Starting Your Own Business 

 Geographic shares: Many companies need regional coverage, but don’t
need full-time people at each location. A job-sharing arrangement can
involve two people in two different parts of the country. This kind of
arrangement can help the company meet its geographic coverage needs.
Many times this type of job-share team doesn’t work in the same office.
Creating a winning job-sharing team
The key to any successful job-share team is communication. It’s critical that
both members of a job-share team openly communicate about the tasks they
are working on, so when one of them is out of the office, the other person 
can cover questions about ongoing projects or duties. Responsibilities must
be clearly defined upfront. Everyone involved, including the job sharers, 
the boss, and other co-workers, must understand who is responsible for
which tasks.
One big advantage of job-sharing arrangements is that job sharers can cover
for each other when one goes on vacation or is sick. To help sell the plan to
your boss, be sure to let him know that each of you will work extra hours if
needed when one partner in the job share must be out of the office during his
normal work hours.
Once you’ve found your job-share partner, both of you need to write detailed
descriptions of your daily tasks. Then you should work together to develop a
plan for how you can share your job and also what tasks you may need to
pass on to others. Since you will be sharing one job, there will be a second
position open that the company can either decide to fill or not, depending on
what is needed.
You will find that some of your tasks will need to be a shared responsibility.
This includes things that could be needed throughout the day no matter who
is in the office. Other tasks may fall to one partner or the other depending on
skills or experience.
Once both partners agree on a plan, then it’s time to write up the proposal
and approach your boss. I talk more about how to write the proposal and 
prepare for the approach to your boss in the section below, “Convincing Your
Boss.” Carefully pick a time when you know he is most receptive to hearing
new ideas. If you’ve just worked on a successful project together, that can be
the best timing to suggest a job-share arrangement.
223
Chapter 15: Staying on the Job Part-Time

Telecommuting from Home
Telecommuting means that you will work from your home rather than go into
the office every day. You should plan to go to the office at least one day per
week to maintain good relationships with your co-workers and attend crucial
meetings. You may need to go into the office on days you’re scheduled to be
home if a crisis arises at your company and you’re needed for meetings or
other activities.
If you do want to think about this option, you must have a place in your home
that you can dedicate as office space and be prepared to spend the money you
need to buy all the office equipment. You can’t plan to do this on your kitchen
table. You will need a room where you can close the door and concentrate
without being disturbed. Some companies that permit telecommuting do pro-
vide office equipment, but if you’re making the case for telecommuting the first
time in your company, don’t expect any help financing the move.
To telecommute, you must be the type of person who is self-motivated,
highly focused, and dedicated. If you meet these criteria, you’ll probably find
that you can get more done in your home than in the office where there can
be constant interruptions. But, you also must be someone who does not need
the camaraderie that comes by being in the workplace. Working at home,
alone, can be difficult if you are a people person.
If you think telecommuting is the way you want to go, then sit down and write
a detailed description of all your work duties. Determine which duties can be
done just as efficiently, or possibly even more efficiently, from your home.
Figure out the duties that must be done in the office.
Group the duties that must be done in the office together and determine
whether or not they can be done on the one or two days you plan to go 
to the office. If not, determine whether they are duties you can pass on to 
someone else.
Develop a proposal for your boss that lays out what duties you believe 
you can do from home, what duties you will do the one or two days you go 
to the office, and what duties you propose giving up as you shorten your
work week and become a part-timer. I talk more about how to write the 
proposal and prepare for the approach to your boss in the section below,
“Convincing Your Boss.”
224
Part IV: Revisiting Your Former Career or Starting Your Own Business 

Convincing Your Boss
If any part-time alternatives are already permitted in your company, getting
approval for the arrangement should be relatively simple because the rules
for doing so already exist. But, if your company has never allowed any of
these types of arrangements, then you’ll have to sell your boss and your 
company on the idea of alternative work arrangements before you can even
propose one for yourself. The following sections not only tell you how to
develop your proposal, but also where you can find some great help.
Taking steps in the right direction
Here are the steps you should take to make the case for an alternative work
arrangement:
1. Research your company’s policies and current work arrangements.
Start this task by reading your employee manual to see whether there 
are any current human resource provisions for working part-time, job
sharing, telecommuting, or other alternative work arrangements, such as
flex time. Also research the company’s position on benefits for employ-
ees who work part-time. This will give you the ammunition for your pro-
posal. If there is no mention of alternative work arrangements, you do
have your work cut out for you to make the case for them. Your proposal
will need to be more extensive, talking about how the arrangements have
proven good for both employees and employers. There’s lots of research
out there. I’ll point you to some good resources later in this section.
2. Make an appointment to discuss your plans with a co-worker who 
utilizes alternative work arrangements. If you know of anyone in your
company who has an alternative work arrangement, make an appoint-
ment to talk with them, find out details about their arrangement, and
find out how they got the company to agree to their arrangement.
3. Find out who will have to approve your request for an alternative
work arrangement and figure out when the best time is to approach
that person with your request. For example, would they be more recep-
tive to hearing new ideas in the morning or afternoon? Is early in the
week better for them or are they more relaxed toward the middle or end
of the week? Do they prefer to discuss new ideas face-to-face or to read
about them in a written proposal sent by e-mail or letter. Figure out the
best way to initiate this discussion.
4. Once you’ve got all your ducks in a row, write your proposal and plan
your strategy for presenting it.
225
Chapter 15: Staying on the Job Part-Time

Finding help online
Developing your proposal on your own may all sound very scary to you. If
you’re not comfortable trying to do this all on your own from scratch, there
is an excellent Web site you can use for proposal development called Work
Options (www.workoptions.com). Pat Katepoo, who developed this site,
has been convincing companies of the benefits of alternative work arrange-
ments since 1993.
She’s even pulled together resources specifically for people aged 50 and
older who want to consider an alternative to their current working arrange-
ment at http://www.workoptions.com/fiftyplus.htm. To make things
even easier for you, Pat Katepoo has developed excellent templates that you
can download and personalize for your company and job situation at http://
www.workoptions.com/wherestart.htm. She not only gives you a tem-
plate in which you fill in the blanks for your situation, she also takes you
carefully through the steps — researching, writing an effective proposal, and
developing you strategy for presenting the proposal. She does charge $29.92
for each template.
A good place to find research publications about changes in the workplace
is the Families and Work Institute (famliesandwork.org). You’ll find a
number of studies on older workers and changes in the workforce that you
can use to build your case. Boston University’s Center for Work and Family
Balance (www.workandfamily.org) is another good source for research 
on changes in the workforce that you can use for developing your proposal.
In Chapter 14, I discuss AARP’s “Best Employers for Workers Over 50
Program.” Read through the descriptions to get some ideas of what other
companies are doing in regards to alternative work arrangements. You can
get more information about all the employers that have won recognition from
AARP at www.aarp.org/money/careers/employerresourcecenter/
bestemployers/.
A good Web site developed from the employer’s perspective that has some
excellent articles you can use to build your case is Employee Retention
(www.hermangroup.com/retentionconnection) developed by the
Herman Group, a management-consulting firm.
Proposing an Independent Contractor
Arrangement
You may also want to consider leaving your company completely and work-
ing as an independent contractor. Do be careful though if you decide to take
226
Part IV: Revisiting Your Former Career or Starting Your Own Business 

this route. Often these positions are not designed as true contractor arrange-
ments and are instead just a way for the company to avoid paying benefits.
As an independent contractor, you should truly be able to set your own
schedule, and decide where you want to work and how you want to work, 
as long as you are able to meet the specifications in the contract you write
between you and the employer.
You should be hired on a project-by-project basis. Your duties and responsi-
bilities should be carefully spelled out, as well as who will be responsible for
materials, supplies, and other items that may be needed to complete the pro-
ject. If you plan to hire assistants to help you with the project or subcontract
out some of the work, be sure your costs for these items are specified in the
contract as well.
When you’re an employee, both you and your employer pay half of your
taxes for Social Security and Medicare, which means each of you pay 6.2 
percent of your income for Social Security taxes (up to an income level of
$94,200 in 2006) and 1.45 percent for Medicare taxes. As a contractor, you’ll
have to pay both employer and employee taxes, which means you’ll have to
pay 15.3 percent of your income toward Social Security and Medicare taxes to
cover both the employer and employee taxes.
The IRS uses the following 20-question test to determine whether a person is
truly working as an independent contractor:
 Is the individual’s work vital to the company’s core business? If you
are still an employee, the answer to this question is yes. You can only 
be considered a contractor if the services you plan to provide are
nonessential business activities.
 Did you train the individual to perform tasks in a specific way? If 
your company provides training, then you are considered an employee.
Contractors should be skilled professionals who require no training to
perform their services.
 Do you (or can you) instruct the individual as to when, where, and how
the work is performed? Employers can control where, when, and how
work should be performed for the company, but they can’t do that for an
independent contractor. If you become a contractor, you must be able to
determine where you perform the work based on industry specifications.
 Do you (or can you) control the sequence or order of the work per-
formed? For employees, the answer to this question is yes as well. On
the other hand, as a contractor you will be held accountable only for
outcomes, not the way in which you complete the work.
 Do you (or can you) set the hours of work for the individual? Employers
can set schedules for employees. As a contractor, you must be able to set
your own work hours as long as you meet agreed-upon deadlines.
227
Chapter 15: Staying on the Job Part-Time

 Do you (or can you) require the individual to perform the work per-
sonally? Employees are required to do the work personally. As a con-
tractor, you can delegate work to your own staff or subcontract the 
work to others.
 Do you (or can you) prohibit the individual from hiring, supervising,
and paying assistants? The company decides whether assistants can be
hired for employees and pays those assistants. As a contractor, you get
to make the choice to hire assistants for yourself. The contractor also
pays the costs of assistants who perform all or part of the project.
 Does the individual perform regular and continuous services for you?
Employees work regularly even if they do not have full-time jobs.
Contractors work on a project-by-project basis with new contracts
drawn up for each new project.
 Does the individual provide services on a substantially full-time basis
to your company? Employers can control whether full-time employees
work for others. As a contractor, you have the right to work for more
than one company provided you perform the requirements of your 
contract on time.
 Is your company the sole or major source of income for the individual?
For employees, the answer to this question is yes. Contractors usually
work for multiple clients at the same time.
 Is the work performed on your premises? Employees usually work on-
site unless telecommuting has been approved. As a contractor, you have
the choice to work on-site (if space is available) or at an office of your
choosing.
 Do you (or can you) require the individual to submit regular reports,
either written or oral? You can ask employees to provide status or
activity reports on a regular basis. Contractors are responsible to
deliver their product on time. You cannot be required to provide interim
reports unless those reports are part of the initial contract agreement.
 Do you pay the individual by the hour, week, or month? Employees
are paid at fixed intervals. Compensation for contractors is determined
by project or is based on a fixed fee.
 Do you pay the individual’s travel and business expenses? Employees
who incur work-related expenses are usually reimbursed for those
expenses. Contractors normally include out-of-pocket expenses as part
of their project fee rather than being reimbursed for them as they occur.
 Do you furnish tools or equipment for the individual? Employees gen-
erally use company-provided supplies. Contractors usually provide their
own equipment and supplies, unless otherwise specified in the contract.
 Does the individual have a significant investment in facilities, tools, or
equipment? Employees typically use the company’s facilities, tools, and
equipment. Contractors usually pay their own expenses related to work-
space, equipment, and other needs.
228
Part IV: Revisiting Your Former Career or Starting Your Own Business 

 Can the individual realize a profit or loss from his or her services 
to your company? For employees, the answer to this question is no,
because employees can usually expect steady paychecks. Contractors,
on the other hand, run the risk of nonpayment if a project is not com-
pleted according to contract specifications.
 Does the individual make his or her services available to the general
public? Employees do not sell their services to the public. Contractors
publicize their services to a wide range of potential clients using direct
mail, advertising, and other means.
 Can the individual terminate the relationship without liability?
Employees can quit at any time. Contractors are legally obligated to
complete projects according to contract provisions, or they may face
penalties for noncompletion as set forth in the contract.
 Do you have the right to discharge the individual at any time?
Employees can usually be let go “at will” by their employer. Contractors
can be discharged only if they fail to perform contracted services.
Use this 20-question test to develop the provisions of any independent con-
tract you agree to sign. If a company regularly uses independent contract
agreements for former employees who have retired, you may find that the
company will supply you with a contract. Don’t sign the contract without
testing its provisions against these 20 questions. In fact, it’s always a good
idea to pay an attorney familiar with labor law to review any independent
contract before you sign it.
Be sure you clearly define the scope of any project for which you will work as
an independent contractor. Make sure you clearly spell out in writing what
you will be responsible to do, when you will be responsible to complete the
work, and who will pay for all the materials and supplies needed to get the
work done.
Going Back to Work as 
a Temporary Worker
You may decide that you want to work again after you’ve already left your
position. You don’t want to take on the responsibilities of a full- or part-time
employee year round. Instead you’d just like to take periodic temporary
assignments to make some extra money.
You will be able to do that without any problem provided your company does
have a system for hiring temporary workers. You may find that your company
actually uses a temporary agency for all its temporary workers and you will
have to sign up with that agency to get any work.
229
Chapter 15: Staying on the Job Part-Time

You could have a problem though if you are collecting a pension from the
company. Federal tax and labor laws does prohibit a company from rehiring
its retirees who are receiving a pension. The provisions of these laws were
eased for retirees with passage of the Pension Protection Act of 2006. The
actual rules related to this new law were not yet written at the time I was
writing this book. I talk about the provisions of the new law in greater detail
in Chapter 8.
Your company may or may not ease its restrictions on rehiring employees
who are collecting a pension. If you do collect a pension, be sure to check
with your human resources department regarding the rules about working
and collecting a pension before talking with your ex-boss about a temporary
position.
Using a Phased Retirement Arrangement
You might like to cut your hours gradually and work toward retirement rather
than go cold turkey from work to retirement. It can be very stressful to be at
work one day and be at home with no structure for your day the next day.
You may want to consider one of the alternative work arrangements I discuss
in this chapter, but can’t afford to take the cut in pay unless you can get a
least part of your pension benefits. Thanks to the 2006 pension law, the door-
way was opened to companies who want to start formal phased retirement
arrangements.
Prior to the new law, companies risked tax penalties, as well as the qualified
status of their pension plans, if they continued people on their payroll who
were receiving pension benefits. Under the new law, once an employee
reaches age 62, the company can pay partial pension benefits to that
employee while he’s still working.
The official rules for phased retirement programs were still being developed by
the Internal Revenue Service, regarding rule changes needed for issues related
to tax codes, and by the Department of Labor, regarding rule changes related 
to provisions of ERISA and ADEA. ERISA stands for the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, which governs the operation of most employee
benefit plans including traditional pensions as well as employee retirement sav-
ings plans, such as 401(k)s. ADEA stands for Age Discrimination in Employment
Act, which prohibits discrimination in employment. The law governs early
retirement benefits and voluntary early retirement incentive plans.
230
Part IV: Revisiting Your Former Career or Starting Your Own Business 

Changes will be needed in both ERISA and ADEA rules to make it possible for
companies to rehire employees who are collecting pensions from their employ-
ers. If you aren’t collecting a pension, you won’t face the same problem.
People who do want to continue working under an alternative work arrange-
ment such as part-time, job sharing, or telecommuting, but need to supple-
ment their income to make up for the reduction in income, do have the
option of officially retiring, rolling out their employer-retirement savings 
program into an individual retirement account (IRA), and then taking needed
withdrawals to cover any shortfall in income.
This can be a good way to fund a phased retirement if you don’t have a pen-
sion plan at work. But, be careful. You don’t want to retire too early and take
out so much money in early retirement that you run out of money during
retirement.
A key provision that you will want to look for in any phased retirement pro-
gram is a continuation of benefits, especially health benefits, at least until
you qualify for Medicare. Once you get past the age of 50, you’ll likely have
some ongoing health problems that could make it impossible for you to get
health insurance on your own before you qualify for Medicare.
Many companies that do want to retain their older workers are making it 
possible for their part-time workers to get access to group health insurance
benefits through the company. You probably will have to pay more of the 
premium if you decide to work part-time or under one of the other alternative
work arrangements discussed in this chapter. Another benefit many older
workers seek is long-term care insurance.
Remember, you likely will be living 15, 20, or more years in retirement, so you
do have to be careful not to withdraw the funds too quickly. I talk more about
managing distributions from your retirement savings in Chapter 6.

ometimes your knowledge and experience are so important to a com-
pany that they just aren’t ready for you to leave. Consulting after retiring
from a full-time position can be very lucrative for the former employee.
This chapter will discuss how you set up consulting arrangements, as well as
how to figure out what you should charge.
Understanding Consulting
Anyone with a specialized set of skills or knowledge can be a consultant. The
key for you is whether or not you can sell the company on paying for your
knowledge and skills.
When you start talking about retirement, if your boss starts talking about how
he can’t possibly imagine operating the department or company without you,
you probably have a good chance of arranging for a consulting agreement
provided that’s what you want to do. But there could be a big barrier in the
way of your consulting for your company. If you’ll be eligible for traditional
monthly pension benefits in retirement, your company may not be able to
hire you.

Thanks to the Pension Protection Act of 2006, that barrier has been partially
knocked down, and as long as you are at least 62 years old your company
may already have changed the rules for their retirees. In Chapter 8, I explain
the reasons for the barrier, if you want more details.
If you are younger than 62 and collecting a pension, you probably won’t be
able to work directly for your company. Some companies do hire consultants
who are former employees through third-party consulting firms. If you know
that the company does have a number of consultants on contract, talk with
them to find out how they made their arrangements.
Checking out the advantages
Consultants pretty much can do anything a company needs but does not
want to hire an employee to do or believes that a specialist can do more
effectively and/or efficiently. As a retiree, your biggest benefit is that you set
your work hours and you pick the projects you want to work on.
As a consultant, if the project doesn’t interest you, you can always say no and
move on to something else. If you want to travel at the time the project must
be done, you can either negotiate a different schedule or pass on the project.
Try doing that when you’re a full-time employee. You won’t get that type of
flexibility.
For example, suppose you’ve been working on product development in the
marketing department for 20 to 30 years. You know all the product lines
extremely well, as well as the company’s competitors. You could probably
develop an analysis for the potential of a new product, as well as its market-
ing plan, fairly rapidly because you won’t need to do as much research as a
newer employee without the knowledge of the company and its competitors.
Your company may decide to hire you as a marketing consultant to periodi-
cally work on new product development or other marketing dilemmas.
Reviewing the required skills
Consultants come in all stripes and sizes. If you search the Internet using the
word consulting, you will probably find consultants in the fields of advertis-
ing, computers, construction, entertainment, financial services, law, politics,
resume building, theater, telecommunications, and dozens of other areas.
The only limit to the types of consulting you can do is your experience and
knowledge. Before someone will pay the big bucks for a consultant, you have
to prove to them its worth paying you for your knowledge and skills.
234
Part IV: Revisiting Your Former Career or Starting Your Own Business 

What skills do you need? Skills you must have fall into three categories —
technical skills, project-management skills, and personal skills.
 Technical skills: These include any skills in which you have a specialty
because of your functional expertise (accounting, writing, or whatever
area you’ve been working in for the past 20 to 30 years).
 Project-management skills: These could include creating the product,
negotiating, interviewing, presenting recommendations, problem-
identification, problem-solving, time management, client service skills,
proposal development, and team-building and management skills.
 Personal skills: These include communications, listening, management,
collaboration, interpersonal, marketing, promotion, and leadership.
If you think you may be weak in any of these skill sets, you should probably
find a partner for your consulting work. All these skills are needed by a con-
sultant at one time or another.
Seeing how consultants work
Basically, consultants are hired to solve a problem. You do so by working
through these five major steps:
1. Investigate the problem. You figure out what’s gone wrong or what
needs to be done. As part of the investigation step, you’ll talk with
people in the organization, research information, and collect data so
you’ll be able to analyze the problem. As an insider, you know where the
“bodies are buried,” so to speak. From your experience, you probably
have a good idea where the weaknesses are and who you need to talk
with about the problem. You probably know who’s protecting what fief-
dom and how someone might be creating resistance to the solution. You
will need to talk with the key people putting up the barriers to the solu-
tion to get their side of the story. Don’t assume your solution is right
until you’ve done a full investigation. Remember, you want to look at this
from a fresh perspective and not just the perspective you might have
had while working full-time in one department of the company.
2. Analyze your data. Next you need to analyze the problem to figure out
the causes and symptoms. For example, as you start your research
regarding the launch of the new product, you may find the sales man-
ager has some serious concerns about how it will fit in the product line.
He also might believe that the new product could cut into sales of other
products. When you talk with the manufacturing manager, you might find
that the new product cannot easily be built along side other products in
the line and that you’ll need to consider outsourcing manufacturing. You
235
Chapter 16: Consulting for Your Former Company

need to collect all the pros and cons about the new product and how it
will fit in the organization.
3. Make recommendations. After your finish your analysis, you’ll need to
come up with a set a recommendations that directly respond to the
questions that were posed to you when you first took on the project. For
example, if your task is developing a marketing and sales plan for the
new product, your recommendations would include designing that plan.
But, as an outside consultant, you also would want to discuss recom-
mendations for how to handle any objections you might have heard
from various department heads during the investigation.
4. Develop a plan for change. If part of your recommendation includes a
major shift for the organization in how it handles the type of problem
you analyzed, you should talk about how to manage the change. For
example, if during your analysis of the new product plan, you find you
need to recommend significant changes, you could be put in the role of
advocating your set of recommendations. It’s likely, if the company
wants you to be involved in change management, that would be an addi-
tional project and you would need to negotiate an extension of the con-
tract to do the work necessary to implement the change process.
5. Implement your recommendations. In some cases, your contract may
include a provision that you help implement your recommendations
even if change is not involved. For example, you could be asked to
spearhead the introduction of the new product. Once the product is
launched, you would pass the day-to-day operations to a product man-
ager who is a full-time employee who has been working with you
throughout the project. Because it is very hard to determine what your
charges should be for implementation of your recommendations prior to
developing the recommendations, you should protect yourself with a
clause for negotiating hours and fees, once the recommendations have
been accepted, that will be based on what all agree is needed.
Learning how to listen
No matter what type of consulting work you do, the most important skill you
must develop is listening. As a consultant, you don’t want to do too much of
the talking, especially as you’re collecting your information and developing
your recommendations. The best way to get information is to say as little as
possible to encourage people to talk, and sit back and listen.
Initially, you need to listen to what your client wants to accomplish by hiring
you as a consultant. You have to ask the right questions and listen carefully
to the answers. You certainly don’t want to put in hours on a contract just to
236
Part IV: Revisiting Your Former Career or Starting Your Own Business 

find out that the finished product of the contract does not satisfy the original
needs of the company. You’re wasting your time and the time of the people
who hired you if you don’t listen carefully.
Starting to Talk with Your Employer
About Consulting
If you think consulting is the right thing for you after retirement, start talking
with the managers and executives in your company who will ultimately make
the contracting decision.
Don’t start out a conversation saying you want to be a consultant. You should
instead slowly build the case for the type of project you think you want to do.
Once you’ve got them convinced that the project is necessary, then you can
start making the pitch for your handling the project after retirement.
Often as you prepare to turn your work over to others in your department
pending your retirement, you can slice out a piece of the pie (a part of your
position) that you enjoy doing the most and would like to continue doing
even after you leave the company full-time. As you sort out your key tasks,
make a list of those things you think you would be able to do very well as a
consultant.
Be sure that you pick the things for which you are well respected and seen as
the top specialist in the company. If you cut out that piece of the pie just
right, your case for becoming a consultant should just about make itself.
Researching Compensation Issues
One of the hardest things for any consultant to do is to figure out the fees
they want to charge. You definitely don’t want to sell your time cheap, but
you also don’t want to price yourself out of the market. Whatever fees you
decide to charge, be sure you’re ready to defend and justify them.
Researching fee structures
As you develop your fees, your first step should be researching what other
consultants doing similar work in the field are charging. You’ve probably
237
Chapter 16: Consulting for Your Former Company

been privy to several contract negotiations in your department with outside
consultants, and you can use their fee structure as a starting point.
If you know of others who are consulting for the company, you may be able to
discuss fees with them, but that can be a very delicate decision. You don’t
want to create problems by stepping on company rules that forbid people
from discussing compensation, so tread very carefully in this area.
You can also research fees for your area on the Internet. One good Web site is
HotGigs (www.hotgigs.com). You can register for free, pick your top-five
skills, and get an estimate for hourly fees in the areas you want to work. If
you do decide to use the network to find consulting projects, you will need to
subscribe. It’s $50 to try it out for three months, and $125 for 12 months.
HotGigs boosts that it has arranged over $700 million active gigs through its
network.
If you belong to a professional association for your specialty area, you can
contact the national or regional office for your association. They may collect
data on consultant fees for your specialty in the areas of the country you
want to work.
Setting your fees
Once you’ve collected all the data about fees, you can then figure what fee
you want to charge. Remember, as a consultant, you will have to pay all your
benefits (health insurance, disability insurance, retirement savings, and other
benefits you may currently enjoy from working for your company).
Often, benefits add another 35 percent to your actual income. For example, if
you earn $30 per hour, your benefits probably cost the company about an
additional $10 per hour. You will also need to pay all the costs to set up,
equip, and maintain your home office. Administrative costs for a company
usually run about 40 percent per employee, so that adds another $12 per
hour in costs for the company. In actuality, a person earning $30 per hour is
probably costing the company $52.
Many consultants simply set their fees as double or triple their hourly wage.
In addition, if you are planning to charge by the hour, be sure to set up a mini-
mum number of hours for you to come to the office. For example, you may
want to put in the contract that you bill a minimum of four hours per day. You
certainly don’t want to be regularly called in for a 30-minute meeting.
Because you’re working outside the office, that meeting will end up costing
238
Part IV: Revisiting Your Former Career or Starting Your Own Business 

you about four hours by the time you get ready, drive to the office, attend the
meeting, and return home.
There are other ways to set fees, too:
 You can set a daily rate for consulting. You simply calculate the rate by
multiplying eight hours times your hourly rate. If your hourly rate is $50,
then your daily rate would be $400.
 You can set a rate per project. You would need to carefully estimate the
number of hours you expect to spend on the project and then multiply
that number by your hourly rate. But, if you do set a rate per project, be
sure you specify in detail what that rate includes. One big benefit of proj-
ect fees is that you don’t have to report your hours. If you can get it
done more quickly, you will still be paid the same fee and pocket that dif-
ference as additional profit. Remember, the company is paying you for
your specialized skills, not the number of hours you work.
 You can set fees based on performance. If you expect a share in future
revenue, profits, or commission, then you want to establish a fee based
at least partially on the results of your work. You should still have a base
fee for the initial work you do plus a percentage based on the perfor-
mance aspects of the project. For example, if you are going to design a
new product launch and then get a share of the profits after implement-
ing the launch, you would set a fee for designing the launch, a fee for
your day-to-day involvement in the actual launch, and the percentage of
the company’s profits.
 You can set up a retainer fee. Some companies want a consultant to
guarantee to be available at least a minimum number of hours per
month. This can be a common arrangement for former managers and
executives. If you can arrange for a retainer fee, you would get paid a set
amount per month, no matter how many hours you work, but you would
have to be available when called. In the fee agreement, you should spec-
ify a number of hours you are guaranteeing each month. If the company
requires your services for more than that number of hours in any given
month, you should set an hourly fee that you will be paid during for
months when more of your time is needed.
However you decide to set your fees, the key is to be sure you are going to
make enough money to recover your expenses and earn a profit. You should
be sure to spell out very carefully in any written agreement who will pay for
what when it comes to expenses such as travel, entertainment (if appropriate
for the type of project you’ll be working on), copying, long-distance calls, and
any other expenses that you incur as part of your work for the company.
239
Chapter 16: Consulting for Your Former Company

Negotiating Contracts
Negotiating contract terms that are a win-win for both you and the company
are critical to a successful consulting agreement. Contracts spell out the
expectations for both sides. They should include all the necessary detail
about the scope of the project, who will be responsible for what aspects of
the project, and what the deadlines are for the project.
As a consultant, you likely won’t be responsible for every piece of informa-
tion you will be analyzing. Often there are several people inside the organiza-
tion that serve on the project team and help you get whatever internal
documentation you may need.
If your company regularly hires consultants, it probably has a standard con-
tract form with blanks that must be completed regarding the specifics of the
project you’ll be hired to do. You also may just write a one- or two-page
formal letter of agreement that spells out the details of who will be responsi-
ble for what tasks and by what time each of the tasks will be completed. Of
course this letter should also include your compensation for the project.
Since you’ve been working with the same people for many years, contract
negotiations should be relatively simple, but you should be sure that every-
thing is in writing before you start any project as a consultant. Too often con-
sultants agree to do a project for a manager or executive they know and then
find out as they near completion that they started out the project with two
different things in mind. The consultant is then stuck with doing what is
needed to satisfy the person who hired him or accept a reduced fee. You can
avoid this potential pitfall by carefully spelling out everything up front.
If you or your company wants to develop a more detailed or specific con-
tract, you may want to read the more extensive discussion about contracting
in Chapter 17, where I talk about consulting for your former industry rather
than your former employee. These types of contracts are usually much more
detailed with a lot more clauses.
Confidentiality
You likely already have a confidentiality agreement in place with your com-
pany that spells out your limitations with whom you can discuss certain com-
pany confidential details. If you plan to continue as a consultant, you should
be sure this confidentiality agreement is updated to reflect your new working
arrangement with the company.
240
Part IV: Revisiting Your Former Career or Starting Your Own Business 

You may decide that you like consulting and want to actually build a consult-
ing business in retirement. Your agreement with your company will probably
have a non-compete and nondisclosure clause that limits your ability to work
for a competing firm for at least 90 days and sometimes can be at least a year,
if you are working with highly confidential company information.
Whether or not you are planning to do consulting, you are likely to be asked
to sign a non-compete and nondisclosure agreement while you are on the job,
as well as when you leave the job. You will not be able to compete or work
with a competitor of your employer for the time specified in the agreement as
an employee, independent contractor, owner, part owner, or investor,
depending on what is specified in the agreement.
When companies ask you to sign a non-compete or nondisclosure agreement
as part of your severance or retirement package, they usually offer you some
benefits in exchange for signing, such as additional pay. If you refuse to sign,
the company can actually take you to court to prevent you from working for a
competitor or starting your own business.
Whether or not your company’s non-compete and nondisclosure agreements
are legal and binding depends on the laws in your state or locality. If you do
decide to do consulting for a competitor, be sure you understand your com-
pany’s agreements as well as the state laws governing those agreements.
In some states, these agreements are generally not legal. For example, if your
company is based in California, it cannot enforce a non-compete agreement
unless the agreement is part of the sale of a business. In California, courts
will enforce a non-complete clause only if it involves a business owner who
sold his business and agreed not to compete with the new owner as part of
the deal. Otherwise, California employees cannot be required to sign any-
thing that would restrict their ability to earn a livelihood.
In many other states, non-compete and nondisclosure agreements are legal.
While these states don’t want to restrict employees from earning a living,
their laws tend to protect companies as long as the agreements are reason-
able in scope and necessary to protect the company’s business interests.
Common restrictions allowed include that you can’t work for a competitor for
six months or within a 25 or 50 miles radius of the company.
If your job ended because your employer laid you off or encouraged you to
voluntarily retire, the non-compete clause may not hold up in court. Courts
do tend to side with the employee if the employer terminated the employ-
ment and it was not the employee’s fault.
Another issue that could come up if you are being challenged on a non-compete
clause could be the compensation you received for signing the agreement.
241
Chapter 16: Consulting for Your Former Company

For example, if you signed a non-compete agreement that restricted your
working for a competitor for six months, and part of that agreement was that
you were paid six-months’ income as severance, the court will likely consider
that reasonable compensation and uphold your company’s non-compete
clause.
In some cases, employers will ask you to sign a non-compete clause even if
it’s not enforceable in your state. This can be an intimidation tactic, so be
sure to check with an attorney if you signed a non-compete clause and decide
later you want to break it. Companies that use this tactic count on the fact
that employees don’t know the law and, in fear, will abide by the provisions
of a non-compete agreement when they leave a job even if they don’t have to
do so.
You also can contact your state’s Department of Labor (http://www.dol.
gov/esa/contacts/state_of.htm) if you have any questions about the
terms of a non-compete or nondisclosure agreement that you signed. If non-
compete agreements are legal in your state, your former employer may have
legitimate cause to sue both you and your new employer, especially if your
former company warns your new employer and the new company doesn’t 
fire you.
Even if the non-compete agreement is legal and binding, you may still be able
to work around it. Using your power of persuasion, you may be able to get
your former employer to allow you to break the non-compete agreement. If
242
Part IV: Revisiting Your Former Career or Starting Your Own Business 
When non-compete clauses lose in court
May Department Stores Company, which runs
stores such as Lord & Taylor and Marshall
Fields, tried to enforce it’s non-compete clause
when Victoria’s Secret (the lingerie store) hired
a top May’s executive as its Chief Operating
Officer. In this case the judge ruled that these
stores were not in “material competition” and
the non-compete clause was unenforceable.
At first glance you might think that Victoria’s
Secret stores do compete directly with some of
May’s department store brands — both sell mil-
lions of dollars of lingerie. But the judge didn’t
agree that there was “material competition” for
the purposes of this agreement and decided
that any confidential information about May’s
department store that the executive knew
would not give Victoria’s Secret a competitive
advantage over May.
May’s definition of competing business included
“any . . . specialty store or other retail business
that sells goods or merchandise of the types
sold in May’s (or its subsidiaries’ or divisions’)
stores at retail to consumers.” The court
decided that this definition was too broad and
would not enforce the agreement.

he says he will, be sure you get that in writing with an effective date and sig-
natures from someone who has the legal right to allow you to break the
agreement.
Expenses
Be sure to make a detailed list of all anticipated expenses for your consulting
project. Determine what types of expenses you will pay out of pocket (mostly
expenses relating to your home office and car) and what expenses you plan
to bill to the company.
While you don’t what to present an absolute total of what your expenses will
be, because things always change once you get started, you should give your
company an idea of what you expect those expenses to be. If the company
balks at your estimate of expenses, you may need to narrow the scope of the
work or negotiate a different arrangement.
It’s better to get an agreement about the expected total expenses, as well as
how and when they will be paid, before starting the project. For example, if
you are planning to have your house painted, the contractor normally will ask
you to pay certain expenses at the time you sign the contract so he can buy
the paint and other materials needed to do the job. You want to do the same
thing for any out-of-pocket costs you may need at the start of the project.
Deadlines
Deadlines must be clearly spelled out in any agreement. Often if you are
working on a project that will last longer than a month or two, you likely will
have several preliminary deadlines for update reports or meetings, as well as
a final deadline for the project.
Don’t overcommit and agree to deadlines that you know you can’t meet.
That’s the best way to lose a contract or kill any chance that you will get
another project in the future.
Your best bet is to actually promise less than you know you can do and pro-
vide even better service than you promised. That’s how you keep a client for
many years to come.
Things do happen that make it impossible to meet a promised deadline.
There can be a family emergency, another project that you took on required
more time than you expected, or numerous other reasons. As soon as you
243
Chapter 16: Consulting for Your Former Company

know you may miss a deadline, be sure to contact your clients. You usually
can salvage a relationship as long as you promptly warn about any delays
and set a new schedule that fits the needs of both you and the company.
Getting Paid
Finally, you want to be sure you get paid for your work. You will need to keep
records of the hours you worked and be ready to invoice the company either
monthly or at previously agreed upon intervals. Your payment intervals
should be clearly spelled out in any written agreement or contract.
Activity log
Each time you work on a project, you should keep a daily activity log that
specifies the time spent on the project and a brief description of what you
did. That way when it comes time to bill the client, you’ll have all the detail
you need.
If you are billing hourly, it’s much harder to try to reconstruct the number of
hours you worked at the end of the month than it is if you write it down daily.
One good way of keeping track is the calendar section of Microsoft Outlook.
You likely already are keeping track of meetings on the calendar, so just start
tracking work at home as well.
Invoices
As a consultant, you will need to invoice your time to get paid. Invoices can
be rather simple, but you will need to include your name, address, Social
Security number (or other federal ID if you have one), telephone number, and
project name or number. Your company may specify other information that’s
needed on the invoice as well.
If you are billing hourly, it’s a good idea to include some detail of the type of
work you did for each hour or group of hours you are billing. If you’re billing
by the project, you should develop your invoice based on the agreed upon
payment intervals. For example, these could be monthly or they could be
based on a percentage of work done, such as 25 percent, 50 percent, and 
100 percent.

A
fter many years of work in an industry, you’ve surely made lots of con-
tacts. When you’re getting ready to retire, you may decide you’d like to
keep your fingers in the pot.
If you do want to start a consulting business after you retire, the good time to
start is while you are still working and maintaining regular contacts with your
network. This chapter will discuss the key issues in setting up a consulting
business.
Being Your Own Boss After 
Retiring — Try Consulting
If you’d like to earn extra money after retiring, but don’t want to be required
to show up at a particular location every day, you may want to consider set-
ting up a consulting business. As a consultant, you get to set the hours and
pick the projects you’d like to work on. You set up your workspace just the
way you like it. You also get to pick the people you want to work with and for.

Anyone who has 20 to 30 years of experience in a particular field can qualify
to be a consultant. It’s up to you to package and sell yourself as an expert, so
other people will want to buy your services. In Chapter 16, I talk about the
steps involved in consulting, so I won’t repeat them here.
You will find that you take on many different roles as a consultant, such as:
 Problem-solver: Helping a company sort out a problem and coming up
with a solution.
 Detective: Figuring out what the problem is and how it can be corrected.
 Wise Man: Reviewing decisions that have already been made and vali-
dating them.
 Counselor: Helping the company figure out what is getting in the way of
success. You almost become a therapist for the business owner.
 Facilitator: Helping a company achieve its goal. For example, you could
be called to implement a major change if your specialty is change 
management.
Assessing Your Skills to Be a 
Consultant in Your Industry
First, you need to determine if you have the technical, project-management,
and personal skills to be successful as a consultant. Here is what you need to
think about:
 Technical skills: You must identify your specialty in a particular tech-
nology or function, such as computer programming, Web site design,
accounting, management, or tax. Any technical expertise that you pos-
sess and you think companies would hire you to provide can fit these
criteria.
 Project-management skills: You must be good at running projects. Some
of the tasks you may need to perform as a consultant include creating
the product, negotiating, interviewing, presenting recommendations,
problem-identification, problem-solving, time management, client serv-
ice skills, proposal development, and team-building and management
skills.
 Personal skills: You must be a very good communicator and be an excel-
lent listener. Your management, collaboration, interpersonal, marketing,
promotion, and leadership skills will also be needed to be successful as
a consultant.
246
Part IV: Revisiting Your Former Career or Starting Your Own Business 

If you think you may be weak in any of these skills, you’ll need to find a part-
ner for your consulting work. All these skills are needed by a consultant at
one time or another.
Picking Your Niche
You probably have lots of different experiences that you could develop into a
consulting business. It’s important to define your consulting business around
one or two specialty areas in which you can truly sell yourself as a specialist.
As you review your background, pick out things that you accomplished that
you believe are unique or groundbreaking in your industry. You must be care-
ful not to trade confidential company information. Not only could you get
sued, but you also will lose a lot of respect and trust among other companies.
Building and Using Your Network
For consulting, your business success depends totally on your ability to net-
work. In Chapter 4, I talked about the basics of building your network. In this
chapter, I focus on how to build and use your network to increase your possi-
bility of success as a consultant. If you’re not sure of the basics, read Chapter
4 for more details.
Finding contacts for your network
Your initial network will be co-workers and vendors who you worked with
regularly during you career. You may be able to get a few projects to get your
business going from this group of people, but you’ll have to build your net-
work beyond this group to truly develop a successful consulting business.
A good place to find networking contacts in your local area are events run by
your local Chamber of Commerce. Make an appointment with a membership
representative at your local chamber to talk about the various business groups
that operate through the chamber. You likely will find at least one group, if
not more, that will serve as a good contact for building your network.
Another good source for networking is Business Network International (BNI).
BNI’s entire purpose is to offer its business and professional members the
opportunity to share ideas, contacts, and most importantly, referrals. You prob-
ably can find a local chapter near you. Visit BNI’s Web site (www.bni.com) to
locate the nearest chapter and find out more about the organization.

Chapter 17: Consulting in Your Former Industry

When networking to build a business, it’s not enough to just get a bunch of
introductions and contact information. You need to really get to know the
person and work yourself up to a level where the person will want to recom-
mend you.
Getting to know your contacts
Your first step in getting to know someone is to actually call people whose
business cards you collected at a party or other business function. After get-
ting their card, jot down a few notes regarding your conversation on the back
of the card as well as ideas for follow-up based on your conversation.
Do this as soon as possible after the conversation so you don’t end up with a
bunch of cards and have no idea who each person is or what you talked about.
I know this can be difficult during a business function, but you likely will
forget some key details if you don’t try to find a quiet, inconspicuous place
periodically during the event to jot down some key points on each card.
Set up a time to meet them for coffee or lunch as soon as you can after the
event. When you call for an appointment, remind them of your discussion
and entice them to join you with some ideas related to a topic in which they
expressed an interest.
When you do meet, if appropriate, volunteer to discuss some tips for how
they can handle a problem they mentioned that relates to your business.
Don’t start pushing for business right away unless the conversation naturally
flows in that direction.
Remember, this first meeting is a “get-to-know-you” session, not a sales ses-
sion. If you come on too strong, you may never get to the next steps, which
permit you to build a long-lasting relationship.
Becoming a known entity
As you get to know each other, you may mutually decide you want to get to
know each other even better. That’s when you can start building a business
relationship. People do business with other people with whom they feel com-
fortable working with. You want to get into your potential client’s comfort zone.
As part of this process, do a lot of listening and asking questions. Show you
are truly interested in the other person and his business. You’ll find out a lot
more about the other person and how you might help them by listening
248
Part IV: Revisiting Your Former Career or Starting Your Own Business 

rather than talking. As you talk, offer some simple tips or solutions to build
up your credibility with your potential client.
When you become a known entity, the person may mention you to someone
else, but they won’t feel comfortable enough to recommend you. They’ll be
able to tell others about your expertise and background, but won’t put their
reputation on the line by encouraging someone else to work with you.
Becoming someone to recommend
When your contact feels comfortable to highly recommend you to others,
you’ve successfully built a strong addition to your network. This is when
your contact starts selling you.
You probably won’t get to this point until you’ve actually done one or two
projects for your contact, but you may be able to reach this point more
quickly by helping them out of a few quick binds and offering tips or advice
during a lunch or telephone conversation.
You might be able to get to this point rather quickly with someone who
you’ve worked with over the years either at your former company or at a
company with which you did business. Don’t forget to keep in contact with
those who have known you for years. Be sure to let them know what you’re
planning to do. They can’t help you if they don’t know your plans!
Understanding Your Non-Compete
Clauses
When you retire, you are likely to be required to sign a non-compete clause
that could limit your ability to consult for companies that compete with your
former company for 6 and possibly as long as 12 months. If you are asked to
sign a non-compete clause, be certain you are getting compensated for sign-
ing that clause, especially if you are considering starting your own consulting
business.
If you signed the clause already and decided to start a consulting business
several weeks or months after you retired, you will have to live with it, but
take it to an attorney for review. Each state has its own set of rules about how
non-compete clauses can be written. Sometimes companies write clauses
that are really not enforceable. I talk more about this problem in Chapter 16.
249
Chapter 17: Consulting in Your Former Industry

Pricing Your Services
Pricing yourself is the most difficult task you’ll face. You must carefully bal-
ance your need to earn a certain amount of money to cover your expenses
and make a profit with your ability to stay competitive and not price yourself
out of the market.
If you’ve done a good job of developing your reputation as a specialist, your
ability to set your price high is greatly improved. Companies that know you
can get the job done based on projects you’ve already done for them or
based on strong recommendations they’ve gotten from others will be more
willing to pay you top dollar.
Networking with others to 
gather pricing details
Your best way to find out what people charge for similar consulting work is to
bring the issue up for discussion at various networking events, such as those
mentioned above through your local Chamber of Commerce.
Another good place to network in order to find pricing information is your
professional association. You’ll likely find others who attend association
meetings that also consult for a living for either the same industry in which
you plan to work or another industry. They will likely be willing to discuss fee
structures, especially if you won’t be competing with them for the exact same
projects.
Setting your price
You likely will set your price differently with each type of consulting opportu-
nity. In some cases, you may find it best to price a rate per hour, in others
you may quote a daily rate. You also may want to set a price for an entire pro-
ject, regardless of the number of hours you spent working on it. I talk more
about setting prices in Chapter 16.
Whatever price you set, you want to be sure you cover all your expenses and
time, as well as leave room for some profit. You should also specify carefully
what is included in the price and what expenses you will bill for separately.
For example, if part of the project involves a significant amount of travel, you
should set up your contract to bill those travel expenses separately.
250
Part IV: Revisiting Your Former Career or Starting Your Own Business 

You can also set a monthly retainer fee, once you have developed a strong
working relationship with the company. Your retainer fee would guarantee
your availability to the company for a certain number of hours per month. If
you work more than that set number of hours, you would then include an
hourly or daily rate for the time spent working for that company beyond the
retainer fee guarantee.
Writing Your Contracts
Once you’ve picked your niche and established your fee structure, it’s time 
to sit down with an attorney and draft a basic contract. You won’t use the
exact same contract for all clients, but you will find that there are many basic
clauses that can be used with minor adjustments for each consulting job 
you take.
Remember, the primary purpose of a contract is to protect yourself and the
earnings you expect to receive from your clients. While verbal agreements
can sometimes hold up in court if someone doesn’t pay you, it’s very hard to
prove what was agreed to verbally. It’s best to put everything in writing
before you get started.
Finding an attorney
Use the opportunity to build a relationship with an attorney you can call on
for emergencies that crop up. You can set up appointments with the attorney
periodically to review any problems you’ve had during the year and possible
changes you may need to your standard contract or the way you do business.
Attorneys can help:
 You decide upon and set up your business structure, which will likely be
a sole proprietorship (one owner) or partnership. But if you think you
have a great risk of being sued, you may want to consider establishing
yourself as a limited liability company or a corporation. As you discuss
your business plans with your attorney, he can advise what might be
best for you.
 Advise you on regulations that could affect your business and assist you
with filing paperwork for necessary licenses, permits, or registrations. If
you plan to work out of your home, you need to be sure that you under-
stand any limitations to doing so depending on homeowner association
covenants or local ordinances.
251
Chapter 17: Consulting in Your Former Industry

 Advise you on what types of business insurance you may need and pos-
sibly even refer you to a good agent.
 Assist you if you have problems collecting from a client. Sometimes a
letter from your lawyer can be enough incentive to pay, avoiding a more
costly collection battle.
 Advise you on how to avoid possible lawsuits as a consultant and
defend you in court if it becomes necessary. Hopefully by working with
an attorney long before you face any problems, you’ll have the skills and
knowledge to minimize any hostilities and avoid a costly lawsuit.
Depending on your type of consulting business, you may find it useful to hire
an attorney on retainer, so you have someone to call on in emergencies who
knows your business. The best way to find an attorney is through referrals
from friends and associates who run their own business. Another good
source for recommendations is the local Chamber of Commerce.
Understanding contract parts
How detailed your contract will need to be depends on the type of consulting
business you plan to run and the type of clients you’ll be working with. You
may find that a two- or three-page letter of agreement will suffice, or your
attorney may recommend that you work with something more extensive to
protect your interests.
While you may not use all these elements, I review the key parts of a contract
so you don’t forget to include any important ones when you draft your agree-
ments. All contracts will have the names and addresses of the parties involved
in the contract. It’s also important that the contract be signed and dated.
This date can be critical if a dispute crops up later on. Here are the other key
parts of a contract.
Writing a short summary of the project
You should start any contact with a brief section that provides some back-
ground for the agreement. In this section, you should include a brief descrip-
tion of the parties, their interest in an agreement, and the project that is the
subject of the contract.
For example, suppose Mr. ABC is a human resources consultant who assists
companies with upgrades to their personnel software. In this scenario, you
can say that ABC Consulting, a consulting company owned by Mr. ABC,
agrees to provide recommendations regarding the type of human resources
software that would be best for XYZ Company, a manufacturing firm in the
auto industry. Mr. ABC will review the current system, interview XYZ Company
252
Part IV: Revisiting Your Former Career or Starting Your Own Business 

executives and managers, and then make recommendations for the company.
If the recommendations are accepted, XYZ will consider a second contract
for implementation with details to be worked out at that time.
Defining the promises made
In this section, you would list what each party promises to do as part of the
contract. Depending on the project, it could be the amount to be paid and the
services to be rendered in exchange for the amount paid.
For example, if part of the project entails selling something, you should lay
out specifics of what will be sold, for how much, and by whom. You also
should detail who pays what expenses, such as manufacturing, shipping, and
so forth.
If the project includes specialist consulting services, you likely will need to
include an attachment that details those services. You should also be sure to
spell out the expectations of both parties in detail. Not only will this help to
define the project and be sure everyone is on board, it will also protect you
later if the client is not happy with your work.
While, in the name of good customer service, you should always try to satisfy
the client. Sometimes you may decide to do additional work just to make a
customer happy, other times you may need to walk away from a situation
where your client continues to raise the bar of expectations beyond what you
promised. As long as you carefully spelled out expectations up front, you will
have the ammunition you need to put your foot down, say no, and expect to
get paid.
Specifying a deadline
You should specify the date by which the work must be done, as well as who
will get what work done when. Many times both you and your client will need
to meet deadlines in order for the project to be completed on time. You want
to be sure you have a detailed list of these deadlines and what each party to
the contract is required to do to meet these deadlines.
For example, if there are a number of pieces that must be completed before
the final analysis can be done, you should set up a work schedule for both
parties. This schedule should list all the information needed, who will be
responsible for gathering each piece of information, and a date by which the
information gathering must be completed.
Any part of the schedule that is critical should include the words, “time is of
the essence.” If you end up in a dispute later and these words are missing,
the judge could decide to give more leeway to the timing and not enforce the
deadlines.
253
Chapter 17: Consulting in Your Former Industry

You will also want to specify for how long the contract will be in effect. While
you can extend any time frame, you do want the ability to renegotiate ele-
ments of the contract, such as price, if the time frame exceeds an agreed-
upon end date. Everyone’s costs of operating increases over time. You need
to protect yourself by not setting your fees permanently, but providing for a
renegotiation of fees after a set number of months or years.
Establishing your price and how you’ll be paid
You definitely must include the price for your services, or if you don’t have a
set price for the project, you should include the method that will be used to
determine your fee. For example, you may specify an hourly or daily rate for
the life of the agreement. If your compensation includes pay for specific per-
formance, you need to specify what that pay will be and how performance
will be determined.
You also should specify terms for payment, whether you will be paid monthly
or according to some set schedule. For example, suppose you agreed to
divide the project with a series of due dates for different parts of the project.
When you meet the deadline for each part of the project, your contract will
specify that you be paid an installment toward the full fee. You should specify
when those installments must be paid and what portion of the total contract
fee will be paid at each installment.
Terminating the contract
You should always include a clause that spells out how the contract can be
terminated and what must be paid if the contract is terminated early. For
example, if you’ve completed half the work and the client decides to kill the
project, you want to protect yourself with a termination clause that requires
the client to pay some portion of your services. Your client will likely want
protection as well from your walking away in the middle of a contract without
proper notice.
You may have damages when a client decides to terminate a contract, such
as expenses that you incurred as part of the project or time you spent on the
project. Your contract should specify damages for terminating a contract and
how those damages will be determined. Damages are paid by the person who
breaches the contract.
Assigning the work
If you think you would like to hire someone else to do part of the project, you
will need a clause that specifies that you have the right to assign the work to
a person of your choosing. Your client might not like such a blanket state-
ment and may want the right to interview and refuse to work with a person
you are thinking of hiring.
254
Part IV: Revisiting Your Former Career or Starting Your Own Business 

You need to spell out how work can be assigned and if there are any provi-
sions for the company to review your selection. You, of course, want as much
freedom to hire others, but the company could object.
As long as your contract specifies that you can assign work, the company
can’t forbid you from doing so. But, if a dispute about a particular person you
hired or a company to whom you subcontracted comes up, you must be will-
ing to work out a compromise to keep the project or risk the possibility that
the company will terminate the contract.
Handling disputes
You should lay out how the parties to the contract will handle a dispute situa-
tion if one should arise. For example, you may specify that disputes should
be handled by arbitration or mediation. Both parties may then be able to
avoid a lengthy court battle.
You also want to specify who pays attorney’s costs if a dispute arises. For
example, you could state that the party who breaches the contract will be
responsible for both parties’ attorneys’ fees and legal costs.
You should also specify where notices of disputes or defaults should be sent
and the amount of time each party has to respond to the notices.
Picking state law
If you and your client operate in different states, you should specify in the con-
tract which state’s laws will apply if there is a dispute. Laws vary from state to
state, so you need to establish the state’s laws that will take precedence.
Designing your contracts
You may find that many of the sections in your contracts will be the same
with each contract, or only minimal changes will be needed. You could ask
your attorney to develop a contract with blanks that can be used to fill in any
details that change with each contract.
You may want to do a bit of research to collect contracts that other consul-
tants in your field are using. Trade associations can be a good source for
sample contracts. People in your network may also be able to help with this
research.
If your company hired consultants frequently, you might want to review some
of the contracts and take notes to help you with designing your own contract.
255
Chapter 17: Consulting in Your Former Industry

Writing Proposals
You will find yourself writing proposals frequently, but before you even start
writing, be sure you understand the scope of the project and what it is your
client really wants to achieve. Consultants usually are called in when there is
a major problem and no one inside the company knows how to fix it.
Even if you are writing your proposal based on a formal request for proposal,
set up an appointment with the person in charge of the proposal process or
someone that person designates. Carefully review the request for proposal
and prepare some incisive questions about the project before the appoint-
ment. At the appointment, gather as much information as you can about the
company’s expectations. The more you know, the stronger your proposal will
be. This meeting also will give you an opportunity to establish rapport with
one of the decisions makers.
You should always start your written response to a request for proposal with
a brief summary of what the client wants. Then include one or two sentences
that state something that will get the client’s attention and make him eager to
read the rest of your proposal.
Follow carefully the guidelines laid out in the request for proposals. If you
don’t, you could just be knocked out of the game for not following directions.
Companies design these instructions based on how they want to select possi-
ble candidates. If they have to do too much work to figure out your response
to their request for proposals, you could get you knocked out of the running
as well.
You’ll usually find that companies give you a list of specific tasks that they
want done as part of the project and what must be accomplished with each
task. When you design your response, be sure to use these tasks as heads for
each section of your response. Make it as easy for them to find the informa-
tion as possible.
Companies will also ask you for your relevant experience and expertise,
which you should be able to provide in a brief paragraph or two in most
instances for a short proposal. If you become one of the final candidates, you
will likely then be asked for a more detailed discussion of your expertise and
experience.
You’ll also be asked to specify your fees. You probably don’t want to specify
your fees too early in the process, but you could come up with some line that
gives a range of fees depending on what is needed. This gives you a lot of
negotiating room at the time of final contract.
256
Part IV: Revisiting Your Former Career or Starting Your Own Business 

Setting Up a Successful 
Consulting Business
Your consulting business will only be successful if you start out by defining
what you want to do and how you want to do it. If you’re serious about want-
ing to have a consulting business, don’t start looking for clients while devel-
oping the business on the fly. You should develop a business plan, and figure
out who you want in your network and how you’ll use your network to get
business.
Developing a business plan
You probably have written or been involved in the development of business
plans for your former employer. You should make the same effort to develop
a business strategy for your own company.
You must figure out your business mission and goals to know where you’d
like it to go and how you want to sell yourself. You must determine your 
business’s niche and what knowledge and expertise makes you the expert in
that field.
Once you’ve defined your business and how you want to sell yourself, then
you need to decide what your ideal client might look like and how you would
recognize one when you see him.
Finally, you have to figure out what you might use to attract your ideal client
to do business with you. Now you’re ready to begin building your network for
your consulting business.
Networking effectively
Start building your network by identifying the types of business or social
groups where you are most likely to find your ideal client. Former co-workers
and vendors who fit the profile should be the first ones you contact to let
them know your plans. They can become the core of your new business net-
work and possibly lead you to some other good prospects.
As you start making the rounds to network at the various business and social
groups on your list, practice becoming a good listener. You’ve probably been
to a lot of these types of functions before and couldn’t stand the people who
257
Chapter 17: Consulting in Your Former Industry

were always looking for business that talked incessantly about themselves.
You know how bored you were and couldn’t wait to get away from them.
Don’t become them!
Instead, learn to listen and ask astute questions. Develop a few good one-
liners to pique people’s interest about you and your business, but always try
to find a way to switch the conversation back to the other person by asking a
question to show interest in your potential client.
By asking thought-provoking questions, you can get your potential client
looking at his business in a different way. As you talk, you can share a tip that
helped you solve a similar problem he is now facing or tell him about a
resource where he might be able to save money or time.
People don’t pick people to do business with because they understand what
it is you do. Instead, they pick people who they believe understand what they
do. When they decide to hire you as a consultant, it’s because they’ve
become convinced that you understand their problem and you can find a
solution.
Be careful not to try to sell yourself or your business too early in any conver-
sation. People who are perceived as pushy, seeking business or referrals too
early in the conversation, can be seen as rude. People will just find an excuse
to get away from you as quickly as possible.
Instead, use these initial contacts to make new friends. Connect with people
who you think share similar interests and get their contact information. Then
call them to meet for lunch or a drink where you can begin the process of
developing a long-term business relationship.
Following-up regularly
When you get back to your office, review the business cards you collected at
the networking event. Prioritize the cards into an order in which you will
make follow-up contacts with each potential client.
People with whom you believe you had a strong connection, and you think
may have an immediate need for your expertise, should be among the first
that you contact for follow-up. Call and set up a lunch date as soon as possi-
ble and start the process of getting to know them better.
You should follow-up as soon as you can after a networking event with all the
people you met that you’d like in your network, even if you don’t believe they
will have any business for you anytime soon. You want to at least have one
258
Part IV: Revisiting Your Former Career or Starting Your Own Business 

“get to know you” conversation while the initial meeting is still fresh in your
mind, as well as in the mind of the person you’d like to add to your network.
Don’t always be on the hunt for new business. When doing follow-up, be on
the hunt to learn more about your network participants. As you develop your
credibility, your services will be sought. Always be on the alert for informa-
tion that may help you identify a business opportunity, but be certain the
timing is right to make the pitch for your services.
Offer your network members suggestions that will help them solve minor
problems. As they find your ideas beneficial, they will seek you out for solu-
tions to major problems. That’s when you can start to sell your consulting
services.

Buying or Starting Your Own
Business or Franchise
In This Chapter
 Building your own business
 Buying an existing business
 Franchising
S
ome people are using their retirement as a time to start the business
they dreamed about all their working life. Others decide they don’t want
all the work of starting a business from scratch, so they look for an existing
business that matches their dream.
Another option you can consider if you want your own business is franchis-
ing. You may find this an attractive way to start a business, especially if you
would like the support of a national brand.
In this chapter, I review the pros and cons of these three options, as well
explain the basics you need to get started in each.
Starting Your Own Business
Many people dream about being their own boss and running their own 
business. Some people retire from their company so they can roll out their
employer-based retirement savings and use some of that money to fund the
start-up of their dream. Others find they just don’t have enough money in
retirement and start a small business to supplement their income rather than
go back to work for someone else.
You can start the business with two different goals — to build a going con-
cern (a company that has the resources to continue to operate — in other
words, a company that’s not bankrupt!) and fully fund your retirement or just
to supplement a decent retirement income.

Supplementing your retirement
If you’re just looking to supplement a decent retirement income, you should
consider a start-up business that doesn’t require a huge upfront investment.
That way you won’t put any of your retirement savings at risk.
In the active-adult community in which I live, many of the retirees started
their businesses based on a hobby from which they found a way to make a
profit. For example, some folks who enjoy painting started a paint contracting
business. Woodworkers do small carpentry jobs for their neighbors. Many
quickly find they have more work than they really want.
262
Part IV: Revisiting Your Former Career or Starting Your Own Business 
Carolyn-E’s Dry Cleaning Valet Service
Dick and Carolyn Bernstein found that rising
healthcare costs were eroding their retirement
plans. Dick retired from Honeywell with a decent
retirement, and Carolyn retired from real estate.
They toyed with a number of business ideas
before starting their dry cleaning valet service.
The idea grew out of total frustration with the
one dry cleaner in the neighborhood who over-
charged for poor-quality service. They searched
the Orlando area for a good dry cleaner and
finally found one with decent pricing about 27
miles away. This gave them the idea for what is
now their new business: Carolyn-E’s Dry Clean-
ing Valet Service. They worked out a deal with
the dry cleaner in Orlando who gave them
enough profit to pick up and deliver dry cleaning
from their neighbors.
Their first advertising did get them a few cus-
tomers, but ticked off a bunch of neighbors.
They put hangers on people’s doors with the
company name. It was windy and the hangers
blew everywhere. While the first marketing 
idea did cause some problems, it also got them
their first few customers and their business has
blossomed from there, doubling in size month
after month.
They’ve expanded this business by finding some
commercial accounts, where they stop by area
businesses and pick up dry cleaning from indi-
viduals at those businesses. Business people
especially like the idea of someone who can
pick up and deliver dry cleaning so they don’t
have to run out themselves. They’ve found great
success approaching car dealerships and real
estate companies.
Dick was not new to starting and running a busi-
ness. He was involved in his family business
when he was younger and started several other
businesses before beginning what turned out to
be a 23-year stint with Honeywell.
Dick drew up a brief five-year business plan 
for himself for his current business. He’s on
target with his initial projections. He didn’t need
to write an extensive plan to take to banks for
funding because the start-up costs were so
cheap.
The biggest drain on the business’s profits were
rising gas prices, which put his profits at risk
during much of the first year in 2006 when gas
prices hit more than $3 a gallon. He almost had
to increase prices, but knew that could result in
lost customers, which can really hurt a business
that just started. The only major purchase they
made was a new vehicle that would be better
for this type of business than the one they had.

Others who retired from a family business, and passed their old business on
to their kids, start something smaller that they promote just within their
neighborhood. For example, one person who owned a construction business
started a new home inspection business. Another person who owned a large
hair salon, opened a small business doing neighbors’ hair in her home. Still
others found a service missing in the community and started their own small
business to fill the need.
A common thread in all the businesses is that they all retired and wanted to
make some extra cash, but didn’t want to put in the hours they had when
they worked or ran their business full-time. They don’t have to depend on
their business to live because they do have retirement income, but they want
to supplement that income. Starting from that perspective, one doesn’t have
to plan a massive marketing effort. In fact, word-of-mouth is what has worked
the best for all of them.
You can get some good ideas about how to start and run a business through
the Small Business Administration (SBA; www.sba.org). I talk more about
what’s available in the next section. In the “Getting started — developing a
business plan” section, I talk about how to develop a business plan and get
your business off the ground.
Funding your retirement
If you need your business to fund your retirement, you essentially should
expect to work more than full-time and earn very little for the first few years.
That’s when a sizeable rollover of your employer-based retirement savings
can help to fund your personal needs through the early years of the business.
If you do choose this route, you will be taking a great risk that you could run
out of money during retirement if the business does not succeed, so tread
carefully and seek help to determine if your plans are solid.

Dick’s day starts with a round of golf, while
Carolyn handles calls for pickups. She gives him
a list of stops when he gets back from golf. He
makes his pickups, delivers the clothes to the
dry cleaner in Orlando, and picks up whatever
is completed from the day before. He then deliv-
ers the clean clothes and often picks up the
next batch for cleaning at the same time. It’s a
simple business to run and one that can easily
be done from home and still give Dick and
Carolyn time to enjoy their retirement. In addition
to handling the business calls, Carolyn helps
with the pickups and deliveries in the community.
In addition to starting his dry cleaning business,
Dick also serves as a consultant for other small
businesses in the area to earn some additional
money.

Luckily, there’s a lot of free help available for you, so don’t try to go it alone.
Here are some of the best resources you can count on if you do want to start
a small business.
Free courses
The Small Business Administration offers an extensive array of free courses
for small-business owners. You’ll find courses about how to get started, busi-
ness management, financing, marketing and advertising, business planning
tools, government contracting, risk management and cyber security, 
e-commerce, and taxation.
You can find them at http://www.sba.gov/training/. You’ll also find
links to national training events, an extensive online business library, and
online university and college business courses.
Service Corps of Retired Executives (SCORE)
SCORE (www.score.org) enables retired executives to offer their volunteer
services to business owners. You can get help developing your business plan
and finding funding for it. In Chapter 20, I give you more details about SCORE
and how it works.
Small Business Development Centers (SBDCs)
The SBA administers the Small Business Development Center program as a
cooperative effort among the private sector, the educational community, and
federal, state, and local governments. By working with an SBDC, you can get
needed management and technical assistance.
There are 63 lead SBDCs in the country with at least one in every state, the
District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, Samoa, and the U.S. Virgin islands.
These lead SBDCs support a network of more than 1,100 service locations
that can be located at colleges, universities, community colleges, vocational
schools, chambers of commerce, and economic development corporations.
You can get SBDC assistance that is tailored to your needs as a small-business
person. Each center develops services in cooperation with the local SBA dis-
trict offices to ensure statewide coordination with other available resources.
You can find the SBDC service location closest to you at www.sba.gov/sbdc/.
Each center has a director, staff members, volunteers, and part-time person-
nel. Qualified individuals recruited from professional and trade associations,
the legal and banking community, academia, chambers of commerce, and
SCORE (the Service Corps of Retired Executives) are among those who donate
their services. SBDCs also use paid consultants, consulting engineers, and
testing laboratories from the private sector to help clients who need special-
ized expertise.

Women’s Business Centers (WBCs)
If you’re a woman and want to start your own business, the SBC also provides
a network of 80 educational centers designed to assist women start and grow
small businesses. WBCs operate to level the playing field for women entrepre-
neurs who still face unique obstacles in the world of business. To find out
more about their services, go to http://www.onlinewbc.gov/wbc.pdf.
Getting started — developing 
a business plan
Before you even think about asking for help, you must be able to answer
these two questions: “What do I want to sell?” and “Why should people want
to buy it from me?” If you have a business dream in mind, you’ll probably find
it easy to answer the first question, “What do I want to sell?”, but you may
find it much harder to answer the second question, “Why should people want
to buy it from me?”
As you try to answer that second question, make a list of your unique skills
and services you might offer in conjunction with the product you want to sell
to make your product or service stand out in people’s minds. For example,
Dick and Carolyn Bernstein, featured in the sidebar about their dry-cleaning
valet service, added the pickup and delivery features to make their business
unique. Not only did it minimize their start-up costs because the business
could be run completely out of the home without having the costs of setting
up a retail store, but they also offered something rather unique in dry clean-
ing in the area — pickup and delivery.
It’s that type of innovate planning that can help your business take off. You
may hate the idea of writing a business plan, but if you do take the time, it
will help you think through what you want to do and improve the success of
your business.
You should think about these key points as you develop your business plan:
 Detail your proposed business idea and why you think this business
makes sense given the current market conditions. Don’t only think
about your great idea as you sort this out. Be sure to look at the compe-
tition you’ll face, as well as the state of the economy.
 Sort out your start-up finances. Be sure you estimate how much money
you’ll need to get your business started and operate it during the first
year. You certainly don’t want to get started with a great idea just to find
out six months down the road you can’t afford to keep it going.
265
Chapter 18: Buying or Starting Your Own Business or Franchise

 Figure out when you think you can recover your initial investment
and when you think the business will show a reasonable profit. You
need to estimate initial sales and project sales growth, then subtract any
expenses you expect for running the business, including buying your
products, marketing and advertising, and administrative expenses.
 Develop a list of challenges you expect to face as you start your busi-
ness. Then figure out a plan for how you will overcome the challenges
and make your business a success.
If you’ve never developed a business plan before, I highly recommend 
that you take the online business-planning course at www.sba.gov/
starting_business/startup/guide.html. Click on “Online Business
Planning Course” in the “Supporting Resources” section.
Marketing your business
As part of the initial planning phase, you should determine how you will
market your business. Start by doing a market and industry analysis. This
should include the following:
 Describe the market for your product or service. You should detail all
the research you did regarding the size of your market, the number of
potential customers for your product or service, and your projected
growth rates for your business, as well as the industry in which in plan
to operate.
 Take an overview of your competition. You must determine what com-
panies currently offer products or services similar to what you offer.
Remember, the customer seeks a product to solve a problem. Think
about the problem you’ll be solving and then think about the products
or services that may solve that same problem in a different way.
For example, people want to communicate with their friends and family.
They can do that using lots of different means: telephones, e-mails,
Internet phone service, or cellphones. So even if you plan to sell Internet
phone service and you think this is a new and innovative field, you must
remember that the customer won’t only be looking at your Internet
phone service versus other Internet phones services, he also will be
looking at other ways to do what he wants — talk to his family and
friends.
So don’t limit your review of competition too narrowly. Think of it from
what you are providing that the customer wants and all the ways the
customer may be able to satisfy that desire.
 Learn from your competition. As you collect information about your
competition, take the time to look at what they are doing right and what
they are doing wrong in marketing their product. You can pick up the
266
Part IV: Revisiting Your Former Career or Starting Your Own Business 

good ideas and improve on the bad ones as you develop your own mar-
keting plans.
But, be sure you don’t overstep your bounds and infringe on trademarks
or copyrights. You could be stuck with large legal bills defending your-
self if you use something you shouldn’t. For example, you can copy add-
on services a similar company offers, but you can’t use their marketing
logo (or trademark) and you can’t copy their advertising designs.
Funding your business
After you’ve collected all the information you need to detail your product or
service and what it will cost to offer it, assess your competition, project your
potential sales, and design your marketing plans (see the earlier sections,
“Getting started — developing a business plan” and “Marketing your business,”
for more information on these topics), you’ll be ready to put together some
numbers to figure out how much money you need to get started. Use this infor-
mation to develop a budget for the first year and project a five-year budget.
Your budget should be as truthful as you can make it, but it doesn’t have to
be carved in stone. Even well-established companies draw up budgets each
year and might need to make adjustments during the year if market condi-
tions change.
The primary purpose of this initial budgeting process is to give you an opportu-
nity to figure out all the details of how your business will operate and how much
money you’ll need during the first year. You need to take a stab at analyzing
your cash flow and where it will come from in order to have any chance of suc-
cess. Many businesses fail in the first two years because they failed to accu-
rately project their cash flow needs and ran out of money. In fact, it’s the second
most common reason for failure. The number one reason is poor management.
267
Chapter 18: Buying or Starting Your Own Business or Franchise
Avoiding trademark trouble
A classic example of a major corporation get-
ting in trouble and spending millions of dollars
is the ongoing battles between the Beatles’s
recording company, Apple Corps Ltd., and Apple
Computer. When Apple Computer decided on its
name and icon, they settled a dispute with
Beatles by signing an agreement in 1977 detail-
ing how Apple Computer could use the name. 
In 1990, Apple Corps filed suit because it said
Apple Computer had breached its agreement
when it started offering the iPod and called it
AppleMusic. The Beatles won that suit and
Apple Computer had to pay Apple Corps $26 mil-
lion to settle the claim. The battle started again
when Apple Computer introduced iTunes.

Without the money you need to market and sell your product, as well as pay
any staff or consultants you might need to hire, your business will need to
cut back, likely causing its demise. You can’t sell a product or service without
marketing it. Yet many businesses in trouble start cutbacks by skimping on
marketing. In the section on funding a franchise below, you’ll see that the
franchisor recommends that marketing and advertising get the lion’s share of
funds available for a home-based business in the first year.
If you do plan to start from home, your start-up costs will be much less than
if you have to pay the lease for retail or other commercial space. If you can
start the business with your spouse as your partner and put off hiring staff
until your business starts earning enough money, you can reduce your fund-
ing needs.
If you do need to raise funds from others to get your business started, you can
find other possible sources to tap — just check out the sections that follow.
Personal savings
While you might have a sizeable retirement nest egg that you can use, be cer-
tain you’re not putting your entire retirement savings at risk on one business
idea. Remember the adage you heard from a very young age — “Don’t put all
your eggs in one basket.”
Starting a new business is a high-risk venture. Retirement is not the time to
invest all your savings in something with such high risks. Rather than take
out your retirement funds, you may want to consider a small personal loan
through your bank. Some people start businesses using credit cards, but
beware they have the highest interest rates, making it even more difficult to
fund your business long-term as interest eats up any profits.
Friends and families
You may be able to tap family members or friends for cash as early investors.
If you do know someone interested, you may be able to get money interest
free or at a very low interest rate.
Banks and credit unions
You will need a well-thought-out business plan to have a chance at getting a
loan through a bank or credit union. Your best bet is to work on getting a
Small Business Administration loan through a participating bank, but be pre-
pared for a complex and long application process. You can find out more
about SBA financing at www.sba.gov/starting_business/financing/
applyloan.html.

Part IV: Revisiting Your Former Career or Starting Your Own Business 

Venture capital firms
This source of funds is primarily for businesses that have already proved suc-
cessful and are looking for an investor to expand and get to the next level of
operations.
Deciding your business location
A key decision in all of this is whether you plan to start your business at
home or in commercial office or retail space. That decision will drive your
budget and your method of operations. While working from home is by far
the cheapest way to go, it might not make sense if you’re thinking of starting
a retail business.
Many communities have limitations on what type of business you can run
from your home. Most limit traffic into and out of the home for business pur-
poses. So, if your business requires frequent visits from your customers, you
should definitely check on the rules for running a business out of your home
before you get started.
Buying an Existing Business
Starting a small business from home to supplement your income might be a
great idea for retirees, but if you truly need an immediate cash flow from your
business to pay your mortgage and other major bills, you’re probably better
off buying a business that is already successful. Building a business that will
provide significant cash flows can take 10 to 15 years or more, so you can’t
really count on a business for cash flow to meet significant personal needs in
the early years of operation.
Buying a going concern (a company that has the resources to continue to
operate) that already proved it can make money and provide you with a good
cash flow is a much better bet for many retirees who need almost the equiva-
lent of their previous full-time income. By buying a business, you can also
reduce the start-up costs of time, money, and energy.
Your cash flow from the business can start immediately because you’ll have
inventory and receivables (money due from customers). You also can count
on an existing customer base and an easier time raising capital, because
you’ll have a proven cash flow from the business.
269
Chapter 18: Buying or Starting Your Own Business or Franchise

But remember, buying an existing business will require an initial investment
that is much greater than starting a business from scratch. While it’s great to
have all the business basics in place — cash flow, customers, and inventory —
you do have to pay for it all.
Deciding what type of business to buy
Your first step is to decide what type of business you want to buy. Don’t look
at something you don’t enjoy doing. For example, you could find out about a
great deal on a bakery, but if you don’t know anything about baking or run-
ning a bakery, it’s not the right choice for you.
270
Part IV: Revisiting Your Former Career or Starting Your Own Business 
Tropics
Howie and Sandy Brecher looked at starting a
business from scratch and buying an existing
small business after Howie was downsized as 
a top executive in a chemical manufacturing
firm in his early 50s. They quickly ruled out start-
ing a business from scratch because they knew
it would take too long to generate a decent 
cash flow.
At first Howie thought he would buy a chemical
manufacturing firm, a field he’d worked in for his
entire career, but as he evaluated the busi-
nesses on the market, he found major problems
facing all of them. So he started considering
other options.
While he did work with a business broker, he
ended up hearing about the business they now
own from a friend — retail stores on the Jersey
shore called Tropics and Coconuts. When they
bought the business, the operation included
three stores, and this year they decided to open
a fourth that offers plus sizes called Tropics Too.
The stores sell primarily high-end beach fash-
ions with near-exclusive rights to a top brand,
Fresh Produce Sportswear. Their stores carry
the comprehensive inventory of this popular line,
so they attract customers from all around New
Jersey and the Philadelphia area. They do carry
other products from a total of about 60 vendors.
Howie didn’t know much about fashion or run-
ning a retail operation, but Sandy did. Sandy
takes responsibility for making the fashion buying
decisions and hiring the staff, while Howie man-
ages the finances. They formed a good partner-
ship with each contributing unique skills, and
continue to build a successful business.
Howie said the most important thing to do when
buying a business is careful due diligence. You
need to do a lot more than just look at the num-
bers on a piece of paper. He said it’s important
to go into the operation and observe what goes
on. As long as you know enough about the type
of business, you should be able to observe sales
and determine if the numbers make sense.
You also must understand the demographics for
the business and whether you believe those
demographics will continue to work in favor of
maintaining an ongoing business. For example,
Sandy grew up in Jersey and knew the econom-
ics of the Jersey shore. She was able to quickly
determine that the market was a good one and
would likely be so for a long time to come.

You best bet is to buy a business related to the field you’ve in worked before.
Or you could consider buying a business related to your favorite hobby or
some other passion. In fact, if you’ve been working for a small business and
you know it’s doing well, you might find out if that business is for sale. Owners
will rarely let employees know that a business is on the market, so it can’t
hurt to ask.
Finding businesses for sale
Occasionally you’ll see a sign posted on a small business indicating it’s for
sale, but more often than not you’ll never know that a business you walk into
every day is for sale. The following sections detail the number of ways to find
businesses that are for sale.
Newspaper ads
You can check your local business newspapers for a listing of businesses for
sale, but don’t count on this as your primary source for finding opportuni-
ties. Very few businesses will advertise publicly that they are for sale.
Business professionals
You should check with bankers, lawyers, accountants, insurance agents, and
real estate brokers that you know for possible opportunities. They are usu-
ally the first to hear that a business may be on the market. If you don’t know
anyone in this network of professionals, call friends who you think may be
connected.
Business suppliers
Another good network you can tap is suppliers for the type of business you’d
like to buy. They often know who might be thinking of selling their business.
For example, if you’d like to own a small hardware store, check with suppliers
that sell tools and other items sold in hardware stores.
Trade associations
Most businesses have a trade association related to their type of business.
For example, if you want to buy a bookstore, find out if there is a local book-
sellers’ association. Often employees of the association will be aware if one of
their members wants to sell.
Actual owner
You can always approach an owner of a business you frequent and ask if they
are thinking of selling. You never know if a person is thinking of retiring or
271
Chapter 18: Buying or Starting Your Own Business or Franchise

moving and just hasn’t taken any action yet. Yes, it’s probably a long shot,
but it could be your best bet.
Business brokers
Business brokers should be your last resort. These are people who earn com-
missions from the business owners who want to sell their businesses. They
represent the interests of the person selling a business because that’s who
pays them. They only make money when they successfully sell that business,
so you can’t depend on them for quality advice.
If you do find a business through a business broker, don’t depend on them to
help you through the process of due diligence, which is when you scour the
business and its financial statements to determine if it’s a good buy. Instead,
hire your own accountant and attorney to look over the deal.
You also may want to hire a business appraiser who can value the business
for you. You can find out more about business value appraisers and what
they offer you at the Web site of the American Society of Appraisers (www.
bvappraisers.org/).
Assessing the value of a business
Trying to set the value of a going concern (a company that has the resources
to continue to operate) can be very difficult. While setting a cash value to things
you can touch — inventory, store fixtures, equipment, and other tangible
assets — can be relatively simple, it’s much harder to put a value on intangi-
ble things (things you can’t touch), such as customer base and location.
As the new owner, you do have a customer base from which to build your
business, but remember, most small businesses are a success because of the
owner — his relationship to customers, his vision, his management skills,
and his other unique talents. This can be very difficult to duplicate.
Many times when a business changes hands, old customers disappear. Your
best bet is to put into the contract for buying the business that the selling
owner must be involved with the business during your first year of operation.
You should clearly spell out their specifics of that involvement. That’s not
unusual, and many small-business owners see their business as their child
and want it to continue to succeed even after they are gone.
Whatever you agree to with the owner, be certain that your business purchase
contract clearly states that the prior owner and management agree not to
start or buy a competing business for five years or more. This non-compete
272
Part IV: Revisiting Your Former Career or Starting Your Own Business 

clause of the contract can be by geographical area or business type depending
on the type of business, but the last thing you need is to buy a business and
find out that you’re losing customers to the old owner or his managers. You
may want to set up a consulting agreement with the prior owner and/or some
of his key managers to best protect your interests and your business’s future.
Sandy and Howie Brecher found just such an owner, who actually worked
side-by-side with them during their first year of operation. The owner ran a
similar business on the Florida coast under the same name, so he wanted to
be sure they did succeed and do well. In fact, they’ve remained friends with
the former owner and still discuss business issues even though they bought
the business four years ago.
When you’re trying to evaluate the health of the business you’re thinking of
buying, as well as its future potential, you should ask to see certain records,
which I discuss in the following sections.
Profit and loss statements and balance sheets for the past five years
Few small businesses actually do these consistently, and the business owner
may need to generate them for you based on historical financial records. It
can sometimes take a long time to get these numbers.
When you do get them, don’t just read them and accept them. You need to do
your due diligence, observe the business operations and determine if you
think the numbers are realistic based on what you are seeing. For example, if
the owner indicates that he has a $100,000 sales volume per month, but you
can’t figure out how based on the number of sales you see in a day, ask a lot
of questions.
Tax returns for the past five years
Find out what the owner has actually reported to the IRS and how that com-
pares to the financial statements he’s showing you. While it’s not surprising if
the owner shows you profit figures that are much higher than what he
reports to the IRS, be sure you understand how he got to those lower profit
figures he reported to the IRS. You may find that what he reports to the IRS is
actually more truthful than what he gave you in financial statements as you
dig into the figures.
Loan documents if you expect to assume any loans
Be sure you understand the terms and what your repayment obligations will
be. If you think you can lower the interest rates by getting a larger loan from
the Small Business Administration, you may want to add that to your loan
application.
273
Chapter 18: Buying or Starting Your Own Business or Franchise

Leases and/or building ownership
Be certain to review any lease agreements or ownership documents to find
out what your obligations and rights will be under those leases or deeds. For
example, you may find the lease runs out in two years on the store location. If
that location is important to you and the success of maintaining the business,
that could be risky.
You may want to find out if you can extend that lease prior to signing the
deal. When you open discussions with the property owner, you may find out
he intends to increase the monthly rent obligation beyond what you consider
feasible to keep the business financially viable. That could mean you’d have
to move the business soon after buying it, which can be the kiss of death to
any business.
If you don’t like the location of some of the retail stores, but do like the busi-
ness operation, it’s extremely important to find out the terms of the lease and
how long you must hold any lousy locations. A bigger problem can some-
times be a lease that gives the landlord approval over you as the purchaser.
They may have someone else in mind (maybe a son-in-law) and will disap-
prove of the purchase. Or the property owner may be looking for some type
of payment or renegotiation of the lease as the quid pro quo for agreeing to
transfer it to a new business owner. The best leases are those where the land-
lord cannot do much to impede the sale, as long as he has been given notice
and your financials and business plan are not much different from what cur-
rently exists.
If any of these problems exist, the location, which may have looked great to
you, actually may have little value.
Patents, trademarks, copyrights, and licenses
These intangible assets can be very important to the exclusivity of the busi-
ness you are thinking of buying. Find out if the owner intends to sign these
rights over to you. Also find out if any of them are running out soon.
For example, you may find that you are buying a business that owns a patent
for its key product, which protects it from competition. This patent can be
very valuable and make the business more expensive to buy. It likely also is
critical to the business’s continued success.
But, as you do your due diligence, you may find out that the patent runs out
in a year or two and you could lose your exclusive rights to the product. That
makes the patent almost worthless. You’ll likely see aggressive competition
for your business fairly quickly.
You also want to be sure that you have the rights to the continuing use of any
trademarks or product names that are unique to the business. You should
have your attorney do a search for any conflicting trademarks or names and
274
Part IV: Revisiting Your Former Career or Starting Your Own Business 

find out what has been registered. You certainly don’t want to buy a store
because of its name just to find out you have to change it in the future. You
also want to protect yourself from the owner using the name you just bought
to open a competing business.
Licenses owned by the business can be critical to its future success as well.
For example, if you’re buying a restaurant with a liquor license, you want to
be sure that license is transferable. It can take months to get a liquor license.
If your customers are used to ordering liquor with their meals and all of a
sudden can’t, you could lose a lot of customers quickly. You need to plan for
that and figure the loss in any price you offer for the business.
Legal problems
Ask to see information about any pending legal actions against the business.
This can include lawsuits that have been filed, administrative proceedings
pending with governmental agencies, or claims that have been filed against
the business.
Have your attorney review the information and figure out your potential lia-
bility. Be sure your purchase contract clearly spells out who will be responsi-
ble for what regarding any pending legal actions.
Accounting reports
Ask to see all reports from the business’s accountant. There are three types
of reports that a Certified Public Accountant can provide — compilation,
reviews, and audits. Here is what each involves:
 Compiled: Compilation reports are merely an organized look at the busi-
ness’s finances with a professional presentation of the balance sheet,
income statement, and other financial reports. The accountant has not
reviewed or audited the owner’s figures.
 Reviewed: The accountant takes a compilation one step further by ques-
tioning the employees and the owner about the numbers. While he
hasn’t done a full audit, he can certify that he or she is not aware of any
material modifications that are necessary for the information to conform
to generally accepted accounting principles.
 Audited: For these types of financial statements, the accountant actually
examines the numbers by going to the business and verifying the accu-
racy of the numbers himself. While an auditor will not actually open
every record or individually count the inventory, he will do a series of
tests on parts of the financial records to be sure they are accurate. For
example, he may review 10 to 20 percent of the customer records to see
if they accurately reflect the numbers presented in accounts receivable.
If he doesn’t find any problems with his tests, he will sign a statement
saying that the financial statements are accurate and do conform to gen-
erally accepted accounting principles.
275
Chapter 18: Buying or Starting Your Own Business or Franchise

While there is no doubt that audited financial statements are your best bet,
few small businesses actually pay for them to do done.
In addition to the financial statements, you should also ask to see a list of all
assets and a schedule of depreciation for those assets. Depreciation sched-
ules can give you a good idea of the age of the assets and how long they may
still be useful to the business. For example, if you find that most of the assets
are almost fully depreciated, it’s likely that you will be spending a lot of
money on replacing those assets or repairing them. If assets are primarily
new with a lot of value left after depreciation, your repair and replacement
costs will be significantly lower.
Title and title insurance
If the business owns any property, be sure to review the title and title insur-
ance policy. Have your attorney recheck the title for any encumbrances, such
as a lien against the title for past unpaid vendor bills. You also want to check
any ownership documents for vehicles or other major equipment owned by
the company that is being transferred to the new owner. Liens can also be
taken against major assets, so you want to be sure your attorney checks for
liens against vehicles or major equipment.
Workers’ compensation and unemployment claims
You should check with the workers’ compensation insurance carrier to find
out the claims history for the company and its current insurance rates. If many
claims have been filed, this could indicate a major problem with the business,
and it also means your future insurance rates could go up dramatically.
The same is true about unemployment claims. If the business owner fre-
quently laid people off and has a significant claims history with the state
unemployment office, you will find your payroll taxes will be higher than
other similar businesses, which can be a drain on future profits.
Employee benefits
You should review the benefits currently being offered to employees because
you likely will have a morale problem if you decide to cut those benefits as a
means of improving your profit margin. If part of your plan to improve the
profitability of the business is to cut salaries or benefits, you can expect to
have some very unhappy employees who will likely leave.
Trade secrets
You may not find that the business you are buying has many trade secrets,
but these secrets can be valuable assets, so be sure you protect them in your
contract to buy the business. For example, the most valuable trade secret for
276
Part IV: Revisiting Your Former Career or Starting Your Own Business 

any business is its customer lists. Be sure you know who has copies of these
lists and that they are protected by confidentiality agreements.
Zoning
Your lawyer should check on any special zoning arrangements that might be
in place. For example, you could find out that the store is operating under a
temporary zoning variance or conditional use permit. This could mean that
you will be severely limited on what you can do on the property. You may
have some great ideas on how to expand the business or attract new cus-
tomers, but your conditional use permit may not allow you to do what is
planned.
You also could find that the special zoning rights given the current owner will
not transfer to the new owner. For example, the current owner may have
been granted a temporary zoning variance to continue operating a business
that no longer fits the current zoning codes. Those temporary rights could be
lost when the business changes hands.
Toxic waste
If the business you are buying involves the disposal of toxic wastes, review
the records detailing how toxic waste has been handled in the past. You cer-
tainly don’t want to be stuck with the costs of cleaning up someone else’s
negligence. For example, if you buy a car repair shop, you want to know how
its owner handled the disposal of fluids taken out of cars.
Talking with the neighbors and customers
While all the legal and financial information you have gathered is very impor-
tant, don’t forget to talk with the company’s neighbors, vendors, employees,
and customers. You can get a good feel for how respected the business is and
how well it treats its customers.
A business that has a good reputation with its customers and neighboring
businesses will have a much better chance of success than one that does not
have a good reputation. While posting signs indicating the business has
changed hands may help, you are starting in a deficit position if the reputa-
tion is bad.
Listen carefully for subtle clues. Many times when you talk with suppliers,
former employees, and others who have good inside information, you will
find that they are reluctant to talk for fear of reprisal. You probably won’t get
a straight answer if there are problems, but you might be able to tell by the
tone of a person’s voice or by a clear sign of evasiveness that there is a 
problem.
277
Chapter 18: Buying or Starting Your Own Business or Franchise

Intending to buy, but . . .
If you get to the point that you’ve decided yes this is the business for me, 
but you do want to take time to investigate certain areas more deeply, such
as financial issues or legal issues, then you can sign a “Letter of Intent to
Purchase.” This will buy you some time to investigate further while securing
your rights to buy. That will give you some additional time to involve other
professionals you trust, such as your lawyer, accountant, or business advisor.
You will need to give the seller an earnest money deposit to show the seri-
ousness of your intent, but since final purchase details have not been worked
out, you should have the right to a full refund.
When you do get to the point of actually offering a sales agreement to buy the
business, this will be the key document that protects your rights. You will
likely go through several drafts of the agreement with each draft being
reviewed by your attorney and the seller’s attorney.
Don’t get impatient with what might seem like a long time to get it right.
While you may be excited that you finally found just the right business, you
don’t want to rush this most crucial step and end up with problems later.
Funding the purchase of a business
As mentioned above, buying an existing business will be a lot more expensive
than starting one from scratch, but the existing cash flow of a going concern
can be worth the difference. In the section on funding a business in “Starting
Your Own Business” above, I review the options for funding a business.
While the same options exist for buying a business, you’ll likely find the best
option is a loan guaranteed by the Small Business Administration. You can
get an idea of the types of loans possible at the SBA Web site (www.sba.gov/
financing/sbaloan/snapshot.html). Be prepared for a lot of paperwork.
Howie Brecher said his final application for an SBA loan was 100 pages long
including his business plan. He needed to submit 12 copies of the application,
which also included pictures, maps, and three five-year scenarios for the
business, one that outlined his expectations, one that outlined a five-year
plan if everything went wrong with the economy and how the business would
survive, and one that indicated what would happen if everything went great.
He also needed to develop an exit strategy.
278
Part IV: Revisiting Your Former Career or Starting Your Own Business 

Finding a Franchise
When you buy a franchise, it’s like buying a business in a box. You get all the
basics of how to set up your business and how to sell the product. The infor-
mation you get is based on lessons learned while the franchisor developed
and ran his own business.
Franchises can be a great alternative to starting your own business, espe-
cially if you don’t have a lot of business or management experience, but don’t
expect to make much money in the first few years while you build your busi-
ness, and do expect to work long hours. Well-known franchises will help you
attract customers, but buying a franchise is more like starting a new business
than buying an existing business.
What is franchising?
When you buy a franchise, you’re actually buying a business relationship
between yourself and the company that distributes a product or service
nationwide. You actually buy a limited license from the company for the right
to sell or distribute the product or service within a given area.
You will find that there are two types of franchises:
 Product distribution franchises involve an agreement between you and
the manufacturer. You are granted rights to sell the manufacturer’s prod-
uct, but cannot operate under the manufacturer’s name. Car dealerships
are an example of this type of franchise.
 Business format franchises, which are more common today, involve an
agreement where you not only get the right to sell the product or serv-
ice, but you also get an entire system for running your franchise. You do
get the right to operate your business under the national brand name.
McDonald’s or Wendy’s are examples of this type of franchise.
The person or company who sells the rights to you is called the franchisor
and you become the franchisee when you sign on the dotted line and buy the
franchise.
Business format franchise
Because business format franchises have become so popular today, the govern-
ment’s gotten involved. You do get some protections granted by the government
279
Chapter 18: Buying or Starting Your Own Business or Franchise

if you decide to buy a business format franchise. The Federal Trade Commission
requires that three key elements must exist in order for there to be a fran-
chise business relationship:
 You must be granted limited rights to use the company’s trade name,
service mark, logo, or other advertising symbol.
 You must get the rights to use systems or methods associated with oper-
ating the core business.
 You must pay the franchisor something in return for being granted these
two rights.
You can find out more about the FTC rules and recommendations you should
read before buying a franchise at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/
consumer/invest/inv07.htm.
One big advantage you can expect when deciding to buy a business format
franchise is that you will get training, marketing materials, and operating sys-
tems. You should also get a manual that spells out how to operate your busi-
ness. A good franchise package will include extensive management systems
to help make your business a success.
Don’t be naïve. You’re not getting all this solely to help you succeed. The
franchisor wants all his franchisees to run the type of business the exact
same way with the same quality of products and services. If you don’t run the
business according to his systems, your business will not match the other
franchises.
That’s a big problem for the national brand and company image. Customers
of a particular franchise brand expect products or services worldwide to be
the same no matter where they walk into the franchise.
Wouldn’t you be disappointed if you walked into a McDonald’s and ordered a
Big Mac just to find out that it didn’t taste like the hamburger you were
expecting? Now maybe you don’t even like BigMacs and would be pleasantly
surprised by a franchisee that was making a better hamburger, but if you
were a BigMac fan, you’d probably complain to the company.
Whatever brand you’re looking for, whether it’s a UPS Store, a Wendy’s, a
Cracker Barrel, or whatever franchise restaurant or store you visit regularly,
you know what you want when you walk into that business and you expect to
get it. The franchisor wants to be sure you do. That’s why a good franchisor
gives such extensive training and support to all his franchisees.
280
Part IV: Revisiting Your Former Career or Starting Your Own Business 

You should get lots of advantages if you decide to buy into a franchise system:
 You can expect national advertising that helps drive customers to your
business. If you’re considering a franchise for which you never see
advertising, you need to ask a lot of questions about how the franchisor
plans to help you promote your business. Be sure you get those
promises in writing.
 You get access to the purchasing power of a large, national operation
which should enable you to buy needed supplies at a lower price.
 You can take advantage of marketing techniques that have worked for
others in the franchise before, so you don’t have to reinvent the wheel
to get your business going.
 You get operational systems that include tools, controls, and procedures
to help make your business successful.
 You can take advantage of the national brand awareness that already
exists for the product or service you want to sell.
Product distribution franchise
If you’re buying a product distribution franchise, then the rules are different.
You’ll find these types of arrangements most commonly when setting up a
franchise in the automobile or oil industry.
For example, I’m sure you’ve noticed that most car dealerships open under
the name of the person who owns the franchise or some other name he
chooses, such as World Toyota or Frank’s Chevy’s. In these situations, the
franchise owner has bought the right to sell the specific brand of car, but
does not get an entire package to run the business. He cannot name his car
dealership General Motors or Ford Dealership. These corporations don’t
want to give the customer the impression it’s a corporate owned business.
I won’t discuss this type of franchise further because in most cases you must
have millions to buy a distributorship and get involved in product distribution
franchising. You’ll find that most of these types of franchises are sold to people
who are already running one for the manufacturer. For example, a Buick dealer
might decide to buy the rights to open a Saab dealership from General Motors.
Other common product distribution dealerships include gas stations for the
major oil companies or bottling distributorships for the major soda manufac-
turers. If you are interested in this type of franchise, then you’ll definitely
need to do a lot of additional research before pursuing this option.
281
Chapter 18: Buying or Starting Your Own Business or Franchise

Finding franchise opportunities
You’ve probably heard of the major fast-food franchises, such as McDonald’s,
Wendy’s, and Burger King, but you may not be aware that there are over 200
industry categories in which you can find a franchise today.
The primary professional association within the franchise industry is called
the International Franchise Association, which groups franchises in 18 main
categories. These categories include automotive, baked goods, building and
construction, business services, child-related businesses, education-related
businesses, fast food, healthcare, lodging, maintenance services, personnel
services, printing, real estate, restaurants, retail, service business, sports and
recreation, and travel. You can find more detail about the industries at the IFA
Web site — www.franchise.org.
Just so that you have an idea of what each of these major industry categories
include, let’s take a closer look at one of them — retail. Under retail, you will
find beauty, clothing and accessories, computer products and services,
party-related goods and services, pet-related goods and services, photo-
graphic products and services, general retail stores, and video stores. Taking
that one step further, under beauty-related you would find diet and fitness
franchises, entertainment and fashion franchises, hair care and cosmetic
franchises, tanning and skin care franchises, and vitamin franchises, just to
name a few.
You get the idea. After seeing these lists, it’s not hard to imagine how many
different types of franchises there are and how easy it will be to find one that
closely matches your skills and the type of business you might want to run.
While fast-food franchises far exceed all other types of franchise systems,
they’re not necessarily the best one for you. If you haven’t run a restaurant
before and know nothing about the restaurant business, that’s a good combi-
nation for sure failure. Take the time to find what matches you best.
The IFA is a good place to start your research about franchising in general, as
well as a good source for franchise opportunities. It’s the world’s largest
clearinghouse on franchises. If you find that the franchise you’re considering
is not a member of the IFA, tread very carefully.
Researching and finding the right franchise for you does take a lot of time.
You can shorten that a bit by working with a business broker. But, do be
aware that business brokers are primarily interested in earning their commis-
sion and may not always put your interests first. The good news is that the
broker is paid by the franchisor, so it won’t be an out-of-pocket cost for you.
282
Part IV: Revisiting Your Former Career or Starting Your Own Business 

Here are three franchise business brokers you may want to contact if you do
want help finding the right opportunity:
 FranChoice (www.franchoice.com): This is the broker recommended
by the IFA.
 FranNet (www.frannet.com): FranNet is the world’s largest network of
franchise consultants. They help you learn about your choices and find
the right one for you. FranNet has 50 offices that are individually owned
and operated.
 Entrepreneur Source (www.theesource.com): Entrepreneur Source
focuses on consulting and training to help you succeed in your own
business. They start with interviews and assessments to help you under-
stand your goals, needs, and expectations, to be able to find options
best suited for you.
If you know exactly which company you want to work with, go directly to
their Web site for details. You don’t have to use a broker to find a franchise,
but no matter what you do, you should be sure to have an attorney who
understands franchise law and can advise you throughout the process.
Key things to consider before 
signing a contract
In order to buy a franchise system, you must sign a franchise agreement that
spells out what you are buying. You could be buying just one franchise store,
or you may want the right to build several store locations.
If you do decide franchising is for you, be sure to have an attorney who is
familiar with franchise law review your contract. All offers to buy a franchise
must comply with the Federal Trade Commission standards for a Uniform
Franchise Offering Circular (UFOC), but even under the rules of the UFOC,
there are different types of franchise agreements you can be offered.
To find out more about franchising and its contracts, read Franchising For
Dummies by Michael Seid and Dave Thomas, who started Wendy’s (published
by Wiley).
Another thing to consider is location. You may want to buy the rights to own
and run all the stores within a particular geographic area, but unless you plan
to work more than a full-time job in retirement, you certainly don’t want to
get too big.
283
Chapter 18: Buying or Starting Your Own Business or Franchise

Contracts are set up in four different structures — single-unit franchises, mul-
tiple single-unit franchises, area-development franchises, and master fran-
chises. Each of these structures involves a different type of agreement. The
following sections give you the basics of each type of structure.
Single-unit franchise
If you just want to own and operate one store or franchise unit, then you
would sign an agreement for a single-unit franchise. This is the simplest form
of franchise ownership.
You don’t even have to be thinking of operating out of a storefront. You can
do it from your home. For example, service franchises, such as carpet-
cleaning franchises or house-cleaning franchises, frequently are from the
franchisee’s home. Your customers will find you through advertising in the
telephone book, in local newspapers or community newsletters, on bulletin
boards, or even by radio, depending on how you decide to advertise your
business.
Multiple single-unit franchises
If you’re successful and the franchise bug bites you, you may want to buy
more than one franchise unit from the same franchisor. It’s not unusual for a
franchisee whose first unit proves profitable to sign a second agreement with
the same franchisor for another location. This would be called a multiple
single-unit franchise agreement.
Since you’re already familiar with the operation and the people involved, you
can get that second or maybe third unit up and running much more quickly.
Both you and the franchisor benefit from quicker start-up with less initial
costs and time for training. You may even help a fellow retiree get started by
buying a second or third franchise location as partners.
Area development franchises
If you’re really successful and want to build more than one unit at a time, you
might think about an area development franchise. This gives you the right to
all franchises in a particular geographic area. You can protect yourself from
some invading your territory.
With this type of agreement, you would need to sign both an area develop-
ment franchise agreement, as well as single-unit development agreements for
each franchise you open. The area development agreement specifies develop-
ment rights, but the unit development agreement governs the terms for how
each unit will be run and the franchise fees for the unit.
284
Part IV: Revisiting Your Former Career or Starting Your Own Business 

Master franchises
If you’re ready to really build something big, you can go for the highest level
franchisee by signing a master franchise agreement. This not only gives you
the right to develop a certain number of units within a geographic area, you
also get the right to offer and sell the franchise to other franchisees. You
essentially become franchisor for some of the units you sell.
The master franchise agreement is similar to the area development agree-
ment, where you get the rights to develop a set number of franchises in a par-
ticular geographic area within a set time period. With this type of agreement,
you don’t have to develop all those units yourself. You can find others to
develop most of the individual units.
Your agreement will likely require you to open and operate at least the first
single unit yourself and will likely require that you open and operate at least
two units. Once you have those two up and running, you can begin selling the
rights to additional locations in your area to other franchisees, who will be
called your sub-franchisees.
A master franchise could be a good idea if you and a bunch of other retirees
would like to operate similar businesses in the same area, but you probably
will need to find retirees who want to live outside the U.S. You probably won’t
find many master franchise agreements available in the United States. Most
franchisors in the U.S. today prefer to have a direct relationship with each of
their franchisees.
But, U.S. franchisors who want to expand outside the states do prefer to offer
master franchise agreements in other countries to just one individual or com-
pany. Franchisors realize that cultural, political, and economic differences make
it critical to have one point person who can lead their franchise unit develop-
ment who has significant experience developing businesses in that country.
So if you’ve lived and worked for a long time in another country for your
former corporation and think there is potential for a franchise system there
that doesn’t currently exist, a franchise could be your best opportunity for
developing an international business operation.
Funding requirements
You can find franchise opportunities that will let you get started with just
$20,000 to $30,000, but they won’t be well-known names. If you want to buy
into a well-established franchise, expect to need at least $100,000 in cash.
285
Chapter 18: Buying or Starting Your Own Business or Franchise

Just to give you an idea of what a business run out of the home might cost in
initial investment, I pulled the information from a successful cleaning service
franchise, Maid Brigade. Table 18-1 shows what Maid Brigade estimates in
start-up costs.
Table 18-1
Maid Brigade Estimated Start-up Costs
Expense Item
Cost Range
Initial Franchise Fee
$29,500 to $58,500
Opening Inventory
$5,000 to $7,500
Advertising/Marketing Budget
$50,000 to $80,000
Working Capital
$20,000 to $31,000
Total Initial Investment
$104,500 to $177,000
If you wanted to set up the same kind of business without the Maid Brigade
name, you could save the $29,500 to $58,500, but you would not get the bene-
fit of the national name brand. You also would not have access to their train-
ing and operations manual. That’s the biggest advantage that purchasing a
franchise offers you — a business in a box.

You may not want to go back to work, but you also
don’t enjoy the retirement lifestyle. In this part, I
explore opportunities you may want to consider other
than getting back to the working grind. I explore both 
traditional educational opportunities, such as going back

any seniors decide that the best west to stay young in retirement is to
learn something new. Colleges and universities throughout the world
are designing educational opportunities for retirees. Some are designed to
earn a degree, but many are just short-term learning opportunities.
You may want to just expand your horizons and learn something new, 
but you also may want to retrain for another career. In this chapter, I intro-
duce you to myriad learning opportunities around the world for retirees. And
if those don’t fit the bill, I give you some pointers on how to start your own
learning experience or even become a teacher yourself.
Your opportunities for learning are limited only by your imagination. With all
the resources available on the Internet today, you can find just about any-
thing that interests you. If you’re not sure how to make use of the Internet, I
recommend that you start by taking a course through a SeniorNet Learning
Center (see the section, “SeniorNet,” later in this chapter). Or if one is not
near you, contact your local community college (see the section, “Local com-
munity colleges”) and see if it offers basic computing courses.

Popular Senior Learning Opportunities
As a retiree, now that you have much more control over your schedule, you
can easily decide to take off for several weeks or several months to pursue
something you’ve wanted to learn more about for a long time. Many colleges
around the world have recognized that adult learners, especially those who
have retired, can be an excellent source of new students.
In this section, I discuss some of the top programs that are being offered
specifically for people over 50. I also give you some tips on how to find pro-
grams close to your home.
Elderhostel
People 55 and over have been enjoying programs run by Elderhostel
(www.elderhostel.org), a nonprofit organization, for more than 30 years.
Today, Elderhostel runs educational programs for adults 55 and older in all 50
U.S. states as well as in 90 countries around the world.
More than 150,000 people sign up for the 8,000 educational trips run by
Elderhostel each year. Many of the trips are run in conjunction with an area
college or university, so they include both a lecture series and touring.
Programs run by Elderhostel are all-inclusive. That means they include meals,
lectures, field trips, cultural excursions, tips, and medical and travel insur-
ance coverage. Air fare is priced into many of the trips overseas as well.
Trips vary greatly in length. They can be a one-day discovery trip in a partic-
ular city or a short five-day adventure, such as a visit to three barrier islands
off the coast of Georgia (St. Simons, Sapelo, and Jekyll) to learn more about
the culture in the area and explore the islands, run in conjunction with
Georgia Southwestern State University. These trips cost under $500 per
person and include hotel, 15 meals, and tours of the three islands, in addition
to lectures. Two- to three-week trips are available too.
If you want to travel outside the U.S., Elderhostel also runs programs that
include travel to Africa, Asia, Australia, Canada, Europe, and the Americas.
You’ll find programs offered by Elderhostel in these seven areas:
 Active outdoor: Participants explore the wonders of the natural world.
These programs can include hiking in the Grand Canyon or exploring
central France by barge. You will exercise both the body and mind, but
you do need to be able to participate in extensive physical activity.
290
Part V: Knowledge to Philanthropy: Opportunities to Broaden the Mind 

Active outdoor trips are fast paced and include strenuous physical 
challenges.
 Discover: Participants explore the landscape and cultures of both the
U.S. and Canada. You could tour the national parks or explore a cos-
mopolitan city with an expert leading the group.
 Individual skills: These programs focus on giving you the opportunity
to learn a new skill, such as Southwestern cooking, watercolor, yoga, or
pottery making. These courses are led by experienced craftspeople and
expert guides.
 Intergenerational: Travel with a grandchild or other younger relative or
friend to explore something that interests you. These trips include inter-
active lectures and field trips run to offer experiences that can bridge
generational differences.
 Liberal arts: Participants explore topics of interest in university settings
around the U.S. You can take a course in Shakespeare, analyze Freud, or
study classic opera. Programs include lectures by distinguished univer-
sity faculty, backstage ventures with theater professionals, as well as
discussions with historians, authors, diplomats, and philosophers.
 Service learning: These programs give participants an opportunity to
make a difference in a community, an ecosystem, or the life of an individ-
ual. You could tutor children or help restore a forest habitat for wildlife.
Or you might sign up to assist with artifact restoration or assist with
museum curatorial work.
 Adventures afloat programs: Participants explore and learn history
from the deck of various types of floating classrooms, such as yachts,
barges, and cruise ships.
Elderhostel programs tend to attract people primarily between the ages of 
65 and 75. A similar program for younger folks, between the ages of 50 and 60,
called Road Scholar (www.roadscholar.org) is being developed by the
Elderhostel organization. This program is a bit more upscale and less struc-
tured than the Elderhostel programs.
TraveLearn
A leading educational tour operator whose clientele are primarily people 
50 and over is TraveLearn (www.travelearn.com), which has been putting
together educational tours for more than 25 years. You’ll find land tours,
land/cruise tours, and cruise-only tours to places such as, Alaska, Antarctica,
China, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Ireland, and Morocco.
291
Chapter 19: Going Back to College: Expanding Your Knowledge and Skills

TraveLearn trips use more luxury accommodations than you’ll find on
Elderhostel tours. Groups can be as small as eight travelers and never more
than 20. All trip leaders are experts in the area in which they are leading a
trip. You can sign up for a free travel newsletter on TraveLearn’s Web site to
keep up-to-date on the trips available.
Osher Lifelong Learning Institute (OLLI)
If you are lucky enough to live in the San Francisco area or can visit there for
an extended period of time, you may want to consider attending a session of
the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute (http://www.cel.sfsu.edu/olli/)
run by San Francisco State University.
These programs are run primarily for people who want to learn about a topic,
but don’t want the pressures normally associated with a college course. You
won’t be assigned extensive homework, even though occasionally there is
some. You also won’t get grades or receive credit for the classes.
Here’s a sampling of the types of coursework you’ll find in the program:
 Artmaking and storytelling: Students explore and experiment with their
imagination through photography, creative writing, and storytelling, par-
ticularly memoir writing.
 Urban curriculum: Students examine the economic, social, cultural, and
political forces that shape the San Francisco area.
 Redefining aging: Students explore issues involving personal and pro-
fessional choices as they age. Discussions include entrepreneurship,
investing, spirituality, and interior design.
 International affairs and current events: Students analyze global
events and their impact on the San Francisco area. Topics include global
climate change, schools, Mexico, Islam and the West, and globalization.
 Technology and the future: Students are introduced to new software
and other technologies as part of a project-based course. Topics include
digital photography and Photoshop, as well as an introduction to the
Internet and e-mail basics.
The Institute also runs an Artist-in-Residence program where students can
work with top artists in various fields. One continuing project that was started
under this program is the Geezer Theater, where aspiring writers and actors
work with the Artists-in-Residence and write and perform original theater
performances.

You may be able to find similar adult learning programs near you. Check with
your state university system. Many offer senior adult learning programs that
might be just what you are looking to find.
SeniorNet
If you want to learn more about how to use your computer, visit the Web site
SeniorNet (www.seniornet.org). This nonprofit organization, which was
founded in 1986, provides adults aged 50 and older with computer instruc-
tion so they can use the computer to enhance their lives and share their
wisdom and knowledge.
More than 240 learning centers are supported by SeniorNet throughout the U.S.,
as well as in Sweden, Malaysia, and Japan. You can locate the one nearest you
on its Web site at http://www.seniornet.org/php/lclist.php.
Even if you don’t live near one of the learning centers, you can benefit from
newsletters published by the organization, as well as from discounts on 
computer-related products and services.
SeniorNet also sponsors an active online community with hundreds of dis-
cussion topics called the SeniorNet RoundTables (http://discussions.
seniornet.org). Computers are not the only thing discussed. You’ll also
find discussion topics including
 Arts and entertainment
 Books and literature
 Civic and social issues
 Crafts and collectibles
 Culinary arts
 Culture
 Financial topics and legal issues
 Gardening
 Genealogy
 Health
 Religion and spirituality
 Retirement living

Chapter 19: Going Back to College: Expanding Your Knowledge and Skills

 Volunteerism, activism, and philanthropy
 Working seniors and careers
 Writing, language, and word play
When it comes to leaning more about your computer, you can get help from
SeniorNet members to learn how to touch up your digital photography, send
and receive e-mail, desktop publishing, manage personal and financial
records, and communicate with people around the world. You’ll even find
help on how to write your own autobiography.
SeniorNet grew out of a research project originally funded by the Markle
Foundation in 1986. Today it’s an international, nonprofit organization based
in Santa Clara, California. Funding for SeniorNet comes from membership
dues ($40 a year), Learning Center fees, and individual donations. SeniorNet
also receives donations from companies and foundations.
Membership in SeniorNet makes you eligible for computer training at its learn-
ing centers where the adult technology curriculum is run by other senior
members. You can also get free computer and Internet access at the learning
center computer labs and access to advanced equipment including scanners,
printers, and digital cameras. Members also get a free subscription to the
monthly e-newsletter and discounts on computer software and hardware.
Local community colleges
If you want to learn close to home, one of the best places to check out is your
local community college. Many community colleges offer adult learning
classes that include computer basics, financial management, and other
lifestyle classes.
Or you may be interested in getting training for a career change to a new
field, if you think you might want to go back to work. You can earn an associ-
ates degree or get the coursework you need for a professional certification.
Learning online
Many universities also offer online courses that you can take from your home
computer. You can research what’s available and find out more about each
school’s program at the Guide to Online Schools (www.guidetoonline
schools.com).
294
Part V: Knowledge to Philanthropy: Opportunities to Broaden the Mind 

The Guide to Online schools provides a directory of over 2,500 online degree
programs that include accredited online colleges, online universities, and dis-
tance learning programs. You can earn an associate’s degree, bachelor’s
degree, master’s degree, or a PhD.
You’ll find coursework in business, counseling, criminal justice, design, edu-
cation, engineering, healthcare, human services, nursing, paralegal, psychol-
ogy, religion, and technology. Some schools offer classes that a partially done
online and partially in a live classroom.
Learning Abroad
You may decide that you’d like to learn abroad. Senior studies programs are
available at overseas colleges and universities as well. I review some of the
best programs you might be interested in exploring.
University of Strathclyde’s 
Senior Studies Institute
The University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, Scotland, hosts the Senior Studies
Institute through its Centre for Lifelong Learning (www.cll.strath.ac.uk/
ssi.html). The university established the institute in 1991 to offer older
people a place they could go for lifelong learning. Today, more than 3,000 stu-
dents participate in coursework each year. The university offers three pri-
mary types of learning opportunities:
 Lifelong learning encourages continuing personal growth and intellec-
tual stimulation through daytime classes, seminars, and other learning
opportunities.
 Useful learning courses provide older people with an opportunity to
learn life skills, which they can then use to help in their community as
volunteers or entrepreneurs.
 Widening access gives students access to other university courses and
offers opportunities to work within the community.
If you don’t want to learn in Scotland, but would like to improve your writ-
ing skills, you might be interested in Strathclyde’s Online Creative Writing
Classes called BLAZE (www.cll.strath.ac.uk/ssi/classlists/
writing.htm).

Chapter 19: Going Back to College: Expanding Your Knowledge and Skills

Adult Residential Colleges 
Association (ARCA)
You can join more than 150,000 adults each year who take short-term residen-
tial coursework at one of the small residential colleges in England or Wales
through a collaborative program called the Adult Residential Colleges
Association (http://www.arca.uk.net).
Courses focus on helping you learn throughout life for personal satisfaction.
You can attend courses that are run over a weekend, during the week, or as
summer schools. Most of these courses are offered for the enjoyment of
learning and you don’t need to meet academic requirements to enroll.
Often these colleges are in historic houses set in the countryside.
Accommodations vary greatly. You may stay in a small comfortable room or a
grand suite depending on what is available near the school you choose.
Archaeology Abroad
If you think you might like to travel and do a bit of digging at the same time,
the University of London publishes Archaeology Abroad, which is a guide to
fieldwork opportunities outside the United Kingdom. The guide provides
information on hundreds of archeological fieldwork opportunities around the
world.
You can get an annual subscription to the guide for $65 by subscribing online
at http://www.britarch.ac.uk/archabroad/subscribe.html.
Using information found in the guide, you can sign up for a few weeks or a
few months depending on the project. You can also get information about
Fieldwork Awards that help Archaeology Abroad subscribers with their exca-
vation expenses, including travel costs and participation, regardless of your
age, nationality, or level of fieldwork experience.
You’ll find projects that accept participants with little or no previous archae-
ological training or experience. The university does recommend that you do
learn some basic archaeological techniques before venturing abroad.
Before joining a project, keep the following in mind:
 You will find that conditions do vary considerably from site to site, so be
sure to check out your living conditions before accepting a fieldwork
assignment or traveling. Accommodations can be quite rustic and may
just be tents or involve shared rooms and facilities.
296
Part V: Knowledge to Philanthropy: Opportunities to Broaden the Mind 

 You may be expected to share shopping and cooking as well. Sometimes
there will be a location where all field workers meet before traveling to
the site. Other times you may need to find your own way to the excava-
tion site.
 Costs will vary greatly depending on the sponsor of the dig and how it’s
funded. The sponsor may have been able to raise money from a sponsor-
ing institution or government entity to help defray costs.
 If you’ve never done archaeological fieldwork and would like to take a
training course through a field school, you will find that there are signifi-
cant fees, but many times those fees include food, accommodations,
tuition, and field trips. The guide includes information about field
schools as well.
 You do need to be physically fit in order to participate in archeological
field work. This type of work usually involves strenuous physical labor.
You should ask your doctor for at least an anti-tetanus vaccination
before leaving, if you haven’t had one in the last ten years.
 In addition, you may need other vaccinations depending on where you
are traveling. You can find out if there are any travel alerts for a particu-
lar location at the U.S. State Department Web site (http://travel.
state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis_pa_tw_1168.html). You
should also be sure to have your own health and travel insurance in
case of personal injury or transportation cancellation.
Adult cultural program — France
You can learn more about French culture in two- to four-week programs
where you live and study in the medieval city of Montpellier, which has one
of one of the oldest universities in Europe. The program is part of the Institut
Méditerranéen de Langues (http://www.iml.fr).
While you enjoy the French Mediterranean, you’ll take coursework with other
retirees on topics such as French civilization and culture, French cooking,
and wine and cheese tasting. You’ll also travel to area towns as part of the
program.
Specialists in history, sociology, French southern civilization, and politics will
teach as part of the program. You also have the option to do volunteer work,
which can be an excellent way to interact with the local people and learn
more about French culture.
297
Chapter 19: Going Back to College: Expanding Your Knowledge and Skills

Taking art in Italy
Would you like to live and work in the Italian mountains as you seek to
improve your fine-arts skills in drawing, painting, collage, mask making, digi-
tal photography, fresco, or clay sculpture? The Abruzzi Mountain Art Workshop
offers fine-arts classes in a rustic mountain village that is about an hour 
from Rome.
You can learn more about the classes at www.artworkshopitaly.com. You
can also choose to work at 12th-century sites or abandoned abbeys. Indepen-
dent studio space is also available.
A weeklong workshop includes seven nights of hotel accommodations, five
hours of instruction each day, daily excursions to islands and coastal sites,
daily lunch or dinner, and all materials and supplies. Also, your work will be
critiqued daily as part of the workshop.
Learning a language
If you’d like to learn a new language and travel at the same time, check out
the directory provided by AmeriSpan (http://www.amerispan.com/
language_schools/). You’ll find course availability for learning 20 different
languages.
AmeriSpan can help you find courses in Argentina, Austria, Bolivia, Brazil,
Canada, Chile, China, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt,
Greece, Guatemala, Honduras, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Morocco, Panama,
Peru, Poland, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Russia, Spain, Switzerland, Thailand,
Uruguay, and Venezuela. Some courses even combine learning a language
with cooking, wine-tasting, sailing, golfing, and dancing.
You may want to avoid taking courses in June, July, and August, which is
when they are filled with college-age students. The times you’ll find the most
retirees in classes are from February through April or September through
December.
Becoming a Teacher Yourself
You may like to become a teacher yourself, but you never took any teacher
certification courses. The National Association for Alternative Certification
298
Part V: Knowledge to Philanthropy: Opportunities to Broaden the Mind 

works with a number of states to help them develop alternative certifica-
tion programs. You can find a list of current programs at http://www.
alt-teachercert.org/program_sites.htm.
Each state has its own set of rules and requirements. You will find a link to
the state’s alternative certification Web site at the link above.
In order to qualify for one of these programs, you must have a bachelor’s
degree or be a paraprofessional with at least 60 hours or more of college
credit. If you want to teach math, science, or special needs children, you’ll be
in demand in most states because that is the type of teachers sought most
often. High school teachers also are in high demand in many states.
If you do qualify, the state programs often pay tuition assistance, provide
training, give financial incentives, and provide mentor support. Many states
get federal funding for programs that help people transition to teaching.
To give you an idea of what is entailed to get an alternative certification, I
looked at Florida’s program, which includes the following components:
 Survival training: Candidates are first given an initial period of prepara-
tion before assuming responsibility in the classroom.
 Support team: A support team is in place to coordinate and support the
professional development of each new teacher.
 Peer mentor: Each new teacher is assigned a peer mentor, who provides
face-to-face feedback and assists the new teacher throughout the learn-
ing experience.
 Online tutor: Teachers have access guidance, feedback, and assessment
of work products that are developed as part of the program’s learning
activities.
 Online professional preparation learning activities: Learning activities
are provided in-depth online to give each new teacher training in the
Florida Educator Accomplished Practices. Topics covered include
assessment, communication, critical thinking, diversity, ethics, human
development and learning, knowledge of subject matter, learning envi-
ronments, planning, role of the teacher, and technology.
 Database tracking system: This system is used to document the
progress of each teacher as various tasks are completed that demon-
strate the new teacher has learned the Florida Educator Accomplished
Practices.
 Professional education test: This test is administered at the end of the
program to demonstrate attained knowledge.
299
Chapter 19: Going Back to College: Expanding Your Knowledge and Skills

After successfully completing this alternative certification process, you can
be certified to teach in Florida. Each state does design its own program, but
the basic design is similar.
Starting Your Own Learning Group
You may decide that none of these opportunities are right for you. You can
always start your own learning opportunity that you design based on your
own learning priorities.
You may enjoy starting your own book club with people who enjoy reading
the same genre of books that you do. Or you may want to set up group tours
designed to meet your specific needs. Another idea might be to start an
investment club where you can share ideas for how to manage your retire-
ment portfolio.
Forming a book club
One common learning opportunity you’ll find in many senior centers or
active adult retirement communities is a book club. If you don’t know of one
in your community, check with your local library.
Many libraries do offer meeting places for book clubs. Your local librarian
can probably point you in the right direction for a book club near you or pos-
sibly help you start one if there are none in your area.
If you do decide to start a new one from scratch, you can find some excellent
resources at Book-Club-Resources.com (www.book-clubs-resource.com).
Here are the basic tasks you need to think about to start your own club:
 Plan your size and where you’ll meet: Before you can even start
recruiting members, you need to determine the size of your book club
and where you’ll meet. Size will be very dependent on where you decide
to meet because if you decide to host meetings in your home, you must
figure out how many people you can invite to comfortably meet in your
home. If you don’t have enough space, talk with your library or commu-
nity center to see if it is possible to use a room there.
 Recruit Members: You could start by recruiting friends, but if you don’t
find enough members that way, you can post flyers at your local library.
300
Part V: Knowledge to Philanthropy: Opportunities to Broaden the Mind 

Book clubs are a great way to make new friends who share similar 
interests.
 Set guidelines: At your first meeting, you should start to draft guide-
lines. Items can include how often you want to meet, how many books
you plan to discuss during each meeting, and how you will decide which
books you want to read. It’s a good idea to pick one consistent time and
place to meet. People tend to forget about a meeting if it doesn’t become
part of a routine schedule. For example, you could decide to meet at 
11 a.m. on the first Tuesday of the month.
 Find a discussion leader: You can decide to hire a professional leader to
moderate your book club meetings or you can lead them yourself. If you
do want to hire a professional leader, contact your library or a local
community college for suggestions. If you decide to lead the discussion
yourself, you can take advantage of the reading group guides you can
find online (www.book-clubs-resource.com/guides) to make your
task easier.
Putting together a travel group
Traveling with friends is always fun. You can put together your own travel
group. Your group can either decide to go together on one of the organized
trips I talked about above or you can work with a travel agent to put together
a trip that better meets your needs.
If you do decide to organize trips yourself, find a good travel agent whom you
can count on to help with the logistics. Setting up a trip takes a lot of effort
and knowledge, and unless you’ve done this before, don’t try to do this all by
yourself.
Starting an investment club
Investment clubs can be an excellent way to share information about manag-
ing your retirement portfolio and researching investment opportunities.
BetterInvesting of The National Association of Investors Corporation (NAIC)
provides you with excellent materials about how to start your own club at
http://www.betterinvesting.org/clubsandchapters/.
You may want to start by finding an existing club near you before trying to
start your own. If you do prefer to join an existing club, you can use
301
Chapter 19: Going Back to College: Expanding Your Knowledge and Skills

BetterInvesting’s search tool to find a club near you at http://www.better
investing.org/clubs/findaclub.html.
BetterInvesting is an independent, nonprofit organization that is dedicated to
teaching individuals how to become successful, strategic, long-term investors.
You won’t find stock recommendations on the Web site and there are no com-
missions or fees from your investing activities.

Volunteering in the Business and
Community World
In This Chapter
 Reviewing your volunteer skills
 Finding opportunities in businesses
 Searching for opportunities in communities
 Volunteering internationally
 Becoming a virtual volunteer
I
f you don’t need to make money, but you want to continue using the skills
you’ve learned throughout your life, you can take advantage of the numer-
ous opportunities to volunteer.
You can decide to stay in the business world and help small-business people
in trouble. Or you can decide to give back to your community instead and
take on leadership or other volunteer roles in community organizations.
In this chapter, I review the volunteer opportunities in both the business and
community world.
Understanding That You Have 
Something to Offer
You — and all retirees — have experience and knowledge you’ve built over
the years that you can offer to someone else, if you want to offer the time.
After spending a few months doing all the things around the house you
wanted to get done, you probably have a lot of untapped energy.

You also may find that you want to do something more creative than playing
golf or cards all day or hanging out at the pool. You have a lot of creativity
left in you, but you’re not sure what to do with it. You don’t want to go back
into the workforce, but you do want to give back to your community.
You can do that in many different ways. If you’ve been a business person
your entire life and just love the challenge of helping another business get on
its feet, your may want to work as a small-business volunteer.
If you’re tired of business or never worked for a business at all, there are
many volunteer opportunities from which to choose. First, I review possible
business volunteer opportunities, then I explore community volunteer spots,
and finally I look at ways you can both volunteer and travel worldwide.
Being a Volunteer in the Business World
Many small businesses need help to get off the ground or to fix an internal
problem. You can go through two key organizations if that’s the way you want
to volunteer your time — SCORE and Volunteers in Medical Clinics. If you
prefer working with small-business start-ups, you may want to volunteer at a
small-business incubator. I explore all of these options in the sections that
follow.
SCORE
SCORE (www.score.org), which uses the tagline “Counselors to America’s
Small Business,” is by far America’s premier source of free and confidential
small-business advice for entrepreneurs. Since being formed in 1964, SCORE
has helped over 7.5 million small-business owners by providing counseling,
training, and advice on a volunteer basis.
Today, SCORE has over 375 chapter offices nationwide. You can also find
helpful “how-to” articles and business templates on its Web site. If you join
SCORE, you can become part of a network of over 10,500 volunteers. SCORE
volunteers share their business acumen and lessons they’ve learned over the
years in business. SCORE volunteers are working and retired business
owners, executives, and corporate leaders.
As a SCORE volunteer, you serve as a resource partner with the U.S. Small
Business Administration to assist small-business owners seeking help. Depend-
ing on your expertise, you could help a small-business owner develop a 
business plan, improve his marketing, increase his cash flow, or any number
of other critical aspects needed to keep a business alive.
304
Part V: Knowledge to Philanthropy: Opportunities to Broaden the Mind 

You can decide to offer business advice online. Over 1,400 SCORE counselors
respond to e-mail requests for help. Or, you can decide you prefer to do face-
to-face counseling. That is done through one of SCORE’s local chapter offices.
For more information about being a volunteer, go to http://www.score.
org/volunteer.html.
Volunteers in Medicine clinics
Retired physicians, nurses, dentists, social workers, pharmacists, and others
who worked in the medical field may find volunteering in a Volunteers in
Medicine (VIM; http://www.vimi.org/volunteer.shtml) clinic very
satisfying. VIM clinics serve in areas where healthcare is most needed.
The first VIM clinic was formed in 1993 at a time when Hilton Head had no
access to healthcare. A free health clinic was started that uses retired health-
care professionals in the area. Almost immediately, the clinic had 55 physi-
cians, 64 nurses, and 15 dentists who volunteered to give some time.
In 2005, more than 160,000 retired physicians, 350,000 nurses, and 40,000 den-
tists volunteer time to one of the VIM clinics nationwide. Many of the retired
healthcare workers that become involved in VIM not only want to practice,
they find they need to practice. They find serving this community in this way
is therapeutic.
Patients served by the VIM clinics are people surviving on limited resources.
Today, thanks to the VIM clinic, every person who lives or works on Hilton
Head Island has easy access to healthcare. You can find out more about the
VIM clinic on Hilton Head at www.vimclinic.org. Clinics similar to that 
one now operate in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana,
Massachusetts, Missouri, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsyl-
vania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming.
The amount of time you decide to give to a clinic is up to you. VIM does rec-
ommend that retired physicians volunteer at least a half-day per week. Some
volunteers actually choose to work every day. Continuing education is pro-
vided to all professionals who decide to volunteer for VIM.
Small-business incubators
If you enjoy working with entrepreneurs and don’t want to work with SCORE,
you may also find your talents needed at a small-business incubator.
Many business owners don’t have the space or desire to start their business
out of their homes, but they can’t afford renting space or the essential support
305
Chapter 20: Volunteering in the Business and Community World

function. Instead, they turn to small-business incubators, which are usually
affiliated with a university or college in the area.
At small-business incubators, business owners get help from business students
as well as from retired business people who volunteer their time. Business
incubators are designed specifically to help start-up firms, and provide
 Flexible space and leases often at very low rates
 Fee-based business support services, such as telephone answering,
bookkeeping, secretarial, fax and copy machine access, libraries, and
meeting rooms
 Group rates for health, life, and other insurance plans
 Business and technical assistance either on-site or through a community
referral system
 Assistance in obtaining funding for the business
 Networking with other entrepreneurs
If working with business start-ups is a better fit for you, then you may want to
check with your local college or university to see if they know of one in the area.
You can find a listing of small-business incubators throughout the U.S. and
the world at Small Business Notes (http://www.smallbusinessnotes.
com/incubation.html).
Helping Out in Your Community
Options for volunteering in your community are extensive. In this section, I
focus on the organizations that seek retirees, but in reality you can find many
other opportunities through local religious groups, the United Way, and other
local service organizations. Essentially any task that you think you would like
to consider volunteering to do, you will likely find a way to do it.
Executive Service Corps Affiliate Network
The Executive Service Corps Affiliate Network (ESCAN; www.escus.org),
which is a nationwide network of 34 nonprofit consulting groups, provides a
variety of high-quality, affordable services to nonprofit organizations,
schools, and government agencies.
Volunteer consultants, who have had senior-level positions in business, gov-
ernment, and nonprofits, provide most of the services. Their goal is to help
306
Part V: Knowledge to Philanthropy: Opportunities to Broaden the Mind 

strengthen the management of nonprofit agencies so that they can more
effectively perform their missions.
The areas in which volunteer consultants provide services include strategic
planning, coaching and mentoring, financial management, marketing and
public relations, merger support, business plan development, board gover-
nance, leadership development, facility management, fundraising, human
resources, information systems, cost reduction, income generation, endow-
ment planning, and organizational assessments.
To find out more about how you can become affiliated with Executive Service
Corps, go to http://www.escus.org/where.html and contact the affili-
ate office nearest you.
AARP
AARP offers many different ways you can volunteer your time. You can find
articles and information about how to volunteer at http://www.aarp.org/
about_aarp/community_service. AARP’s founder, Dr. Ethel Percy Andrus,
believed it was important “to serve, not to be served.” Her vision helped
shape AARP’s volunteer programs at the national, state, and local levels.
Today, you’ll find a wide variety of community events that inform, protect,
and empower adults age 50-plus on a range of important issues. AARP volun-
teers and staff work together to enhance the quality of life for everyone as
they age by achieving positive social change through information, advocacy,
and service.
Consider volunteering in one of the AARP programs I discuss in the following
sections.
AARP Day of Service
Each year AARP designates a Day of Service (check for this year’s date by
checking out www.aarp.org/about_aarp/community_service). AARP
encourages its members to consider devoting the day to volunteer service
with an organization of their choosing. If you don’t want to work for an orga-
nization, AARP recommends that you spend the day helping your elderly or
handicapped neighbors with errands, household chores, and other basic
tasks.
AARP Benefits Outreach Program: Low-income help
AARP volunteers help older people with low or moderate incomes find public
and private benefit programs for which they may be eligible to help pay for
307
Chapter 20: Volunteering in the Business and Community World

prescription drugs, groceries, doctor bills, heating bills, property taxes, 
and more.
About 5,000 low-income older persons get the benefits they need to strengthen
their financial security with the help of AARP volunteers. To find out if this
program is available in your community, e-mail bopvolunteer@aarp.org.
AARP chapters
AARP chapters, which total more than 2,400 in the U.S., Puerto Rico, and the
Virgin Islands, are the core of AARP’s volunteer efforts nationwide by foster-
ing community volunteerism and fellowship, and offering a range of service
programming that includes mentoring activities, food and clothing drives,
friendly visits, and much more.
Chapters also lend direct support to AARP State Office advocacy and legisla-
tive efforts, and often combine forces with groups like Habitat for Humanity
and Meals on Wheels, to make life better in communities where AARP families
live and work.
You can find out more information about AARP chapter activities in your state
or area by contacting AARP Community Networks at 601 E St. NW, Washington,
DC 20049. You can also contact this group by e-mail at chapters@aarp.org,
or call its toll-free number: 1-888-OUR-AARP (1-888-687-2277).
AARP Driver Safety Program
If you’d like to teach driver safety, you can join a network of 10,000 volun-
teers who help older drivers learn ways to avoid a collision and cause
injuries to themselves and others. This eight-hour classroom refresher
course is designed especially for drivers age 50 and older, but there’s no age
requirement.
Topics include the normal changes in vision, hearing, and reaction time and
discussions center around practical techniques to compensate for these
changes. In 2005, there were about 630,000 course graduates.
In a majority of states, people who take these courses benefit from dis-
counted auto insurance. This program is available nationwide and is taught
in many convenient locations. An online version of the AARP Driver Safety
Program refresher course is available online at http://www.aarp.org/
drive. You can call 888-227-7669 for more information.
AARP Money Management Program
If you enjoy helping others with daily money management assistance, you
may want to volunteer for AARP’s Money Management Program. Volunteers
help older or disabled people who have difficulty budgeting, paying bills, and
308
Part V: Knowledge to Philanthropy: Opportunities to Broaden the Mind 

keeping track of their finances, but have no family or friends able to help
them out.
The program works with state and local community service agencies to help
people maintain their financial independence, to remain in their homes, and
to provide an added level of protection against financial exploitation. You can
find out more information about this program at www.aarpmmp.org or call
toll free (1-888-687-2277).
NRTA: AARP’s Educator Community
If you’d prefer working with children, you may enjoy volunteering with your
local retired educators’ associations through the NRTA’s With Our Youth!
Program.
Volunteers work with children and the broader community through tutoring,
providing school supplies and books, and helping to run food and clothing
drives. Also, retired educators can help new teachers and administrators by
assisting them using their years of experience and knowledge. You can find
out more about the program by writing to NRTA, 601 E Street NW,
Washington, DC 20049.
AARP Tax-Aide
Are you one of those rare people that enjoy helping others prepare their tax
returns? AARP Tax-Aide volunteers provide free tax preparation services to
millions of low- and moderate-income taxpayers, with special attention to
those age 60 and older. Electronic filing and online counseling are also offered
by the program.
AARP has offered this service for 36 years and now has over 32,000 volun-
teers. In 2006, it served about 1.9 million taxpayers at 8,500 sites. Program
volunteers also answer tax-related questions year-round online. If you’d like
to volunteer for this program, you can find out more information about it at
www.aarp.org/taxaide or you can e-mail taxaide@aarp.org. You can
also reach the program by calling 1-888-227-7669.
National and state volunteers
If you’d enjoy taking on a leadership role, there are many possibilities at the
national and state levels. Working for AARP, you would help set national
policy and serve in key advisory roles. AARP policy and legislative decisions
are made at the national level by the volunteer Board of Directors. And, the
volunteer National Legislative Council provides valuable input.
AARP volunteers also serve as state volunteer leaders to help develop and
advance state priorities. You can also assist with communications to individ-
uals, groups, and the media about the organization’s programs and priorities,
309
Chapter 20: Volunteering in the Business and Community World

or you can train other volunteers on key issues. You’ll be involved in advocat-
ing for issues affecting Americans aged 50 years and older.
If you want to work from home, you can sign up for free e-mail updates and
action alerts from AARP. You can become an AARP Citizen Advocate and
respond to action alerts that involve national and state issues. To learn more
about how you can become an advocate, go to www.aarp.org/issues/
become_advocate. For more information on how you can become a state
volunteer, go to www.aarp.org/states.
Environmental Alliance for 
Senior Involvement
If you’d like to volunteer to improve the environment and work with other
retirees at the same time, you may want join the Environmental Alliance for
Senior Involvement (EASI; www.easi.org) as a volunteer. This organization
was established in 1991 as a national nonprofit coalition of environmental,
aging, and volunteer organizations. It was formed as the result of an agree-
ment between the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the AARP.
EASI seeks to increase opportunities for older adults to play an active, visible
role in protecting and improving the environment in their communities.
Through its national network of 12,000 local organizations, EASI selects local
hosts to recruit, train, and recognize senior volunteers who carry out a wide
range of environmental activities.

North Carolina Center for 
Creative Retirement
The North Carolina Center for Creative Retirement (NCCCR; http://www.
unca.edu/ncccr/), which was established in 1988 as an integral part of the
University of North Carolina at Asheville, promotes lifelong learning, leader-
ship, and community service opportunities for retirees. Besides serving the
greater Asheville area, NCCCR collaborates with organizations in North
Carolina and across the country.
NCCCR works to encourage the development of an age-integrated society. As
the U.S. population ages, NCCCR serves as a laboratory for exploring creative
and productive roles for a new generation of retirement-aged people, many of
whom want to blend education with post-retirement careers.
Two programs that might interest you are
 Leadership Asheville Seniors: If you’re retired and living near UNC
Asheville, you can participate in eight day-long sessions around the
Ashville community. Participants meet with community leaders, activists,
and politicians to learn more about the area’s history, people, institu-
tions, challenges, and opportunities. Many people who participate in
this program use it to reevaluate their choice of volunteer roles and find
new ones. After completing the program, you can stay in touch with
other alumni by joining the Leadership Asheville Forum.
 Creative Retirement Exploration Weekend: Offers a unique learning
vacation for those considering relocating in retirement — whether to
western North Carolina or elsewhere. Topics covered include how to
determine what a community offers you and how to assess if you’ll enjoy
living in a place as much as you do visiting there. You’ll also explore how
to answer questions such as: What should I be doing right now to make
my retirement what I want it to be when I get there? What lifestyle changes
should I consider as I approach retirement? And what new opportunities
can I find in a new community? The Retirement Exploration Weekend
usually includes about 150 people from more than 26 states.
Volunteer leaders guide NCCCR programs and services through a Center
Steering Council who collaborate with the center’s professional staff.
Year-round programs serve people in the greater Asheville area. The center
also offers periodic workshops, seminars, and retreats for people from all over
the U.S. You can find out more about NCCCR’s programs at http://www.
unca.edu/ncccr/ or by calling 828-251-6140.

OASIS
You can work with children and help improve their learning opportunities as
an OASIS volunteer (www.oasisnet.org/volunteer/index.htm), who
have offered many tools and talents to strengthen and serve their communi-
ties since 1982 and helped children learn to read through OASIS Intergen-
erational Tutoring. Other volunteer opportunities include teaching classes,
providing support to peers, promoting improved health, planning lifelong
learning programs, mentoring young people, as well as many other roles
through OASIS centers.
More than 14,000 volunteers work through OASIS programs around the 
country. You can find OASIS centers in Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois,
Indiana, Maryland, Missouri, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon,
Pennsylvania, Texas, and Washington, D.C.
To help you figure out if OASIS is the right opportunity for you or if other 
volunteer opportunities may be better, go to http://www.oasisnet.org/
volunteer/fit.htm.
Peace Corps
You probably never thought you could volunteer for the Peace Corps (www.
peacecorps.gov) in your 50s or 60s. Well think again!
Although in 1964, only 2 percent of Peace Corps volunteers were people over
the age of 50, today, about 7 percent are over 50 years old and hundreds
serve overseas as Peace Corps volunteers. Many senior Peace Corps volun-
teers serve as married couples. While you can offer the Peace Corps many
different types of skills, most people over 50 work in education or business.
You can work in emerging and essential areas, such as information technol-
ogy and business development. Healthcare is another key area where volun-
teers are needed, especially for the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS
Relief. Peace Corps volunteers seek to help individuals who want to build a
better life for themselves, their children, and their communities.
If you do decide to serve as a Peace Corps volunteer, you must plan on set-
ting aside 27 months for what could be grueling work. Peace Corps looks 
for people with determination, flexibility, patience, and a sense of humor.
Applying to the Peace Corps involves five steps with paperwork required at
each point along the way. This includes a lengthy application you must com-
plete, an interview process, medical and legal clearance, assessment of skills
and suitability, and then, if successful, a placement offer.

Senior Corps
Senior Corps (www.seniorcorps.org) connects people who are age 55 and
over with people and organizations that need them most. You can become a
mentor, coach, or companion to people in need, or you can contribute your
job skills and expertise to community projects and organizations.
Senior Corps was created during John F. Kennedy’s presidency. Today, it links
more than 500,000 Americans to service opportunities. Your skills, knowl-
edge, and experience can make a real difference to individuals, nonprofits,
and other community organizations throughout the United States. Today,
Senior Corps is part of the Corporation for National Service, which was
authorized by Congress in 1993. Its predecessors were ACTION and VISTA.
You can serve in several different ways after guidance and training. These
include
 Foster Grandparent Program: This program connects volunteers age 
60 and over with children and young people with exceptional needs.
Volunteers mentor, support, and help some of the most vulnerable chil-
dren in the United States.
 Senior Companion Program: This program brings together volunteers
age 60 and over with adults in their community who have difficulty with
the simple tasks of day-to-day living. You will be able to help others on a
personal level by assisting with shopping and light chores, interacting
with doctors, or just making a friendly visit.
 RSVP Program: This program connects volunteers age 55 and over with
service opportunities in their communities that match their skills and
availability. RSVP volunteers choose how and where they want to serve —
from a few hours a month to over 40 hours a week. RSVP volunteers pro-
vide hundreds of community services. As an RSVP volunteer, you can
tutor children in reading and math, help to build houses, help get chil-
dren immunized, model parenting skills to teen parents, participate in
neighborhood watch programs, plan community gardens, deliver meals,
offer disaster relief to victims of natural disasters, and help community
organizations operate more efficiently.

Volunteers in Parks
If you enjoy hanging out in the national parks, an ideal volunteer opportu-
nity for you is the Volunteers in Parks program (http://www.nps.gov/
volunteer/), which was authorized by Congress in 1970. In Fiscal Year 2005,
137,000 volunteers donated 5.2 million hours to national parks at a value of
$91.2 million.
Volunteers of all ages give of their time and expertise to help achieve the
National Park Service mission. Many seniors help to manage the gift shops or
serve as tour guides or teachers.
You can search for volunteer opportunities by either park or state by 
going to http://www.nps.gov/gettinginvolved/volunteer/
opportunities.htm.
Volunteering Internationally
You can mix your volunteering choices with your travel plans. If living out-
side the U.S. for a period of time would enhance your retirement years, then
consider volunteering internationally. In this section, I explore some of the
best ways to find international volunteer opportunities.
Earthwatch Institute
Earthwatch (www.earthwatch.org) recruits close to 4,000 volunteers every
year to collect field data in the areas of rainforest ecology, wildlife conserva-
tion, marine science, archaeology, and more.
Earthwatch’s key activities in which volunteers can become involved include
 Scientists who can work on proposed research projects, analyze recent
findings, and research results
 Teachers who can develop expedition-based curricula and lesson plans
 Communicators who can help keep Earthwatch members informed
about program results and upcoming events
Since 1971, Earthwatch, which is a nonprofit organization, has placed more
than 76,000 field researchers in scientific and social research projects around
315
Chapter 20: Volunteering in the Business and Community World

the globe. Forty percent of these volunteers were people over the age of 50,
and many of the volunteers return for additional projects once they have
completed one. All projects emphasize sustainability. Today, Earthwatch runs
about 140 projects in 48 countries.
You can find out more about how to get involved in Earthwatch by going to
www.earthwatch.org and clicking on the tab “Get Involved.”
Global Citizens Network
Global Citizens Network (www.globalcitizens.org) seeks to create a 
network of people who are committed to the shared values of peace, justice,
tolerance, cross-cultural understanding, and global cooperation, and who
want to help preserve indigenous cultures, traditions, and ecologies, and to
enhance the quality of life around the world. Fifty percent of Global Citizens’s
volunteers are older adults.
As a Global Citizens Network volunteer, you will learn from and work with
people in other cultures. Each team visits a developing community where
local people are involved in grassroots efforts to meet their human and com-
munity needs while preserving their culture and traditions.
You will have the opportunity to experience life in another culture by living
with local people, eating local foods, and experiencing local hardships and
triumphs. Volunteers receive instructions in language, social structure and
issues, agriculture, industry, and arts. You could also visit a community that
provides insight into specific issues or trends such as environmental protec-
tion, women in development, and traditional medicine. Global Citizens Network
volunteers assist community people working on locally initiated projects,
providing the human resources of mental and physical labor while working
under the leadership of community people.
Each volunteer team member receives training materials and participates in
an orientation session, generally on the first or second day of the trip. The
team spends one to three weeks in the community (depending on the site),
and is led by a trained and experienced team leader from Global Citizens
Network. A local individual acts as cultural consultant, and when necessary,
as translator and language tutor.
Each day as a volunteer, you’ll both work and learn. Accommodations do
vary, but often the team will live with local host families. At least one meal
each day will be communal, with the team and community members eating
together.
316
Part V: Knowledge to Philanthropy: Opportunities to Broaden the Mind 

Global Citizens teams usually consist of six to people. You aren’t required to
have specific skills and there no upper age restrictions. When you return
from volunteering outside the U.S., you can stay involved by working with a
Global Citizens Network chapter, participating in advisory committees, or
hosting seminars and community outreach events.
You can find out more about what is expected from volunteers and how to

Globe Aware
You can work as a volunteer for short-term volunteer programs with Globe
Aware (www.globeaware.org). With its programs, Globe Aware seeks to
promote cultural awareness and/or promote sustainability.
Globe Aware believes the concept of cultural awareness means to recognize
and appreciate the real beauties and real challenges of a culture, but not to
change it. The concept of sustainability is to help others stand on their own
two feet; to teach skills rather than reliance.
Projects meet these key criteria: safe, culturally interesting, genuinely benefi-
cial to a needy community, and involve significant interaction with the host
community. When you volunteer for Globe Aware, you’ll also have optional
chances for cultural excursions that are designed to highlight local culture in
a way the typical tourist can rarely experience. The organization has no polit-
ical or religious affiliation.
Volunteers are discouraged from trying to change host communities and
encouraged to help communities meet the needs that have been identified by
members of the host communities as important. You must start your volun-
teer experience with an open mind and willingness to help in order to enjoy
the experience. You’ll find that the natural, healthy exchange of ideas and
opinions fostered by Globe Aware leads to a mutual understanding of cultures.
Globe Aware’s founders have been organizing volunteer missions since 2000.
The first programs were run in Peru and Costa Rica, with several in Asia to
follow. Locations are chosen based on a huge number of factors, but gener-
ally are communities that are safe, genuinely needy with significant cultural
differences from the typical North American lifestyle, and willing to accept
our involvement. Globe Aware was recognized as a nonprofit organization 
in 2003.
You can find out more about volunteering through Globe Aware at www.globe
aware.org or by calling toll free at 877-588-4562.
Landscope Expeditions
If you think you’d like to travel and volunteer in Australia, you may want to
consider Landscope Expeditions (http://www.extension.uwa.edu.au/
tours/landscope.shtml), which are nonprofit, self-supported, study and
research projects. These expeditions started in 1992, and are a joint project
318
Part V: Knowledge to Philanthropy: Opportunities to Broaden the Mind 

of the Australian government’s Department of Conservation and Land
Management (CALM) and the University of Western Australia.
Expeditions have been offered through CALM’s publication LANDSCOPE,
which is a quarterly magazine devoted to wildlife, conservation, and envi-
ronmental issues in Western Australia. They are offered in association with
UWA Extension. You can subscribe to LANDSCOPE at http://www.calm.
wa.gov.au/landscope/index.html. An overseas subscription that
includes four issues and a year’s access to Australia’s national parks is $90 is
Australian currency, which was about $68 in U.S. currency at the time this
was written, but currency exchange values do fluctuate. You’ll find informa-
tion about current and future projects.
Volunteers get an opportunity to work alongside scientists and promote wider
cooperation in addressing conservation and land management challenges in
Western Australia. Any member of the general public can be involved subject
to fitness. You must be 13 years of age or over to be registered as a CALM vol-
unteer. Seventy-five percent of Landscope volunteers are older adults.
As a volunteer, you’ll be given the opportunity to
 Visit and gain understanding of remote or inaccessible places in
Australia
 Contribute to Australia’s knowledge of threatened environments and
endangered species
 Enjoy unique photo opportunities
 See and handle unusual animals
Landscope Expeditions help to perpetuate cultural and biological diversity. As
a volunteer, you’ll help to identify and preserve natural and cultural resources.

LiFeline
If cats are your thing and you’d like to live in Belize for a while, you might
want to consider volunteering at LiFeline (http://www.rtec.strayduck.
com/index.html), which is a wild cat research and rehabilitation center
that offers working vacations and conservation courses at its base in the
foothills of the Maya Mountains in Belize. 
319
Chapter 20: Volunteering in the Business and Community World

You’ll live and work on a 4,000-acre working ranch that is 41⁄2 miles from the
LiFeline centre. The centre is a 60-acre private jungle reserve that is home 
to a host of wildlife, including toucan, kinkajou, ocelot, puma, deer, paca,
agoutis parrots, and hummingbirds.
You will be working with jaguars, pumas, ocelots, margays, and jaguarundis
in their natural habitat. The LiFeline centre is on the edge of a National Park,
which, with other protected areas, covers over 600 square miles. The centre
is a government-approved facility, the first of its kind, concentrating solely 
on cats.
LiFeline seeks to conserve the wild cat species, not only in their native habi-
tat through LiFeline’s scientific field work, but also by advising on wild cat
welfare issues and providing a safe haven for cats that would otherwise face
a death penalty because of conflict with humans. LiFeline is a registered non-
profit organization working in close collaboration with the Belize Conservation
and Forestry Department. It is a project of The Ridgeway Trust for Endangered
Cats, a UK-based registered wildlife charity.
Some of the centre’s cats are awaiting release to the wild. Others are perma-
nent residents and the subject of ongoing behavioral research. Most of the
cats have found their way to LiFeline after a history of abuse, having been
captured from the wild as kittens to be kept as pets. Others are problem cats
that have taken to raiding livestock.
If you choose to be a volunteer, you’ll be able to take part in many of the
centre’s areas of work. Each program is individually tailored to a small group
of participants. After getting picked up at the airport and taken to the ranch,
you’ll be greeted by a LiFeline staff member who will advise you on your
schedule for the next eight days. Following a short orientation course on
your first day, your typical tasks may include radio-tracking a newly released
cat, digging out a jaguar pond, helping to maintain cat enclosures, habitat
vegetation analysis, setting camera traps, and assisting with behavioral stud-
ies. During your free time, you will have the opportunity to swim under a 
150-foot waterfall, to visit Belize Zoo, or tour Mayan archaeological sites.
You do pay for this working vacation/volunteer opportunity, but the costs
cover airport transfers, accommodations for nine nights, all meals, transfers
to and from the site each day, waterfall excursion, laundry service, and all
activities at the LiFeline site. Trip costs are $1,790 plus $160 if you want to go
to the Belize Zoo and Mayan archaeological sites.
You can book a trip by filling out the booking form at http://www.rtec.
strayduck.com/bookingform.htm or you can e-mail pm@li-feline.com
for more information. Because communications can sometimes be difficult,
LiFeline recommends you copy e-mails to lifelinebelize@yahoo.co.uk.

Orphanage Outreach
Volunteers with Orphanage Outreach (www.orphanage-outreach.org)
seek to provide opportunities to orphaned, abandoned, and disadvantaged
children in the Dominican Republic. They help to provide the basic necessi-
ties and a quality education. Orphanage Outreach, which is a Christian-based
interdenominational nonprofit organization, was incorporated in 1995.
Volunteers and donors have worked on its mission since the organization was
founded. Nearly 4,000 short-term volunteers have worked with Orphanage
Outreach since its founding. Thirty-five percent of the volunteers are older
adults.
As a volunteer, you focus both on the orphanage children and the many dis-
advantaged children of the Monte Cristi community. The volunteer program
during the school year is primarily focused on involving high school and col-
lege students and teams in teaching English in the local schools. During the
summer, Orphanage Outreach focuses on involving church groups to partner
with the local Monte Cristi churches.
As a volunteer, your basic logistical needs are taken care of. You don’t have
to worry about where your next shower, meal, or bus ride will come from.
Those basic necessities are taken care of by the organization.
You can find out more about volunteering for Orphanage Outreach by going
to http://www.orphanage-outreach.org/volunteer_overview.

Volunteering Virtually
If you want to work only from home, you might consider become a virtual 
volunteer, for which you can complete most of your work at home or via the
Internet. You can find out more about Virtual volunteering at www.service
leader.org/new/virtual/index.php.
Virtual volunteering gives nonprofit agencies a way to tap the expertise of
people who want to volunteer their time, but can’t come to an office. This
helps the agencies to expand the benefits they offer by enabling more volun-
teers to participate and by using volunteers in new areas. Virtual volunteer-
ing allows anyone to contribute time and expertise to nonprofit organizations,
schools, government offices, and other agencies that utilize volunteer serv-
ices, from his or her home or office.

The Principal Financial Group uses senior placement agencies to recruit
mature workers. Health benefits for retirees pre-65 and 65+ include individual
as well as spousal medical and drug coverage, vision, dental and long-term
care insurance, as well as individual and spousal life insurance or other death
benefit coverage. New hires are eligible for retiree benefits upon retirement.
Alternative work arrangements include flex time, compressed work sched-
ules, job sharing, and telecommuting. Full-time employees are eligible to
move to part-time work on a permanent or temporary basis. Although the
company does not have a formal phased retirement program, employees are
allowed to transition into part-time work with leader approval. The company
offers paid time off that is specifically designated for caregiving. Retirees are
offered temporary work assignments, consulting or contract work, telecom-
muting, part-time work, and full-time work.
Healthcare
Mercy Health System (www.mercyhealthsystem.org), a hospital system in
Wisconsin, won top honors in 2006 for its Senior Connection, which includes
free health insurance and financial counseling for its employees over 50. It
also offers a free prescription discount card and sponsors senior activities
such as brown bag lunches and trips.
Seniors can work using numerous flexible work options including the
Weekender Program (work only on weekends), Traveler Option (work 6- to
13-week assignments), Nursing Float Option (nurses are guaranteed benefits
while floating departments), Registry Pool Option (work 48 to 96 hours per
month with benefits), 8-10-12 Hour Shift Options, Work at Home Option, and
Work-To-Retire Program (work reduced hours — seasonally).
Mercy recruits retirees using e-cards and direct mailings to target mature
workers and retirees. They also recruit via personal recommendations, spon-
sor booths, and attend job and product fairs targeted at the senior popula-
tion. Retirees are offered the following work arrangements: temporary work
assignments, consulting/contract work, telecommuting, and part- and full-
time work.

John Deere (www.johndeere.com), known worldwide for its industrial and
commercial equipment, actively recruits older workers through senior place-

In addition, the company offers alternative work arrangements such as flex
time, compressed work schedules, telecommuting, and a formal phased

hour per week). The phased retirement program allows a full-time employee
to move to part-time work. Full-time employees are eligible to move to part-
time work on a permanent or temporary basis. Retirees are offered the fol-
lowing work arrangements: temporary work assignments, consulting or
contract work, telecommuting, as well as part- and full-time work.

caregiving. Retirees are offered the following work arrangements: temporary
work assignments, consulting or contract work, telecommuting, as well as
part- and full-time work.

Chapter 22
Top Ten Skills for Running Your
Own Business
In This Chapter
 Running the business
 Growing the business
 Managing yourself and others
R
unning a business requires a great variety of skills, and you probably
don’t have them all. In this chapter, I pick the top ten skills you need. If
you don’t have them, or are weak in any of them, be sure to find a partner or
top manager who can help fill the gaps.
Administrative Skills
You may be able to afford to hire a good assistant who can organize your
office for you, but if you’re just starting a business, that’s not likely the case.
If you haven’t already done this in previous jobs, you need to get very good
at preparing correspondence with your customers and vendors, invoicing
and billing, collecting and tracking customer payments, and all the other
tasks that an office manager, secretary, and bookkeeper might do in a large
business.
You also need to keep your filing up to date so you know which bills you’ve
paid, which customers have paid you, as well as all the details you’ll need to
file all the federal, state, and local government reports, including tax returns.
Administrative skills are not the glamorous part of owning your own busi-
ness, but they’re certainly critical ones.

Decision Making
All small-business owners will need to make decisions every day, probably
numerous times per day. You need to be able to make sound decisions
quickly, constantly, and under pressure. You’re the boss, so you need to be
able to act correctly and independently. There won’t be anyone else you can
lean on for their opinion. While you can seek advice from employees or busi-
ness advisors, such as accountants and lawyers, ultimately you’re the one
that must be able to make the right decisions for your business.
Financial Skills
Unless you’re professionally trained as an accountant, you will most likely
hire someone to do the financial statements for you, but that person won’t
take on the daily responsibilities of keeping your business’s books. You could
hire a bookkeeper when you can afford one to take care of the daily tasks, but
you always want to keep on top of those books to avoid potential fraud or
theft. As a business owner, you never want to turn your books over to some-
one else, unless it’s a close family member or partner, without maintaining
strong controls.
You also need to be good at managing cash flow and making sure you’ll have
enough money on hand to meet your bills. Vendors will quickly cut you off if
they don’t get paid, which can shut your business down.
Before you spend any money, you should know how to analyze the benefits of
that expense to your business and whether that expense will ultimately add
to your ability to make a profit. If you’re not sure, take the time to analyze the
expense further, and don’t rush to make a financial decision until you are cer-
tain you know its ramifications for your business.
Industry-Specific Skills
I can’t list specific skills here, but I do want to remind you that you should
know and be sure you have the specific skills for the industry in which you
plan to run your business. For example, if you’re planning to buy or start a
restaurant, you need to have many different industry-specific skills. You must
know how to cook everything on your menu even if you plan to hire a chef.
Remember that your chef could get sick or quit abruptly and you’ll have to
do the cooking to keep the business open.
332
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

You must know how to hire and manage servers to be sure your customers
are getting the service you expect them to get. You must understand the
technical aspects of buying your food for the restaurant, so you get the qual-
ity of food you want, when you want it, and at the best price.
For whatever business you’re thinking of starting or buying, write down all
the specific knowledge and skills you might need and either learn to do them
yourself or find a partner who can fill any gaps. Only a partner will put in the
time, effort, and dedication that you’ll need to get a business off the ground
and keep it going.
People Management
Can you work with all different types of people and manage what they do? 
A business owner must be good at developing working relationships with all
kinds of people, including employees, customers, vendors, bankers, and pro-
fessionals.
You must be good at recognizing an individual’s idiosyncrasies and learn to
use them to get what you want. Just about every day your business is open
you will be faced with a demanding customer or a cranky employee.
Frequently, you need to deal with an unreliable vendor. Can you handle the
pressure and get even difficult people to work for you and do what you want?
Physical and Emotional Stamina
Running your own business can be very demanding both physically and emo-
tionally. Do you have the stamina to handle the pressure? You will likely face
12-hour days (or more), six or seven days a week, as a business owner. Be
sure you are ready to handle that both emotionally and physically.
Problem Solving
You must be a good problem solver. As a business owner, that will be one of
your primary jobs. Everyone, including employees, vendors, and customers,
will be bringing their problems to you. You need to be able to work with them
to develop a solution quickly and move on.
333
Chapter 22: Top Ten Skills for Running Your Own Business

You can’t afford to tie yourself down to researching one solution and imple-
menting it, while the rest of your business goes down the toilet. You must be
able to either come up with a solution quickly, or know how, and to whom,
you can designate responsibility to solve that problem.
If you are running the business all by yourself, you need to carefully manage
your time and be sure you don’t spend too much time solving one problem
while ten others sit there waiting for a solution.
Self-Motivation
Every business owner must be good at self-motivation. You won’t have
anyone telling you what to do next. You must be good at developing your
own to-do list and working through that list to get things done as quickly as
possible.
Everything that needs to get done for your business must be done by you,
from finding funding and developing your product, to developing a marketing
plan and making sales. You will be the only one creating plans and altering
those plans as you test various business theories. You need to know when
something is working and when it’s not, so you can quickly make adjustments
and get the business back on track.
You must have a great deal of self-confidence in your abilities and you must
know where you want the business to be in the next year or the next five
years.
Sales and Marketing
The two most important skills for any business owner are sales and market-
ing. If you’re not good at these two things, don’t even try to start a business
unless you find a partner who is. You could develop the greatest product or
service in the world, but if you don’t know how to attract and keep cus-
tomers, your business will fail.
You must spend time developing your marketing plan, including identifying
your target audience and how you will reach them. You must know who your
competition is and how you will sell against that competition to convince
people that your product or service is the best to buy. If you’re opening a
retail store, you must come up with a marketing plan that will differentiate
your store from other similar stores.
334
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Time Management
As you review all the skills you need, you’ll probably think to yourself, “How
can I possibly do all that in one day?” Well you can’t. Good time management
is knowing what you need to do yourself and what you can ask someone else
to do for you.
In some cases, you may be able to pass the task on to an employee or ask a
vendor’s representative to do the task for you. You may decide you need to
hire a professional — accountant, lawyer, consultant, or other specialist — to
take care of some tasks for you, so you can spend time doing the other things
you must do yourself.
If you’re running a one-person business, you must put together a to-do list in
the morning of all the things that must get done that day; prioritize that list
and realize that some things just won’t get done because of other problems
or emergencies that will come your way. You must be able to multitask and
keep a bunch of balls bouncing in the air at all times. As you find a few quiet
minutes here and there throughout the day, get something else done on 
your list.
You also must be good at separating your work life from your home life, even
if your business is in your home. You can’t spend 100 percent of your time
and effort on your business and ignore the needs of your family and friends.
Not only will it be bad for you emotionally and physically, it can also destroy
your relations with your family and friends, support that you’ll need to keep
yourself going.

Ten (Almost) Great Volunteering
Experiences to Take Advantage Of
In This Chapter
 Matching your skills to needs
 Finding the right spot
 Helping others
You’ve worked all your life and you’re ready to give back to others. In this
chapter, I introduce you to ten great volunteering experiences, based on
skills or interests you’ve developed throughout your life or career.
Advocate
If you’ve enjoyed advocating for various causes all your life, what better
cause could you find now than to advocate for things that will most help 
you and other people in your age group. AARP (http://www.aarp.org/
about_aarp/community_service) provides a wide variety of volunteer
opportunities from which you can choose. Whether you enjoy political
activism, helping those in need, working with children, or advising on mone-
tary and tax matters, you’ll find a volunteer opportunity that matches your
desire to help.
Here are some of the programs you can volunteer for at AARP:
 AARP Benefits Outreach Program: Help older people with low or mod-
erate incomes find public and private benefit programs for which they
may be eligible to help pay for prescription drugs, groceries, doctor
bills, heating bills, property taxes, and more.
 AARP Chapters: Get involved in local volunteer efforts including men-
toring activities, food and clothing drives, friendly visits, state advocacy,
and much more.

 AARP Driver Safety Program: Teach driver safety and help others qual-
ify for reduced car insurance premiums.
 AARP Money Management Program: Help older or disabled people who
have difficulty budgeting, paying bills, and keeping track of their
finances, but have no family or friends able to help them out.
 NRTA: AARP’s Educator Community: Volunteer with local retired educa-
tors’ associations to tutor, provide school supplies and books, and help
to run food and clothing drives. If you’re a retired educator, you can help
new teachers and administrators.
 AARP Tax-Aide: Provide free tax preparation services to millions of low-
and moderate-income taxpayers, with special attention to those age 60
and older.
This is just a brief sample of what you can do. You can find more details
about this and other volunteer opportunities mentioned in this chapter in
Chapter 20.
Business Executive
If you’re a successful former business executive and you’d like to share your
knowledge and skills with small-business owners that need your help, you
may find volunteering through SCORE (www.score.org) an excellent venue
for passing on your knowledge. You can help a small-business owner develop
a business plan, improve his marketing, increase his cash flow, or any
number of other critical aspects needed to keep a business alive.
If you prefer to work from home by computer or phone, you can become part
of SCORE’s virtual advice network, where business people are helped online,
primarily through e-mail requests.
Caregiver
If you enjoy aiding others one-on-one, you may want to become a mentor,
coach, or companion through Senior Corps (www.seniorcorps.org),
which connects people who are age 55 and over with people and organiza-
tions that need them most.
Here are three programs run by Senior Corps that you may like:
 Foster Grandparent Program: Help children and young people with
exceptional needs who are among the most vulnerable children in the
United States.
338
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

 Senior Companion Program: Help other seniors who have difficulty with
the simplest tasks of day-to-day living, including shopping and light chores,
interacting with doctors, or visiting them and keeping them company.
 RSVP Program: You can do a variety of things depending on what you
enjoy, such as tutoring children in reading and math, helping to build
houses, helping get children immunized, modeling parenting skills to teen
parents, participating in neighborhood watch programs, planning commu-
nity gardens, delivering meals, offering disaster relief to victims of natural
disasters, and helping community organizations operate more efficiently.
Environmentalist
If you want to work on projects to protect the environment, consider joining
the Environmental Alliance for Senior Involvement (EASI; www.easi.org).
Three programs that might interest you include
 Local Senior Environment Corps Initiatives: Focus on energy conserva-
tion, environmental education, environmental health, environmental
monitoring, environmental restoration, and pollution prevention.
 Senior Leadership Corps: Provide leadership for local Bureau of Land
Management volunteer projects and help manage various projects
involving hundreds of volunteers.
 Volunteer Senior Ranger Corps: Help meet priority needs at eight of
America’s national parks through partnerships between the Park Service
and its surrounding communities.
Home-Based
If you’re stuck at home, but still want to volunteer your skills and experience,
consider volunteering using your computer through Virtual Volunteering (www.
serviceleader.org/new/virtual/index.php). You can contribute time
and expertise to nonprofit organizations, schools, government offices, and
other agencies that utilize volunteer services, from your home or office.
Internationalist
If you prefer to travel and work on a global scale, you may want to volunteer
through one of two international agencies: Global Citizens or Global Volunteers.
339
Chapter 23: Ten (Almost) Great Volunteering Experiences to Take Advantage Of

Both agencies give you opportunities to live and work with the people you
are helping, but with slightly different focuses.
Global Citizens Network (www.globalcitizens.org) seeks to create a 
network of people who are committed to the shared values of peace, justice,
tolerance, cross-cultural understanding, and global cooperation, and who
want to help preserve indigenous cultures, traditions, and ecologies, and to
enhance the quality of life around the world. You will have the opportunity to
experience life in another culture by living with local people, eating local
foods, and experiencing local hardships and triumphs.
Global Volunteers (www.globalvolunteers.org) seeks to facilitate peace
and mutual understanding among people of diverse cultures. You can work
on projects in six primary categories: teaching English, caring for disabled or
orphaned children, building and repairing homes and community facilities,
tutoring, and improving.
Medical Professional
If you’re a trained medical professional, you might enjoy helping people with
limited resources find good medical care through Volunteers in Medicine (VIM)
Clinic (http://www.vimi.org/volunteer.shtml). VIM clinics serve in
areas where healthcare is most needed. The amount of time you decide to
give to a clinic is up to you. VIM does recommend that retired physicians 
volunteer at least a half-day per week.
Park Enthusiast
If you enjoy visiting the national parks, you may enjoy volunteering for them
even more. You can volunteer for the parks through the Volunteers in Parks
program. Volunteers of all ages give their time and expertise to help achieve
the National Park Service mission. Many seniors help to manage the gift
shops or serve as tour guides or teachers. You can search for volunteer
opportunities by either park or state by going to http://www.nps.gov/
gettinginvolved/volunteer/opportunities.htm.
