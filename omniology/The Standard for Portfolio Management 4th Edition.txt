INTROduCTION
This section covers the purpose, context, and principles of portfolio management, including the definition of several 
key terms, and provides an overview of The Standard for Portfolio Management – Fourth Edition. The following major 
sections are addressed:
1.1 Purpose of The Standard for Portfolio Management
1.2 Audience for The Standard for Portfolio Management
1.3 What Is a Portfolio?
1.4 Relationships Among Portfolios, Programs, Projects, and Operations
1.5 What Is Portfolio Management?
1.6  Relationships Among Portfolio Management, Program Management, and Project Management
1.7 Principles of Portfolio Management
1.8  Relationships Among Portfolio Management, Organizational Strategy, Strategic business 
Execution, and Organizational Project Management
1.9 Portfolio Components and Their Interrelationships
1.10 Role of the Portfolio Manager
1.11 Other Roles in Portfolio Management
1.1 PuRPOSE OF THE STANDARD FOR PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT
The Standard for Portfolio Management – Fourth Edition identifies project portfolio management principles and 
performance management domains that are generally recognized as good practices for organizations that have 
business needs to effectively manage complex and intense program and project investments. “Generally recognized” 
means that the principles and performance management domains described are applicable to most portfolios most 
of the time, and that there is widespread consensus about their value and usefulness. “Good practice” means there 
is general agreement that the application of these principles and performance management activities can enhance 
the chances of success and are proven to work over a wide range of portfolios. Good practice does not mean the 
management activities described should be applied uniformly to portfolios; the organization’s governance and the 
portfolio manager are responsible for determining what is appropriate for any portfolio given its environment, and in 
the context of the organization’s project and program management framework.

2 
The Standard for Portfolio Management – Fourth Edition
The Standard for Portfolio Management – Fourth Edition includes a common, unified vocabulary for use among 
the portfolio management profession for promoting, discussing, researching, writing, applying, and continuously 
improving portfolio management concepts. By using a single lexicon that is understandable by practitioners regardless 
of geographical location, culture, industry, or educational background, portfolio management practitioners are able to 
communicate and facilitate the management of portfolios and execution of strategies.
Portfolio management of programs, projects, and related operations is intended for all types of organizations.
This standard is a companion to information already provided in A Guide to the Project Management Body of 
Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide) – Sixth Edition [1],1 and The Standard for Program Management – Fourth Edition [2]. As 
a foundational reference, this standard is not intended to be comprehensive or all-inclusive. It is a guide rather than 
a methodology. One can use various methods and tools to implement the principles and practices described herein.
In addition to the standards that establish guidelines for project management principles, processes, tools, and 
techniques, the PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct [3] describes the expectations that practitioners should 
have for themselves and others. It is specific about the basic obligations of responsibility, respect, fairness, and 
honesty. It requires that practitioners demonstrate a commitment to ethical and professional conduct. It carries the 
obligation to comply with laws, regulations, and organizational and professional policies. Because practitioners come 
from diverse backgrounds and cultures, the Code of Ethics applies globally. When dealing with any stakeholder, 
practitioners should be committed to honest and fair practices and respectful dealings. Acceptance and adherence to 
the Code of Ethics is a requirement to achieve and maintain the Portfolio Management Professional (PfMP)® credential 
and other PMI certifications.
1.2 AudIENCE FOR THE STANDARD FOR PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT

1.3 WHAT IS A PORTFOLIO?
A portfolio is a collection of projects, programs, subsidiary portfolios, and operations managed as a group to 
achieve strategic objectives. The portfolio components, such as programs and projects within the portfolio, are 
quantifiable (e.g., identified, categorized, evaluated, prioritized, authorized). Also, the portfolio components may be 
related or unrelated, may be independent or interdependent, and may have related or unrelated objectives. Portfolio 
components compete for a share of some or all of a set of limited resources. The share or proportions of individual 
components within a portfolio structure can be driven by organizational strategies and capabilities. Therefore, 
organizations need to examine their unique circumstances and determine how best to optimize and balance the 
portfolio components.
A portfolio exists to achieve organizational and business unit strategies and goals, and may consist of a set of 
current and future portfolio components. Like programs and projects, portfolios have a life cycle. However, unlike 
programs and projects, which have a more limited duration, portfolios often have greater longevity and management 
attention. Given portfolios’ longer term, new components can churn into portfolios and their subsidiary portfolios. 
Portfolio closure can occur when the portfolio is no longer required, when the intended objectives are achieved, or 
when the portfolio’s components are decommissioned or moved to another portfolio. Depending on the size and 
complexity of organizations, portfolios can merge and separate to achieve optimal performance.
An organization may have more than one portfolio, each addressing unique or different organizational (business, 
functional, or other) strategies, goals, and objectives. Proposed new initiatives that could evolve into programs 
or projects may be placed into an existing or new portfolio. In addition, larger portfolios may contain subsidiary 
portfolios and are usually structured as a hierarchy (see Figure 1-1). For example, programs, projects, or functional-
unit portfolios may reside within a larger business unit portfolio, which, in turn, is nested as just one portfolio within 
the entire enterprise portfolio. Common project portfolios include product lines, information technology portfolios, 
enterprise project portfolios, and a myriad of others.
Furthermore, portfolios can be internal or external to an organization. Portfolios can also exist at various levels of 
an organization, such as enterprise, divisional, business unit, and functional. Portfolios can be organized separately, 
but they can also be organized in a hierarchical structure. Portfolios can support both the core functions as well as the 
support functions of an organization.
At any given time, a portfolio represents a collection of its selected portfolio components and reflects one or 
more organizational strategies and objectives for that point in time. Therefore, a functioning portfolio should be a 
representation of an organization’s intent, direction, and progress at any given moment. If a portfolio is not aligned to 
the organizational strategy for any reason, the organization should reasonably question why the work of the portfolio 
is being undertaken and should align the portfolio with its strategy by taking corrective actions such as adjusting, 
aligning, and/or removing the initiatives included in the portfolio.

1.4 RELATIONSHIPS AMONG PORTFOLIOS, PROGRAMS, PROjECTS, ANd OPERATIONS
The relationships among portfolios, programs, and projects are such that a portfolio refers to a collection of 
projects, programs, subsidiary portfolios, and related operations managed collectively as a group to achieve strategic 
objectives. The relationships among these components have the potential to bring value to the organization through 
portfolio management. This is also the criterion by which they are evaluated and added to the portfolio. Programs are 
grouped within a portfolio, and they include related projects, subsidiary programs, and program activities managed in 
a coordinated manner to obtain benefits not available from managing them individually. Individual projects that have 
strategic importance, whether within or outside of a program, are considered part of a portfolio. Although the programs 
or projects within a portfolio may not be directly related or interdependent, they are linked to the organization’s 
strategic plan by means of the portfolio.
Organizational planning impacts the projects by means of project prioritization based on risk, funding, resource 
constraints, and other considerations relevant to the organization’s strategic objectives. Organizational planning can 
direct the management of resources and support for the component programs and projects based on risk categories, 
specific lines of business, or general types of projects.
All portfolio components should exhibit certain features that include:
u
u Representing how the organization will achieve its strategic goals and objectives through the portfolio and its 
components;
u
u Representing the organization’s investment priorities to achieve its strategy;

5
u
u Requiring management and governance that includes allocating and sharing resources (e.g., human, financial, 
asset, and intellectual) across portfolio components;
u
u Having the ability to be quantifiable and, therefore, evaluated, measured, ranked, and prioritized; and
u
u Having the ability to be directed or controlled to accomplish portfolio value.
1.5 WHAT IS PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT?
Portfolio management is the centralized management of one or more portfolios to achieve strategic objectives. It 
is the application of portfolio management principles to align the portfolio and its components with the organizational 
strategy. Portfolio management can also be viewed as a dynamic activity through which an organization invests its 
resources to achieve its strategic objectives by identifying, categorizing, monitoring, evaluating, integrating, selecting, 
prioritizing, optimizing, balancing, authorizing, transitioning, controlling, and terminating portfolio components.
1.6 RELATIONSHIPS AMONG PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT, PROGRAM MANAGEMENT, 
ANd PROjECT MANAGEMENT
Portfolio management balances conflicting demands among portfolio components, allocates resources (e.g., 
human, financial, assets, and intellectual) based on organizational priorities and capacity, and integrates management 
principles and sound practices to deliver business value aligned with the strategic objectives. The focus of program 
management is on achieving the intended benefits and business outcomes for which the program was initiated 
and doing so within cost and schedule. Project management is largely concerned with achieving specific project 
deliverables that support business and organizational objectives.
The attributes of portfolio components can be further differentiated as represented in Table 1-1.
Portfolio, program, and project management should be aligned with and driven by organizational strategy and 
other business drivers. Conversely, portfolio, program, and project management contributes to the achievement and 
implementation of strategic objectives. Portfolio management aligns with organizational strategy by selecting the 
best portfolio components, prioritizing the work, providing the needed resources, overseeing or working with portfolio 
component managers on their implementation, supervising proper transition into the operational environment, and 
enabling the achievement of portfolio value. Program management is focused on harmonizing its component and 
operational initiatives and managing their interdependencies in order to realize specified benefits. Project management 
develops and implements plans at a more detailed level to achieve a specific scope that is driven by the objectives of 
the portfolio or program to which it is subjected and, ultimately, to organizational strategy (e.g., business, functional, 
and other broad strategies).
Portfolio management often establishes the overall direction and tone of business execution that shapes and 
defines or calibrates its components.

The Standard for Portfolio Management – Fourth Edition
 
 
Organizational Project Management
Projects
Programs
Portfolios
A project is a temporary endeavor 
undertaken to create a unique 
product, service, or result.
Projects have defined objectives.  
Scope is progressively elaborated 
throughout the project life cycle.
Project managers expect change 
and implement processes to keep 
change managed and controlled.
Project managers progressively 
elaborate high-level information 
into detailed plans throughout the 
project life cycle.
Project managers manage the 
project team to meet the project 
objectives.
Project managers monitor and 
control the work of producing the 
products, services, or results that 
the project was undertaken to 
produce.
Success is measured by product 
and project quality, timeliness, 
budget compliance, and degree of 
customer satisfaction.
A program is a group of related 
projects, subsidiary programs, and 
program activities that are 
managed in a coordinated manner 
to obtain benefits not available 
from managing them individually.
Programs have a scope that 
encompasses the scopes of its 
program components. Programs 
produce benefits to an organization 
by ensuring that the outputs and 
outcomes of program components 
are delivered in a coordinated and 
complementary manner.
Programs are managed in a manner 
that accepts and adapts to change 
as necessary to optimize the 
delivery of benefits as the 
program’s components deliver 
outcomes and/or outputs.
Programs are managed using high-
level plans that track the 
interdependencies and progress 
of program components. Program 
plans are also used to guide 
planning at the component level.
Programs are managed by program 
managers who ensure that program 
benefits are delivered as expected, 
by coordinating the activities of a 
program’s components.
Program managers monitor the 
progress of program components to 
ensure the overall goals, schedules, 
budget, and benefits of the program 
will be met.
A program’s success is measured 
by the program’s ability to deliver 
its intended benefits to an 
organization, and by the program’s 
efficiency and effectiveness in 
delivering those benefits.
A portfolio is a collection of 
projects, programs, subsidiary 
portfolios, and operations managed 
as a group to achieve strategic 
objectives.
Portfolios have an organizational 
scope that changes with the 
strategic objectives of the 
organization.
Portfolio managers continuously 
monitor changes in the broader 
internal and external environments.
Portfolio managers create and 
maintain necessary processes and 
communication relative to the 
aggregate portfolio.
Portfolio managers may manage or 
coordinate portfolio management 
staff, or program and project staff 
that may have reporting 
responsibilities into the aggregate 
portfolio.
Portfolio managers monitor 
strategic changes and aggregate 
resource allocation, performance 
results, and risk of the portfolio.
Success is measured in terms of 
the aggregate investment 
performance and benefit realization 
of the portfolio.

1.7 PRINCIPLES OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT
Organizational strategies and their objectives serve to establish and guide an organization’s decisions, direction, 
purpose, and resource allocations to achieve targeted values. These values can be broad or narrow depending on 
organizational mission and vision. Extrinsic values may be market, social, political, and environmental; intrinsic values 
such as competency, talent, culture, growth, development, and competitiveness are also important considerations. 
Determining organizational strategy is difficult; achieving results is sometimes even more challenging and complex.

7
There are many challenges to achieving results. Chief among them are aligning strategy and execution, obtaining and 
maintaining senior management support, balancing what is feasible with what is essential, determining short- and long-
term benefits and goals, managing resources including capacities and capabilities, and achieving and sustaining the ability 
to execute. In short, organizations cannot afford to waste precious resources and should find ways to “do the right projects 
at the right time in the right way.” Portfolio management presents an organized approach to achieve strategic results.
The following fundamental principles are core to this standard:
u
u Strive to achieve excellence in strategic execution;
u
u Enhance transparency, responsibility, accountability, sustainability, and fairness;
u
u Balance portfolio value against overall risks;
u
u Ensure that investments in portfolio components are aligned with the organization’s strategy;
u
u Obtain and maintain the sponsorship and engagement of senior management and key stakeholders;
u
u Exercise active and decisive leadership for the optimization of resource utilization;
u
u Foster a culture that embraces change and risk; and
u
u Navigate complexity to enable successful outcomes.
The purpose of these principles is to provide guidance for portfolio management practitioners in the conceptualization, 
establishment, implementation, and ongoing management of portfolio(s) in their organizations. By creating strong 
links between strategic planning and strategic business execution, organizations can achieve greater organizational 
performance while improving resource utilization, exploiting new opportunities, and minimizing threats.
1.8 RELATIONSHIPS AMONG PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT, ORGANIzATIONAL STRATEGY, 
STRATEGIC buSINESS EXECuTION, ANd ORGANIzATIONAL PROjECT MANAGEMENT
The organizational strategy helps define specific goals and objectives for the organization. Organizational strategy 
should be overarching, encompassing organizational activities that include operations and other related change 
activities. Because strategies are ideas, concepts, and plans, the attainment of business value requires action for 
the execution of these plans (e.g., strategic plans, business development plans, operational plans, action plans). 
Most change activities, both internal and external to the organization (e.g., contract work), are performed through 
portfolio components such as program and project activities. To maintain and sustain competitiveness, organizations 
require strong strategic execution to implement their portfolios, programs, and projects, not just occasionally, but 
consistently and repeatedly over time. This requires organizations to adopt strong disciplines, such as organizational 
project management (OPM). OPM is a strategic business execution framework that utilizes portfolio, program, and 
project management as well as organizational enabling practices to consistently and predictably deliver organizational 
strategy to produce better performance, results, and business value.
Value is the primary focus of portfolio management. It is defined as the entire quantifiable and qualifiable benefits, 
worth, and usefulness of the organization—the total sum of all tangible and intangible elements. Examples of tangible 
elements include monetary assets, shareholder satisfaction, and utility. Examples of intangible elements include 
reputation, brand recognition, public benefit, legacy, patents, and trademarks. Business value can be defined in 
terms of its short-, medium-, or long-term realization. Value is created through the effective management of ongoing 
operations.

1.8.1 PorTFolIo ManagEMEnT and organIzaTIonal STraTEgy
An organizational strategy is composed of goals and policies that provide the overall direction and focus of the 
organization, and plans and actions to achieve those goals. These serve as a primary input to portfolio management. 
Organizations strive to possess effective management capability that will lead to longevity and success. Portfolio 
management is an integral part of the organization’s overall strategic direction. It is the vehicle through which 
change initiatives and strategic investments are undertaken to realize strategic goals and objectives. Linking portfolio 
management to strategy balances the use of resources to maximize the value delivered in executing programs, 
projects, and operational activities. The organizational strategy and objectives are translated into a set of initiatives that 
are influenced by many factors, such as market dynamics, customer and partner requests, shareholders, government 
regulations, internal stakeholders and their aspirations, and competitor plans and actions. These initiatives establish 
a portfolio of programs, projects, and operations components to be executed in the specific period.

Figure 1-2 illustrates the relationship and direction that vision, mission, and organizational strategy and objectives 
provide to portfolio management strategic planning and the management of programs, projects, and operations. 
Portfolio management aims to enhance key business performance indicators, such as ROI or improving societal 
value, by providing a holistic framework for strategy execution. Portfolio management requires constant alignment 
to strategic objectives and the ability to envision alternative future consequences to support and enhance strategic 
portfolio decision making. Awareness of portfolio components with its many relationships and dependencies, as 
shown in Figure 1-2, enhances the portfolio manager’s ability to envision possible future issues and risks.

9
The shaded section in Figure 1-2—portfolio management strategic planning and management of programs, 
projects, and operations—depicts the relationship between organizational strategy and objectives with management 
activities of initiatives and operational activities. Portfolio performance is monitored against the organizational 
strategy and objectives with performance feedback, providing input for potential changes in strategic direction for 
the organization.
Portfolio management also requires integration with organizational planning and business analysis to analyze 
current business risks. This analysis may drive strategic changes to enable the planned (active and future) portfolio 
components to continue to support strategic goals. When organizational planning determines that a goal is no longer 
valid for the organization, the portfolio manager, often working together with the governance team, reviews the 
portfolio and reassesses any portfolio components that are in place to achieve the obsolete goal, with the intent of 
adjusting or terminating any component that no longer contributes to strategic goals.
Portfolio management ensures continuous alignment to strategic objectives, which is paramount because 
organizations can undergo strategy redefinition as a result of shareholder pressure for greater profitability, changing 
market conditions, balancing the needs for change with the needs of ongoing operations, and so forth. Sometimes, 
a change in the tactics for the implementation of the strategic objectives may also result in portfolio changes. The 
portfolio should always be realigned and rebalanced after important decisions are made at the senior executive level 
that result in changes to strategy and/or strategic objectives. This realignment and balance of the portfolio should also 
be shared with the employees who play critical roles as stakeholders in programs and projects. Through the review 
of strategic, tactical, and operational capabilities and gaps, portfolio management provides feedback that is useful 
for the planning and management of resources, monitoring the health of the portfolio, and working with program and 
project management on the execution of the portfolio components.
1.8.2 STraTEgIC BuSInESS EXECuTIon and organIzaTIonal ProjECT ManagEMEnT
Portfolio management, program management, and project management are domains of the organizational project 
management framework for managing the capability to deliver value. Organizational project management (OPM) is a 
framework in which portfolio, program, and project management are integrated with organizational enablers in order 
to achieve strategic objectives. OPM enables an organization to leverage its results and implementation success, and 
supports a strong organization within a competitive and rapidly changing environment.
An organization establishes goals that will move it toward its vision and that have objectives consisting of 
measurable steps for goal achievement. Execution of portfolio components should focus on achieving these strategic 
objectives and, ultimately, the goals of the organization.
Once a portfolio component is authorized, the program or project manager assumes direct management control of 
the portfolio component and applies management processes to enable the work to be done. A responsible program or 
project manager will monitor planned versus actual performance and provide ongoing feedback to the portfolio manager.
Portfolio components do not exist in isolation. Each portfolio includes diverse components, is a part of the 
entire organizational system of interrelated components, and each portfolio is simultaneously a part of the entire 
organizational system.
Portfolio management practitioners work in a complex environment with overlapping and often conflicting interests. 
Under such conditions, practitioners are often challenged by information overload and not enough actionable intelligence. 
To comprehend such an environment and be in a position to anticipate behavior, it is necessary to study the portfolio as a 
system. Programs and projects are the temporary vehicles that deliver change. Therefore, a systems perspective allows for 

10 
The Standard for Portfolio Management – Fourth Edition
a better understanding of the goals of the change initiatives and of the vehicles delivering these goals—the components of 
the portfolio.
The ultimate goal of linking portfolio management with organizational strategy and strategic business execution 
is to establish a balanced, realistic plan that will help the organization achieve its goals. The impact of the portfolio 
management plan upon strategy is attained through six performance management domains and the portfolio life cycle, 
as illustrated in Figure 1-3.

The six portfolio management performance domains represent the collection of good practices. The following 
provides a brief description of each portfolio management performance domain, including the portfolio life cycle. 
These are further elaborated in subsequent sections of this standard.
u
u Portfolio Life Cycle (Section 2). Portfolios are a major investment of organizational resources and, like 
programs and projects, portfolios go through a life cycle that includes initiation, planning, execution, and 
optimization. The diligent management of the life cycle by balancing stability with adaptability is crucial for 
managing activity in today’s constantly changing environment.
u
u Portfolio Strategic Management (Section 3). Each portfolio component should be aligned to one or more 
strategic objectives, and the positive impact should be constantly monitored. This is what is meant by the term 

11
strategic management in the portfolio management context, and it is achieved by a clear understanding of 
the strategic objectives and how important each component is in relation to those objectives. Any proposal for 
including a component in the portfolio should describe how it supports the attainment of intended business value.
u
u Portfolio Governance (Section 4). Through open and transparent governance, including processes for 
categorizing, prioritizing, selecting, and approving portfolio components, key stakeholders are more likely to 
accept the decisions and agree with the process, even when they may not fully endorse the decisions made.
u
u Portfolio Capacity and Capability Management (Section 5). The selection of portfolio components and 
the roadmap for their implementation is balanced against the organization’s current capacity and capability 
with the potential of bringing in additional resources. The portfolio view allows for future planning to develop 
capacity and capabilities as required. This is particularly important when resourcing and balancing program 
and project components against operational components.
u
u Portfolio Stakeholder Engagement (Section 6). Key portfolio stakeholders require active expectation 
management. By staying aligned and connected, portfolios improve the probability of delivering value. Active 
communication is a primary vehicle through which the exchange of information, improved transparency, and 
stakeholder buy-in are all achieved.
u
u Portfolio Value Management (Section 7). Portfolio Value Management enables investment in a portfolio to 
yield the expected return as defined by the organizational strategy. Value contribution and sustainment need to 
be monitored throughout the component execution as well as after component closure.
u
u Portfolio Risk Management (Section 8). Portfolio Risk Management evaluates risks (positive/opportunities, 
negative/threats) at the portfolio level and considers how those risks may impact the achievement of the 
portfolio strategic plan and objectives. This requires consistent monitoring for uncertainty, within both the 
internal and external environment of the portfolio.
1.9 PORTFOLIO COMPONENTS ANd THEIR INTERRELATIONSHIPS
A portfolio is a system or collection of entities—called portfolio components—plus a collection of interrelationships 
among these components. Portfolio components share a common purpose: to achieve the strategic objectives of the 
organization. The portfolio system is managed as an integrated whole relative to the other systems of the organization.
As a portfolio system, the portfolio’s hierarchy results in a parent–child relationship with its portfolio components, just as a 
program has a parent–child relationship with its projects. Consequently, the portfolio components are also managed based on 
standards, such as A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide) and The Standard for Program 
Management, and are periodically measured to gauge the likelihood that the portfolio components will achieve their goals.
A larger portfolio can contain subsidiary portfolios, which in themselves are component collections of programs, 
projects, or operations managed as a group to achieve strategic objectives. Subsidiary portfolios can exist for different 
reasons, including management grouping, available funds, customer requirements, schedule, resources, stakeholders, 
different sponsors, etc.
1.9.1 PrograM ManagEMEnT
Program management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to a program to meet the 
program requirements and to obtain benefits and control not available by managing projects individually. It involves 

12 
The Standard for Portfolio Management – Fourth Edition
aligning multiple components to achieve the program goals and allows for optimized or integrated cost, schedule, 
effort, or other parameters. Although the benefits of a project often arise after the project ends, some benefits can 
appear during the program life cycle as single projects within the program end.
Components within a program are related through a common outcome or delivery of a collective set of benefits. If 
the relationship among the projects is only that of a shared client, seller, technology, resource, etc., the effort should 
be managed as a portfolio of independent projects rather than as a program. In programs, it is important to integrate 
and control the interdependencies among the components. The program manager accomplishes this by working 
within the following five interrelated and interdependent Program Management Performance Domains: Program 
Strategy Alignment, Program Benefits Management, Program Stakeholder Engagement, Program Governance, and 
Program Life Cycle Management. Through structured governance functions and domains, program management 
enables appropriate component interdependencies and helps determine the optimal approach for managing them.
Through structured oversight and governance, program management enables appropriate planning, control, 
delivery, transition, and benefits sustainment across the components within the program to achieve the program’s 
intended strategic benefits. Program management provides a framework for managing related efforts considering key 
factors such as strategic benefits, coordinated planning, complex interdependencies that may create new emergent 
issues and risks, deliverable integration, resource pools, and optimized pacing.
1.9.2 ProjECT ManagEMEnT
Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet 
project requirements by providing the project deliverables. It is accomplished through the appropriate application 
and integration of project management processes identified for the project. The specific project circumstances may 
influence the constraints on which the project manager needs to focus.
Managing a project typically includes:
u
u Identifying, analyzing, documenting, and prioritizing requirements;
u
u Addressing the various needs, concerns, and expectations of the stakeholders as the project is planned and 
carried out;
u
u Setting and maintaining active communication with stakeholders;
u
u Balancing the competing project constraints, which include, but are not limited to, the project’s scope, quality, 
schedule, budget, resources, and risk; and
u
u Successfully producing and handing over the project deliverables.
The relationships among these factors are such that if any one factor changes, at least one other factor is likely 
to be affected. For example, if the schedule is shortened, the budget often needs to be increased to add additional 
resources to complete the same amount of work in less time. When a budget increase is not possible, the scope or 
quality may be reduced to deliver a product or service in less time for the same budget.
Project stakeholders may have differing ideas as to which factors are the most important, creating an even greater 
challenge. Changing the project requirements may create additional risks. The project team should be able to assess 
the situation, balance the demands, and maintain active communication with stakeholders in order to deliver a 
successful project. It is important for the project team to be conscious of how the success of the project fits into the 
organization’s measures of success, which can be conveyed as part of the portfolio management process.

13
Because of the potential for change, the project management plan is iterative and goes through progressive 
elaboration throughout the project’s life cycle. Progressive elaboration involves continuously improving and detailing 
a plan as more detailed and specific information and more accurate estimates become available. Depending on the 
chosen project management framework (predictive, adaptive, or a combination of both), progressive elaboration 
allows a project management team to navigate and adapt to emergent issues and risks, to generate a suitable risk 
response plan, and to manage to a greater level of detail as the project evolves.
1.9.3 oPEraTIonS ManagEMEnT
Operations is the business function responsible for planning, coordinating, resourcing, and controlling the 
repeatable, usually cyclical, day-to-day activities of the organization. This business function is called business as 
usual (BAU). Operations management consists of the various procedures and their assignments. These include roles 
with lines of delegation, levels of authority, and mechanisms to report, escalate, and decide how to achieve the best 
value from the resources available within constraints and risks.
When the ongoing pattern of activity is subject to change (by external factors, for example) or when it may be 
improved by discretionary application of change, then resources within the portfolio are diverted into programs and 
projects. Projects may be further grouped as programs (as a result of a link between their expected benefits or shared 
resources) and into portfolios because of a linkage among any or all of their schedule, resources, stakeholders, or 
strategic objectives.
The portfolio of operational change for projects links a subset of recurring activities managed as projects to the 
organizational strategy. As these activities are executed and deliver results, these underpin the execution of the 
organization’s strategic portfolio components.
The outputs from operations planning and organizational strategy and objectives result in portfolios that guide 
program and project activities. As the portfolio components move into initiation, the respective areas use their 
management practices to manage deliveries. As the portfolio components are executed, portfolio management 
maintains the relationships among them to monitor progress, take corrective action (if needed), and maintain 
alignment with strategic goals. Therefore, at the highest level, strategic and operational portfolio components are 
ultimately managed as a single, comprehensive portfolio of work that is undertaken by the organization. This holistic 
view of change by operations components combined with the organizational change initiatives (program and project 
components) optimize the efficient balance of the organizational resources.
1.10 ROLE OF THE PORTFOLIO MANAGER
Portfolio managers have the responsibility for the establishment and implementation of portfolio management. 
Where program and project managers primarily focus on “doing the work right,” the portfolio manager’s primary 
focus is on “doing the right work,” and portfolio governance enables the “right work” to be performed at the right 
time and with adequate resources allocated. A governing body establishes the governance of portfolios, programs, 
and projects by setting guidelines for them as well as linking them to the organizational strategy and verifying the 
overall results. Furthermore, portfolio managers are responsible for ensuring proper communication and coordination 
among portfolio components.

14 
The Standard for Portfolio Management – Fourth Edition
Portfolio managers often play a number of important roles, quite often those of architect, enabler, and facilitator 
of portfolio management principles, processes, and practices, as well as the role of portfolio analyst. As architects, 
portfolio managers work with their organizational counterparts to evaluate the portfolio management plans, assess 
and define needed skills, design appropriate processes, and adjust these processes accordingly. As enablers, 
portfolio managers may seek ways to continually improve the applied portfolio management processes and 
adjust portfolio components toward better alignment with changes in strategy to ensure continual relevance to 
the organization. As facilitators in execution mode, portfolio managers manage the day-to-day operations of the 
portfolio management processes. This includes:
u
u Conveying to the portfolio governing body how the portfolio components as a whole are aligned and realigned 
with the strategic goals;
u
u Capturing the portfolio impact and value creation against strategic directives;
u
u Providing appropriate recommendations or options for action;
u
u Influencing and managing the process of resource allocation;
u
u Overseeing or coordinating with portfolio component managers on implementation;
u
u Receiving information on portfolio component performance and progress; and
u
u Reporting portfolio progress to top management.
The portfolio manager reviews the portfolio for balance (e.g., short term versus long term or risk versus return) 
and negotiates agreement(s) with relevant strategic stakeholders (e.g., executive management, operations). Portfolio 
managers also sequence portfolio components to account for portfolio component dependencies and their effects, the 
balancing of constrained resources, and other organizational considerations. In addition, portfolio managers ensure 
that timelines for portfolio management processes are maintained and followed and that the managers of portfolio 
components (subsidiary portfolios, programs, projects, and operations) receive and provide the information required 
under the portfolio management processes. Portfolio managers are the primary conduit between managers of portfolio 
components and portfolio stakeholders.
The portfolio manager regularly communicates information and recommends criteria for governance actions and 
decisions, such as deciding when programs and projects should proceed, be reprioritized, be changed to adapt to 
strategic changes, be terminated, or be suspended before the originally planned completion dates. The portfolio 
manager also makes appropriate recommendations to portfolio governing bodies regarding specific directives for 
components and improvement of portfolio practices toward ensuring that the intended value is delivered to the 
organization.
The portfolio manager needs to be aware of how the portfolio is related to the organizational vision, mission, and 
strategic goals, and identify, assess, and measure the business value that the portfolio is adding to the organization’s 
objectives. Throughout the portfolio life cycle, the portfolio manager should be able to manage risks, monitor and 
prioritize portfolio components, resolve issues that need senior-level attention, develop and improve processes, and 
apply organizational knowledge and management skills. In addition, the portfolio manager should be able to effectively 
manage the organization’s resources and provide timely information for stakeholder communication requirements.

15
In order to succeed in this role, the portfolio manager should adhere to the competences depicted by the PMI Talent 
Triangle® (i.e., technical project management skills, leadership capabilities, and strategic and business management 
expertise), be able to form and lead expert teams, and have expertise in all of the following areas:
u
u Portfolio strategic management and alignment. A portfolio manager should understand and monitor 
changes in the organizational strategy and objectives and be aware of how the portfolio supports them. Both 
financial and nonfinancial benefits and risks to the organization need to be considered. The portfolio manager 
should also have business analysis skills as well as financial knowledge.
u
u Portfolio management methods and techniques. The portfolio manager should have expertise in the 
application and analysis of portfolio management methods and techniques that include both qualitative and 
quantitative measures as prescribed or dictated by the organization’s leadership. Further, various portfolio 
management tools can assist with aligning the portfolio components with strategic objectives. Such tools 
provide valuable methods of organizing, prioritizing, and categorizing valuable information regarding the 
performance of portfolio components plus validated reporting to Portfolio Governance.
u
u Stakeholder engagement. An effective portfolio manager should be adept at working with portfolio 
stakeholders to maximize portfolio and organizational performance. A portfolio manager should communicate 
frequently with stakeholders using modes and techniques appropriate for the context. The portfolio manager 
should facilitate communications among stakeholders to negotiate agreements, resolve conflict, and make 
timely and agile portfolio decisions.
u
u Leadership and management skills. An effective portfolio manager should have well-developed leadership 
and management skills and be able to interact with senior executives, management, and other stakeholders. 
Further, a portfolio manager should be adept at managing people through recruitment and retention, goal 
setting, performance evaluation, reward and recognition, succession planning, and employee development, 
and should have highly developed communication skills. Employee development may include mentoring, 
coaching, motivating, and training of personnel.
u
u Risk management. An effective portfolio manager should manage risks that are both internal and external to 
the organization. For risk evaluation, consideration is given to portfolio dynamics, such as fiscal constraints, 
cost-benefit, windows of opportunity, portfolio component constraints, changing portfolio environmental 
conditions (e.g., market change), and stakeholder dynamics.
u
u Organizational change management. An effective portfolio manager should manage the impact of changes 
on the organization. Change readiness is measured at the portfolio, program, and project levels; in each case, 
the level and range of metrics will be different depending, for example, on the system, the technology, the 
stakeholders, the deliverables, the expected benefits, etc. Change readiness can be measured by program and 
project managers, but is better assessed at the portfolio level.
u
u Systems thinking. This approach relates to understanding how different components of the portfolio are 
interrelated and interdependent of one another. It can connote the ability to think through which portfolio 
components should be selected to contribute to the organizational strategy as a “top-down” approach. 
Moreover, systems thinking enhances the capability to visualize the contribution/value added by each of the 
components to the portfolio’s strategic objectives—a “bottom-up” view. A systems approach may facilitate 
the proper selection of necessary components to execute the portfolio, aid with proper resource allocation, 
and ensure that the selected components are aligned toward achieving the business goals of the organization.

The Standard for Portfolio Management – Fourth Edition
1.11 OTHER ROLES IN PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT
This section summarizes additional important roles in portfolio management, including:
u
u Sponsors;
u
u Portfolio governance body;
u
u Portfolio, program, and project management office (PMO)—sometimes a PMO for the whole organization is 
established, often called an enterprise PMO (EPMO);
u
u Portfolio analyst;
u
u Program managers;
u
u Project managers;
u
u Change control board;
u
u Program and project team members; and
u
u Subject matter experts, business analysts, and functional managers in charge of operations included in the 
portfolio.
Some organizations employ a portfolio analyst who works closely with the portfolio manager and the EPMO. The 
responsibilities of the portfolio analyst may be as follows: (a) to identify and track interdependencies between portfolio 
components and facilitate their resolution/management at the portfolio level; and (b) identify portfolio management 
process gaps, recommend improvements, and help implement them. The portfolio analyst role can be combined with 
other roles and tailored to meet organizational needs. Further, a number of organizations have a change control board 
that works, in practice, as a steering committee for projects. In many organizations, splitting responsibilities between 
project sponsors, the project steering committee, and portfolio governance is an important issue.
1.11.1 SPonSorS
A sponsor is a person or group who provides resources and support for the portfolio. If it is a group, then individual 
accountabilities should be clearly defined. The portfolio sponsor usually participates in the portfolio governance body. 
Sponsors are accountable for resource allocation and enabling success. Sponsors champion the approval of portfolio 
and/or portfolio components (projects, programs, subsidiary portfolios, and operations) and are also accountable for 
the ultimate success of the portfolio.
At the portfolio level, a sponsor is a champion of the entire portfolio and should work closely with the portfolio 
manager in the establishment and ongoing management of the portfolio and its processes. Once the portfolio 
component is approved, the sponsor helps the portfolio manager ensure that the components perform according 
to organizational strategy and objectives. Sponsors also support portfolio management to recommend portfolio and 
portfolio component changes or closures to align with organizational strategic changes. Sponsors should be vigilant 
regarding any changes in the portfolio components that might affect the achievement of the strategic objectives 
toward which the portfolio has to be constantly aligned.

17
1.11.2 PorTFolIo goVErnanCE Body
Portfolio governance is the framework, functions, and processes established by the governing body and set by the 
organization to guide portfolio management activities and make decisions about investments and priorities for the 
portfolio and ensure that the portfolio management processes are followed to sustain the organization. Leadership and 
sponsorship from the portfolio governance body are essential for the portfolio manager. The portfolio governing body 
is made up of one or more individuals with the requisite authority, knowledge, and experience to ensure the alignment 
of portfolio components with organizational strategy. Sometimes, portfolio governance is performed by subgroups 
that have specific responsibilities toward portfolio governance (e.g., selection/prioritization of portfolio components, 
investment decisions, oversteering portfolio progress, a change review board to decide on change proposals). This 
governing body usually has the authority to evaluate the portfolio performance and to make resourcing, investment, 
and priority decisions as needed. Change recommendations may include new portfolio components, the suspension 
or change of existing portfolio components, and the reallocation of resources among portfolio components. The 
recommendations may be complex, with significant organizational constraints, especially concerning reallocation 
of resources. Often, portfolio governance does not only make the recommendations, but is also responsible for their 
approval process. Portfolio governance is paramount to portfolio decision making; it informs and guides decisions 
related to strategic alignment, investments, and the setting of priorities. Proper governance is essential and crucial to 
enforce accountability, optimize investments, escalate issues to decision makers, and improve communication.
1.11.3 PorTFolIo, PrograM, and/or ProjECT ManagEMEnT oFFICE
The term PMO refers to a portfolio, program, and/or project management office. The PMO supports portfolio, 
program, or project functions, respectively. At the portfolio level, a PMO, which may be referred to as an enterprise 
PMO (EPMO) or center of excellence, is an organizational entity that provides a wide variety of capabilities and 
processes supporting portfolio management. These may include some or all of the following:
u
u Identifying, analyzing, coordinating, negotiating, monitoring, and controlling portfolio components; supporting 
component proposals and evaluations; facilitating prioritization; authorization; termination of components; and 
facilitating the allocation of resources in alignment with organizational strategy and objectives;
u
u Developing and maintaining portfolio, program, and project frameworks and methodologies;
u
u Managing knowledge regarding the project management discipline, including good practices and lessons 
learned;
u
u Providing program and project progress information and metric reporting utilizing key performance indicators 
(KPIs) (e.g., expenditure, defects, resources) to the portfolio governance process;
u
u Managing, including monitoring and controlling, such as regulatory/governance compliance and benefit 
realization across the entire portfolio;
u
u Assisting with risk strategy development and risk identification, and communicating risks and issues related 
to portfolio components;
u
u Coordinating communication across portfolio components; and
u
u Developing and conducting training and mentoring of human resources in portfolio management skills, tools, 
and techniques.

18 
The Standard for Portfolio Management – Fourth Edition
The portfolio management office has a focused and specific responsibility for the centralized management and 
coordination of the portfolios that lie within its domain. The responsibilities of this office may range from providing 
portfolio support functions to actually managing the portfolio—usually, in this case, the portfolio manager is also 
the head of the PMO. The structure and function of the portfolio management office vary with the needs of the 
organization—for example, the PMO life cycle, the PMO model, and the PMO critical success factors.
The portfolio management office may act as a stakeholder throughout the portfolio’s life cycle and may recommend 
the selection, termination, or initiation of actions necessary to ensure that the portfolio remains aligned with the 
organization’s strategic objectives.
The portfolio management office may provide the following services to a project or program management office:
u
u Defining and developing the portfolio management strategy;
u
u Providing portfolio oversight and managing the overall portfolio value and portfolio component benefits;
u
u Defining portfolio vision and mission statements; management structure; and methodology, best practices, 
and standards for use as guidelines while formulating the methodology and standards for project and program 
management;
u
u Aggregating and providing performance results of the portfolio components based on predefined metrics;
u
u Identifying risks, analyzing risks, and planning risk responses at the portfolio level; and
u
u Forecasting supply and demand for the portfolio and optimizing the portfolio resource allocation. Thus, supply 
and demand are analyzed and broken down for each portfolio component.
The roles, responsibilities, and activities of a project or program management office are addressed in the relevant 
PMI standards: A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide) [1] and The Standard for 
Program Management [2].

Program managers are responsible for ensuring that the overall program structure and program management 
processes align with the portfolio management plan. The program manager ensures that the program delivers 
the intended benefits. Detailed information on program management may be found in The Standard for Program 
Management.
Portfolio management supports the program manager by providing the information needed to make decisions that 
guide the program and by providing administrative support in managing schedules, budgets, risks, and other areas 
required for effective program management. A program manager works with the portfolio manager, the portfolio 
management team, and/or the portfolio management office to provide information such as program performance 
against goals.

19
1.11.5 ProjECT ManagErS
Project managers are responsible for the effective initiation, planning, execution, monitoring and controlling, and 
closing of assigned projects within the portfolio in accordance with corresponding objectives and specifications. 
Program and project team members fulfill specific roles toward the successful execution of each portfolio component. 
Detailed information on project management may be found in A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge 
(PMBOK® Guide). Project managers provide project performance indicators, directly or indirectly, to the portfolio 
manager, PMO, or governing body. This information is used along with other criteria to monitor progress for each 
portfolio component and derive overall portfolio progress, issues, assumptions, and risk emerging from component 
dependencies. Moreover, such information is valuable for determining which projects should proceed, be modified, be 
suspended, or be terminated, and to communicate with stakeholders. Further to the key management roles within the 
portfolio framework listed in Section 1.11, the operational managers of each organization have the role of realizing 
the outcomes and benefits from the successfully implemented portfolio components.

THE PORTFOLIO LIFE CYCLE
This section provides information on the portfolio life cycle. The following major sections are addressed:
2.1 Overview
2.2 Guiding Principles
2.3 Ongoing Life Cycle
2.4 Portfolio Management Information System (PMIS)
2.5 Governance Within the Portfolio Life Cycle
2.1 OVERVIEW
The portfolio life cycle is the ongoing processes and functions that occur to a set of portfolios, programs, projects, and 
operations within a continuous time frame. In today’s global market, the portfolio life cycle needs to be adaptive and flexible 
to constantly changing needs from all influences, internal and external, so organizations can remain competitive and 
financially stable. One or more portfolios can exist within the life cycle. If several portfolios exist, they can be centralized or 
decentralized in terms of management within the governance structure in place. For example, a research and development 
portfolio could be decentralized while another portfolio may be managed centrally. The controls required to manage 
a portfolio should be flexible to adapt to the complexities of multiple portfolio scenarios. Selection and authorization of 
portfolio components can be part of the periodic (e.g., annual) planning or strategic review, with quarterly and/or monthly 
updates. Once established, portfolio management is an ongoing practice. Performance monitoring of the portfolio(s) is 
ongoing. Adjustments to the portfolio components may be required when changes to the organization occur. Portfolio 
management starts with the initiation of each portfolio and may continue indefinitely or until the portfolio is closed.
Strategic planning, organizational performance metrics, and product and service design are all critical elements as 
inputs into the portfolio life cycle. Underlying these inputs is a thorough understanding of the portfolio’s value to the 
organization. Defining the value derived from the portfolio’s functions, products, and services from all perspectives 
(organization, customers, additional stakeholders) helps eliminate non-value-added programs, projects, or activities. 
The value stream should be mapped to understand which value-added programs, projects, and activities are essential 
to enterprise strategic objectives, and conversely, which are of little or no benefit.
2.2 GuIdING PRINCIPLES
The guiding portfolio management principles described in Section 1.7 of this standard influence all stages of 
the portfolio life cycle. Specific impacts from principles within individual stages of the life cycle are mentioned in 
Sections 2.3 through 2.5.

22 
The Standard for Portfolio Management – Fourth Edition
2.3 ONGOING LIFE CYCLE
A portfolio’s continuous life cycle consists of several stages: initiation, planning, execution, and optimization. As a 
portfolio progresses through its life cycle, information and decisions are passed within and between each of these 
stages (see Figure 2-1). This is ongoing and not necessarily sequential. For example, a portfolio could undergo several 
iterations of planning and then proceed to execution within a short time frame based on a number of factors, both 
internal and external. Within the same business change life cycle, the portfolio can be “refreshed” with the addition or 
deletion/modification of the portfolio components. Replanning can occur when the portfolio mix is reviewed at the end 
of each business change life cycle when a top-down alignment is taken into account. All stages within the portfolio, 
including initiation, are adaptable, flexible, and fluid. As management decisions are made within the portfolio life cycle, 
the portfolio can be changed and updated to adapt to internal and external factors. For example, if a new government 
regulation comes into effect after periodic planning, the portfolio management team may have to adjust management 
plans to align to the new regulatory requirements. Figure 2-2 shows an example of major activities that are likely to 
occur by each stage.

Portfolio Life Cycle Example — Major Activities by Stages (Ongoing)
Figure 2-2. Example of Portfolio Life Cycle Major Activities
Supportive processes are organization specific, utilized to keep the portfolio aligned with governance controls and 
measures. These supportive processes include communications, financial, risk, and dependency management. They 
are defined and aligned to the portfolio during the initiation phase. Dependency management is primarily focused 
on the impact to and from portfolio components caused by various factors, such as resource and time constraints, 
financial costs, project outcomes, and risk profiles.

24 
The Standard for Portfolio Management – Fourth Edition
2.3.1 InITIaTIon
Initiation is an important stage. It is kicked off or informed by the formal release of business and/or organizational 
objectives and goals or to provide the management structure for previously disparate components. It sets the approach 
and principles for major processes that define how the portfolio and its components will be managed throughout the 
life cycle. The primary goals of this stage include, but are not limited to:
u
u Validating business and operational strategy;
u
u Identifying the portfolio components included in the scope; and
u
u Defining a long-term roadmap with financial goals, performance metrics, communications, governance, 
stakeholders’ definition and roles, and ongoing management plans for the portfolio and its components.
During this stage, the following key processes are first discussed and set up: governance framework, 
communications planning, prioritization criteria, portfolio performance metrics, and portfolio risk management. The 
portfolio governance plan and charter are created, as detailed in Section 3. Discussions occur regarding how the 
strategy of the organization ties to the portfolio and its components at a high level.
2.3.2 PlannIng
The primary goals of the planning stage are to develop the portfolio management plan and reach agreement on:
u
u Management of portfolio components in scope;
u
u Budgeting required to successfully execute components;
u
u Identification of interdependencies between portfolios and their components;
u
u Identification of risks and issues, and development of response plans;
u
u Resourcing requirements (human, financial, asset, and intellectual);
u
u Prioritization of portfolio components;
u
u Confirmation of governance body/sponsor and stakeholder accountability;
u
u Portfolio metrics to measure success (financial and nonfinancial);
u
u Scope of components within the portfolio; and
u
u Product and/or services requirements and specifications.
During periodic portfolio strategic planning, the portfolio business model is revisited to ensure that it is in alignment 
with customer values/benefits and business/organizational strategic goals. Initial optimization of the portfolio occurs 
as a result, because the portfolio is formally aligned to strategy during this phase. Portfolio metrics are reviewed 
to ensure that they are tied to realistic goals/objectives at the customer, strategic, and financial levels. Existing 
components agreed upon during the initiation stage are reviewed in more detail, including scope, timing, budget, risks 
involved, resourcing requirements (human, financial, asset, and intellectual), and interdependencies.

25
Additionally, the prioritization criteria are reviewed based on new components introduced and their performance 
since the last strategic review. Changes are proposed and reviewed based on these criteria. Capital needs are 
compared against available funding and demand, and resource capacity plans are set based on the needs of the 
portfolio. During replanning, the portfolio is reviewed again. Components, including subsidiary portfolios, are revised 
based on the needs of the organization. Finally, portfolio management plan(s) are reviewed and updated based on the 
relevant status of components at this time, as well as overall portfolio risks and/or issues.
2.3.3 EXECuTIon
The primary goals of the execution stage are to:
u
u Lead delivery of all components within each portfolio,
u
u Actively manage and resolve risk and issues across (interdependencies) and within the portfolio and its 
components,
u
u Facilitate portfolio and component communication (including status reporting at various levels),
u
u Reprioritize and change subsidiary portfolios as needed (monitor and control),
u
u Monitor benefits realization potential based on component delivery, and
u
u Manage portfolio assets and resources limited to the portfolio.
Portfolio execution is performed through its various components and operations. The health of the portfolio is 
reported through regular status reports and by reviewing the component performance metrics that were established 
during the planning phase. Proposed changes are reviewed based on ongoing organizational needs. Changes in the 
organizational environment may necessitate the reprioritization of components or the introduction of new components 
into the portfolio. These new components are reviewed as required based on unplanned critical needs (internal or 
external) or positive outcomes of proofs of concept, pilots, or feasibility studies.
2.3.4 oPTIMIzaTIon
Optimization is the process of making a portfolio as effective as possible by maximizing available conditions, 
constraints, and resources. Typically, the primary goal of portfolio optimization is to ensure that the available human, 
material, and financial resources are best applied to the appropriate remaining components of the portfolio. Although 
some organizations schedule regular optimization sessions, typically this activity is triggered when components are 
added or closed. During this stage, the portfolio manager facilitates discussions with stakeholders to ensure that the 
organization realizes the intended benefits for the remaining components.
While lessons learned for each of the closed components is not a part of this process, the results might add value to 
the discussion. Similarly, benefits realization from components that have been transitioned into the operational work 
of the organization may also provide credible evidence for optimization.

26 
The Standard for Portfolio Management – Fourth Edition
2.3.5 MonITor and ConTrol
Monitor and control is one of the critical supportive activities for monitoring portfolio performance and recommending 
changes to the portfolio component mix and portfolio component performance and compliance with organizational 
standards. The purpose of monitor and control is to understand when changes need to be made to the portfolio or 
to the portfolio management processes. This process includes execution, documentation, and communication of the 
decisions and the resulting actions taken.
2.4 PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PMIS)
The portfolio management information system (PMIS) consists of the tools and techniques used to gather, integrate, 
visualize, preserve, and disseminate the outputs of organizational portfolio management. It is used to support all 
aspects of portfolio management, may be integrated with business management tools (the organization’s enterprise 
resource planning system, the business process management system, tools to measure and optimize business 
processes, process modeling tools, etc.), and may be a manual or automated process depending on the needs of the 
organization.
These systems support overall organizational visibility, standardization, measurement, and process improvement, 
and can facilitate effective decision making by providing executive management with key performance metrics and 
target collection, analysis, and reporting. The PMIS is a powerful tool for portfolio governance, because it provides 
transparency and clarifies responsibility and accountability within the portfolio.
Automated tools may include commercial project portfolio management (PPM) applications as well as an 
information gathering and administration system with interfaces to other organizational automated systems. The 
PMIS is sometimes a collection of spreadsheets rather than automated tools during the early stages of organizational 
maturity. An effective PMIS enables the portfolio manager to define, analyze, design, produce, collect, and integrate 
necessary data elements to manage and support a successful portfolio. It provides an integrated system solution for 
reporting all project-based work and may be interconnected with the management information system of the whole 
organization. The PMIS includes tools and processes such as:
u
u Portfolio categorization with components, dependencies, owners, and other stakeholders, etc.;
u
u Centralized dashboard for executive reporting of management decision making (key performance metrics agreed 
to track);
u
u Software automation tools to replace manual processes;
u
u Centralized online document repository and version control;
u
u Change or configuration management;
u
u Workflow management and documentation of escalation communication;
u
u Historical and current information on portfolio risks, issues, assumptions, and dependencies;
u
u Integration with other applications and integrated business process management tools;
u
u Financial management processes and systems (e.g., budget tracking), cost control and schedule control 
processes and systems (e.g., earned value management), and enterprise resource planning tools (including 
capabilities, costs, and schedule);

27
u
u Risk database and associated analysis tools;
u
u Issues database and associated analysis tools;
u
u Communications management processes and tools; and
u
u Business process management tools.
It should be noted that integration among all management tools plays an important part toward validated, 
consolidated communication of information and knowledge for the whole organization.
The PMIS needs to be a comprehensive, documented, dynamic set of policies, processes, tools, plans, and controls 
for portfolio management. When properly implemented, the PMIS provides direction and integrates information from 
individual project/program management systems. The use of an effective PMIS provides a way to routinely analyze 
and quantify the value added by each portfolio component and provides input for portfolio component valuation and 
prioritization.
Specifically, the PMIS allows portfolio managers to answer questions, such as the following:
u
u Which portfolio components will best support the organization’s business strategies and goals?
u
u Is there a program or project that provides the anticipated business results, as demonstrated by portfolio 
metrics?
u
u Does each portfolio component have appropriate resources, including staff with the right skill sets?
u
u Does the PMIS reflect the real overall status of the portfolio and is it the ultimate source for decision making?
A comprehensive PMIS should support processes that address continuing performance challenges for ongoing 
portfolio components as well as processes that concentrate on the portfolio’s evolution, including the selection of new 
projects and portfolio component termination procedures.
2.5 GOVERNANCE WITHIN THE PORTFOLIO LIFE CYCLE
Developing the portfolio governance framework, which is an integral part of organizational governance, early in the 
portfolio life cycle is a crucial step. It can be one of the most important decisions that an organization makes.
To determine the rigor and level of portfolio governance needed in an organization, there are several factors to 
consider, including:
u
u Types of components within the portfolio and the required number of subsidiary portfolios;
u
u Legal or regulatory programs and projects, which typically need firm governance;
u
u Level of administration resources to support the governance (documentation, communication, and internal 
audit processes);
u
u Agility required to adapt the portfolio to frequently changing market needs, technological changes, etc., based 
on the nature of an organization’s business strategy at specific points in time;
u
u Centralized versus decentralized governance required based on the size and scope of an organization 
(i.e., global, domestic, or local only);

28 
The Standard for Portfolio Management – Fourth Edition
u
u Location of governance and resources (processes, integrated tools and techniques, good practices) required 
for the successful execution of portfolio components;
u
u Audits consisting of the regular review of portfolio components, both internal and external (e.g., government 
or legal agencies); and
u
u Performance metrics, including financial, nonfinancial, and portfolio-focused.
The level of complexity introduced by the portfolio components has to be investigated, and complexity navigation 
based on a standardized framework should be planned and followed as part of the portfolio governance framework.
Developing the portfolio governance framework early in the portfolio life cycle is crucial. The portfolio components’ 
governance frameworks need to be aligned to portfolio governance. It is much more effective to set up the governance 
correctly from the start with the optimal level of rigor and without major delays to achieve the maximum benefit for 
portfolio components that already exist. Some examples of governance delay could be related to ineffective portfolio 
management or a lack of engagement from senior management stakeholders to ensure that the governance in place 
is comprehensive. Downstream impacts of such challenges could include communication gaps, financial/resource 
priority conflicts, or poor risk management. The governance of portfolios is further discussed in Section 4 of this 
standard.

PORTFOLIO STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT
Portfolio Strategic Management is the management of intended and emergent initiatives that are often identified 
at an executive level and provide the very fabric under which portfolio management is executed. It supports strategic 
thinking and is the basis for an effective organization or business unit. Strategic thinking simply means asking, “Are 
we doing the right thing?” More precisely, it means assessing whether the right thing is being done using three key 
requirements:
u
u A profound understanding of the associated environment(s),
u
u Full alignment of all portfolio components with the vision and values of the organization, and
u
u Creativity in developing effective responses to forces and changes that affect the fulfillment of that purpose.
In the context of a portfolio, strategic thinking is captured in the strategic portfolio management plan.
This section provides information on Portfolio Strategic Management. The following major sections are addressed:
3.1 Overview
3.2 Guiding Principles
3.3 Portfolio Strategic Objectives
3.4 developing Portfolio Strategic Objectives
3.5 Strategic Risk Appetite
3.6 Portfolio Charter
3.7 Portfolio Roadmap
3.8 Key Portfolio Components
3.9 Portfolio Optimization
3.10 Managing Strategic Alignment
3.1 OVERVIEW
Alignment of strategic management and portfolio management enables the actions of an organization to be 
consistent with the expectations of senior management and stakeholders. Without this, there is a high risk that 
a portfolio will not match the overall strategy and that the programs/projects being undertaken will add little or 
no value—certainly less value than is expected. Portfolio Strategic Management should be considered a two-way 
process. In addition to the continual monitoring of strategy and investment decisions at the executive level, the 
practice should provide feedback on the impact and viability of such strategic decisions and potential outcomes.

30 
The Standard for Portfolio Management – Fourth Edition
3.2 GuIdING PRINCIPLES
To successfully manage a portfolio, a strategic approach that is mindful of the organization’s strategic plan, 
goals, and objectives needs to be undertaken. Unlike what is done in program or project management, in strategic 
management, the portfolio manager needs to maintain a long-term vision in order to execute sound practices of 
decision making, risk management, and value management, among other organizational considerations. All of the 
principles outlined in Section 1.7 are important for strategic management. However, the following are especially 
applicable to this domain:
u
u Achieve excellence in strategic execution.
u
u Ensure that investments in portfolio components are aligned with the organization’s strategy and governance 
practices.
u
u Balance portfolio value against overall risks.
u
u Foster a culture that embraces change and risk.
u
u Navigate complexity to enable successful outcomes.
u
u Continuously acquire talent and implement professional talent management.
Strategic management not only oversees the performance of the portfolio components, it also plays an important 
role in providing feedback to all stakeholders on the success of the organization’s strategies and the viability of its 
long-term goals and objectives.
3.3 PORTFOLIO STRATEGIC ObjECTIVES
The portfolio strategic planning process consists of developing a portfolio strategic plan and aligning the strategic 
management of the portfolio to the organizational strategy and objectives. The portfolio strategic plan explains the key 
components of the portfolio management life cycle, describing the key initiation decisions, planning criteria, governance 
and optimization considerations, and execution elements. The portfolio strategic plan is used to align organizational 
and financial structure with priorities, mission, and objectives. Typically, a portfolio strategic plan includes a vision and 
a mission statement, a description of the organization’s long-term portfolio goals and objectives, and the means by 
which the organization plans to achieve these general goals and objectives. The portfolio strategic plan should also 
provide performance indicators and target metrics to allow assessment of ongoing strategic alignment and tracking 
of progress toward achieving the strategic objectives. The portfolio strategic plan may also identify external factors 
that may affect the achievement of long-term portfolio goals.
When defining the portfolio structure, it is important to understand the overall strategy to ensure that the right 
components within those business areas with the highest strategic value are included. It is also important to ensure 
that every goal of the portfolio strategic plan has at least one initiative that would lead to its realization, and that the 
summation of the initiatives’ outcomes under a specific strategic goal lead to 100% realization of that strategic goal’s 
benefits. Therefore, an organization’s portfolios should cover 100% of the organization’s strategic goals—and only 
the organization’s strategic goals—meaning that any initiatives that do not serve a specific strategic goal should be 
terminated.

31
Evaluating and describing how the portfolio management activity will be aligned with the overall strategy is 
what defines the portfolio strategic plan based on process, actions, and elements that support this evaluation and 
its implementation. The process, actions, and elements include things such as portfolio management objectives, 
prioritization, allocation of funds, organizational benefits, performance expectations, resources, assumptions, 
constraints, dependencies, risks, and requirements.
Additionally, managing a portfolio is not a specific and time-bound process, so the expected results of the portfolio 
are not bound to its components, but instead to what they deliver in terms of results.
The portfolio strategic plan is produced using organizational strategy, vision, and objectives. The portfolio manager 
collaborates with management in the governing bodies and with key stakeholders in the development of the plan. The 
portfolio strategic plan may support the strategy for the organization, organizational unit, or function.
Organizational strategy is implemented through portfolio components and ongoing operations. When producing 
the portfolio strategic plan, the portfolio manager integrates and responds to changes in the portfolio while remaining 
aligned with the organizational strategy, vision, and objectives.
3.4 dEVELOPING PORTFOLIO STRATEGIC ObjECTIVES
At their broadest, strategic objectives serve to define an organization’s ambition in some detail. An organization’s 
ambition is found in its mission and vision statements, which together describe the main purpose of an organization 
and its ultimate goal. They are the steps and accomplishments that an organization completes to realize that 
ultimate goal.
Strategic objectives form the backbone of a strategic plan. They represent specific, short-term actions (1 to 2 years) 
that are the result of the vision (typically 5 or more years) and goals (usually, 3 or more years).
A strategic objective statement should outline what is to be achieved and the overall approach that will be taken 
to achieve it (and the benefit of achieving it), and should focus on what is offered to customers. The critical elements 
in a strategic objective are measurability and clarity. Crucially, the strategic objective is guided by the organization’s 
mission.
3.4.1 VISIon and MISSIon STaTEMEnTS
Vision and mission statements should be single thoughts that can be easily understood. The strategic vision 
statement describes where the business sees itself based on the chosen strategy. The strategic mission statement 
explains the overall approach for achieving this vision.
To test the effectiveness of a mission statement, associated leaders, managers, and employees should be able to 
easily describe the vision and mission of the business in simple terms. If they cannot articulate the vision or mission, 
then the statement is of little use. The vision and mission guide the everyday activities of every person involved in the 
business. To be effective, the statements need to be short and simple, capturing the essence of what the business 
wishes to accomplish.

32 
The Standard for Portfolio Management – Fourth Edition
The vision and mission statements build the whole culture of the organization. The difference between a vision 
statement and a mission statement is this: A vision is what the company aspires to BE, and a mission is what the 
company is in business to DO. A vision statement is an inspirational mental picture of the value the organization 
hopes to achieve over time, regardless of changes in leadership. It offers a shared view of the future that excites 
employees. A mission statement tells WHAT the company is currently in business to DO, WHO it does it for, and HOW. 
It defines an organization’s present state and its approach for the next few years. Mission statements may get refined 
as customers and their needs change. All employees should be able to articulate an organization’s mission statement 
so they can see how their work aligns with and valuably contributes to this mission. It also helps them understand and 
accept organization-wide decisions.
A sample vision statement might be: “Our vision is a world without cancer.”
A sample mission statement might be: “Our mission is to deliver outstanding value by providing high-quality fishing 
gear to satisfy the needs of our customers, and to do so at the lowest possible cost.”
3.4.2 STraTEgIC goalS
Goals are general statements indicating what is to be achieved, so they should be integrated with the vision. Goals 
are more qualitative statements rather than quantifiable targets, and they also need to be integrated with the mission, 
which describes how the organization will achieve its vision. Some examples of strategic goals are to:
u
u Capture a bigger market share,
u
u Enter a new market,
u
u Comply with regulatory requirements,
u
u Improve profitability,
u
u Increase efficiency,
u
u Provide better customer service,
u
u Improve employee training, and
u
u Improve customer satisfaction.
A strategic goal should be all of the following:
u
u understandable. Is it stated simply and easy to understand?
u
u Suitable. Does it fit with the vision and mission?
u
u Acceptable. Does it fit with the values of the organization and the employees?
u
u Flexible. Can it be adapted and changed as needed?
Strategic goals should always center on the most important priorities of the organization to avoid losing focus, and 
they should be designed in such a way that they don’t contradict or interfere with one another.

33
3.4.3 STraTEgIC oBjECTIVES
Whereas the vision describes the goal, a strategy is a choice about how to reach that goal. Strategic objectives can, 
therefore, be split into categories—for example:
u
u Profitability,
u
u Compliance,
u
u Financial resources,
u
u Market position,
u
u Legal or regulatory conformance,
u
u Innovation,
u
u Productivity,
u
u Physical resources,
u
u Human resources,
u
u Social responsibility,
u
u Value creation, or
u
u Customer satisfaction.
Strategic objectives should be selected to address the major challenges and drivers of the performing organization 
or business unit. To make strategic objectives manageable and actionable, their number should be limited. Once the 
strategic objectives are identified, they should be validated using the following basic criteria:
u
u Is the objective feasible and achievable?
u
u Is the objective measurable and verifiable?
u
u Is the objective adaptable and flexible?
u
u Is the objective consistent with the rest of the strategic plan?
One example of a strategic objective could be to increase market share by 10% with respect to the previous year’s 
figures in a specific geographic area within the next 6 months.
3.4.4 STraTEgIC InITIaTIVES
Organizations execute their strategies through the creation of strategic initiatives, comprising portfolios of programs 
and projects to achieve a future state. The process of defining strategic initiatives from the organizational strategy 
needs to be elaborated. This can include elements of strategic gap analysis, application of a balanced scorecard, and 
similar techniques to select the initial components and group them under subsidiary portfolios.

34 
The Standard for Portfolio Management – Fourth Edition
The portfolio components may not necessarily be interdependent or have related objectives. An organization may 
have more than one portfolio, each addressing unique organizational strategies and objectives. Proposed initiatives 
may be structured as portfolios, and components are identified, evaluated, selected, and authorized. Managing the 
necessary changes should be an integral part of planning initiatives. Strategic initiatives comprised of programs and 
projects move the organization toward that future state. The set of initiatives frequently involves a combination of one 
or more of the following:
u
u New products or services,
u
u New business models,
u
u New capabilities,
u
u New markets and channels,
u
u New value creation opportunities, and
u
u Breakthrough platforms.
3.5 STRATEGIC RISK APPETITE
An organization’s strategic risk appetite is defined as the amount and type of risk that an organization is willing to 
take in order to meet its strategic objectives. Organizations have different risk appetites depending on their organization, 
culture, and underlying strategic drivers, as well as the individual risk appetites of their senior managers. A range of 
risk appetites may exist for different risk categories, and these appetites and/or risks may change over time.
Determination of strategic risk appetite should be a core consideration in the approach to enterprise risk 
management. A properly communicated, appropriate risk appetite statement can help organizations achieve goals 
and support sustainability. Organizations need to take some risks (threats) and avoid others and similarly exploit some 
opportunities and ignore others. Some organizations may find it easier than others to define performance standards, 
but it is necessary for boards in all sectors to do so if they wish to express their risk appetite meaningfully. This 
question may be easier to answer for a commercial organization than for a government organization, but it can usually 
be addressed by boards in many organizations.
Risk threshold constraints are not easy to define—every organization can tolerate different levels of risk. It 
is important, however, for the organization to establish a common understanding of risk and be prepared for the 
likelihood and impact of known threats. Organizations should define the maximum level of risk tolerance for each 
area of risk before taking action.
In order to manage risk effectively, the organization needs to determine what level of risk exposure is acceptable 
in pursuit of the strategic objectives. This is defined by measurable risk thresholds that reflect the risk appetite of the 
organization and other portfolio stakeholders. Risk thresholds express the degree of acceptable variation around a 
strategic objective. The risk appetite statement should be based on a review of the perspectives and concerns of all 
stakeholders and should address the implications of current organizational strategies and practices.

35
3.6 PORTFOLIO CHARTER
A portfolio charter is the document that formally authorizes the portfolio manager to apply resources to the portfolio 
components and should be present with every occurrence of formal portfolio strategic planning. The charter provides 
the portfolio structure, including the hierarchy and organization of the portfolio, programs, projects, and operations. It 
forecasts how and when the portfolio will deliver value to the organization. Chartering a portfolio links the portfolio to 
the organizational strategy and other portfolios and describes how the portfolio will deliver value to the organization. 
The charter may include portfolio objectives, portfolio justification, portfolio sponsor(s), portfolio management roles 
and responsibilities, key and major stakeholders, stakeholder expectations and requirements, communication 
requirements, high-level scope, benefits, critical success criteria, resources, high-level timeline, and assumptions, 
constraints, dependencies, risks, and related organizational strategic objectives.
In creating the portfolio charter, the following elements should be taken into account:
u
u Portfolio strategic plan. When developing the portfolio charter and defining the portfolio structure, it is 
important to be guided by the portfolio strategic plan. The information in the portfolio strategic plan that 
is necessary for developing the portfolio charter includes the portfolio vision and objectives; the benefits 
expected; and the key risks, dependencies, and constraints.
Within the portfolio strategic plan, the prioritization model is useful as a decision framework to structure the 
portfolio components.
u
u Portfolio process assets. To develop the portfolio charter, the portfolio manager should leverage the portfolio’s 
plans, policies, procedures, and guidelines, and any existing documentation of stakeholder relationships, 
scope, benefits, and portfolio goals.
u
u Enterprise environmental factors. Enterprise environmental factors may consist of organizational, 
environmental, and governmental variables that may contribute to and constrain the process of developing 
the portfolio charter. The portfolio structure in the charter may need to align with the organizational accounting 
structure or with the functional structure of the organization (e.g., by organizational unit or business unit).
3.7 PORTFOLIO ROAdMAP
The portfolio roadmap is a visual, high-level artifact (e.g., usually a graphical representation) that details how the 
portfolio(s) and its relevant components are tied to the strategic goals of the organization. The roadmap should be 
updated at least in every portfolio reoptimization and approval period and/or when major changes are made to the 
portfolio. An example is shown in Figure 3-1.

3.8 KEY PORTFOLIO COMPONENTS
A portfolio is built using a set of subsidiary portfolios, programs, projects, and operational activities managed in 
a coordinated way, improving their effectiveness to provide the expected result for the organization. The portfolio 
components may not necessarily be interdependent, nor are they necessarily executed at the same time. To enable 
effective management of the portfolio, the results (expected or realized) of its components should be measured, 
ranked, and prioritized.
The size of the portfolio’s set of components will differ for each portfolio, or it can change during the existence of 
the portfolio. To be effective in delivering the expected portfolio results (and in a resource-constrained environment), it 
is important to limit or maintain a manageable number of components within the capabilities of the organization. A key 
component in a portfolio is one that contributes in a highly significant manner to the realization of the desired benefits. 
To improve the effectiveness of the portfolio, it is important to establish what the key components of the portfolio are. 
Once those key components are identified, the portfolio management team should assess its own effort on managing 
them and take actions to improve its overall organization.

37
3.8.1 EValuaTIng PorTFolIo KEy CoMPonEnTS
The evaluation process may take place on a regular basis. It is performed by reviewing the current set of 
components included in the portfolio and selecting and evaluating those that are important for the portfolio’s overall 
results. The process of defining the key portfolio components requires profound knowledge of the strategic objectives 
and the portfolio’s contribution to them based on the portfolio’s current internal and external environment. Therefore, 
identifying the key components of the portfolio is dependent on reviewing and updating the main strategic objectives 
of the organization and the portfolio.
The evaluation process can be triggered by several activities. The most common ones are:
u
u A change becomes necessary in the organizational strategy and objectives because of internal or external 
factors;
u
u A gap forms between the overall expected portfolio results and the actual results;
u
u An ongoing key component is delayed, closed, or has a major change on its validated plans;
u
u A new portfolio component is validated; and
u
u A new opportunity (e.g., a new technology) has emerged.
Besides the contribution value of the component, there are other factors that need to be evaluated in order to define 
a key component for a portfolio. Among them are the following:
u
u Realization factors. These include cost, duration, resource capacity, expected results, complexity, organizational 
resistance to change, and so forth.
u
u Organization’s objective-oriented factors. These represent the ratio between the positive and the negative 
effect on strategic objectives being impacted, the ease of assessing results, visibility, and the results realization 
timeline.
u
u External factors. These include contribution to the organization’s image; contribution to the healthiness of the 
community, country, and world; and resistance to change from the surrounding community.
The evaluation of key portfolio variables is a process often overlooked when a key component is evaluated, even 
though these variables are often determining factors in the success of portfolio management.
Each component potentially has a negative impact on other objectives. For example, a key component could be to 
develop a state-of-the-art marketing campaign that will positively impact the organization’s image and benefits. At 
the same time, the efficiency objective of the organization will be negatively impacted by this component because 
there is a threat due to the uniqueness of the expected result. Or, an organization may have an efficiency objective that 
can be attained with a lean project, but, at the same time, the realization of this project could have a negative effect 
on the quality of the work environment or may create a resistance to change that will override the expected benefits.
3.8.2 SElECTIng PorTFolIo KEy CoMPonEnTS
The selection of key components is crucial in portfolio success. The effectiveness of the choice of the main 
components largely depends on the visibility and management process of the organization’s strategic objectives 
in relation to the portfolio. Without this information, the portfolio may not define which components are important, 
because the portfolio has no quantifiable expectations.

38 
The Standard for Portfolio Management – Fourth Edition
Validating the portfolio against the organizational strategy helps ensure that the two are in alignment. Proposed 
portfolio components or current inventory of work either not aligned with the overall strategy or deemed unlikely to 
deliver intended value are not recommended for inclusion in the portfolio, except as unfunded backlog components. 
When a current component is found to no longer be the best fit in a portfolio, it is likewise closed. This helps maximize the 
return on investment of resources (e.g., human, financial, asset, intellectual). Factors to consider include the following:
u
u Organizational strategy and objectives. The organizational strategy and objectives provide long-term direction, 
vision, goals, and objectives. The input can also be an organizational strategic plan document that contains the 
vision, mission, strategy, and objectives, with various levels of detail, depending upon the purpose and scope of 
the plan within the organization.
u
u Inventory of work. An organization may not have a portfolio that is a prioritized list of components. However, it 
may have an inventory of work that could develop into a portfolio. The list of portfolio components or inventory 
of work needs to be aligned with the organization’s strategic objectives to ensure that they are valid and able 
to meet the objectives for which they were created. Component interdependencies should also be clearly 
understood and documented, as an efficient portfolio typically includes as many interdependencies as practical 
to minimize the effort to meet component objectives. For example, a derivative product may rely on both 
the earlier generation’s manufacturing process and the demonstrated feasibility of a key subsystem from a 
dependent research project; as a result, the risk of conducting this project is lower, but this project cannot be 
completed to plan unless the dependent activities are successful.
u
u Portfolio process assets. Portfolio process assets may contain relevant data and information regarding the 
portfolio and guidance on authorizing and controlling the portfolio required for optimizing the portfolio. In 
developing the portfolio structure and portfolio charter, the portfolio management team needs to know the 
process assets that stakeholders are willing to provide. Examples include:
u
n Portfolio funding. Understanding the financial resources that stakeholders are willing to commit and the 
expected return on investment is critical in structuring the portfolio; and
u
n Portfolio resources. Understanding the available resources committed to the portfolio assists the portfolio 
management team in structuring the portfolio, taking resource constraints and dependencies into 
consideration.
u
u Organizational process assets. Organizational process assets include any or all processes related to the 
assets from an organization(s) involved in a portfolio that can be used to influence the portfolio’s success. 
Process assets include, but are not limited to:
u
n Formal/informal plans;
u
n Organization’s standard policies, methodologies, processes, and procedures;
u
n Knowledge assets, intellectual property (IP), patents, know-hows, etc.;
u
n Guidelines;
u
n Lessons learned;
u
n Templates/forms;
u
n Knowledge and information from historical program/project records and documents (i.e., organizational 
knowledge base);
u
n Annual reports; and
u
n Key performance indicators (KPIs) from management portfolios in the past (for benchmarking purposes).

39
u
u Enterprise environmental factors. Enterprise environmental factors are organizational and environmental 
variables that can contribute to the determination of how to manage certain aspects of a portfolio. Some 
factors to consider are:
u
n Organizational culture or structure,
u
n Tools,
u
n Personnel,
u
n Infrastructure,
u
n Marketplace conditions,
u
n Governmental regulations,
u
n Stakeholder risk tolerances, and
u
n Economic conditions and forecasts.
3.9 PORTFOLIO OPTIMIzATION
Portfolio optimization is the ongoing practice by which benefits, risks, and resources are balanced and optimized. It 
should be an integral part of any effective organization’s planning process to ensure that there is alignment between 
supply (e.g., human, financial, asset, intellectual) and demand (e.g., projects, maintenance, regulatory changes). With 
multiple projects either under way or in the pipeline at any one time, the balance of priorities, resource alignment, 
allocation, and overall bandwidth management should be effectively managed to avoid overruns of time and money 
and overutilization of human and technology resources.
To understand how to optimize the portfolio and to manage expectations, optimize risk exposure, and plan for 
delivery challenges, portfolio optimization practice should be used and integrated into the organization’s annual 
planning process. This practice looks across all components of the portfolio, illuminates the dependencies and 
constraints across the portfolio, and identifies the most effective bundling of projects where synergies and leverage 
points are defined.
Examples of typical challenges that organizations may experience related to portfolio optimization include:
u
u Portfolios and resources not being aligned with objectives and strategies;
u
u Lack of transparency or access to good, accurate data;
u
u Resources being maxed out as a result of time wasted on too many low-value projects;
u
u Difficulty in adjusting portfolios quickly in response to market changes;
u
u Assessing impact of change in one of the components to the other components, if any (e.g., transfer of 
resources among components, schedule implications); and
u
u Cyclic impact of reprioritization or optimization.

40 
The Standard for Portfolio Management – Fourth Edition
Some considerations for optimizing a portfolio include the following:
u
u Select and prioritize the right components. Not every component has the same urgency. It is important to 
recognize the sequence of component completion based on organizational goals and be able to facilitate the 
higher-priority components first, followed by those lower on the list. Management also uses their insights into 
this process—some items cannot be quantified.
u
u Forecast the cost of delivering the project portfolio. Because profitability or cost efficiency is key for a 
successful organization, it is important to track the costs of portfolios on all levels and monitor them accordingly. 
There should be visibility to track a program/project and determine if the program/project should be canceled 
based on costs exceeding the benefits of completing it.
u
u Provide real-time status reporting for executives. Executives are often the ones who make the business 
decisions, and it is important for them to have real-time visibility of the status of components in order to make 
the best decisions for the organization. These portfolio component status reports can eliminate many risks 
involved with project issues that have not been communicated. Because fairness and nonbiased information 
are keys for best decisions, it is important to ensure consistent portfolio component reports within the portfolio 
by standardized project and program management practices. For example, executives may receive biased 
information from portfolio components if there is no standardized process in place.
u
u Initiate project governance for consistent processes. Ensure that individuals and the organization are held 
accountable for missed deadlines and wrongfully executed projects by ensuring that the reporting and status 
of projects remains consistent across the entire organization, making it easier to track the outcome of projects 
and resulting in greater efficiency overall using governance functions (oversight, control, integration, decision 
making).
u
u Achieve a complete view of all portfolio components. It is important for organizations to have a single true 
version when it comes to project status. This eliminates questions and helps individuals prioritize and support 
the projects that need attention.
3.10 MANAGING STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT
Managing strategic alignment enables the portfolio manager to respond to changes in organizational strategy and 
enhance the ability to accept and act on significant strategic change that impacts portfolio planning and management.
As strategy shifts, the current state should be compared with the future state (which may be evolutionary or 
incremental in nature). A gap may result in a realignment of resources or adjustments in the portfolio component mix 
to support the strategic change. Changes in portfolios are a normal occurrence, and, depending on the significance 
of the changes, portfolio documents may need to be reworked to ensure continued alignment with strategy. This 
repeated adaptation is in contrast to the progressive elaboration required in project management. This is an aligning 
process to identify the gap between current and future states and to analyze the impact and response to strategic 
changes and changes in resources (people, processes, and assets/technology).

41
Strategic objectives and goals are analyzed to determine which part of the portfolio structure will address specific 
strategic goals. The current existing portfolio or inventory of work needs to be analyzed to determine what work or 
component is to continue or close and which components will be added. The techniques include the analysis of the 
drivers of strategic change to determine the desired contribution of the initiatives to the strategic objectives and 
determine benefits and measurable contributions considering financial, resource, knowledge, and risk constraints.
3.10.1 ConSIdEraTIonS WhEn ManagIng STraTEgIC IMPaCT
Stakeholder analysis is critical in managing strategic change because it helps ensure continuity and aligns key 
stakeholders’ expectations with the changing strategy and resulting portfolio realignment. The change may also 
lead to identifying new stakeholders or removing existing stakeholders. The techniques used to analyze stakeholder 
expectations and requirements may include interviewing senior executive stakeholders and analyzing requirements 
and expectations for strategic change. This may include identifying the stakeholders by individual or group and 
determining expectations and requirements, evolving conditions, newly recognized pain points, problems or desires, 
change impacts, issues, risk tolerance, changing external governance and rules (such as environmental rules), and 
concerns.
A gap analysis compares the current portfolio mix and components with the new strategic direction and the future 
organizational vision. This is essential to properly manage strategic change. This analysis determines the gaps and 
changes needed in the portfolio mix so that components may be added, changed, or terminated.
A readiness assessment gauges the ability of the organization to perform the steps necessary to bridge the gap 
between the current portfolio state and the future state. The assessment determines the if, when, what, and how of 
implementing the change, and points out any needs not yet addressed that are required in order to bring about the 
change.
3.10.2 ThE IMPaCT oF STraTEgIC ChangE
A change in the related strategy can have a limited or a far-reaching impact on the portfolio, its components, and/
or the underlying principles. These include, but are not limited to, the following:
u
u The portfolio strategic plan is updated and needs to be revisited when future strategic changes are made. 
Various elements of the portfolio strategic plan may need to change to reflect the organizational strategy 
change, such as the prioritization model, benefits, assumptions, constraints, dependencies, and risks.
u
u The portfolio charter is updated and revisited when future strategic changes are made. The portfolio structure 
in the charter may need to change to reflect new strategic objectives, as well as key or major stakeholders and 
their communication requirements.
u
u When a strategic change is made, components may be added, modified, delayed, or terminated from the 
portfolio to enable alignment with the new strategy.
u
u Based on the impact of the strategic change, the portfolio roadmap is updated, taking into consideration the 
new future vision and resulting changes in the portfolio components, timeline, and dependencies.

42 
The Standard for Portfolio Management – Fourth Edition
u
u Portfolio management plan updates may be needed because of changes in management approach, priorities, 
organizational structure, and other aspects of the portfolio management plan that may result from the strategic 
change. Updates to the stakeholder engagement, communications management, performance, and risk 
sections may also be required as a result of the stakeholder, gap, and readiness assessments.
u
u The portfolio process assets are updated when strategic changes impact portfolio plans and processes. These 
assets include information available from historic files on previous strategic changes to the portfolio-related 
people, processes, and technology; performance metrics; risk management; and lessons learned databases.
u
u Portfolio funding structure/financial management plan may need to be updated, if warranted.
u
u Access and integrate the maturity characteristics of the organization to facilitate successful change.

PORTFOLIO GOVERNANCE
This section explains what governance is, what it is based on, its guiding principles, how governance is 
implemented in terms of practices, and how governance activities differ from management activities. Understanding 
and implementing an effective portfolio governance framework guides the portfolio decision-making processes in 
the interests of all stakeholders while adhering to the governance principles of the organization. The following major 
sections are addressed:
4.1 Overview
4.2 What Is Portfolio Governance?
4.3 Guiding Principles
4.4 The Concept of Governance
4.5 Effective Portfolio Governance design Factors
4.6 Portfolio Governance Roles
4.1 OVERVIEW
The term governance is increasingly used in the field of portfolio, program, and project management, but the 
term and what it represents is frequently confused with notions associated with management. This section provides 
clarity on the concept of governance versus management, the importance of principles and how they impact both 
governance and management activities, and how portfolio governance principles impact programs and projects 
within the portfolio in addition to their value as part of component-based methodologies to increase the chances of 
component success. Governance activities encapsulate and enable the application of the portfolio principles to the 
actual work of portfolio management. (See Section 1.7 for the list of portfolio management principles that underpin 
this standard.)
4.2 WHAT IS PORTFOLIO GOVERNANCE?
Portfolio Governance is a set of practices, functions, and processes within a framework based on a set of principles 
that are the fundamental norms, rules, or values that guide portfolio management activities in order to optimize 
investments and meet organizational strategic and operational goals [4]. The term governance framework includes 
oversight, decision making, control, and integration functions, by which governance processes and tasks are directed 
toward the achievement of portfolio governance objectives.

44 
The Standard for Portfolio Management – Fourth Edition
4.3 GuIdING PRINCIPLES
This section on governance is very different from the other sections in this standard because governance is the 
framework within which portfolio management works, whereas other aspects of portfolio management are associated 
with the definition, implementation, and execution of the portfolio within the governance framework. This subtle 
difference also reflects which guiding principles are used to establish effective Portfolio Governance.
Section 1.7 lists eight principles relating to portfolio management; however, one principle directly relates to 
governance: Enable transparency, responsibility, accountability, sustainability, and fairness.
4.4 THE CONCEPT OF GOVERNANCE
Portfolio Governance is established based on principles, rules, and values that are desirable and guide the 
establishment of portfolio governance practices within an organization. Governance can be viewed from different 
perspectives as a system of controls, as a set of processes, and as a set of processes and relationships. Governance is 
very different from management. Governance is associated with decision making, oversight, control, and integration, 
whereas management is described as working within the limitations set by the governance framework with the 
overall aim of achieving the organizational objectives. 
4.4.1 PorTFolIo goVErnanCE IMPaCT on PrograMS and ProjECTS
When establishing the Portfolio Governance practices of a portfolio, including the component programs, projects, 
and operations, it is important to understand and influence the underlying governance principles and governance 
objectives of the components to ensure that they integrate and align to the principles and objectives of the portfolio. 
To achieve this, the component program and project methodologies should include governance principles along with  
management principles. Governance principles should help avoid and also resolve ambiguities, issues, and conflicts 
that may arise during a component’s life cycle, especially when the endeavor has a low-outcome predictability in a 
complex environment.
Figure 4-1 shows the flow of the governance principles down through the organization, which influences the 
governance objectives at the portfolio, program, project, and operation levels. These governance principles help 
create the value system of an organization.
Senior management, typically at the board level, defines organizational governance based on the fundamental 
norms, rules, and values of the organization, which are used as the basis to develop Portfolio Governance practices. 
Because Portfolio Governance practices incorporate the governance principles of the organization, they flow down to 
the portfolio components to provide control, integration, decision making, and general oversight. The implementation 
of portfolio, program, project, and operations governance is accomplished through governance roles, which are 
described in Section 4.6. The effectiveness of the governance practices throughout the portfolio is dependent on the 
mentalities, rationalities, and ways of interaction, chosen by those in governance roles to implement, maintain, and 
change the governance structure.

The Portfolio Governance Performance Domain is shown as one of the six performance management domains (see 
Figure 1-3). Governance impacts all the other portfolio domains, including the portfolio supporting processes in terms 
of the underlying governance principles and applied governance practices. The governance domain is comprised of 
four governance functions that represent the processes and activities that may be repeated throughout the portfolio 
and its components: decision making, oversight, control, and integration. The decision-making function includes the 
processes and activities that provide the overall governance structure for delegation of management authority for 
the portfolio and its components. The oversight function provides the governance processes and activities to support 
the leadership and direction for the portfolio and its components. The control function provides the processes and 
activities used to monitor, measure, and report on the portfolio and its components. The integration function provides 
the processes and activities to support the strategic alignment of the portfolio and its components.

46 
The Standard for Portfolio Management – Fourth Edition
4.5 EFFECTIVE PORTFOLIO GOVERNANCE dESIGN FACTORS
Portfolio governance design will have a significant influence on whether the portfolio can consistently meet its 
objectives throughout its life cycle. In extreme cases, governance practices that are not based on organizational 
governance principles and are inappropriate for the type of portfolio will increase the risk of component failure 
and jeopardize the overall success of the portfolio. There are many factors to consider when designing portfolio 
governance practices. Common factors to consider when optimizing portfolio governance include the following:
u
u Legislative environment. Portfolios contain many components, some of which may be significantly influenced 
by changing legislation; these may benefit from governance designed for direct interaction with legislative 
authorities.
u
u Regulatory environment. Many organizations are regulated within their industry or area. Therefore, their 
portfolio governance should be designed to ensure that proposed components for portfolio inclusion comply 
with regulations both in terms of component selection and throughout the components’ life cycles.
u
u decision-making hierarchy. For the components, it is important that decision-making responsibility is at 
the level where competence, accountability, and authority reside. There are complexities to this approach. For 
example, in organizations where employees are not ultimately accountable for their actions or are not made to 
feel accountable for their actions, there will be a greater need for controlling practices. In other circumstances, 
an experienced and respected component manager and team may be given greater autonomy and decision-
making powers than is typically given to component managers at a similar level.
u
u Alignment with organizational governance. Portfolio governance should align with organizational governance 
in terms of organizational principles. Portfolio governance objectives should, in principle, align with organizational 
governance and should also reflect the nature of the portfolio and its specific objectives. Particular care should 
be taken for portfolios belonging to organizations that are joint ventures, to align to the governing principles of 
all parent entities. When designing portfolio governance practices, consideration should also be given to:
u
n Types of governance practices that should be in place for the portfolio components;
u
n Factors such as contracting of resources, risk of component failure (especially for high-risk components), 
components’ level of importance from low to strategically important, and program and project management 
offices (PMOs) and how they will support components from a governance perspective; and
u
n Component life cycles and the experience of the component teams applying the life cycle processes.
u
u Alignment with organizational culture. Organizational culture should be taken into account throughout the 
design of the portfolio governance, as culture influences the way of thinking and the acceptance of governance.

47
4.6 PORTFOLIO GOVERNANCE ROLES
Establishing an appropriate collaborative relationship among the individuals responsible for portfolio governance 
is critical to the success of the portfolio in delivering the value the organization desires. Portfolio managers leverage 
the portfolio governance board to help establish organizational conditions that support the goals of the portfolio. 
Governance board activities include monitoring escalated portfolio risks that may impact the financial value of the 
portfolio, the portfolio component mix used to achieve the organizational strategy and objectives, and the impact to 
the organization’s capacities and capabilities. Establishing a collaborative relationship among the members of the 
portfolio governance board, of which the portfolio manager or portfolio owner is often the chair, is also critical to 
the ultimate success of the organization. Portfolio managers may be assigned responsibility and accountability for 
effectively managing the portfolio in pursuit of organizational goals as authorized by the portfolio governance board. 
When doing so, a portfolio manager assumes a responsible role for the governance practices within the governance 
domain. The accountability of the governance roles may reside with the head of the business unit, the chief operating 
officer, chief strategy officer, chief financial officer, chief information officer, or another similar executive role.
Portfolio governance structures are best defined in a manner that is specific to the principles and needs of each 
organization and the requirements of the components within the portfolio. The relationship between the portfolio 
governance and portfolio management functions often is managed by assigning key roles to individuals who are part 
of those functions and recognized as key stakeholders.
4.6.1 PorTFolIo SPonSor
The portfolio sponsor is the individual who is responsible for championing the application of organizational resources 
to help meet the portfolio’s goals and objectives, and realizing its intended value contribution. The portfolio sponsor 
role frequently is filled by an executive member of the portfolio governance board who has a senior role in directing 
the organization and its investment decisions and who is personally vested in the success of the portfolio components 
and, therefore, the value that the portfolio is creating for the organization. In many organizations, the portfolio sponsor 
acts as the chairperson of the portfolio governance board.
Typical responsibilities of the portfolio sponsor are to:
u
u Ensure that portfolio goals and objectives are aligned with the strategic vision;
u
u Provide oversight and feedback on the delivery of benefits to enable success of the portfolio;
u
u Remove barriers and obstacles to portfolio success;
u
u Ensure funding-related approvals;
u
u Provide the necessary resources; and
u
u Manage interactions between senior management and the portfolio management team with regard to the 
portfolio activities.

48 
The Standard for Portfolio Management – Fourth Edition
As a member or chair of the portfolio governance board, the sponsor is integral to the fulfillment of governance 
responsibilities. It is critical that the organization allows the portfolio sponsor to perform the role effectively. Sufficient 
time and resources should be provided to enable success, which often requires relief from other duties. The skills and 
experience of the portfolio sponsor impacts the effectiveness of the portfolio. Often, the portfolio sponsor is required 
to drive changes through the organization so that operations can accommodate capabilities delivered by the portfolio 
components and secure the available benefits leading to value realization. The sponsor is integral to the communication 
and stakeholder processes. Typically, an effective portfolio sponsor exhibits the following skill sets and background:
u
u Organization-wide perspective,
u
u Ability to influence senior stakeholders,
u
u Ability to work across different stakeholder groups to find mutually beneficial solutions,
u
u Leadership skills,
u
u Decision-making authority, and
u
u Effective communication skills.
4.6.2 PorTFolIo goVErnanCE Board
Most organizations seek to ensure appropriate portfolio governance by establishing a portfolio governance board to 
determine the governance practices and provide the appropriate leadership, oversight, and decision making. Portfolio 
governance boards improve the likelihood that the portfolio governance domain is based on governance principles 
that guide the establishment of governance practices across portfolios, programs, and projects. The board should be 
well positioned to efficiently address governance issues or questions that may arise during the portfolio life cycle. 
Portfolio governance boards are often composed of executive-level stakeholders selected for their strategic insight, 
business area knowledge, functional responsibilities, operational accountabilities, responsibilities for managing 
the organization’s portfolio, and/or abilities to represent important stakeholder groups. In some organizations, the 
governance board may also be responsible for some portfolio management tasks. In such cases, portfolio governance 
boards are often staffed by individuals who are either individually or collectively recognized as having organizational 
insight and decision-making authority that are critical to the establishment of portfolio goals, strategy, and operational 
plans. Often, portfolio governance boards include senior leaders from the functional groups responsible for supporting 
significant elements of the portfolio, including, for example, the organizational executives and leaders responsible 
for supporting the portfolio’s components. The portfolio governance board ensures that the portfolio is executed in 
an environment with appropriate organizational knowledge and expertise and well supported by the governance 
framework, and empowers those with decision-making authority.
Typical governance responsibilities include:
u
u Determining the governance framework, which includes oversight, decision making, control, and integration 
functions by which governance processes and tasks are directed toward the achievement of governance 
objectives;
u
u Approving governance-related policies and processes;
u
u Establishing component selection, categorization, prioritization, and authorization criteria; and
u
u Reviewing and remediating escalated issues and risks relating to governance.

49
Responsibilities of governance boards that also have a management responsibility typically include:
u
u Ensuring that the portfolio strategic plan aligns with the organizational strategic and operational goals;
u
u Considering and balancing the degree of organizational change required to achieve portfolio value;
u
u Providing executive support in portfolio, program, and project process alignment and expectations;
u
u Providing leadership in making, enforcing, carrying out, and communicating decisions;
u
u Defining key performance targets and thresholds;
u
u Influencing and directing multiple areas, such as organizational communications, external reporting, funding 
and investment measures, and strategic direction for new products and services;
u
u Controlling allocation of resources in accordance with an organization’s strategic priorities and operational 
needs;
u
u Determining risk and/or reward, including the financial investment, return, and portfolio value;
u
u Reviewing and resolving conflicting goals and objectives;
u
u Defining key messages to be communicated to stakeholders and the organization;
u
u Reviewing performance and proposed recommendations to adjust the portfolio; and
u
u Reviewing and remediating escalated issues and risks relating to the management of the portfolio.
In small organizations, a single executive may take on all of these responsibilities rather than convening a full 
portfolio governance board, oversight committee, or board of directors with multiple individuals.
4.6.3 PorTFolIo audIT organIzaTIon
Portfolio governance includes the assignment of responsibility for ensuring that the component managers know 
that planned and ad hoc audits may be required or desired based on the specific nature of the organization. Audit 
assessments may be conducted by an internal and/or external auditing body and include organizational and component/
subcomponent compliance with approved or mandated business or program/project management processes. 
Component audits are frequently focused on finances, management and governance practices, risk management 
practices, strategic alignment, quality assurance and quality control, and component documentation.
Portfolio-instigated audits may delegate responsibility to the component governance board(s) for creating 
organizational or component-specific plans for audits to be used by the component team. Such plans often provide 
details on organizational policies regarding audit expectations and preparedness, standardized audit processes, 
anticipated schedules for known internal or external audits, roles and responsibilities of component staff regarding 
the conduct of audits, and policies for review and communication of audit results.
Audits are sometimes viewed within the portfolio components as time-consuming endeavors that burden the 
components. It should be noted that audits are often valuable measures of component quality that help the component 
manager, portfolio manager, and other stakeholders identify areas of concern, thereby reducing the risk of triggering 
corrective actions. Also, an audit is a direct communication channel to senior management, allowing clear messages 
to reach the audit review team that otherwise may be blocked or filtered. The audit support provided by the governance 
function may, therefore, contribute significantly to the eventual success of the components and the long-term success 
of the portfolio.

PORTFOLIO CAPACITY ANd CAPAbILITY MANAGEMENT
This section covers the Portfolio Capacity and Capability Management performance domain as it relates to portfolio 
management. The objective for Portfolio Capacity and Capability Management is to ensure that the portfolio’s capacity 
and capability demands are in alignment with portfolio objectives and can be supported or met by the organization’s 
resource capacities and capabilities, thus enabling successful portfolio execution and expected portfolio returns. The 
following major sections are addressed:

5.2 Guiding Principles
5.3 Capacity Management
5.4 Capacity Planning
5.5 Supply and demand Management
5.6 Supply and demand Optimization

5.1 OVERVIEW
The capacity and capability management function plays a critical role in the organization’s overall portfolio 
management—from strategic planning to portfolio selection and optimization, through portfolio execution, to realizing the 
resulting value to the organization. Effective and efficient capacity and capability management bridges the gap between 
an organization’s overall strategy and the attainment of specific business objectives through the monitoring and controlling 
of the execution of program and project efforts managed within the portfolio structure. Terms are described as follows:
u
u Capacity and capability management. A comprehensive framework based on a set of guiding principles, 
consisting of a set of tools and practices to identify, allocate, and optimize resources for maximizing resource 
utilization and minimizing resource conflicts in portfolio execution. Capacity and capability management in the 
context of portfolio management implies all aspects of resources such as staff, capital, technology, equipment, etc.
u
u Capacity management. Addresses what types of resources are needed, how many are needed, and when 
resources are needed to support portfolios.

52 
The Standard for Portfolio Management – Fourth Edition
u
u Capability management. Elaborates what aspects of resource capacity are available and addresses the 
attributes, competences, and skills associated with resources and organizational support for portfolios.
The objective of Portfolio Capacity and Capability Management is to determine the optimal balance between what the 
organization can do now, or its capacity, and what the organization can potentially do, or its capability. Portfolio Capacity 
and Capability Management maximizes resource utilization and minimizes conflicts for successful portfolio execution. 
Sound practices around portfolio selection and execution, decision making, change management, risk management, value 
management, and benefit management have a direct impact on resource capacities and capabilities. Interdependencies 
among portfolio components drive complexity and, thus, affect resources as well. Portfolio Capacity and Capability 
Management focuses on the human, financial, asset, and intellectual capital resources an organization uses to execute 
portfolio components. Thus, each organization has an ideal potential as to what it can accomplish and what can be 
done now, given an entire set of organizational demands and priorities. The portfolio manager needs to look across the 
organization to identify the programs and supporting projects that will be in the portfolio to meet the strategic objectives of 
the organization. These programs and supporting projects should also be executable by balancing the portfolio’s demands 
against the organization’s capacity and capability to achieve the business goals of the portfolio and associated value.
Balancing the organization’s capacity and capability is not a simple task. The integration of programs and 
projects within the portfolio to meet strategic objectives is complex and involves many interrelationships among the 
organization, its programs, and supporting projects. A portfolio should be understood as a complex adaptive system 
rather than as isolated, or even simply connected, components. Capacity and capability management involves aspects 
that shape the portfolio and allow portfolio managers to plan, monitor, and control the execution of portfolios to meet 
organizational strategic goals and aggregate investment performance and benefit realization.
5.2 GuIdING PRINCIPLES
Organizations, irrespective of size, complexity, or nature of the business environment, need to define and embrace a set 
of guiding principles to be effective with capacity and capability management and succeed at the portfolio level. All of the 
principles outlined in Section 1.7 are relevant to Portfolio Capacity and Capability Management. However, the following are 
especially noteworthy because they have profound and direct impact on resources to successfully execute the portfolio:
u
u Exercise active and decisive leadership for the optimization of resource utilization,
u
u Achieve excellence in strategic execution,
u
u Balance portfolio value against overall risks, and
u
u Navigate complexity to enable successful outcomes.
The discussions in this section reflect these principles as the underlying basis for effective capacity and capability 
management.
5.3 CAPACITY MANAGEMENT
Capacity management is one of the most complex and critical areas within portfolio management. It addresses the 
overall resource demands of portfolios and their components. Capacity is the organization’s ability to fulfill aggregate 
resource demands for successfully executing a planned portfolio of initiatives.

53
An organization’s capacity or resource needs for portfolio execution occur primarily across four major categories:
u
u Human capital. Availability of human resources to support the portfolio.
u
u Financial capital. Availability of funds to support the portfolio.
u
u Assets. Availability of physical assets, such as machinery, office space, factory sites, etc.
u
u Intellectual capital. Availability of patents, copyrights, etc.
Each of these resource categories requires thorough planning, analysis, and active management to successfully 
execute the portfolio and achieve associated goals and objectives. These resource categories are critically important 
and closely correlate with one another. Ratios and relevance depend on the industry and portfolio mix.
Capacity management seeks to address conflicts related to the resource demands of portfolios and their respective 
components. It helps identify what resources are needed, how many are needed, and when resources are needed to 
support the portfolio, including ongoing optimization to maximize utilization and minimize conflicts.
The “what” aspects of resource capacity management are further elaborated by capability management, which 
addresses the attributes, competences, and skills associated with resources. Outside of resource capability, other 
critical organizational capabilities should consider which resources directly contribute to successful portfolio execution.
Figure 5-1 represents the capacity and capability management components of portfolio management.

The Standard for Portfolio Management – Fourth Edition
Capacity management for portfolios involves methodically developing an overall profile of portfolio resource 
demands and the available supply of resources, analyzing and aligning the supply of resources to the portfolio needs, 
measuring and monitoring resource demands and supply throughout the portfolio execution, and executing changes 
as needed for the portfolio to perform at the optimal level for targeted benefits or value realization.
Capacity management uses a comprehensive and integrated approach for resource management. It encompasses 
the following four elements:
u
u Capacity planning. This element entails the forecasting of resource demands and the available supply of 
resources for portfolio execution based on the available information in the portfolio roadmap, strategic plans, 
historical data, etc.
u
u Supply and demand management. This element involves analysis and resource allocations for portfolio 
components to balance supply and demand.
u
u demand optimization. This element involves ongoing measurements and the monitoring of resources for 
needed course corrections and adjustments during portfolio execution.
u
u Reporting and analytics. This element involves identifying and capturing data and associated analysis for 
trends and patterns to aid with portfolio decision making.
Capacity management’s four elements collectively enable the organization to execute the portfolio and obtain 
targeted portfolio benefits based on the approved resource levels or constraints, thus driving value for the organization. 
The components of capacity management are discussed in more detail in Sections 5.4 through 5.6.
5.4 CAPACITY PLANNING
Capacity planning allows for an understanding of resource needs by measuring portfolio components against 
the available capacity of the organizational resources, ensuring that the organization can successfully execute its 
business initiatives as identified in the portfolio.
From the portfolio perspective, overall demand and available supply should be identified and compiled as an overall 
supply and demand profile for resource analysis and allocations to follow as part of demand management. A portfolio 
supply and demand profile provides a consolidated and holistic view of forecasted resources. It also captures the risk 
attitudes and thresholds specific to resources and investments, which are essential in defining resource allocations 
and making trade-off decisions for portfolio component ranking, prioritization, selection, and ongoing balancing and 
optimization of the overall portfolio.
An integrated review of the organizational strategic plan, risk management plans, organizational process assets, 
portfolio process assets, and enterprise environmental factors provides essential information in developing an 
aggregate and comprehensive forecast of demand and the available supply to support the portfolio.
The aggregate supply and demand profile highlights the resource capacity available from the organization across 
the human, financial, asset, and intellectual dimensions, including boundaries and constraints, and provides valuable 
guidance in portfolio execution and portfolio governance to select and fund portfolio components.
While accounting for the entire portfolio, capacity planning also needs to accommodate special instances when the 
portfolio may have mandatory or legislative initiatives that exceed the capacity or capability limits of the organization. 
Depending on the organization’s risk profile, capacity planning may have contingency reserves for unplanned portfolio 
components that may come up during business cycles.

55
The overall portfolio supply and demand profile, derived through capacity planning, provides a consolidated 
and holistic view of supply and demand. It helps define the resource allocations and trade-off criteria for ranking, 
prioritizing, and selecting profile components, and the ongoing balancing and optimization of the portfolio.
5.5 SuPPLY ANd dEMANd MANAGEMENT
Supply and demand management involves analysis and resource allocations for portfolio components to balance 
supply and demand. The alignment between overall supply and demand begins with a thorough analysis to support 
resource allocations for portfolio components. Analysis provides a critical decision framework to be utilized for resource 
allocation during portfolio selection, authorizing, and funding. A supply and demand profile provides foundational 
information for the needed capacity and capability analysis, a prerequisite for corresponding allocations. Capacity 
and capability analysis is essential for studying the capability of resources (i.e., skill sets and certifications), matching 
them with the portfolio components’ objectives and goals, and translating the capability into the capacity that can 
meet the portfolio demands.
5.5.1 SuPPly and dEMand analySIS
Supply and demand analysis is performed to understand the human, financial, assets, and intellectual capital 
capacity and capability accessible in order to select, fund, and execute portfolio components. Capability is a specific 
competency that enables an organization to execute components and deliver results. Capacity and capability analysis, 
which drives the decision criteria for the resource allocation, may include scenario analysis, quantitative and qualitative 
analysis, and risk analysis.
Following the supply and demand analysis, an organization can take appropriate action based on the drivers of the 
portfolio. When demand is the primary driver, the organization needs to adjust the resource supply (through temporary 
and permanent resources). When the resource supply is relatively fixed, the organization needs to manage the project 
demand and sequence project work based on resource availability and project priority. In many cases, organizations 
will both adjust the resource supply and manage project demand.
5.5.2 SuPPly and dEMand alloCaTIonS
A prioritized list of portfolio components, decision criteria, and capacity and capability analysis collectively enables 
effective resource allocations to balance supply against the portfolio demands. The required portfolio resources should be 
identified according to each initiative’s business case or plan, and an inventory of resources and capabilities aggregated 
to reflect the demand. This demand is then mapped to existing organizational resources, including funds, other tangible 
and intangible assets, and key human resources, such as program and project managers and subject matter experts. A 
master schedule of resource allocation is necessary to plan the consolidated demand of portfolio resources.
At the portfolio management level, the concept of supply and demand takes on a wider meaning than what is used 
at the program and project levels. The goal in managing supply and demand is to ensure that organizations optimally 
allocate resource capacity against resource requirements or demand based on strategic goals of the organization and 
associated portfolio composition. Organizations should allocate resources to minimize both capacity underutilization 
and overutilization (refer to Figure 5-2 on the supply and demand relationship). The ideal outcome requires diligent, 
iterative resource management and continuous optimization processes.

Figure 5-2. The Relationship between Supply (Capacity) and demand
The balancing of these demands or resources with the output of the portfolio or the portfolio’s resultant value is 
commonly referred to as capacity balancing. Forecasting supply and demand at the portfolio level, along with short-
term and long-term planning, is key to balancing portfolio capacity over time.
Portfolio resources are always constrained, so supply and demand needs to be continually reviewed and 
balanced with appropriate approaches. Some organizations assume that there are unlimited resources and that 
resources can be procured through various channels to satisfy any demand. These are typically projectized 
organizations. Other organizations assume resource limitation, where resources can be available within a range 
of variability. These organizations are more often functional or matrix organizations. In functional and matrix 
organizations, labor resources are used on both project work and operational work. Fluctuations in operational 
workload have an impact on the availability of resources for work managed within the portfolio. This is one of 
the main reasons why critical operations (or changes thereof) should be included in the portfolio, in addition to 
programs and projects.
There is a complex relationship between the types of resource supplies. The capability and productivity of human 
resources, even when training, background, and experience are similar, can vary widely. Labor rates can vary based 
on skill set, experience, industry, organizational structure, and the physical location of resources. Labor resources 
can be hired or contracted. Equipment and physical assets can be purchased, leased, or rented and made available 
locally or remotely.

57
Every organization has bottleneck resources, which are skill sets that are needed on many projects but are in short 
supply. Bottleneck resources are typically those critical human resources who have an understanding of the business 
processes and technical or functional knowledge with the ability to translate business requirements and evaluate 
the impact of changes. People with these skill sets are difficult to hire or contract because of their scarcity and the 
specific organizational knowledge they are required to have. Specialized equipment or facilities can also be bottleneck 
resources. The demand for these resources needs to be managed continuously to avoid poor portfolio performance as 
a result of resource challenges. It can be difficult to accurately determine the demand for resources across a portfolio 
of programs, projects, and operations at a point in the life cycle before detailed planning has occurred. As portfolio 
components are selected and planning is conducted, new information regarding resource requirements is often learned.
In order to maximize the use of resources, organizations commit resources to authorized portfolio components 
based on the expected end date of an active portfolio component (commonly referred to as “soft booking”). Unexpected 
delays or unrecognized dependencies between portfolio components can result in situations where a resource is not 
available when expected.
Resource allocation should take into account the strategic intent and the forecast value or benefit of portfolio components 
when those components are approved for funding. Portfolio components with higher expected benefits and stronger strategic 
intent should have higher priority over resource allocations when the portfolio components are approved and funded.
In addition to the strategic intent and benefits for resource allocations, the organization’s risk appetite needs to be 
taken into account as well to ensure that threats and opportunities are balanced appropriately to optimize portfolio value.
Resource bottlenecks and constraints should be continually identified and monitored during portfolio execution, and 
appropriate strategies for resource leveling and bottlenecks should be implemented in a timely fashion to minimize 
any adverse impacts on portfolio performance.
Resource allocations for the portfolio need to be continually reviewed and analyzed during portfolio execution for 
adjustment and course corrections while striving for an optimal balance between supply and demand at the aggregate 
portfolio level, thus confirming that the expected portfolio value is preserved and maximized. Program and project 
change requests should be approved considering the impact on resource management at the portfolio level (to other 
components of the portfolio).
5.6 SuPPLY ANd dEMANd OPTIMIzATION
Supply and demand optimization involves ongoing measurements and monitoring of resources for needed course 
corrections and adjustments during portfolio execution.
Continual and ongoing monitoring of the supply and demand relationship is critical to the success of the portfolio. 
The portfolio manager analyzes information regarding resource utilization and changing resource requirements of 
active portfolio components as well as the resource needs for planned and approved portfolio components against the 
availability of resources. The portfolio manager then allocates the resources in such a way (“doing the right project at 
the right time with the right resources”) that the right resources are identified and matched to the right projects at the 
right time. When resources are constrained, the organization may be unable to accomplish the planned components 
and may need to reprioritize portfolio components.
In portfolio execution, it is critical for the portfolio manager to maintain a close alignment and balance between risk 
appetite and resource capacity and capability to ensure that adequate resource capacity and capability are available 
to manage the portfolio within the tolerated risk exposure level.

58 
The Standard for Portfolio Management – Fourth Edition
It is important that the relationships among resources, portfolio schedules, and any associated risks are clearly 
identified and managed throughout portfolio execution. Mitigating strategies or optimization measures are put in place 
to preserve the expected value and benefits of the portfolio.
Important metrics, key trends and patterns, and lessons learned should be captured as part of the measuring and 
monitoring process. This enables the organization to build a knowledge base repository—an organizational asset that 
can be extremely valuable for future use in capacity and capability planning.
In order to succeed with this challenge, organizations should implement a lean structure and robust change 
management processes to drive agility, effectiveness, and timeliness in response to actions and their associated 
decisions. Effective end-to-end change management, which includes identification, impact assessment, communication, 
disposition, and execution, is critical for ensuring portfolio value and associated benefits.
Changes to portfolio components, such as overruns, changes to scope, termination, and rescheduling, drive 
resource optimization and balancing. The portfolio management team needs to identify resource impacts that result 
from portfolio component changes. The portfolio manager needs to communicate with and gain concurrence on 
consequential schedule changes from portfolio stakeholders to ensure optimal portfolio performance. Such changes 
can be made easily when a robust monitoring and control system is in place so portfolio decision makers know the 
current state of the portfolio, variances to the plan, and the path toward fulfillment of strategic objectives and goals.
Proactive and continuous engagement with portfolio stakeholders and a focus on capacity and capability are 
extremely important and beneficial in identifying and evaluating any potential risks or issues related to resources. Once 
risks or issues are identified and evaluated, a planned risk response approach can be formulated and implemented, 
thus avoiding expensive stoppages or disruptions. Conversely, surplus availability of resources can also lead to 
advancing some of the portfolio components.
5.7 ORGANIzATIONAL CAPAbILITIES
A capability is the ability of an organization through its people, processes, and systems to execute an entire portfolio 
of initiatives for delivering goods and services. Capability creates competences that provide a competitive advantage in 
the marketplace and deliver a desired customer value proposition and the achievement of the organization’s goals and 
objectives. Because organizational capability deals with competences that are employed or exercised through internal 
processes and systems, an evolutionary path exists. When followed, this path allows the organization to become more 
organized, more systematic, and more mature. Over time, as organizational capabilities mature, what gets done shifts 
from a reliance on the heroics and/or talents of individual people toward documented and standardized processes 
and systems.
Capability differs from capacity in that capacity is how much the organization can do now, at the present time, 
while capability refers to the potential of the organization that may or may not be exploited. In addition, capability may 
indicate the ability of the organization to ramp up required resources to execute work when the capacity is at a shortfall 
at a point in time. The sum total of all characteristics represents the sum total of all resource attributes and represents 
the organization’s capability, while the sum total of realized or actuated resource attributes is the organization’s 
capacity. Synergy also plays into this equation—the sum of resource attributes is not a simple mathematical equation. 
In complex systems, the sum of attributes may be less or greater than the whole, and this complex relationship is what 
makes balancing capacity and capability within the portfolio so difficult.

59
5.8 CAPAbILITY ASSESSMENT
A capability assessment is an internal analysis regarding what the organization has or does not have and what it can 
and cannot do. In other words, a capability assessment analyzes strengths and weaknesses with respect to resources, 
thus aiding with the selection, funding, execution, and optimization of the portfolio. Strengths are capabilities that 
the organization possesses and has developed, which can be exploited and developed into a sustainable competitive 
advantage and targeted value proposition. Not all strengths have the potential to become a sustainable competitive 
advantage, but they still provide competitive parity. Weaknesses are capabilities that are lacking or deficient and 
prevent the organization from developing a sustainable competitive advantage. The organization needs to address 
significant weaknesses that hinder the organization from developing sustainable competitive advantage.
An assessment can provide the organization with valuable information to:
u
u Gain an understanding of the current state of the organization;
u
u Identify gaps between the existing and desired capabilities of the organization;
u
u Receive a fact-based early warning of potential roadblocks to portfolio management success;
u
u Evaluate organizational agility;
u
u Learn what needs to be done and when to achieve organizational goals;
u
u Position the organization to address capability gaps in advance rather than react to them when they emerge;
u
u Discover how, when, and where to apply critical resources for long-term success; and
u
u Develop fact-based recommendations and a realistic plan for achieving and sustaining full organizational 
capability.
5.9 CAPAbILITY dEVELOPMENT
Organizations continue to assess and evaluate their environment to identify new capabilities to develop or sustain 
existing capabilities in line with business strategy and market conditions.
5.9.1 dEVEloPIng nEW CaPaBIlITIES
Developing organizational and individual capabilities depends on maintaining, improving, or developing requisite 
competences. Competences are individual characteristics, including knowledge, skills, abilities, self-image, traits, 
mindsets, feelings, and ways of thinking, which, when used with appropriate roles, achieve a desired result. Individual 
or collective performance based on a set of competences creates a positive impact on business outcomes. Key 
desirable competences include:
u
u Expertise in managing human resources,
u
u Relationship management,
u
u Consulting skills,
u
u Leadership and ability to navigate organizational boundaries,

60 
The Standard for Portfolio Management – Fourth Edition
u
u Communication skills,
u
u Effectiveness in dealing with global and cultural issues,
u
u Ethical behavior,
u
u Ability to evaluate information to make critical decisions, and
u
u Business acumen.
The challenge for any organization is to build capabilities before competitors do; however, other drivers can motivate 
organizations to create new capabilities or expand their existing capabilities. These drivers include:
u
u Organizational culture,
u
u Customer demands,
u
u Long-term shifting markets and trends, and
u
u Response to an urgent external or internal event.
Before detailed planning has occurred, it can be difficult to predict the demand for resources across a portfolio 
of programs, projects, and operations. As the portfolio manager and stakeholders select portfolio components and 
conduct detailed planning, new information regarding needed resources and capabilities is often uncovered.
There are several capability elements that organizations should keep in mind as they consider building the 
capabilities needed to support the organization and portfolio strategy. These include the following:
u
u Mission. Purpose of the capability, how it will operate, and what it will deliver as derived from the organization’s 
strategy.
u
u Talent. Skills, incentives, and workforce planning that enable an optimal talent base to execute the capability.
u
u Process. An integrated set of processes and activities used to achieve the desired outcome.
u
u Technology. Systems required to support the development and sustainment of the capability.
u
u Integration. Clear roles, decision rights, and policies that inform organizational structure.
u
u Insights. Information, analytics, and decision flow that drive informed and timely decision making.
Organizations often face the strategic challenge of determining how to deploy their limited resources, not only to 
build capabilities to achieve a competitive advantage, but also to make that advantage sustainable. It is important to 
understand that capabilities are generally interdependent. Organizations should target an optimal set of capabilities 
for primary attention; however, these limited resources can be stretched to build sustainable capabilities by focusing 
on capabilities that are interconnected. For example, to build speed, the organization will likely need to target fast 
learning, fast innovation, or fast collaboration. As one capability improves, it will, in turn, probably improve others. 
Improved capabilities enhance leadership characteristics, so working to improve any one capability builds leadership 
potential. As the quality of leadership improves, talent and collaboration issues often surface—and in the process of 
resolving those problems, the organization usually strengthens its accountability and learning.

61
5.9.2 SuSTaInIng EXISTIng CaPaBIlITIES
To enhance the sustainability of the competitive advantage of a capability, managers should work to embed the 
capabilities throughout different interconnected and hierarchical processes within the organization, that is, address the 
process, technology, and integration capability elements. By establishing a formal system of rules and organizational 
hierarchies to shape deliberative decision making regarding the use of a capability, the organization can enhance the 
sustainability of its capabilities.
Sustaining capability also requires gaining insight via regular checkpoints. These checkpoints include conducting 
capability audits to help gauge—and ultimately boost—the status of the organization’s capabilities, as well as 
measuring benefits realization associated with the new/enhanced capability.
5.10 PERFORMANCE REPORTING ANd ANALYTICS
Performance reporting and analytics involves identifying, capturing, and distributing data and associated analysis 
for progress updates, trends, and patterns to aid with portfolio decision making. Suitability, selection, and frequency 
of the capacity- and capability-related metrics are driven by the size, complexity, and nature of the portfolio and 
organizational culture.
Although capacity- and capability-related metrics have vital importance throughout portfolio management, they are 
immensely valuable in building a knowledge base of historical data that can be leveraged in future strategic planning 
cycles or portfolio management activities.
5.11 bALANCE CAPACITY ANd CAPAbILITY
Capacity and capability require balancing for effective portfolio execution and optimization, attaining strategic goals 
and objectives, and delivering value to the organization. Organizational change management is a key to managing 
optimal balance of capacity and capability for portfolio needs.
Projects and programs are driven by requirements that seek to fill a capability gap related to some product, service, 
or organizational capability. Requirements are balanced via project processes to deliver an optimized solution. Similarly, 
at the portfolio level, capability gaps are reduced through a balancing of capacity and capability. The balancing act at 
the portfolio level does not involve trade-offs between requirements. Rather, it involves resource trades to balance the 
organization’s potential, its use of its capabilities in its current operating state, and its capacity.
Balancing does not necessarily mean a maximization of capacity to achieve an organization’s theoretical capability. 
The goal is not to minimize the capability gap without regard to other factors. Balancing capacity and capability is 
not a simple task because it is part of a complex system. Within complex systems, organizations need to consider 
many interrelationships. Balancing capacity and capability involves the integration of organizational strategic plans, 
organizational process assets, portfolio process assets, and enterprise environmental factors. Dynamic capability and 
capacity is crucial to innovation.
Balancing dynamic capacity and capability is especially difficult because it deals primarily with personnel or soft 
skills. As part of this balancing process, capacity and capability gaps are filled, but not necessarily minimized, across 
all areas.

PORTFOLIO STAKEHOLdER ENGAGEMENT
Organizational strategy defines the path of an organization toward achieving its vision. Portfolio management is the 
means by which an organization implements a defined strategy by directing the limited resources of the organization 
to the portfolio components that most support the strategy realization. The implementation of an organizational 
strategy is also important for other organizations or individuals dealing with the organization.
Portfolio stakeholders are the individuals, organizations, or groups that can affect, may be affected by, or perceive 
themselves to be affected by a decision, activity, or outcome of a portfolio. In addition, individuals, organizations, or 
groups that could affect the organization’s ability to achieve its objectives (positively or negatively) should also be 
treated as stakeholders. A large number of individuals and groups could be considered stakeholders, being somehow 
directly or indirectly affected by portfolio activities. When it comes to engaging and communicating with them, the 
question is on whom to focus and how to condense the long list of potential stakeholders. The stakeholder list at the 
portfolio level is significantly different from the list at the portfolio component level. The difference is not only related 
to the stakeholder level (i.e., frequently a portfolio-level stakeholder will be at a higher management level), but is 
also related to the level of interest of the involved stakeholders. Portfolio Stakeholder Engagement deals primarily 
with delivering strategies and allocating resources, whereas programs deal primarily with benefits management, and 
projects deal with delivering scope in terms of quality, time, and cost. These different interests mean that different 
roles will be considered for the stakeholders of a portfolio versus the stakeholders of a component.
An integral part of stakeholder engagement is portfolio communications management, which includes developing 
a portfolio communications management plan and managing the dissemination of portfolio information. The 
communication strategy focuses on generating and/or obtaining all relevant data and on satisfying the most important 
information needs of stakeholders so that effective portfolio decisions are made and organizational objectives are 
met. Transparency may be a communication strategy to mitigate the risk of inadequate communication. Transparency 
with priorities and status provides credibility for the portfolio manager, enables good relationships with stakeholders, 
and helps reduce the chance of resources working on efforts that are not aligned with the organizational strategy and 
objectives.

6.1 OVERVIEW
Stakeholder engagement includes practical implementation topics, such as working with portfolio stakeholders to 
maximize portfolio and organizational performance. A portfolio manager communicates frequently with stakeholders 
using modes and techniques appropriate for the context. The portfolio manager facilitates communications among 
stakeholders to negotiate agreements and make portfolio decisions.
Three main stakeholder groups can be identified as affected by the portfolio execution:
u
u Executive leaders and managers of an organization. These stakeholders need access to the resources of 
the organization to perform and achieve their given objectives. Every time portfolio management results in the 
shifting of resources from one (potential) component to another, the key interests of executive leaders and 
managers are affected.
u
u Internal or external organizations and individuals working for a portfolio component. These stakeholders 
have a strong personal interest connected to the funding and direction of the relative component. The portfolio 
heavily influences decisions to start and continue the work on these components.
u
u Internal or external users and customers of the portfolio components. These stakeholders (individuals as 
well as organizations) have both implicitly and explicitly documented requirements connected with the portfolio 
components. The prioritization of the components in the portfolio affects the satisfaction of these expectations.
Together with these main stakeholder groups, many other stakeholders can be affected by a portfolio, including 
process owners, suppliers, individuals responsible for governance, shareholders, governments, and even the public 
at large.
The successful execution of the portfolio and its components, which has a strong impact on the interests of these 
stakeholders, is also heavily influenced by them. Portfolio Stakeholder Engagement is concerned with all forms of 
communication directed to inform, influence, and enable stakeholders at the portfolio level.
Engaging stakeholders is not the end objective of the activities and approaches described in this section. Rather, 
it is a means by which the portfolio manager supports the achievement of excellence in executing defined strategies. 
This implies enabling transparency, responsibility, accountability, and fairness; ensuring that investments in portfolio 
components are aligned with the organization’s strategy and governance practices; and obtaining and maintaining the 
sponsorship and engagement of senior management and key stakeholders. Effective Portfolio Stakeholder Engagement 
and communications management will foster a culture that embraces change and risk while supporting the organization 
in navigating complexity to enable successful outcomes (refer to Navigating Complexity: A Practice Guide [5]).
Well-engaged stakeholders have a clear understanding of the portfolio’s value and direction. They are transparently 
informed regarding the impact of the portfolio on their interests and will have as much opportunity as possible to align 
these interests with the interests of the portfolio. Stakeholders with opposing interests are enabled to reconcile their 
expectations in light of the higher value of strategy realization.
The key iterative steps of stakeholder engagement and communication include the following aspects, which will 
be discussed further in subsequent sections:
u
u Stakeholder identification and analysis. Identifying and analyzing the stakeholders who operate at the 
strategic level and then setting plans for engagement.

65
u
u Stakeholder engagement planning. Outlining the portfolio management principles, processes, and activities 
to engage stakeholders.
u
u Stakeholder engagement activities. Providing timely assessments of portfolio component selection, 
prioritization, and performance, as well as early identification of portfolio-level issues and risks.
The management of portfolio communication approaches is described in Section 6.6.
Portfolio communication facilitates a two-way effective dialogue between affected internal and external 
stakeholders, individuals, or groups, including:
u
u Executive managers;
u
u Operations managers;
u
u Governing bodies;
u
u Sponsors;
u
u Project, program, and subsidiary portfolio managers;
u
u Suppliers and external resource providers;
u
u Regulatory bodies; and
u
u Others.
In order to develop the portfolio communications management plan, stakeholder identification and analysis are 
necessary in addition to the determination of communications requirements.
In planning portfolio communication, the portfolio management plan may identify some of the primary stakeholders, 
such as executive managers and sponsors, who are accountable for the success of the portfolio. Planning may uncover 
additional stakeholders that require or may benefit from knowledge of the portfolio’s progress, performance, and 
changes. These additional discoveries are reflected as updates to the portfolio management plan. As a comprehensive 
list of stakeholders is compiled, it is important to determine the stakeholders’ information needs and their preferred 
mode of communication. Developing a strong communications management plan requires inputs from a variety of 
other portfolio management processes, such as performance and risk management.
Portfolio communication recognizes broad and varied stakeholders, from executive management to individuals 
performing the basic tasks and third parties. The information needs of portfolio stakeholders are much more varied 
than the program/project-level communication, primarily because of the breadth and variety of stakeholders. 
Transparency in planning portfolio management reporting is important for discovering early if elements are missing 
and for managing risk as a result of insufficient or inconsistent communication. Transparent communication is also 
valuable when planning for the optimal utilization of resources.
Table 6-1 lists the various stakeholder roles and their typical level of interest in the portfolio as a guide to their 
potential communication requirements.

6.2 GuIdING PRINCIPLES
Because all processes and activities in portfolio management involve some sort of communication, it could be 
stated that stakeholder engagement synergizes with all the other performance management domains of this standard. 
The focus of this section is less on the regular exchange of information that is directly connected to the performance 
of portfolio management functions and more on the conscious activity of engaging portfolio stakeholders through 
two-way communication and interaction.

67
Although all the principles outlined in Section 1.7 are relevant for Portfolio Stakeholder Engagement and 
for communications management, the following principles are especially important in providing guidance to the 
approaches and activities described in this section:
u
u Achieve excellence in strategic execution;
u
u Enable transparency, responsibility, accountability, sustainability, and fairness;
u
u Ensure that investments in portfolio components are aligned with the organization’s strategy and governance 
practices;
u
u Obtain and maintain the sponsorship and engagement of senior management and key stakeholders;
u
u Foster a culture that embraces change and risk; and
u
u Navigate complexity to enable successful outcomes.
6.3 dEFINITION ANd IdENTIFICATION OF PORTFOLIO STAKEHOLdERS
Stakeholders are ubiquitous across all aspects of portfolio, program, and project management. Therefore, there 
is great similarity in identifying and analyzing stakeholders across various domains. What distinguishes portfolio 
stakeholder identification and analysis from program or project stakeholder engagement?
Although portfolio management activities are useful in program management and even in project management, 
Portfolio Stakeholder Engagement is essentially a strategic activity. Portfolio Stakeholder Engagement primarily deals 
with the stakeholders that operate at a strategic level, more so than those that operate directly at the program or 
project level. For example, depending on the project, the project staff may not even be aware of the stakeholders who 
are critical to the ongoing operations and the future of the organization.
It may also be that there are agreements and relationships at the strategic level that need to be honored in 
component programs and projects. This section concentrates on identifying the stakeholders who operate at the 
strategic level, and then setting the plans for engagement. These are the policies and procedures of which all program 
and project stakeholders within the scope of the portfolio should be appropriately cognizant.
At this level, stakeholders include both key individuals as well as entities. In addition to acting at the strategic level, 
the key focus of portfolio stakeholders is the delivery of strategy—specifically, the strategic initiatives that have been 
allocated to the portfolio.
It is critical that portfolio stakeholder identification and analysis activities do not inhibit or constrain the interactions 
with programs and projects more than necessary. Therefore, the focus is on guidance and enablement, rather than 
constraint (although the latter may occur because of agreements that are in place among stakeholders that should 
be taken into account).
At the strategic level, the portfolio manager has access to information that may not be available at lower levels 
in the organization. The portfolio manager plays a key role in ensuring the alignment of current and future projects 
with the organizational strategy, and may possess knowledge of how organizational capability will develop and what 
competences and capabilities will become available to programs and projects.

68 
The Standard for Portfolio Management – Fourth Edition
Because of the potentially sensitive nature of portfolio information, especially relative to competitive and proprietary 
information generated and available at the highest levels of the organization, precautions are usually established 
and enforced to limit access to certain stakeholders (those who might seek to potentially negatively impact an 
organization’s performance of strategic objectives), as well as those who would be negatively disposed to priority 
decisions. This group of stakeholders could include competitors, suppliers, or customers. This latter concern should 
be appropriately addressed within the governance guidelines at the organizational and portfolio levels.
6.3.1 CaTEgorIzaTIon oF STaKEholdErS
The existence of portfolio management in an organization implies that there are many programs or projects 
contemplated or in execution within the organization. By nature, any large organization operates in an environment 
that includes actual and potential suppliers, customers, competitors, regulators, and other interested parties, in 
addition to the internal stakeholders of the organization.
By devising a taxonomy (an ordered arrangement of groups or categories), the task of categorizing strategic 
stakeholders can be made easier. The common language that is developed improves the interaction among portfolio 
components and helps reduce conflict. For example, when there are many programs or projects in a portfolio, there 
may be competition for scarce resources. Standardized terminology can make it easier to resolve these issues. It can 
also help to establish lists of external stakeholders with whom prearrangements can be made (e.g., approved vendors 
list). These and other common activities can reduce portfolio component start-up time and improve communication 
among component managers and stakeholders.
Using the organization’s strategy for guidance, portfolio managers can identify types of stakeholders and start 
identifying preferred parties with whom to establish and maintain relationships (and maintain those relationships to 
further programs and projects).
Note also that strategy is a relative term that depends on the domain in which the portfolio exists. For example, it 
might be at the international or national level (e.g., the United Nations or government), organizational level, or even at 
a business unit or lower level.
Because the marketplace is dynamic, categorizing stakeholders needs to be an ongoing activity, for as long as a 
portfolio exists. Examples of categories of stakeholders include:
u
u Senior executives,
u
u Strategic alliances,
u
u Contractors,
u
u Regulatory bodies,
u
u Competitors,
u
u Interest and action groups,
u
u Customer segments, and
u
u Other parties that would operate at the portfolio level.
These stakeholders are mainly organizations, but they could also include specific, highly influential individuals.

69
6.3.2 IdEnTIFyIng STaKEholdErS
Portfolio management guides and directs the overall portfolio and its components. Program management may 
do this also, as well as steer, but it is the role of project management to execute, and it is important that portfolio 
management does not overstep its responsibility. This applies to stakeholder engagement as well. It is important that 
Portfolio Stakeholder Engagement is understood and an outline of the scope of operation is developed. As suggested 
previously, Portfolio Stakeholder Engagement tends to focus at the strategic level, and not so much at the tactical 
level; however, suggestions may be offered and stipulations may be made when necessary in order to avoid placing 
unnecessary constraints on programs and projects.
6.4 ANALYSIS OF PORTFOLIO STAKEHOLdERS
The identification of stakeholders is an ongoing process. Periodically, a rough-cut analysis should be performed to 
identify whether stakeholders may be conveniently grouped. However, it is important to remember that in every group, 
there are key members who need to be handled separately and individually.
In order to identify the key concerns (or perspectives) of the stakeholders, it may be useful to express those 
concerns as shown in Table 6-2.

Table 6-2. Example of Key Stakeholder Context
The key functions of the portfolio manager are to interpret the organizational strategy and understand the strategic 
initiatives to the degree that components can be identified, categorized, and evaluated so that they may be combined—
for example, as programs or run as single projects.
As indicated in Table 6-2, every portfolio has stakeholders who operate at different levels and have different 
interests. Common terms can be used to identify them. Some have specific interests, while others (e.g., a regulatory 
body) may have an overriding interest to ensure that the interests of one stakeholder do not impact others more 
than necessary. For example, many countries have rules that govern competition, and there may be severe penalties 
for what may be regarded as collusion. It is important to gather information about these rules and include it in the 
guidance for programs and projects.

70 
The Standard for Portfolio Management – Fourth Edition
6.5 STAKEHOLdER ENGAGEMENT PLANNING
Stakeholder engagement planning is one of the key activities of the portfolio manager. The portfolio manager 
focuses on understanding the organizational strategy and translating/aligning that strategy with the operations plan 
in the organization including communication. There has to be a clear linkage between the components being executed 
in the operations plan and how those initiatives support the organizational strategy.
Because all strategic plans are reviewed and revised regularly, especially in a competitive and ever-changing 
world market, the portfolio should be reviewed frequently to ensure alignment between the revised strategy and 
the operational plan initiatives being executed. Therefore, the stakeholder engagement plan should include triggers 
for communication and further engagement with stakeholders as the portfolio undergoes review and adjustment to 
strategic plan changes.
6.6 IdENTIFYING COMMuNICATIONS MANAGEMENT APPROACHES
In identifying the most effective ways to approach communications within the portfolio, many factors should be 
taken into account. These range from the portfolio governance practices and processes of the organization to the 
resources available to the portfolio management team and their use within the guidelines of the portfolio roadmap 
and portfolio management plan.
6.6.1 alIgnMEnT WITh goVErnanCE
It is important to ensure that the portfolio communications management plan is aligned with the organization’s 
portfolio governance requirements and processes. Portfolio managers should ensure that they have access to these 
processes and, if the organization does not have formal documents, then the portfolio team needs to develop the 
required governance to run the portfolio and have it approved by the sponsor.
These principles and objectives should be incorporated into the communications management plan. Senior 
management defines organizational governance based on the fundamental norms, rules, and values of the organization, 
which are used as a basis for developing portfolio governance practices, including communications management. 
As portfolio governance practices incorporate the governance principles of the organization, they flow down to the 
portfolio components so as to provide control, integration, decision making, and general oversight.
6.6.2 CoMMunICaTIon InFraSTruCTurE
The portfolio includes the list of approved and potential portfolio components as well as other descriptive information 
on the components, such as dependencies, level of effort, points of contact, and other dashboard-type information. 
Communication infrastructure includes all of the organizational and portfolio management processes, policies, and 
technologies used to communicate portfolio status. Knowledge of the components of the portfolio may have an 
effect on the communication approach used for consolidating and standardizing communication and evaluating 
communication strategy at a portfolio (as opposed to a component) level. The portfolio list of components is critical in 
understanding the full scope of communication needed.

71
The portfolio roadmap helps with understanding the structure of the portfolio, identifying interdependencies among 
the portfolio components, and determining how the portfolio components fit together in order to lay out the plan for 
achieving organizational strategy and objectives. Clear and timely communication of the roadmap and any changes 
to it is a fundamental part of portfolio communications. The portfolio communications management plan may include 
information about interdependencies among the portfolio’s components that could impact portfolio communication 
objectives.
6.6.3 PorTFolIo ManagEMEnT Plan
The portfolio management plan provides the scope and objectives of the portfolio and the initial list of primary 
internal and external portfolio stakeholders, including the governance model. The portfolio management plan is 
the guiding artifact that establishes portfolio-level dependencies and constraints to allow for effective oversight. 
The portfolio management plan describes the planned approach for identifying, analyzing, selecting, approving, 
prioritizing, and scheduling the portfolio components and setting priorities. All elements of the portfolio management 
plan have communication requirements, such as risks that need to be communicated to the governing body, the 
portfolio manager, and the stakeholders. Changes in the portfolio management plan may introduce new stakeholders 
or new communication requirements.
The portfolio communications management plan may be a subsidiary plan to the portfolio management plan or it 
may be included within the portfolio management plan. The portfolio governance plan may also be subsidiary to the 
portfolio management plan.
6.6.4 PorTFolIo rEPorTS
Portfolio reports include a variety of reports, such as portfolio status or progress reports, performance reports, 
portfolio risk reports, portfolio dashboards, spreadsheets, and summary reports from the overall governance of 
portfolio components. Portfolio performance reports can provide information on the total investment in each portfolio 
component, which serves as the communication of assessed portfolio value. Some organizations communicate with 
dashboards to provide status information at a glance. The format and content of these reports should be defined in 
the portfolio communications management plan, providing templates, standard forms, processes, and procedures for 
planned portfolio reporting.
6.6.5 PorTFolIo ProCESS aSSETS
Portfolio process assets related to planning portfolio communication include, but are not limited to:
u
u Manager roles and responsibilities,
u
u Status reports,
u
u Risk profile or risk assessment with key risks and issues,
u
u Forecasts with variance to plan,

72 
The Standard for Portfolio Management – Fourth Edition
u
u Governance decisions,
u
u Funding decisions,
u
u Resource decisions,
u
u Value assessments, and
u
u Delegations of responsibility for communication.
6.6.6 CoMMunICaTIon goVErnanCE and InTErFaCE To CoMPonEnTS
The successful exercise of portfolio governance is fully dependent on effective communication with all stakeholders. 
Careful analysis of the needs and desires of all participants is essential to ensure that the proper information flows in 
a timely and efficient manner.
6.6.6.1 ElICITaTIon TEChnIquES
As portfolio stakeholders and stakeholder communication requirements change over time, it is important for the 
portfolio manager to engage with stakeholders to ensure that the portfolio communications management plan is 
aligned with their needs. This may be achieved through interviews, questionnaires and surveys, stakeholder meetings, 
and lessons learned sessions on the effectiveness of communication.
By meeting with stakeholders, for example, the portfolio manager can review the planned communication to get 
feedback on the portfolio communications plan. Brainstorming can be helpful in identifying new stakeholder groups 
that were not previously considered, and in these meetings, portfolio stakeholders can confirm or recommend changes 
to the communication requirements.
6.6.6.2 CoMMunICaTIon rEquIrEMEnTS analySIS
In communication requirements analysis, the vehicle or tool used to communicate information to the stakeholders 
and the planned frequency is evaluated to determine whether changes should be made. A list of available 
communication methods is charted to evaluate alternatives and ensure that the optimal vehicle is being used to meet 
stakeholder needs.
Reviews are conducted to identify any redundant communication. Some redundancy is intentional so that 
multiple types of recipients are reached and recipients’ varied preferences for receiving information are met. 
Choices may need to be made to identify which communication is primary, which is secondary, and which should 
be discontinued.
A communication matrix may be used for capturing and recording the results of this analysis. Table 6-3 is an 
example of a communication matrix. The communication matrix is foundational to building the communications 
management plan.

*Multiple vehicles for sending a communication do not necessarily mean redundant communication. Sometimes multiple vehicles are necessary to reach different types of 
 recipients or the recipients have varied preferences for receiving the information.
Table 6-3. Example Communication Matrix
To complete a portfolio communication requirements analysis, an assessment of the organizational culture is helpful 
to ensure that the portfolio communications management plan is suitable for the organization. If the organization is 
generally comfortable with technology, portals may be planned more extensively as the primary vehicle for reporting 
information. If the organization is not comfortable with technology, it may prefer paper reports and emails. Updates 
for organizational culture can be reflected in the matrix.
6.7 MANAGE PORTFOLIO COMMuNICATIONS
In communicating with portfolio stakeholders, it is important that both agreed-upon governance and stakeholder 
communications requirements are constantly taken into consideration. This means that any changes to the portfolio 
content, governance, or roadmap are fed through to the stakeholders, and the communications metrics updated 
accordingly.
During portfolio management plan execution, new communication or information management needs and methods 
may be determined. These updates are included in the contents of the portfolio management plan or in the subsidiary 
portfolio communications management plan.

PORTFOLIO VALuE MANAGEMENT
Portfolio Value Management ensures that investment in a portfolio delivers the required return as defined in the 
organizational strategy, which is an expression of the stakeholder direction in defining portfolio components such as 
projects and programs.
The following major sections are addressed:
7.1 Overview
7.2 Guiding Principles
7.3 What Is Value Management?
7.4 Components of Value Management
7.5 Negotiating Expected Value
7.6 Maximizing Value
7.7 Assuring Value
7.8 Realizing Value
7.9 Measuring Value
7.10 Reporting Value
7.1 OVERVIEW
This section presents the Portfolio Value Management performance domain and discusses appropriate concepts, 
such as maximizing value, assuring value, and realizing value.
7.2 GuIdING PRINCIPLES
All portfolios are managed to enhance and maintain the value of the organization, whether that value is tangible 
or intangible. In order for value to be maximized, the organization should adhere to a set of principles to successfully 
guide it at the portfolio level. All of the principles outlined in Section 1.7 are important for value management. However, 
the following are especially applicable as they directly impact the value of the organization:
u
u Ensure that investments in portfolio components are aligned with the organization’s strategy and governance 
practices, and
u
u Balance the portfolio value against overall risks.

76 
The Standard for Portfolio Management – Fourth Edition
The objective of value management is independent of the nature of the organization. Whether the organization is a 
private company or a governmental agency, defining the organization’s value objectives drives its strategy, impacting 
its governance practices and strategic management processes, and how it approaches risk.
7.3 WHAT IS VALuE MANAGEMENT?
A search for a definition of value offers perspectives from a number of domains, including mathematics, ethics, 
economics, and management; however, they essentially all revolve around the idea that value is an indicator of the 
effect an entity or offering can deliver. That effect can be seen in a number of ways—for example, as increased 
revenue, increased profit, or reduced risk. Value is contextual. The effects that an organization seeks to command are 
driven by the purpose of the organization and its worldview, which is reflected in its strategy. The value of an entity 
or offering increases the more impactful it is and the more relevant to the organization’s strategy the impact is. An 
entity or offering is high in value where it has significant impact on an organization’s environment and where that 
impact is relevant to the organization’s strategy. Not all forms of value are universally relevant. Public sector bodies 
may seek reduced costs and increased citizen satisfaction and, therefore, value the measures that lead to that. Private 
sector organizations may value measures that lead to increased revenue and margin, while, in nongovernmental 
organizations (NGOs), those measures that best enhance outputs related to mission may be most valued.
Significance can also be undermined by redundancy. When an aid program is shipping food into a disaster area, the 
food has value, perhaps measured in terms of the number of survivors who did not experience starvation over a period 
of time. If food is shipped in faster than it can be distributed and the excess will perish before it can be consumed, 
then the excess stock has no value in the context of that particular program, because it will not contribute any impact.
For value to be recognized, metrics are required. Defined units of measurement and methods of making the 
measurements should exist and be relevant to the organization and the effects to be commanded (see Section 7.9 for 
more information on measurement). Metrics related to value may attach to tangible and intangible outputs or effects 
just as value may be tangible or intangible. Tangible value can be directly measured. It includes things such as:
u
u Skills uplift,
u
u Resource capacity,
u
u Market share, and
u
u Client satisfaction.
Economic value is a particular case of tangible value and, where an economic value can be assigned, will typically 
be a key consideration for a portfolio manager. Improvements in economic value can be realized by:
u
u Improving productivity, possibly by the substitution of capital for labor or by reducing the investment in input 
resources, such as human capital, financial assets, and intellectual capital; and
u
u Increasing the volume of activity, without necessarily increasing productivity.
Intangible value cannot be directly measured, although proxy measures will be possible. Intangible value includes 
things such as:
u
u Brand awareness,
u
u Organization’s reputation,

77
u
u Risk exposure,
u
u Compliance, and
u
u Societal value.
Measurement of value is not necessarily straightforward, particularly given that organizations operate in 
environments they cannot control and typically pursue multiple strategies to the same end. Though the value of a 
quoted organization based on its market capitalization may be directly and transparently measured, measuring the 
value based on consumer perceptions of the brand will likely require an indirect approach. A hotel chain may use 
a loyalty program to drive profit, but may have other programs with the same aim and may choose to try to isolate 
measurement of the impact of the loyalty program by measuring things such as membership count, net promoter 
scores from members, and the profit per member. A food aid program in a disaster area seeks to preserve life, but 
there may be other threats to life besides starvation, including disease and armed conflict. The aid agency may seek 
a more nuanced measurement beyond numbers surviving versus original population count, perhaps focusing on the 
number of people being treated for malnutrition or other afflictions.
7.4 COMPONENTS OF VALuE MANAGEMENT
There are a number of key activities required for effective Portfolio Value Management in the context of the links 
between the portfolio’s effect on the environment, the organization’s purpose, and the development of strategy leading 
to the creation of a portfolio or its reshaping. To effectively manage value, the portfolio manager should:
u
u Negotiate expected value. Negotiate the value to be created by the portfolio, considered at two levels:
u
n Against the aims of the organizational strategy for the portfolio as a whole, and
u
n Within the portfolio where each of its candidate components is assessed against the value framework 
negotiated for the portfolio.
u
u Maximize return. Maximize the return from the investment in the portfolio. Plan and enact an approach to 
deliver each component at the lowest, safe economic cost without negative impact to the required effects and 
value. This includes modeling and evaluating various approaches to satisfying the aims of the portfolio using 
techniques such as the portfolio efficient frontier and other applicable risk management tools and techniques.
u
u Realize value. Ensure that the value required to be realized by the investment in the portfolio is achieved. The 
key is recognizing that the environment into which the component will deliver its outputs is actively conditioned 
to exploit those outputs in pursuit of the required value.
u
u Measure performance. Measure the performance achieved by the outputs generated by the components 
in the portfolio—for instance, in support of a balanced scorecard. The portfolio manager should gather the 
agreed-upon metrics.
u
u Report value. Report the value achieved based on the metrics. This is a political act in that the value achieved 
consists of a narrative-related achievement in light of applicable risks, the impact of shifts in the environment, 
and possible changes in organizational purpose or worldview.
To achieve effective Portfolio Value Management, the portfolio manager needs to create a model of the portfolio’s 
requirements, influencing factors, and tolerances that will drive portfolio components toward realization of the value 
target. Figure 7-1 illustrates these points in the context of the links between the portfolio’s effect on the environment, 
the organization’s purpose, and the development of strategy leading to the creation of a portfolio or its reshaping.

Figure 7-1. Key Activities in Portfolio Value Management
There are two primary feedback loops from the portfolio to the strategy driving it. The first is the one that negotiates 
the expected portfolio value given the required value resulting from strategy development, assigned budget, enterprise 
environmental factors, external and internal risks, and organizational risk appetite. The second feedback loop acts 
more slowly, taking measurements of performance and achieved value and combining those with environmental 
observation and the organization’s purpose and worldview to shape strategy. This second feedback loop is the more 
impactful of the two.
Underpinning all of the activities discussed in this section are (a) the need to assure value at the portfolio level, 
establishing the approaches to be followed by the components and tracking the implementation of those approaches 
and their impact; and (b) the need to safeguard value. Value is safeguarded by effective management of the risks in 
the portfolio’s environment, recognizing that opportunity management is encompassed within risk management.
7.5 NEGOTIATING EXPECTEd VALuE
The portfolio manager negotiates the expected value to be achieved by the portfolio against the required value in 
order to ensure that the immediate goals developed by the strategy do not place the organization at risk of significant 
underachievement. As part of the negotiation, the portfolio manager removes redundant value and aligns expectations 
and risk appetite. The negotiation requires the portfolio manager to act as a bridge between the component owners 
and the strategy function within the organization.

79
The strategy is also informed by strategic investment choice. Investment choice relates to the alignment of the 
portfolio. This analysis focuses on the new and changing strategic objectives/goals and indicates where there are 
gaps in investment within the portfolio as a whole. Gaps may pose a risk to the portfolio.
Assessment approaches include but are not limited to the following:
u
u Trade-off analysis. Determines the effect of changing one or more factors of the portfolio.
u
u Market-payoff variability. Focuses on pricing and sales forecasts and depends on a number of marketing 
factors, whereby the effects of changing one or more of these factors may affect the portfolio itself or the 
portfolio strategy.
u
u budget variability. Determines the effect of changing the portfolio.
u
u Performance variability. Analyzes the performance of the portfolio.
u
u Market requirement variability. Analyzes changes in market requirements in relation to the portfolio.
u
u Time-to-market variability. Determines the effects of portfolio velocity.
There are three concepts that support the negotiation:
u
u Value management framework. A framework that provides a baseline for defining the target value for each 
component.
u
u Evidence-based value statements. Each portfolio component should generate a business case that has 
evidence-based (whether tangible or intangible) value statements about the value required, including timing, 
realization dependencies, and accountabilities.
u
u Efficient frontier. A modeling approach that gives decision makers the analytical tool to optimize portfolios 
given resource constraints.
7.6 MAXIMIzING VALuE
The return on investment (ROI) of the portfolio measures the value achieved for the input cost. Given that the 
required value has already been negotiated, the portfolio manager should aim to realize the value required from the 
portfolio at the lowest, safe economic cost. The portfolio manager has a number of tools available to achieve this, 
including:
u
u Risk appetite related to input and output quality assigned to components,
u
u Design guidance applied to components to prevent over-specification of solution elements,
u
u Application of solution constraints to force synergy between components in the portfolio or between components 
in the portfolio and components in other portfolios,
u
u Requirement on individual components to exercise effective financial management,
u
u Exercise of effective financial management at the portfolio level, and
u
u Use of the efficient frontier.

80 
The Standard for Portfolio Management – Fourth Edition
There is an organizational risk that the portfolio focuses too heavily on maximizing the return, losing sight of its true 
requirement, which is to return value. It becomes very easy to move to a regime where the organization and, therefore, 
the portfolio manager becomes focused on cost and loses sight of value, undermining the return achieved. Effective 
portfolio financial management is a key part of maximizing return in this model.
Portfolio financial management includes the activities involved in identifying the portfolio’s financial sources and 
resources, determining inputs into the ideation process, establishing the overall budget for the portfolio, integrating 
the budgets of the portfolio components, securing approval of financial changes of ongoing components through 
governance, and monitoring and controlling costs throughout the duration of the portfolio. It rests on five pillars:
u
u Portfolio financial framework. Specifies the system and methods for coordinating available funding, 
determining constraints, and specifying how funds are allocated in order to align the use of financial resources 
with strategic goals and priorities.
u
u Portfolio financial management plan. A component of the value management framework that documents 
the portfolio’s financial aspects: funding schedules and milestones, initial budget, contract payments and 
schedules, financial reporting activities and mechanisms (including external reporting obligations, e.g., 
statutory), and the financial metrics. The portfolio financial management plan may also be referenced from the 
portfolio management plan.
u
u Portfolio component cost estimations. Used to determine a bottom-up budget compilation for the portfolio.
u
u Portfolio budget. Established by compiling all available financial information and listing all funding and 
payment schedules in sufficient detail so that the portfolio’s costs can be tracked as part of the portfolio 
budget baseline.
u
u Financial management effort. Once the portfolio receives initial funding and begins paying for component 
expenses, the financial management effort moves into tracking, monitoring, and controlling the portfolio’s 
funds and expenditures together with the financial measures related to the expected benefits.
7.7 ASSuRING VALuE
The purpose of value assurance is to ensure that the portfolio can realize the negotiated required value, reflected in 
the plan for execution of the components of the portfolio. Value is an aggregation of the output from its components. 
Projects produce deliverables—for example, the online registration and account management system for a membership 
application process. Programs deliver benefits. In the hotel loyalty scheme, for instance, a program might redefine 
the membership application process and membership levels. The benefits could include simplified administration and 
improved management information for targeted marketing.
The underlying premise is that if a portfolio component successfully builds its assigned deliverables, it can make 
its contribution to the chain that links the deliverables to component outcome to benefit to value all the way to the 
organization’s mission, as shown in Figure 7-2. The diagram shows how the portfolio value will be undermined if 
components produce deliverables that fail to enable the target changes. Value assurance aims to mitigate that risk. 
The benefits of a program are typically realized as each component project finishes. With some exceptions (i.e., early 
benefits realization), the benefits of each individual project appear only after the project finishes. While Figure 7-2 
shows a cycle, activity at any point can be continuous, for example, the organization may continuously develop and 
refine new strategies. If the organization is disrupted, then it can develop a response by intervening at whichever point 
is most appropriate.

Figure 7-2. The Link between Strategy and Portfolio Performance via Component deliverable
The portfolio manager inherits a set of principles and constraints related to the approach to value assurance, adapts 
those for the nature of the portfolio, and then communicates them to the components. Although the results of value 
assurance are addressed at the portfolio level on a continuing basis, value assurance is enacted at a detailed level 
within each component, appropriately considering risks at all levels, from component to overall portfolio. Referring back 
to the loyalty program example in Section 7.3, each component contributes to one or more deliverables, each of which 
contributes to the achievement of the expected value. The contribution runs from specific component deliverables via 
the outcomes that those deliverables enable to a benefit—in this case, a change in the membership numbers to the 
realized value, which is the number of members. For each component in progress, the key is to ensure, on a continual 
basis, that the component will provide the anticipated deliverable(s). There are four approaches to accomplish this 
where the portfolio manager requires action by the components. While details related to them can be found in other 
PMI standards, they are touched on briefly here to illustrate the portfolio manager’s interest:
u
u Requirements tracing. The portfolio manager should require that each component relate its requirements to 
its constituent work packages and require reporting on the results to provide early and continual confirmation 

82 
The Standard for Portfolio Management – Fourth Edition
that the component will address its assigned scope, with the appropriate level of risk response activity 
consistent with the organization’s risk appetite.
u
u Acceptance criteria. Every requirement needs one or more acceptance criteria. Acceptance criteria are not the 
same as completion criteria. Completion criteria define when a task is finished; acceptance criteria describe 
when work on the task can stop. For example, there may be a task for which the completion criterion is “plan 
agreed upon.” In this case, the acceptance criterion defines the nature of the agreement. Reported agreement of 
acceptance criteria provides a portfolio manager with an indication of component risk. When acceptance criteria 
cannot be readily agreed upon, this suggests that there are some fundamental disagreements in the component’s 
stakeholder community that risk undermining the component’s contribution to the portfolio’s expected return.
u
u Gated reviews. At various defined points, the work within a component should be reviewed and evidence provided 
of the satisfaction (or not) of requirements, together with confirmation of the work still required to meet the 
requirements. The reported results of gated reviews provide the portfolio manager with an indication that the 
component is on course to meet its required scope. The key here is to get the right number of gates in the right place 
in the component’s life cycle, with the appropriate cost of change comprehension factored into the risk equation.
u
u Quality assurance. The previous three concepts described help underpin a robust quality management 
regime, but that needs to be supported, in turn, by effective quality assurance to ensure compliance. Quality 
assurance provides a key, value-related risk indicator to the portfolio manager who should have significant 
input into shaping it for the needs of the portfolio.
7.8 REALIzING VALuE
Portfolio managers should be responsible for ensuring that the overall portfolio realizes its negotiated required value. 
Therefore, they need to ensure that the components receiving outputs from other components in the portfolio exploit 
those outputs effectively and deliver the targeted benefits so that the portfolio’s expected value continues to align with 
the requirement. It should be noted that accountability for ensuring that the overall portfolio realizes its required value 
lies with the sponsors of the portfolio.
For example, an organization might set out to increase its profitability by consolidating its real estate. It could choose 
to start down that path by ensuring that individual members of staff no longer rely on access to a specific desktop PC 
at a specific desk and, instead, use a laptop or access a virtual desktop. To do this, it could task one component in the 
related portfolio with developing the virtual desktop solution. In this case, the intent behind value realization would be 
that those parts of the organization targeted to use the laptops and virtual desktops would actually do so and do so in 
a manner that would allow for the retirement of individually dedicated desktop computers in the anticipated number 
and with no adverse impact on the organization’s operations.
Successful realization of value is essentially concerned with management of change in the target components, 
ensuring that the required changes around a component are identified, planned, and executed effectively. The term 
management of change is used in this context to refer to people-centric changes aimed at driving and embedding 
change in response to the outputs of the portfolio. This is distinct from the change management tasks that portfolio, 
program, and project managers carry out as they navigate the execution of planning and delivery. Realization takes 
place in the service components of a portfolio: The program and project components are about enablement. The 
expected value of components can change as portfolio components are planned, developed, and executed. Changes 
in actual scope, schedule, cost, or performance can affect the expected value. External factors such as market 

83
conditions, competitor actions, laws and regulations, risks realized, and other factors can also affect whether the 
expected value at delivery of the products, services, or assets created or enhanced has changed.
Risk management and risk impact also contribute to the final value of the portfolio. As execution of the portfolio 
unfolds, the portfolio manager can update the forecast of the portfolio’s value and maintain that forecast over time 
in light of progress and changes in the environment using the same techniques that were used initially to estimate.

Figure 7-3. Value Realization Chain
Portfolio value, or performance, is an aggregation of the value of the portfolio’s components plus synergy effects 
and effects that occur from having an optimal mix of resources aligned to the portfolio components. Figure 7-3 shows 
how investment degrades the value of the portfolio. The amount of investment may be fixed, but change control and 
the consumption of risk budgets may allow for some variation in the actual investment. Value realization enhances the 
overall value of the portfolio. Although there is a target to be achieved, variation is likely. Therefore, the overall impact 
of the value realization chain should be to enhance the value of the portfolio, though likely by an amount other than 
the anticipated target.

84 
The Standard for Portfolio Management – Fourth Edition
7.9 MEASuRING VALuE
The value measurement framework defines how value will be measured for the portfolio (see Section 7.4). 
Recognizing that reporting value is essentially an act of organizational politics, the keys in measuring performance 
are compliance with the agreed-upon value measurement framework, effective stakeholder buy-in, and transparency 
in execution. Within program components, value is usually defined by the benefit that the program yields, making 
benefits realization analysis an important technique. As executable components, such as programs and projects, begin 
to deliver, it becomes possible to start making immediate measures of the benefits of those deliverables. The portfolio 
manager should require appropriate measurement approaches to be in place in the components that are impacted by 
the deliverables and have them report, on a continual basis, progress in realizing the benefit against the plan.
7.10 REPORTING VALuE
Portfolio value reporting will provide information about the performance and forecasts of the portfolio. These 
reports also include identification of variances, analysis of variances, and recommendations for corrective action or 
optimization. Each portfolio component will actively track its delivered value and will forecast value risk tolerance and 
the current assessed risk level. Reporting will address a number of topics, each more political than its predecessors, 
including but not limited to the following:
u
u Risk reporting. This includes the risk status and probable impact on portfolio value should it occur.
u
u Costs required to achieve required portfolio outcomes. These costs should be an objective fact.
u
u Reasons for any shift in those costs. There may be some objective facts in the mix, but in many organizations, 
it may be difficult to establish a universally agreed-upon view as to the reasons for the shift.
u
u Cost synergies achieved between portfolio components. Synergies can be positive (reduce the cost) or 
negative (increase the cost). In any case, their identification and reporting is unlikely to be entirely objective. 
The invest/divest decision process is likely to result in an amalgamation of leadership intuition along with 
empirical data where sunk costs in resources used across various portfolio components may result in net cost 
savings across the entire portfolio or across multiple portfolios.
u
u Value achieved by the portfolio. This is unlikely to be entirely objective. This section has explained how 
environmental complexity can undermine isolating the impact of the portfolio from other factors. Stakeholder 
buy-in for the value measurement framework and consistent and transparent execution help achieve consensus.
u
u Reasons for any shift in value. These are unlikely to be objective. Service performance is squeezed both 
by the performance of the programs designed to enable increased value and by changes in the environment, 
including organizational strategy, none of which can be controlled.

PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT
The primary objective of Portfolio Risk Management is to make sure that portfolio components will achieve the 
best possible success according to the organization’s strategy and business model. From a risk perspective, this is 
done through the balancing of risks, both positive (opportunities) and negative (threats). The managing of risks below 
the portfolio level is usually thought of as exploiting opportunities and avoiding threats. However, when dealing with 
complexity at the portfolio level, the simple approach of avoiding threats and exploiting opportunities may not result 
in a complete balancing of portfolio risks. Portfolio Risk Management aligns portfolio components, organizational 
strategy, the business model, and environmental factors toward the objective of portfolio value optimization and 
results in a synchronized portfolio execution across portfolio components. Risk and change should be embraced and 
navigated within an environment of nonlinear interactions. Within this nonlinear environment, specific portfolio-level 
risks are addressed by the portfolio management team with the goal of optimizing value for the organization. Risk and 
change are thus embraced and navigated within an environment of nonlinear interactions with the goal of maximizing 
value for the organization.
The following major sections are addressed:
8.1 Overview
8.2 Guiding Principles
8.3 Portfolio Risk Management
8.4 Key Planning Elements
8.5 Portfolio Risk Management Framework and Portfolio Risk Management Plan
8.1 OVERVIEW
Risk management involves the identification and balancing of risk factors (environmental, human, legislation, 
compliance, etc.) to efficiently and effectively enable portfolio value delivery. At and above the portfolio level, value is 
measured by how well the portfolio supports organizational strategic goals and objectives. These goals and objectives 
are achieved, in part, by aligning responsibility and accountability for risk management with the organizational business 
model. The dependencies among diverse risk factors result in emergent risks that require a holistic Portfolio Risk 
Management approach. Therefore, a simple decomposition approach to risk management, as seen at the program 
and project level, is not appropriate when dealing with portfolio-level risk factors.
Portfolio Risk Management is a domain composed of models and cross-functional processes. The portfolio risk 
management framework enables portfolio managers to allocate current capital and resources within the capacity 
constraints of the organization and in harmony with organizational risk governance to obtain future benefits. Factors 
considered include, but are not limited to, overall risk appetite, frequency, severity, the specific risk thresholds, key 

86 
The Standard for Portfolio Management – Fourth Edition
portfolio stakeholder makeup, and diversification. For example, when a choice needs to be made with regard to certain 
portfolio models or statistical techniques, such as expected monetary value (EMV), EMV may be used to calculate 
metrics to help the decision maker arrive at a decision. The goal is to balance the risk reward or value options in 
order to optimize the delivery of value while maintaining an acceptable level of risk exposure. Other models may 
also be used; however, the process is similar. The decision maker selects a course of action based on modeling used 
within the organization’s portfolio risk management framework and aligned with the organization’s risk governance 
processes.
The primary objective of Portfolio Risk Management is to meet the value proposition of the portfolio while aligning 
to an agreed-upon confidence level and/or portfolio-level risk threshold. This is usually done through the balancing 
of both positive (opportunities) and negative (threats) risks. The key is that at the portfolio level, risk elements are 
balanced and not necessarily maximized or minimized against various parameters.
8.2 GuIdING PRINCIPLES
Risk principles are based on transparency, integrity, and organizational objectivity. Principles that guide 
portfolio risk management include: (a) management considerations, and (b) a need to step beyond mechanical 
calculations of risk exposure. At the portfolio level, risk management includes both the internal and external 
factors of the portfolio. Complexity drives risk management beyond isolated response strategies requiring a 
balancing of risk to achieve an equilibrium between threats and opportunities. The objective of portfolio risk 
management is to meet the value proposition of the portfolio while aligning to an agreed-upon confidence level 
and/or portfolio-level risk threshold through a balancing process of both threats and opportunities. Risk balancing 
thus contributes to maximizing the probability that the portfolio will support strategic objectives within the value 
proposition constraints.
Section 1.7 lists eight fundamental principles that are central to the management of portfolios. All eight principles 
apply to risk management. However, the following principles are central to risk management processes at the portfolio 
level:
u
u Maximize portfolio value while balancing risks;
u
u Foster a culture that embraces change and risk; and
u
u Navigate complexity to enable successful outcomes.
The result of the combination of these three principles, from a holistic perspective, allows a balancing of portfolio 
components through an organized risk assessment process. This process should be proactively implemented by 
portfolio management to prevent or minimize loss and encourage opportunity exploitation.
8.2.1 ManagIng PorTFolIo rISK
Portfolio risk management processes help managers identify and analyze portfolio risks. The goal of risk 
management at the portfolio level is to maximize the probability that the portfolio will meet its strategic goals 
and objectives within the organization’s strategic vision. The objective of balancing threat and opportunity is to 
maximize the potential to deliver optimum value to the organization in the short-, medium-, and longer-term 
time frames.

87
Portfolio risk management differs from project risk management in that the goal of risk management at the project 
level is to minimize threats and maximize opportunities. Additionally, a program or project is concerned with risks 
and issues that arise inside the specific program or project. Portfolios are concerned with (a) maximizing the value of 
the portfolio; (b) tailoring the fit of the portfolio to the organizational vision, strategy, and objectives by aligning with 
the business model; and (c) determining how to balance the programs and projects within the portfolio given the 
organization’s capacities and capabilities.
As the value and size of a component increases, risk impact increases in relative proportion depending on 
severity and frequency parameters. For example, within a portfolio, threats may not be minimized if there is 
potential for value by taking on additional negative risks. Under the right circumstances, the organization may 
choose to actively embrace appropriate threats in anticipation of high rewards. Take the case of investing in 
new, unproven technology with a view of being “first in the market” in anticipation of highly profitable sales. It is 
possible that the technology may not work, and that the market may not accept the new product; alternatively, 
the product may be successful and highly profitable. The portfolio manager should balance the possibility of the 
technology failing (experiencing a program or project failure within the portfolio) with the potential for future 
profits (other program or project successes within the portfolio). The technology development program may 
deliberately accept threats to cost, schedule, and scope in anticipation of being able to deliver the benefit of 
new technology that could support other programs or projects in the portfolio or even other portfolios. The value 
realization extends beyond the program or project to the organization. Finally, there is also the consideration of 
the effects of very low probability, but high-impact threats. Portfolio managers should be aware of the possible 
catastrophic results of very low probability but high-impact threats as exemplified by the recent collapse of 
mortgage sector securities.
Risk conditions include aspects of an organization’s environment that may contribute to portfolio risk, such as 
poor management practices (negative risk), integrated management systems (positive risk), lean processes (positive 
risk), an excessive number of concurrent projects (negative risk), or dependency on external participants who are 
highly specialized (positive or negative risk). These conditions are not in and of themselves risks; however, these 
conditions may result in an environment where risks have a great potential to materialize into issues. For example, 
an organization that is highly dependent on external specialized participants may have a greater probability of losing 
those participants (negative risk). Because these individuals are specialized, there is a greater probability that their 
inputs will be key and critical to managing portfolio actions (positive risk). The portfolio manager weighs both the 
positive and negative aspects of risk associated with having external participants. This is not a simple minimization 
or maximization problem.
Portfolio risk management also includes providing reserves (management or contingency) across the risk pool to 
cover both a portion (if not all) of aggregate portfolio risks and risks within the component programs and projects. 
The portfolio manager is in a position to hold an aggregate contingency to cover threats and/or opportunities 
where the expected monetary value is an unreliable guide for contingency or reserve calculation because of a less 
than statistically significant number of risks within an individual portfolio component. Expected monetary value is 
unreliable when dealing with risks that have very high impact and very low probability. A portfolio manager may 
also aggregate risk responses by using some common characteristic (i.e., impact or consequence of the threat or 
opportunity when describing positive risk). In other words, portfolio contribution to risk management is primarily to 
exploit the opportunity of economic scale. It is a contingency provision for the constituent programs and projects in 
cases where each component cannot economically fund protection from threats.

88 
The Standard for Portfolio Management – Fourth Edition
In other words, the portfolio management role in risk management is primarily to exploit the opportunity offered 
by the economies of scale and trade-offs between components through the balancing of positive and negative risks. 
One key contribution, but not the only one, is the provision of a shared contingency for the constituent components 
(programs, projects, and operations) to address cases where the impact of a common threat or opportunity is accepted 
at the strategic level but is greater than any single component can tolerate or exploit. This provision is called the 
management reserve. In the case of opportunities, the potential impact of the opportunity being addressed at the 
strategic level is the planned value of the corresponding initiative as defined in the business justification document 
that was approved to sanction its inclusion in the portfolio. It is also possible that reserves could be used for positive 
risk responses to enhance value. This is particularly true across a portfolio where component programs or projects 
may be changed or initiated to exploit positive risks. So, reserves are usually seen as a threat response endeavor. 
However, the use of reserves could support both threat and opportunity responses across the portfolio.
8.2.2 BalanCIng rISK
Risk appetite of the key portfolio stakeholders in terms of the balance between opportunities and threats is a factor 
that needs to be taken into account when managing portfolio risk. The balancing of risks is challenging because of 
the complex nature of portfolios and the inherent characteristic of uncertainty associated with risk. Also, the portfolio 
manager should take a proactive approach in responding to risks to ensure that the potential negative impacts 
of threats remain acceptable with respect to the benefits expected from pursuing the opportunities. On the threat 
side, organizations will try to prevent losses through risk-mitigation actions, while on the opportunity side, actions 
to enhance outcomes will be taken to maximize one or more benefits, such as return on investment or profitability. 
Further, because portfolios are complex, there is often no single optimal solution.
The tradeoffs between threats and opportunities, short- and long-term impacts, and environmental considerations 
(including the market and available technologies) have a fundamental impact on the selection or termination of 
portfolio components. The interrelationships of these factors drive the complexity of portfolio risk management. 
Balancing dependencies and priorities among portfolio components is often conflicting and underlines the subjective 
perception of risk. In addition, the absence of a deterministic environment makes the decision-making process more 
difficult because of uncertainties that limit effective response strategies.
In most cases, the portfolio manager is faced with several suboptimal solutions where all solutions have various 
strengths and weaknesses, but there is no clear path to an optimized management approach. To simply assume that 
the risk exposure of a portfolio is the sum of its constituent parts misses the interrelationships among the portfolio’s 
component parts and the external influences that are prevalent at the portfolio level of management.
Because of the complexity associated with risk management at the portfolio level, communications and stakeholder 
engagement is a primary concern of the portfolio management team. A robust communications effort with senior 
management up the chain, program and project management down the chain, and the portfolio management and 
operations staff (if contained within the portfolio) allows a common vision toward shared goals. This provides a 
framework to link the portfolio risk management effort to subordinate risk management efforts within the elements 
of the portfolio.

89
8.3 PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT
Managing risks at all levels is an active process involving continuous planning, analysis, response, and monitoring 
and control. The execution of response strategies should be anticipatory and implemented by trigger events that 
launch response actions before the risk materializes so that opportunities (positive risks) may be enhanced or 
threats (negative risks) may be diminished. Even within an active process of continuous risk identification, risk 
management at the program, project, and operations areas are traditionally approached from a prescriptive, process-
based perspective. However, within complex systems such as portfolios, risks may not be managed in the traditional 
or simple sense. Complexity requires a less prescriptive approach. In many cases, the execution of risk response 
strategies at the portfolio level involves the establishment of projects within the portfolio’s component programs or 
as part of continuing operations to address specific opportunities or threats (positive or negative risks) that have 
either materialized or have had a significant increase in the probability of occurrence as indicated by a trigger 
event occurring. There is an important distinction between portfolio risk management and risk management at the 
program or project level. In many cases, the portfolio manager should delegate risk response measures to subordinate 
programs or projects within the portfolio. A desired outcome from portfolio risk management is to utilize a structured 
risk planning and response effort in order to reduce management inaction and decision delay. Risk identification 
analysis and response planning acknowledge the limits of data and the lack of clear, unambiguous, and actionable 
information concerning many management factors at the portfolio level. Various possible risk scenarios are studied 
and response plans developed to limit the impact of the data and information disconnect described above. Through 
portfolio risk management, senior leadership and portfolio management staff are provided with courses of action or 
management options that assist in making decisions involving risk with incomplete information.
8.4 KEY PLANNING ELEMENTS
At the portfolio level, all risk elements should be addressed. Risks not addressed at the portfolio level could be 
addressed through governance processes at the strategic level. In the final analysis, if a risk becomes an issue, that 
issue may be handled through the organization’s portfolio, program, and project structure, and not at the strategic 
governance level.
8.4.1 PorTFolIo rISK ManagEMEnT FraMEWorK
There are four key elements in Portfolio Risk Management: risk management planning, risk identification, risk 
analysis, and risk response. These elements are shown in Figure 8-1. The double arrows represent feedback loops 
between various planning information views, such as the portfolio risk management plan and the functions that support 
the creation of these data views. Within a data-centric information structure, reports and plans are presented in certain 
formats. With regard to risk management, these views or formats take the form of the portfolio risk management plan, 
risk response plans, portfolio confidence level or percent confidence, risk register, subordinate risk management 
and response plans, and other risk-related data elements of concern at the portfolio level. Risk response planning, 
monitoring, and controlling requires a structure to provide portfolio managers with a flexible risk management and 
response capability. A data-centric approach to reporting and documenting promotes a self-updating structure.

Figure 8-1 is a notional picture of various elements of Portfolio Risk Management. Risk identification, assessment, 
and response elements are pictured within the element of manage portfolio risks to show how the risk identification 
and assessment elements inform a specific risk response. For consistency between portfolio, program, and project 
risk elements, the term manage portfolio risk is used as a portfolio risk element. At the portfolio level, risks are 
usually not “controlled”—they are managed within a comprehensive risk strategy. The risk environment shown at the 
portfolio level is dynamic, complex, and nonlinear in nature, as indicated by the multiple double arrows in the figure.
Risks that were identified during portfolio risk planning may arise from either external or internal sources (enterprise 
environmental risks) and may be identified by anyone in the organization, including executive management, operations 
management, the portfolio manager, program or project management teams, and stakeholders. Each executive 
(portfolio, program, project, and operations) has a different perspective of the portfolio’s risk, and senior executives’ 
influences can differ. For example, for senior executives, risk concerns generally involve portfolio value, time to 
market, and funding and investment measures. These may include customer brand and organization reputation, 
organizational operating model, impact on organizational strategy and objectives, and existing products and services 
that will be impacted by the portfolio. Senior executives often focus on safeguarding the shareholders’ investments, 
company assets, detecting and preventing fraud, and identifying and managing liabilities.
At the portfolio level, both structural and execution risks are driven predominantly by individuals. That is not to say, 
for example, that external factors such as environmental issues, organizational policies, contextual changes, cross-
component technical dependencies or interfaces, and aggregation or escalation of technical risks across multiple 
components do not impact risks at the portfolio level. However, these factors play less of a role at the portfolio level 
than at the program or project levels in directly driving risks.
Linking both structural and execution considerations from the perspective of change is described as dynamic 
capacity, or the potential of an organization to adapt. Organizational adaptation or management agility is driven not by 
process or technical considerations, but by the individual manager and subordinates working within the organization. 
Risk associated with dynamic capacity is people centric. An organization’s attitude to risk and its risk appetite is based 
on the individual risk attitudes of those who work within the management structure.
The individual positive or negative effect of any single risk, if materialized, may impact not only the portfolio of 
programs and projects, but also the existing services, products, forecasted results, and benefits that the programs 
and projects generate because one risk affects other risks. As impacts propagate through the organization, they 
result in changes affecting the organization’s stakeholders, its reputation, and its position in the market. However, 
what happens to an individual component or constituent part of a portfolio is secondary given that threats that occur 
should be compensated for by opportunities in other areas. What’s important is the overall value delivered as a result 
of risk diversification in the portfolio mix. If the resultant effect is aligned with the organization’s vision, strategy, and 
business model, then the portfolio may be considered productive irrespective of the final status of some individual 
portfolio components.
8.4.2 rISK PErCEPTIon
It is important for organizations to establish a common understanding of risk and be prepared for the likelihood and 
impact of known threats or opportunities. The risk appetite statement should be based on a review of the perspectives 
and concerns of all stakeholders and should address the implications of current organizational strategies and 
practices. This enables the organization to develop risk appetite statements and set internal risk appetite limits. Risk 
appetite is defined by risk thresholds, which become a measurable metric for the otherwise subjective risk appetite 

92 
The Standard for Portfolio Management – Fourth Edition
statement. Organizations should also define risk tolerance bands in each risk area before acting. These define levels 
of acceptable risk variation around defined strategic objectives. It is important for an organization to establish clear 
and agreed risk appetite statements in order to guide risk-based decision making and to set the scope for overall 
risk management activities. Risk data, including reports and formal documents, are maintained and updated by the 
portfolio manager to maintain alignment with organizational strategy and other direction. Most risk management at the 
portfolio level involves the setting of the organization’s risk culture as defined by the risk appetite of senior executives 
and subordinate managers. Traditional risk response planning, monitoring, and response is usually performed within 
the portfolio components through the execution of some program or project or as an ongoing operation within the 
portfolio.
However, risk perception and management decisions on risk are based on the individuals’ risk attitudes and 
appetite as well as the collective risk appetite of the organization. Portfolio management risks may be identified by 
anyone in an organization, including executive management, operations management, the portfolio manager, and 
program management and project teams. Each organizational level has a different perspective of the portfolio’s 
risk. Organizational levels include the executive management, operations management, portfolio manager, 
program component, and project and small team levels. At all levels, both positive (opportunities) and negative 
(threats) risks are factors. Perception is, by nature, hard to quantify and is based on many factors dealing with 
an individual’s psychological approach to risk. Because of the underlying human psychological nature of risk 
perception, risk response at the portfolio level has a level of complexity and uncertainty that is generally greater 
than what is found at the program or project level, where the focus is on benefit and product or service delivery, 
respectively.
As uncertainty grows, risk attitude perception becomes more important. Uncertainty arises from imperfect or 
incomplete information. Uncertainty is greatest at the portfolio level because of the impact of uncontrolled variables 
on the portfolio. Projects and, to a lesser extent, programs may be shielded from some uncontrolled variables. As a 
result, senior managers and the portfolio management team work in an environment that is more uncertain than 
that of program and project managers. Faced with growing uncertainty, senior and portfolio managers rely on their 
perceptions to fill in imperfect or incomplete information. Therefore, risk appetite and risk attitude become crucial to 
the risk management effort.
Value delivery at the portfolio level is also driven by perceptions. The meeting of measurable objectives by a 
portfolio’s programs, projects, or operations does not completely define the value delivery equation for the portfolio. 
Simply stated, the sum of benefits among the component elements of the portfolio or the delivery of specific capabilities 
via projects or ongoing operations does not fully define the delivered value of the portfolio. The perception of value is 
always cast within a risk-reward context. The overriding perception is that for greater risk, the rewards and the value 
achieved by the portfolio should be greater.
Because of the importance of individuals’ risk perceptions in shaping the benefits to value equation, analysis 
of the individual stakeholders’ risk appetite is key to managing risk at the portfolio level. As stated previously, risk 
management at the portfolio level is a balancing of opportunities and threats (positive and negative risks) to maximize 
the probability that the portfolio will meet its strategic goals and objectives within the organization’s vision. The value 
of the portfolio is determined by measuring the success of meeting or exceeding these strategic goals and objectives 
against the backdrop of risks taken to gain desired results.
Individuals make up the organization, and it is through the combination of individual risk perceptions and risk 
appetite that an organizational risk attitude or risk culture is formed. This does not imply that the formation of an 

93
organizational risk attitude is simply the sum of all the attitudes of the organization’s employees and managers. The 
process of forming an organizational attitude is complex, and sometimes best communicated in terms of percent 
confidence in achieving the requisite goals and objectives. The attitude of the organization toward the positive or 
negative effects of risks on the organization’s portfolio is called the organization’s risk appetite. A risk-tolerant 
organization is willing to take more risks, such as moving more quickly into new markets, expanding products more 
quickly, or investing more heavily in new product development. A risk-averse organization is less likely to move 
quickly. Organizational risk appetite affects or influences individual risk attitudes. Individuals who are less risk averse 
may tend not to take on more risk, whereas those individuals who are less conservative may take on some risk. 
Organizational risk appetite also affects the adaptability or agility of the organization. Change contains risk, and those 
organizations that are risk averse will be less likely to adapt and respond quickly to change. This affects the portfolio 
risk management approach and, specifically, the portfolio risk management framework.
8.5 PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK ANd PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT 
PLAN
Planning is key to successful portfolio management, just as it is to successful program and project management. 
The portfolio risk management plan should fit into the overall portfolio risk management framework. The portfolio 
risk management plan describes how risks will be managed within the portfolio. The portfolio risk management 
plan does not contain risk analysis, but it provides the structure for risk-related data management. These data make 
up the risk analysis, and the portfolio risk management plan describes how the data are used by senior managers 
and portfolio managers. A data-centric approach to planning allows continuous reviewing, updating, and responding 
(when required) to risk trigger events.
8.5.1 PorTFolIo rISK ManagEMEnT FraMEWorK
The portfolio risk management framework or architecture supports the overarching principles of risk management 
and provides the vision for risk management within the portfolio. The portfolio risk management framework is an 
outline that links organizational risk management processes within the portfolio. Additionally, the portfolio risk 
management framework links program, project, and operational risk management to the portfolio risk management 
structure, thus providing a link between the risk concerns that transcend the portfolio and the component risk concerns 
contained within the portfolio. A common set of risk-related definitions and the establishment of risk categories or a 
risk breakdown structure should be provided by the portfolio management team as part of developing the portfolio 
risk management framework. From a data-centric perspective, the portfolio risk management framework defines the 
overarching risk environment in which portfolio risk processes operate.
Differences are expected between the portfolio, program, project, and operations risk management areas. At the 
program or project level or when dealing with operations, the focus is on management of negative risks (threats) 
through avoidance, transfer, or mitigation, as well as managing positive risks (opportunities) through exploitation, 
sharing, or enhancement. At the portfolio level, the focus should be on balancing positive and negative risks to support 
the organizational vision, strategic goals, and objectives of the organization, thus realizing value to the organization. At 
the portfolio level, risk acceptance may be a more common strategy because many risks are outside of the planning 
ability or control of the organization.

94 
The Standard for Portfolio Management – Fourth Edition
On the positive side of risk, organizations may exploit, enhance, or share a positive risk. When dealing with an 
increased product demand, for example, the risk response actions would usually be part of a planned portfolio strategy 
or marketing effort.
Complex projects may require balancing risks and risk strategies that go beyond simple risk response strategies. 
The key lies in what the organization should focus on. In general, portfolio managers focus on risk balancing beyond 
what is usually done at the program and project levels; this is due to the wider scope of portfolio management, added 
complexity at senior levels of management, decreased control, and a generally broader vision across the management 
structure.
Risk-based decision making facilitates the separation of various risks into risk categories. Risk categories provide a 
structure that ensures a comprehensive process for systematically identifying risks to a consistent level of detail and 
that contributes to the effectiveness and quality of risk identification. An organization can use a previously prepared 
categorization framework that may take the form of a simple list of categories. Some categories of risks are shown 
in Figure 8-2. An alternative method of risk categorization may be a risk breakdown structure. Categories may be 
organized by the phase of the effort, the source of the risk, or any other organizational structure that makes sense 
to management. Additionally, a risk breakdown structure may result in a more granular listing of risk categories. The 
approach chosen depends on the risk appetite of the organization and its senior management team in addition to the 
overall granularity of the management approach taken.
Sample Risk Categories
Portfolio component risk
Organizational risk
Performance risk
Resource risk
Financial/budget risk
Market risk
Regulatory risk
Data/information quality
Stakeholder risk
Procurement risk
Supply chain risk
Image and public relations risk
Environmental risk
Natural factors risk

8.5.2 PorTFolIo rISK ManagEMEnT Plan
The portfolio risk management plan is a component of the portfolio management plan. It describes how risk 
management activities will be structured and performed within the portfolio. It also includes references to risk 
management guidelines, policies, and procedures that define the organization’s risk strategy and appetite, which 
includes thresholds and confidence limits. The portfolio risk management plan provides the approach that is used by 
governing bodies for assessing risk in portfolio components. The portfolio risk management plan is not a collection of 
portfolio component risk management plans or a summary of those plans, although there should be common elements 
between the risk management approach within the portfolio components and the overall portfolio management plan. 
For example, when the culture of the organization is one of risk taking, then the portfolio risk approach should be more 
tolerant of risks, and the embracing of risks should be a common theme throughout the components of the portfolio.
Programs, projects, and operations within the portfolio may have different approaches to risk management, and 
individual program, project, and operations managers will have differences in their risk appetites and their attitudes 
toward risk. These differences should not prevent the concept of a common theme for risk management across 
the portfolio and should not be restrictive on individual component planning. The portfolio risk management plan 
includes references to risk management guidelines, policies, and procedures that define the organization’s risk 
strategy, and presents the organization’s risk appetite and risk tolerance thresholds. Within various approaches to risk 
management as explained by the previously mentioned management guidelines (see Section 8.2.1), there should be 
commonality regarding how risk management is seen and how risk is monitored and controlled. For example, within 
the nuclear power industry, each organization implements risk management practices differently depending on the 
local regulations and the organization’s processes. However, the overall theme of risk management within the industry 
is one of zero tolerance of threats associated with nuclear material.
The portfolio risk management plan extends the vision articulated within the portfolio risk management framework. 
The portfolio risk management plan outlines the processes by which risk will be managed at the portfolio level. 
However, the portfolio risk management plan should not be prescriptive down to the project level or define how 
operations will be managed with respect to risk within the portfolio. Managers working within portfolio components 
should align risk plans to the portfolio risk management framework, and the individual component risk management 
plans should support the portfolio risk management plan. While management concerns within portfolio components 
often differ from concerns at the portfolio level (i.e., time, impact, span of effect, or complexity), the risk management 
plan of each component is not a mere subset of the portfolio risk management plan for an entire portfolio.

FOuRTH EdITION CHANGES
This appendix provides a detailed explanation of the changes made to The Standard for Portfolio Management—
Fourth Edition to help readers understand the differences between editions, the rationale for the standard, and to 
provide historical continuity.
The project committee was chartered to update and enhance The Standard for Portfolio Management—Third 
Edition, but with the challenge of developing a principle-based document. This was a paradigm shift away from a 
process-based standard as previously published. The following sources and criteria were used to determine requisite 
changes to the standard:
u
u Recommendations deferred from The Standard for Portfolio Management—Third Edition;
u
u Results of a portfolio management market research study that validated proposed changes to The Standard for 
Portfolio Management—Third Edition;
u
u Harmonization of key sections and concepts with the other PMI foundational standards;
u
u Recommendations from subject matter expert review;
u
u Alignment with the PMI Lexicon of Project Management Terms;
u
u Recommendations from public standards program working sessions;
u
u Recommendations from public exposure draft comments; and
u
u Alignment with ISO 21504:2015 on Project, Programme and Portfolio Management—Guidance on Portfolio 
Management.1
The ISO/TC258 working group that developed ISO 21504 was provided with a copy of The Standard for 
Portfolio Management—Third Edition as a reference for its development of ISO 21504. Further, ISO 21504 
was one of the references used by the standards core committee in developing the update to The Standard for 
Portfolio Management. The concepts in The Standard for Portfolio Management— Fourth Edition complement 
and harmonize with ISO 21504. The Standard for Portfolio Management elaborates the applicable principles of 
ISO 21504 and key concepts, such as alignment to the organization’s strategic plan, implementation of capacity 
and capability management, use of portfolio governance, the need for active stakeholder engagement, a focus 
on value management, and the overall portfolio life cycle.

CONSIdERING THE PORTFOLIO  
AS A COMPLEX SYSTEM
X3.1 A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO PORTFOLIOS ANd THEIR MANAGEMENT
Portfolio management practitioners work in a complex environment with overlapping and often conflicting interests. 
Under such conditions, practitioners are often challenged by too much nonfiltered information and not enough relevant 
communication. To comprehend such an environment and be in a position to anticipate behavior, it is necessary to 
study the portfolio system as a whole. This involves the application of a systems thinking approach in parallel to the 
prevailing linear thinking. This simply means, further to examining and understanding portfolio components individually, 
also analyze the whole portfolio and focus on the effects of the interactions between the portfolio components. 
This parallel approach may prove very beneficial to the portfolio manager, particularly when dealing with human-
made systems, and especially those involving many human beings. Very often, portfolio components are the transient 
vehicles that deliver change for the whole organization. A systems perspective allows for better understanding of the 
goals of the change initiatives and of the vehicles delivering these goals, the components of the portfolio, as well as 
better understanding of the functioning of the portfolio system within the whole organizational system.
Under a systems approach, the following factors are applicable:
u
u Portfolio component connectivity and dependence. There will always be interactions between the portfolio 
components, creating reinforcing and balancing loops. The properties, capabilities, and behavior of the portfolio 
system are derived from its components, from interactions between those components, and from interactions 
with other systems.
u
u Holism. A portfolio system should be considered as a single entity, a whole, not just a set of components.
u
u Historicity and time. The past influences the present.
u
u boundaries. The boundaries of the entire portfolio system may be chosen and defined at a level suitable for 
the particular purpose under consideration. Boundaries are created for management purposes; in reality, the 
portfolio is an open system always interacting with its environment.
u
u Change. Change is a continuous process; emergence is inevitable.
u
u Cause-and-effect relationships. Nonproportionality in cause-and-effect relationships may often occur within 
the portfolio; cause and effect may not be closely linked in time.

112 
The Standard for Portfolio Management – Fourth Edition
u
u disorder. If the disorder in the portfolio system is high, portfolio component self-adjustment to environmental 
conditions may occur. It is important to note that the self-adjustment process may not be efficient; usually 
unmanaged equilibrium positions are not the best choice.
u
u Flexibility/adaptability. Face uncertainty, embrace and manage change, and embrace team learning.
A portfolio is a system of interconnected components interacting with each other and their environment. Each 
component, when changed, affects other components or subcomponents of the portfolio to which the component is 
connected. A portfolio managed in a complex environment usually exhibits behaviors that closely resemble those of 
a complex system of systems constantly interacting with its environment—not just those of a simple system (which 
is fully explainable in terms of its components). In order to build resilience and system stability, dependencies and 
their effects as well as the interfaces between portfolio components and between portfolio components and their 
environment, need to be better understood by portfolio management practitioners.
Mastery of the dynamics of the whole organizational system plus knowledge about stakeholder requirements, 
resource capacity management, change management capability, benefits realization process maturity, component 
dependency management, etc., are essential for the portfolio manager. The portfolio manager should be aware of 
and recognize dependencies as well as causes and effects that interconnections between portfolio components 
(e.g., portfolio stakeholders, the portfolio environment, etc.) introduce at any point in time. Such awareness allows the 
practitioner to introduce contingencies for emergent issues and risks arising from the aforementioned dependencies 
that introduce complexity.
The navigation of complexity focuses attention on those aspects of organizational life that trouble portfolio 
managers—mostly disorder, irregularity, and randomness. Navigating complexity means achieving portfolio objectives 
while accepting instability, change, and unpredictability throughout the portfolio life cycle. Navigating complexity of 
the portfolio helps to avoid stabilizing the crisis without eliminating its causes1. Navigating complexity and portfolio 
management have a strong bilateral relationship. The establishment and implementation of portfolio management in 
an organization reduces and harnesses complexity considerably.
Within the portfolio external environment, complexity affects primarily strategic planning, portfolio sponsorship, 
and portfolio governance. For strategic planning, practitioners need to consider the following factors as complexity 
drivers:
u
u Duration of portfolio components,
u
u Dynamics of portfolio ecosystem,
u
u Effects of many small changes that may transform the portfolio and its environment, and
u
u Changes associated with competitive situations among key stakeholders.
1 It is better not to use the term “root cause” instead of “cause.” Within a complex environment, usually there is not 
a single cause that impacts the portfolio. Multiple causes impact the portfolio system through various dependencies 
and should be dealt with from a holistic perspective.

113
For portfolio sponsorship and portfolio governance, the following considerations are important:
u
u As complexity increases, the lack of predictability increases. Thus, as complexity increases portfolio governance 
should adapt toward exhibiting anticipatory, change-oriented behavior and situational response (or swift 
decision making). Governance should also endorse proactivity so that the portfolio system does not jump into 
a nonanticipative state. It is the responsibility of the portfolio manager to ensure that the processes used to 
accumulate the status of all components and convey the status of the whole portfolio-to-portfolio governance 
and executive management should be well documented, tested, and validated.
u
u Long-term planning has its limits. That is why seasoned portfolio managers look for patterns in the whole 
and seek small changes in strategic objectives that can have the largest possible impact on unfavorable 
patterns. Such an approach enhances the development of flexible and adaptable alternative plans. Portfolios 
represent what the organization will be in the future. Portfolios co-evolve with changes in strategy and strategic 
objectives. Analyzing and planning the portfolio roadmap, along with deviations to be enacted when necessary, 
proactive behavior, resilience, but also flexibility and adaptability under certain circumstances, are essential. If 
executive management cannot see their strategy continuously reflected in the portfolio management process, 
they will not champion portfolio management even though, by not adopting such management techniques, 
they will have little chance of eventually achieving that strategy.
u
u A complex, adaptive system approach applied in parallel and enhancing the technical portfolio management 
principles described in this standard have been proven to help portfolio governance to develop a birds-eye 
view of the whole portfolio management process. Management of complexity is concentrated on the portfolio’s 
main objectives, which are the most beneficial to the organization and which aid in a deeper understanding of 
program and project work throughout the organization. A complex, adaptive systems approach toward portfolio 
management has to accept that the long-term future is inherently unknowable, and strategically plan accordingly.
It is also important for executives and portfolio management practitioners to appreciate that successful portfolio 
management is a key driver toward navigating complexity of the whole organizational system. Executive management 
needs to support those efforts through communication, investment, dedicated resources, knowledge management, 
and talent management. It is paramount to consider the consequences of ill-navigated portfolio component 
interdependencies. This may lead to several undesirable effects for the portfolio, including the problems of resource 
waste, schedule slippage, budget waste, and intercomponent competition.
The proposed approach unites a holistic approach (i.e., a systems-thinking approach and recognition of complexity). 
It primarily helps the portfolio practitioner to be aware of what is done, what is not known, and how to investigate issues 
within a complex environment. The complexity of managing portfolio component interdependencies can significantly 
increase with an increasing number of portfolio components. Similarly, the higher the degree of interdependency 
between the portfolio components and its environment and the rate of change in that environment, the greater the 
complexity. Complexity awareness also helps balance the need for innovation with the organization’s risk appetite 
and set constraints.
One of the key benefits of a systems approach and portfolio complexity awareness is the ability to deal more 
effectively with change and to compensate for the ineffectiveness of immediately apparent solutions that don’t 
consider emergent issues and risks.

The Standard for Portfolio Management – Fourth Edition
In today’s environment of rapid change and constant disruption, highly mature portfolio 
management practices have proven to be a vital tool to organizational success.
Portfolio managers oversee a collection of projects, programs and other activities that are 
grouped together to meet strategic business objectives. The practice of portfolio management 
is integral to the implementation of your organization’s overall strategic plan. 
Now in its fourth edition, The Standard for Portfolio Management reflects current practices and 
has been updated to reflect the evolution of the profession.
It is a principle-based standard, making it applicable to a broad range of organizations, 
regardless of project delivery approach.
The Fourth Edition describes portfolio management and its relationship to organizational 
project management, organizational strategy and the organization in addition to its 
relationship to program and project management. 
Not only is The Standard for Portfolio Management – Fourth Edition invaluable for portfolio 
managers and aspiring portfolio managers, it’s an important reference for anyone who works 
with portfolios—from project and program managers to project stakeholders and senior 
managers.
