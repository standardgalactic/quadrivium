RELEASE NOTES
NDREA DICENZO is an experienced conflict zone photogra-
pher, but her assignment for “The Terror-Industrial Com-
plex” (page 60) posed a unique challenge: getting lethally 
close to live ISIS munitions. Embedding with arms inves-
tigators in northern Iraq, the Erbil-based photographer 
traveled deep into territory only 
recently wrested from the Islamic 
State, where the team found a make-
shift weapons factory filled with dozens of 
mortars, rockets, and bomblets. “They were 
absolutely terrifying,” DiCenzo says, “but 
it’s much better than having munitions 
hurled at you, which was the case when I 
was covering the Mosul offensive.” She let the 
more seasoned arms specialists handle the 
explosives before she photographed them.

In “You Are a Num-

Hvistendahl explores 
how a Chinese tech 
giant is monitoring 
people’s behavior 
and assigning a score 
that determines each 
person’s trustworthi-
ness. While in Shang-
hai, Hvistendahl 
became the acciden-
tal star of another 
project: “I went into 
one of these cashless 
convenience stores 
meant to encourage 
people to use mobile 
payments. There was 
a South Korean film 
crew there, and they 
ended up making me 
their subject.” She 
scanned her phone 
at a QR reader to get 
in, picked out a bottle 
of water, and flashed 
her phone again to 
check out. Then the 
film crew descended, 
asking her how it felt. 
“I mean, it was conve-
nient,” she says. “It’s 
probably the future.”

Writer Nathan Hill 
spent quite a bit of 
time playing World of 
Warcraft after finish-
ing grad school. But 
those hours didn’t 
go to waste: He 
used his expertise 
to shape his novel 
about gaming, The 
Nix, which is now 
being developed 
by JJ Abrams for 
television. For this 
issue, Hill turned his 
attention to the rise 
of esports leagues 
(page 74). The pro 
gamers he profiles 
make it look easy to 
play the first -person 
shooter Overwatch 
in a 450-seat arena, 
streamed to hun-
dreds of thousands 
of viewers. But when 
Hill played the game 
himself, he quickly 
discovered that even 
the casual compe-
tition was stiff. “I 
was shocked when I 
started playing other 
humans for the first 
time,” he says. “I 
died so quickly. And 
so incredibly often.”

gion,” he says. For 
Pontin, who was until 
recently editor in 
chief of MIT Technol-
ogy Review, improv-
ing quality of life is 
more plausible than 
living past 120. Most 
people in intensive 
care units are old and 
sick, he notes. “If we 
could cure the dis-
eases of old age, the 
great benefit would 
be a healthier, hap-
pier life while we’re 
here.” His essay on 
antiaging efforts is on 
page 13.

ARGUMENT
By Jason Pontin
I
IN EARLY 1954, POPE PIUS XII sum­
moned a venerable Swiss quack 
named Paul Niehans to the papal 
retreat at Castel Gandolfo. The 
pontiff was nauseated with gas­
tritis, fatigued by his 77 years, 
and loath to meet his maker. So he 
had Niehans administer an anti­
aging treatment called cell ther­
apy, which would become sought 
after by midcentury celebrities, 
artists, and politicians.  
Fetal cells were taken from a 
pregnant sheep and injected into 
the scrawny pope. Over time, Pius 
received a series of shots. The 
Holy Patient felt rejuvenated; 
Niehans was appointed to the 
Pontifical Academy of Sciences 
in thanks. But if the treatments 
worked at all, it wasn’t for long: 
Pius died four years later. 
Niehans’ Clinique La Prairie is 
still in business, charging tens of 
thousands of dollars for its week­
long “revitalization program.”

Guarente to develop therapies 
that target aging, failed to create 
such a drug. Sirtris, founded by 
Sinclair, was equally unsuccess-
ful. And while restricting calories 
is the best way we know to extend 
lifespans in organisms from yeast 
to mice, attempts to create medi-
cines that harness the genes acti-
vated by caloric restriction have 
failed FDA approval. 
But there are still plenty of 
enticing leads. Sinclair offers 
up a list of polysyllabic possibil-
ities: “Super metformin, rapalogs, 
NAD boosters, mitochondrial 
activators, senolytics.” Self- 
experimenters are already play-
ing with this menu of molecules. 
Some aspiring immortalists have 
long taken resveratrol, a com-
pound found in red wine proven 
to activate sirtuins. Stem cell 
pioneer Robert Hariri swears by 
metformin, a diabetes drug that 
may extend the healthy lifespan of 
the general population. The most 
daring are rumored to use rapa-
mycin, a powerful drug that pre-
vents organ transplant rejection. 
Rapamycin inhibits a key meta-
bolic pathway called mTOR that 
caloric restriction shuts down, 
initiating a process where dys-
functional cellular components 
are degraded and recycled. No one 
old or sick should take rapamycin 
lightly, because it suppresses the 
immune system, but safer thera-
pies based on analogs of rapamy-
cin, or rapalogs, could be the first 
real antiaging medicines. 
Even if these ideas become 
commercial medicines, they 
won’t magically remove the lim-
its on the human lifespan. There 
is no master switch for aging. 
We amass damage as we live, 
and damage to our DNA leads 
to cell disease and senescence; 
the telomeres that cap our chro-
mosomes shorten and fray, plac-
ing a hard stop on the number of

ically sound approaches. Inves-
tor Peter Thiel is reportedly 
“really interested” in the blood 
of the young. Based on an old 
idea called parabiosis, the ther-
apy excited new enthusiasm after 
a 2013 paper showed that a pro-
tein richly abundant in young 
blood made old mice stronger. 
For $8,000, a company named 
Ambrosia will now infuse older 
patients with the blood serum 
of donors aged 16 to 25.
All over Silicon Valley and the 
regions that imitate it, execu-
tives follow weird revitalization 
fads. They think the code of aging 
can be hacked and death made 
optional. Daniel Gross, a partner 
at Y Combinator, fasts enthusias-
tically—and encourages others to 
do so—because he believes it will 
extend his life. Inventor Ray Kurz-
weil swallows 100 supplements a 
day for the same reason, presum-
ably so he’ll live long enough to 
be uploaded into the singularity, 
circa 2045. 
But you don’t have to be a 
prophet of posthumanism to 
wish for a few more good years. 
I’ve followed my own antiaging 
routines: For a time I ate 30 per-
cent fewer calories than recom-
mended, and I now starve myself 
for 16 of every 24 hours. And while 
there’s certainly plenty of folly in 
the tech elite’s quest for immor-
tality, I’m glad they’ve embarked 
on it—for reasons that go beyond 
sheer entertainment value.  
UNHAPPILY FOR MEÑand every-
one else—we’ve made little prog-
ress in extending the outer limit 
of the human lifespan. Yes, more 
people are living longer because 
we’ve gotten better at nutrition, 
curing acute conditions such as 
infections, and treating a hand-
ful of chronic diseases. But the 
maximum reported age at death 
has plateaued at around 115 years.
What’s tantalizing, however, 
are the breakthroughs in extend-
ing the healthy lifespan of other 
species. Two decades ago, UC 
San Francisco researcher Cyn-
thia Kenyon showed that a muta-
tion in a single gene can allow a 
roundworm to live twice as long. 
And at MIT, biologists Leonard 
Guarente and David Sinclair dis-
covered that a class of genes 
called sirtuins regulates longev-
ity in a wide range of organisms. 
Restricting the calories of yeast 
made them overexpress a partic-
ular sirtuin, extending their life-
spans; mice genetically altered to 
overproduce the mammalian ver-
sion lived longer and had fewer 
age-related diseases.
But for all those animal dis-
coveries, human aging is a prob-
lem that the biomedical industry 
and its regulatory agencies are 
ill-suited to solve. It’s not a dis-
ease recognized by the FDA, 
and testing drugs for human life 
extension would be costly and 
time- consuming. As Sinclair says, 
“The aging field is thriving sci-
entifically. But the translation of 
findings into treatments is poorly 
funded. Compared to heart dis-
ease and diabetes, the dollars 
allocated to aging are, at best, a 
hundred to one. But all it will take 
is one success to change the way 
people think.”
So far, the search for that first 
big success is stuck in the weeds.

times our cells divide. The mito­
chondria that produce energy in 
those cells flicker out. But these 
emerging therapies will treat the 
ravages of old age. They will help 
us stay healthier longer, even if 
we still die more or less when we 
do now. Gerontologists call this 
“compression of morbidity,” and 
it would be a wonderful humani­
tarian advance. In industrialized 
countries, old age would no longer 
mean a ghostly, semidemented, 
decades­long senescence. 
Kafka once said, “There is 
infinite hope. But not for us.” 
Death is not optional. But Silicon 
Valley immortalists are humani­
ty’s guinea pigs: They fund anti­
aging research, they experiment 
on themselves, and they’ll be 
the first consumers of approved 
treatments, regardless of price. 
And as the costs of successful 
therapies inevitably drop, their 
efforts will trickle down to the 
rest of us. Long live them all.  contests, later sing-
ers advanced more 
often, and those who 
went last had a 10 to 
15 percent greater 
chance of moving on. 
Research suggests 
that judges start out 
idealistic—evalu-
ating contestants 
against an imaginary 
goal—but then set-
tle into a less lofty 
baseline. One excep-
tion: election ballots. 
Voters tend to pick 
the first name on the 
list, whether they’re 
choosing city council-
lors or prom kings.
Resist the “uh oh” 
effect. Midpoints—of 
work projects, train-
ing regimens, and 
yeah, life—can either 
discourage (the “oh 
no” effect) or moti-
vate (“uh oh, time’s 
running out”). UCLA 
researchers studying 
teamwork found that 
the majority of groups 
did almost no work 
until halfway to the 
deadline then sud-
denly buckled down. 
Set interim goals and 
adopt the “chain” 
technique: Pick a task 
and mark a calendar 
with an X every day 
you do it—the string 
of X’s serves as an 
incentive.
Get it together. 
Whether it’s row-
ing, running, or flash 
 mobbing, synchro-
nized activities lower 
stress and provide 
mind-body benefits. 
Singing in groups 
has been found to 
improve self-esteem 
and  mitigate depres-
sion; in particular, 
choral singing can 
increase pain thresh-
olds and improve 
cancer patients’ 
immune responses. 
“It operates on a 
physiological level,” 
Pink says. “Their 
hearts even beat in 
sync.” Next time you 
hit the karaoke bar, 
relinquish that glory- 
hogging solo. 
Snag the first 
shift. Mood and 
energy levels follow 
 predictable circadian 
rhythms based on our 
genetically predis-
posed chronotype. 
The average person’s 
mood bottoms out 
approximately seven 
hours after waking, 
between 2 and 4 pm. 
That’s when the inci-
dence of on-the-job 
errors spikes—most 
notably at hospitals. 
“My daughter had her 
wisdom teeth taken 
out a few months 
ago,” Pink says. “I 
said, ‘You are getting 
the first appointment 
of the day.’ ” 
Brew before you 
snooze. The benefits 
of naps have been 
well- documented—10 
to 20 minutes of shut-
eye sharpens cog-
nitive ability without 
triggering a daze—
but a prenap coffee 
can enhance those 
benefits. The caffeine 
kicks in after about 
25 minutes for a post-
snooze brain boost. 
“Breaks need to be 
thought of as inte-
gral to the architec-
ture of a day’s work,” 
Pink says. Columbia 
University research-
ers found that judges 
doled out more 
lenient sentences 
after breaks, and a 
CDC study showed 
that kids with longer 
recesses earned bet-
ter grades.
Bring up the rear. If 
you’re competing in 
a large group, wait 
until the end to show-
case your skills. In an 
eight-country study 
of American Idol–like 
SCHEDULE SURGERIES, earnings calls, and therapy appoint­
ments before noon. Score the biggest bucks by switching 
jobs every three to five years. The ideal age to get hitched 
(and avoid divorce): 32. In his new book, When: The Scientific 
Secrets of Perfect Timing, Daniel Pink scours psychological, 
biological, and economic studies to explore what he calls the 
overlooked dimension. “Timing exerts an incredible effect 
on what we do and how we do it,” he says. Now that the sci­
ence of “when” is finally getting its due, Pink shares some 
temporal hacks to optimize your life. —Caitlin Harrington

Imagine you’re a black woman 
pitching a startup. You look dif-
ferent. You talk different. A table 
of white investors has never seen 
someone who looks like you and 
who’s been successful before. 
All these things are working 
against you. Do you let that stop 
you, or do you just say so what?
That’s what I train entrepre-
neurs of color to think about. 
When I first got to Silicon Val-
ley, I was just like them. My idea 
of pitching was basically Shark 
Tank. Then I met with Mitch and 
Freada, at Kapor Capital, and we 
sat around a table, just having a 
conversation. They invested in my 
ed-tech startup and eventually 
hired me to help founders make 
their companies more inclusive. 
I’ve navigated this world from 
multiple angles. I’ve had to adapt, 
to learn this group’s language.
People of color always have 
to adapt, to code-switch. That’s 
part of winning over investors. 
It’s a personal decision: How 
much do you compromise your 
culture, your norms, to play into 
their norms, their culture? Some 
will say it’s selling out. This will be 
a little controversial, but I say you 
can affect the situation. You can 
learn the rules, study how funding 
works, even just research inves-
tors’ likes and dislikes. That said, 
Much of this world isn’t a meri-
tocracy. It’s a mirror-tocracy—the 
people who make it tend to look 
like the people who’ve already 
made it. So a white man comes in 
to pitch his startup. He’s a drop-
out from Harvard. “Wow, look,” 
investors think. They see a smart 
kid building a company. They may 
not see that Jamal, a black man, 
came from a poverty-stricken 
environment. Do these VCs have 
any idea how many obstacles 
he’s had to overcome just to sit 
across from them? That should 
count. Distance traveled. Not just 
pedigree and where you went to 
school and what degrees you got. 
Distance traveled. —As told to 
Justice Namaste
it’s vital to not just put the burden 
on underrepresented founders. 
The system isn’t fair. Only some-
thing like 1 percent of VC-backed 
startups are led by black found-
ers. VCs must be challenged to 
change their rules.
Sure, some VC firms are diver-
sifying. Except then, guess what, 
many of these new hires leave. It’s 
not just about who you hire. It’s 
about who you invite over for Sun-
day brunch, who you follow on 
Twitter. Who follows you on Twit-
ter. How can you see the value of 
an idea pitched by an underrepre-
sented founder—an idea for their 
community—if you have no con-
text for their experience?

DESIGNS WITHIN 
ROBOTIC REACH
THE DROID-
OPTIMIZED HOME
ROBOTS CAN WALK, talk, run a hotel … and are entirely stumped by a 
doorknob. Or a mailbox. Or a dirty bathtub—zzzzt, dead. Sure, the 
SpotMini, a doglike domestic helper from Boston Dynamics, can 
climb stairs, but it struggles to reliably hand over a can of soda. That’s 
why some roboticists think the field needs to flip its perspective. 
“There are two approaches to building robots,” says Maya Cakmak, 
a researcher at the University of Washington. “Make the robot more 
humanlike to handle the environment, or design the environment to 
make it a better fit for the robot.” Cakmak pursues the latter, and to 
do that, she studies so-called universal design—the ways in which 
buildings and products are constructed for older people or those

1. Wide-Open 
Floor Plan
Any serious sans- 
human housekeep-
ing needs a wheeled 
robotic butler with 
arms, Cakmak says. 
That means fewer 
steps, plus hall-
ways wide enough 
for U-turns. Oh, and 
hardwood floors. 
Thick carpeting 
slows a bot’s roll.
 
2. Visual 
Waypoints
Factory robots 
work so fast in part 
because their world 
is highly structured—
conveyor belt here, 
truck over there. So 
for your robo-home, 
create landmarks 
that anchor the bots 
in space—a promi-
nent light fixture, 
say, that tells them, 
“You’re in the dining  
room.” (RFID tags 
will help bots locate 
smaller objects, like 
cleaning supplies.)
3. Right Angles
Imagine holding a 
ball between two 
textbooks. Because 
each surface touches 
the sphere at only 
a  single point, it’s 
easy to lose your 
grip. Robots have the 
same problem and 
do better holding flat, 
boxy surfaces. Swap 
out rounded dish-
ware for rectangu-
lar coffee mugs and 
square bowls. And 
use more plastic—
there will be drops.
 
4. Button-Free 
Zone
Machines struggle  
to “see” buttons—to 
say nothing of push-
ing them. They’re 
much happier inter-
facing digitally with 
Wi-Fi- enabled (and 
buttonless) coffee 
makers, stoves, and 
dishwashers.
5. Upsized 
Bathroom
Roomba-type bath-
room cleaners can’t 
navigate spaces 
behind toilets or the 
graduated curves 
around sinks and 
tubs. And that step 
at the entrance to 
the shower (already 
a hazard to older 
people) is a barrier. 
Flatten the room and 
boxify toilet and tub. 
 
6. Matte 
Materials
Depth- perception 
sensors in robots 
wig out in the face of 
shiny or transparent 
objects, meaning 
your stainless-steel 
refrigerator and glass 
tabletops may have 
to go. Lock away 
fancy stemware in a 
humans-only cabinet. 
 
7. Indoor Power 
Station
Just like architects 
design a nook for the 
refrigerator or stove, 
your robo-home 
will need space for 
a power-up station. 
Wireless recharging 
when the robot  
rolls up to the zone  
will make it more 
unobtrusive. Maybe 
right next to your 
Tesla Powerwall? 
8. Doors 2.0
Since robots hate 
turning spherical 
knobs, install flat han-
dles. Better yet, buy 
automatic doors that 
can be digitally trig-
gered by sensors in 
the bot—and do the 
same with dressers 
and anything else 
that opens. 
9. Trackable 
Humans
If you’d rather your 
dinner party not be 
interrupted, give bots 
permission to track 
your location via 
your phone or fitness 
wearable (“at table,” 
“by stove”). They’ll 
leave you alone 
through dessert.
 
10. Like by Like
With droids capable  
of feeding fresh 
clothes into a folding 
machine, there’s  
no need to moni-
tor wash cycles any-
more. Just locate  
the laundry room 
near your walk-in 
closet for maximum 
efficiency.
 
11. Gastrobotics
Bots won’t be cook-
ing too many meals 
from scratch (and you 
can’t be bothered), 
so get a smart fridge 
they can stock with 
meal kits and a smart 
oven they can control 
remotely. Mmm—bot-
made meals when-
ever you want. 
12. Raised Garden
Solar-powered 
horticultural bots 
need plenty of 
sunlight and like 
their plants arranged 
in easy-to-navigate 
rows and columns. 
Put your garden 
on the roof, with a 
nearby shed to store 
your autonomous 
lawnmower.

THE 
MARTIAN
FORTIFIED 
WITH A.I.
WHEN HUMANS ARE finally ready to relocate civilization to Mars, they won’t be able to 
do it alone. They’ll need trusted specialists with encyclopedic knowledge, composure 
under pressure, and extreme endurance—droids like Justin. Built by the German space 
agency DLR, such humanoid bots are being groomed to build the first martian habitat for 
humans. Engineers have been refining Justin’s physical abilities for a decade; the mech 
can handle tools, shoot and upload photos, catch flying objects, and navigate obstacles. 
Now, thanks to new AI upgrades, Justin can think for itself. Unlike most robots, which 
have to be programmed in advance and given explicit instructions for nearly every 
movement, this bot can autonomously perform complex tasks—even those it hasn’t 
been programmed to do—on a planet’s surface while being supervised by astronauts in orbit. Object recogni-
tion software and computer vision let Justin survey its environment and undertake jobs such as cleaning and 
maintaining machinery, inspecting equipment, and carrying objects. In a recent test, Justin fixed a faulty solar 
panel in a Munich lab in minutes, directed via tablet by an astronaut aboard the International Space Station. 
One small chore for Justin, one giant leap for future humankind. —anna vlasits

THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION is one of the few non-
stellar things up there that we can see from down here 
without instruments. It’s a prefab home the size of a foot-
ball field, 462 tons and more than $100 billion worth of 
pressurized roomlike modules and gleaming solar arrays, 
orbiting 250 miles above the surface of the Earth. Its 
flight path is available online, and you can find out when 
it will make a nighttime pass over your backyard. Right 
on schedule, you’ll spot an unblinking white light that’s 
moving at 17,500 miles an hour. It will cross your field of 
view, on a line straight enough to have been drawn with a 
ruler, in only a few seconds. A few minutes more and the 
men and women inside that light will be over Greece. A 
few minutes more, Mongolia.
THE SINGLE BEST 
THING WE DID
WHY THE ISS MATTERS
ALPHA

There have been 53 expeditions to the ISS; 53 long-duration crews 
have called it home since Expedition 1 floated aboard in 2000. They’ve 
been mostly from America and Russia, the two principal and unlikely 
partners in one of the most expensive and challenging construction 
projects ever completed. (The ISS rose out of the ashes of two pre-
vious space stations: Russia’s Mir, last occupied in 1999 before it 
fell out of the sky in 2001, and Ronald Reagan’s proposed Freedom, 
which never got past the blueprints.) Its first few residents came and 
went largely without incident, conducting scientific experiments 
in everything from fluid dynamics to zero-G botany while study-
ing what month after weightless month can do to the human body.
In November 2002, Expedition 6 arrived on the station’s doorstep. 
They were two Americans, Ken Bowersox and Don Pettit, and a Rus-
sian, Nikolai Budarin. They were supposed to complete a four-month 
tour in orbit. Then the shuttle Columbia dissolved into a finger of 
smoke somewhere beneath them in February 2003. The remaining 
shuttles were grounded, and the men of Expedition 6 were asked to 
extend their stay. They were told that they might come home in a few 
months. They might come home in a year. Maybe longer.
Bowersox has three children. Living in space is dangerous and dirty—
so much can go wrong, and everything floats—but that time away is a 
different kind of hard for the families left behind. Bowersox’s children 
would bundle up time and again that winter and head 
outside to wait for him to appear in the sky. He would 
rocket over their heads. One of his children, his then 
5-year-old son, didn’t quite understand the nature 
of orbital velocity, and he would sprint down the 
street, chasing his dad, trying to keep him in sight.
In the end, Expedition 6 came home in a Russian 
Soyuz capsule, only a couple of months after their 
original return date. Their dramatic descent 
didn’t make many headlines, and, except for 
Scott Kelly’s recent year-long stint in space, 
none of the subsequent 47 expeditions have 
garnered much attention either. Few of us 
give a thought to the International Space 
Station, even though, when the future mea-
sures our collective contribution to human-
ity, the ISS will prove the single best thing 
we did. Less than a century after the Model T 
was state of the art, we manufactured a kind 
of galleon in space and have sent men and 
women from 10 countries to live in it, along 
with a host of short-term visitors, without 
recess or mutiny or fatality, for nearly 20 
years. By the time the ISS makes its fiery 
return to Earth, possibly in the late 2020s, 
it will have become a stepping stone to lunar 
colonies and the first human mission to Mars. 
It will have taught us so much about our abil-
ity to adapt to the most hostile of environ-
ments. The most beautiful too.
Tonight there are a half-dozen brave peo-
ple, including three Americans, wrapped up 
in sleeping bags strapped to the cluttered 
walls there, dreaming of their families and 
gravity and everything else they’re missing. 
They are heroes, but the chances are slim that 
you could recall any of their names. Maybe 
it will make you feel better to remember 
instead, if only for the time it takes for the 
station to cross your night sky, that while 
everything can seem so awful and cynical 
here at home, we are still capable of distant 
miracles. Right now the International Space 
Station is hurtling through space, and so 
is its crew, which means so are we, living in 
its constant light.  By Chris Jones

Bring on the Batteries
All those new EVs are going to need 
batteries. Tesla is projecting to 
produce 35 gigawatt-hours’ worth 
annually, but the world is going  
to need way more than that. Today, 
consumer electronics are the  
chief users of batteries, but cars are  
about to overtake them—by a lot.
But What 
Kind of Power 
Are We Using 
to Charge 
Those Cars?
All those batteries 
are going to need 
juice, and electric 
vehicles won’t do 
anything to combat 
climate change if the 
power comes from 
dirty sources. It gets a 
little weird here: The 
benefits of an electric 
car will depend on 
where it’s charged. 
It all comes down 
to the local energy 
production mix.

ALPHA
IF WE HOPE to put the brakes on 
climate change, we need more 
electric vehicles, and they’ve 
recently gotten an extra boost. 
To reduce the emissions of car-
bon dioxide that contribute to 
global warming, at least seven 
countries have announced or 
are considering plans to ban the 
sales of cars with internal com-
bustion engines in the next 10 to 
20 years. (The US has not signed 
on to such a ban on conventional 
cars.) Some spots, like Paris and 
certain US cities, are just as keen 
to phase out petrol-drinkers to 
improve local air quality. The 
idea is that those CO2-belching 
jalopies will be replaced by elec-
tric vehicles, which should get 
cheaper and better as demand 
grows. But the road to clean driv-
ing machines isn’t without a few 
potholes. — Jack Stewart

The Coal Penalty
Variations in local energy production means that sometimes EVs are 
dirtier than regular cars. For example, if you live in a state that generates 
electricity from coal (Kansas), your electric car probably won’t be much 
kinder to the environment than a car that gets more than 35 mpg. In India, 
your EV is about as clean as a conventional vehicle that gets 20 mpg.
Batteries Will 
Need Better 
Chemistry
Even if (poof!) we 
switch the entire 
global energy supply 
to renewables, we  
are going to have to 
mine a lot more 
lithium, cobalt, and 
other raw ingredients 
to create all those 
batteries—and do 
so sustainably and 
responsibly. For 
example, a lithium-
ion battery also relies 
on nickel and cobalt 
for the electrodes. 
And more than 60 
percent of the world’s 
cobalt originates 
in the Democratic 
Republic of the 
Congo, where human 
rights abuses are 
rampant. Researchers 
are working on new 
batteries that require 
fewer problematic 
ingredients, and the 
countries proposing 
bans will ideally 
follow through with 
commitments to 
renewable energy. 
After all, if we don’t 
make the system clean 
from top to bottom, 
global warming wins.

JARGON WATCH
Coined by US deputy attorney gen-
eral Rod Rosenstein, responsible 
encryption is a new name for an 
old argument: that public agencies 
fighting crime and terrorism must 
have access to our private com-
munications—for our own good. In 
2016, Apple defied a court order to 
unlock an iPhone used by a shooter 
in an attack in San Bernardino, Cal-
ifornia. Libertarians cheered, but 
it was a bad look for Apple. After 
that, tech giants began adopt-
ing end-to-end encryption even 
they can’t decode. (So don’t ask!) 
In November, the FBI reported it 
was unable to open the phone of 
Texas church shooter Devin Kel-
ley. ¦ Rosenstein’s rebranding  
effort is the latest sally in a seman-
tic battle between Washington and 
Silicon Valley. Techies say respon-
sible encryption is “doublespeak” 
that would give the feds a pow-
erful new surveillance tool—and 
create a “back door” in networks 
that hackers will exploit. Rosen-
stein says the companies’ moves to 
“go dark” are self-serving and cre-
ate a “law-free zone” where jihadis 
and child molesters can operate. 
One thing’s sure: The issue won’t  
be resolved with euphemisms.

THE DISTANCE BETWEEN prosthetic and real is shrinking. Thanks to advances

friendly algorithms have existed 
since the mid ’60s, when the talk-

vincing more gullible users of 
its humanity. But it wasn’t until 
Facebook allowed app develop-

with Messenger a half-century 
later, in 2016, that bots rose up 
on the order of tens of thousands. 
Now they don’t just want to plan

this new class of digital coun-

its restriction in time and space: 
the therapist’s hour, calls from a

read on the bedside table. These

whereabouts or state of mind.

Relate, the rela-
tionship enhancer. 
I despise cleaning 
showers. Damp, moldy, full of 
tiny hairs. But I woke up early 
one morning and started attack-
ing the filth because Relate told 
me to. The bot texts short chal-
lenges meant to bring people 
together—divide household labor 
more equitably, for one, but also 
lovelier things like “take your 
S.O. out for their favorite bev-
erage.” Turns out if I splurge on 
an old-fashioned at the cocktail 
bar, he’ll volunteer to clean the 
 bathroom himself.
 Woebot, the mood 
assessor. Woebot 
sends daily prompts 
(“How are you feeling?”) to log 
your mood and current activity. 
Ignore at your peril. (“I haven’t 
forgotten about you, Signe.”) At 
the end of the week, my responses 
confirmed that I’m happiest at the 
gym and that desk work is more 
productive than couch work. 
Sound obvious? Tell that to my 
daily routine, which now includes 
regular walks and heightened 
productivity after 3 pm.
GoalBot, the moti-
vator. Pick up to 
three monthly goals, 
and once a week GoalBot will 
politely ask if you’ve made any 
progress. Like most, I’m moti-
vated by a combination of fear 
and self-loathing. So, confession: 
I accomplished diddly-squat with 
this thing. “You’re only human, 
so this time it’s OK”? No, it’s 
not OK, Goalbot. I need to be 
reminded of my failures con-
stantly, preferably with a boss-
from-hell-style “Hey, what’s the 
status on this?” text every god-
damn morning.
Invisible Boyfriend, 
the bespoke beau. 
Even though Relate 
improved my relationship, I still 
desired the confidence boost of a 
digital love-object. Before long, I 
was sending heart-eyes emoji to 
“Ernesto Quigley.” He liked my 
writing! Then, a twist: Ernesto 
wasn’t a bot. He was a real person. 
I hadn’t read the fine print. But my 
mistake made me reflect on the 
actual bots. Like Ernesto, they were 
engaging, available at weird times, 
and often flawed—almost human.

“Buy energy and you’re buying from your 
community,” LO3 founder Lawrence Or sini 
tells me. His chipsets can also connect to 
smart appliances, so you could save money 
by letting his system cycle down your devices 
when the network is low on power. The com-
pany uses internet logic—smart devices that 
talk to each other over a dumb network—
to optimize power consumption on the fly, 
making local clean energy ever more viable.
But wait, doesn’t blockchain number-
crunching use so much electricity it gener-
ates wasteful heat? It does. So Orsini invented 
DareHenry, a rack crammed with six GPUs; 
while it processes math, phase- changing 
goo absorbs the outbound heat and uses it 
to warm a house. Blockchain cogeneration, 
people! DareHenry is 4 feet of gorgeous, 
Victorian esque steampunk aluminum—so 
lovely you’d want one to show off to guests.
Solar and blockchain are only the tip of 
clean tech. Within a few years, we’ll likely 
see the first home fuel-cell systems, which 
convert natural gas to electricity. Such sys-
tems are “about 80 percent efficient,” mar-
vels Garry Golden, a futurist who has studied 
clean energy. (He’s also on LO3’s grid, with 
the rest of his block.)
The point is, clean energy has a utopian 
spirit that reminds me of the early days of 
personal computers. The pioneers of the 
1970s were crazy hackers, hell-bent on mak-
ing machines cheap enough for the masses. 
Everyone thought they were nuts, or small 
potatoes—yet they revolutionized commu-
nication. When I look at Orsini’s  blockchain- 
based energy-trading routers, I see the Altair. 
And there are oodles more inventors like him.
Mind you, early Silicon Valley had some-
thing crucial that clean energy now does 
not: massive federal government support. 
The military bought tons of microchips, 
helping to scale up computing. Trump’s 
band of climate deniers aren’t likely to be 
buyers of first resort for clean energy, but 
states can do a lot. California already has, 
for instance, by creating quotas for renew-
ables. So even if you can’t afford this stuff 
yourself, you should pressure state and local 
officials to ramp up their solar energy use. It’ll 
give us all a boost of much-needed cheer.  Write to clive@clivethompson.net.
POSITIVE ENERGY
THE SUNNY OPTIMISM 
OF CLEAN TECH
THE MOOD AROUND TECH is dark these days. Social networks are a 
cesspool of harassment and lies. On-demand firms are producing a 
bleak economy of gig labor. AI learns to be racist. Is there anyplace 
where the tech news is radiant with old-fashioned optimism? Where 
good cheer abounds? ¶ Why, yes, there is: clean energy. It is, in effect, 
the new Silicon Valley—filled with giddy, breathtaking ingenuity and 
flat-out good news. ¶ This might seem surprising given the climate-
change denialism in Washington. But consider, first, residential solar 
energy. The price of panels has plummeted in the past decade and 
is projected to drop another 30 percent by 2022. Why? Clever engi-
neering breakthroughs, like the use of diamond wire to slice silicon 
wafers into ever-skinnier slabs, producing higher yields with less 
raw material. ¶ Manufacturing costs are down. According to US gov-
ernment projections, the fastest-growing occupation of the next 10 
years will be solar voltaic installer. And you know who switched to 
solar power last year, because it was so cheap? The Kentucky Coal 
Museum. ¶ Tech may have served up Nazis in social media streams, 
but, hey, it’s also creating microgrids—a locavore equivalent for the 
solar set. One of these efforts is Brooklyn-based LO3 Energy, a com-
pany that makes a paperback-sized device and software that lets 
owners of solar-equipped homes sell energy to their neighbors—
verifying the transactions using the blockchain, to boot. LO3 is

HOW-TO
SNOW ANGLES
Get great results from your action cam as you capture 
your heroics ... and your epic bails. —BRENT ROSE
When to Slo-Mo
The GoPro Hero6 can 
shoot 1080p video 
at 240 frames per 
second—meaning 
that when you slow 
it down 10X, it looks 
amazing. But hitting 
the brakes doesn’t 
work for everything. 
Slo-mo is garbage for 
point-of-view angles. 
Save it for when 
you’re shooting video 
of your friends—place 
the camera at ground 
level to film a trick—
or when you’re (sigh) 
using a selfie stick.
When to Helmet 
Mount
The helmet mount is 
the easiest approach 
for most snowy activi-
ties. It captures things 
the way you see 
them, so you want a 
nice, fat frame: Shoot 
1080p at 60 fps in 
Wide mode, with sta-
bilization turned on. 
This makes a tree run 
look like the speeder 
bike chase on Endor 
from The Return of 
the Jedi.
When to  
Chest Mount
For all types of ski-
ing, go with a chest 
mount. It’s more sta-
ble than the head, 
and it puts your 
hands, poles, and 
skis into the frame. 
It’s also best for a 
snowmobile or snow-
bike, as it gets the 
handlebars into the 
shot. It’s rubbish for 
snowboarding. Shoot 
in SuperView mode 
for skiing, which fills 
the top and bottom  
of the frame.
When to Time-
Lapse
Action cams take 
great stills too. Set 
your camera to 
take one shot every 
half-second while 
it’s mounted on a 
selfie stick to make 
share-worthy GIFs 
or an extreme new 
Tinder profile pic. 
If you’re shooting a 
friend hitting a jump 
or doing a nasty turn, 
try Burst mode. Then 
select the most epic 
still from the dozen or 
so the camera grabs.
When to 4K
Reserve 4K shots 
for when you really 
want to reproduce 
the scene, like taking 
a panning shot of the 
stunning view from 
the mountaintop. The 
Hero6 now does 4K 
at 60 frames per sec-
ond, so it’s also fan-
tastic for shooting 
incredibly detailed 
action shots. Use it 
sparingly—it devours 
memory card space 
and battery life.
When to Selfie 
Stick
Your best option for 
getting primo footage 
when snowboarding 
solo. Use the same 
video settings as with 
the helmet mount, 
but if you’re going for 
a big trick, crank the 
frame rate to 120 to 
slurp up more detail. 
Try it with the camera 
both ahead of you 
and following you. 
For confident carvers 
only—wielding a sel-
fie stick on a fast run 
can be dangerous.
Advanced image stabili-
zation gets you smoother 
shots; simple software 
helps you share them.

HUMAN SHIELD
The waterproof material in your favorite jacket—and boots 
and ski pants—was born by accident. —JONATHON KEATS
BEFORE GORE-TEX was invented, 
there were plenty of materi-
als to protect you from harsh 
weather, but they all came with 
trade-offs. Waxed cotton was 
heavy. Vinyl could drown you 
in your own sweat. Seal intes-
tine (gut parka!) was favored by 
the Inuit but hardly made sense 
for mass production. That said, 
Bob Gore wasn’t attempting to 
improve outerwear when he 
created Gore-Tex. Working in 
his father’s Teflon factory in the 
late 1960s, he was simply trying 
to make more efficient use of the 
plastic by stretching it. He acci-
dentally found that yanking Tef-
lon filled it with air pockets. And 
not only that: The micropores 
that appeared in his “expanded 
polytetrafluoro ethylene” were 
700 times larger than a water 
vapor molecule but 20,000 times 
smaller than a droplet. Gore rea-
soned that if you made a fabric 
out of ePTFE, you could block out 
rain while still venting steamy 
perspiration—with wind protec-
tion as a bonus. The first Gore-Tex 
jacket was manufactured in 1977 
by a small Seattle company called 
Early Winters and marketed as 
“possibly the most versatile piece 
of clothing you’ll ever wear.” 
Since then, ePTFE has proven 
much more versatile than that 
and is now found in everything 
from space suits to heart patches. 
It’s certainly better suited to 
those modern applications than 
seal intestine ever could be.

Eye of the Storm 
Meet Eric Berger, 
leisure-time 
meteorologist, 
predictor of 
Harvey’s floods, 
unlikely hero.  
by CHris Jones
ON AUGUST 24 AT 8:20 
pm, a 44-year-old moonlighting 
meteorologist named Eric Berger 
was nearly finished writing a post 
for his Houston-centric blog, 
Space City Weather, titled “Har-
vey Late Night: Some Final Thurs-
day Thoughts.” He was in his 
home office. He had just poured 
himself a glass of cabernet.
He had been looking at the 
online forecasts from the 
National Hurricane Center and 
agreed with their essential con-
clusions: Harvey was a well- 
organized storm that would land 
with hurricane force on the Texas 
Gulf Coast somewhere between 
Corpus Christi and Port O’Con-
nor. Berger also backed the cen-
ter’s belief that the winds would 
be strong in Houston that week-
end, perhaps more than 40 miles 
per hour. But he was far more 
worried about the rain. The unan-
swered question is what happens 
to Harvey once it reaches the 
coast, Berger wrote. Where will 
it go, and will it go fast enough? 
Houston’s rainfall totals over the 
especially since he established 
his site in October 2015.
Berger does not generate his 
forecasts from scratch, point-
ing his licked finger into the 
wind and taking readings from 
the Galileo thermometer on his 
windowsill. He really does have 
a Galileo thermometer on his 
windowsill, but he works out 
of a home office that he hasn’t 
otherwise bothered to deco-
rate, with a basic PC and a sin-
gle monitor on which he toggles 
between tabs, from forecast to 
conflicting forecast. In Houston 
that evening, the US govern-
ment forecast called for about 
15 inches of rain. By then Berger 
had already begun to wonder. 
There is one model he has 
come to trust and rely on more 
than any other: the European 
Centre for Medium-Range 
Weather Forecasts’ Integrated 
Forecasting System, more pop-
ularly known in the US as the 
European model. Funded by 
22 EU members and 12 coop-
erating states, the European 
model is sometimes shockingly 
accurate, in part because it’s so 
well financed and its computing 
power is stronger than most. 
With Harvey, it suggested that 
the storm would stall over Hous-
ton, dumping 25 inches of rain 
or more before eventually mov-
ing on. That synced with Berg-
er’s own analysis of the weather 
patterns in the atmosphere. He 
detected a troublesome absence 
of steering currents, the forces 
that push hurricanes to wher-
ever they’re headed next, and 
without those currents, 
the European model’s 
next five days depend on this, and 
we just don’t know.
The considerable majority of 
modern weather forecasting is 
aided by computer algorithm. 
Most hurricane tracking relies 
on data crunched by various 
public and private computer 
models, and the models, which 
take different variables (tem-
perature, moisture, mass) and 
consider them in different ways, 
are not always in agreement. 
The National Hurricane Center 
takes input from several mod-
els to make its predictions, aver-
aging out their differences, in 
part because it faces the tallest 
order in hurricane forecasting: 
It must say that the hurricane 
will go here. So must television 
meteorologists, one of the cen-
ter’s principal conduits to a con-
cerned public. TV, too, demands 
a singular answer.
Berger doesn’t have to draw a 
line. He is a certified meteorol-
ogist, but the weather is just a 
particularly absorbing hobby 
of his; his primary paying gig 
is writing about aerospace for 
Ars Technica (a site owned by 
WIRED Media Group), and he 
blogs about the weather in his 
free time. That gives him two 
luxuries that most front-line 
meteorologist don’t have: He can 
value certain models and their 
ensembles much more heavily 
than others, untangling as many 
as 50 different versions of each 
forecast, and he can also admit 
doubt. He can explore the sub-
tlety of the weather, marveling 
at its mysteries, the way he has 
for his small but loyal commu-
nity of readers for years, but 
Eric Berger in Clear 
Lake Park, outside of 
Houston.

JAN 2018
forecast of a stall made a lot of 
sense. Given the sum of the evi-
dence before him, Berger felt 
confident in one fearsome predic-
tion, and he wrote as much: Big-
time floods are coming to Texas.
It was, at its essence, an 
informed gut call, and Berger 
thought carefully about what he 
would write next. He had made 
his reputation, such as it was 
for a leisure- time meteorolo-
gist with a city-specific weather 
blog, by refusing to submit to 
the hysterical frenzies that com-
petent weather observers dis-
miss as “storm porn.” He is by 
nature a fairly skeptical person. 
His twin passions, space and the 
weather, share long histories 
of broken promises and unmet 
expectations. His site’s motto is 
“Hype-free forecasts for greater 
Houston,” mindful of the cha-
otic and ultimately unnecessary 
evacuations prompted by Hurri-
cane Rita in 2005. I am not going 
to sugar-coat this, my friends, 
he had written in advance of 
that storm. As a Houston resi-
dent and property owner, I am 
truly mortified right now. Rita 
and Berger had both missed. 
But underplaying weather of 
dire consequences could lead 
to a different kind of calamity 
for his readers. James Spann, 
Alabama’s longtime weather 
forecaster of choice, had infa-
mously botched that state’s ice 
storms of January 2014. Spann 
had predicted a “dusting” of 
snow, and unworried commut-
ers headed out on the roads; 
when that dusting turned out 
to be a thick layer of ice, Spann 
shouldered much of the blame 
for the thousands of people who 
ended up stranded in their cars, 
schools, and workplaces over-
night. Berger despises alarmism 
in all its forms. He also didn’t 
want to bear responsibility for 
children drowning in their attics.
Berger’s wife, Amanda, was 
getting their own two daugh-
ters ready for bed in their 
League City apartment, tem-
porary accommodations while 
the family builds their dream 
home in nearby Clear Creek. His 
dog, Bonnie, a Maltese- poodle 
cross who dislikes all men but 
him, kept her usual vigilant 
watch. Berger can be painfully 
shy. Now he felt possessed by 
an unusual authority, exercised 
remotely through the digitally 
transmitted written word. He 
took another sip of his wine and 
returned to his keyboard.
Certainly the Corpus Christi 
area and points immediately 
north and west of there will get 
too much rain, he wrote. Flood-
ing will spread to other parts of 
Texas too, quite possibly Hous-
ton. But right now we can’t say 
that for certain. As I’ve said, it’s 
either going to be pretty bad, or 
really really bad here.
He posted his piece. His site 
normally averaged somewhere 
between 5,000 and 10,000 views 
a day. That particular entry 
received 207,334 over the next 
24 hours. A shocked Berger 
surmised that his core read-
ers were recommending him 
to their suddenly weather-con-
cerned friends. He had become 
the center of a kind of storm 
within the storm. 
In the comments, one reader 
asked what Berger thought the 
rainfall totals might be in San 
Antonio, 200 miles to the west. 
Someone else asked about Colo-
rado County, and another about 
the neighborhoods near Elling-
ton Field. Another reader won-
dered whether her husband’s 
flight out of Hobby Airport on 
Saturday morning might be 
delayed. A man named Petey 
James pointed out that Satur-
day night was the night of the 
big fight between Floyd May-
weather and Conor McGregor, 
and he wanted to know whether 
he should risk going to the local 
bar or pay to watch it at home. 
A woman named Deb Walters 
asked whether she should still 
have the party she had planned 
to host near Dacus on Saturday 
afternoon. I’d press ahead at this 
point, Berger wrote to her. Obvi-
ously if things turn ugly Saturday 
morning, you’ll have to cancel.
The following morning, Fri-
day, August 25, it started to rain, 
a few drops at first, and then 
a fairly steady shower. Har-
vey’s leading edge had come 
to town, and the models, con-
stantly updated, began to align: 
Harvey was nearly laser-precise 
in its construction and massive, 
and it was also a slow mover. The 
rain was going to be measured 
in feet, not inches. Berger sat 
down at his desk, no wine this 
time, and wrote another post.

FORECASTING
“A very serious flooding situa-
tion is coming,” he wrote.
He wrote it two more times 
for emphasis.
“A very serious flooding situ-
ation is coming.
A very serious flooding situ-
ation is coming.”
It was 3:15 pm. He hoped Deb 
Walters had canceled her party.
SINCE 1980, THERE 
have been more than 200 
weather and climate events 
in the United States that have 
each caused more than $1 bil-
lion in damage. Three principal 
national bodies are charged with 
predicting their arrivals and 
effects. The Storm Prediction 
Center in Norman, Oklahoma, 
keeps watch for tornadoes. 
The Weather Prediction Cen-
ter in College Park, Maryland, 
monitors heavy rains. And the 
National Hurricane Center in 
Miami minds hurricanes. They 
have been busy.
In the case of Harvey, all three 
were involved, funneling their 
best information to the Hous-
ton branch of the National 
Weather Service, one of its 122 
field offices across the coun-
try. Each helps turn national 
forecasts into finely tuned 
local ones. The Houston office 
is the only one that shares space 
with its home county’s Office of 
Emergency Management—Gal-
veston County in its case—bet-
ter to coordinate their shared 
response. It is no accident that 
their building sits atop a mound 
and that their offices are on 
the upper floor. Over the past 
few decades, greater Houston 
has grown exponentially from 
a mosquito- plagued oil port 
into the fifth-largest metro area 
in the United States, home to 
nearly 7 million people. That 
population explosion, combined 
with a certain regional antipa-
thy toward civic oversight, has 
seen former swamps turned 
into sprawling, unregulated 
developments. Houston has 
been built to flood.
Dan Reilly, 52, is the local 
Warning Coordination Mete-
orologist, part of the National 
Weather Service’s round-the-
clock professional staff. In a 
catastrophe-prone city like 
his, the job is twofold. The first 
is the forecast. “When some-
thing bad is coming, that’s really 
when we need to be at the top of 
our game,” he says. Of the three 
most damaging effects of hurri-
canes—wind, storm surge, and 
rain—rain is one of the most dif-
ficult to quantify in advance. 
The heaviest rain typically falls 
in small pockets, and that level 
of precision is difficult to attain 
more than six to 12 hours ahead 
of its arrival. Houston’s physical 
size also makes rain forecasts 
challenging: Each side of the 
I-10, for instance—one of several 
highways that serve as bound-
aries in an otherwise endless 
city—might receive a substan-
tially different amount.
A good meteorologist is 
almost always, by definition, 
skilled at pattern recogni-
tion. Weather, like the law, is 
built on a foundation of sim-
ilar cases. Veteran meteorol-
ogists—Reilly has been in the 
job for 24 years—mine their 
memories for analogues. In the 
early hours of Harvey, Reilly’s 
team began upping the National 
Weather Service’s rain fore-
cast to amounts that no one 
had ever seen: 25 inches, 30, 
and eventually 50, over a wide-
spread swath of Houston. Reilly 
set aside everything he knew 
about the weather and decided 
to obey the combination of awe 
and dread he felt in his chest: 
A killing flood was on its way.
The next part of the job, and 
perhaps the more important one, 
is getting the word out. At a time 
when the weather can be more 
extreme than ever, and trust in 
government is low, convincing 
people to heed your warnings, 
especially the most severe of 
them, might now be the weather 
forecaster’s harder task. The 
most serious warning when it 
comes to rain is called a Flash 
Flood Emergency, and before 
Harvey, the Houston office had 
issued that warning on only 
three occasions. It would soon 
be used for a fourth.
Berger, sitting behind his Spar-
tan desk that afternoon, anxi-
ety beginning to weigh on him 
like heat, was first among those 
who might listen—and to whom 
others might listen about the 
coming storm. He wasn’t the 
government; he was a human 
being, and somehow the warn-
ings sounded different to their 
ears coming from him, the kind 
of measured voice that shines 
through in a crisis. After he had 
written his ominous flood fore-
cast three times, he looked out his 
office window at one of the two 
garages he keeps. One of them 
was bursting with new things 
for his new house, and he began 
ferrying boxes upstairs to his 
office, filling the space in front 
of his desk with new light fix-
tures, a microwave, and a tub. In 
between trips, he heard Amanda 
making arrangements to take 
shelter, with their daughters, at 
her sister’s house, built on pilings 
and tucked away from the wind.
Berger would stay. He would 
hunker down behind his wall 
of boxes with his PC and his 
readers, now numbering in 
the hundreds of thousands, for 
the duration of the storm. He 
knew that his city was in seri-
ous trouble, and he felt an almost 
spiritual need to convince his 
neighbors that it was time for 
them to share his fears.
THE WEATHER STARTED 
making an impression on Berger 
in 2001, when Tropical Storm 
Allison came to town. Berger 
is from Michigan but had gone 
to the University of Texas to 
earn his astronomy degree. He 
moved to Houston for a girl, 
first working weekends at 
the Houston Chronicle before 
becoming the paper’s desig-
nated “SciGuy,” writing mostly 
about physics, chemistry, and 
astronomy. He also wrote a lit-
tle about the weather.
He had just bought his first 
house near White Oak Bayou. 
On June 8, a Friday night—what 
was it about storms and Fri-
day nights?—he went out with 
some friends to see a Bob Schnei-
der concert. Allison had passed 
through Houston once already, 
but now it returned to take a 
second run at the city. Berger 
remembers that the sound of 
the rain on the roof drowned 
out Schneider, as though there 
was too much percussion in the 
mix. After the concert, he and his 
friends left to wander around 
midtown, gawking at the water 
rising on the empty streets.
Berger wrote about the storm. 
One of his stories, about the 
drowning deaths of tens of 
thousands of research animals 
in the basement of the Texas 
Medical Center, drew massive 
national readership. He began 
having visions—he saw a place 
for thoughtful written analysis 
of the weather online. His dis-
cussions could be more timely 
and interactive than the fore-
casts printed in the paper itself. 
And unlike TV meteorologists, 
he needn’t worry about ratings 
or being available to viewers 
only at certain designated times.
In June 2005, he started his 
own blog on the Chronicle’s site. 
Somehow 
the warnings 
sounded 
different 
coming from 
him.

JAN 2018
He didn’t yet have any meteoro-
logical training; he was just some-
one who liked talking about the 
weather. (His colleagues called 
him “Weather Boy.” It was not a 
compliment.) Three months later 
came Katrina. Then came Rita. 
And three years later, Hurricane 
Ike. Berger’s life could seem gov-
erned by storms; even his first 
meeting with Amanda, whom he 
married in 2002, came only a few 
weeks after Allison’s transfor-
mative rains. He convinced the 
newspaper to put him through 
a distance learning program at 
Mississippi State to earn his cer-
tification as a professional mete-
orologist. Modern technology 
and information dissemination 
have led to a democratization of 
weather forecasting, and that 
could mean compounding disas-
ter in the wrong hands. Berger 
wanted to make sure his hands 
were the right ones.
When he left the Chronicle 
to join Ars Technica in Octo-
ber of 2015, he started Space 
City Weather. The day after he 
opened up shop, the remnants of 
Hurricane Patricia began cloud-
ing the skies of Houston. He was 
supposed to go out for dinner 
with Amanda. He worried his 
readers would feel he’d aban-
doned them in a time of need, 
and he couldn’t help writing a 
post. His first forecast on Space 
City Weather was for a flood.
Now in August 2017, the rains 
on Harvey’s opening night 
shocked even him. They were 
biblical. Rain falling at a rate 
of 2 inches an hour would force 
most drivers to pull over. Har-
vey would sometimes drop 5. It 
didn’t look like water; it looked 
like milk. Worse, Berger studied 
the models and the satellite imag-
ery, and if he knew anything in 
that moment, listening to the rain 
against his window, he knew that 
there was so much more to come.
On Saturday, August 26, 
an hour after sunset, the eve-
ning’s first band of precipita-
tion, which on radar resembled 
the longest tentacles of an angry 
squid, opened up over Houston, 
slowly crossing the city from 
west to east. As predicted by the 
European model, it stalled. Addi-
tional bands trailing behind it 
intensified and merged with the 
first. This created what meteo-
rologists properly call a seeth-
ing nexus of hate, Berger later 
wrote. The now-combined band 
extended more than 400 miles 
over Galveston and deep into the 
too-warm waters of the Gulf, cre-
ating a superhighway for rain to 
be delivered directly to Houston. 
By very early Sunday morning, 
Harvey’s enormous size began to 
tell, and another band prepared 
to make its assault on the already 
flooded southern suburbs. The 
Houston branch of the NWS had 
issued its special emergency bul-
letin, and in the adjacent Office 
of Emergency Management, the 
walls were being papered with 
calls for water rescues. People 
were drowning in the rain.
A sleepless Berger sat down 
at his desk and began writing 
a new post. Amanda and their 
daughters had been at her sister’s 
house for several hours, and she 
texted him to ask if he thought 
the latest band would be the 
end of it. He inserted the scene 
into his piece, which went up 
at 2:10 am on Sunday morning.
I wanted nothing more than to 
fall in her arms and tell her yes, 
this was it. By God, yes. Let’s go 
to bed and forget this ever hap-
pened. It had to be it, surely.
It would not be it. Harvey 
would make true Berger’s most 
pessimistic projections and 
refuse to leave. He would tell 
his readers that the rain would 
continue, especially at night. He 
would later hear that adminis-
trators at the Houston Method-
ist Hospital and Baylor College 
of Medicine were among those 
looking to him for guidance. He 
would harbor a guilt for deliver-
ing bad news for so many.
At 12:03 pm on Sunday, Berger 
finished writing a post that  
he titled: “Houston, We Will  
Get Through This.”
With the prospect of more 
rain, you may feel hopeless 
or helpless, or both. From a 
mental health standpoint, the 
uncertainty this brings adds a 
considerable amount of stress 
to an already stressful situa-
tion. I wish we could tell you 
when the rains will end, but 
we can’t. Here’s one thing we 
are sure of, however. The rains 
will end. After that the sun will 
come out.
More than a million people 
would visit Space City Weather 
on Sunday alone. Hurricane  
Harvey already had a name. 
Now it had its face.
ON TUESDAY EVENING, 
more than four days after the 
rain first started to fall, Berger 
would finally write: It’s over.
He had been nearly perfect 
in his forecast. It hadn’t been 
all that windy, so there weren’t 
many roofs blown off or trees 
toppled, except in those few 
cursed places that were also 
visited by tornadoes. And there 
wasn’t much local storm surge. 
The water didn’t come rush-
ing through Houston. It didn’t 
arrive in walls the way it did in 
New Orleans with Katrina, one 
of the reasons Harvey directly 
killed 68 people, many in their 
cars, instead of an estimated 
1,833 people, many in their beds. 

At 12:03 pm 
on Sunday, 
Berger finished 
writing a post 
titled: “Houston, 
We Will Get 
Through This.”

FORECASTING
Harvey was a cataclysmic rain 
event, just as Berger had feared. 
He could have been wrong and 
his readers would have moved 
their furniture back downstairs 
and grumbled about the wasted 
effort. But he had been right, and 
thousands of his readers didn’t 
have a downstairs anymore.
A month after the storm, 
Berger dropped into his Hyun-
dai hybrid and went for a drive. 
He wanted to see the terrible 
reality that had accompanied 
his forecasts, as though he could 
use the reminder that Harvey 
really did do what it did, to Hous-
ton and to him. By then the last 
part of weather analysis, the 
accounting of the aftermath, was 
nearly complete. It had rained 
so hard for so long that Hous-
ton’s swamps and reservoirs and 
drainage canals filled up, which 
meant that the city’s kitchens 
and living rooms and dens filled 
up next. Then the water drained 
away. In the time in between it 
made an estimated $75 billion 
in property irreparably wet.
He headed south toward Dick-
inson, one of the worst-hit areas. 
On some streets, every house 
had an enormous pile of debris 
out front—everything that had 
been inside the house was now 
outside of it, rotting in the sun. 
Other streets had been picked 
clean, and they looked almost 
normal, except that through their 
windows, Berger could see that 
the otherwise pristine- seeming 
houses had been stripped down 
to the studs. 
There was a photograph that 
had made the rounds during 
the storm. It was of the flood-
soaked residents of a nursing 
home, sitting on their loungers 
and walkers, water up to their 
chests. It seemed like a maca-
bre piece of surrealist art. On 
his tour, Berger decided to visit 
that nursing home, La Vita Bella. 
Nearly everything that wasn’t 
human in that photograph was 
now sitting out in the yard. The 
lamps, the chairs, and the pop-
corn machine from that haunt-
ing image melted in the piles of 
sodden sheetrock and carpet, 
relics of a viral infamy. They 
were joined by smaller but per-
haps more significant losses: a 
stuffed animal, a deck of play-
ing cards, a broken mirror, a lip-
stick and a rouge, a large-print 
copy of Marley & Me.
Berger had also lost a book in 
the flood. Before dawn on Sunday, 
lightning had lit up the sky, and he 
could see that water had reached 
his garages. He had mostly emp-
tied one but not the other—not 
the one that contained his old 
things, his diplomas and his 
Appetite for Destruction poster 
and his boxes of books. He raced 
down and lifted up a box from the 
floor and its bottom fell out. A 
book titled From Dawn to Deca-
dence by Jacques Barzun dropped 
into the water and disappeared. 
Berger had treasured that book, 
a massive 500-year history of 
Western civilization. Its French-
born author had died in Texas in 
2012. Barzun was 104 years old, 
and the book had been his life’s 
work. Something about losing 
that particular book hit Berger 
harder than it might have. It was 
a metaphor for how easily even 
our monuments can be erased.
He had written about the loss 
of that book and other things in 
a post that went up on Ars Tech-
nica early in the morning on 
August 30, the Wednesday after 
the storm. The post was titled 
“This Is Probably the Worst US 
Flood Storm Ever, and I’ll Never 
Be the Same.” The cardboard 
box had failed, he wrote, and 
the book had dropped into the 
murk. Almost immediately, a 
current from the rushing water 
beyond the garage door pulled 
the tome away, forever. Damn, 
I loved that book. An indescrib-
ably bad night had just gotten 
that little bit worse.
Berger started receiving 
emails and notes from his grate-
ful readers. They had saved some 
of their own treasures because of 
his warnings, and they felt they 
had a debt to settle. A copy of 
From Dawn to Decadence was 
eventually put into his hands by 
a stranger, a woman who had 
attended a talk he had over-
come his nerves to give after 
the storm. That book now sits 
high and dry on a shelf in his 
office, a tiny reminder of the 
things that Harvey had taken, 
but also a reminder of the things 
it had delivered.
The National Weather Ser-
vice is part of a necessary and 
effective meteorological bureau-
cracy. It is staffed by thousands 
of people—by good and compe-
tent forecasters who care deeply 
about the weather and its effects 
on their communities. The NWS 
can offer its best daily guess, 
informed by their forecasters’ 
computer models and profes-
sional experiences. It can give 
warnings and sound alarms.
But the NWS can’t talk about 
the weather the way human 
beings talk about the weather. 
It can’t explore each of its uncer-
tainties, almost reveling in the 
sweeping possibilities of hurri-
canes and their animal behav-
iors. It can’t riff. 
More important, when the 
weather is at its worst: The 
National Weather Service can’t 
comfort. Even though Dan Reilly 
and his colleagues live and work 
in greater Houston, even though 
they were plenty concerned 
during Harvey for their own 
families and homes, they can’t 
issue a bulletin that says, We’re 
sick and tired of the rain, just like 
everyone else. They can’t write: 
The rains will end. After that the 
sun will come out.
Only someone like Eric Berger 
can do that, providing a weather 
forecast that includes words like 
hope or sorry or maybe. Only 
someone like Eric Berger can 
employ our best technology in 
a way that still feels intimate 
and human-scale, applying the 
wisdom of satellites to Deb Wal-
ters and her doomed party. Only 
someone like Eric Berger, look-
ing out his window at the rain 
and willing for it to stop even 
though he knows that it won’t 
be stopping anytime soon, can 
speak to a family watching the 
water on its torturous rise to 
their door, the winds threat-
ening the entirety of their lives, 
and make them feel a little less 
alone in the storm.  Harvey’s unrelenting  
rain left so much  
underwater—like these 
orchards in Pecan Grove.

ENTER 
THE AGE OF
SOCIAL 
CREDIT.

2015, when Lazarus Liu moved home to 
China after studying logistics in the 
United Kingdom for three years, he 
quickly noticed that something had 
changed: Everyone paid for everything 
with their phones. At McDonald’s, the 
convenience store, even at mom-and-pop 
restaurants, his friends in Shanghai 
used mobile payments. Cash, Liu could 
see, had been largely replaced by two 
smartphone apps: Alipay and WeChat 
Pay. One day, at a vegetable market, 
he watched a woman his mother’s age 
pull out her phone to pay for her gro-
ceries. He decided to sign up.¶ To get 
an Alipay ID, Liu had to enter his cell 
phone number and scan his national ID 
card. He did so reflexively. Alipay had 
built a reputation for reliability, 
and compared to going to a bank man-
aged with slothlike indifference and 
zero attention to customer service, 
signing up for Alipay was almost fun. 
With just a few clicks he was in. Ali-
pay’s slogan summed up the experience: 
“Trust makes it simple.”
I l l u s t r a t i o n s  b y  J a m e s  G r a h a m

Alipay turned out to be so convenient that 
Liu began using it multiple times a day, start-
ing first thing in the morning, when he ordered 
breakfast through a food delivery app. He real-
ized that he could pay for parking through Ali-
pay’s My Car feature, so he added his driver’s 
license and license plate numbers, as well as 
the engine number of his Audi. He started 
making his car insurance payments with the 
app. He booked doctors’ appointments there, 
skipping the chaotic lines for which Chinese 
hospitals are famous. He added friends in 
Alipay’s built-in social network. When Liu 
went on vacation with his fiancée (now his 
wife) to Thailand, they paid at restaurants 
and bought trinkets with Alipay. He stored 
whatever money was left over, which wasn’t 
much once the vacation and car were paid 
for, in an Alipay money market account. He 
could have paid his electricity, gas, and inter-
net bills in Alipay’s City Service section. Like 
many young Chinese who had become enam-
ored of the mobile payment services offered 
by Alipay and WeChat, Liu stopped bringing 
his wallet when he left the house.
If you live in the United States, you are by 
now accustomed to relinquishing your data 
to corporations. Credit card companies know 
when you run up bar tabs or buy sex toys. Face-
book knows if you like Tasty cooking videos or 
Breitbart News. Uber knows where you go and 
how you behave en route. But Alipay knows 
all of these things about its users and more. 
Owned by Ant Financial, an affiliate of the 
massive Alibaba corporation, Alipay is some-
times called a super app. Its main competitor, 
WeChat, belongs to the social and gaming giant 
Tencent. Alipay and WeChat are less like indi-
vidual apps than entire ecosystems. Whenever 
Liu opened Alipay on his phone, he saw a neat 
grid of icons that vaguely resembled the home 
screen on his Samsung. Some of the icons were 
themselves full-blown third-party apps. If he 
wanted to, he could access Airbnb, Uber, or 
Uber’s Chinese rival Didi, entirely from inside 
Alipay. It was as if Amazon had swallowed eBay, 
Apple News, Groupon, American Express, Citi-
bank, and YouTube—and could siphon up data 
from all of them.
One day a new icon appeared on Liu’s Ali-
pay home screen. It was labeled Zhima Credit 
(or Sesame Credit). The name, like that of Ali-
pay’s parent company, evoked the story of Ali 
Baba and the 40 thieves, in which the words 
open sesame magically unseal a cave full of 
treasure. When Liu touched the icon, he was 
greeted by an image of the Earth. “Zhima Credit 
is the embodiment of personal credit,” the text 
underneath read. “It uses big data to conduct 
an objective assessment. The higher the score, 
the better your credit.” Further down was a but-
ton that read, in clean white characters, “Start 
my credit journey.” He tapped.
IN 1956 AN ELECTRICAL ENGINEER NAMED BILL 
F A I R and a mathematician named Earl Isaac 
started a small tech company out of a San Fran-
cisco apartment. They named it Fair, Isaac and 
Co., but the business eventually came to be 
known, for short, as FICO. Their chief inno-
vation was using computer -driven statistical 
 analysis to translate people’s personal details 
and financial history into a simple score, pre-
dicting how likely they were to pay back loans. 
Before FICO, credit bureaus relied in part on 
gossip culled from people’s landlords, neigh-
bors, and local grocers. Applicants’ race could be 
counted against them, as could messiness, poor 
morals, and “effeminate gestures.” Algorith-
mic scoring, Fair and Isaac argued, was a more 
equitable, scientific alternative to this unfair 
reality. FICO’s approach eventually caught on 
among the credit bureaus—TransUnion, Expe-
rian, and Equifax—and in 1989 FICO introduced 
the credit score we know today, enabling mil-
lions of Americans to take out mortgages and 
rack up credit card bills.
During the past 30 years, by contrast, China 
has grown to become the world’s second largest 
economy without much of a functioning credit 
system at all. The People’s Bank of China, the 
country’s central banking regulator, maintains 
records on millions of consumers, but they 
often contain little or no information. Until 
recently, it was difficult to get a credit card 
with any bank other than your own. Consum-
ers mainly used cash. As housing prices spiked, 
this became increasingly untenable. “Now you 
need two suitcases to buy a house, not just one,” 
says Zennon Kapron, who heads the financial 
tech consultancy Kapronasia. Still, efforts to 
establish a reliable credit system foundered 
because China lacked a third-party credit scor-
ing entity. What it did have by the end of 2011 
were 356 million smartphone users.
That year, Ant Financial launched a version 
of Alipay with a built-in scanner for reading 
QR codes—square, machine-readable labels 
that can hold over 100 times more informa-
tion than a standard bar code. (WeChat Pay, 
which launched in 2013, has a similar built-in 
scanner.) Scanning a QR code can bring you to 
a website, or pull up an app, or connect you to

showing up on graves (scan to learn more about 
the deceased) and the shirts of waiters (scan 
to tip). Beggars printed out QR codes and set 
them out on the street. The codes linked the 
online and offline realms on a scale not seen any-
where else in the world. That first year with the 
QR scanner, Alipay mobile payments reached 
nearly $70 billion. 
In 2013, Ant Financial executives retreated to 
the mountains outside Hangzhou to discuss cre-
ating a slew of new products; one of them was 
Zhima Credit. The executives realized that they 
could use the data-collecting powers of Alipay 
to calculate a credit score based on an individ-
ual’s activities. “It was a very natural process,” 
says You Xi, a Chinese business reporter who 
detailed this pivotal meeting in a recent book, 
Ant Financial. “If you have payment data, you 
can assess the credit of a person.” And so the 
tech company began the process of creating a 
score that would be “credit for everything in 
your life,” as You explains it. 
Ant Financial wasn’t the only entity keen on 
using data to measure people’s worth. Coinci-
dentally or not, in 2014 the Chinese government 
announced it was developing what it called 
a system of “social credit.” In 2014, the State 
Council, China’s governing cabinet, publicly 
called for the establishment of a nationwide 
tracking system to rate the reputations of indi-
viduals, businesses, and even government offi-
cials. The aim is for every Chinese citizen to be 
trailed by a file compiling data from public and 
private sources by 2020, and for those files to 
be searchable by fingerprints and other biomet-
ric characteristics. The State Council calls it a 
“credit system that covers the whole society.”
For the Chinese Communist Party, social 
credit is an attempt at a softer, more invisible 
authoritarianism. The goal is to nudge people 
toward behaviors ranging from energy con-
servation to obedience to the Party. Samantha 
Hoffman, a consultant with the International 
Institute for Strategic Studies in London who 
is researching social credit, says that the gov-
ernment wants to preempt instability that 
might threaten the Party. “That’s why social 
credit ideally requires both coercive aspects 
and nicer aspects, like providing social ser-
vices and solving real problems. It’s all under 
the same Orwellian umbrella.”
In 2015 Ant Financial was one of eight tech 
companies granted approval from the Peo-
ple’s Bank of China to develop their own pri-
vate credit scoring platforms. Zhima Credit 
appeared in the Alipay app shortly after that. 
The service tracks your behavior on the app 
to arrive at a score between 350 and 950, and 
offers perks and rewards to those with good 
scores. Zhima Credit’s algorithm considers not 
only whether you repay your bills but also what 
you buy, what degrees you hold, and the scores 
of your friends. Like Fair and Isaac decades ear-
lier, Ant Financial executives talked publicly 
about how a data-driven approach would open 
up the financial system to people who had been 
locked out, like students and rural Chinese. For 
the more than 200 million Alipay users who 
have opted in to Zhima Credit, the sell is clear: 
Your data will magically open doors for you. 
Participating in Zhima Credit is voluntary, and 
it’s unclear whether or how signing up for it could 
affect an individual’s rating in the government 
system. Ant Financial declined to let me inter-
view anyone from the company, but did provide 
a statement from Hu Tao, the general manager of 
Zhima Credit. “Zhima Credit is dedicated to cre-
ating trust in a commercial setting and indepen-
dent of any government-initiated social credit 
system,” the statement reads. “Zhima Credit 
does not share user scores or underlying data 
with any third party including the government 
without the user’s prior consent.” 
Ant Financial did state, however, in a 2015 press 
release that the company plans “to help build a 
social integrity system.” And the company has 
already cooperated with the Chinese govern-
ment in one important way: It has integrated 
a blacklist of more than 6 million people who 
have defaulted on court fines into Zhima Credit’s 
database. According to Xinhua, the state news 
agency, this union of big tech and big government 
has helped courts punish more than 1.21 million 
defaulters, who opened their Zhima Credit one 
day to find their scores plunging. 
The State Council has signaled that under 
the national social credit system people will 
be penalized for the crime of spreading online 
rumors, among other offenses, and that those 
deemed “seriously untrustworthy” can expect 
to receive substandard services. Ant Financial 
appears to be aiming for a society divided along 
moral lines as well. As Lucy Peng, the compa-
ny’s chief executive, was quoted as saying in 
Ant Financial, Zhima Credit “will ensure that 
the bad people in society don’t have a place 
to go, while good people can move freely and 
without obstruction.”
I LIVED IN CHINA FOR THE BETTER PART OF A

in China. (In contrast, the US mobile payments 
market in 2016 was worth roughly $112 bil-
lion.) When I returned for a visit in August, I

was determined to be a part of the new cash-
less China. So I signed up for Alipay and Zhima 
Credit a few hours after emerging bleary-eyed 
from the plane. Because I lacked a transaction 
history, I immediately faced what felt like an 
embarrassing judgment: a score of 550.
On my first day in Shanghai, I opened Zhima 
Credit to scan a yellow bike that I found parked 
at an angle on the sidewalk. China’s bike-sharing 
culture had, like mobile payments, emerged out 
of nowhere, and Shanghai’s streets were littered 
with brightly colored bikes, deposited wherever 
the riders pleased. A scan of a bike’s QR code 
revealed a four-digit number that unlocked the 
back wheel, and a ride across town cost roughly 
15 cents. Because of my middling score, however, 
I had to pay a $30 deposit before I could scan 
my first bike. Nor could I get deposit-free hotel 
stays or GoPro rentals, or free umbrella rentals. 
I belonged to the digital underclass.
In China, anxiety about pianzi, or swindlers, 
runs deep. How do I know youÕre not a pianzi? 
is a question people often ask when salespeo-
ple call on the phone or repairmen show up at 
the door. While my score likely didn’t put me in 
the ranks of pianzi, one promise of Zhima Credit 
was identifying those who were. Companies 
can buy risk assessments for users that detail 
whether they have paid their rent or utilities or 
appear on the court blacklist. For businesses, 
such products are billed as time-savers. On 
the site Tencent Video, I stumbled across an 
ad for Zhima Credit in which a businessman 
scrutinizes strangers as he rides the subway. 
“Everybody looks like a pianzi,” he despairs. 
His employees, trying to guard against shady 
customers, cover the office conference room 
walls with photos of lowlifes and criminals. But 
then—tada!—the boss discovers Zhima Credit, 
and all of their problems are solved. The staff 
celebrate by tearing the photos off the wall.
For those with good behavior, Zhima Credit 
offers perks through cooperation agreements 
that Ant Financial has signed with hundreds of 
companies and institutions. Shenzhou Zuche, 
a car rental company, allows people with credit 
scores over 650 to rent a car without a deposit. 
In exchange for this vetting, Shenzhou Zuche 
shares data, so that if a Zhima Credit user 
crashes one of the rental company’s cars and 
refuses to pay up, that detail is fed back into 
his or her credit score. For a while people with 
scores over 750 could even skip the security 
check line at Beijing Capital Airport.
Two years after signing up for Zhima Credit, 
Lazarus Liu was trending up to that number. I 
met Liu, who is 27 and works at a large corpo-
ration, one Saturday afternoon at a mall in cen-
tral Shanghai, outside a Forever 21. He wore a 
black shirt, black sneakers, and black Air Jor-
dan shorts, and his face was framed by a fresh 
fade, with a jolt of black hair that flopped to 
one side. We walked to a Starbucks filled with 
young people hunched over their phones, sip-
ping peach iced teas and green tea Frappucci-
nos. Liu claimed the last open table.
Liu told me that he chose his English name, 
Lazarus, after converting to Catholicism three 
years ago, but that his religion was mostly a pri-
vate affair. He saw his Zhima Credit score the 
same way; it revealed something about him, 
but he kept those insights mostly to himself. 
He rarely checked his score—it just lurked in 
the background of the Alipay app on his Sam-
sung—and because it was good, he didn’t have 
to. After starting at 600 out of a possible 950 
points, he had reached 722, a score that enti-
tled him to favorable terms on loans and apart-
ment rentals, as well as showcasing on several 
dating apps should he and his wife ever split 
up. With a few dozen more points, he could get 
a streamlined visa to Luxembourg, not that he 
was planning such a trip.
As Liu amassed a favorable transaction and 
payment history on Alipay, his score naturally 
improved. But it could go down if he neglected 
to pay a traffic fine, for example. And the privi-
leges that come with a high score might some-
day be revoked for behaviors that have nothing 
to do with consumer etiquette. In June 2015, as 
9.4 million Chinese teenagers took the grueling 
national college entrance examination, Hu Tao, 
the Zhima Credit general manager, told report-
ers that Ant Financial hoped to obtain a list of 
students who cheated, so that the fraud could 
become a blight on their Zhima Credit records. 
“There should be consequences for dishonest 
behavior,” she avowed. The good were moving 
without obstruction. A threat hung over the rest.
ALIPAY KNOWS THAT AT 1 PM ON THE AFTERNOON 
of August 26, I rented an Ofo brand bike outside 
Shanghai’s former French Concession and rode 
north, parking it across from Jing’an Temple. 
It knows that at 1:24 pm I bought a snack in the 
mall next to the temple. It knows that afterward 
I got in a Didi car bound for a neighborhood to 
the northwest. It knows that at 3:11 pm I dis-
embarked and entered a supermarket, and it 
knows (because Alibaba owns the supermarket, 
which accepts only Alipay at checkout) that at 
3:36 pm I bought bananas, cheese, and crack-
ers. It knows that I then got in a taxi, and that I 
arrived at my destination at 4:01 pm. It knows 
the identification number of the taxi that drove 
me there. It knows that at 4:19 pm I paid $8 for 
an Amazon delivery. For three sweet hours—

one of which I spent in the swimming pool—it 
does not know my whereabouts. Then it knows 
that I rented another Ofo bike outside a hotel 
in central Shanghai, cycled 10 minutes, and at 
7:11 pm parked it outside a popular restaurant. 
Because Ant Financial is a strategic investor in 
Ofo, Alipay might know the route I took.
The algorithm behind my Zhima Credit score 
is a corporate secret. Ant Financial officially lists 
five broad categories of information that feed 
into the score, but the company provides only 
the barest of details about how these ingredi-
ents are cooked together. Like any conventional 
credit scoring system, Zhima Credit monitors 
my spending history and whether I have repaid 
my loans. But elsewhere the algorithm veers into 
voodoo, or worse. A category called Connections 
considers the credit of my contacts in Alipay’s 
social network. Characteristics takes into con-
sideration what kind of car I drive, where I work, 
and where I went to school. A category called 
Behavior, meanwhile, scrutinizes the nuances 
of my consumer life, zeroing in on actions that 
purportedly correlate with good credit. Shortly 
after Zhima Credit’s launch, the company’s tech-
nology director, Li Yingyun, told the Chinese mag-
azine Caixin that spending behavior like buying 
diapers, say, could boost one’s score, while play-
ing videogames for hours on end could lower it. 
Online speculation held that donating to charity, 
presumably through Alipay’s built-in donation 
service, was good. But I’m not sure whether the 
$3 I gave for feeding brown bear cubs qualifies me 
as a philanthropist or a cheapskate.
I began to check my score obsessively, but 
because scores are only reevaluated monthly, 
the number didn’t budge. Each time I opened 
the app, I encountered an alarming orange 
screen. In the foreground was a gauge in the 
shape of a half-circle, with a dial showing that 
I had reached only a quarter of my potential. An 
article on the portal Sohu.com explained that 
my score put me in the category of “common 
folk.” The page read: “Cultural level is not high. 
Retired or nearly retired.” In China, where many 
elderly lost out on years of education during the 
Cultural Revolution, this was not a compliment. 
According to Sohu, only 5 percent of the popu-
lation had scores worse than mine.
To see if I could do anything to pull my score 
up, I took a taxi one morning to a chic open-air 
shopping center outside Shanghai’s city center 
to meet with Chen Chen, a 30-year-old illustra-
tor. Chen told a mutual friend on WeChat that 
she had an “excellent” rating on Zhima Credit, 
and I wanted to ask her counsel. We bought 
coffee and walked to an outdoor seating area. 
Chen wore a button-down shirt open over a 
white T-shirt and skinny jeans. Her hair was 
bleached to a straw yellow, and a line of spar-
kly eye shadow was swept under each eye. On 
Zhima Credit she clocked in at 710, and her back-
ground color was a calming sky blue.
She explained how to boost my score. “They 
will check what kind of friends you have,” she 
said. “If your friends are all high-score people, 
it’s good for you. If you have some bad-credit 
people as friends, it’s not nice.” After signing 
up for Alipay, I sent friend requests to all of my 
phone contacts. Only six people accepted. One of 
my new Alipay friends was a man I used to tutor 
in English and probably my wealthiest friend in 
Shanghai. He owned several businesses, a fleet 
of cars, and a spacious villa in a posh neighbor-
hood. But another was my old tailor, who lived 
with her family in a single room in a dilapidated 
house, with piles of cloth obscuring the thin 
windows. Did the tailor’s impact on my score 
cancel out the businessman’s? And was I drag-
ging both of them down?
Chen said she knew the scores of her close 
friends but not those of acquaintances or work 
colleagues. There are chat rooms where people 
with decent scores seek out other high scorers, 
presumably to boost their ratings. But in general, 
people simply make assumptions about which 
contacts have good credit and which are better 
left unfriended. Users like Chen hadn’t yet taken 
the step of shutting low scorers like me out of their 
network, she assured me. Zhima Credit was still 
fairly new, and an acquaintance’s low score might 
still be charitably explained, she said: “Maybe 
they just haven’t used it long enough.”

engineering holds for Chinese leaders, you have 
to go back decades, to long before apps and big 
data. In the years after the 1949 Communist 
Revolution, the government assigned everyone 
to local work units, which became the locus of 
surveillance and control. Individuals spied on 
their neighbors while also doing everything 
they could to avoid black marks on their own 
dang’an, or government files. But maintaining 
the system required massive state effort and 
oversight. As economic reforms in the 1980s 
led millions of people to leave their villages and 
migrate to cities, the work unit system fell apart. 
Migration also had a secondary effect: Cities 
filled up with strangers and pianzi.
It didn’t take long for the central government 
to start thinking about gamifying good behavior. 
“If we are going to have a market system that is 
supposed to be self-guiding, we also need to have 
self-guiding credit systems,” says Rogier Creem-
ers, a scholar of Chinese law at the Leiden Institute 
for Area Studies in the Netherlands. In the late 

1990s, a working group at a Chinese Academy of 
Sciences institute developed the basic concepts 
behind the social credit systems. But the tech-
nology wasn’t advanced enough to support the 
Communist Party’s broader political designs.
Nearly a decade ago, I spent a few weeks in 
Suining, a mostly rural county in Jiangsu prov-
ince, near Shanghai. Back then, local gover-
nance was not subtle. When officials decided 
to clamp down on people running red lights, 
they urged citizens to take pictures of offend-
ers, whose images would later be featured on 
the local television channel. 
Then, in 2010, Suining became one of the first 
areas in China to pilot a social credit system. 
Officials there began assessing residents on a 
range of criteria, including education level, online 
behavior, and how well they followed traffic laws. 
Each of Suining’s 1.1 million citizens older than 
14 started out with 1,000 points, and points were 
added or deducted based on behavior. Taking care 
of elderly family members earned you 50 points. 
Helping the poor merited 10 points. Helping the 
poor in a way that was reported by the media: 15. 
A drunk driving conviction meant the loss of 50 
points, as did bribing an official. After the points 
were tallied up, citizens were assigned grades 
of A, B, C, or D. Grade A citizens would be given 
priority for school admissions and employment, 
while D citizens would be denied licenses, per-
mits, and access to some social services.
The Suining system was rudimentary, and it 
briefly sparked a national debate over what cri-
teria should be included in a social credit score. 
But it provided a testing ground for what could 
work nationally. And however crude the letter 
grades were, they were less crude than what they 
replaced. Social credit in Suining was accompa-
nied by a shift to subtler government messaging. 
Since the Suining pilot, dozens of cities have 
developed their own systems. The power of 
technology had caught up. Eventually, these 
systems will be integrated into the nationwide 
government social credit system, which entails 
a significant logistical headache. To aid in the 
task, the government has enlisted Baidu, a big 
tech company, to help develop the social credit 
database by the 2020 deadline. 
The Chinese tech companies have, in their 
way, helped to shift the Party’s attitude toward 
digital technologies. When the internet first 
came to China, bursting into people’s lives in 
the form of blogs and chat rooms, the Party saw 
it as a threat. Here was a place where people 
might speak their minds, join together, dissent. 
Leaders responded to these impulses through 
censorship and other aggressive tactics. But 
companies like Ant Financial have shown just 
how useful digital technologies can be in gath-
ering and deploying information. Instead of 
merely reacting to content by banning search 
terms or shutting down websites, the govern-
ment now collaborates with the private sector 
In the US, your FICO credit score isn’t the only number that follows you

In 2015, a few months after Zhima Credit 
debuted, Alibaba founder Jack Ma and 14 other 
executives traveled to the US with President 
Xi  Jinping for his first state visit. Ma, along 
with leaders at Tencent and Baidu, also sits 
on the board of the Internet Society of China, 
a quasi- governmental organization under the 
direction of the Party.
This strategic nexus is a delicate one, though. 
In recent months Chinese regulators have taken 
steps to exert more control over tech companies. 
Last August, the People’s Bank of China ordered 
mobile and online payment companies to connect 
to a central government clearinghouse, giving reg-
ulators access to transaction data. Two months 
later, The Wall Street Journal reported that Chi-
nese internet regulators were considering taking 
a 1 percent stake in the major tech companies. 
One possible scenario for a social credit part-
nership is that the central bank will oversee the 
development of a broader metric, like a FICO score, 
while letting companies like Ant Financial collect 
data to feed into that score. Whatever its eventual 
structure, the larger social credit system “will defi-
nitely be under the government’s control,” says 
You Xi, the reporter who wrote the book about 
Ant Financial. “The government doesn’t want 
this very important infrastructure of the people’s 
credit in one big company’s hands.”
Chinese people who have been branded 
untrustworthy are getting the first glimpse of 
what a unified system might mean. One day last 
May, Liu Hu, a 42-year-old journalist, opened a 
travel app to book a flight. But when he entered his 
name and national ID number, the app informed 
him that the transaction wouldn’t go through 
because he was on the Supreme People’s Court 
blacklist. This list—literally, the List of Dishonest 
People—is the same one that is integrated into 
Zhima Credit. In 2015 Liu had been sued for defa-
mation by the subject of a story he’d written, and 
a court had ordered him to pay $1,350. He paid the 
fine, and even photographed the bank transfer slip 
and messaged the photo to the judge in the case. 
Perplexed as to why he was still on the list, he con-
tacted the judge and learned that, while transfer-
ring his fine, he had entered the wrong account 
number. He hurried to transfer the money again, 
following up to make sure the court had received 
it. This time the judge did not reply.
Although Liu hadn’t signed up for Zhima Credit, 
the blacklist caught up with him in other ways. He 
became, effectively, a second-class citizen. He 
was banned from most forms of travel; he could 
only book the lowest classes of seat on the slow-
est trains. He could not buy certain consumer 
goods or stay at luxury hotels, and he was ineli-
gible for large bank loans. Worse still, the black-
list was public. Liu had already spent a year in 
jail once before on charges of “fabricating and 
spreading rumors” after reporting on the shady 
dealings of a vice-mayor of Chong qing. The mem-
ory of imprisonment left him stoic about this 
new, more invisible punishment. At least he was 
still with his wife and daughter. 
Still, Liu took to his blog to stir up sympathy 
and convince the judge to take him off the list. As 
of October he was still on it. “There is almost no 
oversight of the court executors” who maintain 
the blacklist, he told me. “There are many mis-
takes in implementation that go uncorrected.” If 
Liu had a Zhima Credit score, his troubles would 
have been compounded by other worries. The 
way Zhima Credit is designed, being blacklisted 
sends you on a rapid downward spiral. First your 
score drops. Then your friends hear you are on the 
blacklist and, fearful that their scores might be 
affected, quietly drop you as a contact. The algo-
rithm notices, and your score plummets further.

to freeze my credit. When I tried to do so after

site was only partly operational, and its phone 
lines were jammed. Desperate, I signed up for a 
credit-monitoring service called Credit Karma, 
which, in exchange for the very same informa-
tion that I was trying to protect, showed me 
my score with two of the three major bureaus.
These numbers were communicated to me

it’s, down to the color coding of scores. I learned 
that my credit score had dipped by a few dozen 
points. There were four or five attempts to take 
out credit in my name that I didn’t recognize.
Now I had two tracking systems scoring me, on 
opposite sides of the globe. But these were only the 
scores that I knew about. Most Americans have doz-
ens of scores, many of them drawn from behavioral 
and demographic metrics similar to those used by 
Zhima Credit, and most of them held by companies 
that give us no chance to opt out. Others we enter 
into voluntarily. The US government can’t legally 
compel me to participate in some massive data-
driven social experiment, but I give up my data to 
private companies every day. I trust these corpo-
rations enough to participate in their vast scor-
ing experiments. I post my thoughts and feelings 
on Facebook and leave long trails of purchases on 
Amazon and eBay. I rate others in Airbnb and Uber 
and care a little too much about how others rate 
me. There is not yet a great American super app, 
and the scores compiled by data brokers are mainly 
used to better target ads, not to exert social control. 
But through a process called identity resolution, 
data aggregators can use the clues I leave behind 
to merge my data from various sources.
Do you take antidepressants? Frequently return 
clothes to retailers? Write your name in all caps 
when filling out online forms? Data brokers collect 
all of this information and more. As in China, you 
may even be penalized for who your friends are.

assessment that could consider the credit scores 
of people in your network. The patent describes 
a tool that arrives at an average credit score for 
your friends and rejects a loan application if that 
average is below a certain minimum. The com-
pany has since revised its platform policies to 
prohibit outside lenders from using Facebook 
data to determine credit eligibility. The company 
could still decide to get into the credit business 
itself, though. (“We often seek patents for tech-
nology we never implement, and patents should 
not be taken as an indication of future plans,” 
a Facebook spokesperson said in response to 
questions about the credit patent.) “You could 
imagine a future where people are watching to 
see if their friends’ credit is dropping and then 
dropping their friends if that affects them,” says 
Frank Pasquale, a big-data expert at University of 
Maryland Carey School of Law. “That’s terrifying.”
 Often, data brokers are flat-out wrong. The data 
broker Acxiom, which provides some informa-
tion about what it collects on a site called About-
TheData.com, has me pegged as a single woman 
with a high school education and a “likely Las 
Vegas gambler,” when in fact I’m married, have 
a master’s degree, and have never even bought 
a lottery ticket. But it is impossible to challenge 
these assessments, since we’re never told that 
they exist. I know more about Zhima Credit’s algo-
rithm than I do about how US data brokers rate 
me. This is, as Pasquale points out in his book The 
Black Box Society, essentially a “one-way mirror.”
After I left China, I checked back in with 
Lazarus Liu on WeChat. He sent me a screenshot 
of his Zhima Credit score, which had increased by 
eight points since we met. His screen read “Fan-
tastic,” and the font had shifted to soft italics.
We talked about a new facial recognition fea-
ture called Smile to Pay that Ant Financial had 
introduced at a concept restaurant in Hangzhou 
owned by KFC. The walls of the restaurant were 
adorned with gigantic white phones. To order, 
you simply tapped a picture of what you wanted 
and then showed the phone your face, typing in 
your cell phone number to confirm payment. 
First smartphones had eliminated the need for 
a wallet; now Smile to Pay eliminated the need 
for a phone. All you needed was your face.
Liu wasn’t eager to try Smile to Pay. The “gov-
ernment affairs” page on Zhima Credit’s website 
suggests that Ant Financial partners with local 
governments throughout China to use its facial 
recognition capabilities, but that wasn’t what 
made Liu uneasy. While studying abroad, he had 
played around with Android’s Face Unlock fea-
ture. His roommate, who shared his square jaw, 
had been able to unlock his phone a few times. 
“I feel that it could be unsafe,” he messaged me. 
“I would want to see that it’s the real thing.” 
He wrote real thing in English, for emphasis.
While chatting with Liu, I, too, had opened 
up Zhima Credit. My score had increased by 
four points. “You still have room to improve,” 
the app informed me delicately. But next to my 
new score, 554, was a small green arrow. I was 
on my way up.  M O S T

At Iraqi military intelligence headquarters in Baghdad, weapons inspector Damien Spleeters (left)  
and his coworker, Haider al-Hakim, look through crates of ISIS ammunition. Previous page: a PG-7 grenade 
launcher, one of thousands of weapons that Spleeters has tracked down.
“Habibi! Aluminium!”
The call echoes through the courtyard of 
a trash-strewn home in Tal Afar, a remote 
outpost in northern Iraq. It is late Septem-
ber and still hot, the kind of heat that seems 
to come from all sides, even radiate up from 
the ground, and the city is empty except for 
feral dogs and young men with guns.
“Habibi!” Damien Spleeters shouts again, 
using the casual Arabic term of endearment 
to call out for Haider al-Hakim, his Iraqi trans-
lator and partner on the ground.
Spleeters is a field investigator for Conflict 
Armament Research (CAR), an international 
organization funded by the European Union 
that documents weapons trafficking in war 
zones. He is 31 years old, with a 1980s Fred-
die Mercury mustache and tattoos covering 
thin arms that tan quickly in the desert sun. 
In another context, he’d be mistaken for a 
‹

hipster barista, not an investigator who has 
spent the past three years tracking down 
rocket- propelled grenades in Syria, AK-47-
style rifles in Mali, and hundreds of other 
weapons that have found their way into war 
zones, sometimes in violation of interna-
tional arms agreements. The work Spleet-
ers does is typically undertaken by secretive 
government offices, such as the US Defense 
Intelligence Agency’s Military Material Iden-
tification Division, known as Chuckwagon. 
But while Chuckwagon is barely discoverable 
by Google, Spleeters’ detailed reports for 
CAR are both publicly available online and 
contain more useful information than any 
classified intelligence I ever received when 
I was commanding a bomb disposal unit for 
the US military in Iraq in 2006.
In that fight, guerrillas ambushed Amer-
ican soldiers with IEDs. The devices I saw 
during my tours were largely hidden in the 
ground or deployed as massive car bombs, 
detonated in marketplaces and schools so 
that the gutters filled with blood. But the 
majority of those devices were crude, held 
together with duct tape and goopy solder. 
The few rockets and mortars the fighters 
possessed were old and shoddy, lacked the 
correct fuzes, and often failed to detonate.
Many of ISIS’ leaders were veterans of 
that insurgency, but as they began ramping 
up their war against the Iraqi government 
in 2014, they knew they needed more than 
IEDs and AK-47s to seize territory and create 
their independent Islamic State. A conven-
tional war required conventional arms—
mortars, rockets, grenades—which, as an 
international pariah, ISIS could not buy in 
sufficient quantities. Some they looted from 
the Iraqi or Syrian governments, but when 
those ran out they did something that no 
terrorist group has ever done before and 
that they continue to do today: design their 
own munitions and mass-produce them 
using advanced manufacturing techniques. 
Iraq’s oil fields provided the industrial base—
tool-and-die sets, high-end saws, injection- 
molding machines—and skilled workers who 
knew how to quickly fashion intricate parts 
to spec. Raw materials came from cannibal-
izing steel pipe and melting down scrap. ISIS 
engineers forged new fuzes, new rockets and 
launchers, and new bomblets to be dropped 
by drones, all assembled using instruction 
plans drawn up by ISIS officials.
Since the early days of the conflict, CAR 
has conducted 83 site visits in Iraq to collect 
weapons data, and Spleeters has participated 
in nearly every investigation. The result is a 
detailed database that lists 1,832 weapons 
and 40,984 pieces of ammunition recovered 
in Iraq and Syria. CAR describes it as “the 
most comprehensive  sample of Islamic State–
captured weapons and ammunition to date.”
Which is how, this autumn, Spleeters came 
to be hovering over a 5-gallon bucket of alu-
minum paste in a dingy home in Tal Afar, 
waiting for his fixer to arrive. Al-Hakim is 
bald, well-dressed, and gives off a faint air 
of the urban sophisticate, such that at times 
he looks a bit out of place in a sewage-filled 
ISIS workshop. The two men have an easy 
rapport, though one in which al-Hakim is 
the host and Spleeters always the respect-
ful guest. Their job is to notice small things; 
where others might see trash, they see evi-
dence, which Spleeters then photographs 
and scours for obscure factory codes that 
can give a clue to its origins.
The aluminum paste in the bucket, for 
example, which ISIS craftsmen mix with 
ammonium nitrate to make a potent main 
charge for mortars and rocket warheads: 
Spleeters discovered the same buckets, from 
the same manufacturers and chemical dis-
tributors, in Fallujah, Tikrit, and Mosul. “I 
like to see the same stuff” in different cit-
ies, he tells me, since these repeat sightings 
allow him to identify and describe different 
steps in ISIS’ supply chain. “It confirms my 
theory that this is the industrial revolution 
of terrorism,” he says. “And for that they 
need raw material in industrial quantities.”
Spleeters is also constantly searching for 
new weapons that show how ISIS engineers’ 
expertise is evolving, and with this trip to Tal 
Afar he has set his sights on one promising 
new lead: a series of modified rockets that 
had appeared in ISIS propaganda videos on 
YouTube and other social media.
Spleeters suspected that the tubes, trigger 
mechanisms, and fins of the new rockets were 
all the work of ISIS engineers, but he thought 
the warheads likely came from somewhere 
else. After discovering similar weapons over 
the past six months, he has grown to believe 
that ISIS may have captured the warheads 
from anti government militias in the Syrian 
civil war that had been secretly armed by 
Saudi Arabia and the United States.
But he needs more evidence to prove it. If 
he can find more launchers and more war-
heads, Spleeters believes he can build up 
enough proof—for the first time—that ISIS 
is repurposing powerful explosive ordnance, 
purchased by the US, for use in urban combat 
against the Iraqi army and its American spe-
cial operations partners. For ISIS to produce 
such sophisticated weapons marks a signif-
icant escalation of its ambition and ability. 
It also provides a disturbing glimpse of the 
future of warfare, where dark-web file shar-
ing and 3-D printing mean that any group, 
anywhere, could start a homegrown arms 
industry of its own.
Nearly all military munitions—from rifle 
cartridges to aircraft bombs, regardless of 
the country of origin—are engraved and 
marked in some way. The arcane codes can 
identify the date of manufacture, the specific 
production factory, the type of explosive 
filler, and the weapon’s name, also known

disposal officer, and veteran of the Iraq War.

as the nomenclature. For Spleeters, these 
engravings and markings mean that ord-
nance is “a document you cannot falsify.” 
Pressed stamps on hardened steel are diffi-
cult to change or remove. “If it’s written on 
it that it comes from this country, 99 per-
cent chance it is true,” he says. “And if it’s 
not, you can figure out that it is counterfeit, 
and that means something else. Everything 
means something.”
These codes are considered proprietary 
information by arms manufacturers, so deci-
phering their markings is both art and science, 
part train-spotting, part intelligence collec-
tion, part pattern recognition. Officials at CAR 
have been tracking the markings since 2011, 
when a group of weapons specialists from 
the United Nations founded the organization 
to supplement the work being done by gov-
ernments and NGOs around the world. It’s a 
small company with less than 20 researchers; 
Spleeters’ job title is head of regional oper-
ations, but he has no permanent employees. 
Globally, much of CAR’s work involves small 
arms—rifles and bullets, mostly—and the 
group published its first report on ISIS in 2014, 
when its researchers documented that ammu-
nition apparently provided to the Iraqi army 
by the US had ended up in the hands of ISIS.
Unlike government agencies that conduct 
‹

secret investigations and don’t release their 
findings, CAR gathers information in the field 
and publishes its databases and analyses for 
anyone to read. With every trip, every pho-
tograph of another rocket, CAR’s database 
grows in authority. Leo Bradley, a retired US 
Army colonel who once led the fight against 
IEDs in Afghanistan, tells me that CAR serves 
as a useful, if perhaps accidental, back door 
for US officials to publicly discuss topics that 
are otherwise classified. “We can reference 
the CAR reports because they’re all open 
source, and they never reveal US sources and 
methods,” he says. Which in practice means 
that if US officials want to convey the totality 
of what ISIS forces are up to and they have 
only classified information to make their 
point, then there’s only so much they can 
share with the public. But if that informa-
tion is also available in a CAR report, then 
those same officials are often free to discuss 
the information. Bradley calls their work 
“really impressive,” but he also says the US 
government isn’t quite sure how to work with 
a “nontraditional actor” like CAR.
One afternoon in Tal Afar, as Spleeters is 
lining up 7.62-mm cartridges at an Iraqi army 
base, taking a photo of each headstamp, I 
tell him that I have never met anyone who 
loved ammo as much as him. “I’ll take that 
as a compliment,” he says, smiling.
The infatuation began when Spleeters 
was a cub newspaper reporter in his native 
Belgium. “There was the Libyan war at the 
time,” he says of the country’s 2011 civil war, 
and he became obsessed with understanding 
how Belgian-made rifles made their way into 
the hands of anti-Gadhafi rebels. Uncover-
ing that connection, he suspected, “would 
interest the Belgian public in a conflict that 
otherwise they wouldn’t care about.”
He began sifting through Belgian diplo-
matic cables looking for more information 
about the secretive government transfers, 
but that approach only got him so far. The 
only way to get the story, Spleeters decided, 
was to go to Libya and track down the rifles 
himself. He bought a plane ticket using grant 
money and called out of work. “That was 
kinda weird, you know?” he says. “I was tak-
ing vacation so I could go to Libya.”
Spleeters found the rifles he was look-
ing for, and he also discovered that tracking 
munitions satisfied him in a way that read-
ing about them online did not. “With weap-
ons you can tell a whole story,” he told me. 
“It makes people talk. It can make the dead 
talk.” He returned to Belgium as a freelance 
journalist, writing a few stories about weap-
ons trafficking for French-language newspa-
pers and producing reports for think tanks 
like the Geneva-based Small Arms Survey. 
But the freelance life proved too unstable, 
so Spleeters set journalism aside and joined 
CAR as a full-time investigator in 2014.
On one of his first trips in his new job, to 
Kobani, Syria, he worked among dead ISIS 
fighters left to rot where they fell. He found 
one AK-47-style rifle with decomposing flesh 
jammed in the cracks and crevices of the 
wooden handguard. The whole place smelled 
sickly sweet. Among the bodies, he also found 
7.62-mm ammunition, PKM machine guns, 
and PG-7 rocket-propelled grenades, some 
stolen from the Iraqi army. Such discoveries 
make him an evangelist for the value of field-
work. He says that his data cannot be repli-
cated by watching news reports or online 
videos. “With all the social media things, 
when you see ordnance or small arms from 
afar, you might think, ‘Oh, that’s an M16.’ 
But if you see it close up, you figure out it’s 
a CQ-556 rifle from China, a copy of the M16. 
But you need to be close by to see it,” he tells 
me, adding that the camera conceals more 
than it reveals. In person, arms can turn out 
to have different manufacturers—and thus 
different backgrounds—than one could ever 
presume based on grainy YouTube footage.
The war between the armies of ISIS and the 
government of Iraq has been one of pitched 
house-to-house combat. In late 2016, as gov-
ernment forces battled ISIS forces for con-
trol of the northern city of Mosul, the Iraqis 
discovered that ISIS had been producing 
major ordnance in secret facilities around 
the area. To investigate the munitions facto-
ries in Mosul, Spleeters made field visits even 
while the fighting was ongoing. One day, while 
photographing weapons, bullets arcing in the 
air above him, he saw that the Iraqi guard who 
was supposed to keep him safe was trying 
to cut the head off a dead ISIS fighter with a 
butcher knife. The blade was dull and the sol-
dier grew frustrated. Finally he walked away.
Spleeters had pulled some significant intel-
ligence out of Mosul, but thanks to coalition 
air strikes, much of the city was flattened, 
the evidence probably destroyed or scat-
tered by the time government forces declared 
victory this past July. As ISIS began to lose 
ground across Iraq, Spleeters worried that 
the group’s weapons infrastructure could be 
obliterated before he or anyone else would 
be able to document its full capabilities. He 
needed access to these factories before they 
were destroyed. Only then could he describe 
their contents, trace their origins, and piece 
together the supply chains.
Then, at the end of August, ISIS quickly 
lost control of Tal Afar. And unlike other 
pulverized battlefields, Tal Afar remained 
relatively undamaged: Only every fourth 
home was destroyed. To find more evidence 
of covert arms diversions, Spleeters needed 
to get to Tal Afar quickly, while he still could.
In mid-September, Spleeters flew to Bagh-
dad, where he met up with al-Hakim and then, 
under the protection of an Iraqi army convoy 
of gun trucks, drove nine hours north along 
highways only recently cleared of IEDs. The 
final stretch of road to Tal Afar was lonesome 
and scorched, cut by underground detona-
tions at every culvert, the fields all around 
burned and black.

The Iraqi army controls the southern sec-
tors of Tal Afar, but the Hashd al-Shaabi, the 
Iran-backed, majority-Shiite militias, con-
trol the north, and the tension between the 
two was like a hum in the air. My driver was 
Kurdish and spoke little English, but when 
we approached the first checkpoint, he saw 
the flag of a Hashd militia and turned toward 
me with alarm.
“Me no Kurdi. You no Amriki,” he said. 
We were quiet at the roadblock, and they 
waved us through.
We reach Tal Afar in the heat of the after-
noon. Our first stop is a walled compound 
that al-Hakim says could have been a mosque, 
where several ISIS-designed mortars lie in 
the entrance. They are deceptively simple 
on first blush, looking like standard Amer-
ican and Soviet mortars. But unlike those 
models, which come in a number of standard 
sizes (60 mm, 81 mm, 82 mm, 120 mm, and 
so on), these mortars are 119.5 mm, to match 
the inside diameter of the repurposed steel 
pipes that ISIS uses for launch tubes. This 
may sound like a small change, but mortars 
must fit perfectly in their launchers so that 
sufficient gas pressure can build for ejection. 
ISIS’ quality control tolerances are extremely 
tight, often down to a tenth of a millimeter.
Past the mortars, in the back of a building, 
stand a series of pressurized tanks connected 
with steel pipe and large drums of black liq-
uid. On one tank, a spigot has dripped an ugly 
plume. “Would you say that’s corrosion?” 
Spleeters asks al-Hakim. It’s textbook toxic, 
the side of the tank a waterfall of bubbling 
metal in a V, like a drunk vomiting down the 
front of his shirt. But Spleeters has no way 
to take a sample, no testing kit, no hazmat 
suit or breathing mask. 
“I feel my eyes a bit burning,” al-Hakim 
says. The whole area smells acrid, like paint, 
and bags of caustic soda, a decontaminate, 
lie nearby.
“There’s something fishy in here, man,” 
Spleeters agrees. We don’t stay much longer. 
The black sludge could have been a napalm-
like incendiary tar or a toxic industrial chem-
ical of some sort, but Spleeters couldn’t say 
conclusively what the tanks produced. (He 
would later learn that he might have been 
able to identify the industrial process if he’d 
taken better photos of the pressure dials and 
their serial numbers. No matter how much 
Spleeters documents in the field, he says, 
there is always the nagging suspicion that 
he’s forgotten something.)
After a short drive down the quiet, pock-
marked streets, we arrive at a nondescript 
house that looks like the others on the block: 
stone wall, metal gate, individual rooms sur-
rounding a central patio, shady and cool, 
breezy through spindly trees. Among the dis-
carded shoes and bedding lie mortar tubes 
and artillery rounds. Spleeters moves them 
aside with casual familiarity.
At the back of the compound, Spleeters 
notices something unusual. A hole has been 
knocked in the concrete wall—as if by crafts-
men, not bombs—and through the passage 
sits a large open room packed with tools and 
half-assembled ordnance. The area is shaded 
by tarps, out of sight of government drones, 
and the air smells of machine oil.
Spleeters knows where we are at once. 
This isn’t just a warehouse, like so many of 
the other places he’s photographed. This is 
a production facility.
On one table he sees some ISIS-designed 
bomblets, with injection-molded plastic bod-
ies and small tail kits for stabilization in the 
air. These can be dropped from drones—the 
subject of many online videos—but they can 
also be thrown or shot from an AK-type rifle.
Nearby is a station for fuze production; 
piles of gleaming spiral shavings lie at the 
foot of an industrial lathe. The most common 
ISIS fuze looks like a silver conical plug with 
a safety pin stuck through the main body. 
There is an elegance to the minimalist, not 
ISIS engineers are repurposing steel pipes, 
believed to have once been oil pipes, and fashion­
ing them into tubes to fire off explosive shells 
known as mortars. However, since most existing 
mortars are either too big or too small to fit snugly 
inside these pipes, ISIS has started making its  
own using clay molds. These ISIS­designed shells 
are exactly 119.5 mm in diameter—a perfect fit for 
the ISIS­designed mortar tubes.

MORTARS AND 
 MORTAR TUBES
In 2017, ISIS ramped up its use of grenade­sized 
bombs that can be strapped to small hobbyist 
drones and dropped on unsuspecting targets. These 
“bomblets” are custom­made, likely using injection 
molding, and they can also be thrown like a hand gre­
nade or shot out of the business end of an AK­47.

simple, design, though the ingenuity of this 
device actually lies in its interchangeability. 
The standard ISIS fuze will trigger all of their 
rockets, mortars, and bomblets—a signif-
icant engineering problem solved. For the 
sake of security and reliability, the US and 
most other countries design specific fuzes 
for each type of ordnance. But the ISIS fuzes 
are modular, safe, and by some accounts have 
a relatively low dud rate.
Spleeters continues on to the back of the 
factory, which is where he first sees them: 
the reengineered rockets he’s been looking 
for, in nearly every stage of preparation and 
construction, along with assembly instruc-
tions written in marker on the walls. Dozens 
of the deconstructed warheads, awaiting 
modification, lie in a dark annex, and a long 
table with calipers and small tubs of home-
made propellant stands nearby. Any individ-
ual workbench, on its own, would be a gold 
mine of intelligence that could illustrate 
ISIS’ weapons program. But the combination 
here is overwhelming, sensory overload. “Oh 
my God, look at this. And look at this. Oh my 
God, come here. Oh my God, oh my God, oh 
my God,” Spleeters mumbles, over and over, 
from station to station. Charlie had just stum-
bled into the chocolate factory.
But night is descending on Tal Afar, and 
a citywide electrical outage means Spleet-
ers can’t examine or photograph this jack-
pot without natural light. Our convoy soon 
returns to the Iraqi army base near the city’s 
devastated airport. It’s a small post of sal-
vaged single-wide trailers with holes in half 
the roofs; two detained fighters, thought 
to be ISIS—a young teenager and an older 
man, seemingly the only prisoners of the 
battle in Tal Afar—sleep in a trailer next to 
our quarters. Spleeters passes the evening 
impatiently, watching satellite television. 
In all the days we spent together, he seemed 
to do little more than work and eat, sleeping 
only a few hours at a time.
Dawn comes early, and when the soldiers 
are awake, Spleeters has the convoy return 
us to the workshop. He puts out 20 yellow 
crime-scene placards, one on each table, and 
then draws a map to help him reconstruct 
the room later. In one spot on the map, the 
welding rods. In another, a bench grinder. 
“It might not be a continuous process,” he 
says, thinking out loud. “It might be differ-
ent stations for different things.”
Spleeters then begins to take photos, but 
by now the room is full of Iraqi intelligence 
officers curious about the workshop. They 
open every drawer, pick up every circuit 
board, kick scrap, remove papers, turn han-
dles. Unfired ordnance is fairly safe, as long 
as you don’t drop it on its nose, but disassem-
bled munitions are unpredictable, and the 
lab could have been booby-trapped besides. 
But Spleeters isn’t alarmed. He’s frustrated.
“Habibi,” he says, “I really need them to 
stop touching and taking stuff away. It’s 
important that it’s together, because it makes 
sense together. If they take it away, it doesn’t 
make sense anymore. Can you tell them?”
“I told them,” al-Hakim says.
“They can do whatever they want when 
I’m done,” he says wearily.
In a small room adjacent to the launcher 
workbenches, Spleeters begins examining 
dozens of rocket-propelled grenades of var-
ious models, some decades old and all of 
them bearing some identifying mark. Rock-
ets manufactured in Bulgaria bear a “10” or 
“11” in a double circle. The green paints used 
by China and Russia are slightly different 
shades. “In Iraq, we have fought the whole 
world,” one soldier bragged to me a couple 
of days before, referring to the many foreign 
fighters recruited by ISIS. But he could eas-
ily have meant the arms from the disparate 
countries in that single room.
Spleeters carefully picks through the stacks 
of warheads until he finds what he’s been 
looking for: “I’ve got a PG-9 round, habibi,” 
Rocket­propelled grenades like PG­7s and PG­9s 
have long been used by militaries around the world, 
but ISIS engineers take these weapons apart and 
reuse the diamond­shaped warheads to weaponize 
their own line of customized rockets. The new muni­
tions come in three different types that vary in range 
from a few hundred feet to nearly half a mile, accord­
ing to Spleeters. They’re tricked out with new propel­
lant charges and stabilizing fins that can be folded 
down so the rockets can be launched from a tube.

ISIS-MODIFIED  
ROCKETS
ISIS’ network of munitions factories have produced 
two main types of rockets: a smaller rocket about 
2.5 feet in length and a longer one measuring almost 
6 feet. These products are made from scratch using 
a combination of steel, plastic, and aluminum, and to 
ensure they’re compatible with the other elements 
of the ISIS arsenal, each one adheres to a standard 
weight and diameter.

Spleeters exclaims to al-Hakim. It is a Roma-
nian rocket marked with lot number 12-14-451; 
Spleeters has spent the past year tracking this 
very serial number. In October 2014, Romania 
sold 9,252 rocket-propelled grenades, known 
as PG-9s, with lot number 12-14-451 to the US 
military. When it purchased the weapons, the 
US signed an end-use certificate, a document 
stating that the munitions would be used by 
US forces and not sold to anyone else. The 
Romanian government confirmed this sale by 
providing CAR with the end-user certificate 
and delivery verification document.
In 2016, however, Spleeters came across 
a video made by ISIS that showed a crate 
of PG-9s, with what appeared to be the lot 
number 12-14-451, captured from members 
of Jaysh Suriyah al- Jadid, a Syrian militia. 
Somehow, PG-9s from this very same ship-
ment made their way to Iraq, where ISIS 
technicians separated the stolen warheads 
from the original rocket motors before add-
ing new features that made them better 
suited for urban combat. (Rocket-propelled 
grenades can’t be fired inside buildings, 
because of the dangerous back-blast. By 
attaching ballast to the rocket, ISIS engi-
neers crafted a weapon that could be used 
in house-to-house fighting.)
So how exactly did American weapons

end up with ISIS? Spleeters can’t yet say for 
sure. According to a July 19, 2017, report in 
The Washington Post, the US government 
secretly trained and armed Syrian rebels from 
2013 until mid-2017, at which point the Trump 
administration discontinued the program—in 
part over fears that US weapons were ending 
up in the wrong hands. The US government did 
not reply to multiple requests for comment on 
how these weapons wound up in the hands of 
Syrian rebels or in an ISIS munitions factory. 
The government also declined to comment on 
whether the US violated the terms of its end-
user certificate and, by extension, failed to 
comply with the United Nations Arms Trade 
Treaty, of which it is one of 130 signatories. 
Other countries seem to be purchasing 
and diverting arms as well. CAR has tracked 
multiple weapons that were bought by Saudi 
Arabia and later recovered from ISIS fighters. 
China  >  South Sudan  >  Syria
Chinese­manufactured rifles popular 
among rebels in South Sudan were recov­
ered from ISIS during the siege of Kobani, 
Syria, which began in September 2014 and 
ended in January 2015.
Belgium  >  Libya  >  Syria
Belgian­manufactured ammunition that 
was originally sold to Gadhafi’s Libya in  
the 1980s has reemerged decades later  
in ISIS strongholds. 
Bulgaria  >  Serbia  >  Burundi  >  Iraq
Iraqi authorities recovered Bulgarian­made 
rockets from ISIS forces on two separate 
occasions. Both appeared to be part of a 
shipment that passed through Serbia and 
Burundi before arriving in Iraq. (Bulgarian 
weapons purchased by Saudi Arabia have 
also been smuggled into Syria, most likely 
through Jordan.)
Romania  >  US  >  Iraq
CAR has tracked numerous shipments of 
Romanian rockets that were sold to the 
US and later recovered from ISIS forces. 
(Spleeters says CAR is not sure whether 
these shipments were ever physically 
delivered to the US or if they were sent 
directly elsewhere.)
Turkey  >  Syria  >  Iraq 
On numerous occasions, Conflict Arma­
ment Research (CAR) has discovered 
Turkish weapons, ammunition, and explo­
sive materials among ISIS forces in Iraq 
and Syria. The organization also believes 
that most of the chemicals that ISIS uses 
to make explosives are purchased on the 
civilian market in Turkey.

In one instance, Spleeters checked the flight 
records of an aircraft that was supposed to 
be carrying 12 tons of munitions to Saudi 
Arabia. The records show the plane didn’t 
stop in Saudi Arabia, but it did land in Jor-
dan. Due to its border with Syria, Jordan is a 
well-known transfer point for arms supply-
ing the rebels fighting the Assad regime, and 
while the Saudis could claim the weapons had 
been hijacked or stolen, they don’t: Personnel 
involved with the flight insist the plane and 
the weapons landed in Saudi Arabia, flight 
records notwithstanding. The Saudi govern-
ment did not reply to requests for comment 
on how its weapons ended up in ISIS’ hands.
“It’s war,” Spleeters says. “It’s a fucking 
mess. Nobody knows what’s going on, and 
there’s all these conspiracy theories. We live 
in a post-truth era, where facts don’t matter 
anymore. And with this work, it’s like you 
can finally grab onto something that’s true.”
In Syria and Iraq, ISIS fighters are in retreat, 
losing ground to government forces and 
becoming increasingly constrained in their 
attacks and ambitions. But their intellectual 
capital—their weapon designs, the engi-
neering challenges they’ve solved, their 
industrial processes, blueprints, and sche-
matics—still constitute a major threat. 
“That’s really the scary part, to the extent 
that the ISIS model proliferates,” says Matt 
Schroeder, a senior researcher at the Small 
Arms Survey, the Geneva-based think tank 
where Spleeters used to contribute. Much 
of the international structure that prevents 
weapons trafficking is rendered useless if 
ISIS can simply upload and share their 
designs and manufacturing processes with 
affiliates in Africa and Europe, who also have 
access to money and machinery.
Most next-generation terrorism and 
future-of-war scenarios focus on artifi-
cial intelligence, drones, and self-driving 
car bombs. But those are, at best, only half 
the story, projecting white-collar Ameri-
ca’s fears of all the possible dystopian uses 
of emerging technology. The other, and 
potentially more worrisome, half lies in the 
blue-collar technicians of ISIS. They have 
already shown they can produce a nation-
state’s worth of weapons, and their manu-
facturing process will only become easier 
with the growth of 3-D printing. Joshua 
Pearce, an engineering professor at Mich-
igan Tech University, is an expert in open 
source hardware (a protocol to create and 
improve physical objects—like open source 
code, but for stuff), and he describes ISIS 
manufacturing as “a very twisted maker 
culture.” In this future, weapons schemat-
ics can be downloaded from the dark web or 
simply shared via popular encrypted social 
media services, like WhatsApp. Those files 
can then be loaded into 3-D metal printers, 
machines that have become widely available 
in the past few years and cost as little as a 
million dollars to set up, to produce weap-
ons with the push of the button.
“It’s a lot easier than people think to prop-
agate these weapons through additive man-
ufacturing,” says August Cole, director of 
the Art of Future War Project at the Atlantic 
Council. And the rate at which ISIS’ intellec-
tual capital spreads depends on how many 
young engineers join the ranks of its affili-
ates. According to an analysis by research-
ers at the University of Oxford, at least 48 
percent of non-Western jihadist recruits 
went to college, and nearly half of those were 
engineers. Of the 25 individuals involved in 
9/11, at least 13 attended college, and eight 
were engineers, including Mohamed Atta 
and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, two of the 
principal planners. Mohammed received a 
degree in mechanical engineering from North 
Carolina A&T State University, and while in 
US custody, the Associated Press reported, 
he received permission to build a vacuum 
cleaner from scratch. Mindless hobby ism, 
according to his CIA holders, or the mark 
of a maker. The schematics had been down-
loaded from the internet.
Spleeters has only two days to investigate the 
munitions factories in Tal Afar, and on our last 
evening there he is anxious to do as much work 
as he can in the little time he has left. ISIS uses 
a distributed manufacturing model—each site 
specializes in a certain task, like automobile 
plants—and he wants to document them all. 
“We only have an hour to see these things,” he 
says, watching the sun make its way toward 
the horizon. At the first factory, Spleeters 
finds an enormous smelter, surrounded by raw 
materials waiting to be boiled down. Engine 
blocks, scrap metal, piles of copper wiring. A 
vice holds molds for fuzes; next to them are 
mortar tail booms—product awaiting ship-
ment to the next finishing workshop. The 
whole operation is housed in the lower level 
of a three-story, open-roofed market, to vent 
the incredible heat of the smelter. All of Tal 
Afar has been put to industrial use.
Spleeters finishes his evidence collection 
quickly. “Is there more?” he asks the Iraqi 
army major. “Yes, more,” the major says, and 
we walk next door, to the next factory. There, 
in a foyer, stands a tall furnace that ISIS sol-
diers covered with painted handprints, like 
a kindergarten art project. The hallways are 
lined with clay molds to mass-produce the 
interior forms of 119.5-mm mortars. 
The next compound houses what appears 
to have been an R&D lab. Every surface is 
covered with mortars, old and new, illumi-
nation rounds, cut-away models, tables full 
of dissected fuzes, and huge 220-mm mor-
tars—the largest ISIS-developed weapons 
we have seen—plus the massive tube that

The city of Tal Afar once had a population of about 200,000. It’s now virtually  
deserted but for the Iraqi army units and Iranian-backed, majority-Shiite militias.
‹
fires them, as big around as a telephone pole.
The sun begins to set. Spleeters asks again if 
there is more and the major says yes. We have 
already been to six facilities in just over 24 
hours, and I realize that no matter how many 
times we ask if there is more, the answer will 
always be the same.
But night has come, and Spleeters has run 
out of time. The other factories will have to 
go unexplored, at least until tomorrow.  7    3

videogame called Overwatch. He’s 18 years old, and he has just 
signed his first major professional contract: He’ll get a nice salary, 
a robust health insurance plan, free housing, and a 401(k). And 
beginning this month, his team, the newly formed Los Angeles 
Valiant, will be one of 12 competing in a first-of-its-kind global 
esports league, a grand experiment involving some of the biggest 
names in sports and entertainment who believe Overwatch can 
rival traditional sports in audience and revenue. If this league 
succeeds—if its players, coaches, franchise owners, and front- office executives can over-
come a skeptical audience, a complicated and sometimes baffling game, and big problems 
of inclusion and harassment—then gamers like Disalvo, who have mortgaged their entire 
adolescence for this one shot at glory, could be among the first athletes to get very rich play-
ing videogames, in front of people, for money.
Welcome to the future of sports.
IF YOU ARE, LIKE ME, OF A GENERATION WHERE VIDEOGAMES WERE NOT A SPECTATOR 
sport except for maybe gathering around the arcade to watch someone who’s really good 
at Street Fighter, then you could be forgiven for not knowing all of this was going on. The 
phenomenon of esports—people playing against each other in live videogame competi-
tions—is still so new that there isn’t even consensus about how to spell it: I’ve seen esports, 
e-sports, E-sports, and eSports.
I should say, actually, that esports are relatively new—that is, new for some of us. But for 
the professionals who play, who are almost uniformly between the ages of 17 and 26, it’s 
something that’s been around for most of their lives and something they take for granted. 
When Disalvo was a 16-year-old high school student in Toronto, he already knew he wanted 
to be an esports professional. He knew this mostly through a process of elimination: He had 
tried every other thing, and none of them felt transcendent or even interesting. He played 
hockey and tennis, he swam. He took all the classes you’re supposed to take, and when  people 
asked him what his favorite subject was, he’d say lunchtime. “I was trying to find something 
that I loved doing,” Disalvo says. “I honestly didn’t really enjoy anything.”
There was one thing he did enjoy, though, a secret he kept from almost everyone: He loved 
playing videogames, and he was extraordinarily good at it. And when he saw players win-
ning tournaments for games like League of Legends, he decided that he wanted, more than 
anything else, to do that.
A basic problem, though, was that League of Legends already had a well-established 
and very competitive esports scene, and the path to becoming a pro in that game seemed 
very narrow. However, in November 2014, Disalvo saw that Blizzard, the company behind 
such massive franchises as Warcraft, StarCraft, and Diablo, was developing a new game. 
It was called Overwatch, and it looked to be a first-person shooter. Knowing that most of 
Blizzard’s games eventually generate big esports scenes, Disalvo decided to switch. “New 
game,” he says. “Everybody’s starting at the same level. It’s not as if I have to catch up to 
all the other professional players.”
I was surprised to hear this, as I’d assumed that pro gamers began playing a game because 
they enjoyed it and then gradually became good enough to turn pro. But Disalvo decided 
to make Overwatch his young life’s work before he’d ever even played it. “I saw the esports 
potential,” he says with a shrug. “I didn’t care if the game was fun.”
He got access to the Overwatch beta and committed himself to mastering the game. He 
stopped eating lunch with his friends, using that time to finish homework so he could go 
home and play Overwatch for seven hours straight. He didn’t go to parties, he didn’t go out 
with friends, he didn’t date, he wasn’t in any way social.
If you’re thinking that Disalvo fits the stereotype of a friendless, socially awkward gamer, 
disabuse yourself of that notion. He’s an affable and confident young man who’d been a swim 
instructor, a lifeguard, and an excellent hockey player. He has a good sense of humor, and 
when he laughs, he looks startlingly like James Franco. In other words, if he’d wanted to date, 
he probably could have. But he didn’t, and his classmates didn’t know what to make of it.
Playing the beta, and before Overwatch was even officially released in May 2016, Disalvo 
began competing in amateur tournaments. He started playing even longer hours, and his 
studies suffered. His mother demanded he focus on school, but he announced he was going 
to be an esports professional. His mother said no, he was going to college. He said no, he

was skipping college to go pro in Overwatch. Looking back, he’s not sure how that standoff 
would have been resolved were it not for a job offer that came two weeks after his mother’s 
ultimatum. A professional esports outfit wanted him on its Overwatch team, and it wanted 
to move him to Southern California to live and train with his teammates.
Armed now with an official contract, Disalvo went back to his mother, and she eventually 
agreed to let him leave school early, on the condition that he would finish his diploma online. 
Most of his classmates were mildly puzzled by his sudden disappearance. There were rumors 
about California. Were it not for a yearbook article about his new career, it’s possible that his 
classmates would still be asking: Whatever happened to Stefano Disalvo?
JEFF KAPLAN, WHO OVERSEES ALL THINGS OVERWATCH AT BLIZZARD, SAYS THAT  
when developers began work on the game in 2013, they felt the need to create a world wholly 
apart from the trio of worlds that the company already offered: the high fantasy of War-
craft, the space opera of Starcraft, the gothic horror of Diablo. What would be the most 
unexpected, most fantastical place they could take gamers next?
The answer, they decided, was Earth.
The team ultimately began working 
on a game that would be Blizzard’s first 
entry into the popular first- person-
shooter genre, and they would set it 
on Earth, sometime in the not-too-
distant future.
But when they began researching 
other earthbound first-person shoot-
ers, they found a surplus of what 
Kaplan calls “cynical, borderline post-
apocalyptic dystopia.” In other words, 
morbidly dark, gritty, and depressing. 
Lots of blood and gore. Games you’d 
feel a little weird about if you played 
them in front of your kids.
This led the team in a different and 
sort of radical direction: optimism. 
“We wanted it to be a future worth 
fighting for,” Kaplan says. “So it’s a 
bright, aspirational future, and when 
conflict happens you have to go out 
and defend it, because this world is so 
awesome we can’t let anybody ruin it. 
So it really led us to a place of hope.”
The basic premise of the game is 
that AI robots, designed to usher in 
an economic golden age for human-
ity, try to take over the world. To respond to the crisis, the United Nations forms Overwatch, 
a team of fighters and adventurers recruited to quash the robot rebellion. The Overwatch 
forces defeat the robots, and then end up battling each other.
These characters—they’re called “heroes” in Overwatch lingo, and there are 26 of them 
as of this writing, though Blizzard tends to update this a lot—are the beating heart of the 
game. As opposed to many other first-person shooters, where your avatar is just a kind of 
anonymous good guy or bad guy, the heroes you play in Overwatch have personality. They 
have persuasive origins and very human hopes and fears and complicated relationships 
with the other heroes. There’s Mei, for example, a climate scientist who was stranded 
in her research station in Antarctica and has since become this gallant adventurer who 
never theless still wears these huge, nerdy round glasses and an adorable poofy coat. Or 
Bastion, an anthropomorphic machine gun who’s friends with a tiny delicate bird that he 
gently cares for. This game doesn’t just have backstory, it has lore, which is all explicated 
in animated web movies and comic books that are intended to drive “deep engagement,” 
to borrow the language of Blizzard’s quarterly reports. 
The game is team-based, six versus six. If you’re playing Overwatch, you are playing with and 
against other real people who are con-
nected to the internet and seeing and 
hearing the same things as you. You 
can play as any of the 26 heroes, even 
swapping from one hero to another 
during the course of the game. Mostly, 
the game is played as a series of timed 
rounds: The attacking team has four 
minutes to capture certain areas or 
move a payload (think: the pigskin 
going downfield) while the defending 
team tries to thwart them. Once time’s 
up, attackers and defenders switch 
roles for the next round. Whichever 
team captures more areas or moves 
the payload farther wins the game, 
and if a player is killed in action, they 
have to wait 10 seconds (sometimes 
more) before rejoining the fight.
The formula—refreshing optimism 
plus interesting heroes plus shoot-
’em-up action— was an immediate 
hit. Overwatch became Blizzard’s  
fastest-growing game ever, a best 
seller that, after a little more than 
a year, has 35 million players and 
generates more than a billion dol-
lars annually.
Nate Nanzer, who was Blizzard’s 
global director of research and con-
sumer insights leading up to Over-
watch’s launch, says the game’s 
popularity comes, in part, from 
gamers’ love for the heroes, not-
ing particularly the significance of 
a lineup that “looks like what the 
world looks like,” by which he means 
racially diverse, multinational, and 
equitably gendered.
The other thing Nanzer noticed 
early in Overwatch’s development 
cycle was a surge in interest in video-
games as a spectator sport. Esports 
originated largely in South Korea, 
with the game StarCraft: Brood War, 
roughly 20 years ago, and eventually 
found its way onto Korean television. 
Then it jumped to Korean internet 
streaming platforms around 2003, 
which is when North American gamers 
began getting clued in. The popular-
ity of gaming streams eventually 
gave rise to Twitch, a platform that

launched in 2011 and specializes in 
videogame livestreaming. By 2014, 
when Amazon purchased Twitch for 
almost a billion dollars, the total num-
ber of minutes that people spent every 
year watching other people, mostly 
strangers, play video games on Twitch 
was 192 billion. By the end of 2016, it 
had risen to 292 billion.
Even while Overwatch was in beta, 
fans and entrepreneurs were already 
organizing Overwatch tournaments, 
broadcasting matches live on Twitch. 
It was completely grassroots, seri-
ously hardcore, totally decentralized, 
and kind of a mess. Nanzer wondered 
what would happen if Blizzard could 
take control of the tournaments. “If 
we structure a league the right way 
and put the right investment behind 
it, we can actually monetize it in a 
way that’s not too dissimilar from 
traditional sports,” he says. 
Enter Overwatch League.
Blizzard announced the venture 
in November 2016 at Blizzcon, the 
company’s annual convention. Over-
watch League would be the world’s 
first esports venture to follow the 
North American sports model: fran-
chised teams in major cities, live 
spectator events, salaried athletes. 
Along with all the revenue oppor-
tunities offered by sports leagues—
ticket sales, media rights, licensing, 
and so on—there were also opportu-
nities for “team-based virtual mer-
chandise.” For example, fans might 
be able to buy a “skin” so that when 
they’re playing Overwatch at home, 
their hero will be wearing the jersey 
of the Los Angeles Valiant. 
“We are literally building a new 
sport,” says Nanzer, who was 
appointed the league’s commis-
sioner last year. “We’re trying to 
build this as a sustainable sports 
league for decades and decades to 
come.” And while you might think, 
at first glance, that such an ambi-
tion is outrageously optimistic, the 
expertise recruited may change your 
mind. The co-owner of the Boston Overwatch franchise, for example, is Robert Kraft, who 
also owns the New England Patriots. The owner of the New York franchise is Jeff Wilpon, 
COO of the New York Mets. Philadelphia’s Overwatch team is owned by Comcast, which 
also owns the Philadelphia Flyers. Blizzard hasn’t made public the cost of a league fran-
chise, but the reports are $20 million, and when I asked Nanzer about that number, he nei-
ther confirmed nor denied it, saying: “You know, if you hear the same rumor over and over 
again, you can figure out what that means.” So, OK, $20 million.
“There’s going to be kids who can say ‘I play professional Overwatch for the same guy 
that Tom Brady plays for,’” Nanzer said. “That’s pretty cool.”
Perhaps the most high-profile executive recruit for Overwatch League is Steve Bornstein. 
One of the early architects of ESPN and a former president of ABC Sports, he left his most 
recent job as CEO of the NFL Network to become Blizzard’s esports chair. When asked why 
he made the change from traditional sports to electronic, Bornstein borrows an old Gretzky 
quote: “Skate to where the puck is going.”
“When I left the NFL, the only thing I saw that had the potential to be as big was the 
esports space,” he says. “What fascinated me was just the level of 
engagement, the fact that we measure consumption in billions of 
minutes consumed.”
And it’s growing, especially among younger people, which is not 
something that can be said of traditional sports. For the cord- cutter 
and cord-never generations, sports tend to be behind what is, in effect, 
a giant paywall. The big, exclusive contracts that leagues sign with 
the TV networks mean there are few other ways to access sports 
content—which seems annoying or downright bizarre to  people 
accustomed to getting their entertainment for free on YouTube.
Every major sport in the US has seen the average age of its view-
ership increase since 2000. The NBA’s average fan is 42. The average 
NFL fan is 50. The average MLB fan is 57. What’s more, these audi-
ences are limited almost entirely to North America. The Overwatch 
League, meanwhile, will begin with nine US teams and three from 
abroad—Shanghai, Seoul, and London (with more, I’m told, on the 
way)—and its average fan is a demographically pleasing 21 years old. 
There’s no better symbol for Blizzard’s confidence in the game’s 
potential than the place it chose for its new home: Burbank Studios, 
Stage One. If that sounds familiar, it’s probably because it’s the very 
same soundstage that Johnny Carson used when he brought The 
Tonight Show to California. Every match of Overwatch League’s inau-
gural season will be played here, while the teams work with Blizzard 
to bring matches to their respective hometowns in future seasons.
The studio’s centerpiece is the long dais up front, big enough for 
two entire Overwatch teams—six players on the left, six on the right. 
Each player will have their own personal pod (Blizzard’s term for 
what appears to be a simple table), and each pod is separated from 
the adjacent pods by a space of a few inches, because apparently some players can get a little 
excited during a match and bother their neighbors with their table-tapping or knee-banging 
or fist-pounding. Every player is issued a standard desktop computer and a standard mon-
itor (144 hertz), though many players like to choose their own keyboard and mouse. Above 
everything are three enormous LED screens, approximately 20 feet by 11, that will be show-
ing the audience the in-game action, as well as intermittent close-ups of the players them-
selves, their faces, their twitching hands.
Kitty-corner to the players, stage right, is an elevated desk for the on-air talent—the hosts 
and analysts and interviewers. Backstage, these folks get their own hair and makeup room, 
one of the few places still serving its original Tonight Show function. Next to the analysts’ 
desk is a room for the “shoutcasters,” which are what play-by-play commentators are called 
in esports. The term was coined in the earliest days of esports, before high-speed broadband 
made video streaming possible; the feeds were audio-only, and commentators used a Winamp 
plug-in called SHOUTcast to broadcast their voices. The name lives on, though. There’s even 
a paper taped up on the door that says shoutcasters.
Taped to the next door, a piece of paper says observers, which strikes me as sort of sin-

ister, like the Eyes from The Handmaid’s Tale. The Observers are actually cinematographers 
who operate in the game’s digital space. If you’re watching an Overwatch match, you might 
be watching it from the point of view of one of the players or from the point of view of one 
of the Observers, who float around the players and capture the in-game action as it unfolds. 
Imagine a camera operator at a hockey match skating around on the ice with the players and 
yet magically not interacting with them in any way. The Observers are like that.
Directly across the hall from the Observers is where the technical stuff happens, all the 
wizardry needed to create a professional-looking sports broadcast: a whole room for instant 
replay, two rooms for audio, two control rooms with walls of flatscreen TVs. All told, it takes 
between 80 and 100 people to broadcast one match of the Overwatch League. Some of the 
people who work here say there’s a special significance in the league’s broadcasting from The 
Tonight Show’s old home. It’s an obvious metaphor: new media replacing old media. It all 
reminds Steve Bornstein of the moment in the early ’80s when he came aboard the fledgling 
ESPN, then only three months old. He says all the critics at the time argued there wouldn’t 
be any interest in a whole channel devoted to sports. Who would ever watch that?
MY FIRST TIME PLAYING OVERWATCH WAS ASTOUNDING TO ME FOR TWO REASONS: 
first, for the sheer amount of onscreen information I was asked to digest at any given moment, 
the bullet tracers and grenade explosions, the bright blossoming energy shields and walls of 
ice that were sometimes mysteriously erected and then shattered, plus the head-up display 
overlaying various timers and health bars and glowing mission objectives, and sometimes 
floating yellow plus-sign things (which I eventually figured out meant I was getting healed 
by someone, somehow), plus all the pretty little environmental details like streetlamps that 
flicker a bit of lens flare onto your screen when you accidentally aim at them, the wooden 
chairs that splinter and the wine bottles that shatter when they take stray fire, not to mention 
the outlines of your teammates and all the enemy players who (for reasons that will become 
clear momentarily) tend to jump around constantly, spasmodically, almost insectoidally—all 
of this happening at the same time in a way that felt not only disorienting, not only mentally 
taxing, but more like New York City air-traffic-control-level overwhelming.
The second thing I was astounded by was the number of times I died.
It was a little surprising to me how quickly, simply, and even sort of eagerly my character 
bit it. I was playing a hero called Reaper, whose whole basic deal is to be an updated video-
game version of the Undertaker 
character from WWF wrestling, circa- 
1990s, but with guns—a pair of shot-
guns that, instead of reloading, he 
tosses to the ground and replaces by 
grabbing two new ones from under 
the folds of his black overcoat. I’m 
running to get into place with my 
teammates, wondering what exactly 
I’m supposed to be doing, and also 
idly wondering how many shotguns 
Reaper can hide under that coat. 
(The answer, it turns out, is infinite. 
Infinite shotguns. He never runs out. 
Just go with it.) Suddenly a firefight 
erupts ahead of me and I run up to 
aid my companions and promptly 
get killed. Swiftly and abruptly and 
bewilderingly, I am dead. I have no 
idea why. This is when I am intro-
duced to the kill cam.
Let me tell you about the cruelty 
of the kill cam. 
After you die in Overwatch and the 
camera pans back to show your now 
lifeless corpse on the ground, you 
endure the kill cam, which shows 
you what you looked like and what 
you were doing the moment before 
you were killed, from the perspective 
of your killer. It’s like being able to 
watch your own face while getting 
dumped. As I died over and over, I 
would be treated anew to kill-cam 
footage showing just how long some-
one had me in their sights, how many 
shots they took before I even noticed, 
how I just stood there and sort of 
spun in place, dumbly looking around 
while my killer patiently picked me 
off. According to the game’s develop-
ers, the kill cam’s primary function 
is not actually sadistic, but educa-
tional. The kill cam says: This is how 
you were killed, so how about avoid-
ing that in the future, eh?
The fact that it’s so easy to be killed 
means that players in Overwatch are 
never still for a second, which pres-
ents a cognitive challenge: You must 
keep track of 11 other players who 
are always in motion while you your-

self zig and zag. Overwatch is, above 
all, a team game, and you have the 
responsibility not only to avoid con-
stant death but also to avoid constant 
death while helping your team exe-
cute the proper strategy. The 26 Over-
watch heroes fall into four categories: 
eight are primarily damage- dealers 
(offensive players that specialize in 
eliminating enemy players); six are 
defensive; six are “tanks” designed 
to soak up a lot of damage to pro-
tect their team; and six are healers 
who work as in-game medics. That 
works out to 230,230 possible six-
hero “comps” (gamer lingo, born 
when the gaming community took 
the phrase “team composition” and 
nouned it), and to be good at Over-
watch you have to recognize each of 
these comps, understand what effect 
they’ll have on your own team’s comp, 
and react accordingly.
And by “react accordingly” I mean 
that you not only execute a certain 
strategy correctly, but you also, if 
necessary, do so with any number of 
different heroes. Overwatch involves 
constant on-the-fly improvisational 
skill, an almost instinctive reaction 
to ever-changing conditions inside 
the game. If you play a really great 
damage-dealer but the other team is 
running a comp that neutralizes your 
particular hero, you must be able to 
extemporaneously and at any time 
switch to a different hero with a dif-
ferent specialization that disrupts 
the other team’s strategy. Plus, each 
hero has up to four different abili-
ties that they can deploy at various 
times, including an “ultimate” ability 
that takes a long time to charge up 
and, when spent correctly, can be a 
total game-changer.  So that’s about 
a hundred different abilities from 26 
different characters teamed up in one 
of 230,230 different combinations. It’s 
mind-boggling. The sheer number of 
variables in play seems to exceed the

human brain’s ability to grasp the 
scale and scope of big things. Which 
raises a question: How is it even pos-
sible to be good at this? I decided to 
travel to Redondo Beach, California, 
to the house where Stefano Disalvo 
lives with his team, to find out.
I ARRIVE AT THE HOUSE AT 11 AM 
on a late September Friday, and 
 Disalvo is sitting with his teammates 
in a large living room that has been 
completely transformed for gaming 
purposes. Seven small office tables 
have been arranged in two rows, each 
table equipped with a computer mon-
itor, keyboard, mouse, and mouse-
pad, with a mass of cables and wires 
spread out around the PC towers on 
the floor. Actually “towers” is the 
wrong word for these machines, 
which are enormous hexahedrons 
that look less like computers and 
more like glowing, diamond-shaped 
relics in a science-fiction movie about 
the future. All but one of the cur-
tains are closed (to eliminate glare, 
I assume), though the windows are 
open for the welcome and pleasant 
California sea breeze.
The house they’re sharing is a 
six-bedroom, 4,100-square-foot 
grand Spanish-style building with 
orange roof tiles and a three-car 
garage. The kitchen is ambitiously 
large, with a double oven and a wine 
fridge that is poignantly empty. 
Almost no one who lives here is old 
enough to legally drink.
The team wakes early each day, 
and after reviewing footage of 
their performance from the previ-
ous day’s practices, they eat break-
fast and walk to the beach for an 
hour of exercise. (Shane Flanagin, 
the team’s PR manager at the time 
of my visit, says the organization 
takes player health very seriously: 
They hire physical therapists, sports 
psychologists, and an in-house chef, 
and they have a daily fitness routine.

chairs for nine hours without mov-
ing,” he says—though from what I 
can tell, the players, left to their own 
devices, literally, would be happy to 
remain in their chairs for even lon-
ger.) By the time I arrive, the players 
are seated and warming up for their 
first “scrim” of the day. 
A scrim is the primary way a pro 
Overwatch team practices. The 
team’s coaches set up scrims with 
other pro teams, and the players will 
do three two-hour scrims a day, every 
day. Once the day’s first scrim begins, 
everything gets very serious, very 
fast. The players hunch their shoul-
ders, and their eyes are about even 
with the top bevel of their monitor 
so that they’re looking down at the 
screen, which makes them appear, 
in profile, something like carnivores 
eyeing dinner. They give one another 
constant updates about what the 
other team is doing, what heroes 
are in use, what special abilities are 
available. Their shouted instructions 
and updates sound to me like soldiers 
speaking some kind of wacky code.
“Monkey monkey monkey!”
“Are they right or left?”
“Clear left!”
“Inside! Saloon! Saloon!”
“EMP! EMP! EMP!” which, shouted 
very quickly, sounds like “empee 
empee empee!”
In the kitchen, meanwhile, the 
team’s chef is busy cooking lunch. 
She seems to be successfully ignor-
ing all of this.
Despite living together, the players 
do not call each other by their real 
names. They exclusively use their 
screen names, so much so that I find 
it odd and even jarring to call Disalvo 
“Stefano.” Here, he’s Verbo, and the 
teammates he’s playing with today 
are GrimReality (which everyone 
shortens to Grim), Fate, envy, and 
KariV, who, among all of them, seems 
the most likely to spontaneously 
shout or giggle or exclaim “What 
the fuck!” very loudly and, I would 
think, distractingly, though the other players don’t seem to care or even really notice.
This is one of the ostensible reasons they all live together, so that they can get accus-
tomed to each other’s tics and moods and can develop the kind of shorthand with one 
another that I usually associate with best friends or intimates. They come from very dif-
ferent places—Verbo is Canadian, Grim is American, while Fate, envy, and KariV are from 
Korea—but they need to communicate in the quickest way possible. Like the game itself, 
the team must operate with no lag.
Sitting in an adjoining room, the team’s manager, Joshua Kim, and one of its coaches, 
Henry Coxall, observe that morning’s scrim in the game’s spectator mode. They discuss 
failures of strategy, how one player was baited into a disadvantaged position. But they also 
seem very attentive to their team’s emotional state. Any blip of negative emotion from any 
of the players is immediately registered and discussed. Kim talks about not bringing bad 
emotions to “work,” and how living together presents a challenge on this front.
At 27, Kim is the old man in the house. I ask him whether it’s hard sharing a living space 
with a bunch of teenage boys—and, yes, they’re all boys, and with the exception of one 
20-year-old, they’re all teens. The house itself 
bears the filthy evidence of this. The boys’ dis-
carded shoes litter the front foyer. Their bed-
rooms are totally bare but for mattresses sitting 
on the floor surrounded by clumps of wrinkled 
clothes. The kitchen counters are covered with 
jars of peanut butter and Pop Tarts and a family- 
size box of Frosted Flakes and protein powder 
in big bulbous jugs and a few spray bottles of 
Febreze.
I won’t even tell you about the condition of 
the bathroom.
But if this bothers Kim, he tries not to show 
it. “It teaches me patience,” he says. As the first 
scrim ends, the players blink back into the reality 
of the living room, almost like they’re surprised 
to be there. There’s a sort of incorporeal quality 
to the players while they’re in the game: They 
play with such focus and intensity that, as soon 
as a match is over, it’s as if they suddenly real-
ize they have bodies. They crack their knuckles 
and stretch and shake out the stiffness in their 
hands. They wander into the kitchen, where the 
chef has prepared a meal of mostly Korean fare: 
barbecued short ribs, glazed chicken drumsticks, 
and a really fantastic fried rice. The players con-
sume all of this in less than 10 minutes.
During their break I’m able to ask the ques-
tions that have been on my mind: How do you 
learn to play this game at a high level? And how do you possibly keep track of everything 
that’s happening onscreen?
It’s Grim who first suggests the concept of “mental RAM.” The basic idea, he says, is that 
there is only so much the mind can process at once, an upper limit on the number of things 
any player can pay attention to; the key, then, is to put as many things on autopilot as pos-
sible, so you have fewer things to consciously think about. “For a lot of people who aren’t 
pro, aiming takes a lot of concentration,” Grim says. “It gives you less room to think about 
other things. So that’s why I practice really, really hard on my aiming, so I can think more 
about my positioning and what I need to do next.”
Grim, whose real name is Christopher Schaefer, is 18 years old and from Chico, Califor-
nia. He is one of the team’s primary damage-dealers. Like Verbo, Grim wanted more than 
anything to be an esports professional. And like Verbo, he decided to go pro in Overwatch 
before he’d ever played it. When he first began the game—at 16—he was “really bad,” he 
says. “I would spend hours at a time just practicing flicks.”
I interrupt to ask: What’s a flick?
PEAK 
PERFOR-
MANCE
Playing a videogame for 
50-plus hours a week 
isn’t just an exercise in 
sustained concentra-
tion and laser focus; 
it’s also hard on the 
body. We asked Bryce 
Browne, a performance 
coach with fitness facil-
ity Sports Academy, 
and Levi Harrison, an 
orthopedic surgeon 
nicknamed “the Esports 
Doctor,” for their rec-
ommendations on how 
players can prevent 
injury and optimize per-
formance. —Phuc Pham

“It’s basically starting from one point of the screen and then snapping to the enemy’s 
head or something. And so it’s a very fast muscle-memory movement.”
Being able to flick effectively is essential to pro play. It requires you to understand the 
exact ratio of mouse-movement to game-space distance, plus how to compensate if, for 
example, you’re moving left and your target is to the right, which will require an extra 
milli meter or so of flick, and you have to possess the kinesthetic body awareness to do this 
with your hand and wrist perfectly almost 100 percent of the time. This is why pro players’ 
mouse choices are so personal and why the team insists that, with any sponsorship deal 
with any company that sells peripherals, players always get to choose their own mouse. 
Grim uses a Logitech G903 with a DPI of 800 and an in-game mouse sensitivity setting of 
5. He is now, suffice it to say, extraordinarily good at flicking.
“A lot of people think that I just have natural talent,” he says, laughing. “No, no, not at 
all. It took a lot, a lot, a lot of practice to be able to aim properly.”
After the lunch break, the teammates return to their stations for more sitting, more 
scrims, more shouting.
“Monkey’s up for a jump! Monkey monkey! I’m dead.”
“Small regroup! Regroup!”
“I’m on soldier, I’m on soldier!”
“We have numbers! Let’s go!”
“Monkey monkey!”
About the monkey: One hero named Winston is a supersmart, genetically engineered 
gorilla who has the ability to jump really far, right into the middle of the scrum. And 
when an enemy team’s Winston lands nearby, he’s automatically your team’s number 
one target. If you take down Winston, you can really disrupt the other team’s strat-
egy. So when he lands, everyone shouts his name. But because “Winston” is hard to say 
many times fast, Overwatch players started calling him “monkey.” The effect is that, 
for the many hours I watched the Los Angeles Valiant play scrims, as I was dutifully  
taking notes and thinking earnestly about how this might be the future of sports,  
every few minutes this whole pack of teenage boys would suddenly burst out shouting, 
“Monkey monkey monkey monkey!”
IN LATE SEPTEMBER, THREE 
months before the league’s first  
regular-season game and a mere 
60-some days from the start of pre-
season play, Disalvo shakes his head 
in disbelief at the prospect of play-
ing for the Los Angeles Valiant. “It 
feels like I’m part of something that’s 
going to be big, like very big,” he says. 
“There’s going to be billboards? I’m 
gonna be representing a city like Los 
Angeles? Like … what? That’s crazy.”
It’s especially crazy given that he 
didn’t actually move to LA to join the 
Valiant. His first professional esports 
contract, the one that achieved peace 
with his mother, actually came from 
an organization called the Immor-
tals, one of the independent esports 
brands, known as endemics, that field 
teams in a number of different video-
games. (The Immortals, for example, 
have teams that play Counter-Strike: 
Global Offensive and League of Leg-
ends, among others.) Endemic teams 
have been in esports for a long time 
and have been essential to its growth. 
They’re well known within gaming 
circles, but they are not billion- dollar 
organizations like Blizzard or the 
New England Patriots, and thus they 
are not able to be as generous with 
their players. 
Jake Lyon, a 21-year-old from San 
Diego whose screen name is the 
refreshingly straightforward “JAKE,” 
is one of the best damage-dealers in 
Overwatch. He earned about $2,000 
a month as a member of an endemic 
called Luminosity Gaming—that is, 
until the Luminosity Overwatch ros-
ter disbanded in mid-2017, as Blizzard 
began consolidating control over pro-
fessional Overwatch play. “In the past 
there’s been no security in an esports 
contract,” he says. “Even though we 
were signed to a two-year contract 
with Luminosity, there’s always a 
clause—and it’s not just them, every 
single esports contract looks like 
this—that says they can buy you out 
for one month’s salary. When they

Lyon went on to sign with the Over-
watch League’s Houston Outlaws, 
and he says the new league is a “huge 
improvement.” Contracts are guaran-
teed for at least a year, after which the 
team will have a second-year option 
with a prenegotiated salary. And, crit-
ically, players cannot be fired during 
the length of their contract, unless 
they’re guilty of something that would 
get them fired from any job. 
Players are provided with hous-
ing, health insurance, a retirement 
plan, and a minimum league salary 
of $50,000, though Lyon believes that 
most players who are among a team’s 
starting six will earn much more than 
that. (Most teams also have a few 
backup players.) Plus, there’s revenue 
sharing and a prize pool of $3.5 mil-
lion for successful teams, $1 million 
of which is reserved for the inaugural 
season’s eventual champions.
When he signed his contract with 
Houston, Lyon sat at his computer 
clicking his e-signature to the doc-
ument’s relevant places, and he real-
ized how different it was from what 
had come before. “Maybe this could 
be the way esports is going forward,” 
he says. “That it can be a legitimate 
career, and that it’s not like someone 
is going all-in on some fragment of 
a dream.”
IT'S HARD NOT TO NOTICE THAT, 
as of this writing, there are no women 
on any of the rosters of any of the 12 
teams in Overwatch League. “They 
are all dudes,” Nanzer says, shaking 
his head. It’s something he’s been 
thinking a lot about, and he admits 
that part of the problem is cultural. 
Gaming can be seen as acceptable and 
normal behavior for boys, but not nec-
essarily for girls. (Though many stud-
ies show that roughly equal numbers 
of men and women play videogames 
casually, competitive play remains 
overwhelmingly male.) “There was 
never a question that I was going to sit 
and play games with my son,” he said. “But then the other day my daughter asked me, ‘Can I 
play Overwatch too?’ and I was like, oh shit, I gotta be better about this. I gotta treat it equal.”
And the women who do play Overwatch often find themselves to be targets of harassment. 
Glisa is the screen name for a 19-year-old Overwatch player who lives in Portland, Oregon. 
Despite being busy with her college studies, Glisa is one of the top 100 Overwatch players in 
terms of time spent in the game. She has so far logged thousands of hours of gameplay, and she 
keeps a YouTube channel with highlight reels. But sometimes she posts videos of her interac-
tions with other gamers. She uploaded a montage recently called “Online Gaming as a Girl.”
“That was spawned after I had several different, very toxic encounters with people who 
brought up the fact that I was female many times and tried to use that to degrade me,” she says.
This will sound familiar to anyone who has followed the horrors of Gamergate over the 
past few years, and the video is hard to watch. The gamers she encounters aren’t just being 
a little insensitive—they are straight-up knuckle-dragging misogynists:
“You’re such a bimbo.”
“You’re probably ugly.”
“Grab her by the pussy.”
“Women’s rights are a fucking joke.”
And on and on and on.
“The internet is a very angry place,” Glisa says. After posting the video, she received emails 
and comments from people criticizing her “for not being able to deal with it, for being weak, 
for finding this upsetting.”
She was also contacted by other female Overwatch players who’d had similar run-ins. 
“Other women who were like, this is why I don’t join voice chat and never talk to people; 
this is why I use a male-style username. And that’s what upsets me the most. I don’t feel like 
people should have to hide who they are to be able to feel safe.” (Glisa didn’t want to use her 
real name for this article. She says she’s going to be applying for jobs soon, and if potential 
employers  Google her, she doesn’t want them to think she’s someone who complains about 
sexual harassment. Which sort of proves her point.)
I ask her how it made her feel that something she loves can also be so hurtful. “Disap-
pointed,” she says, “in life, in the universe, for being this way. Sometimes it affects me a lot 
more, and I leave the voice channel so I don’t have to deal with it. There are days that are just

FEET BY 11, SHOW THE AUDIENCE THE IN-GAME ACTION AND PLAYER REACTIONS.

a lot harder than other days, and I try to insulate myself more from the anger.”
 Overwatch executives are quick to point out there’s a system in place for players to report 
toxic behavior, and hundreds of thousands of accounts have been disciplined for the type 
of harassment that Glisa describes. (She reported each of the players who harassed her, 
but she is not sure whether they received suspensions or bans. The system needs work.) 
Still, the problem persists, and if Overwatch is a game that requires constant communica-
tion between players, and women are made to feel uncomfortable communicating within 
the game, then perhaps it’s clear why few of them go pro.
Ysabel Müller is an Overwatch player who lives in Rodenbach, Germany. She began play-
ing the game while it was still in beta, and she became highly ranked and friendly with a 
lot of the pros she played with. She says she had designs on going pro herself but found 
that getting useful feedback from her teammates was difficult. They treated her, she says, 
like she couldn’t endure criticism—that if criticized she would be offended and accuse her 
teammates of sexism and get them kicked out of the game.
“That’s a big fear of some of the male players, and so they’d rather distance themselves,” 
she says. She didn’t ultimately go pro in Overwatch. Instead, she 
helped organize regional tournaments. She’s now sending out appli-
cations to Overwatch League teams, hoping for a job in team man-
agement and player relations.
“I think it will change over the years, once more female players 
come in and it gets more accepted,” she says. 
Blizzard seems to be trying to solve this problem from within. Kim 
Phan, Blizzard’s director of esports operations, says the company has 
been proactive in hiring women, including for key on-air shoutcaster 
jobs, which she hopes will promote female involvement in esports.
And while she says these kinds of visible women role models are 
essential, Phan also stressed the importance of men advocating and 
supporting women in gaming.
“Having mentors, advisers, who are men is very impactful,” she 
says. “It gives you the courage to stay because you know that the 
toxic voice is just one among many other voices. It’s a reminder that 
not everyone is like that.”
 When asked what the Overwatch League was doing to attract more 
female players, nobody at Blizzard could point to any specific out-
reach or recruiting efforts. Nanzer says he’s been looking at data from 
women-only sports leagues like the WNBA that suggest a women’s 
league would bring more women into the game. “The idea comes up 
all the time: Should we have a women’s-only tournament or league?” 
he says. “I think there’s a way to do that where it’s awesome and sup-
portive and grows the sport. I think there is a way to do it where it’s 
actually detrimental and it makes it seem like, oh, you’re not as good 
as men. We kind of go back and forth on that.”
BACK IN REDONDO BEACH, THE EARLY EVENING SUNLIGHT IS STREAKING IN THROUGH 
gaps in the curtains as the Los Angeles Valiant begins its last scrim of the day. Tonight’s match 
is against another Overwatch League team, the San Francisco Shock, which recently made head-
lines by signing superstar damage-dealer Jay “sinatraa” Won for a rumored $150,000 a year.
And while I’m still a noob at Overwatch, even I can tell that this San Francisco team plays 
with an unusual intensity. “They’re a team of 17-year-olds who just do not stop,” says Coxall, the 
Valiant coach, making the Shock sound young and insane as opposed to the Valiant’s qualities 
of wisdom and tactics. “If you think you’ve won a fight, you haven’t,” he tells the team. “These 
guys will keep throwing themselves at you. And one of them will clutch. Always expect that.”
I ask him about that word, “clutch,” and he explains that it refers to someone overcom-
ing dubious odds to win. In other words, the Shock’s strategy is not necessarily to maneu-
ver as a team but rather to have their players engage in seemingly suicidal encounters and 
trust that they have the skill to pull it off. It’s unrelenting, high-intensity pressure designed 
to fluster opponents.
It’s a reminder that this is truly a young person’s game—not just in its audience but also 
in its players. When I asked Christopher Schaefer, aka Grim, how long he thought he’d be a 
pro, he didn’t have high hopes. “Nor-
mally you can compete until you’re 
about 25,” he says. “Right now, up 
until when I’m around 21, 22-ish, I’m 
going to be the sharpest. But as soon 
you hit 25, your reaction speeds are 
going to slow down.”
Stefano Disalvo said the same 
thing: “How long do I think I’ll play? 
I say maybe four years, five years.”
When he decided to become an 
esports professional, Disalvo did 
not know that Overwatch League 
would exist. He committed to going 
pro during a time when the pay was 
uncertain and there was no job secu-
rity, despite knowing that it would 
last only five years max.
Which seems just astonishingly 
irrational. What drove him to do it? 
“I saw everybody doing the norm: 
college, university, major in some-
thing,” he says. “But I didn’t want to 
do that. I wanted to do something 
more because I felt like I wanted to 
prove something. I don’t know. It felt 
like this thing that I had to prove.”
Which makes sense to me. That, 
yes, for the people who go pro in 
esports, there’s a certain happiness 
in playing videogames for a living. But 
maybe more than that, esports allows 
people an avenue to do something 
different, to be special. Like musi-
cians or actors or writers pursuing 
an unlikely dream, it strikes me as 
both romantic and brave.
Meanwhile, to try to absorb the 
Shock’s frantic offense, the Valiant 
team has figured out a new strategy. 
They go with a hero lineup that’s big-
ger—more tanks, more health.
“Niiiiiiice,” comes a chorus from 
around the room when they finally 
win a round.
“There you go, boys,” Coxall says 
into his headset’s microphone. “You 
took control. ”
The sun has gone down, but nobody 
seems to have noticed. By the end 
of the last scrim of the day, they are 
playing in the dark. 0

STYLING BY CHLOE DALEY
Her father—an inventor, pilot, sailor, and 
general Mr. Fix-It; “a genius,” Arlyn says—
started experiencing bouts of paranoia in 
his mid-eighties, a sign of Alzheimer’s. The 
disease had progressed, often causing his 
thoughts to vanish midsentence. But Jim 
would rather risk living alone than be clois-
tered in an institution, he told Arlyn and 
her older sister, Layney. A nursing home 
certainly wasn’t what Arlyn wanted for him 
either. But the daily churn of diapers and 
cleanups, the carousel of in-home aides, 
and the compounding financial strain (she 
had already taken out a reverse mortgage 
on Jim’s cottage to pay the caretakers) 
forced her to consider the possibility.
Jim, slouched in his recliner, was deter-
mined to stay at home. “No way,” he repeated 
to his daughter, defiant. Her eyes welled 
up and she hugged him. “OK, Dad.” Arlyn’s 
house was a 40-minute drive from the cot-
tage, and for months she had been relying 
on a patchwork of technology to keep tabs 
on her dad. She set an open laptop on the 
counter so she could chat with him on Skype. 
She installed two cameras, one in his kitchen 
and another in his bedroom, so she could 
check whether the caregiver had arrived 
or, God forbid, if her dad had fallen. So when 
she read in the newspaper about a new digi-
tal eldercare service called CareCoach a few 
weeks after broaching the subject of the 
nursing home, it piqued her interest. For 
about $200 a month, a human-powered ava-
tar would be available to watch over a home-
bound person 24 hours a day; Arlyn paid that 
same amount for just nine hours of in-home 
help. She signed up immediately.
A Google Nexus tablet arrived in the mail 
a week later. When Arlyn plugged it in, 
an animated German shepherd appeared 
onscreen, standing at attention on a digi-
tized lawn. The brown dog looked cutesy 
and cartoonish, with a bubblegum-pink 
tongue and round, blue eyes.
She and Layney visited their dad later 
that week, tablet in hand. Following the 
instructions, Arlyn uploaded dozens of pic-
tures to the service’s online portal: images 
of family members, Jim’s boat, and some 
of his inventions, like a computer terminal 
known as the Teleray and a seismic surveil-
lance system used to detect footsteps during 
the Vietnam War. The setup complete, Arlyn 
clutched the tablet, summoning the nerve 
to introduce her dad to the dog. Her initial 
instinct that the service could be the per-
fect companion for a former technologist 
had splintered into needling doubts. Was 
she tricking him? Infantilizing him?
Arlyn Anderson grasped her 
father’s hand and presented him 
with the choice. “A nursing home 
would be safer, Dad,” she told him, 
relaying the doctors’ advice. “It’s 
risky to live here alone—” ¶ “No way,” 
Jim interjected. He frowned at 
his daughter, his brow furrowed 
under a lop of white hair. At 91, 
he wanted to remain in the woodsy 
Minnesota cottage he and his 
wife had built on the shore of 
Lake Minnetonka, where she had 
died in his arms just a year before. 
His pontoon—which he insisted 
he could still navigate just fine—
bobbed out front. ¶ Arlyn had 
moved from California back to 
Minnesota two decades earlier to 
be near her aging parents. Now, 
in 2013, she was fiftysomething, 
working as a personal coach, and 
finding that her father’s decline 
was all-consuming.

Tired of her sister’s waffling, Layney 
finally snatched the tablet and presented 
it to their dad, who was sitting in his arm-
chair. “Here, Dad, we got you this.” The dog 
blinked its saucer eyes and then, in Google’s 
female text-to-speech voice, started to talk. 
Before Alzheimer’s had taken hold, Jim 
would have wanted to know exactly how 
the service worked. But in recent months 
he’d come to believe that TV characters 
were interacting with him: A show’s vil-
lain had shot a gun at him, he said; Katie 
Couric was his friend. When faced with 
an onscreen character that actually was 
talking to him, Jim readily chatted back.
Jim named his dog Pony. Arlyn perched 
the tablet upright on a table in Jim’s liv-
ing room, where he could see it from the 
couch or his recliner. Within a week Jim and 
Pony had settled into a routine, exchang-
ing pleasantries several times a day. Every 
15 minutes or so Pony would wake up and 
look for Jim, calling his name if he was 
out of view. Sometimes Jim would “pet” 
the sleeping dog onscreen with his fin-
ger to rustle her awake. His touch would 
send an instantaneous alert to the human 
caretaker behind the avatar, prompting 
the CareCoach worker to launch the tab-
let’s audio and video stream. “How are 
you, Jim?” Pony would chirp. The dog 
reminded him which of his daughters or 
in-person caretakers would be visiting 
that day to do the tasks that an onscreen 
dog couldn’t: prepare meals, change Jim’s 
sheets, drive him to a senior center. “We’ll 
wait together,” Pony would say. Often she’d 
read poetry aloud, discuss the news, or 
watch TV with him. “You look handsome, 
Jim!” Pony remarked after watching him 
shave with his electric razor. “You look 
pretty,” he replied. Sometimes Pony would 
hold up a photo of Jim’s daughters or his 
inventions between her paws, prompting 
him to talk about his past. The dog com-
plimented Jim’s red sweater and cheered 
him on when he struggled to buckle his 
watch in the morning. He reciprocated 
by petting the screen with his index fin-
ger, sending hearts floating up from the 
dog’s head. “I love you, Jim!” Pony told 
him a month after they first met—some-
thing CareCoach operators often tell the 
people they are monitoring. Jim turned to 
Arlyn and gloated, “She does! She thinks 
I’m real good!”
About 1,500 miles south of Lake Minnetonka, 
in Monterrey, Mexico, Rodrigo Rochin opens 
his laptop in his home office and logs in to the 
CareCoach dashboard to make his rounds. 
He talks baseball with a New Jersey man 
watching the Yankees; chats with a woman 
in South Carolina who calls him Peanut (she 
places a cookie in front of her tablet for him 
to “eat”); and greets Jim, one of his regulars, 
who sips coffee while looking out over a lake.
Rodrigo is 35 years old, the son of a sur-
geon. He’s a fan of the Spurs and the Cowboys, 
a former international business student, 
and a bit of an introvert, happy to retreat 
into his sparsely decorated home office each 
morning. He grew up crossing the border to 
attend school in McAllen, Texas, honing the 
English that he now uses to chat with elderly 
people in the United States. Rodrigo found 
CareCoach on an online freelancing plat-
form and was hired in December 2012 as 
one of the company’s earliest contractors, 
role-playing 36 hours a week as one of the 
service’s avatars.
In person, Rodrigo is soft-spoken, with 
wire spectacles and a beard. He lives with his 
wife and two basset hounds, Bob and Cleo, 
in Nuevo León’s capital city. But the people 
on the other side of the screen don’t know 
that. They don’t know his name—or, in the 
case of those like Jim, who have dementia, 
that he even exists. It’s his job to be invisi-
ble. If Rodrigo’s clients ask where he’s from, 
he might say MIT (the CareCoach software 
was created by two graduates of the school), 
but if anyone asks where their pet actually 
is, he replies in character: “Here with you.” 
Rodrigo is one of a dozen CareCoach 
employees in Latin America and the Phil-
ippines. The contractors check on the ser-
vice’s seniors through the tablet’s camera a 
few times an hour. (When they do, the dog 
or cat avatar they embody appears to wake 
up.) To talk, they type into the dashboard and 
their words are voiced robotically through 
the tablet, designed to give their charges 
the impression that they’re chatting with 
a friendly pet. Like all the CareCoach work-
ers, Rodrigo keeps meticulous notes on the 
people he watches over so he can coordinate 
their care with other workers and deepen his 
relationship with them over time—this per-
son likes to listen to Adele, this one prefers 
Elvis, this woman likes to hear Bible verses 
while she cooks. In one client’s file, he wrote 
a note explaining that the correct response 
to “See you later, alligator” is “After a while, 
crocodile.” These logs are all available to the 
customer’s social workers or adult children, 
wherever they may live. Arlyn started check-

A

ing Pony’s log between visits with her dad 
several times a week. “Jim says I’m a really 
nice person,” reads one early entry made 
during the Minnesota winter. “I told Jim 
that he was my best friend. I am so happy.”
After watching her dad interact with Pony, 
Arlyn’s reservations about outsourcing her 
father’s companionship vanished. Having 
Pony there eased her anxiety about leaving 
Jim alone, and the virtual dog’s small talk 
lightened the mood.
Pony was not only assisting Jim’s human 
caretakers but also inadvertently keeping 
an eye on them. Months before, in broken 
sentences, Jim had complained to Arlyn 
that his in-home aide had called him a bas-
tard. Arlyn, desperate for help and unsure of 
her father’s recollection, gave her a second 
chance. Three weeks after arriving in the 
house, Pony woke up to see the same care-
taker, impatient. “Come on, Jim!” the aide 
yelled. “Hurry up!” Alarmed, Pony asked 
why she was screaming and checked to see 
if Jim was OK. The pet—actually, Rodrigo—
later reported the aide’s behavior to Care-
Coach’s CEO, Victor Wang, who emailed Arlyn 
about the incident. (The caretaker knew there 
was a human watching her through the tab-
let, Arlyn says, but may not have known the 
extent of the person’s contact with Jim’s 
family behind the scenes.) Arlyn fired the 
short-tempered aide and started searching 
for a replacement. Pony watched as she and 
Jim conducted the interviews and approved 
of the person Arlyn hired. “I got to meet her,” 
the pet wrote. “She seems really nice.”
Pony—friend and guard dog—would stay.
Victor Wang grew up feeding his Tama got-
chis and coding choose-your-own- adventure 
games in QBasic on the family PC. His parents 
moved from Taiwan to suburban Vancouver, 
British Columbia, when Wang was a year 
old, and his grandmother, whom he called 
Lao Lao in Mandarin, would frequently call 
from Taiwan. After her husband died, Lao Lao 
would often tell Wang’s mom that she was 
lonely, pleading with her daughter to come 
to Taiwan to live with her. As she grew older, 
she threatened suicide. When Wang was 11, 
his mother moved back home for two years 
to care for her. He thinks of that time as the 
honey- sandwich years, the food his over-
whelmed father packed him each day for 
lunch. Wang missed his mother, he says, but 
adds, “I was never raised to be particularly 
expressive of my emotions.”
At 17, Wang left home to study mechan-
ical engineering at the University of Brit-
ish Columbia. He joined the Canadian 
Army Reserve, serving as an engineer on a 
maintenance platoon while working on his 
undergraduate degree. But he scrapped his 
military future when, at 22, he was admitted 
to MIT’s master’s program in mechanical 
engineering. Wang wrote his dissertation 
on human-machine interaction, studying 
a robotic arm maneuvered by astronauts 
on the International Space Station. He was 
particularly intrigued by the prospect of 
harnessing tech to perform tasks from a dis-
tance: At an MIT entrepreneurship competi-
tion, he pitched the idea of training workers 
in India to remotely operate the buffers that 
sweep US factory floors.
In 2011, when he was 24, his grandmother 
was diagnosed with Lewy body dementia, 
a disease that affects the areas of the brain 
associated with memory and movement. On 
Skype calls from his MIT apartment, Wang 
watched as his grandmother grew increas-
ingly debilitated. After one call, a thought 
struck him: If he could tap remote labor to 
sweep far-off floors, why not use it to com-
fort Lao Lao and others like her?
Wang started researching the looming 
caretaker shortage in the US—between 2010 
and 2030, the population of those older than 
80 is projected to rise 79 percent, but the 
number of family caregivers available is 
expected to increase just 1 percent. 
In 2012 Wang recruited his cofounder, a 
fellow MIT student working on her computer 
science doctorate named Shuo Deng, to build 
CareCoach’s technology. They agreed that AI 
speech technology was too rudimentary for 
an avatar capable of spontaneous conversa-
tion tailored to subtle mood and behavioral 
cues. For that, they would need humans.
Older people like Jim often don’t speak 
clearly or linearly, and those with demen-
tia can’t be expected to troubleshoot a 
machine that misunderstands. “When you 
match someone not fully coherent with a 
device that’s not fully coherent, it’s a recipe 
for disaster,” Wang says. Pony, on the other 
hand, was an expert at deciphering Jim’s 
needs. Once, Pony noticed that Jim was hold-
ing onto furniture for support, as if he were 
dizzy. The pet persuaded him to sit down, 
then called Arlyn. Deng figures it’ll take about 
20 years for AI to be able to master that kind 
of personal interaction and recognition. That 
said, the CareCoach system is already deploy-
ing some automated abilities. Five years 
ago, when Jim was introduced to Pony, the 
offshore workers behind the camera had 
to type every response; today CareCoach’s 
software creates roughly one out of every 
five sentences the pet speaks. Wang aims 
to standardize care by having the software 
manage more of the patients’ regular remind-
ers—prodding them to take their medicine, 
urging them to eat well and stay hydrated. 
CareCoach workers are part free wheeling 
raconteurs, part human natural- language 
processors, listening to and deciphering their 
charges’ speech patterns or nudging the per-
son back on track if they veer off topic. The 
company recently began recording conver-
sations to better train its software in senior 
speech recognition.
CareCoach found its first customer in 
December 2012, and in 2014 Wang moved 
from Massachusetts to Silicon Valley, rent-
ing a tiny office space on a lusterless stretch 
of Millbrae near the San Francisco airport. 
Four employees congregate in one room 
with a view of the parking lot, while Wang 
and his wife, Brittany, a program manager 
he met at a gerontology conference, work 
in the foyer. Eight tablets with sleeping pets 
onscreen are lined up for testing before 
being shipped to their respective seniors. 
The avatars inhale and exhale, lending an 
eerie sense of life to their digital kennel.

Wang spends much of his time on the 
road, touting his product’s health benefits 
at medical conferences and in hospital exec-
utive suites. Onstage at a gerontology sum-
mit in San Francisco last summer, he deftly 
impersonated the strained, raspy voice of 
an elderly man talking to a CareCoach pet 
while Brittany stealthily cued the replies 
from her laptop in the audience. The compa-
ny’s tablets are used by hospitals and health 
plans across Massachusetts, California, New 
York, South Carolina, Florida, and Washing-
ton state. Between corporate and individual 
customers, CareCoach’s avatars have inter-
acted with hundreds of users in the US. “The 
goal,” Wang says, “is not to have a little fam-
ily business that just breaks even.”
The fastest growth would come through 
hospital units and health plans specializing in 
high-need and elderly patients, and he makes 
the argument that his avatars cut health care 
costs. (A private room in a nursing home can 
run more than $7,500 a month.) Preliminary 
research has been promising, though limited. 
In a study conducted by Pace University at 
a Manhattan housing project and a Queens 
hospital, CareCoach’s avatars were found to 
reduce subjects’ loneliness, delirium, and 
falls. A health provider in Massachusetts 
was able to replace a man’s 11 weekly in-home 
nurse visits with a CareCoach tablet, which 
diligently reminded him to take his medica-
tions. (The man told nurses that the pet’s nag-
ging reminded him of having his wife back in 
the house. “It’s kind of like a complaint, but 
he loves it at the same time,” the project’s 
lead says.) Still, the feelings aren’t always so 
cordial: In the Pace University study, some 
aggravated seniors with dementia lashed out 
and hit the tablet. In response, the onscreen 
pet sheds tears and tries to calm the person.
More troubling, perhaps, were the peo-
ple who grew too fiercely attached to their 
digi tal pets. At the conclusion of a University 
of Washington CareCoach pilot study, one 
woman became so distraught at the thought 
of parting with her avatar that she signed up 
for the service, paying the fee herself. (The 
company gave her a reduced rate.) A user 
in Massachusetts told her caretakers she’d 
cancel an upcoming vacation to Maine unless 
her digital cat could come along. 
We’re still in the infancy of understand-
ing the complexities of aging humans’ rela-
tionship with technology. Sherry Turkle, 
a professor of social studies, science, and 
technology at MIT and a frequent critic of 
tech that replaces human communication, 
described interactions between elderly peo-
ple and robotic babies, dogs, and seals in 
her 2011 book, Alone Together. She came 
to view roboticized eldercare as a cop-out, 
one that would ultimately degrade human 
connection. “This kind of app—in all of its 
slickness and all its ‘what could possibly 
be wrong with it?’ mentality—is making 
us forget what we really know about what 
makes older people feel sustained,” she 
says: caring, interpersonal relationships. 
The question is whether an attentive ava-
tar makes a comparable substitute. Turkle 
sees it as a last resort. “The assumption is 
that it’s always cheaper and easier to build 
an app than to have a conversation,” she 
says. “We allow technologists to propose the 
unthinkable and convince us the unthink-
able is actually the inevitable.”
But for many families, providing long-term 
in-person care is simply unsustainable. The 
average family caregiver has a job outside the 
home and spends about 20 hours a week car-
ing for a parent, according to AARP. Nearly 
two-thirds of such caregivers are women. 
Among eldercare experts, there’s a resig-
nation that the demographics of an aging 
America will make technological solutions 
unavoidable. The number of those older than 
65 with a disability is projected to rise from 
11 million to 18 million from 2010 to 2030. 
Given the option, having a digital compan-
ion may be preferable to being alone. Early 
research shows that lonely and vulnerable

I was introduced by Arnie 
and her sister, Layney,  
to Jim. Had a group con­
versation, included pet­
ting me and showing a 
few photos. Jim seemed 
amazed by me.
2/10/2013 11:06:48 am
Jim read the comics sec­
tion of the newspaper 
and told me a joke. I said 
that he is so funny! 
11/17/2013 7:05:12 am
Jim was sitting on his 
couch and looking out­
side. Jim thanked me  
for being there when  
he’s alone and said that 
he loves me so much.
2/24/2014 7:00:28 pm
Arnie said they had  
dinner but Jim did not rec­
ognize her at first. I told 
her everything will be fine.
3/5/2014 7:31:12 am
Jim was on the stretcher 
and the paramedics  
carried him out. Joyce,  
the caretaker, said she 
could not contact Arnie 
so I offered her my help. 
3/7/2014 5:15:42 am
A nurse came into Jim’s 
room to take his vital 
signs, but he won’t let 
them. He’s afraid they  
are going to hurt him.  
I told Jim they are friends.  
I also informed them he 
likes ice cream.
6/12/2014 6:16:18 pm
I woke up and saw Jim 
sleeping on his bed.  
I think Arnie already went 
home. Hope I can talk  
to Jim when he wakes up. 
Good night, Jim! :)
elders like Jim seem content to communi-
cate with robots. Joseph Coughlin, direc-
tor of MIT’s AgeLab, is pragmatic. “I would 
always prefer the human touch over a robot,” 
he says. “But if there’s no human available, I 
would take high tech in lieu of high touch.” 
CareCoach is a disorienting amalgam 
of both. The service conveys the percep-
tiveness and emotional intelligence of the 
humans powering it but masquerades as 
an animated app. If a person is incapable of 
consenting to CareCoach’s monitoring, then 
someone must do so on their behalf. But the 
more disconcerting issue is how cognizant 
these seniors are of being watched over 
by strangers. Wang considers his product 
“a trade-off between utility and privacy.” 
His workers are trained to duck out during 
baths and clothing changes.
Some CareCoach users insist on greater 
control. A woman in Washington state, 
for example, put a piece of tape over her 
CareCoach tablet’s camera to dictate when 
she could be viewed. Other customers like 
Jim, who are suffering from Alzheimer’s or 
other diseases, might not realize they are 
being watched. Once, when he was tem-
porarily placed in a rehabilitation clinic 
after a fall, a nurse tending to him asked 
Arlyn what made the avatar work. “You 
mean there’s someone overseas looking 
at us?” she yelped, within earshot of Jim. 
(Arlyn isn’t sure whether her dad remem-
bered the incident later.) By default, the 
app explains to patients that someone is 
surveilling them when it’s first introduced. 
But the family members of personal users, 
like Arlyn, can make their own call.
Arlyn quickly stopped worrying about 
whether she was deceiving her dad. Telling 
Jim about the human on the other side of the 
screen “would have blown the whole charm 
of it,” she says. Her mother had Alzheimer’s 
as well, and Arlyn had learned how to nav-
igate the disease: Make her mom feel safe; 
don’t confuse her with details she’d have 
trouble understanding. The same went for 
her dad. “Once they stop asking,” Arlyn says, 
“I don’t think they need to know anymore.” 
At the time, Youa Vang, one of Jim’s regular 
in- person caretakers, didn’t comprehend the 
truth about Pony either. “I thought it was like 
Siri,” she said when told later that it was a 
human in Mexico who had watched Jim and 
typed in the words Pony spoke. She chuck-
led. “If I knew someone was there, I may have 
been a little more creeped out.” 
Even CareCoach users like Arlyn who are 
completely aware of the person on the other 
end of the dashboard tend to experience the 
avatar as something between human, pet, 
and machine—what some roboticists call a 
third ontological category. The care takers 
seem to blur that line too: One day Pony 
told Jim that she dreamed she could turn 
into a real health aide, almost like Pinoc chio

Most of CareCoach’s 12 contractors reside 
in the Philippines, Venezuela, or Mexico. To 
undercut the cost of in-person help, Wang 
posts English-language ads on freelancing 
job sites where foreign workers advertise 
rates as low as $2 an hour. Though he won’t 
disclose his workers’ hourly wages, Wang 
claims the company bases its salaries on fac-

tors such as what a registered nurse would 
make in the CareCoach employee’s home 
country, their language proficiencies, and 
the cost of their internet connection.
The growing network includes people like 
Jill Paragas, a CareCoach worker who lives 
in a subdivision on Luzon island in the Phil-
ippines. Paragas is 35 years old and a college 
graduate. She earns about the same being 
an avatar as she did in her former call cen-
ter job, where she consoled Americans irate 
about credit card charges. (“They wanted 
to, like, burn the company down or kill me,” 
she says with a mirthful laugh.) She works 
nights to coincide with the US daytime, typ-
ing messages to seniors while her 6-year-
old son sleeps nearby.
Before hiring her, Wang interviewed Para-
gas via video, then vetted her with an inter-
national criminal background check. He 
gives all applicants a personality test for 
certain traits: openness, conscientiousness, 
extroversion, agreeableness, and neurot-
icism. As part of the CareCoach training 
program, Paragas earned certifications in 
delirium and dementia care from the Alz-
heimer’s Association, trained in US health 
care ethics and privacy, and learned strat-
egies for counseling those with addictions. 
All this, Wang says, “so we don’t get anyone 
who’s, like, crazy.” CareCoach hires only 
about 1 percent of its applicants.
Paragas understands that this is a com-
plicated business. She’s befuddled by the 
absence of family members around her 
aging clients. “In my culture, we really 
love to take care of our parents,” she says. 
“That’s why I’m like, ‘She is already old, why 
is she alone?’ ” Paragas has no doubt that, 
for some people, she’s their most significant 
daily relationship. Some of her charges tell 
her that they couldn’t live without her. Even 
when Jim grew stubborn or paranoid with 
his daughters, he always viewed Pony as a 
friend. Arlyn quickly realized that she had 
gained a valuable ally.
As time went on, the father, daughter, and 
family pet grew closer. When the snow 
finally melted, Arlyn carried the tablet to 
the picnic table on the patio so they could 
eat lunch overlooking the lake. Even as 
Jim’s speech became increasingly stunted, 
Pony could coax him to talk about his past, 
recounting fishing trips or how he built the 
house to face the sun so it would be warmer 
in winter. When Arlyn took her dad around 
the lake in her sailboat, Jim brought Pony 
along. (“I saw mostly sky,” Rodrigo recalls.)
One day, while Jim and Arlyn were sitting 
on the cottage’s paisley couch, Pony held 
up a photograph of Jim’s wife, Dorothy, 
between her paws. It had been more than a 
year since his wife’s death, and Jim hardly 
mentioned her anymore; he struggled to 
form coherent sentences. That day, though, 
he gazed at the photo fondly. “I still love 
her,” he declared. Arlyn rubbed his shoul-
der, clasping her hand over her mouth to 
stifle tears. “I am getting emotional too,” 
Pony said. Then Jim leaned toward the 
picture of his deceased wife and petted 
her face with his finger, the same way he 
would to awaken a sleeping Pony. 
When Arlyn first signed up for the ser-
vice, she hadn’t anticipated that she would 
end up loving—yes, loving, she says, in 
the sincerest sense of the word—the ava-
tar as well. She taught Pony to say “Yeah, 
sure, you betcha” and “don’t-cha know” 
like a Minnesotan, which made her laugh 
even more than her dad. When Arlyn col-
lapsed onto the couch after a long day of 
caretaking, Pony piped up from her perch 
on the table: 
“Arnie, how are you?”
Alone, Arlyn petted the screen—the way 
Pony nuzzled her finger was weirdly ther-
apeutic—and told the pet how hard it was 
to watch her dad lose his identity.
“I’m here for you,” Pony said. “I love you, 
Arnie.”
When she recalls her own attachment 
to the dog, Arlyn insists her connection 
wouldn’t have developed if Pony was sim-
ply high-functioning AI. “You could feel 
Pony’s heart,” she says. But she preferred to 
think of Pony as her father did—a friendly 
pet—rather than a person on the other end 
of a webcam. “Even though that person 
probably had a relationship to me,” she 
says, “I had a relationship with the avatar.”
Still, she sometimes wonders about the 
person on the other side of the screen. She 
sits up straight and rests her hand over her 
heart. “This is completely vulnerable, but my 
thought is: Did Pony really care about me and 
my dad?” She tears up, then laughs ruefully 
at herself, knowing how weird it all sounds. 
“Did this really happen? Was it really a rela-
tionship, or were they just playing solitaire 
and typing cute things?” She sighs. “But it 
seemed like they cared.”
When Jim turned 92 that August, as 
friends belted out “Happy Birthday” 
around the dinner table, Pony spoke the 
lyrics along with them. Jim blew out the 
single candle on his cake. “I wish you good 
health, Jim,” Pony said, “and many more 
birthdays to come.”

COLOPHON
In Monterrey, Mexico, when Rodrigo talks 
about his unusual job, his friends ask if he’s 
ever lost a client. His reply: Yes.
In early March 2014, Jim fell and hit his 
head on his way to the bathroom. A care-
taker sleeping over that night found him 
and called an ambulance, and Pony woke 
up when the paramedics arrived. The dog 
told them Jim’s date of birth and offered 
to call his daughters as they carried him 
out on a stretcher.
Jim was checked into a hospital, then 
into the nursing home he’d so wanted to 
avoid. The Wi-Fi there was spotty, which 
made it difficult for Jim and Pony to con-
nect. Nurses would often turn Jim’s tablet 
to face the wall. The CareCoach logs from 
those months chronicle a series of com-
munication misfires. “I miss Jim a lot,” 
Pony wrote. “I hope he is doing good all 
the time.” One day, in a rare moment of 
connectivity, Pony suggested he and Jim 
go sailing that summer, just like the good 
old days. “That sounds good,” Jim said.
That July, in an email from Wang, 
Rodrigo learned that Jim had died in his 
sleep. Sitting before his laptop, Rodrigo 
bowed his head and recited a silent Lord’s 
Prayer for Jim, in Spanish. He prayed that 
his friend would be accepted into heaven. 
“I know it’s going to sound weird, but I had 
a certain friendship with him,” he says. “I 
felt like I actually met him. I feel like I’ve 
met them.” In the year and a half that he 
had known them, Arlyn and Jim talked to 
him regularly. Jim had taken Rodrigo on a 
sailboat ride. Rodrigo had read him poetry 
and learned about his rich past. They had 
celebrated birthdays and holidays together 
as family. As Pony, Rodrigo had said “Yeah, 
sure, you betcha” countless times. 
That day, for weeks afterward, and even 
now when a senior will do something that 
reminds him of Jim, Rodrigo says he feels 
a pang. “I still care about them,” he says. 
After her dad’s death, Arlyn emailed Vic-
tor Wang to say she wanted to honor the 
workers for their care. Wang forwarded 
her email to Rodrigo and the rest of Pony’s 
team. On July 29, 2014, Arlyn carried Pony 
to Jim’s funeral, placing the tablet facing 
forward on the pew beside her. She invited 
any workers behind Pony who wanted to 
attend to log in.
A year later, Arlyn finally deleted the 
CareCoach service from the tablet—it felt 
like a kind of second burial. She still sighs, 
“Pony!” when the voice of her old friend 
gives her directions as she drives around 
Minneapolis, reincarnated in Google Maps.
After saying his prayer for Jim, Rodrigo 
heaved a sigh and logged in to the Care-
Coach dashboard to make his rounds. He 
ducked into living rooms, kitchens, and 
hospital rooms around the United States—
seeing if all was well, seeing if anybody 
needed to talk.  10,000
