A SCIENCE OF THE SOUL
A philosopher’s quest to understand the making of the mind.
BY JOSHUA ROTHMAN
Daniel Dennett’s naturalistic account of consciousness draws some people in and 
puts others oﬀ. “There ain’t no magic here,” he says. “Just stage magic.”
F
our billion years ago, Earth 
was a lifeless place. Nothing strug-
gled, thought, or wanted. Slowly, 
that changed. Seawater leached chem-
icals from rocks; near thermal vents, 
those chemicals jostled and combined. 
Some hit upon the trick of making cop-
ies of themselves that, in turn, made 
more copies. The replicating chains were 
caught in oily bubbles, which protected 
them and made replication easier; even-
tually, they began to venture out into 
the open sea. A new level of order had 
been achieved on Earth. Life had begun.
The tree of life grew, its branches 
stretching toward complexity. Organ-
isms developed systems, subsystems, and 
sub-subsystems, layered in ever-deep-
ening regression. They used these sys-
tems to anticipate their future and to 
change it. When they looked within, 
some found that they had selves—con-
stellations of memories, ideas, and pur-
poses that emerged from the systems 
inside. They experienced being alive and 
had thoughts about that experience. 
They developed language and used it 
to know themselves; they began to ask 
how they had been made.
This, to a ﬁrst approximation, is the 
secular story of our creation. It has no 
single author; it’s been written collab-
oratively by scientists over the past  
few centuries. If, however, it could be 
said to belong to any single person, that 
person might be Daniel Dennett, a  
seventy-four-year-old philosopher who 
teaches at Tufts. In the course of forty 
years, and more than a dozen books, 
Dennett has endeavored to explain how 
a soulless world could have given rise 
to a soulful one. His special focus is the 
creation of the human mind. Into his 
own he has crammed nearly every re-
lated discipline: evolutionary biology, 
neuroscience, psychology, linguistics, 
artiﬁcial intelligence. His newest book, 
“From Bacteria to Bach and Back,” tells 
us, “There is a winding path leading 
through a jungle of science and philos-
ophy, from the initial bland assumption 
that we people are physical objects, obey-
ing the laws of physics, to an under-
standing of our conscious minds.”
Dennett has walked that path be-
fore. In “Consciousness Explained,” a 
1991 best-seller, he described conscious-
ness as something like the product of 
multiple, layered computer programs 
running on the hardware of the brain. 
Many readers felt that he had shown 
how the brain creates the soul. Others 
thought that he’d missed the point en-
tirely. To them, the book was like a trea-
tise on music that focussed exclusively 
on the physics of musical instruments. 
It left untouched the question of how 
a three-pound lump of neurons could 
come to possess a point of view, interi-
ority, selfhood, consciousness—quali-
ties that the rest of the material world 
lacks. These skeptics derided the book 
as “Consciousness Explained Away.” 
Nowadays, philosophers are divided into 
two camps. The physicalists believe, with 
Dennett, that science can explain con-
sciousness in purely material terms. The 
dualists believe that science can uncover 
only half of the picture: it can’t explain 
what Nabokov called “the marvel of 
consciousness—that sudden window 
swinging open on a sunlit landscape 
amidst the night of non-being.” 
Late last year, Dennett found him-
self among such skeptics at the Edge-
water Hotel, in Seattle, where the 
Canadian Institute for Advanced Re-
search had convened a meeting about 
animal consciousness. The Edgewater 
was once a rock-and-roll hangout—in 
the late sixties and seventies, members 
of Led Zeppelin were notorious for their

escapades there—but it’s now plush and 
sedate, with overstuﬀed armchairs and 
roaring ﬁreplaces. In a fourth-ﬂoor meet-
ing room with views of Mt. Rainier, 
dozens of researchers shared specula-
tive work on honeybee brains, mouse 
minds, octopus intelligence, avian cog-
nition, and the mental faculties of mon-
keys and human children.
At sunset on the last day of the con-
ference, the experts found themselves 
circling a familiar puzzle known as the 
“zombie problem.” Suppose that you’re 
a scientist studying octopuses. How 
would you know whether an octopus is 
conscious? It interacts with you, responds 
to its environment, and evidently pur-
sues goals, but a nonconscious robot could 
also do those things. The problem is that 
there’s no way to observe consciousness 
directly. From the outside, it’s possible 
to imagine that the octopus is a “zom-
bie”—physically alive but mentally 
empty—and, in theory, the same could 
be true of any apparently conscious being. 
The zombie problem is a conversational 
vortex among those who study animal 
minds: the researchers, anticipating the 
discussion’s inexorable transformation 
into a meditation on “Westworld,” clutched 
their heads and sighed.
Dennett sat at the seminar table like 
a king on his throne. Broad-shouldered 
and imposing, with a ﬂuﬀy white beard 
and a round belly, he resembles a cross 
between Darwin and Santa Claus. He 
has meaty hands and a sonorous voice. 
Many young philosophers of mind look 
like artists (skinny jeans, T-shirts, asym-
metrical hair), but Dennett carries a 
homemade wooden walking stick and 
dresses like a Maine ﬁsherman, in beat-up 
boat shoes and a pocketed vest—a cos-
tume that gives him an air of unpreten-
tious competence. He regards the zom-
bie problem as a typically philosophical 
waste of time. The problem presupposes 
that consciousness is like a light switch: 
either an animal has a self or it doesn’t. 
But Dennett thinks these things are like 
evolution, essentially gradualist, without 
hard borders. The obvious answer to the 
question of whether animals have selves 
is that they sort of have them. He loves 
the phrase “sort of.” Picture the brain, he 
often says, as a collection of subsystems 
that “sort of” know, think, decide, and 
feel. These layers build up, incrementally, 
to the real thing. Animals have fewer 
mental layers than people—in particu-
lar, they lack language, which Dennett 
believes endows human mental life with 
its complexity and texture—but this 
doesn’t make them zombies. It just means 
that they “sort of” have consciousness, 
as measured by human standards.
Dennett waited until the group talked 
itself into a muddle, then broke in. He 
speaks slowly, melodiously, in the conﬁ-
dent tones of a man with answers. When 
he uses philosophical lingo, his voice 
goes deeper, as if he were distancing 
himself from it. “The big mistake we’re 
making,” he said, “is taking our conge-
nial, shared understanding of what it’s 
like to be us, which we learn from nov-
els and plays and talking to each other, 
and then applying it back down the an-
imal kingdom. Wittgenstein”—he deep-
ened his voice—“famously wrote, ‘If a 
lion could talk, we couldn’t understand 
him.’ But no! If a lion could talk, we’d 
understand him just ﬁne. He just wouldn’t 
help us understand anything about lions.”
“Because he wouldn’t be a lion,” an-
other researcher said. 
“Right,” Dennett replied. “He would 
be so diﬀerent from regular lions that he 
wouldn’t tell us what it’s like to be a lion. 
I think we should just get used to the 
fact that the human concepts we apply 
so comfortably in our everyday lives apply 
only sort of to animals.” He concluded, 
“The notorious zombie problem is just a 
philosopher’s fantasy. It’s not anything 
that we have to take seriously.”
“Dan, I honestly get stuck on this,” 
a primate psychologist said. “If you say, 
well, rocks don’t have consciousness, I 
want to agree with you”—but he found 
it diﬃcult to get an imaginative grip on 
the idea of a monkey with a “sort of” 
mind.
If philosophy were a sport, its ball 
would be human intuition. Philosophers 
compete to shift our intuitions from one 
end of the ﬁeld to the other. Some in-
tuitions, however, resist being shifted. 
Among these is our conviction that there 
are only two states of being: awake or 
asleep, conscious or unconscious, alive 
or dead, soulful or material. Dennett 
believes that there is a spectrum, and 
that we can train ourselves to ﬁnd the 
idea of that spectrum intuitive. 
“If you think there’s a ﬁxed meaning 
of the word ‘consciousness,’ and we’re

searching for that, then you’re already 
making a mistake,” Dennett said.
“I hear you as skeptical about whether 
consciousness is useful as a scientiﬁc 
concept,” another researcher ventured.
“Yes, yes,” Dennett said.
“That’s the ur-question,” the re-
searcher replied. “Because, if the answer’s 
no, then we should really go home!”
“No, no!” Dennett exclaimed, as the 
room erupted into laughter. He’d done 
it again: in attempting to explain con-
sciousness, he’d explained it away.
In the nineteenth century, scientists 
and philosophers couldn’t ﬁgure out how 
nonliving things became living. They 
thought that living things possessed a 
mysterious life force. Only over time 
did they discover that life was the prod-
uct of diverse physical systems that, to-
gether, created something that appeared 
magical. Dennett believes that the same 
story will be told about consciousness. 
He wants to tell it, but he sometimes 
wonders if others want to hear it.
“The person who tells people how 
an eﬀect is achieved is often resented, 
considered a spoilsport, a party-pooper,” 
he wrote, around a decade ago, in a 
paper called “Explaining the ‘Magic’ 
of Consciousness.” “If you actually man-
age to explain consciousness, they say, 
you will diminish us all, turn us into 
mere protein robots, mere things.” Den-
nett does not believe that we are “mere 
things.” He thinks that we have souls, 
but he is certain that those souls can 
be explained by science. If evolution 
built them, they can be reverse-engi-
neered. “There ain’t no magic there,” 
he told me. “Just stage magic.”
I
t’s possible to give an account of 
Dennett’s life in which philosophy 
hardly ﬁgures. He is from an old Maine 
family. By the turn of the eighteenth 
century, ancestors of his had settled near 
the border between Maine and New 
Hampshire, at a spot now marked by 
Dennett Road. Dennett and his wife, 
Susan, live in North Andover, Massa-
chusetts, a few minutes’ drive from Tufts, 
where Dennett co-directs the Center 
for Cognitive Studies. But, in 1970, they 
bought a two-hundred-acre farm in Blue 
Hill, about ﬁve hours north of Boston. 
The Dennetts are unusually easygoing 
and sociable, and they quickly became 
friends with the couple next door, Basil 
and Bertha Turner. From Basil, Dennett 
learned to frame a house, shingle a roof, 
glaze a window, build a fence, plow a 
ﬁeld, fell a tree, butcher a hen, dig for 
clams, raise pigs, ﬁsh for trout, and call 
a square dance. “One thing about Dan—
you don’t have to tell him twice,” Turner 
once remarked to a local mechanic. Den-
nett still cherishes the compliment.
In the course of a few summers, he 
ﬁxed up the Blue Hill farmhouse him-
self, installing plumbing and electricity. 
Then, for many years, he suspended his 
academic work during the summer in 
order to devote himself to farming. He 
tended the orchard, made cider, and 
used a Prohibition-era still to turn the 
cider into Calvados. He built a blue-
berry press, made blueberry wine, and 
turned it into aquavit. “He loves to hand 
down word-of-mouth knowledge,” Steve 
Barney, a former student who has be-
come one of the Dennetts’ many “hon-
orary children,” says. “He taught me 
how to use a chain saw, how to prune 
an apple tree, how to ﬁsh for mackerel, 
how to operate a tractor, how to whit-
tle a wooden walking stick from a sin-
gle piece of wood.” Dennett is an avid 
sailor; in 2003, he bought a boat, trained 
his students to sail, and raced with them 
in a regatta. Dennett’s son, Peter, has 
worked for a tree surgeon and a ﬁsh bi-
ologist, and has been a white-water-raft-
ing guide; his daughter, Andrea, runs 
an industrial-plumbing company with 
her husband.
A few years ago, the Dennetts sold 
the farm to buy a nearby waterfront 
home, on Little Deer Isle. On a sunny 
morning this past December, fresh snow 
surrounded the house; where the lawn 
met the water, a Hobie sailboat lay await-
ing spring. Dennett entered the sunlit 
kitchen and, using a special, broad-tined 
fork, carefully split an English muﬃn. 
After eating it with jam, he entered his 
study, a circular room on the ground 
ﬂoor decorated with sailboat keels of 
diﬀerent shapes. A close friend and Lit-
tle Deer Isle visitor, the philosopher and 
psychologist Nicholas Humphrey, had 
e-mailed a draft of an article for Den-
nett to review. The two men are simi-
lar—Humphrey helped discover blind-
sight, studied apes with Dian Fossey, 
and was, for a year, the editor of Granta—
but they diﬀer on certain points in the 
philosophy of consciousness. “Until I 
met Dan,” Humphrey told me, “I never 
had a philosophical hero. Then I dis-
covered that not only was he a better 
philosopher than me; he was a better 
singer, a better dancer, a better tennis 
“Seriously, lady, at this hour you’d make a lot  
better time taking the subway.”

player, a better pianist. There is noth-
ing he does not do.”
Dennett annotated the paper on his 
computer, and then called Humphrey 
on his cell phone to explain that the 
paper was so useful because it was so 
wrong. “I see how I can write a reac-
tion that is not so much a rebuttal as  
a rebuilding on your foundations,”  
he said, mischievously. “Your explora-
tion has helped me see some 
crucial joints in the skele-
ton. I hope that doesn’t upset 
you!” He laughed, and invited 
Humphrey and his family to 
come over later that day.
He then turned to a prob-
lem with the house. Some-
thing was wrong with the 
landline; it had no dial tone. 
The key question was whether 
the problem lay with the wiring inside 
the house or with the telephone lines 
outside. Picking up his walking stick 
and a small plastic telephone, he went 
out to explore. Dennett has suﬀered a 
heart attack and an aortic dissection; 
he is robust, but walks slowly and is 
sometimes short of breath. Carefully, 
he made his way to a little gray service 
box, pried it open using a multitool, 
and plugged in the handset. There was 
no dial tone; the problem was in the 
outside phone lines. Harrumphing, he 
glanced upward to locate them: another 
new joint in the skeleton.
During the course of his career, Den-
nett has developed a way of looking at 
the process by which raw matter be-
comes functional. Some objects are mere 
assemblages of atoms to us, and have 
only a physical dimension; when we 
think of them, he says, we adopt a “phys-
icalist stance”—the stance we inhabit 
when, using equations, we predict the 
direction of a tropical storm. When it 
comes to more sophisticated objects, 
which have purposes and functions, we 
typically adopt a “design stance.” We  
say that a leaf’s “purpose” is to capture 
energy from sunlight, and that a nut 
and bolt are designed to ﬁt together. Fi-
nally, there are objects that seem to have 
beliefs and desires, toward which we 
take the “intentional stance.” If you’re 
playing chess with a chess computer, 
you don’t scrutinize the conductive prop-
erties of its circuits or contemplate the 
inner workings of its operating system 
(the physicalist and design stances, re-
spectively); you ask how the program is 
thinking, what it’s planning, what it 
“wants” to do. These diﬀerent stances 
capture diﬀerent levels of reality, and 
our language reveals which one we’ve 
adopted. We say that proteins fold 
(the physicalist stance), but that eyes 
see (the design stance). We say that 
the chess computer “anticipated” our 
move, that the driverless car 
“decided” to swerve when the 
deer leaped into the road. 
Later, at a rickety antique 
table in the living room, Den-
nett taught me a word game 
he’d perfected called Frigate-
bird. Real frigate birds swoop 
down to steal ﬁsh from other 
birds; in Frigatebird, you steal 
words made of Scrabble tiles 
from your opponents. To do so, you use 
new letters to transform their stems: 
you can’t steal “march” by making 
“marched,” but you can do it by mak-
ing “charmed.” As we played, I tried to 
attend to the workings of my own mind. 
How did I know that I could use the 
letters “u,” “t,” and “o” to transform Den-
nett’s “drain” into “duration”? I couldn’t 
quite catch myself in the act of ﬁgur-
ing it out. To Dennett, this blind-
ness reﬂects the fact that we take the 
intentional stance toward ourselves. 
We experience ourselves at the level of 
thoughts, decisions, and intentions; the 
machinery that generates those higher- 
order properties is obscured. Conscious-
ness is deﬁned as much by what it hides 
as by what it reveals. Over two evenings, 
while drinking gin on the rocks with a 
twist—a “sort of” cocktail—we played 
perhaps a dozen games of Frigatebird, 
and I lost every time. Dennett was pa-
tient and encouraging (“You’re getting 
the hang of it!”), even as he transformed 
my “quest” into “equations.”
A 
running joke among people who 
study consciousness is that Den-
nett himself might be a zombie. (“Only 
a zombie like Dennett could write a 
book called ‘Consciousness Explained’ 
that doesn’t address consciousness at 
all,” the computer scientist Jaron Lanier 
has written.) The implicit criticism is 
that Dennett’s account of consciousness 
treats the self like a computer and reﬂects 
a disengagement from things like feel-
ing and beauty. Dennett seems wounded 
by this idea. “There are those wags who 
insist that I was born with an impover-
ished mental life,” he told me. “That 
ain’t me! I seem to be drinking in life’s 
joys pretty well.”
Dennett’s full name is Daniel Clem-
ent Dennett III. He was born in Bos-
ton in 1942. His father, Daniel C. Den-
nett, Jr., was a professor of Islamic 
history, who, during the Second World 
War, was recruited by the Oﬃce of 
Strategic Services and became a secret 
agent. Dennett spent his early child-
hood in Beirut, where his father posed 
as a cultural attaché at the American 
Embassy. In Beirut, he had a pet ga-
zelle named Babar and learned to speak 
some Arabic. When he was ﬁve, his 
father was killed in an unexplained 
plane crash while on a mission in Ethi-
opia. In Dennett’s clearest memory of 
him, they’re driving through the des-
ert in a Jeep, looking for a group of 
Bedouins; when they ﬁnd the camp, 
some Bedouin women take the young 
Dennett aside and pierce his ears. (The 
scars are still visible.) 
After his father’s death, Dennett re-
turned to the Boston suburbs with his 
mother and his two sisters. His mother 
became a book editor; with some guid-
ance from his father’s friends, Dennett 
became the man of the house. He had 
his own workshop and, aged six, used 
scraps of lumber to build a small table 
and chair for his Winnie-the-Pooh. As 
he fell asleep, he would listen to his 
mother play Rachmaninoﬀ’s Piano Pre-
lude No. 6 in E-Flat Major. Today, the 
piece moves him to tears—“I’ve tried 
to master it,” he says, “but I could never 
play it as well as she could.” For a while, 
Dennett made money playing jazz piano 
in bars. He also plays the guitar, the 
acoustic bass, the recorder, and the ac-
cordion, and can still sing the a- cappella 
tunes he learned, in his twenties, as a 
member of the Boston Saengerfest Men’s 
Chorus. 
As a Harvard undergraduate, Den-
nett wanted to be an artist. He pursued 
painting, then switched to sculpture; 
when he met Susan, he told her that 
she had nice shoulders and asked if she 
would model for him. (She declined, 
but they were married two years later.) 
A photograph taken in 1963, when  
Dennett was a graduate student, shows 

him trim and shirtless in a courtyard in 
Athens, smoking a pipe as he works a 
block of marble. Although he succeeded 
in exhibiting some sculptures in galler-
ies, he decided that he wasn’t brilliant 
enough to make a career in art. Still, he 
continued to sculpt, throw pots, build 
furniture, and whittle. His whittlings 
are ﬁnely detailed; most are meant to 
be handled. A life-size wooden apple 
comes apart, in cross-sections, to reveal 
a detailed stem and core; a ﬁst-size nut 
and bolt turn smoothly on minute, per-
fectly made threads. (Billed as “haptic 
sculptures,” the whittles are currently 
on display at Underdonk, a gallery in 
Brooklyn.)
Dennett studied philosophy as an 
undergraduate with W. V. O. Quine, 
the Harvard logician. His scientiﬁc 
awakening came later, when he was a 
graduate student at Oxford. With a 
few classmates, he found himself de-
bating what happens when your arm 
falls asleep. The others were discuss-
ing the problem in abstract, philosoph-
ical terms—“sensation,” “perception,” 
and the like—which struck Dennett 
as odd. Two decades earlier, the philos-
opher Gilbert Ryle, Dennett’s disserta-
tion adviser, had coined the phrase “the 
ghost in the machine” to mock the the-
ory, associated with René Descartes, 
that our physical bodies are controlled 
by immaterial souls. The other students 
were talking about the ghost; Dennett 
wanted to study the machine. He began 
teaching himself neuroscience the next 
day. Later, with the help of various ac-
ademic friends and neighbors, Dennett 
learned about psychology, computer 
programming, linguistics, and artiﬁcial 
intelligence—the disciplines that came 
to form cognitive science. 
One of Dennett’s early collabora-
tors was Douglas Hofstadter, the poly-
math genius whose book about the 
mind, “Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eter-
nal Golden Braid,” became an unlikely 
best-seller in 1979. “When he was 
young, he played the philosophy game 
very strictly,” Hofstadter said of Den-
nett. “He studied the analytic philos-
ophers and the Continental philoso-
phers and wrote pieces that responded 
to them in the traditional way. But then 
he started deviating from the standard 
pathway. He became much more in-
formed by science than many of his 
colleagues, and he grew very frustrated 
with the constant, prevalent belief 
among them in such things as zom-
bies. These things started to annoy him, 
and he started writing piece after piece 
to try to destroy the myths that he con-
sidered these to be—the religious res-
idues of dualism.”
Arguments, Dennett found, rarely 
shift intuitions; it’s through stories  
that we revise our sense of what’s nat-
ural. (He calls such stories “intuition 
pumps.”) In 1978, he published a short 
story called “Where Am I?,” in which 
a philosopher, also named Daniel Den-
nett, is asked to volunteer for a dan-
gerous mission to disarm an experi-
mental nuclear warhead. The warhead, 
which is buried beneath Tulsa, Okla-
homa, emits a kind of radiation that’s 
safe for the body but lethal to the brain. 
Government scientists decide on a rad-
ical plan: they separate Dennett’s brain 
from his body, using radio transmit-
ters implanted in his skull to allow the 
brain, which is stored in a vat in Hous-
ton, to control the body as it approaches 
the warhead. “Think of it as a mere 
stretching of the nerves,” the scientists 
say. “If your brain were just moved over 
an inch in your skull, that would not 
alter or impair your mind. We’re sim-
ply going to make the nerves indeﬁ-
nitely elastic by splicing radio links 
into them.” 
After the surgery, Dennett is led into 
the brain-support lab:
I peered through the glass. There, ﬂoating 
in what looked like ginger ale, was undeniably 
a human brain, though it was almost covered 
with printed circuit chips, plastic tubules, elec-
trodes, and other paraphernalia. . . . I thought 
to myself: “Well, here I am sitting on a fold-
ing chair, staring through a piece of plate glass 
at my own brain. . . . But wait,” I said to my-
self, “shouldn’t I have thought, ‘Here I am, sus-
pended in a bubbling ﬂuid, being stared at by 
my own eyes’?” . . . . I tried and tried to think 
myself into the vat, but to no avail. 
Toward the end of the story, the 
radio equipment malfunctions, and 
Dennett’s point of view is instantly re-
located. It is “an impressive demonstra-
tion of the immateriality of the soul, 
based on physicalist principles and 
premises,” he writes, “for as the last 
radio signal between Tulsa and Hous-
ton died away, had I not changed lo-
cation from Tulsa to Houston at the 

speed of light?” The story contains only 
neurons and machines, and is entirely 
materialist; even so, it shows that you 
aren’t situated “in” your brain the same 
way you’re situated “in” a room. It also 
suggests that the intuitions upon which 
philosophers so conﬁdently rely are ac-
tually illusions created by an elaborate 
system of machinery. 
Only rarely do cracks in the illusion 
of consciousness appear through which 
one might see the machinery at work. 
Proust inspected the state between  
sleep and wakefulness. Coleridge ex-
perimented with mind-altering drugs.  
Neuroscientists examine minds com-
promised by brain injury. Dennett’s ap-
proach has been to look back into evo-
lutionary history. In the minds of other 
animals, even insects, Dennett believes, 
we can see the functional components 
upon which our selfhood depends. We 
can also see the qualities we value most 
in human selfhood in “sort of ” form. 
Even free will, he thinks, evolves over 
evolutionary time. Your amygdala, the 
part of the brain that registers fear, may 
not be free in any meaningful sense—
it’s eﬀectively a robot—but it endows 
the mind to which it belongs with the 
ability to avoid danger. In this way, the 
winding path leads from determinism 
to freedom, too: “A whole can be freer 
than its parts.”
A
long with Richard Dawkins, Sam 
Harris, and the late Christopher 
Hitchens, Dennett is often cited as one 
of the “four horsemen of the New Athe-
ism.” In a 2006 book called “Breaking 
the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phe-
nomenon,” he argued that religion ought 
to be studied rather than practiced. Re-
cently, with the researcher Linda La-
Scola, he published “Caught in the 
Pulpit: Leaving Belief Behind,” a book 
of interviews with clergypeople who 
have lost their faith. He can be haughty 
in his dismissal of religion. A few years 
ago, while he was recovering from his 
aortic dissection, he wrote an essay 
called “Thank Goodness,” in which he 
chastised well-wishers for saying “Thank 
God.” (He urged them, instead, to thank 
“goodness,” as embodied by the doc-
tors, nurses, and scientists who were 
“genuinely responsible for the fact that 
I am alive.”) 
Yet Dennett is also comfortable with 
religion—even, in some ways, nostal-
gic for it. Like his wife, he was brought 
up as a Congregationalist, and although 
he never believed in God, he enjoyed 
going to church. For much of his life, 
Dennett has sung sacred music in choirs 
(he gets misty-eyed when he recalls 
singing Bach’s “St. Matthew Passion”). 
He and Susan tried sending their chil-
dren to Sunday school, so that they 
could enjoy the music, sermons, and 
Bible stories, but it didn’t take. Den-
nett’s sister Cynthia is a minister: “A 
saintly person,” Dennett says, admir-
ingly, “who’s a little annoyed by her lit-
tle brother.”
The materialist world view is often 
associated with despair. In “Anna 
Karenina,” Konstantin Levin, the nov-
el’s hero, stares into the night sky, 
reﬂects upon his brief, bubblelike ex-
istence in an inﬁnite and indiﬀerent 
universe, and contemplates suicide. For 
Dennett, however, materialism is spir-
itually satisfying. In a 1995 book called 
“Darwin’s Dangerous Idea,” he asks, 
“How long did it take Johann Sebas-
tian Bach to create the ‘St. Matthew 
Passion’?” Bach, he notes, had to live 
for forty-two years before he could 
begin writing it, and he drew on two 
thousand years of Christianity—in-
deed, on all of human culture. The sub-
systems of his mind had been evolv-
ing for even longer; creating Homo 
sapiens, Dennett writes, required “bil-
lions of years of irreplaceable design 
work”—performed not by God, of 
course, but by natural selection.
“Darwin’s dangerous idea,” Dennett 
writes, is that Bach’s music, Christian-
ity, human culture, the human mind, 
and Homo sapiens “all exist as fruits of 
a single tree, the Tree of Life,” which 
“created itself, not in a miraculous, in-
stantaneous whoosh, but slowly, slowly.” 
He asks, “Is this Tree of Life a God 
one could worship? Pray to? Fear? Prob-
ably not.” But, he says, it is “greater than 
anything any of us will ever conceive 
of in detail worthy of its detail. . . . I 
could not pray to it, but I can stand in 
aﬃrmation of its magniﬁcence. This 
world is sacred.”
Almost every December for the past 
forty years, the Dennetts have held a 
black-tie Christmas-carolling party at 
their home. This year, snow was fall-
ing as the guests arrived; the airy mod-
ern shingle-style house was decorated 
like a Yuletide bed-and-breakfast, with 
toy soldiers on parade. In the kitchen, 
“I’ll go shop around for a doctor.”

a small robotic dog-on-wheels named 
Tati huddled nonfunctionally; the 
living- room bookshelf displayed a set 
of Dennett-made Russian dolls—Des-
cartes on the outside, a ghost in the 
middle, and a robot inside the ghost. 
Dennett, dapper in his tuxedo, min-
gled with the guests. With a bearded, 
ponytailed postdoc, he considered some 
mysteries of monkey consciousness; with 
his silver-haired neighbors, many of 
whom had attended the party annually 
since 1976, he discussed the Patriots and 
the ﬁner points of apple brandy. After 
a potluck dinner, he called everyone over 
to the piano, where Mark DeVoto, a re-
tired music professor, was noodling on 
“O Come, All Ye Faithful.” From piles 
on a Dennett-built coﬀee table, Den-
nett and his wife distributed homemade 
books of Christmas carols. 
“Hello!” Dennett said. “Are we ready?” 
Surrounded by friends, he was grinning 
from ear to ear. “Let’s go. We’ll start 
with ‘O Come, All Ye Faithful.’ First 
verse in English, second in Latin!”
 Earlier, I’d asked Susan Dennett 
how their atheism would shape their 
carol-singing. “When we get to the 
parts about the Virgin, we sometimes 
sing with our eyebrows raised,” she said. 
In the event, their performance was 
unironic. Dennett, a brave soloist, sang 
beautifully, then apologized for his 
voice. The most arresting carol was a 
tune called “O Hearken Ye.” Dennett 
sang the words “Gloria, gloria / In ex-
celsis Deo” with great seriousness, his 
hands at his sides, his eyes faraway. 
When the carol faded into an appre-
ciative silence, he sighed and said, “Now, 
that’s a beautiful hymn.”
D
ennett has a philosophical 
arch-nemesis: an Australian named 
David Chalmers. Chalmers, who teaches 
at N.Y.U. and at the Australian Na-
tional University, believes that Dennett 
only “sort of” understands conscious-
ness. In his view, Dennett’s theories 
don’t adequately explain subjective ex-
perience or why there is an inner life in 
the ﬁrst place. 
Chalmers and Dennett are as diﬀer-
ent as two philosophers of mind can 
be. Chalmers wears a black leather jacket 
over a black T-shirt. He believes in the 
zombie problem and is the lead singer 
of a consciousness-themed rock band 
that performs a song called “The Zom-
bie Blues.” (“I act like you act, I do 
what you do. . . . / What consciousness 
is, I ain’t got a clue / I got the Zombie 
Blues.”) In his most important book, 
“The Conscious Mind,” published in 
1996, Chalmers accused Dennett and 
the physicalists of focussing on the “easy 
problems” of consciousness—questions 
about the workings of neurons or other 
cognitive systems—while ignoring the 
“hard problem.” In a formulation he 
likes: “How does the water of the brain 
turn into the wine of consciousness?” 
Since then, the “hard problem” has been 
a rallying cry for those philosophers 
who think that Dennett’s view of the 
mind is incomplete. 
Consider your laptop. It’s process-
ing information but isn’t having expe-
riences. Now, suppose that every year 
your laptop gets smarter. A few years 
from now, it may, like I.B.M.’s Watson, 
win “Jeopardy!” Soon afterward, it may 
have meaningful conversations with 
you, like the smartphone voiced by Scar-
lett Johansson in “Her.” Johansson’s 
character is conscious: you can fall in 
love with her, and she with you. There’s 
a soul in that phone. But how did it 
get there? How was the inner space 
of consciousness opened up within 
the circuits and code? This is the hard 
problem. Dennett regards it, too, as a 
philosopher’s fantasy. Chalmers thinks 
that, at present, it is insurmountable. If 
it’s easy for you to imagine a conscious 
robot, then you probably side with Den-
nett. If it’s easier to imagine a robot that 
only seems conscious, you’re probably 
with Chalmers.
A few years ago, a Russian venture 
capitalist named Dmitry Volkov orga-
nized a showdown between Dennett 
and Chalmers near Disko Island, oﬀ the 
west coast of Greenland. Before mak-
ing a fortune investing in Shazam and 
in the Russian version of PayPal, Volkov 
“You’d think a celebrity sex tape would display  
a higher degree of showmanship.”

was a graduate student in philosophy at 
Moscow State University, where he wrote 
a dissertation on Dennett’s work. Now 
he chartered a hundred-and-sixty-eight-
foot schooner, the S/V Rembrandt van 
Rijn, and invited Dennett, Chalmers, 
and eighteen other philosophers on a 
weeklong cruise, along with ten gradu-
ate students. Most of the professional 
philosophers were materialists, like Den-
nett, but the graduate students were un-
committed. Dennett and Chalmers 
would compete for their allegiance.
In June, when the Arctic sun never 
sets, the lowlands of Disko are covered 
with ﬂowering angelica. The philoso-
phers piled into inﬂatable boats to ex-
plore the fjords and the tundra. The 
year before, in the Journal of Conscious-
ness Studies, Dennett had published a 
paper called “The Mystery of David 
Chalmers,” in which he proposed seven 
reasons for Chalmers’s resistance to his 
views, among them a fear of death and 
a pointless desire to “pursue exhaustively 
nuanced analyses of our intuitions.” This 
had annoyed Chalmers, but on the cruise 
the two philosophers were still able to 
marvel, companionably, at the land-
scape’s alien beauty. Later, everyone 
gathered in the Rembrandt’s spacious 
galley, where Volkov, a slim, voluble man 
in sailor’s stripes, presided over an in-
tellectual round-robin. Each philoso-
pher gave a talk summarizing another’s 
work; afterward, the philosopher who 
had been summarized responded and 
took questions. 
Andy Clark, a lean Scottish philoso-
pher with a punk shock of pink hair, 
summarized Dennett’s views. He wore 
a T-shirt depicting a peacock with a tail 
made of screwdrivers, wrenches, and other 
tools. “It obviously looks like something 
quite colorful and full of complexity and 
‘peacockness,’ ” he said. “But, if you look 
more closely, that complexity is actually 
built out of a number of little devices.”
“A Swiss Army peacock!” Dennett 
rumbled, approvingly. He was in his  
element: he loves parties, materialism, 
and the sea.
After the introduction and summa-
rizing part was over, Chalmers, carrying 
a can of Palm Belgian ale, walked to the 
front of the room and began his remarks. 
Neurobiological explanations of con-
sciousness focus on brain functions, he 
said. But, “when it comes to explaining 
consciousness, one needs to explain more 
than the functions. There are introspec-
tive data—data about what it’s like to be 
a conscious subject, what it’s like expe-
riencing now and hearing now, what it’s 
like to have an emotion or to hear music.” 
He continued, “There are some people, 
like Dan Dennett, who think that all we 
need to explain is the functions. . . . Many 
people ﬁnd that this is not taking con-
sciousness seriously.” Lately, he said, he 
had been gravitating toward “pan- proto-
psychism”—the idea that consciousness 
might be “a fundamental property of the 
universe” upon which the brain some-
how draws. It was a strange idea, but, 
then, consciousness was strange.
Andy Clark was the ﬁrst to respond. 
“You didn’t actually give us any posi-
tives for pan-psychism,” he said. “It was 
kind of the counsel of despair.”
Jesse Prinz, a blue-haired philoso-
pher from cuny, seemed almost enraged. 
“Positing dualism leads to no further 
insights and discoveries!” he said.
Calmly, nursing his beer, Chalmers 
responded to his critics. He said that he 
could make a positive case for pan- proto-
psychism, pointed out that his position 
wasn’t necessarily antimaterialist (a 
pan-psychic force could be perfectly ma-
terial, like electromagnetism), and de-
clared that he was all in favor of more 
neuroscientiﬁc research. 
Dennett had lurked oﬀ to the side, 
stolid and silent, but he now launched 
into an argument about perspective. He 
told Chalmers that there didn’t have to 
be a hard boundary between third- 
person explanations and ﬁrst-person ex-
perience—between, as it were, the de-
scription of the sugar molecule and the 
taste of sweetness. Why couldn’t one 
see oneself as taking two diﬀerent stances 
toward a single phenomenon? It was 
possible, he said, to be “neutral about 
the metaphysical status of the data.” 
From the outside, it looks like neurons; 
from the inside, it feels like conscious-
ness. Problem solved.
“Could we move the piece representing ourselves a  
little farther away from the battle?”

Chalmers was unconvinced. Pacing 
up and down the galley, he insisted that 
“merely cataloguing the third-person 
data” could not explain the existence of 
a ﬁrst-person point of view.
Dennett sighed and, leaning against 
the wall, weighed his words. “I don’t 
see why it isn’t an embarrassment to 
your view,” he said, “that you can’t name 
a kind of experiment that would get 
at ‘ﬁrst-personal data,’ or ‘experiences.’ 
That’s all I ask—give me a single ex-
ample of a scientiﬁcally respectable  
experiment!” 
“There are any number of experi-
ments!” Chalmers said, heatedly. When 
the argument devolved into a debate 
about diﬀerent kinds of experimental 
setups, Dennett said, “I think maybe 
this session is over, don’t you? It’s time 
to go to the bar!” He looked to Chal- 
mers, who smiled. 
Among the professional philosophers, 
Dennett seemed to have won a narrow 
victory. But a survey conducted at the 
end of the cruise found that most of the 
grad students had joined Team Chal- 
mers. Volkov conjectured that for many 
people, especially those who are new to 
philosophy, “it’s the question of the soul 
that’s driving their opinions. It’s the 
value of human life. It’s the question of 
the special position of humans in the 
world, in the universe.” 
Despite his aﬀability, Dennett some-
times expresses a weary frustration with 
the immovable intuitions of the people 
he is trying to convince. “You shouldn’t 
trust your intuitions,” he told the phi-
losophers on the Rembrandt. “Con-
ceivability or inconceivability is a life’s 
work—it’s not something where you just 
screw up your head for a second!” He 
feels that Darwin’s central lesson—that 
everything in biology is gradual; that it 
arrives “not in a miraculous, instanta-
neous whoosh, but slowly, slowly”—is 
too easily swept aside by our categori-
cal habits of mind. It could be that he 
is struggling with the nature of language, 
which imposes a hierarchical clarity upon 
the world that’s powerful but sometimes 
false. It could also be that he is wrong. 
For him, the struggle—a Darwinian 
struggle, at the level of ideas—contin-
ues. “I have devoted half a century, my 
entire academic life, to the project, in a 
dozen books and hundreds of articles 
tackling various pieces of the puzzle, 
without managing to move all that many 
readers from wary agnosticism to calm 
conviction,” he writes, in “From Bacte-
ria to Bach and Back.” “Undaunted, I 
am trying once again.”
F
or many years, I took Chalmers’s 
side in this dispute. I read Dennett’s 
“Consciousness Explained,” but I felt 
that something crucial was missing. I 
couldn’t understand how neurons—even 
billions of neurons—could generate the 
experience of being me. Terrence Dea-
con, an anthropologist who writes about 
consciousness and neuroscience, refers 
to “the Cartesian wound that separated 
mind from body at the birth of mod-
ern science.” For a long time, not even 
the profoundly informed arguments that 
Dennett advanced proved capable of 
healing that wound.
Then, late last year, my mother had 
a catastrophic stroke. It devastated the 
left side of her brain, wrecking her pa-
rietal and temporal lobes and Broca’s 
area—parts of the brain that are in-
volved in the emotions, the senses, mem-
ory, and speech. My mother now ap-
pears to be living in an eternal present. 
She can say only two words, “water” and 
“time.” She is present in the room—she 
looks me in the eye—but is capable of 
only ﬂeeting recognition; she knows 
only that I am someone she should rec-
ognize. She grasps the world, but lightly. 
As I spent time with my mother, I 
found that my intuitions 
were shifting to Dennett’s 
side of the ﬁeld. It seems 
natural to say that she “sort 
of ” thinks, knows, cares, 
remembers, and under-
stands, and that she is “sort 
of” conscious. It seems ob-
vious that there is no “light 
switch” for consciousness: 
she is present and absent 
in diﬀerent ways, depending on which 
of her subsystems are functioning. I still 
can’t quite picture how neurons create 
consciousness. But, perhaps because I 
can take a stance toward my mother 
that I can’t take toward myself, my be-
lief in the “hard problem” has dissolved. 
On an almost visceral level, I ﬁnd it eas-
ier to accept the reality of the material 
mind. I have moved from agnosticism 
to calm conviction.
On a morning this past winter, Den-
nett sat in an armchair in his Maine 
living room. The sky and the water 
were blue and bright. He’d acquired 
two copies of the Ellsworth American, 
the local newspaper; later, he and Susan 
would sit by the ﬁreplace and compete 
to see who could ﬁnish the crossword 
ﬁrst. In the meantime, he was think-
ing about the nature of understanding. 
He recalled a time, many years ago, 
when he found himself lecturing a 
group of physicists. He showed them 
a slide that read “E=mc 2 ” and asked if 
anyone in the audience understood it. 
Almost all of the physicists raised their 
hands, but one man sitting in the front 
protested. “Most of the people in this 
room are experimentalists,” he said. 
“They think they understand this equa-
tion, but, really, they don’t. The only 
people who really understand it are the 
theoreticians.” 
“Understanding, too, comes in de-
grees,” Dennett concluded, back in his 
Maine living room. “So how do you take 
that last step? What if the answer is: 
‘Well, you can only sort of take it’?” Phys-
ics, Dennett said, tells us that there are 
more than three dimensions, and we 
can use math to prove they’re there; at 
the same time, we struggle to picture 
them in our heads. That doesn’t mean 
they’re not real. Perhaps, he thought, 
the wholly material soul is similarly hard 
to imagine. “I’m not ready to say it’s un-
imaginable, because there are times when 
I think I can imagine it,” 
he said, “and then it doesn’t 
seem to be such a big leap 
at all. But—it is.” 
Before the morning 
slipped away, Dennett de-
cided to go out for a walk, 
down to where the lawn 
ended and a rocky beach 
began. He’d long de-
lighted in a particular 
rock formation, where a few stones 
were piled just so, creating a peephole. 
He was disappointed to ﬁnd that the 
tides had rearranged the stones, and 
that the hole had disappeared. The 
dock was pulled ashore for the winter, 
its parts stacked next to his sailboat. 
He walked down the steps anyway, oc-
casionally leaning on his walking stick. 
For a few minutes, he stood at the bot-
tom, savoring the frigid air, the lapping 
water, the dazzling sun. 
