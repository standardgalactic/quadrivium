As once-threatened animal

showing up precisely 
where they don't belong: 
in backyards. And the 
wildlife isn’t as afraid of us 
as we might think.

STE VEN MENZIK
IOWA PARK, TX
I ﬁnd myself in slight disagree-
ment with a few of your 
muﬆ-have tools. Do you 
seriously consider WD-40 and 
a duﬆ mask tools? ey are 
supplies, in line with shop 
towels and Lava soap. If I were 
seleing juﬆ 50, I would have 
included some C-clamps, a wire 
brush, propane torch and ax. 
Great article otherwise, thanks.

Bigger Toolbox?
Your ﬆory “50 Tools We Can’t 
Live Without” highlighted a 
great seleion of tools. I’m 
only missing the ohmmeter  
(I wouldn’t know what to do 
with it). But I would have liked 
a few more. e handsaws 
could have been replaced with 
the more accurate Japanese 
pull or cabinet saws. Moﬆ 
importantly, you omitted the 
remodeler’s beﬆ friend—the 
reciprocating saw. It is perhaps 
the moﬆ versatile tool I own, 
except for a pencil. Oh, yes— 
you forgot the pencil, too.
JIM STACE Y
FAYETTEVILLE, NC
I very much enjoyed your tools 
article but believe that some of 
them are misplaced. Outdoor 
lawn and garden tools are 
important but not always 
needed, depending on where

responded to our

Your ﬆory on 50 tools was a

of hundreds of readers who 
wrote to say there was one 
thing missing—du tape, the 
moﬆ indispensable tool of all.
DONALD PACK BRYAN

Mission Accomplished 
Logan Ward’s “e Mission,” 
about inventor and Amazonian 
missionary Steve Saint and his 
ﬂying dune buggy, was one of 
the beﬆ articles I have read in 
your magazine over many 
years. What’s not to like about 
an airplane that doesn’t need a 
pilot or a runway? (I want one 
myself for commuting.) Yes, it 
was popular and mechanical, 
but the ﬆory was enriched by 
the details of Saint’s family and 
his personal hiﬆory.
MARK PICHA J
BURBANK, CA
I was pleased that your article 
on Steve Saint and his 
invention included his family 
hiﬆory, which showed the 
desire of missionaries to help 
tribes in the Amazon. It really 
added background on Steve’s 
intereﬆ, commitment and 
motivation to create his ﬂying 
vehicle. I hope to see a 
followup article describing how 
the canopy is ﬆored when 
driving in the jungle.

TO SURVIVE ITS FALL,  
THE MASSIVE NEW MARS  
ROVER WILL DEPEND ON  
THE LARGEST SPACE  
PARACHUTE EVER BUILT.
BY MORGAN LORD
e parachute is 
designed to sur-
vive deployment 
in the Martian 
atmosphere at 
Mach 2.2, where 
it will generate 
65,000 pounds 
of drag.
A nylon and  
polyeﬆer compo-
sition keeps the 
parachute’s total 
weight down to 
juﬆ 120 pounds.
When the NASA Mars Science Laboratory rover lands on Mars in 
2012, it will face a unique obﬆacle: With an Earth weight of nearly a 
ton (compared to about 400 pounds for previous Mars rovers) and a Mars 
weight of about 750 pounds, it is too massive for any exiﬆing space para-
chute. So to cushion its fall through the thin Martian atmosphere (which is 
less than 1 percent as dense as Earth’s), NASA engineers had to come up with 
something really big. e new parachute opens to a diameter of 52 feet, 
making it twice the size of any parachute ever ﬂown beyond Earth. 
To teﬆ the parachute, which was built by Pioneer Aerospace, NASA brought 
it into the world’s largeﬆ wind tunnel, located at NASA Ames Research Center 
in Moﬀett Field, Calif. e parachute passed ﬂight-qualiﬁcation teﬆing in April, 
and is now ready for the rover’s 2011 launch date.

BRIDGE 
MONITORING
+  At the end of 
2008, more than 
one out of every 
four bridges in the 
United States was 
classiﬁed as either 
ﬆruurally 
deﬁcient or 
obsolete by the 
Department of 
Transportation. To 
help ﬁx this, 
researchers at 
Florida’s University 
of Miami are 
teﬆing wireless 
sensors that 
transmit real-time 
SPACE 
RADIATION
+  Aer two years 
of data analysis, a 
team of inter-
national research-
ers has discovered 
the cause of a 
myﬆerious source 
of space radiation 
called the far 
infrared back-
ground. e 
radiation, which 
was discovered a 
decade ago by 
NASA’s COBE 
mission, comes 
from a group of 
galaxies located  
7 billion to 10 
billion light years 
away. As hot new 
ﬆars are formed in 
these galaxies, light 
from them is 
absorbed by nearby 
duﬆ, which heats 
up and re-emits the 
infrared signal 
aﬆronomers had 
been puzzling over.
VIRUS-BUILT 
BATTERIES
+  In 2006, MIT 
researchers made 
ﬆrides toward 
completing a 
virus-built lithium- 
ion battery. Now, 
the scientiﬆs have 
solved a missing 
piece of the puzzle 
by engineering a 
virus that can 
create cathodes by 
sheathing itself in 
iron phosphate 
before attaching to 
carbon nanotubes. 
e new battery is 
currently in the 
prototype ﬆage; 
the process could 
yield cheaper 
batteries that are 
less toxic to 
produce than 
today’s lithium- 
ion cells.
Battery-Powered Sub
+ An unmanned autonomous submarine 
successfully mapped out 300 miles of 
seaﬂoor underneath the thick ice of 
Antarica’s Pine Island Glacier. e sub’s 
creative source of power: 5000 oﬀ-the-
shelf D batteries. e “Autosub,” which 
was built at Britain’s National Oceanogra-
phy Centre, is equipped with multibeam 
sonar that allows it to create detailed 
maps while navigating between jagged ice

+  Could robots soon make scientiﬆs 
obsolete? Two groups of researchers 
have announced advances in the queﬆ to 
create a computer capable of developing 
experiments, teﬆing hypotheses and 
learning from the results. Researchers at 
Aberyﬆwyth University and the 
University of Cambridge in the U.K. have 
built a robot biologiﬆ that can design and 
condu experiments to identify genes 
involved in yeaﬆ metabolism. Meanwhile, 
researchers at Cornell University have 
created a machine able to deduce natural 
laws by observing physical syﬆems.

ere have been many attempts at producing a ﬂying car over the 
years—maybe too many. None has found its way onto consumer 
driveways. But a vehicle billed as the world’s ﬁrﬆ praical ﬂying 
car had its Kitty Hawk moment on March 5, when it successfully 
maintained ﬂight for 37 seconds. e two-seat Transition, classed 
by the FAA as a Light Sport Aircra, is a proof-of-concept built by 
Terrafugia, an MIT spinoﬀ. Using ordinary unleaded gasoline, it can 
ﬂy at 115 mph with a range of 460 miles, morph into a road-safe 
car in less than 30 seconds, pull 30 mpg on the highway and ﬁt into 
an ordinary garage. e company is taking deposits and plans to

Space’s Final

 Where does the Earth’s  
 atmosphere end and space  
 begin?  at depends whom  
you ask. Various deﬁnitions  
have fought it out. In 1961, Alan 
Shepard reached an altitude  
of 116 miles to become the  
ﬁrﬆ American in space; 
SpaceShipOne nabbed the  
Ansari X Prize in 2004 aer 
hitting 62 miles. But scientiﬆs at 
Canada’s University of Calgary 
say new technology has allowed 
them to pinpoint the border: It 
lies 73 miles above the Earth’s 
surface. at’s where relatively 
gentle atmospheric winds begin 
to give way to space’s maelﬆrom-
like particle ﬂows, which can 
exceed 600 mph. e data comes 
from the Supra-ermal Ion 
Imager, which was sent into 
space in 2007.  — SETH PORGES
e new border: 
“Below this boundary, 
charged-particle 
winds are pulled by 
Earth’s atmosphere,” 
David Knudsen, a

says. “But beyond it, 
the winds go faﬆer

Duncan Jones
 
If you met yourself in person, would you like you? It’s a queﬆion 
direor Duncan Jones asked when conceptualizing Moon, out  
June 12. e ﬁlm—which follows a solitary lunar miner named Sam 
(Sam Rockwell)—is a throwback to sci-ﬁ classics such as Blade Runner, 
where the central conﬂi involves queﬆions of identity and the moral 
compromises caused by advancing technology. 
Q Sam Rockwell’s charaer manages a moon base where helium-3 is 
mined for use in fusion reaors on Earth. Harrison H. Schmitt, the 
only geologiﬆ to go to the moon, wrote a ﬆory about the same thing 
for PM’s Oober 2004 issue, but where did you get the idea?
A  I didn’t know PM had done an article on that. I had read Robert Zubrin’s 
book Entering Space: Creating a Spacefaring Civilization, about how 
we could ﬁnancially juﬆify colonizing the solar syﬆem. ere was a 
chapter on colonizing the moon and using helium-3 for fusion power.  
Q You recently did a screening of Moon for NASA employees. What 
was the reception like?
A  It was fantaﬆic. [PM editorial advisory board member and former 
aﬆronaut] Tom Jones said that one of the things I got right was the 
mundaneness of working in that environment. You do a lot of really bor-
ing ﬆuﬀ again and again. 
Q Why did you choose to put the base on the dark side of the moon 
when there’s more helium-3 on the near side?
A  at came up at NASA. My reason is that when you ﬆart harveﬆing 
helium-3, you’re scooping up the ﬁrﬆ few inches of lunar regolith and 
bringing it into the harveﬆing machine, cooking it to release the gas, 
and then kicking the debris out the back. Because it’s going through 
the cooking process, there will be chemical changes. at’s going to 
aﬀe, possibly, the reﬂeivity of what’s kicked out—literally changing 
the reﬂeivity of the moon. What’s that going to do to wildlife or 
things back on Earth? Do you want to take [that] risk on the near side?

Mating on the breeding ground 
begins at dawn, so University of 
California–Davis assiﬆant professor 
Gail Patricelli has to have her female 
sage-grouse robot out of the concealing 
blind and ready to be wooed by suitors 
before the sun is up. Scientiﬆs like 
Patricelli are using animal doppelgän-
gers to decode creature behavior and 
communication based on how real 
beaﬆs respond to a robot’s manner-
isms. Patricelli, who is ﬆudying sexual 
seleion, outﬁtted her bird bot with a 
video camera and microphone to 
capture males’ auditory and visual cues. 
“I can use the robot to mimic a 
particular female signal or behavior and 
then see whether males that are more 
responsive are also more successful in 
courtship,” Patricelli says. Sure, the 
robot has wheels inﬆead of legs, but 
that doesn’t bother the males—they 
routinely mate with cow pies. 
Other Automated-Animal Research  
+ BEES In the early 1990s, Axel Michelson at the University of 
Southern Denmark built a robotic honeybee to teﬆ the 
hypothesis that real bees communicate direions to ﬂowers 
using a dance. He was able to conﬁrm the idea, despite using a 
robot that didn’t look like a bee—it was larger and had one wing. 
e experiment took place within the darkened environment of a 
hive, so the oddball appearance didn’t alienate other bees.
+ SQUIRRELS Sarah Partan, an assiﬆant professor at Hampshire 
College, built a robotic Eaﬆern gray squirrel that uses visual and 
audio signals to better underﬆand communication between real 
squirrels. At UC Davis, graduate ﬆudent Aaron Rundus used a 
robotic California ground squirrel to ﬆudy a tail-ﬂagging display 
that squirrels use to intimidate rattle and gopher snakes. 
+ LIZARDS Indiana University professor Emília Martins is using a 
robot to ﬆudy how lizards rea to displays of courtship and 
aggression. Both in the lab and in the wild, real lizards responded 
to the faux lizard’s push-up displays and head bobs.

Low-tech underwater mines are easy to place undeteed, but are 
powerful enough to damage modern warships. To clear these hazards, 
Northrop Grumman is developing a helicopter-based technology, called the 
Rapid Airborne Mine Clearance Syﬆem (RAMICS). It locates mines with laser 
scanners and deﬆroys them with supercavitating cannon rounds that can cut 
through water (which is about a thousand times as dense as air), thanks to a 
carefully designed blunt tip. “e tip creates a shock wave that vaporizes the

dry tube of vapor slightly wider than itself, and can detonate mines at depths 
greater than 40 feet. e next ﬆage in the program is to mount the gun and

Because the iPhone 
has no inherent ability 
to ﬁnd plumb, it muﬆ 
be calibrated on a 
known plumb surface. 
“But you’d need to 
measure whether it’s

have those tools, why 
would you use this?” 
Roy says.
Caliper jaws grip an

it if it isn’t precise?” 
Roy says.
Real levels have ﬂat

e iPhone’s edges

Skilled wakeboarders skate across the 
water’s surface at 25 mph before ﬂying  
as high as 8 feet in the air. But the 
intensity of wakeboarding masks the  
fa that it’s aually pretty easy to learn. 
“By the end of the ﬁrﬆ day you’ll be able 
to hit the wake and get some air , no 
problem,” 16-year veteran wakeboarder 
Zane Schwenk says. Here are the skills 
and gear you need to get ﬆarted. 
BY MARK ANDERS 
1. Start in the water, ﬂoating on 
your back with the board 
perpendicular to the rope. Your 
arms should be around your 
bent knees, with both hands 
gripping the handle (like a 
baseball catcher’s squat). Keep 
your eyes focused on the boat. 
2. As the boat begins to pull, let 
your hips slide to your ankles 
and your cheﬆ to your knees. 
Don’t muscle it—the boat will 
pull you up. Slowly rise with 
your back ﬆraight, move the 
handle in front of your lead hip 
and let the board turn until it’s in 
line with the towrope. 
3. While riding, keep your knees 
bent slightly with your cheﬆ up 
and hold the handle in front of 
your leading hip. “Let the boat 
do all the work,” Schwenk says.
q
qq
  The trick is called a roast 
beef—it’s a midair, between-the-
legs grab of the back of the board. 
Practice, and maybe one day ...
2. Raise your front foot up 
slightly so you don’t bury the 
nose of the board when it  
lands. As you ﬂy, keep your 
cheﬆ up and bend your knees  
to turn them into impa-
absorbing shocks.
1. As you begin to cut toward 
the wake, ﬁx your gaze on an 
obje across it. Gradually 
increase the speed and angle of 
your cut as you approach the 
wake, and extend your knees 
fully as you hit the top. 
Now for the fun part: getting air. 
Amateur jumpers should 
shorten the rope to around  
55 or 60 feet. “e shorter your 
rope, the narrower the wake, so 
you can jump it a lot easier,” 
Watson says.

 1. Helmet  
Pro-Tec  
Two Face ($70)
Moﬆ riders ﬆill 
eschew helmets, 
but they can be 
lifesavers. “Make 
sure it ﬁts snug so 
it doesn’t catch the 
water and ‘bucket’ 
when you fall,” 
Schwenk says.
 2. Personal  
 Flotation Device  
CWB Essential Veﬆ 
($80)
e beﬆ wake-
boarding veﬆs are 
neoprene with 
segmented foam 
for ﬂexibility,
Watson says. Veﬆs 
ﬆretch out in the 
water, so look for  
a snug ﬁt.
3. Boots and  
 Binding  
CWB Torq ($245)
e moﬆ important 
faor in a binding is 
how easy it is to slip 
your foot in and out. 
sN\
Dry-Land Practice: Before hitting the lake, sit on the ground in the catcher position with your feet shoulder-width apart, 
knees together and arms straight, holding the handle. Have a friend be the boat and slowly pull the rope until you stand up.
1. To swipe back and forth 
across the wake, turn your 
shoulders and hips so they are 
more open to the boat. Look 
where you want to go and 
move the handle slightly to the 
inside of your forward-facing 
hip, while transferring your 
weight to your heels. 
3. To cut back in the other 
direion, slowly press your toes 
down and push your knees 
forward toward the water. Turn 
your shoulders and hips in the 
direion you want to cut.
is set has a hinge 
syﬆem that ﬂips 
down for easy 
entry. And while 
moﬆ boots and 
bindings ﬁt a range 
of sizes, it’s beﬆ to 
choose one that 
closely matches 
your ﬆreet-shoe 
size. “Lots of 
injuries come from 
loose heels,” 
Schwenk says.
  4. Board  
Liquid Force Trip 
($260)
Beginners should 
look for a board 
with gently rounded 
rails and medium-
size ﬁns —it will be 
easy to handle, yet 
the rider won’t 
outgrow it aer a 
little praice.  
5. Rope  
 and Handle 
Straight Line Benny 
G Rope ($130), 
Straight Line Benny 
G Pro Handle ($80)
Nonﬆretch 
urethane-coated 
ropes like this are 
the gold ﬆandard, 
and the handle’s 
EVA foam grip 
negates the need 
for gloves.
 6. Boat  
MaﬆerCra X-1 
($53,390) 
While you can ride 
behind juﬆ about 
anything that can 
pull you at 25 mph, 
the beﬆ wake-
boarding boats 
have inboard 
motors (their 
wakes are cleaner 
and crisper than an 
outboard motor’s 
relatively frothy 
output, which can 
easily catch board 
tips), a tow tower 
for added upward 
li, ballaﬆ tanks to 
add weight for a 
larger wake, and 
cruise control to 
keep wakeboarders 
at a ﬆeady speed. 
MaﬆerCra’s X-1 
features a 310-hp 
(upgradable to 
350) 5.7-liter 
engine, is built 
around the world’s 
beﬆ-selling 
wakeboard hull, 
and is known for 
producing thick, 
well-deﬁned wakes.
2. As you cross the wake, keep 
your knees bent. “Don’t ﬆeer 
with the rope,” says Shawn 
Watson, two-time national 
wakeboarding champion. “Keep 
the rope at your hip and your 
arms ﬆraight. It’s more of a 
lower-body movement.”

Few motorsports are as deﬁnitively American as ﬂat-track racing. And the 
Harley-Davidson XR-750 dominated the sport. is year, Harley launches 
an homage to that legendary machine: the $10,799 XR1200. e XR1200 
injes some mojo into the Sportﬆer line with a more powerful engine and 
an aggressive suspension. For the traditional, air-cooled, pushrod 1200-cc 
V-twin, Harley bumped the compression ratio to 10:1 and added perfor-
mance cams and eleronic fuel injeion. It’s comfortable, easy to ride and 
exudes the kind of charaer that could only come from Harley- Davidson. 
e ﬁrﬆ batch of 750 bikes is available in Harley’s classic orange-and-black 
livery. We’re so smitten by this bike, we asked Harley if they could give one 
away to a lucky PM reader. You can win one and receive Harley-Davidson 
Rider’s Edge training (where available) too. To enter and to read all the

2010 VW GTI 
Base Price

e GTI’s primary objeive is simple—deliver a high-oane hoot at a 
reasonable price. And the new GTI hits that mark easily. e car feels familiar 
from behind the wheel, since it shares much with its immediate forebear. e 
smooth, elaﬆic power delivery of the 207-hp turbocharged Four is a treat, as 
is the profound surge of acceleration that greets a deep dig at the throttle. 
But the GTI now combines that friskiness with unexpeed poise, bridging 
Prime 
Mover
the gap between aﬀordable fun and sophiﬆicated motoring. As a nod to 
GTI tradition, the grille incorporates a red ﬆripe and the cloth seats are 
hipﬆer plaid. e GTI’s enviable combination of sportiness, solidity and 
economy (an eﬆi mated 32 mpg) should dispel any notion that GTIs are 
merely rude performance hatchbacks.  — BARRY WINFIELD

Old-School
Triumph’s retro Bonneville has 
successfully captured the look and 
ﬂavor of one of the world’s moﬆ iconic 
motorcycles. e new $8399 SE model 
gains fuel injeion, alloy wheels, a 
lower seat and dual megaphone-ﬆyle 
exhauﬆs—juﬆ like the sporty ruxton. 
e 865-cc motor creates a broad, ﬂat 
plateau of torque, so downshis are 
seldom needed for passing maneuvers. 
A good rider on a Bonneville SE will 
surprise a few sportbikes in the right 
circumﬆances. But this Bonnie’s real 
forte is the easygoing Sunday cruise. 
e big twin generates 51 lb- of

moderate engine speeds, with juﬆ 
enough of a mechanical pulse coming

How does Lamborghini improve the 
already ﬁerce LP 560-4? Ditch the 
roof. e 552-hp Spyder commands a 
ﬆaggering $224,700 price tag. And 
that’s not counting the $10,000 
eGear transmission, or goodies like 
the $26,000 matte paint. Yikes. So 
our drive on Tenerife—the largeﬆ of 
the Canary Islands—was like Lambor-
ghini fantasy camp. Driving from sea 
level to the top of the Pico de Teide 
volcano, the higheﬆ point in Spain, we 
encountered plenty of hairpin turns to 
challenge the Spyder’s chassis. Once 
the front tires bite and the suspension 
settles, grip from all four is extreme. 
And that sonorous exhauﬆ note spills 
onto the landscape, making any public 
road sound like Le Mans. e ﬂow of 
combuﬆed exhauﬆ gases produces 
an aural mashup that’s juﬆ as 
intoxicating as the engine’s incredible

e new Camaro is the darling of the muscle car set. But can the Muﬆang Shelby 
GT500 bury it in a cloud of tire smoke? We brought our VBOX teﬆ gear to Inﬁneon 
Raceway in Sonoma, Calif., to ﬁnd out. Before we hit the track, we had a chance to 
drive the GT500 on the nearby mountain roads where this Muﬆang simply shone. 
ere’s a certainty to the car’s handling that was missing before. It cuts into corners 
conﬁdently and crisply, yet it has more of the visceral thrill we want in a pony car.  
e supercharger is quieter now, so the burbly exhauﬆ is more audible. e  
ﬆeering is quick and light. Back at the track, a ﬆiﬀ head wind guﬆed ﬆraight down 
the dragﬆrip, so our acceleration times are not perfe indicators of what the  
GT500 can do. Still, it was quick, trouncing the quarter-mile in 12.63 seconds. e  
Camaro SS we teﬆed in Detroit ran a 13.0—ﬂat. So in a drag race between the two, 
the much more expensive Shelby wins.  — LARRY WEBSTER

It’s not hard to ﬁnd the drawbacks of 
Tesla’s eleric Roadﬆer. ough the 
sports car is quick, its two-seat 
conﬁguration and $109,000 price tag 
help keep it out of moﬆ garages. But 
Tesla CEO Elon Musk wants the  
Model S to change that. By late 2011, 
Tesla plans to oﬀer an eleric sedan 
that seats seven and hits 60 mph in 
under 6 seconds. e ﬆandard 
42-kilowatt-hour battery pack is said 
to contain roughly 8000 lithium-ion 
cells—the Roadﬆer uses 6831. On a 
per cell basis, the batteries are 
eﬆimated to produce a 20 percent 
volumetric improvement in eﬃciency 
over the Roadﬆer. Batteries will be 
available in 160-mile, 230-mile or 
300-mile ranges, with the sedan’s 
$57,400 price tag based on the 
entry-level 160-mile-range setup. 
at’s not an inexpensive automobile. 
But the ﬁgure does dip to $49,900 
aer the maximum $7500 federal tax 
credit for eleric vehicles kicks in. 
Tesla seems to have weathered some 
serious technical challenges that 
plagued its Roadﬆer, and the Model S 
appears promising. But, looking ahead, 
a ramp-up of EVs and plug-in hybrids 
from the major automakers could 
challenge Tesla’s turf.  — BASEM WASEF

Inside the printer, the print head 
goes back and forth, back and forth, 
putting on layer after layer of plastic 
to form a 3D part. If there are any 
irregularities in the originals, you 
can remove them using software. 
Once the model is finished, any 
excess support material between 
moving parts is dissolved in a water-
based solution. Complexity doesn’t 
matter, but the size of the object 
does determine the length of the 
process. Making a little part might 
take 5 hours. The White’s feedwater 
ne of the hardships of owning an old car is 
rebuilding rare parts when there are simply no 
replacements available. My 1907 White 
Steamer has a feedwater heater, a part that 
bolts onto the cylinders. It’s made of alumi-
num, and over the 100-plus years it’s been in 
use, the metal has become so porous you can 
see steam and oil seeping through. I thought 
we could just weld it up. But it’s badly impreg-
nated with oil and can’t be repaired. If we tried, 
the metal would just come apart.
So, rather than have a machinist try to copy 
the heater and then build it, we decided to rede-
sign the original using our NextEngine 3D scan-
ner and Dimension 3D printer. These incredible 
devices allow you to make the form you need to 
create almost any part. The scanner can measure about 50,000 points per sec-
ond at a density of 160,000 dots per inch (dpi) to create a 
highly detailed digital model. The 3D printer makes an 
exact copy of a part in plastic, which we then send out to 
create a mold. Some machines can even make a replace-
ment part in cobalt-chrome with the direct laser sintering 
process. Just feed a plastic wire—for a steel part you use 
metal wire—into the appropriate laser cutter.

YOU CAN TAKE AN ACTUAL CRESCENT WRENCH, 
FOR EXAMPLE, SCAN IT, THEN PRESS A BUTTON, 
COPY IT, AND MAKE A NEW WRENCH.
heater required 33 hours. 
Any antique car part can be repro-
duced with these machines—pieces 
of trim, elaborately etched and even 
scrolled door handles. If you have 
an original, you can copy it. Or you 
can design a replacement on the 
computer, and the 3D printer makes 
it for you. 
People say, “Why not just give the 
part to your machinist to make?” 
Well, if the machinist makes it 
wrong, you still have to pay for 
it. The scanner allows you to make 
an exact copy in plastic, ﬁt it and see 
that it’s correct. Even when you 
take plans to a machinist, it can be 
tricky. Say the part must be 3 mm 
thick here and 5 mm there. You get 
it back and then, “Oh no, it doesn’t 
ﬁt; it’s too thick,” or “It’s too thin.” 
My setup lets you create the perfect 
part. And you could press the button 
again and again—and keep making 
the part—twice the size, half-size, 
whatever you need. If you have a part 
that’s worn away, or has lost a big 
chunk of metal, you can ﬁll in that 
missing link on the computer. Then 
you make the part in plastic and 
have a machinist make a copy based 
on that example. Or you can do 
what we do—input that program 
into a Fadal CNC machine; it reads 
the dimensions and replicates an 
exact metal copy.
Some guys are so used to work-
ing in the traditional ways. They’re 
old-school. So they’ve never seen 
this new technology in use—in fact, 
they’re not even aware it exists. 
When you work on old cars, you 
tend to work with old machinery 
like lathes, milling machines or 
English wheels. When someone 
tells you that you can take a crescent 
wrench, for example, scan it, then 
press a button, copy it, and make a 
new wrench, these guys say, “Well, 
that’s not possible. You can’t make 
the little wheel that moves the claw 
in and out. You’d have to make it in 
two sections.” 
But they’re wrong. You can dupli-
cate the whole tool.
They stand in front of the 
machine and watch a wrench being 
made, and they still don’t believe it. 
It’s like The Jetsons. George Jetson 
would say, “I want a steak dinner.” 
He’d press a button and the meal 
would come out of the machine, 
with the roasted potatoes and every-
thing, all on one plate. We may not 
have the instant steak dinner yet—
but my NextEngine system is like 
the car-guy equivalent.  
If you had a one-off Ferrari 
engine, you could scan each part 
and then re-create the entire motor. 
Right now, we’re scanning a 
Duesenberg body. It’s a classic 
example of high tech melding with 
old tech. There are cars sitting in 
garages around the country, and 
they haven’t moved in years for lack 
of some unobtainable part. Now 
they can hit the road once more, 
thanks to this technology.
My 1907 White engine would 
never have run again because its 
slide valve (or D-valve) was shot. We 
built that part, and now the car is 
back on the street. 
Let’s say you have an older Cadil-
lac or a Packard, and you can’t get 
one of those beautifully ornate door 
handles. You could go to the big 
swap meet in Hershey, Pa., every day 
for the rest of your life and never 
ﬁnd it. Or you could take the one on 
the left side of your car, copy it, use 
the computer to reverse it, and put 
that new part on the other side.
It’s an amazingly versatile tech-
nology. My EcoJet supercar needed 
air-conditioning ducts. We used 
plastic parts we designed, right out 
of the 3D copier. We didn’t have to 
make these scoops out of alumi-
num—plastic is what they use in a 
real car. And the ﬁnished ones look 
like factory production pieces.
When I was in high school, a 
friend’s father bought the new 
Pulsar LED watch. He paid $2200 
for it. It had a red face; you pressed 
a button, it lit up and gave you the 
time. The next year I bought a simi-
lar watch from Texas Instruments 
for $19.99. I went over and showed 
it to my friend’s dad, and he was 
sooo angry.
The NextEngine scanner costs 
$2995. The Dimension uPrint Per-
sonal 3D printer is now under 
$15,000. That’s not cheap. But this 
technology used to cost 10 times 
that amount. And I think the price 
will come down even more.
These machines are not suited 
for mass production, but they work 
well for rapid prototyping. Just as 
eBay has made many swap meets go 
away, this machine could eliminate 
the need to go to eBay for parts. 
Think about it: What old part do you 
want to make?

hours. The junk was in the 
orbital path of the Hubble 
Space Telescope and just 
250 miles higher than the 
orbit of the International 
Space Station.
It was the ﬁrst time two 
satellites were known to 
have collided, which is 
remarkable considering 
there are about 3000 of 
them circling the Earth. 
And orbiting with the sats 
are an estimated 16,000 
other man-made objects, 
mostly junk. Depending 
on the height of orbit—
the  higher the debris, the 
 longer it takes to decay—
fragments may linger in 
space for centuries. 
If enough debris accu-
mulates, we risk setting 
off a chain reaction called 
the Kessler syndrome, in 
which satellite fragments 
damage other satellites, 
producing more debris 
and so on, until low Earth 
orbit (LEO) is so cluttered 
that satellite use and 
space travel become 
impossible. With LEO get-
ting messier by the day, the February 
collision raises a thorny legal ques-
tion: Who is responsible for dam-
ages caused by collisions in space?
Contrary to widespread opinion, 
outer space is not a lawless region. 
In fact, it’s governed by international 
law—and, in the case of U.S. space-
craft, or the U.S. parts of the Interna-
tional Space Station, by American 
law. Damage to and by spacecraft is 
covered by the 1972 Convention on 
International Liability for Damage 
Caused by Space Objects. Under that 
treaty, liability for damage caused to 
people or property on the ground  
lose calls in orbit happen all the time— 
scientists estimate that launch vehicles and oth-
er objects come within striking distance of one 
other over 1000 times a day. So when tracking 
reports on Feb. 10, 2009, predicted that Iridium 
33, a 12-foot-long, 1200-pound communications 
satellite, and a 1-ton Russian military sat, 
 Kosmos 2251, would pass within less than half a 
mile of each other, no one was alarmed. It wasn’t 
the closest call predicted for that day, or even the 
closest pass for any of the 66 Iridium satellites 
that coming week. But at the time of the pre-
dicted approach, Iridium 33 fell silent. 
The two satellites had collided 500 miles 
above Siberia at 26,000 mph, generating a debris 
cloud that spread around the Earth in just a few

WE NEED A FEW RULES  
OF THE ROAD BEFORE  
DEAD SATS AND ORBITING 
JUNK TURN SPACE INTO  
A NO-FLY ZONE. 


IF ENOUGH DEBRIS ACCUMULATES, WE RISK SETTING 
OFF A CHAIN REACTION—THE KESSLER SYNDROME—
THAT WOULD MAKE SPACE TRAVEL IMPOSSIBLE. 
52  J U LY  2 0 0 9   |   P O P U L A R M E C H A N I C S . C O M
is “absolute”—meaning that the 
 country that launched the spacecraft 
is liable for damages even if there 
was no negligence. The same is true 
if a space object strikes an aircraft. If 
you operate a spacecraft, you must 
realize it can do damage wherever it 
crashes. Expecting people on the 
ground to be on guard against crash-
ing satellites is asking a bit much. 
When it comes to sats in space, 
however, things aren’t so straight-
forward. When one spacecraft col-
lides with another, there’s only lia-
bility if the spacecraft operator is 
negligent. But what constitutes neg-
ligence in this context is not clear. 
Operating a spacecraft in a way that 
poses a foreseeable risk to others 
probably qualiﬁes, but in this case 
the Russian satellite was described 
as defunct, meaning that it had 
either broken down or run out of 
maneuvering fuel. There are many 
such satellites in orbit, and although 
good practice calls for their opera-
tors to either deorbit them or boost 
them into harmless parking orbits, 
this is not always possible. There are 
no standards in place that require 
space operators to ensure that satel-
lites don’t remain in high-traffic 
orbits at the end of their lives, so it 
would be hard to argue that failure 
to do so constitutes negligence.
One way to prevent space colli-
sions is better trafﬁc control. Right 
now, satellite operators don’t have 
precise orbital parameters for satel-
lites that might pose a risk of colli-
sion. Only a few countries—chieﬂy 
the United States, and to some 
degree Russia and China, as well as 
Europe—have access to precise 
tracking data, and that information 
is kept secret lest it reveal details 
about the sophisticated instrumen-
tation used to gather it. Military 
planners have long talked about the 
need for “space situational aware-
ness,” and the military tracks satel-
lites for its own purposes, but the 
increasingly crowded nature of near-
Earth orbits, plus the threat posed by 
collision debris, has led many to 
argue that we need similar tracking 
capability for the civilian sector. The 
cheap way to do this is to make some 
of the military data public; the 
expensive way would be to build a 
separate civilian system. 
Planners in the U.S. and other 
militaries have good reason to want 
to keep adversaries guessing about 
their surveillance capabilities. But 
they also have good reason not to 
want to see space ﬁlled with debris 
that is as deadly to their own satel-
lites as it is to civilian craft. The 
European Space Agency is working 
on a plan to track 1000 satellites in 
order to prevent collisions, and all 
nations that send craft to space 
should ensure that initial orbits are 
carefully chosen with an eye toward 
reduced risk of collision. 
But even if these good practices 
don’t come to pass, there’s another 
way to deal with space junk: Clean it 
up. Specialized spacecraft are 
designed to rendezvous with intact, 
nonoperational satellites and take 
them back to Earth or place them in 
safer orbits. Cleaning up fragments 
is much harder. Even small debris 
traveling at tremendous velocities 
can wreck a spacecraft, but it’s impos-
sible to rendezvous with a paint speck 
or a lug nut. Some have proposed 
incinerating debris with lasers, or 
capturing it with big blobs of orbiting 
aerogel. But these and other solu-
tions are expensive and may produce 
more debris from collisions.
Complicating an already com-
plex situation is the fact that debris 
fragments are often from unidentiﬁ-
able sources, and who should be 
responsible for getting rid of the 
mess is a gray area. Some scholars, 
including me, have proposed that 
countries be taxed for debris clean-
up based on the amount of material 
left in orbit, but such proposals 
remain purely academic.
Unfortunately, current space law 
doesn’t allow for the best possible 
space-junk solution: salvage. Under 
the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, nations 
retain “jurisdiction and control” over 
their spacecraft even when they are 
inoperable—so a salvage company 
wouldn’t be able to take title or claim 
an award for recovering a defunct 
craft, as is done on Earth. A space  
salvage law might even help com-
mercial space efforts by providing yet 
another moneymaking option; gov-
ernments, or insurance companies, 
could pay private operators a bounty 
for eliminating space junk. Though 
space lawyers have been arguing for 
years that the proliferation of space 
junk makes some sort of salvage law 
necessary, and despite the obvious 
commercial bene ﬁts, there has been 
little progress. 
What’s clear is that space is get-
ting crowded, and the problem 
urgently needs attention from all 
spacefaring nations, lest we ﬁnd our-
selves earthbound under a shroud of 
orbiting trash.

a blip of white over Kasatochi—
distinct from the gray storm clouds 
blanketing the Aleutians—indicating 
that the volcano had just vomited mil-
lions of cubic feet of ash. Hurricane-
force convective currents were lifting 
the ash at 1 to 2 miles per minute, 
45,000 feet into the sky.
Another monitor showed as many 
as a dozen planes headed toward the 
area; some were due to arrive within 
minutes. If they encountered the 
plume, it could mean disaster: The 
ﬁne-grained pumice in volcanic ash 
can stall a jet engine within 60 sec-
onds. Planes don’t carry instruments 
that can detect ash, and by the time a 
pilot spots an ash cloud, it’s too 
late—jets travel 9 miles per minute.
Staff at AVO ofﬁces in Fairbanks 
and Anchorage rushed calls to the 
Federal Aviation Administration, the 
Alaska Division of Homeland Secu-
rity and Emergency Management 
and a dozen other agencies. Alerts 
reached pilots within minutes, 
enabling them to change course.
Scientists tracked Kasatochi’s 
plume—a mixture of ash and 1.5 
million tons of sulfur dioxide gas—
via satellite over several days. It 
drifted toward Juneau, Alaska, where 
airlines cancelled more than 40 
ﬂights. Farther west, a 737 carrying 
passengers over Canada lost cabin 
pressure twice after ﬂying through 
dilute ash. The jet stream stretched 
the volcanic cloud into a shadow that 
curved across North America. Pilots 
as far east as Chicago adjusted their 
routes to avoid it. The cloud con-
tained sulfuric acid aerosols capable 
of etching plane windows, corroding 
paint and nauseating passengers. 
AVO’s system worked well. But for 
Dehn, it was a reminder of the need 
to watch volcanoes—every volcano—
at all times. “Kasatochi was a sur-
prise,” he says. “We were very lucky.”
International flights crossing the 
ocean into Anchorage airspace have 
swelled by 83 percent since 1990, to 
73,000 flights per year—making 
Anchorage the world’s ﬁfth-busiest 
air-cargo hub. But few people ﬂying 
from Asia to North America realize 
their trip takes them over one of the 
most violent volcanic arcs on Earth.
Subduction of the Aleutian plate 
forces more than 20 million tons of 
rock under the island chain daily, 
fueling an arc of 160 volcanoes that 
stretches from Alaska, across the 
Aleutians, to the Kamchatka Penin-
sula of Russia. As the rock melts into 
viscous, silica-rich magma, it traps 
thousands of tons of water. When the 
magma reaches the surface, the water 
becomes steam and bursts like bub-
bles from a soda can, making the vol-
canoes especially explosive.
“Twenty-ﬁve thousand people and 
a billion dollars of cargo ﬂy over these 
volcanoes every single day,” Dehn 
says. “It’s been described as a shoot-
ing gallery.” AVO’s mission is to moni-
tor volcanic activity, track ash clouds 
and give ample warning to air trafﬁc. 
The need for such vigilance became 
clear after what could have been one 
of the worst air disasters in history. 
When Redoubt Volcano erupted 
on Dec. 15, 1989, KLM Flight 867 was 
en route to Anchorage from Amster-
dam with 245 people on board. As 
the 747 descended through a cloud, 
nearly 200 miles from the eruption, 
sulfur and smoke stung the pilots’ 
nostrils. Then all four engines failed. 
The turbines had ingested abrasive 
ash—tiny shards of volcanic glass 
melted in the engines and resolidi-
ﬁed into lumps, choking the air sup-
ply. “We have ﬂameout, all engines,” 
co-pilot Imme Visscher barked into 
the radio. “We are in a fall!” 
After the plane dropped 13,000 
feet, Visscher managed to restart two 
engines, then the other two. She and 
her crew ﬂew the crippled craft over 
the peaks of the Alaska mountain 
range to Anchorage, squinting to see 
through windows blasted by micro-
scopic pumice. 
The KLM incident was not the ﬁrst 
close call—or the last. “There have 
been more than 100 encounters of 
aircraft with ash clouds since the 
early 1970s,” says Marianne Guffanti, 
a volcanologist at the U.S. Geological 
Survey in Reston, Va. The ﬁrst known 
incident involved a civilian C-130 that 
temporarily lost power to two of four 
engines when Mount St. Helens 
erupted in 1980. At least eight planes 
have experienced similar mechanical

problems since, including two com-
mercial aircraft over the Philippines 
in 1991 and a research jet over Papua 
New Guinea in 2006. But the KLM 
incident highlighted just how dra-
matic and close to home the threat 
could be. Prior to that event, AVO—
then only a year old—used its budget 
to place a few monitoring instru-
ments near Cook Inlet; when the 
Observatory got full funding in the 
mid-’90s, scientists decided to fully 
instrument Redoubt ﬁrst.
Of the 160 volcanoes the Alaska 
Volcano Observatory monitors, 60 
have the potential to erupt at any 
time—and only 30 of those volcanoes 
have seismic networks. Seismo-
graphs can pick up tremors signaling 
a potential eruption days in advance, 
allowing scientists to watch the 
volcanoes closely and alert nearby 
pilots within 5 minutes of the actual 
eruption—the FAA’s ofﬁcial goal.  
To monitor the other volcanoes, 
AVO relies on satellite observation. 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration satellites carry the  
Advanced Very High Resolution Radi-
ometer, an imager that can detect 
infrared “thermal anomalies” as a 
volcano’s belly swells with 1500 F 
magma. The ozone-monitoring Aura 
satellite can track clouds of sulfur 
dioxide burped out by volcanoes. And 
satellites like GOES and POES, or 
Polar Operational Environmental Sat-
ellites, can spot new ash clouds. 
But relying on satellites involves 
an element of Russian roulette. 
Satellite passes over any given area 
may occur up to 5 hours apart—long 
enough for a crowded 747 to fly 
directly into a new ash plume. Clouds 
can obstruct satellites’ views; some 
Aleutian volcanoes are under cover 
300 days a year. “You may not see an 
area for many days in a row,” says 
Gary Hufford, a remote-sensing spe-
cialist at the National Weather Service 
in Anchorage. “All of a sudden it 
opens up and you see hotspots.” 
When Redoubt, 103 miles south-
west of Anchorage, rumbled back to 
life in early 2009, researchers seized 
the opportunity to experiment with 
new technologies. Steve McNutt, a 
volcano seismologist at AVO in Fair-
banks, placed four VHF radio-wave 
sensors across the Cook Inlet from 
Redoubt, 50 miles away. Heavy light-
ning occurs inside eruptive plumes, 
generated by static electricity as ash 
particles collide inside the cloud. The 
sensors measure the radio waves pro-
duced by each strike.
Redoubt erupted on March 22, 
coughing ash 60,000 feet into the air. 
McNutt’s instruments detected the 
eruption nearly instantly—picking up 
lightning that began as soon as ash 
started spewing from the crater. 
Nanosecond triangulation of the 
radio bursts pinpointed lightning 
bolts to an accuracy of 164 feet, allow-
ing McNutt to track the cloud for an 
hour as it drifted north. 
By measuring how bolts move 
through the plume, McNutt can 
determine how much ash comes 
out—information that’s crucial to 
forecasting how quickly ash will set-
tle and dilute as it drifts. A network 
of sensors like the one tested on 
Redoubt could alert AVO to erup-
tions at remote volcanoes, providing 
a backup to satellites. Because they 
don’t have to be as close to the source 
as seismometers, two dozen light-
ning sensors could monitor the 
entire Aleutian chain.
Meanwhile, a team that includes 
Fred Prata, a senior scientist at the 
Norwegian Institute for Air Research, 
in Kjeller, Norway, has built a proto-
type detector that distinguishes ash 
from water clouds based on infrared 
absorbance. Prata’s goal is to layer 
that information onto weather dis-
plays in the cockpit; ash clouds would 
be red and other clouds, blue. The 
detector could be effective 62 miles 
ahead at cruising altitudes. 
None of these technologies is fool-
proof. And though the stimulus plan 
just increased AVO funding, Dehn 
says they don’t plan to spend the 
money instrumenting every volcano. 
Instead, they hope to upgrade exist-
ing seismographs to broadband capa-
bility, which will help scientists get 
information more quickly—and will 
minimize the chance that an ash 
plume escapes detection and brings 
down an aircraft.

dumpster-size cargo container jutting 
from a building in Waltham, Mass., can 
heat and power 200,000 square feet of 
space on a daily diet of 3 tons of 
garbage. The $850,000 system, which

three years, according to Michael 
Cushman, vice president of IST Energy, 
which makes GEMs. It can save some 
540 tons of greenhouse gas emissions 
annually and—unlike much alt-energy 
tech—it’s ready now. “We welcome revo-

evolutionary solution with substantial 
potential for high impact,” Cushman 
says. “We don’t need a 10-year-off 
solution, we need a today solution.”

says its own system, Smart Starter, can 
boost a conventional car’s city-driving 
fuel economy by 8 percent. Carmakers 
won’t say how much such technology 
will raise prices, but the bump should 
be a fraction of the premium that hybrid

energy research, especially for batteries. 
But Craig Grimes, an electrical engineer at 
Penn State, has another use for them. In 
combination with sunlight, his nanotube 
membrane converts water and carbon 
dioxide into liquid fuel, such as butane and 
methane. If the technology were integrated 
into power plants, Grimes says, “it would 
basically be a closed loop—you have a fuel, 
you burn it, you collect the reactants, 
convert them back into fuel, and then feed 
that right back into the plant.” He 
calculates that 4 square inches of the 
current version of the membrane could 
yield more than 130 gallons of fuel daily, 
squeezing a second act out of hydrocar-
bons before they enter the atmosphere.
FIX CRUMBLING PIPES WITH 
SINUOUS ROBOTS
u Oil companies employ drones called 
“pigs” to crawl through pipelines, spotting 
corrosion. Fancier pipe bots are in 
development, destined for heroic feats 
such as shimmying through shattered 
plumbing to ﬁnd earthquake survivors. But 
the most useful job for such robots could 
be patrolling thousands of miles of leaking 
municipal water lines. One design group 
took the inspiration for its bloblike robot 
from amoebas, but most of the new bots 
resemble snakes. A Canadian robot called 
Regina Pipe Crawler (RPC) is nearing 
commercialization. Controlled remotely, 
RPC can inspect a bending 6-inch-
 diameter pipe while the water is ﬂowing at 
full strength. With enough pipe bots on the 
job, engineers could stop wasteful leaks 
and prevent catastrophic failures. 
DRIVE ON A HIGH LEVEL
u Road congestion gets worse every year, 
yet thousands of miles of highway—the 
medians, to be precise—go unused. 
According to bridge engineer Linda Figg, a 
gap just 6 feet across can support an 
elevated roadway three lanes wide. Figg’s 
Lee Roy Selmon Crosstown Expressway 
added three reversible lanes to a 15-mile 
stretch of median between Brandon, Fla., 
and downtown Tampa, cutting travel time 
from 45 minutes to as little as 20. Such 
bridges can also carry light rail—Figg’s 
AirTrain JFK project carries travelers above 
New York City’s Van Wyck Expressway to 
Kennedy Airport. The projects require little 
new grading and no seizures of property. 
“Look at data networks, the way they’ve 
been optimized,” Figg says. “They have 
higher speeds, they’re more efﬁcient, but 
we’re using the same networks. This is the 
same—we’re optimizing our corridors by 
building at multiple levels.” 
Cloak Buildings 
From Earthquakes
Like so many of the best 
things in life, the 
inspiration for cloaking 
technology comes from 
the Klingons, who used  
it on their starships. 
Researchers have had 
some success “cloaking” 
an object by redirecting 
light around it to render  
it invisible. But the 
principle might work even 
better to shield buildings 
from earthquake damage. 
The structures would 
incorporate “metamateri-
als” patterned with tiny 
circles whose size is 
proportional to the 
wavelength of seismic 
disturbances. The waves 
would travel along the 
material, missing the 
structure. REAL-WORLD

seems sound, but years 
of experimentation lie 
ahead. And engineers 
would then need to 
devise ways to build 
the technology into 
new buildings. 
(Retrofits would likely 
remain impossible.)
Teleport Data in 
Super Computers 
Star Trek–style 
teleporters will never, 
ever be invented. And 
that’s okay—after all, 
who would agree to be 
obliterated and then 
reconstituted by a guy 
named Scotty, trusting 
that no atom or eyeball 
was out of place? But 
scientists at the 
University of Maryland 
have teleported data, 
swapping the 
quantum states of two 
atoms positioned a 
meter apart. It was a 
step toward the 
creation of quantum 
computers, which 
could perform many 
simultaneous 
operations, crunching 
data exponentially 
faster than today’s 
systems. REAL-WORLD 
POTENTIAL: On a 
rudimentary level, the 
technology works now, 
but practical (let alone 
world-changing) 
quantum computing is 
decades in the future.
Mind-Meld With 
Machines
Who needs a joystick 
when that famously 
complex CPU between 
your ears can exert 
direct control over a 
machine? Miguel 
Nicolelis, co-director of 
Duke University’s 
Center for Neuroengi-
neering, has shown 
that monkeys can 
make robots walk 
simply by thinking. 
Next, he is focusing on 
sensory feedback. Sure, 
touch and vision would 
be nice, but Nicolelis 
hopes that human 
brains eventually can 
learn to interpret data 
from such diverse 
sources as magnetic 
sensors and infrared 
imaging systems, 
essentially developing 
new, machine-based 
senses. (Hey, the Borg 
can do it.)  
REAL-WORLD POTENTIAL: 
Within five years, 
Nicolelis plans to 
introduce a brain-
controlled, full-body 
exoskeleton to restore 
mobility to severely 
disabled patients. 
Potential applications 
are wide-ranging—
imagine surgeries 
being performed by  
a specialist from 
across the country. 
There’s an issue with 
user- friendliness, 
though—little of this 
cybernetic wizardry 
will come to pass until 
someone invents an 
interface that doesn’t 
require a cable to  
be implanted in the 
user’s brain.

Injection-Mold 
Custom Organs
Medical researchers 
are already growing 
human tissues, and 
even organs, in the lab. 
Then there’s Lawrence 
Bonassar. The 
assistant professor of 
biomedical engineer-
ing at Cornell 
University is producing 
custom body parts 
using Fab@Home, a 
3D lithography 
platform developed at 
Cornell. (Its inventors 
won a 2007 Popular 
Mechanics Break-
through Award.) 
Bonassar’s “ink” is a 
culture of living cells 
suspended in gel. For 
homogeneous organs, 
he can skip the printer, 
squirting biogel right 
into an injection mold. 
And since the cells 
originate with the 
patient, organ 
rejection is not an 
issue. PROGNOSIS: 
Human trials are years 
away, but rats can 
schedule back surgery 
right now—Bonassar’s 
team has already 
replaced spinal discs 
in rodents. 
Replace Suture 
Kits With Lasers
Lasers could replace 
old-fashioned needles 
and thread for 
suturing wounds and 
surgical incisions. A 
method devised by 
Abraham Katzir, head 
of Applied Medical 
Physics at Israel’s Tel 
Aviv University, 
involves slathering the 
target area with a 
protein, then tracing 
the wound with a 
carbon-dioxide laser. 
According to Katzir, 
the procedure reduces 
surgical scars, healing 
time and the chance of 
infection. PROGNOSIS: 
Katzir is preparing to 
use laser-bonding on 
hernia patients, and 
he hopes that the 
technology will soon 
be applied in eye and 
cosmetic surgery. His 
lab is also developing 
equipment that uses a 
smaller, diode 
laser—similar to the 
ones in DVD players. 
He envisions a 
flashlight-size system 
for emergency rooms 
and ambulances.
Stop Blood Loss 
With Ultrasound
The Deep Bleeder 
Acoustic Coagulation 
(DBAC) program may 
sound like tech from 
some cyberpunk novel, 
but it’s real engineer-
ing being developed 
with funding from 
DARPA, the Pentagon’s 
research wing. DBAC 
will locate severed 
arteries deep below 
the skin, then use 
ultrasonic waves to 
cauterize the rupture 
without affecting 
surrounding tissues. 
PROGNOSIS: DBAC's 
imaging step relies on 
proven technology, but 
the coagulation 
function would require 
extensive testing. 
DARPA hopes to unveil 
a prototype DBAC, 
designed as a cuff that 
can fit over an injured 
limb, by 2011.

KEEP WORKING ON FUSION, 
NO MATTER THE ODDS
u After decades spent watching short-
lived bursts of plasma sputter in research-
oriented magnetic tokamak reactors, it 
would be easy to abandon the dream of 
fusion power. But the ultimate clean- 
energy technology may be getting closer. 
ITER (the letters don’t stand for anything, 
but the word means “the way” in Latin) is 
expected to be the world’s biggest tokamak 
when it’s completed in southern France in 
2018, and it could lead to efﬁcient 
prototype power plants. Next year, the array 
of 192 lasers that form the heart of the 
National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Califor-
nia’s Lawrence Livermore National 
Laboratory will begin ﬁring at a tiny 
hydrogen target, testing a magnet-free 
fusion scheme. NIF director Ed Moses 
hopes that within a few years, the machine 
will release 20 times more energy than it 
consumes. “If this works, over the next 
couple of decades we can change the 
geopolitical story,” he says.  
TEST ANTI-ASTEROID TECH
uThis past March, a 154-foot-wide 
asteroid came within 48,800 miles of Earth, 
just twice the altitude of some satellites. It 
was big enough to destroy a city. No one 
saw it coming. Not that it would have 
helped: There’s no procedure in place for 
deﬂecting space rocks, just a list of 
concepts. But two astronauts—Rusty 
Schweickart, chairman of the Association 
of Space Explorers–Near Earth Object 
Committee, and Thomas D. Jones, a PM 
contributing editor—have a plan. (1) Build 
more asteroid-hunting telescopes. Projects 
that need more funding include a Cana-
dian space-based telescope and a series of 
ground-based systems in Hawaii. (2) Assign 
asteroid-deﬂection authority to an 
international committee. With no one in

charge, individual nations might launch 
Pyrrhic schemes: “In the past, there was a 
Russian proposal to have a 50-megaton 
nuclear missile in the silo, ready to launch 
at any asteroid that shows up,” Jones says. 
Bad idea—it could create a lethal storm of 
fragments. (3) Run a rehearsal mission. 
One plan is to park an unmanned space-
craft alongside the offending asteroid, 
while kinetic impactors—guided missiles 
minus the warheads—slam into it. The ﬁrst 
craft helps the impactors target the object 
and acts as a gravity tractor, using its mass 
to nudge the rock off course. If something 
really huge heads our way, we could always 
resort to that 50-megaton nuke tactic—
with luck the bomb would ignite gases in 
the asteroid that would spew outwards and 
nudge the rock from its apocalyptic path. 
SWAP OUT MPG FUEL
RATINGS FOR G/100M
uQuick, which is better: Replacing an 
18 mpg car with a 28 mpg ride, or going 
from 34 mpg to 50 mpg? Researchers say 
that drivers ﬁnd it easier to get the right 
answer when efﬁciency is expressed as 
gallons per 100 miles (g/100m). Eighteen 
mpg versus 28 mpg becomes 5.5 g/100m 
versus 3.6 g/100m, for a savings of 2 gallons 
every 100 miles. Going from 34 mpg to  
50 mpg is the same as switching from 2.9 
g/100m to 2 g/100m—only half as big a gain. 
Such ratings already are common in Europe. 
DEPLOY TINY ROBO-DOCS
u“Smart pills” designed to carry minia-
ture cameras or doses of medicine have 
been kicking around laboratories for years. 
Now researchers are homing in on a 
Lilliputian robot doctor that could do it all, 
combining diagnostic imaging with 
targeted drug delivery, while precisely 
navigating a patient’s digestive track. A 
model from Pittsburgh’s Carnegie Mellon 
University anchors itself within the body 
using adhesives, while another device 
(invented in Germany) is guided by magnets 
outside the body. When such bots hit 
clinics, they should make biopsies easier, 
and colonoscopies mercifully obsolete.
NETWORK CARS WIRELESSLY
uCars are becoming chatterboxes. They 
intone directions, pause music to 
announce incoming calls, and soon will 
start reading e-mails aloud. But now GM, 
Volkswagen and other automakers want 
cars to talk quietly among themselves. 
Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications 
systems will enable cars to trade news of 
hazards such as black ice or a truck broken 
down on a blind curve. The information 
will be projected for drivers onto the 
windshield or shown on a dashboard 
display. V2V could also help steer drivers 
clear of trafﬁc snarls. Tests have been run 
in California and Germany; the next step is 
to agree on an industry-wide protocol.

OBSESSIVE HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND  
RENEWABLE ENERGY SYSTEMS BRING A  
CLASSIC RHODE ISLAND FIREHOUSE FROM THE 
19TH CENTURY STRAIGHT INTO THE 21ST.
Not your typical teardown. To reconﬆru this landmarked 
building, the homeowner used 3D laser imaging that measures, to 
within 2 millimeters, where the original bricks should be placed.
B Y  L I S A  P A L M E R

“THE ONLY THING KEEPING THE BRICKS IN PLACE WAS
gravity,” David Hacin says. Hacin, the architect in charge of 
preserving the historic Newport, R.I., firehouse, shared his 
observation with homeowner Clint Clemens shortly after 
removing the structure’s roof. Clemens peered inside the 
1-foot-thick outer wall to see for himself: The interior mortar, 
which had been made from local beach sand when the build-
ing was constructed in 1887, had turned to a ﬁne dust. 
Clemens and his wife have a history of living in unique 
homes. Their ﬁrst was an 800-square-foot converted chicken 
coop on the former farm of John Quincy Adams. More recently, 
they lived in a lighthouse in Tiverton, R.I. So when the ﬁre-
house appeared on the market in 2006, they could immediately 
picture themselves living there—only buying a historic land-
mark involved more work than they realized. “It’s like signing 
up for the military,” Clemens says. “You’re in it for four years.”
Known locally as Redwood Hose 8, the ﬁrehouse had last 
seen active duty in 1912. And although it was now a crumbling 
ruin, it sat smack in the middle of Historic Hill, Newport’s 
National Historic Landmark District, so simply demolishing it 
was not an option. Clemens, a commercial photographer and 
owner of a 3D imaging company, decided to preserve the build-
ing with the tools he knew best. Using a Faro 880 laser attached 
to a tripod, Clemens ﬁred off 30 million measurements along 
three sides of the home. This enabled him to create a 3D image 
of the two-story structure accurate to 2 millimeters—and to 
rebuild it with the same precision.
Contractors dismantled Hose 8 brick by brick, lowering the

masonry to the ground one bucket at a time, until nothing was 
left but the building’s foundation. Each brick was painstakingly 
cleaned, tested for strength and stored—until, as Hacin put it, 
the time came to “put Humpty Dumpty together again.”
Clemens was determined to reduce his new home’s carbon-
dioxide emissions to near zero. So to control the building’s cli-
mate, he chose to install a geothermal system that would take 
advantage of the natural temperature gradient deep under-
ground. That proved a challenge as well. First, a 55-foot-long 
truck had to be maneuvered up a one-way urban street. Then, 
for three long days, metal rammed earth, until the drill ﬁnally 
bored into a geothermal aquifer 850 feet below the surface. 
Relief from the noise came in the form of a geyser, shooting 
200 feet in the air at 150 gallons per minute.

Deconﬆruing the ﬁrehouse one brick at a time was a teﬆ of both 
patience and physics. Workers took measures to ﬆabilize joiﬆs (below) 
while removing individual bricks from the building’s exterior. Windows 
that couldn’t be salvaged were reproduced with exa details, down to 
the weighted sash and antique glass. “is is a hiﬆoric ﬆruure, a work 
of art,” Clemens says. “We are simply ﬆewards of the building, caring 
for it like you would a ﬁne painting.” More than a century of deterioration 
forced Clemens to work his way back to a blank canvas.

Aer Clint Clemens 
bought a 119-year-
old ﬁrehouse in 
Newport, R.I., to 
renovate for his 
home, he learned 
that the crumbling 
mortar meant the 
entire ﬆruure 
was unsound. 
Demolishing the 
hiﬆoric building 
wasn’t an option, 
so Clemens, vice 
president of the 3D 
imaging company 
Models From Mars, 
applied a high-tech 
solution to the 
century-old con-
ﬆruion problem. 
He measured the 
precise dimensions 
of the original ﬆruc-
ture with a Faro 
880 laser—then 
used the resulting 
3D image (below) to 
convince the town’s 
ﬁrmly preservation-
minded hiﬆoric 
commission that 
the ﬁrehouse 
could be totally 
dismantled and 
rebuilt to the same 
speciﬁcations.

salvaged for the 
reconﬆruion. 
e original walls 
were four layers 
thick, as opposed 
to one layer for the 
rebuild, so the tear- 
down produced 
thousands more 
bricks than needed.

the ﬂoors and to a forced-hot-air system. Flip a switch, and 
45 minutes later (as Clemens times it) the system pumps cool 
air into the home. Though the $32,000 geothermal system is 
considerably more expensive than traditional HVAC, a 30 per-
cent tax credit this year will offset the costs. Clemens estimates 
the system will pay for itself in six years and last more than 30.
A solar thermal array that sits discreetly on the roof supplies 
all of the home’s hot water; extra solar heat is redirected into 
radiant-heat ﬂooring in the basement. An exterior propane 
tank supplies fuel for the kitchen stove, and Clemens pur-
chases wind-generated power to supply all of the electricity.
Most of the wood in the home has been certiﬁed by the For-
est Stewardship Council, while other materials were repur-
posed from the original building—including many of the 
bricks, the roof capstones and a few of the windows. The brick 

house is so quiet, Clemens says, it’s “like you have a pillow over 
your ears.” The home has been engineered as a box, so the inte-
rior walls can be reconﬁgured based on the changing needs of 
the owners over time. Currently, the French doors of the top-
ﬂoor master bedroom open to a deck that overlooks the steeple 
of the neighboring Channing Memorial Church, built in 1880.
Clerestory windows, located high on the south wall of the 
ﬁrst and second ﬂoors, allow daylight to ﬁlter through the inte-
rior, reducing the need for electric lighting. Natural light from 
a copper-trimmed skylight ﬂoods the upper levels. 
It was supposed to be a straightforward renovation, but 
turning a former ﬁrehouse into a single-family home became a 
lesson in fortitude instead. Two and a half years later, Hose 8 is 
a cutting-edge green building—and, thanks to Clemens’s 3D 
vision, looks exactly like it did more than 100 years ago. 
FC
exterior is now a veneer covering a wooden structure—not four 
layers thick, as in the previous construction.
In order to preserve the building’s outward appearance, 
contractors poured a 19-inch-wide concrete trench inside the 
original ﬁeldstone foundation. Then, they installed a 1-inch-
thick steel plate that caps both structures. While Hose 8 
appears to sit atop its ﬁeldstone roots, that’s an illusion. The 
steel plate acts as a cantilever, so the building’s weight actually 
rests on the new concrete base. Stabilization rods extend from 
the roof to the foundation, ensuring that the house meets 
earthquake codes. It is also rated to withstand winds up to 200 
miles per hour. The home’s upgrades, Hacin says, “would have 
been impossible in renovating the existing building.” 
Inside, insulation packed into the walls increases efﬁciency 
while also mufﬂing sound. With no hum from a furnace, the

Mann and his girlfriend Helen were watching the sun go down after a satisfying 
day clearing brush in the backyard of Mann’s home in Sutter Creek, Calif. A pile of 
branches and twigs was burning merrily, throwing shadows into the growing dark-
ness as the couple’s three dogs—a 50-pound Shar-Pei named Tigger and a pair of 
Rottweiler mixes, Takota and Tenaya—played at their feet.
Mann’s home is the kind of place nature lovers dream of. The house is set back 
from the road on a densely wooded, 10-acre parcel bordered by government land 
and private property; wild turkeys and deer—up to a dozen at a time—wander 
through daily. Beyond the backyard lawn, 80 feet from the house, ponderosa and 
oak grow thickly on the steep slopes of a hill.
That February night, Helen heard crackling and snapping of underbrush and 
saw something large moving along the edge of the trees. When Tigger went to 
investigate, with Takota close behind, Mann didn’t stop them, even though he

destroy mission continued virtually unabated until the rise 
of the environmental movement in the 1960s and ’70s, when 
the national attitude began to evolve. People came to believe 
that what was left of wilderness and its inhabitants should 
be preserved for future generations. 
This ideology has clearly worked: Since the passage of the 
Endangered Species Act of 1973, 14 species of animals that 
were on the brink of extinction have recovered. Alligators were 
removed from the list in 1987; gray wolves in 2009. The grizzly 
bear, conﬁned mostly to Yellowstone National Park in the 
lower 48 states, was delisted in 2007. As for once heavily 
hunted mountain lions, some 50,000 of the big cats now 
inhabit North America, with populations in the United States 
as far east as North Dakota. Experts predict that lions eventu-
ally will reinhabit the Adirondacks in New York, the Maine 
woods and the Great Smoky Mountains of Tennessee.
Few people anticipated that rebounding populations 
would create a new problem: an increase in animal attacks as 
predators returned to former ranges now occupied by 
humans. In August 2002, a black bear killed a 5-month-old 
girl in the Catskills, a hundred miles northwest of New York 
City; the baby had been sleeping in a carriage on the porch. In 
January 2004, a mountain lion killed a male bicyclist in Whit-
ing Ranch Wilderness Park in Orange County, Calif., then 
attacked a 31-year-old woman a few hours later. Other bicy-
clists managed to save the victim, but not before she sus-
tained serious injuries. In October 2007, an alligator snatched 
and killed an 83-year-old woman outside her daughter’s home 
in Savannah, Ga. The next day, her body was found in a pond, 
hands and a foot missing. And, in May 2008, a coyote bit a 
2-year-old girl playing in a 
Chino Hills, Calif., park and 
attempted to drag her off.
Though the trend is wor-
risome, the absolute num-
ber of attacks remains 
small. Fatal black bear 
attacks on humans have 
doubled since the late 
1970s, increasing from one 
to just two incidents per 
year. (About six people are 
injured each year.) Between 
1890 and 2008, there were 
110 mountain lion attacks 
in North America; half of 
the 20 fatalities resulting 
from these attacks occurred 
in the past two decades. 
Despite an alligator popula-
tion too large to count, the 
U.S. had just 391 attacks 
and 18 fatalities between 
1948 and 2005. Coyotes 
have caused only one known 
fatality in the U.S. 
Still, the relationship 
between animals and 
knew mountain lions roamed the area. One had 
peered through his neighbor’s window, scaring 
the woman inside, and another neighbor had 
recently seen a big male lion in Mann’s driveway. 
“The lions come in pretty far,” Mann says. “Com-
mon sense would have said, don’t let the dogs go. 
But I’ve been living up here for eight years, and it’s 
rare that they attack dogs.”
Suddenly, the couple heard Tigger “screaming 
for her life,” Mann says. When he ran down to the 
edge of the woods, he could only see shadows and 
fleeting movement in the thick underbrush. 
Whatever was attacking the Shar-Pei growled at 
him. Takota rushed in, and then it was over—the 
animal released Tigger and took off. “We think 
Takota scared it,” Mann says. “It all happened in 
about 10 seconds.” 
Tigger’s injuries were serious. The skin over her 
head had been split open to the bone, her left eye 
almost torn out. Deep claw marks ran down her 
back. Mann held the wounds closed as he and 
Helen rushed Tigger to the vet, who conﬁrmed that 
the injuries had been caused by a mountain lion. 
Tigger survived, but since the incident Mann 
has kept the dogs out of the woods. “I’m still here 
and the lion is still here,” he says. “My neighbors 
said it was up at their property two nights ago. To 
attack a dog near a house when two adults are out 
in the yard with a ﬁre going—that’s when you have 
to start worrying. There are lots of kids just a cou-
ple of blocks from here.”

Animal attacks 
are rare, but

Here’s how to

big predators

Carolina down through Florida and west to Louisi-
ana and Texas. There, people have moved into the 
wetlands where alligators live, and they’ve created 
ponds and canals within subdivisions that alliga-
tors consider appealing habitats. 
In July 2008, 11-year-old Devin Funck and two 
friends escaped the stiﬂing Louisiana heat by tak-
ing a dip in Crystal Lake, a ﬂooded former gravel 
pit in a subdivision near Slidell. Funck was play-
ing in the shallows when an alligator grabbed his 
arm, dragged him to deeper water and pulled him 
under. After a struggle, Funck poked the gator in 
the eye and pulled free, but his left arm was gone, 
torn off at the shoulder. Friends ran for help, and 
within an hour emergency responders were rush-
ing the boy to hospital. 
According to local news reports, area residents 
knew the gator lived in the popular swimming 
hole; in fact, they had even given the 10-foot 
8-inch, 500-pound reptile a name—Big Joe. It took 
nearly 3 hours for hunters to ﬁnd and kill Big Joe 
and cut Funck’s bluish but intact arm from its 
stomach. Doctors were unable to reattach the 
limb, however, and Devin now wears a prosthesis. 
Experts can offer no explanation as to why the 
gator, which had patrolled Crystal Lake for years 
without incident, attacked Funck. And neither 
can residents: Two boys who often swam in the 
lake said that the alligators there usually swim 
away when approached. “The set of circumstances 
that takes a human–alligator interaction to the 
next step, to an attack—we don’t know what that 
trigger is,” says University of Florida professor 
and gator expert Frank Mazzotti.
humans is proving to be more complex than simply kill ’em all 
or love ’em all—even though some of the old, romantic ideas 
about living at one with nature linger. “If you ask people why 
they moved where they did, you discover that they moved to be 
immersed in nature and wildlife,” says Marc Bekoff, professor 
emeritus of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University 
of Colorado–Boulder. “The fastest way to decrease the experi-
ence is to start killing the animals.” 
Whether homeowners welcome large animals into their 
neighborhoods or see them as life-threatening intruders, 
most people recognize that we’ve entered a new era: Preda-
tors and humans today often share the same terrain, and 
their daily routines intersect in ways that challenge conven-
tional ideas about man and nature. 
J>; 97H;<KBBO C7D?9KH;: lawns of suburban and 
exurban developments may look domesticated, but they often 
occupy what were recently wildlands. These transitional zones 
between habitats, known as ecotones, are expanding at an 
unprecedented rate—providing more opportunities for 
human–predator interaction. Urban land area in the U.S. has 
quadrupled from 15 million acres in 1945 to 60 million in 
2002; rural residential land has increased by an average of 1.2 
million acres per year since 1980. 
But the spread of human populations doesn’t necessarily 
come at the expense of predators. The semiwild environ-
ments desired by humans are often equally attractive to apex 
animals, and in many regions, human and predator popu-
lations are growing hand-in-hand. Nowhere is this more evi-
dent than in America’s gator belt, which extends from North

University of Northern Arizona professor Paul Beier scoffs 
at the idea of species-wide mountain lion habituation—as 
well as the notion that people are now lion prey. “It’s just not 
true,” he says. “If people were on the menu, we’d have an 
attack every day.” Though habituation can occur in individ-
ual animals, “The idea that it’s happening broadly as a phe-
nomenon is not consistent with the number of attacks we 
see, which is still less than one fatality a year. Every mountain 
lion has had an opportunity to kill a human, so 99.9 percent 
of mountain lions don’t bother to chomp us.”
Beier, who keeps records of mountain lion attacks and 
has tagged and tracked 32 lions, says all predators experi-
ment with different types of prey. “They have prey that they 
specialize in eating, but occasionally they’ll eat something 
else—that’s how they learn,” he says. “If you think about it, 
that’s necessary for animals to evolve. Maybe they’re trying 
something new that’s about the size of a deer but has two 
legs. But, by and large, they don’t.” 
Even if humans don’t turn into prey for all predators, the 
USGS’s Lewis—whose husband was Scott Lancaster’s class-
mate—believes habituation does happen, and not just for 
mountain lions, but for bears, coyotes, alligators and most 
other animals that regularly come into contact with humans. 
“Wildlife will habituate,” she says. “We have an effect on 
7I7D?C7BI7D:F;EFB;encounter each 
other more frequently, creatures can lose their 
sense of fear. It’s called habituation—a process by 
which an animal, after a period of exposure to a 
stimulus, stops responding. “Through experience, 
animals learn that people or developments are not 
threats, so their natural fear decreases,” says Tania 
Lewis, a U.S. Geological Survey biologist at Glacier 
Bay National Park and Preserve in Alaska. 
When animals are no longer afraid of humans, 
they no longer try to avoid them—and the results 
can be deadly. In January 1991, 18-year-old Scott 
Lancaster was killed—and partially eaten—by a 
mountain lion as he jogged a quarter-mile from his 
Idaho Springs, Colo., high school. This case and 
other human–lion interactions in and around 
Boulder, Colo., were the basis of the book The Beast 
in the Garden, in which author David Baron argues 
that mountain lions have become habituated. “As 
wildlife invades suburbs,” Baron wrote, “and as 
suburbs invade wildlife habitat, we are changing 
animal behavior in unexpected and sometimes 
troubling ways. Rarely has the behavioral shift been 
so well documented, as in the case of Boulder’s 
lions.” The lions, he argues, weren’t afraid of peo-
ple; in fact, the cats had changed their diets to 
include pets and sometimes people—and were 
teaching their offspring to do the same.

dragged the toddler through the 
street; she later died of a broken 
neck and blood loss. Bekoff, who 
worked the case, says the neigh-
bors had been feeding the coyote, 
perhaps in hopes that regular 
meals would prevent the wild ani-
mal from attacking pets. Wolves, 
raccoons and even alligators can 
also become food-conditioned.
>KC7D?JO?IDÊJB?A;BO to stop expanding 
into wildlife habitat. Though the risk of a fatal 
animal attack—or any animal attack—is less 
than the chance of getting struck by lightning 
(1 in 400,000), every time we step in the water in 
Florida, or jog alone in mountain lion territory, 
we are at risk. So how can we successfully live in 
this deceptively tame-looking new wilderness?
Most biologists argue that the simplest solu-
tion—eradicating predators—would be counter-
productive. “If you kill animals, other animals 
come in,” Bekoff says, pointing out that wolves 
once kept coyote populations in check, and with-
out that natural predator, coyote populations have 
exploded. Besides, Bekoff says, “people are against 
the wanton killing of these animals.” 
The key, then, might be to adapt ourselves.  
“We live with wildlife, and when we choose to 
build our house in the middle of the forest, we’ve 
now put our house in their backyard,” says 
Charles Schwartz, a research wildlife biologist at 
Montana State University. Predators once roamed 
the land unchallenged, yet if we’re smart—giving 
animals the respect they deserve and reconsider-
ing how we dispose of garbage, what foliage we 
plant—we can live together.
“They’re wild animals, and they’re predators,” 
Mazzotti says. “Treating them with that small 
amount of respect and intelligence is the best 
thing we can do to live with them.”

each other—whenever people and animals encounter each 
other, animals learn from that, and that helps shape their 
behavior the next time they have an encounter.” 
M>;D IKCC;H HEBBI 7HEKD:" our backyards turn 
into a smorgasbord for wildlife. Uncleaned grills, bird feed-
ers, dog food left on the porch and garbage stuffed into unse-
cured bins can lure creatures to our doorsteps. And once an 
animal has an easily obtained meal, it keeps coming back. 
The process through which animals learn that people are a 
source of high-quality calories is called food conditioning. 
“Sometimes wild animals get accustomed to a certain source 
of food, and they forgo other sources,” Bekoff says. “Why hunt 
for a rabbit when you can get a freebie handout at Joe’s?” 
This was just the kind of situation Denise Haldeman 
walked right into in May 2008. She went outside after dark to 
take down the bird feeders in the backyard of her Barbours,  
Pa., home. Her dog, Panda, tore into the darkness, but Hal-
deman thought the 12-year-old Lab mix was chasing another 
dog that sometimes ran loose in the neighborhood. 
Then she saw the black bear. It was standing on its hind 
legs, just a few feet away, clicking its teeth. As Haldeman 
turned to ﬂee, the bear struck her from behind, knocking her 
facedown on the patio. “The bear was standing on me, biting 
my head,” Haldeman later told reporters.
The bear left without attacking her further. Haldeman 
was treated for wounds on her head, face, arms and legs. 
Panda was not so lucky; the dog, which had also encountered 
the bear, died from its injuries. Authorities later determined 
that Haldeman had unwittingly come between a sow and her 
cubs; 10 days later the bears, which had previously been seen 
around the neighborhood, were trapped in Haldeman’s yard 
and relocated about 150 miles away. 
Black bears, usually considered far more docile than griz-
zlies, will typically ﬂee when confronted by a human, says 
Stephen Herrero, author of Bear Attacks: Their Causes and 
Avoidance. He has been studying bear attacks for 42 years. 
Food-conditioned black bears can become aggressive—a 
learned behavior from the wild, where they must defend 
their food from other bears. 
Most attacks are defensive—when people are in a bear’s 
space, it feels uncomfortable and may attack the perceived 
threat. But some attacks are predatory. “There’s the odd 
black bear—and this is where the fatalities come from—that 
just decides, Well, I’ve been eating deer all my life, I think I’ll 
try out that two-legged thing,” Herrero says. “That pattern of 
behavior is very recognizable. The bear walks around, sizes 
things up, and when it decides to go for it, it goes for it.” But 
most predatory attacks take place in the wilderness. Herrero 
says that backyard predatory behavior is peculiar, and biolo-
gists haven’t yet ﬁgured out why it’s happening. 
Though bears are the poster children for food condition-
ing, they are by no means the only susceptible animals. “Coy-
otes that have become problems have been fed,” Bekoff says. 
“It’s hard to think of any exceptions.” In August 1981, a 3-year-
old girl from Glendale, Calif., was waiting in the driveway for 
her father to ﬁnd his car keys when a coyote grabbed her by 
the throat. Before the father could chase the animal away, it

The first pieces of the U.S. Navy’s newest class of 
aircraft carrier—meant to be the cornerstone of American 
military sea power over the next hundred years—lie in the 
open air of a shipyard in Virginia. A misting rain is falling on 
the jumbled ﬁeld of steel bulkheads, stacks of pipe and 200-
ton sections of hull. It’s as if some gargantuan child broke 
apart his model ship and scattered the pieces on the ground. 
But Northrop Grumman’s staff at the Newport News ship-
yard know where every part is located—and the exact order 
in which each piece must be connected. Building an aircraft 
carrier is like putting together a 3D jigsaw puzzle, for years 
on end. Engineers have been designing some of the pieces 
since 2000; the job won’t be ﬁnished until 2015. 
And on a complex project of this scale, there is little mar-
gin to correct design mistakes. If not found and ﬁxed, one 
small ﬂaw can have ramiﬁcations that cost tens of millions of

ship without wearing helmets or boots. All they have to do is 
slip on chunky black glasses, stare at a screen and step inside 
the ship’s CAD plan.
Sam Vreeland, the Ford’s jowly, red-cheeked construction 
director, hands me a pair of the bulky glasses. We’re in a 
black-walled room inside a nondescript building at the ship-
yard. On an 8-foot-tall screen in the center of the room, engi-
neers from around the country meet—without leaving their 
ofﬁces—to perfect blueprints in virtual-reality simulators. In 
front of me is a virtual 3D model of every element of the 
ship’s jet-fuel room, from pumps and pipes to shims and 
studs securing bulkheads. In the lower decks, engineers have 
assigned a part number and a supplier to every one of these 
digital pieces. “We got this technology because we can walk 
anybody through, including the Navy,” Vreeland says. “They 
can see it more clearly than with a mockup.”
Penn State University research associate Vaughn Whisker 
appears on the screen to my left. Or at least his unshaven, 
black-clad avatar does. It waves from University Park, Pa., 400 
miles northwest, where Whisker is stomping around a 
10-foot-square room lined with virtual-reality screens. In the 
digital fuel room, the avatar reaches up for a pipe to make 
sure it’s in the right place. Then he moves behind a pump to 
ensure that maintenance workers will be able to ﬁt behind it. 
With another mouse click, any designer with access to the 
CAD ﬁle can see the room from the point of view of future 
crewmen, ensuring that pipes and open hatches don’t 
impede lines of sight to gauges or alarms, or the hand signals 
of shipmates at their stations. “We always had to ﬁnd the 
dollars, months of hot-metal work or even the life of a sailor 
not yet born. “These ships are like entire planned cities,” says 
Eric Wertheim, editor of The Naval Institute Guide to Combat 
Fleets of the World. “It’s like building Disney World.”
For more than six decades, aircraft carriers have been 
involved in virtually every major American military engage-
ment, from World War II to the current conﬂicts in Iraq and 
Afghanistan. But America’s carrier fleet is getting old. 
Designs for today’s Nimitz-class ships began in 1964, and 
although upgraded, the carriers’ steam-powered catapults 
and cramped quarters belong to another era. So, for the ﬁrst 
time in two generations, the Navy is commissioning a new 
carrier, named after President Ford, who served with distinc-
tion on the carrier Monterey during World War II. Following 
custom, each subsequent ship constructed to these specs 
will be named after him: the Ford class of carriers. 
Building a supercarrier is a uniquely American enter-
prise. There are 21 aircraft carriers in service around the 
globe; 11 belong to the United States. A few other nations—
Britain, Spain and India—have plans to build aircraft carri-
ers. But no one else makes them this large or with such 
advanced capabilities. No one else is about to try. 
The last time American engineers designed a carrier from 
scratch, in the 1960s, they drew the ship in ink and built full-
scale wooden models to prove their designs. Then, the 
construction-yard workers had to ﬁgure out how to put the 
ship together. Things work a little differently in 2009. Now, 
engineers and foremen can wander around a mockup of the

Eventually, this pixelated world meets the real one. 
Vreeland and I walk into the fabrication plant to see the raw 
metal, brought in by the trainload, formed into parts of the 
hull. It’s a cavernous, clanging, hissing 34,600-square-foot 
shop with dross, sparks and metal scraps all around. Every-
one calls out, “Hey, Sam-may!” as we walk by; Vreeland, a Vir-
ginia native, has been at the yard since 1972, working his way 
up from apprentice on Los Angeles–class subs to become the 
Ford’s head of construction in 2000. 
One worker, dressed in plaid, looks into a computer 
screen that displays data from a CAD file. The software 
guides a cutting machine’s jet of plasma gas over a long, low 
tub. The water below gurgles and ﬂashes purple before drain-
ing to reveal a steel plate. There’s a big, beveled oval cut in 
the center and lots of smaller holes for pipes and wiring. It’s 
the virtual carrier, starting to come to life.
We exit the plant and step into a company van. Vreeland 
drives along the waterfront, zipping over worn rails and past 
low-slung brick buildings and corrugated factories. On the 
ground are two 200-ton pieces of the hull, curved on one side, 
ﬂat and toothy on the other. Put them together, and they 
become a superlift—a piece of the carrier that is ready to be 
fit into the puzzle. The shipyard needs to assemble 162 
superlifts to create the hull.
And just about the only machine on the planet than can 
handle these massive parts is the powder-blue, 23-story 
gantry crane under which we’re driving. Riding on rails eight 
football ﬁelds long, the rectangular crane uses three hooks, 
each capable of lifting more than 300 tons, to pick up ship 
engineering balance,” says Lin “Yank” Rutherford, a former 
rear admiral and the shipyard’s director of platform integra-
tion. “But in the past there was some subjective thinking.” 
I reach out with pixelated hands, grab the pump and toss 
it across the room. Then I spin the lighting ﬁxtures around 
and tilt the ﬂoor. If the Northrop designers wanted to incor-
porate my horseplay, they would dump the data into the CAD 
system and ship it 2.5 miles to the fabrication plant at the 
other end of the shipyard, where metal is shaped to the exact 
speciﬁcations called for by the digital blueprint. 
Engineers are using other sophisticated software to synch 
the ship’s design with its future operation. On the flight 
deck, for example, shipbuilders test the way aircraft are 
brought to the deck and readied for launch. The Ford is uti-
lizing a new, NASCAR-like pitstop approach. On Nimitz-class 
carriers, airplanes are dragged all over the ﬂight deck for fuel 
refills, weapon reloads and maintenance checks. On the 
Ford, workers will handle all those jobs in a single spot. The 
Navy hopes these measures will increase sorties from the 
ship by 25 percent—up to 270 per day.
Everything on the Ford is subject to simulation testing, 
from the views of the ﬂight deck from the bridge to damage 
control in the engine rooms. According to manager of engi-
neering David Rockey, there are even messing models. 
“That’s where we see how long it takes crew members to get a 
hot lunch and come back [to their stations],” Rockey says. 
“It’s like SimCity for carriers.” But this game has a serious 
purpose: “Before we cut steel and pay the bill, we want to see 
what we’re going to get for our efforts.”

reactor. All that steam means gangs of sailors to operate 
valves, read gauges and ﬁx machines when they invariably 
wear down or spring a leak. On the Ford, many of those sys-
tems will be electric. 
The most novel use of electricity occurs on the ﬂight deck. 
Steam-powered catapults currently do not provide heavier 
aircraft with enough acceleration to take off, so the carrier 
cranks up the knots to increase wind speed over the deck. On 
Ford-class vessels, four linear motors will create magnetic 
waves that propel the catapult, with each jet getting a cus-
tomized shove into the sky. Planes will land as they do now, 
by hooking onto arresting cables, but the system that slows 
their speed will be electromechanical rather than just 
hydraulic. These novel designs come with risks. According to 
the Government Accountability Ofﬁce, developing the launch 
system’s generator has led to a 15-month delay. 
The Navy hopes these developmental risks 
will be rewarded with long-term savings, espe-
cially from the decrease in manpower. On old 
carriers, it takes gangs of men to move food, 
laundry, spare parts and ordnance. On the Ford,
forklifts, not sailors, will haul supplies. Pro-
gram managers say the Ford will require 700 
fewer people than a current carrier, saving as 
much as $5 billion over the life of the ship. 
Protecting those sailors is another concern: 
The Navy has gone to great lengths to ensure 
its carriers can take a hit. For 25 days in 2005, 
engineers with Naval Sea Systems Command 
conducted classified explosions on the USS 
America, a Kitty Hawk–class carrier that served 
in Vietnam and the Persian Gulf. The ship even-
tually ﬂooded and sank in the largest damage-
control experiment ever conducted. The Navy 
says results of that test have been incorporated 
into the design of the Ford.
Later this year the megacrane will lower 
the ﬁrst superlift piece into the dry dock where 
the Ford will be assembled. Navy brass, politicians and com-
pany ofﬁcials will gather around the massive section of the 
hull and make speeches; bands will play martial songs. Then 
more curved side shells will be outﬁtted with pipes, lights 
and as many ﬁxtures as possible before being lowered into 
the dry dock. One superlift at a time, the USS Ford will slowly 
take on the aspect of a ship. When the carrier’s structure is 
complete from hull to island, the dry dock will be ﬂooded 
with water from the James River. Tugs will tow the massive, 
empty vessel to another part of the shipyard for years of wir-
ing and systems integration, freeing up the dock for the con-
struction of the next Ford-class vessel. The process will con-
tinue until 2058 or until funding ends. 
Every day between now and then, at 12:30 pm, a shrill 
whistle at the shipyard will blow twice. Workers across New-
port News—some wearing coveralls and hard hats, others in 
virtual-reality goggles and slacks—know it means their lunch 
break is over. They will head back to their respective corners 
of the shipyard and get back to work.

parts. But even that 900-ton capacity—the largest in the 
Western Hemisphere—wasn’t big enough for the Ford. So 
Northrop upgraded the crane’s maximum haul to 1050 tons.
The shipyard is obsessed with the timelines of any big-
dollar project, and the Ford is easily the biggest. The ﬁrst 
Ford-class carrier will cost $14 billion, including $5 billion 
for research and development; Navy ofﬁcials say the price 
will drop to around $6 billion per ship with subsequent 
builds. Delays—and so far the Ford program has suffered 
two years’ worth of them—can mean losing skilled workers 
and support from Congress or the Pentagon. As the largest 
items in the Pentagon’s shipbuilding budget, new carriers 
are tempting targets for cutbacks. Some defense analysts are 
already wondering why the U.S. needs a 100,000-ton monster 
carrier when our most prominent current enemies are ter-
rorists, small guerrilla bands and pirates in skiffs. 
Another controversy surrounding the Ford program is 
whether this is the right time for a new design. “Do we know 
enough about future threats?” Wertheim asks. “By 2060, are 
we even going to have manned fighters? We’re really at a 
crossroads.” Although Wertheim thinks the new carrier pro-
gram could have waited 10 years to get a better idea of the 
future needs of the ship, he notes that the construction is pro-
gressing well. “So far, so good,” he says. “But on these huge 
programs, it’s inevitable that they have hang-ups. When that 
happens, you can’t see it as a failure for the whole program.”
When the Ford is completed, it won’t look much 
different from carriers built for the Cold War. However, 
there will be striking changes inside. The Ford is the ﬁrst to 
greatly reduce aircraft carriers’ reliance on steam. Nearly 
everything done on the Nimitz class—heating cabins, drying 
laundry, propelling the ship, making potable water, launch-
ing jets—is done with steam power generated by a nuclear

on big jobs such as geothermal heat 
pumps, solar panels and wind syﬆems. 
Inﬆallation coﬆs for these uncapped 
projes count toward the credit until 
2016. e uncapped credits can wipe 
out an entire tax burden, but Uncle 
Sam won’t cut a check for the excess. 
For changes in ﬆate and local tax cred-
its, homeowners can check the Data-
base of State Incentives for Renew-
ables & Eﬃciency (dsireusa.org).
Contraors hope the credits will 
spur homeowner investment. “The 
credits have deﬁnitely given us a little 
bump in geothermal projects,” says 
Troy Howard of Central Valley Mechan-
ical in Utah. “Intereﬆ in solar and wind 
has picked up.” 
“For some homeowners who 
already had energy-eﬃciency projes 
in mind, the tax credits have helped 
push them over the hump,” says 
Michael Rogers, senior vice president 
of market development with Green-
Homes America, which upgraded Mau-
rer’s house. “But it’s not like we’ve had 
people banging down our door because 
of the federal tax credits,” Rogers adds.
Although the program oﬀers a lot, 
taking advantage of it can be tricky. 
For example, not all Energy Star–certi-
ﬁed doors and windows qualify for the 
program’s ﬆri ﬆandards. Categories 
such as solar- and wind-power sys-
tems did not initially liﬆ speciﬁc mod-
els of qualifying produs; manufaur-
ers of biomass stoves were still 
waiting, as of April, for criteria to 
determine which ﬆoves qualify. Other 
improvements, like energy-efficient 
garage-door openers or metering 
devices to control power consump-
tion, are not included. 
Homeowners could make a mis-
take planning multiple projes—in the 
capped category, each homeowner 
has only $1500 to claim for all work 
combined. Improvements must be 
“placed in service” during the tax year. 
Homeowners should keep the Manu-
faurer’s Certiﬁcation Statement say-
ing the item qualiﬁes for the tax credit. 
at will make life easier during the 
next DIY proje: ﬁling tax returns.

Hammering down a traditional hardwood ﬂoor feels a lot like bludgeon-
ing a jigsaw puzzle: Spread out the pieces, slip in the short planks and 
ﬆagger the edges. Slide over the crescent-shaped nail gun, wedge one 
plank’s tongue into the next one’s groove, then bang! Whack the gun with 
a rubber mallet to ﬁre oﬀ a nail, putting the next piece in its place.
But today homeowners rarely know the or-like brutality of the 
ﬂooring nailer. ey don’t have to—new engineered ﬂoating syﬆems snap 
together tool-free, held down by a perfe ﬁt within the room’s walls. e 
simpler inﬆallation belies increased complexity in the materials beneath 
the ﬂoor’s surface. Eﬃcient new syﬆems, such as vapor barriers to 
reduce moiﬆure inﬁltration and plumbing for cozy radiant heating, inﬆall 
more easily under engineered planks. And, yet, despite the technical 
advances,  many homeowners ﬆill prefer the durability and warmth of 
wood—not to mention the thrill of inﬆallation.

Traditional wood 
e beﬆ value for 
the money over 
the long term: 
¾-inch planks can 
be sanded and 
reﬁnished half a 
dozen times, 
compared to three  
or fewer for 
engineered and 
zero for laminate. 
Moiﬆure can 
cause problems.
Laminate
A laminate board’s 
solid, high-density 
ﬁberboard core 
reﬆs beneath a 
skin printed with 
woodgrain or 
another pattern. 
Some laminates 
resiﬆ kitchen 
ﬆains and traﬃc 
better than 
engineered and 
wood ﬂoors. For 
high durability, 
look for an 
abrasion class 
(AC) rating of 3.
Engineered 
Built with a 
plywood core and 
a hardwood wear 
layer, engineered 
ﬂoors vary in 
thickness from  
3⁄8 to ¾ inch. Fatter 
ﬂoors laﬆ 
longeﬆ—pros can 
remove a layer as 
thin as a business 
card when 
reﬁnishing, but the 
ﬁneﬆ engineered 
ﬂoors have no 
more than a 3- to 
5-mm wear layer. 
Look for a ﬁve- to 
seven-ply body and 
a long warranty.
Subﬂoor
Joiﬆs, covered by 
¾-inch plywood, 
ideally run 
perpendicular to 
ﬂooring. When 
they are parallel, 
pros double the 
plywood and add 
blocking every  
24 inches.
 EXCEPTIONAL FLOORING 
Special circumﬆances require adjuﬆments below the ﬁnished 
ﬂoor. Here’s how inﬆallers handle unusual situations. 
SOUND PROOFING 
Mass-loaded vinyl barriers 
were once the beﬆ way to 
muﬄe noise, but now builders 
use recycled rubber mats to 
reduce sound transmission 
and resiﬆ impa. Wood 
ﬂooring and canned ﬁxtures 
overhead transmit noise 
readily. A ﬂoating cork ﬂoor or 
carpet has a better chance of 
achieving the sound of silence. 
RADIANT HEAT
Pros mount radiant tubing 
below the subﬂoor using 
heat-transfer plates or 
brackets, or simply by ﬆapling 
it up from below. PEX tubing 
is ﬆandard, but newer EPDM 
rubber hoses such as Onyx’s 
are more conduive and 
durable. Engineered or 
ﬂoating ﬂoors expand and 
contra less than solid wood. 
CONCRETE 
Inﬆalling nail-down ﬂooring 
on a slab requires sleeper 
ﬆrips to give the nails 
material to bite. It’s labor-
intensive, so ﬂoating ﬂoors 
are more common than 
hardwood. Nail-free ﬂoaters 
won’t damage the vapor 
barriers that defend againﬆ 
below-grade moiﬆure 
inﬁltration.

EVEN IF YOU NEVER INSTALL A

YOU’LL PROBABLY REFINISH AN

WHAT OOZE TO USE.
Floor 
Finishes
Manufaurers add aluminum oxide 
hardeners to polyurethane resins to 
ﬆrengthen preﬁnished ﬂooring to levels 
unattainable outside a faory. Available 
in both engineered and solid ﬆyles. Not 
all are equal; warranty lengths truly 
reﬂe quality. Beﬆ for DIY inﬆallations.
Causes fumes, but it’s the ﬆrongeﬆ 
ﬁnish pros can apply on-site. Glossy 
coats make a hard shell but scratch more 
easily than matte ﬁnishes. Two layers of 
high-gloss and a third of satin keep the 
proteion but tone down the top layer. 
Marketed as an alternative to noxious, 
volatile organic compounds, water-based 
ﬁnishes have proven less durable than 
their oil-based brethren. Some inﬆallers 
expe three to nine years from this 
ﬁnish. (Oil-based ﬁnishes laﬆ six to 12.)
Tung oil does not form a ﬁlm over a 
ﬂoor’s surface (ﬁlm-forming poly ﬁnishes 
seal wood shut). Applying oil to conceal 
scratches is required maintenance, but 
regular touchups mean there’s never a 
need to sand and reﬁnish the whole ﬂoor.
<< Nail-Down Tongue-and-Groove
Pros:  Staggered plank lengths save inﬆallation 
time—pros lay out entire rooms by ﬁtting short 
pieces into small spaces, minimizing cuts. Planks 
are available unﬁnished—beﬆ for ongoing 
conﬆruion in a gut renovation, because the ﬁnish 
can be applied once the work is complete. 
Repeated reﬁnishing oﬀers a longer life span.
Cons:  Moiﬆure changes can cause permanent cupping. 
Over concrete slabs, ﬂoors need a labor-intensive 
sleeper syﬆem.
Pros:  No nail guns needed. Easy to inﬆall on concrete 
slabs. Conceals slightly uneven subﬂoors. Won’t 
punure vapor barriers. Swells like cardboard 
when wet, then reverts to original shape. So 
underfoot. Preﬁnished and ready for use—conve-
nient when redoing a single room (but ongoing 
conﬆruion can damage the new ﬂoor’s ﬁnish).
Cons:  Tricky to lay out. Uniform pieces don’t make 
random patterns. Inﬆallation requires repeated 
cuts to ﬁt around a room’s perimeter.

Using rain barrels is an old con-
cept that has come around 
again, and with good reason. Water 
that washes off your roof does noth-
ing but over-water lawn areas near the 
downspouts, or burden a house’s 
foundation drain system. It also con-
tributes to runoff that carries pollut-
ants into waterways. Why not capture 
it instead, and put it to work watering 
vegetables or ﬂowers?
But does it pay? Yes, in terms of 
environmental stewardship. No, on 
purely economic grounds. Unless you 
get a free or low-coﬆ recycled food 
barrel and ﬁt it with inexpensive plumb-
ing parts, a pair of commercial rain 
barrels, diverters and perhaps even a 
pump will coﬆ $300 to $700, depend-
ing on the model you choose. ey will 
return somewhere from $3 to about 
$12 a year in water-coﬆ savings, or 
maybe a few dollars in elericity sav-
ings if you pump water from a well. 
ese produs make more sense 
in terms of water conserva-
tion and reducing polluted 
runoﬀ. Say you have 1900 
square feet of roof surface, 
not an unusual roof size. 
That surface will shed somewhere 
between 12,000 and 24,000 gallons 
a year, depending on how much pre-
cipitation your area receives (a large 
part of the continental U.S. receives 
up to 40 inches of precipitation yearly; 
arid regions may receive less than half

Aer the water short-
ages we had last

about installing a rain barrel. 
ey seem like a great idea, 
but do they really pay?

that). To put that in perspective, a 
typical 25-foot, round, aboveground 
swimming pool is ﬁlled to the rim of 
its 52-inch depth with about 15,000 
gallons. Not all of that water falls 
when you need it, but if a quarter of it 
does, that’s ﬆill enough to satisfy a 
large part of your irrigation needs.
Before inﬆalling any syﬆem, check 
with your local building department 
about what is permitted where you 
live. Many ﬆates have laws that gov-
ern rainwater harvesting, even on a 
small-scale, individual level. Alaska, Ari-

Wyoming have regions that restrict 
the praice or require you to ﬁle a per-
mit and prove that you’re putting the 
captured water to beneﬁcial use. On 
the other hand, some states and 
municipalities encourage the praice 
by subsidizing rain barrels or providing 
guidance through websites. 
For people who don’t want to rig up 
their own syﬆem, new rain-harveﬆing 
products are attractive and well-
thought-out (for example, ﬁskars.com). 
It’s not the old, half-rotted ﬆeel barrel 
filled to overflowing and swarming 
with mosquito larvae. Any system 
should divert the rainwater once the 
barrel is full. Otherwise the water 
backs up the downspout to the gutter 
and overﬂows. Also, if the barrel is ele-
vated to provide gravity ﬂow, it muﬆ 
be securely faﬆened so that it cannot 
tip over and hurt a child. The more 
thought you give to the system’s 
design before you begin, the better it 
will work.
Mouse House 
Our 10-year-old brick ranch house 
has mice. I found a gap under the 
fascia where they were coming in, 
and I sealed that. I also cut back tree 
limbs that might have allowed them 
to climb in. I want to ﬁnd and seal 
other entries. Any suggeﬆions?
I’m no peﬆ-control contraor, but I’ve 
seen mice squeeze through incredibly 
small openings, and I’ve seen their 
droppings around a variety of impossi-
bly small entries: the perimeter gap 
around dryer vents, the exterior vent 
for central vacuum syﬆems, the open-
ing between a garage door weather-
ﬆrip and the doorjamb, and through 
foundation vents. One of the beﬆ ways 
to check for mouse entry points is to 
turn on all interior house lights at night, 
including those in the attic and crawl-
space. Then, with all windows and 
doors shut, walk the perimeter of the 
house. Where light peeks out, mice 
can sneak in. 
Old-Trellis Rehab
We had a ﬁne old trellis on the side of 
our house that rotted apart, caved in 
and damaged the climbing rose on it. 
e ﬆeel nails driven into our house’s 
brickwork were moﬆly ruﬆed away 
as well. Where do we ﬆart this 
repair? Should we call a mason?
Firﬆ, prune away any damage to the 
rose. When you’re finished, there 
shouldn’t be any ragged stumps or 
twiﬆed canes. Next, salvage what you 
can of the old trellis, not for use, but to 
help you design its replacement, which 
should be built out of cypress, cedar 
or pressure-treated lumber cut into 
slats on a table saw. Faﬆen all parts, 
using hot-dipped galvanized nails or 
ﬆainless-ﬆeel nails and screws.
You mentioned that the original 
nails driven into the mortar (or the 
brick) had ruﬆed through. at’s bad.

eliminated the need to pump sludge 
and scum from the tank. ere are ﬆill 
people who fervently believe in the 
chicken hypothesis, swearing that 
they haven’t had to pump their tank in 
years, if ever. Really, all that these 
people are doing is contributing to 
groundwater pollution by sending 
bacteria- laden filth out of an over- 
burdened tank into the system’s 
leaching ﬁeld (the buried pipes that 
receive the outﬂow from the septic 
tank). I’m thankful that intereﬆ in the 
technique seems to be dying oﬀ.
So to answer your question, the 
average syﬆem should be inspeed 
yearly and pumped every three to ﬁve 
years. But to get more speciﬁc, you’ll 
need the advice of a septic tank pump-
ing company (and moﬆ are honeﬆ, in 
my experience). You can tell whether 
any service provider is truﬆworthy by 
subjecting his advice to common 
sense. In this case, the speciﬁc pump-
ing interval would obviously depend  
on how big the tank is and how many 
people live in the house. And while 
you’re searching, drop by the website 
of the  National Environmen-
tal Services Center,  operated 
by Weﬆ Virginia University. 
It has a wealth of informa-
tion on maintaining residen-
tial septic systems, dead 
chickens excluded.
Icemaker Iced 
I had to shut water oﬀ at 
the kitchen sink for a 
couple of days while I went 
about some plumbing and 
remodeling. Aer reﬆor-
ing water, I ﬁnd that the 
refrigerator’s icemaker 
isn’t working, but water is 
getting through the 
icemaker’s inlet valve. 
I suspect that loosened  
sediment from the plumb-
ing work has clogged the 
icemaker, so I ran this idea 
paﬆ Chris Hall, a former 
appliance technician and 
now president of repairclinic 
.com, an appliance parts 
provider. He had an even 
simpler diagnosis: “My 
guess is that the ﬁll tube at 
Get up on a ladder and inspe those 
spots. Rusting steel expands with 
enough force to crack bricks and mor-
tar, and this will need to be repaired. 
Unless the damage to the brick and 
mortar looks severe, you probably 
won’t need a mason. Pull out any 
remaining ruﬆy nail ﬆubs.
Now the challenge is to attach the 
trellis so that corrosion won’t damage 
the wall. To faﬆen the new trellis, use 
stainless-steel Tapcon masonry 
screws or Zamac Nailin fasteners, 
also known informally as mortar 
plugs. e latter is a two-part faﬆener 
consisting of a nail and a body of 
Zamac alloy—a corrosion- resistant 
metal formed from zinc, aluminum, 
magnesium and copper. To inﬆall this 
fastener, use a hammer drill and a 
masonry bit or the new Bosch multi-
purpose bit, and bore through the lat-
tice into the bricks or mortar behind 
it. You blow the hole clean, then ham-

mer the Nailin through the lattice. e 
head on the Nailin body holds the lat-
tice ﬁrmly in place as the ﬆeel nail 
expands the body, ﬁrmly wedging the 
lattice to the masonry. ere are dif-
ferent types of this fas tener. Make 
sure to use the one with the mush-
room head and a ﬆainless-ﬆeel nail. 
e carbon-ﬆeel nail version will ruﬆ.
Septic Seminar 
How oen do we need to pump our 
septic tank? We’ve had advice that 
ranges from one year to ﬁve.
I’m juﬆ glad you didn’t ask me the 
“dead chicken queﬆion.” It goes like 
this: “If I regularly toss a whole dead 
chicken into my septic tank, will that 
reduce or even eliminate the need  
to pump the tank?” We used to be 
asked that queﬆion quite frequently. 
The thinking was that the bacterial 
aivity created by the chicken car-
cass was so great that it reduced or 

the top of the refrigerator is frozen 
solid,” Hall says. “aw the tube with  
a hair  dryer.” 
Hall recommends that aer thaw-
ing the tube, check whether the ice-
maker’s water-inlet valve is ﬆuck open, 
allowing a small drip to continually feed 
the icemaker. If you find dripping, it 
indicates that sediment may be pre-
venting the valve from closing, and this 
could cause the problem. If so, replace 
the valve. It can’t be repaired. 
Bulb Knocks Out Circuit 
When a light bulb burned out in a 
bedroom ceiling ﬁxture it knocked 
out the circuit breaker that serves 
that room. We changed the bulb and 
switched the circuit breaker back 
on, and everything seems ﬁne. It’s a 
relatively new home. Should we call 
an elerician? 
You probably don’t have to call an elec-
trician unless you see repeated circuit 
breaker tripping. Having seen the  
same thing happen, I’ve wondered 
why, so I checked with Bill Lego, a PM 
 contributor and elerician in Rockford, 
Ill. “Sometimes a light bulb fails in 
supernova fashion, ﬂashing a big arc,” 
Lego says. “I suspect that the fila-
ment’s failure permits a boatload of 
current to ﬂow through the arc plasma. 
is surge of current exceeds the cir-
cuit breaker’s rating, causing it to trip.” 
It’s a plausible, physics-based theory. 
Flaking Latex 
We painted some rooms recently 
with latex paint and are disappointed 
to ﬁnd that some of the new paint  
is ﬂaking oﬀ the walls and ceiling. 
Please help. 
To bond properly, latex paint requires a 
clean, slightly rough surface. I’m willing 
to bet that the problem areas are in 
the kitchen and bathroom, because 
those walls oen have a ﬁlm of duﬆ, 
grease or mildew. Also, there could  
be a moiﬆure source that’s contribut-
ing to the problem. Assuming that 
there aren’t ﬆains on a ceiling, which 
would indicate a leak through a roof or 
skylight, sometimes a bathroom fan 
 discharges into the attic, and the 
resulting humidity can be enough to  
li paint in rooms below. If the bath-
room is unvented, then the vapor pres-
sure can be great enough to li paint 
oﬀ adjacent walls.
If moiﬆure vapor isn’t the culprit, 
scrape the ﬂaking paint oﬀ. en thor-
oughly wash the surface with a ﬆrong 
solution of TSP (trisodium phosphate) 
and hot water. Next, lightly sand the 
surface with a drywall sanding pole 
and a drywall sanding screen, or use a 
hand-sanding block and 220-grit paper. 
oroughly rinse the surface and wipe 
it clean. To check your work, press your 
palm againﬆ the surface. Prime the 
aﬀeed areas and repaint.

It’s hot. Really hot. A wave of 
shimmering, sauna-hot air hits your 
face and takes your breath away as 
you open the door and settle into the 
car. Too bad there wasn’t a tree any-

Replacing Fan Motors
BRUSH-TYPE 12-VOLT FAN MOTORS LIVE IN A HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT.              
WHEN THEY FAIL, IT’S USUALLY NOT A HUGE TASK TO REPLACE THEM. BY MIKE ALLEN

sweet and acrid. e smell builds for a 
minute or two and then the fan slows 
and the cool breeze dwindles. ere’s 
a brief sizzle from under the dash, fol-
lowed by an even more acrid smell. 
What’s going on? Paradise by the 
dashboard vents is over. Your fan 
motor has died. 
What Went Wrong?
Okay, not every fan motor dies in 
such a speacular blaze of glory. e 
lives of these devices are unpredi-
able. Sometimes the motors juﬆ keep 
zipping along and lose steam 
gradually—until they just don’t turn 
anymore. Or the fan may croak on the 
spot without warning. at’s usually 
an indication of seized bearings. ese 
motors generally don’t use ball or nee-
dle bearings, they juﬆ glide on a simple 
bushing of oil-impregnated bronze. 
Dirt and corrosion can create so much 
friction inside that they’ll gradually 
grind to a halt. So, our ﬁrﬆ ﬆep is to 
ﬁnd out what, exaly, went wrong.
Start by checking the fuse. e con-
dition of the fuse really won’t tell you 
what the problem is—but ﬆay tuned. 
If it’s blown, don’t replace it now, 
because there’s a good chance the 
new one may blow immediately too.
Next ﬆep? Find the fan underneath 
the dashboard and spin it manually. 
is process might involve temporarily 
removing a du if you have a cabin air 
ﬁlter. If the fan spins readily, the prob-
lem is usually electrical. If it feels 
ﬆicky, or has rough spots as you turn 
it, juﬆ go out and buy a new one right 
now. It’s done.
Fuse okay? Fan spins smoothly? 
Get out the meter, or at leaﬆ a teﬆ 
light. It’s time to chase voltages.
Basics Firﬆ
Twiﬆ the ignition key to accessory 
(ACC) mode and turn the fan switch to 
high. Back-probe the hot line into the 
fan, and you should see 12 volts in the 
syﬆem. While you’re poking around, 
be sure both the hot and ground wires 
are ﬆill attached. It’s not impossible 
for these wires to be knocked loose by 
set to high. We replaced the resiﬆor 
block before doing any further diagno-
sis. ese resiﬆors generate a lot of 
heat, so they’re typically mounted 
inside the plenum, right in the path of 
airflow from the fan. Guess what? 
When the fan is compromised, the 
resiﬆor overheats. Consequently, it’s 
not uncommon to see fried resiﬆors 
accompanying fried blower motors. 
e resiﬆor is usually inexpensive ($10 
to $15) and easy to swap out. If the fan 
motor on my car was dead, I’d proba-
bly go ahead and change the resiﬆor 
while I had my head under the dash. 
With the switch on a lower setting 
and the motor disconneed, you’ll ﬆill 
see a full 12 volts of syﬆem voltage at 
even the loweﬆ setting. e voltage 
won’t drop down to a lower level until 
the fan motor ﬆarts to draw current. 
Our spent motor was completely 
open electrically, and wouldn’t load 
down the circuit at all, even aer we 
replaced the resiﬆor. If your motor has 
the errant toe of a boot or a suicidal 
Barbie doll lurking on the ﬂoor. 
Check the schematic—a few vehi-
cles switch from the ground side of the 
fan motor, not the high side. If so, there 
should be 12 volts to the motor full-
time, regardless of the switch position, 
and you’ll need to check voltage on the 
ground side. If you have no juice to the 
motor, it’s time to ﬁnd out why.
Fusable Link
Sometimes the problem is not the 
motor itself. It’s the resiﬆor. A fan con-
ﬆantly turning full-chat is noisy, and 
unnecessary a lot of the time. So moﬆ 
fan blower switches use a voltage-
dropping resistor assembly to slow 
down that motor to a quieter speed. 
When this resiﬆor dies, the fan will no 
longer work at certain speeds. The 
resiﬆor was blown on our teﬆ car—
we knew that for certain because the 
voltage was only meterable at the 
motor’s hot terminal with the switch 
1 If both hot and 
ground wires are 
ﬆill attached to 
the motor’s frame, 
back-probe the hot 
wire to the motor 
armature with the 
key on and the fan-
speed switch set 
to high. You should 
see full battery 
voltage.
2 Standing on your 
head with your face 
in the footwell isn’t 
much fun, but you’ll 
need to remove the 
motor’s attach-
ment hardware.
3 We managed to 
sneak this dead 
motor out of the 
plenum without 
removing half the 
dashboard. Unfor-
tunately, they’re 
not all this easy. 
Some fan motors 
are removed from 
inside the engine 
compartment, 
which, counter-
intuitively, isn’t 
necessarily easier.

bad bushings and still turns, albeit 
slowly, it probably draws enough 
current to cook itself from the extra 
drag. This extra current, you would 
think, would blow the fuse too. Unfor-
tunately, there is oen enough head-
room in a fuse’s rating to let the motor 
melt before the fuse pops, if it blows at 
all. If your fan motor is killing fuses, 
uprating the fuse to a higher amperage 
is not, I repeat, not, an acceptable solu-
tion. ere’s the chance of damaging 
not only the motor and resiﬆor with 
the excess current, but also the wiring 
in the harness and the blower-speed 
switch itself. You’ve been warned.
Parts Chasing
We ordered a replacement blower 
from a website, and of course the 
wrong part showed up. Big surprise, 
eh? So we ordered another one, from 
a diﬀerent vendor. Big surprise, Part II: 
It was the wrong motor, yet again. 
That precipitated a trip to the local 
auto-parts ﬆore. And as we’ve come 
to expe, the counterman was able to 
crack the code for our particular vehi-
cle and come up with the right part 
overnight. Said part was inside an 
identical box, with an identical part 
a surprisingly small amount of money, 
moﬆ motors can be rebuilt. is proce-
dure starts with disassembly and 
inspeion of all the windings for inter-
nal shorts, opens or shorts to ground. If 
the windings look or teﬆ bad, they can 
be rewound with fresh, varnished cop-
per wire. e shop will also true up the 
commutator on a lathe and undercut 
the copper contas. Following that, it’ll 
clean up and lube or replace the bush-
ings, replace the brushes (which are 
usually a ﬆandard size) and button the 
whole thing up. Not every motor is 
rebuildable, but in desperate times I’ve 
pried open some crimped-shut motors 
that weren’t designed to be repaired.
A Breath of Fresh Air
Okay, you’ve sourced a new, used 
or rebuilt fan motor. If it’s not a new 
one, I’d recommend a teﬆ run on your 
workbench before going through the 
trouble of inﬆalling it. You can either 
run jumpers from the car battery or 
just use a battery charger or other 
12-volt source. You’ll need 10 amps or 
so to run the motor at full speed. When 
the jumpers make the conneion, the 
fan will spin merrily. And since every 
aion has an equal and opposite reac-
tion, the motor housing will spin coun-
ter to the fan’s rotation. Don’t let it 
spin right off the counter onto the 
ﬂoor. Don’t ask me how I know this.
Inﬆallation is the reverse of removal. 
Reinﬆall any cooling dus, and keep 
the wiring harness away from the fan 
blades. If your old motor came with any 
sound insulation, replace that too. 
Don’t use du tape to hold the insula-
tion back on—the extreme underdash 
temperatures will dry it out within 
months. If you muﬆ, glue the insulation 
back with RTV (room-temperature-
vulcanizing) silicone gasket sealer.

number printed on it. Go ﬁgure. If you 
have a very old or odd car, you may 
have less luck ﬁnding a source. A deal-
ership should be able to get anything 
for most late-model cars; expect to 
pay through the nose. If you have an 
older vehicle, you may need to look to 
the reﬆoration market. My ﬁrﬆ source 
is usually J.C. Whitney (jcwhitney.com), 
or the back pages of Hemmings Motor 
News (hemmings.com). Last resort: 
junkyard parts. 
If you muﬆ use an older, boneyard 
fan, clean and lubricate the bearings. 
e bearing on the fan end of the arma-
ture is accessible: Spin the armature 
shaft and hose it down with brake 
cleaner. Follow up with oil—a few drops 
of LPS 3 (my personal favorite) or even 
motor oil. e other end of the arma-
ture is usually inaccessible. You can try 
to disassemble the motor, but I’ve used 
this trick successfully: Drill a 1⁄16-inch 
hole in the stamped-steel end cap. 
Put grease on the drill bit to catch any 
shavings. Inje a sparing amount of 
LPS 3 or oil into the hole. en clean 
up the area with brake cleaner and seal 
the hole with silicone gasket sealer. 
Can’t ﬁnd even an old motor? Take the 
fried one to an eleric motor shop. For 
4 e new motor 
had to be snaked 
up into place paﬆ 
some serious 
roadblocks in the 
footwell and under 
the dash. Patience. 
Be sure not to dam-
age the plaﬆic fan. 
Some replacement 
motors don’t come 
with fans—you’ll 
need to recycle 
your old fan-blade 
assembly.

a wrench on all the 
faﬆeners without 
adding an extra joint 
in your wriﬆ.

deceased fan’s 
shorted copper

it if it were rare and

My trick to opening a stuck hood? Pull 
on the hood-release handle with your 
right hand while standing outside the 
open car door and slapping the hood, 
hard, with an open-palmed left hand. 
Oh, yeah, it stings, but at least the 
hood pops open.

up on the cable so far that the latch 
runs out of travel before the handle 
does. If you have your helper hold the 
handle all the way open and clamp the 
cable down, you’ll be ﬁne. If you make 
it too tight, you’ll break the cable (don’t 
ask, Part II). Now, douse the latch

Don’t use silicone or penetrating oil,

Underhood Turbulence
My wife has a 1990 Lincoln Town 
Car,  which she loves. Recently we’ve 
noticed an engine vibration you can 
feel in the gas pedal. Yet it goes away 
when we’re parked. Is this an engine 
problem or a transmission problem?
Probably neither. If you’re feeling the 
shake through the accelerator pedal 
and not through the ﬆeering wheel or 
the car’s body, then I’d hazard a guess 
that a motor mount is broken or loose. 
is will allow the engine to shi under 
acceleration. When the engine’s torque 
is juﬆ right, the mount lis away from 
the frame. Feather the throttle juﬆ a 
bit, and the engine’s weight holds the 
mount down. But too much throttle 
and the motor mount will top out, and 
things are free to shake. e shaking is 
then transmitted to your right foot 
through the accelerator cable. Time to 
replace that broken mount. 
Shiless
I have a tough transmission queﬆion 
for you. My ’93 Muﬆang GT some-
times won’t go into gear. If I’m sitting 
at a traﬃc light in neutral with the 
clutch pedal released, then push the 
clutch in to put it in gear, the shier 
won’t go into that gear (or any gear) 
until I wait to the count of three. At 
that point, it will go in and out 
easily—until I let the clutch out with 
the transmission in neutral again. e 
clutch cable is adjuﬆed correly, and 
I have no problems shiing once the 
car is moving. I can’t ﬁgure this one 
out, and I’m a professional mechanic 
(albeit for Benz, so we only see 
maybe a dozen manual trans cars in a 
career). It’s really ﬆumped me and 
my co-workers; any ideas?
Sounds perfectly normal to me. 
You’ve got a clutch disc, input sha 
and the front half of the transmission 
spinning along merrily at idle speed, 
driven by the ﬂywheel and pressure 
matter what I tried—choking, 
no-throttle, quarter-throttle or 
full-throttle. e battery had enough 
juice to turn it over, but there was no 
spark (sometimes juﬆ a ppfﬆ, ppfﬆ, 
ppfﬆ sound). A Kawasaki mechanic 
told me another spark plug should 
work. He said, “If it gets ﬂooded, that 
will ruin the spark plug. It takes a new 
one to allow the engine to turn over. 
Juﬆ cleaning the old spark plug won’t 
do it.” How can ﬂooding an engine 
permanently ruin a spark plug?
When the choke is on, especially when 
air temps are low, the fuel going into 
the cylinder tends to remain liquid 
rather than evaporating, wetting the 
plug’s insulator with fuel. Only fuel 
that’s evaporated and mixed with 
intake air will burn. Aer the engine 
starts and warms up, the fuel gets 
atomized much more completely—no 
plate. When you ﬆep on the clutch 
pedal, that rotating mass doesn’t ﬆop 
spinning inﬆantly. It takes a second or 
three to slow down. e 1-2 dog ring 
in the transmission won’t mesh with 
the ﬁrﬆ-gear engagement ring until 
it’s nearly ﬆopped. e synchronizers 
use friion to slow down (or speed up 
when downshiing) all the whirly bits 
to allow gear changes. at resiﬆance 
you feel in the shier is the synchro-
nizer matching speeds. When that 
synchro ﬆarts to wear out, you’ll get 
a crunching noise.
Beﬆ praice is to always depress 
the clutch a few seconds before trying 
to shi into ﬁrﬆ gear. is will let the 
parts slow down on their own.

problem. But until then, all that liquid 
fuel just soaks everything. The little 
combuﬆion that aually happens is 
incomplete and will plate the entire 
inside of the combustion chamber, 
an inch to the ground elerode and 
lighting the charge that comes in on 
the next intake stroke. Continued 
cranking and partial combuﬆion juﬆ 
makes it worse. 
A fresh plug fixes that. As far as 
your mechanic’s assertion that the 
plug will never work again, he’s par-
tially right. e oxides and carbon can’t 
really be removed, unless 
you use a spark plug clean-
ing tool. I have one. And I’ve 
have had it for 35 years. It’s 
just a small sandblaster 
(although I fill mine with 
glass beads) that scrubs 
away all the goop. Problem 
is, it also rounds off the 
edges of the positive and 
ground electrodes, and 
those work beﬆ when the 
edges are sharp, not round-
ed. The electrons in the 
spark like to jump oﬀ pointy 
things, not rounded ones. 
When plugs had ﬆeel elec-
trodes, I used a ﬁle to dress 
the electrodes and then 
gapped them back to the 
corre gap. Modern plugs 
moﬆly use precious- metal 
elerodes that don’t take 
kindly to that. I haven’t 
gapped a plug in a new car 
for years. 
I’ve had engines in 
motorcycles and cars and 
power equipment that 
would consistently take 
two sets of plugs to get 
started on cold days. I’d 
pop in a fresh set to light 
the fires, warm up the 
engine, and then put the 
originals back for the reﬆ 
of the day. Of course, I had 
less money and more time 
back then. Ignition syﬆems 
are a lot better than they 
used to be, but sometimes 
not good enough.
Synthetic 
Leakage? 
I heard from several “not 
too reliable” sources that 
once you use synthetic oil 
in your crankcase, you 
including the plug, with a sloppy ﬁlm of 
gasoline and carbon and moiﬆure—
which is conduive enough to let the 
spark trickle down the side of the insu-
lator inﬆead of jumping the 0.028 of

should never change back

diﬃculty believing that, 
but would appreciate your 
response.
A generation ago, when 
synthetics ﬁrﬆ hit the mar-
ket, there were a lot of com-
plaints about leaky engines. 
In spite of claims to the 
contrary by the purveyors 
of these new, premium oils, 
they didn’t have the same 
seal-swell charaeriﬆics as 
mineral oils. Mineral oils 
generally have an additive 
package that makes rubber 
and cork seals swell up 
slightly, promoting a tight, 
oil-free engine. When you 
switched to synthetics, the 
seals would shrink, ever so 
slightly, and oil would weep. 
Exacerbating this condition, 
the synthetics were gener-
ally much thinner in viscos-
ity, and would ﬁnd smaller 
gaps to percolate through. 
e result? Speckles on the 
driveway. Other brands of 
mineral oil had less seal-
swell. ese engines didn’t 
leak when filled with syn-
thetic—but the seals and 
gaskets compressed and 
wore out in their swollen 
ﬆate. Change back to low-
swell oil; the seal contras 
to its former, less turgid 
ﬆate, and out it gushes.
Fortunately, the petro-
leum industry seems to 
have a better handle on 
that today. Don’t worry. 
Change back and forth as 
you deem necessary.

Patio DJ
Consider that quintessential warm-
weather hearth, the barbecue. What 
better way to complement the sounds 
of chatting friends and sizzling burgers 
than with a playliﬆ of hot tunes?
Traditionally, outdoor sound sys-
tems have fallen into two categories: 
Firﬆ is the boombox. Nowadays, many 
of these portable ﬆereos have inte-
grated iPod docks, making them easy 
to use, but none could qualify as a seri-
ous sound system. A second, more 
labor-intensive path is to permanently 
wire weatherproof speakers (see “All-
Weather Wiring,” next page). 
But in the age of wireless network-
ing and PC-based music files, wiring 
outdoor speakers to a receiver that isn’t 
necessarily anywhere near your PC 
seems like a complex and probably 
unnecessary exercise. As it turns out, 
there are several ways to bypass the AV 
receiver and throw music direly from 
PC to patio, and there’s one simple way 
to control it all.
An easy, and relatively cheap, way 
to stream music outside is to use 
Apple’s AirPort Express. This small, 
$100 device plugs into any wall socket, 
taps into a Wi-Fi network and has a 
3.5-mm audio minijack that can output 
either an analog or digital optical sig-
nal. When you use Apple’s AirPort Util-
ity soware, your computer sets up 
AirPort Express units on your network, 
and then any speakers attached to 
them show up in iTunes. e AirPort
Express’s audio output is unpowered, 
however, so the speakers you hook up 
should have internal ampliﬁers. (Moﬆ 
computer speakers qualify.) 
Any AirPort Express setup will need 
to be temporary, however, since the 
device is by no means weatherproof. 
(For that matter, neither are moﬆ com-
puter speakers.) Some wireless 
speakers, however, are specifically 
designed to withﬆand the elements. 
Acoustic Research has a variety of 
speakers that can run on a handful 
of AA batteries and link via radio fre-
quency to an analog input up to 150 
to 200 feet away, depending on the 
model. But by far the moﬆ impressive 
outdoor sound syﬆem I’ve tried is the 
OutCast omnidirectional wireless 
speaker from SoundCaﬆ. e battery-
powered $700 OutCaﬆ has a built-in 
100-watt amp and produces serious

Nintendo Wii’s jump-up-and-

outdoor play. Projeor: An 
all-in-one digital projeor, such as 
the Epson MovieMate 55, will have 
built-in speakers, making setup easier. 
Screen: Any white tarp will do. To 
make the aion life-size, pull your 
projeor back 10 to 15 feet and 
oﬀset it to get it out of the way. 
Infrared bar: To avoid 
tripping hazards, use a 
wireless IR bar.

bass with an 8-inch woofer (its smaller, 
cheaper sibling, the $500 OutCaﬆ Jr., 
has a 60-watt amp). Inﬆead of Wi-Fi, 
the OutCaﬆ uses a spread-sperum 
proprietary 2.4-GHz wireless connec-
tion to either a $100 iPod dock or a 
$100 Universal AudioCaﬆ Transmitter, 
which attaches to a computer by tap-
ping into Windows’ or Mac OS’s built-
in USB speaker interface.
To control it all, try Apple’s free 
Remote app—a program so cool it 
single-handedly juﬆiﬁes the purchase 
of the iPod Touch or iPhone that it runs 
on. Remote uses the Wi-Fi antenna in 
either device to tap into the iTunes 
libraries on any computer hooked up to 
your network. Used with a wireless 
speaker setup, Remote allows you to 
browse all the music on your computer 
and DJ your tunes from your handheld 
device without ever going inside.
Pool Tools
Okay, weatherproof speakers will with-
ﬆand rain, but what about a dunk in 
the pool? Call them novelties if you like, 
but there are wireless speakers 
designed to ﬂoat on the surface of the 
water. The Aqua Sounders system, 
from Grace Audio, will transmit audio 
from a base ﬆation to up to 10 battery-
powered speakers. e sound quality 
from these audio balls is barely accept-
able (underwater, you can hardly hear 
them), plus they are conspicuously 
solid enough to provide a conk on the 
noggin to anyone unwise enough to 
cannonball into them. Nevertheless, 
there is something uniquely appealing 
about the pool-party atmosphere these 
things inﬆantly create.
Far more functional is Uniden’s 
totally waterproof WXI2077 Series 
cordless phone. In the days of data-
optimized cellular smartphones, ordi-
nary cordless handsets may seem 
passé, but juﬆ try doing laps with a 
BlackBerry clipped to your swimsuit. 
e WXI2077 ﬂoats, so you don’t even 
have to get out of the pool to answer 
it, plus it uses the relatively uncon-
geﬆed 1.9-GHz bandwidth, so it won’t 
interfere with Wi-Fi networks.
to trees or use spring clamps to attach 
your tarp to a fence. Keep in mind that 
the Wii needs an infrared-light-sensor 
bar placed at the bottom or top of the 
screen to work properly, and the wire 
for the Wii’s IR bar is 11 feet long, 
which can reﬆri the placement of the 
Wii and, consequently, the projeor. In 
my experience, you want to get your 
projeor back a good 10 to 15 feet to 
ensure a large enough image. at’s 
doable with the exiﬆing wire, but you 
can avoid a lot of potential trips and 
tangles with a wireless IR bar acces-
sory from Nyko ($20). Also, you’ll want 
to offset the projector to get it out 
of your way and avoid playing againﬆ 
your shadow. Most projectors have 
dials that allow you to corre the key-
ﬆone eﬀe you get when projeing 
from an angle. Once you’re all set up, 
you and your friends can swing your 
Wiimotes to your hearts’ content while 
racking up ﬆrikes in your virtual open-
air bowling alley.
FC
Life-Size Wii
e same home theater projeor that 
can turn a living room into an at-home 
cineplex can also turn your backyard 
into a drive-in. And bringing movie time 
outdoors is made simple with all-in-one 
projeors such as the Epson Movie-
Mate series and the Optoma DV11. 
ese projeors have built-in DVD play-
ers and speakers, so the only connec-
tion needed to set up an inﬆant lawn 
theater is an elerical extension cord. 
If you like your outdoor video enter-
tainment a bit more aive, any projec-
tor with composite video and RCA 
audio inputs can easily be hooked up 
to the Nintendo Wii gaming syﬆem, 
throwing human-size characters on 
any available projection surface. For 
the ﬆandard-def Wii, no fancy screens 
are necessary—an ordinary white tarp 
will do. To ensure a 6-foot-tall image, 
you’ll want a tarp measuring at leaﬆ 
11 x 6 feet (for a 16:9 aspe ratio) or 
8 x 6 feet (for 4:3 aspe). Tie the ends 
Despite all the
newfangled wireless 
speakers on the 
market, the majority of 
outdoor speakers get 
their signal and power 
the old-fashioned 
way—through speaker 
wire. Weather-
resiﬆant patio and 
garden speakers are 
available from many 
major manufaurers, 
including Bose (the 
Free Space 51 is 
piured above), Polk 
Audio and JBL. If you 
are powering only two 
outdoor speakers and 
have available speaker 
outputs, you can hook 
them up direly to 
your home theater 
receiver. Otherwise,  
 q!q		
All-Weather Wiring
a separate ampliﬁer  
is needed. 
To get your audio 
signal from the inside 
to the outside, you 
either need to tuck 
your wires under a 
closed window or drill a 
hole in your house. If 
you do the latter, make 
sure you seal it 
appropriately with 
silicone on the outside. 
Use outdoor-rated 
speaker wire for all 
exterior speaker wiring. 
For garden speakers 
with long cable runs, 
consider burying PVC 
conduit, then joining 
wires with dire-burial 
wire conneors. (Wires 
and accessories are 
available through online 
retailers such as 
outdoorspeakerdepot 
.com and ticcorp.com.) 
Patio speakers are 
more likely to be 
conneed via exposed 
terminals. To prevent 
water from getting into 
exposed speaker wire, 
it helps to dab a bit of 
silicone around the 
conneion to seal it.
Remember to 
position the speakers in 
your yard with the 
same care you would 
take when positioning 
them in your living 
room. Leave enough 
in-between space for 
proper ﬆereo 
separation, and face 
speakers inwards 
toward your desired 
sweet spot.  — G.D.

Q 
I love the new digital 3D movies that are coming 
to theaters. Is there any way I can watch my old  
two-dimensional DVDs in 3D? 
Bringing 3D Home
3D, and a decent number 
of plasmas can as well. If 
you’ve purchased an 
HDTV in the past few 
years, there’s a fair chance 
it can play 3D. (Check the 
back for an output labeled 
“3D sync.”)
If your TV is 3D-ready, 
you’ll also need a PC and 
the Samsung SSG1000 
3D conversion kit, which 
retails for $130. The kit 
comes with all the neces-
sary hardware for the con-
version, including a pair of 
3D glasses, as well as a 
computer program called 
TriDef Media Player that 
can transform your video 
ﬁles and DVDs into 3D as 
they play. Since the mov-
ies will be playing from 
your computer, you’ll need 
to output your PC’s video 
to your TV using an HDMI 
cord. If your PC doesn’t 
have an HDMI output, you can use its 
DVI jack and a DVI-to-HDMI adapter. 
The 3D effect works by showing 
your eyes the same image from 
slightly diﬀerent angles, creating the 
illusion of depth perception. In thea-
ters, this is done with plaﬆic polarized 
glasses that, when paired with 3D pro-
jectors and specially filtered movie 
screens, cause a diﬀerent piure to 
pass into each eye. Since your home 
TV doesn’t have these special lenses 
and ﬁlters, the home 3D kit requires a 
bit more technical trickery to pull oﬀ 
the illusion. It uses what are called 
A
Yes, you can. In fact, it’s surpris-
ingly easy to play any old 2D DVD 
in 3D on your home TV. And while it 
won’t be a Monsters vs. Aliens–level 
experience, it’s a good-enough holdover 
until the studios get around to releas-
ing home-3D versions of their growing 
catalogue of digital 3D movies.
First step: Find out if your TV is 
3D-capable. Now, before you tune 
out—“Oh great, I have to buy an expen-
sive new TV”—a surprising number of 
sets have this feature, though manu-
faurers rarely market it. In fa, every 
new DLP rear-projeion TV can play

For Mac users, there’s a similar down-
load called Open XML Converter.
Of course, many corporate IT 
departments limit employees’ ability 
to download and install new files  
on their computers. If you have this 
problem—or if you juﬆ want to open a 
ﬁle in a pinch—head to a Web-based 
ﬁle conversion site. ese sites take 
uploaded .docx files and e-mail you 
back a .doc version. My favorite is 
zamzar.com. It’s quick and easy, and it 
allows you to switch among juﬆ about 
every ﬁle format. 
Screen Saving
My iMac has a built-in monitor. Is 
there a way of using this as a second 
screen for another computer? 
When it comes to screen space, you 
can never go overboard. Large monitor 
and multiscreen set-
ups make it easy to 
multitask, and have 
been shown by a 
number of ﬆudies to 
booﬆ produivity. It’s 
a shame, then, that 
Apple doesn’t build 
video input jacks into 
its iMacs—these all-
in-one computers 
have a built-in moni-
tor, and it’d be nice to 
be able to use it with 
other systems. This 
would be particularly 
useful for laptop users 
looking for a way to 
expand screen space 
when they aren’t on the road.
But even without an input jack,  
you can ﬆill put an iMac to work as  
an external monitor for another com-
puter. You’ll need a program called 
ScreenRecycler, which employs what 
is called the VNC, or Virtual Network 
Computing, protocol. VNC is usually 
used as a way to allow one computer 
to remotely access and control 
 another, but ScreenRecycler uses it to 
turn the second computer into an 
adjun monitor. Note, though, that 
while the second screen can come 
from any type of computer (even a 
laptop), the com puter you’re working 
on has to be a Mac.  
FC
shutter glasses. A 3D-enabled TV 
refreshes its image 120 times per sec-
ond, but these battery-powered glass-
es eﬀeively split the image between 
your eyes by blacking out each lens 60 
times per second. A 3D emitter (which 
comes with the kit) tunes this ﬂicker-
ing, ensuring that the lenses are open 
at alternating times so each eye 
receives different images from the 
screen. And it happens so faﬆ that 
you can’t tell it’s going on.
As for the TriDef 3D conversion 
soware, I noticed that the program 
seems to produce much of its 3D 
eﬀe by pushing the bottom of the 
screen into the foreground and pro-
gressively sloping the upper part of 
the image into the background. “e 
basic assumption is that whatever is 
on the bottom of the screen is in 
front,” says Douglas Hunter, vice presi-
dent of licensing for Dynamic Digital 
Depth, the company that makes the 
TriDef soware. “But that’s juﬆ one of 
about 15 diﬀerent things the soware 
does in deciding the depth values for 
each obje. It’s also looking at things 
such as color, contraﬆ, motion and 
obje ﬆruure.” 
So what’s the inﬆa-3D experience 
like? It’s deﬁnitely more of a fun toy 
than an enjoyable way to watch 
 movies. I demoed the program on 
about a dozen teﬆ subjes. For the 
ﬁrﬆ few minutes, my subjes radiated 
wonder—like they were watching a 
moving piure or talkie for the ﬁrﬆ 
time. Freaks and Geeks in 3D! My DVD 
of old Residents music videos in 3D! 
(“Amazing!” “Wow!” “How the heck is 
this happening?”) But the initial excite-
ment soon subsided, and my guinea 
pigs inevitably asked me to turn the 
3D oﬀ. (“Can we juﬆ watch the movie 
normally now?”) Fact is, the experi-
ence is cool, and initially impressive, 
but it juﬆ isn’t enjoyable for very long. 
The main problem: A lack of 
 subtlety. e beﬆ digital 3D movies 
make deliberate use of the third 
dimension, either by throwing ﬆuﬀ at 
the audience’s face or by immersing 
the audience in the environment. e 
inﬆant 2D-to-3D soware doesn’t do 
that. It juﬆ pops things into the fore-
ground. Producing decent 3D footage 
is an art, and it’s not one that a simple 
PC program is able to replicate on the 
ﬂy. At leaﬆ not yet.
What’s Up, .doc?
I frequently get sent Microso Word 
ﬁles in the .docx format. But these 
won’t open in my older version of 
Microso Word. Is there any way of 
opening them without buying a new 
copy of Word? 
Yes. But ﬁrﬆ, a little background on the 
problem. ose old .doc Word ﬁles that 
you’re used to have been around for 
years, and are used by juﬆ about every-
body. There’s something wonderful 
about this ubiquity—if you send a  
.doc file to someone, you are pretty 
much guaranteed he will be able to 
read it. But the format is also very old—
its basic ﬆruure has remained  moﬆly 
unchanged for the paﬆ two decades. 
Beginning with Oﬃce 2007, Micro-
soft unveiled a new 
file format, called 
Open XML. This for-
mat uses the .docx 
extension, and is the 
default ﬁle format in 
Office 2007. These 
.docx files have sev-
eral advantages over 
the old .doc ﬁles. ey 
take up far less disc 
space 
(Microsoft 
claims the savings 
range from 25 to 50 
percent), offer more 
security 
against 
 viruses, and are less 
prone to being cor-
rupted. (In .doc ﬁles, if 
an embedded image is corrupted, the 
whole ﬁle is usually ruined. Not so with 
.docx ﬁles.) 
However, the .docx rollout was met 
by a backlash. The problem: Unless 
they are updated, older versions of 
Word are unable to read the new  
.docx ﬁles. In fa, juﬆ about every-
body I know who uses Office 2007 
chooses to save documents as .doc 
ﬁles, despite the .docx format’s tech-
nological superiority.
But there are ways around this 
problem. If you have an older version 
of Word, you can ﬆill open .docx ﬁles—
just go to Microsoft’s Web site and 
download a free update called the 
7qs?4Ls?jU
In the days of analog 
TV, broadcaﬆers were 
given buﬀers of extra 
bandwidth in between 
channels. But this extra 
space is unnecessary in 
the digital age, so the 
FCC recently ruled that 
anybody can broadcaﬆ 
on this white space—
provided they prove it 
won’t interfere with 
licensed broadcaﬆs. 
is could open up a 
new era of open 
wireless ﬆandards.

 Remodeling  
 will go more  
 smoothly if you  
 follow these  
 rules.
1. Check to see  
if you need a 
building permit—
for subﬆantial 
jobs, you do.
2. When sawing, 
planing or 
sanding, keep  
the mess outside, 
whenever 
possible.
3. Identify the 
location of pipes 
and wires in walls 
before you bang 
open any holes.
 e circular saw is the backbone  
 of every remodeling job. Here’s a  
 shopping guide. 
1. Saws come in le-blade 
versions (shown) and the more 
typical right-blade versions. A ley 
gives you a better view of the cut 
line; the tradeoﬀ is that it usually 
puts the weight of the motor on 
the scrap piece when you’re 
cutting lumber.
2. Get several blades. A 40-tooth 
blade is beﬆ for general use.  
Also buy plywood-cutting blades 
and, if you’re working with recycled 
lumber, blades rated for cutting 
nails. Other specialized  
blades can wait.

In our humble opinion, pegboard 
is the best thing to happen 
to the American shop since 
120-volt power. Okay, maybe 
compressed air is better than 
pegboard, but it’s a tough call.  
 Don’t put up with loose hooks   
 and junky hangers. Make your   
 own hardware  and fasten it with 
hey sheet-metal screws.
 Make the moﬆ of pegboard. 
1. When mounting it to drywall, use 1 x 2 ﬆock or ﬆrips of 3⁄4-inch plywood.  
e space behind the board will leave room to hang hooks and hardware.
2. Diﬆribute the load. Heavier objes need more subﬆantial hanging hardware. 
Large hammers, pry bars, shovels and rakes are beﬆ mounted through the 
pegboard to the wall framing or the wooden furring ﬆrips behind the board.
3. Attach magnetic bars to hold small tools and frequently used metal parts.
Hammers
Asymmetrical heads make 
hammers, hatchets and pry 
bars hard to hang evenly. e 
solution is to bend aluminum 
ﬂat ﬆock to make your own 
hanging hardware. Attach the 
brackets with hexhead 
sheet-metal screws.
Drivers
Tools with a sha and a 
handle, like screwdrivers 
and nut drivers, can hang 
with the handle up or 
down. Make the hanging 
hardware from ﬆeel or 
aluminum tubing, or 
L-shaped angle ﬆock.
Gripping and  
Cutting Tools
Pliers and diagonal  
cutters can ﬆraddle or slide 
behind a mount shaped 
from small-diameter bar 
ﬆock. Bend the ends into 
hooks, then shape the  
body into a rack.

PM advises reusing 
inner tubes from old 
tires as padding on 
sawhorses to prevent 
damage to delicate 
woodwork.
Use the butt end 
of a brick trowel 
to gently bump a 
brick into place. 
It’s not unusual to 
place a brick in its 
mortar bed and 
ﬁnd that you can’t 
shove it com-
pletely into 
position, which 
should be about 
1⁄16 to 1⁄8 inch set 
back from the 
mason’s line, and 
level across its 
width and length.  
 If you’re an  
 amateur  
 bricklayer, you’ll  
 ﬁnd that brick  
 trowels with a  
 bumper on the  
 end of the handle  
 are particularly  
 useful.  It may 
take a lot of 
bumping to  
nudge bricks into 
position.

It’s a lawn, not a putting green. 
To avoid cropping grass too short, 
ﬆressing the plants unnecessarily, 
set your mower to the higheﬆ or 
second-higheﬆ setting. 
Healthy soil, healthy grass. 
Cool-weather grass is hardy ﬆuﬀ.  
It grows well in soil with a pH 
anywhere between 6 and 7. Aerate 
soil annually and avoid compaion 
by foot traﬃc or machinery. 
A little dead grass is normal. 
But when that layer builds above a 
half-inch, it’s thatch. Remove it

  Faﬆen a sheet of 3⁄4-inch plywood to the ﬂoor below your washer and dryer.

 the bit will exit the scrap. 
Bore as you normally would. 
If the bit tears anything as it 
exits, it’ll tear the scrap, not 
the lumber, which will remain 
priﬆine. When you get a 
moment, ﬁle-sharpen the

mirror should be set to see ﬆraight back along the road, as moﬆ people

your head contas the window glass. I know, that seems too far. But truﬆ

the right-side mirror so you can, again, juﬆ see your own rear fender. Sit up

CHECK PIN PLACEMENT
Avoid common errors when changing

frequent miﬆake is to replace an 1157

retaining pins are located in diﬀerent 
parts of the bulb. Don’t try to force the 
wrong bulb into place.
A lot of mission-critical automotive faﬆeners use cotter pins to 
prevent inadvertent, spontaneous disassembly, which can be 
inconvenient, if not outright dangerous. ose cheapo cotter pins are 
supposed to be replaced every time they’re used. Sure. But  
sometimes, you juﬆ have to get home from an oﬀ-roading excursion, 
or maybe the hardware ﬆore is closed by the time you get to ﬁnal 
assembly at 3 am before the big race.   A safety pin will serve   
 temporarily.  And it will look so dorky you’ll be shamed into replacing 
it with the proper cotter pin as soon as you can.

 Polycarbonate headlamp lenses are prone to hazing up, and the discoloration   
 and milkiness can cause a huge reduion in nighttime visibility.  Head down 
to the auto-parts ﬆore or auto department at your local mass merchandiser 
and pick up a headlight-polishing kit. We’ve tried some from Turtle Wax, 
Loite and others; it only takes a half-hour or so to use one. Mask oﬀ the lens 
with tape to prote the paint and trim. en use the sandpaper in the kit, in 
successively ﬁner grades, to sand oﬀ the damaged layer of plaﬆic. Follow up 
with polishing compound on a rag, and the lens will look like new. Be sure to

Once you wrap up the rock, idle slowly along for a

ere’s one born every minute. 
Even back when gasoline was 
10 cents a gallon, motoriﬆs 
were ready to spend money to 
reduce their fuel bills. In 
decades of teﬆing, we’ve never 
found a gasoline-saving device 
that magically improved a car’s 
ability to squeeze more miles 
out of a gallon of petroleum. 
Any that claims to improve the 
combuﬆion inside your engine 
and make dramatically large 
reduions in your fuel con-
sumption probably can’t.

 You can, however, buy 
 inﬆruments that will help you
hone your driving skills for 
better economy.  ere are 
low-rolling-resiﬆance tires 
coming on the market that 
deliver better mileage without 
reducing grip. Fuel-injeion-
cleaner additives can some-
times reﬆore the original 
mileage and power to an 
engine whose performance 
has dropped oﬀ. But anything 
that sounds too good to be 
true probably is.

 Everybody knows how to jumpﬆart a car, right? 
Doing it wrong can potentially fry sensitive eleron-
ics. Shut oﬀ the donor car, hook ’em up—make the 
laﬆ conneion to the dead car’s engine block, not the 
battery poﬆ—and let the two batteries commune for 
a minute. Start the donor car engine and let it idle  
for 5 minutes. en ﬆart the dead car. 
A better way is to use a battery charger to 
recharge the dead battery at a normal rate.
A TRULY DEAD BATTERY WILL HAVE A VERY HIGH INTERNAL RESISTANCE.  IF YOU   
 JUMPSTART THE CAR, IT SHOULD RUN—BUT THE BATTERY WON’T TAKE MUCH   
 CHARGE, LEAVING YOU STRANDED WHEN YOU TRY TO START THE CAR AGAIN. 
IT MAY TAKE AS LONG AS 24 HOURS WITH A BATTERY CHARGER TO PUT ENOUGH 
CHARGE INTO A DEAD BATTERY TO LOWER THE INTERNAL RESISTANCE ADEQUATELY 
TO ACCEPT ANY CHARGING CURRENT. SO PATIENCE IS IN ORDER. ON THE OTHER 
HAND, A BATTERY THAT’S BEEN SO PROFOUNDLY DRAINED IS DAMAGED AND WILL 
NEVER HAVE THE SAME STORAGE ABILITY IT ONCE DID.

Adding an auxiliary circuit to new cars is tougher these days, 
because fuse boxes oen don’t have any extra positions for 
new wires. And splicing is so ... not cool. It’s also unreliable if 
not done properly.  is fuse adapter (jcwhitney.com) lets  
 you add a fused circuit without overloading anything.  Juﬆ 
pull a fuse out and put it into the bottom fuse holder on the 
adapter. e top fuse controls your new circuit. 
You can add a 
circuit that’s hot 
full-time or one 
that is switched 
on and oﬀ  
with a key.

Chattering wipers 
can make you 
dread rainy days.     
 Check the wiper   
 blade to make  
 sure it’s  
 perpendicular to   
 the window glass   
 at the center of   
 its arc.  Use a pair 
of wrenches to 
carefully twiﬆ the 
arm so the blade 
has the same 
angle to the glass 
as it sweeps in 
either direion. 
Juﬆ don’t scratch  
the glass!
