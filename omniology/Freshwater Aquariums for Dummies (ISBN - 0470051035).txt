About the Authors
Maddy and Mic Hargrove are both contributing writers for many aquatic
magazines, including Tropical Fish Hobbyist and Aquarium Fish magazine,
and are also the authors of several aquarium books. They have both been in
the writing industry for over 30 years.
Maddy’s interest in fish began when she was five years old.  She often dreamed
of keeping fish at home as she watched the local fishermen bring in their daily
catch in her hometown. She began keeping aquariums at age seven and began
breeding fish at age ten. She built her aquarium collection by selling and trad-
ing her newborn fry to local aquarium stores in exchange for aquariums and
equipment as she was growing up.
Her passion for aquarium fish continued on after she finished her college
degree in journalism and began writing aquarium-keeping articles for print
and online aquatic magazines. Eventually, she wrote several aquarium
columns and began writing fishkeeping books to help other hobbyists enjoy
keeping aquariums at home as much as she did. Her love of fish has also
appeared in her greeting cards, cartoons, and other artwork.
Mic has kept aquarium fish for almost 30 years. He was one of the first sailors
to develop a tank system that could keep aquarium fish alive onboard Navy
vessels. His love of fish began when he saw many different species, aquatic
traditions, and other hobbyists while on his worldwide military travels.
Both authors enjoy breeding fish, traveling, scuba diving, cooking and creat-
ing exciting new recipes, collecting old records, and computer games. 
Dedication
This book is dedicated to the memory of Maddy’s father who taught her 
the true beauty of the natural world in which we live. Thanks, Dad, wherever
you are.
Authors’ Acknowledgments
We would like to thank our editor Corbin for dedicating himself to making
this book great. We would also like to thank Claudette for her moral support
when it was needed most. And we would also like to thank our two dogs who
persistently reminded us that we needed to stop playing with fish and go out
for a good brisk walk now and then.

Introduction
W
elcome to the wonderful world of freshwater aquariums! Freshwater
Aquariums For Dummies, 2nd Edition, is a handy reference guide for
those who want the basics of setting up and maintaining an aquarium system.
Everything you need to know to get started on your very own freshwater
system can be found right here in this book.
In this book we tell you about tank styles and equipment, disease prevention
and cures, aquarium decoration, maintenance routines, species of fish and
their habits, test kits for your water, and tips on working with plants. And
much, much more. You’re likely to encounter all sorts of equipment and dif-
ferent fish species in pet shops, but all you need is the information contained
in this book to get you started on the road to successful fishkeeping. After
you master the basics, you will be able to venture into new areas of aquarium
keeping with confidence.
So sit back and journey into the fascinating world of freshwater aquariums,
gathering the basics of keeping your fish healthy and happy the easy way.
Your new aquatic pets will love you for it.
Why a Book for Dummies?
You may have heard horror stories about your neighbor’s aquarium. Or
maybe your best friend told you that his new aquarium that was in his
second floor apartment is now decorating the downstairs tenant’s apartment.
Okay, problems happen, but these rare aquarium misadventures can be
avoided with a proper knowledge of the basics. 
About 99 percent of all potential aquarium problems never occur if hobbyists
take the time to learn a few simple fishkeeping basics. Wet floors can be
mopped, and tanks can be repaired. Aquarium keeping will still move for-
ward, despite the occasional setbacks encountered from time to time.

2
Freshwater Aquariums For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
It’s really very easy to become a successful fishkeeper. All you need is a little bit
of help to get you going, which is exactly what this book provides. Freshwater
Aquariums For Dummies 2nd Edition gives you good, basic information and the
ammo you need to battle any problems that may occur as you live with your
aquarium.
What We Assume About You
If you’re an absolute beginner, never owned an aquarium before, or never
even fed a goldfish, then this book has all the information you need to get
started. We assume that you have no prior knowledge of how to set up an
aquarium or take care of fish.
However, if you do know a little something about fishkeeping, you’ll find this
book to be a great resource as well. You’ll discover how to keep your aquar-
ium cleaner and how to make your fish healthier. This book is for just about
anyone who’s the least bit interested in aquariums.
How to Use This Book
This book is a reference, not a tutorial. You don’t have to read it from Chapter
1 to the Appendix if you just want to get a glimpse of the hobby before you get
down to the basics. Just use the Table of Contents or Index to find the topics
that interest you and go from there. If you want to check out some cool fish,
turn to the freshwater species chapter first. If you want to look at a few plants,
there are chapters for those as well. Start with your needs and interests.
How This Book Is Organized
Even though this book is a nonlinear reference, we did go to the trouble of
organizing the chapters in a logical fashion. Here’s how things break down:
Part I: Aquarium Basics
The chapters in this part present all the information required to get an aquar-
ium started. From choosing and finding a good location for a tank and equip-
ment to adding artificial plants and substrate, you’ll find everything you need
to create a safe home for your fish.

Part II: Fish and How to Care for Them
In addition to telling you what makes fish tick, we run through all kinds of fish
species, detailing their behavior patterns, eating habits, and much more. On
top of all that, we offer some helpful tips on finding the right dealer from
whom to purchase your fish.
Taking care of your fish involves more than just sprinkling flakes into the tank
every morning on your way out the door. We explain what food options are
available, how to feed your aquatic pets properly, and tell you how to iden-
tify, treat, and prevent many common illnesses.
Part III: Water, Chemicals, and Plants 
A freshwater aquarium can really be outstanding with the addition of live
plants. Two chapters in this part give you the lowdown on plant species that
can make your aquarium more beautiful and also more hospitable for your
fish. You will check out some popular and beautiful plants and find out what
they need to stay healthy.
You also find out about how to make water safe for your aquarium, how to set
up your system, how the nitrogen cycle affects your new tank, and what to do
if you have a problem with your aquarium. We all have problems now and
then, but this is where you find solutions.
Part IV: Breeding and Other Fun Stuff
What do the birds and the bees have to do with fish? The chapters in this
part tell the breeding story. If you’re interested in getting your fish to mate,
this is where you find out how. You also learn how to keep track of your fish,
photograph them, and enter your aquatic pets into fish shows.
Once you have mastered the freshwater basics, we give you a quick glimpse
into the world of marine fishkeeping so that you will have other exciting
avenues to explore.
Part V: The Part of Tens
This part consists of several fun lists. It’s sort of a way for us to squeeze a
bunch of extra information at the back of the book in as succinct a way as pos-
sible. Here are some really cool and helpful aquarium gadgets, a few useful
aquatic New Year’s resolutions, and some often overlooked scientific fish laws.

Introduction

Icons Used in This Book
If you’ve flipped through this book at all, you’ve probably noticed little pic-
tures, called icons, in the margins. Here’s what they mean:
This icon indicates good advice and information that will help you keep your
fish healthy and safe.
When we discuss a task or procedure that might be problematic, we use this
icon. It also points out things that might be dangerous to you or your fish.
This icon flags information that’s, well, technical, and you can go ahead and
skip that paragraph if you want to.
When we make a point or offer some information that we feel you should
keep with you forever, we toss in this icon.
We hope you enjoy reading this book as much as we did writing it. Sit back,
read, and then start your own aquarium adventure!
Where to Go from Here
If you don’t already own fish and don’t know how to set up an aquarium, start
with Part I. If you have a little more background in fishkeeping, maybe you
want to check out the species guide in Part II. Or maybe the chapter on live
plants in Part III has caught your fancy. Go ahead and skip around. That’s
what this book is for.

Part I
Aquarium Basics

In this part . . .
I
t’s time to enter the world of freshwater aquariums.
The first six chapters of this book provide an overview
of aquariums and aquarium equipment such as heaters,
pumps, and filters. These chapters provide the mechani-
cal and technological foundation necessary to bring your
tanks to life. 

Chapter 1
Tanks for the Memories
In This Chapter
 Understanding the basics of aquariums
 Looking at what goes in an aquarium
 Understanding fish and plant choices
 Expanding your hobby
W
e think some of the most pleasurable moments in our lives life have
involved aquarium keeping. There is a special excitement that comes
with owning a beautiful tank full of wonderful fish and plants. Most people
have either owned an aquarium, lived in a house with a fish tank, or dreamed
of putting one together.
Maddy remembers the first time her fish had babies. Her little heart was ready
to burst with excitement and pride! She stayed up all night watching the new
fry adjusting to their new world. She also remembers getting a $20 gift certifi-
cate for her 10th birthday that she could redeem at the local fish store. She
walked to that store feeling like she had just won the lottery. (Okay, she
admits that she is older than dirt, and $20 bought a lot in those days.)
She can still remember entering the store the day after her birthday and just
feeling like she was in a whirlwind of new and exciting discoveries as she saw
isle after isle of equipment and tank after tank of fish. Sound like fun? Well it
is more than fun; aquarium keeping is hobby that can bring joy throughout
your entire lifetime.
Many people think aquarium fish are harder to keep than other pets. This is
simply not true. Everyone pretty much knows how to feed, water, and walk a
dog, but many tend to shy away from setting up an aquarium because they
worry about the minor details too much. Never fear, this book will show you
how simple fishkeeping can really be so that you can start building your own
memories.

8
Part I: Aquarium Basics 
You can be successful at any hobby you choose by simply understanding the
basics:
 In this book you will learn the basic building blocks of an aquarium
system such as tanks, gravel, equipment, plants, and fish.
 In this book you will learn how to make choices that will suit your needs
and ideas so that you can make the perfect aquatic world that will bring
you years of enjoyment and pleasure!
 In this book you will find many ways to expand your aquarium-keeping
hobby.
Well, now that you are ready to get started on your new adventure into the
wonderful world of fishkeeping, let’s get going and see what else you are
going to learn as you read this book.
If you have other immediate family members living with you, such as chil-
dren, don’t forget to get them involved in the aquarium decisions as well. By
involving others, you will be able to share your new hobby from day one with
those you love.
Seeing the Big Aquarium Picture
If you look at an aquarium from all sides and from the top, you will quickly
see that it is just a glass, plastic, or acrylic box with a bunch of things added
to it. It is as simple as that. 
You may be asking yourself a few questions: What is the function of all this
equipment, and how does the tank use them to run? Does it matter which fish
and plants I choose? Is there a special type of water in the tank? How do I
feed and care for my fish and plants? 
These are all very good questions, and you have come to the right place for
answers. Let’s take a brief look and preview some of the main aquatic ques-
tions that people have when they are figuring out how to set up an aquarium. 
Where do I put my tank?
People wonder where they should place an aquarium in their home. There
are good places and bad places. Tanks should be placed away from direct
sunlight and drafts. There are also household traffic issues and electrical con-
siderations to take into account as well.

In Chapter 3 you learn how certain places in a room can affect the water tem-
perature of your tank. You will also learn about how high-traffic areas have an
impact on your fish, how close your water source needs to be to your tank,
what electrical supply is required, and how much space will be ample to set
up the tank that you want.
Every home has numerous spots to put an aquarium, and after reading
Chapter 3, you will know exactly where to put your tank so that your fish will
be safe and happy.
What type of tank and 
stand should I buy?
There are many sizes and shapes of aquariums and stands on the market-
place, and you may be wondering if you should start out with a small tank or
a large tank. In Chapter 4, you learn that starting out with a larger tank will
provide a more stable environment for your fish.
In that chapter you also learn the difference between glass, acrylic, and plas-
tic aquariums. You will be given the information needed to purchase an
aquarium stand that works best for your needs. Chapter 4 also shows you
how to correctly move an aquarium if you ever decide to set your tank up in
a different location or in a new home.
What do I put inside my aquarium?
When you look at different aquariums, you will see that they contain many
different combinations of rocks, decorations and interesting objects such as
driftwood. No big mystery here. Some items are necessary for your tank to
run properly, and others are not.
In Chapter 5, you learn that gravel and/or other substrates are necessary for
your aquarium. You also learn that the type and number of decorations in an
aquarium come down to matter of individual taste (though some species do
well with certain additions such as rock caves), and that this is an area that
you can really let your creativity, decorating skills, and good taste shine.
Chapter 5 shows you what types of substrates there are and gives you good
information on the types of decorations available. The chapter also gives you
a good excuse to spend your “mad money” on cool-looking stuff.
9
Chapter 1: Tanks for the Memories

What does all this aquarium 
equipment do?
Most new hobbyists get very confused when it comes down to deciding what
equipment to purchase. As you find out in Chapter 6, there are many different
options to choose from.
Chapter 6 explains filters, heaters, lighting, pumps, airstones, thermometers,
tubes, valves, and hoods. In that chapter you will also learn the most impor-
tant rule when it comes to purchasing equipment: Always buy the best that
your budget will allow.
When it comes to setting up an aquarium, there are no shortcuts. You can’t
rush your down to your aquarium store, buy a bunch of stuff, and expect to
have fish swimming around in your new tank within an hour. If you take the
time to set up an aquarium properly, you will have fewer problems later on
down the road.
Caring for Your New Aquatic Pets
Once you have read through the chapters that show you how to set up an
aquarium system, you need to start thinking about what other things you will
need to take care of the fish you will be purchasing. You will also have to get
a general idea of what type of fish you will be purchasing so that you know
what types of plants you will need and how to set up water conditions that
are just right for the species you choose.
Why are so many fish so different?
A fish’s physical makeup (fin shape and size, body shape, color, and so on) is
important when determining what type of fish and what type of aquarium is
needed for that particular species. For example, long, thin, streamlined fish
such as danios tend to be speedy horizontal swimmers and love a tank that is
long and not tall. 
Chapter 7 explains the physical makeup of aquatic species so that you can
understand what system your fish will enjoy most. This chapter also allows
you to quickly see if there is a problem such as stress or disease by observing
any deviation from your fish’s normal body shape, fin shape, and swimming
patterns. 
10
Part I: Aquarium Basics 

Knowledge is not only power, it is also the best preventative method on earth
for diagnosing aquarium problems before they get out of hand.
What type of fish is best for me?
There are so many choices in aquarium fish; you may wonder, where is the
best place to start? Chapter 8 gives you a good selection of popular aquarium
fishes so that you have a many good options to choose from right off the bat.
Of course, there are numerous other fish not listed in that chapter. It would
take volumes to describe all the species available. Chapter 8 offers excellent
choices for beginning hobbyists. These fishes are inexpensive, easy to find, for-
giving of beginner mistakes, and will help get any aquarium off to a good start.
What should I look for when buying fish?
The best way to start out as a beginning fishkeeper is to develop a good rela-
tionship with a local pet store. A quality vendor can help you make decisions
on the best way to set up or improve your system. They can also make good
suggestions on fish compatibility and lend a hand if your fish become ill.
Chapter 9 helps you learn how to choose quality dealers and develop good
relationships with them. This chapter also shows you how to select healthy
fish for your new aquarium by providing information on how to evaluate the
physical attributes and behavior of fish in a store.
The World Wide Web is a great place to find fish, plants, and equipment for
your new aquarium, but nothing beats the wonderful feeling of walking
through a tropical fish store and seeing everything up close with a helpful
dealer at your side.
What should I feed my fish?
We all know that you can buy canned fish food. But nutrition goes beyond
pre-manufactured dry food. Many species of fish have different nutritional
requirements.
Chapter 10 helps you understand basic aquatic nutrition and shows you what
and how to feed your fish properly.
11
Chapter 1: Tanks for the Memories

A well-balanced diet for you fish can include prepackaged, frozen food, live
food, and in some cases fresh vegetables.
What if my fish get sick?
Despite having the best setup possible, fish will eventually contract disease
from time to time. This is usually not a cause for alarm because most fish ill-
nesses can be cured.
Chapter 11 helps you identify stress, spot common problems ahead of time to
prevent disease, treat common illnesses, set up a hospital tank to treat dis-
ease, and understand the importance of a quarantine tank to avoid introduc-
ing sickness into your main tank with newly purchased fish.
Never buy ill fish with the noble idea of taking them home and nursing them
back to health. This practice will endanger your other fish and risk upsetting
your current system. 
Understanding Water, Chemicals, 
and Live Plants
In Part III, you learn many important new concepts:
 Chapter 12 shows you which water is safe to use in your aquarium.
 Chapter 13 helps you to understand what chemicals you can use to
improve your aquarium conditions.
 Chapter 14 explains the nitrogen cycle and water testing so that your
aquarium water will be perfect for your fish and plants.
 Chapter 15 describes the steps that are necessary to set up examples of
a freshwater, coldwater, and indoor mini pond.
 Chapter 16 helps you understand the nature of live plants and what is
required to keep them healthy and happy in a home aquarium.
 Chapter 17 offers some good examples of plants that are great choices
for beginning aquarium keepers.
 Chapter 18 is a quick guide to fixing the most common aquarium problems.
Cool! A lot of great new stuff to learn!

Part I: Aquarium Basics 

Expanding Your Aquarium Hobby
Setting up and maintaining an aquarium is only the beginning. If you want to
expand your hobby, you can do many fun and interesting projects.
Can I breed my fish?
Many hobbyists love to breed their fish for fun and profit. If you become
really good at breeding, you may even come up with a new color or pattern
for the world to enjoy. Chapter 19 helps you find the right water conditions,
feeding schedule, plants, and equipment for breeding fish. It also tells you
how to help coax your fish into mating. When you get to Chapter 20, you will
learn how to decide which fish to breed, how to select strong breeding traits,
the best way to care for fry and protect them from other fish, and how to suc-
ceed in this wonderful and challenging aspect of the hobby.
How do I keep track of all my fish?
Many hobbyists are concerned about remembering every fish and the prob-
lems and success they have had with each species. Chapter 21 helps you cut
through the clutter by teaching you how to accurately record fish data and
photograph your fish for fun, education, and potential profit.
How do fish shows work?
Like dog shows, fish also have their own competitions. Fish shows can be a
lot of fun. Chapter 22 explains how to get your fish in top form, the best way
to transport your aquatic friends to a show, how to set up once you arrive,
and the standards by which your species will be judged.
Is there another type of aquarium system?
Once you have mastered the basics of freshwater fishkeeping, Chapter 23
gives you a brief overview of the marine (saltwater) side of the hobby. This
chapter also shows you where to find good information on setting up an
aquarium for those oh-so-beautiful marine species of fish and invertebrates.

W
elcome you to the world’s greatest hobby! We have always loved fish-
keeping, and know that you will, too. This book can help you achieve
your goal of setting up and maintaining a successful freshwater aquarium.
Aquarium keeping is one of the fastest growing hobbies in the world, so get
ready to dive right in.
Imagine: It’s eight o’clock at night and you’re just getting home from the
office, where you spent the final half hour listening to your irate boss rant
and rave about problems beyond your control. Your ears are still ringing,
your head is pounding, and your mood is ugly. You walk in the front door of
your home, plop down in your best easy chair, and let the healing therapy
begin.
Directly in front of you is your beautifully maintained 55-gallon aquarium. In
your private underwater world, you can see bright green plants waving softly
in the gentle current. The clear water soothes your tired eyes as it swirls end-
lessly through the tank. A frolicking mix of brightly colored guppies and
platys dart merrily though a hole in a piece of driftwood. The smooth peb-
bles on the aquarium floor gently reflect the dazzling array of fish colors. The
faint soothing bubbling from the filter reminds you that there is always a
place you can go to relax and get away from it all right in your own home.
Hey, your aquarium sounds fantastic! Can we come over?

The Benefits of an Aquarium
Okay, it’s time to snag a comfortable chair and travel with me through the
marvelous world of freshwater aquarium keeping. There are a lot of great rea-
sons for having aquatic pets in your home. Fishkeeping is a hobby that the
whole family can participate in and enjoy together. A fish tank is a great way
to teach children the responsibility of animal care as well as the biological
principles that go hand in hand with their own species’ daily survival. The
older generation can also benefit as well — scientific research shows that
aquariums can help lower stress and prolong life.
Another advantage of keeping an aquarium is that the tanks don’t require a
lot of space, and are perfect for apartment dwellers who may be prohibited
from owning larger, roaming pets, such as dogs and cats. You can match an
aquarium to almost any space that you have. You can get a tank that takes up
an entire wall in your home, or one small enough to fit on your desk — and
every size in between. And speaking of desktops, an aquarium in your office
is a great way to spend a little bit of time goofing off each day without your
boss finding out. Besides, your coworkers will think you’re cool if you have a
tank that they can come look at.
Other advantages to keeping aquariums are that fish don’t bark at the neigh-
bors, caterwaul at the moon, chase the letter carrier, make unsightly messes
on the floor, or whimper all night. You probably will never have to bail an
escaped renegade goldfish out of the local pound, either.
If you need to go on a vacation, fish are the perfect pets to leave home alone.
As you will learn later on in this book, there are many ways to feed and main-
tain your fish while you are away. No need to find daily petsitters for your
aquatic friends, because today’s aquarium technology allows you to spend
your time enjoying your vacation instead of worrying about your fish.
An aquarium encourages your artistic side to run wild when it comes to
aquatic decorating, and you won’t find another hobby quite as soothing —
nothing compares to dipping your tired arms into nice cool water to do a little
underwater planting or rearranging. It beats periodically putting a new collar
on your dog any day. Aquariums are great because aquascaping allows you
some real hands-on interaction with your aquatic pet’s amazing environment.
Daily care and maintenance of a home aquarium is fairly simple, and really
doesn’t require a great deal of time or money. You can set up a complete
aquarium system with a relatively little investment, as long as you don’t go
overboard at the beginning and are content to add to your system as you go
along. But if you’re like me, you may find yourself paying off several charge
accounts at your local pet shops.

Setting up and maintaining an aquarium is simply a matter of learning and fol-
lowing basic rules. That is what this book is for. Knowledge is the key to suc-
cess, and you’re making a good start by buying this book. But you can also
keep current on future fishkeeping trends by joining local fishkeeping soci-
eties, and from many other sources, such as libraries, magazines, and the
World Wide Web. A little research can go a long way and make all the differ-
ence between complete success and unnecessary failure. Do your homework
well and you’ll be prepared to handle any aquatic situation.
What Kind of Aquarium Do You Want?
You are starting out in the freshwater side of the hobby, which is why you
purchased this book. Good choice! This book focuses on freshwater systems,
but the following gives a good glimpse of what you might want to dive into
after you have mastered the basics of freshwater fishkeeping.

Chapter 2: The Practice of Aquarium Keeping
Aquariums of old
The ancient Egyptians are generally believed to
be the first “true” aquarium keepers. Historical
evidence suggests that Egyptians kept fish in
ponds as a source of food, and smaller species
in their homes to impress their friends. (We
don’t know if they had pyramid-shaped aquari-
ums back then, but we kind of doubt it.)
High-ranking Roman officials are rumored to
have kept ponds full of hungry eels. If an eel-
keeping official happened to have a politically
uncooperative neighbor . . . well, the neighbor
may have gotten a fish-eye view of their good
buddy’s aquatic pets.
From Rome, fishkeeping began spreading in the
Far East. Oriental aquarists became so fascinated
with the common goldfish that they went into
aquatic hyperdrive and started selectively breed-
ing them at a rapid rate. Needless to say, they
came up with a bunch of cool-looking goldfish!
Public aquariums began to show up in Europe
in the late 1800s. Those first aquariums were
quite a bit different that the ones we have today
and displayed only a few different species.
Later on, expensive glass aquariums were man-
ufactured for the elegant homes of the rich and
famous. Unfortunately, because they were
heated by open flames or oil lamps, these prim-
itive tanks were unsafe. Often, members of high
society with aquariums ended up with a very
large pile of ashes where their mansions once
stood (and a fish fry dinner).
During these early, dark days of aquarium keep-
ing, hobbyists had to make do with makeshift
equipment and scary potions. The situation
finally began to improve in the 1900s when fish
shows and aquarium societies (fish nerds gath-
ered together in one place) emerged to help the
increasing number of hobbyists maintain their
tanks.
Today we have the best of the aquarium-keep-
ing world. Top-of-the-line equipment, caring
breeders, and expanding species availability
allows anyone to keep a home aquarium with
ease. Technology has made it easier than ever
to keep our aquatic pets healthy and happy.

The aquarium hobby has three general types of systems to set up: saltwater,
freshwater, and brackish. Individual types of fish, tanks, equipment, and
plants vary dramatically from system to system. Here is a brief overview of
each type of setup to give you a better idea how space considerations, initial
financial outlay, difficulty level, and availability of species may effect your
decision to try other systems after freshwater.
Freshwater systems
The most popular type of aquarium is a freshwater system. It’s the most prac-
tical system for a beginning aquarist for several reasons:
 A freshwater system is not quite as expensive to set up as a saltwater
system. (Saltwater systems require larger tanks and extra equipment;
see the “Marine systems” section later in this chapter.)
 Freshwater fish are generally less expensive than marine fish. It’s
much better to work with less expensive fish when you’re just starting
out, and still learning the ins and outs of the hobby.
 Freshwater fish are readily available at most aquarium shops and
come in a wide variety of colorful species. Many hardy species, such as
guppies, platys, and swordtails, are very easy to keep and do not have
difficult special requirements. Marine fish are much more sensitive to
water conditions and don’t tolerate mistakes as easily.
 Many varieties of freshwater fish breed quite easily. Breeding freshwa-
ter fish may provide you with opportunities to sell your overstock (don’t
quit your day job, though) and a chance to experiment with new breeds.
 You can have more fish. You can keep significantly more freshwater fish
than marine fish in the same amount of space.
Freshwater systems come in either tropical or coldwater varieties. Each has
slightly different equipment requirements and houses different types of fish.
Freshwater tropical aquariums
Freshwater tropical aquariums house the majority of retail freshwater fish. If
you choose a tropical system, you can set up a community aquarium with a
variety of species that can coexist peacefully. Or you may decide to try a
species tank for a more aggressive fish family, such as cichlids. A freshwater
tropical aquarium offers a huge number of choices in livestock and plants to
suit everyone’s individual taste.
18
Part I: Aquarium Basics 

Most tropical freshwater fish are inexpensive and pretty easy to keep, which
is why this is the best system for a beginning hobbyist. You can also pur-
chase an aquarium system at many superstores and pet stores in kit form. A
kit generally includes a tank, hood, filter, net, food, instruction book, and the
heater necessary for a tropical tank. A kit often doesn’t include gravel, plants,
or decorations that must be purchased separately. Always read the box label
so that you will know what extras you will need to buy to get the tank up and
running properly. Pet stores and large retail stores are great places to find
these starter kits, which are a good buy for the money.
Popular species of tropical freshwater fish include these:
 Platys
 Guppies
 Mollies
 Neons
 Swordtails
 Angelfish
 Bettas
 Tetras
 Barbs
And that’s just to name a few.
Freshwater coldwater aquariums
A coldwater aquarium usually houses species such as these:
 Goldfish
 Sunfish
 Shiners
 Bitterlings
In their native habitat, these fish normally live in lower temperatures than
their tropical counterparts. Large koi are often kept in coldwater ponds. The
equipment you need for a coldwater aquarium is similar to that for a tropical
aquarium, except that coldwater tanks don’t require a heating system. Larger
tanks are better for this type of system because coldwater species are gener-
ally bigger than most tropicals and consume more oxygen.
19
Chapter 2: The Practice of Aquarium Keeping

Special consideration must be taken when choosing plants for a coldwater
system because many plants can’t survive the lower temperatures. Room
temperature is a factor in coldwater aquarium setups as well, because many
homes are kept very warm which can affect the temperature of your tank.
Aside from goldfish, coldwater fish can be difficult to obtain in many areas of
the country. Setting up a coldwater system drastically reduces your choices
of fish and live plants, unless your local dealer can special order them if he
does not have them in stock. The World Wide Web is an excellent place to
purchase coldwater fish, as you can see in Chapter 9.
Marine systems
Marine or saltwater systems, not surprisingly, require saltwater. You see
marine fish on scuba and underwater nature programs. The most popular of
these fish includes the coral reef species often found living in close proximity
to various invertebrates (animals without backbones, such as anemones), and
are often very colorful and quite beautiful. But don’t fool yourself, beauty has
its price. Saltwater fish and invertebrates that go in their aquariums can be
very expensive.
The saltwater used in a marine system is usually obtained by mixing fresh
water with a manufactured salt mix. A good filtration system is important in
marine tanks to keep the oxygen levels high and the ammonia levels low.
Marine fish have a lower tolerance to ammonia (a fish waste product) than
freshwater species do, and an inadequate filter soon leads to disaster in a
saltwater tank.
Gaining a little experience with a freshwater tropical or coldwater system is a
great way to prepare yourself to enter the marine side of the hobby. Don’t get
me wrong. A beginner can maintain a successful marine tank, but the lessons
you learn can be very expensive. We see many new hobbyists become dis-
heartened with fishkeeping because they start out with a marine setup that’s
just too much for them to handle. If you have a close friend who is experi-
enced in marine systems, ask her for advice—she may be able to help you get
started successfully. And check out Saltwater Aquariums For Dummies, 2nd
Edition by Greg Skomal (Wiley Publishing, 2006).
Brackish systems
The brackish aquarium is the least popular of all the three systems, simply
because the fish are generally difficult to find in many local pet stores and are
usually more expensive than freshwater tropical fish. The water in a brackish
aquarium lies somewhere between fresh and marine in salt content.
20
Part I: Aquarium Basics 

Here are some popular species for a brackish system:
 Monos
 Archers
 Puffers
 Scats
The equipment for a brackish system is similar to that for a freshwater setup,
but only specific plants can tolerate a brackish system.
Organization Is the Key to Success
One of the keys to success in almost any project is organizing your goals and
ideas. If you’re like me, you own one of those all-purpose planners that weigh
about as much as the family car. This would be a good time to start using it. If
you don’t have a planner, and your earliest memory goes back to yesterday’s
breakfast, then you should probably begin your aquarium project by making a
simple list. Even if you have a good memory, go ahead and make a list anyway.
A good list provides you with a set of short- and long-term goals to help you
set up and maintain your new aquarium system. For example, your short-
term goals may include purchasing your tank and equipment and picking out
a few starter fish. Long-term goals may be breeding your fish and trying dif-
ferent types of systems. By setting a few goals, you give yourself a plan to
follow. You can begin your own list of goals as you read through this book.
A little knowledge can spell the difference between success and ultimate fail-
ure. We realize that “research” may bring up frightening memories of school
librarians, but there are other practical ways to gain knowledge. With the
advent of the Internet, aquarists can access current information on the aquar-
ium hobby. Here are a few good places to start:
 www.aquaria.info
 www.aquariuminfosite.com
 freshaquarium.about.com
 www.aquahobby.com/links/
It is important to keep researching the type of system you’re interested in, even
after you have it set up. By researching a fish’s natural environment and finding
out how and where it lives in the wild, you arm yourself to provide your fish
with the best aquarium conditions and environment possible. A natural, stress-
free environment promotes long and healthy lives for your wet pets.
21
Chapter 2: The Practice of Aquarium Keeping

As mentioned previously, this book focuses on freshwater systems so that
you can gain a strong foothold on the basics of keeping a successful aquar-
ium. After you have mastered the basics of freshwater aquariums, your
choices will become unlimited, and you may want to continue your adven-
tures in the hobby by trying other types of setups.

Finding a Good Location
In This Chapter
 Understanding room temperature and your fish
 Running your fish ragged
 Finding a water source
 Considering space, electricity, and cleaning
W
hen you are looking for a good place to set up your aquarium, keep in
mind that physical aspects of your home can have a major effect on
its success or failure. Carefully inspect the area where you plan to set up
your aquarium to check for a few easily avoided hazards. A little good judg-
ment and patience goes a long way.
To start you off, we examine a few common physical problems that can occur
when aquariums are placed in inadequate spots. (Check out Chapter 4 for
some of the psychological aspects of tank placement.) We know, you’re prob-
ably like us and are bound and determined to put an aquarium on a flimsy
breakfast bar no matter what the cost. Well, after a few days of poached eggs
floating around in your tank and greasy fingerprints all over the aquarium
glass, not to mention that the breakfast bar is sagging under the aquarium’s
weight, you probably will be forced to change your mind. So start your aquar-
ium in the right place from the very beginning and save yourself a bunch of
migraines later on.
Room Temperature and Its Effects
Most aquariums need a stable water temperature. Extreme changes in tem-
perature can lower your pets’ immune systems and increase their risk of con-
tracting disease, and even cause your fish to die in a tropical tank. Heaters
can keep your water temperature high enough to prevent your fish from
becoming floating fishcicles. But if you place your aquarium in a room where
the temperature is 20 below zero, your heaters are going to go south for the
winter, and your aquarium is going to be an ice sculpture. The point is, your
heaters can only handle so much.

24
Part I: Aquarium Basics 
Too high of a water temperature can also cause death. Poor water conditions
such as fluctuating temperatures can cause another problem: As water tem-
perature rises, the water loses oxygen. After a short period of time in a hot
tank, your fish start gasping at the surface and can eventually die of asphyxi-
ation. Extreme temperatures can damage their scales, fins, and other physical
aspects as well. One piece of equipment designed to keep water temperature
down is a chiller, but this can be very expensive.
The most important thing to remember is that your room should not change
the temperature of your aquarium more than a few degrees from the norm
(normal temperature depends on our species of fish and is covered later in
this book).
So now you know not to put your aquarium in an area that is too cold or too
hot. You may be thinking, “But my house is well insulated.” And you’re proba-
bly right, but two things in even the best-insulated homes can cause tempera-
ture fluctuations: Windows and doors.
Wicked windows
Windows may seem innocent enough, but an aquarium placed near one is
going to have several problems. When normal, direct sunlight shines on an
aquarium, the water temperature can reach lethal levels in a period of just a
few hours if the windows have thin curtains or blinds. Heavy drapes and
thick blinds can help to block out enough light to prevent this problem if you
have nowhere else to put your tank. 
Placing your aquarium near a window may also promote a tremendous over-
growth of algae. I’m not talking about a little algae — we’re talking about your
aquarium looking like a golf course. Once algae begins to overrun your aquar-
ium, it can be really difficult to get rid of.
Starting out right
Nothing is more frustrating than having to move
an aquarium because you put it in a place that
just isn’t working out for one reason or another.
Aquariums are very heavy when fully loaded
and must be drained to be moved to a new loca-
tion. Don’t spend a lot of time setting up a tank
if you’re not completely sure about its location.
It’s better to take a day or two and look over
your options than to just put up the aquarium
without any forethought. Start out on the right
foot if you want to be successful.

The opposite is also true. In colder areas of the country, drafts and chilly air
can seep through windows and lower the temperature of your tank. The best
thing to do overall is to avoid placing an aquarium by a window.
Keep an eye on your window for a day during normal sunlight hours to get a
good idea of just how far and brightly the sun’s rays reach inside your
window. Place your aquarium beyond the outermost limits of the sun’s poten-
tially lethal grasp. Putting the aquarium in an area with good air circulation
and ventilation will help to avoid hot or cold spots in the tank as well.
Deadly doors
There are two types of doors in most homes: Interior doors that connect
rooms and exterior doors that lead outside. Both types can wreak havoc on
your aquarium in different ways:
 Exterior doors can be very drafty. Every time someone opens a door in
wintertime, cold air seeps in. It doesn’t take long for an aquarium to chill
under these conditions. Place your tank well away from any outside
doors to avoid drafts.
 Interior doors may be safe from cold drafts, but they can be deadly if
they hit your aquarium. It seems that most doorknobs are at a perfect
level to slam into the glass on many tanks. We have seen many expen-
sive aquariums broken by a door that has been hastily flung open. If you
must place an aquarium near a door, open the door a few times to make
sure that it has plenty of room to safely clear your tank.
High Traffic Areas and Children 
(Spell D-I-S-A-S-T-E-R)
High-traffic areas are those places in your house where the carpet is con-
stantly dirty or worn. (I have two teenagers, so unfortunately that’s about 90
percent of my house.) Anyway, high-traffic spots such as hallways, entrance-
ways, kitchens, and so on are not good places for your aquarium. Constant
movement along the tank’s glass also tends to keep many species of fish con-
tinually spooked. Fear leads to stress. Stress leads to disease. Disease leads
to death. This is a very simple but all too frequent pattern.
25
Chapter 3: Finding a Good Location

To avoid freaking your fish out all day, place them in a nice quite spot such as
a corner in the living room or den. These types of rooms give your fish an
opportunity to get used to people occasionally moving around them, without
overloading them with constant traffic 24 hours a day.
Children are another major problem for aquariums. Children can tend to get a
little wild sometimes. If you have children, we haven’t told you anything you
don’t already know. Even if you don’t have children living in the house, you
may have neighbor kids or nieces and nephews who come over once in a
while. Aquariums can be great learning tools for children, but youngsters
need to be reminded that the fish have needs and wants that have to be con-
sidered in the overall scheme of things.
When you have young children in your home, you childproof rooms by lock-
ing up chemicals, putting away sharp objects, and hiding anything that can
harm them. You need to do the same thing with your aquarium. If you have
young children, place the aquarium where the kids have a hard time getting
at it, such as on top of a large cabinet-style stand in an area you’re in fre-
quently. Make sure your aquarium is on a solid stand that will not move
easily if someone bumps into it. If your family spends most of its time in the
family room, that’s a great place to have the aquarium so that you can keep a
close eye on it when your children are near.
A few examples of childhood play that can be devastating to your aquatic
friends include the following:
 Tossing a Nerf ball back and forth in front of the tank (guaranteed to give
your fish whiplash)
 Floating toy boats on top of the aquarium water
 Practicing finger painting on the tank’s glass.
Now, if you were a fish, what would you think of all these situations? A fish
may likely think that it’s about time to check out and visit that great fishbowl
in the sky as it is gasping at the UFO in your home. Give your fish a break by
teaching your children to respect their aquatic pet’s privacy. Remind them
that fish are like all other animals on earth and need a little bit of relaxation
to wind down.
Water Sources
One important thing to remember when placing your aquarium is the avail-
ability of a water faucet. Nobody wants to spend hours of backbreaking work
hauling water around. You have to have water to fill up your tank when you
26
Part I: Aquarium Basics 

first set it up, and you also need to top off your tank from time to time as the
water evaporates. And don’t forget those weekly water changes. All that
water lugging gets old quickly.
It’s best to use a faucet that other family members don’t use very often so
you don’t inconvenience them by using the tap all the time. A faucet in a
spare bathroom is an excellent place to work from.
Checking the source
Make sure that the water you are going to use is free from heavy metals and
other hazardous content. For example, if you are using water from an old well
or any other source that may contain large amounts of iron and other metals,
take a sample to your local water company or university and see if they will
test it for you to make sure that it is safe for not only your own consumption
but for your fish as well.
City water has chlorine, but that can all be removed using dechlorinator from
your local fish store.
Using a Python
Don’t panic — we’re not talking about a snake here. A Python is actually an
amazing aquarium vacuum that can be found at most fish stores. It’s a long,
clear water hose with one end that connects to your sink faucet. (Depending
on your fixture, you may have to purchase an adapter.) The other end of the
Python has a large plastic tube that suctions up water and gathers debris
from around the substrate (gravel or other aquarium floor covering). The
faucet end has a little gadget that you push up or down to direct the water to
either go from the faucet to the end of the hose or to suck water from the
other end so that water spills into the sink.
Pythons are usually available in many lengths at pet shops. Get one long
enough to hook one end up to the sink and suck the water out of the aquar-
ium with the other. To replace the water, reverse the python’s plastic switch,
put the other end in a clean bucket by your aquarium, and fill it up. After
adding dechlorinator, pick up the bucket and slowly pour the water into your
aquarium. This method is much easier than hauling water back and forth
across your home. Make sure the water you are adding is the same tempera-
ture as the water in the tank by using a thermometer.
27
Chapter 3: Finding a Good Location

Other Considerations
There are a few other things to keep in mind when deciding where to place
your tank.
Furniture and space
Make sure you have enough space in your home to add your aquarium with-
out having to sell any furniture. If you do find the need for more space, casu-
ally suggest to your spouse that the loveseat and couch are looking kind of
shabby and need to be replaced. While your spouse is hauling the furniture
away, set up your tank. Talk up how great the new aquarium looks and hope
your mate doesn’t have the heart to make you move it after you’ve gone
through all the trouble of setting it up.
An easier method is to just make sure that you have enough room for the
tank you buy. Measure the intended spot carefully so that you know exactly
what size tank you can purchase before you buy.
Electrical
Check for electrical outlets near the place you want to set your tank. Nothing
is more frustrating than setting up a tank only to find out that you have
nowhere to plug in your aquarium equipment. Make sure that electrical out-
lets (you will probably need more than one) are in good working condition
and are close to the tank so you don’t have extension cords lying around,
which can short out, look messy, are difficult to clean around, and can cause
people to trip. And make sure your outlets are up to code. If necessary, get a
professional electrician to install a new outlet; or use a multi-outlet strip.
Cleaning
Once in while, you have to do a little cleaning and maintenance on your
aquarium. Leave enough room around the tank so that you can easily reach
all sides of it without pushing against the tank itself. Trying to squeeze in
behind a tank that is too close to the wall is flirting with disaster.
Even aquariums with tight-fitting hoods tend to have drips and dribbles
every so often. So one way or another, you have to get behind your aquarium
at some point. Make sure when you are setting up your tank that you have
plenty of space to take care of any problems that may occur.

Chapter 4
The Tank and Stand
In This Chapter
 Choosing the right tank
 Setting up the stand
 Moving the tank
T
he two largest items that you will purchase for your aquarium system are
the tank and the stand. Many different styles, shapes, and sizes of aquari-
ums are available on today’s market. The quality of the construction of these
modern acrylic and glass tanks is much better than that of the old steel-
framed aquariums that were around when the hobby began. Even if you have
a very small space to work with, you will be able to find an aquarium that fits
perfectly.
Aquarium stands have also come a long way over the years. The old, ugly,
heavy iron stands have now been replaced with beautiful cabinets and
fancier wrought-iron varieties. Now aquarium keeping is truly an art form in
itself. With all the variety and colors of stands to choose from, you will be
able to easily find one to match your décor.
Before You Buy a Tank
The first step in setting up your new aquarium system is purchasing a tank.
But before you go out and actually buy one, take the time to look at a few of
the variables that may affect your purchase. Your aquarium has to fit into
your individual situation. You have to match your tank to its surrounding
environment and to any of your special space needs.
Stop for a moment and think about the purpose of your tank. Are you setting it
up in a common area so that everyone in your family can enjoy it? Or do you
want to have it in the privacy of your own office or bedroom? A freshwater
community tank (one with several species in it) may be more suited to family
viewing than a species tank (one devoted to one species) would be. If this were

the case, you would not want to purchase a 2-gallon tank for your living room,
because that would be too small for a thriving group of community species. A
tank of that size would not make a very good conversational piece either. For
your crowded office, maybe a portrait tank would be best Different types of
aquariums are covered later on in this chapter.
After you decide where to put the tank, take a measurement of the intended
space so you don’t end up with an aquarium blocking the refrigerator or
being used as a doorstop. Add 6 to 8 inches on to the back measurement so
that you have plenty of room for aquarium equipment such as filters, heaters,
and pumps. Add at least a foot on to the sides of larger aquariums as well so
that you will have room to move around the tank for cleaning.
Water is heavy
To determine the weight of a proposed aquarium, multiply the total number
of gallons by 10 pounds. That’s right, a 100-gallon aquarium weighs around
half a ton. Take weight into consideration when choosing your aquarium
setup. This method provides a good, rough estimate of the total weight of an
aquarium with the tank, water, rocks, equipment, and decorations all figured
in. Here are a few common aquariums and the weight you will need to take
into consideration on average:
 10-gallon tank, 100 pounds
 20-gallon tank, 200 pounds
 55-gallon tank, 550 pounds
 100-gallon tank, 1,000 pounds
 125-gallon tank, 1,250 pounds
As you can see, you really need to make sure that your floor can handle the
weight of heavier tanks. If you are unsure, call a contractor.
Watching the tendency to overspend
Before you go shopping, check to see how much money you have available,
taking into consideration that even though your aquarium is probably the
largest piece of fishkeeping equipment you’ll ever own (and the one with the
largest price tag), the cost of all the other hardware — filters, pumps, gravel,
chemicals, and heaters — adds up quickly. A larger tank is not only more
expensive to start with, it requires more equipment. You don’t want to 
30
Part I: Aquarium Basics 

purchase a 125-gallon aquarium if that leaves you five bucks to spend on
equipment. It’s better to purchase a small tank and have more than enough
money left over for substrate, plants, equipment, and other essentials.
Checking out starter kits
One easy option is to purchase a starter kit. A starter kit is a system-in-a-box
that usually contains the following:
 Tank
 Filter
 Food
 Hood
 Lights
 Heater
 Fish net
 Thermometer
 Water conditioner
 A beginning aquarium book
Not every kit contains exactly the same things, so read the label carefully. If
you purchased the kit in the previous list, all you would need to buy after-
ward is gravel and a few plants to get the tank up and running, plus a stand
(unless you’re using furniture instead). Many starter kits don’t have gravel,
decorations, plants, or stands, so they’re not really complete.
31
Chapter 4: The Tank and Stand
Don’t be nickel-and-dimed to death
If you’re not careful, you can go broke purchas-
ing “extras” for your tank. Skip the fancy deco-
rations when you first set it up and use your
money instead to purchase the aquarium you
really want and the equipment you really need to
keep it running properly. Make sure you figure in
the price of filters, lights, gravel, chemicals,
hoods, plants, air hose, nets, pH test kits, heaters,
medications, and of course, your fish — which
you will be buying later on, after the tank is set
up and ready.
Aquariums are really a good value in the long
term, and generally cost quite a bit less than
many other expensive hobbies such as skydiving
and bungee jumping. The money you invest in a
beautiful aquarium now will pay you and your
family back with years and years of pleasure.

Finding free space
Okay, you finally decided where you want to put your aquarium, but now you
want to know what size tank won’t require a two-foot shoehorn. If your home
is small, you’ll want an aquarium that you can enjoy without cramping your
living space. If you find yourself sleeping on the sofa the following week, you
probably miscalculated your free bedroom space.
To avoid space hassles and a significant other’s fury, use Table 4-1 to gauge
minimum space requirements (length by width by height) for various sizes of
several standard aquarium tanks. These are minimum requirements — the
space that extra equipment takes up and the room needed to clean around
the aquarium is not figured in.

Taking people into consideration
The people living with you are another important part of your tank place-
ment decisions. Face it, your aquarium is going to make some noise, even if it
is outfitted with the most up-to-date equipment on the market. Sure, it won’t
bark, meow, chirp, croak, hiss, or growl, but it probably will do a little bit of
bubbling, rattling, and/or humming once in a while.
If your friends or family are like ours, they will actually enjoy all the neat little
sounds that an aquarium makes. They may even find them relaxing. But other
people may think your little aquatic setup is downright annoying. We usually
get rid of the people before the tank, but if that’s not practical for you, your
placement options may be limited quite a bit.
Children are another important factor in considering the type of system you
purchase. If you have small tots in the house, a tank full of piranhas will prob-
ably go over with your spouse like a lead balloon. A community tank filled
with friendly fish such as guppies and platys may be more appropriate for
younger children.
Deciding where to buy
You have a few choices when it comes to where to purchase an aquarium:
 Your local pet shop: This is an obvious choice. The advantages of buying
from a dealer are numerous. Dealer tanks usually have a warranty of
some kind, depending on the store’s policy, and are in good condition. If
you have any problems with your aquarium, you can often return it for a
replacement or a refund. A dealer can also give you advice and help you
pick out your equipment and livestock. The drawback of purchasing from
a pet shop is that the prices are usually higher than at retail superstores.
33
Chapter 4: The Tank and Stand

 Retail superstores: These usually carry a small line of aquarium equip-
ment, but you don’t generally find a whole lot of specialty items such as
odd-sized hoods. The employees are usually trained in the basics of
aquariums at best, so you may end up with bad advice on more compli-
cated systems. Also, we find that the quality of livestock in this type of
store is not the greatest. (In fact, it’s downright scary!)
 Garage sales: This is a really fun and practical way to purchase used
equipment at rock-bottom prices. But keep in mind that the aquarium
equipment is used and may have some problems.
 Newspaper ads: These can lead you to a nice set-up at a nice price,
although reservations about buying used equipment apply. Buying
through an ad, however, may give you a chance to see the tank up and
running before you purchase it.
 Online stores: There are many good dealers on the World Wide Web that
sell standard and custom aquariums. Enter aquariums for sale into
Google’s search box to get started. Online shops are mentioned in
Chapter 2, and buying fish on the Web is talked about in Chapter 8.
Before you buy a used tank, carefully inspect it for leaks, glass cracks, and
worn silicone. Fill it up and see if it drips. Check to see that the silicone seal
(the goopy-looking stuff in the corners and seams) is not cracked, peeling
away, or missing in some areas. A small break in the silicone can cause the
aquarium to leak. Look at each individual piece of glass in the tank to ensure
that it does not have any cracks or broken glass. If the aquarium has any of
these problems, don’t buy it.
If this is your first aquarium, avoid buying used equipment such as pumps.
An old pump could have frayed or worn wires that might pose an electrical
hazard. Once you get a comfortable with how your aquarium equipment
works, then it might be okay for you to take a chance on used equipment.
Ask the person selling used equipment if you can try the stuff out. If he or she
is uncooperative, simply look at your watch with a worried expression and
then burn rubber to the nearest pet shop.
What Aquariums Are Made Of
The high-quality aquarium products now offered by manufacturers is quite
mind-boggling compared to the old glass aquariums of the ‘60s and ‘70s. The
original metal frame tanks were very heavy and not very pleasing to the eye.
Fortunately, nonmetallic materials were developed that eventually replaced
heavy-metal frames and inadequate seam adhesives. This breakthrough in
aquarium construction was a direct result of complaints filed by fishkeeping
enthusiasts who demanded better products — ones that could be used for all
types of systems.
34
Part I: Aquarium Basics 

Glass aquariums
The all-glass aquariums on today’s market are the most popular of all avail-
able tanks. These tanks are constructed of plate glass and sealed with a non-
toxic silicone. The glass in these aquariums is either tempered, meaning it’s
stronger, lighter in weight, and shatters into pieces when it breaks, or plate,
meaning it’s heavier and thicker but only cracks when it breaks.
The frames on glass tanks are usually plastic, come in a wide variety of
colors, and are glued onto the rim. Glass tanks do not scratch easily and pro-
vide a good viewing area because all of the walls are flat. 
Some plate glass tanks can be purchased pre-drilled, which means that they
have holes drilled in them for equipment and hoses, allowing you to hide
hoses and equipment inside a normal cabinet without having to route every-
thing on the outside of the tank. However, pre-drilled tanks can be quite
expensive and are intended more for experienced hobbyists. Having drilled
holes is not necessary for any aquarium setup.
One disadvantage of glass aquariums is that they can be formed into a lim-
ited number of shapes — basically, rectangles or squares. If you really want a
tank with an unusual shape, you won’t find much to please you in the glass
department.
Glass aquariums are also heavy because the glass used in construction gets
thicker as the tank gets larger. This can be a real problem if you want a big
tank and have weak floors in your home, or if you attempt to move the aquar-
ium. Glass aquariums can break or shatter and leave you with a lot of dead
fish and a huge mess to clean up. If you want to purchase a larger tank, play it
safe and have a contractor look at the floor where you want to place the tank
to see if it can hold the weight.
35
Chapter 4: The Tank and Stand
Figuring water volume without a Ph.D.
If you happen to run across an older tank at a
local garage sale or auction, the seller may not
know how many gallons the aquarium holds.
Although aquarium tank sizes today are stan-
dardized, many older tanks were not. A good
formula for obtaining an on-the-spot total for the
gallon capacity of any rectangular or square-
shaped aquarium is as follows:
Multiply the length (inches) × width (inches) ×
height (inches) and then divide by 231. The
result is the capacity of the tank in gallons.

Acrylic aquariums
Acrylic tanks have made a big splash in the aquarium marketplace in the last
few years. These lightweight tanks are available in an amazing number of
shapes and sizes such as bubble, half spheres, L-shaped, tubular, triangular,
and convex. With acrylic, the shape possibilities end only with the designer’s
creativity. There is an acrylic tank somewhere out there to please almost
anyone’s personal taste and desire.
Acrylic advantages
There are a few advantages of acrylic:
 Lighter than glass: Acrylic tanks are easier to move and produce fewer
hernias. If your aquarium is upstairs, acrylic may give you the option of
having a larger tank.
 More stylish: Many acrylic tanks come with colored backgrounds, which
can be quite stunning with the proper tank decoration. The modern look
of acrylic tanks you just cannot find in a standard glass aquarium. You
also get more choices in colors and styles to match the interior of your
home or office. An acrylic tank gives any room an upscale appearance
and generally looks more expensive than glass tanks.
 Much stronger: It takes an exceptional blow with a blunt instrument to
shatter an acrylic aquarium. 
 Cool shapes: Acrylic can be shaped into cool bubbles, tube shapes, and
other unusual but fantastic-looking aquariums.
36
Part I: Aquarium Basics 
Testing and repairing a leaker
One way to test an aquarium for leaks is to fill it
with water and let it stand on a piece of news-
paper for 24 hours. If the newspaper gets wet,
the tank leaks (make sure you aren’t fooled by
condensation drips). You should always test
new and used tanks for leaks. To repair a leak,
dry the tank, remove the old silicone with a
safety razor (please be careful!). Gently wipe
the area with a soft, clean cloth to remove any
oils from your hands to ensure a good seal.
Replace the old sealer with new aquarium
sealer. Let the sealer dry for 48 hours before you
add any water to the tank.

Acrylic disadvantages
Acrylic does have a few drawbacks:
 Distortion: Unfortunately, acrylic tanks have small amounts of visual
distortion because of the way the material is bent during construction.
They are generally made out of one large piece of acrylic that is heated
and bent to shape; this method produces a seamless look that is really
outstanding. These transparent corners allow you to view your fish from
almost any angle with ease.
 More expensive: Acrylic aquariums are a lot more expensive, if you get
into custom styles, than their glass counterparts. These babies can cost
some serious bucks, but they are well worth the investment. (Good ones
run $500 to several thousand dollars.) These tanks are top of the line as
far as quality and workmanship and beauty are concerned. If you have
the budget to afford one, you won’t be disappointed.
 Scratching: Acrylic aquariums are quite easily scratched. Be careful
when cleaning with rough algae pads, for example, to avoid leaving
scratches or smears. Moving gravel around can also damage the surface,
and pay close attention when you are moving or adding decorations to
the aquarium. There are good scratch remover kits available through
your local pet shop or the Internet that can handle most simple blem-
ishes caused by carelessness.
Plastic aquariums
Plastic tanks can usually be found collecting dust on superstore shelves.
These types of aquariums are very inexpensive. Not surprisingly, they have
more serious drawbacks than any other type of aquarium and really are not
worth purchasing. Plastic tanks are now almost obsolete (kind of like the
computer we purchased last year) and for several good reasons:
 Scratching: They scratch easily, and there is really no way to repair the
scratches.
 Discoloration: They often take on a yellowish cast as they age.
 Limited sizes: They’re available only in small sizes (usually between 2
and 5 gallons) which doesn’t provide enough water volume and surface
area to insure a biologically stable environment.
 Distortion: They suffer major distortion problems due to their odd shapes.
 Prone to melting: They can buckle when they come in contact with any
heat source, including their own hood and light! Whoever designed
these tanks needs to have his or her little (and we do mean little) gray
cells examined.

Chapter 4: The Tank and Stand

Different and Unusual Aquarium Styles
Along with different materials used for aquarium construction, there are also
many different styles of construction as well. If you don’t want a simple box-
shaped aquarium, you have other options to choose from.
Portrait aquariums
Acrylic portrait tanks are aquariums that are mounted on the wall of your
home, and do not require a stand; they mount on a wall stud just like a pic-
ture. These tanks are great if you have small children at home. You simply
hang the tank out of their reach, so they can’t pull the tank off the wall. Wall
tanks are also very handy if you do not have a lot of floor space but still want
an aquarium. These tanks are so beautiful we’d want one even if we lived in a
12,000-square-foot mansion, which we don’t.
Portrait aquariums come in a variety of sizes, often ranging from 4 to 6 feet
wide. These wall hung tanks also offer a good choice of scenic backgrounds
and frame colors. When you look at your portrait aquarium, it is kind of like
looking through a window into an underwater menagerie. 
Feeding your aquatic pets in your portrait tank is a breeze, because these
tanks have a feeding hole. Remember that these tanks have a small surface
area and are very thin, so you won’t be able to keep huge fish or large
amounts of fish in them.
In-wall tanks
These tanks are flat like portrait tanks but are actually mounted inside your
wall and are supported by wall studs (see Figure 4-1). If you want to put up
one of these models, it is best to find a contractor to install it properly. Make

Part I: Aquarium Basics 
Can I build my own tank?
Probably not. Building your own glass tank can
be very dangerous unless you really know what
you’re doing. It is not recommended for inexpe-
rienced hobbyists and craftsmen. It is really
safer to purchase a tank at a dealer rather than
risk building an inferior product the leaks water
like a sieve and turns your room into a perma-
nent water display that could put Seaworld to
shame.

sure to ask them to run the lights to a light switch in your room so that you
can simply turn them on and off with the flick of a switch. These tanks are
also used for desktop aquariums because their small width doesn’t take up a
lot of working space.
Wall tanks are not hard to clean because access is left open on one side of the
wall, or the top trim piece can be installed to flip open. Follow manufacturer’s
instructions and get a contractor if you are not familiar with carpentry. 
Furniture aquariums
If you would like to combine a piece of furniture with an aquarium, then a fur-
niture aquarium may be just what you are looking for. These tanks are built
into pieces of furniture such as coffee tables, headboards, end tables, night-
stands, lamps, and clocks. Often these dual-purpose tanks can be expensive,
but are well worth the money if you can spare it. Use caution when purchas-
ing one of these tanks if you have small toddlers in the house who can easily
break or fall onto them.
Tower aquariums
Tower aquariums are simply tanks that are built into the shape of a tall column
or tower. These tanks are great for corner spaces and add a contemporary look
Figure 4-1:
Building an

into your
wall is one
way to solve
the problem
of not

space.
39
Chapter 4: The Tank and Stand

to any room. The disadvantages to towers is that they can be expensive, and it
may be difficult to find tall enough plants to make them look realistic without
buying specially made tall plants from the manufacturer.
Indoor pond barrels
Indoor barrels can make miniature versions of outdoor coldwater ponds
inside your home or on your porch. Great care must be taken when consider-
ing the overall weight of a small indoor barrel, so once again consult with a
contractor to see if your floors can withstand the strain.
Choosing the Right Tank
There are many issues you need to address when you’re preparing to actually
purchase your aquarium. Size, water volume, and shape have a lot to do with
the type of aquatic creatures you can actually put in it. As you have already
read, there are many different tank sizes and styles to choose from. If you
start off with a tank that meets the needs of your individual project or system
(a large tank if you want a huge community of fish, for example), you have
one foot in the door of success.
Tank size
If you plan on setting up a freshwater system, you should purchase at least a
10-gallon tank to make sure your new fish have an adequate area to provide
stable water conditions. A smaller tank is harder to work with, can turn your
fish into instant sardines, and will eventually bring you disappointment and
heartache. Smaller aquariums are more prone to foul water conditions, which
can damage your fish’s health. A small tank also does not leave much room
for adding decorations or extra fish.
Always buy the largest tank that your budget and space limitations allow,
because increased surface area means better overall biological stability. A
large surface area provides good oxygen absorption and carbon dioxide
exchange.
Small tanks can be a real problem if you have a power or equipment failure. Due
to the small amount of water the tank holds, the temperature can drop very
quickly. An extended period of lost filtration (usually after several hours
depending on your aquarium size) can also foul the water to lethal proportions.
40
Part I: Aquarium Basics 

Tank shape
Although it is cool to have an oddly shaped aquarium, be aware that a few
drawbacks go along with these tanks. The shape of an aquarium helps deter-
mine the amount of oxygen its water contains.
Vital gas exchange (carbon dioxide for oxygen) occurs at the water surface. A
tall, thin tank, such as a tower aquarium, with a small water-surface area, has
less gas exchange going on than a shorter tank with a longer, and therefore
larger, surface area. 
Another factor to take into consideration is that odd-sized tanks, especially if
they are really tall and narrow, can be hard to clean or decorate without
scuba gear. There may even be areas near the bottom that are totally
unreachable. You may also find yourself having a hard time locating equip-
ment such as filters and hoods to fit a tank that isn’t a standard size if the
original part happens to break. (Even if you do find a good match, it probably
costs twice as much as the same piece does for a standard-sized tank.)
Carrying capacity
The carrying capacity is simply the total number of fish you can keep in your
aquarium safely without their going belly up. If you choose to buy a tank that
is very tall and narrow, you can’t keep as many fish in it as you can in a tank
with a larger surface area. It’s as simple as that. We’ll say it one more time: If
you get a fancy tank that has a small surface area, don’t count on having a
whole bunch of fish.
Choosing the Right Stand
Choosing a good aquarium stand can be just as important as picking the right
aquarium. A stand needs to be sturdy and strong and look cool at the same
time. The one thing that you don’t want to do is use Granny’s antique table as
an aquarium stand, because any unforeseen water leaks will quickly ruin that
heirloom. A heavy tank can warp the wood on your regular household furni-
ture, too. It is always best to use a manufactured aquarium stand built to sup-
port a tank’s weight and designed to be perfectly level.
Make sure your aquarium fits its stand correctly. If the edge of the tank hangs
over the stand, the stand is too small and eventually can cause the aquarium
to warp or break.
41
Chapter 4: The Tank and Stand

Manufactured stands are generally made out of iron, steel, or wood. All three
materials make great stands, so it is just a matter of individual preference as
to which one you decide to buy. (Okay, okay, we give you a few hints: Just
read on.)
Wooden cabinet stands
Stands that include a built-in wooden cabinet are enclosed on the bottom so
that you can hide equipment and hoses that generally spoil the overall look
of your aquarium system. Chemicals, test kits, nets, and other paraphernalia
can be conveniently stored behind closed doors 
Such a cabinet also allows you to buy a bunch of expensive aquarium junk
and hide it from your spouse. The only problem with wooden stands is that
they can warp under extreme weight (placing tanks on it that are too large
and hang over the sides), and they tend to bend if they become wet. They
tend to cost a little more than standard iron stands. Make sure that the aquar-
ium you choose matches the stand that you buy to avoid these problems.
But despite the drawbacks, wooden cabinet stands are the best stands that
you can buy because they look good, will not tip over easily, and often con-
tain shelves for storing items.
Angle and wrought iron stands
Iron stands are made of either angle iron or wrought iron. Angle iron stands
are welded together and have a bulky look to them. They would look great in
a medieval castle. Angle iron stands can also leave nasty marks on your floor
(if water gets on the metal and then sits stagnant on the floor under the
stand) or carpet (the weight of the tank pushed onto small legs instead of
spread out over the entire length of a cabinet stand, can leave indentations in
the carpet that are almost impossible to remove).
Wrought iron stands are made of thinner metal than angle iron and are a little
bit fancier.
Do-it-yourself stands
There are a few stands that you can purchase and build yourself, assembling
them easily with a few household tools. The pieces are usually made of press-
board and include at least one shelf. These stands are not as strong as manu-
factured ones and may warp or buckle if they get wet. 
42
Part I: Aquarium Basics 

One option is to head down to the hardware store, buy some good hardwood
lumber such as oak, and build an aquarium stand yourself. You may find out
that a homemade stand costs as much as or more than a manufactured one.
But if you have the know-how, an interesting idea, cool tools, and the energy
to turn off the TV and head out to the garage, go for it. Make sure the stand
you make is firm enough to support the weight of the tank. You can test the
stand by adding books or other heavy materials to it. Add enough books to
equal the total weight of the aquarium that will be sitting on it (see earlier in
this chapter for aquarium weight estimation).
Material-based stands
Material based stands are made of any man-made material that is not metal
or hardwood. Examples include fiberboard and acrylic stands.
Mixed-media stands
Mixed media stands are made for those people who want to combine an
aquarium system with storage shelving. These stands usually have an area
for the tank and extra shelves for displaying your CD player, books, and so
forth.
Bow-front stands
A bow-front stand has a semi-circular shape in the front to properly support
bow-front shaped tanks (tanks that are convex in the front). We personally
love the shape of these stands, but it all comes down to personal choice.
Placing the Stand Correctly
As we mentioned, the first step in setting up your aquarium system is finding
a permanent place to put it. Set the stand in an area away from drafts and
direct sunlight to keep the water in your tank from overheating or chilling.
Don’t put your tank in a garage or basement unless the room is insulated or
heated. Placement near doors, windows, and other drafty areas where the
temperature can change unexpectedly is a no-no.
43
Chapter 4: The Tank and Stand

Checking floors and walls
Make sure the stand is on a solid surface. Check the floor carefully so that
your new aquarium doesn’t end up decorating the downstairs neighbor’s
apartment. Remember that a 100-gallon tank weighs somewhere in the neigh-
borhood of 1,000 pounds fully loaded! 
Do not place the stand directly against a wall. You need room back there for
hanging equipment.
Looking for power
When determining where you want to place your aquarium, keep in mind that
your system requires a few electrical outlets in order to run. A friend of ours
once set up a complete aquarium system — water and all — and then real-
ized that there was no electrical outlet anywhere near the tank! (He was a
couple sandwiches short of a mental picnic anyway.)
Use an electrical outlet that is not connected to a wall switch. You don’t want
anyone to hit the switch and unknowingly shut off your aquarium equipment.
Moving an Aquarium
Never try to move an aquarium all by yourself, no matter how small it is. Any
aquarium should always be lifted by a minimum of two people. You can cause
yourself physical injury, and damage the silicone and frame of the tank if you
attempt to haul your tank around by yourself.
(A good way to get help moving an aquarium is to put on a dirty apron, throw
some flour on yourself, call your couch potato neighbors, and tell them you
want them to try out an exciting new recipe. When they arrive, tell them that
your aquarium is blocking the way to the food supply. Works every time.)
When you’re ready to move your tank, make sure to unplug all equipment
and then remove it from the aquarium. Don’t remove the heater until 15 min-
utes have passed to avoid shattering it. Fill a plastic bucket with water from
the aquarium and place the fish in the bucket. Drain the rest of the water.
Before you lift the aquarium, remove any large rocks or other heavy decora-
tions, which can shift positions and break the glass.
Never lift your tank by grabbing the top of the frame. Lifting an aquarium by
its top frame can damage and break the sealer or glass, eventually causing
water leaks. The proper way to lift an aquarium is to place your hands (and
your hungry neighbors’ hands) beneath the bottom corners of the tank.

What to Put and What Not to Put
in Your Tank
In This Chapter
 Discovering what aquascaping is all about
 Understanding substrates
 Working with rocks and wood
 Adding the oddities
A
quascaping is a fancy word that means decorating your aquarium with
different types of rock, wood, plants, and substrate. Arranging the
gravel, sand, and other aquarium floor coverings can be a lot of fun and gives
you a good chance to show off your personal creative talents. We can think of
no greater joy than creating a pleasing arrangement of rocks, plants, and sub-
strate (material that covers the bottom on your tank) for our fish to enjoy.
Your fish will appreciate a proper setup as well.
Designing the inside of your tank can be one of the most enjoyable aspects of
the aquarium hobby. Imagine beautiful plants swaying gently in the water as
colorful fish dash playfully between shimmering rocks and uniquely shaped
pieces of wood. What an exciting sight! Your aquarium is your own little per-
sonal aquatic world that is just waiting to be shaped into an amazing underwa-
ter scene by your creativity.
But although aquascaping can be a real blast, certain types of substrates,
rocks, and wood are suitable only for specific aquarium setups. You need to
know what to buy before you begin randomly throwing things into your
aquarium. This chapter can help you make good choices that will keep your
fish happy and healthy. 

46
Part I: Aquarium Basics 
Many hobbyists choose to set up heavily planted tanks with few fish. Others
prefer a simplistic layout with many aquatic species. The choice is yours, of
course. If you use your imagination and follow the few simple aquascaping
rules that we present in this chapter, you’ll quickly realize that the possibilities
are endless.
Just remember that you want to create an environment that is good for your
fish and pleasing to the eye as well.
Taking Clues from Your Fish’s 
Natural Environment
The first thing to do when aquascaping any aquarium is to take a close look
at the native environment of the fish you’re planning to keep in your tank. For
example, freshwater fish are much happier in an aquarium full of plants, drift-
wood, and rock than they are in one with coral and shells — which you gen-
erally use in a marine setup. Different types of systems have different
aquascaping elements.
We find that it often helps to sit down and draw out a plan on paper before
adding any substrate or decorations to a tank. That way you get a better
overall feel for the layout you want. You don’t have to draw anything really
fancy, just plot out a simple schematic for where you want to place every-
thing and adjust it as you go along. Save your final schematic in case you ever
have to completely break down the tank for moving or other reasons. 
Take the overall size of your tank and fish into consideration when making
your plan. You want a layout that is filled with life but not overcrowded. Fish
need open spaces as well as hidden areas so that they can feel secure and
have a place to exercise.
The following list gives you a few good ideas about which substrates and dec-
orations are most often used in different types of systems:
 Freshwater tank: Pebbles, igneous and shale rocks, live plants, artificial
plants, driftwood, with sand and standard fish shop gravel for substrate.
 Brackish water tank: Pebbles, shale, stratified rocks, plants, driftwood,
pea gravel, and small amounts of coral sand for substrate.
 Marine tank: Live rock (rock that has invertebrates attached), tufa rock,
and dolomite with coral sand and live sand (pre-cultured sand that con-
tains biological organisms for filtration) for substrate. Select algae, such
as grape plant, for decoration. Invertebrates such as anemones and
tubeworms are common in many marine tanks.

All About Substrates
Substrates come in many different shapes and sizes to suit the needs of each
type of aquarium. You can find substrates in grades from fine to coarse and in
different shapes such as smooth or chipped. The actual size of substrates can
often vary from vendor to vendor, so for the sake of this chapter, we’ll say that a
fine gravel is small like sand, a medium gravel is what is found in most prepack-
aged bags at retail stores, and a coarse gravel is similar in size to a dime.
The substrate you put into your aquarium plays a very important role in its
overall biological cycle. In time, beneficial bacteria start growing on top of
and throughout the substrate bed and help break down waste in the aquar-
ium water. Substrate is also quite useful for anchoring live plants and for
holding down various types of artificial plants, live plants, and decorations.
Choosing the proper substrate gives you a good start on maintaining a
healthy aquatic system for your fish. So you’re probably wondering how to
find your way though this substrate mess. Well, read on.
Gravel
Manufactured gravel is usually the best bet for a freshwater or brackish tank.
It is easily cleaned and widely available in pet stores and super centers by
the bag or the pound. Gravel also comes in many different colors and levels
of shininess. As you will learn, some gravels are better choices than others.
Most manufactured gravel is lime-free (so it doesn’t change the water chem-
istry by raising the pH and hardening the aquarium water) and very inexpen-
sive, which makes it one of the most popular substrates. 
Of course, gravel is a completely inanimate substance and does not provide
any type of nutrition for living aquarium plants. So, if you decide to use live
plants in your freshwater or brackish setup, you have to supply extra nutri-
tion for them by using plant plugs or liquid food. (Say what? Chapter 16
explains all that, we promise.)
Substrates and pH
Putting the right substrate in an aquarium setup is just as important as pro-
viding the correct water conditions. One important point to remember is that
some substrates can affect the pH of your aquarium water, so make sure to
buy the correct type for the species that you own (check with your local
dealer on what substrate works best for the fish and plants you are going to
choose). Many live plants also have requirements in gravel size, so check
with your dealer to find out what is right for the species you plan on putting
in your tank. You will also find helpful setups at the end of this chapter.

Part I: Aquarium Basics 
For example, marine dolomite raises the pH of aquarium water to an alkaline
level, and therefore is unsuitable for most freshwater tanks that contain fish
who prefer more neutral pH levels. If you put dolomite in your freshwater
tank, your fish will do the backstroke permanently. Standard aquarium gravel
doesn’t affect the water’s pH, and therefore isn’t suitable for a marine setup
which requires a consistently higher pH level. 
If you’re not sure how much calcareous material (such as snail shells and
seashells) a substrate contains, perform this simple test: Add a few table-
spoons of vinegar to the test pile of substrate and if it has calcareous (that is,
containing calcium) material, it will fizz. If it fizzes, don’t put it in your fresh-
water tank, or you will end up with hard alkaline water.
Crushed coral (pieces of dead coral gathered from coral beaches) and shells
raise your water’s pH values as dolomite does and should not be used in a
freshwater setup (with exceptions like African cichlids who like the higher pH
and hardness produced by coral). 
Substrates to avoid
Get all substrate materials from a reputable fish dealer so that you know that
it’s pure.
No matter which substrate you choose for your aquarium, make sure that it’s
safe for all the fish in your tank. Sharp edges on gravel can damage your fish’s
body. Jagged surfaces can be especially injurious to bottom-dwelling species
that continually dig in the substrate. If your bottom dwellers look like dart-
boards, check your substrate carefully and remove any pieces that look like
they have sharp edges.
Never use marbles
Several types of familiar items sometimes found in a beginner’s freshwater
aquarium are not really suitable for a fish’s natural environment. Never use
marbles, glass flakes, or other such materials to cover the bottom of any aquar-
ium. Marbles are quite large and allow debris to become trapped between their
surfaces, which can eventually lead to water fouling and diseased fish.
Stay away from disco gravel
Brightly colored or neon gravels take away from the natural beauty of your fish
and should be avoided if it all possible. Neon gravel tends to make your fish
look like they’re in a made-for-TV movie about a bad night on a disco floor.
Neon gravel also tends to reflect a lot of unnecessary light upward into the
water, which can be an annoyance to your fish and cause their colors to look
washed out.

Keep an aquarium’s colors simple and natural looking for the best results. You
can get away with a few cool plastic decorations such as treasure chests and
scuba divers, but shocking-pink gravel is too much of an eyestrain for both
you and your fish (if you wake up one morning to find your fish sporting sun-
glasses, you know you need to tone down your gravel). Neon gravels may also
keep your fish from spawning and make them shy away and hide in corners.
Gravel size and the perils of sand
Choose the size of your gravel carefully to avoid water fouling. Avoid the
larger-shaped materials because they allow food and waste to fall between
the pieces, where they can cause serious water problems in a short time
because they are hard to vacuum out and reduce water flow. If you use an
undergravel filter (you can read all about them in Chapter 6), choose a
medium-size substrate (the size of regular bagged aquarium gravels) so that
the plastic plates don’t get clogged with gravel that is too fine. If using sand, a
hang-on-tank powerfilter would be a better choice.
Gravel with a particle size of 1⁄8 inch works best for most setups.
Larger granules also have a cumulatively smaller surface area because of
their shape, and don’t allow space for the growth of the proper bacteria for
biological filtration. Let us put it this way — if you think you can break a
window at 10 feet with a piece of your aquarium gravel, then it is too large for
your tank, and might be better used to pave your driveway.
Small-grained substrates such as sand quickly clog the water flow in your
aquarium if they slip down into the undergravel filter plate and can subse-
quently cause a rise in waste. So if you decide to use sand in your aquarium,
lay it down in a very thin layer or have a mesh plate beneath it to stop it from
falling through into the filter.
If you can’t find the right size of substrate at your local pet store, either order
some on the Internet or wait until it becomes available from your dealer. A
little bit of patience can definitely save you many headaches in the future.

Part I: Aquarium Basics 
Adding substrate to your system
Before adding gravel to a freshwater system, clean it thoroughly by rinsing it
under fresh water. As you clean, carefully check for and remove defects such
as extremely large clumps, foreign matter, and sharp pieces in the gravel.
The amount of substrate required for a freshwater tank varies not only with
the size of the aquarium, but with the type of filtration used as well:
 If you have an undergravel filter, you need a 2- to 3-inch layer of sub-
strate in order to create a proper bacterial bed.
 If you’re not using an undergravel filter, use only an inch of substrate to
cover the bottom of the tank.
 If you plan on using live plants, you may need to add a bit more sub-
strate to make sure that the plants stay anchored and do not float up to
the top of the tank.
On average, a standard, rectangular aquarium needs about a pound and a half
of substrate per gallon of water. It should be obvious that this rule doesn’t
work for a tank two inches wide and eighteen feet tall. You’d end up with a
column of gravel that would look great as a pillar on your front porch. Use
common sense when adding gravel depending on your tank’s shape.
Slope the gravel by making it slightly higher in the back, so that debris will
tumble down and collect toward the front glass. This makes it easier to
vacuum up and keep clean. A few well placed rocks or plants will help to keep
the slope from flattening out as it slowly slides forward.
Rocks, Wood, and Artificial Plants
Using rocks, wood, and artificial plants is a great way to add a natural-looking
environment to your aquarium. Normal, everyday rocks that come from a
quarry are generally used for freshwater setups. Rocks and hardwoods also
provide hiding and spawning areas for your fish, and artificial plastic or silk
plants can easily be found at most retail pet stores to add that realistic touch
to your aquarium
Rocks for freshwater tanks
Rocks can help break up the total bottom space into individual territories.
Establishing territories often prevents fighting among fish. Squabbles often
break out during spawning or feeding times. Some individual fish may also be
more aggressive than others, so it never hurts to have a few rocks in your
aquarium that can provide shelter if needed.

You can purchase several varieties of rocks including granite at your local
aquarium store that are safe to put into any tank. These rocks are pre-cleaned
and won’t crumble. You can also pick up a little slate while you’re at the
store. Rocks such as slate, granite, and red lava rock will not change the
water conditions in your aquarium and promote a pleasing and natural
layout. Another good place to find natural, worn rocks is along riverbanks
and streams. Make sure you thoroughly clean any rocks you find with hot
water and allow them to dry in the sun before using them.
When adding rocks to your tank, make sure that you try to distribute them
throughout the substrate. While adding rock is rarely a problem, your glass
can become stressed and prone to cracks if you pile a very heavy load of
rocks on one side of the tank. Natural riverbeds have small rocks strewn
around the bottom and small clusters of larger rocks on the sides.
Wood for a freshwater tank
Wood is a wonderful way to add a natural look to your home aquarium. Most
retail fish stores sell driftwood, branches, and small hollow logs. These may
be real wood that has been sealed or artificial pieces that usually look as
good as the real thing. In today’s market the choices seem almost endless.
Keeping wood from floating
If you have not bought a pre-sealed piece of wood from a retail store and
have found some nice-looking driftwood, you may run into a floating prob-
lem. Nothing is more aggravating or unsightly than a big chunk of wood float-
ing all over your aquarium. Plus, floating chunks of wood may cause aquarium
and equipment damage, and put dents in your fish, and they will hate you for
it. This can be fixed in some cases, so don’t toss that beautiful piece out
simply because it is bobbing to the top of the water.
If your driftwood tends to float, pre-soak it in water until it’s saturated.
Saturated wood usually stays down on the bottom of the tank. If wood still
floats after being submerged for a 24 hours, you can try attaching it to a rock.
You can use plastic suction cups to attach driftwood to a rock in your aquar-
ium. Simply add the cups to the wood using aquarium-safe silicone. Anchoring
wood keeps it from floating or being knocked around by the fish in your tank.
You can buy suction cups at most hardware and aquarium stores.
Once you have the wood attached to a rock (slate often works best for this)
in the substrate to anchor the wood arrangement in place. Use gnarled
branches whenever possible, because they look cool and provide nifty little
mazes for your fish to swim around in.
If all else fails, remove the wood and look for another good piece that is less
buoyant.
51
Chapter 5: What to Put and What Not to Put in Your Tank

Don’t lean rocks against the back glass of the aquarium, as this can cause
“dead areas” on the rear surface. These tightly enclosed areas do not allow
for proper water circulation in the tank and will contribute to uneven heating
and water fouling.
Buying wood
Although driftwood is very beautiful and helps create interesting scenes in
your aquarium, it can be very expensive if you buy the stuff from the retail
store. There are always other options such as finding your own wood as pre-
viously mentioned.
We’ve found that woodworker’s shops often carry small pieces of driftwood
at much more reasonable prices. Other good places to check for driftwood
are second-hand shops and yard sales. Often people have a piece that they
picked up while on vacation sitting around for years just taking up space and
then decide to sell it for cheap once they tire of storing it.
Safely sealing wood
Because several types of wood (bogwood, for example) contain tannins which
produce acidic conditions, not all woods are suitable for every type of
system. Bogwood (which produces a golden-colored water) lends itself best
to systems that contain species that prefer soft conditions that are slightly
acidic (tetras.)
If you’re not sure how a particular piece or type of wood will affect your
aquarium conditions, the safest thing to do is to seal it with polyurethane
varnish. Use at least three coats of this sealer, allowing each coat to dry
before applying the next. The varnish keeps wood from releasing any prod-
ucts that can affect your water conditions. You can seal an interesting piece
of wood from the wild with polyurethane varnish as well.
Plastic plants
The appearance and variety of artificial aquarium plants have really
improved in the last ten years. You can easily find plastic plants in all differ-
ent colors and sizes to suit your aquarium size and layout. If you don’t want
to crowd the appearance of your tank, buy small plants for the front of the
tank and larger plants for the back.
52
Part I: Aquarium Basics 

Many artificial plants are now manufactured with attachments such as caves
and rocks. These types of decorations may incorporate hanging gardens, sub-
strate caves, and interesting bundles that are bound together in large groups.
Most of the time, these combo decorations do not cost much more than
single plastic plants.
There are many advantages to artificial plants: 
 Easy to clean: If you have algae problems or water that is accidentally
fouled, plastic plants can be cleaned simply by running warm water over
them and then gently wiping them with a moist cloth. That little sprayer
attachment on your sink works wonders for this job as well.
 Easy to care for: Many people don’t have a lot of extra time to spend
trying to keep live plants in good condition, so plastic plants are a great
substitution for those who are constantly on the go. Artificial plants do
not require sunlight, so if you have a busy schedule you don’t have to
worry about the amount of light they receive. This is especially helpful if
you don’t have timer-based lighting that turns your lights on and off
automatically at pre-set intervals.
 Live forever: Artificial plants do not die or affect the chemistry of your
tank. Dead plants can make a mess quickly, so plastic plants are a saving
grace to many. Young children often benefit from use of plastic plants in
that they can devote their time to learning how to care for their fish first.
All artificial plants tend to show wear in time, but most will last years.
 Won’t be eaten: Plastic plants cannot be easily eaten or torn by more
aggressive species of fish. Nothing is more heartbreaking that to have
your beautifully planted tank destroyed by your beloved aquatic pets. If
you have species that are natural nibblers or havoc seekers, consider
artificial plants so that you don’t have to purchase new live ones on a
regular basis, which can quickly get expensive.
 Easy to move: Artificial plants can be easily moved around when it
comes time to clean or redecorate your tank. Just gently remove them
from the substrate by the base and don’t worry about tearing the leaves
or damaging the plants. Most artificial plants have a hard plastic base
that aids in keeping them under the gravel.
 Wide variety: There are more choices of colors and sizes if you use artifi-
cial plants because not all fish stores carry live plants on a regular basis.
There are also a few disadvantages to artificial plants:
 Can look fake: If you buy poor quality plants, they can look fake and
ruin the look of your tank. Always buy the best quality plants that your
budget will allow.
53
Chapter 5: What to Put and What Not to Put in Your Tank

 Expensive: Artificial decorations can cost more than the real thing.
 Fish may not like them: Many species that like to nibble on plants will
not like your artificial ones.
As you can see, it’s up to you to decide what is best for your particular
lifestyle, budget, and aquatic species. Plan before you buy.
Other Aquarium Decorations 
Okay, we have to admit that we have been tempted once or twice to take a
few frog statues, oversized rocks, and other decorations out of our yard and
put them in an aquarium. But this isn’t really a good practice.
Unsafe decorations can cause problems
Stuff from your yard often contains all sorts of parasites and other nasty things
that can cause disease in your tank and foul the water. And it may not be safe
to use non-aquarium rocks, wood, plastic sunflowers for standard aquarium
use because many contain harmful dyes and paints or fall apart once they sit in
water. Despite the fact that the small rotting wagon wheel would make a great
centerpiece in your 250-gallon cichlid tank, it’s not worth the trouble.
Your best bet for safe decorations is to purchase pieces from a reputable
aquarium dealer or other retail store. We can’t emphasize this important
point enough. Unsafe decorations can kill your fish, ruin your aquarium con-
ditions, and cost you a lot of money and heartache.
Statuettes and toys that you find around the house may contain internal
parts made of metal, which can cause destruction in a tank. Dyes and other
surface materials can produce ill affects on freshwater fish and other species.
Plastic divers and other oddities
Plastic divers (Figure 5-1), dead pirates, bobbing turtles, treasure chests,
mermaids, sunken ships that bubble, castles, nasty looking skeletons, and
mutant oysters may be fine and dandy in the safety department, but you
need to exercise a little control when buying these items or your aquarium
may end up looking like a scene from Toy Story.
54
Part I: Aquarium Basics 

Manufactured decorations sold in aquarium shops are quite safe for freshwa-
ter tanks, but they tend to become a little unsightly if you cram your tank
with lots of them, and will turn your naturally behaving fish into Toys “R” Us
kids in a heartbeat.
There is nothing wrong with incorporating one or two of these pieces into a
tank if you surround them with plants or small rocks to make them blend into
the scene. Just use a little common sense and don’t overdo it.
Artificial items like plastic scuba divers do not help much when you are
trying to get your fish into the spawning mood, either. Be honest, would you
feel romantic with a larger-than-life man with a knife standing over your
favorite make-out spot? We didn’t think so. If you really want to see a ton of
these toys floating, diving, and bobbing up and down, set up a small aquar-
ium just for decorations and leave the fish out of it.

Aquascaping Tips and Tricks
As you decorate more and more tanks, you will eventually learn to see what
looks good and what doesn’t. Practice makes perfect as they say.
Aquascaping can turn a bare tank into a real showpiece. Aquascaping will
provide a feeling of safety for your aquatic friends, help to cover up bare
spots and equipment, and will enrich the overall look of your aquarium.
Creating a beautiful tank will also help to educate family and visitors on
species and their natural environments, and provide your fish with a natural
looking habitat that they will flourish in.
Here are some tips that will help you understand the basics of good 
aquascaping:
 Keep it clean. Keep your water and aquarium glass clean so that your
aquascape will really shine. Nothing ruins a good scene quicker than
dirty water and particles floating all over the place.
 Don’t make everything symmetrical. If you looked at the natural envi-
ronment of your fish, you would not find stones set exactly 2 inches
apart, or a lake with only one type of plant grouped in bunches of three
for miles. 
 Make rocks look natural. Pile a few small stones together and then put
one off to the side as if it had tumbled down from the pile over time. Use
stones that are similar in the extent that they have been worn over time
by water movement. For example, avoid putting one craggy looking rock
in the middle of a bunch of smooth stones.
 Pay close attention to color. Not all rocks in nature are the same color,
because they have been bleached out by water and sunlight. Add a few
odd-colored stones to enhance the appearance of a grouping.
 Plan, plan, plan. If needed, sketch out your overall layout before you
begin setting it up as mentioned previously, so that you have a good idea
where everything will look.
 Add the water first. Don’t aquascape a tank without water, because
once it is added, plants will spread out and look different. Try filling the
tank halfway to aid in determining how something will really look.
 Research. Check library books for pictures of your species’ geographi-
cal environment to give you ideas on how a setup can be aquascaped to
look natural.

 Have a focal point. Try to have at least one main point of interest in
your aquascape such as an unusual, beautifully shaped rock or a stun-
ning plant. Group other objects around to highlight the point of interest
and guide your eye toward it naturally. Take advantage of a point of
interest by using it to tell illustrate a natural area. For example, a hol-
lowed out log can make a great point of interest for natural breeding if it
is surrounded by broad-leafed plants that shelter it.
 Think natural. Try to use wood and stones from the same region for
aquascaping. Don’t mix apples and oranges. Keep it natural instead.
 Think outside the box. Why not use aquarium-safe silicone to add small
stones to the back wall of the tank in the shape of a rock hill? (Make sure
the rocks are close together to avoid dead spots in water flow.) Let your
imagination run wild. Try turning your true creative talents into a reality
by experimenting with different techniques.
 Avoid crowding. Don’t cram your tank with so much aquascaping that
food will become trapped and foul the tank. Leave enough space to
vacuum the tank as needed. Keep in mind that your plants will need to
grow as well. Leave enough room for them to flourish naturally.
 Suit aquascaping to species. Some species such as many cichlids can
quickly tear up and destroy a beautifully aquascaped tank. Make sure
the plants and rocks you choose match the personality of your fish. For
example, large fish such as pacus do not seem to like large plastic
objects such as divers and will pull them up. Goldfish may eat live
plants. Plecos will dig up plants that are not buried deep in gravel. 
57
Chapter 5: What to Put and What Not to Put in Your Tank
The natural tank
When aquascaping, keep your fish’s natural
habitat in mind. A natural tank shows the beauty
of your fish in a better light and allows them the
freedom to act more naturally. Many native dec-
orations such as plants, rocks, and wood have
a lot to do with the successful spawning of
many freshwater species.
By providing natural conditions in your aquarium,
you can enjoy the environmental interactions
that make aquarium keeping so fascinating. For
example, a guppy weaving its way in and out of
dense plant leaves is much more exciting to
watch than an oscar trying to make lunch out of
a plastic diver’s helmet.
Providing a balanced aquatic system for your
fish shows your children basic biological princi-
pals that they can apply to other scientific areas
in the future. The delicate balance between plant
and animal life in a freshwater tank is easily illus-
trated in an aquarium ecosystem.

n the wild, a fish’s environment functions without equipment for one basic
reason: Mother Nature takes care of everything. You know the old saying:
Don’t upset Mother Nature. Well, unfortunately we have done just that by
placing our wet pets in a small, enclosed aquarium environment. That’s why
at home we need to replace the natural systems that we have taken away by
placing fish in captivity. Now that you have your aquarium tank and stand,
you need some equipment to keep it running smoothly. An aquarium’s equip-
ment is the lifeblood of the whole system.
In nature, ocean, river, and pond waters are heated and regulated by the sun
and seasons. In your home aquarium, you duplicate these effects by using a
heater, thermometer, and artificial lighting.
In the wild, currents remove fish waste and rain replenishes the water.
Natural bacteria help eliminate waste, plant debris, and other undesirable
materials. At home, you accomplish these necessary tasks with filters, water
changes, and other specialty equipment.
As you will see, aquarium equipment is vital to the health of your fish. It also
helps keep your water crystal clear so that you can enjoy the view.

Part I: Aquarium Basics 
Taking the Mystery out of Filters
Filters play an essential role in performing mechanical, biological, and chemi-
cal functions in your aquarium. Some filters cover only one function; others
may do two or three.
The three main functions of a filtration system are to
 Promote the nitrogen cycle (which removes unwanted ammonia and
nitrites from your system) by providing a medium for bacteria growth
 Remove debris and waste from the water
 Aerate the aquarium’s water by producing water flow and bubbles. By
adding these bubbles, oxygen goes into your tank, and eventually CO2 is
removed at the surface through gas exchange.
When you check out the astounding number of filters at a pet shop, you’ll
probably want to reach for the aspirin by the time you get to the second or
third shelf. But don’t worry, filters really aren’t as complicated as they may
first seem.
There are three types of aquarium filtration, and whatever system you decide
on needs to incorporate all three of them:
 Mechanical
 Biological
 Chemical
You accomplish this balance by combining different filters, or by using one
that performs all three kinds of filtration.
Mechanical filtration
Mechanical filtration removes solid wastes and debris suspended in the
water by passing it over materials, such as synthetic foam or nylon fiber
floss, which captures small particles. Basically you are removing dirt and
other bad floating materials from the tank with mechanical filtration.
In time, this same filter can perform biological filtration when the surface
area of the filter medium (the foam or floss) becomes covered with beneficial
bacteria. The medium is usually contained in a small cartridge that slips
inside of a power filter unit, or is added in bulk form from a bag or box, as
with a corner filter.

Popular mechanical filter types include
 Canisters
 Power filters
 Corner filters
Mechanical filters come in many different sizes to accommodate the many
different tank sizes. When you go shopping for filters, we suggest purchasing
Penguin, Ehime, or Whisper products, because in our opinion they are the
cream of the crop.
A good filter cycles your tank’s water volume at least eight times per hour.
Mechanical filters are rated on the number of gallons of water that flow
through them every hour. If you look carefully at a filter box, you can usually
find a GPH (gallons per hour) rating. Manufacturers generally indicate on the
label which size tank the filter is designed for. 
If you have a tank larger than 10 gallons, you may want to have more than
one filter running even if your filter covers all of the requirements for taking
care of your water. You could for example have two power filters, or a canis-
ter filter and a power filter. There is nothing wrong with mixing two different
types of filtration system, or having multiples of one type. As a general rule,
we always have at least two filtration systems on each of our tanks just in
case one fails.
Biological filtration
The main purpose of biological filtration is to provide a home for the bacteria
that changes ammonia into nitrates and then nitrates. The function of nitrify-
ing bacteria is to convert deadly ammonia (produced by fish waste) and food
debris into less harmful nitrites, and then into even less harmful nitrates
which can be removed with water changes. This amazing biological purifica-
tion process is also known as detoxification or the nitrogen cycle. Chapter 14
talks a lot more about it.
The bacteria are everywhere naturally (air and water) in small amounts. By
adding fish and food, the bacteria have the nutrition required to establish a
larger colony. The filter medium provides the perfect “nesting” place for them
to multiply.
Large filters don’t necessarily mean better biological filtration. What counts
is the amount of surface area on the medium. The larger the total surface
area of the medium, the more bacteria your system and fish have to use in
the fight for good water quality.
61
Chapter 6: Equipment and Other Technical Stuff

Filters that have alternative media, so that you can replace one part without
losing it all, are better than the completely disposable type where you lose
the whole bacteria colony when you throw the only source of filter medium
away.
The filter box or instructions indicate which parts of the filter you need to
replace and when to replace them. For example, a power filter with bio-wheels
(see the section “Power filters,” later in this chapter for more on bio-wheels)
would be better than a power filter that only has compact floss and carbon
pads that have to be replaced when the pad becomes clogged or the charcoal
is no longer active. The reason for this is that the bio wheels will retain benefi-
cial bacteria even though you are replacing the pads.
Chemical filtration
Chemical filtration takes place through mediums such as activated zeolite and
activated charcoal, which absorb chemicals and dissolved minerals as water
passes over them. Proper chemical filtration helps keep your aquarium water
clean and sparkling.
You generally find activated charcoal in corner, undergravel, replaceable
uplift tube heads — and power filters. Replace the filter medium according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. You should replace the medium once a
month in most cases.
Sifting Through Filtration Systems
Once you understand the importance of filtration systems and what they do,
you need to know what types of filters are out there and how they work. The
many types of filters on the market fall into several categories as far as func-
tion and purpose are concerned. Technology is advancing rapidly, and a few
new systems combine the best aspects of several different filters.
Undergravel filters
An undergravel filter is one of the best systems for almost any type of aquar-
ium setup and has been around for a long time. We recommend starting with
an undergravel filter and building up from there. You can combine a good
mechanical/chemical filter combo (such as a power filter) with an undergravel
unit and have a complete setup. You can use an undergravel filter with any
type of system, and it’s an excellent tool for creating good biological filtration. 
62
Part I: Aquarium Basics 

Undergravel filters have one or more perforated plastic base plates that sit
on the bottom of the aquarium with a gap between the bottom of the plate
and the bottom of the tank. The base plates have holes for the insertion of
plastic uplift tubes (which allow air to flow up from beneath the filter plate)
containing an airstone which connects to an air pump.
Airstones come in many shapes including globe, circular, and rectangular. An
airstone can be made out of many different materials including porous wood,
fused glass, plastic, and refined ceramic. An air-line tube attached to a pump
forces air into the stone which releases it in the form of unified bubbles for
greater aeration.
An undergravel filter pulls water down through the gravel and the slots in the
plates and returns it to the tank via the airlift (uplift) tubes. During this
process ammonia is broken down as the water passes over a colony of benefi-
cial bacteria living on the substrate’s surface and in the space beneath the
plates. Debris is trapped along the substrate bed, making it easy to vacuum
away. Periodic vacuuming is a must with this type of system to keep the bed
from becoming clogged. (If you don’t vacuum, eventually your substrate bed
looks as if a mudslide hit it.)
Undergravel filters are one of the oldest systems around; many hobbyists do
not use them much anymore. We still believe they are a good building block for
aquarium filtration. Many pre-packaged kits come with undergravel filters
included. As long as you have it as part of the package, you might as well use it. 
Undergravel filters are great for systems that do not have big rocks or deco-
rations to block large sections of the gravel bed. Blocked plates create dead
spots on the filter. A regular, store-packaged gravel substrate is best for this
system — because smaller substrates will fall through, and larger ones can
hide big chunks of debris (your lost golf balls, your child’s hidden leftovers).
Set the undergravel filter in place before adding the substrate (usually
gravel).
Sponge filters
A sponge filter provides biological filtration. This type of filter is simple in
design and, when attached to an air pump, draws aquarium water though a
large sponge that acts as a medium for bacteria to gather on. Sponge filters
are good to use in quarantine and hospital tanks because they have no chem-
ical filtration that can ruin the effectiveness of medications you may be using. 
Sponge filters are also useful in fry tanks and aquariums with small fish
because they eliminate the danger of youngsters getting sucked up into
standard filtration units. However, sponge filters only take care of biological
63
Chapter 6: Equipment and Other Technical Stuff

filtration and are inadequate for use in large tanks. One other problem with a
sponge filter is that it makes your aquarium look kind of like the junk shelf
underneath your kitchen sink, because it takes up room inside of the aquarium.
One good use for sponge filters is to quickly build up a biological bacteria
medium for new aquariums.
Corner filters (submersible filters)
Corner filters function primarily as mechanical filters but also provide biolog-
ical and chemical filtration. This is one of the oldest filtration systems known
to the aquarium hobby. Corner filters were originally designed for the small
aquariums that were the staple of aquarium-keeping years and years ago.
Generally, the original clear plastic filter was shaped like a small square box
and contained an airstone that pushed water through a layer of charcoal and
floss with the help of an air pump. 
Fortunately, corner filters have really come a long way in the last decade. The
newer corner filters are much quieter; many come with swiveling spouts to
change flow direction and water flow adjusters to change the power of the
water flow. You can also find corner filters that have a clogging indicator that
will show you when the filter media needs to be maintained. 
The old corner filters rested on the gravel bed inside the tank (if you could
manage to keep it from floating all over creation and back by weighting it
down with small pebbles or gravel). There are corner filters today that can
hang vertically and horizontally on the glass walls. The downside is that they
still take up room in the tank and can only be hidden using strategic place-
ment of plants and other aquarium decorations.
Power filters
Power filters are cool because you can use them for mechanical, chemical,
and biological filtration. A power filter runs on electricity (with an internal
motor so a pump isn’t needed) and usually hangs on the outside of the aquar-
ium. Power filters are box-shaped and come in a variety of sizes to meet the
needs of different-sized tanks (see Figure 6-1). These units usually have one
or two slots on the inside of the unit that hold removable fiber-coated filter
pads. The inside of these pads usually contain charcoal.
64
Part I: Aquarium Basics 

A power filter hangs on the back of an aquarium and sucks up tank water
through an intake tube, which hangs inside the aquarium. The water passes
over the filter pads and filter media (which house biological colonies that
provide biological filtration) and then returns to the water surface. The char-
coal in the pads work as chemical filters, and the fibers pick up debris before
it clogs the media.
Clean the pads on these filters by rinsing them with dechlorinated water and
replace them every month so that you have fresh charcoal. Unfortunately,
replacing the pads destroys the biological colony, but there is enough
remaining in the aquarium and other parts of the filter to repopulate quickly.
Some power filters contain bio-wheels, which rotate so that they come into
contact with both the water and beneficial oxygen in the air, and never really
need to be replaced unless they break. This wheel keeps the bacteria colony
alive even if you change the internal pad. Bio-wheels combos are the best
type of power filters to buy.
You can use power filters in any type of system.
Powerheads
A powerhead is a cool piece of equipment that isn’t really classified as a filter,
but it can help increase an undergravel filter’s output and efficiency by drawing
water up through the tubes at a faster rate than most air pumps with attached
airstones can. A powerhead is nothing more than an electric motor-driven
Figure 6-1:

65
Chapter 6: Equipment and Other Technical Stuff

pump sealed in hard plastic which you can insert into the top of the uplift
tubes of an undergravel filter system. You can also hang them on the tank (or
buy a fully submersible model) to provide good circulation in your aquarium.
Some models come with internal filter pads as well.
The really neat thing about powerheads is that they have adjustable valves to
regulate the speed of the airflow (thus increasing or decreasing the speed and
force of the water flow). This little valve is convenient (not to mention fun to
play with) in smaller tanks when you want to cut down the flow to keep the
tank’s inhabitants from being blown all over the aquarium or permanently
embedded in the glass walls. Powerheads also have a rotating outflow that you
can turn to direct the water flow to a specific area in your aquarium. (Or turn
the outflow straight up and have your whole family shower at the same time.)
Canister filters
A canister filter provides biological, chemical, and mechanical filtration. This
type of unit is very popular with hobbyists and is often used in larger aquar-
ium systems because they do such a wonderful job of keeping water in good
condition. A canister filter contains several media compartments (baskets)
that usually contain sponges/foam blocks, carbon (charcoal), and some type
of ceramic medium. The aquarium water is drawn through the filter via hoses
attached to a high-pressure pump.
Canister filters are capable of turning over several hundred gallons of aquar-
ium water per hour and have an internal motor to accomplish this task. Most
canister filters sit on the floor beneath the aquarium, but some models attach
to the back of the aquarium glass (“hang on tank,” also know as H.O.T.). You
can adjust the filter’s output to any part of the tank that meets your personal
desires. A canister filter can be very large, bulky, and unsightly, so make sure
you have a place to hide it in the aquarium cabinet or behind the stand so
that your house doesn’t look like a water-processing plant. 
Fluidized bed filters
A fluidized bed filter is one of the best biological filters on the market. The
only drawback is that they can be very expensive and require a pre-filter to
remove particles. But if you happen to make a few extra bucks selling some
fry, it’s well worth the investment to purchase one of these units.
Fluidized bed filters are extremely compact and use sand as a filter medium.
The sand is continuously kept wet by water flowing through it and has a huge
surface area where a large colony of nitrogen cycle beneficial bacteria can
grow and multiply, as mentioned earlier in this chapter. This type of filter
improves oxygenation because the sand is constantly tumbled in a stream of
66
Part I: Aquarium Basics 

water that creates what is known as a fluidized bed. Sand grains move with
the water flow to create a high-quality transfer between the water and the
bacteria present.
Another important feature of fluidized bed filters is that they respond quickly
to any rise in the aquarium water’s ammonia levels.
A fluidized bed filter really only covers biological filtration, so if you use one
you must also have mechanical and chemical filters working in conjunction
with it in order to balance your overall cleaning system.
Fluidized bed filters are great for planted tanks because they do not remove
as much CO2 (carbon dioxide) from tanks as many other filters do.
Diatom filters
This type of filter uses diatomaceous earth to filter aquarium water to a very
clean and “polished” state. It can capture even the smallest of dirt particles.
Due to the super clean water this equipment produces, it will help to lower
diseases such as fin rot, velvet, ich, and other problems caused by micro-
organisms. This type of filter can be hung on the tank or placed on the floor.
The only drawback to diatom filters is that they are expensive compared to
many other filters made for the same size aquarium. But if you can afford
them, they are well worth the money.
Wet/dry filters
As the name suggests, wet/dry filters use a mixture of water and air to clean
the water. In the first step, waste is removed from the water after it is passed
through an initial filter. On the second step, a filtering chamber aerates the
water and passes it through another filter. 
67
Chapter 6: Equipment and Other Technical Stuff
Pond filters
Most pond filters are just glorified canister filters
in box form. Some pond filters are even disguised
as flowerpots. Some models go directly in the
pond, whereas others rest on dry land. These fil-
ters turn over massive amounts of water, which
is essential for a healthy, well-planned pond
system. The only problem with a pond filter is that
you have to have a pond to put it in. (Putting a
good pond in your backyard will probably be on
the same wish list as the swimming pool you
always wanted.) You can, however, buy a small
pond kit that fits into a barrel, which can be
placed in your home or on a porch.

A wet/dry filter requires more maintenance, because the media must be
replaced to avoid build up of wastes, and it has a higher rate of evaporation.
This filter is mainly for biological and mechanical filtration, so you will need
an additional type or combination filter to take care of the chemical filtration
in your aquarium.
Natural filtration with plants
Long before artificial filters appeared on the market, as mentioned at the
beginning of this chapter, nature had its own special way of taking care of
everyday cleaning. That way is called plants. Plants act as natural filters and
complement the manufactured units in your home aquarium.
Freshwater plants help biological and chemical filtration in the home aquar-
ium. These aquatic marvels remove ammonia, nitrates, and carbon dioxide
from the water with relative ease. In aquatic systems, plants take in inorganic
molecules and carbon dioxide from the aquarium water and return oxygen
and organic molecules for your fish’s benefit as long as the plants have
enough light to carry out the process of photosynthesis during daylight hours.
Gauging Heaters and Thermometers
If you plan to set up any type of tropical freshwater system, you need to have
at least one heater.
The three main types of heaters you can purchase at a fish shop are
 Submersible heaters
 Non-submersible heaters
 Undergravel heating cable
68
Part I: Aquarium Basics 
Reducing the noise
All aquarium equipment will make a bit of noise
now and then. Thankfully, today’s aquarium
equipment is much quieter than the stuff from
the early days of the fishkeeping hobby. 
If your filter equipment is making too much noise,
you may need to replace it or have the motor (if
it has one) fixed by a professional at an aquarium
store. Save the directions that come with the
filter, because many models have parts that you
yourself can easily replace by following the man-
ufacturer’s instructions.

Submersible heaters
As their name suggests, you completely submerse these in the aquarium
water. Ideally, you should place them in a diagonal line across the rear piece
of glass, so that heat flows evenly throughout the tank.
A submersible heater has a watertight glass tube containing an electrical ele-
ment wound around a ceramic core. A small red or orange light lets you know
whether the heater is on or off. At the top of the heater is a temperature adjust-
ment valve you use to raise or lower the heat. Submersible heaters usually
have an internal thermometer that you can see through the glass tube. You
simply rotate the adjustment valve so that the temperature line moves to the
temperature you want to set for your species Other models have temperature
lines (similar to markings on a measuring cup but in degrees) built in with the
control knob. The heater automatically maintains the temperature you choose.
Make absolutely sure that the heater is a submersible model before you put it
completely underwater!
Non-submersible heaters
Non-submersible heaters hang on the outside aquarium frame, with the glass
tube hanging in the water. The adjustment valve sits above the water line.
This type of heater generally does not have an internal thermometer. You
make adjustments in small increments by turning the valve and repeatedly
checking the temperature. This is the older style of heater.
How to heat your aquarium
The safest arrangement is to keep two heaters operating at the same time
just in case one unit happens to fail. If one does fail, disaster can be adverted
by the second heater, which can keep the water temperature from dropping
while you replace the failed unit.
The rule for determining which size heater your aquarium needs is to allow 5
watts of heater per gallon. For example, a 50-gallon aquarium needs at least a
250-watt heater.
Never remove a heater from the aquarium without letting the whole system
sit for at least 20 minutes after unplugging the heater! Likewise, never turn a
heater on for the first time in an aquarium until after you let it sit in the water
for at least 20 minutes!
69
Chapter 6: Equipment and Other Technical Stuff

If your heater does not have a built-in thermometer, you can purchase one
separately. Extreme fluctuations in water temperature can cause disease or
death, so it is important to closely monitor the thermometer readings. You
can find a ton of good information on what temperature is correct for many
species in Chapter 8. Thermometers are very inexpensive and come in sev-
eral varieties:
 Hanging thermometers hang from the aquarium on the inside of the
aquarium glass. This style of thermometer is composed of a capillary
tube containing mercury that moves up and to display the temperature. 
 Stick-on thermometers are flat and adhere to the outside of the aquar-
ium glass. Degree panels light up as the temperature changes, displaying
the current water temperature. The two disadvantages of stick-on ther-
mometers are that they’re permanent (can’t be moved from place to
place) and they can be hard to read in rooms with low lighting.
 Floating thermometers slowly cruise around the aquarium and display
the current temperature with a mercury line like home thermometers
that hang on the wall. (Unless you are used to watching tennis, you may
get whiplash trying to read one of these.)
 Digital thermometers run on batteries and measure the water tempera-
ture with a probe that can be attached inside the tank with a suction
cup. Many models also display the room temperature.
 Wireless thermometers use a radio wave signal to send the water tem-
perature from a remote sensor to a unit with a digital readout. Some
models allow you to have several sensors sending information to one
display unit.
Making Bubbles with Airstones 
and Pumps
One of the big advantages of having an aquarium is that it makes a bunch of
cool sounds. Air bubbles produce a great tone and can be very soothing.
After you get your filter system all figured out, it’s time to have a little fun and
create a few cheerful bubbles.
You can do this in a couple of cool ways:
 Air pumps (used to run some filters and decorations) usually have some
kind of bubble or current outflow that is fun to watch.
 Airstones can create mega-bubbles, which will impress your friends and
neighbors.
70
Part I: Aquarium Basics 

Air pumps
An air pump is kind of a jack-of-all-trades. They can power filters, airstones,
and several types of plastic decorations. Air pumps are available in both
vibrator and piston models. When added to an undergravel filter, a pump
drives air though the airstone in the uplift tubes via tubing. The air is then
broken up into small bubbles as it passes through an airstone and up the
tube. See Figure 6-2 for a typical air pump.
An air pump should always sit above the midpoint level of the aquarium to
avoid water backflow (which can ruin your pump) if electrical power is lost.
For example, if your aquarium is 12 inches tall, the pump should sit higher
than 6 inches measured from the bottom of the tank. 
However the easy solution to this problem is to buy a checkvalve. The check-
valve is a small plastic cylindrical object that allows water or air to flow in
only one direction, so that any backflow of water will not damage your pump.
The check valve is added to the air-line tubing.
Air pumps come in a variety of different sizes to suit almost any filter. (All filters
are driven either by an air pump or an electric motor.)

71
Chapter 6: Equipment and Other Technical Stuff

There are two main types of air pump:
 Vibrator pumps are great for the home aquarium because they are not
as expensive as piston pumps, and don’t require a whole lot of mechani-
cal maintenance. Vibrator pumps do have one big drawback: They can
be very noisy, especially if you purchase a poor-quality model.
 Piston pumps are much more powerful than vibrator pumps and are
often used on very large or multiple systems. The disadvantage to
piston pumps is that they are hard to find, need to be oiled, and require
traps to keep oil from getting into the aquarium system.
Airstones and circulation
An airstone is a neat little tube-shaped artificial stone used to split the air
supplied by the pump into small bubbles. These bubbles help increase water
oxygenation. Airstones are generally made of ceramic or perforated wood-
based materials. Airstones can be short and round or tall and thin. The tall
stones tend to emit a finer stream of bubbles than the shorter ones do.
Airstones are very inexpensive, and should be replaced when they become
clogged.
You attach airstones to one side of standard air-line tubing, and attach the
other end of the tubing to the air pump. You can use airstones in undergravel
filter tubes, and corner filters or just put them in the tank.
To create a big bubble stream in your aquarium, you can purchase a bubble
disk. A bubble disk is a large airstone that looks like a plastic flying disc. You
simply connect the disk to an air pump with tubing and then slip it into the
tank. The disk makes a large stream of bubbles, which can aid in water circu-
lation. Bubble disks may become clogged with algae (usually this takes quite
some time), but you can clean them by rinsing them gently under clear water.
Fish love swimming in and out of the bubbles.
Try to stay away from bubble wands. These delicate little stones are shaped
like rods and usually have suction cups attached to the back of them so that
they can be mounted on glass. The problem with bubble wands is that they
can become clogged and stop functioning quite quickly. Bubble wands break
easily, so you may end up trashing half the decorations in your tank trying to
remove one for cleaning.
72
Part I: Aquarium Basics 

Connecting Tubing, Valves, and Tees
Air-line tubing functions like the veins and arteries in the human body.
Without your veins and arteries, your internal organs would just kind of lie
there, lifeless, because they have nothing connecting them — nothing keep-
ing the lifeblood flowing. So it is with air-line tubing and your aquarium
equipment; therefore, a supply of good air-line tubing is an absolute must.
We need to mention some of the other important elements of your aquarium
system. At first, you may think that some of this equipment is unnecessary, but
everything has its place. Even if you don’t use everything, some of these extra
gadgets are nice to have lying around just in case of an emergency. Besides, the
more fish junk you have, the better you look in the eyes of other hobbyists.
Air-line tubing
Air-line tubing connects equipment such as corner filters, airstones, decora-
tions such as divers and moving ships, and bubble disks to an air pump.
Tubing is really a necessity — not an option. Even if you have nothing in your
aquarium that runs off of tubing connected to air pumps, it is always a good
thing to have on hand.
Older tubing (the standard clear stuff you purchase at your local pet store) is
semi-rigid. Standard tubing has a few drawbacks: It tends to crack as it ages,
turns yellow, and bends out of shape (even when it is still new, right out of
the package) when you set it over equipment connections. Because it is rigid,
older tubing also tends to pinch and kink easily, which can diminish or com-
pletely cut off the airflow to your equipment. Working with old air-line tubing
can be as frustrating as untangling a cheap garden hose.
Fortunately, a new rubber type of tubing manufactured from a silicone/rubber-
based material provides greater flexibility and is much easier to work with.
Rubber tubing is blue-green in color and blends in nicely with the natural tint
of the aquarium water. Rubber tubing is easy to bend, simple to maneuver
around decorations, and does not crack easily when it begins to age.
You can purchase tubing in different lengths. The diameter of most tubing is
standard; however, you can purchase mini tubing with connectors (that will
connect mini tubing to standard tubing) because a few aquarium decorations
have very small connections in the back that are too small for standard tubing. 
73
Chapter 6: Equipment and Other Technical Stuff

You can also buy air-line suction cups which attach to the inside of the aquar-
ium glass. You simply push your air-line tubing into the plastic clip on the
suction cup and it will keep your tubing in place so it doesn’t float in the tank.
Gang valves and tees
Valves and tees help you split the air from an air pump in several directions.
You use gang valves to run several pieces of equipment or decorations off of
one air pump. A valve usually hangs on the back of the tank, and is made out
of plastic or brass. The air-line tubing from the pump hooks into one side,
and the tubing directed toward decorations and equipment is connected to
one of the multiple outlets on the valve. You can adjust the strength of the
airflow coming out of the valve for each piece of equipment simply by turning
the individual shut-off nozzles.
Tees are usually made of plastic or copper, and are shaped like the letter T. A
tee splits a single air source in two opposite directions.
Creating the Best Lighting
Unless you can see in the dark like the movie version of Catwoman, you need
a little bit of lighting for your aquarium. Your fish probably were not born in a
black hole either, and will be much happier if you provide them with a little
daylight. Without light, your fish can’t see their food or each other and may
miss the mark by a fraction of an inch when they spawn.
Live plants in an aquarium require light in order to photosynthesize, manu-
facture their own food, and expel oxygen beneficial to your fish. 
Some hoods (a top that fits over the upper edge of the tank) have a built-in
light (full hoods); others don’t. If you purchase a unit that has a light built in
to it, you can change the bulb when it burns out or put in a bulb that better
suits your needs. Check the manufacturers’ instructions so that you don’t
end up with a meltdown due to excessive heat build-up. Also make sure that
the hood fits the tank correctly to prevent water loss from evaporation and
the escape of any high-jumping fish.
If your light is not connected to the hood, such as a strip light, and sits on top
of a glass cover (called a canopy), you can experiment a little bit by moving
the light around to see which position illuminates the tank best. The main
advantage of strip lights is that they provide you with the freedom to add
more lighting later on; full hoods do not.
74
Part I: Aquarium Basics 

Make sure the lighting system is unplugged when you put it on top of your
tank. Do not plug the unit in until you’re sure it’s stable! You (and your fish)
can be electrocuted if lighting falls into your tank.
Looking at bulb types
You have several bulb options to consider:
 Tungsten (incandescent) lighting is used in household lamps. Tungsten
lighting is not good for aquariums because it is too hot, burns out
quickly, produces excess algae, has a limited spectrum, doesn’t show
your fish’s colors very well, and distributes light unevenly. You may see
colored tungsten lights in your pet store, but avoid them. You will often
find these in all sorts of 1960s disco colors including red, blue, and
green. 
 Actinic blue bulbs produce long-wave ultraviolet radiation. This type of
lighting is great for plant growth but also produces an abundance of
algae if you have it on a lot. It is used often in marine tanks.
 Metal halide lights produce a very pleasing effect in your aquarium
because they have a high red and yellow spectrum and are very bright.
Unfortunately, they are very expensive. These are great for heavily
planted freshwater tanks because they are made to produce properties
similar to natural sunlight.
 High-powered mercury vapor lights can hang over aquariums and are
often used to light very deep tanks. Mercury vapor lights are a little
short in the green and blue wavelength department and may need sup-
plemental lighting to complete a full spectrum. The cool thing about
mercury vapor lights is that they usually retain 90 percent of their origi-
nal capacity over a period of several years.
 Fluorescent lighting is great for aquariums with live plants. They last a
long time, do not emit excessive heat, and have an even spectrum of
light. There’s a fluorescent light to match almost any system you plan to
set up. Even though they continue to burn, fluorescent lights often begin
to dim and lose a portion of their power after about six or seven months.
This type of bulb brings out the natural colors of your fish and plants.
Whichever lighting you choose, make sure to purchase it from a pet store.
Even though a hardware store can sell you a replacement bulb that fits your
hood, these bulbs were not intended for that purpose and will not provide
good lighting.
75
Chapter 6: Equipment and Other Technical Stuff

Making a hood choice
The best hood/lighting system for you depends a lot on your personal taste.
Some hobbyists swear by one certain type of lighting and hood combo, and
others swear by another. Here are a few types of lighting systems you can
choose from:
Eclipse
The Eclipse hood made by Marineland (www.marineland.com) is probably
the coolest setup ever invented. (In fact, everything this company makes
rocks.) This system is a hood that contains lighting and filtration. Using the
Eclipse leaves lots of space on the back of the aquarium, so you can move it
closer to the wall as well. You can also put the tank in the middle of the room
and give a good 360-degree view as well.
The downside is that you have to remove the hood to gain access to the tank,
and don’t forget to keep dreaming if you want one to fit a very large aquarium. 
Standard full hoods
This is a regular hood that covers the top of your aquarium and has one or
more lights in it. There are usually a few small slots you can remove from the
back of the hood to allow you to hang things on the tank.
Strip lights
Strip lights can be used to add extra lighting to a tank or to replace hoods.
You can buy them to fit across the top of your tank. This is basically the light
fixture unit without the rest of the hood.
76
Part I: Aquarium Basics 
Lighting extras
A power center enables you to regulate the
lighting schedule on your aquarium. You can set
the time you want your lights to come on and off
and forget about having to remember to do that
as you are rushing off to work.
End caps fit over the prong end of your fluores-
cent aquarium light tube like a sock. They are
made of rubber and will protect your lights from
getting rusty or damp in the connection area.
Ballast kits allow you to plug lights into sockets
that you can clamp onto your reflector using
lamp clips.
Sleeves are colored materials that slip over your
aquarium bulbs to give a different color effect
(such as orange, green, purple, red, or blue) to
your water.

Fan-cooled hoods
Fan-cooled hoods have built in fans to make sure that you have optimal tem-
perature in your tank while providing proper lighting. The fans help to
increase the longevity of the lights as well.
Hanging lighting
You can purchase lights that hang above the tank, which provides one of the
best lighting schemes available. These lights are usually halide, and are sus-
pended by wires that are usually included with the lights.
Reflective lighting
You can experiment with hanging lights to achieve reflected lighting (lighting
that is bounced off another surface such as a wall or ceiling).
The sky is the limit, so have fun creating new lighting schemes. Make sure
that whatever you do is safe, secure, and provides your fish and plants with
the light they really need.

Hot rodding your aquarium
Hey, we’re fish nerds, and naturally we have a
few toys. Car nerds get expensive hubcaps and
awesome paint jobs, so we get our own little
wish lists, too. In fact we wish we had more of
the equipment on the following list.
Ultraviolet (UV) sterilizers kill parasites and bac-
teria in your aquarium water. These units con-
tain an ultraviolet lamp, which you need to
change two or three times per year. The UV unit
sterilizes non-beneficial bacteria and parasites
(that are harmful to your fish) so that they
cannot reproduce.
They can be expensive, like more than $100.
Beware: Looking at an UV light can damage
your eyes! Be careful when installing this unit!
Pump timers allow you to hook up several
aquarium pumps to the device so that you can
control the output of each to create the type of
low wave patterns you want.
Carbon block CO2 units/fermentation units
release CO2 into your live plant aquarium with-
out using chambers or any type of bottle gas.
You can set the unit to release the amount you
want. You can also purchase units that use
sealed fermentation canisters to create CO2.
These units have a buffer that protects them
from extreme temperature changes that can
effect the production rate.

Short on cash?
Okay, if you’re like us and never have any
money, you can still set up a halfway decent
aquarium system. Probably the least expensive
way to get a small system going is to go to a
superstore and buy a freshwater aquarium kit.
Make sure to check the contents on the box to
insure that you have a heater, thermometer, air-
line tubing, a filter, light, hood, and pump. Grab
a few bags of gravel, a bottle of dechlorinator,
fish food, a net, and a few plants on the way out
the door, and you’re ready to go.

Part II: Fish and How to Care for Them 
What Really Makes a Fish Go?
At one time or another, everyone has stood transfixed, watching aquarium
fish glide effortlessly through the water and wondering how they navigate
through their liquid environment with such ease. What makes a fish swim
better than we do? The answer is really quite simple.
Fish have a set of fins (six or seven of them, depending on the species) that
they use for locomotion. They also have a cool organ called a swim bladder
that helps them stay afloat (otherwise they would sink; see the section “The
swim bladder” near the end of this chapter for more). Fish have evolved to
conquer their watery environment with adaptations that have created the
perfect aquatic swimming machine. By contrast, even using rubber fins,
humans can achieve only a pale imitation of their aquatic friends.
To understand what makes a fish go, you must first understand each fin’s func-
tion. Each individual fin has a specific job to do, and the combined effort of all
of a fish’s fins is what propels her through the water and helps her navigate
smoothly. Fin functions are an interaction of muscle power and sheer grace.
The dorsal fin
The dorsal fin is located along the back of the fish between the tail fin and the
head. This is the classic fin you see slicing through the water in the movie
Jaws. If you happen to see a Jaws-type fin while swimming in the ocean, you
may want to take up beach volleyball for a while. Fortunately for your peace
of mind, the dorsal fins on your aquarium fish generally remain underwater.
The dorsal fin provides lateral stability so that your fish can swim in a
straight line. Controlled swimming conserves energy. A fish that cannot swim
well doesn’t live very long because it can’t compete for food with its tank-
mates. Each fin consists of a series of individual rays (fin segments, some soft
and some hard) loosely bound together by a membrane web. 
A few aquatic pets, such as some goldfish and knifefish, do not have dorsal
fins. They have great difficulty swimming normally because they cannot keep
their movement in a straight line. Other species such as rainbowfish have
two dorsal fins.

The caudal fin
The caudal fin (tail fin) is responsible for sudden forward movement (bursts
of speed) and very fast swimming patterns. Fish also use their caudal fin to
slow forward movement and to help make turns. This fin produces the major-
ity of a fish’s physical power.
Lengthening the caudal fin of many species (such as the goldfish and betta)
for show purposes through artificial selection (breeding for a specific trait)
produces a slower-moving fish. Fish with very long caudal fins probably
would not survive long in the wild. A 3-inch goldfish with a 6-inch caudal fin
dragging the gravel like the train on a wedding dress is bound to have a few
swimming problems.
Sadly, many species of fish have been selectively bred to have caudal fins
that are so long or unusually shaped, the fish struggle just to stay upright in
the water. Fish that have truncated (Chinese fan-shaped) fins can dash
quickly even though they normally swim slow and easily. Fast-swimming fish
generally have forked fins; rounded fins are found in slower-moving species.
The anal fin
The anal fin is located on the underside of a fish between the pelvic and
caudal fins. The sole purpose of this fin is to provide stability — it keeps your
fish from rolling over in the water and going belly up. In some species, the
anal fin has developed into a double set of fins that are fused together at the
base of the fish’s body.
In species such as the freshwater guppy, the male’s anal fin acts as a sexual
organ and is known as a gonopodium. This rod-shaped organ inserts sperm
into the female’s vent (female organ) during spawning. Many species of
Characins, such as tetras, have small hooks on their anal fins that attach
them to their mate during breeding.
The pectoral fins
Pectoral fins provide stability as a fish moves through the water, hovers, and
makes slow turns. These paired fins are located near the bottom of the fish,
directly beneath the gill openings (one on each side). Pectoral fins are used
for navigation and are constantly in motion.
83
Chapter 7: Fish Anatomy

Many species use the pectoral fins to incubate their eggs with water during
the brooding period. Many flying fish have adapted their pectoral fins into
wings so that they can take short flights through the air. Some species of cat-
fish can “lock” their pectoral fins into a rigid stance when defending them-
selves from predators.
The pelvic fins
Pelvic fins aid fish in braking, stabilizing their bodies, and changing direc-
tions. These fins are located in front of the anal fin on the abdomen of the fish
(one on each side). Other uses of the pelvic fins include searching for food,
carrying eggs, and fighting. These fins are usually smaller in open water
species like the freshwater platy, and larger in some bottom-dwellers.
These fins are often called ventral fins because of their position on the body
near the small body-cavity opening on the bottom of the fish.
The adipose fin
A few species of fish such as tetras and some catfish have an extra fin called
the adipose fin, located on the back between the dorsal and tailfins.
Hobbyists often refer to it as the second dorsal fin. Scientists have not found
any physical reason for this fin to exist. At this point, it has no known use.
But it looks cool, so why not?
Swimming movement
The special body shape of fish helps increase the overall efficiency of their
swimming movement. A fish’s body is usually tapered at the head and tail
and bulky in the middle (like many of us when we hit midlife). This tapering
allows fish to slip through the water without much effort. So, maybe if we can
find a way to live in our bathtub, we’ll have it made.
Looking carefully at your fish, you may notice that most of them swim with
little or no effort, which is surprising because water is much more resistant
than air. But water’s liquid form supports a body’s weight as the body moves.
Because your fish’s weight is suspended in water, she needs only a small
amount of energy to overcome the force of gravity — as opposed to the effort
we humans must put out as we move through atmospheric air on dry land.
84
Part II: Fish and How to Care for Them 

A fish’s muscle force is achieved though energy created by short fibers that
run throughout the fish’s entire body. These numerous fibers move in
sequence and create physical energy in a series of s-shaped curves. This
energy is then transferred to the tail to provide locomotion. Finally, the
caudal (tail) fin pushes all the water surrounding it backwards, which in turn
propels the fish’s body in a quick forward motion. This sequence of events
allows the fish to move through the water without creating any turbulence —
which would slow it down.
Respiration
Just like humans, fish require oxygen for survival. Fish use oxygen that they
strip from the water and produce carbon dioxide as a waste product. Any
living plants in your aquarium use this carbon dioxide, and eventually expel
oxygen back into the water.
The gill method
Unlike land animals, fish don’t get their oxygen from air. Instead, fish take
their oxygen directly from the water through their gills. Gills are lined with a
large number of blood vessels that help retrieve oxygen.
Gills are very similar in structure and form to human lungs, except that they
are a whole lot more efficient: Although fish remove up to 85 percent of the
oxygen from their aquarium water, humans obtain only about 25 percent of
the oxygen in the air they breathe by comparison, so water quality is impor-
tant! (Of course, if you live in a crowded city, your oxygen consumption may
drop to about 2 percent.)
Water enters a fish’s mouth and passes across the gills where the oxygen is
extracted by the gill filaments. The oxygen-depleted water is then quickly 
discarded.
Fish with high energy levels who are very active, like the freshwater danio,
must constantly keep swimming in order to force water through their gills
and obtain oxygen. Species of fish with high energy levels would eventually
suffer asphyxiation if kept in a small aquarium that restricted their swimming
movement. You don’t want to live in a sealed elevator with 20 other people.
Neither do your fish.
85
Chapter 7: Fish Anatomy

Make sure that your tank is large enough to provide ample swimming room
for your aquatic friends.
When moving fish from one location to another, you must remember that gills
are made out of fine tissue that can collapse if removed from water. The gills
are structurally supported by the weight of the water itself. So it is very
important that you keep your fish in water while moving them, to avoid caus-
ing any damage to their gills, bodies, and fins which can be crushed by lack
of water support. 
The labyrinth organ method
A certain group of fishes (known as the Anabantids), found in Asia and Africa,
are able to breathe air directly from the atmosphere, using a specialized
organ called the labyrinth. The labyrinth, located inside the head behind the
gills, has evolved over time to take oxygen directly from the air as a supple-
ment to extracting it from the water.
Anabantids include bettas, gouramis, and paradise fish. In the wild, many of
these fish live in dirty, poorly oxygenated waters full of strange-looking crea-
tures. (Not unlike a good day at our public pool.) These fish tend to have
wide bodies and enlarged fins.
The physical shape of the labyrinth organ gives rise to its name, which liter-
ally means “maze.” The labyrinth contains rosette-shaped plates that have
thousands of oxygen-absorbing blood vessels, which gather air that is
inhaled. The inhaled air is then trapped inside a group of folds (which resem-
bles a sponge) and is eventually absorbed into the main bloodstream.
Anabantids can survive in a smaller aquarium space than that which is nor-
mally provided (usually 10 or more gallons) because they can extract oxygen
from the air. However, this does not mean that anabantids can or should be
kept in very crowded conditions or extremely tiny tanks. Even though they
have the ability to breathe “extra” air, these fishes still add as much waste to
the water as their tankmates and need proper space and filtration for healthy
living.
You will often see betta fish for sale in small jars. The reason many dealers do
this is to keep the males separated so that they don’t fight. This is not a good
practice for the home aquartist to pick up and use. Don’t keep labyrinth fish
in small bowls or hanging vases for decoration purposes. Give them a good
healthy aquarium environment with plenty of room instead.
86
Part II: Fish and How to Care for Them 

Anabantids can develop diseases brought on by crowded tanks with bad
water conditions, just like other species. Take our word for it, they’ll be
healthier and happier in a proper aquarium. (Anabantids should be provided
with the same high quality filtration, heating, and other proper conditions as
is standard with other tropical fish.) They will like you a lot better too.
The Senses
Like humans, fishes have five senses: taste, sight, hearing, touch, and smell.
Fish use all these senses to locate food, communicate with one another,
attract mates, and avoid bigger and meaner fish. Fish have been known to
learn to do without one or more of their senses when they’re injured or born
with a physical defect. We’ve seen fish in the worst possible physical condi-
tion continue to survive. Think how great they can look and feel if we keep
them in the best possible condition!
Sight
Here are some fun facts about fish eyes:
 Most fish have the ability to see in two directions at the same time. This
physical phenomenon is known as monocular vision.
 Fish can’t completely focus both their eyes on a single object at the
same time.
 Fish do not have eyelids and sleep with their eyes wide open, resting in
a hypnotic state.
 Most fish are nearsighted and see clearly only about a foot away. So, if
you stand across the room, smiling and wildly waving both your hands
to entertain your fish, don’t hold your breath waiting for them to
respond.
The lateral line system
Fish have an interesting system known as the lateral line, which helps them
locate objects in their path and in their surrounding environment that they
cannot see normally due to their limited eyesight (see Figure 7-2). This line is
incomplete in some species. The blindcave fish use this system to navigate,
and killfish use it to help locate insects above the surface of the water.
87
Chapter 7: Fish Anatomy

The lateral line is located on both sides of their body and runs from the back
of the eye to the base of the tail fin. These lines are composed of small neuro-
masts (receptors) which contain cilia (very fine hairs) in fluid-filled canals.
These canals detect vibrations in the water, and the vibrations form an
“image” inside the fish’s brain.
The eyes
A fish’s eyes are often large to compensate for the poor lighting conditions
that exist under water. Usually the eyes are located on the sides of the head,
and some species can rotate them 360 degrees. In certain species that live in
areas of total or semi-darkness (such as the blindcave fish), the eyes are
absent altogether. Over time, the eyes have been selectively removed
through the evolutionary process.
Some fish do have the ability to see a few colors at various depths, but they
have great difficulty adjusting to rapid light changes because their iris works
slowly. For this reason, fish act “shocked” and may panic when an aquarium
light is suddenly turned on or off without warning in a room that is still dark.
So if you turn on your aquarium light right after you get up in the morning
and then notice that your fish are stuck to the ceiling, you probably fright-
ened them a little bit.

88
Part II: Fish and How to Care for Them 

Within the human eye, the shape of the lens is constantly changing in an
effort to achieve proper focus. The lens in a fish’s eye remains the same
shape, but focuses with help from special ocular ligaments that actually
move the eye forward and backward in its socket.
Hearing
Fish do not have complex ears like we do because sound travels in water
much faster than in air, so by evolution standards this was not needed. Fish
ears are composed of a simple inner chamber. Vibrations picked up from the
environment are passed over sensory components, which generate sound.
Most ichthyologists (fish experts) believe that a fish’s swim bladder works
together with the components of the inner ear to distinguish specific sound
patterns.
Smell
Smell plays an important role in detecting food and prey, and in locating a
suitable mate. Fish take in smells through their nostrils, which are connected
to their olfactory system. This olfactory system is not completely joined with
the respiratory system and acts as a separate unit. 
Taste
Fish have taste buds on their mouths, lips, and, in special cases, on their fins.
The complete range of taste for fish is very short, so they must constantly
forage through their environment in hopes that they can “stumble across” the
food they need to survive. Catfish have evolved barbels (whiskerlike append-
ages) that contain taste buds for locating food in cloudy or dark water.
Feeling
The old argument as to whether fish can feel pain or not has been at issue for
many years. We would really hate to find out that our fish could feel pain if
we did something that caused them harm. The safest bet is to assume always
that your fish can feel pain and treat them with respect and great care just
like you would any other pet.
89
Chapter 7: Fish Anatomy

Osmosis and the salt to water ratio
Osmosis is a simple process by which a fish maintains the correct salt to
water ratio in its body (see Figure 7-3). Through osmosis, water molecules
constantly pass through semipermeable membranes in the fish to equalize
the amount of salt to water throughout her body. Osmosis is one of the main
reasons freshwater fish cannot live in saltwater and vice versa. (As with
every other rule, there are a few exceptions to this one.)
Fish that don’t drink water
The salt concentration in the body fluids of freshwater fish is higher than the
salt content of the water in which they live. For this reason, water is always
being drawn into their cells by osmosis. If fish did not have a means of get-
ting rid of this excess water baggage, they would burst like a balloon that has
been filled to a point where it has exceeded its air capacity, or resemble the
human body after Thanksgiving dinner.
Water is removed by the kidneys in the form of very dilute urine in freshwater
species. Specialized salt absorbing cells located in the gills move salt from
the water into the blood. Very small amounts of salt that are present in com-
mercial fish foods also help aquatic species remain in balance. The amount of
salt passed into a fish’s body is so small that it does not require much energy
to get rid of it.

Part II: Fish and How to Care for Them 

Fish that need to drink water
Just in case you decide to keep marine fish after you have become aquainted
with freshwater fishkeeping, you should know that they have the opposite
problem when it comes to balancing water and salt in their body’s cells.
Saltwater fish have a lower salt content in their bodies and must constantly
drink water to replace that lost by osmosis to the saltier environment around
them. If saltwater fish didn’t constantly drink water, they would eventually
die from dehydration.
Saltwater fish excrete small amounts of urine. They also rid their bodies of
excess salt to maintain their overall osmotic balance.
The difference is this: Freshwater fish have high salt content in their bodies.
Water is gained constantly because it comes into their bodies. Excess water
is removed through urine to retain salt/water balance. Saltwater fish have low
salt content in body. Water is lost constantly because it goes out to the salt-
water they live in. These fish drink the saltwater they live in to get the lost
water back into their bodies to retain salt/water balance.
Recognizing Traits to Identify Fish
A fish’s life, habits, and movement are completely dependent upon its overall
body form and size. When you look at the mouth structure and fin design of
each species, you can discover many clues to help answer questions about
the way a fish survives, eats, and moves through water.
Discovering how a fish’s physical form evolved over a long period of time to
guarantee its survival in different aquatic environments helps you recognize
unfamiliar species and can give you an immediate idea of what their aquar-
ium requirements probably are. Although this is not a scientific rule, it works
about 95 percent of the time.
Body shape
The specific shape of a fish’s body can tell you about its natural habitat and
swimming range. The streamlined body of a zebra danio, for example, allows
it to slip smoothly and effortlessly through open water with quick bursts of
speed. You won’t find danios living in stagnant swamps in the wild. 
91
Chapter 7: Fish Anatomy

Other types of fish have different body shapes that help them in their native
environments. For example, the tapered shape of a discus lessens water fric-
tion and helps the discus conserve its energy as it quickly slips between
obstacles (such as tightly packed roots in its native environment) to catch its
prey. You find this fish living in areas with sunken tree roots and other types
of natural barriers.
Round-shaped aquatic species, such as fancy goldfish, are slow swimmers
and tire quite easily. You find these species living in slow-moving waters.
Fish that are flat on their ventral (bottom) side, such as the cory, spend the
great majority of their time moving along the substrate bed in your home
aquarium.
Taxonomy
Scientists classify fish as such because of their unique traits that separate
them from other animals. Mammals such as whales and dolphins are not
“fish” because they are warm-blooded and are required to come to the sur-
face in order to breathe. As we know, fish do not need to breathe air because
they have the ability to extract oxygen from the water around them.
Scientists classify animals into large groups that have similar physical attrib-
utes. This system is called taxonomy. Ichthyologists (people who spend their
time studying fish) place aquatic species into several categories based on
physical traits so that they can, for example, differentiate fish from other
aquatic animals.
Scientists classify bony fish as having: a backbone (vertebrae), a small skele-
ton that protects and supports body weight and internal organs, fins, rays
made of cartilage or bone, gill respiration, separate sexes, and a brain case.
About 90 percent of the world’s fish are bony. The common fish you find in
your freshwater aquarium are bony fish.
92
Part II: Fish and How to Care for Them 
Cold-bloodedness 
The fish in your aquarium are cold-blooded. All
this means is that their body temperature
depends on the temperature of the water around
them. Metabolic rate also plays a role in body
temperature — active fish have a slightly higher
body temperature than lethargic fish.

Mouth location
The way a fish’s mouth is shaped and the direction it points have quite a lot
to do with the manner in which it feeds and the range (bottom, middle, or
top) of aquarium water in which it spends most of its time.
Aquatic species such as the hatchet fish have an upturned mouth, indicating
that they are top feeders who scoop up flakes and floating food on the
water’s surface in the aquarium. This upward-turned mouth is also known as
a superior position.
A turned-down mouth (inferior position) is found in many bottom-dwelling
species such as catfish. These fish feed along the gravel bed and from flat
rock surfaces and plant leaves.
When the mouth faces straight away from the fish’s face, this is known as a
terminal position and is common in species that swim in mid-water, such as
goldfish and platys. These species feed by “picking off” food as it sinks.
Scales
Most fish have a body covered by scales that overlap each other like roof
shingles. Scales are formed of transparent plates that protect the body from
injury. These thin structures also serve to streamline for efficient gliding. A
slimy mucus layer covers the tops of the scales to provide smoothness and
protect against invading parasites and infection.
Not all fish have scales, however. As usual, there are a few exceptions.
Here are a few types of scales found in bony fishes: 
 Ctenoid scales have tiny little teeth on their outer edges.
 Cycloid scales are smooth and round.
 Ganoid scales have a diamond shape and can be found on species such
as gars.
Scales grow out from the skin and generally have no color. Scale color comes
from pigment cells located in the skin itself.
The swim bladder
Hypothetically, most fish should sink to the bottom of your aquarium
because they are slightly heavier than water. Their muscle and skeleton mass
is made up of substances not found in great quantities floating around in
93
Chapter 7: Fish Anatomy

water. The swim bladder helps fish overcome this problem. The swim blad-
der is an organ filled with gas that helps fish maintain their vertical position
in the water instead of sinking. The organ may be lacking in some bottom
dwellers. The walls of the bladder contract and expand regulate the correct
amount of gas to stay afloat.
Internal gas adjustments through the use of a specialized duct allow fish to
remain suspended with little or no effort. A gas gland introduces gas to the
bladder to increase its volume and increase buoyancy when it excretes lactic
acid that allows gas in the blood to diffuse into the bladder. To reduce buoy-
ancy, gas is released from the bladder into the bloodstream and then
expelled by gills into the water. 
When a fish moves to the bottom of an aquarium, its swim bladder automati-
cally compresses, and the fish sinks. To correct this problem, gas must be
added to the swim bladder to achieve buoyancy again. When a fish decides
to move toward the top of the tank, its upward movement releases gas from
its swim bladder. Otherwise, the fish would be forced to expend too much
physical energy to move to a deeper depth.
Color and its purpose
Pigment cells (known as chromatophores) in the skin are responsible for a
fish’s color. Different shades of colors in fish warn off predators and attract
mates. The social use of this physical attribute has not been lost in the cap-
tivity of the home aquarium. Many species of freshwater and brackish fish
have adopted new colors that have appeared through selective breeding and
use them to their own advantage in mating and aggression displays.

W
hen you go to purchase your new fish, you need to have a general idea
as to which species can survive in your particular type of system.
Otherwise, you may end up with a bunch of marine fish floating at the top of
your freshwater aquarium. You simply can’t mix apples and oranges in aquar-
iums. Save that combination for Sunday’s fruit salad.
This chapter gives you a general overview of major fish families and shows
you where they fit into each type of aquarium system. This chapter also
helps you understand special dietary and social needs of many species. Most
of the fish listed in this chapter are excellent choices for beginners. (We give
you plenty of warning about those that aren’t.)
This chapter presents you with many scientific names. A scientific name is
usually based on Greek or Latin, and uses two words. The first word is the
genus (a group of related species) that the fish fit into. The second word is
the species (a group of animals that can interbreed) within that genus. The
species name is sometimes the same as the person who first described the
fish. A named ending in i means that a man first described the fish. A name
ending in ae means that a woman first described the species. Because no one
could pronounce half of these strange names, a common name (like guppy) is
also given to each fish.
All you need to do is to memorize a few common scientific names so you can
look cool around other hobbyists.
Now that you have the scientific information, let’s move on to the important
stuff.

96
Part II: Fish and How to Care for Them 
Freshwater Tropical Fish 
and Invertebrates
As you already know from the early chapters in this book, the freshwater
tropical aquarium system does not require any marine salt (however, some
species, such as mollies, enjoy a teaspoon per 5 gallons added) and generally
requires some type of heater. This type of system also usually contains live
plants and has gravel for substrate.
Anabantids
The anabantids are a group of fish native to African and Asian waters. These
fish have a specialized organ called a labyrinth that helps them breathe
atmospheric air in the low-oxygenated waters of their native environment.
This doesn’t mean you should keep them in an aquarium that lacks aeration.
If you do, your fish will eventually become ill due to poor water conditions.
Anabantids are generally peaceful species that swim in the middle to upper
levels of the aquarium tank. They are easy to breed.
Climbing perch (Anabas testudineus)
This amazing fish can live several days without water, and has been known to
travel across land in its native environment as it moves from pond to pond.
Keep climbing perch in water near 80 degrees F and provide plenty of shelter for
them (rock caves and so on). This fish should be kept with its own kind. The
climbing perch grows to 10 inches in length, is carnivorous, and swims in all
levels of the tank. A climbing perch requires a tank of at least 125 gallons and is
a good choice once you have mastered a few of the easier-to-keep species.
Key terms to remember
Knowing the following terms can help you get
the most out of this chapter.
Carnivore: Any organism that eats animals as
the main portion of its diet.
Herbivore: Any organism that eats plant mater-
ial as the main portion of its diet.
Omnivore: Any organism that eats both plant
and animal material as the main portion of its
diet.
Community tank: An aquarium where many dif-
ferent compatible species of fish are kept
together.

Betta or Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendens)
The Asian Siamese fighting fish, also known as the betta (Figure 8-1), has
been bred for years to develop strains that have long flowing fins and bright
colors. Males of this species are aggressive toward each other so you should
only have one male per tank. You can keep Siamese fighting fish in a commu-
nity aquarium as long as the other fish are not fin nippers. 
Bettas build bubble nests by blowing air from their mouths in the form of
bubbles that cling together in a mass. If you want to spawn them, they should
be kept at a temperature of 76–83 degrees F. The betta is omnivorous and
swims in all levels of the tank. Bettas enjoy being fed floating foods and
freeze-dried bloodworms. Remember that bettas are not a very active fish, so
they will not eat as much as more robust varieties.
The betta is a beautiful fish that has a special organ in its head (called the
labyrinth organ) which allows it to breathe oxygen from the air at the water’s
surface. Good tankmates include corys, danios, and angelfish. Other bubble
nest builders include some gouramis and paradise fish.
Paradise fish (Macropodus opercularis)
The beautifully striped and speckled paradise fish is native to China and
South Korea. When frightened, the paradise fish loses its color quickly.
Paradise fish build bubble nests for spawning, and prefer a temperature of 75
degrees F. The paradise fish is carnivorous and swims in all levels of the tank,
and generally grows to lengths of between 3–4 inches.
Figure 8-1:

on average
2–3 years

97
Chapter 8: Finding Your Species

The paradise fish is aggressive, and should be kept with other paradise fish
in a group and with hardy tankmate species of its own size. Some males con-
stantly fight with each other. Good tankmates include loaches, tiger barbs,
danios, gouramis, and red-tailed sharks. 
Cyprinodonts and livebearers
The cyprinodont group is also known as toothcarps because they have tiny
teeth. This group contains both livebearing and egg-laying fish and contains
some of the most popular and classic community fish (guppies, platys, and
swordtails). Cyprinodonts are friendly, easy to breed, and swim in all levels of
the tank.
Killifish
Although most killifish prefer soft, acidic water, a few species can be kept in a
community aquarium. The killifish swims in the upper to middle levels of the
tank and is carnivorous. Killifish should be kept in schools (three or more fish).
Medaka or rice fish (Oryzias latipes)
This species is native to China, Japan, and South Korea. Keep rice fish in a
school (three or more fish) to ensure their survival in a community aquar-
ium. Rice fish prefer a well-planted tank and fertilize their eggs internally (the
eggs hatch in 10–12 days.) This species has been known to jump out of a
tank, so a tight-fitting hood is a must. The rice fish is carnivorous, requires
live food, and swims in the upper level of the tank.
Rice fish enjoy a pH of 7.0 and a temperature of 64 –75 degrees F. They grow
to an adult size of about 2 inches. Rice fish enjoy moving water and should
therefore be provided with aerated water through use of a filter or airstones.
Striped panchax (Aplocheilus lineatus)
This great community fish is also an aquarium jumper, so make sure your
aquarium hood is secure. This egg-laying species uses plants for shelter and
to spawn, so provide plenty of plants. The panchax is carnivorous, requires
live food, and swims in the upper level of the tank.
Guppy (Poecilia reticulata)
The Central American guppy (Figure 8-2) is an amazing little fish. It has been
the staple of many community aquariums since the hobby began. Guppies
are now available in a wide variety of colors and fin shapes. Many hobbyists
have started out by keeping guppies as aquatic friends. This fish rocks! The
guppy is omnivorous and swims in all levels of the tank. Though often inex-
pensive, do not overlook the beauty of these little fish, because they can pro-
vide years of joy as you watch their very active lifestyle and mating rituals.
98
Part II: Fish and How to Care for Them 

The male’s anal fin has evolved over time into a specialized organ called a
gonopodium (a rodlike extension), which it uses to internally fertilize a
female’s eggs. Guppies are best kept in a well-planted tank in a ratio of one
male to every three females. 
The guppy should be kept in water that has a temperature of between 78–82
degrees F. Guppies do best with one tablespoon of aquarium salt added for
every 5 gallons of water. Guppies do well with flake food and are highly
appreciative of frozen brine shrimp as a treat.
Good tankmates can include swordtails, ghost shrimp, glassfish, neon tetras,
white clouds, and corys.
Swordtail (Xiphophorus helleri)
The swordtail (native to Mexico, Honduras, and Guatemala) is a brightly col-
ored fish that makes a good addition to any community aquarium.
The males of this species have an elongated caudal fin extension that resem-
bles, not surprisingly, a sword. Male swordtails, like guppies, have a
gonopodium (see the preceding “Guppy” section) and prefer heavily planted
tanks.
Swordtails are very active and should be kept in water that is slightly hard
(has high mineral content such as magnesium, calcium, and sulfates). The
water temperature should be kept between 78–82 degrees F. Like other live-
bearers, the swordtails do well by having one tablespoon of aquarium salt
added for every 5 gallons of water in the tank. The swordtail is omnivorous
and swims in all levels of the tank.

Chapter 8: Finding Your Species

If you want to breed this fish, you should have a ratio of one male to three
females for best results. Having more females helps to ensure that breeding
will occur, and will keep the male from harassing one female constantly.
Harassment can lead to stress, illness, and death.
Swordtails can reach average lengths of up to 5 inches in captivity and will
live 3–5 years in good water conditions.
Sailfin molly (Poecilia latipinna)
The sailfin molly (Figure 8-3) is a beautiful species native to the brackish
waters of the United States and Mexico. The male’s dorsal fin, when erect,
looks like the sail on a ship. Keep mollies in a well-planted tank and provide
extra vegetation in their diet. 
This species can be aggressive toward smaller fish, but generally makes a
great community member. Good tankmates include corys, swordtails,
angelfish, tetras such as the red serapae, and platys.
Mollies enjoy slightly salty water, so you can add about one teaspoon of salt for
every 5 gallons of water to make them happy. Keep the water between 78–82
degrees. The sailfin molly is omnivorous and swims in all levels of the tank, and
generally grows up to lengths of 4 inches during their 3–5-year lifetime.
The one thing we really like about all mollies in general is that they come in
such an amazing variety of colors and patterns (marble, patches, metallic, tri-
colors, and so on). Their round bodies are cool to watch as they make their
way through your aquarium.
Make sure that the other species you keep with livebearers can tolerate the
extra salt before you add it to their aquarium. If not, mollies can live well
without it.

Platy (Xiphophorus maculatus)
Platys sport some of the most beautiful colors of all freshwater fish. This
hardy species, which is native to Mexico, Honduras, and Guatemala, breeds
easily in the community aquarium and is very peaceful. Platys have been
developed extensively through commercial breeding and can be found with
different fin shapes and in almost every color imaginable. The platy is omniv-
orous, swims in all levels of the tank, and is easy to breed.
Keep your platys in the same salt conditions as the previously mentioned
other livebearers and let them enjoy their water temperature in the 78–82
degree F range as well. Good tankmates include angelfish, mollies, swordtails,
corys, larger tetras, and plecostomus. The platy will grow to 3 inches and live
several years.
We have to admit that this is our favorite species of fish, simply because of
its beauty, cheery round body shape, and amazing colors. The platy also
seems very alert to the owner’s presence, and we have had many that would
swim up to the glass to greet us. You simply can’t help but love this amazing
little fish which comes in such fascinating varieties as the Mickey Mouse
Platy, Marigold Platy, Calico Platy, Painted Platy, Wag Tail Platy, and Sunburst,
just to name a few. With fish sporting cool names like that in your aquarium,
how can you go wrong?
Catfish
Catfish play an important role in the aquarium system. These species gener-
ally feed off the substrate as they gather unwanted debris. Catfish often sur-
vive by using their barbels (specialized organs used for tasting) to locate the
leftovers that fall to the bottom of the tank, but should be provided with a
diet of sinking pellets as well. Many species are nocturnal (more active at
night), so feed them the sinking food formulated especially for them accord-
ingly. Catfish can be aggressive if they are not kept with species their own
size, and most are omnivorous.
It is not true that catfish eat fish waste. You have to feed them fish food just
like all other kinds of fish.
Bristlenose catfish (Ancistrus temmincki)
The bristlenose catfish is a prehistoric-looking member of the Loricariidae
family. Males of this species carry a double row of bristles on their snouts,
whereas the females bear only a single row. The bristlenose’s mouth is
formed into a sucker disk that it uses to feed on algae in its native habitat.
This South American catfish is herbivorous, lives in the lower level of the
aquarium, and is peaceful.
101
Chapter 8: Finding Your Species

Glass catfish (Kryptopterus bicirrhis)
The glass catfish is a fascinating animal with a transparent body: You can
actually see this fish’s backbone and internal organs through its body wall.
You can even see the food they have eaten before it is broken down, by look-
ing through their body.
Keep this peaceful Southeast Asian fish in schools (at least three). The glass
catfish is carnivorous and swims in the middle and lower sections of the tank.
Make sure you have plenty of live plants (such as Java fern) in the tank for
this species because they like to hang around them most of the time. Keep
their water clean to avoid disease. Glass cats do not do well with many med-
ications, so prevention is the key with this species.
The temperature of the water for glass catfish should be kept between 75–79
degrees F, and soft water with a pH between 6.2–7.0. This fish lives on insects in
its native waters; so it should be fed a diet that includes live foods, such as
daphnia. Keep this fish in a group with its own kind because it is a schooling
fish in the wild and will become very shy and inactive without others of its own
type to keep it company. Never keep one alone without other glass catfish.
Glass catfish are good with most non-aggressive community fish such as 
guppies.
Upside-down catfish (Synodontis species)
True to its unusual name, the upside-down catfish swims with its abdomen
pointed upward. This beautiful little fish from tropical Africa changes its
body shading according to its swimming position. The peaceful upside-down
catfish is carnivorous and swims in all levels of the tank.
This fish does well in temperatures between 72–79 degrees F and have been
known to live more than five years. Upside-down catfish grow to lengths of
3–4 inches in the home aquarium, have a forked tail and three sets of barbels,
and should be kept in small schools. The dorsal side of the fish is lighter in
color, which (used for camouflage) is the complete opposite of most other
species that swim in an upright direction. This fish usually has a beautiful
mottled body in earth tones.
If you want to keep your upside-down catfish healthy, make sure you have
plenty of plants, rocks, and decorations in the tank because they love to
search for tasty tidbits along surface areas. Feed this species insect larva and
algae discs that they have a great time nibbling at.
Suckermouth catfish (Hypostomus plecostomus)
One of the most famous catfish known to the aquarium hobbyist is the sucker-
mouth. Hypostomus is also known as the pleco. This fish has a leopard-print pat-
tern of spots and can grow to a length of over one foot, so make sure you have
102
Part II: Fish and How to Care for Them 

plenty of space for this species to grow. This species can be slightly territorial,
so good tankmates can include fish that can hold their own, such as larger 
cichlids.
Suckermouth catfish do well in temperatures between 69–79 degrees F and is
very tolerant of most normal aquarium conditions.
Constantly in search of food, the suckermouth may tear up vegetation if your
aquarium is planted as it bashes its way through anything in its path. The
suckermouth is herbivorous (it loves to remove algae from your aquarium)
and swims in the lower and middle levels of the tank.
If you want smaller versions, you can purchase clown plecos or the
bristlenose pleco which only grow to a couple inches in length.
Cory (Corydoras species)
Probably the most popular species of catfish for the home aquarium is the
cory (Figure 8-4). Corys come in a wide variety of spotted and striped pat-
terns, are inexpensive, and do a good job cleaning debris (fallen food, dead
plant leaves) from the bottom of the tank. The friendly little blackfin cory
from South America is one outstanding omnivorous member of this genus
that swims in the lower levels. Corys should be kept in schools (at least
three) and are easily bred by amateurs. Females are larger and rounder than
the males of the species.
They spend most of their time in search of food, so make sure you provide
them will sinking pellet foods such as algae wafers. These fish can reach
lengths of 2–3 inches on average in a home aquarium and have been known
to live as long as ten years.
Keep their water temperature between 72–78 degrees. Good tankmates
include livebearers, rasboras, danios, barbs, tetras, gouramis, angelfish, rain-
bowfish, and other peaceful scavengers such as the pleco.

Chapter 8: Finding Your Species

Characins
The characins are one of the most diverse groups of fish, including the small
tetras and the big, bad piranha of movie fame. Members of this group are
characterized by the bones that link their swim bladder and inner ear. Many
characins also have a small adipose fin on their top side between the tail and
dorsal fins.
Glowlight tetra (Hemigrammus erythrozonus)
The glowlight tetra of South America is an interesting little fish with a glowing
line running from its eye to the base of its tail and a small adipose fin behind
the dorsal. When the lights in the tank are dim, you can easily see the beauti-
ful red stripe running down its side.
The peaceful yet very active glowlight tetra prefers soft, acidic water and a
well-planted tank that is kept between 75–80 degrees F. It is omnivorous and
swims in all levels of the tank. It is normal for their colors to fade if they
become too stressed out.
This species is a schooling fish and must be kept with its own kind in groups
of five or more in order for it to thrive successfully. This fish will reach
lengths of 1–11⁄4 inches and has been reported to live as long as ten years in
good aquarium conditions.
Good tankmates for this fish include other small tetras, small gouramis,
danios, angelfish, small catfish, and livebearers.
Bleeding heart tetra (Hyphessobrycon erythrostigma)
The South American bleeding heart tetra earned its name from its physical
attributes. This silver-colored fish has a red spot on its side that makes it
look as if Clint Eastwood just shot it at high noon. If you loved the movie E.T.,
you will really enjoy this wonderful little fish.
The bleeding heart needs plenty of swimming room and is easily spooked.
This semi-peaceful fish (it may be aggressive toward smaller fish) is omnivo-
rous and swims near the middle level of the tank. The bleeding heart tetra
grows to lengths of 21⁄2 inches and should be kept in temperatures between
72–82 degrees F. Make sure you provide plenty of bushy plants for this
species.
Like many other tetras, this fish should be kept in a school of its own kind, so
that it will feel safe and secure. Bleeding heart tetras will happily eat a wide
variety of foods including brine shrimp, bloodworms, frozen foods, and
flakes. When you first get these fish home they may have a slightly “washed-
out” look (most species will for a few hours to a few days), but they will gain
back their beautiful colors after they have settled into their new home. 
104
Part II: Fish and How to Care for Them 

Neon tetra (Paracheirodon innesi)
The South American neon tetra (Figure 8-5) is one of the most popular and
recognizable fish in an aquarium. This peaceful little fish has a blue-green
stripe that glitters down the side of its body, and a beautiful red half-stripe
below that. The neon is omnivorous, swims at mid level in the tank, needs to
be kept in schools (at least six to eight minimum), and is quite difficult to
breed in captivity. Males are thinner than the females of the species.
Neons will grow up to an inch and a half in captivity and can live as long as
ten years. Keep this fish in water with a temperature between 70–78 degrees
F and a well-planted tank. This species does not do well under bright lighting,
so make sure to subdue the atmosphere as much as possible.
Unfortunately this fish will be eaten by larger species, so keep it with fish that
are peaceful and similar in size such as the cardinal tetra, small community
fish, and the glowlight tetra.
Serpae tetra (Hyphessobrycon serpae)
This fish takes it name from its beautiful color resemblance to a Mexican
serape (large shawl). The peaceful serpae is a mid-level swimmer and is omniv-
orous. It is one of the larger tetra species and can be slightly aggressive with
smaller fish. It should be kept in a school of six or more of its own species.
Keep their water temperature between 78–80 degrees, as they tend to chill
easily. Good tankmates include mollies, swordtails, plecos, and corys. This
fish is known to live on average of 5–6 years.
Cardinal tetra (Paracheirodon axelrodi)
The cardinal tetra is similar in appearance to the neon tetra, except that it
has a larger area of red coloring on its abdomen. The peaceful cardinal
prefers soft, acidic waters (below 6.8 pH) and is omnivorous. This fish swims
in all levels of the tank, should be kept in schools (at least six to eight), and
should never be housed with any larger, aggressive tankmates.
Figure 8-5:
Neon tetras

105
Chapter 8: Finding Your Species

Cardinal tetras will eat almost any food including flake, live, and frozen.
Rummy-nose tetra (Hemigrammus bleheri)
The rummy-nose tetra is a peaceful fish that should be kept with other small
tetras of equal size. Its name comes from the fact that it has a red splotch of
color around its nose and eyes.
This species will eat almost any food offered and should be kept in water that
is between 72–79 degrees F and softly acidic, with a pH between 6 and 6.8.
Unusual characins
There are many different types of characins. The following sections give
examples of some that are quite unusual in physical form. Unusual is cool!
Blindcave fish (Astyanax fasciatus mexicanus)
The blindcave fish has no eyes and navigates in dark, underground caves in
the wild using its lateral line (see Chapter 7). The body is pink in color overall
with a red gill area. This is an amazing little fish that should not be over-
looked as a great asset to any aquarium with compatible species.
This fish grows up to 3 inches in captivity and is an egglayer. A school con-
sisting of five members makes a great addition to the community tank. The
blindcave fish is omnivorous and should be kept in waters that are near 72
degrees F with a pH of 7.4. If you are going to keep blindcave fish, make sure
you provide them with small caves built out of rocks (or pre-manufactured
aquarium caves) so they can feel secure.
Silver hatchetfish (Gasteropelecus sternicla)
The body of the silver hatchetfish body resembles the blade of a large ax.
This peaceful South American fish eats live insects and should be kept in
schools (of at least three), which will stay near the top of the tank. 
This very active species requires excellent water conditions to survive and
will not do well in a dirty tank with little oxygen. The water temperature
should be kept between 72–79 degrees, with a pH between 6–7. They require
an aquarium that has plenty of swimming room and do best if provided with
current created by powerheads or other equipment. 
Good tankmates include tetras, loaches, livebearers, angelfish, and rasporas.
Hatchetfish are good with plants (not eating or tearing them up), so provide
them with plenty. Feed them plenty of frozen foods that include insect larvae,
as they feed on them in the wild.
106
Part II: Fish and How to Care for Them 

The silver hatchetfish can leap from your aquarium to your driveway in a
single bound using their winglike pectoral fins, so keep a tight lid on your
aquarium to avoid this problem.
Pacu (Colossoma bidens)
Pacus grow quickly in any home aquarium and are related to piranhas. The
big difference here is that pacus are mainly vegetarians, whereas piranhas
are carnivores. This fish should never be kept in an aquarium that is less
than 55 gallons, period. They enjoy a water temperature between 78–82
degrees F.
A pacu looks like a piranha, grows to the size of your mid-sized car, and can
eat you out of house and home. This species can grow rapidly and reach
adult lengths of 12–30 inches in a home aquarium! These fish have been
known to slam against the aquarium glass when panicked, so always provide
them with plants or rocks to hide behind.
This fish is suppose to be herbivorous, but don’t bet the bank (or your
smaller fish) on it. Many hobbyists have seen them attack and swallow
smaller fish, so they should be kept with larger species such as oscars, tinfoil
barbs, plecos, and knife fish. This species should be fed pellet food that is
supplemented with fresh vegetables in small amounts. The pacu swims at
mid level.
Red-bellied piranha (Serrasalmus nattereri)
Forget it. Don’t even think about it unless you are an experienced hobbyist.
Too many of these fish have ended up dumped in local rivers by hobbyists
who end up disliking their new aggressive pets. These piranhas (Figure 8-6)
are a danger to natural species in rivers and should never be put there.
Figure 8-6:
You can
forget about
owning a
piranha until

experi-
enced.
107
Chapter 8: Finding Your Species

Once again, the piranha is dangerous and often illegal to buy, sell, or own
in many states. It is a large predator! If you temporarily lose your mind and
think about buying this fish, seek professional help immediately. They have
been known to bite fingers and hands that have been submerged into an
aquarium, especially if they have not been fed enough, and this could be
tragic, especially if you have young children in the home. Piranha should be
left in the hands of experienced aquarists only!
Silver dollar (Mylossoma pluriventre)
This neat fish resembles a silver dollar in form and color. The silver dollar is
herbivorous and may destroy aquarium plants if you have them. These fish
are generally peaceful, but a few bad apples can become quite aggressive
when larger. For best results, keep silver dollars in a school of five to eight in
a species tank.
These fish require lots of swimming space, with a water temperature between
78–82 degrees F, and should be kept in tanks larger than 55 gallons because
they can grow up to 6 inches in length. Silver dollars are vegetarians by
nature and should be fed floating flake food.
Good tankmates for the silver dollar include angelfish, mollies, giant danios,
and larger catfish such as the pleco who won’t easily be bullied.
Three-lined pencilfish (Nannostomus trifasciatus)
This South American species is probably the world’s coolest fish. It looks like
a swimming number-two pencil due to the dark band that runs from the nose
to the base of the caudal fin. You may not find it in stock at pet stores, but
you can usually order it. 
The three-lined pencilfish is omnivorous, peaceful, and requires thick vegeta-
tion. Add floating plants and dark gravel to diffuse the light so it will feel
secure. The temperature should be between 72–81 degrees F with a pH that
falls between 6.5–6.9 for best results.
The males become darker as they age than do females and will often battle
with other males, although not to usually to the point of injury or death.
Loaches
Loaches are an interesting group of species from Asia and India. Loaches
resemble streamlined catfish and, like catfish, are bottom dwellers that use
barbels to search for food. These fish can also extract oxygen from the air by
gulping it. Most species are nocturnal, so unless you up late at night, you may
not see them too often. Loaches are carnivorous, swim in the lower levels of
the tank, and are often shy by nature.
108
Part II: Fish and How to Care for Them 

Clown loach (Botia macracantha)
The Indonesian clown loach (Figure 8-7) is scaleless (do not add any medica-
tions that do not state on the package that they are safe for scaleless fish!),
striped like a tiger, and spends most of its time peacefully foraging for food
near the bottom of the tank. The clown loach is carnivorous and is best kept
in a small school of three to five. Loaches often lay on their sides or backs
when resting, so remember that this is normal.
Excellent tankmates include danios, livebearers, small gouramis, corys, and
rainbowfish. Try to avoid very slow-moving, mellow tankmates, because the
high activity and darting of the loaches can stress out their aquatic compan-
ions. This species has been known to live as long as 20 years in the home
aquarium (keep this in mind, as older fish can reach lengths of greater than
one foot.)
The clown loach tank should be dimly lit and provided with good water cur-
rent, fine gravel or sand for substrate, and rock caves to match the streams of
their natural habitat. They can thrive in waters ranging from 72–85 degrees F.
This species will eat almost anything and really enjoys sinking tablet foods,
worms, brine shrimp, and tubifex worms as a treat.
Orange-finned loach (Botia modesta)
The orange-finned loach has a blue-gray body with bright orange fins. Like
other loach species, it has small spines on its eyes. This species hides during
the day and is very shy. The orange-finned loach swims in the lower levels of
the tank, is carnivorous, and makes clicking noises to attract mates. 
The water conditions, tank setup, and nutrition for this species are similar to
that required for clown loaches.
Figure 8-7:
Clown

Chapter 8: Finding Your Species

Zebra loach (Botia striata)
The zebra loach is very nocturnal in nature and becomes very active at night.
It is a very pretty fish that sports black and greenish tinted stripes. Tank-
mates can include danios, rainbow fish, gouramis, small cichlids, livebearers,
and barbs.
The water conditions, tank setup, and nutrition for this species are similar to
that required for clown loaches (see earlier in this section).
African cichlids
Cichlids are native to the Americas, Asia, and Africa. Old World Cichlids
include species from Lake Malawi, Lake Tanganyika, Lake Victoria, West
Africa, India, Sri Lanka, and Madagascar. A few examples of these fish include
jewelfish, orange chromides, and mubuna.
Native species like hard alkaline water. Most species (with a few exceptions)
tend to be aggressive and are best kept in a species tank with their own
kind. Some cichlids require special water conditions — we note them where
applicable.
Although many cichlids have a thick body that can grow quite large, a few
small varieties are suitable for the home aquarium.
Kribensis (Pelvicachromis pulcher)
The West African kribensis is a generally peaceful, rainbow-colored fish. The
kribensis is an omnivorous bottom-dweller. This species can become aggres-
sive during breeding time and should only be kept with other like-size African
cichlids and catfish. 
It should be fed with vegetable-based African cichlid food, and pairs should
be kept in a tank that ranges from 72–82 degrees F in water temperature.
Plants and rocks should be provided so that they can feel secure.
Jewel cichlid (Hemichromis bimaculatus)
The jewel cichlid has a pretty golden color with a dark band traversing its
body length. It should be fed with vegetable-based African cichlid food and
insect larvae and be kept in an aquarium that ranges from 72–82 degrees F in
water temperature. Plants and rocks should be provided so that they can feel
secure.
110
Part II: Fish and How to Care for Them 

Electric yellow cichlid (Labidochromis caeruleus)
This species is marked by its beautiful and bright yellow color and black-
marked fins that make it resemble a thin lemon. This species is less aggres-
sive than most cichlids but can be difficult to find. 
The tank setup is similar to the Kribensis, and it should be fed a diet that con-
sists of both vegetable and meat content such as bloodworms and brine
shrimp.
Blue johanni (Melanochromis johanni)
The male of this species has a beautiful, blue-colored body with slightly
darker fins and should be fed a diet that consists of vegetable products. The
aquarium conditions are similar to the kribensis.
American cichlids
New World cichlids include species from Central America and South America.
A few species include oscars, Jack Dempseys, convicts, angelfish, firemouths,
and discus.
Keyhole (Aequidens maronii)
The keyhole cichlid is a pale, peaceful fish with a dark band running through
its eyes and a black keyhole-shaped spot on it side. This species usually only
reaches lengths of 3–5 inches in captivity and should be kept with other non-
aggressive fish such as barbs, danios, loaches, catfish, and gouramis. 
The keyhole prefers a heavily planted tank and is an omnivorous bottom-
dweller.
Angelfish (Pterophyllum scalare)
The angelfish (Figure 8-8) is such a delicate-looking species; you can only
wonder how it can possibly be related to other cichlids. Angelfish have long
dorsal and anal fins they use for balance. They come in a wide variety of
colors and patterns, including marble, white, and striped. Angelfish are one
of the most beautiful and inspiring fish on earth. Just having one of these
marvelous creatures is enough to suck you into the aquarium hobby for a
lifetime.
A deep and long tank is best for this peaceful, carnivorous species, with a
water temperature of 78–82 degrees F. Feed them flake food and toss in some
brine shrimp for a treat. Angelfish are egglayers and are easily bred in the
home aquarium.
111
Chapter 8: Finding Your Species

Red oscar (Astronotus ocellatus)
The red oscar is an Amazonian giant (growing to lengths of over 12 inches in
the home aquarium) who may quickly outgrow your tank, so a 70-gallon tank
is a minimum requirement for one or two fish. This animal is carnivorous and
eats anything it can fit into its large mouth and will eventually need to be fed
cichlid pellet food.
One cool thing about an oscar is that you can hand tame it to accept food
from you.
Oscars spend most of their time swimming in the middle levels of the tank.
You can easily fool your friends into thinking that you are risking life and limb
by feeding them.
Oscars enjoy water that is kept between 72–78 degrees and feel secure with a
sandy substrate and rocks. Oscars will tear up plants, so if you do use artifi-
cial ones, prepare yourself to a daily routine of replanting them. If you put
live plants in your oscar tank, say your permanent goodbyes as you are
arranging them, because the next time you see them they will probably
resemble confetti.
If kept in small groups, oscars tend to bicker with each other, so it is better to
keep them in groups of eight or more. Unfortunately keeping this many
oscars would require you to borrow a tank from Seaworld, so prepare to keep
a single or two who will fight on and off. Tankmates can include knifefish,
large plecos, tinfoil barbs, and other large cichlids of the same size.

Oscars can live a very long time. There are reports of them surviving over 25
years in captivity.
Convict (Cichlasoma nigrofasciatum)
If you want to impress your friends with your breeding abilities, the convict
cichlid (Figure 8-9) is the fish for you. This hardy cichlid would breed in a
puddle of water during an earthquake if given half a chance. Rabbits can’t
hold a candle to convicts. Both parents care for their young. The convict is
aggressive, swims in the middle to lower sections of the aquarium, is carnivo-
rous, and should be kept in a well-planted species tank (tanks that only con-
tain fish of the same species).
The convict gets its name from the vertical black and white stripes on its
body that resemble the prison uniforms you see in old movies. This fish is
constantly alert, quick, and very territorial. Pink convicts are another, quite
beautiful variety.
Convicts will eat any fish food offered to them. They should be kept in a tank
that has plenty of caves for breeding and hiding and has a water temperature
of 68–75 degrees F. This species should only be kept with other fish of similar
size and bad-boy attitude.

Discus (Symphysodon varieties)
The discus (Figure 8-10) is the king of the cichlids, the Mona Lisa of the fish
world. This flat fish, which resembles a plastic throwing disk, has been com-
mercially bred to produce stunning colors. Not only are discus beautiful, they
are well behaved as well. Who could ask for more?
These fish are carnivorous and should be kept in schools of at least three to
five. They can be fed frozen brine shrimp, cichlid flakes, and insect larvae. They
will grow to over 5 inches in a home aquarium. Discus live in natural waters that
have a temperature between 78–84 degrees F. and a pH of about 4.5–6.0.
Discus water must be soft and acidic. Many hobbyists use RO units to mimic
its natural waters and combine this in a mix with tap water. However, you
must also add trace elements and minerals (available in liquid form at your
pet store) back to the water to make it suitable for your aquarium fish.
Discus can be very expensive, but are very popular and well worth the
investment.
Cyprinids
The cyprinids are a diverse family that includes barbs, danios, and rasboras.
Tiger barb (Barbus tetrazona)
The tiger barb (Figure 8-11) is an orange and black striped fish native to
Southeast Asia. This fish is omnivorous and swims in the middle and lower
sections of the tank. Tiger barb can become quite aggressive and should be
kept in a species tank or with fishes of similar size and temperament. Good
tankmates could include plecos, livebearers, barbs, rainbowfish, and loaches.
Figure 8-10:

Part II: Fish and How to Care for Them 

Tiger barbs are territorial, so the larger the tank the better. This species will
eat almost anything offered and should be fed a mixture of meaty foods and
vegetable-based fish food. The water temperature for this species is 70–74
degrees F. Make sure you have lots of plants and decorations to provide them
hiding places when they start to pick on each other.
Cherry barb (Barbus titteya)
Like its name suggests, this species of barb has a light red iridescent color
and is shaped somewhat like a diamond. Even the sides of the fish have dia-
mond-shaped markings. Maybe they should have called it the diamond
cherry barb.
If provided with a planted tank and a school of its own kind, the cherry barb
is generally peaceful and even timid around other species. Tank conditions
are similar to the tiger barb.
Green barb (Barbus tetrazona)
The green barb gets its name from its emerald green color. This fish can get
slightly aggressive and nip fins. Aquarium conditions and tankmates are simi-
lar to the tiger barb.
Zebra danio (Brachydanio rerio)
The South Asian zebra danio is one of the most popular community fish. The
little speed demon makes the top of your tank look like the Indianapolis 500.
This omnivorous, torpedo-shaped wonder is gold with blue stripes and very
hardy. Keep danio in schools of five to seven in a tank with dense foliage
where they can lay their eggs. Danios tend to fade away and die without a
school, so give them some aquatic buddies.
Figure 8-11:

Chapter 8: Finding Your Species

The zebra danio is often used as a dither fish. A dither fish is an active and
peaceful species put in a tank with slower moving species, so that the slower
moving species become more active like the dither fish. (Whew!)
The zebra danio will eat almost anything the second it hits the water, so
make sure your other fish in the same tank are getting their share, too.
Danios can live in water temperature between 64–78 degrees and are very tol-
erant of beginner mistakes.
Giant danio (Danio aequipinnatus)
This is large version of the danio species and is very peaceful community
fish. This fish is a jumper and requires lots of swimming space in waters that
range from 72–75 degrees F.
Harlequin rasbora (Rasbora heteromorpha)
The omnivorous little harlequin rasbora from Southeast Asia has an unusual
marking that makes it stand out in a crowd. The body is gold-green and has a
dark blue patch that forms a triangle on each side. This fish only grows to
about 2 inches. The rasbora should be kept in schools and swim in all levels
of the tank.
Good tankmates include angelfish, tetras, danios, catfish, community live-
bearers, and gouramis. This fish prefers a well-planted tank with waters in
the 73–77 degree F range and a pH of 6.0–6.5.
Oddballs
Here are a few other tropical fish considered oddballs as far as physical char-
acteristics are concerned. However, despite their unusual appearance, they
can be real showstoppers in your home aquarium once you have become an
experienced freshwater fishkeeper. They can impress and amaze your friends
as well.
Elephant fish or elephant nose (Gnathonemus petersi)
The African elephant fish is a peaceful, carnivorous species with an extended
jaw that resembles an elephant’s trunk. The egglaying elephant fish can emit
electrical impulses (it has poor vision and uses them to navigate) and should
be kept by itself in an aquarium. It is nocturnal, so you won’t see much action
during the daytime.
This fish enjoys subdued lighting and a well-planted tank. The elephant nose
will thrive well on tubifex worms, bloodworms, and mosquito larvae.
116
Part II: Fish and How to Care for Them 

Clown knifefish (Notopterus chitala)
The carnivorous knifefish resembles the curved blade of a Japanese sword
and grows greater than 10 inches in length. This fish is nocturnal and should
be kept by itself or with larger fish such as oscars. This species lives in the
lower levels of the tank and moves by undulating its body They have been
known to live over seven years in captivity.
The knifefish tank should be 55 gallons or larger, include dim lighting, 75–78
degree F waters, a tight-fitting lid (they are jumpers), plenty of rocks (make
sure there are no sharp edges because this species does not have scales),
and driftwood for hiding places. This species should be fed a diet of frozen
and fresh brine shrimp, bloodworms, and plankton. They really like the live
food best and should only be fed once every night after the lights have been
turned off.
Leaf fish (Monocirrhus polyacanthus)
The carnivorous South American leaf fish has a blotched skin pattern that
makes it look like a decaying leaf floating through the water. The leaf fish
floats head down and snags its prey as it floats by. This fish is cool looking
and grows up to 4 inches.
Keep it with fish of its own size or in a species tank because it is a predator.
Generally this fish will refuse any food that is not alive, so be prepared to buy
small feeder fish. The leaf fish lives in all levels of the tank and should be kept
in water that is 72–77 degrees F, with a pH of 6–6.5.
Freshwater tropical invertebrates
There are many invertebrates you can buy for your aquarium. Invertebrates
are not fish because they lack a backbone.
Ghost shrimp (Paleomonetes species)
Ghost shrimp are small (only 2 inches at maturity), have segmented bodies,
and are almost transparent except for a colored spot on their tails. This
peaceful and delicate creature with ten sets of legs makes an interesting
aquatic pet.
This species needs to be kept with passive fish that will not tear it limb from
limb. Many hobbyists set up a 10-gallon aquarium just for their ghost shrimp
so that they don’t have to worry about predators. The reverse is also true:
many hobbyists use them as feeders for other fish.
Ghost shrimp will eat almost anything in the aquarium using their tiny claws
to scoop it in. They will consume waste, algae, and almost any live, frozen, or
manufactured food. They are true scavengers.
117
Chapter 8: Finding Your Species

Freshwater Clams (Corbicual species)
Freshwater clams are from Asia and only grow to about 2 inches in the home
aquarium. This invertebrate has banded brown and black colors and spends
most of its time filter feeding. This type of feeding helps to keep your aquar-
ium clean and reduce nitrates as it removes floating particles and uneaten
food that is suspended in the water.
Freshwater clams can live in water temperatures ranging from 68–85 degrees
and are peaceful.
Singapore flower shrimp (Atyopsis moluccensis)
This beautiful red shrimp is native to Asia and reaches lengths of almost 4
inches in the home aquarium. This invertebrate is able to quickly change
colors depending on it surrounding environment.
Singapore shrimp should be kept in aquariums of over 10 gallons and happily
feed on aquarium debris by filtering it with special appendages shaped like
fans that are attached to their legs.
Ramshorn snail (Marisa cornuarietis)
This peaceful cool gold or cream-colored snail has a shell that looks like a
ram’s horn. It can live in water temperatures ranging from 70–85 degrees F
and only grows to about 2 inches. 
The interesting thing about this snail is that they require air to breathe. They
accomplish this using a siphon that sticks out of the water, like an escaped
convict using a reed to breath underwater in an old prison break movie. For
that reason you need to leave a couple of inches of open airspace on the top
of the aquarium water.
The ramshorn snail is great for cleaning up debris in the aquarium.
Freshwater Coldwater Fish 
and Invertebrates
Freshwater creatures that live in coldwater tanks do not require heating,
because they generally live at lower temperatures than do tropical ones.
The rest of the coldwater aquarium equipment is the same as for tropicals.
However, if you keep fish in an outdoor pond during the freezing winter
months, you may have to move them into a warmer area such as a holding
tank in your garage until the frigid weather passes. Goldfish secrete a lot of
waste, so good filtration is a must.
118
Part II: Fish and How to Care for Them 

Although many fish such as the guppy can live in cooler waters, we will focus
on other non-tropical varieties. In today’s market, for example, many beauti-
ful varieties of goldfish will fascinate and amaze you. These are not your
garden-variety feeder goldfish found at carnivals!
Koi
Koi (Cyprinus carpio) is a highly colored omnivorous pond fish that is related
to goldfish (Figure 8-12). Because of its large size at maturity (up to 3 feet in
length), it is unsuitable for an indoor aquarium. The torpedo-shaped koi
requires a good filtration system and many plants, which it uses for food and
shade. Champion varieties can be very expensive, but have outstanding color
and beauty.
Koi do not do well in acidic water, so their pH needs to be kept between
7.0–9.0. They must be kept in ponds that allow them to remain cool through-
out the year.

Chapter 8: Finding Your Species

Goldfish
Goldfish are one of the oldest aquarium fish known. These fish were specifi-
cally bred from carp for their beauty and have no known natural varieties. All
goldfish variations are grouped into the same species, Carassius auratus.
There are four main types of goldfish:
 Egg goldfish: Egg goldfish have no dorsal fin, are egg shaped, and have
double tails.
 Wen goldfish: The Wen goldfish have a fancy style tail and a dorsal fin.
 Dragon-eye goldfish: Dragon-eye goldfish have eyes that protrude in the
form of telescoping or bubbles.
 Common goldfish: These fish are similar in appearance to the carp from
which they were bred, but have more color variations.
Fancy goldfish have been bred for many physical characteristics including
bubble eyes, split tales, long fins, and unusual head coverings (growth).
These species can be kept in either a coldwater aquarium or a pond. Either
way, these omnivorous fish need a good filtration system and plenty of
foliage.
Black moor goldfish (Carassius auratus)
The black moor is a cool-looking goldfish that really isn’t gold at all. It is
black. The body is slightly hunched, and the caudal fin fans downward like a
lace veil draped over the top of a glass. Like many goldfish, Black Moors tend
to wobble as they swim, which is quite amusing to watch, and have protrud-
ing, velvety black eyes.
Because they belong to the carp family, goldfish are very hardy. Black moors
should be kept in tanks of 20 gallons or larger that is outfitted with either arti-
ficial or thick-leafed coldwater plant species. Goldfish tend to dig around in
the gravel and will destroy dainty plants. Toss some smooth river rocks into
the goldfish tank and watch them flip them all over the place. Keep the water
temperature between 65–70 degrees.
Due to their physical makeup, goldfish should have their protein intake lim-
ited to no more than 25–30 percent of their nutritional intake. The best thing
to feed them is manufactured goldfish food.
Good tankmates for almost all goldfish species include scavenging catfish,
such as the pleco, and other goldfish.
120
Part II: Fish and How to Care for Them 

Lionhead (Carassius auratus)
Lionheads resemble a lion in color, have a head growth like a lion’s mane, and
have thick bodies These are slow-moving fish (because they have no dorsal
fin) that need very good water conditions in order to avoid disease.
Aquarium conditions are similar to those of the black moor. This fish comes
in many colors including orange, white, blue, and black and calico mixtures.
The lionhead can growth to lengths of 10 inches and like other large goldfish
requires a lot of tank space to remain healthy and happy.
Bubble-eye goldfish (Carassius auratus)
The peaceful bubble-eye is one of the most amazing looking goldfish around.
Like the lionhead, it has no dorsal fin and wiggles to swim. As the name sug-
gests, this fish has huge fluid-filled bubble sacks beneath each eye. As the
fish gets older, the sacs grow larger and can become very heavy to the point
of slowing down their motion and keeping them near the bottom of the tank.
Because they spend a lot of their time near the substrate, make sure that all
gravel, rocks, and other aquarium decorations have smooth edges that won’t
damage their delicate eye sacks. This species also has to be kept with other
non-aggressive goldfish. The aquarium should be as large as possible so that
it has plenty of room to swim around without risking damaging its eyes on
things in the aquarium.
It is best to feed your bubble-eye goldfish sinking pellets so that they can
easily get their fair share of nutrition. Keep their water slightly warmer in the
70–75 degree F range.
Telescope-eye goldfish or dragon-eye goldfish (Carassius auratus)
This species of goldfish has round eyes that protrude outward more and
more as the first few months of development pass by. These eyes resemble
those of fictional dragons. The fish was first developed in the 16th century.
This gentle goldfish has been known to live up to 25 years in captivity.
This goldfish should be kept in water between 65–75 degrees F and should be
kept in as large a tank as possible.
Coldwater invertebrates
As you have learned, some invertebrates live in tropical tanks. There is also
one fairly common species that enjoys living in coldwater aquariums.
121
Chapter 8: Finding Your Species

Florida blue crayfish (Procambaris alleni)
The Florida Blue Crayfish is a beautiful combination of blue and gray that can
live in temperatures as low as 50 degrees F. These are best kept in a species
tank so they don’t have to worry about being eaten, and you don’t have to
worry about them eating other inhabitants. Crayfish are vulnerable when
molting. 
Crayfish are good climbers, so make sure you aquarium has a good lid.
Captive-Bred Species
People tend to think that oceans, rivers, and lakes are an endless realm over-
flowing with aquatic animal life. But as an ecologically concerned fishkeeper,
you must remember that only a small percentage of the world’s waters con-
tain the fish that you put into your aquarium. Each year, fish populations
decline due to overfishing, the curio trade, and other human interventions,
such as pollution and introduction of non-native fish into areas that are
altered by their presence. Be it freshwater, brackish, or marine, the problem
exists and is worth mentioning. 
Often fish dealers offer both captive-bred species (fish or other aquatic ani-
mals that have been raised in hatcheries for the aquarium trade) and animals
that have been caught in the wild. By purchasing captive-bred fish, you can
help slow down the elimination of wild species. Most freshwater fish are now
commercially bred to one extent or another and are usually less expensive
than those caught in the wild.
122
Part II: Fish and How to Care for Them 
Understanding setups
When your aquarium setup is complete, make
sure that you match your fish to it. Using this
chapter as a rough guide gives you a good head
start. When in doubt about an unfamiliar
species, check with your local fish shop owner
because some friendly fish have been known to
go bad and vice versa. It is better to be prepared
with knowledge than face instant disaster.
So much of the road that leads to becoming an
expert fishkeeper is dependent upon practical
experience as well as knowledge. Sometimes
when trying to choose compatible species, you
have to experiment a little to see what works
best for you and your individual setup. The size
of your tank, the number of fish it contains, and
the types of decorations in it can all have an
affect on how well your tankmates get along.

The bulk of the problem occurs in the marine side of the hobby. Few marine
fish are bred commercially because they can be quite difficult to spawn. In
the last few years, marine fish hatcheries have made great progress in repro-
ducing many species of clownfish, wrasses, and other types of saltwater fish.
At the present time, captive-bred marine species can be a little more expen-
sive than those caught in the wild, but in the long run it is well worth the
extra money to help save our natural aquatic resources. Remember this if
you go on to keep a marine tank.
The collection of live coral has also hit an all-time high in recent years. Many
areas are now prohibiting collection of live coral because the world’s reefs
are beginning to disappear due to repeated harvesting for curio shops and
the marine aquarium trade.
Many marine fish are caught by people using illegal practices and products
such as cyanide, which also destroys large portions of any coral reef that it
comes in contact with. Purchasing wild animals only encourages wholesalers
to continue removing fish and invertebrates from their native habitat.
So if you have a choice, always purchase captive-bred species (ask your
dealer if his stock is captive bred). That way your grandchildren won’t have
to have an aquarium with plastic fish suspended in it.
Buying Fish on the Web
Now you have a few good ideas about some interesting and amazing species
of fish and invertebrates for your freshwater aquarium. Remember that the
species listed in this chapter are only a drop in the bucket when you look at
the total number of fish available. It would take volumes to list every species.
Some species are easier to obtain than others are. You should patronize your
local shop whenever possible, but don’t forget that you can use the World
Wide Web to find many fish at reasonable prices. These Internet companies
are good about shipping their stock on time, and in good condition, so don’t
worry about getting what you paid for. Just make sure you check their ship-
ping costs (which vary from company to company) so that you can add them
into the total cost for your purchase.
Following are a few suggestions for purchasing fish on the net to get you
started.

This site always seems to have excellent fish that are in good condition. We
have ordered fish from this site and have always received healthy fish on

certain type of fish, it still gives you good information on that species. The
site is therefore a good source of information about fish species. The prices
are very reasonable as well.

In This Chapter
 Finding a reputable merchant
 Understanding what makes a dealer good or not so good
 Choosing healthy, appropriate fish
O
ne of the best ways to start out as a beginning hobbyist is to develop a
good relationship with a local tropical fish dealer. A quality vendor can
help you make informed decisions on the type of aquarium best suited for
you, the proper equipment for your new tank, and the best aquatic species
for your system. A good vendor can also locate hard-to-find products (such
as a filter or lid for an irregularly shaped tank) and can help you with water
testing on a regular basis.
Of course, you can do many things as an informed hobbyist to help you start
off your fishkeeping adventure with success. Choosing healthy pets from a
good local vendor is the best way to start off right, and this chapter can help.
Choosing a Quality Dealer
The aquarium hobby is generally a lifelong addiction. (We ourselves are can-
didates for Aquariums Anonymous.) It is really difficult to lay this fascinating
hobby aside once you take the plunge. In the years to come, you will need to
purchase fish, replace worn equipment, and keep stocked up on chemicals
and proper food.
During the course of your hobby, you also need expert advice on fishkeeping
skills once in a while, and someone to keep you informed on the newest
trends in equipment and other aquarium-related paraphernalia. No matter
what your skill level in fishkeeping, there is always something new to learn.
This is why you need to find a good retailer who specializes in the aquarium
aspect of the pet industry.

A knowledgeable aquarium fish dealer, especially one that is conveniently
located in your neighborhood, can help you anytime you have a problem or
emergency with your aquatic pets. Building a personal relationship with this
type of merchant also helps you stay informed on aquarium-related issues.
For these reasons and more, it is important to make contact with an informed
and trustworthy vendor. (Besides, if you get to know a dealer well, you may
be able to snag a few freebies as well.)
The search for a fish store
When you want to buy a house, you don’t just purchase the first one you see,
do you? No, you look around a bit first. The same principal applies to your
aquarium hobby. Look for the best and don’t settle for less. There’s nothing
wrong with checking the gossip in your neighborhood to determine whether
the local dealers have a good reputation among other businesses and their
customers. Friends, aquarium clubs, and family members are a great place to
start asking questions. If your family is like ours, you’ll not only hear all you
need to know about local aquarium shops, you’ll pick up a few juicy extra tid-
bits at the same time.
In today’s consumer-conscious environment, you cannot afford to end up
with mediocre service because you were afraid to investigate the references
or character of a particular dealer. You can obtain valuable information
through this age-old method.
The best strategy is to visit as many local dealers and aquarium shops as
your time and budget allow. These fun little investigative trips provide you
with a solid foundation on which you can compare dealers’ overall quality of
service, livestock selection and condition, friendliness, willingness to help,
and prices on fish and equipment. (Of course, if you are visiting New York
City, this could mean renting an RV for a couple of months until you have
seen all the retailers in the area.)
In choosing a tropical fish dealer, take into consideration a few important fac-
tors (covered in the next sections) before you pledge your loyalty to one par-
ticular shop. In fact, we find it best to frequent at least two fish shops
minimum. It’s kind of like having an ace in the hole (or up your sleeve) at a
poker game: If one shop goes out of business, or has an internal problem that
affects your ability to get good equipment or livestock, you’re still covered.
After you compare all your local fish shops, choose the two retailers you
think can satisfy all your aquarium requirements.
126
Part II: Fish and How to Care for Them 

The importance of great service
When deciding on the two best local dealers, see whether the employees are
friendly and offer good advice. Do the clerks make every attempt to help you
out when you come in, or do they just stand around shooting the breeze?
Do the shop’s workers take a personal interest in your aquarium? Are they
willing to go out of their way to make sure that you find exactly what you
need? Are there adequate personnel to provide good service to you even
during the peak hours of the day? If you have to blitz and tackle a clerk to
make him talk, then you need to find another place to shop. A reputable and
caring owner who takes pride in her business and in providing customer sat-
isfaction makes sure that her shop is well staffed with knowledgeable and
caring employees.
Employees who stand around and do nothing generally do not have an inter-
est in their employer’s business, and probably don’t have an interest in
making sure that you get the stuff for your aquarium, either. (Hopefully you
won’t see those clerks the next time you visit.)
The store’s appearance
When you go to an aquarium shop (even if you’re checking out a new one
that just opened up in the neighborhood), carefully inspect all the display
tanks for obvious signs of dealer dedication or apathy. If the place looks like
the owner couldn’t care less about how the tanks look, he probably cares just
as little about the rest of his business, including the fish. A visual inspection
can tell you quite a bit about a shop’s habits. As you look around the shop,
check for clues that distinguish a good dealer from an uncaring one.
The tanks
Quality retailers understand that the overall condition of their shop makes a
big difference as far as customers’ first impressions are concerned.
The physical condition of the tanks is a good indication of how well the fish
are taken care of on a daily basis. Ask yourself these questions:
 Are the tanks free of excess algae or do they resemble the Florida
swamps?
 Are the proper mixtures of compatible species displayed in the tanks or
does it appear that a bunch of fish have been thrown in together to save
space?
127
Chapter 9: Purchasing Your Fish

 Is the tank water clear or murky?
 Do the tanks look like they have been properly vacuumed lately?
 Is the front of the glass clean or does it still bare smudges and finger-
prints from the grade school class who visited the shop the week
before? Someone who won’t even take a couple minutes to clean the
front glass doesn’t care very much about presentation or the impression
the shop makes on its customers, and usually does not care about the
health of their fish, or their customers’ best interests either.
 Are the shelves full of merchandise, neatly stocked, and organized, or is
everything just tossed together on one shelf?
The fish
A good quality retailer has good quality fish. No exceptions. If a dedicated
dealer is not happy with his suppliers, he quickly looks for another who can
provide high-quality fish. While you are browsing through a store, see
whether the dealer’s fish are swimming boldly (out away from the decora-
tions) in the open spaces of the aquarium, or hiding in the corners. Fish that
hide in corners usually have health problems after you bring them home. If
the fish in the shop look like they just swam through a waste dump, find
another pet store.
Here are some things to look for when examining fish:
 Do the fish look generally healthy?
 Are the fish’s fins erect?
 Does the body display proper color?
 Does the fish have a good shape, and is the body correctly formed for
the particular species?
 Do all of the merchant’s fish appear to be in good health, or just a few?
 Has the dealer shown honesty by turning the lights off or putting a sign
on sick tanks to indicate diseased fish — or is the store just selling fish
in bad condition?
The equipment
There are times when your equipment will wear out or fail, and you need to
replace it. Make sure that the dealers you choose have an adequate supply of
equipment and parts. Nothing is more frustrating than having to run from
store to store to find a simple piece of equipment such as a net, pump, or
filter. Make sure that your dealer has a wide selection on hand. If not, make
sure the shop can order needed supplies and get them in within a reasonable
amount of time.
128
Part II: Fish and How to Care for Them 

Chemicals and food
Does the shop have a good supply of chemicals, medicine, and foods avail-
able? You may not have time to wait for a dealer to order medications if your
fish are really ill — it’s much better to have it available when an emergency
arises. Check to see if the store carries a wide selection of frozen foods as
well as food for fish with special or unique dietary needs.
Dealer Practices: the Good, the Bad, 
and the Ugly
We classify dealers into good dealers (Do Bees), bad dealers (Don’t Bees), and
ugly dealers (Wanna Bees). We have seen all types during our years in the
aquarium hobby. All we can do is give you a little personal advice as to what
to look for when you are trying to determine who is the good guy and who is
the bad guy. We cannot stress this enough, because if you do not have a good
place to purchase fish and aquarium equipment, you may become frustrated
with fighting a continual uphill battle to maintain successful aquariums.
Do Bee dealers
A Do Bee dealer helps you find success. Some of the signs of a good retailer are
 Friendly, helpful, knowledgeable staff members who answer your ques-
tions willingly, go out of their way to help, and who are familiar with
aquarium equipment, the different types of aquarium systems, and indi-
vidual species of fish.
 A large selection of aquarium equipment, food, medication, and fish on
hand — they carry more than one or two brands.
 Free services, such as water testing.
 Some type of guarantee on the fish they sell and the commitment to
stand behind the equipment that they sell. A really good Do Bee offers
free repair service on basic equipment that they have sold to you.
 A willingness to tell you where you can get a certain species or piece of
equipment if they cannot get it themselves. This includes offering com-
petitors’ phone numbers.
 Autopsies of dead fish to help determine the cause of the disease (if the
dealer has qualified staff) and medication advice to help prevent the
need for an autopsy.
129
Chapter 9: Purchasing Your Fish

 A genuine interest in you and your aquariums.
 Clean tanks and shops.
Don’t Bee dealers
Don’t Bee dealers own aquarium shops you want to avoid. They are really
quite easy to spot when you recognize the symptoms of their “I have no busi-
ness being in the tropical fish trade because I don’t really care about my job,
or I am just in it for the money” disease. Avoid these dealers at all costs!
You can recognize Don’t Bees by the following characteristics:
 They’re willing to tell you to take a hike if you question the quality of
their service or livestock.
 They let you stand around without offering to help you find what you are
looking for.
 They spend a lot of time answering phone calls and leave you waiting for
service until they finish yacking.
 They try to give you a snow job if you ask them a question they don’t
have an answer for.
 They try to sell you a bunch of junk you don’t need because they believe
that you don’t know any better.
 They sell fish they know are diseased just to get rid of them.
 They use the same net to capture fish in all their tanks without steriliz-
ing it between uses.
 They have dirty aquariums and a filthy shop.
 They sell you fish that are not compatible just to make a few extra bucks
(which they obviously they don’t spend on the upkeep of the shop).
 They refuse to go out of their way to order any special equipment or fish
for you.
 They don’t keep regular store hours and show up whenever they happen
to feel like it.
 They are extremely rough with the fish when bagging them up for 
transport.
Wanna Bee dealers
A Wanna Bee dealer is the owner of a pet shop that appears overnight and dis-
appears within a few months because she didn’t have the proper finances to
130
Part II: Fish and How to Care for Them 

keep it afloat long enough to establish itself. These dealers sell you poor qual-
ity fish and equipment at inexpensive prices to get some money coming in and
then simply fall off the face of the earth. If a new shop opens up and you are
unsure as to whether you should purchase fish from the new owners, simply
wait a few months to see if it stays open. During this time, keep your ear out
for information from other customers concerning the quality of the shop.
Developing a Good Relationship 
with Your Fish Dealer
After you make your final decision and pledge your loyalty to a couple of
dealers, try to become acquainted with as many of the employees in the shop
as possible. Go out of your way to meet the owner or store manager, who can
likely help you with any serious problems you may have.
A great majority of dealers are very enthusiastic when given the opportunity
to work with regular customers. After the initial conversation, your aquar-
ium, ideas, or wishes may become as familiar to them as their own personal
tanks. Many merchants beam proudly at a customer’s first successful aquar-
ium setup (after all, the merchant helped create it). A caring vendor also
mourns with you at the loss of your favorite fish. A vendor who can’t remem-
ber your name after you have been buying from their shop for months proba-
bly should be avoided.
Making the effort required to solidify a personal relationship with your local
dealer puts you in good position to receive quality advice and the highest
degree of comprehensive service available. When a merchant is familiar with
you, the type of systems you own, your special interests, and other personal
aquarium specifications, he has a better opportunity to help you become a
successful hobbyist.
Selecting Healthy Fish
Now, whether you find a good dealer or not, you still need to take responsibil-
ity for choosing the healthiest fish possible. Starting off with diseased fish is
the quickest way we know to lose interest in the hobby. You always take a
risk when you purchase a live animal because unseen problems may manifest
later on, but you can improve the odds of success by starting off with the
healthiest fish possible.
131
Chapter 9: Purchasing Your Fish

Don’t buy the first fish off the boat
Avoid buying any new arrivals your dealer recently received. If the fish are
still in a packing crate, that should give you a clue. You should see a large
number of bags containing fish floating in the aquariums on the days the
store receives new shipments. Most dealers receive new fish on one or two
specific days each week. Ask your dealer which days these are. A good dealer
doesn’t allow customers to purchase fish until she’s had sufficient time to
quarantine them. This quarantine period reduces the fish’s stress from ship-
ping and allows the shop’s personnel to treat any disease that shows up in
the first few days after arrival.
If you happen to see some fish that really catch your eye while they are still
in the bags, ask the dealer to hold them for you until a reasonable quarantine
period has expired. Most dealers willingly agree to do that. Helpful merchants
who take the time to grant such simple requests to provide customer satis-
faction are definitely worth patronizing in the future. Stop for a moment and
ask yourself one simple question: If I owned this fish shop, would I do this for
my customer? If the answer is yes, then you should expect your dealer to do
the same thing.
Don’t be Doctor Doolittle
Never allow anyone, including your dealer, to talk you into buying a sick or
ailing fish in the honorable but mistaken belief that you can quickly nurse it
back to vibrant health. This is one of the biggest mistakes a beginning hobby-
ist can make. We have purchased fish that we wanted to save from destruc-
tion, but were not novices at the time. We saved these fish with round-the-
clock care, but a lot of experience is usually required to get the job done.
(The ones we did save, however, quickly became our favorite pets.)
Playing Florence Nightingale for aquatic pets only works when you have the
proper knowledge and equipment to pull it off. Diseased fish can cause water
problems and infect your other fish as well. Don’t buy any fish from tanks
that the dealer is currently medicating, because diseases can spread to your
other fish.
If you notice dead fish floating in a healthy-looking tank, avoid buying any of
the livestock from that same aquarium. Do not purchase a fish with an unusu-
ally humped back (unless normal for the species) — as this generally indi-
cates old age. A good dealer never allows a customer to purchase old, dying,
or diseased fish, but instead tells you that certain fish are being medicated
and are not for sale until the condition clears up.
132
Part II: Fish and How to Care for Them 

Just because a fish has been medicated does not mean that it is completely
well again. Let your eye be the best judge; carefully inspect any fish for signs
of disease, such as torn or clamped fins, white spots or growths, or irregu-
larly shaped bodies.
Start simply
If you are new to the hobby, never buy hard-to-maintain and feed species of
fish such as piranhas, pacus, or oscars.. Fish that have special dietary
requirements may be too much to handle in the beginning when you are still
trying to get the hang of how your equipment works. Wait until you are com-
pletely familiar with your system before trying your luck with the harder-to-
maintain species of tropical fish.
Go with what you know
Do not buy fish that are completely unfamiliar. Just because you are browsing
the store and happen to a see a cool-looking fish doesn’t mean you should
take it home. Some species can be very difficult to feed and require strict
water conditions to survive. Leave them in the hands of the pros to avoid
heartache. Fish marked as “hardy” (guppies, platys, and swordfish, for exam-
ple) are easier to keep for beginners. If you do want to try a more difficult to
keep species, make sure you do your research (via Internet sites dedicated to
particular species and talking to experienced hobbyists and pet store person-
nel who keep that type of fish) before buying so that you know exactly what
that fish will require to flourish.
Look for signs of good health
You can look at several physical characteristics to determine whether your
fish are in good health. There is never a guarantee of complete success, but if
you follow these rules, you increase your chances of getting a healthy speci-
men. Look for the following:
 Body color is rich, not faded or dull. The color should be complete and
not missing in any areas (unless it is typical for the species).
 There are no open sores, visible ulcers, boils, or obvious skin problems,
such as peeling scales or blemishes.
133
Chapter 9: Purchasing Your Fish

 Fins are long and flowing, or short and erect. The fish should not have
any ragged, torn, or missing fins.
 Scales are flat and smooth, not protruding away from the body.
 The stomach is well rounded, not sunken or concave.
 Girth of the entire body is of normal size, not bloated or emaciated.
 Visible excreta (fish waste) should be dark in color, not pale.
 All the fins on the fish’s body should not be collapsed or completely
clamped shut.
 Eyes are clear, not cloudy or popping out of the sockets.
 No visible parasites, such as ich or velvet.
Know your fish’s behavior
A few behavioral characteristics (how the fish acts) are worth taking a look
at. Healthy fish should 
 Swim in a horizontal motion, not with its head up or down.
 Swim with complete ease, not continually fight to stay afloat.
 Swim throughout the aquarium, not lurk in the corners or hiding behind
decorations.
 Breathe normally, not gulp for air or hang around the top of the tank
with its mouth gasping the top of the water.
Getting the Right Fish
To be a successful hobbyist, you need to understand your purchases. What
we mean by that is that you need to know which fish are best for you. By
now, you know how to spot a healthy fish, but there’s more to it than that.
You also need to pick fish that are compatible and won’t tear each other to
bits and turn your aquarium into a war zone. Making a shopping list and
understanding a fish’s ultimate size are two ways that you can avoid disaster.
Here are a couple good charts to get you started:
134
Part II: Fish and How to Care for Them 

 www.liveaquaria.com/general/fwcompatibility_chart.cfm
 www.ratemyfishtank.com/freshwater_compatibility_tool.php
When you go to purchase your fish, take paper and pen with you and write
down the names of all the fish that appeal to you. By writing down the names
of the fish, you don’t have to remember names (scientific names and even
common names can be a little confusing at times) and can go back and find
certain tanks quite easily. This can be a real advantage if the shop has several
hundred display tanks. When you finish your list, locate your dealer and
check to see whether all the species you chose are compatible with each
other, don’t have unique dietary needs, and don’t have special aquarium
requirements.
Keep an eye out for other compatibility issues. For example, if you buy a con-
vict cichlid and a guppy, you will probably find the convict alone and well fed
in the morning.
Quick reminders:
 Many shops have little stickers or labels to tell you which species are
compatible and which are not. But not all fish stores offer the customer
this courtesy.
 Leave difficult species in the expert hands of experienced hobbyists
who know how to take care of them properly. Start simple so you won’t
be disappointed.
 A reputable dealer can answer all your questions about aquarium
requirements and compatibility as well as offer pertinent suggestions of
his own as to which species may be more successful for a beginner.
 Have an idea about what type of fish you want to keep before you go, so
that you are not talked into getting something you don’t want.
 Don’t be afraid to order fish and supplies from Web sites if you can’t find
what you need locally. Good Web sites offer great deals, a great selec-
tion, and good service.
 Make sure you get and keep receipts for everything you purchase just in
case you need to return equipment or you are sold sick fish.

Part II: Fish and How to Care for Them 
How did this fish get so big so fast?
The problem with many of the fish you see in pet
stores is that they may be still in their juvenile
stage of growth and have not yet reached
mature adulthood. For example, we were at the
pet shop the other day and saw a 2-inch pacu.
It was so cute! But this fish can grow to lengths
of 10 inches or more, leaving smaller tankmates
to end up as Sunday buffet.
If you have any doubts, consult your local dealer.
Larger fish are great for some hobbyists, but
they do tend to limit your aquarium space and
your choices of other tankmates. Here is a list of
average sizes for many fish in home aquariums:
Platy 1.25”
Tiger barb 1.0”
Black moor 3.0”
Swordtails 2.0”
Dwarf gourami 1.5”
Cory 1.0–2.0”
Pleco 2.0–12.0”
Red serape tetra .05–1.0”
Neon tetra .05”
Black molly 1.25”
Yellow rainbowfish 2.0”
Pacu 5.0–35.0”

Chapter 10
Diet and Nutrition
for Your Wet Pets
In This Chapter
 Knowing your fish’s nutritional needs
 Understanding food types
 Feeding the kiddies
Just like their human counterparts, your aquatic pets need proper nutri-
tion so that they can remain active and healthy and live long lives. A
proper diet can be found by using most manufactured fish foods, but you can
also increase your fish’s good health by providing a variety of fresh vegeta-
bles and other products.
Basic Nutrition
Unfortunately, you can’t feed your fish the cheeseburger, fries, and apple pie
that keeps many kids happy, so you have to supply other types of food to
meet their dietary needs. Fortunately, you can combine many good nutrition
sources to form a proper diet for your fish. Aquarium food can be quite
varied and includes brine shrimp, dry flake, fresh shrimp, algae, daphnia,
pellets, algae wafers, tubifex worms, and beef heart — to name just a few
choices. These foods are all good sources of nutrition, but only if they are
distributed in proper amounts. Tossing an entire beef heart into the tank for
your guppy’s breakfast doesn’t cut it.
When purchasing any type of aquarium food, the most important rule is to
select the finest quality your finances can handle. Aquarium foods are not
really that expensive when you look at the total amount of food you get for
the price, so why not purchase the best? Top-quality commercial foods are
enriched with vitamins and minerals and help keep your fish in optimal
health. Low-grade food promotes poor health and disease.

138
Part II: Fish and How to Care for Them 
Feeding your fish can be a really relaxing activity and also provides an excel-
lent opportunity for you to check them for any signs of illness. What’s more
entertaining than observing a bunch of animals pigging out? Watching your
aquatic pets interact socially (pushing each other out of the way, stealing
food from each other, hoarding the choicest items, turning their noses up at
others) can be very educational. If you’re like us, you probably see the same
thing at your own dinner table. At least you don’t have to cook for your fish.
What your fish need
What you feed your fish should contain the following components:
 Carbohydrates: These provide energy for your fish and also help them
resist disease. 
 Proteins: These help your fish build strong muscle and tissue. Fish
obtain proteins through a diet that includes meat, fish, insects, and man-
ufactured foods. Proteins are an important factor in promoting physical
growth, so it is important to remember that younger fish need a little
more than full-grown adults.
 Vitamins: These are vital to your fish’s good health. A balanced diet that
combines live and processed foods easily supplies the necessary vita-
mins. A balanced diet includes vitamin A (egg, greens, crustaceans),
vitamin B (fish, greens, algae, and beef), vitamin C (algae), vitamin D
(worms, algae, shrimp), vitamin E (egg, algae), vitamin H (egg, liver),
and vitamin K (liver, greens).
Experienced hobbyists realize that feeding their aquatic pets can be an art in
itself (especially if you own an overgrown piranha). With so many different
natural and prepared foods to choose from, not only in fish shops but on the
Internet as well, beginning hobbyists can easily get confused about nutri-
tional issues. Just remember that no one product can satisfy every fish in
your aquarium. Variety is always good. But as this chapter shows you, learn-
ing to feed your fish properly is not as hard as it first seems. A little experi-
ence and practice can make all the difference in the world.
Overfeeding
You want to make sure that your tropical fish receive all the nutrition they
need. However, it is easy to make mistakes until you get the hang of a new
feeding routine. Many new hobbyists tend to overfeed their fish. Overfeeding
can lead to obesity and other health problems. If your fish resemble overin-
flated tires, cut back on the grub. Too much food in an aquarium tank can
also build up and foul the water or increase the risk of disease.

Excess food around the edge of the substrate is one sign of overfeeding. This
wasted food accumulates on the bottom of the tank, turns muddy brown, and
begins to spoil. Spoiled food can cause health problems for your fish if they
happen to eat it. If excess food piles up, decrease the amount you feed and
try putting the food in a different area of the aquarium.
Remember that your fish’s stomach is no larger than its eye. So, if you dump
a half a can of fish food into the tank, you had better hope your fish has an
eye the size of a dinner plate; otherwise, you’re in for a few problems. Excess
food breaking down on the substrate surface can cause an overabundance of
harmful ammonia. If you do happen to overfeed, remove the excess with a
standard aquarium vacuum.
Underfeeding
Because so much emphasis is placed on overfeeding and its polluting effects,
many hobbyists don’t feed their fish enough. Well, the point is, don’t over-
feed or underfeed. Feed the correct amount.
Just-right feeding
The general rule is to feed only what your fish can eat in a period of three to
five minutes per feeding. Now, this does not mean that you have to stand
around with a starter’s whistle and stopwatch at every meal. Just check to
make sure that your fish polish off all the food within five minutes. Another
option is to purchase a plastic feeding ring that keeps most dry foods con-
fined to a small area on top of the water. A feeding ring can keep most of the
food from quickly falling to the bottom of the tank.
If at all possible, feed adult fish three small meals per day instead of just
dumping a bunch of food in at one time. Juvenile fish and fry need be fed
more often to insure that they grow properly, so give them a couple of extra
light feedings each day.
It’s best to feed your fish at different times of the day, usually morning, after-
noon, and night. Because many nocturnal fish feed only at night, make sure
they receive their fair share.
It’s not a bad idea to make your fish fast one day a week. Going 24 hours with-
out food keeps a fish’s dietary tract in good physical condition.
139
Chapter 10: Diet and Nutrition for Your Wet Pets

What Type of Eater Do You Have?
One reason many aquarium species face starvation and poor health is
because hobbyists who are unfamiliar with a particular species fail to pro-
vide the proper nutrition for individual needs. If you take the time to do a
little research into a fish’s natural habitat and feeding patterns, you gain a
better understanding of their individual dietary requirements.
For example, danios need to be fed often because they have high metabolism
rates. Their high activity level burns off food quickly. If you have a very clean
system, there may not be adequate amounts of natural foods, such as algae,
to provide the fish with something to tide them over until their next sched-
uled feeding. Give danios an extra feeding every day. Here are a few examples
of how some species eat (remember, this may vary slightly depending on the
age and temperament of your fish):
 Heavy eaters: tiger barb, swordtail, oscar, convict cichlid
 Medium eaters: guppy, gouramis, angelfish, cory
 Light eaters: balloon mollies, bubble eye goldfish, betta, pencilfish
Never feed your fish cat food, dog food, or other types of animal feeds. Non-
fish manufactured pet food is difficult for your fish to digest properly, and it
doesn’t provide the essential amino acids and nutrients they really need.
140
Part II: Fish and How to Care for Them 
Vacations and automatic feeders
When you go on vacation, try to find a trustwor-
thy person to feed your fish while you’re away.
A relative or mature neighborhood kid is usually
a good choice. To make sure that they feed your
fish properly, place individual servings in plas-
tic bags so that your substitute knows exactly
what to put into each tank. This may sound like
a hassle, but it’s better than returning home to
find your prize goldfish, the size of a basketball,
beached on a mountain of uneaten food.
Another option is to purchase an automatic
feeder from your local fish shop. These units
automatically dispense a certain amount of food
(you can choose the amount) at daily intervals
that you preset. Models can be purchased that
hang on the aquarium rim, whereas others are
free standing. Dispensers run on either batter-
ies or AC power, and some models offer both
options. Automatic feeders are a great way to
feed your aquatic pets the proper amount of
food regularly.
Never add a bunch of extra food to the tank
before going on vacation. Your fish won’t eat the
extra food before it starts rotting, and by the
time you get home you may have a serious
water problem.

Just like people, fish can be good eaters or bad eaters. The following hints
will help persuade those fish that don’t want to jump on the scheduled feed-
ing bandwagon.
When they stop eating
There are times when your fish simply stop eating. After you panic, stop and
ask yourself this question: What caused this sudden lack of appetite? Here
are some possible answers:
 Incorrect food: When your fish stop eating, the first thing to do is to
make sure that you’re giving them the correct food for their species. For
example, large goldfish need pellet foods that float. If you are only feed-
ing them algae discs, they will not thrive. On the other hand, bottom-
feeding catfish would appreciate the same disc. Top feeders like danios
do best on floating and flake foods. If you’re feeding them the wrong
thing, switch to the proper food immediately. If the problem persists,
read on for other causes.
 Crowded conditions: Overcrowding causes stress and encourages
excessive competition for food. Normal eaters may become shy or
frightened and not get their share of the food.
 Disease: Fish stop eating regularly as they start to drop off physically.
 Poor water conditions: Polluted water and other bad aquarium condi-
tions can have a major effect on your fish’s normal feeding habits. Also
check the temperature and pH and nitrate levels (see Chapter 14 for
more information on this subject) if your fish suddenly stop feeding.
 Temperature or weather changes: Hotter weather may mean a decrease
in oxygen in the aquarium’s water. If this is a problem, add an extra air-
stone (to split the air into smaller bubbles) or install a power head (which
you can purchase at your local pet shop) on your undergravel filter. You
will find more information on aquarium equipment in Chapter 6.
So remember, the fact that your fish are not eating may not be caused by
improper feeding conditions. You need to take other factors into considera-
tion as well.
Some fish refuse to eat just because they’re picky. There may be no other
reason than that. Try different types of food until you find one they are happy
with. 
141
Chapter 10: Diet and Nutrition for Your Wet Pets

Carnivores
Feed carnivores (meat eaters, such as piranha) small amounts of meat and
insects to help balance their flake or pellet diet. Carnivores need a good filtra-
tion system because they excrete a high amount of waste generated by the
meaty foods.
Vegetarians
Many freshwater fish need vegetable matter in their diet to flourish and
achieve proper growth. For example, most species of freshwater catfish and
cichlids enjoy vegetables. You can purchase vegetable fish food at your local
aquarium shop. Specific types of vegetable foods such as algae wafers are
manufactured to meet the needs of these types of fish.
If you feel creative, you can try preparing a vegetable supplement at home. You
can boil lettuce and spinach leaves until they are soft and then put them on a
special feeding clip (available at your local fish store), which holds them at the
top of the tank. This clip is similar in design to a clothespin but wider. Chopped
up small pieces of potato, fresh peas, and zucchini are also a welcome treat for
almost any type of fish if they are slightly cooked to soften them.
If you give your fish fresh vegetables in this manner, make sure you remove
all the uneaten food at the end of each day. Fresh vegetables decay and foul
the water when left in the tank too long.
Fish that eat anything that 
falls into the tank
There are sociable (and gluttonous) fish that continually try to mooch food
by imitating a starving animal. (Nothing new there, our teenagers have that
routine down to a science.) These fish also try to eat anything that falls into
the tank, including pet food, sandwiches, toys, and your hand. Overfeeding
these fish can quickly become a problem, because they snag most of the food
before the other fish even realize that it’s chow time.
If you have a tank hog grabbing all the food, try feeding less food more fre-
quently, and spread the food to different parts of the tank.
142
Part II: Fish and How to Care for Them 

Types of Food
You have many types of foods to choose from in an aquarium shop. Most fish
eat just about anything. Most fish can survive on any type of aquarium food,
but that doesn’t mean they will live up to their full potential if they are fed
improperly. By combining different types of food, you can give your fish a
head start on good health.
In the artificial environment of an aquarium, you need to provide the pro-
teins, fats, vitamins, and carbohydrates that are a part of fish’s natural diet. If
you don’t, your fish won’t reach their full growth potential. Lack of proper
nutrition also makes them more susceptible to disease. Most foods supply
the essentials, but combining different products (such as flakes, cooked veg-
gies, and fresh strips of fish) can ensure your success.
Comparing prepackaged and frozen foods
Fish food manufacturers offer a wide variety of well-balanced foods that are
easy to use and store. 
Prepackaged dry foods generally contain most of the nutrients your fish need
to survive. You can purchase dry food in many forms, including flakes that
float on top of the water, disks that sink to the substrate for bottom-feeders,
and large pellets for koi and other types of pond fish. There are large-grained
foods for big fish, and small foods for tiny fish. You can drop tablet foods to
the bottom of the tank or stick them to the aquarium glass (using the afore-
mentioned food clip) at different levels to help ensure that the fish at all the
different feeding levels get their fair share. Pretty neat, huh? 
Flake foods are a good staple that can satisfy most of your fish. Your can pur-
chase flakes to meet the need of your particular species. For example, some
cichlid flakes contain high amounts of fat and protein for quick growth; gold-
fish flakes often contain garlic, which inhibits parasites, and the extra vegeta-
bles that are a natural part of the goldfish diet. Flakes generally float on or
near the water surface and sink as they become saturated. 
The moisture level in manufactured flakes should be less than 4 percent of
the total product, because many nutrients dissipate quickly in aquarium
water.
Floating pellets are made for surface feeders; bottom feeders, such as pond
fish, can gobble up sinking pellets. Granular foods sink quickly and are gener-
ally used to feed bottom-dwelling species.
143
Chapter 10: Diet and Nutrition for Your Wet Pets

Frozen foods are usually mixes of live food, such as brine shrimp, silversides,
bloodworms, daphnia, meat, or vegetables. You can purchase this type of
food in a variety of forms, such as sheets and cubes.
Little frozen cubes are a great way to keep an accurate account of exactly
how much you are feeding at every meal. You must keep frozen foods from
thawing before you need them because once they melt, they cannot be
refrozen without a major loss of nutrients. Also, melted brine makes your
house smell like a shrimp boat. Before feeding, take the frozen food and thaw
it in a small cup of dechlorinated water (tap water with dechlorinator added)
or bottled water. Dispersing the food in water allows the food to move
throughout the entire tank so that aggressive feeders don’t get a chance to
eat it all before the rest of their tankmates get any. 
Freeze-dried foods
Freeze-dried foods contain preserved small crustaceans, shrimp, larvae, and
worms. This is one type of food that fish seem to love or hate, so just keep a
little bit around for a treat or emergencies.
Spirulina
Spirulina is a natural micro-algae that is rich in proteins, helps enhance color,
and promote a healthy mucus layer on your fish’s skin. Adding spirulina to all
your fish’s diets gives them healthier fins and increases their resistance to
skin infections. You can usually purchase spirulina in both flake and frozen
form. Spirulina has a soft cell wall and can be digested quite easily. It con-
tains fatty acids that are important in proper development of the body’s
organs, and is also rich in A and B vitamins, iron, and calcium.
Research shows that most of a fish’s color comes from the food it eats.
Spirulina contains a high percentage of carotenoid pigments that give your
fish outstanding color. 
If you want the best of both worlds, you can purchase spirulina-enriched
brine shrimp. These are shrimp that have been fed on dry spirulina powder. 
144
Part II: Fish and How to Care for Them 

Live food — the stuff they really 
love and want
Very few aquarium shops carry live food, making it very difficult to find. Your
best bet for locating live food and the supplies to culture them is on the
Internet. Live food includes:
 Fortified brine shrimp
 Bloodworms
 Silversides
 Feeder guppies
 Feeder goldfish
To get you started, here are a few places on the Net that sell live fish foods:
 www.wormman.com/cat_fish.cfm
 http://aquaticfoods.com/Feedergoldfish.html
 www.livefoodcultures.com/babybrineshrimp.html
Feeder guppies and goldfish are usually to feed large carnivores such as pacu
and Jack Dempseys.
Some people balk at feeding their aquatic pets live fish, and you should do
what feels right for you. It may help to remember that live feeding just means
going along with the natural pecking order in nature’s food chain. Feeder
guppies and goldfish are raised in large hatcheries specifically for food
purposes — if no one bought them, they wouldn’t have existed at all. 
Certain live foods should not be introduced into your aquarium because they
may attack smaller fishes or fry. These predators include leeches, hydras,
beetles, and dragonfly larvae.
Brine shrimp
Brine shrimp (Artemia franciscana) are tiny saltwater crustaceans that are
appreciated by most fish (see Figure 10-1). Brine shrimp are available frozen,
though a few pet shops carry live brine.
145
Chapter 10: Diet and Nutrition for Your Wet Pets

If you want to raise your own live food, you can buy a kit at your local pet
store and hatch brine shrimp from dried eggs. These shrimp are usually fed
to marine fish, but freshwater fish appreciate them as a treat.
The only problem with hatching your own brine shrimp is the awful smell.
Try raising them in a garage or basement — otherwise, your family and
neighbors may move away without leaving a forwarding address.
One other important point about brine shrimp: Even though your aquatic
pets are in a captive environment, they still enjoy hunting live food. Survival
is an important instinct that cannot be removed by the presence of four glass
walls or by birth in a hatchery. Providing live foods keeps your fish more
healthy and active, too. Think about it: If you had to chase down your own
pig to snag a few pork chops for Saturday’s barbecue, you’d probably work
up a little bit of an appetite.
But along with the good comes the bad, as the old saying goes. Live foods
have a higher risk of transmitting disease into the tank than manufactured
products do. Live brine shrimp at your local fish shop are pretty safe; how-
ever, if you go out to a river or pond to collect live food, you run the risk of
introducing disease.

Part II: Fish and How to Care for Them 

Infusoria
Infusoria (paramecium and amoeba) are small animal protozoans that make
an excellent food for small, newborn fry. Infusoria are very tiny and form a
cloud when added to your aquarium water. Infusoria can be cultured at home
by soaking vegetable matter (such as a piece of lettuce) in a clear jar of water
placed in direct sunlight for at least a week. Check for infusoria when it
becomes cloudy by shining flashlight into the jar. The infusoria will appear as
small dust-like particles.
Rotifers
Rotifers are small invertebrates raised on farms. You can find the addresses
of these farms in most aquarium magazines, or try the Web sites mentioned
earlier in this chapter. 
Tubifex, bloodworms, mosquito larvae, 
and earthworms (yuck!)
We know these worms sound gross, but your fish will love them! You can pur-
chase freeze-dried tubifex and bloodworms in cubes or shredded form to use
as a treat periodically. They can cause digestive problems, so don’t feed them
to your fish regularly. Mosquito larvae provide good health and coloring for
show fish, but can be difficult to find. Fish readily accept earthworms, but
clean the worms thoroughly with water and chop them up before serving.
Feeding Fry
Young fry (baby fish) require a different type of diet than adults because their
digestion systems have not yet matured. The good news is that you can feed
many fry special foods available at your local fish shop. The bad news is that
young fry need to be fed constantly, so swing by the pharmacy on the way
home and grab some drops for your sleep-deprived eyes.

Microworms
Microworms (Anguillula silusiae) are non-parasitic worms that float freely in
water. These worms reproduce in a matter of days. 
You can easily culture microworms at home, and they make a good starter food
for young fry because of their tiny size. All you need to do is mix a little oat-
meal, yeast, and water in a bowl until it forms a paste. Add a small amount of
microworms to the paste from an existing culture (which you can purchase on
the Internet) and allow it to stand at room temperature for a couple of days.
When worms appear on the sides of the bowl, transfer them to the fry tank.
Liquid, powdered, and growth foods
You can purchase manufactured liquid fry food that comes in a tube that
resembles toothpaste. Use this product sparingly because it can foul the water.
Powdered food is used to feed newborn fish. The powder is too small to be
used as feed for adult fish, and will end up fouling your tank if not used for
baby fry.
Fish food manufacturers make a wide variety of foods to match the growth
stages of your young fish. Hikari makes a wonderful line of baby fish foods
which are made to fit the growth stages of fish.
Read the labels carefully to choose the correct product for the age of your
developing fry if purchasing from a pet store.

f you want your fish to live long and healthy lives, then you need to make
sure that they remain as disease free as possible. Many factors, including
stress, bacteria, fungus, parasites, chemicals, and poor water conditions, can
cause disease. By monitoring your water conditions daily and checking your
fish for signs of disease, you can stay ahead of the game and keep your
aquatic pets in prime condition.
An Ounce of Prevention . . .
. . . is worth a pound of cure, right? Preventing disease is generally the best
way to battle physical problems. Sounds simple doesn’t it? It is. You can pro-
vide optimal living conditions for your tropical fish simply by following a few
simple maintenance routines.
Keeping abreast of the water and equipment conditions in your aquarium,
which takes only a few moments a day, gives you a safety margin to quickly
correct any problems that show up. The schedule suggested here gives you a
few pointers on watching for signs of disease and other problems such as
equipment malfunction.

150
Part II: Fish and How to Care for Them 
Daily measures
Maintaining the following daily routine is not as difficult as it sounds. It takes
only a few minutes a day, and after a week or so, it will become second nature —
just like grabbing a midnight snack while your spouse is asleep.
Check the equipment
It is very important to make sure that all mechanical equipment is function-
ing properly each and every day. Are the filter systems putting out the opti-
mal flow that the manufacturer suggests? Is the water flowing smoothly, or is
it running too slow? If the water seems to have slowed down to the point
where it resembles a still life painting, check to see whether the filter and
tubes are clogged and make sure that the motor is not wearing down (water
flow is slow or the filter is making noise).
Many filter motors can be rebuilt with parts supplied by the manufacturing
company that produced the product. If the filter pads are clogged or
extremely dirty, replace them or rinse them gently under water until they’re
clean. The only real disadvantage to replacing or washing filters is losing the
biological bacteria that lives on the pads.
Are the air pumps in your aquarium in prime working condition? Carefully
inspect them to make sure that they are running properly and not overheat-
ing. If the pumps are not putting out enough air to run the extra equipment
and decorations efficiently (you’ll know when the little plastic diver turns
blue and keels over), you can usually rebuild them by replacing worn
diaphragms with parts you special order at your local fish shop. If your local
dealer cannot find the parts for you, take a couple of aspirin, then call the
manufacturer or check out its Web site to find the parts you need. If the
pump is very old and no parts are available, it’s probably time to purchase a
new one.
Check the water temperature
Monitoring water temperature is another important part of your daily rou-
tine. Any fluctuation in temperature more than two degrees from the norm
can quickly lead to serious health problems. If the temperature is not within
correct range (your fish are either floating around in the center of an ice cube
or have melted into a blob), check to make sure that your heater is not stuck
in the on or off position. 
Always measure the water temperature at the same time each day to get the
most accurate readings. Replace any faulty heaters immediately and install a
heater that contains an internal regulator if your finances allow. An internal
regulator lets the heater turn itself on and off automatically to maintain a set
temperature.

One common cause of overheated aquarium water is excess natural or artifi-
cial lighting. Check the amount of natural sunlight the tank receives every
day. If too much natural light is causing the temperature to rise during peak
sunlight hours, then you need to move the tank, block out the light with a
thicker or darker background, or cover the windows with heavy drapes or
shades.
The duration and intensity of artificial lighting can be a problem as well. If a
light is constantly overheating your tank, switch to a lower wattage bulb or
leave the light off longer. Otherwise, your pets may end up looking like float-
ing fish sticks.
Check the fish
After you get up in the morning and choke down a few dozen cups of coffee,
make a quick inventory of all the fish in your aquarium. If any fish are dead,
remove them from the tank and take them to the bathroom for the final flush.
Rotting fish can cause serious biological problems and upset the tank’s balance.
If any fish seem to be sick or diseased, immediately transfer them to your
hospital tank (we explain setting up a hospital tank at the end of this chapter)
and begin treatment. If you check the health of your fish daily, you can take
care of problems before they get out of control.
Check the overall health of your fish very carefully. Take a close look at their
physical condition. Are they swimming normally, or consistently lurking in
the corners of the tank? Are their eyes bright and alert, or clouded over? Are
their fins erect, or clamped shut and drooping? Do they have a straight spine,
or do they look like Quasimodo? Do their bodies have normal, well-rounded
proportions, or are their stomachs swollen or sunken? If you can visually
identify physical problems, you need to check the aquarium’s water and
equipment.
Weekly measures
Weekly routines are just like daily maintenance. Choose one day per week to
carry out the following tasks.
Check the water
Change at least 15 percent of the water in your aquariums every week. Many
large new filter systems and chemicals claim that you never need to change
any water ever again if you purchase and use that product. Nevertheless,
water changes are a good way to keep the water stable.
151
Chapter 11: Diseases and Treatments

Cure-all equipment and medications pose a real danger to your fish. When
you stray down untried paths instead of using the standard, proven road that
you know leads you where you want to be, you run a serious risk of losing
your fish.
The water in a fish’s natural environment is constantly replaced by seasonal
rains, tidal flow, and run-off. But in aquariums, the same water remains in the
tank between water changes. Take a moment and pretend that the water in
your aquarium is your only drinking supply for the entire day. Would you be
comfortable drinking it? Remember, your aquatic pets have to live in it 24
hours a day.
Carefully check your pH and nitrate levels with a test kit each week to make
sure that they remain within the range required by your species of fish. If
they are not correct, you can slowly change your pH by water changes or
chemicals if your tap pH does not match your species (pH should be kept
within 2.0 of the required pH).
If chemical tests indicate that your nitrate levels are too high, the best way to
fix the problem is to change 20 percent of the water daily until the nitrate
levels return to normal. Don’t forget to check your aquarium conditions, so
that you can identify and correct whatever is causing your nitrate levels to
soar higher than the national debt. A few causes of high nitrates include poor
filtration, overcrowding, lack of water changes, and chronic overfeeding.
While you are doing your weekly maintenance routine, take time to siphon off
any accumulated debris on the substrate’s surface area by using a simple
gravel cleaner or aquarium vacuum (see Chapter 6). Remove any dead vege-
tation such as decaying plant leaves from the tank. This type of living debris
can quickly cause a large fluctuation in the water’s nitrate levels. If you need
to use searchlights to locate the gravel in your tank, then the water needs to
be cleaned.
Make the fish fast
Ideally, your aquatic pets should fast (that is, not be given any food for 24
hours) at least one day per week. We know this may seem difficult and harsh
at first, but avoid the temptation to give them treats such as cinnamon rolls
and donuts because you feel sorry for them. Fasting often happens in the
wild and it helps clean out your fish’s digestive systems and guards against
constipation problems. Remember to fast your fish on the same day each
week, so they don’t go too long between feedings.
Give medications
Take a close look at all the medications you use for common illnesses such as
ich and fungus and make sure you have all the standard treatments (see later
in this chapter for more). Is there enough dechlorinator (which removes
152
Part II: Fish and How to Care for Them 

chlorine from your tap water) in your home to make daily water changes if
they become necessary? Have you sterilized your hospital tank since its last
use? Is it ready? Being prepared can make all the difference between saving
your wet pets and losing them.
Monthly measures
Monthly chores are much easier to remember if you mark them down on a
calendar. Or you can simply tack a reminder note up on the fridge.
Replace all filter mediums that contain carbon. Carbon loses its effectiveness
after a period of time. If your filter isn’t carbon-based, gently rinse it under
water to remove debris. Don’t use hot water for this task, as excessive heat
can destroy the entire beneficial bacteria colony living on the filter.
Clean all algae from the glass so that your fish won’t think they’ve gone blind.
Common Ailments and Cures
The list of common tropical fish illnesses in this section gives you general
guidelines for identifying and treating various diseases (Figure 11-1). Keep in
mind that several common medications and salt treatments may be detrimen-
tal to live plants, some species of catfish, and other delicate or sensitive trop-
ical fish. It is always best to treat sick fish in a hospital tank, away from the
main population.
153
Chapter 11: Diseases and Treatments
How stress leads to disease
In your home aquarium, your fish live in an
enclosed ecosystem that is very different from
and slightly imbalanced compared to the nat-
ural stability of their native environment. The
majority of health problems tropical fish experi-
ence are the direct result of stress, which is
often caused by being moved around and by
poor environmental conditions when they are
placed in a home aquarium.
Your fish are capable of carrying all types of dis-
eases that generally are not a threat to their
everyday health. These diseases usually remain
dormant until your aquatic pets are weakened
by fluctuating environmental factors such as
unstable temperature and pH, dirty water, and
poor diet. When environmental stability prob-
lems occur, your fish’s latent disease can man-
ifest quickly and cause health problems. Sick
fish can be a real bummer, but this chapter
helps you overcome most fishy health problems.

Common bacteria infection
Symptoms: Blood spots; open sores; ulcers; frayed fins.
Cause: Aeromonas.
Treatment: Antibiotics.
Constipation
Symptoms: Reduced appetite; little or no feces; swollen stomach; inactivity. 
(If your fish haven’t left the gravel for over a month, they may be constipated.)
Cause: Incorrect nutrition; overfeeding.
Treatment: Add 1 teaspoon of magnesium sulfate for every 2 gallons of water.
Fast your constipated fish for several days. Improve your fish’s diet by feed-
ing live foods frequently.

Part II: Fish and How to Care for Them 

Dropsy
Symptoms: Swollen body; protruding scales; fish looks like a pincushion.
Cause: Organ failure from cancer and old age, or poor water conditions.
Treatment: Antibacterial given through medicated food. Improvement of
water quality through water changes also provides a little relief to afflicted
fish. Complete recovery from dropsy is rare.
Fin rot
Symptoms: Reddened or inflamed rays; torn, choppy, ragged, or disinte-
grated fins. Your fish may look like it just swam through an electrical fan.
Cause: Fin rot is a highly contagious bacterial infection that, in its advanced
stages, can completely erode the fins and tail all the way down to the body.
Bad water quality and fin injuries are usually the main causes of this disease.
Fin rot is frequently followed up with a secondary fungal infection.
Treatment: Spot treat infected areas with gentian violet and use proprietary
medication (a treatment that is labled for one particular disease, such as
fungus cure, ich cure, and so on). Add 1 tablespoon of aquarium or marine
salt for each 5 gallons of water. Remove activated carbon from all filters
during the medication period. Frequent water changes are necessary to help
improve water conditions.
Fish louse
Symptoms: Disk-shaped parasites attach to the skin. Ulcers often develop
close to the area of parasitic attachment. Bacteria or fungus problems may
follow after.
Cause: Crustacean parasite. After feeding on the skin, the adult parasite
leaves its host and lays gelatinlike capsules full of eggs on the substrate and
aquarium decorations. Often the eggs don’t hatch until the aquarium temper-
ature rises, and may stay in the tank for extended periods of time.
Treatment: Remove all parasites from the afflicted fish using a small pair of
tweezers. Dab any wounds using a cotton swab dipped in commercial
155
Chapter 11: Diseases and Treatments

Mercurochrome. Remove water from the main tank and sterilize all decora-
tions and substrate. In other words, start over.
Freshwater velvet
Symptoms: A golden-velvet or grayish-white coating on the body or fins. If
your fish has velvet, it looks like it has been sprinkled with gold dust. This
disease is very common among certain species such as bettas.
Cause: Piscinoodinium parasite. The adult parasites attach themselves to the
skin of tropical fish and then fall off after seven days or so. These parasites
immediately drop into the substrate and begin to multiply. The new parasites
are then released into the water and move around until they re-infect the fish
in your aquarium. If the parasites cannot find a living host within a period of
two to three days, they die.
Treatment: Proprietary malachite green remedy. Add 1 tablespoon of aquar-
ium salt for each 5 gallons of water.
Freshwater ich
Symptoms: The sudden appearance of small white spots, which look like little
grains of table salt, on the body and fins. Fish infected with this disease con-
tinually scratch themselves on gravel and decorations during the advanced
stages. (If your fish look like they are making love to the rocks in the tank,
they probably have ich.)
Cause: Ichthyopthirius parasite. Adult parasites fall off of the host and multi-
ply in the substrate. Soon after, new parasites search for another living host.
Treatment: Proprietary ich remedy (formalin or malachite green). Even if you
remove the infected fish to a quarantine tank, you must still treat the aquar-
ium water in the main tank with medication to kill off any remaining free-
swimming parasites.
156
Part II: Fish and How to Care for Them 

Fungus
Symptoms: White growths on the body or fins that are fluffy in appearance
and make your fish look like a cotton puff or marshmallow.
Cause: Fungus often attacks regions where the mucus or slime coating on the
fish has worn off due to damage by injury or parasites. Once the slime coat is
damaged, the fish is more susceptible to all types of other disease.
Treatment: Spot treat with gentian violet, methylene blue, or use aquarium
fungicide in extreme cases.
Gill parasites
Symptoms: Redness in the gill areas; labored respiration; scratching; exces-
sive mucus coat; glazed eyes; inflamed gills; loss of motor control (your fish
resemble slam dancers).
Cause: Flukes (Dactylogyrus).
Treatment: Sterazin or other proprietary treatment. Formalin baths can be
effective as well.
Hole in the head
Symptoms: Pus-filled holes on the head, near the lateral line or the base of
the tail. This disease is most common among cichlids.
Cause: Hexamita parasite.
Treatment: Flagyl. Recent findings show that Vitamin A and C supplements
are effective in treating this disease (aquatic vitamins, not Flintstones
Chewables).
157
Chapter 11: Diseases and Treatments

Intestinal parasites
Symptoms: Worms sticking out through the vent; emaciation of the body.
Cause: Several different varieties of intestinal worms.
Treatment: Standard fungus cure or in advanced cases, veterinarian-prescribed
anthelminthic added to the daily diet. Add 1 tablespoon of aquarium salt for
each 5 gallons of water to help your fish with normal body fluid functions.
Remove any activated carbon during treatment. Change 15 percent of the
water daily to keep environmental conditions optimal.
Large skin parasites
Symptoms: Scratching; visible parasites.
Cause: Fish lice (argulus) and anchorworms (Lernaea).
Treatment: Remove large parasites with tweezers. Apply an antiseptic solu-
tion to the injured site.
Mouth fungus
Symptoms: White cottonlike growths around the mouth area (your fish looks
like Santa Claus having a bad hair day) or patchy white skin in the same
region. In advanced stages, the jawbones begin to deteriorate badly.
Cause: Usually flexibacter, which follows after other infections have begun.
Treatment: Proprietary fungus treatment or methylene blue in the early
stages. If this treatment is not effective and the fungus is out of control, con-
sult your veterinarian about antibiotics immediately.
Pop-eye
Symptoms: Eyes inflamed and protruding from their sockets to the point
where they almost “pop” out of the head. Often the fish’s eyes develop a
cloudy, whitish haze. Inflamed eye sockets are also common with this
disease.
158
Part II: Fish and How to Care for Them 

Cause: Parasites or poor water conditions.
Treatment: There are no known commercially packaged medications to treat
or cure this disease. The only thing you can do to help is to improve the
aquarium’s water conditions with frequent changes. It may also be beneficial
to add 1 tablespoon of aquarium salt per 5 gallons of water to help with
osmoregulation (the control of the levels of water and mineral salts in the
blood).
Check and adjust all water conditions (pH, ammonia, nitrites, and nitrates)
with test kits to make sure that they remain within proper ranges.
Septicemia
Symptoms: Redness at the base of the fins followed by blood streaks that
appear on the fins and body. Other symptoms include hemorrhage, loss of
appetite, and listlessness. This disease usually follows fin rot or skin infec-
tions. Septicemia often results in major heart damage and blood vessel prob-
lems. These complications can in turn lead to fluid leakage in the abdomen,
which in some cases causes dropsy.
Cause: Pseudomonas or streptococcus bacteria inflames body tissues made
susceptible by a skin infection.
Treatment: Antibacterial Furan2 or Triple Sulfa. Change the water every 24 to
36 hours.
Skin flukes
Symptoms: Inflamed skin; excessive mucus coating (your fish looks like it
was baptized in Vaseline); scratching.
Cause: Gyrodactylus.
Treatment: Proprietary medication with labeling recommending for skin
flukes.
159
Chapter 11: Diseases and Treatments

Slimy skin disease
Symptoms: Gray-colored slime on the body or fins; scratching; frayed fins;
excessive mucus coat; shimmying like a politician during questioning.
Cause: Costia, trichodina, cyclochaeta, or chilodonella parasites.
Treatment: Proprietary remedy of malachite green and frequent water
changes. Short-term (five-minute) formalin and salt baths can be effective.
Check and correct any poor water conditions.
Swim bladder disease
Symptoms: Abnormal or irregular swimming patterns (your fish do the
doggie paddle upside down) and complete loss of physical balance.
Cause: Bacterial infection; physical injury to the swim bladder from fighting;
breeding: netting; transportation from the dealer; poor water quality.
Treatment: Treat with an antibiotic in a clean, shallow tank. (The water
should be about 2 inches higher than the dorsal fin on the fish.) Carry out
water changes as frequently as once a day if possible.
Tuberculosis (TB)
Symptoms: Fin deterioration; a paling of body color; clamped fins (fins are
closed up or folded together); excessive weight loss; ulcers; and pop-eye.
Cause: A highly contagious bacterial disease caused by poor filtration or
overcrowding in the aquarium.
Many medical personnel believe that this disease can be transferred to
humans through contact with the infected areas on the fish.
Treatment: At this time, there is no known effective treatment of tuberculo-
sis, and in our opinion it is not worth risking your own health, or the health
of your family, to try treating infected fish. Use strict care when handling
these infected fish! Use plastic gloves when removing any fish infected with
tuberculosis. Any tropical fish that has this disease should be euthanized
immediately. Do not leave the TB-infected fish in the main aquarium because
other tankmates will probably eat it and may develop the disease shortly
thereafter.
160
Part II: Fish and How to Care for Them 

Frequent Causes of Disease
There are many causes of disease that are not related to parasites and infec-
tion, such as carbon dioxide poisoning, poor water quality, metal poisoning,
chemical poison, improper diet, overfeeding, and fright. These important
physical and social conditions should be monitored frequently. 
Carbon dioxide poisoning
Symptoms: Listlessness; increased or rapid respiration — your fish may hang
near the top of the water.
Cause: Lack of oxygen; too much carbon dioxide in the water.
Treatment: Add more aeration to improve gas exchange at the water surface;
cut down on plant fertilization; check and correct any poor water conditions;
and carry out frequent water changes.
Poor water quality
Symptoms: The first sign is that your tropical fish are gasping for air at the
water surface of the tank and are generally inactive. Clamped or closed fins,
overall bad health, and poor coloration are a few more symptoms of incor-
rect water quality.
Cause: Poor water quality due to infrequent water changes, poor filtration,
and overuse of standard chemicals.
Treatment: Make daily water changes until any high ammonia, nitrite, or
nitrate levels return to lower readings. Make sure the aquarium has enough
aeration and add an extra airstone or bubble disk if necessary. Make sure the
pH of the water is within the proper range (a couple degrees of what is
normal for the species).
Metal poisoning
Symptoms: Erratic behavior; paleness.
Cause: Metal objects coming into contact with the aquarium water.
161
Chapter 11: Diseases and Treatments

Treatment: A complete water change. To avoid accidentally poisoning your
tropical fish, never allow any metal to come in contact with the aquarium
water. Metal hoods and metal equipment clips are two common sources of
poisoning. To keep this equipment from poisoning your fish, use plastic clips
and make sure that the glass cover on your aquarium fits properly so that no
water comes into direct contact with the hood and light fixture.
Chemical poisoning
Symptoms: Erratic behavior; gasping for air; fish lying on their sides; pale-
ness; clamped fins; refusal to eat.
Cause: Other common sources of water poisoning in aquariums are cleaning,
cosmetic, and insect-control products. Never use insecticides, hair sprays, or
mist cleaners near your aquarium. Small drops of these airborne products
can easily fall through the small equipment holes in the top of your tank and
poison your fish. If you have to use one of these products near your aquar-
ium, tightly cover your tank ahead of time with plastic sheets or large towels
to protect your fish.
Treatment: Complete water and filter change.
Improper diet
Symptoms: General poor health; paleness of color; inactivity.
Cause: You. Poor nutrition.
Treatment: An unbalanced diet doesn’t contain all the vitamins and minerals
important to your fish’s health. Begin feeding a wide variety of commercially
packaged flakes, small servings of fresh lettuce, peas, and other green vegeta-
bles, and live foods (see Chapter 10 for more information on what foods are
good for which species).
Overfeeding
Symptoms: Lethargic fish; excessive weight gain; and constipation.
Cause: Overfeeding your tropical fish on a regular basis.
162
Part II: Fish and How to Care for Them 

Treatment: Fast your fish for two days. Improve poor or fouled water condi-
tions caused by uneaten, rotting food before it leads to more disease prob-
lems. If your fish are beginning to resemble the Goodyear blimp and are
bobbing up and down in the water like corks, start measuring each serving of
food so that you don’t feed them too much at one time (see Chapter 10 for
more).
Frightened fish
Symptoms: Your fish dash for cover when the aquarium lights are first turned
on; constant physical injures from collisions with decorations.
Cause: Sudden changes in lighting, quick human movements, people rapping
on the glass, and pets trying to get into the tank.
Treatment: Gradually increase room lighting by opening drapes and turning
on lamps before you switch on the aquarium lights.
Home Remedy: Salt Bath
Here’s a good home remedy that you can try to avoid giving your fish large
doses of medications. This method works really well and can save you a lot of
money.
A salt bath as a method of treating freshwater fish has been around since the
aquarium hobby first began. Salt baths have proved effective over time to
help cure problems such as fungus infestations, ich, and several other types
of parasites such as gill flukes. Basically what happens is the parasites are
submerged in the salt solution along with your fish and begin to take on
water until they burst and fall off.
We have used this home-remedy method for more than 20 years and have
found that it has a very high rate of success in treating different types of dis-
eases. (Don’t try this in your home bathtub with your own sores, or you may
end up peeling yourself off the ceiling — you’ve heard of salt in an open
wound? Not good for nonfish.)
A salt bath is really very simple. All you have to do is add one teaspoon of
table salt for each 5 gallons of water in your hospital tank. Continue adding 1
teaspoon of salt twice a day for the first five or six days. If the infected fish is
not completely well by the sixth day, continue to add one teaspoon of salt for
another three days.
163
Chapter 11: Diseases and Treatments

We’re not talking about adding salt to your main tank. When you hear that people
have salt in their main freshwater tank, it is because they are keeping species
such as the Molly which actually thrive better with a bit of salinity to their water.
Don’t confuse this concept with standard salt bath in a hospital tank.
The Sherlock Holmes Method
Everyone wants to do a little bit of detective work at least once in their life-
time. If you’re like us, you couldn’t find more than one pair of matching socks
in the dryer if your life depended on it. Fortunately, looking for clues that
indicate the presence of a tropical fish disease is much easier to do the laun-
dry. To get started, all you need to do is find one of those cool-looking hats, a
pipe, a long coat, and follow the clues we give you in this section.
We cannot overemphasize the importance of checking the overall health of
your fish very carefully every day. Shimmying, abnormal loss of appetite,
weight loss, paling or darkening of colors, increased or labored respiration,
and miniature For Sale signs on the aquarium’s porcelain castles are a few of
the warning signs that disease or environmental conditions are causing them
discomfort.
Other tell-tale clues to look for include: a bloated look, obvious visible
damage to your fish’s eyes, fins, or scale areas, and abnormal spots on the
body. If your fish is hanging around the heater, continually scratching on tank
decorations or substrate, or is normally active but is suddenly moving slowly,
it may have a serious problem.
If you notice any of these problems, don’t panic. Take the time to make care-
ful observations on the efficiency of the equipment, condition of the water,
and other disease-related factors. After you compile all the information you
can, you’re in a better position to make a sound judgment on the proper
course of action. If you’re unsure about what to do for a diseased fish, con-
tact your local vet or fish dealer. The people there can give you good advice
and help you with your fishy problems.
Using Quarantine and Hospital Tanks
A hospital tank helps you treat sick fish and is simply a small aquarium that
acts as a hospital ward. You remove diseased fish from the main tank and
place them in the hospital tank for chemical or other types of treatment. It’s
as simple as that. A quarantine tank is used to hold fish for a week that you
have just brought home from dealer, so that you have time to see if any ill-
ness develops before you put them in your main tank. Both tanks are very
important.
164
Part II: Fish and How to Care for Them 

Purpose and advantages of quarantining
All tropical fish go through a tremendous amount of stress being transported
to your home aquarium. Think about it — if someone snagged you with a
giant pair of panty hose and then stuck you in a large plastic bag, wouldn’t
you have a little bit of a problem with that? 
Fish are really not that much different from us when it comes to mental
stress. A quarantine tank can be the perfect way to provide your new tropical
fish with a suitable recovery area — it gives them time to regain their
strength before moving into their brand-new home. This recovery period also
gives you time to see whether any latent diseases or physical problems mani-
fest themselves.
Quarantine time
The very first thing that you need to do when you bring your new acquisi-
tions home (unless they are starter fish, the very first fish in a new aquarium)
is to place them in a quarantine tank for one week. You don’t quarantine
starter fish because you need them to begin the nitrogen cycle. While your
fish are in quarantine, check them daily for signs of disease and make sure
they are eating normally.
Writing it all down
A journal can help you keep track of your fish’s quarantine and health record.
You can check these records for information on previous treatments. Keep a
separate page for each fish and include the fish’s name, date of purchase,
size, health record, length of quarantine, and any other information you feel
may be important in future medical treatments. To look like a real pro, write
something important looking like “Scientific Information” on the journal’s
cover. Your friends will be impressed.
The tank
We think a 10- or 20-gallon tank is good for quarantining unless you plan on
buying some very large fish. All the equipment you need to get your quaran-
tine tank going is a good-quality power filter and a submersible heater. Make
your new fish feel secure by adding some gravel and a few artificial plants.
The last thing you need is for your new pets to go into a bare tank where they
can easily be frightened.
165
Chapter 11: Diseases and Treatments

Don’t forget that a quarantine tank needs to be cycled just like your regular
tank. A starter fish or two helps begin the biological cycle. When you go
down to your local dealer to purchase starter fish for the main tank, pick up a
couple of extras for the quarantine tank at the same time. The water condi-
tions (pH, temperature) in your quarantine tank should be similar to those in
your permanent aquarium. This prevents fish being stressed further when
you move them to the main aquarium.
Remember, it is much better to be patient and wait until your new fish com-
plete their quarantine cycle than it is to place them immediately into a main
tank where they can spread disease that could have been caught and treated.
In the long run, treating disease can cost you quite a bit more money than
setting up a simple and inexpensive quarantine tank.
Setting Up a Hospital Tank
Unfortunately, there is no 911 number for your aquatic pets should they
become ill. So you need a hospital tank to help treat them when they become
diseased. Hospital tanks are similar to quarantine tanks. The only difference
is, hospital tanks are used to treat ill fish, whereas quarantine tanks are used
to hold new acquisitions for observance. It is much more practical to treat
diseased fish in a separate hospital tank because many common medications
affect different species in different ways. For example, a malachite green for-
mula used to cure ich in most species has the potential to destroy any tetras
in your aquarium.
Treating diseased fish in a hospital tank also lowers the risk of the disease
spreading. Many antibiotic treatments destroy essential bacteria and cut
down on the efficiency of a tank’s biological filtration system, leading to even
more health problems and new diseases. Using a hospital tank prevents these
problems.
It really doesn’t take much money to set up a hospital tank if you purchase a
small aquarium (5- or 10-gallon) and a simple sponge filter to provide a good
base for beneficial biological bacteria. Filtration systems that contain carbon
don’t work very well in a hospital tank because the carbon often absorbs the
medication. The frequent water changes you need to do when treating sick
fish are much easier to handle in a small aquarium. A good submersible
heater with an internal rheostat lets you monitor water temperature as
needed. Diseases such as ich can be treated more quickly if you raise the
standard temperature by a few degrees.
166
Part II: Fish and How to Care for Them 

Remember that overly bright lighting reduces the effectiveness of many med-
ications. Try to use a lower wattage bulb for your hospital tank setup. Add a
few extra airstones to the hospital tank to increase the oxygen supply because
many medications tend to reduce the oxygen supply in the aquarium.
Understanding Medications
There are a large number of medications on the market, and many of them
can be used to treat a variety of diseases, so deciding which one you should
actually use can be very confusing. More often than not, the final choice of
medication rests with you. Each case is unique, and many aquarists prefer
one medication over another.
In time, you’ll discover which medications work best on certain diseases and
different species of fish. Until you reach that point, try to keep a wide variety
of medications around so that your friends and family think that you have
everything under control. The following list gives you an idea of how to use
common medications, and the pros and cons of each drug:
 Salt: Common table salt or marine salt is generally used to treat ich and
other parasitic diseases in freshwater fish. The normal dosage is one
tablespoon per gallon of water in the aquarium. Salt is very inexpensive,
but you can’t use it in tanks containing certain species, such as catfish. 
 Methylene blue: You often use this liquid to treat diseases such as ich,
fungus, and velvet. You achieve the correct dose by adding enough
methylene blue so that the water is difficult to see through, usually
about five drops per gallon. The bluish cast in the water disappears with
proper filtration, but stains decorations and gravel, and cannot be used
with many species of living plants. Methylene blue is hard to get out of
clothes and stains everything it touches.
 Malachite green: Use this wonderful medication to treat velvet, fungus,
and ich. It is very effective in battling disease, but cannot be used in
tanks that contain fry (newborn fish) or certain species of fish such as
tetras. Malachite green can be very toxic if used in large doses.
 Formalin: This is a bath-type treatment only and should not be used in
the main display tank. This is a great remedy for parasites, but it doesn’t
work well on internal infections and can be very toxic.
 Penicillin: Penicillin treats bacterial infections and is non-toxic. The
main disadvantages of this drug are the expense and the difficulty of
obtaining it.
167
Chapter 11: Diseases and Treatments

 Tetracycline: This antibiotic is great for bacterial infections and is non-
toxic. The only problem with this medication is that it can turn the water
yellow and cause unsightly foam to collect on the water surface.
 Acriflavine: Acriflavine treats ich and fungus, but may turn the water
green.

All Water Is Not
Created Equal
In This Chapter
 Considering the pros and cons of tap water, rainwater, bottled water, and well water
 Realizing why you shouldn’t put water from a pond, lake, or river in your aquarium
 Adding water to your aquarium
A
dding the correct type of water to your aquarium is very important to
the long-term health of your fish. Water can be obtained from many
sources, but only a few of these sources provide the correct requirements for
your aquatic pets. Understanding the correct water parameters for your tank
and choosing reliable water sources can help you become a successful hob-
byist right off the bat.
For example, Maddy’s college biology professor made her class look at pond
water through a microscope. She could barely believe her eyes. There must
have been 800 billion creatures crawling in it. Remember that almost any nat-
ural source of water has some type of living organism in it. In the wild, fish
are not confined to a small amount of water, so the threat of illness is small.
You need to find alternative sources of water if you want your fish to be
healthy and happy. 
Depending on where you live, your water supply from the city or from a well
can vary greatly. Some water sources have more metal content and debris
than others. One farm Maddy lived on had water that was so thick in iron it
had the appearance of a melted down automobile. Never assume that your
main water source is automatically safe for your fish because it can contain
contaminates such as rust.

Comparing Different Water Types
You can get water from a variety of sources. Here we talk about the pros and
cons of tap water, rainwater, bottled water, natural lake/pond/river water, and
well water.
Tap water
In order to protect the human population from being killed off by drinking
water, water companies add chemicals such as chlorine or chloramine
(ammonia bonded to chlorine) to wipe out small organisms that could make
us all sick. This treated tap water may be safe for humans, but it can be
deadly to your aquatic pets. 
You have to get rid of the chlorine from any water source that you use to fill
your aquariums. Chlorine kills all types of fish and invertebrates.
Dechlorinating with dechlorinator
You have a few options for removing chlorine and chloramines from tap
water to make it perfectly safe to use in your aquarium. One option (and if
you’re like us, you’ll opt for this method because it’s the easiest) is to go
down to your local fish store and purchase a bottle of dechlorinator, a prod-
uct which instantly removes chlorine and the chlorine in chloramines from
your water. After adding dechlorinator, you can safely put your new starter
fish in the aquarium water.
The best time to add dechlorinator is after your tank is filled and all equipment
is up and running. You need to dechlorinate all the water you add to your
aquarium — even the water you put in to replenish water lost to evaporation.
Dechlorinating the old-fashioned way
Your tanks are low, and you’re out of dechlorinator because your local fish
store has run out. If you want to be a practical hobbyist, you can simply
dechlorinate water the old-fashioned way. (Don’t panic; this method doesn’t
involve a lot of work.) Take a few plastic jugs (gallon milk containers work
great) and rinse them thoroughly with clear water. Glass jars work fine, but
they can break, so plastic is really your best bet for safety. Make sure you
allow the water to run from the tap for a few seconds before rinsing to elimi-
nate any water that has sat stagnant in the piping. Water can pick up trace
amounts of metal if it sits unmoving in household pipes.
172
Part III: Water, Chemicals, and Plants 

Never use soap or other chemicals to clean out containers for aquarium
water! The soap leaves a residue that can be deadly to your fish.
After rinsing, fill the plastic containers with tap water, allow them to sit with
the lids off for 48 hours, and voilá, chlorine-free water!
You can add an airstone (a small stone that splits an air supply from your
pump into smaller bubbles) to each jug to cut your waiting time in half (to 24
hours). See Chapter 6 for more on airstones. Attach the airstone to a spare
aquarium pump by tubing. If you keep three or four jugs like this sitting
around, you always have a supply of safe water. Simply use a gang valve
(again, Chapter 6) so that you can use one pump to power several airstones
at once. When company is on the way, grab a jug and start filling your tanks.
Floating dust particles, paint sprays, and so on can get into these water jugs.
Keep the jugs in an area that doesn’t have a lot of air-borne debris. Placing a
small cloth over the top of each jug can help keep out unwanted particles.
Guarding against metals
It’s not just chlorine you have to worry about. Depending on your area, your
tap water may also contain metal deposits, such as copper. Too much metal
can be deadly for your fish. To be safe, buy water treatments from your pet
dealer that safely remove the metals from water.
As mentioned previously, let the water from your tap run down the sink for a
minute before you start filling containers with water for your aquariums, just
as you did when you rinsed them. This precaution allows water that’s been in
constant contact with metal sink pipes (and is slightly contaminated as a
result) to flow through.
Rainwater
A few hobbyists collect rainwater for use in their aquariums. If you have an
extremely large tank, this is not a very practical method. The process is really
more trouble than it is worth, unless you have a lot of spare time, small
tanks, energy on your hands, or live in a region of the country that receives a
tremendous amount of annual rainfall. If you live in the desert southwest,
your fish will probably die from old age before you collect enough water to
top off your tank, and it may not always rain when you need it to.
Another problem with rainwater is that it may contain contaminants from fac-
tory emissions, smog, and other pollutants. To be honest, you may end up
spending twice as much for chemicals to treat your rainwater than if you had
just used your trusty old kitchen faucet.
173
Chapter 12: All Water Is Not Created Equal

If you decide to gather rainwater to help condition your fish for breeding,
make sure that you use non-metallic containers for collection. In fact, never
use metallic containers to collect water for any aquarium. Also keep in mind
that rainwater tends to be very soft (low in dissolved minerals) and may not
be suitable for hard-water fish. Hard-water fish (such as red-tailed sharks,
blindcave fish, and oscars, whose water has a high mineral content in the
wild) that are forced to live in soft water conditions cannot spawn properly
or maintain good health.
You should always check the water parameters (specific water requirements)
for your particular aquatic species before using rainwater.
Never collect rainwater from metal gutters. Over time, gutters rust and
become filled with debris such as leaves, dirt, paper, and pieces of roofing
shingle. No matter how often you clean your gutters, you are risking metallic
and natural contamination by using metal gutters to funnel water for an
aquarium supply.
If you’re bent on collecting rainwater, one solution is to use an open con-
tainer with a large plastic funnel inserted into the top of the collection jug.
Just make sure you don’t use the funnel for adding oil to your car or other
household duties between rainwater collections.
The advantages of bottled water 
(not Perrier)
Okay, when we mention bottled water, we’re talking about the kind you get in
a machine outside of your local grocery store or the gallon jugs that you can
purchase inside. Put it this way: If the water is really expensive, it’s the wrong
kind; if it’s inexpensive, it’s the right kind. Don’t spend a fortune on expensive
bottled water when the least expensive will do just fine.
You can very likely use bottled water in your aquarium without adding any
chemicals to it. But to be safe, we always add dechlorinator to our water no
matter where it came from. Spending a few pennies on dechlorinator is a
much better route to take than losing a bunch of expensive fish.
Well water (don’t count on it)
As we mentioned earlier, Maddy once lived on a farm. A deep well, located
somewhere out on the back 40, furnished the farm’s entire water supply. The
water from this well was truly one of life’s great mysteries — all the filters and
chemicals in the world couldn’t change the composition of this amazing liquid.
174
Part III: Water, Chemicals, and Plants 

The water was guaranteed to turn every color of the rainbow within a period
of five minutes during a shower, and Maddy’s body took on those glorious
copper colors when she stepped out. Instead of buying an expensive
Halloween costume, trick-or-treaters saved money by coming over to the
house for a shower.
The point of this reminiscence is that well water is generally not a good
source to use for filling your aquariums because too many bad things can get
into it, including sulfur, lead, and mud. Well water is usually lacking in good
oxygen content and is high in dissolved nitrogen and carbon dioxide instead.
If you insist on using it anyway, take a small sample down to your local water
company and ask them to test it for you. Water companies are pretty good
about testing your water for little or no money, even if it is from your own
well. Most standard aquarium and home water test kits are not made to accu-
rately test the chemicals, metals, and other odd items that can be found in
well water. If you get a dirty look from the water department clerk because
your sample destroyed her expensive equipment, you can forget the bad idea
of using well water altogether and use bottled water or treated water from a
friend’s city water supply (dechlorinate it before using).
If your well water is free of metals and does test acceptable for human con-
sumption, make sure you follow up with an aquarium test kit to check for
tropical fish perimeters such as pH and nitrites. They may have to be
adjusted using aquarium chemicals before you use it for your aquatic pets.
Collecting Water from Bodies of Water
(Why You Want to Forget This Bad Idea)
If you’re planning to set up a freshwater aquarium, someone has probably
suggested that you can be a real naturalist and go down to your local river or
pond to snag the water for it. You may be thinking that this isn’t a half-bad
idea — you can keep your fish closer to their natural environment. However,
after your dream of a cameo on National Geographic fades a bit, you can go
ahead and forget this idea entirely.
Why? Because most of the freshwater fish you purchase from the pet shop
are raised in a hatchery and have never been near any river or pond. These
fish are raised in standard aquarium water conditions. When you collect
water from a pond or river, you take a great risk of introducing disease into
your tank. 
175
Chapter 12: All Water Is Not Created Equal

If you don’t want to worry about the shelf life of your test kits, purchase indi-
vidual kits like those offered by Aquarium Pharmaceuticals (www.genkikoi-
supply.com/aquarium_pharmaceutical_test_kits.html). These kits
have long shelf lives and have the advantage of allowing you to replace one
part of the kit when needed without replacing the entire thing.
Adding Water to Your Aquarium
When you’re ready to add your carefully treated water to your aquarium,
pour it slowly so that you don’t disturb the substrate or any of the decora-
tions already in the tank. One trick is to place a small dinner plate or saucer
on the substrate and pour the water directly onto the plate, which acts as a
barrier to keep your substrate from being spread all over the tank into tiny
anthill-like mounds. Another strategy is to slowly pour the new water down
the inside of the glass. 
If you have a very large aquarium to fill, you may want to consider purchas-
ing a new garden hose and an adapter that will allow you to hook it up to
your kitchen or bathroom faucet. This setup will allow you to fill your aquar-
ium quickly. An even better solution to filling a large tank is to purchase a
Python. A Python (see Chapter 6) works on the same principle as the garden
hose, except it has all the attachments needed and allows you to easily con-
trol and reverse the flow of water with a simple switch for water changes that
you will be doing on a weekly basis.
Home Sweet Home
Your fish’s water environment is comparable to the air in your own home.
The water is what keeps your fish alive and must be one of the most impor-
tant factors to take into consideration. Take time to make sure that the water
that you are going to use is perfect for your aquatic pets. It never pays to
rush or take huge shortcuts. 
Here are a few rules to help you maximize your tropical fish’s health and 
happiness:
 Make sure the water you use is as free of debris, chemicals, and metals
as possible by conducting water tests on well or city supplies, or by
using bottled water.
176
Part III: Water, Chemicals, and Plants 

 Dechlorinate either with dechlorinator or by using the jug method
described earlier in this chapter.
 If you are going to collect water, make sure you use a clean, non-metallic
container and funnel system.
 Make sure the water perimeters in your aquarium match the perimeters
in the water at your dealer where your aquatic pets are coming from.
 When carrying out water changes, make sure that your replacement
water is of equal temperature and pH. to the water in your tank.
 Monitor your water conditions with a home test kit each week.
Good water quality will keep your tropical fish healthy and happy for years to
come.

In This Chapter
 Considering chemicals to start your aquarium
 Perusing plant chemicals
 Deliberating disease-fighting chemicals
H
ave you ever been at the aquarium store and noticed shelf after shelf
of mysterious-looking chemicals? Ever wonder whether you need a
wizard’s license or some type of magical scroll to decipher and use them
properly? Well, you really don’t need to worry too much, because the chemi-
cals are actually fairly easy to understand and will become second nature as
you progress through the hobby.
A very wide variety of chemicals for your aquarium is available, so it is
understandable that it can seem a bit confusing at first. But once you read
this chapter and learn the basics of some of the most popular and useful
aquatic chemicals on the market, you will be able to look at chemicals in a
whole new way. 
Right now we take a closer look at a few of these chemical products made for
use in home aquariums and explain their purpose. Because there is such a
multitude of aquarium chemicals out there, it is impossible to cover them all
here. (We doubt we could cover them all in an entire book!) But by the time
you finish reading this chapter, you will be on the road to becoming a real
chemical wizard.
Understanding Chemical Use
Just as there are guidelines to follow for using the chemicals you find around
your home (especially in the laundry room and kitchen), there are rules for
using aquarium chemicals as well. After all, you wouldn’t even think of mixing

ammonia and chlorine to help whiten your laundry unless you wanted to
spend five days in an oxygen tent, right? Well, your fish don’t cope well with
excessive mixtures and overuse of chemicals either.
Chemicals are chemicals. We cannot stress this point enough! Any chemical
can be dangerous if it is mixed with the wrong substance. Although this is not
a common hazard with aquarium chemicals, certain mixtures and overdoses
can be lethal to your fish. Before you use any type of chemical, read the
bottle very carefully.
Overdosing — adding too many chemicals at one time, or even adding too
many chemicals over a long period of time — can affect the water conditions
(pH and so on) in your aquarium. Dumping bottle after bottle of treatments
into your tank also makes your fish look like they’re swimming around in a
swamp, and we guarantee that they’ll end up hating you for it. The point is
that you shouldn’t just dump 15 bottles of chemicals into your aquarium
hoping one of them will work. (If you have to step carefully while walking
across your fish’s room to avoid crushing discarded chemical bottles, you’re
probably overdosing.)
When should you use chemicals?
When you treat diseases, use chemicals as a last resort. Try one of the many
more natural ways available (weekly water changes and keeping an eye on
temperature and pH) to help your fish avoid illness (see Chapter 11). If you’re
just starting an aquarium, you can use chemicals a little more frequently
because you need to dechlorinate your water and condition it. But you still
don’t want to over do it. Too much of anything is usually bad in some way or
other.
Following instructions to the letter
Always follow all the manufacturer’s instructions on the label! Don’t skip any
steps and follow through on the entire recommended treatment or usage
time!
If you don’t understand the instructions or the ingredients on a chemical’s
label (sometimes they seem to be written in some weird alien dialect), don’t
hesitate to contact the product’s manufacturer and have someone there help
clear up your questions. You will often find a 1-800 number right there on the
label. If you’re in a hurry, ask your local dealer for help.
180
Part III: Water, Chemicals, and Plants 

Chemicals You Need to Start 
Your Aquarium
When you first set up a brand new aquarium, certain chemicals can help you
out a great deal. You can purchase most of the chemicals mentioned in this
section at your local pet shop, and the other ones you can most likely find at
the supermarket or even around your own house.
Glass cleaner
You can use a household glass cleaner to clean the outside of your aquarium
and its frame. Standard window cleaning products such as Windex work very
well. Make sure you cover the top of the tank with a towel so that mist from
the cleaner does not get inside the tank. Cleaners that have a citrus base
seem to work the best. They leave the glass clean and streak free and also
help to keep fingerprints from reappearing on the glass. (This is especially
useful when you have small children in the house.)
Never use a household glass cleaner on the inside of your tank! Glass cleaner
residue can kill your fish very quickly. The only thing that should be used to
clean out the inside of an aquarium is fresh water. Never use soaps or any
other types of chemicals on the inside glass.
Dechlorinator
When you first add water to your aquarium, you have to remove the chlorine
from it first. Chlorine will kill your fish. Dechlorinator usually comes in liquid
form and removes harmful chlorine instantly. With most brands, you need to
add only a few drops per gallon to do the job (read the label carefully, of
course). Basically, the main purpose of dechlorinator is to make the aquar-
ium water safe for your fish without your having to wait for the chlorine to
dissipate naturally (which usually takes 24–48 hours). 
Water conditioner
Water conditioners often combine a dechlorinator with other chemicals that
instantly detoxify the heavy metals in tap water. You can use a water condi-
tioner when you are setting up a new aquarium, changing water, or adding
181
Chapter 13: Those Crazy Chemicals

water. Many sources of water (old wells and the like) may contain harmful
metals that a water conditioner can detoxify. Even if your water “tests safe,”
you never know when its properties may change, so a water conditioner is
always a good bet.
Cycling chemicals
We know it can be really hard to wait around for an aquarium to complete the
nitrogen cycle (see Chapter 14). Depending on the type of system you have —
freshwater, saltwater, or brackish — and the overall size of your tank, the entire
nitrogen cycle can take weeks or even months to complete. Cycling chemicals
have been around for a long, long time. During the nitrogen cycle, beneficial
bacteria convert harmful ammonia (produced by fish waste) into less toxic
nitrites. Following this conversion, another kind of beneficial bacteria convert
the nitrites into even less harmful nitrates. The nitrates are only harmful to
your fish after they begin to build up in large quantities. The nitrates can be
removed from your aquarium water though water changes.
Some cycling products can start your nitrogen cycle and speed it up as well.
The appealing idea behind this particular product is really very simple. The
faster your tank cycles, the faster you can add more new fish to your aquar-
ium. And the sooner you have fish in your aquarium, the sooner your neigh-
bors will envy you.
If these natural bacteria products speed up the cycling time and give your
starter fish that extra edge, why not use them? The only danger that we can
see is that of looking at cycling chemicals as a cure-all for a tank you over-
stocked. These products are an aid to the nitrogen cycle, not a substitute for it!
Put it this way: If you set up a 55-gallon freshwater aquarium and toss in a
couple of tablespoons of cycling formula in an attempt to offset the 75 gold-
fish you started your tank with, you are in for some serious problems. These
products have a specific purpose, and should not be pushed to the limit.
Bacteria in a bottle
Some products speed up your aquarium’s cycling time because they contain
massive amounts of various beneficial bacteria held in a dormant state. After
you add the bacteria formula to your aquarium water, the bacteria become
completely regenerated and rapidly consume ammonia and nitrites. These
different types of micro-organisms combine to create a powerful nitrifying
182
Part III: Water, Chemicals, and Plants 

team. Most of these products are nonpathogenic, meaning they won’t harm
any plants or fish in your aquarium. It is impossible to overdose your tank
with bacteria in a bottle. One good example of this type of product is
NitroBac Freshwater Bio-Starter (www.azgardens.com/aquarium_
chemicals.php).
Bacteria on a medium
You can purchase a good home for this bacteria product that comes as a
rapid-action biological filter medium. This type of medium is called precolo-
nized (meaning it already has the bacteria attached) with a multitude of nitri-
fying bacteria which, in some cases, can cut your cycling time in half. The
medium prevents clogging and helps maintain good water circulation in your
filtration unit. A bacterial medium is designed to have a maximum surface
area to encourage the largest supply of beneficial bacteria.
Water clarifier
A water clarifier (such as Aquarium Pharmaceuticals’s Accu-Clear Water
Clarifier) removes excess cloudiness in your aquarium caused by bacterial
blooms (growth spurts) that have gotten out of control. Blooms are usually a
result of excess nutrients (nitrates and phosphates) or excessive lighting.
Chemicals You Need to Maintain 
Your Aquarium
Here are some other useful chemicals that can come in handy once you have
started up your aquarium system.
Waste eliminator
Products such as Hagen Nutrafin Waste Control Organic Waste Eliminator
rapidly reduces organic waste in aquariums and cleans filters, gravel, and the
interior surfaces of the tank. 
183
Chapter 13: Those Crazy Chemicals

Aquarium salt
Aquarium salt adds electrolytes (sodium) and helps your fish breathe better
by increasing their gill function when they are diseased. 
pH regulators
pH regulators increase or decrease the pH of your aquarium water. You want to
increase or decrease pH depending on which way you need to go (see Chapter
14 for more on pH) to achieve the proper pH for your particular species.
Cichlid buffers
A cichlid buffer is a mixture of trace elements, sulfates, sodium, calcium, mag-
nesium, potassium, and carbonates that provide natural water chemistry for
rift lake fishes. (See Chapter 8 for more on cichlids.) 
Chemicals You Need for Your Plants
For all you hobbyists out there with green thumbs, we present several chemi-
cals you can use to help your living aquarium plants thrive to their full poten-
tial. (Don’t try them on plastic plants, because they may turn funny colors or
something.)
184
Part III: Water, Chemicals, and Plants 
Prevention and control treatments
Several chemical treatments protect the slime
coat (a natural coating that helps to protect it
against disease) on your fish’s body. These prod-
ucts (Stress Coat is a good example) also help
relieve stress and deter the onset of disease.
Slime coat products are important for your fish,
especially ones that have just been transported
or netted. Your fish’s natural slime coat can easily
be worn off and leave bare patches that are open
to attack by various diseases.
Snail control products destroy snails in your
freshwater aquarium and help you keep them
from coming back. Most snails are brought into
the aquarium system on live plants. Snails are
very sneaky and crafty (kind of like our kids) and
have the ability to slip by even the most experi-
enced eye. Snails can multiply faster than your
household bills and can ruin the appearance of
an aquarium as they get out of control. Nip them
in the bud. Once your aquarium is overrun with
snails, they are almost impossible to get rid of
and they often carry diseases that can damage
your fish’s health.

The living plants in your aquarium system have special needs that you need
to meet. Your plants deserve the very best, just like your fish do.
Creating your own rainforest
If you have plants in your aquarium that come from the Amazon region (Amazon
swords, for example), you can purchase chemicals to help create a rainforest
condition in your tank. Products such as Instant Amazon increase lush plant
growth (without nitrates or phosphates), discourage algae and parasite
growth, detoxify ammonia and nitrites, and help your plants create beneficial
oxygen for your fish. They also give your plants a better chance of obtaining
nutrients from the aquarium water and enhance biological filtration.
Amazon products (products that create water conditions similar to that
found in the Amazon region) provide essential macro-nutrients (proteins, car-
bohydrates, and fiber) without stimulating algae and give your aquarium
water the natural look of “peat” (yellow-tinted water that is native to Amazon
fishes). You can use these products for soft-water fish such as discus,
angelfish, neons, barbs, and gouramis to create a yellow color to the water,
simulating their natural environment. This type of product often contains
trace elements, vitamins, bark, and wood.
185
Chapter 13: Those Crazy Chemicals
Keeping a clear head
In order for your fish to keep a clear head, you
have to do the same. If you get carried away
and turn your aquarium water into a chemical
nightmare, your fish are going to start acting
funny, suffer health problems, and face the pos-
sibility of death from toxicity. Make sure you
check that your water conditions are correct for
your system (temperature, salinity, pH, and
nitrate levels) before you add medications. It is
also important to make sure pumps and heaters
are running properly, and filter pads are clean.
The golden rule of chemicals states that an
aquarist should always attempt to remedy
aquarium water problems naturally before
adding chemicals. Think about it. Why add
something that is not needed? Proper aquarium
maintenance helps keep your water in good
condition so that you don’t have to add chemi-
cals to correct problems. Carrying out consis-
tent water changes once a week now will help
ward off serious problems in the future.
Remember, many chemicals claim to cure just
about any problem under the sun. Always take
each product’s claims with a grain of salt until
you check them out yourself!

Plant grow
This product enhances intracellular reactions in plants and provides them
with better coloration and improved growth.
Root Tabs
Root Tabs supply aquarium plants with magnesium, potassium, iron, and
sulfur. These tabs help new aquatic plants get a good start in your aquarium
and keep already established plants flourishing.
Algae control
Algae-control products such as Algone (www.algone.com/algone_
information.asp) reduce and prevent algae blooms by coloring the
aquarium water blue. This coloring process absorbs/blocks sunlight, which
the green algae need for survival.
Chemicals Your Fish Need for Medication
No matter what you do, disease is going to strike. Even the most experienced
fishkeepers must deal with aquatic health problems from time to time. The
following list gives you a few examples of products you can use to fight back
when all other methods have failed (Chapter 11 has more on diseases and
keeping your fish healthy):
 Formalin is used to treat fish that have contracted external parasites. A
formalin bath helps alleviate problems such as skin flukes.
 Antibiotics treat bacterial infections, fungus, ulcers, gill disease, popeye,
and dropsy.
 Malachite green is often used in the treatment of ich (Ichthyophthirius
multifilius).
 Paragon treats inflamed gills, anchor worms, copepods, open sores,
hemorrhaging, and hole-in-the-head disease.
Medications can be very confusing. Many manufacturers combine medica-
tions to treat a variety of illnesses. The label of most medication bottles lists
the types of illness the product treats. These label listings help you wade
through the confusion and choose the right product for the job.

and Water Testing
In This Chapter
 Keeping your tank clean
 Knowing the nitrogen cycle
 Pondering pH and hardness 
 Testing water conditions
W
ater quality is an important element in maintaining a successful aquar-
ium system, so it is important that you learn a few basics about water
chemistry such as the nitrogen cycle, pH, and hardness. Excellent water con-
ditions in your aquarium will allow your pets to live long and healthy lives.
Poor water conditions can leave your fish in poor health or cause their
demise. Fortunately, monitoring and maintaining proper water conditions for
each species can be easily done with a few simple test kits.
Take the time to monitor your water conditions on a weekly basis so that you
can correct any problems with ease. Your fish have to live in their aquarium
water 24 hours a day. Make sure that you provide them with the best condi-
tions possible.
Eliminating Fish Waste
Your fish are gonna look great swimming around in your new tank. The water
and the decorations are going to look sparkling clean and will impress everyone.
But it won’t stay that way without proper biological filtration and cycling,
because your fish have to settle themselves with Mother Nature each and every
day. Depending on the total number of fish in your tank, that can quickly add up

188
Part III: Water, Chemicals, and Plants 
to a whole lot of waste being excreted. This waste takes the form of ammonia, a
dangerous chemical that in high amounts can be lethal to your fish, and CO2.
Don’t worry; for every aquarium problem there is always a solution.
To solve the waste problem, your fish and you join forces to provide proper
biological filtration (utilizing living bacteria that constantly remove waste)
and cycling (building up bacteria at the beginning to convert ammonia to
nitrites and then to less harmful nitrates.) The CO2 is removed by plants in
the aquarium through photosynthesis and by air from airstones and filters
running in the tank.
Now for the good news: There is no problem getting these certain bacteria,
which are present in the water to start with, to help take care of excess
buildups. Now, we know that the word bacteria is usually associated with bad
and scary things such as infections, but in an aquarium system, bacteria
actually act as the good guys and save the day. 
To understand all the weird and wonderful processes taking place in the
water of your aquarium system, then, you need to know about ammonia, bac-
teria, cycling, and the other aspects of the nitrogen cycle. These ideas may
seem a little complicated at first (only because they are!), but the tips and
explanations in this chapter can help you cut a clear pathway through the
darkness that plagues the topic of water conditions.
A new system is not as biologically stable as an old one (conditioned aquar-
ium), but in time, of course, a new system becomes old and stable. 
Conditioning Your Tank
You need to condition (also known as accomplishing the nitrification process,
start-up cycle, and biological cycle) your new aquarium to provide your fish
with the best possible chance for good health and survival. Conditioning sets
up a bacterial colony to get rid of the nasty waste products your fish excrete.
You have to be patient during this conditioning cycle because it does take time.
Rushing headlong through this vital conditioning process will undoubtedly
lead to quite a bit of heartache as you lose your fish to a condition known as
new tank syndrome (see the section “Preventing new tank syndrome,” later in
this chapter).
The main danger in any new aquarium is the rapid build-up of ammonia in the
water through excretion and the decay of nitrogen products such as fish food
and waste. As your aquarium begins to age, beneficial bacteria begin break-
ing down the ammonia so that the levels do not become too high. Bacteria
are always present in your tank, but not enough in the beginning to take care
of the problem.

Generally, conditioning takes about four to six weeks, but the time needed
depends on the temperature of the water, the type and number of filtration
units, the size of your system, and the number of livestock (starter fish)
doing the backstroke around your tank. 
Starting the Nitrogen Cycle
The nitrogen cycle plays a very important role in your aquarium system
(Figure 14-1). During the first part of the nitrogen cycle, as we have men-
tioned, beneficial bacteria called nitrosomonas convert lethal ammonia to less
toxic nitrites. During the second part of the cycle, another beneficial bacteria
(nitrobacter) convert nitrites to less harmful nitrates. Nitrates are harmful at
high levels but can be removed though frequent water changes.
About two weeks after you add starter fish to your aquarium, the ammonia
build-up in your tank begins to peak. (You won’t really have any ammonia in
your aquarium until after you add your fish and they start excreting waste, or
leaving food uneaten.) You’re probably wondering what to do with the ammo-
nia, right? Well, just sit back, because your friendly neighborhood bacteria
take care of everything.
During the weeks of the conditioning period, several types of bacteria multi-
ply rapidly in order to remove toxic chemicals from the water. As the number
of bacteria increases, they render larger amounts of waste product less toxic
by converting them to less harmful substances in the nitrogen cycle.
Encouraging nitrosamonas (good bacteria
number one)
When uneaten food and fish waste is broken down, it is turned into either ion-
ized ammonium (NH4+, a pH lower than 7.0 will cause more ammonium) or
non-ionized ammonia (NH3, a pH higher than 7.0 will cause more ammonia.)
The ammonium is not harmful to your aquarium, but the ammonia is a whole
other story and needs to be taken care of.
As mentioned previously, during the first phase of the nitrogen cycle, the
nitrosomonas bacteria in the aquarium water increase to detoxify and
remove the ammonia from your aquarium. The by-product of this process is
harmful nitrites. High levels of nitrites can still seriously kill or harm your
fish, but they’re not as bad as ammonia. Nitrosomonas bacteria require a
good oxygen supply (which can be provided though filtration and airstones)
in order to multiply and grow correctly.

Part III: Water, Chemicals, and Plants 

Promoting nitrobacter (good bacteria
number two)
In a short time, the nitrites produced by the nitrosomonas bacteria begin
increasing toward toxic levels. When nitrite levels begin to climb, a second
type of bacteria known as nitrobacter converts them to less deadly nitrates.
So far, the ammonia produced by waste has been converted to nitrites, and
then to nitrates. Now what happens? Nitrate levels continue to increase
slowly over time, but you can maintain them at proper levels through fre-
quent water changes. If you don’t change your water, the nitrates build up to
the point where they are just as toxic as the ammonia you got rid of.
During the conditioning period, you need to monitor pH, ammonia, nitrite,
and nitrate levels using standard test kits (available at aquarium shops) so
you can see how the cycle is progressing. Notice that the pH level decreases
a little during the conditioning process. This is normal.
Don’t use chemicals and medications during the conditioning process,
because they can potentially damage proper bacterial growth and, in turn,
interfere with the nitrogen cycle.
Speeding things up a bit
You can start up the nitrogen cycle by adding one or more of the following
things to your tank:
 Starter fish: Adding one or two fish is a good way to provide a minimum
amount of waste to your tank so that essential bacteria can multiply at a
normal rate. Using a couple of guppies or hardy danios to start the matu-
ration process is one of the best ways to begin your nitrogen cycle.
 Mature gravel: Gravel from a mature (and disease-free) aquarium
already has a large bacteria population on its surface and acts as an
excellent starter culture. Add a few pinches of food each day so that you
can test for nitrate production with a test kit.
 Food: Adding a small amount of food to the tank each day can help
begin the nitrogen cycle. The only problem with this method is that it is
very unreliable and can lead to water fouling if food is not added in the
correct amounts. The correct amount would be a few pinches twice a
day to start the ammonia production as the uneaten food begins to
break down.
191
Chapter 14: The Nitrogen Cycle and Water Testing

 Commercial additives: You can purchase additives such as freeze-dried
bacteria at your local pet store to help speed up the nitrogen cycle. We
never had much luck with the older products. However, many new prod-
ucts, such as pre-colonized mediums (you add them to your filter box or
canister) can significantly increase cycling time.
The best way to begin the aquarium maturation cycle, in our opinion, is to
add a small amount of mature gravel and a few starter fish.
Despite the fact that your starter fish begin the process of proper bacterial
growth, it takes time to build up a well-established biological colony. Don’t
add too many fish right away because they can overload the biological filtra-
tion system and result in new tank syndrome (see next section).
Instead, simply wait a couple of weeks after the tank is cycled, then add a few
small fish each week to the aquarium. This gradual increase in livestock
keeps ammonia levels within an acceptable range for the bacteria present to
do their job correctly.
Frequent, small water changes (replace 5 percent of the water per day) help
lower any excess waste build-up.
During the cycling period, you may notice cloudiness in the water. Don’t
worry; it isn’t a sign that all has gone wrong. The cloudiness is a beneficial
bacterial bloom and is perfectly normal. If your aquarium has adequate filtra-
tion, the water should become clear again within a few days.
Preventing new tank syndrome
As time passes, waste builds up in your tank and needs to be eliminated.
After a month or two, the significant amount of bacteria living in the sub-
strate bed and filters (or any surface they can attach themselves to) take care
of any fishy waste products.
New tank syndrome occurs when ammonia or nitrite is not properly converted
to less harmful nitrates. Overstocking (putting too many fish in your aquarium)
when you first set up your tank usually causes new tank syndrome.
New tank syndrome is a silent killer, often striking without warning. It causes
extreme physical ailments or even death. Your fish may look a little out of
joint one day and be dead the next. You must learn to recognize the symp-
toms of this problem: Fish suffering from new tank syndrome often lose some
of their coloring, hide in corners with clamped fins, and lie near the bottom
of the aquarium.
192
Part III: Water, Chemicals, and Plants 

If you notice any of these unusual behaviors, immediately test the ammonia
and nitrite levels and carry out water changes as needed to reduce excess
waste products.
Testing Ammonia, Nitrites, 
Nitrates, and pH
To maintain healthy water conditions at the beginning of the cycle and
throughout the life of your aquarium system, you need to continue to test
your water’s ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels frequently. Keeping these
levels where they should be helps your fish stay much healthier overall.
Changing the water frequently
One of the best (and oldest) methods of keeping your ammonia and nitrate
levels down is to change the water frequently. Water changes help remove
unwanted waste, and at the same time replace depleted trace elements.
Besides, if you change your aquarium water frequently (yes, that means more
than once a year!) your fish will love you for it.
Research shows that fish that live in aquariums where the water is changed
often, display better coloration, live longer and healthier lives, and fight off
disease with superhuman (we mean superfishy) strength. Water changes also
help your filtration system function better.
You may wonder how much water you should change. We prefer to change
about 15 percent of the water in our tanks every week. We know that this may
sound like a chore, but it really isn’t. You can get a special kind of hose, called
a Python, to help you out. You can also do it the old-fashioned way, using a
bucket.
Do not do lift heavy buckets of water if you have any health problems. Get
someone to do it for you. One of your neighbors probably owes you a favor
anyway.
A Python connects to the tap on your sink. You can use it to remove the
water you want to change from your tank so that it drains directly into the
sink. You can then reverse the flow and add water (that is the same tempera-
ture as the tank) in smaller amounts to a bucket placed near the tank. Simply
add dechlorinator to the bucket water and then add it to your tank.
193
Chapter 14: The Nitrogen Cycle and Water Testing

If you don’t keep changing the water in your aquariums every week, your
nitrate level may rise to the point where it becomes lethal. There is really no
practical way to get rid of excess nitrate levels without water changes.
Sometimes some of the oldest methods are still the best.
As your aquarium system matures, the pH level drops due to acid build-up.
Water changes help eliminate this problem as well.
Maintaining proper pH levels
The pH of your aquarium is simply a logarithmic scale that tells how alkaline
or acidic your aquarium water is. The pH scale goes from 0 (highly acidic) to
14.0 (highly alkaline) with a value of 7.0 being considered neutral.
When you set up you new aquarium, you need a pH test kit, available at
almost any pet store. Don’t be afraid; they’re really quite simple to use.
Special test kits for freshwater aquariums test pH in the lower to neutral
range to the higher ranges. Don’t bother trying to use a home water testing
kit as they are expensive, hard to find, and are not made to test aquarium
conditions. 
One type of aquarium water testing kit consists of a simple color card, plastic
measuring tube, and chemicals that either lower or raise the pH. Usually, you
fill the measuring tube with water from your aquarium and add a few drops of
regent (a water color-changing chemical supplied with the test kit). Then you
compare the resulting color to the color on the provided kit chart, which
indicates the pH value of your aquarium water. This system is difficult if you
have color vision problems like we do.
Some aquarium water testing kits have strips of litmus paper that, when you
dip them into your aquarium, change color to indicate the pH level. With
others, you read your pH level read electronically by inserting probes
attached to a machine into the water.
The type of test kit you choose depends on how much mad money you have
to blow when you find yourself picking up supplies. We like the probe type
testers because they are the easiest to read due to their digital output. They
can be a bit pricey, though. Buying a simple, inexpensive test kit is fine if you
cannot afford the higher-priced equipment.
Check the pH level of your aquarium water when you first set up your tank
and at least once a week after the nitrogen cycle is complete. Many species of
fish prefer to live in slightly alkaline; others like to hang out in acidic waters;
and some like to remain in between (neutral). So the pH level you need for
your particular system depends on what species of fish you have.
194
Part III: Water, Chemicals, and Plants 

The pH values in a freshwater system can fluctuate very rapidly. Even the
smallest change in pH level can really stress out your fish and make them
much more susceptible to various diseases. So keep an eye on the situation.
A pH of 5 is ten times more acidic than a pH of 6. So don’t let the little num-
bers fool you — they can change your water chemistry drastically.
When you purchase your fish, make sure that your various species’ pH
requirements are compatible. Chapter 8 lists some general pH guidelines for a
number of popular freshwater species. If you are unsure, check with your local
pet dealer to find out the pH of any species you are purchasing from him.
Recall that ammonia is more toxic in a system with a higher pH.
If there are any fish in your aquarium, change the pH level gradually. Changes
of more than one range value per day (for example, from 6.5 to 7.5) can shock
your fish and result in their death.
Acidity
If, after testing, you find that the pH level of your aquarium water is too low
(that is, too acidic), you can raise it by adding sodium bicarbonate (also
known as baking soda) from the test kit or through water changes which also
remove organic build-up. This organic build-up reduces pH. If your test kit
does not have the chemicals, you can purchase them at your local pet store.
Alkalinity
If you find that the pH level of your water is too high (meaning too alkaline),
you can lower it by adding the sodium biphosphate from the test kit, or by
adding de-mineralized water. Remember that pH-lowering chemicals are
phosphate based and can encourage algae growth. 
Testing Hardness (dH)
The degree of hardness (measured by a term called degrees of hardness, or
dH) in water refers to the amount of dissolved mineral salts (mostly magne-
sium and calcium) in your water. The more minerals that are present, the
harder the water. You don’t have to worry about your water’s degree of hard-
ness unless you live in an area where the water is very hard (150+) or very
soft (0–4). You can test for hardness by using a simple hardness test kit avail-
able at your local fish store. 
195
Chapter 14: The Nitrogen Cycle and Water Testing

Some fish like to live in slightly hard water, and others don’t. If you have one
in very hard water that is supposed to live in soft water, it can lead to illness
and death. 
One way to dilute hardness is to add rain or distilled water to your tank.
Another way is to boil the water and let it cool before adding it to your tank.
Both methods lower the pH levels. Extreme hardness is found in alkaline
(high pH) waters. Reverse osmosis units soften aquarium water, but these
units tend to be expensive and use a lot of tap water in order to produce a
small amount of mineral-free water.
You can also use a water softener or add peat moss to your filter (boil the
peat first to remove any unwanted organisms). Hardness can be easily
increased by adding sodium bicarbonate in small amounts at a time (about a
teaspoon per 55 gallons) and then monitoring the change. 
During the conditioning period, closely monitor pH, ammonia, nitrite, and
nitrate levels using standard test kits. Take daily readings. The pH level goes
down as a normal part of the conditioning process. You can raise it again
through frequent water changes if you live in an area with harder water (hard
water and high alkaline levels go together). Allowing the pH to decrease over
a long period of time during the conditioning process keeps helpful bacteria
from multiplying to its full potential. When nitrite and nitrate levels begin to
overstep their limits, daily water changes help alleviate that problem.
Do not use an excess amount of chemicals or medications during the condi-
tioning period because they can potentially damage bacterial growth.
When the conditioning process is complete, you can begin adding a few fish
every week to allow the bacteria bed to increase at a normal rate. If you make
the mistake of immediately overstocking your aquarium, ammonia levels
(ammonia spikes) will gradually build up. To correct this situation, reduce
the number of fish in the tank or add more filtration.
There you have it, the basics of aquarium water. With test kits you can always
be on top of the situation and provide your fish with water to match their
needs.

In This Chapter
 Setting up a freshwater tropical aquarium
 Creating a coldwater aquarium
 Establishing a simple indoor goldfish pond
I
f you are reading this chapter, you have probably purchased most of the
equipment for your new aquarium. If you haven’t, take a look at the first
eight chapters of this book, which cover equipment, substrate, and tanks. But
we’re sure many of you are wondering in what order all those hoses, funny-
looking pieces of tubing, and gadgets all fit into your system. That’s what this
chapter is for.
You are probably crossing your fingers in hopes that we talk about the type
of system that you want to set up. Never fear! We’re going to show you how
to set up a freshwater tropical system, a coldwater system, and an indoor
pond system. You can’t beat that with a stick! 
The setups covered in this chapter are our own personal choices for a begin-
ning hobbyist. You can find many other types of equipment, substrates, and
so on that can be put on these systems, but we want to lead you though the
simple steps of putting together a minimal setup that will work fine and not
cost you mega bucks. Later on, you can add more equipment if you choose to
do so. Part of the excitement of the hobby is learning and trying new things,
and we would not want to take that opportunity away from you by giving you
system setups that are set in stone. Begin with the basics, do your research,
and then let your imagination lead you from there.
Don’t forget to read the directions on every piece of equipment that you pur-
chase. There are a lot of good tips and advice that the manufacturers have
printed out for your convenience. Take advantage of that. These instructions
usually come with pictures and other good information about replacing
broken parts, so don’t be afraid to take a few minutes to scan the enclosed
materials. If the piece of equipment has parts, do a dry run to make sure they
all fit together before you place them in your aquarium.

Setting Up Your Tropical 
Freshwater System
What follows are the basic steps to set up a tropical aquarium. For this exam-
ple, we will be using an undergravel filter, a background, a power filter, and
live plants.
1. Find a good location.
Choose a place that has a solid floor and is away from windows, doors,
and high-traffic areas. Make sure you have adequate electrical outlets
and a handy water supply.
2. Set up the stand.
Place the stand so that it is stable (that is, it doesn’t rock). You can use a
carpenter’s level to accomplish this goal. Lay the level along the length
of the stand to make sure that it is completely level. If not, use hardwood
shims (available at hardware stores) to level the stand by placing them
one at a time under the legs. 
Make sure you leave room behind the stand for hanging equipment and
leave enough room for yourself to do cleaning and maintenance. 
3. Clean out your tank.
Clean out your aquarium with clear water and a soft sponge. Do not use
soap or other chemicals! Make sure you dry the outside of the glass with
paper towels to avoid streaks that may be hard to reach after the system
is completely set up.
4. Place the aquarium on the stand.
Make sure that the tank fits properly on the stand. Do not allow any of
the tank’s bottom edges to hang over. If you want, you can place a thin
sheet of Styrofoam underneath the tank to cushion it and even out
minor changes in level.
5. Add a background.
If you want to add a background, now would be the time to tape it onto
the back of the tank so that you don’t have to work it around the equip-
ment and cords later. 
Another option is to paint the back glass on the outside with a roller.
This is a great way to hide any cords or other objects that you don’t
want to show behind the tank. Apply two coats of paint and make sure
that it is completely dry before you continue. Take care not to splash
any paint into the interior of the tank as it can be toxic. You can cover
198
Part III: Water, Chemicals, and Plants 

the top of the tank with a towel while painting. We like to use an ocean
blue paint for the back of our tanks, as it allows the fish to show their
true colors and helps reflect lighting. Midnight blue and black look great,
too.
6. Install an undergravel filter.
Now is the time to put in your undergravel filter, before the substrate is
laid down.
Lay the perforated plastic plates on the bottom of the tank. Put the plas-
tic uplift tubes in place over the large holes in the plate. Put an airstone
connected to air-line tubing down inside of the plastic uplift tubes. Most
undergravel caps have a hole that the air-line tubing passes through.
Place the caps on top of the uplift tubes. Connect the air-line hosing to
an air pump. Do not plug in the pump yet!
7. Wash and add your substrate.
Wash gravel with clear water. You can use a colander to rinse the gravel.
Set the colander over a bucket and rinse the gravel under water until the
overflow is clean. This will remove dirt, dust, and excess dye. 
Put two inches of gravel over the undergravel filter plate. Slope the
gravel so that it is about one half an inch higher in the rear.
8. Add a powerfilter.
On this system we are going to add a powerfilter (see Chapter 6) to
make the total filtration system complete. Place the filter on the tank by
hanging it on the outside of the rear glass. The intake tube should hang
inside of the aquarium. Rinse the filter pads under clear water and place
them in the slots inside the filter. Do not plug the unit in yet!
9. Fill the tank up 2⁄3 of the way with water.
This allows you to arrange the gravel if it has moved during filling and
provide leeway to add decorations later without spilling water out of the
tank. 
Pour the water into the aquarium by letting it splash on top of a small
plate that is resting underwater on top of the gravel. This will make sure
that the water does not move the gravel and decorations all around
while you are filling the tank. Make sure the water is the correct temper-
ature for your species.
10. Install the heater.
Install a submersible heater at an angle along the rear piece of glass. If
you are using a non-submersible heater, attach it onto the rim of the
tank. 
Do not plug in the heater yet!
199
Chapter 15: Putting It All Together

11. Put the thermometer on the tank.
Hang a hanging thermometer on the rim of the tank or stick a floating
thermometer in one corner of the tank. If you have a stick-on thermome-
ter, stick it on to the outside of the glass. We like to place these on the
side of the tank in one corner so that they do take away from the front
view. 
12. Add decorations.
Add rocks, driftwood, and other decorations.
13. Fill the aquarium.
Add water until the aquarium water is at the same level as the bottom
edge of the aquarium frame that wraps around the top of the glass.
14. Add dechlorinator to the water. 
Follow the instructions on the product for the correct amount.
15. Plug in all the equipment and set the heater to the correct tempera-
ture for the fish and plants you are going to purchase.
Add water from the tank to the powerfilter to prime it if necessary.
16. Check the pH.
Use a test kit to test the pH of the water. If it is okay continue on. If not
adjust it until it is correct.
17. Put the hood on top of the tank.
18. Add lighting if you have strip lighting separate from a hood or top
glass.
Place the light on top of the tank and plug it in.
19. Let the aquarium run for 24–48 hours.
20. Do a pH and temperature check and then adjust as needed.
21. Add live plants.
Bury plant roots in the gravel. Place taller plants in the back and shorter
plants up front. You may have to take a little water out of the tank so
that it doesn’t flow over while you are planting.
22. Put in your starter fish. 
Just a few small ones! Don’t go overboard!
There you have it in a nutshell. Remember that you must monitor your water
conditions daily (using test kits you buy at aquariums shops) to keep an eye
on ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels until the tank has finished cycling. You
can start to slowly add more fish after the chemical levels stabilize and check
the conditions once a week thereafter. Be patient during this process!

Setting Up Your Coldwater System
Sure, tropicals are great, but there is a lot of beauty to be found in coldwater
species as well. What follows are the basic steps to set up a coldwater aquar-
ium. For this example we will be using a bio-wheel and artificial plants
1. Find a good location.
Choose a place that has a solid floor and is away from windows, doors,
and high traffic areas. Make sure that you have adequate electrical out-
lets and a handy water supply.

under clear water and place them in the slots inside the filter. Place the
bio-wheels in their marked slots. Do not plug the unit in yet!
8. Fill the tank up 2⁄3 of the way with water.
This will allow you to arrange the gravel if it has moved during filling
and provide enough water to add decorations later. 
Pour the water into the aquarium by letting it splash on top of a small
plate that is resting underwater on top of the gravel. This will make sure
that the water does not move the gravel and decorations all around
while you are filling the tank. 
9. Add decorations.
Add rocks, driftwood, plastic plants, and other decorations.
10. Fill the aquarium.
Add water until the aquarium water is at the same level as the bottom
edge of the aquarium frame that wraps around the top of the glass.
11. Add declorinator to the water.
This is not always needed with two-day wait time on fish, but it never
hurts to add it anyway.
12. Plug in all the equipment. 
13. Add water to the bio-wheel unit if it is not self-starting to start it.
14. Check the pH and adjust as needed.
15. Put the hood and lights on the tank.
16. Let the tank run for 24–48 hours and retest pH. Adjust as needed.
17. Put in your starter coldwater fish.

Setting Up Your Simple Indoor 
Goldfish Pond
A good place for this pond would be on an enclosed patio or in a finished
basement. For this setup, we will be using a half whiskey barrel with a sub-
mersible pond filter: 
1. Place your half whiskey barrel in a level area that is free from win-
dows and drafts.
2. Add the pond liner.
If it is pre-fit barrel liner, just set it in place. If you have to make your
own, use a flexible liner and fit it into the barrel, allowing the excess to
hang over the edges.
3. Fill the barrel with water, leaving about six inches at the top.
4. Add several inches of gravel or smooth river stones to the bottom and
set your pond filter down into the barrel after attaching it to your
pump.
5. Add dechlorinator and then trim off the excess liner.
You can tack the end of the liner six inches below the rim on the outside
using a staple gun.
6. Place your pond plants in the pond.
Add a few floaters to start with. For stand-up plants, you can use over-
turned clean flowerpots as a base to raise the level of your plants.
7. Plug in your pump and add a top.
There are several ways to add a top to the barrel, but our favorite way is
to have a lumberyard cut a heavy board in the shape of a circle with a
large donut hole in the middle. Simply set the board on top and you’ll
have a little rim around the opening to place decorations and small
rocks. This also covers the overhanging liner.
8. Let the pond run for 24–48 hours then add your starter goldfish.
203
Chapter 15: Putting It All Together

One Last Thing
Don’t forget that there are many different variations you use on equipment
for your aquarium or small indoor pond. Make sure to follow the manufac-
turer’s instructions on all equipment as you go along. If you still have prob-
lems, your local fish store will be happy to help. 
Be bold and experiment with different combinations of equipment. Take time
to research your fish and plants and add them slowly over time (a couple a
month) so that your system remains stable. Remember not to overstock.

 Experimenting with planting techniques
L
ive plants are one of the most overlooked but truly wonderful aspects of
the aquarium hobby.
Plants come in a wide variety of sizes, shapes, colors, and densities. Living
plants offer a unique and natural beauty that cannot be achieved with artifi-
cial substitutes. All you need to enjoy live aquatic plants are proper water
conditions, good lighting, and a little patience. Take time to bring your fish a
step closer to their natural environment with live plants, and they will love
you for it!
Live plants are a lot of fun, look cool, and help boost your image as a serious
hobbyist. What better reasons can you think of to keep them in your aquar-
ium? Actually, there are a lot of other good reasons to keep live plants, as you
will learn in this chapter. Unfortunately, many small fish shops don’t carry
live plants, and even if they do, they may have limited stock. If your local
dealer does not have the plants you are looking for, ask about special orders.
Many aquatic shops have access to live plants but only order them on
demand because of limited tank space.
The Internet can save you, too! You can find an entire aquatic forest just by
cruising the cyber highway for an hour or so. Here are a couple Web sites to
get you started:

If you don’t have a computer, borrow your neighbor’s for a while (tell her
you’re doing international biological research). 
What Live Plants Do for Your Aquarium
You can use live plants to enhance the natural look of your freshwater aquar-
ium, and they can be very beneficial and beautiful at the same time. Plants
can produce a calming affect (both for you and your fish) and help maintain a
natural, biological balance in your aquarium. Don’t get us wrong. Many hob-
byists aquascape their aquariums with artificial plants and are perfectly
happy with the outcome. Then again, many hobbyists use plastic plants
because they don’t have the knowledge to maintain live aquatic plants suc-
cessfully, or don’t have the time to care for them. 
Certain species of fish destroy any live plants you may put into your tank, so in
certain situations artificial plants are much more beneficial than the real
McCoy. Artificial plants are only slightly less costly than live plants, so don’t let
cost alone affect your decision. If you really want live plants but are on a lim-
ited budget, just start out with a few and add them when you are able to grab a
bit of aquatic “mad money.” (See Chapter 17 for a lot more on plant species.)
If you do choose to use artificial plants, try not to get too carried away in the
color department. Plastic plants are manufactured in every color under the
sun. If your tank ends up with shocking pink plants on one side, black in the
front, and red and green striped ones in the back, your fish may think they’ve
crash-landed at Woodstock. They may die from sheer fright or become color-
blind (okay, just kidding). Even though they pose no real physical danger,
loudly colored plants can keep your fish from spawning on a continual basis
and may cause them to hide in the corners of your aquarium.
A well-planted aquarium:
 Offers good shelter for pregnant females who want to escape from
aggressive mates
 Supplies shade and cooler temperatures during the warmer months
 Helps protect small and shy fish from bullying tankmates
 Provides a safe refuge for all your delicate and long-finned fish that may
otherwise end up on the aquatic lunch menu

 Inhibits algae growth by providing resource competition. Plants use the
excess nutrients in the water to thrive. These are the same nutrients
that algae need to survive. Plants help “starve” algae production by
keeping them from having enough nutrients to flourish.
Live plants can condition the water in your tank by removing carbon dioxide
and sulfur substances and by harboring bacteria to remove other wastes.
The biological filtration (provided by the bacteria) in an aquarium breaks
down existing ammonia into less harmful substances that live plants use for
food. Plants can use these nitrites and nitrates to gather life-giving nitrogen.
By utilizing light during photosynthesis, plants also create food for them-
selves within their own cells and release oxygen, which is very beneficial to
your fish, during the process (Figure 16-1). When you turn off your aquarium
lights, plants start absorbing oxygen. They then release carbon dioxide in a
process similar to your fish’s respiration process.
Living plants can also be a food source for fish that prefer a high amount of
vegetation in their diet (of course you’ll have to continually replace plants as
they get munched). Your fish’s color is much more intense in a naturally
planted tank. And because plants provide security, your aquatic pets also act
much more confident in a planted tank. (They won’t have to spend the entire
day trying to dig an escape tunnel.)

Chapter 16: Live Plants for Freshwater Aquariums

Plant Types
You can find three basic types of plants in an aquarium shop: aquatic, mar-
ginal, and terrestrial. Unfortunately, many dealers sell terrestrial (grow-in-the-
earth) plants as aquatic plants. Each type of plant is unique in its requirements
for survival and growth, so you need to know exactly which species you can
accommodate before you purchase any plants. Make sure each plant type is
labeled correctly before you take it home! (Chapter 17 gives you good exam-
ples of live aquatic plants that you can enjoy in your home aquarium without
having to worry about them too much.)
Aquatic plants can be entirely submerged beneath the water line of your tank
and still survive. These plants die when they are removed from the water.
Sagittaria (Sagittaria natans) and pygmy sword (Echinodorus quadricostatus)
are two good examples of aquatic plants.
Marginal plants spend only part of their time submerged beneath the water.
These types of plants flower and seed out of water during the dry periods of
the year. Examples of marginal plants include cryptocoryne (Cryptocoryne
balansae). Marginal plants require special handling and should be left in the
hands of expert hobbyists.
Terrestrial plants live on land and do not survive very long if they’re completely
submerged. We do not recommend them for use in the home aquarium.
Let’s proceed to the more common kinds of aquatic plants, the ones that are
used most in home aquariums.
Floating plants
Floating plants do not anchor themselves and drift around the top of your
aquarium. Floating plants can grow very quickly, so you need to thin them
out — or prune them — when they become too thick and bushy. If you don’t,
they may block out the light that enters your aquarium from the hood. The
resulting loss of light can lower the temperature of your aquarium water,
which has a devastating effect on the health of your fish and plants. Floating
plants reproduce easily by sprouting young daughter plants and propagating
new plants from severed pieces. Use floating plants in spawning tanks to hide
young fry.
One plant in particular, duckweed (lemna), multiplies so rapidly that your
tank may look like the lights have burnt out permanently. Avoid buying duck-
weed unless you have time to prune it back. Another floating plant is the
water lettuce (Pistia stratiotes). 
208
Part III: Water, Chemicals, and Plants 

Rooted plants
Rooted plants anchor themselves in the substrate and draw part of their
nourishment through their leaves, and part through their roots. Rooted
plants reproduce by creating runners (slender plant shoots) that branch off
of the main stem. These runners eventually reroot and form new plants or
sprout young shoots out of existing leaf surfaces. Many species of rooted
plants can grow very large, so use caution when choosing the correct species
for your particular tank.
Potted plants come with a small receptacle around the roots and are often
raised in humid nurseries. With this type of plant, you have the option of sub-
merging the entire basket in the substrate or removing the basket and plant-
ing the roots directly. If you leave the basket intact, the plant’s roots will grow
through the basket’s holes and then anchor themselves in the substrate.
We remove the baskets so that they don’t show above the substrate level
when rooting fishes begin digging around them. Unless you have ten feet of
gravel in your tank, these horrid baskets always seem to find a way to show
off and emerge into the limelight.
Removing the basket often reveals several small plants combined into one
tight group. Carefully separate each individual plant from the others around
it. Plant each of these little cuttings in the substrate separately. Remember
that these plants are not full grown, so you need to allow ample space for
them to spread out.
Cuttings
Many varieties of plants are sold in aquarium stores as cuttings. Cuttings
often grow very rapidly as they gather nourishment through their leaves. A
group of small cuttings (plants too small to stand alone) can be bunched up
together with aquarium weights (which you can purchase from your local
fish dealer) and planted until they begin to root on their own. After they
begin to grow a bit, you can separate them from each other.
Easy plant species
Some plants are a little easier to grow and keep than others. (You will find
even more detailed information on plants, including some illustrations, in
Chapter 17.)
209
Chapter 16: Live Plants for Freshwater Aquariums

The following are suggestions on freshwater plants that are good for beginners:
 Dwarf swordplant (Echinodorus tenellus): Use this in the front area of
your tank to create a carpet effect.
 Corkscrew val (Vallisneria spiralis): Corkscrew val’s light green leaves
are twisted like a spiral staircase. Val needs quite a bit of light.
 Hornwart (Ceratophyllum demersum): Hornwart has very stiff leaves.
 Hairgrass (Eleocharis acicularis): Hairgrass resembles the grass in
your yard but is longer (our house being an exception).
 Amazon sword (Echinodorus grandiflorus): Amazon sword has heart-
shaped leaves and is very tolerant of beginner mistakes. This plant
enjoys soft water.
 Java fern (Microsorium pteropus): Java fern has large leaves that form
a point at the top and requires only moderate lighting conditions.
And if you decide to attempt a brackish aquarium, here are a few easy-to-
keep brackish plants:
 Green cabomba (Cabomba caroliniana): A plant with soft leaves and
foliage resembles feather wisps.
 Mangrove (Brugiuera species): Usually purchased in pots, this plant
spreads out all over the tank.
 Giant hygrophila (Nomaphila stricta): A beautiful plant that produces
a purple flower.
Maintaining Plant-Friendly 
Aquarium Conditions
To keep your plants healthy, you need to provide them with the proper tem-
perature, nutritional food, proper substrate, good water conditions, and ade-
quate lighting.
Temperature requirements
Plants have temperature requirements just like your fish do. Check each
species’ temperature requirements before you purchase them, so you know
whether they’re compatible with your fish’s needs. A large majority of aquar-
ium plants are tropical and need to be kept warm — they eventually die in
cold water.
210
Part III: Water, Chemicals, and Plants 

While you’re checking out a shop’s tropical plants, see whether they are
being kept in warm tanks. If they’re kept in cold water, they probably won’t
survive very long after you place them in your home aquarium. 
Substrate for rooting
Live plants prefer a one- to two-inch deep substrate that consists of fine
gravel or coarse sand (1⁄16 inch to 1⁄8 inch is great). This type of substrate
allows water to move through plant roots so that they can gather nutrients. It
also provides plants with the space they need for their roots to fork out as
they grow.
Filtration
Clean water is very important for successful plant growth in your aquarium.
Dirt and debris settle on the surface of the leaves and clog the plant’s pores.
Keep plant leaves clean by gently brushing them with a soft toothbrush that
you keep for plant aquarium use only. If your aquarium water gets too dirty,
the amount of energy-giving light is drastically reduced. Water changes and
vacuuming the water help correct the problem.
Try to use filtration that doesn’t pump tons of air bubbles into the water,
which drives out the CO2 your plants need. A power filter or canister filter
would be the best bets for a plant-heavy tank setup.
Feeding
The tap water in your aquarium doesn’t have the necessary trace elements
and nutrients your plants need for proper growth. You can put tablets and
liquid feeders (which provide nutrients, found at your local pet shop) in the
gravel near the plant’s roots for fertilization — best done after a water
change. You can also place a single cutting in the center of a plug, which pro-
vides nutrition on a continual basis. You then bury the plug in the gravel.
Here is a good site to take a look at plugs:
www.aq-products.com/Catalog/Plants/Plant%20Plugs.htm
Do not use household plant fertilizers in your aquarium because they contain
extremely high amounts of phosphates, which are bad for fish.
211
Chapter 16: Live Plants for Freshwater Aquariums

Lighting
Tropical plants require a constant source of light during the day in order to
grow properly. Most tropical plants should receive at least eight hours of
light each day. Planted tanks require more intense lighting than fish-only
aquariums, but your fish probably won’t mind an opportunity to get a bit of
an extra tan now and then.
On the other hand, some plants such as the Amazon sword and the Java fern
prefer low lighting situations. Check the requirements of each species before
you buy so you get plants that will survive under the same lighting conditions. 
You can use a plant-growth light, which provides the proper light spectrum
plants need. You can also control the amount of light your plants receive by
using a simple timer on your aquarium light so that peak intensity remains
the same each day.
One way to compensate for the different lighting requirements between plant
species, if you choose to mix them, is to place taller plants so that they shade
the shorter species that thrive in low-light levels.
Supplements
One of the most important supplements for plants is iron because plants use
it to produce chlorophyll, necessary for photosynthesis. Make sure you get
an iron supplement for your plant tanks. You can find them on most aquatic
Internet plant sites and in some fish stores.
Purchasing and Transporting Your Plants
If you’re fortunate enough to live in an area where the local pet shops stock a
wide variety of live plants, you need to know how to get them home safely. If pos-
sible, always purchase your plants from a dealer (in town or on the Internet).
Taking from the wild
You can collect plants from small bodies of water, such as ponds, but take a few
precautions if you choose to do this. Make sure the plants in your area match
the water conditions that will be in your aquarium. Any plants you take from
the wild must be carefully cleaned in clear, cool water with a toothbrush to
avoid introducing disease and aquatic pests such as snails and parasites.
212
Part III: Water, Chemicals, and Plants 

Before you go yanking up any plants at your local stream, make sure that their
removal won’t have any detrimental effects on the natural environment. You
should also check with local authorities about endangered species and other
regulations to ensure that your liberation of the plants doesn’t cause your own
removal from home to jail.
Buying from a dealer
Before purchasing any live plants, you should have a good idea of which
types and sizes best suit your project. Write out a list that includes the total
number of plants you need to reach the design effects you desire. It is possi-
ble that your local fish shop won’t have all the plants you’re searching for.
Include substitute species on your shopping list just in case the shop cannot
order them for you.
Start out by purchasing just a few of the plants on your list. Remember that
plants usually grow very quickly. If you buy too many in the beginning, your
aquarium may end up looking like an Amazon rainforest in a couple of weeks.
If your gardener has to come in and trim your aquarium plants back so you
can open your front door, you may want to thin them out a bit. One general
formula to obtain the total number of plants for your aquarium is to calculate
one plant for every six square inches of gravel area. Simply multiply the
length of the aquarium by the width (in inches) and divide by six to get the
number of plants you need.
You also need to use a little common sense when you buy your plants. Some
species are naturally “fuller” than others and take up quite a bit more space.
After you become familiar with a particular plant species, you’ll have a better
idea of how much room the plants occupy when they are full grown (see
Chapter 17 for more).
Getting plants home in one piece
To maintain your plants’ good health, you need to make sure that they don’t
dry out on the way home from the shop. Ask your dealer to bag your plants
in water or carefully wrap each one in wet newspaper. If it’s cold out, trans-
port your new plants in a cooler so that the water remains warm. 
Achieving acclimation
When you arrive home, place your plants in a pan of water that contains a 10
percent solution of potassium permanganate. Potassium permanganate is a
substance that kills unwanted germs and disinfects plant surfaces. If you
213
Chapter 16: Live Plants for Freshwater Aquariums

cannot find this solution in your local pet store, clean the plants under room-
temperature water by gently brushing them with a soft toothbrush as men-
tioned previously. Trim all cuttings to the correct height for your tank and
remove any dead or wilted leaves with a sharp pair of scissors.
Never pinch off or tear dead plant pieces with your fingers — you may
damage the delicate tissues!
Plants need time to acclimate to their new home. Don’t expect them to flour-
ish in a day. Some plants may lose leaves and struggle before taking a firm
hold in their new environment, so give them a month or so to make them-
selves at home.
Plant Problems
Even the best hobbyist’s green thumb turns black once in a while. Hey, no
one is perfect! Fortunately, plant diseases in aquariums are really rare, so
don’t get too worked up at the thought of all your beautiful sword plants kick-
ing the bucket at the same time. If your plants are growing at a normal pace
and are developing new shoots and buds, they’re probably in good health.
Signs of poor plant health
Knowing how to recognize and cure foliage problems before they become too
severe can help you avoid losing your new aquatic plants. Here are some
warning signs to look for when carrying out your daily aquarium mainte-
nance routine:
 Your plants have holes in them. This problem is often caused by fish
nibbling on the leaves. If your fish are vegetarians, and you provided the
plants as a food source, get used to losing plants. If your plants begin to
fall apart after the holes appear, they may be suffering from rot, which is
usually caused by excess nitrates in the aquarium. Water changes help
correct this problem.
 Your plants’ leaves are turning yellow. They may be suffering from an
iron deficiency. Aquatic plant fertilizer with iron (such as Hagen Nutrafin
Plant Gro Iron Enriched Aquatic Plant Fertilizer) solves this problem.
 The leaves have turned brown or black. This indicates decay, probably
caused by too much iron. Water changes help this problem.
214
Part III: Water, Chemicals, and Plants 

 Some plants are dying, and some are surviving. Hard-water plants are
better able to extract CO2 from the water, whereas soft-water plants
have a harder time. Make sure you have enough CO2 in your aquarium
water for each type.
If you want to keep different types of plants together, try adding CO2
(through water change or pressurized CO2 equipment available at pet shops)
to the tank. Different areas of the country have different amounts of CO2 in
the tap water. Note that adding CO2 to the tank lowers the pH. Pressurized
CO2 systems are nice but can be expensive. To avoid this, keep plants with
similar requirements together.
Algae
No matter what you do, you always have some type of algae in your aquarium
system. Algae is often introduced into your aquarium by fish and live food.
But, if you keep healthy plants in your system, algae doesn’t stand much of a
chance.
If your algae gets out of control, though, look out! Blue-green algae (caused
by poor water conditions) can form a layer on all of your decorations and
substrate, and if your fish stop swimming for a few minutes, they start to
resemble a moldy cupcake. Red algae, which is caused by a lack of CO2 in the
water, is really nasty and hangs in threads all over your aquarium. Extra
oxygen can be added to battle the red algae, but often a tank must be cleaned
and restarted if it gets out of control. Brown algae (caused by inadequate
light) forms huge brown layers in your aquarium. Green algae (caused by too
much light) makes your aquarium water look like pea soup.
A good way to battle algae in your aquarium is to add algae-eating fish, such
as the Siamese algae eater (Crossocheilus siamensis) or the bushy-nosed
pleco (Ancistrus sp.). These fish help keep algae populations under control
naturally. Don’t depend on algae-eating fish to solve your problem alone,
though. They couldn’t eat that many algae in a million years.
Algae grows quickly in a cycled tank, but eventually the plants declare war on
it and remove the nutrients that it needs to survive. Do not change your
water when algae becomes very intense — that can lead to an even bigger
problem. If your plants are in good condition, they will eventually win the
algae war. Use algae-eating fish and keep your water conditions pristine. The
combo will keep your tank looking great.
215
Chapter 16: Live Plants for Freshwater Aquariums

Medications
Aquarium salt, copper medications, and metal-based treatments can be very
harmful to your plants. Make sure your new fish are quarantined so that you
will not have to medicate them if they become ill after arriving home. If your
fish do require medication, treat them in a separate hospital tank away from
your live plants.
Planting Techniques
It is a whole lot easier to put live plants in your tank after you add the water.
Arranging plants in a dry aquarium can be a very difficult job. All they do is
look limp and fall over. Lock your front door until all the decorating is com-
plete. That way, you can work undisturbed and then look cool when all is said
and done. A full aquarium allows you a better view of the plants after they
spread out into the water.
Don’t push a plant into the gravel below its crown (the area between the
plant’s stalk and the roots). Space plants far enough apart so that they have
room to spread their roots and grow properly. The distance between them
should be approximately equal to the span of one leaf. A crowded tank
causes the plants to wither and die.
One of the best strategies is to place all of your tall plants near the back of
the tank. Fill the center of the aquarium with short or bushy plants. Use taller
plants that spread out (such as elodea) to hide heaters, undergravel filter
tubes, and other unsightly equipment. Place small plants near the front of the
glass. Try to arrange your plants so that they don’t look too symmetrical (the
same on both sides of the tank) because they normally don’t grow that way
in nature.
Sketch a picture of how you want your tank to look before you start planting,
so that you have a simple plan to follow. If you continually remove and
replant the little shoots that grow out of a main stem, the parent plant grows
faster.
Nothing is as astounding looking as an aquarium with live plants. If you have
the chance to try out live plants, don’t hesitate to add them to your aquar-
ium. The benefits to your fish and natural underwater system far out weigh
the slightly higher cost in terms of finance and time that are needed to keep
plants healthy.

I
n Chapter 16 we discuss plant types, the aquarium conditions required 
for live plants, how to purchase plants and transport them, and how to
troubleshoot problems that may occur. This chapter covers different types 
of plants that you can put in your tank and maintain as a beginner.
Live plants add realism to your aquarium!
The species listed in this chapter are by no means all that are available.
There are too many to name in one chapter, so we focus our attention on
some of the really cool-looking ones that you can use to enhance your own
special aquarium setup.
Don’t be afraid to experiment with different types of plants to see what is
most pleasing to your own eye. Purchase plants that you really like, but don’t
forget to make sure that they will work well with the aquarium conditions and
habits of your aquarium fish.
As mentioned in the last chapter, live plants help enhance the natural beauty
of your tank, reduce algae problems, improve the water quality, and provide
your fish with places to hide and find shelter. Live aquarium plants are also a
great way to help condition and nudge your fish into mating. 
Don’t overstock your tank with plants to the point that your fish have no
swimming room! Overplanting causes stress and disease. If you want a good
setup that looks natural, it should include a variety of plants and open spaces
as well.

Foreground Plants
All aquariums look good with foreground plants, and by that we mean smaller
plants placed toward the front and middle of your aquarium. The last thing
you want to do is have your tank look like it is just lined all around the out-
side with live plants. You need shorter plants in the front and center of the
tank to compliment taller ones toward the rear and add variety to the aqua-
scaped décor.
Cryptocoryne (Cryptocoryne wendetti) 
This species is a beautiful plant that has long leaves resembling a garden
trowel. The leaves are green with red-tinted areas. This plant is great for
tanks that are cycled (see Chapter 14 for more on the nitrogen cycle). In the
wild this plant grows on riverbanks and uses rhizomes for growth, so tie it 
off to driftwood or rocks with plastic gardening ties.
This plant requires a lot of nutrition. This is why placing this in an aged
(cycled) tank will keep this species happy. Placing it in a new aquarium may
cause it to die from lack of nutrition if you don’t use any type of plant food
supplement.
Don’t be concerned if this plant looks like it struggling a bit and loses leaves
when you first add it to your aquarium. That is normal in many cases. This
plant tends to grow rather slowly and is great for smaller tanks.

Aquarium lighting levels
So that you have a good idea what is meant by
low, medium, bright, and very bright lighting,
here is a guide:
Low: 1 to 2 watts per gallon
Medium: 2 to 3 watts per gallon
Bright: 3 to 5 watts per gallon
Very bright: 5 or more watts per gallon

Baby tears (Micranthemum umbrosum)
Baby tears (Figure 17-1) is an amazing plant that is very fast growing and covers
surfaces like a carpet. For this reason, it is recommended that you use it for
larger tanks (over 30 gallons). In good conditions, this plant spreads like wild-
fire, so you will need to prune it back from time to time unless you want your
aquarium to look like an uncut back lot or the front steps of a funeral home.
This plant also grows well if you allow it to float, and many species of fish just
don’t seem to like the taste of it, making it a good one to purchase if you have
fish that like to nibble on foliage too much. Baby tears is also very hardy and
seems to be able to put up with beginner’s mistakes.
This plant has delicate little clusters of slightly round leaves (shaped, not sur-
prisingly, like a baby’s tear) that are a beautiful light green color. CO2 addition
is recommended for the best growth, but it will survive without CO2 added.

Pearl grass is a very graceful-looking plant that is great for the foreground 
of your aquarium. This species is light green and has half-elliptical shaped
leaves. As this plant grows, you will see it developing side shoots (in time 
you will come to think of them as runners) in all directions. You can easily
prune this plant so it continues to grow and fill in the gaps that you want it 
to cover up.
Level: Easy
Temperature: 68–82 degrees F
Light: Medium to bright
PH : 5.0–7.5
Placement: Foreground 
Brazilian micro sword (Lilaeopsis
brasiliensis)
This South American plant is an interesting-looking species that resembles
thick green grass. The thickness can be a problem, as it will encourage algae
to grow all over it. The best thing to do is to thin the plant out by pruning
interior leaves (the thick leaves inside the outer leaves) so that light and
water can reach all of the plant’s surfaces. Once you have thinned the plant
out, carefully rinse it under room-temperature water to remove any excess
debris before adding it to your aquarium.
One trick we use to keep this plant from becoming a big bound-up ball is 
to keep it in areas of the tank that have high circulation (near airstones or
filter return water). This slow-growing plant does really well in fine substrate
such as sand and eventually will look like you have a lawn growing in your
aquarium.
Level: Moderate
Temperature: 60–79 degrees F 
Light: Very bright
PH : 6.0–8.0
Placement: Foreground

Madagascar lace (Aponogeton 
fenestralis)
This species is dark green and has leaves that look like they are made out of a
lace tablecloth. It is fascinating to watch this plant sway in a light water cur-
rent. Because algae tends to gather in the latticework of the leaves, having
algae eaters in your tank will be beneficial to this plant.
Once this plant gains height it can be moved to the back of the tank.
Level: Easy
Temperature: 60–75 degrees F 
Light: Very bright
PH: 5.5–6.8
Placement: Foreground to mid-range
Dwarf anubias (Anubias nana)
This is a wonderful plant for beginners because it seems to thrive even in less
than perfect water conditions.
This slow-growing plant has broad green leaves that add a wonderful splash
of color to any aquarium. It also uses rhizomes for nutrients and likes being
tied to driftwood so that water can flow around it. It does not need to be
embedded in gravel.
Make sure that this plant is not kept in direct sunlight or under strong artifi-
cial lighting.
Level: Easy
Temperature: 59–79 degrees F 
Light: Low
PH: 5.5–6.8
Placement: Foreground to mid-range on driftwood and rocks

Background Plants
Background plants are important for rounding out an aquarium aquascape.
These plants can also help cover up unsightly filter tubes, airline tubing, and
heaters in the rear of the tank. A spreading background plant that is placed in
the front corner of a tank can also add an interesting aspect to the scene.
Experiment and see what looks good to you!
Hornwort (CeratopHyllum demersum)
Hornwort (Figure 17-2) is one of the most popular aquarium plants on the
market. It does not have real roots, but can be planted in gravel. This fast-
growing, beautiful plant has green featherlike appendages that reach skyward
like upside down umbrellas waiting to catch the rain.

Part III: Water, Chemicals, and Plants 

This plants consumes a lot of nutrients and is an enemy to algae because it
secrets a substance that is not good for its rival. It has bright green leaves
that are stiff.
Level: Easy
Temperature: 50–80 degrees F 
Light: Does well in any lighting condition
PH: 6.0–8.0
Placement: Background or can be used as a floating plant
Corkscrew val (Vallisneria spiralis)
Corkscrew val is a unique fast-growing Asian plant that resembles a corkscrew.
There is no other plant that seems to stimulate the imagination like this
species does when it is gently swaying in water current. Corkscrew val can be
a bit difficult to keep alive when it is very small, so try to obtain larger plants
with well-established roots if possible.
Level: Moderate
Temperature: 59–86 degrees F 
Light: Does well in any lighting condition
PH: 6.0–8.0
Placement: Background
Elodea (Egeria densa)
Elodea (Figure 17-3) is great for beginners because it grows very quickly. This
plant also secretes substances that help to discourage algae. Elodea grows
very thick in bright light and is a good way to fill in the background. This
plant can also float, removes large amounts of nitrates, has roots, and flowers
under good condition.
Level: Easy
Temperature: 50–79 degrees F 
Light: Bright 
PH: 5.0–8.0
Placement: Background
223

Carolina fanwort (Cambomba 
caroliniana)
This species is a beautiful light green plant that has a feathery or wispy
appearance. This is another great plant for hiding background spots, 
and fish seem to love to nibble on it.
The problem is, the leaves come off very easily, so if you have nibblers you
may find an annoying number of plucked leaves floating all over your tank.
These leaves will tend to clog up your filters as well.
This fast-growing plant loves soft, acidic waters and is stunning when planted
in groups of three or more. Make sure you have enough gravel to keep it
down, because this plant seems to float up quite a bit.
Level: Moderate
Temperature: 75–82 degrees F 
Light: Very bright
PH: 4.0–7.0
Placement: Background
Giant anubias (Anubias barteri)
This slow growing plant (Figure 17-4) can grow up to 15 inches tall and makes
a great background plant. This plant has very tough leaves and stems so it is
Figure 17-3:
Elodea is a
very good
choice for

224
Part III: Water, Chemicals, and Plants 

a great species to use for cichlids and other plant aggressive fish. The rhi-
zome should be above gravel, because it shoots down roots to grab nutrients
from the substrate.
Level: Easy
Temperature: 59–79 degrees F 
Light: Low
PH: 5.5–6.8
Placement: Background
Red ludwigia (Ludwigia mullertii)
This beautiful plant has green leaves, with a slight tinge of red, and red
stems. As it matures the red can spread to the leaf edges. Ludwigia grows
very rapidly, so you will soon have a large plant even if you started with a
smaller one. 
This plant also grows side shoots, so you may have to prune it back if it gets
out of control. It has very tiny flowers that can be difficult to see.
Level: Easy
Temperature: 64–77 degrees F 
Light: Very bright
PH: 4.0–7.0

Oriental sword (Echinodorus oriental)
This slow-growing plant (Figure 17-5) has broad red and green leaves that are
shaped like the blade of a sword.
Level: Easy
Temperature: 68-79 degrees F 
Light: Bright
PH: 5.5-7.0
Placement: Mid-range to background
Amazon sword (Echinodorus amazonicus)
This plant gets its name from the fact that it grows naturally in the Amazon,
and the shape of its leaves resemble the blade of a sword. This amazing plant
looks fantastic if you make it the centerpiece of your planted scheme. It will
bloom, so if you can have the blooms above the water line you will be in for a
really pretty treat.

This plant really should be provided with extra CO2 and fertilizer if you want
it to really flourish. The root system on this plant is quite large, so keep an
eye on it to make sure it is not choking out your other plants.
Level: Moderate
Temperature: 72–82 degrees F 
Light: Medium to bright
PH: 6.4–7.2
Placement: Mid-range to background
Red-stem milfoil (MyriopHyllum
matogrossensis)
In our opinion, this is one of the coolest-looking plants you can buy. It looks
like a winter tree that has lost it leaves, except that it is red and pinkish in
color. It grows thickly, and often resembles seaweed with its three to five
feathering leaflets around the stem.
Red-stem milfoil can be anchored to gravel or left to float. It will pretty much
take care of itself, and is great for coldwater systems.
Level: Easy
Temperature: 60–75 degrees F 
Light: Medium
PH: 6.4–7.2
Placement: Background
Stargrass (Heteranthera zosterifolia)
This fast-growing plant has bright mint-green leaves that grow on thick and
numerous stems. Due to the rapid growth and fullness, you will have to prune
it back periodically. The entire plant resembles an aquatic pine tree, and
many aquatic species love to use it as a breeding ground.

Floating Plants
Floating plants are important for aquariums that require dim lighting,
because they block the light from above. They also provide a lot of place for
small fry to hide and provide privacy for mating. Even in setups that don’t
require dim lighting, one small floating plant can give a realistic river or pond
look to your aquarium.
Amazon frogbit (Limnobium laevigatum)
The frogbit plant grows into the shape of a rosette. It will then produce
shoots that will form a tiny plant at the end. Once this end breaks off, it will
become a new plant on its own. The leaves are waxy green and tend to resem-
ble a pond lily. Although it is a floating plant, you want to make sure that the
leaves do not get too close to the aquarium lights, because they are sensitive
to burning. 
Level: Moderate
Temperature: 64–82 degrees F 
Light: Medium to bright
PH: 6.5–7.5
Placement: Floating
Duckweed (Lemna minor)
This is a wonderful fast-growing plant for ponds, because it blocks out a lot of
harmful sunrays that can quickly overheat the water or produce algae.
This plant also provide shelters and is a great incentive for spawning among
its numerous clusters of oval green leaves in an aquarium. You will have to
prune it to keep it from getting out of hand. 
Coldwater and pond fish love to eat this plant, and it provides good nutrition
because it is high in vitamins and minerals. Duckweed is good for your pond’s
water, too, because it helps to absorb excess nutrients and ammonia.

Pond Plants
Pond plants are fun and add realism to any pond.
Water lettuce (Pistia stratiotes)
Water lettuce (Figure 17-6) is a plant that has soft, light-green, ribbed leaves
that are large and round.
The leaves form a rosette. The long, thick roots provide an excellent hiding
place for fish that like to swim near the surface of the aquarium, but it has to
be pruned periodically or it will take over your entire tank or pond. This
plant is also useful for filtering your aquarium water.

Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes)
This plant grows very quickly and will become matted if not pruned.
The shiny green leaves are oval in shape. The plant stalk is thick and keeps
the plant buoyant. It has beautiful purple flowers. This has a huge root
system that fish will love to eat. Fortunately the roots grow faster than the
fish can eat them.

Keeping It Real
There are several reasons for keeping live plants in your aquarium. Live
plants do all of the following:
 Provide natural shelter to make your fish feel safe and secure.
 Provide good places for aquatic species to spawn.
 Help keep light levels down in setups that require dim lighting.
 Provide a good food source for many aquatic species.
 Help to remove nitrates from your aquarium.
 Lend a more realistic look than artificial plants do.
 Reduce CO2 and add oxygen to the tank for your fish.
 Help control algae by competing for the same resources.

What to Do if 
Trouble Strikes
In This Chapter
 Fixing fish problems
 Solving equipment problems
 Mending a broken tank
 Alleviating water problems
E
ven if you are the world’s greatest fish keeper, problems are going to
occur.
No matter what you do, things will go wrong, and at the most inopportune
times. Mother Nature does not always follow our timetable.
The best thing you can do if there is a problem is to have a handy solution at
hand. That is what this chapter is for. We have tried to compile a list of the
most common problems that can happen to or in an aquarium system. This
handy little guide should get you and your aquatic pets through thick and
thin.
Even if you are not having a problem, take the time to read through this chap-
ter to get a good idea what to do if something goes wrong. Keep this chapter
in mind so you can turn to it quickly if needed. We try to keep the solutions
very short and to the point so you don’t have to wade through a bunch of
text in a time of need.
Problems have solutions, so don’t sweat it! Things will go wrong from time to
time, so remember to simply do your best to resolve the issue. Nobody can
ask for more. 

Fish Problems
Most fish problems can be cured if you take time to check your fish out on a
daily basis in order to catch illness, aggression, equipment malfunctions and
feeding problems early. Here are some common problems and what to do.
Check daily to see if your fish have
 Torn, clamped or ragged fins
 Missing scales
 Cloudy eyes
 Unusual white spots or body fungus
These are signs that you need to take immediate action (see Chapter 11 for
details on treating disease in freshwater fish).
What to do until the pet store opens
Put the ill fish in a hospital tank for treatment (see Chapter 11). If you don’t
have chemicals on hand, keep the lights on the hospital tank off to reduce
stress.
Restoring your tank
Make sure your fish remain disease free for two weeks after treatment before
returning them to the tank.
Separating fighting fish
There is no way to guarantee 100 percent compatibility between two fish
until they are placed together. Spats do break out from time to time. If they
happen too often, immediately remove the most aggressive fish by adding
food to the tank to lure it to the top so you can net it. Another option is to
have a Plexiglas insert handy to separate the two fish into opposite sides of
the tank until one can be netted. 
232
Part III: Water, Chemicals, and Plants 

Looking at the injured
Check for torn fins or other bodily injuries such as missing scales after 
a fight. If they do, place them separately in a quiet hospital tank with a 
stress-relief formula and allow them time to heal. Check for disease that 
may develop from the damage.
Solving the aggression problem
As with people, some fish just can’t seem to get along. Try these things:
 If possible, permanently move the aggressive fish to another tank. 
 Rearrange aquarium decorations (rocks, plants, plastic divers) to break
up established territories. Build caves from rocks and give all fish places
to hide.
 Made sure your fish get plenty of food. Fish that are constantly hungry
from lack of proper nutrition tend to fight more.
Correcting Feeding Problems
Often fish won’t eat due to being stressed out from the trip to your home, or
because of problems with other fish in the tank. 
Getting your fish to eat
Fish can lose their appetites. Here are a couple ideas:
 Try giving them frozen brine shrimp or other appropriate aquatic treats
to kick-start them into eating again.
 Rearrange the aquarium decorations to bust down territories that may
be keeping some fish from getting their fair share.
Dislodging items eaten by your fish
Add 1 level teaspoon of Epsom salt for each 10 gallons of water in the 
aquarium.
233
Chapter 18: What to Do if Trouble Strikes

Equipment Problems
If you want your aquarium to function properly, you need to keep your equip-
ment running properly. Here are a few common equipment problems and
their solutions.
Fixing a clogged filter
It’s very important to have a clean filter. Be sure to do these things:
 If your filter uses pads, rinse them under used tank water that you have
removed from the tank and placed in a clean bucket.
 If you are using an undergravel filter, vacuum the gravel.
 Clean all tubes with a filter-cleaning brush.
Analyzing heater problems
Heaters have a way of conking out: Here are some ideas for fixing them:
 If the tank is not staying the proper temperature, make sure you have
enough wattage for your aquarium. (Quick rule of thumb: 5 watts per
gallon.)
 If you have the correct wattage, make sure the heater is not covered 
by plants or other decorations that will stop the flow of warm water
throughout the tank.
 If all else fails, replace the heater.
Lighting falling into the tank
You wouldn’t believe how often this happens. Do this if it does:
1. Put on a rubber kitchen glove (kept in your fish kit!) and unplug the
lighting. 
2. Remove the lighting from the tank and allow it to completely dry 
before plugging it back in. Never remove a light that is underwater 
and plugged in!
234
Part III: Water, Chemicals, and Plants 

Exploding light bulbs
Do the following:
1. Unplug the lighting system.
2. Allow the bulb to cool down completely before removal to avoid 
burning.
3. Gently remove the remaining part of the bulb by wrapping a kitchen
towel around your hand. If the bulb cannot be removed, push a small
potato into the broken bulb socket (screw in bulbs) to grasp and 
remove the light. 
Flickering lighting
If a light is constantly flickering, replace the starter unit. If the bulb continues
to flicker remove the light to make sure the metal connections are dry and
replace. If this does not work, replace the bulb.
Tank Problems
Nothing is worse than a leaking tank. Fortunately there are solutions to this
problem. The important thing to remember is to act quickly.
Checking for leaks
 Make sure the tank itself is leaking by doing an inspection. Sometimes
what appears to be a tank leak is actually an airstone-driven decoration
pushing water over the rim, or a leaking powerfilter.
 If the airstone is causing the leak, shift the decoration until the problem
stops.
 If a powerfilter is leaking from being cracked, replace it.
Getting your fish to safety
If the tank is leaking, immediately remove the fish to another tank. If you
don’t have an extra tank, a large plastic bowl or clean aquarium bucket
works. Add gravel to the bottom of the bowl or bucket, put a few floating
plants in, add an airstone connected to a pump, and cover it with a plate to
keep the fish from jumping out.
235
Chapter 18: What to Do if Trouble Strikes

Repairing a small crack
Follow these steps to repair a small crack:
1. Remove everything from the leaking tank: water, gravel, and equipment.
2. With a safety razor, remove the old silicone from the whole side where
the leak is occurring.
3. Wipe the area dry with a clean cloth.
4. Apply new aquarium sealer to replace the old sealer you removed.
5. Allow the sealer to completely dry (drying time will be listed on the
sealer tube) before adding water.
When an entire side of 
your aquarium breaks
If the entire side of an aquarium breaks, get your fish into a hospital tank or
aquarium bucket as quickly as possible.
If the fish are out of water, use a clean paper towel to gently pick them up, as
the oil and other residue on your hands can damage their scales and fins.
Call a professional glass installer to have the side replaced. Replacing it your-
self is dangerous and risks further leaking. You probably would not replace
broken glass in your home’s picture window, and aquarium glass is even
more of a challenge due to the water pressure that is constantly on it. Let the
professional glass installers handle it. They know what they are doing.
Water Problems
Problems with your water can lead to stress, poor health, and death for your
freshwater friends. Here are a few of the most common water problems and
solutions to get your aquarium back on track.
Solving green algae problems
Green algae — that cloudy green gunk — is a result of having too much light
and dissolved waste in the water. Here’s what to do:
236
Part III: Water, Chemicals, and Plants 

 Cut back on the light.
 Do 10 percent water changes daily until the algae clears up.
 Purchase algae eating fish such as Siamese algae eaters.
Controlling chemical problems
If household chemicals are dumped or spilled into the tank by accident, 
do this:
1. Remove your fish immediately to a hospital tank. 
2. Completely drain your main tank and clean the decorations, tank, and
gravel with warm water before restarting your tank. 
3. Replace any filter material with new material as you are setting up the
tank. 
4. Remember the tank will have to biologically cycle again, so keep an eye
on the situation and add a couple fish for starters (hardy fish, such as
guppies and swordfish) until it has established itself.
Cooling a tank that’s too hot
If your tank gets too warm, follow these steps:
1. Unplug the heater and allow it to remain in the tank. Remove the hood
and replace it with a mesh top (like the ones sold for the tops of reptile
tanks.) Do not remove the heater before it cools down or it can shatter.
Do not remove the fish or you will shock them.
2. If you don’t have an aquarium chiller (a piece of equipment that can be
added to your tank to keep the water cool), put ice into a plastic bag and
float it in the tank to slowly lower the temperature. Never try to lower
the temperature quickly as you will do even more damage to your fish.
3. Add an extra airstone to the tank to increase oxygen because the levels
will have dropped with the higher water temperatures.
4. When the temperature is back to normal, reset your heater and monitor
it closely to make sure it is functioning properly. If it is still not working
correctly, replace it.
237
Chapter 18: What to Do if Trouble Strikes

Warming a tank that’s too cold
If your tank gets too warm, follow these steps:
1. Put a hot water bottle in a plastic bag and float it in the tank to warm it.
Do not remove the fish or you will shock them.
2. Make sure the heater is functioning and slowly raise the temperature
back to normal. (A couple degrees per hour is best.)

Fun Stuff

In this part . . .
You will find out about the exciting and rewarding
world of fish breeding, how to do it and what to
watch out for when your pets are spawning. In other

of fishkeeping, such as photographing your fish, compet-
ing in fish shows, and the enticing brackish and saltwater
worlds that may lie beyond for you.

In This Chapter
 Reasons to breed your fish
 Finding the right equipment
 Making use of plants
 Looking at water conditions
 Getting your fish in the mood
T
he first thing you need to know about breeding your fish is that there is
no perfect way to breed any single species of fish. Sure, a lot of tech-
niques are known to be successful, and a lot of aquatic breeding methods are
steadfast and true — but, what one hobbyist finds to be a successful method,
others may have no luck with. Better methods are waiting to be discovered,
and there is always room for improvement and new ideas when it comes to
breeding fish.
Many hobbyists have bred fish accidentally, just by having the right combina-
tion in their aquariums. Whether it occurs by accident or on purpose, breed-
ing is breeding. Don’t let anyone tell you any differently. (If they do, tell them
to come see us.) When you’re breeding your fish, take the time to observe
everything:
 What are the spawning pair (male and female that you want to mate)
doing about the other fish around them?
 Are there any changes in the pecking order?
 Have feeding patterns changed since the courtship started? Are the fish
eating more or have they stopped feeding normally? 
By making pertinent observations of all your fish’s activities, you can gain a
better understanding of how aquatic relationships work.

Keep a logbook so that you have a permanent record of your spawners’ ages,
successes, diseases, and brood sizes.
It’s a great idea to exchange information, such as by calling other hobbyists
on the phone and bragging, or writing an article and bragging. Only by shar-
ing information can breeding methods be refined and perfected. Never adopt
complete secrecy: You may hold the key to solving a very difficult puzzle for
someone else! Also, by exchanging information or asking for advice, you can
avoid breeding hazards and unwanted mutations (no one wants to produce
piranhas the size of the Titanic).
Deciding to Breed Your Aquarium Fish
Aquarists, like everyone else, have goals for their hobby. One of your first
goals as a fishkeeper is to maintain a healthy and successful aquarium. After
you accomplish that, then what?
You may decide to try another type of system (such as brackish or marine)
or investigate unfamiliar breeds. But when all is said and done as far as main-
taining an aquarium is concerned, what does the future hold? (If you’re like
us, one answer is: a lot of bills at the local fish shop.)
Breaking new barriers 
Breeding aquarium fish successfully is kind of like getting into a sport’s Hall
of Fame: There is no greater reward. So many species can be bred easily that
you should have no problem getting into this fascinating and enjoyable
aspect of the aquarium hobby. There are also many fish out there that have
never been bred, which leaves the door wide open for you to become a pio-
neer. Just imagine what it would be like if you were the first person on earth
to successfully breed a species. It can happen.
Gaining new knowledge and enjoyment
The satisfaction of accomplishing something new (and perhaps snagging a
little fame and money while you’re at it) is a good reason to start breeding
fish. You can gain an overwhelming amount of wisdom, knowledge, and plea-
sure by partaking in this scientific aspect of the hobby. When you success-
fully breed a particular species, you also find out much more about that
species than the average hobbyist learns in a lifetime.
242
Part IV: Breeding and Other Fun Stuff 

And, above all, breeding fish is fun. Hey, if you think human courtship is a
little odd at times, wait until you see your fish go a few rounds.
Conserving the environment
Probably the most important reason to breed fish is to contribute to the con-
servation (keeping species alive for future generations to enjoy) of our
Earth’s aquatic species.
At one time, freshwater fish were shipped from many countries around the
globe so that the average hobbyist could enjoy them. Today, thanks to mas-
sive freshwater breeding programs, most of these species are captive-bred. If
anything ever happens to them in the wild, aquarium hobbyists will be there
to pick up the ball. Already, many home aquarists and organizations such as
the American Cichlid Association have saved many fish species from extinc-
tion by breeding them when their numbers reached alarmingly low rates in
their native environments.
You, too, can contribute to this aspect of aquarium fish breeding. We all have
a responsibility to put back what we take from the wild.
We think every aquarist should attempt to breed some species. Don’t con-
cern yourself with wondering whether it’s already been done — just go out
and do it.
Choosing Your Equipment
Before you set up a spawning tank, decide whether you want to breed a few
fish in your main aquarium (in which case you don’t need a breeding room)
or turn out fry faster than your local greasy spoon. (Fry is a technical term
for baby fish, by the way.)
A large-scale breeding operation requires space. Easy-to-breed fish multiply
very rapidly. You may end up living on the back porch permanently to make
room for your new arrivals. To breed fish in a serious way — to develop new
colors, sizes, and/or fin shapes — you need quite a bit of room. An extra bed-
room or office offers the perfect solution. But if your house is the size of a
small cabin, you may want to look into the possibility of a heated storage
shed. Make sure you have plenty of room before you start, or you may end up
hastily trying to bamboozle your local dealer into buying some fry off you.
(When you sell fish to a dealer, don’t look desperate or they will cut your
profit margin because they think you need money.)
243
Chapter 19: The Breeding Room

The aquarium
A 10- or 20-gallon aquarium is a good starting size for a breeding tank for
small species such as guppies and platys. You don’t want to use a tank that 
is too large, because you might lose track of your spawners and their fry. In
order to keep up with everything your fish are doing, you have to spy on
them frequently. A smaller tank allows you to remain in control of the action
at all times, and is much easier to work with and clean. As with any aquarium,
thoroughly rinse it with clear water before you use it.
Putting a lid on the whole thing
When your fish are ready to breed, they get a little excited. Excited fish tend
to jump very high. High-jumping fish can end up as permanent decoration
stuck on your room light or as an afternoon treat for the cat. A tight-fitting
hood keeps your fish in the water where they belong, protects eggs and
young fry from many unseen disasters, and keeps heat loss at a minimum. A
good hood also prevents dirt and household chemicals (such as your daugh-
ter’s hair spray) from entering the water. 
Decorations
Plenty of places to hide, such as within and under rocks and plants, give 
your spawning pairs the opportunity to get used to being around each other
before they start spawning. It’s a fact of life; some couples just don’t get 
along very well. If your breeding tank has no hiding places, the male of 
many species may have to kill or maim his mate out of territoriality or 
frustration before any spawning has an opportunity to take place.
Many species of fish like to breed on pieces of shale, rocks, flowerpots, or
plant leaves. In Chapter 20 we discuss these decorating options in further
detail.
Don’t laugh, but many hobbyists mistakenly place two aggressive males
together in a breeding tank (it’s more difficult to determine sex in some
species than in others), which leads to total disaster without places for 
them to hide. The loss of fish in these cases can be avoided with proper
hiding places.

Part IV: Breeding and Other Fun Stuff 

Substrate
Hobbyists disagree as to whether to use a gravel substrate in the breeding
tank. We generally recommend using no substrate for several reasons:
 A tank with gravel or sand is much more difficult to keep clean.
 Most species are happy breeding in a tank that has no substrate and use
rocks, plants, or flowerpots for protection and laying eggs if needed.
Check the breeding requirements on your species, though, because
some do require substrate for digging during breeding. (See Chapters 19
and 20 for more.)
 The newborn fry of livebearers (fish that bear live young) often sink
down to the substrate after birth. We have seen many fry trapped by
gravel too large for them to navigate around.
 It is really difficult for you and the parents to see and keep track of the
fry’s health and growth with substrate in the breeding tank. For example,
a betta male gathers eggs that fall from the surface and spits them back
into the safety of his bubble nest. If the bottom of the tank is covered
with gravel substrate, the young fry may fall between the individual
stones and become unreachable.
Many hobbyists argue that a spawning tank is not natural without substrate,
but we have seen most species of fish bred without it. If you feel the need to
use substrate for species that prefer to spawn on it (like some killifish), a thin
layer of fine sand is a good choice.
Spawning grates
Once in a while, you run into a species that likes to eat its own young or eggs.
To prevent this, lay a spawning grate (available at many pet shops) on the
floor of the tank so that the young fry or eggs fall to the bottom through the
holes. This allows you time to remove the parents before they can have their
offspring for dinner. You can find woven lattice plastic mats that work well at
most hobby or craft stores, and you can cut them to any shape you need.
Just place the lattice sheet on top of small stones, and you have a made-to-
order spawning grate for very little expense. Another option is to buy a breed-
ing trap, which allows newborn live fry to fall safely between a slot
underneath the mother.
245
Chapter 19: The Breeding Room

You know those green plastic containers that hold strawberries? (Remember
you unsuccessfully tried to turn them into a Christmas ornament?) Laid side
by side with the open side down, they work well as a spawning grate.
Sometimes a little imagination goes a long way.
Turning up the heat
Use a good quality heater in the breeding tank to keep the water from chill-
ing. This is especially important if your breeding room is not insulated as well
as the rest of your home. Besides, many fish require a small increase in tem-
perature to prepare them for breeding. Although it’s possible to control the
water temperature with the heating system in your home, it doesn’t work
well because all home temperatures do not match species requirements, so
this isn’t a practical method. It’s better to have a heater you can adjust as
needed on each individual tank.
Filtration
Filters are important in breeding tanks, because they supply needed oxygen
and produce the water movement that entices many species to mate.
Filtration also keeps wastes that can destroy eggs and fry from building up.
A sponge filter is ideal for almost any breeding tank. This unit has a very
simple design and is easy to use. A sponge filter provides simple biological 
filtration without the risks of mechanical filters (such as youngsters being
sucked up in the intake tubes). A sponge filter creates current, but doesn’t
cause the excess turbulence often produced by larger power and undergravel
filters. If your spawning fish are stuck together permanently due to excessive
water waves, you may want to cut down on the current with a valve or a
smaller filter. Heavy turbulence from an extra air supply (bubble disks or 
airstones) can damage delicate eggs or young fry. 
If you decide to use a larger filter, make sure it runs slowly. If you use a
sponge filter, you can always do water changes to remove any floating 
debris that is usually removed by a mechanical filter.
Plants for safety, spawning, 
and inspiration
Plants have a wide variety of uses in a spawing tank:
 Plants look cool.
 Plants are generally inexpensive.
246
Part IV: Breeding and Other Fun Stuff 

 Plastic and live plants provide privacy and offer security.
 Several species of fish use live plants in the construction of their nests.
 Plastic and live plants serve as spawning sites for many species of fish.
 Live plants remove carbon dioxide from the water and replace it 
with oxygen.
 Live plants cut down on algae present in the water by competing for the
same resources they require to survive.
 Live plants are a natural food source.
 A planted tank can make your fish think they’re in a natural environ-
ment, which helps inspire and speed up their spawning plans.
 Plants can provide protection and shelter when a spawning partner
becomes aggressive (and many do). You’re wise to always have several
thick plants on hand just in case the lovemaking reaches Round 15.
If those aren’t enough good reasons to use plants for spawning, we’ll never be
able to talk you into it!
Thoroughly clean any plants with room-temperature water that you choose
for your spawning tank before adding them to the tank. Plants often carry
snails and small nematodes (worms) that can potentially harm eggs and fry.
To be on the safe side, you can set up a separate tank to grow plants that can
be used especially for spawning.
In case you’re wondering what types of plants to use in your tank, we provide
you with a list to get you started in Table 19-1. Remember that many freshwa-
ter plants have different pH and temperature requirements. So, check the list
in Table 19-1 and match the plant to your individual aquarium setup accord-
ingly. (See Chapters 16 and 17 for more on live plants and for explanations of
the terms we use to describe these plants.) By the way, dH means degrees of
hardness.

Getting the Water Right
The water in your spawning tank must suit the species of fish you’re trying
to breed. Take a look at Chapters 12 through 14 for more info on getting the
water right.
pH and dH control
You must keep the pH and dH (degrees of hardness) level of your water
under control in a breeding situation. Changes in pH are very damaging to
your fish, and the ill effects double in intensity during the breeding ritual.
Eggs and young fry are especially susceptible to the smallest of fluctuations
in pH level. A good pH test kit will allow you to monitor your water (see
Chapter 12).
Water temperature
One important thing to keep an eye on, especially if you have egglayers (fish
that don’t bare live young, but lay eggs that hatch), is the temperature of the
water. Eggs can be severely damaged in temperatures above 85 degrees F.
You may end up with poached eggs. Higher temperatures also cause eggs to
develop too quickly, which can lead to weak, deformed, or weird-looking fry.
Research each species (Chapter 8, other hobbyists, your local dealer, the
Web) that you want to breed carefully before starting out so that you know
what their water requirements are.
Cleanliness
Young fry and eggs are much more susceptible than adults to problems
resulting from too many nitrogen compounds (waste) in the water. Poor
water conditions can destroy eggs or damage the growth cycle of newborns.
Carefully change at least one quarter of the water each day in a spawning or
growout tank and make sure you have some type of filtration.
To avoid fouling the water in a breeding tank, feed the fish small amounts of
live foods instead of flake.
249
Chapter 19: The Breeding Room

Conditioning the Love Birds
Many fish practically jump into the spawning tank from across the room in
order to breed. Others, however, have a hard time adjusting to their new
partners and your breeding goals. This section gives you some die-hard
methods that you can try to help condition (get your fish in the mood to
spawn) your aquatic lovebirds. (Don’t bother with Mozart and a little wine 
in the water — we already tried that.) No lovemaking tricks are completely
foolproof, but several tried over the years have proven to be quite reliable
and accurate.
The way to the heart is through 
the stomach routine
Everyone loves to eat, right? (In the case of some teenagers we could name,
some more than others.) Fish are no different. You probably already picked
up on that last time they jumped out of the water and into the open food can
in your hand. So, it is easy to turn the tables and take advantage of the fact
that your fish are real gluttons most of the time.
One change that commonly occurs during the breeding season in a fish’s 
natural environment is the sudden appearance and overabundance of live
foods. When seasonal rainstorms sweep over ponds, lakes, and rivers, a large
supply of live insects and fresh food drops onto the water surface. Offer your
fish live foods such as brine shrimp and tubifex worms (okay, okay, so it’s a
bribe) to condition them for breeding purposes. Just remember to rinse all
live food before feeding.
Fruit flies (Drosophila), mysis shrimp, and small earthworms also make great
conditioning food.
The old fake rainstorm trick
Weekly water changes are very important to the health of your fish, and you
can use them to aid in the conditioning process as well. In the wild, seasonal
rains (you know, when you find your car has floated down the block) usually
signal the start of the breeding system. Now, we know that it’s not practical
to run outside with your fish tank in your hands every time it rains in your
neighborhood. The only other option is to create an artificial rainstorm.
250
Part IV: Breeding and Other Fun Stuff 

In the home aquarium, you can duplicate a rainstorm to some degree by
doing frequent water changes (about 20 percent per day in a breeding tank).
Clean, demineralized water stimulates most species into entering their sea-
sonal spawning cycle.
Another way to duplicate the rainy season is by showering the surface of the
water in your spawning tank with drops of water. You can do this quite easily
by using an inexpensive plastic watering can purchased at almost any garden
shop. No, you don’t have to stand there all day imitating a stone fountain.
Just run one full can of water slowly over the surface each hour when you
have time. (Don’t forget to remove some water first!) You can also try pouring
water slowly through a plastic fine-holed colander or fine plastic mesh.
The barometric pressure advantage
In the wild, an increase in atmospheric pressure (the weight of air as measured
by a barometer) often makes fish more lovable and loving. Many hobbyists
report that their fish breed more actively right before or during a rain or
snowstorm. Follow the local weather conditions and you may be able to
introduce pairs to the breeding tank during a barometric pressure drop 
and have a successful spawning.
The old change the temperature ploy
If you go backpacking out to your species’ natural environment, you soon find
that they do not live in an area that remains the same temperature 24 hours
per day. (If you don’t believe us, pitch a tent for a night out there.) Try fluctu-
ating the temperature of the breeding tank overnight. Slowly drop the temper-
ature 3 degrees at night by adjusting the heater, and then slowly raise it back
up in the morning. Now don’t get carried away and start tossing ice cubes into
the tank or anything. All temperature changes must be done slowly!
The new guy next door approach
If you have a beautifully colored male that is being really stubborn and refus-
ing to breed, you can always try introducing a second male (the meanest,
ugliest one that you can find) in close proximity. This is kind of like sending
your fish to a singles bar. Placing the rival male in a glass holding container
near the spawning tank often inspires the stubborn spawner to breed when
he suddenly realizes that there may be competition for his female.
251
Chapter 19: The Breeding Room

The absence makes the heart 
grow fonder routine
If a pair is being outright stubborn about getting along, you can always sepa-
rate the male and the female with a glass partition until they decide to either
breed or die of boredom. (You know the old saying, “Absence makes the
heart grow fonder.”) This method is illustrated in Figure 19-1. While sepa-
rated, keep feeding them small bits of live food until they shows signs of
mating such as displaying brilliant colors or excessive contortions and body
movement. This method works best when you only have one pair of fish in
the spawning tank.

B
reeding your fish is a great way to advance your fishkeeping skills. After
you learn the basics and have successfully bred your first fish brood,
there’s no reason why you can’t begin thinking about selling the excess off-
spring to a local dealer, trading them to friends, using them as feeder fish, or
buying more tanks to house them. You may get lucky and find a dealer who
needs a regular supply. This little bit of extra money can help offset some of
the expense incurred with your hobby (and offset your spouse’s financial
wrath at the same time).
Simply ask your local dealer if he or she would be willing to trade equipment
or purchase your extra fish at a cost that will satisfy both buyer and seller.
You can also run an ad in your local newspaper and sell your fry to other
hobbyists.
Before you actually sell your new fish, you should decide which ones you
want to keep for further breeding. There may be a particular fish in the new
brood that has a slightly different color or pattern that is pleasing to your
eye. You usually have to wait for the fry to grow up a bit before they develop
their colors and patterns. Make sure their markings are no longer changing
before you make any final decisions.
Some fish breed in your community or species tank without any help from
you. For example, if you have a bunch of male and female guppies in a com-
munity tank, chances are they will breed on their own, as long as the aquar-
ium is clean and has good water conditions, without any extra work on your
part. Some species are simply more willing to breed in captivity than others.

But if you want stay in control of which fish breed and when, set up a spawn-
ing tank (a tank designated only for breeding and raising certain fish at a cer-
tain time). That way, you can adjust the water quality and feeding schedule
as necessary, as well as cull (separate the good from the bad) the fry of each
species you’re raising. Culling is simply the process of separating the fish you
want to keep from the fish you don’t. This ensures being able to breed indi-
viduals with the characteristics you want.
A good spawning tank is just a miniaturized version of the main tank. Make
sure it has proper filtration, good water conditions, gravel, and plants to give
your fish that “feel at home” sensation. A 5- or 10-gallon-tank makes a great
breeding tank. Many hobbyists remove a majority of the decorations in a
breeding tank, but we like to keep it as natural as possible. The final choice 
is yours.
Beginning a fish-breeding program brings with it some humane responsibility.
Fish that you produce through breeding should, as they do in the wild, find
their place in the biological ecosystem. Some species produce dozens or
even hundreds of young. It’s doubtful that you will want to keep every fish
that your breeding pairs create. You should make every attempt to raise
these fish, sell them, trade them, or give them away to good owners. If you
think you cannot do these things, it may mean using excess fry to feed larger
fish. Although this situation is found in nature, if you don’t like the sound of
you yourself doing it, then breeding is not for you.
Introducing the Bride and Groom
With most species, it is better to introduce the female to the spawning tank
ahead of the male. Males are more aggressive, and putting the female in first
allows her to establish a little bit of territory for herself. There are a few
exceptions to this rule, so check the breeding requirements and strategies 
for each individual species by talking with other hobbyists who breed that
species, attending fish clubs, talking to your local dealer, and researching
species on the Web. 
Give the female plenty of time to become comfortable in the new tank (at
least a couple of hours, until she is swimming normally and not hiding in her
new surroundings). When she looks like she has become queen of the hill,
place her behind a clear tank partition (usually made of professionally cut
glass, plastic, or Plexiglas) before you introduce the male. You can purchase
partitions at pet stores or make your own. This “prenuptial” separation lets
the male get accustomed to the sight of his mate and give him a chance to
calm down a little bit before he actually meets her. Leave the partition up
until the male seems like he is calm. You don’t need to do this with all
species, but it is usually the safest way to go.
254
Part IV: Breeding and Other Fun Stuff 

Dealing with aggressive males
Some males are naturally more aggressive (actually nasty is the word we were
looking for) than others, and it’s difficult to determine an individual’s habits
before you see him in action. We’ve had very peaceful males of one species,
only to turn around and end up with one of the same species that was ready
to take on Mike Tyson. The only way to tell how aggressive a male is going to
be during breeding is to keep a close eye on him once he is introduced into
the spawning tank.
If your spawning tank is heavily planted and contains many safe areas where
a female can hide, you may be able to introduce both partners at the same
time. We personally do not use this method very often because we’ve seen
too many females torn up by normally peaceful males that got a little too
excited. Be safe and use a partition to allow them to get to know each other
first.
Setting up the second date
If a spawning pair seems to get along well on the first date, it’s probably safe
to put them back into the same spawning tank at the same time. But fish in
love can be very unpredictable, so don’t bet the farm on their getting along
again. It never hurts to use a partition more than once.
Yay, my fish really like each other!
If your fish are having a real romantic picnic, why spoil the fun? Let them 
continue to breed as long as they’re in good health. If you don’t want any-
more newborns, keep them in separate main tanks.
Darn, my fish hate each other!
If your fish are throwing gravel at each other, they probably won’t be in 
the mood to mate. Don’t force something that isn’t meant to be. Give them 
a little time away from each other and then try again. If they still try to kill
each other, forget it and work with a different set of partners. We have wit-
nessed a couple of instances where one male would refuse to mate with only
one particular female out of a group of ten identical-looking fish! Why they
seem to turn on one individual is unknown. A bit of fin nipping during spawn-
ing is normal in many species such as the beta. Just make sure they are not
seriously injuring each other.
255
Chapter 20: Let’s Spawn!

Following are a few physical reasons why fish won’t spawn:
 Their water looks like a sewer.
 Their tank is too small.
 They need more fish (for example, neons mate more often in schools).
 One of the partners is cradle-robbing, or is older than dirt.
 The fish have not been fed live foods prior to spawning.
 The fish may be sterile.
 You have two females in the spawning tank (not good).
 You have two males in the spawning tank (even worse).
 They just don’t feel like it.
If the problem seems to be mental, check out Chapter 19 for tricks to get your
two fish to like each other. Unfortunately, there are no fish psychologists to
help you along, so if these tricks don’t work you may as well forget it and try
another pair.
Understanding Breeding Types
Fish reproduce in one of two basic ways. Livebearers bear live young.
Egglayers lay eggs. Each type of breeder has special requirements.
Livebearers
Livebearers give birth to free-swimming young that are fully formed and
resemble tiny adults. A female livebearer is internally fertilized by her part-
ner and carries the fry internally for about a month (called the gestation
period) before birthing them. Immediately after entering this world, the
young fry swim and search for food.
All livebearing fish are either ovoviviparous (the female produces eggs that
contain yolk to feed the embryo) or viviparous (the young are nourished by
the mother’s circulatory system). Ovoviviparous females tend to lose their
brood to miscarriage more often than viviparous ones.
How to tell male from female
A few well-known examples of livebearers include guppies, swordtails, mol-
lies, and platys. Most livebearers are brightly colored and make great com-
munity fish. It is easy to determine the sex of most livebearers because the
256
Part IV: Breeding and Other Fun Stuff 

female is usually larger and more full-bodied than the male. Most males have
a rodlike organ (developed from the anal fin) called a gonopodium. This
unique organ is used to internally fertilize a female. After a single fertilization,
a female can produce multiple broods (batches of fry) month after month
without a male being present.
Except when they’re in drag
In some livebearers, females can develop secondary male sexual characteris-
tics. Where not enough males are present to ensure survival of the species,
the female’s anal fin may change into a gonopodium, and that fish will then
carry on male duties!
The egglayers
Egglayers lay eggs (which usually range in size from 1.4 to 3 millimeters) that
eventually hatch into newborn fry. The fry of egglayers are not as hardy and
fully formed as those produced by livebearers. The babies of egglayers take
much more time to mature. Popular egglayers include angelfish, cichlids,
goldfish, and bettas.
When breeding egglayers, be aware of the following dangers to eggs:
 Lack of oxygen: The eggs in your breeding tank can be seriously dam-
aged by lack of oxygen in the water. Without oxygen, their normal rate of
cell division decreases. But you don’t want heavy turbulence in the tank
either. Hook up a small airstone or bubble disk (which splits the air into
smaller bubbles) to a gang valve (which splits up an air supply to supply
several pieces of equipment) so that you can adjust the oxygen flow.
This setup provides beneficial aeration for the eggs without blowing the
eggs into the next county.
 Poor water conditions: Dirty water can cause eggs to deteriorate. Make
sure your water is clean and has the proper temperature and pH for
your species.
 Lack of vitamins: Eggs can also be damaged if the mother lacks the
essential vitamins needed to help them grow correctly. Diseased females
can produce bad eggs. If the eggs from an unhealthy mother hatch, the
young are usually defective and will produce deformed babies or none at
all. Make sure that your spawning female is in good health before you
attempt to breed her.
 Intense lighting: Light that’s too bright can also damage fish eggs.
Minimize lighting in your breeding tank.
257
Chapter 20: Let’s Spawn!

Bubble nest builders
Bubble nest builders lay and incubate their eggs in a nest of bubbles that usu-
ally floats at the surface or is attached to plants. Bettas and gouramis are the
most famous of these bubble nest builders. A male betta builds a floating nest
that he carefully constructs from mucus-coated air bubbles he blows out of
his mouth. Males often use plant debris as a “glue” to help keep the bubbles
together. In some species, the entire nest has a foamy appearance.
Nests are built in different shapes and sizes, depending on the individual
male. Some males complete a nest in a few hours, whereas others take their
time and end up working several days to accomplish the same task. If excess
circulation or other factors damage the nest, the male constantly repairs it as
needed. Often males build more than one nest to impress a female and entice
her into breeding.
The female should be removed immediately after spawning. If the fish do not
spawn, she should still be removed so she does not get attacked by the male.
The betta male cares for the eggs once they are laid and keeps them clean
using chemicals in his mouth. Don’t panic if he picks up eggs in his mouth
and spits them back into the nest, because this is normal. After a few days
the egg case will dissolve and the fry will emerge. This betta example is only
one of the amazing things that you will see while breeding your fish!
Egg scatterers
Egg scatterers must hide their eggs because they do not take care of them
after birth. These species scatter their eggs around decorations, rocks,
plants, and gravel. During the courtship of these species, the male actively
chases his mate and fertilizes her eggs as they fall freely into the water. They
do this for large numbers of eggs at one time, ensuring that some survive by
sheer numbers alone. A few common examples of egg scatterers are danios,
barbs, rasboras, and tetras.
Substrate spawners
Substrate spawners lay their eggs in such a manner that the eggs attach to
one particular area of rocks, driftwood, plants, or substrate. The male of the
species fertilizes the eggs while the female lays them. Common examples of
substrate spawners include some cichlids, catfish, and killifish.
Mouthbrooders have all the fun
Mouthbrooders are unique, because they incubate their eggs in their mouth
until it is time for them to hatch. As the eggs are laid, the male fertilizes them.
The parents (either the male or female) gather them up in their mouths for
protection and incubation. Examples of mouthbrooders are some labyrinth
fish and some cichlids.
258
Part IV: Breeding and Other Fun Stuff 

Saving Everyone from Everyone Else
After spawning is complete, and the fry are produced, there may be a few
problems between Mom and Dad; Mom and the kids; or Dad and the kids.
(Hey, sounds like our family.) It is crucial that you keep an eye on everyone
after breeding — this is when the third world war may break out among
aggressive species. Let us put it this way: If fish had nuclear weapons after
spawning, we would all be vaporized.
Saving Mom and Dad from Mom and Dad
Just because your fish had a great night out on the town doesn’t mean that
they like each other now. In fact, there’s a really good chance that they want
to tear each other fin from fin. No one seems to know why they get like that.
Perhaps they’re just really tired after spawning or are suffering from PASS
(post aquatic spawning syndrome). Whatever the reason, many fish have to
be separated after they spawn. 
If you have a pretty decent-sized fish room, move the female to her own hold-
ing tank (as small as 4 gallons, depending on the size of the fish) and then
move the male to his own quarters. It is not a good idea to move spawners
back to a main aquarium with other fish. The male may still be aggressive
because his hormones are as high as a kite on a windy day. He may look for
his next victim in your community or species tank. The female may be torn
up or worn out, and you should allow her to rest in a tank of her own for at
least 48 hours to recover properly.
The slime coat (coating on the body that helps to protect fish from disease)
on a mating pair can be easily damaged during breeding. After you move the
male and female to their own quarters for recuperation, add a little Stress
Coat to the water to guard against bacterial infections.
Saving the kids from Mom and Dad
Many fish (such as cichlids) normally make good parents and perform tasks
such as caring for their brood and defending their nesting spot. However,
should this pair suddenly be upset by outsiders, they can turn from Ward 
and June into Bonnie and Clyde in a heartbeat. Unfortunately, the young fry
or eggs suffer the most from their parents’ newfound wrath.
259
Chapter 20: Let’s Spawn!

One way to avoid this problem with aggressive species is to use a large tank
equipped with many hiding places. Try to keep their breeding tank in a quiet,
low-traffic area so that the fish aren’t irritated by people walking by and
making noise. You can also use a spawning grate (a plastic sheet with holes
that allows the eggs to fall though) for protection (see Chapter 19 for more 
on spawning grates).
Livebearers (such as guppies) often eat their young. To prevent this, you 
can purchase a breeding trap to separate the young after birth. Breeding 
traps come in a few different designs. A net breeder, shown in Figure 20-1, is a
simple rectangular device that floats in your aquarium, kind of a net shaped
like a box. Put the female inside the net, so that her young are protected from
other fish in a community tank. Unfortunately, the net trap does not protect
the young from Mom. The advantage of the net breeder is that the net allows
free water flow from the aquarium.
You can also put the expectant mother in a plastic breeding tank and float it
in your larger aquarium until she gives birth. One advantage of this type of
breeder is that after the fry are born they drop through a small slit and are
separated from their mother and future tankmates. Unfortunately, the plastic
breeder does not allow water flow to keep the interior clean and can foul
rather quickly if birth is delayed.
Most breeding traps are too small to accommodate a pregnant female for 
any length of time. While under prolonged restraint, she may struggle to
escape and damage herself or her unborn fry. Pregnant females should only
be placed in breeding traps when they are ready to deliver. By becoming
familiar with the species you are breeding, you learn to recognize when your
fish is ready to give birth. This can vary from species to species, but it usu-
ally includes the mother looking complete bloated, constantly moving toward
the bottom of the tank, or looking for cover.

Part IV: Breeding and Other Fun Stuff 

Saving the kids from each other
Fry eventually reach a stage where they are sexually mature. If you have a
bunch of juveniles in a growout tank (a separate tank for the young fish so
they won’t be attacked by other larger tankmates), you should separate the
males from the females as soon as you can determine their genders. If you
don’t, you may end up with a lot of unwanted spawning that interferes with
your breeding plan. As the fry grow, you need to start culling (separate fish
out that you want to breed again).
A problem with growing fry is that the larger ones (the males usually grow
quicker) start eating the smaller ones. This is very common, even if they are
fed properly.
Raising the Fry
After the fry are born, and the parents have been moved to a resting tank,
you can begin feeding the babies. The fry (depending on the species) are usu-
ally very small and should be fed liquid foods or infusoria cultures through
an eyedropper (to measure and add the food to the tank). Microworms are
another good food choice.
Stepping up to brine shrimp
After a few weeks, you can begin feeding the fry baby brine shrimp — live
foods help them gain maximum growth. Brine shrimp is a great choice
because of the relatively low odds of introducing disease into the tank.
Giving them a real home
Be sure to feed your newborn fry small amounts 3–5 times a day to ensure
maximum growth. Baby foods tend to foul water quickly, so change the water
frequently in order to keep the tank clean. A well-planted aquarium allows
them to mature more normally than a bare tank with no decorations does.
Check each species’ specifications (see later in this chapter for a few exam-
ples of species specifications to get you started) before removing the par-
ents! Some fry, such as discus, depend on their parent’s slime coat for
nourishment and may not survive if their parents are removed from the tank.
261
Chapter 20: Let’s Spawn!

Picking new stock
When selecting future breeding stock from your own bred stock and new pur-
chases, choose the most colorful, vigorous fish in the group and move all the
females to one tank and the males to another tank. You don’t want to rely
upon chance sexual encounters or you may never be able to develop the
strain you’re seeking.
Understanding Genetics
A while back, a bored young monk named Gregor Mendel did a few experi-
ments with peas in a quiet monastery garden. He selectively bred pea plants
for certain characteristics and kept track of those characteristics. He was
surprised to see traits (physical signs) not seen in either parent plant appear
in their offspring. Everyone thought he was weird, but he learned a lot of cool
stuff — such as, what you see is not necessarily what you get (he had discov-
ered recessive genes). Selective breeding allows you to choose fish that have
the characteristics you’re searching for and breed them until that character-
istic remains stable from generation to generation. And, like Mendel, you may
end up with a few surprises to boot.
Choosing the best
To breed selectively, you need to choose a male that possesses characteris-
tics you want to develop into a pure strain, so that generation after genera-
tion of fish display the same certain colors, fin types, and whatever other
factors you isolate. Selecting a good female may be a little more difficult,
because they usually do not carry as much color as the males. Just try to
pick a full-bodied female in good health.
Obtaining variation the good way
Few strains (an entire breeding family tree) produce identical fish from gener-
ation to generation. If they do, it can take a very long time to develop fish
that are identical in color and shape consistently by interbreeding them with
each other . Because genetics are so varied, it is possible that you may end
up with a brand new characteristic (not seen in the parents) within a few
years. This occurs because of recessive genes (genes that are present but
which are not “turned on” and thus don’t show their traits in the physical
makeup) which make an appearance periodically.
262
Part IV: Breeding and Other Fun Stuff 

Obtaining variation the bad way
Another way you can obtain variation is when a mutation occurs. A mutation
is a more radical change from one generation to the next and does not occur
in increments. Mutations are not very common. The main disadvantage of a
mutation is that many mutants are sterile or, if they’re fertile, they may carry
deformed genes that are not passed along to future generations. The odds of
carrying a mutation long enough to make it pure are staggeringly long, to say
the least.
Creating strains through inbreeding
The breeding process used to produce a “pure” strain of fish is known as
inbreeding. After the first brood is born and raised, pick a healthy male and
breed him back to his mother. From the next generation, select the best qual-
ity grandson (who displays the characteristics you want) and breed him with
his grandmother. Keep repeating this process for successive generations.
This helps solidify the characteristics you want by keeping unwanted traits
from other fish out of the picture. This is perfectly normal as far as fish are
concerned, because they would breed with each other anyway, and you are
just pairing them up for the best traits. 
As each new brood is born, check for males born with unique characteristics
that you want to continue on with. If the females that you started with die,
select a healthy daughter and continue on. This method of inbreeding is more
effective than line breeding, which involves mating half-brothers and sisters.
Inbreeding in mammals causes genetic defects, and many people find it a dis-
tasteful topic generally. However, in the fish world it happens all the time.
Sometimes survival depends on it. In our opinion inbreeding in fish should
not be thought of in the same light as it is for higher animals. However, it’s
possible that no amount of evidence or argument can get you over that
hurdle. If that is the case, then inbreeding to produce new strains of fish is
not for you.
Choosing the Right Species for You
It’s best to start out with a few of the easier-to-breed species so that you can
learn the ropes. The following examples give you basic information on a few
species that are relatively easy to breed so that you can get started on this
fascinating adventure without encountering a lot of difficult problems off 
the bat.
263
Chapter 20: Let’s Spawn!

Guppy (Poecilia reticulata)
The guppy is probably the easiest aquarium fish to breed. Guppies would
breed in a puddle of water if given half a chance. Combine several males with
a few females in a species tank, and within a year you will have to purchase a
new aquarium to house all your new fish. Guppies readily breed in a commu-
nity aquarium, species tank, or spawning tank. Males have a gonopodium and
are more brightly colored than the larger-bodied females. The young fry are
born fully formed and ready to eat food. Standard water temperature for
breeding is 74–78 degrees F; dH 12; pH 7.
Convict cichlid (Archocentrus 
nigrofasciatus) 
Breeding convicts is very easy. Because convicts who are breeding can be
very aggressive toward their tankmates, put them in their own spawning tank
with a few plants and rocks or a flowerpot turned on its side. The female is
larger and shows much more color than the male. She also exhibits black and
red bars during the breeding cycle. Water for breeding is 69–79 degrees F; dH
8; pH 7.2.
Convict spawning occurs very rapidly. They lay their eggs in a rock cave or in
a flowerpot. Both parents help take good care of the young — unless they
begin to quarrel. If the parents fight, remove the losing partner. The young
eat readily and flee to the parents when they feel threatened.
Angelfish (Pterophyllum scalare)
Angelfish breed steadily when you provide the proper conditions. Angle a
piece of slate (about 45 degrees), 2–3 inches wide, against the glass of the
tank for your angelfish to lay their eggs on. The spawning pair will clean off
the slate before using it. When the housework is done, the female lays her
eggs on the slate, which the male then fertilizes. Angelfish often pair up, so
the easiest way to start matching them with a spawning partner is to pay
attention to who hangs out with whom. Male angelfish have a bump
(common among cichlids) on the front of their heads. The genital area is
round in the female, and pointed in the male.
After the eggs are fertilized, both parents use their fins to gently fan them
with water and remove any infertile or damaged eggs. The eggs hatch within
48 hours, and the fry absorb their yolk sacs before searching for food. Some
angelfish are carnivorous and eat their own eggs. (Angelfish also help their
264
Part IV: Breeding and Other Fun Stuff 

young emerge from the eggs by removing the case, so make sure you know
what you’re seeing before you do anything about it.) If the angelfish are
eating their eggs, remove the piece of slate with the eggs on it and place it in
another tank with an airstone. Water temperature for breeding is 75–78
degrees F; dH 7–16; pH 6.7–7.5.
A Few Final Tips
As we hope we’ve made clear, breeding tropical fish can be fun, educational,
and profitable. Just remember the following few simple tips and you’ll be on
your way:
 Choose healthy fish to breed.
 Breed your fish in a special breeding tank to control your genetic lines.
Make sure your breeding tank has the correct water conditions and
hiding places.
 Research your species so that you can benefit from what other aquarists
have learned about breeding that particular type of fish.
 Don’t let your fish injure each other during the breeding process.
 Most important of all: Have fun and enjoy your new fish!

 Learning better photography techniques
O
ne great way to enhance your fishkeeping hobby is by keeping a written
log and taking pictures of your prize aquatic pets. Photos and logs are
good tools for learning more about your fish, their breeding habits, environ-
mental quirks, and natural social interactions. Photography is also a fun way
to enhance your social standing by impressing your friends with your great
pictures. Most of the equipment you need for fish photography and written
logs are fairly inexpensive and can be easily obtained. 
Keeping a Log Book
Keeping track of your fish’s individual health, breeding schedule, and food
preferences can be quite a difficult job, especially if you have a large variety
of species, or more aquariums than the National Aquarium in Baltimore.
One good way to keep tabs on your aquarium fish is to use a written logbook.
A complete record of each fish in your aquarium lets you monitor your pet’s
history, social habits, growth, water conditions, feeding habits, and spawning
successes.

If you keep track of each new fish as you purchase it, you gain a better under-
standing of each species’ needs, and that can be beneficial in decisions
regarding purchases of future tankmates. For example, the “calm” oversized
molly you bought a couple of months ago cleverly turns your community
tank into a World Wrestling Federation battle royal, and you note its bizarre
behavior carefully on your written log. On your next trip to the fish shop, this
individual fish’s rap sheet will remind you to run at warp speed past the giant
molly section toward calmer waters.
Beginning a log is kind of like starting your first diary except you don’t have
to make up stuff. Keep a separate sheet for each fish. We suggest encasing
each sheet in a plastic slip-folder and placing the individual sheets in a three-
ring binder to protect the logs from water and moisture. To get you off on the
right foot, the following list details the information we usually record in our
own aquatic logs:
 Date and place of purchase
 Number and type of tankmates
 Monthly growth record
 Common and scientific names
 Sex, size, and color
 Preferred temperature, dH, pH, and lighting requirements 
 Type of feeder and preferred diet
 Environmental distribution (for example, “found in Guatemala and
Mexico”)
 Social behavior (whether it gets along with other species or needs its
own tank) and what type of tankmates it tolerates
 Spawning date and number of fry
 A disease record that includes the type of disease, date contracted,
treatment, and how long the treatment took to work
 Date and cause of death
 Any personal comments
Photographing Your Fish 
the Old-Fashioned Way
Okay, just admit it, buried deep within your creative depths is a shutterbug
itching to get the old, dusty, 35mm (millimeter) camera out of the attic and
snap a few quick photos. Or maybe you’re just an enthusiastic hobbyist like
268
Part IV: Breeding and Other Fun Stuff 

ourselves, continually searching for new and exciting ways to enhance your
aquarium-keeping records. In any case, see this book’s color section to get a
sense of how beautiful and exciting aquarium photography can be.
Many hobbyists try their hands at selective breeding at one time or another.
Have you finally succeeded in breeding the perfectly colored platy and now
feel an overwhelming need to capture and preserve that beauty? Have you
had a fish for a long time that has become very dear to you? Fish photogra-
phy can offer a new challenge for you.
There are a variety of reasons for photographing fish: You may want to cap-
ture the beauty of your aquarium and email these aquatic treasures to your
family, friends, and colleagues. Nothing compares to the pride you feel when
others openly admire your aquatic and photographic creativity. 
Another good reason to consider fish photography is that you can turn good-
quality fish photos into extra spending money if you catch the right scene,
interaction, or pose on film. Many aquarium magazines, stock photo houses,
and publishers purchase photos to use in their articles. It takes time to build
up a photo business, so don’t quit your day job until you are established. 
All types of fish photos are important resources for historical preservation. In
today’s world where once-abundant species are slipping into extinction at an
alarming rate, photographs may become the only reminder to future genera-
tions that a particular species of fish once existed and is now extinct due to
human carelessness.
Get to know the personalities and habits of the fish you’re taking pictures of
and make sure the fish are healthy and happy before starting your photo
shoot.
After all is said and done, the most important rule of fish photography is 
have fun!
There are many places to practice your aquatic photography outside the
home, such as zoos, aquariums, and fish shows. Check your local phonebook
for great opportunities to try out your photography skills.
The camera
Almost any camera works well for fish photography. However, a single-lens
reflex (SLR) camera has several options that other cameras lack:
 The picture you see through the camera lens on an SLR is basically the
image that you see in the finished and developed photo.
 You can easily equip most SLRs with auxiliary wide angle, telephoto,
macro, and zoom lenses.
269
Chapter 21: Recording Data and Photographing Fish

 SLRs are capable of taking synchronized electronic flash pictures, which
can help you capture the action of fast-moving pets.
 You can purchase a wide variety of cool attachments such as filters to
help you make interesting shots and create different types of scenes.
 A 35mm SLR makes you look like a pro if you get a cool camera strap and
have a bunch of accessories crammed into a stylish bag.
However, the most important thing is to get the shot. Start with a camera that
is equipped with automatic exposure so you don’t miss shots fumbling with
numerous settings. Many SLRs, including digital SLRs, have a fully automatic
feature, but some cameras are so complex that by the time you set up every-
thing for your shot, your fishy subject has spawned several times and is
about to collect Social Security. (If someone is watching as you, simply wipe
imaginary sweat off your forehead, fiddle with all the camera buttons, and
look relieved when the shot is over.)
Another good reason to begin with an SLR is that you can start with a 35 mm
camera body and a standard 50 mm lens and then gradually add to the unit
as your interests and experience expand. Inexpensive instamatic cameras
usually have a fixed lens, and the quality of the picture compared to that of
an SLR is the difference between a Rembrant and our son’s attempt at finger-
painting his bedroom walls. 
Throwaway cameras are not great for fish photography either. With this type
of camera, you shoot the film, take the camera in to develop the photos, and
they throw the camera away. This type of camera doesn’t take the best qual-
ity photos and is very limited to point and shoot type scenes.
Mount your camera on a sturdy tripod to help eliminate blurred pictures
caused by camera shake. You can find cheap tabletop plastic tripods at camera
shops that will work fine. If you don’t have a tripod, support the camera on a
table or firm surface.
The film
The simple fact is, if you want good-quality photos, you must purchase the
highest quality film on the market. In our opinion, Kodak is the best film
made and produces the truest color.
Cutting costs with inexpensive or low-grade film costs you much more in the
long run (buying tons of film to get a good-looking shot on bad film) than if
you had just spent a few extra pennies on a better quality roll. Ask any pro-
fessional photographer, and she’ll tell you the same thing. When you are first
starting out, you can save money by purchasing rolls of film with more expo-
sures (36 instead of 12 exposures).
270
Part IV: Breeding and Other Fun Stuff 

Always choose the slowest-speed film possible to avoid the grainy pictures
produced by faster films. Film speed is measured in numbers such as 100,
200, 400 and 800, and the lower the number, the slower the film speed and the
higher the level of detail, but the more light you’ll need to get good pictures
(see later in this chapter for more on lighting). A slow, fine-grained film such
as ASA 100 produces higher quality images that can also be enlarged with
better results than does a faster film such as ASA 400, which often makes
your pictures look as if they were taken during a desert windstorm. Increase
the lighting before you attempt to increase film speed. Begin with a 100 speed
film and work from there. 
Make sure to have plenty of extra film on hand, because it may take several
rolls to get the one perfect shot you’re seeking. After you achieve lighting
proficiency and mastery of the camera and lenses, consider using slide film
(very slow film that offers bright, realistic color saturation,) which gives you
the ultimate in color saturation and picture quality.
Don’t overlook black-and-white film, either, which can be a simple yet excit-
ing medium that adds artistic impact to shots of rugged fish such as a convict
cichlid, and can show the delicate shades and fin details of a veiltail angel.
Black-and-white photography is an art form in itself, and you can get even
more creative with it if you decide to develop your own film in a darkroom.
Lenses
A standard 50 mm lens works great on fish longer than 5 inches. But when
working with smaller fish, use a zoom, telephoto, or macro lens to help elimi-
nate background material. A macro lens is designed for taking close-ups and
offers a 1:1 ratio, which results in a large center-of-attention subject in the fin-
ished photo. A 105 mm macro lens works great for small fish such as a pencil
fish. However, macro filters can result in decreased sharpness and depth of
field.
A zoom lens allows you to change the focal length of your lens to capture 
different sizes of fish (and spy on your neighbors after the photo session). 
A 100–200 mm zoom lens is a good lens to use for most smaller fish.
Telephoto lenses enlarge images that are far away and provide you with the
freedom to work at a distance from the aquarium. Taking photos from a
healthy distance helps avoid the possibility of your fish going into cardiac
arrest from fright during photo sessions.
The three disadvantages of telephoto and zoom lenses are as follows:
 Camera shake due to the larger size and heavier weight of the lens if you
don’t use a tripod
271
Chapter 21: Recording Data and Photographing Fish

 A shallower depth of field (zone of sharp focus), which tends to blur out
any background
 A slight loss of quality in the finished prints
Take time to experiment with different lenses to become aware of the advan-
tages and disadvantages of each type. Look through photo magazines and
books to gain new ideas on the various uses of each lens length. Talk to other
photographers about their experiences using different lenses.
Black and white and the darkroom
Learning the art of developing black-and-white photos in a darkroom pro-
vides you with a good opportunity to display not only your fish photos, but
your creativity as well. You can sandwich negatives to create double images,
and enhance or darken certain areas of the photo to suit your needs.
Manipulating photos in the darkroom also helps you cover up embarrassing
mistakes before your friends see them. After learning a few tricks, you can
even add a picture of a fish you took at a public aquarium to your photo just
in case all of your real aquatic pets look boring.
If you’re not familiar with darkroom techniques, your local college or photog-
raphy shop can probably provide you with a course in developing your own
photo prints. It’s worth your time and effort to check out this exciting aspect
of photography.
Photographing Your Fish with 
Digital Photography
Digital photography is growing in popularity and is now a good alternative 
to film-based cameras. Digital images are made up of small squares called
pixels, which resemble a bunch of very tiny tiles laid out to make the image.
Digital cameras are judged by their pixel count, which is represented in mil-
lions and abbreviated by MP (megapixels). So, a 3MP camera has 3 million
pixels, or megapixels. The pictures are stored on small memory cards instead
of on film. You then transfer the images from the card to your computer or a
printer.
There are many digital cameras to choose from. Cell phones and inexpensive
cameras typically offer 2MP. This is good for emailing photos, but not much
else. The 3MP camera is good for 4 x 6 photos and is relatively inexpensive.
272
Part IV: Breeding and Other Fun Stuff 

The 4MP takes close to photo lab quality pictures and is a good all-round
camera. The 5MP+ cameras are great for outstanding photo quality, but can
be very expensive. Generally, the higher the MP, the more expensive the
camera.
There are many advantages to using a digital camera. Most digital cameras
have an LCD (liquid-crystal display) screen, which allows you to see what the
captured image will look like before you take the photo, and also let’s you
preview it after you take the photo to see if it’s worth keeping. You can take
hundreds of photos on a typical memory card and only keep the very best.
Using a digital camera allows you to save on the cost of film that is often
wasted on shots that don’t come out well. And most digital cameras are very
light in weight compared to many film based models.
Printing your work
Once you have taken your wonderful fish photos with a digital camera, you
can print them out on your computer’s printer or email them to friends. You
can also scan film photos into a computer and print them out, too. For higher
quality prints, most film development shops can print your digital photos
directly from your memory card.
Computer-aided fish photography
In order to store your wonderful fish photos, you can turn to your trusty
computer. The images from your camera (and scanned photos) can be trans-
ferred from your camera to your hard drive for storage. However, hard drives
can get viruses and crash or die, so if you have a CD burner, you should
transfer your images to a CD so that you have another copy. 
Photos can also be altered and improved using different varieties of image-
manipulation software, such as Adobe Photoshop (expensive) and Paint Shop
Pro (not so expensive). Many digital cameras come with basic software for
this purpose as well.
273
Chapter 21: Recording Data and Photographing Fish
Aquarium webcams
Many digital cameras also allow you to take dig-
ital videos. Also, cheap “eyeball” webcams are
now available at most electronics stores. This
option is great for capturing an entire aquarium
of fish swimming happily in their aquatic home.
You could even make a Web site so that friends
and family (and you) can see your fish from any-
where that has an Internet connection.

Lighting Techniques 
The main hood lights on an aquarium usually do not provide sufficient light-
ing to take good photos. If your tank has fluorescent lamps, you may end up
with a green cast on your finished pictures; if you use tungsten lamps, an
orange cast may appear. You’re much better off using electronic flash or
strobe units that provide proper lighting and freeze motion.
Ideally, you place your photography tank (see later in this chapter for more
on photography tanks) in natural sunlight, which far exceeds artificial light-
ing in terms of color, shadow, and mood. The disadvantage of natural lighting
is that the direct sunlight can quickly heat up the water in a small tank to
lethal levels and turn your fish into a broiled entrees. Take great care to
ensure that the water remains cool until you’re ready to start the photogra-
phy session, and that you don’t leave them in direct sunlight for too long. A
large, thick towel to cover the entire tank and block out the heavy sunlight is
a great tool to have handy if you need to take a short break.
Another factor to take into consideration is that the sunlight two hours after
sunrise and two hours before sunset is generally discolored and should be
avoided. Photos taken in natural sunlight during these times tend to have a
yellowish cast unless you use special filters. It is much better to take photos
in natural sunlight during the late morning or early afternoon hours when the
sun is high in the sky.
In recent years, large flood lights have become quite popular in fish photogra-
phy. Caution is advised when using these lights as they have the potential to
quickly heat water. Always check the heat intensity of these floodlights
before using them.
If you’re using one strobe light, direct it at the tank from a 45-degree angle
near the top of the aquarium. If you use two strobe lights, place them at the
same angle on opposite sides of the tank.
The 45-degree angle offers these advantages:
 Shadows appear below the fish and give your photos a natural look.
These shadows also possess a softer tone than those in photos using
straight-on lighting and are more appealing to the eye.
 You avoid flash reflection off the glass, which can ruin an otherwise
good shot. Another method to avoid excess reflection is to wrap a 
black-cardboard tube around the lens on your camera. This tube is
known as a mask. 
274
Part IV: Breeding and Other Fun Stuff 

Strobe lights generally have a flash duration of 1⁄1500 of a second and are very
effective in stopping action if you are photographing a fast-swimming fish in a
large tank that isn’t equipped with restraining glass. (A restraining glass is an
inserted piece of glass that is used in small photo tanks, usually 2–5 gallons,
to gently pin the fish against the aquarium glass so that it will not move while
its picture is being taken.) Strobe lights are usually powered either by elec-
tricity or rechargeable cadmium batteries.
If the subject of your photo session is a very dark fish, move the lighting
closer to the tank to compensate. On the other hand, if the fish is white or 
of a very light complexion, move the lighting back from the subject.
If your pictures are too dark or too light, try adjusting the lighting before 
you start messing around with lens settings. For optimal results, take a series
of pictures as you slowly adjust your lighting from near to far. You’ll be
rewarded with at least one picture with the best lighting possible. A series of
photos can be valuable to your future shots, too. You can sit down and review
different lighting angles and distances to see what worked. If you are using a
digital camera, you will be able to get a good idea of how the lighting is going
to work by using the LCD screen without wasting film. You simply follow the
camera’s instructions for erasing bad shots from the memory device.
Red-eye (also known as vampire syndrome,) is the common name for reflec-
tions caused by lighting placed very close to the subject. You can avoid it by
working with the light adjustments mention earlier in this section. For digital
shots, you can use image-manipulation software to remove most red-eye
problems.
Another option is to aim your flash or strobes up at a mirror or white card
suspended above the tank. The light reflects off the mirror or card and
bounces back onto the subject, creating a softer look. This method is popular
for delicate-looking species, such as angelfish and other long-finned tropicals.
Make sure that the mirror and cards you use are clean and free of streaks.
If you’re a fairly serious photographer, you can purchase a photographic
umbrella to diffuse light. The manager of your local photo shop can make
sure you get the proper piece of equipment for the job. Remember that a
bounced flash loses up to half of its original intensity, so adjust your calcu-
lated exposure accordingly.
Focusing Techniques 
The focus of a camera is determined by the aperture, or opening, of the lens,
which decreases as the size of the image increases. The aperture itself is a
hole in the lens which regulates the amount of light striking the film. The
275
Chapter 21: Recording Data and Photographing Fish

aperture is adjusted by a diaphragm inside the lens and is calculated in 
steps called f-stops. You can see the f-stops available on an SLR camera on the
ring on the outside of the lens. The smaller the f-stop number, the less light
required, and the smaller the depth of field, or zone of focus. With fish pho-
tography, you are usually working close up and with limited ability to provide
a lot of light, meaning smaller f-stops.
To get a large amount of the background in focus, you need a larger f stop —
or more light. The lens manufacturer usually supplies a table to help you
determine the aperture you need for the magnification you want. Or set your
camera to semi-automatic mode, if it has one, meaning you can set the shut-
ter speed to, say 1⁄60 of a second, and the camera chooses the correct aperture
automatically.
If your calculations point to an f-stop of 11, take one photo at f 8, one at f 11,
and another at f 16. This bracketing technique reduces your margin of error,
maximizes the probability of a useable shot. Keep a log of each exposure and
ask the developing lab to number your pictures so that you can gain a better
understanding of how each aperture affects your shot.
Larger lens openings (f 2, f 1.4) have a narrower depth of field (how much
area behind or in front of the subject will be in focus), which means you have
to focus more carefully. Smaller lens openings (f 16, f 22) have a larger depth
of field and require less focusing to get the correct image. Depth of field
increases with distance. The farther your camera is from your subject, the
greater the depth of field. Macro photos (extreme close ups of small objects)
have little depth of field because the lens is so close to the subject.
If all else fails, you can always have a photo studio crop your picture, which
entails having a professional cut out parts of the picture that don’t appeal to
you. Another option if you are not using a digital camera is to scan the image
into the computer using a scanner and then adjust it in your software. What’s
left is usually the shot that you were trying to get in the first place.
Composition Techniques
You need to organize all the visual elements into a balanced and appealing
scene in order to take good fish photos. All photos require a center of inter-
est (which is usually the most important image in the picture).
Obviously, most of the fish that you take pictures of are of some interest, but
other subjects in the aquarium can be accented by your aquatic pets. For
example, a piece of driftwood with an unusual shape or a brightly colored
castle can provide a center of interest that you can highlight by capturing a
small school of fish swimming nearby.

Part IV: Breeding and Other Fun Stuff 

Using the rule of thirds
One general rule of composition that always produces a pleasing balance is
to place the subject at the intersection of imaginary lines dividing the entire
scene into thirds, horizontally and vertically, as shown in Figure 21-1. This
simple but effective placement of subjects, known as the rule of thirds, often
gives excellent results. If there are other lines in the picture, try to arrange
them in such a way that something about them leads the viewer’s eye toward
the main subject.
Panning the scene
To obtain unique photos that stand out from the rest, try taking pictures of
interesting moments, such as mating rituals or feeding sessions. Another fun
thing to experiment with is a specialized effect such as panning — following 
a fish with the camera as the fish swims: You simply continue moving the
camera in the direction the fish is swimming as you depress the shutter. The
effect is a fish that’s mostly in focus but with a blurred afterimage and back-
ground that can be quite interesting as it captures motion over time. To get
the most realistic photo, keep the camera on the same horizontal plane as
the fish. (If you suddenly look down and can see the back of your knees, you
probably tilted too far down.)

Chapter 21: Recording Data and Photographing Fish

Setting up for close-ups
For good close-ups, make sure your subject fills at least 75 percent of the
frame — this keeps the background from overrunning or cluttering the shot.
Focus on the best aspects of the fish (a beautiful flowing fin, for example).
The Photography Tank
Fish can be a difficult subject to catch on film, so you need to do everything
possible to improve your odds of getting quality photos. If you plan to photo-
graph your fish in your main tank, you must take a few important factors into
consideration to insure good quality photographs.
 Clear up the water. Avoid glare (reflected light) by making sure that the
aquarium’s water is as clear as possible. Any debris or suspended parti-
cles (your toddler’s uneaten lima beans from dinner) may reflect light
and produce spots in your finished photos.
It’s a good idea to add extra mechanical filtration to the tank a few days
before you take the pictures. Another effective process is to filter all the
main tank water through standard floss (the same type you put in many
filters and can be bought at your local pet store). The only drawback to
this procedure is that it is quite time-consuming and can take anywhere
from two days to five years, depending on the size of your tank.
 Clean the tank itself and the decorations. Remove all unsightly algae
from the glass of the aquarium; otherwise your photos may end up
resembling a bad still-life of chunky pea soup. Clean all plastic plants,
rocks, and other artificial decorations before your photo session begins.
The gravel in the tank should be vacuumed prior to shooting — a photo-
graphic lens does not miss nearly as much intricate detail as the human
eye does.
 Check the aquarium glass or acrylic surface for scratches. The surface
must be scratch-free to obtain the best photos. Several commercial
scratch-removal kits on the market remove imperfections from acrylic
walls.
 Clean the lighting. If you’re using overhead or hood lighting in the pho-
tography session, make sure that the cover glass is clean so that it
allows maximum light to enter. It is mandatory that the outer glass cov-
ering each light remains translucent and clean.
Shut off all tank lights at least thirty minutes before you clean, for safety pur-
poses. (Photo lighting can be very hot and can cause serious burns if touched
or electrocution if accidentally knocked into the tank while cleaning.)

Part IV: Breeding and Other Fun Stuff 

Building your own photography tank
One of the easiest and most practical methods to insure great photos of your
fish is to construct a miniature aquarium to use exclusively for photo ses-
sions. This technique was founded by Dr. Herbert Axelrod and is an impor-
tant part of the famous Axelrod technique of photographing fish. The Axelrod
technique involves using a small photo tank with an interior restraining glass
embedded in fine sand and angled from the bottom front to the back top of
the tank. The angled glass restricts fish movement when the restraining glass
is gently leaned forward.
A photography tank is much smaller than any standard aquarium and offers
several unique advantages over a larger tank:
 Keeping the water in a mini-tank clean and clear for your pictures is
easier in a small tank.
 Arranging plants, rocks, and other decorations is simple.
 Water changes are a snap for good photos.
Building a photography tank (if you don’t choose to purchase a small aquar-
ium) is something even a beginning hobbyist can do. It doesn’t require much
time, knowledge, or lessons from Bob Vila to complete a simple tank 7 inches
high by 7 inches long and 2 inches wide. You can build tanks of other sizes to
accommodate the size of the fish you’re photographing and the materials at
hand. The glass you use to construct your mini-tank should be thinner than
standard aquarium glass to help promote good photos.
The four sides and the bottom glass of the new tank can be easily positioned
using clamps and then siliconed with aquarium sealer or aquatic-safe cement
to obtain a small rectangle. No frame or supports are really necessary if the
glass you used in construction is thin. The newly siliconed sides should be
allowed to dry for 48 hours before water is added or the tank is moved
(unless you plan on checking out your new galoshes). This will ensure that
the seal is tight and waterproof. A sixth piece of glass should be cut to size 
so that it fits into the tank like a partition. The glass should slide in easily
without scraping the sides of the tank. The safest way to do this is to go 
to a glasscutter and have it done for you, because glass cutting can be very
dangerous.
Gently place the fish you’re photographing between the front glass on the
photo tank and the restraining glass — which works like a cover slip on a
microscope slide. (If your fish’s eyes start popping out like Marty Feldman’s,
you might want to back off on the pressure a little bit.) Another advantage to
this restraining technique is that you, the photographer, have the freedom to
place the fish in creative arrangements that aren’t possible in a larger tank.
This glass restricts movement of faster swimming fish and keeps them safe
during the photo shoot.
279
Chapter 21: Recording Data and Photographing Fish

Using different backgrounds
Because flying off to the Cayman Islands or Cancun every time you feel the
urge to photograph fish is not financially practical, you can use simple non-
distracting backgrounds to allow the natural attributes and colors of your
fish to capture center stage. Many materials found around the home — a
towel, solid-color wrapping paper, and thick construction paper — make
excellent backdrops.
When choosing a background, take into consideration the color of your sub-
ject. A darker background is appropriate for a light-colored fish, such as a
glass catfish. On the other hand, you’re better off using a light background for
a dark-colored fish, such as a tiger oscar.
Try to avoid cluttering the tank or the glass with too many objects (three
plastic divers, a shipwreck, and Donald Duck on a life raft is too many) —
they may take away from the natural beauty of your fishy subject. Keep all
decorations, such as gravel, plants, and rocks to a minimum, especially in a
smaller photo tank. But these decisions are a matter of personal preference
and ultimately rest with the individual photographer. Some of the best fish
photos come about as a result of the trial-and-error method of artistic
arrangement.
280

Displaying your work
Once you have taken a bunch of fish photos, you
will want a place to store them. For printed out
photos, you can use a photo album just like you
would for family snapshots. Try to group shots
of different species and aquarium backgrounds
together if possible, so you don’t have a large
group of photos all showing the same fish. If you
want to display your digital photos, many differ-
ent types of photography computer software
allow you to create electronic photo albums to
display your shots.

E
ntering a local, regional, or national fish show can be a great way to
expand your fishkeeping hobby; win a bunch of cool prizes such as 
trophies, ribbons, equipment, and money; and display your aquarium-
keeping and breeding skills.
Fish shows also offer quite a few other personal attractions worth checking
out as well. For example, you often find people dressed up as fish, aquariums,
and equipment at these shows because they are either promoting a product
or attempting to get a little extra mileage out of their Halloween costumes.
Either way, a full-grown adult trying to win a five-pound bag of gravel by walk-
ing around with a glass fish bowl on his head can be a real scream. It is also
nice to be able to get a glance at new products that display stands have to
offer.
Many other cool things go on at fish shows — like door prizes and special
drawings. Just by showing up, you may have a chance to win neat fishkeeping
supplies, such as heaters and filters. You also find many experts in the aquar-
ium field waiting to answer any questions you may have concerning your
hobby. These pros can be representatives of manufacturing companies, or
hobbyists who have become experts in their individual fields.
If you finally decide to involve yourself in a little bit of friendly competition,
your aquarium-keeping skills will steadily improve. After all, in order to dis-
play only top-quality fish at every competition, you will need to do lots of
research on nutrition, water conditions, and other factors that influence
proper growth, good coloring, and vibrant health.

Only through research and improving your aquarium-keeping skills can you
consistently produce high-quality show fish. Sure it’s possible to get lucky
and purchase a guppy for a couple of bucks at a local fish store and have it
grow into championship material. But this is the exception rather than the
rule. So you need to do your homework.
Why Competing in Fish Shows 
Is Good for Your Fish
Participating in fish shows keeps your aquatic pets from becoming totally
bored with their lives. (If you had nothing to do but swim back and forth in
your bathtub all day, you’d probably be looking for a way out, too.) Fish are 
a lot like humans in that they need a little mental stimulation every once 
in a while.
In the wild, competing for food, avoiding larger predators that want to have
them over for lunch (literally), and other factors such as unpredictable
weather keep a fish’s senses alert and stimulate it into constant action. 
After sitting in a home aquarium for month after month, most fish appreciate
a change of pace, even if it means being carted off to a weird place where
strange-looking people with large, distorted faces walk by and stare into 
the tank. 
Despite the fact that most freshwater species are bred for the industry, their
natural instincts and desires remain intact.
Getting to Know the Shows
The great majority of aquatic competitions are organized by aquarium 
societies. These aquatic societies can be international in scope, as is the
International Betta Congress (IBC), or can be local groups in large towns and
cities. The following is a list of the types of shows you’re likely to encounter.
Small shows
Small shows (also known as bowl shows) are usually sponsored by local
clubs and generally include all different classes of fish such as goldfish, cich-
lids, and tetras. Bowl shows are set up for only a few hours so that their paid
members can exhibit their favorite wet pets. These shows are usually not
open to the general public. So, to enter the competition, you must become a
member of the society.
282
Part IV: Breeding and Other Fun Stuff 

Regional shows
Aquarium societies often enter larger fish shows that cover a broad geo-
graphic area within a marked region that can include several states. In this
type of competition, different societies compete against each other to see
who is really the top piranha. A regional show forces you to become a team
player, so make sure you have several good excuses ready, just in case your
entry doesn’t place very well.
Open shows
An open show is similar to a regional show, except that anyone can enter the
competition — you don’t have to belong to a particular aquarium society.
These shows are cool because if you don’t win, you can sneak out the back
door without having to answer to anyone else. Or you can tell family mem-
bers that you had a flat tire on the way to the show and missed the entire
competition.
Exhibitions
One of the largest shows you can enter is known as an exhibition, or aquatic
convention. These types of shows are generally put together by tropical fish
magazines and international societies. Exhibitions are massive affairs, gener-
ally held in huge auditoriums and fancy hotels. Aquarium manufacturers are
usually present to demonstrate their newest lines of tanks, food, chemicals,
and equipment to people they consider prospective buyers. (If you don’t
want to spend the day listening to sales pitches, wear old clothes and look
poor.)
Exhibitions are exciting and extremely important because they help to keep
hobbyists informed on major new trends in the hobby. If you go to one of
these shows, you will probably find a lot of excellent information on new
equipment and fishkeeping procedures. Not to mention the tons of new ideas
from other hobbyists you’ll get.
Understanding Competition Classes
You need to learn a little bit about how fish shows operate so that you know
what to expect when you enter your very first serious competition. True, fish
shows have more rules than cribbage, but you can still go to a competition,
have a great time, and pick up some important aquarium-keeping skills.
283
Chapter 22: Competing in Fish Shows

To make sure that the competition between individual fish is fair, you have to
enter your contestant in a specific class. Classes are usually grouped by simi-
lar species. For example, if you have an oscar (Astronotus ocellatus), you don’t
want to place it in a livebearer class normally intended for guppies (Lebistes
reticulatus) and mollies (Mollienesia sphenops). Your fish would be instantly
disqualified simply because it was in the wrong class. Trying to convince a
judge that your 11-inch oscar is really a champion guppy that has eaten too
much usually goes over like a lead balloon.
Classes can also be divided into smaller sub-categories. For example, a guppy
class may be divided into fantails, lyretails, and spadetails. So, before you
enter your fish in any competition, check with the show’s sponsors to make
sure that you are placing it in the correct category. It would be a shame if
your potential best of show was disqualified from the competition just
because you mistakenly placed it in the wrong class.
Getting Your Fish in Shape for the Show
At competitions, you want your fish to make the best overall impression it
possibly can. If your entry bolts for the corner of the tank when the judge
comes up for her first look, your entry probably won’t receive high marks
because the judge didn’t have the opportunity to look it over properly.
Swimming upright and smiling
A good show fish isn’t shy around strangers and doesn’t panic every time 
someone walks by its tank. There probably will be many visitors — competitors
and other hobbyists — sneaking over to take a quick peak at your entry
before the judging begins. You don’t want a bunch of people hanging around
your tank and spooking your fish while it is trying to remain calm after being
transported from its home to the show.
If your fish happens to be shy, it most likely will be digging an escape tunnel
by the time the judge gets around to looking in the tank. So a little training is
in order. There is really no big difference between fish and other domesti-
cated pets as far as training is concerned. Conditioning works well for your
aquatic pets, just as it does for your four-legged friends. To keep your show
fish from being easily frightened by the presence of strangers, you need to
create conditions at home similar to those found in competition.
Placing your show fish’s holding tank in a moderate traffic area gets your
entry used to people passing back and forth. How your fish reacts to people
socially is known as deportment. Make sure your fish is used to people being
around its tank everyday, but don’t overdo it. 
284
Part IV: Breeding and Other Fun Stuff 

Ideally, your fish should act naturally, be active and alert, and show no fear
after being trained for a short period of time. Another trick you can use at
home is to periodically shine a light into the water so that your fish is pre-
pared for sudden illumination — just in case a judge uses a flashlight during
observation. A bad show fish swims upside down and looks bummed out.
A poor show fish exhibits unusual behaviors such as hanging out in areas of
the tank that it normally wouldn’t. For example, if your cory normally lives on
the bottom level of the tank but is trying to fly two inches above the water
level, a judge probably will mark it down for its odd behavior. If your fish is
floating upside down, or looks ready for the great fish bowl in the sky, then
you need to reevaluate your strategies and goals for raising top-quality fish.
Your entry should always be in top physical form. Start with a good specimen
and then make sure it receives proper nutrition by feeding it a varied diet
consisting of commercially pre-manufactured flakes and different types of live
food. The water conditions your show fish is raised in should always be opti-
mal, with good filtration and the proper water chemistry for the species.
The holding tank
When you spend a great deal of time, effort, and expense raising a show-
quality fish, you want to make sure it does not encounter any physical prob-
lems prior to a competition. For example, if you were a professional model,
you probably would not begin taking karate or boxing lessons a week before
a photo shoot — the results could be disastrous.
A small holding tank is a great (and inexpensive) way to keep your show fish
healthy and free from physical harm in the month or two preceding its com-
petition. A holding tank negates the possibility of other fish damaging your
prize entry’s fins or scales by not allowing physical contact, which in turn
prevents untimely fighting or breeding.
Your holding tank should be free from large decorations (such as sharp
rocks) with the potential to damage your show fish. A few floating plants and
a couple of rooted specimens give your entry the security it needs to remain
stress-free. A smaller tank also allows you to carefully monitor your fish’s
progress, and makes cleaning and frequent water changes a snap.
The smaller environment of a holding tank allows you to check for any dis-
ease that may manifest during this waiting period. Physical ailments can be
treated quickly and easily in a smaller tank. Solitary confinement also keeps
your entry stress-free and calm until it’s time to enter competition and really
show off. Being alone in a semi-bare tank prepares your pet for the same con-
ditions it faces during an exhibition. 
285
Chapter 22: Competing in Fish Shows

Exhibiting Your Fish Properly
After you find and train your show fish, you need the guidelines for exhibiting
them properly. The following tips can help your fish put its best fin forward:
 Study the rules carefully before you fill out an entry form so that you
have a good idea of the requirements for the individual competitions.
 Fill out all your paperwork properly and legibly and submit it on time.
 Get your show fish to the competition with plenty of time to spare. This
gives your entry an opportunity to calm down and regain any color it
may have lost during transportation to the show. (Fish lose color when
they’re distressed, and transporting them is stressful for them.) 
Water conditions
Bring water with you so that your fish can remain in familiar conditions during
the competition. Water supplies provided at the show may be very different
from those at your home. Discontinue feeding your fish the night before the
competition to avoid water fouling (remember, it’s good for fish to fast one
day a week) and change the water frequently to keep your show tank looking
crystal clear. If possible, use water that is a couple degrees warmer than what
your fish is accustomed to — this generally helps fish show better. Make sure
to provide an airstone, if possible, to keep the water well-oxygenated.
Tank considerations
It is important to place your show fish in a tank that correctly matches its
size. For example, a single guppy in a 10-gallon tank is dwarfed by the sheer
water volume and tends to look rather miniscule. It’s better to show this type
of fish in a 5-gallon container. On the other hand, an eight-inch plecostomus
doesn’t look very good in a 2-gallon container. It doesn’t have the room to
display all its fins, or the other attributes that may make it a winner. If you
have to use a shoehorn to cram your entry into its show tank, then the aquar-
ium is probably too small, and if you need a telescope to spot your fish in its
show tank, then the aquarium is probably too large.
To set up an exhibition tank properly, read the competition’s rules. For exam-
ple, some categories and competitions allow gravel and decorations, whereas
others do not. If you use gravel, make sure it complements the fish you’re
showing. If you have a dark-colored fish, lighter gravel will show off its colors
286
Part IV: Breeding and Other Fun Stuff 

much more naturally than a darker-toned substrate. However, make sure you
use the same color gravel you choose for the show in the fish’s home tank for
at least two weeks before a competition so that it feels safe and secure with
that color.
Here are a few more tips for competitors:
 If the competition allows tank backgrounds, choose a solid-colored
sheet over one with a pattern that takes away from the natural beauty of
your show fish.
 When using plants for decorations, in such categories as community or
species tanks, always use fauna native to the region of the fish you’re
showing. Take my word for it, judges do know the difference. A natural
setup always scores higher points than one that is a mishmash of plants
from completely different geographic regions. Use live plants if possible
for a more natural look that most artificial plants cannot match.
 The tank or container you use to display your entry should be immacu-
late. The glass walls should be clean inside and out. Vacuum any dirt or
debris off the bottom of the tank right before the competition begins.
(Or avoid this problem by bringing extra water with you.)
 Make sure your show tank is well covered because you do not want your
fish jumping out during all the excitement. A lid also prevents people’s
hands and foreign objects from getting into the water.
After you get everything set up, step back for a moment and take a good look
at the overall picture. Does the entire tank look clean and well kept? Is the
water crystal clear? Are the decorations in the tank placed so that your fish
has the best chance to show itself in front of the judge? Does the tank look
natural? Does your fish look calm and happy? Does your entry seem to be
adjusting to its surroundings well? If you can answer yes to all these ques-
tions, your fish is ready for competition.
Judging Guidelines for Your Fish:
Another Point of View
In most competitions, judging guidelines are very strict. Usually, contestants
are not allowed to be present when the judging takes place. So, if you want to
do a little brown-nosing, do it before the competition starts. For example,
simply walk up to a judge, smile, and compliment him on how much he looks
like Jacques Cousteau.
287
Chapter 22: Competing in Fish Shows

Each class usually has its own judge. The judge is supposed to mark your
entry on its own merit, not compare it to the other fish in the competition.
But judges are human, and an outstanding fish sitting in the next tank over
may have a slight bearing on the outcome of your own entry’s marks.
After all fish are judged, the “best of show” is awarded to the highest quality
entry of all the classes combined. This decision is usually reached by a group
conference — the individual judges all get together to vote for what they con-
sider to be the best overall fish at the show. An important thing to remember
is that the marks that your fish receives generally are from a single judge’s
point of view. So try to resist the temptation to verbally tear every judge limb
from limb because of what you consider to be serious oversights and bad
vision. Nobody likes a spoilsport, so keep your cool and just remember that
you are enjoying your hobby at a new level.
To keep judging from becoming too personal, aquarium societies devised a
set of standards that each individual fish in a competition can be judged
against. The fish that comes closest to matching a set standard in each cate-
gory is usually determined the winner. This policy keeps the fish from being
judged on personal preference only. Judges come from a wide range of back-
grounds and aquarium-keeping skill levels. Most are experienced hobbyists
or dealers who complete special training at schools that teach them how to
judge fish shows efficiently.
Each competition’s evaluation system varies slightly, but most show fish are
judged on a point system. A certain number of points are allotted for different
physical traits, such as size and color. The fish with the most total points
after the judging is complete is considered the winner. In the event of a tie,
the fish are judged again, or a decision is made by all the judges together.
Judges disagree quite a bit, so don’t hold your breath waiting for a unani-
mous decision, or you may pass out from lack of oxygen.
Size and body weight
One of the main physical traits that consistently inspire judges to give a fish
high marks is its overall size. Judges generally look for a fish that has reached
its full stage of adulthood and is the maximum size for that particular
species. In other words, the bigger the better. So an oscar, which should be
10 or 11 inches long, probably won’t win if it resembles a minnow with
anorexia. If you are able to raise a fish to achieve its full physical potential, a
judge may feel that you are a responsible aquarium keeper who takes pride in
his/her hobby.
288
Part IV: Breeding and Other Fun Stuff 

Your fish’s body is judged on several different criteria:
 To begin with, your entry should have all of its body parts intact.
 Your fish should not have any unusual growths, such as humps on the
head (except in the case of some cichlids, where a hump is consider
normal in the males of the species) or large unnatural bends in the back,
which is considered a sign of old age in most aquatic species.
 The body of a good-quality show fish is free from deformities and is in
correct proportions for its species.
Color and fins
A fish’s body color is produced by pigmentation and reflected light. In the
wild, fish use these colors for defensive and mating purposes. In competition,
fish must meet the coloration standards expected of an aquarium-bred
species. Especially in show species such as the discus (which is bred artifi-
cially to produce amazing colors like tangerine and numerous cobalt varia-
tions), color can be a major factor in determining points.
Fish have the ability to darken and lighten their colors or even change them
completely, depending on their surroundings and the time of day. Moods
such as fright, stress, and excitement, and other factors, such as illness, can
change a fish’s color quickly. Take all these variables into consideration while
monitoring your candidate’s color. (If your fish glows in the dark, it probably
has sufficient color to sweep any competition.)
The color on your entry should be evenly disbursed, and it should not look
faded or patchy unless typical for the species. The color itself should be 
very dense, not superficial, and your fish should not look as if it’s been run
through a chlorine cycle in your washer. The area where two colors meet
should be distinct and well defined, not blurred or run together so that the
fish resembles a tie-dyed shirt.
Recently, a few unscrupulous breeders started using enhancing devices to
increase the coloration of their fish. As far as hobbyists are concerned, this
practice is immoral. The artificial color fades in time and generally doesn’t
look natural at all. An artificially colored fish is similar to a studio’s colorized
version of an old movie. If you saw Humphrey Bogart running around in a
shocking pink hat and purple trousers, you’d know that Casablanca had been
colorized. The same type of color errors show up on your fish and are noticed
immediately by the judges when you use color-intensifying foods (such as
spirulina) or hormones to artificially enhance your fish’s appearance.
289
Chapter 22: Competing in Fish Shows

Never attempt to dye your fish to increase their color for showing, or pur-
chase artificially colored fish for showing. This practice consists of injecting
colored pigments into a fish’s body and is unethical. Some species such as the
glassfish develop a disease known as lymphocystis that causes growths on
their fins, so never put a fish’s health at risk by partaking in cruel practices.
Fins are judged very strictly in a competition. Your entry should have all the
fins that are standard for its species. If your fish should have one dorsal fin,
one anal fin, two pectoral fins, one caudal fin, and two pelvic fins — then it
had better have all seven fins. Some species of fish have an extra adipose fin.
If your fish falls into this category, make sure it has one. If it doesn’t, don’t
enter it. If your fish is missing its tail or dorsal fin, wait until the next competi-
tion, because this physical problem doesn’t go over very well with judges.
All the fins on your entry should be in good condition. Make sure there are 
no frayed or ragged fins to detract from your fish’s natural beauty. The fins
should be erect and of good color, not clamped or folded. To keep a show
fish’s fins in top-quality condition, keep it by itself prior to the competition 
so that more aggressive fish don’t get a chance to tear or damage its fins.
Other causes of poor-quality fins include inadequate water conditions, net-
ting, genetic problems, disease, and breeding spats. Make sure the water con-
ditions in your show fish’s tank always remain optimal so that the fish
doesn’t contract a fungal disease that can easily damage its fins.
To avoid having your entry’s fins destroyed by netting, always use a plastic
bag or cup to capture your fish.
Genetic problems are permanent, and the only thing you can do when you
come across a deformity is to weed out that particular fish from your list of
candidates for fish show competitions. Often, certain species of fish damage
their pectoral fins when they fan eggs during breeding. For that very reason,
it is best not to breed your show fish before competition.
Fins are no different from any other physical attribute and are judged against
an accepted norm. Many species of betta (Betta splendens) are bred for long-
flowing fins, and judges expect fin lengths and sizes in the proper proportion
to the fish’s body size. All fins should have a symmetrical (even) look pleas-
ing to the judge’s eye. If one pectoral fin is quite a bit shorter than the other,
your entry probably will lose some points for this deformity right off the bat.
It is important to check out the requirements and rules of every competition
carefully ahead of time so that you know exactly what the judges are looking
for. Talk to hobbyists who have entered competitions in the classes you’re
interested in. You can pick up a lot of interesting ideas and learn a few good
tips by talking to seasoned pros who have already battled the “ins and outs”
of many fish competitions.

Part IV: Breeding and Other Fun Stuff 

Overall condition
Many physical factors can have a bearing on your entry’s final point score.
Judges look for an overall picture of perfection — a combination of many
individual physical traits. Even minor blemishes or irregularities can lose
points for your entry.
The scales on your fish’s body should be intact and in excellent condition. In
many species, scales form standard patterns. This must always be taken into
consideration. Scales should lie flat against the body, have a proper mucus
coating, and not protrude at odd angles. Gill covers should be straight and
preferably red in color, which is an indication of good health.
Your entry’s eyes must be clear and bright, and not clouded over or protrud-
ing abnormally from the sockets. (If your fish looks like it has a hangover,
pack up and go home.) Your fish should be completely free from disease
because any sign of parasites, fungus, or other illness is just cause for an
immediate mark down on the judge’s score sheet.
Transporting Fish to and from a Show
Transportation safely to and from a show is important for your fish’s overall
health. You want to avoid stressing out or physically damaging your entry on
the way to the show so that it has the best chance of remaining happy and
healthy and can display its beautiful physical attributes to the best of its 
ability.
The first thing to do when considering transportation is look at the distance
between your home and the show area. You need to give yourself plenty of
time so that you don’t have to rush to the show and hastily try to set up your
entry tank at the last minute. Always allow plenty of time in case something
should go wrong. Any unforeseen delay can become disastrous if you’re
forced to rush your entry in right before the judging begins.
Drive your route to the competition ahead of time so that you know exactly
how long it takes and what the road conditions are like. If the roads are
rough, plan on adding a little more cushioning to your packing box. Check the
predicted weather for the day of the competition, so that you’re prepared in
the event of heavy rain, extreme heat, frigid cold, or snow. These factors are
especially crucial on longer trips.
291
Chapter 22: Competing in Fish Shows

It really doesn’t matter if you plan to show one fish or several fish as far as
transportation containers are concerned. You should always transport your
fish in a proper carrying case or tank to make sure that their journey is as
comfortable as humanly possible.
A good transportation tank can be a small plastic or acrylic aquarium that is
insulated by a Styrofoam container. Or you can use a 5-gallon bucket with a
tight fitting lid. 
Place your transportation tank in something that will insulate it and absorb
shocks while you’re carrying it in your car. A homemade wooden case that
you place in the back seat or hatchback of your vehicle works well. Try to
avoid carrying your fish in the trunk or other uninsulated areas that can
quickly overheat or chill the water during the trip.
Cover your containers with dark cloth to help calm your entry during trans-
portation. You should always use a battery-operated air pump to keep the
water aerated.
Remember to Have Fun
The most important thing to remember when you go to a fish show is to have
fun. Take time to chat with fellow hobbyists so that you can make new
friends, learn important aspects of fishkeeping from others, and catch up on
the newest trends in the fishkeeping hobby.
If you win at a show . . . congratulations! If not, there is always the next show
to look forward to. Enjoy the moment either way.

Aquarium Hobbyist
In This Chapter
 Discovering the joys of progressive fishkeeping
 Understanding a brackish and marine system
 Comparing systems
O
nce you become successful at keeping freshwater fish, you may begin to
wonder what else is out there. Not all water is equal, as you learned in a
previous chapter, and some aquatic bodies are brackish (slightly salty) or
fully saltwater. Different fish, plants, and invertebrates live in these waters.
Brackish systems are easy to set up. Marine systems are a little more difficult.
Saltwater Aquariums for Dummies, 2nd Edition by Gregory Skomal (Wiley
Publishing, 2006) walks you through the entire marine aquarium process.
Brackish Aquariums
Fish for brackish aquariums are often unavailable from local pet stores and
are usually more expensive than freshwater fish. The water in a brackish
aquarium lies somewhere between fresh and marine in salt content. Popular
species include monos, archers, puffers, and scats. Mollies can also be kept
in a brackish tank. Natural brackish systems fluctuate from season to season
due to rains and evaporation, and brackish fish are well adapted to surviving.
The equipment for a brackish system is similar to that for a freshwater setup,
but only specific plants can tolerate a brackish system. The salt content in
brackish systems can be achieved easily using synthetic marine mix in a ratio
of one gallon of saltwater to every two gallons of freshwater. Your tank will
basically end up being one-third saltwater and two-thirds freshwater. 

There are not as many choices in brackish fish as there are for other systems,
because few species in the wild can survive in an environment that is con-
stantly changing. The good news is that brackish fish are very hardy, easy 
to feed, and many are very exciting to watch due to their high activity 
levels. Several plants work well in the brackish tank, including hornwort
(Ceratophyllum demersum), Vallisneria gigantea, and Vallisneria asiatica.
Saltwater Marine Aquariums
Marine or saltwater systems, not surprisingly, require saltwater. You see
marine fish on scuba and underwater television programs. The most popular
of these fish includes the coral reef species often found living in close proxim-
ity to various invertebrates (animals without backbones). Saltwater fish are
often very colorful and beautiful. They can also be very expensive.
The saltwater in a marine system is obtained by mixing fresh water with a
manufactured salt mix available at fish shops. A good filtration system is
important in marine tanks to keep oxygen levels high and ammonia levels
low. Marine fish have lower tolerance to ammonia than freshwater species
do, and an inadequate filter soon leads to disaster in a saltwater tank.
Types of marine systems
There are three main types of saltwater aquariums:
 Coldwater marine: Many tanks of this type house animals such as lob-
sters and rockfish that are native to colder ocean areas.
 Tropical marine: These heated tanks generally contain fish native to
coral reef areas, such as tangs, clownfish, and damsels.
 Reef tank: Some reef tanks contain only invertebrates, such as
anemones and scallops and organisms growing on live rock. Live rock is
rock that has live beneficial organisms attached to it that provide food
sources for your fish and help keep the water clean.
You can set up a saltwater system in a variety of ways (see Figure 23-1 for one
example). Invertebrates are a little more difficult to care for, so if you do set
up a saltwater system you may want to start with a fish-only tank.
294
Part IV: Breeding and Other Fun Stuff 

Gaining a little experience with a freshwater system is a great way to prepare
yourself to enter the marine side. A beginner can maintain a successful
marine tank, but the lessons you learn are expensive. We see many new hob-
byists become disheartened because they start out with a marine setup
that’s too much to handle. If you have a friend experienced in marine sys-
tems, ask her for advice — she may be able to get you started successfully.
Many marine fish are social time bombs waiting to explode all over the other
fish in your tank. In fact, saltwater fish can be down right rude. Most commu-
nity freshwater fish have reached a state of enlightenment or something like
that, and are pretty cool with each other.
Marine invertebrates
Invertebrates are animals that have no backbone. They are animals even
though many of them look like plants of some sort. Invertebrates make salt-
water aquariums look very cool. Invertebrates make up a surprisingly large
number of the total animal population. About 2 million species of animals
inhabit the earth, and roughly 97 percent of them are invertebrates.

Chapter 23: For the Advanced Aquarium Hobbyist

Many fish and invertebrates do not mix well. Marine fish such as the parrot-
fish enjoy eating several types of invertebrates. To set up an aquarium with
marine fish and invertebrates that can live together in relative harmony with-
out destroying each other, you will have to do a lot of research. 
Comparing Freshwater and Saltwater
Systems
There are a few pros and cons to marine and freshwater aquariums that you
should consider.
Adaptability
Freshwater aquarium fish originally came from rivers and lakes that are con-
stantly in motion and affected by changing temperatures and conditions.
A large majority of freshwater aquatic pets are bred for the fishkeeping indus-
try, but they are still naturally resistant to fluctuations in their environment
due to genetic adaptation. This does not mean you should keep freshwater
fish in less than excellent aquarium conditions, but freshwater fish will gener-
ally be a bit more forgiving of mistakes than marine species.
Marine species are much more sensitive to even slight fluctuations in their
aquarium conditions. This does not mean that they will automatically die the
second your water temperature drops one degree. However, if the marine
species tank does not remain consistent in temperature and salinity (amount
of salt in the water), you could easily lose an entire tankful of fish.
Availability
It is generally much easier to find live plants for a freshwater aquarium than
it is to find invertebrates for a marine tank in local stores. However, marine
invertebrates can be easily purchased over the Intranet. You may have to
wait for certain species of marine invertebrates and fish to become available
as divers bring them in. Thankfully, more hobbyists and aquarium industry
folks are beginning to find ways to breed more species of marine fish.
296
Part IV: Breeding and Other Fun Stuff 

Cost
On average, marine fish are much more expensive than freshwater species.
Compare a two-dollar guppy to a queen triggerfish costing several hundred
dollars. A large marine tank could be very expensive to stock, and your wallet
takes a huge hit if anything goes wrong. However, most aquarium hobbyists
think marine species are well worth the extra money.
Beauty and friendliness
Marine fish are generally more colorful and larger than freshwater species. If
you really like eye-popping colors in your aquarium, the marine side of the
hobby will really dazzle you with brilliant yellow tangs, vibrant parrotfish,
and many other spectacular species of saltwater fish. Generally you cannot
keep as many marine fish in the same space as freshwater fish because the
marine fish are larger and generally require more room to move around.
Equipment
Substrate and equipment are a bit more expensive for the marine aquarium.
Freshwater gravel is less expensive than marine dolomite, and freshwater
lighting costs less than the full-spectrum lighting of a marine reef system.
Many hobbyists are happy keeping only freshwater systems, whereas others
plunge into the brackish and marine worlds. All the information you need is
out there in books, periodicals, pet stores, and on the Internet.

Ten Cool Aquarium Gadgets
In This Chapter
 Discovering what to keep around the house just in case
 Understanding why you might need something very cool
 Checking out gadgets you never knew existed
Aquarium Claws (Those Handy 
Picker-Upper Doodads)
An aquarium claw is really not as menacing as its name might imply. This
little plastic claw (such as Aquatic Tongs) is a very handy tool for use in the
home aquarium. It makes moving tank decorations as simple as spending
mega bucks at the fish store. A button on the end of the handle closes the
claw around an object as you depress it. After moving the item, simply
release the button to release the grip.
The long handle on this device allows you to reach almost any area of a stan-
dard aquarium without getting your hands wet. Keeping your hands (which
may be covered in germs, dirt, or household chemicals) out of the tank when-
ever possible is always a good idea. Other good uses for this tool include
inserting plants into substrate, grabbing unwanted objects from the tank
(marbles, plant debris, and so on), and removing dead fish. At an average
cost of less than ten dollars, you really can’t go wrong with this marvelous
little gadget.
Never use a claw to retrieve live fish from your aquarium!
Algae Scrapers Are Fun to Use
One simple way to remove excess algae (the green, alien-looking glop that is
blocking your view) from the aquarium glass is to use an algae scraper. There
are several types to choose from, including a long stick with attached scrub

pad/sponge that you simply slide up and down the interior glass; a two-way
magnet system; and a “glove” type that fits over your entire hand. A real good
version of this is the Kent Marine Proscraper 12-inch scraper. Personally, we
think that the simple stick model works best, because the magnet version is
difficult to work with, and the glove scraper can be quite messy to use.
Although algae can be beneficial as a natural food source, an overgrowth 
can quickly turn your crystal-clear water into mushy pea soup. Allowing a
small amount of green algae to remain on rocks and decorations is okay, but a
tank that is excessively overrun with “the green terror” is unsightly at best.
Why Owning One Net Doesn’t Cut It
As you have already noticed, fish come in a wide variety of different shapes
and sizes. Therefore, aquarium manufacturers were kind enough to create
nets to match the individual physical characteristics of whatever uncoopera-
tive aquatic friend you happen to be chasing around the tank.
If you buy one of those complete aquarium kits in a box, it will probably come
with a small net. After enjoying your aquarium for a few months, you will begin
to get the idea that one net just isn’t going to cut it. Owning one net is kind of
like a fisherman who expects to catch everything with one size of hook.
Nets are one of the most inexpensive items that you can buy for your hobby,
and they have the advantage of being very compact and easy to store. While
shopping for nets, make sure to purchase one with fine mesh for catching 
fry, add a selection of small to large nets for different size fish, and, finally,
include a few specially constructed nets for barbed and razor-toothed fish.
A Tool Box for Storing Stuff 
If you’re like us, your fish supplies are probably pretty well spread out along
the entire length of the house, garage, and backyard. When your family starts
complaining because they found fish food in the flour bin and airline tubing in
their underwear drawers, then it is probably time to purchase a storage box.
A plastic tool container or tackle box works wonders for keeping aquarium
equipment, fish food, chemicals, test kits, nets, and other supplies all in one
neat little place. And you can carry it from tank to tank if you happen to have
more than one aquarium. We prefer to buy waterproof plastic boxes that
have removable trays on top. These trays can hold small items like ther-
mometers, airstones, and medications while the bulkier items are stored
underneath.
302
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Depending on the supplies you have on hand, you may need to purchase
more than one box. Most retail chain and sporting goods stores have a good
selection in stock.
Extra Tubing for Emergencies
As standard air-line tubing ages, it may become brittle and split or leak. You
should periodically replace the tubing that is attached to your equipment
(unless you want a free water fountain to suddenly spring up in your living
room).
Tubing is inexpensive and can be purchased in short rolls or by the foot.
Whenever we find ourselves purchasing supplies, we always pick up a little
extra air-line tubing because it never hurts to have it lying around. Tubing
can also double as a mini siphon in case of emergencies. Stick one end in 
the tank, suck the air out of the other end until the water starts to rise, and
quickly transfer the tube from your mouth to a bucket below tank level.
You can buy soft tubing that is light blue in color, which blends in well with
your aquarium decorations. Soft tubing is easier to attach and bend than
stiffer tubing.
Aquarium Sealer (Flood Insurance)
If you wake up one morning and find that your living room floor resembles a
kiddy pool, then chances are one of your aquariums may be leaking. No hobby-
ist should be without a tube of aquarium-safe silicone sealer in case this cata-
strophe strikes. Besides, aquarium sealer is cool and squishy and fun to apply.
Unfortunately, in order to repair a leak, you must first drain and dry the tank
to allow the sealer to set properly. But in the long run, it is also better to
spend a couple of dollars on a tube of sealer instead of several hundred dol-
lars on a new tank. Once in a while, factory sealer will fail due to age, weather
conditions, and high or uneven water pressure. So make sure that you are
always prepared. (Or buy extra flood insurance.)
Gang Valves to Hook Up Neat Junk
Despite the fact that as caring hobbyists we always strive to create a “natural
environment” for our aquatic pets, we all fall prey at one time or another to
the uncontrollable urge to buy those cool-looking plastic aquarium toys that
do all sorts of wild and wonderful things.
303
Chapter 24: Ten Cool Aquarium Gadgets

As we move into our second childhoods, the colorful bubbling divers, scuba-
diving cartoon characters, and sunken treasure ships that bob up and down
become just too inviting to pass by. These toys are lots of fun to watch and
can be very entertaining.
In order to hook up all this cool junk, though, you need a few gang valves. A
gang valve works like a splitter. It redirects one main air supply via tubing
into several outlets all at once. The flow of air to each outlet can be individu-
ally controlled by built-in valves. With this neat device, you can hook up
many cool aquarium toys that will keep your kids (and yourself) preoccupied
for several hours at a time.
Buckets to Slosh Around In
Buckets are beneficial tools to the fishkeeping hobbyist. Small, sturdy plastic
buckets can be used to carry hoses and other equipment, transport water,
move gravel, and temporarily hold fish. Besides, when everything in your
aquarium has suddenly jumped out of whack, simply fill two buckets with cold
water and stand in them. This procedure will help calm you down every time!
Remember to never use your aquarium buckets for other household chores,
because residual cleaning chemicals left in the bucket can kill your fish.
Multi-Outlet Plugs
Many aquariums need electrical outlet space for one or two heater plugs, one
or two light plugs, one to three air pump plugs, powerfilter or powerhead
plugs, and more, depending on your setup. As you can see, an electrical
setup can quickly outnumber your available wall plugs. A good multi-outlet
plug or bar with a built-in circuit breaker can take care of this problem.
Razor Blades (the Miracle Cleaner)
After algae and water minerals have remained on aquarium glass for any
length of time, they can be very difficult to remove and can make your tank
look like an encrusted beach pier. A dirty piece of glass spoils the appearance
of your aquarium and blocks out beneficial light that your fish and plants
need to remain healthy and happy.
You can purchase single-edged razor blades with a safety handle at your local
hardware store. This instrument will quickly remove build-up on glass and
equipment faces. As with any other sharp object, extreme caution is advised.

Ten Ways to Kill Your Fish 
Without Even Trying
In This Chapter
 Alerting yourself to things you shouldn’t do to your fish
 Reminding yourself of things you need to do to your fish
B
efore we go into discussing this, we want to mention one main thing to
avoid if you want to keep your fish reasonably happy: Don’t fuss too
much and they will be much happier and healthier.
Go Away on Vacation and Forget Them
Okay, on your last day at Disneyland, you call your boss and sadly inform him
that all of the airplanes in California have broken down, and you are being
forced to stay for an extra week. No problem. But what about your aquatic
friends?
Before going on vacation, make sure you have a reliable friend who can con-
tinue to care for your pets just in case you are gone longer than originally
planned. Another option is to purchase from your local fish dealer tablets 
or automatic feeders, which dispense food to your fish while you are gone.
Always leave enough food to cover a time period that is longer than your
intended stay.
Play Doctor Without a License
Maddy once had an aunt who had a pill to cure every real or imaginary ail-
ment known to man. The inside of her purse resembled a large pharmacy. As
mentioned elsewhere in this book, when it comes to doctoring your fish,
don’t overdo.

Many new hobbyists tend to overmedicate their tanks at the very first sign of
disease. This is a pattern that many people learned during childhood. If we
thought chicken soup and aspirin would help cure our fish, we would proba-
bly dump that into the tank as well. 
A large number of diseases can be avoided through good maintenance such
as frequent water changes. Avoid the temptation to pour medicine after medi-
cine into your tank in hopes you will find the right cure. Seek the advice of an
advanced hobbyist or tropical fish merchant who can help you pinpoint your
problem. If medication is necessary, always follow the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions to the letter and use a hospital tank if possible.
Give Your Cat a Sushi Bar
Have you ever wondered why many cat foods are shaped like fish? Well, it’s
no accident. In your cat’s tiny and distorted little brain, your new aquarium
can be considered a free sushi bar. If your tank is not covered properly, your
cat can sneak in for a quick snack while you wonder why his food is collect-
ing dust in his bowl. 
Take our word for it: No amount of pleading or yelling will keep some cats
from this habit if they decide that fresh seafood is their favorite. Make sure
that the hood you buy for your new aquarium fits properly and snugly. If you
happen to own a particularly strong or fat cat, weigh the hood down with
books or some other heavy objects so that it can’t be pried or flipped up.
Stuff Your Fish with Seven-Course Meals
Many different varieties of fish food are on the market. A good combination of
flake, frozen, and live foods help to promote good health in your wet pets.
However, you need to realize that a fish’s stomach is no larger than its eye,
and overfeeding will rapidly foul the tank and eventually lead to disease or
death. 
Fish do not require seven-course meals each day to survive. If your fish are
beginning to resemble the Pillsbury doughboy and are constantly getting
stuck between rocks, then it’s time to cut down on the chow.
Mix Apples and Oranges
While browsing your local fish shop, you find yourself suddenly becoming
attached to a large cichlid who looks as if it has been feeding on “instant
306
Part V: The Part of Tens 

grow” flakes for a decade. You automatically figure that this toughie will pro-
vide leadership skills for your unmotivated guppies. Within an hour of adding
your new leader to the tank, you are surprised to find that all of your guppies
have vanished. 
Mixing apples and oranges may be great for a summer fruit salad, but it 
doesn’t work in the home aquarium. Check with your local dealer if you 
are unsure about the compatibility of any species.
Add Too Many Fish (the 
Shoehorn Syndrome)
It is really tempting to constantly add “just one more” fish to your home
aquarium. All fishkeepers fall prey to this Shoehorn Syndrome at one time 
or another. If your aquarium resembles a phone booth-packing competition,
then you have probably overstepped the capacity. Remember, overcrowding
can be deadly.
Don’t Do Your Homework
If you want to learn more about any subject, you need to do a little research.
Skilled fishkeepers do their homework before setting up a new type of system
and they investigate specific habitat requirements prior to purchasing
unknown species of fish. Isn’t that one of the reasons that you bought this
cool book?
The Internet, a local library, and tropical fish magazines can provide you with
a lot of extra good information that will keep you informed about the newest
developments in the fishkeeping hobby as well.
Let the Neighbor’s Nasty 
Kid Play with Your Fish
A mischievous kid can be every fishkeeper’s nightmare. This is the same kid
who always shows up at dinnertime, skateboards through your petunias, and
in later years, escorts your only daughter to the senior prom.
307
Chapter 25: Ten Ways to Kill Your Fish Without Even Trying

A home aquarium is often a prime target for the neighbor’s nasty kid who will
drop all sorts of interesting objects into the tank, such as your cat, coins,
sticks, and peanut butter sandwiches. These offerings will not be appreciated
by your fish and can prove to be lethal as well. It is always best to prohibit
young children from touching your aquariums, and to quickly check your
tank for foreign objects at least once a day.
Become a Hypochondriac Hobbyist
It does not take long for a new hobbyist to get emotionally attached to their
fish. The more we bond with them, the more we tend to overpamper them.
Checking in on your fish every 30 minutes, constantly fiddling around with
the equipment, and rearranging the decorations in order to achieve the per-
fect environment just isn’t good for the fish. Maintain your aquariums, enjoy
your fish, but don’t fuss too much.
Buy Used or Cheap Equipment
Always test used equipment before purchasing it if possible. When buying
new stuff from a local dealer, make sure to purchase the best equipment that
your budget allows. Poorly made or worn-out equipment will inevitably lead
to disaster down the road.
Be wary of old electrical aquarium pumps, hoods, and heaters at the neigh-
bor’s garage sale that look worn or have frayed wires. Don’t get us wrong; we
have purchased some good aquarium equipment at garage sales, but as the
old saying goes, in most cases, you get what you pay for.

Chapter 26
Ten Scientific Fish Laws
In This Chapter
 Becoming aware of the way things sometimes happen with no warning
 Figuring out what to do when these things happen
F
rom time to time during your wonderful adventures as an aquarium hob-
byist, you may notice strange phenomena in and around your fish tanks
that cannot even be explained by modern science. Seasoned hobbyists learn
through experience that these strange occurrences actually have very simple
explanations. Here are some examples of those strange fish laws that plague
us all from time to time.
The Fish Law of Thermodynamics
The fish law of thermodynamics states that all heat in a house will flow
directly into your aquarium at all times. Window light will be absorbed by
your overheating tank immediately so that the remaining sections of your
house will convince the local astronomer that there is a black hole in the
neighborhood.
To take care of this problem, you need to make sure that your aquarium is
placed in an area that has plenty of air movement and a consistent room 
temperature. Check to make sure your aquarium heater is functioning prop-
erly, and do not set your aquarium up near doors or windows. Remember
that extreme temperature fluctuations can cause illness and death.

The Fish Law of Metamorphosis
The fish law of metamorphosis states that any fish in your tank, when given
the right opportunity, will be able to instantly morph into any shape neces-
sary to escape from the aquarium. Our own fish have morphed into the
shape of a French fry in order to squeeze through an air-line hole.
The second part of this law states that after escape, this same fish will 
morph into either a carpet dust ball or a kitty snack. To fix this problem,
make sure that all holes in the top of the tank lid are completely covered,
especially if you have species of fish that are especially prone to jumping 
out of aquariums.
The Fish Law of Motion
The fish law of motion states that any sluggish or ill-looking fish will instantly
be able to dash madly at twice the speed of light when a net is inserted into
the aquarium. The fish will always move directly at right angles to the net’s
strategic placement — a maneuver which will leave you with wet clothes, a
lot of frustration, and a torn-up tank.
To avoid this problem, try adding a little food to coax your fish up to the top
of the tank when you need to catch one. Gently lift out large aquarium deco-
rations, such as rocks, before you attempt to capture your fish. This will pro-
vide you with more space and maneuverability.
The Fish Law of Anti-Matter
The fish law of anti-matter states that fish are the only animals on earth that
are capable of hiding their own body matter after death so that they can
never be found. On a good day, Sherlock Holmes would not be able to find a
dead guppy in a 1-gallon bowl because of this law.
It is important to have good filtration in your tank and carry out frequent
water changes because of this unusual problem. If a dead fish cannot be
located, then a build-up of waste will occur and cause water fouling and 
disease.
310
Part V: The Part of Tens 

The Fish Law of Nutrition
The fish law of nutrition states that your fish will eat all food that is unfit for
aquatic consumption, so make sure that you routinely check your tank for
foreign objects that may have fallen into the water. The second part of this
law states that any uneaten food will fall directly into an area that cannot be
seen by the human eye. Because of this problem, it is important to feed your
fish small meals several times per day, instead of dumping half a can of flake
food into the tank all at once.
The Fish Law of Company
The fish law of company states that all aquarium fish will lethargically lurk in
a corner or disappear behind decorations at the exact moment when your
visitors arrive to see them. The fish will return to their normal activity level
after dark, even if they are not nocturnal.
If you want to successfully show your fish to your company, arrange to have
your friends come over at a time when you would normally give your fish a
special treat. This will allow your friends to get a glimpse of your prize pets.
The Fish Law of Potential Energy
The fish law of potential energy states that a fish’s energy can be stored indef-
initely and will only be released when the aquarium hood is opened and a
direct escape route is in sight. To avoid this problem, make sure that your
aquarium hood fits securely.
The Fish Law of Psychic Felines
The fish law of psychic felines states that any cat within a hundred miles 
of your aquarium will be able to zero in on, sneak through an open window 
or door to get at, and physically engulf any fish that has jumped from your
tank — before you can cross the room to save it. Your fish are fair game, so
make sure to keep a distrustful eye on any other pets that are living in the
same household or neighborhood.
311
Chapter 26: Ten Scientific Fish Laws

The Fish Law of Aggression
The fish law of aggression states that any two fish can show aggression
toward each other without just cause at any given moment of time. For this
reason, it is vital that you keep track of your fish’s social habits to make sure
that a minor scuffle does not end up turning into a major war. Rearranging a
few tank decorations every few months helps break down pre-established ter-
ritories and reduce potential aggression.
The Fish Law of Time
The fish law of time states that a fish will be prone to contract an illness the
day before your vacation starts, or at the beginning of a holiday weekend
when all of the pet shops are closed. That is why it is important to have extra
medication on hand for such emergencies. Training a friend, neighbor, or rela-
tive in the basics of fish disease and treatment comes in handy if you happen
to be on vacation when disaster strikes.

Chapter 27
Ten Aquatic New Year’s
Resolutions
In This Chapter
 Promising to renew your dedication to your fish
 Declaring your commitment to the world
“I,
(state your name), promise to do the following in the new year:
Feed the Fish
I promise to feed my fish properly and throw away the cans of food that have
been in the attic since World War I.
Clean the Tank
I promise to clean my tank regularly and maintain it properly with frequent
water changes and an aquarium vacuum on a regular basis. 
Reduce Celibacy
I promise to buy my male swordtails several females and keep the correct
mix of males and females (with standard exceptions, such as the betta).

Remove Algae
I promise to remove excess algae from the aquarium glass once a week and to
maintain good water conditions and proper lighting.
Change the Filter Pads
I promise to replace clogged filter pads and change or rinse them monthly.
Turn on the Lights
I promise to turn on my aquarium lights daily and to slowly increase the
room lights before switching the tank light on.
Use My Test Kits
I promise to brush the dust off of my test kits and use them once a week. I
will regularly test for nitrates and ammonia and keep an eye on pH.
Pay Attention to My Fish
I promise to spend more quality time with my fish, such as wiggling my fin-
gers near the glass. I will acknowledge my fish’s presence at least twice a day.
Change the Airstones
I promise to change the aquarium’s airstones when they clog so my fish
aren’t living in a stagnant rice paddy. I will check the airstones weekly.
Redecorate the Tank
I promise to rearrange the tank decorations at least twice a year and add new
plants now and then. Then my fish won’t look bored or spit gravel at me.”

Appendix
Tank Figures and Facts
M
addy’s math teacher once told her that she looked exactly like a
zombie from a B horror movie when mathematical equations and for-
mulas were presented to her in test form. Let’s be honest: Numbers can be
more boring than your neighbor talking about his last round of golf. But the
fact remains that numbers are important in the aquarium hobby. Numbers
tell you how big your tank is, how much it weighs, and how many fish you
can safely put into it during one shopping spree.
So in order to preserve your mental health, we have included a few tables to
help you get a better idea of just how much room your aquarium really has.
How Big a Tank Should I Get?
You want to make sure that when you set up your mega-aquarium that it does
not end up in the apartment downstairs. Don’t laugh, because this has actu-
ally happened on numerous occasions! If you live in an upstairs apartment,
you probably don’t want to place a 200-gallon tank directly over the down-
stairs resident’s bedroom. Homes with older floors my have weak spots that
cannot be seen. Always use common sense when choosing an aquarium size
to match the home you live in.
In order to give you a better idea of what an aquarium weighs when it is full
of water, and also empty, we provide Table A-1. All weights in the table are
accurate to within a few pounds, depending on what equipment you use, 
the amount of gravel in the tank, and other factors such as the weight of 
decorations.

Conversions (and Other Useful Data)
If you were bad in high school math like the rest of us and spent most of your
time sleeping near the window in the back of the classroom, then you might

Freshwater Aquariums For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

find the following simple tables quite helpful. (Saves on calculator 
batteries, too.)
Many tropical fish magazines and books use different types of systems to get
their mathematical points across. One publication may choose to use the
metric system, while another will crank out figures that would give Albert
Einstein an embolism. The following information allows you to sort through
the numbers game to come up with information that you can actually under-
stand and use to your best advantage.
1000 cubic centimeters = 1 liter
1 liter of water = 1 kilogram in weight
1 cubic foot of water = 6.23 imperial gallons
1 imperial gallon of water = 10 pounds in weight
1 U.S. gallon = .8 imperial gallons
1 imperial gallon = 4.55 liters
Water hardness
1 English degree of hardness = 14.3 ppm (parts per million) of calcium
carbonate
1 French degree of hardness = 10.0 ppm of calcium carbonate
1 American degree of hardness = 17.1 ppm of calcium carbonate
1 German degree of hardness = 17.9 ppm of calcium oxide
One liter = 0.26 gallons
One gallon = 3.78 liters
1 inch = 2.54 centimeters
One foot = 30 centimeters
One yard = 36 inches
One meter = 39.4 inches
Once ounce = 29 grams
To convert centimeters to inches, multiply by 0.40
To convert inches to centimeters, multiply by 2.54
To convert kilograms to pounds, multiply by 2.2
To convert pounds to kilograms, multiply by 0.453

Appendix: Tank Figures and Facts

Temperature
Celsius = (Fahrenheit – 32) × 5/9
Fahrenheit = (Celsius × 9/5) + 32
Volume = Length × Width × Height
Aquarium weight
1. Determine capacity.
Capacity in gallons = (Length × Width × Height [in inches]) divided by
231.
2. Use capacity to determine weight.
One gallon of fresh water at 4 degrees Celsius = 8.57 pounds of weight.
How Many Fish Can I Put in the Tank?
It is very important to remember that fish need space in order to be healthy.
(Think about it, would you want to live in an elevator with ten other people?)
A crowded tank that has exceeded its stocking limits leads to poor water con-
ditions that can adversely affect your fish’s health. Overcrowded tanks are
low in oxygen levels and pollute quickly — much more so than the filter
medium or biological bacteria can handle efficiently.
Table A-2 gives you an idea of how many fish can safely be put into a tank
with the given dimensions.
The first column is simply the length of the tank multiplied by the width. This
can be measured with a yardstick or measuring tape. The second column
tells you the total surface area of what you measured. The third and fourth
columns give you the total length of all the fish, in inches, that can be safely
put in that size tank, depending on whether they are freshwater or marine
fish. (This is a handy table to have if you decide to enter the marine side of
the hobby later on as well.) Remember that the total length of the fish is mea-
sured from the snout to the beginning of the tail fin, and all the fish lengths
are added together. Also remember that fish grow!
Smaller tanks (under 36 inches in length) are not recommended for saltwater,
except when being used as a hospital tank.

How Much Gravel Can I Put in the Tank?
In order to determine the approximate number of pounds of gravel that will
be needed for a rectangular aquarium, you can use this formula:
Length (in inches) × Width (in inches) × desired gravel depth (in inches) × .05
= pounds of gravel
