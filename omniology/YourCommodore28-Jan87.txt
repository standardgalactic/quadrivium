Are you ready tor the ultimate challenge?
Our original Repton game was immediately ac c laimed as a refreshingly new concept:a game requiring dexterity to complete its arcade-style
elements, and clear logical thinking to solve Its strategic puzzles. Repton involves retrieving treasure from cleverly-constructed traps of falling
rocks whilst avoiding the fearsome monsters and haunting spirits. "This is an astounding game reaching new heights in BBC arcade adventures,"
enthused the Micro User magazine.
Last Christmas saw the release of Repton 2, larger and much more challenging than before_ Acorn User's Technical Editor Bruce Smith wrote:
"Repton 2 is better than anything I've played on the BBC Micro or Electron. Brillianti"
Now, completely rewritten and improved for the Commodore, Arrstrad, BBC Micro and Electron, we proudly present Repton 3. For the ﬁrst time, a
screen-designer is included! try to devise screens that will perplex your friends. then see if you can solve their newly-designed screens. Another
innovation is the character-designer which enables you to design your own monsters. rock& eggs, spirits, diamonds a n y  or all of the game's
characters can be redeﬁned as you wish.
Repton 3 is much larger than its predecessors — it has 24 fascinating screens, and players who are skilful enough to complete them all can
enter our prize competition described below. All the favourite Repton characters have been retained, together with several new features: a
creeping poisonous fungus which grows at an alarming rate; time bombs and time capsules (for puzzles in the 4th dimension); and golden
crowns as well-deserved rewards for your endeavours. Con YOU complete Repton 3?
PRIZE COMPETITION
If you complete Repton 3, you can enter our competition.
Prizes include over E200 in cash, with T-shirts, mugs, badges
and pens for runners-up.
The screen pictures

BBC Micro version of
Repton 3.

Communicating
From early December, Prestel Sub-
scribers will be able to access Telecom
Gold — British Telecom's electronic
mail system. This follows the creation
of a new X  29-based gateway link
between the two services. This is the
ﬁrst stage in establishing full inter-
connection between the two networks.
The new link incorporates software
that enables information sent on a
'scrolling' ASCII type terminal to be
formatted in a Prestel page style.
Additional features include text
editing prior t o  transmission and
simpler access with a single gateway
frame for each Telecom Gold system
which takes the user straight to an ID
entry point. Prestel customers wishing
to access Gold will be routed from the
Prestel messaging database.
As all members o f Micronet are
also in Prestel, this new facility is also
available to them.

The Sporting Armchair
Software companies are always trying
to make sports simulations more life-
like. Now New Concepts has come up
with the idea o f a surﬁng game in
which you attach a mini surfboard to
your keyboard and learn surﬁng tech-
niques with the palm of your hand.
Surfchamp is the game, and it has been
endorsed b y  th e  British Surﬁng
Association as a game which teaches
the sport in the authorised way.
Back to more run of the mill sports,
with another martial arts offering from
Melbourne House, Fist II is the sequel
to The Way of the Exploding Fist. Once
more the Warriors of the Exploding
Fist must combat evil with their
ﬁghting skills. The skills are difﬁcult to
acquire and are come by in two ways:
experience and from the secret scrolls.
Described b y Melbourne House as
arcade, adventure strategy, simulation
and much more, it's Out on the C64 at
£9.95.
For those who like a little more
variety then US Gold/Epyx has just
launched World Games. Featuring
such motley events as slalom ski-ing,
caber tossing, barrel jumping, cliff
diving and much more. Sorry no welly

Based on the book by Bram Stoker,
Dracula was released on hallowe'en.
Although the game is both a graphics

This will continue to be so, and the
Streetwise label will be reserved for
arcade style titles. The ﬁrst two Street-
wise titles are Orbix the Terrorball and

Comms for
Beginners
ommunications has  been t h e
C
most popular trend in computing for
the past Iwo years, and judging by the
sales o f  modems and such lik e, it
would appear that more and more
people are getting involved in this very
exciting aspect of new technology.
Computer communications, o r
'comms' is a very broad subject. I t
covers everything from getting your
micro connected up to a modem to
extracting information from the many
online databases - and that's a lot.
One o f  the ﬁrst questions I  get
asked about comﬁts is 'why bother?'
Well. comms is informative, fast and
fun! You could use computer com-
munications to get online to one of the
many v oluntar ily  p u b lic  bulletin
boards that are in operation in this
country and abroad. Alternatively you
could subscribe to one of the growing
number of electronic magazines that
are becoming available. Business users
might prefer to subscribe to one of the
many electronic mail services that
allow you to send and receive inform-
ation worldwide, instantly at the touch
of a button.
What y ou get out o f  comms all
depends on %'hat you want, and are
using. Casual chit-chat is often to be
found on the bulletin boards, whilst

system h a s  t o  b e  us ed. I  s ay
unfortunately because the telephone
system only allows analogue inform-
ation (noise) to be transmitted over it.
Not only that, but the information
must be sent one bit at a time in a
sequential mariner.
To meet these requirements the
micro needs to send and receive the
information one bit at a time. Looking
at the b a c k  o f  a  Commodor e
64/Cl28/12SD you can see the user
port and the cartridge port. These two
interfaces arc used t o  plug i n  the
modem which will convert the micros
digital signals t o  analogue inform-
ation.
At this point it's worth pointing
out that here in the UK most comms
software packages ar e supplied i n
cartridge form. The cartridge includes
some electronics and a  cable that
connects to a modem. The cartridge is
all that is necessary t o  convert the
signals to and from the modem, and
the advantage of this method is that
the software is  available when the
micro is powered up. The Aluslaug
cartridge from Y2 computing is an
example of this method.
In other countries -  mainly in the
USA -  an RS232 interface board is
widely used which plugs into the user
port. Basically. an RS232 interface is a
piece of electronics which sends and
receives information sequentially -
one bit at a time. Although using the
RS232 interface is considered to be
more cumbersome (it requires an ad-
ditional cable and software t o  be
loaded from tape or disk) it is more
ﬂexible. This is because much of the
software necessary to drive the RS232
unit is  already within y our  Com-
modore's kernal thus enabling sou to
program y o u r  o w n  c omms  appli-
cations. Using the RS232 unit also
enables you to use another printer, or
transfer ﬁle s  betw een a n o t h e r
computer in the same room.
A number of packages rely on an
RS232 adaptor to be ﬁtted. Examples
include Homepak (reviewed i n  the
June issue of Your (ommodore) and
Your Commodore*.s very o w n  lilt . -
phone Exchamfe which appeared in
the April and Max' issues. Many public
domain (free) comms packages rely on
an RS232 interface to be ﬁtted, and if
you ever wish to use one of the more
expensive modems which are ﬁtted
With a D  type connector then it's best
to use it with an RS232 interface.

Which Modern?
After deciding h o w  y ou w ant t o
connect your micro to the modem -
cartridge or interface -  you need the
modem itself.
This will be your critical purchase,
as you can pay as little as £30 or as
much as 1.:60. Before buying a modem
you need to decide in advance whether
you will use it on a regular bases or just
casually. Different moderns communi-
cate at different speeds and generally'
speaking the faster it can operate the
more it will cost. The advantage being
the faster it  can send and receive
information the quicker you can get
the information y ou want, and a t
todays rates f o r  telephone charges
that's an important factor to consider.
The range of speeds that modems
operate at varies between each model,
but the baud rates_ as they are known_
are common. Typical speeds. or baud
rates include:  300/300, I  200/1200
(half-duplex) 1200/75, 75/1200. The
more expensive models can operate at
1200/1200 full- duplex  a n d  ev en
2400/2400 as is the case with the Pace
. S
The buzz-terms half-duplex and
full-duplex mean that data can only be
transferred one way' at ally given time
in the case of half-duplex. and both
was  simultaneously with full duplex,
Modems which offer 1200/1200 half-
duplex normally require some special
software that switches between send-
ing and receiving, and is normally only
used when transferring information
between two people, often referred to
as user-to-user. In the case of 1200/75
baud t h e  computer y ou c all w ill
transmit information to your micro at
1200 baud full-duplex whilst y our
computer will transmit at 75 baud. To
get these baud rates into perspective a
general rule of thumb can be used by
dividing the baud rate by 10 to get the
number of characters of information
per second. So 1200 baud roughly
means t h a t  1 2 0  c harac ters  o f
information will be transferred each
second.
Most modems operate at dual baud
rates i.e, they can operate at a number
of speeds. Typically this  would be
300/300. 1200/75 and 1200/1200 hall-
duplex. M o s t  services operate a t
speciﬁc speeds, and as a general rule
the following applies:
Bulletin boards -  300/300. some also
at 1200/75
COMMUNICATIONS
Viewdata services -  1200/75
Electronic mail -  300/300, 1200/1200
(full), some 1200/75
Looking at the above list you can
see that the type o f  service you use
should be taken into account when you
purchase a modem. If, for example you
wish to access Viewdata services such
as Micronet/Prestel then it is essential
that your modem is capable of operat-
ing at 1200/75 baud. O n the other
hand, if you wish to use the electronic
mail (Email) or online databases then
it is best to purchase a modem that can
operate at 1200/1200 lull-duplex as
this is four times faster than the 300
baud models and it will enable you to
send and receive information more
rapidly thus saving time and telephone
charges.
Some modems are supplied with an
auto-dial option enabling the tele-
phone number to be entered at the
keyboard rather than manually dialled.
And auto-answer option will do just
that -  automatically answer the phone
upon an incoming call. Other more
exotic features are auto baud-rate scan
which enables the modem t o  auto-
matically set itself to the correct baud-
rate when the host system has been
connected to. This saves a lot of knob
twiddling on the user's part. The up
market range of modems even allow
frequently dialled numbers t o  b e
stored internally as well as complete
control via software.
Connecting the modem to the tele-
phone line requires one of the new BT
jack sockets (model 600 telephone
socket) to be ﬁtted near the area in
which the modem is to be used. If the
modem is  ﬁtted w it h  a  telephone
socket then the handset is connected to
the modern and the modem to the wall
socket. If this is not the case then it will
be necessary to install two wall sockets
(one for the modern and the other for
the handset) or use a splitter.
Whatever modem y o u  choose
make sure it is BA BT approved This is
established by  checking for  a green
approval sticker which will have an
approval number on it. Use of equip-
ment that is not approved is currently
an offence.
Choosing the Right Software
Currently there are two comms soft-
ware standards in  use in  the U K;
scrolling a n d  v iewdata. Br oadly
speaking scrolling software displays
only characters in one colour with the
YOUR COMMODORE january 1987
12
text scrolling as more information is
sent/received. Viewdata dis play s
pages of  information in colour with
low resolution graphics.
Each type o f  standard merits its
own features and there are certain
items which you should look out for
when buying a  comms package on
disk, tape or cartridge.
Scrolling software (also known as
dumb terminal) should allow baud
rates to be set by the trsr. It should
operate in half or full-duplex mode
and accept all the common ASCII
control codes including BELL (ASCII
7). Also check that the software will
enable you to specify between ASCII
and PETASCII, Some means of saving
incoming data in ASCII format should
be available, and ideally a  facility
enabling t he user t o  prepare tex t
messages ofﬂine s hould als o b e
provided.
Because t h e  P T S N  w a s  n o t
designed for computers errors in the
transmitted data often occur. TO get
round this the length of the data word
can be set (usually to eight bits). Other
it including start and stop bits as
well as  parity should also be user
selectable. However, even with parity
and stop bits set up the error checking
is very much a half-way house. Errors
will still occasionally creap in and this
can be a problem when transmitting
ﬁles. An error checking protocol called
X M O D E M  ( a l s o  k n o w n  a s
MODEM 7) is very common in comms
packages a n d  i t  allows  tex t a n d
program ﬁles to be transferred error
free. This is accomplished by sending
the ﬁle in small blocks. Should a block
be corrupted dur ing transfer t h e
receiving end will detect the error and
automatically request t h e  pac k et
again.
Other features to look out for are
an online clock which is  useful for
keeping track o f  how long you have
been online. Split screen operation
divides the screen into two parts with
the upper part of the screen used for
displaying incoming data while the
lower two or three lines at the bottom
are used for user input which will be
transmitted. This feature is especially
useful when playing online adventure
such as MUD Ciluhl User Dungeon), or
when using an online CB simulator. Of
particular use is a directory in which
you can store frequently used numbers
on disk as well as the parameters for
the particular service (word length,
parity etc). When used with an auto-

dial modem it enables you to select a
service by pressing a key. This will dial
the modem and set up the software
appropriately.
The viewdata standard is radically
different to the scrolling type of soft-
ware. Although viewdata systems
operate at 1200/75 baud an option to
set the speed to a different baud rate is
particularly handy as Prestel which is
the largest viewdata system in the UK
will soon introduce multiple baud
rates including 300/300, 1200/1200
full-duplex operation. Also of particu-
lar use is a 'reverse Prester rate of
75/1200. In this mode your computer
acts as if it were Prestel and the caller
would call your number as if they were
using Prestel,
Features t o  look  out for  in  all
Prestel packages include page refresh
for when data becomes corrupted, a
previous page facility and some means
of tagging pages. Frame tagging allows
the software to remember particular
pages that can be recalled at the press
of a button. An option to save a frame
to disk is also essential.
A major feature of most viewdata
systems is telesoftware. Basically tele-
software i s  software t h a t  c an b e
downloaded and saved to disk or tape.
For the Commodore range of micros a
special teles oftwa re dow nloader
format h a s  b e e n  dev eloped b y
Mieronet called Mustang. This is the
Standard for all viewdata telesoftware
for the Commodore machines and is
found in many packages. Readers are
advised not to purchase viewdata soft-
ware that doesn't have a dovvnloader
of the Mustang variety.
One other feature worth looking
out for is art ofﬂine mailbox editor.
This enables you to prepare mailbox
messages ofﬂine and then send them
when logged on.
It's worth noting t hat  comms
packages that incorporate both types
of standard are bound to lack some of
the features mentioned above due to
lack of available memory.
A ﬁnal note about software selec-
tion. There are literally hundreds of
pieces o f  comms software f o r  the
Commodore range of micros available
in the public domain. In other words
free. These can usually be obtained
From user groups or  clubs such as
/CPUG or CLUB 64.
What's Out There?
The number and type of services avail-
COMMUNICATIONS
able is almost unlimited. Remember,
computer communications knows no
boundary and it is just as easy to dial
up a bulletin board in Australia as it is
to dial one locally. However, the types
of service available can roughly be split
into three categories; bulletin boards,
databases and Email systems.
Bulletin Boards
These were amongst the ﬁrst services
in this country. Basically a bulletin
board is  what the name suggests; a
public bulletin board, except elec-
tronic. The BB is a special piece of
software which runs automatically on
the micro. They are of the scrolling
type and normally operate at 300 baud
full-duplex. T h e  BBs  ar e r u n  b y
enthusiasts in  their own time, and
allow one person to use the board at
any., given t im e  f o r  about 15-20
minutes. A  boar d w i l l  o f f e r  a n
electronic mail system as well as a
public messaging service. O t h e r
features to be found on BBs include
special interest groups (SIGs) which
are areas on the board dedicated to one
particular subject such as computing,
ﬁshing or whatever. A large number of
BBs offer free software which can be
downloaded i n  either  A S C I I  o r
XMODEM format. The good thing
about BBs is that there is a wide choice
of them to log on to and they are not
run with commercial interest in mind.
Not only that but they are only a phone
call away!
Databases
These are commerical ventures and
usually require you to subscribe before
access is  permitted. Subscription
charges differ from service to service
and are also governed by the type of
information they provide. Hobbiest/
Home DBs such asMicronet and Com-
panel' offer the micro user a wealth of
information and software — some of
which is  free. These DBs also offer
other type of value added services such
as a private mailbox for  each sub-
scriber as well as interactive games
and public messaging facilities. In the
case of Micronet/Prestel the service is
of the viewdata standard while on the
other hand Compunet operates on its
own protocol.
The DBs which are aimed towards
the business sector tend to be of the
scrolling format and are rather expen-

supplied depends on the individual DR
and this  can include references t o
publications, share prices, legal cross
referencing and so on. Many offer very
powerful search and cross reference
facilities. This type o f  service is  o f
particular use to the business user and
those who are engaged in research.
Electronic Mail
Better known as Email systems. These
are set u p  for  the purpose o f  in-
dividuals t o transfer information to
others via the Email service. Again this
type o f  service is  usually o f  the
scrolling type and is best accessed with
a 1200/1200 full-dupex modem. Email
systems such as BT Gold, One-To-One
and Easylink offer very comprehensive
message handling services as well as
telex, radio paging, telemessages and
so o n .  Mos t offer  text orientated
services such as  spelling checkers,
language translation services mailshot
preparation and such like. The distinc-
tion between DBs and Email system is
very blurred as the two tend to offer
features that the other type has. Most
Email systems are geared towards
companies and individuals who have a
lot of text they wish to transfer, how-
ever an increasing number of private
individuals are now beginning to see
the beneﬁts of these services.
But Best of All
The best type of service is the one that
you and y our  friends can provide
yourself. User-to-user communication
is great fun. Both you and a friend
arrange that one dials another at a pre-
determined time (and baud rate). The
idea is  not t o  k ill the ar t o f  con-
versation (never talk  t o  a  terminal
when you can talk to the person them-
selves) but to get used to the idea of
communicating. W U  c an aslso be
used to transfer your own programs
and text between each other and can be
especially useful f o r  mak ing those
emergency backups we all like to do
now and then.
Whatever you do do in the comms
world have fun!

Stall a t the Manchester Show will
understand w h y some people are
murmuring that the system has been
under a bit of strain over the last few
weeks. The free modem offer has
attracted a lot of new subscribers, and
an expanded user base can only be
good news for all of us in the long run.
In the short term, however, the system
has been labouring a bit more heavily
than usual at certain times.
Night-owls hardly notice any
difference, a n d  o n  a  Sunday

appreciably slower sometimes,

occasions. Compunet h a s been

quickly. Let's hope that things are
whifﬂing along again by the time you
read this.

Magazine Reviews
Finally, a  bare-faced plug fo r  a
directory I jointly edit with RJM82:
GOTO MAGS will take you to a series
of short reviews and notes about items
in computer magazines that bear on
Commodore machines. RJM82 does
the useful work: he covers the main
magazines from the LIS, and provides a
very welcome service as it is often hard
to ﬁnd these in the shops. We also try
to review t h e  serious Bri ti sh
magazines, and focus more applica-
tions and programming than o n
games. If you see a magazine, or even
an item in a magazine that you think
could be of interest to other Chetters,
drop me a mailbox with a description
and I will upload it.
Remember that Chetting is like
sea netting, you never know what
you'll haul in until you try. If you ﬁnd
something likely to be of interest, to

ADVENTURES
Sense of Adventure
T
house which is only now making any
appreciable headway in this country.
The software is not cheap but usually
offers something different from regu-
lar adventure games found o n the
shelves. Only disk based versions are
available and the three that I  have
come across are Amazon, Nine Princes
in Amber and Perry Mason -The Case
of the Mandarin Murder.
Amazon is based on a plot written
by science ﬁction author, Michael
Crichton, who is better known for his
novels The Andromeda Strain and The
Terminal Man. The game starts with
the destruction o f  an archaeological
team in the Amazon jungle. This same
team was to have investigated the lost
city of Chak, where it was thought they
might ﬁnd a rare form of emerald.
This type of emerald is particularly
important in various hi-tech applica-
tions concerning national defence.
This explains t h e  involvement o f
National Satellite Resource Tec h-
nology (NSRT), a top-secret, research
and consulting ﬁrm. Yo u  play  an
operative for this organisation. who
was t o  be sent out to the doomed
expedition.
Immediately after the communica-
tion conﬁrming that something is
terribly wrong, you are sent on a one
man mission to sort things out.
The game comes on two disks -
both double sided -so expect a lengthy
operation. Unlike many conventional
adventure games, Amazon does not
require extensive mapping to ensure
you k now where you are. I t  is very
much like a paperback novel, you start
at the beginning and work your way
through page by page to the end.
The game revolves around puzzles
that have to be answered before any
further progress can be made. There
Adventures are still pouring out of the
software houses and boggling the minds of
fans. Your Commodore brings some much
needed aid.
by Pete Freebrey
are a few 'side roads', but you are
invariably forced back to the 'main
road' to continue to the next puzzle.
There are several pages of instructions
and background information, includ-
ing a map, a list of words understood
by the parser and a coded help sheet.
Playing t h e  g a m e  occasions
extensive use o f  the disk drive, with
many inputs causing it to whirr away
for seconds at a time. Although the
disk access is not particularly slow,
this enforced waiting can become a bit
of a bore at times. At the beginning of'
the game you are reminded to create a
'save disk', on which you can save up
to 10 game positions -  do this at the
earliest Opportunity!
The introductory sequence takes
six minutes and is interesting the ﬁrst
time round but you will not want to
wait through this each time you 'die' or
make a silly mistake! Things start in
the NSRT control room where a video
link reveals the expedition's demise.
You are called up to your controller's
ofﬁce to be briefed.
Among other things. he will ask
YOUR COMMODORE january 1987
22
you to spell out your name, Take care,
later in the game you may be asked
your name -  mispell i t ,  even b y
substituting lower  case letters f o r
for upper case, and you will be accused
as an imposter and will have to start
again!
As soon as you leave his ofﬁce,
make your ﬁrst game save. From then
On it's up to you, but this save will
eliminate those initial six plus minutes.
You w i l l  b e  giv en s ome ex tr a
equipment before you board a plane at
the start of your assignment, check the
contents carefully.
Your ﬁrst task is to pick up some
helpful information from a Professor
Reneker in Miami, unfortunately he is
killed before y ou can talk  to him.
Nevertheless, you do get some help in
the for m o f  Paco, the Professor's
parrot. This talkative creature is  a
fund of knowledge and can often give
you a clue when you are in a tight spot!
In due course you are parachuted
into the American jungle and have to
report b a c k  t o  N S R T  v ia  y o u r
computer/transmitter, T h is  it em
enables headquarters to keep track of
your location and on several occasions
they will guide you out of trouble by
giving you map references to aim for,
Switching o n  y o u r  c omputer
changes the normal graphics picture of
where you are, to what is presumably
the computer's display. Y o u  must
enter your security code before NSRT
will complete the connection, y ou
made a note of this didn't you! Having
completed transmission, the computer
display clears tak ing 30 seconds to do
so, ouch!
At one point you have to locate a
roving band o f  monkeys who have
stolen y o u r  backpack. U s e o f  a
joystick i s  recommended b u t  this
seems a little out o f  context and is

more of a nuisance than a challenge.
Altogether this game is an interest-
ing attempt at trying to create some-
thing a little out of the ordinary. The
basic story line is good, with reason-
able graphics - which may be switched
off to speed the game up -  and the
game could well be recommended to
beginners but might prove too slow
and pr edic table f o r  t h e  m o r e
experienced adventurer.
Red What?
Melbourne House's latest adventure,
Redhawk, is a game with a difference.
The graphics are in the form of a scrol-
ling comic strip, which makes sense, as
the game is about Redhawk, a comic
type super-hero.
At the start o f  the game, Kevin
Oliver, the normal human side o f
Redhawk, ﬁnds himself in hospital
suffering from amnesia, Whether or
not he had some previous existence we
are not to know but now he is search-
ing for a job as a crime photographer.
Having got him settled in his new job
you may aim him into whatever adven-
tures come along.
Hav ing l o s t  a n y  p r e v io u s
memories, y o u  by e the choice o f
making him act as either super-hero or
super-villain. Redhawk's popularity
rating, s hown graphically beneath
the comic strip, will affect the inter-
action of the other characters. To ﬁnd
out what the heck is going on, it seems
best to choose here rather than villain.
SAY (or SHO UT ) "KWAH" (with
quotes), and our Key will change into
the fearless Redhawk. He is able to ﬂy
and has most of the powers claimed for
super-heroes. The main snag is that as
Redhawk, his energy output is high
and his reservoirs of power fairly low!
So a return to being plain Kevin is very
necessary after only a few minutes.
Location descriptions are almost
non-existent as they are all included
within the 'comic strip' shown at the
top of the screen. This strip has three
frames that scroll across the screen
from right to left at each command.
You would think that this would show
the present and two previous scenes
but this is not so.
Each command, if understood, is
repeated by the Kevin in the strip and
only then actioned -  two frames for
one command. This would not be so
bad if the frames were drawn quickily
but they are not. this is quite painful if
all you want to do is go from location
A to location B, it is even worse having
ADVENTURES
to wait for the frame to be drawn to be
told: "Kevin looks for a way north but
can't ﬁnd one!"
The game is played in real time
with a digital clock ticking away the
seconds as you wonder what to do
next. Fortunately the clock is stopped
if Kevin does not understand what you
are trying to get him to do. Unfortu-
nately this seems to happen all too
often, h i s  knowledge o f  nor mal
'adventure talk' is sadly lacking.
His inability t o  understand the
command OPEN DOOR brought up
the response: "open" confuses Kevin.
He does seem to be a very confused
young man. Another change fr om
normal prac tic e i s  t h e  u s e  o f
EXAMINE. Here it literally means a
body search, perhaps it was not sur-
prising that a young lady I met early in
the game, objected quite strongly
when I told Kevin to examine her!
For all its differences to normal
'adventure speak', Kevin will under-
stand fairly complex sentences with
multiple commands separated b y
commas also accepted. A  number of
common commands are shown at the
bottom of the screen and are accessed
by CTRL and one of the number keys.
The game has a STORE facility (a
version of RAMSAVF,) with a normal
tape save/load to cassette for saving
your position between games.
Overall 'Redhawk ' w as  r ather
disappointing and boringly slow when
you consider the lack of text and rather
repetitive graphics. The game puzzles
are good with the feeling that some-
thing startling is just around the corner
but the lack o f  any real atmosphere
destroys what could have been a really
novel adventure.

The French connection
Infrogames is  a  new name in  this
country, and it looks as though it may
be heard of a great deal more in the
future. The ﬁrst offering is an adven-
ture, Mandragore. This is best com-
pared with Exodus Uhima III, with a
band of intrepid adventurers exploring
a strange land and the castles and vil-
lages they ﬁnd in their travels.
This French variant comes with a
fairly long background story to set the
scene for the adventure. The good and
just King Jorian has been killed in
suspicious circumstances and his lands
taken over by the evil Yarod-Nor. It is
the task of would-be adventurers to
search out and ﬁnd the means by
which to overthrow this reign of evil.
Mandragore is on two cassettes or
one disk and is pretty large, with only
37 blocks unused o n  the disk. A
further formatted disk or blank tape is
required i f  you wish t o  save y our
party's progress for use on your next
visit.
On loading the game you are given
the choice of starting from scratch and
forming a party of your own choice,
continuing with a previous adventure
Or using a ready formed party under
the leadership o f  a female Paladin,
Syrella.
If you are new to the game it is
probably wise to use the ready formed
party. This will enable you to get some
idea of what the game is about, how it
works and also which characters are
best at what! Initially  death comes
quickly and your ﬁrst explorations will
be over quite rapidly, but hopefully
you will have learnt something useful
before all four characters have keeled
over.
If you choose to start with your
own party, you must ﬁrst create the
four characters who will make up the
group. For each member you have to
apportion 80 points (minimum ﬁve,
maximum 20) to six attributes - Con-
stitution,S t r e n g t h ,  Knowledge,
Wisdom, Dexterity and Appearance.
For Knowledge read Intelligence, for
Appearance, Charm or Charisma.
You must give the characters a
name (up to six letters) and deﬁne their
sex. Five different races are possible -
Human, Dwarf, Hobbit, Elf or Mi-Ore
(Mighty Ore?) but there is no informa-
tion as to the effect o f  this choice.
There are six different character types
-  Warrior, Ranger, Wizard, Cleric,
Thief and Minstrel. This choice is not
entirely open as each of the last ﬁve

must have over 14 points given to them
in their primary attribute -  Ranger,
Strength; Wizard, Knowledge; Cleric,
Wisdom etc. Any  charcter may be a
Warrior (press key 'S', soldier?)
Your ﬁnal choice is the character's
colour, this helps differentiate charac-
ters of  the same type when they are
shown graphically during the adven-
ture. Once a team has been created -
save it to disk or tape. Creating a team
is not a long process but it is certainly
not something you will want to repeat
if someone dies in the ﬁrst few minutes
of play!
You start in the wilds, north west
of a village and west o f  one of the
Chateaux ( i t s  a  F r enc h g a me ,
remember!). Your team is depicted by
a single ﬁgure that may be moved
around the scrolling countryside with
direction keys N, E, S. W. There are
various terrains t o  b e explored -
plains, forests, hills and swamps, all of
which are passable. There are also
areas of water where you will need a
boat to get across and ﬁnaly moun-
tains that arc impassable.
There are a  number o f  villages
where you can buy or steal items that
you may need, all villages appear to be
the same when you get inside but that
does n o t  mak e them any  the less
welcome. There are 10 chateaux, one
of which contains the evil Yarod-Nor
but the other nine must be visited and
their puzzles solved t o  help y ou
complete your quest.
On entering either villages o r
chateaux, the display changes from a
general plan view t o  a  limited 3 D
picture. This shows you that location,
the members of  your party and any
objects or  creatures present. T o the
right of this picture is a brief status of
your characters, their experience and
life points. Als o shown is  a list o f
visible objects or creatures. A  maxi-
mum of four things can be seen at any
location with each being coded A-D.
The func tion keys F I - F 4  w ill
display a full status report on each of
your four  characters, including any
artefacts, food or money held by them.
Each character may only carry four
objects and the full status report will
give each of these a number (1-4). You
must remember which number refers
to what, as Mundragore has a novel
input routine that requires the player
to type in commands in a highly abbre-
viated form.
Each character has a number (1.4)
and the 29 verbs that are understood
ADVENTURES
are recognised by either one or two
letter abbreviations. This is a little con-
fusing a t  ﬁrst b u t  once mastered,
enables commands to be issued very
quickly. I  BE/ C  will diapisy on the
screen a s  S Y R E L L A  B U Y S
MEDICINE, t h e  medic ine being
object 'C' shown at that location.
Several verbs support two objects,
so, 3 AT  A 2 converts to TORLINN
ATTACKS HARPY WITH SWORD
-  this is why you must remember hit in
Torlinn's inventory, item ' 2 '  is  a
sword!
As your party moves around the
'map' o f  Mandragore, they will be
attacked by  a variety o f  wandering
monsters. Wit h  the low  experience
points the characters start with, this
can be fatal. Experience is gained for
most successfully completed actions -
disarming booby traps, opening gates,
ﬁnding treasure and of course defeat-
ing the many monsters.
Damage t o  any  member o f  the
team either from an attacking monster
or a booby trap, will cause a loss of life
points'; zero points and that person is
dead. Fortunately, in each village is a
supply of very beneﬁcial medicine -
not expensive and should be taken by
everyone a t  regular intervals! O ne
slightly annoying point is that once a
member has bought an item from a
village shop i t  cannot be bought
again without leaving the village and
re-entering. Buying stocks of medicine
can take several minutes as you all trot
in and out.
Life points may also be replenished
by eating or drinking. Food may be
bought in the villages but the com-
mand i s  s tr ange -  S Y R E L L A
BARTERS 9, will get her 9 units of
food for a cost of 18 units of money. In
a number o f  locations within the
chateaux you can ﬁnd something to
HUNT -  rabbits for instance. These
too can be eaten t o  replenish los t
points!
If you have a  well experienced
Thief in the party you can raise your
party's funds to almost any level pro-
viding you have the patience to keep
popping in and out °fa village stealing
something and then handing it over to
another member of the party to sell.
This latter action is necessary, as, if
caught, all objects, money, food and
some life points are taken from the
thief as a punishment.

somewhere and retrieve them later -
they are gone for good. Also the word
'drop' is not understood (DR is used
for DRINK), you must use the unusual
word L AY instead!
The characters may talk (ASK) to
many of the beings they meet in the
chateaux. The responses are brief and
usually give some form of cryptic clue
about the puzzles to come. Other com-
mands inc lude O P E N ,  B R E A K ,
SHOOT, READ. Not all commands
are successful at ﬁrst, so if in doubt -
try again, perhaps using a different
person. '*' will usually repeat the last
command and can be a boon when
ﬁghting.
Once inside a village or chateau, it
is possible to split your team up and
control them independently. T hey
could then theoretically each explore a
different chateau or simply different
rooms in the same chateau. There did
not seem to be any valid reason for
them t o  s plit u p  -  b u t  i t  is  a n
interesting option, how about a multi-
player game?
There are a  number o f  special
spells available to Wizards -  LOOK,
TELEPORT, S P E L L  PARALYSE,
HYPNOTISE and PETRIFY. I  did
not ﬁnd these particularly vital and as
they all use up some of the user's life
points, I used them very infrequently.
There may be special need for one or
more of these commands, but if  so I
have not yet found it!
The pictures are fair ly  chunky
block graphics that draw very quickly
and although simplistic in outline, set
the scene well for what is after all a
ﬁghting adventure with added puzzles.
The puzzles are far from clear so do
not expect to solve this game at one,
two o r  three sittings. Many  o f  the
chateaux have creatures that MUST be
fought before you can get to all the
rooms. T h e  div er s ity  o f  thes e
creatures is quite amazing, I do not
think that I have ever come across a
game with Sc) many different monsters!
Do N O T  ty pe i n  H EL P,  this
merely takes you back to the initial
menu -  if you have saved your game
position, then you can return to that
point otherwise you will have to start
again!
An interesting game with a  lot
more to it than ﬁrst meets the eye, not
in the same league as Ultima I I I  or
Ultimo I V  but nevertheless a  good
challenge, w it h  some o f  the good
points associated with role playing
adventures in the 'D and D' tradition.

In a world where clone programs permeate the softwarQ

come up with a fresh idea.
The Sentinel is an evil despot who has conquered 10,000
worlds but there comes a time when the worm turns. In thi
case the 'worm' takes the form of a synthoid robot with a
novel mode of travelling.
The robot projects an empty shell to the next place it
wishes to occupy and then teleports itself into its new

Should the Sentinel spot the synthoid as it travels about
the land, the srnthoid will detect the scan which precedes a
fatal draining o f  its energy. At  this point evasive action
should be taken as quickly as possible by throwing out
another shell. The old shell will have to be absorbed as soon
as possible because the Sentinel will continue to draw its
energy away and the shell will gradually change as it loses
power. First it becomes a boulder and then it becomes a tree
before ﬁnally disappearing altogether.
This shows the different energy levels. The basic currency
is the tree. Two trees make a boulder, a boulder plus a tree
makes a shell. As the robot moves around it will ﬁnd more
trees on the landscape to replenish any energy stolen by the
Sentinel.
The principal rule is that energy can only be drained from
an object if its base can be seen by the robot. Anything on a
higher level cannot be assimilated. For the Sentinel on its
high plane this is rarely a problem but the synthoid has to use
its boulders to reach the trees on higher levels.
If the Sentinel can see its enemy but cannot see its base,
the synthoid's scan registers a half dosage. Although the
synthoid is safe for the moment, the Sentinel will meta-
morphise a nearby tree into a 'meanie'. This will scan around
at a faster rate than its creator and, if it sees the synthoid, it
hyperspace its foe to another part of the planet.
Hyperspacing, whether forced or deliberate, takes the
same amount of energy as producing a shell (three trees). If
the energy reserve is  insufﬁcient, the svnthoid w ill be
destroyed.

The eventual aim of the synthoid is to create a boulder
platform which will raise it above the Sentinel so that its
vulnerable base is revealed and the hunter becomes the
hunted. Once the Sentinel has been drained of energy, a
hyperspace jump will reveal the secret code which will allow
access to one of the other 10,000 planets.
As the levels increase the game becomes more and more
complex. The Sentinel is joined by an increasing number of
Sentries who behave exactly as their controller but from less
exalted heights. Before the Sentinel can be attacked in a ﬁnal
assault, all the Sentries must be wiped out. This really puts
the pigeon amongst the cats!
Combining so many skills. the game has everything
going for it, The graphics are cleverly conceived. at times the
gameplay is as fast as any arcade shoot-'em-up and yet the
strategy element requires as much concentration as Chess.
Sentinel deserves to be as big a hit as Firebird's classic elite
and in a similar way compresses a complex and sophisticated
graphic style in a single load game.
Sentinel is  a truly unique game and it  deserves the
accolade of being an essential addition to all C64 owners'
collections.

look out for new programs, hints and
tips, articles and even regular series. In
fact if  you have something that you
think could be of use to other Commo-
dore owners we want to hear about it.
So if you have got something which
you think  we may be interested in.
How do you go about submitting it to
us?
Below you will ﬁnd a list of guide-
lines that will help us to deal with any
item that you send in to us. We don't
expect everybody t o  b e  t h e  nex t
William Shakespeare but i f  you do
follow these simple rules then it will
make our job a lot easier.
1) I f  possible all material sent to the
magazine should be typed or printed
out on a computer printer.
2) All text should be double spaced i.e.
there should be a blank line between
each line of text. You should also leave
a mar gin o f  about 1 0  characters
around the text.

put the following:
Name of the article
Machine that it is for
Any extras required — disk, printer
etc.

the following information on it:
Abbreviation of the article title
Your name
The page number
READERS SUBMISSIO NS

written some programs? So why haven't you
sent them to us?
For ex ample, suppose y o u  h a d
submitted an article on CM interrupts.
You should put something lik e the
following at the head of the page:
I nterrupts/J.Smith/1
5) Please make sure that you do not
make any additional marks on your
text especially underlining.
6) Try and write i n  clear concise
English. it does not have to be a work
of literature but it must be comprehen-
sible.
7) On the bottom of each page you
should put the word MORE if there
are more pages to the article or ENDS
if it is the last page.
8) I f  possible, enclose a listing of all
programs.
9) Under n o  circumstances use a

paperclip instead.
10) Programs should be included on
either disk or tape. Make sure that you
SAVE two copies of every program so
that we have a better chance of loading
them if problems occur.
11) Programs under 10 lines can be
included in the text. If your program is
longer than this you must enclose a
disk or cassette.
12) I f  your article needs any artwork

13) Photographs, i f  necessary, must
be either black and white prints or
colour slides, We can take shots our-
selves so don't worry about this too
much.
14) Submissions o f  any length are
welcome. If you have a ﬁve line routine
that y ou think  may  be o f  use t o
someone else we welcome it  just as
much as a full blown six part series.
15) Payment varies quite a lot and de-
pends on quite a number of factors,
such a s  complexity o f  program,

ment is generally between £10.00 and
800.00.

your article has appeared in print.

T
different in that it deals with a single
software house - US Gold's Kids! No I
don't have shares in US Gold, but in its
way, this source of software has made
quite a contribution to the software
market for younger children.
One impor tant feature t o  b e
appreciated i s  t h a t  educ ational
software should be attractive so that it
holds appeal t o the user as well as
delivering the information effectively.
This i s  partic ularly  germane t o
software for children in pre-school and
primary age groups, Kids! software is
mostly of  American origin and uses
Disney and other well k nown T V
characters to help deliver its message.
One drawback is  that most o f  the
packages require a disk drive in order
to function, Whils t disk drives are
common in the states, this is not the
case over here. Their American origin
does have the advantage that they have
that extra b i t  o f  pazzaz that the
American market demands. This also
means that the graphics are to a high
standard.
The ﬁrst package is Donald Duck's
Playground. This package doesn't set
out to teach a particular skill but incor-
porates a number of features. The idea
is to earn money which can be used to
purchase items for the construction of
an adventure playground for Donald
Duck's nephews. The action centres
around a street with various shops and
other establishments on either sides.
You control Donald and can guide
him into the building of your choice.
There a r e  f o u r  money-earning
activities to choose from, each testing
different skills. At  the airport, your
child's a b ilit y  t o  ma t c h  s imple
sequences of letters is tested. The idea
is to pick up packages and put them in
the correct trolley ready for loading on
the aircraft, You are paid for  each
package correctly sorted and things
are made slightly tougher by an in-
built time built.

At the produce market, you must
catch fruit being thrown from a lorry
and put it in the correct box. Each time
fruit is dropped, Donald gives off a
string o f  quacked expletives in true
style. In the toy store, you must collect
toys and put them on the correct shelf.
There is  the added annoyance o f
frequent trains which shake toys off
the shelves. Finally, you can work as
controller on the Amquack railway.
This involves the manipulation o f
points t o  direct the trains t o  the
required destinations. T his  task is
particularly tough.
Once you've amassed some money,
you can go into the shops and buy
ropes, ladders, wood and other junk
and construct the playground. As the
playground is  built, y ou have the
option of seeing the young ducks play
on it.
The games cover such skills as
letter recognition, matching shapes,
speed o f  response, eye-hand c o -
ordination, forward planning and the
handling o f  money  dur ing trans-
actions. A l l  games have three skill
levels thereby catering for a wide age
range.

Overall this is an attractive game
which gives the impression o f  play
rather than strict learning. Ideal for
children from about six to 1 1
Another play orientated package is
The Great Gonzo in Wordrider. This is
a sort of takeoff of Raiders of the Lost
Ark in which the heroic Gonzo( late of
the Muppets) endeavours t o  rescue
Camilla the chicken from the evil grasp
of t h e  Swedish c hef. G o n z o i s
equipped w it h  a  variety o f  exotic
machines b y  Pr ofes s or  Buns en
Honeydew at the Muppet Institute of
Technology. Wit h these devices, he
must negotiate a range of hazards. The
child must select the machine most
appropriate f o r  t h e  hazard. F o r
example, a diving machine is no use in
New York City and a walking machine
is n o  good f o r  walk ing ov er the
Egglantic Ocean (note the appalling
puns used in the game!). You have a
choice o f  ﬂying, walking, climbing,
diving, gliding and rolling machines
and a range of attachments such as a
catcher, l i g h t  mak er  a n d  w a t e r
squirter.
To complete the game, the child
must score a  speciﬁed number o f

points b y  negotiating the various
hazards. The hazards are linked so that
the game is rather like a long journey
or quest. The problems are two-fold.
First the child must select the
correct machine and attachment for
the particular hazard, second, the child
demonstrate the dexterity and timing
needed t o  negotiate w h a t a r e
effectively a sequence of simple arcade
games.
Once Camilla has been rescued,
you start again but with a higher points
tally to achieve, Failure means a long
trek by foot across the desert.
Overall the game is ideal for the
younger child (six to 11 years) with its
abundance of bad puns and jokes, it's
simple arcade games and the use of
weird machines.
Once children start to read and
recognise words, the next problem is to
teach how words link together to give
meaningful sentences. The problem is
how to make this exercise fun. One
effective approach to this problem is to
get the child to write a sentence and
then to read it back. Kermit's Elect-
ronic Story Maker providdes a cartoon
based method o f  writing simple
stories. A  particularly nice touch is
that the program uses a joystick to
make all selections via cycling menus.
The story is built up from a series of
simple sentences of about half a dozen
words. The display shows the sentence
at the top of the screen as a series of
blanks separated b y  punctuation
marks. You simply point at each blank
and choose from the words available.
Each word is accompanied b y an
animated sequence showing what each
word represents. An example sentence
would be: "While the banana dances in

structures allowing a fair degree o f
variety. Stories can be saved on disk
for completion or replaying at a later
date.
The sequences are nicely done with
background music appropriate to the
scene (all being based on the Muppet
theme tune). The sound effects of the
creatures/objects used a re  also
sounded. Overall an excellent package
which gives hours of fun.
The other two packages available
are text/graphic adventures. First we
have Alickey's Space Adventure. In this
game, you assist Mickey Mouse and
Pluto in their search of the solar system
for a number of crystal pieces. The
game is quite huge in that it occupies
both sides of two disks.
In his travels, Mickey ﬁnds an alien
space ship. This must be used to ﬂy to
the planets of the solar system to ﬁnd
the parts of the aforesaid crystal which
holds the history of' the alien planet.
The game uses combined multicolour
mode high resolution graphics with
text. The pictures are true to  the
original Disney characters and are
very colourful. The input of instruc-
tions has been simpliﬁed in that the
options available are listed at the foot
of the screen and you simply choose
them using single key presses. The
scenario is quite large with plenty of
places to explore. Clues are also pro-
vided, particularly by the accompany-
ing instructions.
On balance, the game is more
suited to the older child (say nine to 12)
since there is quite a lot of detailed
information on the planets and other
scientiﬁc topics. The accompanying
literature is particularly strong with a
glossary and ideas for further work. A
disk drive is mandatory in order to
play this game and the frequent disk
changes are rather tedious. On the
whole, however, this is a strong piece
of software which will take quite some
hours to solve. Additionally, each new
game is different.

Winnie the Pooh in the Hundred
Acre Wood is very similar in style to
Mickey's Space Adventure albeit aimed
at a slightly younger audience. The aim
of the game is to locate objects and
return them to their rightful owner.
Naturally, each new game is different.
To help players to play the game, a
simple map is provided showing the
main parts o f the wood. This map
bears illustrations which are similar to
those shown on the screen allowing
you to ﬁnd out where you are, The
game follows quite closely a number of
events described in the original books
and the illustrations are in themselves
faithful to the original. As before, a
simple method of selection of option is
provided. There are also a number of
abstract, fun options provided to allow
the child to mess around. You can, for
example, play Pooh sticks o r look
under rocks or count trees etc. There
are also a number o f confounding
factors which can either move you to a
random location or shufﬂe the objects
around the wood. In all, just enough to
keep a  child quiet, o r  cursing
(depending on your child) for hours on
end. Again, unfortunately, a disk drive
is needed.
So what do we have? The packages
can b e  summarised under several
features:
1) Al l  use colourful, well designed
graphics featuring well known cartoon
characters. Th e y therefore have
instant appeal, particularly to  the
under tens. Sound is also well used to
give music and effects.
2) All packages come with detailed and
colourful instructions. These instruc-
tions also provide ideas for further
activities and, where needed, glossaries
and detailed information.
3) Ex c e p t  f o r  D o n a l d  D uc k 's
Playground, a disk drive is required.
4) All packages teach and test skills
without making it obvious. They also
achieve their goals as educational
packages. In  all, the Kids series is
ﬁlling a  large gap in the software
market for the primary age group and
sets standards which many domestic
software houses would do well to
emulate.

KETTLE
Weird, wondetful„ zany or just plain fun. There are hosts
of games just waiting for you out there, so we've brought
you some to ease the burden of your decision.
ettle is Tony Crowther's second game since resuming
K
his partnership with Alligata. The First, Trap, was featured
as Game of the Month. Kettle is unfortunately somewhat
disappointing.
You play the part of a kettle (surprise, surprise) and are
trapped in an underground complex of 30 different levels.
Your objectives are survival and escape. The key to moving
from one level to the next is to ﬁnd a tin opener. This is
hidden deep within one of the many bowls scattered round
the complex. At least I think that they are bowls. That is
what they look like although the blurb insists on calling
them bowels but 1 have a gut feeling that that is wrong
somehow. Shooting the bowls 10 times results in it changing
into a diamond and a further successful hit changes the
diamond into an alien, a bonus, an energy giving jug of water
or the much neded tin opener.
Shooting objects - bowls, bubbles and diamonds is done
by use of a crizza. This orbits around your kettle and behaves
something like a cross between a South American bolus and
a yo-yo. You can choose from the initial option screen how
you want the crizza to behave.
The most interesting part of the game is the fact that two
players can play simultaneously. The screen is split so that
you can watch exactly what your opponent is up to. Two
distinct strategies present themselves. You can work as a
partnership or you can play against eachother, waiting for
REVIEWS
the other player to do all the hard work before nipping in and
stealing whatever the diamond happens to reveal.
The split screen works nicely but the main problem is
that the game is just plain dull. Not one of -
efforts.

YOUR COMMODORE january 1987

A
a pleasure to see something a bit out of the ordinary. Such a
game is Uchi Mata, a judo simulation. The name incidentally
refers to one of the moves - an inner thigh throw.
Judo allows no kicks or punches, it involves gripping
your opponent's judogi, catching him off balance and trying
to throw him onto his back. How well you do this results in
points being awarded to you. A perfect throw is called an
ippon and immediately ends the bout. Lesser manoevres
may be awarded a waza-ari, yuko or koka.
Your chances of completing a successful throw depend
largely on the quality of grip you have on your opponent.
When you are within striking range, a quick press of the lire
button makes your man make a grab and a bar chart in the
top left hand corner displays the relative grips of the red and

white players together with their respective staminas. A
successful throw can only be made i f you are actually
attacking so another press o f the button lights up an
indicator to denote who is the Tori (aggressor) at any given
moment. The throw itself depends on a speciﬁc sequence of
joystick movements. Some o f these are outlined in the
instructions, others you must discover for yourself. The
different throws include a tomoe-nage (sacriﬁcial stomach
throw) and de ashi barai (advancing ankle sweep). There is a
practise mode for you to try out these moves before you go
into actual competition.
The thing that struck me most about Uchi Mata was the
amount of realism that Martech have tried to include in the
game. It is not as action packed as say Way of the Exploding
Fist but more subtle and tactical. You really feel as if you are
coming to grips with your adversary. G . R

180
s might be surmised from this game's title. 180 is a darts
A
simulation. And it's not a bad one either. The object of the
game is to win the championship. There are eight conten-
ders. rejoicing in names such as Belly Bill, Sure Shot Sidney
and Limp Wrist Larry. You can meet any of the players as
you progress from the quarter ﬁnals but the ﬁnal is always
against Jammy Jim.
The match itself is the familiar 501, straight in. double
out, a match being the best of three sets. When it is your turn
to throw, a hand appears in front of the screen, It moves
about slightly as you aim, so that you can't move directly to
the treble twenty all the time. To further complicate matters,
only the diagonal movements of the joystick are effective.
The result of all this is that scoring the magic 180 is not quite
as easy as it appears when the experts do it on the box. Every
time you throw a dart, your current score is chalked up on
the blackboard. Then you must sit back and watch your
opponent throw. Each o f the competitors has his own
preferences and quirks but it is up to you to work out what
they are.

enough options to provide a challenge for even the most
demanding players. The bats are suspended in mid air and
wave vaguely in the direction of the ball every time the ﬁre
button is pressed. Sounds too easy? That's what I thought
until 1 lost the ﬁrst two games 21-1 and 21-2 on the slowest
possible settings!
Timing is crucial if you are to succeed in returning the
ball over the net. Assuming that you actually make contact
in the ﬁrst place, the ball can leave the bat at any one of
Fifteen different angles. Initially, it seems that there is only
one angle — one that sends the ball miles off the side of the
table. The knack is to get the bat in position early rather than
late. Once you get used to returning the ball, then you can
start to worry about where on the table you want to put it.
Your normal shot is top spin but you can smash or slice the
ball if you want to.
Before you even start to play, there are three pages of
options for you to select from. You can play either against
the computer or a human opponent. If you choose the latter
option, you can elect to view the table from side on instead of
the more normal end on position. There are three speeds
which equate to different skill levels and you can also opt to
let the computer move the bat for you — very useful when you
ﬁrst start.
The game is full of nice additional touches. You canf T h
practise before the match in a game of round the clock. The
numbers I — 20 must be hit in turn within a certain time limit, a n d  c
There are some animated back drops as your opponent indivi
throws and should you have difﬁculty working out exactly l
which numbers you have to hit in order to ﬁnish, there is a list ,O
i
of the more popular combinations on the cassette insert.
Most of the attempts at darts games released so far have
been fairly poor and 180 is certainly the pick of the bunch for
whiling those long hours when the pub is closed. G.R•1

The standard of your game is measured over six different
abilities ranging from forehand and backhand skills to speed
and endurance and these can be adapted t o  suit your
individual preferences. Finally  come choices about the
length of the match and bat colours.
Once you get used to controlling the bat. Superstar Ping
Pong is a very realistic simulation. The number of options
mean that you can always set up a situation whereby the
computer is just that little bit stronger than you are. There
are also some nice little touches. It is very reassuring to know
that the computer is capable of mistakes as well as you and is
just as likely to serve the ball straight into the net, Well worth
considering if  you enjoy reaction games and want to get
away from shoot-em-ups for a bit.

aliens under control. What do you mean you don't know
what I'm talking about? Look, you know we almost had a
nuclear war a couple of weeks ago? You know it was only
averted by the fact that the aliens turned up, determined to
wipe us out because they thing we're too belligerent to
inherit the Universe? Well, now they're training young guys
like me to sort out the little blighters.
There's wave after wave of them, all different shapes and
sizes and they are totally suicidal, man. vou just have to keep
on ﬁring at them. Its not too had at ﬁrst but when they get to
know yu're a ﬁrce ti be reckoned with, they send in the big
guns. Weird shaped craft which spin around and fairly make
you dizzy.
Seeing the world from my ship is a pretty unbelievable
experience. too. Surreal silver landsapes, dark craggy
scenery and mile upon mile of virgin forest. And, wow, some
of the cities are realy high tech. They've got defences which
are hell to penetrate. And have you ever ﬂown through a
rainbow? That's an experience not to be missed.

Federal force and are trying to rescue the few survivors and

reminiscent of Zaxxon and Blue Max. Your Panther ship can
move left and right, up and down as you ﬂy over the
landscape. Starting in the desert, you must ﬂy over a large
lake before reaching the city itself and spaceport beyond.
The survivors are hiding in bunkers and oil rigs etc and you
must land safely in order to pick them up. As you are
constantly under attack from different waves of aliens, the
chances are that you will have to make several runs through
the area — a transmat at the sapceport will return you to the
appropriate position. As you near the city, so the enemy
radar will lock on to you unless you can ﬂy at a very low level
dodging buildings as you go.
Panther is not a bad little game, especially at the price.
The control required to handle your craft should give even
the most ardent arcade fan a good run for his money.

ANTIRIAD
A
nuclear winter, the earth begins to recover. From the chaos
has emerged a new race of man. Strong, brave and hardy, but
peaceful and simple too. The only shadow over their lives is
the superstition surrounding the ancient city, half buried at
the foot of a volcano.
Suddenly, from the sky appears a strange peril. An alien
race, ruthless and bloodthirsty, massacre hundreds of a
simple people and put them to work in the mines. They make
the ancient volcano their headquarters and the location of
their power source.
But the young race does not give up hope. Secretely they
raise young boys to reak revenge and save the race. One hero
emerges: Ta I. He is sent into the heart of the volcano to ﬁnd
the ancient sacred armour ﬁn reality an anti-red combat suit)
and with it he must destroy the power source at the heart of
the volcano.
The ﬁrst thing to do is to get through the forest. avoiding
the many extraterrestrial bugs which lurk there, and reach
the armour. When you get to it you'll ﬁnd that you need anti-
gravity boots and a blaster. So you have to get out of the
armour and ﬁnd the boots which are at the top of a tree, then
get back to the suit and ﬂoat about to ﬁnd the blaster.
All of  this involves an awful lot of death destruction,
mainly. for you, because when you're not in the suit with your
blaster, the only way you can kill anything is by chucking
rocks at them. However you're aim's not bad so there's hope
for you yet.

On the whole it's  quite a  nice game. graphics are
reminiscent of Cauldron II, and are varied and interesting.
It's also very difﬁcult so you'll need quite a bit of practice
especially t o  get the hang of that ﬂoating feeling when
you've managed to get the suit on the go. Make sure you pick
up lots of powercells as you go about, though, because if you
run out the suit dies and you have to get out. That's not nice
if you're deep in the volcano!

MARBLE MADNESS
T
of Ariolasoft. You're a marble, and you have to negotiate
various 3D mazes. The problem with being a marble is that
it's very difﬁcult to control our movements. A gentle shove
with the joystick to the left and you ﬁnd yourself careering
off the edge of the play area into an abyss.
Level one (of six) breaks you in quite gently and it may be
worth your while hanging around a bit on this one just to get
the hang on the controls. Each level has its own music, level
two's is very good, level four sounds like a chimp has been let
loose on a synth!
To be honest, I couldn't really get addicted, although I
know people who are. One of the main reasons for this is that
each level loads separately from disk and this seems to take
an awfully long time. The apparent reason for this is the
sophistication of the graphics and sound. The graphics are
truely wonderful, with beautiful colours and very effective
3D landscapes.
Hazards to avoid include marble eating worms. steelies
which are black marbles which try and push you off the edge.
bonuses to be gained if you get them ﬁrst. There are vacuum
cleaners which suck you off course and plenty of slopes and
bumps to send you spinning into oblivion.
If you like a game which is totally frustrating and very
different then this may keep you occupied for hours even if
it's only to stare at the fascinating mazes. Deﬁnitely worth a
try.

that's the case then Andrew Braybrook should be feeling
very ﬂattered indeed. Robobolt, is yet another attempt at a
Paradroid cum Uridium cum etc. sort of game. For my
money though. this attempt has not succeeded half as well as
some recent releases.
The basic principle behind the program, is to collect
Death pods, place them in the assembly area. thus enabling
you to warp to the next level. There are four pods to collect
on each level. The only trouble is. they have to be collected in
the correct order, otherwise they will be rejected_ Whilst you
are running around, trying to ﬁnd the pods, your energy is
diminishing rather rapidly. Energy can be maintained by
shooting the aliens roaming around, (two per level as far as I
can tell). To add to your troubles, you have a nasty time
counting down, which seems to be in permanent turbo drive.
The copy' that 1 reviewed had no sound at all, (except for
an opening number). The control of your craft is somewhat
sticky also.
All in all 1 found this program a little mundane and
uninteresting for my liking but at El .99 who's complaining?

hours, I'm still not sure exactly what you are supposed to do.
Obviously your task is to get out of Hades. How you do this
is a mystery. Granted you can collect treasures on your
travels, .iust how they help you, though, is not clear.
The game comprises of lots and lots of screens (well
actually, it's just one screen with a few different things in it
each time).

To get about, you have to jump over pits, swing from
ropes and cross chasms. The one really novel idea in the
game, which I personally found a bit annoying, is that the
music only plays if you are moving. Stand still and the music
stands still also.
The backdrops are somewhat confusing. 1 was always
under the impression that the underworld was Hades, not
the inside of an Egyptian tomb (well we live and learn).
Not wanting to seem all gloom and doom, the game does
have a little of the elusive, '1 must just have one more go'
about it.

COMPUTER HITS 3
C
Computer Hits 3 is one of the better examples of the genre,
offering 10 different titles. The emphasis is heavily on action
and, unlike certain rival products, none of the games are
really naff.
First off the block is Geoff Strongman Challenge. A
training session allows you to build up certain muscles
before going on to compete in events such as barrel loading,
tatrground bell and sumo wrestling. Elidon is an arcade
adventure in which you play a faerie trying to ﬁnd potions
and ﬂowers in order to make a garland for the Queen.
Blagger goes to Hollywood sees you trying to knock out
12 different stars with assorted props in an attempt to gain
access to Speilbutn's ofﬁce and steal a ﬁlm. Cauldron puts
you in the part of a witch trying to rid the land of the evil
pumpkin and thus becoming .t he witch queen. The ﬁrst tape
ends with 3D Lunattack, a mix of strategy and shoot-em-up
as you try to protect your base from the invading Seiddab
forces.
Still one of the most popular games in the ofﬁce, Crazy
Comets is a highly addictive shoot-cm-up in which you blast

planets before they turn into supernovae. Dynamite Dan is a
platform game in which y ou must ﬁnd eight sticks o f
dynamite with which to blow Lip the safe o f  the evil D r
Blitzen w ho has plans t o destroy the world. Herbert
Dummy Run is set in a toy store with young Herbert trying
to ﬁnd his lost parents and eating jelly babies as he goes to
keep his strength up.
Attack of the Mutant Camels is one of the ﬁrst games
that I ever played on the 64 and it is still a classic blast from
the past. What else could it be but a Jeff Minter game with a
name like that. The ﬁnal game is another arcade adventure.
The Adventures of Bond- Basildon Bond, based on the Russ
Abbot character. T h e  object is  t o  match jokes with
punchlines as you attempt to rescue Russ who has been
kidnapped by a rival comedy act.
None of the titles are the sort of games where you think '
must have that', but they are all average plus and 10 games for
the money must represent good value.

completed in one sitting. This program will only be mastered
by cunning strategy and patience on your part.
The principle o f  the game, is  t o  destroy the main
computer of the enemy, before he blows up the entire world.
To this end you pick a team of four superheroes, from a list
of eight. Each of you team is a master in one particular ﬁeld.
It's up to you to select the best team for the job. Once your
team starts its mission, control of each member is achieved
by simply pressing the corresponding number key (le: two
will make number two hero under control).
The complex is  represented i n  3 D  style, therefore
movement takes some lime t o  get used to. There are
numerous obstacles to overcome: Electriﬁed pressure pads,

robots, armed guards, locked doors, video cameras to name
but a few. How you overcome each obstacle is a matter of
trial and error.
There are some good sound effects used within the game.
The only real criticism is the method of controlling/using
your men (combinations of  keys, F-keys and joystick). I
always have difﬁculty remembering what does what.
For people tht lik e killing, maiming and generally
causing havoc - with strategy as well, then this is a must. I've
purposely not said too much about the game for fear of
spoiling it for you. Go out and buy it_

Lancaster and was certainly the most versatile of the three.
Very fast and manoeuvrable, it was used in both offensive
and defensive roles. Ace of Aces puts you in control of a
Mossie and gives you the chance to try your hand at several
different missions.
You can choose to ﬂy on just one or a combination of
missions from those available for selection. Possible targets
include V Is, U-Boats and trains. An intelligence brieﬁng
gives you speciﬁc target locations together with weather
details and you must then arm your plane. Depending on
what you are trying to hit, you can choose from rockets,
bombs and cannon. You should also ﬁll up with fuel at this
stage.
Once you have taken off (done automatically), you have
total control of  the plane. Two quick presses on the ﬁre
button and y ou can move the joystick t o select pilot,

selecting the appropriate weapon or auxiliary fuel tank. The

gives you access to throttle and ﬂaps control as well as a ﬁre
extinguisher should you come off second best in a dog ﬁght,
All the different functions are controlled by  moving a
marker to the appropriate dial or  switch. There is no
multitude of keys to try and remember.
The main part of the game is obviously with you in the
pilot's seat, Again, there are only a few dials for you to keep
your eyes on - airspeed, altimeter, compass and radar being
the main ones. The only real problem comes when you are in
bafﬂe. It is all too easy to get carried away and press the ﬁre
button twice in quick succession which promptly takes you
on to a different screen.
The best part about Ace of Aces is that, unlike other
ﬂight simulators, it is very easy to get into. This does not
mean that it easy to play, far from it, but there are practise
modes to let you get the hang of things. Other nice features
include the use of cloud when you can't see a thing and the
awarding of minus points if you hit the wrong targets so that
you can't just go out blasting everything in sight. All in Aka
very well thought out and highly enjoyable simulation.

teeding and orders Berk to concoct such delicacies as a can of
worms, boiled slimies and eyeball crush. The various bits of
equipment needed are to be found lying round the various
needs but Berk also needs to open the trapdoor and let out
one or other of the monsters to aid him in his task. For
example, to fry the eggs. Berk must ﬁrst release the bird and
ﬁnd some way of making it lay the eggs before he can collect
and cook them.
Objects can be picked up and carried and tipped up to
reveal their contents. Levers are operated just by standing
next to them. The attention to detail is excellent both in the
animation of the characters and the methods necessary to
produce the dishes. You have two so called friends to assist
you. Boni, a skull, will give you a clue if you pick him up but
Drutt, a small bouncy creature seems more of a hindrance
then a help. He loves eating the worms that you are trying to
catch. The solution lies in ﬁnding some way of enticing him
to fall down through the cellar.
The game's graphics are extremely large and colourful
but they do suffer from attribute problems! I know what you
are thinking- if you wanted those, you would have bought a
Spectrum and what makes the pill even more bitter to
swallow is that the Spectrum version doesn't suffer from the
problem! But this is only a minor hiccup in what must surely
be one of the most original and enjoyable games of the year.

distinguished, something that cannot always be said fot
other chess programs. Moving is simplicity itself. Select a
piece with the cursor and it changes colour so that you can
see instantly that you have selected the one that you wanted.
Similarly when you select the desi nation square. There is no
need to bother with algebraic notation or P-K4 or whatever.
If the computer won't accept your input, it is because you are
trying to make an illegal move.
Pressing the space bar brings up a list of options as well as
details of the moves made so far. You can take moves back
(shame on you!), change the computer's skill level, swap
sides or even ask for  a hint. Positions can be set up for
problem solving and there is a demo mode if you get fcd up
of being beaten.
The crunch question when it comes to considering any
chess program is how good is it and similarly, it is almost
impossible to answer. For any beginner or someone who is
out to improve their game. any program should sufﬁce. The
optimum is to set the skill level just a little bit better than you
are. For the more serious player, Cyrus II will still provide a
strong challenge although you would ideally need to try a
few games to assess its ability against yours.
But for the majority of players, Cyrus m a k e s  an ideal
opponent and should be high on your list of programs to
consider.

has ﬁnally hit the shelves. The original, you may remember,
was the ﬁrst of  a plethora or martial arts game. Way of
the Ex ploding F is t  w a s  a  s traightforward k ar ate

before he did likewise to you. In this sequel, Melbourne
House has kept the same combat ideas but transferred
the action to an arcade adventures.
YOUR COMMODORE january 1987

The scenario is that the Warriors of the Exploding Fist
have been betrayed over the centuries and the land is now
under the rule of the evil Warlord. Nobody has seen his
fortress but plenty of rumours exist, featuring volcanoes and
underwater labyrinths. The ﬁghting secrets of the Masters
are supposed to be hidden somewhere in the land in the form
of scrolls and there are shrines and temples to be found
where an aspiring master can meditate and seek guidance.
Such a  person is  y ou. Although initially  weak and
inexperienced, the elders hope that you possess the necessary
talent to overcome your common adversary.
The scrolls that you must ﬁnd contain knowledge in the
form of trigrams. The secret is to match that trigram with the
appropriate temple and thus learn its secrets. For example.
Ch'ien is associated with strength and Tui connected with
imparting a  sense o f  well being when surrounded by
malignance. Temples are also important as they restore your
energy and heal you should you be poisoned.
There are a variety of foes for you to ﬁght ranging from
simple but aggressive peasants t o  mighty Shoguns and
deadly assassins. There are also creatures of the wild to be
faced, snakes and panthers etc. The action takes place in a
variety of locations — outside, in buildings and caves and
even in water. This last location is tricky as not all your
moves are effective here. Movement is only from side to side
but there are pits to fall into and ladders to climb. The only
annoying part of the game is as you move round, waiting for
the next screen to catch you up y o u  move off one edge and
then action is suspended as the next one scrolls past you.
The idea o f  a quest rather than just straight combat
works very well indeed as there is the added impetus to have
just one more go and ﬁnd out what is behind the next corner.
Be warned though, your task will not be an easy one and you
will have to do really well before the warlord even takes
notice of you. Fortunately, you have the option to practise •
all your moves beforehand. Side two of the tape contains a
training mode. A nice touch from a game destined to head
the charts.

To overcome this problem J CL
Software has produced an integrated

Micro Clerk comes complete with two
disks, a manual and a dongle. In case
you have never heard of a dongle, this
is a small security device which plugs
into your computer, in this case the
joystick port. The program will only
work i f  this dongle is in place. This
means that you can make as many
security copies of the software as you
require but can only use them with the
dongle.
The manual is clearly written and
put together in such a way that even a
complete newcomer to computers will
be happily using the software within a
few minutes of getting it home. It starts

package and then goes on to give hints
and tips to beginners such as telling
typists that the letters land o cannot be
used instead of the numbers I and 0 as
they are on many typewriters. The
simple style of the manual is lightened
even further will small cartoons and
pictures spread around the document-
ation, all of  course illustrating some
very important point, such as keeping
your pets away from your disks.
Floppy disks are dealt w ith i n
detail and it clearly explains what you
can and can't do with them and the fact
that you need to back up vour software
for security is continually repeated. In
fact, the software is written in such a
way that it is impossible to use the
disks t h a t  ar e included w it h  t h e
package. As soon as you LO AD them
into your computer you are whisked
off into the backup section o f  the

program ﬁnding yourself copying the
disks,
As I have mentioned the software is
supplied on two disks, this means that
a certain amount of disk swapping is
involved even if you have two drives,
one for the software and one for your
data disks. However if you own a 1571
then it is possible to ﬁt all of the soft-
ware on one disk which means that you
could leave it in the drive. JCL has said
that they will produce single disks
versions o f  the software for  people
who contact them.
When confronted with anything new
it's usually advisable to go on some
sort o f  training course t o learn all
about it. Micro-Clerk comes complete

typing and ﬁling which will get you
used to the package and some of its
capabilities.
Upon loading the program you will be
presented with a notice board. Here
you will ﬁnd any message that the
previous user has left for you. An alter
date function lets you set up todays
date for use within the program while
!he Diary function allows you to look
at the selected months appointments,
birthdays etc.
Once you have ﬁnished with the
notice board then it's on to the main
menu. here you can select at the press
of a key the following options:
Accounts - the book keeping functions
Typing - the wordprocessor for typing
letters
Filing - the database
Spreadsheet - for cashilow forecasts

One extremeley nice function is the
ability to press the HELP key at any
time. Should you press the key while

to the above is given together with
where you can ﬁnd more information
within the package. When help is
C128 REVIEW
selected you arc also given the chance
of printing the help screen out and
editing the screen.
Should you select typing from the
main menu then the computer will go
away and load the Wordprocessor
from disk. Again you will be presented
with a menu of options, as with the
main menu. These are:
Edit text
Load from disk
Store on disk
Print on paper
Clear textspace and
Destroy text ﬁle
I think that all of the above options are
self explanatory anti therefore need
not be dealt with in more detail.
The wordprocessor isn't as ﬂash as
some of the dedicated wordprocessor
programs that are available on the
market i t does however offer a few
'nice' tlinctions which make it both
pleasant and easy to  use. Options
available to the user are as you would
expect inserting and deleting of lines
and characters, an automatic insert
that allows you to add text in the
middle of text already entered. Unlike
with a typewriter the only time that
you are required to enter a carriage
return is when you %rant to force a line
feed, such as at the end of the text. The
program has an automatic word wrap
which will prevent the rest of the para-
graph from appearing on one line.
The ﬁnd option allows you to
search any word in the text making it
easy to  move around the text.
The block functions allow you to
delete blocks of text from your article
as well as print them or move them
elsewhere.
If you are lucky enough to own a
printer that supports such features as
Underline, Italics o r  Near Letter
Quality then you can make use o f
these. The setup printer section of the
program allowing you to customise the
program for speciﬁc printer.
A couple of extremely nice and use-
ful touches to this word processor are
the *date and *name commands.
Whenever these are found within a
document the program will automati-
cally insert the current date, entered
when loading the program and the
name and address of your company.
For companies who have large
YOUR COMMODORE january 1987
51
mailing lists you will no doubt ﬁnd the
mailmerge option o f use. This will
allow you to insert information within
your text that has been retrieved from
the database, for example the name
and address of all your clients. Pro-
vision is also made to allow you to
enter a merge list, the information to
be entered into the text, from the key-
board which is useful for those one off
letters. A number of advanced features
are included here with allow you to
perform calculations on information
before it is entered into the letter you
can even set the number of decimal
places that are used when printing
numbers.
All i n  all the wordprocessor is
excellent f o r  producing sma l l
documents or letters. As I have said
none of the fancy features available
with larger wordprocessors, such as
spelichecking, are present but it will
make sending out letters etc. much
easier.

The database or ﬁling section of the
program i s  where you can store
information such a s  names a n d
addresses or items in stock.
For those of you who may have
never come across a database it can be
viewed as a type o f electronic card
index box. As with the cards yu can
decide what information that you wish
to store and in what format you want
to hold it. However a database is much
more ﬂexible. Let's say for example
that you have a list of club members
stored under their surname. The ﬁle
may contain their name, address and
whether they have paid their subscrip-
tion.
Now let's say that you want a list
of all people who hadn't paid up. With
the card index system you would have
to go through each card in turn taking
out the people who hadn't paid. With a
database then you could ask it to give
you a list of people who hadn't paid

and i t  w o u l d  d o  s o  a l m o s t
immediately. Further more you could
then get the computer to print out a
reminder letter t o  them w it h  t h e
amount they owe, complete with their
name and address in the relevent parts
of the letter.
Deﬁning the layout of your ﬁle is
extremeley easy. When you design the
way that it's going to look you can
specify that particular entries must be
text, numeric only (with a limit on
decimal places) or a date ﬁeld, Once a
database has been set up there are no
problems sorting it into any order that
you require. for example you could
produce a list of people who live in
London in  alphabetical order. I t  is
•even possible to put several different
conditions that mus t be met. F o r
example you could ask for a list along
the following lines:
A list of all the people living in London
whose subscription has run out.
As you call no doubt appreciate this is
much easier than having to do it by
hand.
When pr inting t he information
from within Micro-Clerk it is possible
to select REPORT format or LABELS
format. The REPORT I unction allows
you to print a neat report with up to
eight lines given over to each record.
You can decide how you want the
printout to be laid out and the ﬁelds
that you require printing.
Labels, as the title suggests, allows you
to print out the information stored
within Micro -Clerk on to self-adhesive
labels. Each label can have up to six
lines printed on it  and up to three
different ﬁelds. You can print either
one. two or  three labels across the
paper.
Spreadsheet
A spreadsheet is of use to anyone who
has to produce a lot of related calcu-
lations. for example a forecast on the
cashﬂow of a company. Usually these
forecasts are produced on large pieces
of paper split into rows or columns.
Speciﬁc information is placed into the
gaps remaining. Then calculations are
carried out o n  either the rows o r
columns to show totals.
The computer version o f  this is
called a spreadsheet. The screen acts as
a window over the larger spreadsheet
allowing you to see speciﬁc portions of
your data. You can type headings,
ﬁgures a n d  for mulae i n t o  a n y
locations on the sheet, then once the
data has been entered you can perform
calculations at the press of a button.
The spreadsheet offers all o f  the
usual facilities associated with such a
program. As with all the sections of
this software the use of the program is
clearly explained and you should be
able t o  use i t  without t o o  many
problems.
Cash Book
C128 REVIEW
The cashbook will probably be the
most important part of the software
package. It allows you to simply type
in details of everything you buy and
sell. You have the option of doing this
each day, or every few days. as long as
you keep the information accurate and
as up to date as possible. At the end of
each week y ou select the END O F
W E E K  f u n c t i o n  w h i c h  w i l l
automatically print out a list, in the
form o f  double-entry account book
pages, of everything entered during the
last week. Even tedious things such as
VAT are taken care of.
The fac ility  exists t o  produce
Proﬁt/Loss reports  a t  a n y  t i m e
showing ex ac tly  wher e y o u  a r e
spending most money, and how much
you have spent this year.
As with all of the programs in this
package you are presented with the
various options when the program
starts. Available to you are:
Entries which allows y ou t o  enter
details of income payments, bank ings
etc.
Print -  allows you to print out lists of
all information entered.
General -  Setting up the cash book
Headings - This allows you to alter the
Analysis headings a n d  p r in t  o u t
various types of reports.
Up until now I  have stated that
accounts are produced on a weekly
YOUR COMMODORE january 1987
52
basis. One nice feature is that you can
select t o  work  o n  a  monthly basis
should you prefer.
Setting up the program to suit your
own business is extremely easy, all of
the headings being under your control,
The only slightly confusing thing is
that you must give each heading an
analysis code. These codes must be in
the range of 100-999 as well as there
being special groups within there. For
example codes heading in 00 are main
group titles. You can of  course print
off a list of headings and codes at any
time.
Should y o u  choose t h e  entries
option of' the program then you will be
asked what type of entry that you wish
to mak e t o  t h e  system. O ptions
available a r e  Receipts, Rankings.
Payments, Transfers a n d  Standing
orders. All of  which need no further
explination.
At some stage within the program
you will require printouts of speciﬁc
details from your cash-hook. All of the
following are available and will no
doubt keep you accountants happy for
quite a while:
Audit Trail -  A list of everything that
you have entered this last week.
Sales Report -  A report of cash sales,
and any other income.
Sales Analysis - A list of the total sales
of each heading for the current week.
Purchase Report -  A record of every-
thing that you have purchased over the
last week
Purchase Analysis -  Total purchases
for the last week under each heading.
Money in/out -  A list o f  all money
received or paid out by the business
during the last week.
Bank Report -  All entries affecting
your bank account.
Transfers - A list showing all transfers
you have entered during the past week.
Evidently this is what accountants call
a Nominal Journal.
Stock by  Value -  A  list showing a
summary of each stock group and its
values.

Day Analysis Sales and Purchases A
list of all sales or purchases for each
day of the week.
Trading T h i s  shows a l l  Sales.
Purchases and Expenses during this
period, and then produces a calcula-
tion of your Gross and Net proﬁt.
Balance Sheet A  balance sheet for
your business.
VAT Report A  VAT  report can be
printed at any time though you only
need one when you are required to ﬁll
in a VAT form each quarter.
That jus t about covers the cash
book operations of the program. As
you can no doubt see it is extremely
comprehensive a n d  obviously f a r
easier to use than a number of books.
The number of different reports that
can be produced should deﬁnitely keep
your accountant quiet for quite some
time.
Bits and Pieces
I have covered the main sections of the
program above, however there are
quite a number o f  smaller but very
useful facilities available within the
program. I have already mentioned the
use of the HELP key and that it gives a
brief description of whatever you are
doing together with the page number
of where to ﬁnd more information in
the manual. As well as the help key
many others have functions.
I w ill allow you to access the
programs disk functions. From within
this option you can Display the ﬁles on
the disk in the drive that are relevant to
the section o f  the program you are
using. You can print a full list of all the
ﬁles should you require. Free Space
will tell you just how much room is left
on your disk and you can format new
disks when the need arises.
F2 calls u p the printer options.
Here you can set the size of the paper
that you are using, tell the printer to
move to a new page, check that the
printer is on-line and ready to use.

Page Pause will set the program up in
such a way that the printout will pause
after each page, this will allow you to
use single sheet paper.
The Printer Yes/No option is quite
an oddity, although quite useful, as the
program can be forced to produce all
printouts to the screen rather than to
the printer.
The Linefeed key at the top of the
keyboard can be used at any time to
move the paper up one line in the
printer_

Function Key F3 gives you access
to what is probably one of the most
useful facilities, that of the electronic
jotters.
Electronic jotters allow you to use
all or part of the screen as a form of
notepad. This means that you could
take telephone messages, notes etc.
and place them in a jotter, just as you
would d o with a  writing pad, The
contents of a jotter can be recalled at
anytime a n d  reproduced o n  t h e
printer.
The jotter can also be used t o
'capture' whatever is on the screen
when the F3 key is pressed. This means
that you can copy the screen from one
program, then using the paste function
you can then place this information
into another program. For example
you may  take a  record fr om the
database and then paste it into a word-
processor tile. Function key number 4
allows you to set the date, call up a
calculator, handy for quick calcula-
tions, and use the printer as a type-
writer, ie. you can type a single line on
the keyboard and then send it to the
printer.
A diary is available on the F5 key.
This will display a calendar for the
current month on the screen. You can
then set up a diary page for any month
allowing you to set up appointments
for the month etc.
Should you ever require a copy of
the screen the F6 will provide you with
a copy on the printer.
While y ou are i n  the accounts
YOUR COMMODORE january 1987
53
mode of Micro-Clerk you can examine
any Analysis Heading, change the
VAT code etc. This allows you to gain
instant access to the amount of money
in your Bank Account, or how much
money is owed to you.
Verdict
Because this package is  so compre-
hensive it is  impossible to give you
more than just a taste of what it can do.
The package is continually being ex-
panded, with new modules becoming
available all the time In fact I have just
received Sales Ledger and Purchase
Ledger programs that can be used with
the program.
Because o f  the complexity and
versatility of  the program it is being
given to an accountant and to someone
who is just setting up a small business
to use in a practical application. I hope
that in a month or so I will be able to
report their reaction to the program
together with more details about the
Sales and Purchase Ledger.
Amstrad and Ala n  Sugar have
made a k illing in the small business
market w it h  their  range o f  small
business c omputer s  t h a t  c o m e
complete with software. Micro Clerk is
superior to that supplied with those
machines and I am sure that the C128
and Commodore would have, and may
still, get a larger share o f  the small
business market if  this software was
given away with the machine. Even so
since i t  is  possible t o  purchase a
complete C I  28 system with two disk
drives and a printer for under E1000
this product is well worth taking a look

On The Blink
C
Drop whatever you're doing and read
on.
How many times have you been
developing a  large scale Basic pro-
gram and wished that there was an
easier way? N o w  there is  because
Blinker-64 from Information Develop-
ment Systems has come to your rescue.
Just w h a t  i s  Blinker-64? T h e
answer is quite simple: Bunker-64 is a
linkage editor for Basic programs. It
enables programs to be constructed
from a  number o f  small modules
stored as ﬁles on one or more disks.
The m a in  advantages t o  t h is
approach to programming are ﬁrstly
that small modules or subroutines are
easier t o  handle, edit ar id debug.
Secondly, programming in  Basic is
made more productive and enjoyable.
Modules developed for one program
can be saved as part of  a library of
modules and used as component parts
of others as easily as standard Basic
statements. As your library grows, so
your ability  t o  produce larger and
more complex programs increases.
Basically, Blinker-64 allows the
programmer to make up a program of
subroutines, then knit them togther to
form a whole, The following example
should show this clearly.
Normal Basic Program
10 P0KE53280. 0:P0KE53281,0:
POKE646.2
15 GOSUB500
20 PRINT "NOW IS THE TIME ETC
ETC"
20 GOSUB600
30 PRINT "PRESS AN Y KEY T O
CONTINUE"
40 GOSUB 700
50 END
500 P0KE53265, PEEK (53265) AND

C64 REVIEW
Basic programmers take heart. This new software from
Information Development Systems should make life a lot
easier.
By Paul Eves
500 P0KE53265.PEEK (53265) OR 16
620 RETURN
700 WA1T198.1:POKE198,0
720 RETURN
As you can see, this program is
made up of a number of subroutines,
some may be called repeatedly, others
only once. Trying to keep track of all
these subroutines in a large program
can become tiresome. Moreover the
next time you write something else you
have to re-do all the subroutines again
which can become very monotonous.
With h Blin k e r - 6 4 t h e  a b o v e
program would look like this:
Blinker-64 Program
10 P0KE53280,0: P0KE53281,0:
PO K E646,2
20 GOSUB"SCREEN OFF"
30 PRINT "NOW IS THE TIME ETC
ETC"
40 GOSUB "SCREEN O N"
50 PR1Nr'PRESS A N Y  K E Y  T O
CONTINUE"
60 GOSUB "G ET KEY"
70 END
The subroutines 'screen o f f ' ,
'screen on' and 'get key' would be
individual ﬁles saved on your library
disk.
When Blinker-64 is invoked with
your blink command, it runs through
your BASE program (i.e. the one in
memory). Whenever it comes across a
GOSUB ' x x x ' ,  i t  fetc hes  t h a t
subroutine f r o m  y o u r  d is k  a n d
appends it  at the end o f  your base
program. After  all operations have
been done i t  renumbers the entire
program, substituting y our  named
subroutines for numbered ones.
The above ﬁles ar e k nown as
CODE ﬁles. One other use of Blinker-
64 is the handling of DATA ﬁles.
The principle is the same, with a
couple o f  exceptions. Data ﬁles can
only contain REM and D AT A token
words. Any  other token word would
YOUR COMMODORE january 1987

result in a fatal error.
There is a maximum of 255 distinct
module references t h a t  c a n  b e
appended in a single run_ Line number
values, previously considered impor-
tant when appending or merging Basic
programs, are now  o f  little conse-
quence. Blinker-64 always produces a
c orrec tly  n u m b e r e d  p r o g r a m ,
regardless o f  line numbers i n  any
constituency source module,
Whenever Blinker-64 ﬁnishes a
run, a  summary screen is  displayed
giving some simple statistics about the
linked program. The summary looks
like this:
1. Start o f  BASIC — Lower limit o f
BASIC memory area
2. Start of VARIABLES — End address
of BASIC program
3. T op o f  BASIC — Upper limit o f
BASIC memory area
4. CODE modules named — Number of
Code modules included, inc luding
base mod.
5. CODE modules included — Number
of modules in linked program
6. D AT A modules named — Number
of D A T A  modules  speciﬁed o n
command line
7. DAT A Modules included —Number
of DATA modules included in linked
program
8, Bad Filenames — Number of illegal
module references encountered
9. Bad line numbers — Number o f
illegal line numbers encountered.
There is so much more I could say
about t h e  program, unfortunately
space is running out. All I need say is
that after trying this program out. I felt
that no Basic programmer should be
without it.

he purpose of these programs is to
copy whole disks on tape, so as to store
them in a convenient low volume form.
The backup on tape proceeds at 16
times the standard C M  speed (even
faster t h a n  standard t u r b o  t a p e
format!) This means that the 175K of a
1541 disk drive are packed on only ﬁve
minutes of tape.
Data is saved in three steps each of
which saves approximately 60K o f
data, in  track increasing order. A l l
blocks are transferred, even free ones.
This ensures that a  disk copy w ill
always ﬁt the .atne length of tape, a
useful feature if  you want to rewrite
updated data over an already existing
copy. (However there is one exception
— if blocks do not read properly, they
are written in shortform so the entire
copy will be shorter. It also means that
it is not really worthwhile to use this
program to save nearly empty disks.)
the program is  made up o f  two
complimentary par ts : M C O P Y T D
and MCOPYDT. MCO PYT D saves
data on tape and MCOPYDT reads it
back to disk. These programs can also
be used with the 1571 disk drive in 1541
mode. However only single sided disks
or the ﬁrst side of a double sided one
can be saved with this version of the
program. To use MCOPY, just RIJN
the two Basic programs (when keying
these, d o n ' t  f o r g e t  t h e  D A T A
000,000. l i n e s ,  since the checksum
does not detect such omissions). O f
course, since they are created on disk,
a formatted disk must be in the drive.
Getting Started
Load MCOPYDT (disk to tape).
Make certain that you are past the
leader of the tape.
Put the disk to be copied in the drive,
Run MCO PYDT : the introductory
message appears_
Press record and play (the tape does
not move yet).

A handy set of two programs to help you save your
programs to tape in a convenient ﬁrm.
By Jean Lebailley
Press RETURN. The program starts to
read the disk, then transfers its con-
tents on to tape in three steps. DO
NOT stop the recorder between steps.
When the process ends the message
"END O F  CO PY" appears, along
with error messages if needed. Note the
tape counter value.
An error does not always mean
that the whole copy is bad. However
when the tape is reread the same error
will be recreated on the new disk (also
the copy o n tape will be shorter).
Therefore, it is up to the user to decide
what to do when such an error occurs.
Reading Back
Load MCOPYTD (tape to disk).
Put a new disk in the drive.
Put a cassette into the datasette. Posi-
tion tape to read the ﬁrst of the three
subsections previously saved. Reading
over the end of other data does not
matter since MC O PY o n ly  starts
reading after having found a special
synchronising header.
Run M CO P Y D
The read back proceeds in the same
way as MCOPYDT, in three steps.
At the end o f  the process, the
message "END OF COPY" appears.
Remove the disk from drive (it doesn't
matter if the red LED is still on, this is
normal).
Two k inds  o f  errors c an arise
during the readback process. Unfortu-
nately, they are almost always fatal.
WRITE ERRO R T R A C K  N N  —
means that the drive could not reread
the data, it just writes on that track.
This is usually caused by a bad disk.
Try again with another one (see also
TAPE LOADING ERROR).
TAPE LOADING ERROR — The cas-
sette could not be read back properly.
This is usually caused by one of the
following:
YOUR COMMODORE january 1987
58
Bad tape; use only good quality cas-
settes. Alt h o u g h  t h e  enc ry ption
scheme used to write on tape is very
reliable by itself, a singly false bit in the
601(4 causes the error. I previously
wrote these programs using standard
turbo routines but an error occured
nearly every time in one of the three
sequences, it was also slower and the
length of tape used was data depend-
ent. (10 took less time to save than 'FF's.)
Try to save 60K with standard turbo
on the same tape you are very likely to
see several errors, not just one.
Read head is dirty, clean it.
Read head has gone out of alignment
since the tape was written. Realign it.
The recorder has been knocked or
moved during read or write: this causes
tape speed changes that can lead to
errors.
The tape has been damaged, usually
unrecoverable.
Too muc h fric tion inside cassette.
Rewind it and retry.
You can (and it is recommended)
leave blank space on tape between
disks: to do that, just press the !  key
and the recorder starts. Stop by press-
ing any other key.

Neglected C16
I am writing with reference to  R.
Jones's letter in the November issue of
Your Commodore.
R. Jones wrote regarding the lack
of magazines for the C16. I buy two
Commodore magazines, one of which
is Your Commodore Both give the CI6
a fair chance but i f  you buy any
magazine you should expect it to be
dominated with articles for the CM.
There i s  a  magazine available
which caters for just the C16 and
Plus/4 but it is only obtainable by mail
order subscription. The fee is EIO (EIS
overseas) and i t features reviews of
hardware and software. Club members
are allowed free classiﬁed ads and club
mailings throughout the year. It's a
monthly magazine so that's not had
for a  tenner is it? Cheques, postal
orders or international money orders
should be sent to: Micro C16/Plus 4
User Club, (20 User), Micro Media, 42
Mount Stewart St, Carluke, Lanark-
shire ML8 5EB.
Also, if any C16 Plus/4 owners are
interested in user deﬁned character
sets they can send me an SAE and I will
send a copy on tape.
H Jenkins, 2 7  College Glade,

Nationwide Club
Perhaps Your Commodore would be
interested to know about the recent
formation of The National Computer
Club, As Mr Humphrey pointed out in
November's mailbag, other magazines
have moved towards game playing and
away from real computing. Unfortun-
ately, localised computer clubs have,
all too often, done the same thing.
Consequently, computer hobbyists
have tended to drift away and their
expertise has gone with them. This has
left large numbers o f  enthusiasts
without the personal contact with
other enthusiasts that progression and
development of ideas needs.
The National Computer Club
MAIL
Letters
The page in Your Commodore written by our readers for
our readers.
(NCC) is seeking to ﬁll the gap by
providing all the beneﬁts of a local
computing club but on a nationwide
scale, giving members the beneﬁt of
personal contact with a large pool of
knowledge, expertise and experience.
Our aim is to produce an environ-
ment, within the club, where members
can contact one another to  ﬁnd
solutions t o  problems, answers to
queries or to form computing relation-
ships w i t h  o th e r, like-minded,
members.
The club caters for all levels of
expertise from beginners to  experts
and for all machines —even home built.
This is important because we view
computing as 'computing' and not
'Spectruming', 'Commodore 64ing' or
even 'Beebing'. No disrespect intended
since most of us limit our computing to
just one machine, but interests, within
the overall term 'computing', range
from Ba si c programming ri g h t
through to machine building and a
great deal o f information and pro-
gramming (with modiﬁcations) i s
applicable to all machines, e,g, address
decoding, machine code ﬂow charts,
etc.
The NCC is a 'computing' club and
therefore caters fo r  all computing
interests. O f  course a Commodore
user, thinking of buying a particular
program, might want to  hear the
views of others who already haye the
program. In  the NCC he can ask
them. I should add that the excellent
hobby of games writing is a part of the
NCC, but games playing, on its own, is
not. However, players who wish to
move into computing are very wel-
come.
The w ay that members make
contact with otherw whether for help
or fo r  computing relationships i s
through our monthly bulletin which is
for the free use of members. Included
in it are: sales, wants, queries (could be
difﬁculties or general interest), general
projects, items o f  interest such as
utility routines, techniques, etc, and
whatever else the members would like
to say. For instance somebody might
need the pin-out of a particular logic
chip. 1 le could aks for it in the bulletin
and other members who just happen to
YOUR COMMODORE january 1987
64
have that information would send it
directly to him. He might also have
stated what he is doing, etc and asked
for others who are doing the same to
get in touch for the sharing of inform-
ation and mutual progression.
Finally, for a mere SAE, I would be
pleased to send further details of the
NCC to any of your readers.

I am a reader of Your C'ommodore and
I have founded, with two other people,
a Commodore user club for C64 and
Cl28 owners (disk drive only).
We h a ve  approximately 2 0
members i n  Switzerland, France,
Belgium and one i n  Norway. We
would like to get in touch with users in
the UK and USA. If any Your Com-
modore readers are interested w e
would be very pleased to hear from
them. We would also like to hear from
other Commodore computer clubs,

Giveaway Success
very rarely write a letter to a
computer magazine, but I think Your
Commodore deserves one. Firstly
because of the free tape you supplied
with the November issue.
The game R I D I  was brilliant,
great graphics, good sound and very
addictive gameplay. It was better than
a lot of games I have bought from the
shops. I think the author of the game,
Tony Crowther deserves a lot of credit.
May I also thank you for including
information and software fo r  the
CI 28, as I  have recently bought a
Commodore 128. Your Commodore
seems to be the only magazine with
sufﬁcient coverage of this computer.
Well done, thank  y o u  f o r  a
fabulous magazine.

now create their own designs on their
computers. T he CAD-Master pack
(CAD = Computer Aided Design) for
the CI6 and Plus/4 machines is a light
pen based system and comes complete
with menu driven software and special
adaptor. Setting up the system is very
straightforward. T he adaptor plugs
into the joystick port and converts the
non-standard c irc ular Commodore
port into the more normal D-type
socket. There are two versions of the
program - one for each machine so it is
necessary to make sure that you load in
the correct one -  especially as the
Plus/4 will load both and there is a
considerable difference in the number
of functions available. The reivew will
concentrate o n  the Plus /4 version
unless otherwise speciﬁed.
After loading, you are presented
with a menu screen detailing the dif-
ferent shapes, pen widths and colours
available to you. Selecting an option is
simply a case of pointing the light pen
to the appropriate area of the screen.
You can draw on screen in a variety of
styles. Thick and thin lines, solid or
dotted and three different thicknesses
of italic. Drawing freehand is horribly
slow a n d  pernic k ety  a n d  tak es
considerable practice to master. Any
joystick or trackball system could beat
the light pen hands down. Shape
drawing is considerably easier. Select
the shape or pattern from the menu -
you can select from boxes, banding,
rays, lines, triangles and circles. Posi-
tion the light pen in the approximate

position on the screen where you want
the shape and press the control key.
The screen ﬂashes and a dot appears
where your light pen was. This can now
be ﬁnely adjusted using the cursor keys
and the process repeated for, say, the
other two points of the traingle.
Areas of your design can be copied
elsewhere o n  the screen, doubling
either or both of height and width if

available pens and the wash function
should be made in  order t o  avoid
colour clashes in intersections of lines
and shapes. Text can also be included
in your pictures should you wish to
caption them.
!laving considerably less memory
to play with, the C16 version is written
in only 2K. Naturally, there is no room
for certain functions and the ones
omitted were the freehand drawing
and associated options such as italics
etc. One feature not included in the
Plus/4 version is the ability to draw
either a  circle o r  an ellipse. T he
manual, which is  generally poor, is
decidedly dreadful here. Apart from

insisting on calling ellipses eclipses!
There is also the following piece of
wafﬂe. Having positioned the centre of
the circle, the second point selected in
the CIRCLE must be at 45 degrees to
the ﬁrst point or an ECLIPSE (sic) will
be draw'. The problem is  that two
points can never be at an angle to each
other -  they are joined by a straight
line so the above is nonsensical. What I
think they meant to say was that if you
imagine a vertical line drawn through
the ﬁrst dot, then the second dot can
subtend an angle of 45 degrees to that
line. In other words, if north is at the
top of the screen, then you get a circle if
the second dot is at NW, NE, SE or
SW, Anywhere else results i n  a n
ellipse.
Using the light pen itself, is an
acquired art. You don't need to apply
pressure but you do have to ensure that
the pen is ﬂush with the screen -  not
always easy with a curved screen. My
own personal experience is that they
are unwieldy and cumbersome to use

listings are free of those horrible little
black blobs which send you searching
around the keyboard for a suitable
graphic symbol. You may also have
noticed the funny numbers by the side
of each line of the listing. Fret no more,
it's all part of our easy entry aid.
Instead of those nasty graphics arid
rows o f countless spaces in PRINT
statements and strings we use a special
coding system. T h e  code, o r
mnemonic, i s always contained i n
square brackets and you'll soon learn
to decipher their meanings.
For example, ISA] would mean
type in a Shifted A. or an ace of spades
in layman's terms, and [SAI01 would
mean a row of ten of these symbols.
[S+2I means hold down the shift
key and press the plus key twice. It
doesn't take a great leap of logic to
realise that [C+.2] means exactly the
same thing except that the Commo-
dore key (bottom left of the keyboard)
is held down instead of the shift key.
If more than two spaces appear in a
statement then this will be printed as
[SPC41 or, exceptionally, [SSPC41.
Translated into English this means
press the spacebar four times or in the
latter case hold the shift key down
while you do it.
A string of special characters could
appear as:
[CTRL N , DOWN2,LEFT5,BLUE,
F3,C3]
This would be achieved by holding
Listings

for the C64.
down the CTRL key as you press N,
press the cursor key down twice, the
cursor left key ﬁve times, press the key
marked BLUE while holding down the
CTRL key, press the F3 key and,
ﬁnally hold the Commodore key down
while pressing the number two key (C2
would of course make the computer
print in brown).
Always remember that you should
only have a row of graphics characters
on your screen with no square brackets
and no commas, unless something like
this appears:
ISS1,1C*]
In this case the two characters should
have a comma between them.
On rare occasions [REV T1 will
appear in a listing. This is a delete
symbol and is created by entering the
line up to this mnemonic. Then type a
closing quotation mark (SHIFT & 2)
and delete it. This gets the computer
out of quotes mode. Hold down CTRL
and press th e  number nine key
(RVSON), type the relevant number of
reversed T's and then hold down
CTRL and press zero (RVSOFF).
Next type another quotation mark and
delete it again. Now ﬁnish the line and
press RETURN.
A list of these special cases is given
in the table but remember that only
one o f these mnemonics will appear
outside of a PRINT string: the symbol
for pi. This may appear when its value
is needed in a calculation Sc) this may
look something like:

At the start of each programming
session, load Checksum and run it.
The screen will turn brown with yellow
characters and each time you type in a
line and press the RETURN key a
number will appear on the screen in
white. This should be the same as the
corresponding value in the magazine.
If the two values don't relate to one
another, you have not copied the line
exactly as printed so go back and check
each character carefully. When you

area where Checksum lies you can ge

No system is foolproof but the
chances of two errors cancelling one

believe our listings are more reliable
than any other magazine in the world.

cassettes available to readers of  the
magazine who own Clos or Plus/4s
together with a disk option that will

Versions of the disk or tape will be
made available approximately every

we have collected enough material to

have to wait a few months for some of
the software, but I'm sure that you will
think it is worth the wait.
The cost of this service is the same
as the tapes and disks for the C64 and

Full Speed Ahead
As you are all no doubt aware the
cassette loading and saving on the C16
and Plus/4 is extremely slow. In the
February 1986 issue of the magazine
we published a routine that will allow
you to save your own programs at 10
times the normal speed. This program
YOUR COMMODORE january 1987

has proved to be one o f  our most
popular programs for these machines.
Character Generator
The C16 and Plus/4 computers allow
you to re-deﬁne the character set. This
extremely useful program allows you
to do this with ease and then save your
results for use at a later date. From
April 1986.
C16 Synth
This program was published as part of
our Programming the CI6 series. It has
proved extremely popular and has
been used to great effect by a number
of people. Basically t h e  program
allows you to generate music on your
CI6 that is run independently of any
programs allowing to add music to
your own program ﬂing masterpiece,
From May 1986.
C16 Assembler
No doubt many  o f  you w ill have
played around with a little machine
code. The CI 6 and Plus/4 have built in
monitors that makes this extremely
easy. By adding this program to your
collection y ou will be able to write,
your own assembler programs with
greater ease. From June 1985.

nce upon a time the main corn-
0
pany producing cartridges for the C64
was C ommodor e it s e lf ,  c los ely
followed b y  Supersoft. Apar t from
Simon's Basic, most of CBM's output
was games. Supersoft specialised in the
excellent monitor series but no-one
else really cared.
Suddenly there's a glut o f  these
boxes on the market. Let's consider
what the ideal cartridge should contain
and see how a few of the most popular
ones measure up.
For most people it seems that a
turbo tape-to-disk back-up facility is
vital but most serious users would also
insist upon a  code monitor. Basic
extensions should be limited to toolkit
commands (renumber, merge, delete
etc.) so that any programs developed
will be transportable from machine to
machine, regardless of the cart ridge's
presence.
Technically the cartridge should be
'transparent' to the standard C64 so
that it will rarely have to be removed.
For the same reason the addition of a
reset and cartridge on/off switch is
highly  desirable.
The cartridges we will be looking at
are Freeze Frame, QuiekDisk, t h e
Expert, Power  Cartridge. Wilmot:,
Robcom 50, Action Replay and the
Final Cartridge. There is also a very
special utility which doesn't fall into
the cartridge category, but more o f
that later.
Freeze Frame
Evesham Mic r os  produces Freeze
Frame a n d  QuickDisk a s  separate
units. Freeze Frame is purely a disk or
tape bac k up u t ilit y  a n d ,  a s  t h e
instruction leaﬂet points out, is strictly
lor personal use only. This area ofcart-
ridge usage intensely irritates the soft-
ware manufacturers for some reason
or other. Personally, I t e l  that dual-
deck cassette recorders are responsible
for the majority of back-street piracy
that goes on. What is disturbing is the
fact that European pirates are using
CARTRIDGES
Carte Blanche
The cartridge revolution has saturated the market with
many variations around a theme. Your Commodore
blows the lid off these mysterious little packages.
By Eric Doyle
this kind of disk utility to put gameson
to modem-linked networks. Surely it
would be possible to produce cart-
ridges w i t h  in d iv id u a l id e n t it y
numbers ( lik e  t h e  system w hic h
Commodore's Compunet modems
use) so that the cartridge must be
present when the program is run.
Freeze Frame is  a  very simple
product to use. When the computer is
powered up you are faced with the
Basic instruction screen. Simply by
pressing the return key. the machine
resets into normal power-up mode.
The program to be backed-up is then
loaded and then at a convenient point
the reset button on the cartridge is
pressed and you then choose one of the
three options for a memory save. This
can be in  turbo-disk, turbo-tape or
normal disk format.
The days of the back-up cartridge
are numbered as more and more com-
mercial software checks f o r  copier
cartridges in a similar way as they look
for a disk drive's presence.
QuickDisk
This cartridge does what it claims and
very little more. It provides a fast load
and save facility as well as making
standard disk commands more easily
accessible. T h is  av oids  t h e  us ual
rigmarole of opening and closing ﬁles.
Disk directories c an b e  displayed
directly to the screen without affecting
any program which is  currently in
memory.
Compared to most of the packages
it is  pricey for  what it  does and a
combination o f  Freeze Frame and
Quicknisk would probably make a
more reasonable package.
The Expert
One way to try to defeat the cartridge
beaters is to have a 'soft' cartridge. The
Expert is one such device. It contains
RAM memory which must be booted
up from disk before use. This means
YOUR COMMODORE january 1987
78
that the cartridge can be modernised
easily and cheaply by buying the latest
update disk as and when necessary.
The Expert contains the expected
turbo-disk back-up facility but there is
also a  very useful monitor  whic h
allows you to examine any part of the
computer's memory whatever mode
the computer is in. This means that the
cartridge will still operate even if  the
ROMs are switched out.
Modern cartridges o n ly  us e a
'toehold' of a few bytes of memory so
that they can interrupt the machine's
normal operation on request. Some-
times a  program requires the same
memory bytes for programming space.
This is  why  some things cannot be
saved b y  certain 'har d' cartridges.
With the Expert the toeholds can be
relocated with a simple command to
avoid any clashes with software.
The main disadvantage o f  the
Expert stems fr om its  R A M  based
nature. Occasionally I've found that
the memory can be corrupted so that
the monitor fails to operate correctly.
The only way out of such a problem is
to power down, re-boot the cartridge
and t r y  a g a in .  A l l  v e r y  t i m e
consuming.
Power Cartridge
This is currently one of my favourite
devices for its ease of use and range of
facilities. My  only vague criticism is
the bright red plastic casing which
makes it look a little tacky.
With this unit connected you have
a Basic extension, monitor, back-up
and ﬂexible screen dump facility at
your ﬁngertips.
The high resolutilon screen dumps
can be selected in one of two sizes: A4
format or  postcard size. The dump
uses shading t o  represent different
colours a n d  t h e  pr intout c an b e
reversed to give a 'negative' image if
preferred.

Ultimon
This is a conversion of a utility for the
Atari and is  really just a  program
stored on cartridge. When you switch
the computer on the memory is ﬁlled
from the cartridge and the program is
entered by a SYS command.
The program is  a  disk monitor
which, although sophisticated, is old
fashioned. Although mos t o f  the
external cartridge monitors  d o n ' t
reach the standard o f  this machine,
they do have the advantage of taking
up very little space in the computers
memory.
I found the instruction manual
with t he Ultimon cartridge t o  b e
difﬁcult to follow and gave up when I
found that I couldn't get some of the
commands to work. There are a lot
better monitor cartridges than this and
I suggest you look at Supersoft'sZoom
in preference.
Robcom 50
Although t h e  Robrom cartridge is
dumped into the C64's memory in the
same way as Ultimo)! i t  does take
advantage o f  the autoboot facility.
This brings i n  a  substantial Basic
toolkit and the monitor can be placed
almost anywhere in free R AM by a
simple command.
The cartridge offers a useful range
of t ur bo- dis k  a n d  t u r b o - t a p e
commands. These are backed up by a
very useful tape alignment facility and
an alignment tape is provided with the
package. This is an area all the other
turbo-tape programs ignore and is a
laudable prov is ion k now ing h o w
accurate the azimuth alignment must
be for the successful load.
The disadvantage of both Ultimo?'
and Robcom i s  that any  program
accessing the same area will over-write
the cartridge and a  system crash
results.
Action Replay
This is  a  tur bo back-up cartridge
which also loads normal disk program
tiles at high speed.
What makes this unique is  the
ability t o  back-up multiload games
and to save high resolution screens for
use w i t h  graphic s  programs. I n
addition there is a rudimentary code
inspector.
The inspector lacks a disassembler
or any method of modifying memory
contents, restricting it s  usefulness
considerably.
CARTRIDGES
The Final Cartridge
This is  a  very useful cartridge with
plenty of facilities. Apart from a range
of very useful toolkit commands, there
are turbo-saves, disk commands, high
resolution screen dumps  a n d  a
monitor. Back-ups can be made and
the cartridge also has a sprite killer
which will help you to walk through a
few commercial games without being
zapped by any nasties which appear.
Beyond Cartridges
Of the range I  hav e sampled my
personal favourites were the Final
Cartridge and the Power Cartridge hut
it depends on what you need. When
buying a cartridge I would insist on a
demonstration ﬁrst because they all
represent a  substantial ﬁnanc ial
investment and its better to be safe
than sorry.
My attention has recently been
drawn t o  a  new Evesham Micros
product: Dolphin DOS. This is not a
cartridge but a replacement chip for
the Kernal ROM inside the computer
and a circuit board for the 1541 disk
drive.
This gives the beneﬁt of converting
the 1541 into a pseudo parallel drive.
This means that the normal method of
loading from disk by feeding the byte
contents into the computer in a long
cue (serial load) is replaced by allowing
eight cues to enter simultaneously via
the user port. T he new RO M also
converts t he 6 4  in t o  a  dis k  only
machine s o  pressing SH I F T  a n d
RUN/STOP results in  disk loading
rather than tape load. It' you want to
load a  tape this  can b e done b y
switching out the new ROM and it then
emulates the standard c hip that i t
replaces.
The beneﬁts of this chip have to be
seen t o  b e  believed. A  fas t load
cartridge gives a load speed which is
typically ﬁve times faster than normal.
Dolphin DOS increases this to 20 times
normal!
Taking an example of a 140 block
program. normal loading w ill take
about 80 seconds and fast load will
reduce this to a mere 16 seconds. With
Dolphin the time is four seconds and
you get a good quality monitor too!
Unlike many of the cartridges, the
Dolphin system will load a wider range
of protected commercial disks with no
problem. It is not infallible but for the
awkward disks y ou simply ﬂic k  a
switch and use the machine as  a
standard 64.
Another advantage over cartridge
YOUR COMMODORE january 1987
79
loaders is that the speed also applies to
sequential and relative tiles. The speed
increase is lower but still reaches a
stunning 10 times the normal rate. For
example, loading s omething lik e
SuperS'cript w it h  a  cartridge won't
make a vast amount of difference but
with Dolphin you're up and running in
seconds rather than minutes.
You nev er g e t  something f o r
nothing a n d  t h e  ﬁrs t c atc h w it h
Dolphin is the price tag of around 4:.70
(worth every penny. I may add). The
second problem is  substituting the
ROM. I f  you're lucky your 64 may
have a ROM in a DIE, socket but the
majority of 64s I have seen (and I've
seen a lot) have the ROM soldered on
to the Circuit board. For most people,
even it '  they ar e relatively skilled
electricians, i t  w ill b e  difﬁc ult t o
remove the R O M without causing
damage. I am so impressed with the
performance o f  the system that I ' d
tend to advise removing the old ROM
paying more attention to leaving the
circuit b o a r d  undamaged t h a n
worrying about damaging the ROM.
You won't need it again so why worry!
The DI L socket is then soldered in
place and the chip inserted. If ever you
decide to go back to the old ROM it
will cost about E30 for a new one but I
guarantee that this is worth the risk.
I am not one to rant and rave about
hardware but this is an exceptional
product and I wonder how I used to
manage before.
Although cartridge fast loaders will
not enhance the loading speed further
I've found that they all operate quite
happily with the extended Dolphin chip
switched out and many will continue
to work with it switched in.
Cartridges make great Christmas
presents and I  can think of  nothing
better, except perhaps a Dolphin DOS.

This symbol means that the program is avai table on cassette.
These programs are available on disk.

Please Note
Since the programs supplied on cassette are total working

on tape, There is no sense in placing a program that expects
to be reading from disk on to tape.

ome (if not most) of you will have
S
heard by now of that favourite of all
computer industry subjects. the RS232
communications standard. People
have been known to go weak at the
knees and hide when it is mentioned.
Every day, i t causes problems fo r
computer engineers connecting u p
equipment such a s  printers a n d
modems. It has even given rise to a
lucrative business of building the so-
called "break-out b o x e s " f o r
monitoring and "ﬁxing" RS232 lines.
If it is supposed to be an industry
standard, why does it cause so much
hassle? Every computer manufacturer
has different ideas on how to build a
computer; which devices to use, how
big the screen should be, etc. It would
seem that this train of thought also in-
cludes the RS232 standard.
Now, before I go on. let me say that
the idea behind RS232 is great. A
standard interface f o r  connecting
different types of hardware (including
computers) together. RS232 is really
useful in the ﬁeld of telecommunica-
tions. Modems are usually connected
to a computer via an RS232 link. You
can connect two computers together
and transfer programs between them
(a technique often called "porting").
Unfortunately, things are not this
simple. With different manufacturers
having different ideas on how to imp-
lement the standard (Commodore is
no exception) a great deal of confusion
can arise when two pieces of hardware
are to be connected together. Most of
this confusion surrounds the way in
RS232
Interfacing with
the RS232
Many people switch off when they hear the mention of
the RS232 interface and related subjects. This article is
aimed at clearing up some con fusion and doubt.
By Steve Carrie
which the control lines of an RS232
should be used. Thankfully, this does
not concern us in this article since we
will be using only a  basic RS232
interface.
Basic RS232
As you may know, RS232 uses the
serial method o f data transmission.
Information is sent bit by bit along a
single wire to  a receiving machine.
Since data may ﬂow in both directions,
two wires plus a common return are
required t o  make a  basic RS232
communication line. The lines are
usually connected to equipment by a
25-way D-type connector. D a ta
leaving a computer exits via pin two
and incoming data enters via pin three.
The Ov return is connected to pin
seven. This gives the "3-line" RS232
interface. There is no control over the
ﬂow o f the data in either direction
unless handled by the software (more
on this later), A n  RS232 interface
using more than these three lines is
known as an "X-line" interface.
It is best to use a three or four core
cable with a shield (we will see why in a
moment) rather than separate wires.
For the purposes of this article, this
is all we require. "Ah yes" you say,

"that's a l l  v e r y  w e l l  b u t  m y
Commodore doesn't have a 25-way d-
type connector let alone any RS232
interface". True it doesn't have a 25-
way connector but i t does have an
RS232 interface. You mean you didn't
know'?
Commodore RS232
Since the time of the Vic 20, Com-
modore gas "programmed" in a limited
form of RS232 port. I say programmed
because the hardware device normally
associated with RS232 communica-
tions. the Universal Asynchronous
Receiver/Transmitter (UART), is not
present in the circuitry of the Vic 20,
C64. 64C, C128 and C  128D. The
omission o f  the C I 6 and Plus/4 is
intended. The C I6  cannot handle
RS232 comms (we shall see why in a
moment). The Plus/4 on the other
hand i s  omitted f o r  a  different
reason. This machine DOES have a
UART.
RS232 signals appear at the user
port. This is exactly the reason why the
C16 cannot handle RS232; it does not
have a user port (a strange omission by
Commodore. Anyone know why?). All
the conversion i s handled b y  the
Operating System (Kernel). Thus

Fig 1
(except in the case of the Plus/4) the
user port coupled with the Kernel
becomes almost the equivalent of the
6551 UART (the 6551 is the device that
the software is supposed to emulate).
In the Vic  the user port is con-
trolled b y  a  Vers atile Interface
Adaptor (VIA). In the other machines
a Complex Interface Adaptor (CIA) is
used (not a lot of difference as far as
this article is concerned). Now before
some o f  you r un and hide at the
mention of V I As and ClAs, let me say
that (thankfully) we do not have to
program these devices directly, The
Kernel handles all of the RS232 asso-
ciated programming.

The terminals labelled Sout (trans-
mitted data) and Sin (received data)
and GND (0v common) are the three
lines we need. Note however that there
are TWO terminals labelled Sin. The
reason for this lies with the way in
wrhich the RS232 on these machines
works. One of the Sin lines is for data,
the other is a ﬂag or trigger input.
Because the Commodore RS232 relies
on Non-Maskable Interrupts (NMI) or
interrupt request (IRQ) in the case of
the Plus/4, there must be some form of
detection to let the system know when
data is being received.
When data is being received over
the Sin line, the voltage level on this
pin changes rapidly, causing interrupts
to occur. The system software collects
the data on the Sin line, placing it in an
area o f  memory called the Receive
Buffer. There is also a Transmit buffer
for outgoing data. Thus the reception
and transmission of data is basically
transparent to the user. However, this
method has its problems as we will see.
The practical upshot of all this is that
BOTH S i n  ter minals  m u s t  b e
connected to the Sin line. Since they
are next to one another, this is no great
problem.

(again). I f  you are not too sure about

Commodore (Vic , C64, Plus /4 o r
Cl28) then there is no great problem.
The only thing to watch is that you
must connect the Soul of one machine
to the Sin of the other as in Figure 2 in
order for them to exchange data (a bit
obvious really!).
Commodore connections
If you don't intend connecting your
machine t o  any thing other  t h a n
another Commodore, you can skip the
next bit all together and get on with the
programming. I f  you have a  friend
with one of the machines mentioned,
you will be able to type messages to
one another handy  if  you live next
door and you have a long piece of 3-
core cable — your own mini-network!
(Not recommended if  you live across
the street o r  several houses away!)
How far you will be able to keep the
machines apart depends very much on
the operating conditions. Electrical
interference may  cause errors and
there will come a point where the line is
just too long. It's best to experiment
with what you've got.
Non-Commodore Connections
This is where things get tricky. Con-
necting t o  anything other than a
similarly equipped Commodore has its

problems. T his  i s  because normal
RS232 requires logic levels -I2v (logic
I) and +12v ( logic 0) as opposed to the
Commodore RS232 logic levels of Ov
(logic 0) and +5v (logic I )(No that isn't
a mis-print. RS232 logic is opposite
Voltage level-wise t o  your ('ommo-
dore). However this problem can be
overcome quite easily. There ar e
various l o g i c  dev ic es  av ailable
speciﬁcally for  this purpose. Among
these are the RS423 line driver 3691
and RS423 line receiver 88LSI20N.
These devices convert between T T L
logic levels and RS423 logic levels.
RS423 is  another (stricter) standard
which is  compatible with RS232 (at
least to a certain extent). The beauty of
using these devices is that they will
operate from a +5v/-5v supply, This
means that the user port's +5v output
(pin 2: see Figure I.) may be used for
the +5v supply and all that is required
is a -5v supply. These are the devices
used by the BBC micro for it's RS423
port. F igur e 3  shows t h e  c irc uit
required.
I can hear the groans of discontent.
"I can't do that! I've never built an
electronic circuit before!". I f  you do
have an electronics hobbyist friend, try
bribing him/her into building it for
you.
I will not go into detail over the
construction o f  the interface. I  will
assume that i f  you are building this,
you know what you are doing. The
74LS00 device is used here as a logic
inverter. I  suggest that you use i.e.
sockets so as not to subject the devices
to heat which could damage them.
Power Supplies
If you plan to use the mains (careful!)

and -5v supply circuits so as not to rely

The alternative battery supply cir-
cuit in ﬁgure 5 assumes that you are

puter. This circuit may also be used

shown prevent damage to the circuit if
the battery/adaptor i s  incorrectly

the battery when you are not using the
interface. This has the advantage of
not requiring you t o build a mains
power supply.
Remember t h a t  y o u  c a n n o t
connect a n  ordinary  Commodore
(without this interface) to one using
this circuit. Both machines must be
similarly equipped. Using this inter-
face, you will be able to connect your
Commodore to other computers such
as the BBC and any suitably equipped
IBM compatible. I have connected my
C128 to my Televideo TS1605 (IBM
compatible r unning MSDO S)  a n d
Fig 3
transferred ﬁles between them without
any problems. This should also work
with the Commodore PC I 0 and PC20
IBM compatibles. The only thing to
watch f o r  here is  that most I B M
compatibles need to have pins four and
ﬁve ( R T S  a n d  C T S )  connected
together as shown in Figure 6. The
BBC' will also require a similar con-
nection. Because of RS232 differences
between systems. I cannot say that this
will work with every machine, but it
will wor k  w it h  most. I  have also
connected my 128 up to a mainframe
DECSYSTEM 2050 running at 1200
baud with absolute success.

RS232
OK s o you've got this far. You've
linked your Commodore to another
machine. What now?
Using the RS232 interface on a
Commodore is much the same as using
a printer or a disk drive. You must

the system might hang by attempting
to get input when it isn't there. Also be
aware that on the Vic 20 and C64, the
RS232 receive and transmit buffers are
created at the top of  Basic memory
when the OPEN command is executed.
(The buffers are permanently deﬁned
on the C1,28 and, I think, the Plus/4).

Handshake determines how the
interface will operate. We will be using
3-line. X-line is where you are using
control lines as well as the data lines.
examples. I f  however you have any
problems, t r y  selecting 600 baud
instead.
The command register deﬁnes
other interface parameters as follows
This makes things a bit complex so we
will stick to 3-line.
Duplex should be set to Full. This
determines h o w  th e  receive a n d
transmit will behave.
Parity is a kind o f error check.
When data is received, the system
checks it to see i f it agrees with the
parity. If not, the parity error bit in the
YOUR COMMODORE january 1987
85
variable ST (status) is set indicating
some sort of error. These bits allow
you to set the type o f parity check
required. O f  course, both machines
should be set to the same parity. In
most cases, parity is not used and error
checking is done in a different way
(more on this later).
This may seem a little complex but
it isn't really. Lets suppose that we
want to open an RS232 channel to run
at 1200 baud, eight data bits, one stop
bit, no parity. The OPEN statement
would be:
OPEN 2,2,0,CHRS(24)+CH RS(0)
(non Plus/4)
OPEN 2,2,0,CHRS(24)+CHRS(5)
(Plus/4)
and that is that! Simple, eh? In fact, if
you stick to this particular format of
eight data bits and no parity, you can't
really go wrong. Just change the baud
rate to suit.
Incidentally, the Commodore 64
programmers reference Guide tells
you t h a t  t h e  c o m m a n d
register character is NOT required.
It's probably safer to leave it in. My
C128 sometimes won't work without
it!
Using PRINT# AND GET# we can
write a fairly simple terminal program
running at 1200 baud. Running this on
two machines (assuming i ts tw o
Commodores) you will be able to type
in a message on one keyboard and see
it appear on the other machines dis-
play as well as your own. Figure 7
shows the program while Figure 8

Both programs check ﬁrst for a
character from the RS232 port, If one
is found, it is output to the screen, If
not, the program checks for a key-
board input. If found, the character is
sent to  the screen and also to the
RS232.
Another interesting experiment

Obviously, not many of you have
access to an IBM, but this experiment
does show up one very important
problem with the Commodore's 3-line
RS232 interface. If you take control of
the IB M  using the CTTY COM I
command again and type DIR which is
the MSDOS command to display the
directory, the ﬁrst few lines are printed
normally and then suddenly, there is a
whole lot of garbage. If you slow down
the baud rates to say 300. the problem
RS232
and run it. Now type the following on
the IBM while in DOS:
MODE COM 1: 1200,N,8,1
CITY COM I
(MODE is external so disk containing
the command must be in the default
drive).
This causes the IBM to think that
its input/output device is the RS232
port instead of the console. This has
the very odd effect o f making the
Commodore co n tro l  t h e  I B M !
(although the character sets are dif-
ferent a n d  some o d d  graphics
characters may be printed). To return
control to the IBM console, you must
type CTTY CON on the Commodore.

may disappear. Why does this happen?
Remember what I  said about the
Receive buffer? Well what happens is
that data is received transparently over
the RS232 lines and placed in the
buffer. The buffer ﬁlls up quicker than
Basic can empty it with the result that
the buffer overﬂows and data is lost.
Buffer overﬂow can be detectd by
examining the ST status variable, but
Basic is just too slow and you may still
loose data,

Solutions
There are a few ways of solving this
problem:
I. Use a slower baud rate to let Basic
keep up.
2. Devise some form of software data
ﬂow control.
3. Connect control lines up and use an
x-line interface.
4. Use machine code to process RS232
data.
Option 1  i s  not a  good idea.
Anyone who has used an RS 232 link at
300 baud will know why (yawn!),
Option 2 is better but requires pro-
gramming which we will touch on later
when we discuss ﬁle transfer.
Option 3 is not really practical
here.
Option 4  is probably the best
solution i n  this case, Data can be
removed from the buffer much faster
using machine code and this will be
ﬁne for the speeds at which we will be
working (up to 1200 baud).
A ve ry short machine code
program can be written to handle E he
RS232 interface. The routine that
follows is given in the form of a Basic
loader, Change the variable AD to any
free area in your computer's memory
(the tape buffer is a good place). This
program is for a Cl28 but it should
work o n  any o f  the Commodore
machines discussed.

Table 3
The program uses the kernal
jumptable calls so it should be valid for
all of the machines.
After the machine code has been
placed in memory, the RS232 channel
is opened with a ﬁle number of 2 (the
channel number. I f  you change this

Character set translation
All this should be ﬁne for Commodore
to Commodore communications. I t
will also work with Commodore to
IBM/BBC etc. comms but may yield
strange results, the reason being that
the Commodores do not use standard
ASCII codes. They use what is some-
times called PETSCII, the Commo-
dore PET being the ﬁrst to use it. The
most noticeable effect of this is that
certain characters will appear on the
Commodore's screen a s graphics
characters. The solution to this is to
insert some form of translation table
or routine into the code. Since data

machine code routine called. Now the
RS232 receive buffer does not get a
chance to ﬁll up so no data is lost. The
OPEN statement could be replaced by
the code in Table 4.

Transferring ﬁles via RS232
This is probably the most useful appli-
cation o f  RS232; transferring data
between unalike machines. I t  i s
possible to transfer programs between
two entirely different machines.
When using a 3-line interface, it is
necessary to introduce some form of
protocol into the software at both
ends. This ensures that each machine
understands exactly what the other
intends to do.
A typical protocol exchange would
look like a conversation between the
two machines:
machine I: Are you there?
machine 2: Yes.
machine 1: Requesting data transfer.
machine 2: OK,
machine 1: Transferring data (block of
data sent)
machine 2: Received data.
and so on. The "are you there", "yes"
etc. messages are actually I  byte
control codes. Normal ASCII has 32
control codes (codes 0-31). The actual
usage varies from system to system and
there are one or tvvo protocol stand-
ards. For your own use, you don't have
to follow any set protocol AS LONG
AS BOTH MACHINES ARE USING

THE SAME ONE. Figure 9 gives a list

Note the two marked XON and
XOEF. These you may recognise.
XON/XOFF protocol is useful where
large amounts of continuous data are
being transferred. Th e  receiving
machine can send an XOFF code when
it wants the transmitting machine to
hold o ff sending data, and send an
XON when it wants to resume. This
type of control is often used with dumb
terminals to mainframes.
Another method o f  transferring
data is to send it in blocks of 2-255
characters (usually 128 chars). This
removes the need for XON/X0FE
control because as each block is sent.
the two machines exchange control
codes. This method o f transfer also
allows error checking to be carried out
on the data. One of the most popular
error check methods is the Cyclic
Redundancy Check (CRC). We won't
go into this here as there is no real need
for such a complex check with hard-
wired RS232. CRC is really useful for
Telecommunications via modems.
Phone lines are noisy and data errors
may easily result at high baud rates.
The CRC error check allows the two
machines at either end to check the
data for errors, if an error is found, the
receiving machine requests that the
data is transmitted again.
When sending data using the block
method, the software collects data
bytes into -
Assuming the link is open, the trans-
mitting machine (TM) sends a start-of-
transmission code. Th e  receiving
machine ( R M )  replies w i th  a n
acknowledge code. The TM then sends
a start-of-block code followed by a
data packet followed by an end-of-
block code. The RM replies with an
acknowledge code (assuming the data
was received correctly) and the TM
sends the next block. This continues
unitt all data has been exchanged,
whereupon the TM sends and end-of-
transmission code and the link enters a
wait-state.
The above description does not
conform t o  any standard but will
work. If error checks are included, the
RM could send a data-error code if the
data had been corrupted whereupon
the TM would re-transmit the same
data packet.

The program given in Figure 10
should ru n  o n  any o f  the CBM
machines discussed and is written in
Basic. Since the comms are being con-
trolled by the software, the receive
buffer will not overﬂow. It allows a
user to transfer a data ﬁle from one
machine to another. The link is 1200
baud, eight data bits and no parity. It
should be run on both machines. The
control codes are shown in Table 6.
Note that I'm not using some of
these as they should be used but, as I
said earlier, as long as you stick to the
same protocol o n  both machines,
you'll be OK.

Possible Developments
The example programs I've given here
do not show all o f  what may be
achieved using the RS232 interface. It
is possible (using a special version of
the circuit described earlier) to have
more than two machines running on a
single 3-line RS232 commlink. This
would allow a group o f users (with
special software written in machine
code for maximum speed) to set up a
mini-network. The possiblities are
endless. I hope this article has helped
to fuel your imagination. If you have
any comments or ideas, please write to
me c/o Your Commodore or leave a

D
does not seem to be supporting the C16
and P1us/4 computers a t  a ll,  t he
machines seem t o  be doing surpris-
ingly well. The lact that it was possible
to buy a Pitts/4 for around C80 may
have something to do with this.
Numerous software houses have
now started producing good quality
software for these machines and are
doing very well for themselves, How-
ever. the problem occurs when a CI6
or Plus/4 owner wants to start writing
their own programs. Basic presents no
problems, all the information that you
require can be found in the manuals
accompanying the computer.
Should you want to enter the world
of machine code, and the world o f
professional c omputing then I ' m
afraid that it is a different story, there
isn't much information about.
Anco is hoping to change all of this
with a new book C le5/ Phis 4 Rq'i Tence
BMA . T o  quote the manual: "T he
book contains all the essential inform-
ation that y ou need t o  know when
using y o u r  Plus/4 and C16. All the
important aspects are explained in
detail, the items already covered in the
manual received with the computers
have been omitted. The graphics and
machine language a r e  speciallY
stressed a n d  demonstrated w i  lb
example programs".
So does the book live up to its
introduction?
The b o o k  comprises o f  ﬁv e
chapters each dealing with a speciﬁc

subject. The ﬁrst of these is graphics.
The manual deals with the basics of
graphics so with this little tome it's
straight in with how to POKE graphics
characters on to the screen, complete
with screen memory map of course, an
example of how to POKE characters is
given and the whole section is easily
understood b y  anyone w ho has a
rad i men fa ry k  no w led cc o f  t h e
computers. Following this the chapter
goes on to discuss the possibility of
user-deﬁned character sets, again with
a clearly documented program that re-
deﬁnes a character — it  changes the
sign to a degree symbol.
This chapter, though clear, shows
that the book was probably rushed out
on to the streets as there are quite a
number of mistakes that should have
been caught. For example, if you can
make sense of the following sentence,
which is by  the way, the ﬁrst sentence
in the section dealing with re-deﬁned
characters, you're a better person than
I am: "As  you have already learnt in
chapter 2.1 t h e  easiest a n d  least
memory space consumieccccephics
possibility of the C-16 is the use of the
existing characters,"
But never mind, the rest o f  the
section makes things clear and it is well
worth reading.
Once low resolution graphics are
out of the way, it's on into the world of
high-res graphic s , m u l t i  c o lo u r
graphics  a n d  ex tended- c olour

clear and concise and illustrated well

with a  program, A  machine code

screen with a joystick is given and this
is used to illustrate some of the points.
Soft-scrolling o f  t h e  s c reen
(moving it up one pixel at a time) is
dealt with brieﬂy, though again in
enough detail to give most program-
mers the information that they require
and then it's on to the raster-interrupt.
For those of you not sure what this is
then I suggest that you go and buy the
hook, for those of you that do then you
will be interested to learn that scrolling
the screen is  dealt w ith i n  detail
complete with a program that allows
you to scroll teat on the screen with a
joystick. A l l  programs are given in
both hex-dump format and assembly
code when necessary, this means that
you can read the assembly code to ﬁnd
out what the program is doing.
Music is the heading of the next
chapter. getting your C16 and Plus/4
to play both in  Basic and Machine
code is covered. Firstly we have a Basic
program that shows you just what is
possible from Basic. Following this is a
program illustrating how to make your
computer play  music on interrupts.
This is one instance in the book that I
felt t h a t  t h e  author  c ould hav e
produced a better explanation of the
program and how to use something

similar in your own programs.
The Book then enters the world of
machine code programming. The ﬁrst
section, entitled intr oduc tion t o
Machine Code, tries to teach machine
code in only 13 pages.
realise that this isn't possible and
that whole books have been written on
the subject of machine code. However,
this section is excellent, it probably
won't make anyone a machine code
genius but it  will stop people from
baulking at the sound of the term and
will s h o w  t h e m ,  again thr ough
examples, how to print something to
the screen, how loops work etc.
A full description of the 7501 pro-
cessors commands is given with the
commands in alphabetical order with a
description, their form of addressing,
the assembler format, the number of
bytes i t  occupies and h o w  many
machine cycles it takes to function.
A description on how to use the
computers in-built kernal routines is
given, together with a list of them all.

all being given.
An excellent memory map of the
computers is given, extremely import-
ant if you wish to use machine code.
The map could have done with some
examples o f  how to use the various
addresses to your own beneﬁt as I am
afraid that beginners to machine code
will ﬁnd the function of many of the
addresses totally bafﬂing. The more
experienced programmer w i l l  n o
doubt ﬁnd all of the information that
he requires though and this section will
undoubtedly become one of the most
thumbed in the book. Maps of  the
TED chip and KERNAL jump table
are also given which again will come in
extremely useful,
If you have ever used a C64 then
you will ﬁnd the comparison of  the
memory maps o f  the C I6 and C64
extremely useful, I know I did when I
needed to ﬁnd out where the border
colour was stored on a C16. Its 53280
on the C64 but where on earth is it on a
CI6? This comparison will show you.
The ﬁnal section o f  the book
provides the reader with some machine
code utilities ranging from a joystick
scan routine to an O LD (restoring a
NEWed program) routine. Accom-
panying this article is a sample section
from this chapter of the book, 1 hope
that this gives you a good idea of what
is possible with this book.
Verdict
must admit I have been waiting for a
book like this on the CI6 and Plus/4
ever since the machines were ﬁrst
launched. OK so the book isn't perfect
and there is room for a lot of improve-
ment. However, the book does provide
the advanced programmer with all of
the reference material that he should
ever require.
If you are into serious program-
ming than I would suggest this is one
book that you must go out and buy, it
will become an invaluable, if not the
most im p o r t a n t  b o o k  i n  y o u r
collection.

through computers, it is possible to
achieve a  wide range o f  graphical
effects. As you will appreciate, the ﬁrst
system dev eloped f o r  animation
involved the creation of a number of
similar pictures whic h, when dis -
played in sequence, give an impression
of movement.
Animator allows you t o design,
store and subsequently play back a
sequence of 60 pictures. Depending on
the delay used, the sequence can take
from about two seconds to about 24
seconds.
So that you don't have to mess
about with various utilities, the Ani-
mator program is self contained and
provides options for:
1) Picture creation.
2) Play back of the sequence.
3) Saving and loading o f  ﬁles from
tape or disk.
4) A  character designer.
In order to keep the amount o f
typing to a minimum, I have taken two
actions. Firstly, the package is in two
parts, t h e  editor/animation/data
handling module and the character de-
signer. These modules are almost com-
pletely independent except that:
I) I f  you load and run the editor/ani-
mator module alone, you must not use
the design characters option.
2) The character designer cannot save
or load character ﬁles itself — it relies
on the facilities in the editor/animator
module.
Secondly. 1 have left out a sprite

option. I originally intended to allow
you to overlay animated sprites on top
of the animated backgrounds. I hope,
in the near future, to write a third
module offering this option which will
use ﬁles created by these two modules.
Before I launch forth, let's consider
what you might do with this package.
When writing it, I  had the younger
user in mind. Most children like car-
toons and the ability to easily create
and manipulate animated sequences is
equally appealing. Having said that,
the system is also of use to the more
serious user. It's very handy to be able
to quickly create and mess about with
sequences for use in games. As such, it
provides an ideal test bench.
The modules are given in the two
listings. Once you've typed them in,
SAVE them. To create a stand-alone
program, folloyv these steps:
I) Starting with a reset machine, type
in the line:
10 SYS 2200
2) Input the instructions:
POKE 44,48: POKE 12288.0: NEW
in direct mode.
3) LO AD  and RUN the main module
loader.
4) LO AD  and R U N  the character
designer loader.
5) Input the instruction:
POKE 44,8: PO KE 45.200: PO KE
46,34
in direct mode.
6) SAVE the program.
To ease the use of the program, a
series of menus is used with prompts to
the keys available as required. The
RUN/STOP key is used throughout to
return to the previous menu or to leave
the program.
On running, you will see the main
menu. This gives the options:
F1: Edit mode
F3: Animate mode
F5: Data manipulation
F7: Design characters
Pressing the relevant function key
gives you the next menu.
Edit Mode
The edit menu gives the following
options:
F1: Invert frame (this will only work
properly if  you are using a set of re-
verse ﬁeld characters corresponding to
the normal set in use)
F2: Save frame to RAM.
F3: Scroll mode. This  gives a  sub
menu allowing charcter scrolling in
four directions. The keys U,D.L. and R
perform these tasks.
F4: Recall frame from RAM.
F5: Graphics mode. This gives a sub
menu with the options:
H: Switch to high resolution graphics.
M: Switch to multicolour mode.
E: Switch to extended mode.
I: Change background colour.
YOUR COMMODORE january 1987

2,3,4: Change colour registers.
F6: Jump to next frame.
F7: Toggle key repeat.
F8: Set entire frame to current cursor
colour.
Apart from these keys, there are
controls f o r  drawing t he picture:
Cursor keys, HOME and CLR act as
usual but only within the frame. Con-
trol keys change cursor colours as
usual. Reverse ﬁeld can be toggled as
usual, Press any key to place the rele-
vant character on the current cursor
position in the current cursor colour.
When you save a frame to RAM,
both the characters and the colour of
any frame are saved.
Animate Mode
This mode allows you t o  replay a
speciﬁed sequence o f  frames. T he
menu shows the options:
FI: Set start frame
F3: Set ﬁnish frame
F5: Set delay between frames (I=fast-
est, 255=slowest)
1
Data Mode
This allows the manipulation of data
ﬁles.
The frames are saved in RAM as
sequential blocks of data:
C64 GRAPHICS
2) The bottom few lines show the key
options.
3) In the middle is the edit window.
This shows the shape of the current
character.
4) To the right of the edit window are
shown the colours currently in  the
colour registers. These are shown as
numbers beside a representation ofthe
relevant bit pairs.
5) Below the colours is  a  second
window. On start-up, this is a single
character. This can be expanded to
give a six by six array of characters.
This allows the design of large designs.
The operative keys are:
CIRL-N: This switches on redeﬁned
characters and down loads thc charac-
ter set. You must use this command
before y ou can start work  on new
characters.
+: Move to the next character
—: move to the previous character
M: switch to multi-colour mode
N: switch to high-resolution mode
C: copy the character speciﬁed by the
next key pressed
G: move to the character speciﬁed by
the next key pressed
R: reverse the current character
: ﬂip the current character, left to
right
S: rotate the current character
CTRL-R: switch on key repeat

Character Designer
This module can be used independ-
ently but you will need a machine code
monitor or similar to SAVE or LOAD
the characters. If you use it in this way,
you enter the program by SYS (i704.

should see a cursor ﬂashing in a rec-
tangular area of screen. The prompt
line should show you that you are set
up for screen I. Press F4. The edit area
should be ﬁlled with garbage. You've
just recalled screen I from RAM. Press
shift-CLR followed by F8. This clears
the edit area and sets it's colour to
white (the current colour), Press a few
keys. You should get the character
corresponding t o  the keys pressed.
Press F3 to enter scroll mode. You will
see a prompt line showing which keys
operate. Press a  few and see what
happens. Press RUN/STOP to return
to the edit mode. Press F5 and have a
quick dabble with the colours and

MPS 801 PRINTER
Fresh Chips
O
the MPS 801 printer is the lack of true
descenders. There have been many
programs written t o  overcome this
problem. There have also been many
top quality programs written which
provide the user with the option o f
many different f o n t  styles. (Font
Master is just one which springs to
mind), A l l  these programs have one
thing in common. As  software, the
user has ﬁrst to go through the process
of loading i n  t h e  program, then
selecting a given font from a menu
before getting on with the job in hand.
Printer IV on the other hand has
none of these drawbacks, as hardware.
once the chip has been installed you
just ﬂip a switch and turn it on. The
selected font is now ready to go.
Fitting the chip is simplicity itself.
It only took me three minutes and I am
hopeless with electronics. Instructions
for ﬁtting Printer IV are as follows:
1. Disconnect the printer from the
mains, remove the perspex cover,
paper shelf, and feed knob.
2. Us ing a cross head screwdriver.
remove the four screws holding the
upper housing and the lower housing
together. Lift the top away to expose
the tray holding the electronics. Lift
and remove the tray to the rear of the
printer. Using a ﬂathead screwdriver,
carefully lift out the original character
ROM chip (this is a 24 pin chip).
N.B. Take careful note of the position
of the chip e.g. a small notch at one
end.
3. Take the Printer IV character chip
together with adaptor, and lit this into
the carrier that housed the original
chip (taking note of the position of the
notch i n  the chip which should in
mosdt cases be facing the right of the
printer looking from the front). The ﬂy
lead with the two logic switches can be
placed to suit (I have drilled a small
hole i n  t h e  r ear  o f  the housing,
threaded i t  through and i t  is  now
permanently secure).
4. Re-assemble the printer and you are
ready to use your new character sets.
CAUTION: Opening the printer will

invalidate your warranty if it is still in
force at the time.
There a r e  f o u r  character sets
available to you:

When using a word processor, it is
advisable to use a pause command
before switching between character
sets.

It is inadvisable to switch between
sets w hile t h e  pr inter  is  actually
printing. This  w ill cause corrupted
characters and will also result in  a
blown fuse inside the printer.
I would also advise that you put the
original R O M  c h ip  safely aw ay
somewhere.
For anyone who uses their printer
often this chip is a must. It's quick and
easy t o use and the end results are
impressive.

means that whatever is printed on the
screen can be reproduced exactly on
paper. Permanent copies may  b e
obtained of  just about anything you

modiﬁcations etc.
There are programs around for text

Basic a n d  need t o  as k  t h e  user

text) before they will do a printout.
Enter then, the a ll singing, a ll

gram. This program will check auto-
matically whether upper or lower case
text i s  being displayed and pr int
accordingly. Reversed characters are
also recognised and dealt with by this
program (automatically). There is, of
course, one BUT...but it cannot print
the double quotes symbol. This is due
to an inherent function of the MPS-80 I
printer. When the printer prints an odd
number of double quotes, it starts to
print ASCII tokens for  the printer
control codes used by this program.
The result is  a  totally disorganised
mess, which does not look much like
the original. For this reason the double
quotes symbol will be replaced by a
single quote every time it appears. This
is unfortunate but is the same method
used by the word processor package in
the Plus/4 itself.
While I  am on the had points. I
should als o mention t h a t  custom
characters cannot be dumped from the
text screen, though they can from the
graphics screen. Also, when obtaining

Great care has been taken to make
this program 'invisible' to Basic and its
variables. Once loaded this program
can be considered as one of the com-
puter's functions. It lives and works
between locations $4000 and $467E.
Some o f  the routines used need t o
change values stored in page zero. This
would then upset important vectors
stored in  page zero and cause the
computer to crash. For this reason the
program will store page zero (in its
entirety) in a safe place, before any
damage is done. Page zero is then re-
turned at the end of the program. The

457F- 467E - safe area for temp store

Text Dump
The text dump is basically a code con-
verter. Firstly, all of page zero is stored
in a safe area at $4571
$4284. This will protect all vectors set
up by a Basic program. The contents of
location $FF13 are then checked to see
if the screen in displaying upper or
lower case text. A  channel is then
opened to the printer. The appropriate
font will be selected according to the
contents of $FF13 (ref: pages 40-41 of
the MPS-801 Users/Manual). Loca-
tions $22 and $23 are loaded with the
start address o f  the text screen
($0000). The X-register (row counter)
and the Y-register (column counter on
screen) are both set to zero. Location
$4B is a counter which keeps track of
how many characters are to be sent to
the printer to produce a row of print.
The value stored in $413 will vary
depending o n  how many reversed
characters are to be sent. Every time a
reversed character is to be printed,
three characters have to be sent: RVS
ON, t h e  character, R  VS O F F .
Location $4B is set to zero for each
row being processed, as is the Y-
register.
A problem exists with the text
dump, which is the reason for the
length of the text dump program. The
characters stored i n  te xt screen
memory are stored as screen display
code. Characters to  be sent to the
printer must be sent as ASCII code

Manual). As can be seen from the two
tables i n  the User Manual, each
character has two different values.
Conveniently the characters have been
grouped into sets of 32. It is the order
of the sets that i s different. The
program takes a character from the
text screen memory, and ﬁnds out
which set of 32 it is in (screen display
code).
From this point it is merely a case
of adding a pre-deﬁned number to do
the conversion. The method used to
ﬁnd which set a character is in. is
purely a  case o f  subtraction. The
character value is taken, #$20 subtrac-
ted and accumulator is checked, to see
if it contains a positive number. If it
does contain a positive number then
the character must belong to a higher
group of 32 characters. In this case the
M O  is added back to the number and
the analysis is continued in the same
way by substracting # S40, # $60 and
/480 in that order. Each time, i f the
answer i s  positive, th e  number
subtracted is replaced. When the result
in the accumulator is not positive then
the program has located which block
of 32 the character Ilelongs to. The
program will then add # $60, #140,
#SCO depending whether the character
is in the ﬁrst, second, third or fourth
set of 32 characters respectively.
Example
Assume the character to be processed
is the spade symbol. As can he seen in
the SDC table it has a screen display

However, just before the above
process is executed, the screen display
code currently being processed is
ANDed with #$80. If the result is less
than, or equal to,#87F then the above
process is executed in the normal way.
If however the result is greater than
#$80 then the program realises it is
dealing with a reversed character, so it
stores# $12 in the next free location in
the output buffer ($443D plus the
contents of $48). This sets the printer
up for RVS ON. The value in $48 is
incremented by #$01. The character is

Page zero is restored by the routine at
$4291 and the program returns to Basic
as if nothing had happened.
The program works because each
high resolution image on the screen is
actually made up of 64,000 dots (each
individually selectable) arranged in a
deﬁnite ( though r ather  complex)
pattern. I n  much the same way the
printer produces its images using a
pattern of dots, although the way the
dots are organised is very different.
In essence then, this program must
translate the pattern o f  dots on the
screen, to a pattern recognisable by the
printer, while preserving the image to
be printed.
Because there are 64,000 dots some
or all of which have to be translated
and sent to the printer, it can be seen
that a great deal of processing has to be
done. The programmer/user will want
their printout as quickly as possible (in
business this would be essential - time
is money), so the whole routine has
been written in  machine code. This
gives a considerable time saving over

the equivalent Basic program which
took 25 minutes to produce a single
high-res screen dump. In machine code
this process i s  reduced t o  thr ee
minutes. This is still fairly slow -but is
the maximum speed obtainable using
the MPS-801 printer. The reason for
this is the size o f  the printers input
buffer - 90 bytes. A single row of the
high-res screen uses 320 bytes. In order
for the printer to produce a single row
of the high-res screen its buffer must be
ﬁlled and emptied four times. This

involves reading 90 bytes of translated
data from the computer -  telling the
computer not to send any more data -
printing the 90 bytes now in the input
buffer - request the next 90 bytes and
so on. In other words the printer head
must make four passes for each row of

Budding electronic enthusiasts
may ﬁnd a  way to make the input
buffer larger and so reduce the printing
time, the rest of us will have to wait two
minutes.

The program is stored in RAM
starting a t  location $4105 (16645
decimal) and is protected from Basic
and its variables. When the program is
loaded in to memory an address table
starting a t location $429E (17054
decimal) is also loaded. This address
table contains the start address of each
row on the screen. The program takes
seven o f  these start addresses to
produce the ﬁrst row of print on the
printer. It should be noted that a single
row on the screen is eight dots deep,
the printer can only print seven dots
deep and this is the main reason ﬁr the
address table. The eighth address is
carried forward and used as the ﬁrst
address in the second row.
The program uses these addresses
to look at the screen and decide which
dots are 'ON' and which are 'OFF'.
This process is too complicated to
explain in much detail without writing
a book so an assembler listing has been
included for the inquisitive machine
code programmer.
Brieﬂy!
The main working parts of this pro-
gram are the address table, a set ot
eight 'dummy bytes' which store the
results as they are obtained, the 'result
buffer' which stores the 320 bytes to be
sent to the printer. The dots on the
screen are printed from left to right
(within each byte) on the screen, while
they arc arranged from top to bottom
on the printer (see Figs 1 and 2). Each
byte on the screen represents eight dots
accross the screen, but on the printer
only seven dots down the paper. The
program looks at bit 0 of each byte in
turn on the screen (of which only seven
chosen from the address table are
being processed) to see if it is 'ON' or
'OFF'. I f  the bit is OFF then the
program looks at the same bit in the
next byte. I f  the bit is 'ON' then a
number to the power of two is added to
the appropriate 'dummy byte' (NOTE:
these dummy bytes are always preset
to 0 before processing a set of seven
bytes). The number which is raised to
the power o f two is derived from
whichever of the seven bytes is being
worked upon i.e. i f in the ﬁrst of the
seven bytes then add 210 to the ap-
propriate dummy byte, if in the second
then add 211, the third add 212 and so
on.
The result of all this processing is
eight, seven-bit numbers all less than
or equal to $7f (127). To each of these
PLUS/4 AND MPS 801 1111
numbers the program adds $80 (128).
The ﬁnal eight results are then stored
in the 320 byte buffer located at $443D
(17469).
The program then adds $08 to each
of the seven addresses it took from the
address table and repeats this and the
above process 40 times. It has then
translated the ﬁrst row on the screen.
At this point the 320 bytes of data
that have been processed are now
ready to send to the printer, which it
does. When the printer has done its bit
(remember four passes o f the print
head) the program takes n e x t  seven
addresses from the address table and
repeats the above processes 25 times,
so printing all rows and hence the
entire screen (well, all except the
bottom three dots o f the last row —
which did not justify the extra pro-
gramming required).
The program must now return to
Basic from the same point it left. This
has been achieved by saving ALL of
page zero in a safe area of memory
starting at $457F (17791) before any
translation starts (i.e. at the beginning

of the program). Page zero is then
returned to its rightful place after all
processing is complete (i.e. at the end
of the program). When the RTS in-
struction at the end of the program is
encountered, the program will send the
processor to the point it started before
a printout was requested.
The instructions below seem quite
complicated at ﬁrst, but are really very
simple. The whole program does not
have to  be entered a t one sitting
provided what you have done so far is
saved. If at any time you decide to save
what you have typed, simply execute
the next SAVE routine in the instruc-
tions and make a note of the address
you have reached. At the next sitting
you can reload the program using the
name speciﬁed in the save routine. You
may then carry on as if nothing had
happened starting at the address noted
previously. The ony thing to watch is
to change the ﬁlename of that section
when you need to save it again.
Instructions
NOTE: D o  not deviate from this
sequence, i t can very soon become
confusing otherwise.
1) Refer to the lising •FUNKEY'.
2) Type: MONITOR (return).
3) Type: M 055F (return).
4) Change the values that appear on
the screen, by typing over them to the
values in the listing ‘FUNKEY'. Do
not attempt t o  alter the reversed
characters on the right of each row.
5) Type: S'FUNKEY',n,055F,059F
where n=1 for tape or n
NOTE: The ﬁrst program has been
saved on tape or disk.
6) Refer to the listing 'GRATEX".
7) Type: A 4000 JSR $4284 (return).
8) The screen will now prompt you
with $4003. Type: L D A  $FT13
(return).
9) Continue in this fashion until the
end of the 'GR ATEX' listing.
10) Type: S'Ci R ATEX",n ,4000,429E
where n=1 for tape or n=8 for disk.

II) Refer to the listing 'TABLE'.
12) Type: M 429E (return)
13) Change the values on the screen to
those in the listing 'TABLE' by over-
typing. When the ﬁrst screenful has
been changed then type: M (return) to
obtain the next sereenful. Continue in
this fashion until the end of the listing
'TABLE'.
14) T y p e  S'IABLE',,n,429E,442E
where n=1 for tape or n=8 for disk.
15) Type: L'GRATEX',n (return) n=1

To do this enter the following Basic
commands:
SCRATCH 'G RATEX',D0 (return)
SCRATCH "TABLE',D0 (return)
[Fall has worked out well, you should
now have three programs: 'FUNK EY,
'SUPERDUMP' and 'NEW'.
This program is very simple to use
once loaded. To load the program into
memory follow these instructions:
1) Switch the Plus/4 'OFF' then 'ON'
again. (The best reset known).
2) T y pe: D L O A D ' N E W  (return)
(LOAD for tape) then RUN (return).
3) Type: MONITOR (return).
4) Type: L'FUNKEY',n (return) n=1
for tape or n=8 for disk.
5) Type: L'SUPERDUMF,n (return).
6) Type: X  (return).
The computer is now in Basic and
the Superdump program is in memory.
The superdump may be used in direct
mode or program mode.
Direct Mode
Stop your program when the screen
you want to print is being displayed.
Press Fl for a text dump. Press F4 for a
graphic dump.
That's it the Plus/4 does the rest!
Program Mode
When writing a  program y ou may
decide t h a t  a  screendump option
would be useful. This is very simple to
achieve. S i m p l y  i n c l u d e  t h e
appropriate instruction (below) f o r
your requirement.
TEXT DUMP type: SYS16384
GRAPHIC DUMP type: SYS16645
Again, the computer will do the rest.
1 am sure that this program will be
of very great interest to many people.
This program took me six months to
perfect (spare evenings) and to me at
least, was worth every minute. ' i R

PROGRAMMING
Whether you are entering a program
from a book or magazine or you are
trying to create your own masterpiece
those little bugs always manage to slip
their way into your code somewhere.
So what do you do? Well, the ﬁrst
and most obvious method o f  de-
bugging a program is to sit down and
read it through. Even this isn't infall-
ible, and so I speak from experience,
you check it, your neighbour checks it,
Freddie the family parrot even gets in
one the job. But still the error hides in
their somewhere.
Having d e a l t w i th  people's
programming queries for a number of
years I have noticed a several speciﬁc
programming errors keep rearing their
heads again and again. I  hope this
article will provide some tips that will
help you to  de-hug your programs
more easily.
know it Ali?
Some people think that the computer
is a device that is totally infallible, this
isn't the case. Probably the most
common problem is the fact that the
computer gives you an error in a
certain line number. You go to the line,
check it, check it again and even get
someone else to check it. Don't be
fooled, just because the computer says
that the error is in line X, DON'T
BELIEVE IT. Your problem may be
elsewhere. I shall prove this point in an
example later in this article.
All Blank
Fault Finding
Quite often people will write or type in
a program, RUN it and then ﬁnd they
simply get a blank screen. One of the
most common mistakes here is that
you may not realise that the computer
may be giving you an error report, it's
Entering a program into your computer only to .
it doesn't work is extremely frustrating. Here are a few
tips on some of the most common problems.
By Stuart Cooke
just that you can't see it. A  small
example will illustrate just what I
mean. Type the following into your
cornputer:
10 POKE 53280,0:POKE 53281,0
20 P R IN T " [  BLACK] H E L L O
WORLD"
Line 10 should be replaced with the
following i f using a CIO, Plus/4 or
C128.
10 COLOR 0,1:COLOR 4,1
Don't forget items in square brackets
are mnemonics f o r  Commodore
control codes. Read Listings if you are
not sure about this. [BLACK] means
press the CONTROL &I keys at the
same time,
RUN this program and see what
happens. The program works OK, you
simply can't see the message that is
printed since it is printed on a black
background with black text. Line 10
simply sets the border and screen to
black.
Now this program works without
any problems, but what would happen
If there was an error in there? Let's add
a line to the above example:
30 T H I S  W I L L  C R EATE A N
ERROR
As you are no doubt aware this line
will cause a SYNTAX ERROR when
the program is RUN. Let's RUN it and
see. What happened? Nothing seemed
to happen, your screen is still black.
The error message will be printed out,
you simply can't see it as it is in black
on a black background. If we change
the colour of the text in line 20 then all
should become apparent. Change line
20 to:
20 P R IN T " [ W H I T E ]  H E L L O
WORLD"
YOUR COMMODORE january 1987
109
Remember what I said about square
brackets.
Now RUN the program and you
will see the SYNTAX error message
appear.
You mayu think that this is an
extremely simple error and that every-
one should spot it. It may be simple but
is overlooked surprisingly often.
Cl28 owners have a  further
problem. the FAST command. For
those of you not used to this command
it simply turns off the display of the
C128 which means that the computers
speed will increase. You can still print
to the screen, but you can't see what
you put on it. So what would happen if
the computer came across an error?
You would get the same effect as
above. The error message will be
printed to the screen you just won't be
able to see it. As a general rule of
thumb, when entering a C128 program
omit all FAST statements until you are
sure that the program i s working
correctly. Th e n  p u t  th e  FA S T
statement back in,
If you own a Cl28 then you could
try the following program to demon-
strate this:
10 FAST
20 PRINT "HI THERE !"
30 I'M  GOIN G T O  CAUSE AN
ERROR
Now RUN the program. The program
will print out the message in line 20 and
line 30 will generate an error message,
you simply can't see it.
Enter the following command on
the keyboard. You won't be able to see
it so type carefully:
SLOW
Your screen will now come back on
and you will see both the 'HI THERE!'
and the error message.

So i f  your screen is  blank and
nothing is happening what should you
do?
On a  C l2 8  y ou could ﬁrst tr y
typing SLOW just in case the com-
puter has been put into fast mode. On
other computers, and the Cl28 if the
above fails, try changing the ink colour
to s ee i f  t h e  c urs or re-appears.
CONTROL and a number will do this.
If the cursor does re-appear then you
know that your program has ﬁnished
and printed some sort of message on
the screen, Find out where the colour
of the ink is changed to that of  the
background w it h in  t h e  program,
change it to something else and re-run
the program. You will now see the
message when the program stops.
Illegal What?
Quite o f t e n  pr ogr ams  w i l l  b e
published that contain a lot of DATA
statements, Somewhere w ithin t h e
program this D AT A will be READ
and t h e  v alue then PO KEd in t o
memory. Your Commodore uses this
type of program quite a lot as a way of
getting machine code into memory,
One o f  the most common problems
that people get with these is that, when
the program is  RUN, the computer
responds w i t h  a n  I L L E G A L
QUANTITY ERROR in a certain line.
If you enter the following example I
will show you, as I promised, that the
computer is not always right:
10 FOR COUNT=0 TO 7
20 READ NUM
30 SUM = SUM + NUM
40 POKE 49152 + COUNT N U M
50 NEXT COUNT
60 READ CHECK
70 IF SUM<>CHECK THEN PRINT
"ERROR" ST O P
80 PRINT "FINISHED"
100 D A T A  102,101,103,104,105,106,
107,732
This sort o f  loader is used in Your
Commodore every month. Every line
has a checksum on the end, the total of
the number's that have been read being
worked out in line 30. This is then
compared with the checksum, READ
in line 60 and compared with SUM in
line 70, If they aren't the same then the
computer reports  t h e  er r or  a n d
STOPs.
Let's RUN this program and see
what happens. You should get an error
message ' I L L E G A L  Q U A N T I T Y
ERROR IN LINE 40', Your immedi-
PROGRAMMING
ate reaction is to check line 40. But
there's nothing wrong with this so
what is the problem?
An I L L E G A L  Q U A N T I T Y
ERROR means that a  number has
been used that is too large. So let's
have a look at line 40. In this line was
POKE 49152 +  CO UNT  with the
number that has been READ from the
data statement. The maximum value
that 49152 +  CO UNT can reach is
49152 + 7 (see the For Next loop in the
ﬁrst line) which is  49159. There is
nothing wrong with this so what about
the number that has been read? You
can only POKE a number up to 255
into memory'. W h a t  m u s t  hav e
happened is  that you are trying to
POKE a number greater than 255 into
the computer's memory. If we tell the
computer t o print this number out
when it stops with an error message
our fears will be conﬁrmed, RUN the
program again and then ty pe the
following line when the program stops:
PRINT NUM
The computer should respond with
732. Hence our illegal quantity error.
Yu can only POKE a number up to 255
into memory, remember? So what has
gone wrong? Let's follow the program
through.
Line 10 is a loop that repeats eight
times c o u n t  g o i n g  t h r o u g h
0,1,2,3,4,5,6 and 7.
Line 20 READS the next number from
the data statements.
Line 3 0  adds this  number t o  the
current value of sum.
Line 40 POK Es the value that has been
read into memeory,
line 50 goes back round the loop eight
times,
Line 60 the checksum is read.
Line 70 the sum is compared with the
checksum and the program stops i f
they are not the same.
Line 80 is the end of the program.
So what is our problem? Eight pieces
of D AT A are read, the sum is then
read and the program should end. I f
you take a close look at line 100 you
will see that there are only seven pieces
of data and the check sum. This means
that instead of the last number being
read and PO K Ed into memory the
program READS the checks= and
tries to POKE this into memory giving
you your illegal quantity error. The
number 108 is missing from line MO. In
this ease the fact that a number was
missing from line 100 was easy to spot.
YOUR COMMODORE january 1987
110
After all we only have one line o f
DATA in the program. How would
you cope if there were 600. 700 or more
lines of DATA? How could you ﬁnd
the line where the DATA was missing?
System Variables
The designers o f  the Commodore
series of computers use certain areas of
the computers memor y  t o  h o l d
information about certain things in the
computer. T h e  following memory
locations hold the line number of the
last D AT A statement;
63 & 64 on the C64, C16 and Plus/4
65 & 66 on the C128
The line number o f  the last D AT A
statement can be found by entering the
following line:
PRINT PEEK (63) + 256* PEEK(64)
or
PRINT PEEK (65) + 256* PEEK (66)
on the C128
Re-Run the above program, when the
computer s tops  w i t h  t h e  e r r o r
message try the PEEK and you will
ﬁnd that the number 100 is printed -
the line where the error is. So now you
can ﬁnd where in your program the
computer is READing D AT A from
even if there are hundreds of lines.
Correct Version?
Let's correct the above program and
see if  it works. Re-enter line 100 to
read:
100 D A T A  102,101.103,104,105,106.
107,108,732
RUN the program again and all is well.
or is it? The computer comes up with
FINISHED and no error messages are
printed so everything shoudl be OK.
Well I'm afraid that it isn't.
Adding Up
The main failing o f  this  ty pe o f
program is that the check on each line
is simply a sum of all of the numbers.
Therefore 3+2+1 would give you a
checksum o f  six. However 2+3+1
would also give you six even though
the numbers are not in the correct
order. If these numbers were part of a
machine code program, the fact that
they could be in the incorrect order
may cause the program not to work
correctly o r  even crash, The golden

rule here is simply 'D o not assume
everything i s  correct even i f  the
computer says it is'. To prove my point
the above program still has a fault.
Line 100 should read:
100 DAT A 101,102,103 etc.
However it actually reads:
100 DAT A 102,101.103 etc.
The sum o f  the D AT A may be the
Arne but in machine code the two lines
would mean something very different.
So if  your program doesn't work
then CHECK THE DATA.
Trivial?
You may  think  that the above is
simple, w e ll i t  is . However, since
around 907:: o f  the program queries
that we get in the Your Commodore
ofﬁce are due t o  one o f  the above
faults, it's  obvious that the simple
things are quite often overlooked.

high quality  programs that are o f
beneﬁt to as many people as possible.
This gener ally  means  t h a t  t h e
programs are usually very large and
often prone to typing errors. In order
to make your life easier we are starting
a 'Bug Finding Service'. I f  you have
typed in  one o f  our programs and
despite much checking still can't get
the program to work then send to us
the following:
Two copies of your program on tape or
disk
A description of what your problem is
If possible, a listing of your work (can
be omitted.)
A stamped, self addressed envelope for
return of program to you.
Should any of the above be missing
then we will not be able to deal with
your query.
We will try to point out where you
have made any errors and place a
corrected copy of the program back on
to your tape or disk before we return it
to you.
Do not send a program to us as
soon as it  stops working, check i t

having problems running the CI6 Sound Sampler printed in
our November 1986 issue.
Two problems have come to light, the ﬁrst is that people
don't understand how the programs work, the other is that it
doesn't seem to work on all machines.
If you make the changes below and follow the instruc-
tions then you should have no problems using the program,
I) LO AD and RUN RELOCATE.
2) LO AD SAMPLER PT I and RUN it.
3) When ﬁnished, this will SAVE a new program with the
name 'SAMPLER • to disk or tape.
4) When this is ﬁnished turn the machine off and on and then
LO AD SAMPLER P12 and RUN it.
5) This will then create a ﬁle called SCRN on disk or tape.
6) Turn your machine off and on. Now LOAD SAMPLER
and RUN it, this will then LO AD SCRN and the program
will work.
I hope that this solves all of your problems.
