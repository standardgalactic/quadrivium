This book would not have been possible without the support of my
parents. It was their encouragement and unwavering help through
the challenging times that was crucial. It was my wife, Madhavi,
who encouraged me to accept the challenge of writing this book.
Managing the writing as well as the office job was certainly not easy,
but she endured my working late nights and weekends for all these
months. I simply wouldn't have been able to proceed without her
understanding. I dedicate this book to her.

PeopleSoft Financials
Fundamentals
Before we delve into studying the PeopleSoft Financials applications, we need to
understand that it is primarily an ERP application, meant to be used as a transaction
processing system. Its core philosophy is driven by the need to record, process, and
report accounting transactions of an organization.
In this chapter, we'll establish the understanding of core concepts of PeopleSoft
applications—such as Chart of Accounts, Business units, SetIDs, Banks, User
preferences, and related configurations. We'll also learn how to use an important tool
known as Setup Manager, which is  used in implementing PeopleSoft applications.
Note that these concepts are not related to a specific module and serve as the
foundation for all subsequent modules in this book. A PeopleSoft Financials
practitioner must understand these aspects to be able to successfully maintain 
and implement the applications.
This book relates to the version 9.1 of PeopleSoft applications. As a result, the
concepts and screenshots in this book refer to the version 9.1. Some of the screens
and basic concepts may be similar to previous PeopleSoft versions.

PeopleSoft Financials Fundamentals

Understanding Chart of Accounts and
chartfields
Any accounting system (be it manual or automated) is built on a structure that
determines how the accounting information is recorded (and ultimately reported).
Each organization determines the best possible way to capture and classify the vast
number of accounting transactions that take place every day. This decision  
is a combination of two distinct factors:
• 
The need to report the accounting data by various important parameters 
• 
Feasibility and ease of recording the accounting transactions
Let's take a very simple example to better understand this.
Global Vehicles Inc. is an automobile manufacturer, selling vehicles such as
passenger cars, commercial vehicles as well as scooters. Its operations are spread
across multiple countries. Let's say that its annual sales from all its vehicles are $100
million. The key challenge is to know where exactly these dollars are coming from.
Implementation challenge
Design an accounting system for Global Vehicles, so that it can answer questions 
like the following:
Which country is contributing the most to Global Vehicle's sales?
Which product family is lagging in terms of revenues?
What were the sales of passenger cars in USA?
Which is the best selling scooter model in terms of revenue?
Did you say, "Just make sure that you record all required pieces of information when
each vehicle sale takes place"? You are absolutely right if you did!
One way of recording the sale transactions can be recording the Continent, Country,
Product line, Vehicle model, and Sale Price. Thus, its sales data for January 2011
may look something like this:
•

As you can see, one can certainly answer the above questions if your accounting
system can record all these attributes for each transaction.
Now let's go one step further. Say Global Vehicles has about 100 dealerships in
the USA and wants to know the sales performance for each dealership. How can
we address this additional requirement? Simple, by recording the dealership as an
additional attribute for all the sales transactions.
You probably realize now that designing the structure of accounting information to
be recorded is driven by how you wish to use the data. This structure (collection of
all required attributes) is known as the Chart of Accounts (COA). All the attributes
in COA are termed Chartfields in PeopleSoft parlance. 
You would also be able to appreciate that the number of chartfields that an
organization needs, depends on its business requirements. Having few chartfields
will make the recording process simpler, but will not offer much insight into the
recorded accounting data. On the other hand, having more chartfields will give a
more meaningful picture of the accounting transactions, but at the cost of system
performance. A PeopleSoft practitioner needs to balance an organization's reporting
requirements and ease of use before recommending appropriate Chart of Accounts.

chartfield has to be used only to record corporate accounts used in accounting.
However, there are no limitations on the use of other chartfields. Thus, it is not
necessary that the Product chartfield has to be used to record a product. You can
very well use it to record any attribute such as 'Country' or 'Continent' in the COA
example discussed earlier.
Chartfield configuration
As you can see, the given set of PeopleSoft chartfields may not really satisfy the
organization's implementation requirements. This can be due to following factors:
Delivered chartfield names cannot be used
You may not need all of the given 25 chartfields
Given chartfields are not sufficient and you need to add additional
chartfields (although this is highly unlikely)
To achieve this, you need to perform chartfield configuration activities.

Expert tip: 
As far as the number of required chartfields is concerned, always
think of your system's future requirements. Remember, it is extremely
complicated to add a new chartfield to the COA if the system already
has data using the old COA. If you think there is a possibility of new
chartfield requirements down the line, include them in your COA even
if you may not use them. You can simply keep it blank until the time it
is needed.
Standard chartfield configuration
The following operations can be performed on PeopleSoft delivered chartfields using
standard configuration:
Changing the display order of chartfields on pages and reports.
Relabeling long and short names (descriptions) of chartfields.
Deactivating or activating chartfields.
Changing the display length of chartfields on pages and reports.
Changing Related chartfields for IntraUnit Affiliate chartfields.

The next screenshot shows a part of the bottom half of the page:
In the COA example for Global Vehicles discussed earlier, we need to record 
the following attributes: Continent, Country, Product Line, and Model. Also, we
anticipate that a new chartfield may be required in future to record 'Dealership'.
Thus we need five chartfields for the COA (in addition to the Account chartfield). 
As you can see, PeopleSoft doesn't offer any chartfield by these names.
Therefore, we need to perform the following configuration activities: 
Ensure that necessary chartfields are activated
Deactivate those chartfields that are not required
Relabel the active chartfields to reflect actual intended usage

we need to relabel the Operating Unit chartfield as Continent as shown in
the following screenshot:
• 
Change display length of any chartfield in the Display Length column as
required (provided it is not greater than original chartfield length).
• 
Once configuration activities are complete, click Preview button to see what

Expert tip: 
Advanced chartfield configuration is not advised by PeopleSoft.
Always try to achieve the desired result by its corresponding action in
standard configuration.
Activate an inactive ChartField instead of adding a new ChartField.
Inactivate a ChartField instead of deleting it.
Change the display length rather than the actual field length when
reducing the size of a ChartField.
Relabel a ChartField instead of renaming it.
Understanding Business Units and SetID
An ERP system like PeopleSoft financial applications needs to record and store
enormous amounts of data. We need to understand the types of data that the system
generates before getting into how it is done. Business Units and SetID form the basic
structure of how the system records and accesses this data.
In PeopleSoft architecture, the data are categorized into the following two types:
Transaction data: These are the data elements that are generated due to
regular business transactions. For example, an organization like Global
Vehicles may create a purchase order for one of its suppliers to buy tires for
its vehicles, create a vendor invoice (also known as voucher) to acknowledge
that it needs to pay its supplier for received goods or issue a sales invoice
when a vehicle is sold.
As you can see, amount of transaction data in a table that stores them, will
keep on changing frequently as new transactions take place.
Master (Setup) data: These are the data elements that are needed to enable
the system to perform its business transactions. For example, Global Vehicles
may have a group of vendors from whom it buys components for its vehicles.
It also may have a group of banks where it holds its bank accounts for its
financial transactions.
What key differences do you see between such master data and the transaction 
data elements?
The first (and somewhat obvious) is the dynamic nature of transaction data. As we
saw earlier, the number of sales invoices will always keep changing from day to day.
On the other hand, how frequently can we expect changes in the number of vendors?
True, there will be additions or deletions of vendors, but these changes will be far
less compared to transaction data.
•
•

Chapter 1
[ 17 ]
The second difference relates to the purpose of these types of data. Master data is
needed to perform regular business transactions. For example, a vendor needs to be
set up in the system before we can create a purchase order (a business transaction) 
to buy something from it. Similarly, we need to set up rules to calculate discount
before we can create a sales invoice and decide how much discount can be given  
to a customer.
The third key difference lies in the way these data elements can be shared or need to
be separated from each other. Let's assume that Global Vehicles' business has been
structured by geography. Thus, it has following operating divisions: North America,
Europe, and Asia.
Now let's consider the master data first. Is it possible that all these divisions can have
a common vendor or bank? The answer is yes—a single vendor can sell car seats or
tires to all the divisions. Similarly, a bank with a global presence can offer banking
services to all these divisions. Thus, theoretically, master data can be shared by
various groups within the organizations. Note that the master data doesn't always
have to be shared, but can be if needed.
Let's consider the transaction data now. When the European division sells a car,
can this transaction (sales invoice) be claimed (in other words, shared) by other
divisions? The answer is no—the system must segregate sales invoices of Europe
from those of North America and Asia divisions, in order to keep a track of them 
and ultimately report on the sales performance of each.
Thus, while master data can be shared, transaction data belonging to organizational
units must be segregated by the system.
Business Unit
In PeopleSoft parlance, Business Unit is the organizational unit. It can be any entity
that needs to maintain its account balances separately from each other for reporting.
In the previous examples, we can say that Europe, North America, and Asia will be
the business units of the organization.
However, if Global Vehicles wants to be structured by its line of business, we can
create the following Business Units: Passenger car, Commercial vehicles, and Two
wheelers. Note that transaction data tables will always have Business Unit as their
primary key (to identify where they belong to). In other words, sales invoices,
purchase orders, accounting journals, and so on are segregated by the Business Unit.
Business Unit configuration needs to be done for each module that is to be
implemented. For example, to implement Accounts Payable and General Ledger
modules, the Passenger Car BU needs to be configured for both the modules.

PeopleSoft Financials Fundamentals
[ 18 ]
PeopleSoft recommends using BU names that are five characters
long. Any BU names having less than five characters can affect the
system performance.
Tableset ID
Tableset ID (or SetID, as it is commonly known) is used to segregate the master
data. Depending on how we want to group the master data, an appropriate number
of SetIDs are created. It is the SetID that determines which Business Unit can access
which master data elements. This is a two step process:
1. Create SetIDs and group master data elements.
2. Associate a Business Unit with an appropriate SetID to control which master
data elements it can access.
Scenario 1
Assume that there are five suppliers (or vendors in PeopleSoft terms) for Global
Vehicles. All these vendors need to be used by all its Business Units.
As all the master data elements (vendors) are going to be used by everybody, there is
a need for only a single group (SetID) of vendors. Let's call this SetID 'GLOVH'. The
Vendor table will contain the data as follows:
SetID (Primary Key) 
Vendor ID
GLOVH 
VENDOR1
GLOVH
VENDOR2
GLOVH
VENDOR3
GLOVH
VENDOR4
GLOVH
VENDOR5
SetID names should be only five characters long.
Now, we need to specify which rows of master data can be accessed by each 
Business Unit.

Chapter 1
[ 19 ]
Business Unit
Master data table
SetID to be accessed
Passanger Car
VENDOR
GLOVH
Commercial Vehicles
VENDOR
GLOVH
Two wheelers
VENDOR
GLOVH
Thus, each BU can now access master data defined under 'GLOVH' SetID from the
Vendor table.
Scenario 2
Vendors 1 and 2 should be accessible only by Passenger Car BU, Vendors 3 and 4
should be accessible only by the Commercial Vehicles BU, while Two wheelers BU
should have access only to Vendor 5.
Now we need three distinct groups of vendors. In other words, we need three SetIDs.
Let's see how the data will be grouped in the Vendor table:
SetID (Primary Key) 
Vendor ID
GROUP1 
VENDOR1
GROUP1
VENDOR2
GROUP2
VENDOR3
GROUP2
VENDOR4
GROUP3
VENDOR5
And finally, let's specify which BU can access which data rows under Vendor table:
Business Unit 
Master data table
SetID to be accessed
Passanger car
VENDOR
GROUP1
Commercial vehicles
VENDOR
GROUP2
Two wheelers
VENDOR
GROUP3

The next screenshot shows the TableSet ID page, where we need to configure the 
new value:
Configuring TableSet Control
TableSet Control determines which master data rows can be accessed by a BU. 
We saw how to do this in the previous illustration. In reality, due to the very high
number of data tables, this access is given for a group of tables, rather than a single
data table. Let's take a look at how this is configured.
Follow this navigation to configure Tableset Control:
PeopleTools | Utilities | Administration | TableSet Control
The next screenshot shows the TableSet Control page for a Business Unit US001:

Chapter 1
[ 21 ]
As you can see, the BU US001 can access all master data rows defined under SetID
GLOVH in the group of records AM_19. Note that this record group contains the
Vendor table among others. For other record groups, US001 will be to access master
data values defined under a different SetID called SHARE.
Understanding accounting structure—
Ledgers and Journals
The following illustration depicts a high level view of accounting entry creation and
processing in PeopleSoft financial applications:
As you can observe, this illustration gives an overview of how different modules,
such as Billing, Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable, Asset Management,
Expenses (also known as sub-modules or sub-systems) are integrated with General
Ledger module. Each module creates accounting entries for business transactions
that take place. For example, the Billing module creates accounting entries for sales
invoices for customers; the Asset Management module creates accounting entries
for fixed asset addition and depreciation activities, while the Expenses module
creates accounting entries for each employee expense report that is processed. Note
that these are just a few sample examples. We'll discuss the details of business
transactions in respective chapters.
Once the accounting entries are created by a module, a batch process known as
'Journal Generator' performs subsequent activities. Note that Journal Generator
process can create accounting journals from accounting entries generated by external
non-PeopleSoft systems as well. It performs three critical tasks as part of the journal
processing lifecycle:

PeopleSoft Financials Fundamentals
[ 22 ]
Journal creation: Journal Generator process transforms these accounting
entries into 'Journals'. A journal can be considered as a collection and
summarized form of multiple accounting entries.
Journal edit: This process validates created journals based on the validation
criteria to ensure that there are no accounting errors. If any errors are found,
those journals are accordingly marked. They can be processed further only
after their errors are manually resolved. Successfully validated journals are
eligible for posting.
Journal posting: This process ensures that amounts in the journals are posted
to appropriate General Ledger accounts. In other words, the Journal Post
process updates the final account balances in General Ledger. These final
account balances are then reported through financial statements such as
Income statement and Balance sheet by the organization.
Let's consider a simple example to understand this process. Assume that an
organization uses following accounts with hypothetical General Ledger balances:
Account
Description 
Balance Type
Balance Amount
100000
Trade Receivables
Debit
$50000
200000
Customer sales
Credit
-$150000
'DR' denotes a 'Debit' transaction, while 'CR' denotes a 'Credit'
transaction. PeopleSoft applications always denote credit amounts by
a negative sign.
Now let's say that 4 new sales invoices – for $1000, $1500, $2000 and $2500 - are
created in the Billing module on a particular day. As part of the invoice processing,
the following accounting entries are created:
Invoice ID
Type
Account
Amount
INVOICE1
DR
100000
$1000
CR
200000
- $1000
INVOICE2
DR
100000
$1500
CR
200000
- $1500
INVOICE3
DR
100000
$2000
CR
200000
- $2000
INVOICE4
DR
100000
$2500
CR
200000
- $2500
•
•
•

Chapter 1
[ 23 ]
Each PeopleSoft module has a dedicated table to store these accounting entries. For
Billing, above entries are stored in a table 'BI_ACCT_ENTRY'. Now these entries are
ready to be processed by the Journal Generator process.
These entries are then consolidated into a journal as follows:
Journal ID
Type
Account
Amount
JOURNAL1
DR
100000
$7000
CR
200000
- $7000
Let's assume that the Journal edit process successfully validates this journal by
ensuring that debit and credit totals in the journal are equal. If successfully validated,
it marks the journal to be picked by the Journal Post process. Now the Journal Post
process picks up this journal and posts these amounts to the appropriate accounts in
General Ledger.
Thus, after this journal is posted, the final account balances will be updated 
as follows:
Account
Description
Balance type
Balance amount
100000
Trade Receivables
Debit
$57000 (50000+7000)
200000
Customer sales
Credit
-$157000 (150000+7000)

As discussed earlier, PeopleSoft ledgers record posted net balances for a set
of chartfield values (depending on how many chartfields are activated in the
configuration) for each accounting period (such as month) and fiscal year. 
A Ledger Template can be considered to be a framework of a ledger's attributes.
Rather than using a ledger template for an individual ledger, it is linked to a 
Ledger Group. As a result, a ledger template applies to all the ledgers in a group. 
It essentially specifies various records and fields for a ledger that the system needs 
to report from. 
Usually multiple ledgers are clubbed in a Ledger Group. We'll discuss the need for
having multiple ledgers in a ledger group in the chapter for General Ledger. For the
time being, let's just note that a ledger group can have one primary ledger and  
(if needed) up to nine secondary ledgers. 
Configuring ledger templates
Follow this navigation to configure ledger templates: 
General Ledger | Ledgers | Templates
The following screenshot shows a part of the Ledger Template page.

Chapter 1
[ 25 ]
The following  screenshot shows the remaining bottom portion of the Ledger
Template page:
PeopleSoft delivers several default ledger templates (such as Commitment control
ledgers, Standard ledgers, Average Daily Balance ledgers, and so on).
The preceding screenshot shows the ledger template used for standard detail
ledgers. Each field in this screen refers to a table used for a specific purpose. Most of
the fields in this definition here are used by background processes and do not affect
the user transactions.
For a typical implementation, you need not change these default templates.
However, we'll discuss a few important fields:
Record (Table) Name: This critical table stores the final chartfield
combination balances for the posted transactions. For standard ledgers,
this table is 'LEDGER'.
Account Chartfield: This table stores the values for the 'Account' chartfield.
For standard PeopleSoft applications, it is GL_ACCOUNT_TBL.
Combo Data: This table stores the data used in determining whether a given
combination of chartfield values is valid. In PeopleSoft terminology, this is
known as 'Chartfield Combination Editing'. For standard ledgers, this table is
COMBO_DATA_TBL.
Journal Line: This table stores the detailed journal line information for the
journals. For standard ledgers, this table is JRNL_LN.

Expert tip:
The given tables are extremely important in the sense that majority 
of General Ledger processing is based on them. These tables are used
by various batch processes; hence such changes have a large impact
requiring many code changes. To the extent possible, avoid making
changes to delivered table values. Any changes to the delivered table
values in ledger template need to be very carefully analyzed. In the rare
event that these values are changed, all the journal processes need to be
thoroughly tested to ensure that they are not impacted by these changes.
Closing Record Names: These fields specify the tables used in the closing
process. The General Ledger chapter will discuss this process in detail.
Multicurrency Record Names: These fields specify the tables used in the
multicurrency processing. 
ADB Record Names: These fields specify the tables used in the Average
Daily Balancing processing. 
Ledger Loader Record Names: While ledgers can be configured from the
online pages (as we will shortly see), they can also be loaded from external
non-PeopleSoft systems. These fields specify the tables used during the
external ledger load process.
Click the Field Definitions tab to see default field values populated by the 
system. These defaults are dependent upon the Default Ledger Type value 
in the previous tab.

Account: Denotes the field name used for the 'Account' chartfield.
Monetary Amount: A journal line may contain amounts in two different
currencies - Base currency of a Business Unit and Foreign currency
(Transaction currency). This field stores the monetary amount in the 
base currency.
Posted Total Amount: This field stores the net balance amount for posted
transactions of a chartfield combination.
Combination Edit Template: This field is mandatory for the Journal Edit
process we discussed earlier. A value JOURNALS must be selected.
Implementation challenge
Corporate headquarters of Global Vehicles Inc. is located in the USA. Design a ledger
structure to maintain its accounts and report the financial statements in USD. At the
same time, it should be able to maintain all accounts in Euros and British Pounds
(GBP) for internal reporting. 
Solution
For the sake of simplification, we'll assume that COA for reporting in all currencies is
the same. This can be achieved by maintaining three separate ledgers – one for USD
balances, one for GBP balances and another for Euro balances. PeopleSoft General
Ledger allows this flexibility to automatically post the journals simultaneously to
multiple ledgers. We'll configure these three ledgers (named GLOBALUSD, GLOBALGBP,
and GLOBALEUR respectively) and include them in a ledger group for the business
unit. Let's see how to do it.

PeopleSoft Financials Fundamentals

Note that ledgers being master data elements (which can be shared
by different Business Units) are defined by SetID. As we discussed
earlier, a ledger needs to be linked to a ledger template. Thus, it
inherits all the attributes that are defined for a ledger template. 
Now our ledger is almost ready to start recording the accounting balances. The
system knows which database tables and fields to refer to in order to update data
from journals or retrieve data for reporting…all courtesy of the ledger template!
Configuring ledger groups
Follow this navigation to configure ledger groups: 
General Ledger | Ledgers | Ledger groups
Ledger group configuration serves multiple objectives: Grouping multiple ledgers
in a similar group (we'll see why we need to do this), specifying the edit tables for
the relevant chartfields being used in the ledger, and specifying chartfield balancing
options. Let's see each of these important functions in detail now.
We'll call our ledger group GLOBAL.
The Definition tab in the following screenshot , is where we can include multiple
ledgers in a group:
We already saw why we need three different ledgers—to address different currency
reporting requirements.

Chapter 1
[ 29 ]
Having multiple currency requirements is just one of the possible reasons we need
to define multiple ledgers in a group. Commitment control ledgers groups typically
have multiple ledgers. We'll discuss them in detail in the Chapter 9, PeopleSoft
Commitment Control. 
When there are multiple ledgers in a ledger group, one ledger needs to be designated
as the primary ledger, while the others are designated as secondary ledgers.
PeopleSoft allows up to nine secondary ledgers in a ledger group. In other words,
there can be a maximum of 10 ledgers in a group. Remember, it is not mandatory 
to always define secondary ledgers. If an organization has very straightforward
reporting requirements, they can be addressed by a single primary ledger. 
Now let's discuss the important fields that you see on the Definition tab:
Ledger Template: As discussed earlier, assign a ledger template to the ledger
group so that all its ledgers inherit the template properties.
Keep Ledgers in Sync: This checkbox serves a very important function. 
If it is checked, the system ensures that journal transactions are posted
automatically to all the ledgers in the ledger group. For example, for our
ledger group, when a journal entry is created, the Journal Edit process posts
it to all the ledgers (GLOBALUSD, GLOBALEUR and GLOBALGBP). 
Ledger: Specify the ledger name that needs to be included in this 
ledger group.
Primary: Specify which ledger in this group is the primary ledger by
checking this flag.
Translation: This checkbox determines if a ledger needs to be used by the
currency translation process. 
Base Currency: Specify the base currency for each ledger.
Inherit Base Currency: If we check this flag, the 'Base Currency' field is no
longer available. This forces the base currency for each ledger to be the same
as that of General Ledger BU.

The following screenshot shows the Chartfield tab. It is used to specify the edit tables
for each chartfield being used by this ledger group:
View – No Effective Date: This field specifies the prompt table used for
reporting prompts. Based on an organization's requirements, we can change
it if needed. It'll determine which chartfield values are available for users.
The next tab on this page - Balancing - in the following screenshot, determines how
the accounting entries are balanced: 
Let's first understand the concept of balancing.
•

Chapter 1
[ 31 ]
A sample journal entry looks something like this:
BU
Account
Dept
Op Unit
Product
DR/CR
Amount
US001
123000
455
CPG
INT40
DR
$4500
US001
258000
155
TAX
INT40
DR
$1500
US001
215000
455
CPG
INT40
CR
-$6000
What is the most obvious thing about this accounting entry? Of course, the sum of
debit and credit lines is equal. In other words, it is 'balanced'. Now can you say that
debit and credit amounts are equal for each of the chartfields?
For BU US001 and Product value INT40, this is true. On the other hand, for Account,
Department, and Operating Unit, accounting entries are not balanced. 
Note that, no matter what happens, accounting entries have to be balanced for
each Business Unit. However, if an organization maintains its balances for each
Department or Operating Unit (or any other chartfield), then account balances have
to be balanced for that chartfield as well. 
The Balancing tab determines the chartfields by which the accounting entries must
balance. Business Unit is always selected, while Account and Alternate Account are
always excluded from balanced chartfields (in accounting terms, as an account can
have only debit or credit balance, entries can never balance for an account). If an
organization requires that, its entries should be balanced by additional chartfields,
(Operating Unit, for example) the Balance checkbox should be selected for that
chartfield. This is necessary when reporting needs to be performed by the 
Operating Unit.
The Journal Edit process ensures that for any journal, its accounting entries are
balanced by the chartfields specified here. So, in the previous example (with entries
balanced by BU and Operating Unit), our sample accounting entry would have been
flagged as invalid since Operating Unit is not in balance. 
Configuring ledgers for a Business Unit
Now that we have built the basic accounting structure in terms of ledgers, ledger
groups, and templates, our PeopleSoft system is ready to record accounting balances.
The last step is to link required ledgers to a General Ledger Business Unit. 

PeopleSoft Financials Fundamentals
[ 32 ]
Note that a GL BU can not only have multiple ledgers (or ledger groups) associated
with it, but it can also have ledgers belonging to different types. It is possible that 
a BU may need to have a ledger group to maintain its budgets, another to record 
its accounting transactions. It also may have 2 different ledger groups to record
transactions in different currencies. How many ledgers (and what types) are needed by
a BU is entirely driven by the organization's processing and reporting requirements.
In addition to assigning ledgers/ledger groups to a GL BU, we also configure
various processing options.
Follow the navigation to assign ledgers for a BU: 
Set Up Financials/Supply Chain | Business Unit Related | General Ledger |
Ledgers For a Unit
The following screenshot shows the Definition tab of the page. This is where we
select ledgers/ledger groups for a BU: 
There are three types of ledgers that can be selected here: Detail ledgers, Summary
ledger, and Commitment control ledger. In a nutshell, detail ledgers are used to
record actual accounting transactions. Summary ledgers on the other hand record
only summarized versions of detailed accounting transactions. Commitment control
ledgers record control budgets. We'll discuss the commitment control in greater
details in Chapter 9, PeopleSoft Commitment Control.

Chapter 1
[ 33 ]
Let's discuss some of the important fields in this tab:
Ledger Type: If Detail ledger is selected, only a Ledger Group field becomes
available. If Summary ledger is selected, a Ledger field becomes available.
Balanced Ledger: Select this checkbox to force the ledger to be balanced. As
we saw earlier, this means that the system will ensure that credit and debit
balances posted to this ledger group are equal.
Journal Generator Default: Select this checkbox to make this ledger group
the default for given BU. When Journal Generator creates journals from other
sub-modules, it looks for the ledger group value on each accounting entry
line. This value determines the ledger group where that entry will be posted.
In case this value is missing on the accounting entry, Journal Generator will
post it to the ledger group with this checkbox selected.
The following screenshot shows the next Journal Edit Options tab. This tab specifies
how journal errors should be handled by the system:
Available error processing options are as follows:
Default to Higher Level Value: If this journal error is encountered, look at
the processing option defined for the GL BU.
Suspend: Post the error amount or the amount needed to bring journals
in balance to suspense account (specified using Suspense Chartfields
hyperlink).

Recycle: If the error is encountered, mark the corresponding accounting
entries as invalid and prevent them from posting until they are corrected 
and the journal is reprocessed by Journal Edit process.
Accept (only for Journal amount errors): Ignore the error and 
continue processing.
The next tab on the page - Currency Options – is shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 1
[ 35 ]
The configuration options on this tab control the posting and unposting of the
journals for this ledger group:
Do not post Future-Dated Jrnls: If this checkbox is selected, the system
prevents a journal from posting if the journal date is greater than the journal
process date. Journal process date is set during the GL BU set up.
Automatic Post Reversals: Some transactions (known as accruals) generate
reversing entries in the next accounting periods. If this checkbox is selected,
the system automatically selects the future dated reversal entries to post
when the original entries are posted.
The following screenshot shows the next Approval Options tab. The configuration
options on this tab control the journal approval workflow process:
Based on organization's requirements, we can specify one of the following 
three options:
Default to Higher Level: Use the approval option specified during the GL
BU definition:
Pre-Approved: If this value is selected, journal entries need not go through
the approval workflow and the person entering them can post them from the
journal entry page
Require Approval: If this value is selected, journal entries need to be
approved through workflow before they can be posted

PeopleSoft offers two different workflow methods – Virtual Approver and 
Approval Framework. If Virtual approver method is selected, the following 
fields become visible:
Business Process Name: Specify the workflow business process that has been
defined for journal approval
Approval Rule Set: Specify the workflow approval set for the selected
business process that has been defined for journal approval
If Approval Framework method of workflow is used, the previous two fields are 
not available.
Building Virtual Framework workflow (including Business processes
and Approval rule sets) requires strong technical skills. As a result, we
will not discuss this area in our book.
In the example shown previously, the configuration will force regular journals to be
approved, as per the business process rules defined. On the other hand, the budget
journals are configured as Pre-approved, which means that they need not go through
an approval process.
The last tab on the page is Commitment Control Options. It is shown in the
following screenshot:
This tab enables the commitment control for the given ledger group. We'll discuss
this in greater detail in Chapter 9, PeopleSoft Commitment Control.
Now that ledgers are ready to record Global Vehicles' accounting balances in
multiple currencies, we'll turn our attention to the various sources that will generate
the accounting entries and journals.

Implementation challenge
Perform necessary configurations, so that the PeopleSoft financial system can process
journals created by the Billing module.
Solution
We'll need to configure (or review the PeopleSoft delivered configurations) for a
journal source, accounting entry definition and journal generator templates for the
Billing module.
Configuring journal sources
There are many possible sources which can create journal entries. PeopleSoft
sub-modules such as Billing, Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable, and more
create their respective journals. In addition, we can create our own user defined
journal sources to categorize manually entered journals. It is also possible that our
PeopleSoft system receives journals created from external sources.
We can create as many journal sources as needed to tag the journal entries
appropriately. For example, we can define a source 'EXT' for journals imported 
from an external system. There can be another source 'BI' for journals created by 
the Billing module.
A journal source is an important place where we can specify various processing
options to handle journals from different sources differently. All the processing
options we specified for a ledger are automatically inherited to journal sources.
You'll see many of those options to be configured for a journal source as well. If
an organization wishes to handle journals from a particular source in a different
manner, we can do so by specifying that particular option at journal source level.
Note that configuration options specified at General Ledger business unit are
overridden by those specified at the ledger. Options that we specify for a journal
source override those specified for the ledger.
Follow this navigation to configure journal sources:

The following screenshot shows the first tab Definition on the journal source page:
This tab is used to specify the name of the journal source and the effective date (the
date from which it becomes active).
The next screenshot shows the next tab - Journal Options. Configuration options on
this tab determine how various journal error options are handled for journals created
from this source:
Can you recall where you have seen similar options? You are right if you answered
Ledger Options For a Unit – Journal Edit Options!
If we select Default to Higher Level Value, the system looks at the configuration
option specified for the ledger. If a particular error needs to be handled in a different
way, specify the appropriate value here.

The following screenshot shows the next tab on the page - Currency Options:
The fields on this tab are again exactly similar to those we saw for a ledger. Specify a
value depending on whether it needs to be different from the ledger value or select
Default to Higher Level Value.
The last tab on the page - Approval Options – is shown in the following screenshot:
Specify how the journal approval workflow needs to be handled on this tab. If it
need not be different from the configuration options for ledger, select Default to
Higher Level Value.

PeopleSoft Financials Fundamentals
[ 40 ]
Configuring accounting entry definitions
We previously discussed that that Journal Generator process picks up the accounting
entries created by a sub-module and transforms them into journals. We also learnt
that each sub-module has a dedicated database table to store the accounting entries.
It is the Accounting Entry Definition that provides these details of appropriate tables
and fields for a sub-module to Journal Generator.
Follow this navigation to configure accounting entry definitions: 
General Ledger | Journals | Subsystem Journals | Accounting Entry Definition
The following screenshot shows the accounting entry definition page:
Let's familiarize ourselves with some of the important fields on this page:
PeopleSoft delivers accounting entry definitions for various sub-
modules, with all the details already populated. In most of the cases,
we can use the delivered definitions without making any changes.

Chapter 1
[ 41 ]
Record: This is the source table that stores the accounting entries for a
particular sub-module. Journal Generator extracts the data from this table to
create journals.
Record Update: After Journal Generator creates the journals, it updates
this table with the journal details. Usually it is the same table from which
accounting entries are extracted.
System Source: PeopleSoft has a pre-configured system source value for each
sub-module. Ensure that the right source value corresponding to a module  
is selected.
Field Names: In the data fields in this section, specify the appropriate 
field value from the source table specified previously. For example, in  
the BI_ACCT_ENTRY table, the ACCOUNTING_DT field is used to store 
the accounting date.
Chartfield Mapping - Chartfield: These chartfields are used for summarizing
accounting entries by the journal generator if Summarize to All Chartfield
Level option is selected on the journal generator template page. If a chartfield
is not listed here, it contains a blank value for the journals created from this
accounting entry definition.
Chartfield Mapping - Summarize Chartfields: If the Summarize by Selected
Chartfields option is selected on the journal Generator template page and
this checkbox is selected for a chartfield, it is summarized during journal
creation by the Journal Generator.
We'll discuss chartfield summarization shortly in the journal generator 
template section.
Now, in addition to the PeopleSoft sub-modules, sometimes journals need to be
created from the accounting entries from external non-PeopleSoft systems. For such 
a scenario, PeopleSoft offers an accounting entry definition called GENERIC.
•
•
•
•
•
•

PeopleSoft Financials Fundamentals
[ 42 ]
The following screenshot shows the details of GENERIC accounting entry definition:
As you can see, it uses a table JGEN_ACCT_ENTRY to read the accounting entries
from. Thus, we need to ensure that these external accounting entries are stored into
this table first. Also, the value for System Source field must be JGen-Other.
It's up to us to use any of the following three options to create journals from non-
PeopleSoft systems:
1. Load accounting entries into JGEN_ACCT_ENTRY table and use the 'GENERIC'
definition (if the mapping between the table fields and incoming data
elements is simple).
2. If needed, modify the 'GENERIC' definition by using a different table or view
other than JGEN_ACCT_ENTRY (if we need to use a different table to hold the
incoming accounting entry details).
3. Create a new definition and manually specify necessary fields (if organization
requirements dictate that GENERIC definition cannot be used and a new
dedicated definition must be used).

Chapter 1
[ 43 ]
Configuring journal templates
Now we come to the last important step in the configuration of ledgers and journals.
In order to create the journals for the Billing module, we configured a Billing journal
source and Billing accounting entry definition. Thus, now the system knows where
to look for the Billing accounting entries.
Typically, accounting entries created by a sub-module belong to various types. For
example, in case of Billing, they can be broadly categorized as regular billing entries
(when customer invoices are created) and accrual billing entries (when revenue is
recognized, but the customer invoice is not created).
In case of Accounts Receivable, accounting entries can be categorized as billing
entries (based on customer invoices), payment entries (when customer payment is
received),  maintenance entries (when an outstanding invoice is written off, among
other things) and so on.
We set Journal Templates for each of such various transaction types. This template
determines how the Journal Generator summarizes the accounting entries to create
journals. It also controls how the reversing journal entries are created.
Follow this navigation to configure journal generator templates: 
General Ledger | Journals | Subsystem Journals | Journal generator Templates
The following screenshot shows the Defaults tab of journal generator template page:

PeopleSoft Financials Fundamentals
[ 44 ]
The Defaults tab contains several options that need to be configured as follows:
Accounting Entry In Sync: Recall the Keep Ledgers in Sync checkbox on 
the Ledger Group configuration page. Checking this flag ensures that an
accounting entry posted to the primary ledger in a ledger group is also
simultaneously posted to other secondary ledgers as well. For example, when
an accounting entry is posted to the GLOBALUSD ledger, PeopleSoft also
posts this entry to GLOBALGBP and GLOBALEUR ledgers simultaneously.
Create One Journal For: This field controls how accounting entries are
aggregated on the journals. Each line in the accounting entry in PeopleSoft
has an application business unit as well as a General Ledger business unit.
There may be multiple lines in an entry and it is possible that they may 
have different business units. Available options for the field are Application
Business Unit (system creates a different journal for each subsystem business
unit value present in accounting entry) and General Ledger Business Unit
(system creates a different journal for each General Ledger business unit
value present in accounting entry).
Reversal Code: In the case of some transactions (such as billing accrual), the
accounting entries need to be reversed. This option controls if reversal entries
should be created, and if so, when:
Do Not Generate Reversal: Journal Generator does not create the
reversal entry, but it marks the journals with the reversal code
Beginning of Next Period: Creates a reversing entry dated the first
business day of the next accounting period
End of Next Period: Creates a reversing entry dated the last business
day of the next accounting period
Next Day: Creates a reversing entry dated the next business day
Journal ID Mask: A unique identifier is used to distinguish journals
belonging to different transaction types we discussed previously. For
example, we can denote all journals for regular billing to have journals IDs
starting with BIR, while the journals for billing accruals journal IDs can start
with BIA. System automatically uses this prefix for the journal IDs.
Thus a journal with ID BIA45276 can be identified as a billing accrual journal, while
a journal with ID BIR27675 can be identified as a regular billing journal.
Note that it is not mandatory to have different journal ID masks for different
transaction types.

The following screenshot displays the Summarization tab of the page. This tab
controls how the accounting entries are summarized on the journals:
Again here we have the option to specify two different sets of summarization rules
for two groups of accounts.
PeopleSoft offers the following summarization options:
Summarize to Account, AltAcct: This means that accounting entries are
summarized by the Account and Alternate Account (if used) in the journal,
while all other chartfields are left blank
Summarize to All ChartFields: This option summarizes the accounting
entries to unique combinations of all the chartfields on the Accounting Entry
Definition page
Summarize by Selected CF's: This option summarizes the accounting entries
to unique combinations of only those chartfields on the Accounting Entry
Definition page that have the Summarize ChartField check box selected
•
•
•
 

PeopleSoft Financials Fundamentals
[ 46 ]
You would be able to recall the part of the Accounting Entry Definition page in 
the following screenshot. This is where we specify which chartfield needs to be 
used for summarization:
Retain Detail: This option ensures that all accounting entries are distributed to the
journal without any summarization and retain all chartfield value details.
If the organization needs to have a single summarization rule for all the accounts,
select the option All Account Values and then select the appropriate Primary
Summarization option.
If two different summarization rules are needed for two groups of accounts, carefully
analyze how these account groups are organized. For the primary group of accounts,
specify their values by either the Selected Account Values or Selected Tree Nodes
options and then select the appropriate Primary Summarization Option. For all 
the remaining account values, specify the appropriate summarization option under
Alternate Summarization Option.
Example: Accounting entries containing accounts 100001, 100002, and 100003 should
be summarized to all chartfields, while all other entries should retain their entire
chartfield details. In this case, configuration as shown in the following screenshot,
will need to be done:

Configuring banks
Every organization needs relationships with banks to conduct its business
transactions. Just like any bank account that you hold—where you receive cash and
make payments—organizations too need to have bank accounts. Banks are important
for PeopleSoft Financial applications to receive as well as disburse cash for various
modules such as Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable, and Treasury applications.
In this section, we'll discuss the following important and mandatory configuration
options that need to be in place for business processing:
Configuring bank ID qualifier

Configuring bank branch
Configuring external accounts
Configuring payment forms

Implementation challenge
Global Vehicles Inc. has a banking relationship with 'US Bank' and holds a checking
account at its New York branch. This account needs to be used to receive customer
payments and issue checks to vendors. Perform the necessary configurations.
Solution
We will need to configure a bank, branch, and an external account. The account
needs to be set up for the branch while the branch needs to be defined for the bank.
Configuring banks
As banks can be shared by multiple business units, they are set up by SetIDs. 
Follow this navigation to configure a bank: 
Banking | Banks and Branches | Bank Information
The next screenshot shows the Bank Information page:
Let's understand some of the important fields on this page:
Type: We can define a bank belonging to following four categories—External
(a banking organization that is outside the organization), Internal (an entity
such as central treasury group that is part of the implementing organization),
Netting (used for bilateral netting between Accounts Receivable and
Accounts Payable transactions), and Origin (an intermediate entity that
holds the organization's cash before being credited to bank account).
•

PeopleSoft Financials Fundamentals
[ 50 ]
Bank ID Qualifier: As we saw earlier, bank ID qualifiers are defined for
certain counties. Select the appropriate qualifier for the country of the bank.
Bank ID: Each bank has a unique code that identifies it. This is used to route
the electronic transactions such as EFT and ACH. The bank with which our
organization needs to do business, can supply this bank ID.
Configuring bank branches
We can define as many branches for a bank as required. Let's define the New York
branch for our bank.
Follow this navigation to set up a bank branch:

The following screenshot shows the Contact Information page, where relevant
details of the contact person can be entered:
Configuring external bank accounts
As we saw earlier, an external bank means a physical bank with which the
organization carries out its business. For example, if the organization has banking
relationships with HSBC or Citibank, these qualify to be called as external banks.
Bank accounts that an organization holds in these banks are in turn called 
external accounts.
Follow this navigation to configure external bank accounts:
Banking | Banks and Branches | External Accounts
The next screenshot shows the first tab on the External Accounts page:

Chapter 1
[ 53 ]
Let's familiarize ourselves with the important fields on this page:
Account #: Enter the bank account number for this external account.
DFI Qualifier: DFI stands for 'Depository Financial Institution', which is the
bank where this account exists. We can choose to use any of the identification
types for this bank (such as Transit Number, SWIFT ID and so on.)
depending upon the information provided by the bank.
DFI ID: Enter the unique ID for the bank.
BI, AR, AP, TR, EX: These checkboxes identify the module (Billing,
Receivable, Payable, Treasury, and Expenses) for which this account is being
used. As we need this account for Receivable and Payable modules, let's
check their appropriate checkboxes. When the AR checkbox is selected, the
Billing checkbox is also automatically selected. 
Depending on the selected module, various account types get enabled or
disabled in the chartfields grid at the bottom of the page.
DD/AR Draft Cash Ctrl: In the Receivables module, if we wish to use the
'Draft' payment method and want to use a control account before actually
receiving customer payments, we need to select this checkbox (applicable
only if Billing or AR checkboxes are selected).
Cash Clearing: If an organization uses cash control accounting (for AP, AR,
or TR modules), this flag needs to be selected.

Stmt Accounting: This flag enables the chartfields for statement accounting.
If we wish to install Treasury applications and it's their related bank
statement accounting functionality, we can specify the chartfields for bank
fees and interest amounts.
Drafts Payable: If we use the 'Drafts' payment method in the Payable
module, select this checkbox.
Chartfields: For the selected modules, we need to specify the actual 
accounts for cash accounts (such as Cash-AR and Cash-AP). The chartfield
values specified here are ultimately used by the system while creating
accounting entries.
For example, when a check payment is issued to a vendor, the system creates an
accounting entry as follows:
Debit Payables account
Credit Cash account
While the payables account is extracted from the voucher being paid, the cash
account is retrieved from Cash-AP chartfields specified in this tab.
The following screenshot shows the next tab on this page—Signatories:
The Signatories tab stores the signatory person and the maximum monetary amount
that he/she can approve. Note that this information is only for informational
purposes and does not affect any processing.
Now let's consider the next important tab on the External Accounts 
page—Reconciliation. The following screenshot shows the details of 
Reconciliation tab:

This tab is used to set up the rules for reconciling the bank statement against the
cash account positions in Treasury applications. As these are not in the scope of
this book, we'll not get into the details. Suffice it to say that PeopleSoft offers three
reconciliation methods: Manual, Semi manual, and Automatic.
The following screenshot shows Account Information tab on the page. This tab
contains various configuration options used by Receivable and Payable modules:
 

PeopleSoft Financials Fundamentals
[ 56 ]
We'll concentrate on some of the important fields on this page:
Remitter ID: Although not mandatory, this field stores the remitter ID
that the bank assigns to this bank account. When the EFT (Electronic
Fund Transfer) method is used, the system creates EFT files with payment
information and transmits to another bank. The receiving bank uses this
remitter ID.
Check# Len: We can specify the maximum length of check numbers 
(up to 10 digits) that the Payable system issues.
Maximum Amount Per Paycycle, Maximum Amount Per Payment: These
fields are used by bank replacement feature of pay cycles in Payable module.
When the limits specified here are exceeded, pay cycle uses an alternate bank
to issue remainder amount above the specified limit.
Deposit Type, Deposit Unit: Deposit types are configured in the Receivable
module to identify categories of funds received in bank account. Deposit Unit
refers to the Receivable business unit that is responsible for recording the
received funds.
Payment Predictor: This checkbox determines how the customer payments
received in this bank account are handled by the Receivable module. If
checked, these payments are processed by a batch process named 'Payment
Predictor', which matches them to the outstanding customer invoices. We'll
see this feature in the Accounts Receivable chapter.
The following screenshot shows Collection Methods tab on the page. This tab
specifies various options used to receive customer payments in this bank account.
Thus, these options are more relevant for the Accounts Receivable module:
•

Chapter 1
[ 57 ]
The following screenshot shows the Payment Methods tab on the page. This tab
specifies various options used to disburse (pay) payments to external entities such
as vendors or organization's employees through this bank account. Thus, this tab is
more relevant for Accounts Payable module:
Payment Method: PeopleSoft offers the following payment methods to issue
payments: Automated Clearing House, Direct Debit, Draft-Customer EFT,
Draft-Customer Initiated, Draft-Vendor Initiated, Electronic Funds Transfer,
Giro-EFT, Giro-Manual, Letter of Credit, Manual Check, System Check and
Wire Transfer.
Last Ref Number: When PeopleSoft creates a payment, it assigns a unique
number (known as Reference Number) to it. For example, in this case, 
we have specified that payments from this bank account will be issued as
Checks. Now whenever the system creates a check, it assigns a check number
to it. This number is always 1 greater than the value in this field.
As you can see, when the system creates a check next time, it will be 
numbered 0000000011. On the other hand, if we wish to force the system 
to issue checks starting from 0000000050, simply change the value in this
field to 0000000049.
•
•

PeopleSoft Financials Fundamentals
[ 58 ]
Form ID: There can be various layouts available for EFT, Check payments
and Wire Transfers, depending upon the organization's requirements. For
example, in case of check payments, Global Vehicles may have three or four
different check layouts it uses with different banks. This field is used to
specify the appropriate layout for issuing the payments. PeopleSoft delivers
a few sample payment layouts for Check, EFT, and Wire transfers. We can
either use them (with or without modifications) or create our own layouts.
Understanding User Preferences
So far we have seen some of the most important cross-module concepts and
configurations, which serve as the foundation of PeopleSoft Financial applications.
Another important system feature that controls how the system features are
controlled for each individual system user is related to setting up user preferences.
Technically speaking, this is more of a personalization feature that will drive
which users get to do what as far as various PeopleSoft modules are concerned.
Nonetheless, this is a crucial task that needs to be performed.
An important prerequisite for doing this task is of course creating user IDs in the 
first place. However, we'll discuss that in the PeopleSoft Security chapter.
Follow this navigation to access the User Preferences page:
Set Up Financials/Supply Chain | Common Definitions | User Preferences |

The following screenshot shows the main User Preferences page. It contains
hyperlinks to module specific user preference pages under Product Preference
section. Hyperlinks for common user preferences are grouped under the General
Preference section;
•

Chapter 1
[ 59 ]
As you can see, this page allows us to define user preferences for various 
PeopleSoft modules as well as certain specific features such as Pay cycle. We'll
quickly go through the settings for the financial modules and the cross-module
preference options.
Defining Overall Preferences
Click the Overall Preferences hyperlink to set up cross-module preferences. The
following screenshot shows the Overall Preferences tab. This tab specifies the
default Business Unit, SetID, and the Localization Country for the given user ID:
As you can see from the screenshot, for the user Anton James, the system will always
use US001 as the Business Unit and SHARE as the SetID whenever he accesses a
PeopleSoft page to enter a new transaction or retrieve data from the database. Of
course, the user can always change this value, but defaulting simplifies the job to a
large extent.
Defining Process Group preferences
Click the Process Group hyperlink on the main User Preferences page.

PeopleSoft Financials Fundamentals
[ 60 ]
The following screenshot shows the Process Group tab. This tab contains important
configuration options for Accounts Payable and Receivable module features that can
be selectively enabled for specific users:
Source Transaction indicates a specific system feature from the Receivable or
Payable module. PeopleSoft allows us to select from a group of 25 such system
features. The screenshot shows two sample source transactions: VOUCHER
(Voucher entry) and ARPAYWS (AR Payment Worksheet).
VOUCHER controls the processing options for the voucher entry function in
Payable, while ARPAYWS controls the actions that a user can perform for Payment
worksheets in the Receivable module.
In other words, we have just allowed Anton to use these two system features, while
preventing him from using the remaining 23.
The Process Group indicates what level of privileges is granted to a user for a
selected source transaction.
For example, PeopleSoft offers us the following options (Process Groups) as far as
payment worksheets are concerned: ARACTIONA (Do not post), ARACTIONL
(Batch standard), ARACTIONN (Batch priority), ARPOST (Post now), ARPOSTGL
(Post now through to GL). To perform his job, Anton needs to be able to post the
payment worksheets to GL. Thus, we will select the value ARPOSTGL in the Process
Group field.

Chapter 1
[ 61 ]
Allow Processing flag controls if on-demand processing is enabled for this user.
PeopleSoft allows system users to run certain batch processes from the transaction
screens. For example, a user can execute batch processes such as Voucher Post,
Journal Generator, and so on. from the voucher entry page itself. He/She need not
navigate to a different page just to run that particular process. This is known as on-
demand processing. 
Defining Billing User Preferences
Click the Billing hyperlink on the main User Preferences page.
The following screenshot shows the Billing tab.
Billing user preferences primarily control which batch processes are executed 
(or skipped) when they are triggered from a button on the Billing pages. Note 
that this doesn't apply if the batch processes are executed from their dedicated 
run control pages.
Server Name specifies the default server where the Billing processes 
will be executed.
Job Run Opt specifies if certain Billing processes are excluded from being executed.
Selecting the 'Print/Load' option means the system runs all the processes in the
multi-process job. Selecting the 'No Load' option skips the following processes:
Currency Conversion, Load AR, Pre-load, Load GL, Commitment Control, and
Standard Form 1080 and 1081 processes. We'll discuss these processes in Chapter 3,
PeopleSoft Billing Module.
Defining General Ledger User Preferences
Click the General Ledger hyperlink on the main User Preferences page.

PeopleSoft Financials Fundamentals
[ 62 ]
The next screenshot shows the General Ledger tab:
Use Next Journal ID field controls if this user can manually enter a journal ID
when he/she enters a new journal. If this checkbox is selected, while creating a
new journal, the system automatically disables the journal ID field and assigns the
next number to the new journal. This is an important option to enforce the system
generated numbering for GL users.
If the Change Journals from Journal Generator checkbox is selected, the user can
modify the chartfields and amounts for the journals created by Journal Generator
process. In PeopleSoft GL, journals can be either manually entered or created
automatically by Journal Generator process. Manual journals can always be modified
by system users. However limiting the capability to modify Journal Generator
journals to only a select few users greatly improves the controls.
Defining Payables User Preferences
Click the Procurement | Payables hyperlink on the main User Preferences page.
The following screenshot shows the Payable Online Vouchering secondary page: 

Chapter 1
[ 63 ]
Pay Unmatched Vouchers and Pay Unmatch Amt: Typically when a voucher
(vendor invoice) needs to be paid, it is first matched with a valid purchase
order. This ensures that vendor payment is for a genuine purchase we made.
If the system is configured accordingly, it does not pay a voucher unless it  
is matched.
However selecting the Pay Unmatched Vouchers checkbox allows a user
to bypass the matching requirement and pay a voucher even if it is not
matched. The Pay Unmatch Amt field specifies the maximum amount that
can be paid without matching. As you can imagine, this is a very critical 
control mechanism and this privilege should be given (if at all) to only  
a few users.
Check Voucher Amount: If a user is responsible for entering vouchers in the
Accounts Payable module, a limit can be placed on the maximum amount of
voucher that he/she can enter. To do so, select the Check Voucher Amount
button and enter the maximum permissible amount in the Entry Limit field
along with the Currency.
Post Vouchers: Voucher amounts do not become part of total outstanding
vendor liability until they are 'posted'. This field controls if a user can post 
an approved voucher.
•

•

PeopleSoft Financials Fundamentals
[ 64 ]
Authority to Override Match: As mentioned earlier, matching process
validates if a voucher is valid by checking it against a purchase order. If
an error is found, the process marks the voucher as an exception (in other
words, 'invalid'). Selecting this checkbox allows a user to override it and
force a voucher to skip the matching process.
Defining Receivables User Preferences
Click the Receivables Data Entry 1 hyperlink on the main User Preferences page.
The following screenshot shows the Receivables Data Entry 1 tab:
Group Unit: In Accounts Receivable parlance, Group Unit refers to the
business unit that tracks outstanding customer invoices (known as 'items').
Deposit Unit: In Accounts Receivable terms, Deposit Unit refers to the
business unit that receives customer payments.
The business unit value used in these fields is used as the default value by the system
whenever the user accesses the Receivable pages. The user can of course override
these default values. However this greatly reduces the data entry efforts.
Defining Receivables Write-off and Discount
User Preferences
Click the Receivables Data Entry 2 hyperlink on the main User Preferences page.

•
•

Chapter 1
[ 65 ]
The following screenshot shows the Receivables Data Entry 2 tab. This tab contains
user preference options for the user to perform two important functions: Payment
worksheets and Maintenance worksheets:
Payment worksheets are used to apply customer payment to its outstanding
invoices. Maintenance worksheets are used to write off customer invoice amounts
(partially or completely) and issue refunds to customers. For example, there may be
an outstanding invoice for USD 1000. However it turns out that this customer may
not (or will not) pay this amount (due to a variety of reasons). If he/she can pay only
a part (say USD 700), we need to write off the remaining USD 300 (30% of the invoice
amount). On the other hand, if the customer cannot pay anything, we will need to
write off the entire amount of USD 1000.
Options under the Payment Worksheet section:
Discount Tolerance Percent, Discount Tolerance: These fields determine 
the upper limit of discount that can be given to a customer (known as
'unearned discount').
Write Off Percent Under, Underpayment Write-Off: When a customer pays
less than the invoice amount, it is known as 'underpayment'. These fields
determine the upper limit for the underpayment that can be written off.
Write Off Percent Over, Overpayment Write-Off: When a customer pays
more than the invoice amount, it is known as 'overpayment'. The additional
amount received can be written off rather than returning it to the customer.
These fields determine the upper limit for the overpayment that can be
written off.
Item Write-Off: This field determines the maximum amount that a user can
write off on a payment worksheet.

Options under the Maintenance Worksheet section:
Max Write Off, Max WO Percent: These fields determine the maximum
amount that a user can write off using a maintenance worksheet.
Max Refund: This field specifies the maximum amount that a user can
refund to a customer.
Write-Off Days: This field determines the minimum age of an invoice before
it can be written off.
Override Write off Tolerance: This powerful option enables a user to
override all write off limits (specified for Business Unit, Customer and so on.
Of course, the maximum write-off limits placed for the user still apply.
Understanding Setup Manager
Configuring PeopleSoft Financial applications from scratch is certainly no easy task.
A typical implementation involving multiple modules typically involves hundreds
of configuration activities that need to be performed in a specific sequence. In this
chapter so far, we have covered some of the critical configuration activities, but
discussing each of them is quite impractical. So the million dollar question is—How
do we ensure that we complete all the necessary setup activities in the right order? 
Let's not worry…PeopleSoft has just the right tool to help us with exactly this. It is
known as the Setup Manager. 
Setup Manager lists all the tasks required for implementing a product (module)
in the right sequence. In addition, it shows the navigation path to the page where
required configuration needs to be done. A direct link is provided so that the user
can reach the appropriate page. We'll quickly see how to use it.

The following screenshot shows the Manage Implementation Projects page:
As you can see, we can create the implementation project either by a product (such
as Billing, Accounts Receivable, and so on) or a Business Process (such as Process
customer payments, Receive goods, and so on).
For our business requirement, as we need to configure the Billing module, we'll
create the implementation project by Product.
Click the Products button. As shown in the following screenshot, the system opens a
page listing all the PeopleSoft modules for which the organization holds a license:

PeopleSoft Financials Fundamentals

Check the Select checkbox next to the required module and click the View Summary
button at the bottom of the page. 
The system opens a new page with two tabs. The following screenshot shows the
Product Summary tab:
The page shows all the features offered by PeopleSoft in selected product. As part of
the implementation, one of the critical tasks is to determine which of these features
are really needed for the implementing organization.
Let's assume that for our hypothetical Billing module implementation, we do not
need the Balance Accumulation and Billing Summarization features. Remove these
features from the list by clicking the '-' button next to them.
Features marked with a star are mandatory and
cannot be removed.

Click Save at the bottom of the page. The system opens a new page, which is shown
in the following screenshot:
Enter the Project Name and Description and click OK. As shown in the next
screenshot, the system opens a page showing the implementation project with 
given name:
Click the Generate Setup Tasks button in this page to automatically create the list of
configuration tasks. The following screenshot shows the process status page:
This triggers a batch process in the background with its Run Status as Queued.
When the process is completed, the run status automatically changes to Success.

This page lists out all the necessary configuration activities in the 
appropriate sequence.
The Status field shows the current status for the setup task. Place the cursor over the
icon to see the status: Not started, In progress, or Complete.

persons) responsible for this task can be entered. Note that this doesn't affect
who actually performs a particular task.

entirely informational. When you enter 100% in this field, the task status
changes to Complete.
Click the Task Details tab. The following screenshot shows the details of Task 
Details tab:

Cross Database: This field indicates if a configuration option affects 
multiple modules.
Load Method: Indicates how configuration values can be entered into
PeopleSoft system. Available options are: Component Interface, ETL, Other,
and Online.
Let's look at a different set of tasks. The following screenshot shows a few setup tasks
for the Billing module:
As you can see, configuring Adjustment Type and Book Code can be done by
Online method alone. On the other hand, configuration for other tasks can be done
either by Component Interface or Online method.
Let's understand these different configuration methods:
Online: Required configuration values can be entered manually on the online
pages. For example, to configure Adjustment Type, the user can navigate to
the appropriate page and enter as many adjustment type values as required.
Component Interface: When the volume of configuration values is quite
high, this is the preferred method. PeopleSoft offers a utility called Excel to
Component Interface. It essentially automates the data entry into PeopleSoft
setup pages by reading data from pre-defined Microsoft Excel templates.
For example, if there are 2000 Account values to be configured, it is much
easier to put the data such as Account number, Description and so on, into
the Excel template. The template contains all the field values that need to 
be entered on the PeopleSoft page. The Excel to Component Interface utility
then reads these values from the template, validates them, and loads them
one row after the other into the PeopleSoft component.
•

Chapter 1
[ 73 ]
Other: You can write a customized program to load configuration values
from an external source.
So, this is what we'll need to do as we go along the configuration of 
a PeopleSoft module:
Create an implementation project for a specific module. It'll show all the
required configuration activities.
In the Tracking tab, assign each task to the concerned person (it may 
be yourself!) along with the planned start and end dates (although it 
is not mandatory).
Click the hyperlink for each task so that the system opens the required page
and performs necessary system setups.
Once a task is completed, enter 100% as percentage completed, so that task
status changes to Complete.
Summary
With this we come to the end of the first chapter where we learned some critical
concepts about PeopleSoft Financial applications. We also saw some of the important
cross-module configuration activities needed for a working financial system. Here is
what we learned.
A Chart of Accounts is the foundation of PeopleSoft financial applications. It
includes various attributes that need to be recorded for each accounting transaction.
These attributes are called chartfields. We can perform Standard or Advanced
configuration to modify delivered chartfields according to our needs. It is always
advisable to use standard configuration instead of advanced configuration.
Business Unit is an organizational unit that independently maintains its account
balances. Business Units of an organization can be organized on the basis of
geography, line of business or any other parameter that we choose. All the financial
transaction data such as invoices, journals, and purchase orders are segregated 
by Business Unit. A SetID is a collection of master data elements such as vendors,
customers, banks, and so on. It determines which setup values can be accessed  
by a Business Unit. SetIDs allow master data to be shared by multiple BUs.

A ledger is the central piece in PeopleSoft financial applications. An organization's
account balances are stored in the ledger. Journals consolidate the accounting entries
created by various PeopleSoft modules and post them to ledgers. A batch process
known as Journal Generator automates the journal creation process. After these
journals are created, the Journal Edit batch process validates them. Another batch
process - Journal Post - posts valid journals to the ledger, thus completing the 
journal processing.
Banks are used by an organization to receive customer payments as well as make
payments to its vendors. Each bank can have as many branches as needed. Each
branch can have multiple bank accounts associated with it.
Configuring a PeopleSoft module involves a large number of tasks that need to
be completed in the right order. PeopleSoft delivers a tool called Setup Manager
to help in the setup activities. It lists tasks necessary to implement a module in
the appropriate sequence. It also provides navigation paths and hyperlinks to the
PeopleSoft pages where setups need to be done.

PeopleSoft Security
Security design is a critical part—of any implementation of PeopleSoft Financial
application. By its very nature, a financial system needs robust security mechanisms
to enforce appropriate controls on who can access the system and which features.
PeopleSoft security consists of multiple aspects, such as User security, Row level
security, Query security, Network security, Database security, Object security, 
and Field level security. In keeping up with the philosophy of this book, we'll
concentrate on security aspects that are typically configured by a Business Analyst 
or a Functional SME, that is, User-and Row-level security. Remaining aspects 
of security involve significant technical knowledge of PeopleSoft's application
development environment (known as Application Designer) and security
technologies, such as SSL.
In this chapter, we'll discuss user security components such as User Profiles,
Roles, and Permission Lists. We'll also discuss how to enable and configure Row
level security.
Understanding user security
Before we get into discussing the PeopleSoft security, let's spend some time trying
to set the context for user security.
Whenever we think of a complex system like PeopleSoft Financial applications with
potentially hundreds of users, the following are but a few questions that face us:
Should a user working in billing group have access to transactions, such as
vouchers and payments, in Accounts Payable?
Should a user who is a part of North America business unit have access to
the data belonging to the Europe business unit?
•
•
 

PeopleSoft Security
[ 76 ]
Should a user whose job involves entering vouchers be able to approve and
pay them as well?
Should a data entry clerk be able to view departmental budgets for the
organization?
These questions barely scratch the surface of the complex security considerations of
an organization. Of course, there is no right or wrong answer for such questions, as
every organization has its own unique security policies.
What is more important is the fact that we need a mechanism that can segregate the
access to system features. We need to enforce appropriate controls to ensure users
can access only the features they need.
Implementation challenge
Global Vehicles' Accounts Payable department has three different types of  
users – Mary, who is the AP manager; Amy, who is the AP Supervisor; and Anton,
who is the AP Clerk. These three types of users need to have the following access to
PeopleSoft features:
User type
Access to feature
Description
AP Clerk
Voucher entry
A clerk should be able to access system
pages to enter vouchers from various
vendors.
AP Supervisor
Voucher entry
Voucher approval
Voucher posting
A supervisor also needs to have access to
enter vouchers. He/she should review
and approve each voucher entered by the
clerk. Also, the supervisor should be able
to execute the Voucher Post process that
creates accounting entries for vouchers.
AP Manager
Pay cycle
Voucher approval
An AP manager should be the only one
who can execute the Pay Cycle (a process
that prints checks to issue payments 
to vendors). Manager (in addition to 
the Supervisor) should also have the
authority to approve vouchers.
Note that this is an extremely simplified scenario that does not really include all the
required features in Accounts Payable.
•

Chapter 2
[ 77 ]
Solution
We will design a security matrix that uses distinct security roles. We'll configure
permission lists, roles, and user profiles to limit user access to required system features.
PeopleSoft security matrix is a three-level structure consisting of Permission lists
(at the bottom), Roles (in the middle) and User profiles (at the top). The following
illustration shows how it is structured:
We need to create a User Profile for each user of the system. This user profile 
can have as many Roles as needed. For example, a user can have roles of Billing
Supervisor and Accounts Receivable Payment Processor, if he/she approves
customer invoices as well as processes customer payments. Thus, the number of
roles that a user should be granted depends entirely on his/her job responsibilities.
Each role can have multiple permission lists. A Permission list determines which
features can be accessed by a Role. We can specify which pages can be accessed, the
mode in which they can be accessed (read only/add/update) in a permission list.
In a nutshell, we can think of a Role as a grouping of system features that a 
user needs to access, while a Permission list defines the nature of access to those
system features.

PeopleSoft Security
[ 78 ]
Expert tip
Deciding how many and which roles should be created needs quite a
bit of thinking about. How easy will it be to maintain them in future?
Think of the scenarios where a function needs to be removed from a
role and added to another. How easy would it be to do so? As a rule 
of thumb, you should map system features to roles in such a way that
they are non-overlapping. Similarly, map system pages to permission
lists so that they are mutually exclusive. This simplifies user security
maintenance to a large extent. Note that although it is advisable, it may
not always be possible. Organizational requirements are sometimes too
complicated to achieve this. However, a PeopleSoft professional should
try to build a modular security design to the extent possible.
Now, let's try to design our security matrix for the hypothetical scenario presented
previously and test our thumb rule of mutually exclusive roles and permission lists.
What do you observe as far as required system features for a role are concerned? You
are absolutely right if you thought that some of system features (such as Voucher
entry) are common across roles.
Which roles should we design for this situation? Going by the principle of mutually
exclusive roles, we can map system features to the permission lists (and in turn roles)
without overlapping them. We'll denote our roles by the prefix 'RL' and permission
lists by the prefix 'PL'. Thus, the mapping may look something like this:
Role 
Permission list
System feature
RL_Voucher_Entry
PL_Voucher_Entry
Voucher Entry
RL_Voucher_Approval
PL_Voucher_Approval
Voucher Approval
RL_Voucher_Posting
PL_Voucher_Posting
Voucher Posting
RL_Pay_Cycle
PL_Pay_Cycle
Pay Cycle
So, now we have created the required roles and permission lists, and attached
appropriate permission lists to each of the roles. In this example, due to the simple
scenario, each role has only a single permission list assigned to it.

Chapter 2
[ 79 ]
Now as the final step, we'll assign appropriate roles to each user's User profile.
User 
Role
System feature accessed
Mary 
RL_Voucher_Approval
Voucher Approval
RL_Pay_Cycle
Pay Cycle
Amy
RL_Voucher_Entry
Voucher Entry
RL_Voucher_Approval
Voucher Approval
RL_Voucher_Posting
Voucher Posting
Anton
RL_Voucher_Entry
Voucher Entry
Now, as you can see, each user has access to the appropriate system feature through
the roles and in turn, permission lists attached to their user profiles.
Can you think of the advantage of our approach? Let's say that a few months down
the line, it is decided that Mary (AP Manager) should be the only one approving
vouchers, while Amy (AP Supervisor) should also have the ability to execute pay
cycles and issue payments to vendors. How can we accommodate this change? It's
quite simple really – we'll remove the role RL_Voucher_Approval from Amy's user
profile and add the role RL_Pay_Cycle to her profile. So now the security matrix will
look like this:
User 
Role
System feature accessed
Mary 
RL_Voucher_Approval
Voucher Approval
RL_Pay_Cycle
Pay Cycle
Amy
RL_Voucher_Entry
Voucher Entry
RL_Pay_Cycle
Pay Cycle
RL_Voucher_Posting
Voucher Posting
Anton
RL_Voucher_Entry
Voucher Entry
Thus, security maintenance becomes less cumbersome when we design roles and
permission lists with non-overlapping system features. Of course, this comes with a
downside as well. This approach results in a large number of roles and permission
lists, thereby increasing the initial configuration effort.
The solution that we actually design for an organization needs to balance these 
two objectives.
Expert tip
Having too many permission lists assigned to a User Profile can
adversely affect the system performance. PeopleSoft recommends 10-20
permission lists per user.

PeopleSoft Security
[ 80 ]
Configuring permission lists
Follow this navigation to configure permission lists:
PeopleTools | Security | Permissions & Roles | Permission Lists
The following screenshot shows the General tab of the Permission List set up page.
We can specify the permission list description on this tab.
We'll go through some of the important configuration activities for the Voucher
Entry permission list discussed previously.
Can Start Application Server?: Selecting this field enables a user with this
permission list to start PeopleSoft application servers (all batch processes are
executed on this server). A typical system user does not need this option.
Allow Password to be Emailed?: Selecting this field enables users to receive
forgotten passwords through e-mail. Leave the field unchecked to prevent
unencrypted passwords from being sent in e-mails.
Time-out Minutes – Never Time-out and Specific Time-out: These fields
determine the number of minutes of inactivity after which the system
automatically logs out the user with this permission list.
The following screenshot shows the Pages tab of the permission list page. This is the
most important place where we specify the menus, components, and ultimately the
pages that a user can access.
•
•
•

Chapter 2
[ 81 ]
In PeopleSoft parlance, a component means collection of pages that are related 
to each other. In the previous screenshot, you are looking at a page. You can also 
see other related pages used to configure permission lists – General, PeopleTools,
Process, and so on. All these pages constitute a component. A menu is a collection of
various components. It is typically related to a system feature, such as 'Enter Voucher
Information' as you can see in the screenshot.
Thus, to grant a page access, we need to enter its component and menu details.
Expert tip
In order to find out the component and menu for a page, press CTRL+J
when it is open in the internet browser.
Menu Name: This is where we need to specify all the menus to which a user
needs to have access. Note that a permission list can grant access to multiple
menus, but our simple example includes only one system feature (Voucher
entry) and in turn, only one menu. Click the + button to add and select 
more menus.
Edit Components hyperlink: Once we select a menu, we need to specify
which components under it should be accessed by the permission list.
•
•

PeopleSoft Security
[ 82 ]
Click the Edit Components hyperlink to proceed. The system opens the Component
Permissions page, as shown in the following screenshot:
In this page, the system shows all components under the selected menu. The
previous screenshot shows only a part of the component list under the 'Enter
Voucher Information' menu.
Voucher entry pages for which we need to grant access exist under a component
named VCHR_EXPRESS.
Click the Edit Pages hyperlink to grant access to specific pages under a given
component. The system opens the Page Permissions page, as shown in the 
following screenshot:

Chapter 2
[ 83 ]
The given screenshot shows the partial list of pages under the Voucher 
Entry component.
Panel Item Name: This field shows the page name to which access is to 
be granted.
Authorized?: In order to enable a user to access a page, select this checkbox.
As you can see, we have authorized this permission list to access six pages in
this component.
Display Only: Clicking this checkbox allows the user to get read-only access
for the given page. He/she cannot make any changes to the data on this
page.
Add: Selecting this checkbox enables the user to add a new transaction 
(in this case new vouchers).
Update/Display: Selecting this checkbox enables the user to retrieve the
current effective dated row. He/she can also add future effective dated rows
in addition to modifying them.
Update/Display All: This option gives the user all of the privileges of the
Update/Display option. In addition he/she can retrieve past effective 
dated rows as well.
Correction: This option enables the user to perform all the possible
operations; that is, to retrieve, modify or add past, current, and future
effective dated rows.
Effective dates are usually relevant for master data set ups. It drives
when a particular value comes into effect. A vendor may be set up with
effective date of 1/1/2001, so that it comes into effect from that date.
Now assume that its name is slated to change on 1/1/2012. However,
we can add a new vendor row with the new name and the appropriate
effective date. The system automatically starts using the new name from
1/1/2012. Note that there can be multiple future effective dated rows,
but only one current row.
The next tab PeopleTools contains configuration options that are more relevant for
technical developers. As we are concentrating on business users of the system, we'll
not discuss them.

Click the Process tab. As shown in the following screenshot, this tab is used to
configure options for Process groups.
A process group is a collection of batch processes belonging to a specific internal
department or a business process. For example, PeopleSoft delivers a process group
ARALL that includes all Accounts Receivable batch processes. PeopleSoft delivers
various pre-configured process groups; however, we can create our own process
groups depending on the organization's requirements.
Click the Process Group Permissions hyperlink. The system opens a new page
where we can select as many process groups as needed. When a process group
is selected for a permission list, it enables the users to execute batch and online
processes that are part of it.
The following screenshot shows the Sign-on Times tab. This tab controls the time
spans when a user with this permission list can sign-on to the system. We can
enforce specific days or specific time spans for a particular day when users can 
sign-on.

Chapter 2
[ 85 ]
In the case of our permission list, there are no such limits and users with this
permission list will be able to sign-on anytime on all days of the week.
The next tab on this page is the Component Interface. In Chapter 1, PeopleSoft
Financials Fundamentals, we saw that the component interface is a PeopleSoft utility 
that automates bulk data entry into PeopleSoft pages. We can select component
interface values on this tab, so that users with this permission list have access 
rights to use them.
Due to the highly technical nature of the activities involved, we will not discuss the 
Web Libraries, Web Services, Mass change, Links, and Audit tabs.
Oracle offers exhaustive documentation on PeopleSoft applications at the
following URL: http://www.oracle.com/pls/psft/homepage.
Documentation for technical topics such as web services can be found
under the 'PeopleTools' section. Documentation for functional modules,
such as Billing, Accounts Receivable, and so on, can be found under the 
Financials Supply Chain Management (FSCM) section.
The next important tab on the permission list page is Query. On this tab, the system
shows two hyperlinks: Access Group Permissions and Query Profile.
Click the Access Group Permissions hyperlink. The system opens the Permission
List Access Groups page, as shown in the next screenshot. This page controls
which database tables can be accessed by users to create database queries, using a
PeopleSoft tool called Query Manager.
Tree Name: A tree is a hierarchical structure of database tables. As shown in
the screenshot, the tree QUERY_TREE_AP groups all AP tables.
Access Group: Each tree has multiple nodes called access groups. These
access groups are just logical groups of tables within a tree. In the screenshot,
VOUCHERS is a group of voucher-related tables within the AP table tree.
With this configuration, users will be able to create database queries on
voucher tables in AP.
•
•

PeopleSoft Security
[ 86 ]
Using the Query Profile hyperlink, we can set various options that control how users
can create queries (such as if he/she can use joins, unions, and so on in queries, how
many database rows can be fetched by the query, if the user can copy the query
output to Microsoft Excel, and so on).
Configuring roles
Before we proceed, recall that a role can have multiple permission lists, while
multiple roles can be granted to a user profile. Thus, a security role connects 
a user profile with actual page level access details, which are defined using
permission lists.
Follow this navigation to set up security roles:
PeopleTools | Security | Permission & Roles | Roles
The following screenshot shows the General tab of role set up page, where we
specify the role name.
Click the Permission Lists tab to attach the required permission lists to this role. 
The following screenshot shows the Permission Lists tab.
We will attach the permission list that we set up for voucher entry access to the role.
Click the View Definition hyperlink to open the permission list page and see details
of the selected permission list. Add as many permission lists as required by clicking
the + button.

Chapter 2
[ 87 ]
The next two tabs (Members and Dynamic Members) show the details of static and
dynamic members respectively. Let's first try to understand what that means.
We mentioned earlier that roles need to be assigned to user profiles to establish  
a link between profiles and permission lists. If this assignment of roles to profiles 
is done manually through PeopleSoft pages, selected users are known as static role
members. This approach is fine with a small to medium user base, but what happens
when the user base runs into thousands? Assigning various roles to all these users
manually becomes a huge task. For such scenarios, we can programmatically assign
roles to users based on predefined rules. In this case, the users are known as dynamic
role members.
Click the Members tab to see if there are any static role users for this role. 
The following screenshot shows details of the Members tab.
For our illustrative example, let's assume that we manually assigned the 
RL_VOUCHER_ENTRY role to Anton. As a result, Anton comes up as a 
static role member in the Members tab.
Click the Dynamic Members tab to view how rules can be defined to
programmatically assign this role to a large number of users. The following
screenshot shows the Dynamic Members tab.

PeopleSoft Security
[ 88 ]
As you can see, there are three ways in which we can define the rule: using
PeopleSoft Query, where a database query specifies criteria for the users who 
need to be assigned this rule, writing code in PeopleCode (this is the programming
language used by PeopleSoft), or using the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
(LDAP) directory.
Query Rule Enabled: Select this option if we specify the target user base
through PeopleSoft query. This option enables a field where we can specify
the query name.
PeopleCode Rule Enabled: Select this option if the criteria for selecting the
target user group is coded programmatically in PeopleCode. This option
enables fields to specify the PeopleSoft record (table) name, field name, field
event name, and name of the function that contains the required code.
Directory Rule Enabled: Select this option if the criteria for selecting target
user group is defined through a LDAP directory rule. This option enables the
Assign Directory Rule hyperlink, allowing us to specify the appropriate rule.
We'll limit our discussion of security roles to these basic tabs.
Configuring user profiles
Each user that needs to access the PeopleSoft system requires a user profile. As you
already know, a user profile needs to be assigned the required roles to enable that
user to access certain system features.
Follow this navigation to set up user profiles:
PeopleTools | Security | User Profiles | User Profiles
The following screenshot shows the General tab of the User Profile page.
Access to this page is highly restricted and usually limited to the system
administrator function.

Chapter 2
[ 89 ]
Account Locked Out?: If this checkbox is selected, the user cannot sign in
to the system. Thus, it is important to have it unchecked to allow a user to
access the system.
Password and Confirm Password: Specify the password for this user to log
in to the system.
Primary, Row Security: Assign a permission list for the row-level security to
control the actual values of key fields (such as BU, SetID, and so on).
Click the ID tab to specify the type of system user (such as Employee, Customer,
Vendor and so on) and specify relevant attributes (such as Employee ID, Customer
ID, Vendor ID, respectively) as shown in the following screenshot:
•
•
•

PeopleSoft Security
[ 90 ]
Click the Roles tab to assign security roles to the user. As we discussed earlier, 
this will mean that the user is a static role member. The next screenshot shows 
the Roles tab.
We'll assign the RL_VOUCHER_ENTRY role we configured earlier to this user
profile. This will enable Anton to access necessary voucher entry pages through the
PL_VOUCHER_ENTRY permission list.
Dynamic: If dynamic role assignment is used for this role, this checkbox is
automatically selected.
Dynamic Role Rule: We already discussed that role assignment rules can be
defined while setting up security roles. Options in this section help in testing
the assignment and execution.
Test Rule(s): When this button is clicked, the system generates a report 
that shows which dynamically-defined roles will be assigned to this user in
addition to the manually-assigned rules. Remember that this is just a preview
for the role assignment and the roles will not be really assigned.
Execute Rule(s): Click this button to run the dynamic role 
assignment process.
Click the Workflow tab to set up workflow configuration options for this user, as
shown in the following screenshot.
•

•

Chapter 2
[ 91 ]
Alternate User ID, From Date, To Date: Specify an alternate user ID, who
should receive all workflow items that the original user receives, between the
dates specified in the From Date and To Date fields. This feature is useful
when a user is temporarily away due to a vacation or similar occasions. In
the given example, all workflow notifications for Anton will be routed to the
user ID TKENDALL between 1st and 21st October, 2011.
Note that assignment of workflow items is applicable only for new items.
Any items that were already assigned to the user are not reassigned.
Total Pending Worklist Entries: This field shows the workflow items that
are currently assigned to the user and are not completed.
Reassign Work To: This option enables reassignment of currently assigned
pending items to a different user.
Understanding row-level security
So far we have discussed security access being controlled using permission lists 
and roles to specify which application pages can be accessed by users.
In addition to the page security, PeopleSoft offers another level of security called
Row level security. This method is useful to control access to specific rows of data
using either specific User IDs or permission lists.

To understand this concept, let's continue our example of Anton, who can enter
vouchers in the Accounts Payable module. We already saw configuration options
that allowed us to limit his system access to voucher entry pages. But can we restrict
his access to vouchers for only one Business Unit, (BU) say US001? We certainly did
not see such options while configuring user profiles, roles, or permission lists. This is
where row-level security comes in.
If we wish to limit Anton to seeing vouchers in the system for US001 BU alone, 
we essentially want to limit his access to only those database rows belonging 
to US001 BU.
Row-level security can be implemented for database rows that are controlled by the
following fields:
Business unit
SetID
Ledger (and ledger group)
Book
Project
Pay cycle
Planning Instance
We just discussed how to control access to data with a specific Business Unit. If
needed, we can limit user access to data for a specific SetID, Ledger or any of the
fields in the given list.
Note that even if we decide to use row-level security, it is not mandatory
to use all the fields mentioned previously for access control. For example,
we may wish to use row-level security for only business unit and SetID,
while users are free to access data for any pay cycle, ledger, and so on.
There are two ways of configuring row-level security:
User ID level security
Permission list level security

Chapter 2
[ 93 ]
User ID level security
In this method, we need to specify which values of Business Unit, SetID, and  
so on, can be accessed for each user. Thus, a sample configuration may look like 
this, assuming we have enabled row level security only for Business Unit and 
SetID fields:
User ID 
Business Unit access
SetID access
AJAMES
US001
GLOVH
FRA01
TKENDALL
US001
GLOVH
FRA01
SHARE
GBR01
This approach works well if the user base is small. As you can imagine, configuring
it for a large user base running in the thousands is not practical. This is where we
need to use the permission list level security.
Permission list-level security
In this method of row-level security, key field values are assigned to a permission list
rather than an individual user ID. This permission list is assigned to multiple users
as the Primary Permission List (recall the General tab on the User Profile page).
Assuming that there are 500 users who need to access data for BUs US001 and FRA01
and SetID GLOVH, we can use the following configuration:
Pernission List
Business Unit access
SetID access
ALLPAGES
US001
GLOVH
FRA01
Later, this permission list is assigned to all the users as primary permission list.
Now let's say that all these users need to access an additional BU GBR01, we need to
do it only for the given mapping and it will be reflected for all the 500 users.

Specifying row-level security options
Follow this navigation to specify system security options:
Setup Financials/Supply Chain | Security | Security Options | Security Options
The following screenshot shows the Security Options page where we can specify 
the security type and the important fields for which access needs to be restricted.
No Security: If this option is selected, users can access data belonging to all
business units, ledgers, or any other key field.
User ID Level Security: This enables security by individual User ID. 
We need to assign permissible values to user ID profiles on other pages.
Permission List Level Security: This enables security by Permission List. 
We need to assign permissible values to permission lists on other pages.
Secured Fields: As you can see, the system shows the key fields listed
previously. We need to select the fields that we need for row-level security
access. Based on the fields we select, we need to assign permissible values to
appropriate User ID or Permission list.
In the example shown in the previous screenshot, we have enabled row level security
for Business Unit and selected Permission level security. Therefore, we'll have to
assign the BU values to be accessed to the appropriate permission list. We'll see how
to do it a little later.
Applying security options
The security options that we specified previously do not come into effect, unless we
execute the Apply Security Setups batch process.

Defining row-level security values
As we discussed previously, we need to assign the values for the enabled fields to
appropriate User ID or Permission lists.
PeopleSoft provides the following 10 pages to assign various key field values to User
IDs or Permission lists:
Unit Security by Permission List
Unit Security by User ID
TableSet Security by Permission List
TableSet Security by User ID
Ledger Security by Permission List
Ledger Security by User ID
nVision Ledger Security
Pay Cycle by user ID

Setup Financials/Supply Chain | Security | Unit by Permission List
The following screenshot shows the Business Unit Security by Permission List page.
In this example, BU values US001, FRA01 and GBR01 are assigned to a permission
list ALLPAGES. Any user with this permission list as the primary permission list on
his/her user profile will be able to access data for only for these BU values.
Unit Security by User ID
Follow this navigation to assign BU values to an individual User ID:
Setup Financials/Supply Chain | Security | Unit by User ID
The following screenshot shows the Business Unit Security by User ID page.
In this example, BU values US001 and FRA01 are assigned to a user ID AJAMES.
This user will be able to access data only for these two BU values.

Chapter 2
[ 97 ]
Summary
PeopleSoft security performs a critical task of controlling the access of system
features to appropriate users. User security is a three-level hierarchical structure
consisting of User Profiles, Roles, and Permission Lists. Permission Lists control
which pages can be accessed and the mode of the access. A Role is assigned as many
permission lists as needed. It can be considered a collection of system features. A
user profile is created for each system user and is assigned as many roles as needed
by the user.
While the user security controls which system pages can be accessed by a user, the
Row-Level Security controls which rows of data can be accessed by a user. It limits
the data retrieved by a user to specific values of a Business unit, SetID, Ledger,
Book, Project, Pay cycle, or a Planning Instance. Row-level security options can be
implemented by User ID (suited to a small user base) or Permission List (ideally
suited for large user base with similar access requirements). In other words, we can
specify which values of the given key fields can be accessed either for a user ID or a
permission list.


PeopleSoft Billing Module
The PeopleSoft Billing Module performs the important function of generating
customer invoices for the goods or services sold by an organization. It is an
important part of the 'Order to Cash' business process. This module allows an
organization to seamlessly receive data from various PeopleSoft modules to create
customer invoices. It allows us to create multiple formats to generate invoices based
on business needs. Various batch processes in the Billing module enable the complete
automation of the entire invoicing process. Users can manually create invoices as
well if required.
PeopleSoft Billing can perform necessary calculations for Sales and Use Tax (SUT)
and Value Added Tax (VAT). It also allows adjustments to generated invoices,
creates accounting entries, and interfaces the invoice data to other PeopleSoft
modules.
In this chapter, we will discuss the invoice lifecycle and various Billing batch
processes. We'll gain an understanding of concepts such revenue accrual and
deferred revenue processing. We'll also discuss important configurations in the
Billing module.
Understanding the invoice lifecycle
In the PeopleSoft Billing module, you will frequently hear the terms "bill" and
"invoice". To put it simply, while an invoice is the final document to be sent to a
customer, a bill can be considered a 'raw' version of the invoice. 

PeopleSoft Billing Module
[ 100 ]
The following illustration shows a high-level process for invoice processing:
The billing process begins with the entry of bills, either manually or through
delivered interfaces from other PeopleSoft modules. We'll discuss these concepts 
in greater detail a little later. Once these bills are in the PeopleSoft system, they can
be reviewed and approved (if necessary). Reviewing the bills can be implemented
through printing draft invoices, called pro-forma invoices. You can print pro-forma
invoices using a batch process as many times as needed to review how the invoices
would look. If any changes are needed, they are made to the bill. 
Once the bill is deemed appropriate, a batch process is executed to 'finalize' the bill.
This transforms a bill into the final invoice. Additional batch processes then print the
invoices in desired formats or transmit them electronically to the customer. 
There may be various occasions when an invoice needs to be modified after it is sent
to the customer. This is done through invoice adjustments. These adjustments can be
made to specific lines on the invoices or the entire invoice itself. After making any
adjustments, an invoice needs to go through the finalization process again.
Finally, another batch process creates accounting entries for the invoices. Additional
batch processes then send the accounting entries to the General Ledger, invoice data 
to Accounts Receivable for tracking them and inter-unit invoices to the Accounts 
Payable module.
We'll discuss each of these stages in detail in subsequent sections.

Chapter 3
[ 101 ]
Entering bill data
As we briefly saw in the invoice lifecycle, bills can be entered into the PeopleSoft
system manually or through an interface from other PeopleSoft modules or 
non-PeopleSoft systems. We'll now discuss these approaches in detail. Note that
manual bill entry is appropriate when the bill volume is relatively small. Usually
for large organizations, the bill data volume is quite high and originates from other
sources. For such situations, manual entry is certainly not an option and  
an automated interface needs to be employed.
Receiving bill data from other modules or
external sources
PeopleSoft offers a set of interface tables to store bill data from external sources
(PeopleSoft/non-PeopleSoft) and a batch process named Billing Interface (BIIF0001)
to load the data from these staging tables into billing tables. 
Of course, you may be wondering how the bill data will be loaded into the interface
tables in the first place. As far as bill data from other PeopleSoft modules (such as
order management, inventory, contracts, project costing, and so on) is concerned,
each of those modules offers a delivered program to load data from that respective
module to billing interface tables.
For example, the order management module sends sales order data to Billing
interface tables through a batch process called Populate Billing.
The bill data in the Billing module essentially contains a bill header and its
individual lines. For example, if an organization has sold three different products
to a customer, the bill would have a bill header and three bill lines. This is just a
sample example; in real life, this bill would typically have other details such as tax,
accounting entries, notes, and so on.
In the Billing interface, the bill data that are brought in belong to the following
categories known as Transaction types:
Transaction type
Description
LINE
This transaction type indicates an individual bill line. In the
previous example, there would be three separate data rows with this
transaction type. 
AE (Accounting
entry)
This transaction type indicates an accounting entry. Note that this
transaction type is valid only if the source system sends accounting
entries and is not mandatory. There can be multiple accounting
entries for each bill line.

PeopleSoft Billing Module
[ 102 ]
Transaction type
Description
NOTE
This transaction type indicates a comment for the entire bill
header or an individual bill line. Again, populating data with this
transaction type is not mandatory. Each bill line can have multiple
notes.
DS
This transaction type indicates a discount or surcharge (additional
charge for the bill line amount) for the bill line. Populating data
with this transaction type is not mandatory. Each bill line can have
multiple discount or surcharge lines.
DDS
This transaction type indicates a deferred discount or surcharge for
the bill line. If the bill is using deferred revenue accounting (which
we'll see in a later section) and has a DS line type, then it also has a
DDS line representing the accounting information.
AHDR
This transaction type indicates an adjustment header. This is needed
when we are bringing in adjustments for existing bills.
EXSD
This transaction type indicates excise, sales tax and VAT
information. 
TAX
This transaction type indicates sales tax information. 
Billing interface tables
If we are bringing in the billing data from another PeopleSoft module, the population
of these tables is handled by the delivered interface program from that source
module. For example, the PeopleSoft Order Management module includes a batch
process that loads the customer order details into the Billing interface tables.
However, if we bring in the data from a non-PeopleSoft system, a customized
interface program needs to be developed to populate these tables. Let's say that an
organization uses a non-PeopleSoft system to capture customer orders. To import
these order data into PeopleSoft Billing, we will have to analyze the data format in
the source systems, map the data with PeopleSoft Billing interface tables and develop
a customized interface program to reformat the source data and load it into the
interface tables.
Note that it is not mandatory to insert data in to all of these tables. The organization's
requirements, the information sent by the source system, and so on, will determine
which tables need to be populated. 

Chapter 3
[ 103 ]
The following table describes the set of billing interface tables: 
Table name
Description
INTFC_BI
This is the primary interface table and must be populated for each
bill line that is brought into the PeopleSoft Billing module. It can
contain bill lines belonging to LINE, NOTE and AHDR types.
INTFC_BI2
This interface table is an extension of the INTFC_BI table and
contains extended tax and ship to address information. It can contain
only bill lines belonging to LINE type.
INTFC_BI_AEDS
This interface table holds the accounting entry and discount/
surcharge information. It can contain bill lines belonging to AE, DS
and DDS types.
INTFC_BI_NOTE
This interface table holds the notes and comments information. If a
line in INTFC_BI table has NOTE transaction type, then this table
needs to have a row. 
INTFC_BI_HDR
This interface table holds a single row for the entire bill. It can
contain bill lines belonging to only LINE type.
INTFC_EXSD
This interface table holds excise, sales tax and VAT details that are
relevant for Indian taxes only. It can contain bill lines belonging to
only EXSD type.
INTFC_BI_TAX
This interface table holds sales and use tax details. It can contain bill
lines belonging to only EXSD type. It can contain bill lines belonging
to only TAX type.
So for a hypothetical organization based in the USA which does not have to pay sales
tax on its invoices and does not have any invoice comments, only the INTFC_BI and
INTFC_BI_HDR tables will need to be populated.
Understanding Bill By Identifier
As we discussed earlier, the Billing Interface (BIIF0001) process reads the bill data
from interface tables and loads them into Billing tables. In order to do that, we need
to configure an important option known as Bill By Identifier. 
A Bill By Identifier consolidates the bill lines in interface tables based on the unique
combinations of defined parameters to create new bills. If it finds that an un-invoiced
bill already exists with that combination, it adds the bill line to that bill. Let's take an
example to understand this concept before discussing how to configure it.

PeopleSoft Billing Module
[ 104 ]
Assume that an organization has brought in billing data from an external source that
consists of bill lines for various customers and different orders that they had placed.
Now it wishes to create invoices in such a way that bill lines belonging to the same
customer order and sales person who brought the order are consolidated on a single
invoice. The following table shows the hypothetical bill line data for a customer in
interface tables:
Line 
Customer No.
Order No.
Sales person
Amount

18890
56645
Jim
$1000

18890

6
18890
67741
Jim
$750
7
18890
67741
Jim
$3000
As you can see, salesperson Jim was responsible for bringing in order # 56645 and
selling three items in the order # 67741. Salesperson Tom was instrumental in selling
two items in the order # 67741. 
Now we need to configure a Bill By Identifier with two consolidation parameters:
Order Number and Sales Person. When this is used by the Billing Interface process, 
it will create the following bills:
Bill 1:
Line
Amount
1
$1000
2
$500
Bill 2:
Line
Amount

$2100
2

Follow this navigation to configure a Bill By Identifier: 
Setup Financials/Supply Chain | Product Related | Billing | Setup | Bill-by
Identifier
The following screenshot shows the Bill By Identifier configuration page:
New Bill Status: This value is used by the Billing Interface process to 
assign a status for the newly created bill. Possible options are: New Bill  
(a bill is recently created and awaiting further processing), Hold Bill (a bill
is prevented from further processing unless its value is changed to Ready),
Pending Approval (a bill that needs to be reviewed and approved) and
Ready to Invoice (a bill that is eligible to be picked by the batch process 
and invoiced).
Add to bills with status: As mentioned earlier, if the Billing Interface process
finds that a combination of defined parameters already exists, it adds the 
bill line to that bill rather than creating a new bill. This field determines the
status of the bill to which this new interface line will be added. 
•

PeopleSoft Billing Module
[ 106 ]
Bill By Fields: Fields added in this section determine the consolidation
criteria for bill lines in the interface tables. Based on our example, the fields
are Order Number and Sales Person.
Parameters such as Business Unit, Customer ID, Bill Source and Bill
Type are already implied in the Bill By Identifier and need not be
specified. In other words, the system will always create separate bills
belonging to different customers, BUs, bills sources and bill types.
A Bill By Identifier can be assigned to a bill-to customer, bill source, bill type or a
billing business unit.
Billing Interface (BIIF0001) process
Now that the billing data has been loaded into the interface tables and the Bill By
Identifier has been configured, it's time to run the Billing Interface process to load 
the data into Billing tables and create new bills.
Follow this navigation to run the Billing Interface process: 
Billing | Interface Transactions | Process Billing Interface
The following screenshot shows the run control page from where the Billing
Interface process can be run:
From Interface ID, To Interface ID: Each transaction in the interface tables has

Entering online bills manually
Manual bill entry using online pages is suitable only for a small number of
transactions. Most organizations with high bill volume do not use this feature or
only use it occasionally. Before proceeding with our discussion, let's understand the
various bill statuses and their significance, as shown in the following table:
Bill status
Description
New
This is the status of a bill when it is entered. In this status, it is not
processed by any batch process.
Pending Approval
This status applies to the bill that is submitted for approval after its
creation. This is relevant only if we mandate that bills need to be
approved before they are processed further.
Ready
This status needs to be assigned to a bill to indicate that it is ready to
be invoiced. Billing batch processes select only those invoices with
this status.
Invoiced
This indicates that all the processing for a bill has been completed
and it is now a final invoice that can be sent to the customer.
Now we'll briefly review some important pages used to manually enter bills.
Follow this navigation to enter a new bill:
Billing | Maintain Bills | Standard Billing | Header – Info 1
The following screenshot shows the Bill Header tab where we need to enter details
common to the entire bill:

PeopleSoft Billing Module
[ 108 ]
As you can see, this information pertains to the entire bill. We'll briefly discuss some
of the fields here.
Status: When a bill is manually created, it is assigned a status of New. As long as 
it has this status, it is not processed by any batch processes. Once all the details are
entered and it is ready to be processed, we need to change its status to Ready, so that
it can be picked up by the batch processes. Once all the processing is complete and it
is converted into an invoice, the status automatically changes to Invoiced.
Click the Line – Info 1 tab to enter bill lines.
The following screenshot shows the Bill Line tab where details of bill lines 
are entered:
Table: This field identifies the type of bill line. Available options are: D 
(discount), ID (identifier) and S (surcharge). Value ID denotes goods or
services provided to the customer which is being billed.
Identifier: This field denotes the actual product or service being billed. For
example, we can define various identifiers such as Consulting Services,
Catering Services, 32" LCD TV, 29" LCD TV, and so on, to identify the type 
of service or goods that needs to be billed.
•
•

Chapter 3
[ 109 ]
Line Type: This field is used to categorize the bill line. Some of the available
values are REV (revenue line), FRGT (freight charges), DISC (discount),
SUR (surcharge), and so on.
Now let's see how the bill accounting details are specified. 
From the Navigation dropdown at the right hand bottom corner of the page, select
the Acctg – Rev Distribution option.
The following screenshot shows the Acctg – Rev Distribution tab where revenue
accounting details of selected bill lines are entered:
Code: This field specifies the distribution code for recording the revenue generated
from this bill line. A distribution code is a pre-defined combination of chartfields. It
is used to avoid entering all chartfield values manually. In the previous example, the
revenue will be recorded in the account 403000.
We'll see how to configure distribution codes in the section on configurations. 
If required, we can add multiple revenue lines by using the + button to split the
revenue from this bill line. For example, let's say that revenues from a sale need 
to be shared between two different departments equally. To continue with the
previous example, we can have two revenue lines as shown next by using different
distribution codes:
Code 
Account
Department
Percentage
Amount
REV-DIST1
403000
ABC
50.00
6978.55
REV-DIST2

Online bill entry consists of many pages, all of which cannot be discussed here due
to the pagespace constraints of this book. However the pages discussed previously
should give you a fair idea about the information that goes into manually creating 
a bill.
Understanding billing batch processes
Based on our discussion of the invoice lifecycle, you have now gained some idea 
of how the billing batch processes play an important part in invoice processing. It
would not be wrong to say that these batch processes handle almost every aspect of
invoice processing. In this section, we'll explain these processes. 
The following table lists the billing batch processes in the order they need to be
executed. Note that not all of these processes are mandatory for invoice processing. 
Process
Description
Purpose
BIIF0001
Billing interface 
As discussed earlier, this process loads the bill data
from interface tables into the billing tables and creates
new bills. It is not required if bills are manually
created.
BIPVAT00
Process VAT
defaults
This process applies the Value Added Tax (VAT)
default values for the bill header and bill lines based
on the VAT setups. It is required only if VAT is
applicable to the organization's invoices. VAT is
usually used in European countries.
Bills are now brought into the system or manually entered. They are reviewed and
found to be appropriate. The billing user changes their status to READY. Now they
are eligible for further processing. 
The following batch processes are used to create final invoices and make them 
ready to print:
Process
Description
Purpose
BIIVC000
Bill finalization
This process selects bills with READY status. It performs
the tax calculations for all bill lines based on the tax
codes assigned to them. Once a bill is successfully
validated, it changes the bill's status to INVOICED. This
process is mandatory for invoice processing. No more
changes can be made to the invoice now, unless it is
canceled.

Chapter 3
[ 111 ]
Process
Description
Purpose
BI_IVCEXT
Invoice extract
This process extracts data for printable bills to the
temporary print extract tables. Subsequent print
processes read the data from these temporary tables and
print invoices.
Now the final invoices are ready to be printed. PeopleSoft offers more than 30 batch
processes to print invoices for various specific purposes. We can decide which print
process to execute after BI_IVCEXT, depending on the organization's requirements.
We'll assume that we will use the most appropriate batch process to print our invoices.
The following processes are used to interface the billing invoice data with 
other modules.
Process
Description
Purpose
BICURCNV
Billing 
currency
conversion
This process calculates the bill amounts in base currency
(of the business unit) as well as euro currency in addition
to the transaction currency. This process is mandatory
even if we use only a single currency.
BIPRELD
Billing pre-
load
This process creates accounting entries for the invoices
and loads them in accounting entry staging tables. It also
performs chartfield combination editing for the accounting
entries. 
This process is mandatory to execute subsequent processes
to interface billing data with other modules.
BIGNAP01
Generate AP
vouchers
When the billing module processes inter-unit bills (where
one business unit bills another unit), the selling unit issues
an invoice to the other unit which may have purchased
something. This paying unit needs to pay the invoice
amount by creating a AP voucher. 
This process creates AP voucher data in the three AP
staging tables VCHR_HDR_STG, VCHR_LINE_STG, VCHR_
DIST_STG.
This process is required only if the organization uses inter-
unit bills.
BILDAR01
Load AR
pending items
This process interfaces invoice data to the Accounts
Receivable module. It loads the data into AR pending items
staging table, so that it can be picked by an AR batch process
called AR UPDATE to be loaded into AR tables.
BILDGL01
Load GL
interface
This process creates accounting entries based on the data 
in the staging tables created by the BIPRELD process. The
accounting entries are stored in the BI_ACCT_ENTRY table.
It also creates reversal entries for accrual entries.  

PeopleSoft Billing Module
[ 112 ]
This completes the invoice lifecycle with all necessary billing data being interfaced
with downstream modules.
Performing invoice adjustments
In a typical invoicing process, it is fairly common that an invoice sent out to a
customer will need to be modified. Consider the following scenarios:
• 
An invoice for customer A is accidentally created for customer B. Now
customer B contacts us and wants us to cancel the bill.
• 
A customer complains that he received an invoice for something that he
never purchased. 
• 
A customer purchases products A, B and C but finds that we have sent him
an invoice for products A, B and D. Now we need to correct the bill line with
product D and change it to product C.
• 
A discount of 10% was promised to a customer on purchase of a certain
product. However, when he receives the invoice, he finds that he did not
receive the discount. He now wants us to apply the promised discount on the
invoice amount and resend the corrected invoice.
These are only a few possible situations where we need to make adjustments to
customer invoices. 
PeopleSoft Billing offers two ways of adjusting invoices:
Adjust the entire bill
Adjust specific bill lines
We'll quickly go through these methods to understand how to perform 
invoice adjustments.
Adjusting the entire bill
Consider the first scenario from our previous list, where the invoice for customer 
A was accidentally billed to customer B. What would be the corrective action for 
this case? You are right if you answered - "Cancel the invoice sent to customer B 
and create a new invoice for customer A".
Now how can we handle the second scenario in the list? Of course, we would
check if the customer had really purchased something from us. If he/she had not
purchased anything, we would have to cancel the invoice that we had sent.
We can use the adjustment for entire bill option for such scenarios.
•
•

Chapter 3
[ 113 ]
Follow this navigation to adjust an entire bill: 
Billing | Maintain Bills | Adjust Entire Bills
The following screenshot shows the Adjust Entire Bills page:
No Bill Action: When this option is selected, the system doesn't take 
any action.
Credit Entire Bill: With this option selected, the system credits (reverses) the
selected bill. The newly created credit bill is created in READY status, so it
can be picked up by the Bill Finalization process. For example, if we wish to
credit a bill with amount of $500, a new bill for the same customer is created
with an amount of -$500, which in effect cancels the original bill. As you can
see, this option is ideal for the second scenario listed previously.
Credit & Rebill: When this option is selected, the system creates a credit bill
for original bill and then creates a copy of the original bill with a status of
NEW, which you can edit as required. For example, if we wish to credit and
rebill a bill with amount of $500, a new bill for the same customer is created
with an amount of -$500. In addition, another bill similar to the original bill
($500) is created. Now we can correct the customer on this newly created bill.
This option is ideal for the first scenario listed previously.
Adjustment Reason: It is mandatory to provide a reason for adjustment.
Adjustment Results: This section shows the invoice ID that the system
will assign to the newly created credit bill and Rebill bill. In the previous
screenshot, the system automatically assigns the next invoice number.
Adjusting selected bill lines
Consider the third scenario from the previous list. In this case, we do not need to
cancel the entire invoice and reissue a new one. We can simply change the bill line
three to reflect the correct value.

For the fourth scenario, again, we can simply adjust the line and add the 
appropriate discount.
Follow this navigation to adjust specific lines on the bill: 
Billing | Maintain Bills | Adjust Selected Bill Lines
The following screenshot shows the Adjust Selected Bill Lines page:
No Bill Action: When this option is selected, the system doesn't take 
any action.
Adjust Selected Lines: Select this option to modify any bill lines. Check the
Select checkbox next to any bill line(s) to adjust it.
Add to Existing Bill: Select this checkbox to add a new line to the 
existing bill.
Line Opt: This option determines how the selected line needs to be adjusted.
The available options are:
Create net adjustment only: System creates only one adjustment line
Create reversal and rebill: System creates two new lines – one to
credit the selected line and the other to make any adjustments (recall
the entire bill adjustment options)
Credit line: System credits the selected bill line
For the third and fourth scenario, we can use the Create reversal and rebill option
for invoice line for product D, so that it is canceled. Then we can use the correct
product C in the new line that is generated.

For the fourth scenario, we can either use the Create net adjustment only option 
to add the missing discount or use the same option as the third scenario.
The system creates a new bill containing the line adjustments.
Deferred revenue processing and
unbilled revenue accrual
The most straight-forward scenario in customer invoicing includes the 
following steps:
An organization sells some goods/services to a customer
An invoice is created and sent out
The customer pays the invoice amount and the invoice is closed in 
Accounts Receivable
In this case, a typical accounting entry for the invoice is as follows:
DR Accounts Receivable
CR Revenue
In other words, we recognize the revenue and record the receivable (from the
customer) at the same time. However, there are many situations where this is not
possible due to various reasons. 
Sometimes, even if we invoice a customer, we cannot recognize the revenue and
need to defer (postpone) the revenue recognition. This is known as deferred revenue
processing. On the other hand, sometimes, we need to recognize the revenue, even if
we have not invoiced the customer. This is known as unbilled revenue accrual. 
Deferred revenue processing
Consider a customer invoice for the amount of $1000 is created with 1/1/2011 as
its accounting date. As seen previously, under normal circumstances, Billing would
create the following accounting entry:
Accounting date
Debit/Credit
Account
Amount
1/1/2011 
DR
Accounts Receivable
$1000
1/1/2011 
CR
Revenue
-$1000
Thus, we have recognized the entire revenue in one go.
•
•
•
•
•

PeopleSoft Billing Module
[ 116 ]
Now let's assume that, due to contractual terms, we need to recognize the revenue
equally over four months, on the first day of each month. In other words, we need
to recognize $250 every month for four months. In such a scenario, in the first
month we can recognize only partial revenue, while the remaining amount needs
to be recorded using another account called Deferred Revenue account. We then
progressively go on recognizing remaining amounts of revenue from the deferred
revenue account. 
The deferred revenue accounting entries for this scenario are created as follows:
Accounting date
Debit/Credit
Account
Amount
In month 1, out of $1000, only $250 is recognized as revenue, while the rest is recorded as
deferred revenue.
1/1/2011 
DR
Accounts Receivable
$1000
1/1/2011 
CR
Revenue 
-$250
1/1/2011 
CR
Deferred Revenue
-$750
In month 2, further $250 revenue will be recognized by reducing the amount of deferred
revenue.
2/1/2011 
DR
Deferred Revenue
$250
2/1/2011
CR
Revenue
-$250
In month 2, further $250 revenue will be recognized by reducing the amount of deferred
revenue.
3/1/2011 
DR
Deferred Revenue
$250
3/1/2011
CR
Revenue
-$250
In month 4, remaining $250 revenue will be recognized, completing revenue recognition.
4/1/2011 
DR
Deferred Revenue
$250
4/1/2011
CR
Revenue
-$250
This is just one of the various methods by which recognized revenue is prorated
(spread) across 4 months (equally for each period). PeopleSoft Billing provides
following revenue proration methods:
Spread by days within range
Spread evenly across all periods
Spread evenly using a mid-period rule
Spread partial periods by days with remainder spread evenly
User-defined proration
In order to use deferred revenue processing for invoices, we need to configure
deferred revenue distribution codes.

Chapter 3
[ 117 ]
Entering bills for deferred revenue processing is similar to regular bills. The only
additional steps required are as follows:
1. Specifying the revenue recognition basis date such as ship date, order date,
and so on. 
2. Providing the respective date or date range
3. Specifying the deferred revenue distribution codes
Unbilled revenue accrual
Consider a scenario where we are executing a three month long contract for a
customer. We'll be completing 1/3 of total work in each month. According to
contract terms, we can invoice the customer only after the work is completed at 
the end of the third month. Let's say that the total contract value is $3000. Now,
according to accounting convention, we can recognize revenue as the work is
delivered. In other words, we can recognize $1000 at the end of the first month, $1000
more at the end of the second month and $1000 more at the end of the third month. 
At the end of each accounting period, we recognize the revenue but record it to 
the Unbilled AR account instead of the regular AR account. In each subsequent
period, we then reverse these accounting entries as they are not invoiced. In the 
final accounting period, we recognize the entire revenue and record it to the actual
AR account.
This revenue is called Unbilled Revenue, as we are not going to bill it to the customer.
The unbilled revenue accounting entries for this scenario are created as follow:
Accounting date
Debit/Credit
Account
Amount
At the end of 1st month, we recognize $1000
1/31/2011 
DR
Unbilled AR
$1000
1/31/2011 
CR
Revenue
-$1000
At the beginning of 2nd month, reverse the earlier entries
2/1/2011
DR
Revenue
$1000
2/1/2011
CR
Unbilled AR
-$1000
At the end of 2nd month, we recognize additional $1000, that is, $2000 revenue
2/28/2011 
DR
Unbilled AR

In order to use the unbilled revenue accrual, we need to configure, unbilled AR
distribution code and associate it with regular AR distribution code. The batch
process Load GL – Unbilled Revenue Accrual (BIACCRUE) is executed to create
accrual accounting entries. We'll see other necessary setup options for this in the next

Understanding important billing
configurations
So far we have familiarized ourselves with the basic business process and the system
features used by the PeopleSoft Billing module. Now we will understand some of
the important configurations that enable these business processes. We'll discuss the
following configuration options, which are not necessarily set up in the same order:
Invoice number IDs
Bill types
Bill sources
Invoice formatting and printing options
Distribution codes
Billing charge codes
Discounts and surcharges
Billing business unit
Configuring invoice number IDs
PeopleSoft Billing offers a flexible invoice numbering structure that enables the
creation of various conventions for invoice numbers.

Let's assume that Global Vehicles Inc. needs to number its invoices in the format 
GV-US-XXXXXXXXXX. The first part of the invoice ID is static where GV denotes
Global Vehicles. The second segment indicates the geography (such as the US) and
the last segment will denote the 10-digit invoice ID. 
Billing allows us to structure invoice IDs with up to three segments. Only one of
these segments can be auto-sequenced (a term which means the system automatically
increments the number). The total length of the invoice ID cannot exceed 22 digits.
Follow this navigation to configure the invoice number ID: 
Set Up Financials/Supply Chain | Product Related | Billing | Setup | Invoice
Number ID
The following screenshot shows the Invoice Number ID configuration page:
User definable: Selecting a checkbox in this section allows a user to assign 
an invoice ID to new bills or bills that need adjustments. Leaving it
unchecked means that the system forces the invoice ID by incrementing 
the last invoice ID. 
Expert tip:
It is advisable to leave these checkboxes unchecked so that users cannot
assign inconsistent IDs to invoices and create invoice IDs with gaps or
different lengths.

Static/Auto Sequenced/None: If a segment is not required, select None.
Select Static for a segment where the value remains the same or Auto
Sequenced to let the system automatically increment it. 
Configuring distribution codes
A distribution code is a pre-defined collection of chartfield values. We specify a
distribution code so that the system knows which chartfields to use while creating
accounting entries. For example, we can specify a distribution code for an AR
account, one for a deferred revenue account, unbilled revenue and so on.
Follow this navigation to configure distribution codes:

The following screenshot shows the Distribution Code configuration page:
This example shows the distribution code for an AR account to be used in billing
accounting entries.
Distribution Type: This dropdown menu specifies the type of distribution
code. Some of the values include Revenue (to be used for revenue accounts),
Discount (to be used to specify distribution codes for bill discounts), Unbill
AR (for unbilled revenue accrual), and so on.
Unbilled AR Distribution Code: If we use the unbilled revenue accrual, we
need to link the AR distribution code with an unbilled AR distribution code.
Specify that value in this field.
Chartfield values: Specify actual chartfield values used to record the
amounts for this type of accounting entries.

Configuring invoice formatting options
Invoice printing is an important activity and each organization has its own unique
needs regarding what the invoice should look like. Invoice requirements cover
various parameters, such as:
Layout: Should the invoice be printed in the portrait or landscape mode?
Grouping: How should the bill lines be grouped (such as by product ID)?
Summarization: Should a summary invoice be printed along with the
detailed invoice?
Discount, surcharge and tax: Should the invoice display discount, surcharge
and tax information on the invoice? If so, where should this information  
be printed?
Notes: Where should the invoice header and line notes (comments) 
be printed?
All of these and more options are configured using Invoice Formatting Options.

amounts should be printed, if these they should be added to or deducted
from the bill line amount or if they should be printed separately for each 
bill line.
Discounts / Surcharges – Total Options: This section determines how
discount and surcharge amount totals are printed on invoice, for example
if the net amount is shown in one bill total, separate totals for discount and
surcharge are shown or no totals are shown.
Taxes – Line Options: This section controls how or if the bill line tax
amounts are displayed on invoices.
Taxes – Total Options: This section controls how the total tax amount is
displayed on invoices.
The following screenshot shows the Header Notes tab of the invoice formatting
configuration page. This tab is used to control header notes printing options.
Header notes are used to record comments about the entire invoice. For example, we
may print a note on each invoice that instructs the customer about a new discount
scheme that is going on. Note types are configured separately before setting up
invoice formatting options. 
Specify the appropriate note type for primary or secondary notes. We can have
multiple invoice header notes.
The Line Notes tab is used to control line notes printing options.

Configuring billing charge codes
We saw how billing charge codes are entered on the billing entry page. In many
cases, the billing module receives data from the Order Management, Project Costing
or Contracts modules in the form of customer orders. In this case, the product 
or service ID being sold comes from the interface. However, if bills are entered
manually, we need to specify the activity which needs to be billed. This is where 
we need to configure charge codes.
Follow this navigation to configure billing charge codes: 
Set Up Financials/Supply Chain | Product Related | Billing | Setup | Charge
Code
The following screenshot shows the Charge Code tab of the configuration page:
Unit of Measure: This field specifies the unit of measure for the given
product or service activity.
List Price: Specify the price per unit of this product or service activity.
Revenue Distribution Code: Specify the distribution code to record the
revenue from this activity. Recall our earlier discussion on how to configure
distribution codes.
Revenue Recognition Basis: This field is used to specify the revenue
recognition basis for deferred revenue process. If the basis value is Invoice
Date, deferred revenue processing is not done. Any other value, such as Ship
Date, instructs the system to perform deferred revenue processing with the
selected value as revenue recognition basis. 
Charge Code 2 tab contains the options to control VAT processing.

[ 125 ]
Configuring discounts and surcharges
In the course of regular business processing, discounts are offered or surcharges
(additional charges on invoice amounts) are applied to invoices. A discount will
reduce the invoice amount, while a surcharge will increase it. We can define as many
discount or surcharge codes as required. These can be defined as are fixed amounts
or as percentages of bill amounts. Follow this navigation to configure codes for
discounts and surcharges: 
Set Up Financials/Supply Chain | Product Related | Billing | Setup | Discount 
& Surcharge 
The following screenshot shows the Discount & Surcharge configuration page:
Distribution code: Specify the distribution code to record the discount 
or surcharge amount
Type: Specify if this is a discount or surcharge
Computation Basis: As discussed earlier, we can specify if this needs to be
a fixed amount (such as $50) or a percentage of the invoice line amount to
which it is applied (5% in this example)
Configuring billing business unit
Billing business unit represents an entity within an organization that needs 
to maintain its own invoices. This can be a country for a global organization, 
a separate business line, or any other entity as required.

Before we proceed to understanding  how to configure a business unit, let's first
understand the hierarchy of Billing setups. The following table shows the hierarchy
levels for billing:
Hierarchy 
Configuration
Level 1 (Top) 
Business unit
Level 2 
Bill type
Level 3 
Bill source
Level 4 
Customer
Level 5 (Bottom)
Bill entry
What this means is that configuration options set up at the business unit level are
inherited by all the levels below. If the system doesn't find a configuration value at
any of the lower levels, it looks for that option at the higher level. Thus if the system
doesn't find a value on the bill, it looks for it at the customer level. If it is not found
there, it looks for it at the bill source level and so on. A configuration option specified
at a lower level always supersedes the value specified at the higher level. 
Expert tip:
Take advantage of the configuration hierarchy by specifying the default
options that will be used in most of the cases, at the highest level (that
is, Business Unit). All levels below will inherit it. This avoids repeating
configurations at all the levels. If the configuration value needs to be
different at a particular level, we can specify it for that specific level.

BI Creates Acctg Entries: If selected, PeopleSoft Billing (Billing pre-
load batch process) creates accounting entries for invoices. When
billing data is interfaced to Accounts Receivable, accounting entries
are loaded along with invoice details.

AR Level: This option drives how billing invoices are tracked in the AR
module. The available values are as follows:
Header is AR Open Item: If selected, the AR module creates an open
item for each bill for tracking. For example, for an invoice containing
3 lines for $100, $200 and $300, AR creates a single item of $600 for
follow up with the customer.
Bill Line is AR Open Item: If selected, the AR module creates an
open item for each bill line for tracking. In the previous example, 
AR creates 3 open items for $100, $200 and $300 for follow up with
the customer.
AR Option: This field controls how the accounting distribution details are
passed on from Billing invoices to AR open items. Available values are  
as follows:
Use Header for Distribution: This value can be selected only if we
select Header is AR Open Item for the AR Level field. As we saw,
this means that there is only one open item for the entire invoice and
the bill header accounting information is sent to AR.
Use Line for Distribution: This option can be selected for both of
the values of AR Level field. If selected, the bill line accounting
information for each bill line is sent to AR.

Tax Liability Account: This field stores the distribution code for recording
amounts arising from tax liability on invoices. This section is visible only if
we use Vertex or Taxware.
Enable Deferred Revenues: We have discussed the concept of deferred
revenue an the earlier section. To enable the system to process deferred
revenue, this checkbox has to be selected. 
Proration Method: Specify one of the proration methods to be used to
calculate how much revenue can be recognized and the amount that needs to
be deferred.
Future Period Accounting Dates: This option determines what accounting
date needs to be used for future dated accounting entries. Recall that
deferred revenue processing creates such entries.  
Entry Type/Reason Code: When the AR module creates the accounting
entries for invoices, it needs to know the chartfields (including accounts) to
be used for debit and credit entries. In order to do that, we configure entry
types and entry reasons in the AR module. The Load AR Pending Items
process needs to provide these values while sending the data from Billing 
to Accounts Receivable. If the invoice itself does not contain the necessary
accounting details, it looks at the accounting defaults specified in this section. 
Here we need to specify the values for debit as well as credit entries. We'll see how to
configure entry types and entry reasons in the Accounts Receivable chapter.

Configuring bill types
A bill type categorizes the billing transactions to segregate them on separate bills.
The bill type allows various processing options to be configured that determine how
bills from that particular bill type are processed. Bill type is the second level of the
billing hierarchy and inherits all options defined for the business unit.
Let's try to understand how bill types can be used. Consider an organization which
is part of a group of companies. It sells its products to external customers as well as
sister companies in the same group. Now if it wishes to separate the invoices issued
to group companies from the invoices issued to external customers, it can use the
bill types to do so. It can configure two separate bill types (let's say INTERNAL and
EXTERNAL) for this purpose. It can also configure various options to process these
differently if needed. This is just one example of how bill types can be used. Assume
that this firm sells products as well as performing professional services. If needed, 
it can define two bill types: such as PRODUCTS and SERVICES to segregate items on
different invoices. 
Follow this navigation to configure a bill type:
Set Up Financials/Supply Chain | Product Related | Billing | Setup | Bill Type
The following screenshot shows the Bill Type 1 tab of the bill type page: 
Entry Type/Reason: We saw that default entry type and reason values are
defined for business units. If these need to be different for invoices from this
bill type, specify the same here.

Bill By Identifier: Specify the bill by identifier to be used for summarizing
bill lines from the interface. 
Invoice Form: This field specifies the pre-defined invoice formatting options
that we saw earlier.
AR Distribution Code: This field specifies the distribution code for Accounts
Receivable chartfields to be used for invoices having this bill type.
The following screenshot shows the Bill Type 2 tab of the bill type page: 
Invoice Number ID: This field specifies the invoice numbering scheme to be
used for this bill type.
Page Series ID: The billing entry component contains a large number of
pages. Using a page series definition, we can specify the order in which 
these options should be displayed by the system. Specify the page series ID
in this field.
Attach Invoice Image Option: We saw this configuration option at the
business unit level. If we wish to specify a value to enable or disable invoice
imaging for this bill type, select the appropriate value.
Deferred Revenue Options: If deferred revenue processing is being used,
specify the revenue recognition basis (when the revenue can be recognized in
future) and provide the distribution code to record deferred revenue. 
If the revenue recognition basis is Invoice Date, the system assumes
that deferred revenue is not applicable.

The following screenshot shows the Bill Type 3 tab of the bill type page. 
We saw that all these options existed at the business unit as well. If they need 
to be different for this bill type, specify the appropriate values in this tab.
Configuring bill sources
Bill data can originate from various sources. An organization may receive bills from
a non-PeopleSoft system or other PeopleSoft modules such as Order Management,
Contracts, and so on. A bill source enables us to track the origin of each bill and
assign default configuration values.
Bill source is the third level of billing hierarchy and it inherits the configuration
options from the business unit and bill type levels. Follow this navigation to
configure a bill source:

Note that you'll notice that most of the configuration options on these pages will be
seen on the bill type pages as well. The following screenshot shows the Bill Source
tab of the bill source page. 
All of the configuration options inherit values defined from higher levels of the
hierarchy. If we wish to specify a different value for this bill source, we can do it
here. For others, we can simply leave the fields blank, so that the system can pick it
up from the bill type.
The following screenshot shows the Bill Source 2 tab of the bill source page. 
Leave these fields blank if the configuration values are same as that of the bill type.

Specify a different value for VAT controls for this bill source, if required.
Now that we have familiarized ourselves with the Billing business processes and
important configurations, let's us consider some typical situations that arise during
Billing implementation.
Implementation challenge 1
An organization wishes that invoices for one of its customers should not be printed,
while for others, invoice printing should take place. Assume that all the customers
use same bill type.
Solution
Recall the invoice formatting configuration we discussed earlier. The General tab
contains a Print Form checkbox. Leaving this checkbox unchecked ensures that the
invoice will not be printed. We'll need to perform the following configurations to
achieve this objective:
Configure an invoice form with Print Form field checked to enable invoice
printing. Let's call this invoice form PRINT.
Configure another invoice form with Print Form field unchecked to disable
invoice printing. Let's call this invoice form NOPRINT.
Attach the PRINT invoice form to the bill type to be used.
Attach the NOPRINT invoice form to the customer whose invoices should
not be printed.
For all other customers leave the invoice form field blank.
•

PeopleSoft Billing Module
[ 136 ]
We know that in billing hierarchy, the customer comes at a level lower than that of
the bill type. As a result, any configuration value defined at customer level overrides
the value defined for the bill type. Thus, for all the regular customers, when the
system does not find an invoice form value, it uses the value PRINT defined for the
higher level: bill type. On the other hand, for all invoices belonging to the specific
customer, it uses the value NOPRINT and the system automatically prevents the
printing of its invoices.
Implementation challenge 2
An organization sells two types of products: diagnostic equipment and surgical
supplies. It receives the bill data for these from an external non-PeopleSoft system.
It needs to ensure that bill data for surgical supplies are summarized by Customer
and Order number, while the bill data for diagnostic equipment are summarized
by Customer and Contract number. Invoices for diagnostic equipment and surgical
supplies should be printed in the portrait and landscape formats respectively.
Solution
We need to perform the following steps for this requirement:
Configure two bill types. Let's call them SURGICAL and DIAGNOSTIC.
A customized interface program needs to be developed to load the bill data
into Billing interface tables. The code should populate the values SURGICAL
and DIAGNOSTIC for appropriate bills in the bill type field of interface table.
Configure two Bill By Identifiers. Let's call them CUST_ORDER and CUST_
CONTRACT. 
Specify Customer ID and Order Number as summarizing parameters for
CUST_ORDER bill by identifier.
Specify Customer ID and Contract Number as summarizing parameters for
CUST_CONTRACT bill by identifier.
Configure two invoice forms: LANDSCAPE and PORTRAIT. Specify the
appropriate print layouts for both.
Now attach the invoice form and bill by identifier to the bill type as shown:

Thus, when the Billing Interface batch process encounters a bill for surgical supplies
in the interface table, it reads the bill type value SURGICAL. When it refers to this 
bill type definition, it retrieves PORTRAIT as the invoice form and CUST_CONTRACT 
as the bill by identifier. Thus it knows that the bill lines need to be summarized 
by Customer ID and Contract number, while the invoice needs to be printed in
PORTRAIT layout
Summary
Bills can be entered into the system manually or brought in through the Billing
interface. PeopleSoft offers a set of interface tables which act as a staging area for bills
coming from other PeopleSoft modules such as Order Management, Contracts, and
so on or external non-PeopleSoft systems. A batch process known as Billing Interface
reads the data from interface tables, performs the validations and creates bills in the
Billing system. This option is suitable for high volumes of billing data.
A set of batch processes perform various operations such as finalizing the bill,
printing invoices, creating accounting entries, and interfacing the bill data to 
other PeopleSoft modules such as General Ledger, Accounts Receivable, and
Accounts Payable. 
If created invoices need to be modified, PeopleSoft offers two methods to do so:
crediting entire bill or crediting specific bill lines. In Billing module, we can handle
various scenarios such as Deferred Revenues (where revenue recording can be
deferred to future accounting dates) and Unbilled Revenue Accrual (where revenue
is recognized even though an invoice is not created).


PeopleSoft Accounts
Receivable Module
Accounts Receivable is an important module in the 'Order to Cash' business process.
It comes into the picture after the Billing processes that we have discussed in the
previous chapter. At any given time, a typical organization has a large number of
outstanding invoices, which are not yet paid by its customers. Ensuring that they
are tracked regularly, payments are received from customers within promised
timelines, and corrective actions are taken if payments are delayed is critical for the
organization's functioning. This task has a direct impact on its cash flows. Accounts
Receivable (or AR, as it is commonly known) performs these critical functions and
presents a picture of outstanding amounts owed by the organization's customers. 
In a nutshell, the AR module is responsible for the entry of items (outstanding
invoices), handling customer payments, managing customer invoices, and creating
customer correspondence such customer statements and dunning letters.
In this chapter, we'll gain an understanding of important AR processes and
configurations that are required.

PeopleSoft Accounts Receivable Module
[ 140 ]
Understanding Accounts Receivable
process flow
Before we start our discussion of Accounts Receivable processes, let's first
understand two most commonly used AR terms: pending items and items. We said
earlier that customer invoices are interfaced from the Billing module (although it is
not the only source for AR). When these transactions (from various sources) enter
the AR system, they are known as pending items. They are still not part of the total
customer balance. A batch process known as Receivables Update later posts these
pending items to the customer accounts and updates the outstanding balance. Now
these transactions are referred to as items. In other words, a transaction that is part
of a total customer account balance is an item, while a transaction that is still waiting
to be posted to a customer account is a pending item.
Let's consider a simple example to understand this. Assume that the total
outstanding balance for a customer is $1000. Now the Billing module sends two
more invoices: INVOICE 1 for $100 and INVOICE 2 for $200 to AR. The Load AR
Pending Items (BILDAR01) process creates two pending items in the AR system
for these invoices. Even after they are created, the customer balance is still $1,000, 
as these invoices are not yet posted to the customer account. Now let's assume that
the Receivable Update process picks up INVOICE 1 and posts it. Thus, the customer
outstanding balance is now $1,100. In other words, INVOICE 1 is now an item, while
INVOICE 2 is still a pending item, waiting to be posted. When the AR UPDATE process
picks up INVOICE 2 and posts it, the customer balance is updated to $1,300. Now
both INVOICE 1 and INVOICE 2 are items in AR. In the PeopleSoft AR module,
pending items are always entered as part of a group, known as a pending item
group. A pending item can never be a stand-alone entity.
The following schematic shows the typical AR steps:

Chapter 4
[ 141 ]
Note that the previous diagram is a simplified illustration of AR activities in a 
logical sequence. It is not necessary that the displayed activities have to occur in the
exact same sequence as shown. Some activities can take place in parallel as well. For
the sake of simplicity and due to the page constraints, we will only discuss certain
AR processes.
The AR process begins with the pending item entry, either manually or through 
an automated interface. Pending items can be brought in from other PeopleSoft
modules such as Billing, Purchasing, and so on using, delivered PeopleSoft programs
or from non-PeopleSoft systems using a customized programs. PeopleSoft AR also
offers an option to enter pending items manually.
As discussed previously, the Receivable Update (AR UPDATE) batch process is
executed to validate and post these pending items to the appropriate customer
account. Note that this process needs to be executed after performing any transaction
(such as application of a payment to close an item, write off an item, and so on) that
results in change of customer balance. 
Once the pending items are transformed into items and customer balance is updated,
there are various transactions that may need to be performed. These transactions
include writing off an item (partially or completely) due to various reasons,
matching a debit item with a credit item, transferring an item to a different customer,
and so on. Such activities are known as item maintenance. A utility known as the
Maintenance Worksheet is used to perform item maintenance manually.
One of the important functions of the AR module is performing aging of items. This
means tracking how long an item is outstanding after its creation. PeopleSoft offers 
a batch job to categorize items in various user-defined categories such as 0-30 days 
/ 30-60 days / 60-90 days, and so on, and process them as required. Note that these
categories are created based entirely on an organization's requirements. This process
is critical to generating various aging reports to get a snapshot of how effective an
organization is in collecting payments from its customers.
We can generate customer correspondence such as customer statements (listing
outstanding invoices and received payments), dunning letters (to notify that a
customer has exceeded the due date for an invoice), or follow-up letters. 
The AR module is responsible for handling the payments from customers for the
invoices sent to them. PeopleSoft offers the ability to enter payments manually 
or electronically using methods such as lockbox (payment file from a bank), EDI,
Electronic Fund Transfer (EFT) and through spreadsheets. As you can imagine,
manual payment entry is suitable only for small payment volumes. In PeopleSoft
AR module, payments (manual or electronic) are always entered as part of a group,
known as deposits. Thus a deposit can contain one or more payments. A payment
can never exist without a deposit.

PeopleSoft Accounts Receivable Module
[ 142 ]
Finally, when customer payments are received, they need to be applied to the open
(outstanding) invoices. There are two methods to achieve this. A utility known as
Payment Worksheet is used to manually apply payments to open items. A batch
process known as Payment Predictor is used to automate the payment application
based on the rules configured for the same. Once payment is applied to an item, it 
is considered closed, the outstanding amount from the customer is closed and it is
not tracked any more. Note that this is only one of the many possible ways to close
an item.
Now we'll take a detailed look at the steps and configurations involved in each of
these processes.
Understanding pending item accounting
We briefly discussed that pending items can be manually entered or loaded into
PeopleSoft through an automated interface. In order to process these pending items,
we first need to establish the necessary structure in the form of system function IDs,
entry types and entry reasons. We'll explain these configurations now.
System function ID
PeopleSoft delivers a group of system functions to specify all the different activities
that can be performed within the AR module. Each system function specifies the
accounting entries created by the system for a particular transaction. The following
table shows the system function types:
System
function type
Description
DD
Direct debit: This is a form of receiving customer payments electronically
DM
Draft management: This is another form of customer payments
FC
Finance (Overdue) charges: These are the additional charges applied to a
customer in the case of a late payment
IT
Item entry: This relates to the entry of customer invoices/debit memos
(which increase customer outstanding balance) or credit memos (which
decrease customer outstanding balance)
MT
Item maintenance: These transactions include item refunds, write-offs,
and so on using maintenance worksheets or Automatic Maintenance
batch process

Chapter 4
[ 143 ]
System
function type
Description
TR
Transfer worksheet: This relates to transferring an item from one
customer to another 
WS
Payment processing: These transactions include payment applications,
pre-payments, discount processing and so on using worksheets and
Payment predictor
As you can see, these system function types cover all of the possible AR activities
that can create accounting entries. There are multiple system functions belonging
to each group. For example, the IT system function type contains following system
function IDs:
IT-01: Create an Invoice/Debit Memo
IT-02: Create a Credit Memo
The accounting entry structure for each system function ID is defined
by the system and cannot be changed.
Follow this navigation to review system function ID configuration:

System Functions
The following screenshot shows the System Function 1 tab of the page:
•
•

PeopleSoft Accounts Receivable Module
[ 144 ]
Entry Function: This is a system-defined field, that cannot be changed. 
Two of the possible values in this field are Auto Entry and Item Entry. 
These indicate the two different categories of entry types. Automatic entry
types indicate those items that are created by the system in the background,
while Item Entry types indicate the items that are manually created or
brought into AR by an external interface. We'll discuss this in more detail 
in the next section.
Natural Sign: This field shows the sign to be used for the item using this
system function. For example, an item belonging to IT-01 system function
will have positive amount (which will increase the customer's outstanding
balance), while an item with IT-02 system function will have negative
amount (which will decrease the customer's outstanding balance). 
The following screenshot shows the System Function 2 tab of the page:
This tab shows the accounting entry that the system creates for an item belonging
to this system function. Some system functions have both the debit and credit
accounting lines defined. In these cases, the system creates the complete accounting
entry. On the other hand, some system functions have only one accounting line
(either debit or credit) defined by the system. The other line is user-defined and
needs to be specified during configuration of item entry or automatic entry type.
Each AR item needs to have an item entry type or automatic entry type. Each item
entry type or automatic entry type in turn is linked to a system function ID. This is
how the system generates appropriate accounting entries for items.
Understanding entry types and entry reasons
Entry types are one of the most critical building blocks of AR module. An entry type
is used to categorize items. We have already seen various categories used by the
system functions. Entry types essentially build on that foundation. Each AR item
must have an entry type. 
For example, we can have an entry type such as Invoice used for invoices coming
in from Billing systems. It will be linked to the IT-01 system function. We may
have another entry type named Debit Memo used for additional charges created 
•
•

Chapter 4
[ 145 ]
for a customer. As it is similar in function to an invoice (it increases a customer's
outstanding balance), it can be again linked to IT-01 system function. As another
example, we may need an entry type called Credit Memo for invoice credits coming
from Billing (recall our discussion on credit invoices). It can be linked to the IT-02
system function. It is immaterial what name we use for these entry types.
The decision about how many and which entry types are needed depends entirely 
on which PeopleSoft AR features we need to use. For example, if we wish to handle
customer payments, we need the entry type Payments. As you can imagine, this entry
type will be based on a system function from the WS category of system functions.
Entry reasons are used to further categorize the items belonging to an entry type.
For example, if we have an entry type called Invoice, we can define various entry
reasons to specify different types of invoices, such as Consulting, System integration,
Hardware sales, and so on. 
Configuring entry types and entry reasons
PeopleSoft delivers various pre-defined entry types. We can decide to use them as
delivered or modify them as needed. Follow this navigation to configure entry types:
Set Up Financials/Supply Chain | Product Related | Receivables | Options |
Entry
Type | Entry Type
The following screenshot shows the Entry Types tab of the configuration page:

PeopleSoft Accounts Receivable Module
[ 146 ]
Don't Post Duplicate Entries: In AR processing, the same item can have
multiple entry types during its lifecycle. For example, an item numbered
1000 can have an entry type IN (Invoice) when it is created. Later, when it is
paid, system creates the item ID 1000 with an entry type of PY (Payment). If
the system encounters same items with different entry types, the one with
this option selected takes precedence while posting.
You should select this option only for the entry types
representing Invoices.
Aging Exceptions: We briefly saw how the aging process categorizes the
items in defined categories. Specify the aging category options if you wish
to age items with this entry type differently from the normal aging process.
We'll discuss this in detail in the aging section.
Correspondence: Specify if the item with this entry type should be included
in the dunning letters, customer statements or overdue charging process. 
The following screenshot shows the Entry Reasons tab of the configuration page:
As mentioned earlier, entry reasons are used to further categorize items with an
entry type. We can specify as many entry reasons as we wish. These are used by
the automatic entry types and item entry types. Entry Types and Entry Reasons
combinations are used to derive the accounting details for AR transactions.

Chapter 4
[ 147 ]
Item entry types and automatic entry types
Item entry types and automatic entry types represent the two subsets of entry types.
During the item processing, the system creates certain pending items automatically
in the background, while some pending items are manually entered (or brought into
the system from external sources). For example, when we apply a customer payment
to an item, the system automatically creates a pending item with 'Payment' entry
some type. We cannot really enter a pending item with this entry type. Such entry
types are known as Automatic entry types. On the other hand, we can manually
enter pending items such as invoices, debit items or credit items. Such entry types
are known as Item entry types. 
When we configure the item entry types and automatic entry types, we are
essentially marking the existing entry types appropriately using the item entry 
or automatic entry type page. 
Configuring item entry types
We need to set up an item entry type by linking an existing entry type to an
appropriate system function ID and specifying other accounting entry options. 
Follow this navigation to configure item entry types:
Set Up Financials/Supply Chain | Product Related | Receivables | Payments |
Item Entry Type
The following screenshot shows the Selection tab of the configuration page:
two options are available for item entry types: IT-01 and IT-02. 
System Function ID: Link the item entry type to a system function. Only  
•

PeopleSoft Accounts Receivable Module
[ 148 ]
We can create as many item entry types (of course we need to create entry
types first) as we wish and link them to the same system function. For 
example, we can have three item entry types IN (Invoice), DR (Debit memo),
and CC (Customer charge), which all represent additional charges to the
customer and link them to IT-01 system function.
Deciding which item entry types to configure is one of the most critical
aspects in an AR implementation. We need to thoroughly analyze an
organization's reporting requirements to understand how it wishes to
segregate the items and handle their accounting treatment. This drives
the different item entry types and their accounting options.
Distribute to GL: If this checkbox is selected, accounting entries created
for this item entry type are distributed (sent) to General Ledger. Leave it
unchecked if an item entry type is created for a specific purpose and its
accounting entries should not be posted to GL.
Entry reasons: Specify the entry reasons in these rows that need to be used
for this item entry type.
AR Distribution Code: Specify the chartfield combination to be used for the
system generated accounting line.
Recall that the IT-01 system function creates only the debit side of the accounting
entry using the AR distribution code, while the credit side is user-defined.
We can specify different AR distribution codes for different entry reasons. For each
entry reason's user-defined side, specify the accounting details on the Accounting
Template tab.
The following screenshot shows the Accounting Template tab where the credit side
of the accounting entry is defined:
•
•
•

Chapter 4
[ 149 ]
To sum it up, when the system encounters a pending item with IN item entry  
type and ARCC1 entry reason, it will do the following to create the accounting entry:
1. It looks at the system function IT-01 to get the structure of accounting entry.
2. It knows that the debit side needs to use chartfields as defined on the item
entry type page for the given entry reason. In this case, it concludes that the
distribution code AR needs to be used and uses the chartfields defined as
part of this distribution code.
3. From the system function definition, it deduces that credit side of the
accounting entry is user defined. It looks for the chartfield values on the
Accounting Template and uses them to complete the accounting entry. 
Note that a user can override these values on the item and manually
specify different chartfields.
Implementation challenge
An organization needs to enter and account two different types of invoices:
Hardware sales and Software sales. Hardware invoices should be recorded to the
Receivables account 250000, while the Software invoices should be recorded using 
a different Receivables account 350000. The revenue generated from Hardware and
Software invoices needs to be tracked using different revenue accounts: 100000 and
900000 respectively. For the sake of simplicity, we will not consider chartfields other
than ACCOUNT.

PeopleSoft Accounts Receivable Module
[ 150 ]
Solution
Let's sum up the accounting requirements discussed previously in the 
following table:
Hardware Invoices
DR Receivables (250000)
CR Revenue (100000)
Software Invoices
DR Receivables (350000)
CR Revenue (900000)
Here we need an Item entry type to manually enter these different invoice
transactions. Based on our previous discussion, we can use the IT-01 system function
and configure an Item Entry Type called IN. Now as there are two types of invoice
transactions with different accounting requirements, we'll need two entry reasons. 
Let's name them HW and SW.
Now how will these entry reasons derive the AR side of the accounting entry? The
answer is—'using AR distribution code'. As there are two different AR accounts,
we'll need two distribution codes as well. We'll name them ARHW (distribution code
for hardware invoices) and ARSW (distribution code for software invoices). These
distribution codes will be configured as shown next:
Distribution code
Account
ARHW
250000
ARSW
350000
Once we assign the appropriate distribution code to the entry reason, it'll point to the
correct AR account.
Finally, we'll specify the right revenue account for entry reasons on the Accounting
Template tab. Thus, the final configuration for entry type and entry reason will be as
shown in the following table:
Item Entry Type
Entry Reason
Distribution Code
Accounting Template
IN
HW
ARHW
100000
IN
SW
ARSW
900000
Configuring automatic entry types
As part of configuring an automatic entry type, we need to select a system function
and link it to an entry type. Similar to item entry type, we need to specify the
chartfields to be used to create accounting entries.

Chapter 4
[ 151 ]
Follow this navigation to configure automatic entry types:
Set Up Financials/Supply Chain | Product Related | Receivables | Payments |
Automatic Entry Type
The following screenshot shows the Selection tab of the configuration page:
Once a system function is selected, we can assign a previously enabled entry type 
to it in the Entry Type field. Similarly to item entry type, we can decide what entry
reasons need to be used for this automatic entry type. Note that the fields on this tab
vary according to the selected system function.
Specify the chartfields to be used for accounting entry creation on the Accounting 
Template tab. 
The following screenshot shows the Accounting Template tab: 

PeopleSoft Accounts Receivable Module
[ 152 ]
In the given example, we can see that both the debit and credit lines of the
accounting entry are created by the system, which is the case with most of the
system functions. However, for some system functions (and in turn, some automatic
entry types) one of the two lines is user-defined and we need to provide the default
chartfield values for that user-defined line. 
Understanding pending item entry
Pending items can either be entered manually using online pages or loaded through
an interface. We'll briefly discuss these methods here. 
PeopleSoft offers the following staging tables to store pending items:
Table
Description
GROUP_CONTROL
Mandatory: This table holds the details of the pending item groups
such as the number of pending items, total amount, and so on
PENDING_ITEM
Mandatory: Each row in this table indicates a pending item
PENDING_VAT
Optional: If VAT processing is applicable, this table holds the VAT
information for pending items
PENDING_TAX
Optional: This table is used to hold India tax information
PENDING_TAX_DTL
Optional: This table is used to hold India tax information
PENDING_DST
Optional: This table holds the accounting information for the
pending items
If other PeopleSoft modules send transactions to AR, a dedicated program (such as
BILDAR01 for the Billing module) loads the data into these staging tables. If we wish
to bring in AR transactions from a non-PeopleSoft system, we need to develop a
custom program to populate these tables as required. However, irrespective of how
pending items enter the AR module, they are processed by the Receivable Update
process to post them. This is where the pending items are converted into items. 
Entering pending items manually also loads the same tables listed previously. We'll
go through a few pages used for online pending item entry. 
Follow this navigation to access online pending entry pages:
Accounts Receivable | Pending Items | Online Items | Group Entry
Note that pending items need to be entered as a part of group even if there is only
one pending item. The following screenshot shows the Group Control tab, where we
specify the statistics of the pending item group, such as group currency, number of
pending items, total amount, and so on. 

Chapter 4
[ 153 ]
Subsequent tabs such as Pending Item 1, Pending Item 2, and Pending Item 3 are
used to enter additional details about the individual pending item, such as Item ID,
amount, payment terms, reference details, and so on. 
The Accounting Entries tab is used to create the accounting entries online for a
pending item. If they are already created, they are displayed on this tab.
The last tab, Group Action, controls various actions for the pending item group. 
The following screenshot shows the buttons and options on the Group Action tab:
Balance: When this button is clicked, the system checks if the control amount
and count are equal to the entered amount and count. If they are equal, it
checks if the accounting entries are balanced. If the totals are out of balance,
the system shows a warning message.
Delete Group: If this button is clicked, the entered pending group is deleted.
Posting Action: This field controls how AR posts the pending item group. 
•
•
•

PeopleSoft Accounts Receivable Module
[ 154 ]
Possible options are:  
Do Not Post: This system saves the changes to group and pending items, but
the group is not picked by the AR UPDATE process. 
Post Now: This results in the Receivable Update process being triggered to
post the pending item group. 
Post Now to GL: This results in the Receivable Update process being
triggered to post the pending item group followed by the processes to create
journals and post them (such as Journal Generator and Journal Post) to GL.
Batch Priority: This option instructs the system to pick up this pending 
item group when either the Receivables Update configured to pick up
the priority groups runs next time or a regular Receivables Update runs,
whichever is earlier.
Batch Standard: This option results in the pending item group being picked
up for posting when the standard scheduled Receivables Update job runs
next time.
Receivable Update process
The Receivables Update process is probably one of the most important AR processes:
it needs to be run to post any pending items. These pending items could be manually
entered as discussed previously or through maintenance and payment worksheets. 
Note that the AR Update process does not pick up a pending item group for posting
if its Posting Action is Do Not Post.
Follow this navigation to execute the Receivables update process:
Accounts Receivable | Receivables Update | Request Receivables Update
Understanding item maintenance
Now that we have successfully entered the pending items into the system and 
posted them using Receivable Update process, we are ready to track them. However,
there are many situations where items need to be modified before we receive
payments for them. Before we proceed, let's remember the conventions for the  
debit and credit items.
In AR terms, a debit item increases a customer's outstanding balance. For example,
an invoice, a debit memo (which represents some additional charge), and so on. 
Such debit item amounts are always positive.
•
•
•
•
•

Chapter 4
[ 155 ]
A credit item decreases a customer's outstanding balance. Examples include an
invoice that was credited (recall our discussion in the Billing chapter), a discount, 
a write off, and so on. Such credit item amounts are always negative. 
Now, let's consider the following scenarios:
Scenario 1: A customer has two outstanding invoices of $100 and $300.
However we have also issued a credit for $400 to correct a billing error 
in the past.
Scenario 2: A customer's account shows a credit of $500. Now this credit
amount needs to be refunded to the customer.
Scenario 3: We discover that due to a dispute, an outstanding invoice for the
amount of $350 will not be paid by the customer and we need to take it off
the system.
In the first scenario, we can ask the customer to pay the $100 and $300 invoices while
we send a check to pay for the $400 credit. However, wouldn't it be much easier if we
just match the total of $400 that the customer needs to pay us with the $400 that we
need to pay the customer and close the three items? This will certainly save the effort
of processing 3 different transactions. This is known as offsetting the debit items
($100 and $300) against the credit items (-$400).
In the second scenario, we need to select the credit item for customer and issue a
payment through the Accounts Payable module. This is known as issuing a refund.
In the third scenario, we need to cancel the invoice and remove it from the
customer's account without receiving any payment for it. This is known as writing
off an item. We can write off an item completely or partially. 
These activities are known as item maintenance. The PeopleSoft AR module offers
two methods to perform maintenance activities: 
Automatic maintenance process (AR_AUTOMNT)
Maintenance worksheets (manual)
Automatic maintenance 
We can automate the item maintenance activities in AR module by following these
two steps:
1. Configure the automatic maintenance method
2. Execute the Automatic maintenance batch process
•

•
•

PeopleSoft Accounts Receivable Module
[ 156 ]
Automatic maintenance method is used to define the rules for automatic
maintenance of debit and credit items. There are three ways in which we can
perform this activity: 
By specifying the matching options for debit and credit items 
By using a PeopleSoft-delivered algorithm to match items 
By instructing the system to write off unmatched items with a certain entry
type and entry reason 
Follow this navigation to configure the automatic maintenance method:

Collections | Automatic Maintenance Method
The following screenshot shows the Method Summary tab of the configuration page.
This tab is just a summary of configuration options defined on the Method Detail tab.
As you can see, this method instructs the automatic batch process to match debit 
and credit items with amounts that match exactly. 
Let's take a look at the Method Detail tab to see how it is configured. 
•
•
•

Chapter 4
[ 157 ]
As you can see, we can choose how the maintenance should be performed. 
Match Reference: In this method, we can specify the matching parameters
for debit and credit items. For example, we can decide to match the amounts
or purchase order numbers of the items. The appropriate value needs to be
selected from the Debit Field and Credit Field dropdown menus. 
Execute Algorithm: PeopleSoft delivers a matching algorithm called
#OLDEST, which matches the open debit and credit items for a customer
with oldest due dates first. If needed, we can develop our own customized
algorithms to be used for maintenance.
No Match Write-Off: We can instruct the system to write off any items with
a specific entry type or entry reason that could not be matched by previous
steps. Of course, the item amount must be less than the write-off limit.
For the Match Reference and Execute Algorithm methods, we can also 
specify which actions should be taken if the debit and credit amounts don't
match and there is a remaining balance. The available options are: 
•
•
•

PeopleSoft Accounts Receivable Module
[ 158 ]
Resolve: This option instructs the system to match the entire amount of 
items and close them. This option should be used only when there is no
remaining balance.
Resolve, Write-off Balance: This instructs the system to match the items,
close them, and write off the remaining balance. This option should be used
only when the remaining balance is greater than or less than zero but within
the tolerance limits.
Resolve, Create New Item: This option ensures that system matches items,
closes them, and creates a new item for the amount of remaining balance. It
uses an entry type of MD (create a new debit) if the balance is positive or MC
(create a new credit) if the balance is negative.
Resolve, Item Balance Open: This option instructs the system to close items
but keep the item with the latest due date open. The amount for this item is
changed to the remaining balance.
Release to Next Step: This action simply makes the debit and credit items
available to the next step. 
Note that there can be multiple steps in an automatic maintenance method. For
example, in Step 1, we can use the Match References method and match all debit and
credit items whose amounts are equal. In Step 2, we can match debit and credit items
whose purchase order numbers are the same. In Step 3, we can use No Match Write
Off method and write off any unmatched items with a certain entry type.
An automatic maintenance method is assigned to the AR business unit, which is
used as a default by the Automatic Maintenance process. However we can override
it while running the process.
Now that we have defined the rules for automatic maintenance, we can execute the
Automatic Maintenance process.
Follow this navigation to run the process:

Override Method: To override the method specified at the business unit, provide
a value in this field. Available options are: MATCH EQUAL AMT (match equal
amount), NO MATCH WO (no match write-off), OLDEST (using #OLDEST
algorithm) and REFERENCE MATCH.
The Automatic Maintenance process creates match groups for the items that are
matched. The match groups also contain any new write-off items as well as new
adjustment items created. These groups are automatically set to post or put on
maintenance worksheets if specified on the automatic maintenance method.
Maintenance worksheets
Maintenance worksheets are used to perform offsets, write-offs (for debit as well 
as credit items), and refunds manually.

Once the item maintenance activities are completed (either using automatic
maintenance or through maintenance worksheets), the Receivable Update process
needs to be executed. This process posts all the new maintenance items created,
thereby altering the original item balance. The AR module tracks all the operations
performed on an item in a table named ITEM_ACTIVITY.
Let's see how this works with a couple of examples.
Scenario 1: An invoice (ID 176587) for $100 is written off completely. 
When this invoice is originally created, the ITEM_ACTIVITY table holds a row
for this transaction as shown:
Item ID
Entry Type
Amount
176587
IN
$100
•

PeopleSoft Accounts Receivable Module
[ 164 ]
When we write off this item, the system creates a new item with the  
same item ID but with entry type WO and amount of $-100. When this item  
is posted by the Receivables Update process, the ITEM_ACTIVITY table holds
an additional row for this transaction, as shown:
Item ID 
Entry Type
Amount
176587
IN
$100
176587
WO
$-100
The end result is that the item's status changes to Closed from Open.
Scenario 2: An invoice (ID 52467) for $200 is offset against a credit memo
(57879) for $-200.
When these items are originally created, the ITEM_ACTIVITY table holds rows
for these transactions, as shown:
Item ID 
Entry Type
Amount
52467
IN
$200
57879
CR
$-200
When we offset these items against each other, the system creates two  
new items with same item IDs and amounts, but with opposite signs and
entry type MT. When these maintenance items are posted by the Receivables
Update process, the ITEM_ACTIVITY table holds a additional rows for these
transactions as shown next:
Item ID 
Entry Type
Amount
52467
IN
$200
57879
CR
$-200

The status for both items changes from Open to Closed.
Understanding aging
One of the important functions of any Accounts Receivable system is to give a
snapshot of how long the customer invoices are outstanding. If an organization does
not know how long its customers are taking to pay the invoices, it can encounter
serious cash flow problems. PeopleSoft AR offers elaborate ways in which we can 
•

Chapter 4
[ 165 ]
review the open items, place them in appropriate categories depending on how 
old they are, and then generate various reports to analyze customers' payment
performance. The aging business process in the AR module performs these activities.
There are three elements that constitute the customer aging in PeopleSoft AR:
Configuration of aging ID
Execution of aging batch process
Aging reports
Configuring aging ID
An aging ID is the foundation of aging process. It defines the various categories that
we wish to use for classifying open items based on their age. It also determines how
the items in dispute, items in collection and deduction items are processed.
Follow this navigation to configure an aging ID:
Set Up Financials/Supply Chain | Product Related | Receivables | Credit/
Collections | Aging
The following screenshot shows the configuration options on the aging ID
configuration page:
•
•
•

PeopleSoft Accounts Receivable Module
[ 166 ]
This is the page where we decide how many aging categories and corresponding
age ranges we need for our reporting. In the previous example, we have configured
the following aging categories: one-10 days old, 10-20 days old, 20-30 days old, and
items older than 30 days. 
Basis Date: Specify the date to be used as basis for aging items. Possible
options are As of Date, Accounting Date, Item Date and Due Date. 
Start, End: These fields specify the start and end value for the item age for a
specific category. 
Irrespective of how many aging categories we configure, there must be
one category with -9,999 as the start value and one category with 9,999
as the end value.
In the previous example, as we are using Due Date as the basis, any item that has not
reached its due date will be placed in category 01 (i.e. which is less than zero days
past due). Any item that is up to 10 days past its due date will be placed in category
02 and so on.
Sum: Specify a summarization option for each category. Possible options
are: Current Due, Past Due, Current Due and Other. In this example, as all
categories other than category 01 represent past due items, they have Past
Due as summarization option.
Dispute aging, Collection aging, and Deduction
aging options
If we wish, we can process the collection, deduction, and disputed items differently
from the regular items. Possible options are as follows:
Categorize: We can create separate categories in addition to those we saw
previously. If we select this option, the Category field becomes active and
we can specify the special purpose category, where the system will place the
dispute, deduction and collection items. We can specify a single category for
all of these or have different ones for each type. 
Exclude: If this option is selected, the aging process ignores all dispute,
deduction, and collection items.
Normal: If this option is selected, the aging process treats dispute, deduction,
and collection items like regular items and puts them in appropriate aging
categories based on the basis date.
•
•
•
•
•
•

Chapter 4
[ 167 ]
Vary: If this option is selected, the system refers to the Dispute Reason,
Deduction Reason, and Collection Code configurations respectively to decide
how the dispute, deduction, and collection items need to be aged.
An aging ID is assigned to the AR business unit to be used by the aging process.
Executing aging batch process
Once the aging ID is configured, the next step is to execute the ARAGE multi-process
job. This batch process uses the aging ID assigned to the AR business unit, reviews
all open items, and places them in the appropriate aging category depending on the
defined rules. 
Follow this navigation to run the aging batch job:

Expert tip:
The aging process can be run as many times as needed. However, it
needs to be executed after all the pending items (including maintenance,
payment, and so on) are posted by Receivables Update process, so that 
it reflects the latest open items. Make sure the following sequence of
processes is used: Receivables Update | Aging | Aging Reports

Receiving customer payments
As part of its normal business operations, an organization regularly receives
payments from its customers. PeopleSoft AR offers multiple methods to receive
payments. Payment methods can be broadly categorized into manual and electronic
(automated). We'll discuss these in the following sections.
Entering payments manually
Just as we saw that a pending item must be a part of item group, customer 
payments also need to be a part of payment group, known as Deposit. A deposit 
can contain multiple payments or a single payment. In PeopleSoft parlance, we 
can enter two types of deposits manually: Regular deposits and Express deposits.
Which type of deposit is used depends on the amount of information we have  
for the received payment. 
A payment, when received, should ideally have the customer ID (who paid this
amount) and the item ID (to which this payment needs to be applied). However, in
many cases, this is not true. When organizations receive the payments, some of them
lack the item ID or customer ID details. 
Entering regular deposits
Regular deposits are used to enter payments when they have the customer
information (although it is not mandatory) and need not be applied immediately. 

Chapter 4
[ 169 ]
Follow this navigation to enter regular deposits:
Accounts Receivable | Payments | Online Payments | Regular Deposits 
The following screenshot shows the Totals tab of the regular deposits page:
This tab is used to enter the bank and bank account where this deposit (and the
payments that are part of it) will be deposited. It also records the control information,
such as the total amount for all payments and the total number of payments in this
deposit. The system compares these control details against the actual payments
entered. Any differences are highlighted in the Difference Amount and Difference
Count fields.
Click the Payments tab to enter the details about individual payments.
The following screenshot shows the Payments tab of the regular deposits page:

PeopleSoft Accounts Receivable Module
[ 170 ]
In the previous example, we have received a check payment for $4000 from a
customer, the National Institute of Health. 
Payment ID: This field is used to record the check number or any other
unique identifier for the received payment. 
Payment Predictor: If this checkbox is selected, the Payment Predictor
process picks up this payment to be applied to appropriate customer open
item. If it is unchecked, we need to manually apply this payment. Recall our
discussion about setting up a bank account. If the Payment Predictor flag is
enabled for a bank account, all payments with that bank account have this
flag automatically enabled on this page. 
Journal Directly: This checkbox is used to mark a payment that is not 
related to a customer item. If selected, a payment cannot be processed 
on the payment worksheet. 
Miscellaneous Payments: Payments that are not related to a customer are
also known as Miscellaneous Payments. It is a very useful feature to record
payments such as interest paid by the bank, payments received as donations,
and so on. If this checkbox is enabled, it indicates to the system that it 
needs to be processed in a different manner. It cannot be applied to any
customer item. 
Payment Method: Available options are: Check, Electronic Funds Transfer
and Giro-EFT (used in the Netherlands).
Detail References hyperlink: Even if we don't have any item reference
information on the received payment, we can specify the customer items to
which this payment should be applied. Click this hyperlink to associate any
open items to this payment.
The following screenshot shows the Detail Reference Information page that opens
where we can specify the items for the payment:
•

Chapter 4
[ 171 ]
In the previous example, we have manually specified two items for this customer, to
which this payment can be applied. Note that it is not necessary to specify the items
here. The payment predictor process is capable of searching the open items for a
given customer and applying the payment to eligible items.
Reference information section
Qual Code: This field indicates the type of identifying information that the payment
has. For example, when a customer sends a payment to us, he may give a reference
so that we can identify what this payment is for. It can be the invoice number (item),
purchase order number that the customer sent us to purchase something, sales order
number that we created to record the customer's order, and so on. Select the type of
reference on the payment.
Reference: This field is used to store the reference number. 
Regular deposits entered as explained previously need to be applied
to items using either payment worksheets (manually) or payment
predictor process. We cannot enter as well as apply the payments
using regular deposits page.
Entering express deposits
Express deposits are used to enter payments as well as applying them to the
specified items. This is possible when the received customer payment has the item
information to which it can be applied. 
Consider a scenario where a telephone company sends the monthly bill (invoice) to
the customer. The customer then mails the payment check along with the invoice
stub that contains the invoice number. In this case, when the check payment is
received, we also know the invoice number for which this payment is made. Even if
we don't know the customer, the system can still apply the payment. 
Follow this navigation to enter express deposits:
Accounts Receivable | Payments | Online Payments | Express Deposit

PeopleSoft Accounts Receivable Module

The following screenshot shows the Totals tab of the express deposit page: 
You will have noticed that this tab is similar to the one for regular deposits page. 
Click the Payments tab to enter individual payment details. The following screenshot
shows the Payments tab:
As you can see, one of the important differences here is the lack of customer
information fields, as we don't need them. However, the item information is
required. We can select the item or items in the Item ID field. 
Click the Action tab to create and post the payment worksheet, so that the given
payment can be applied. 

Chapter 4
[ 173 ]
The following screenshot shows the Action tab and various processing options on it:
Build: Clicking this button creates payment worksheets for each payment in
the deposit.
Delete: This button deletes the payment worksheet but retains the deposit.
Batch Standard: This button sets the payment status to Batch Standard, 
so that it can be picked up by the Receivables Update process next time
it runs. We'll discuss the payment worksheets in detail in the payment
application section. 
Thus, express deposits serve a dual purpose by allowing the entry and 
application of a payment at the same time. However, it is useful only for 
a low payment volume environment. 
Understanding electronic payments 
When the number of payments handled by an organization is high, using regular or
express deposit is not feasible. PeopleSoft offers following automated methods to
enter payments in large batches: 
Payment method
Description
Lockbox
This method reads a payment file sent by the bank and loads
those payments using a delivered PeopleSoft program.
Excel spreadsheet
PeopleSoft provides a pre-formatted excel template, which can be
used to record payments and upload them into AR system.
Electronic Data
Interchange (EDI)
PeopleSoft can receive payment files in industry standard EDI
formats (European as well as U.S.) and load them automatically.
•

PeopleSoft Accounts Receivable Module
[ 174 ]
Payment method
Description
Cash drawer
This method is used to load point of sale (POS) payments that are
recorded in the order management module.
Bank statement
If an organization is using treasury modules, it can receive
bank statements electronically. PeopleSoft delivers methods to
reconcile the bank statement with the cash account in General
Ledger and load the reconciled deposits into AR. 
Bilateral netting
This is a feature of the PeopleSoft treasury modules. Here, the
system can match the receivable (money due from an entity) and
payable (money due to the same entity) balances and load the net
receivable balance into AR.
Credit card
Using a PeopleSoft bolt-on, we can directly establish a connection
with a credit card issuer to authorize a transaction and process a
credit card payment.
In order to use electronic payment methods, PeopleSoft provides a set of staging
tables (AR_LOCKBOX_EC, AR_DEPOSIT_EC, AR_PAYMENT_EC, AR_IDITEM_EC and 
AR_IDCUST_EC). It also delivers a batch program known as Payment Loader 
(AR_PAYLOAD) to read the payment data from staging tables and load them  
into AR.  
We will discuss the two most commonly used methods: Lockbox 
and Excel spreadsheets.
Understanding lockbox payments 
Many organizations utilize the services of a bank to handle customer payments.
Consider a telephone company with thousands of subscribers, who send their check
payments every month. Rather than handling thousands of payments every week
and entering them into AR system, it can give a post office box address operated by
a bank to its customers. Thus, all these check payments are received by the bank and
deposited into the company's account. Now the bank prepares a data file containing
details of deposited checks and sends it to the organization at regular intervals
(every night, once every week, and so on). This is known as a lockbox service.
Note that a lockbox file can contain a large number of payments from multiple
lockboxes from different bank accounts. 
PeopleSoft can receive such payment data files (provided they are in a specific
format) and load these payments using a two-step process:
1. Running the Lockbox SQR (AR25001) process
2. Running the Payment Loader (AR_PAYLOAD) process

Chapter 4
[ 175 ]
Follow this navigation to execute the Lockbox SQR process:

The following screenshot shows the run control page used to specify the 
processing options: 
We need to specify the payment data file and its location on the server to run the
AR25001 process. Click the Run button to start the process.
This process reads the data from the file and loads them into the payment staging
tables we discussed earlier.
The next step in the process is executing the Payment Loader process.
Follow this navigation to execute this process:
Accounts Receivable | Payments | Electronic Payments | Process 
Payment Interface
The following screenshot shows the run control page used to specify the processing
options for the Payment Loader process: 

PeopleSoft Accounts Receivable Module
[ 176 ]
The Payment Loader process is used to load payments that may have entered from
various sources such as lockbox, EDI, and so on from the staging tables into the AR
system. Various checkboxes on this page are used to instruct the payment method to
payment loader process. Select the Lockbox checkbox to process lockbox payments.
Click Run button to trigger the process.
Before implementing the lockbox feature, we need to analyze the
PeopleSoft lockbox file format. It offers various types of data records,
but it is not necessary to use all of them. Based on the organization's
requirements, we select the record types needed in the file. For
example, when we receive payment information from bank, we may
not need the customer address details along with the payment. In 
this case, the record type for customer address in the file is no longer
required. Once the required file records are identified, we need to
work closely with the bank to ensure that it sends the file in exactly the
same format as required. Refer to the detailed file specifications that
PeopleSoft provides.
Understanding Excel spreadsheet payments 
Many organizations use Microsoft Excel-based templates to record customer
payments. To simplify loading these payments into AR, PeopleSoft provides 
a utility to upload payments from pre-defined Excel sheets. 
The spreadsheet payments uploading process consists of following steps:
Setting up the spreadsheet template
Entering data into the template
Posting the data from the spreadsheet to Excel payment upload tables
Running Excel Payment Upload process
Running Payment Loader process
The PeopleSoft-delivered spreadsheet template consists of two worksheets:
Template and Data Entry. The Template worksheet shows all the individual fields
that are available for payment data entry. It is not necessary for an organization to
use all these fields and we can specify only those fields that we need. The fields we
select here become available on the Data Entry worksheet.

The following screenshot shows a part of the Template worksheet:
Record: This row shows the Excel upload table where a particular field value
will be stored.
Record Type: There are four different record types, each indicating a type of
payment information being entered. The a vailable values are: 000 (Deposit
information), 001 (Payment information), 002 (Customer information) and
003 (Reference information). As you can see, this structure essentially copies
the regular deposit page.  
Add to Data Sheet: Select this checkbox to make a field available on the Data
Sheet worksheet. 
The following screenshot shows a part of the Data Entry worksheet:
The data entry structure on this sheet is similar to the hierarchy on the regular
deposit page: deposit information is followed by payment information which 
contains customer and possibly multiple reference lines. 
Once the data entry is complete, we can use the Generate XML and Post button 
to upload the data in this tab to the Excel upload tables. 
The next step is to run the Excel Payment Upload process which validates the data in
the Excel upload tables and loads them into payment staging tables (the same tables
used by the lockbox process).

Click the Run button to trigger the process.
Finally, run the Payment Loader process to load these payments from the
staging table to the AR system. Note that we need to check the Upload From
Excel checkbox in order to process the spreadsheet payments.
Understanding payment application
So far, we have discussed various processes by which we can record a customer's
outstanding items, and modify them as well as receiving payments from the customer.
The last logical step in this cycle is applying the payment to open items. In real life,
this seemingly simple task is complicated due to various factors. Consider following
situations, which will give you a sense of various payment application considerations:
A customer has three open items for $300, $250, and $400. We receive a
payment for $700. As this amount can pay only two items at the most, which
items should this payment be applied to? What should be done with the
remaining payment amount?
We receive a payment from a customer, but find out that currently there is no
open item to which it can be applied. However, we know that a new invoice
will be issued soon. What should we do with this payment?
A customer gets a 10 percent discount on an invoice for $1,000. However,
we later promise an additional five percent discount. The customer sends a
payment for $850. However, the system has automatically calculated $100 as
discount amount. How do we specify an additional $50 discount amount?
What do we do if the customer pays less or more than the invoice amount
that is outstanding?

PeopleSoft offers two methods for payment application: 
Payment predictor, which automatically applies payments based on the rules
we configure
Payment worksheets (manual)
Understanding payment predictor
We can automate the payment application activities in AR module by following
these two steps:
1. Configure the payment predictor method
2. Execute the payment predictor batch process
Before we get into a discussion about payment predictor, let's understand a few
relevant basic concepts.
Item references
We have already seen that payments carry some type of identifying information
that helps matching it with the appropriate item. The reference information could be
the Customer ID, Item ID, or both. As far as the payment predictor is concerned, it
categorizes item references into three types. 
Payment reference type
Description
Customer reference
In this case, the payment simply carries the customer ID. 
Item summary
reference
The payment carries the item ID to which it needs to be applied.
However it doesn't say what amount should be applied.
Item detail reference
In this case, the payment carries the item ID to which it should
be applied, as well as the item amount that should be paid by the
payment.
Based on the type of reference information that a payment carries, the payment
predictor uses the appropriate method of payment application.

Algorithm groups
PeopleSoft delivers various methods by which it can match a payment with open
items. These are known as algorithm groups. Each algorithm group consists of 
one or more algorithms, which carry instructions to select open items that match a
payment being processed. In most of the cases, delivered algorithm groups can fulfill
the payment application requirements of an organization. However, some special
requirements may need a modification of algorithms or even creation of a new
algorithm group. 
Although we can't discuss all the delivered algorithm groups individually, let's
briefly take a look at a few of them, so that you can get an idea of how they work.
#BALANCE is an algorithm group used for applying payments that have
only customer references. When it encounters such a payment, it retrieves the
customer ID, retrieves all open items for that customer and checks if the total
of those open amounts exactly matches the payment amount. If it does, only
then does it select those items for payment application.
#OLDEST1 is another algorithm group used for applying payments that
have only customer references. When it encounters such a payment, it
retrieves the customer ID, retrieves all open items for that customer and
arranges them in decreasing order of item age. Thus it selects the oldest
item and applies the payment to it. If there is a remaining balance amount, 
it selects the next oldest item and applies the balance to it. This is continued
until the remaining payment balance is less than the item amount, for which
it creates a partial amount. 
#REFS is an algorithm group used for applying payments with 
summary item references. It doesn't matter if it carries a customer 
reference. When it processes such a payment, it retrieves the reference
information on it (nothing but the item ID) and selects the item that exactly
matches this reference.
By this time you would have realized that each algorithm group performs a very
specific function. Organizations have their own unique requirements for applying
payments. Sometimes the same organization can have different application rules 
for different business units. We can use combinations of algorithm groups to 
satisfy these requirements.

Configuring payment predictor method
A predictor method is a collection of instructions for the payment predictor process.
It lays down the rules for payment applications under different circumstances. We
can configure as many predictor methods as are required. Once a predictor method is
defined, it is assigned to an AR business unit. If payments from a particular customer
need to be applied in a way different from this default method, we can create a new
predictor method and assign it to that customer. 
Before we see how to configure a predictor method, let's consider a 
practical requirement.
Implementation challenge
An organization receives its payment information through lockbox and always
includes the item ID as reference (summary reference). It needs a payment to be
matched with specified item ID. If the underpayment (payment amount is less
than item amount) is less than $50, the difference should be automatically written
off. If the underpayment exceeds $50, a new deduction item for the difference
amount should be created. If the overpayment (payment amount is more than item
amount) is less than $50, the difference should be automatically written off. If the
overpayment exceeds $50, the additional payment should be placed on customer
account for later application.
However, there are a few payments that are received with only customer ID. Any
such payments should be placed on a payment worksheet for a manual review.

PeopleSoft Accounts Receivable Module
[ 182 ]
Solution
As the payments have summary reference, we will use the #REFS algorithm group.
We'll see the configuration options to satisfy the given requirements.
Follow this navigation to configure a predictor method:

Predictor Method
The following screenshot shows the configuration options on the Predictor 
Method page:
Note that a predictor method consists of one or multiple steps. Each step defines the
type of reference information that can be encountered and specifies the actions that
need to be taken. Thus each step has one or more actions. 
Customers Identified: This field specifies if a customer reference is necessary
for a payment. Available options are None, One, More Than One and
Doesn't Matter. For our example, if the payment has item information, it
doesn't matter if customer ID is present or not.
References Supplied: This field specifies what kind of item reference
information is required for a payment. Available options are Summary,
Detail, No and Doesn't Matter. In our example, we know that payments
need to have summary information.

The Condition and Action section defines all the possible conditions and
corresponding actions for this combination of reference information. 
PeopleSoft delivers the conditions First, Any Overpayment, Overpayment Exceeds,
Overpayment Is Less Than, Any Underpayment, Underpayment Exceeds, and
Underpayment Is Less Than. A step can have all of these conditions or only a few 
of them. However, there must be at least one condition for each step.
For a selected condition, the following actions are available: 
Release the Payment: This option instructs the payment predictor to ignore
any application done for a payment and make it available for the next step.
Execute Algorithm Group: If selected, the payment predictor uses the
algorithm group specified in the adjoining field and tries to apply the
payment. If it is successful in application, a payment group is created and set
to post, so that it can be posted by the Receivables Update process. 
Generate an Item: This option creates a new pending item using the system
function specified in the adjoining field. 
Apply to Control Customer: This option instructs the payment predictor 
to place the payment on the account of the customer specified in the
adjoining field. This option is used when the customer cannot be identified
for the given payment. 
Generate a Worksheet: This option simply creates a worksheet with eligible
items to which the payment can be applied.
For the first three options, the system creates a payment group with its posting action
as Batch Standard. However, if the Worksheet checkbox is selected, the process
creates a payment worksheet, so that it can be reviewed by a user before being
posted. If required, any manual changes can be done to the worksheet. In other
words, it doesn't automatically post the payment groups.
Generate a Worksheet
This option creates a payment worksheet for the payment by showing all the item
matches, overpayments, underpayments, and so on. 
For our implementation challenge, we will configure the predictor steps and
conditions and actions as follow:

Running the payment predictor process
Once a predictor method is configured, the payment predictor process uses the
defined application rules and applies the received payments.

Using payment worksheets
Payment worksheets are used to manually apply payments. We can apply a payment
completely or partially, write off any underpayments or overpayments, give any
additional discounts, and create adjustments. As we saw in the previous section, the
payment predictor also creates payment worksheets if so instructed. The structure of
payment worksheets is similar to maintenance worksheets, which we discussed in
the item maintenance section. It consists of three sections: 
Worksheet selection: This is the place where we can specify the criteria to
fetch items and build the worksheet
Worksheet application: Payments are applied to items in this section 
Worksheet action: We can choose the appropriate posting action for the
worksheet, delete the worksheet (if necessary), or create accounting entries
Follow this navigation to create a payment worksheet:

check the checkbox for the desired items and select the appropriate action.
Let's say we wish to pay the $300 item now. In order to do it, select it, choose the
option Pay An Item, and click the Refresh button on the page. The following

The system automatically assigns the entry type PY (representing payment) to the
item. The Balance section at the bottom updates the Selected amount and shows
Remaining balance as $3,700. 

Chapter 4
[ 187 ]
Now let's say we wish to keep the balance amount of $3700 on customer account, so
that it can be applied for future payments. 
In order to adjust underpayments and overpayments or create
on-account payments, we need to manually create new item
using the Add With Detail button.
Click the Add With Detail button to create a new on account item. The following
screenshot shows the page that the system opens: 
Specify the item ID for this new item we are adding, along with the amount and
entry type. In our example, as we wish to create an on-account payment for $3700,
we should choose OA as the entry type and -$3700 as the payment amount (recall
that any item that reduces customer balance needs to have a negative sign). We can
create items for various entry types on this page. Possible options are as follows:
Adjust remaining overpayment: If a payment amount remains after
applying to an item, we can create a new item with a negative amount 
for the remaining payment amount. The entry type of this item is AO.
Adjust remaining underpayment: If a payment amount is less than item
amount to which it is applied, we can create a new item with a positive
amount for the remaining item amount. The entry type of this item is AU.

Write off an overpayment: If a payment amount remains after applying to
an item, we can write off this remainder rather than creating a new item for
the remaining payment amount. In the background, the system creates an
item with the entry type AO with a negative amount and another item with
the entry type WAO with a positive amount and the same item ID.
Write off remaining underpayment: If a payment amount is less than the
item amount to which it is applied, we can apply the payment and write off
remaining item balance rather than creating a new item for the remaining
item amount. In the background, the system creates an item with the entry
type AU with a positive amount and another item with the entry type WAU
with a negative amount and the same item ID.
Click the Return to Worksheet Application Summary View hyperlink to go back. 
The page now shows the changes The customer has a new item to represent its 
on-account payment with entry type OA. Also, the remaining amount is now zero,
indicating that the payment is fully processed. Now we can go to the Worksheet
Action section to set the worksheet to post.
Customer correspondence
As the AR system deals with tracking invoices sent to customers and receiving their
payments, one of its important functions is generating effective correspondence
with them. It can be in the form of customer statements (which list the open items,
received payments and so on.), dunning letters (which notify the customers about
their overdue items) or follow up letters. We'll discuss the most widely used
features—statements and dunning letters.
Customer statements
An organization may dispatch detailed statements each month, which let the
customers know their outstanding items, total balance, and so on. We can generate
customer statements by following these steps:
1. Configuring a statement ID that establishes rules for statement generation 
2. Running the customer statements multi-process job
3. Running the statement print multi-process job
Configuring the statement ID
Statement ID specifies which items are included in customer statements. It also
specifies conditions when statements should not be created.

Statements
The Following screenshot shows the configuration options for statement ID:
Type: This important field decides the structure of the customer statement.
The available values are:
Open Item: This type of statement includes all of a customer's 
open items
Balance forward: This type of statement shows the balance carried
forward from last statement, all of the open as well as the closed
items and payments in the current period, and the net outstanding
balance. This is similar to the credit card statement that you receive
from your card company.
Item Exclusion Options: An organization may not wish to list all the open
items on the statement. We can specify if the statement should exclude the
collection, deduction, disputed, and credit items. We can also specify that
items below a certain amount should be excluded from statements.
Cancel Document Options: It may not be necessary to create statements
for all customers. We can specify the conditions under which a statement
for a customer should not be created. This is possible if the collection action
is in process for a customer, a dispute is on-going with a customer, the
total customer balance is negative (that is, we owe the customer), or if the
outstanding balance is less than a certain amount.

Correspondence Customer: In PeopleSoft we can designate a customer to
receive all correspondence on behalf of other customers. This is known as a
correspondence customer. If this is not needed, each customer is by default
its own correspondence customer. Specify a value in this field if we wish to
create statements for all customers in a correspondence group.
If the Customer or Correspondence Customer fields are left blank, the system
automatically populates them with the wildcard % character, indicating that the
system should process all values.
Click the Run button to initiate the batch job. When the processing is complete, the
system generates a statement number for each statement that is created. We can
review these statements before printing them. 
Note that a statement ID indicates a unique statement process run. It is

customers. However, the statement ID is still the same for all statements
in this run.

Dunning letters
Dunning letters are used by organizations to notify customers about overdue items.
We can generate dunning letters by following these steps:
1. Configuring letter codes and corresponding content
2. Configuring a dunning ID that establishes rules for dunning letter generation 
3. Running the extract dunning letter multi-process job
4. Running the dunning print multi-process job
Configuring the letter codes
Organizations can define multiple levels of dunning letters depending upon the
severity of the customer's delayed payment. For example, we may want to send a
letter to a customer merely reminding him that some of his items are past due. If we
don't receive the payments even after the reminder, we may send a harsher letter
instructing that a late payment may be charged. The harshest letter may warn the
customer that legal action may be initiated if payment is not received. 

Chapter 4
[ 193 ]
The number of levels of letters and corresponding content entirely depends on the
organization's requirements.

Configuring dunning ID
A dunning ID (or dunning method as it is sometimes called) defines the rules for the
generation of dunning letters. It also determines how dunning letters are created,
how many levels are used, and which letter codes are used for each level.

The following screenshot shows the Dunning ID tab of the configuration page:
As you can see in this example, the item exclusion options and document cancelation
options are similar to those we saw for the statement ID. 
Dunning Method : PeopleSoft offers three different methods by which dunning
letters can be created. The following table describes these approaches:
Dunning
Method
Description
Dunning by days
The level of dunning letter is determined by the number of days by
which customer items are past due. For example, we can specify that
for items up to 30 days past due, a level one letter should be used,
while for items between 30 and 60 days past due, a level two letter
should be used.
However, there are cases where a customer has items that fall into
different categories. In such cases, the system does not generate
different letters for such items. letter can contain items from different
dunning levels. 
Continuing with the above example, let's assume that a customer 
has two items: the first item is 10 days past due (level one), while the
second is 40 days past due (level two). We can instruct the system to
use the lowest or highest dunning level letter for such cases. Thus the
customer will receive only one letter containing both the items.
It is not necessary for an item to move through each dunning level. 

Chapter 4
[ 195 ]
Dunning
Method
Description
Dunning by level
In this method, the past due item sequentially moves through the
dunning levels. The dunning levels are determined not by the age of
the item, but the interval between two levels. 
When the dunning process is run, it checks the level for past due items
when it was executed last time. If the number of days for which the
items were present in that level exceeds the defined interval, items are
moved to the next level and a letter for that level is sent.
Let's say that we specify an interval of 20 days between dunning levels
one and two. Assume that we run the dunning process on January 1,
when two items became past due. The process creates a level one letter
for those items. 
When the dunning process is rerun on January 10, the process sees that
only 10 days have passed since these items were included on the last
letter and doesn't create a new letter. However, if a third item became
past due in the meanwhile, the process creates a level one letter and
includes that item.
If the process is run on 25th January, the process calculates that first
two items have been in level one for more than 20 days and creates a
harsher level two letter for them. However, the third item has been in
level one for only 15 days and will not be included on this letter.
Dunning by
action list
A process known as Condition Monitor automatically creates dunning
letters at the appropriate level based on the collection and assessment
rules. This method is used when we wish to use the condition monitor.
Due to the page constraints, we will not discuss this process.
Click the Dunning Level tab to define the various dunning levels and corresponding
letter codes. 

PeopleSoft Accounts Receivable Module
[ 196 ]
The following screenshot shows the Dunning Level tab when we use the Dunning
By Days method:
In the given example, letter code 1 will be used if items are up to 60 days past due,
letter code 2 if items are between 60 to 90 days past due and so on. 
The tab is slightly different when a different dunning method is used. The following
screenshot shows the tab when Dunning By Level method is used: 
As you can see, we need to specify the interval between levels instead of a range of
days. We can also specify if an additional penalty should be charged for each level in
the Letter Charge field.
Running AR Dunning process
Once the dunning ID is created, the AR Dunning process uses those rules and
extracts items eligible for dunning into a temporary table (AR33000_TMP).

You will notice that processing options for this page are similar to those we saw 
for customer statement process.
Use Severest Dunning Letter: If there are items belonging to multiple
dunning levels, the system uses the letter code for the highest dunning 
level and puts all overdue items on that letter.
Use Modest Dunning Letter: If there are items belonging to multiple dunning
levels, the system uses the letter code for the lowest dunning level and puts
all overdue items on that letter.
When the process is complete, it creates a dunning number for that specific dunning
run. It needs to be used during the dunning letter print process. We can review
dunning letters before printing them. 
Note that a dunning number indicates a unique dunning process run.
It is possible that a single run may create multiple dunning letters for
different customers. However, the dunning number is still the same for
all dunning letters in this run.

Summary
Pending items can be entered into AR manually using online pages or brought 
from external sources. A set of staging tables stores the pending item groups. 
The Receivables Update process posts these pending items, which then become 
items and part of the customer's balance.
Item maintenance activities include item write offs, refunds, and offsets. The
Automatic maintenance process is used to automate the item maintenance activities.
Maintenance worksheets are used to perform these activities manually. 
The AR module is used to record customer payments through electronic methods
or manually. Lockbox is one of the most widely used electronic payment methods.
We can also upload payments through Excel spreadsheets. PeopleSoft provides a
group of staging tables to store electronic payment data from external sources. The
payment loader process reads the data from these tables and creates payments. 
Received payments need to be applied to customer items. Payment worksheets
are used for manual payment application, while Payment Predictor process is the
automated tool for payment application.
We can create customer statements to list customer items and balances. Dunning
letters are used to notify customers about their past due items. Statement ID and
Dunning ID specifies the rules for correspondence creation.  
With this chapter, we conclude our discussion of the Order-to-Cash business process.
In the next chapter, we'll discuss the Asset Management module, which is critical for
organizations that need to maintain a large number of fixed assets. 

PeopleSoft Asset
Management Module
The Asset Management module is part of the Asset Lifecycle Management solutions
offered by PeopleSoft. In accounting terms, assets are categorized as current assets
such as cash, accounts receivable from customers, investments, and so on, and fixed
assets, such as vehicles, buildings, land, and so on. The Asset Management (or AM
as it is commonly referred to) module is critical for an organization that needs to
maintain and track a large number of fixed assets. It offers features that help us to
add new assets, perform transactions during their useful life right through to  
their retirement, and record the accounting entry details in accordance with
regulatory requirements.
In this chapter, we will familiarize ourselves with the following important 
AM topics:
High-level overview of Asset Management processes
Understanding important configurations, such as asset books, asset
categories, asset profiles, and so on
Capital acquisition plans
Adding new assets using basic add, express assets, and through 
automated interface
Depreciation processing

[ 200 ]
Asset Management processes
Before we get into the process flow in the AM module, let's take some time to
understand a few basic concepts. 
Accounting standards treat the fixed assets differently from current assets. For
example, when an organization buys stationery items such as pens and notepads,
they are considered as business expenses and are immediately recognized. Similarly,
other assets such as cash, securities, and so on are called current assets. On the other
hand, assets such as machinery, buildings, and vehicles are known as fixed assets.
Fixed asset purchases, although paid for fully, are considered as expenses over a
period of time. 
Any asset (we'll be referring to only fixed assets in this chapter) has a specified useful
life. This is the duration for which an organization can reasonably use that asset for
its business activities. For example, a car can have a useful life of eight years, while
the same can be three years for a computer. Throughout the life of an asset, its initial
value continues to be reduced due to normal wear and tear. A car purchased for
$20,000 may be worth only $15,000 after two years. This is known as depreciation. In
accounting terms, this reduction in asset value can be claimed as a business expense.
The rules for depreciation are dictated by regulatory requirements. When the asset
reaches the end of its useful life, it may or may not have some remaining value,
known as residual value. Various transactions may take place for an item during its
life. Its value may change, it might be transferred from one business unit to the other,
or it may have to be retired before the end of its useful life. Nevertheless, each asset
needs to be retired at some point of time. It can be retired by scrapping, selling, or
any other method. When it is retired, the asset is taken off the books. At each asset
transaction, accounting entries are created and recorded.
Let's consider a hypothetical example to illustrate these concepts:
Assume that an organization buys a computer at a price of $2,400. Its useful life is
considered two years with no residual value at the end of the two years (24 months).
We'll assume that the organization uses the straight line depreciation method, where
depreciation is calculated uniformly over the item’s useful life. 
When the asset is recorded in the AM system, it will be capitalized. As a result, the
asset amount is not recorded to an expense account, but rather to an asset account.
The initial accounting entry will be as follows:
DR  
Computer assets  
 
$2400
CR  
Cash 
 
 
 
-$2400

Chapter 5
[ 201 ]
Now the straight line depreciation method calculates the amount by which the asset
value needs to be depreciated: (Asset Cost / No. of periods in the useful life). Thus
the monthly depreciation amount will be $100. 
Each month, this amount is recognized as an expense and the accumulated
depreciation (total depreciation amount for the asset) account is used as offset. 
Thus, the following entry will be created every month:
DR  
Depreciation expense  
 
$100
CR  
Accumulated depreciation  
 
-$100
At the end of 24 months, the accumulated depreciation account will have a total
credit balance of $2400. This means that the asset is now fully depreciated.
Note that this was a highly simplified scenario used to understand the fixed 
assets accounting. 
The following schematic shows the important processes in the Asset 
Management module:
Fixed assets usually involve significant capital investments, which need careful
planning and budgeting activities before being acquired. Organizations can identify
their future asset purchases, estimate their costs, and put capital acquisition plans in
place. PeopleSoft AM allows us to prepare such plans and track their performance.
As assets are acquired, they can be assigned to a capital acquisition plan. This
enables us to track the expenditure for asset purchases against the plan.

PeopleSoft Asset Management Module
[ 202 ]
Asset Management serves as the master system to record the fixed assets. Assets can
be added manually using online pages, uploaded in bulk using Excel spreadsheets,
or loaded from external systems through automated interface. PeopleSoft offers
three interface staging tables where external systems can load the asset data. A batch
process known as Transaction Edit (AMIFEDIT) validates the staged data. Another
process known as Transaction Loader (AMIF1000) loads the data into  
Asset Management and creates the assets.
Capitalization is the process by which capital (fixed) assets are distinguished from
non-capital assets. We can set up an amount threshold, so that the system recognizes
any purchase above that amount as a capital asset. 
Sometimes during the life of an asset, we may have to adjust its cost. For example, a
truck that was purchased for $20,000 two years ago meets with an accident. It turns
out that, due to the damage suffered, its value needs to be reduced. Also, accounting
standards usually dictate that assets be carried on company's books at their fair
value. To ensure this, we may need to revalue these assets. 
As discussed earlier, we need to depreciate the assets based on the pre-defined
depreciation rates and method. PeopleSoft offers many depreciation methods to suit
regulatory requirements of various countries. The depreciation process determines
the amount of asset cost that can be recognized as an expense for that period. In
other words, the asset value is reduced by the depreciation amount. 
Like any other financial module, Asset Management creates accounting entries for
various asset transactions such as asset addition, cost adjustments, retirements, and
so on. A batch process known as Create Accounting Entries (AM_AMAEDIST) is used 
to generate accounting entries based on the accounting templates we define. 
All assets will need to be retired once they reach the end of their useful life. Other
events such as damage and accidents can also result in asset retirement. Assets can
be retired by scrapping, sale, donation, or any other method provided by PeopleSoft.
PeopleSoft allows complete or partial asset retirement. The system creates all
required accounting entries once an asset is retired.

a successful implementation, we'll consider a few critical setups in the following

An asset book is used to define cost and depreciation rules for assets. In real life,
organizations may need to follow multiple accounting policies and conventions
due to the different countries or states in which they operate. PeopleSoft allows us
to configure as many books as are needed and assigned to an asset. This approach
offers flexibility to process an asset in different ways to comply with multiple
regulatory requirements. 
Follow this navigation to set up an asset book:

Financials | Asset books 
The following screenshot shows the configuration page:
Let's say an organization headquartered in United Kingdom conducts its operations
the U.S. It needs to follow accounting conventions of the U.S. and the United
Kingdom for its assets. It can do so by maintaining two books: LOCAL (for the local
U.S. operations) and CORP (for the corporate headquarters). The number of books
required is driven by the reporting requirements of an organization. Note that
PeopleSoft allows the creation and maintaining of as many asset books as needed.

Configuring asset categories
Asset categories classify assets in logically related groups. These categories are
driven by the need to process accounting for various assets differently. Thus we 
can have asset categories such as Computing Equipment, Software, Servers, 
Vehicles, and so on. Of course, it is the organization's requirement which will 
drive this decision.

The following screenshot shows the asset category configuration page:
Specify the depreciation status, as well as the nature of assets such as intangible,
leased, or defined as investment property or property interest according to
international accounting standards.
Configuring asset profiles
Asset profile is one of the important AM configurations. A rule of thumb to 
follow is that we typically configure asset profiles for each of the defined asset
categories. If necessary, we can also create asset profiles at a more detailed level 
than the asset categories. 
We earlier mentioned that an asset can be assigned to as many books as needed. 
It is the asset profile that specifies the asset books. It also specifies the rules for
depreciation and taxation. When an asset is created, it is assigned to an asset profile,
thus inheriting all these rules. In a nutshell, asset profile works as the template for
asset creation and processing. The configuration values provided for an asset profile
will automatically default while creating an asset.

As you can see, we have defined an asset profile for the Software asset category
defined earlier. 
Asset Type: This field specifies the Oracle-defined type of asset. The
delivered values are Hardware, Software, Equipment, Property, Fleet,
Machinery, Furniture, Facility, Intangible, and Other.
Capitalized Asset: PeopleSoft treats the assets as Capitalized (those which
possess some cost and can be depreciated) or Expensed (such as stationary
items, which cannot be depreciated). The majority of the assets in AM system
will be capitalized, for which this checkbox needs to be selected. However,
there may be some assets which are expensed or fully depreciated, for which
the checkbox needs to be blank.
Index Name: You may have come across various indexes (such as Consumer
Price Index, Wholesale Price Index, and so on) that are used for calculating
inflation. This field specifies any index used to calculate an asset cost.

more asset books, click the + button at the right hand side of the page. 
Category: Select the asset category that we defined earlier.
Depr Status: Specify if assets belonging to this profile should be depreciated
or not. Available options are Depreciate and Non Depr.

Chapter 5
[ 207 ]
Convention, Retire Conv, Adjust Conv: These fields specify the conventions
used for depreciation, retirements, and asset adjustments respectively. A
convention essentially determines the timing and calendars for processing
the depreciation. 
Method: PeopleSoft delivers close to 20 different methods for depreciation.
These take care of commonly used depreciation methods (such as straight
line and declining balance), country-specific methods (such as those used in
Japan and Germany), or user-defined methods.
Useful Life: This field specifies the number of periods for which the asset
will be used. 
End Date: This date denotes the date when the system will stop depreciating
the asset.
Although we can't discuss each field on this tab, you can appreciate the fact that
we can specify different depreciation processing options for different books. As
mentioned earlier, this gives a great flexibility in terms of following different rules
for the same asset.
The next tab, Tax, is used to specify the tax-related attributes for the U.S., France, and
India. We'll not discuss the fields on this tab due to page constraints.
In AM, we can establish parent-child relationships between assets. The Child Asset
Inheritance tab is used to specify the attributes that a child asset can inherit from a
parent asset.
The following screenshot shows the Child Asset Inheritance tab:

Configuring cost types
We can configure as many cost types as are necessary for recording various asset
transactions. We'll see how cost types are used when we discuss the configuration 
of accounting templates.
Follow this navigation to set up a cost type:
Setup Financials/Supply Chain | Product Related | Asset Management |
Financials | Cost Types
The following screenshot shows the Cost Type configuration page:
Configuring transaction codes
Transaction codes are primarily used for categorizing asset retirements. 
PeopleSoft delivers a set of transaction codes that encompass possible methods of
retirements. These can be used as they are or modified if necessary. The delivered
values are A (Abandoned), C (Cannibalized), I (Inventory), IP (Investment Property),
N (Donated), R (Scrap), RV (Revaluation), S (Sale), T (Trade-in), and Y (Casualty). 
Follow this navigation to create or review transaction codes:

Financials | Transaction Codes
Configuring accounting entry templates
An accounting entry template performs the critical function of providing the account
values for creating accounting entries. It is based on the asset category, cost type, and
transaction type combination that we provide. The system automatically populates
the relevant accounting entry types for the specified inputs. 

Chapter 5
[ 209 ]
This is where we specify which account values should be used when we perform 
a specific transaction for a particular asset category. 
Follow this navigation to create an accounting entry template:
Setup Financials/Supply Chain | Product Related | Asset Management |
Accounting | Accounting Entry Templates
The following screenshot shows the Definition tab of the asset profile 
configuration page:
In this example, we have created a template for software asset category additions.
We provide the following input parameters to create the accounting template: SetID,
Asset Category, Cost Type, Transaction Type, Transaction Code and Account
Entry Template ID. 
The accounting entry types (such as Accumulated Depreciation, Expense, and so on)
are automatically populated by the system based on the input parameters. Provide
the account values for retrieved accounting entry types in the Account field. Thus,
when we add an asset belonging to this category, the system will know which values
to use while creating the appropriate accounting entries.

PeopleSoft Asset Management Module
[ 210 ]
Accounting entry templates need to be set up for all of the following
transaction types: ADD (Addition), ADJ (Adjustment), TRF (Transfer),
RCT (Recategorization), DPR (Depreciation expense), PDP (Prior
period depreciation), RET (Retirement), LPY (Lease payment), and INF
(Inflation adjustment).
Configuring depreciation conventions
Depreciation conventions specify when the depreciation for an asset should begin. 
It evaluates the asset's in-service date to determine a date when depreciation will
begin. For example, the convention Actual Day can be defined to instruct the system
to start asset depreciation from the day it was put into service. Another convention
(Following Month) means that depreciation should begin from the first day of the
following month after the asset is put into service. 
This is a two-step process where we need to configure a Depreciation convention
first and then configure Convention builder.
Depreciation convention
Follow this navigation to review or configure depreciation conventions:
Setup Financials/Supply Chain | Product Related | Asset Management |
Depreciation | Convention Definition
PeopleSoft provides various delivered conventions which can serve most
requirements. However, if needed, we can configure new conventions as well.
The following screenshot shows a sample of a user-defined depreciation convention:

Chapter 5
[ 211 ]
System Maintained: This checkbox is selected for all system-delivered
conventions. For conventions with this checkbox selected, the system does
not allow the date entry for the From Date, To Date, and Begin Depreciation
Date fields. 
Begin Depreciation Date: This section is used to specify the date ranges
and corresponding depreciation beginning date. In the example shown
previously, any asset that is put in service between January 1 and March 31
2011 will have its depreciation start date as March 31 2011. 
Convention Builder
Convention builder helps in generating the depreciation timelines for each period
for the convention defined earlier. Here we need to build a convention for a specific
calendar. Calendars are defined separately and represent how many periods a year
can have. 
Follow this navigation to access depreciation convention builder:
Setup Financials/Supply Chain | Product Related | Asset Management |

PeopleSoft Asset Management Module
[ 212 ]
Convention Type: This dropdown field determines the depreciation  
date for each date range in the grid at the bottom of the page. For example, 
if we select the value End of Month, the Begin Depr Date automatically  
is defaulted to the last date of the month. If User Defined is selected, we 
can specify when depreciation should begin in the Begin Depr Date 
Options section. 
Other options provided by PeopleSoft are End of quarter, End of year, 
Following month, Full year, Half year, Mid month, and Mid quarter.
Calendar Options: Specify if we need to build the convention for the entire
range of the calendar or just a part of it. In the previous example, we have
specified 2010 and 2011 as the years.
Begin Depr Date Options
Summary Periods: If we need to group calendar periods, specify the
number of periods in one group. Here we need to group six periods
(months) together.
Which Day, Which Month: Specify the month and day in a group
when depreciation should begin. 
Once these options are entered, click the Generate button. This generates the entries
in the Begin Depreciation Date section. As you can see, for each six-month period the
depreciation will begin from the first day of the first month in that group.
Configuring depreciation schedules
PeopleSoft delivers various tables that specify the depreciation percentage allowed
for each period. These schedules are based on IRS depreciation methods. 
Follow this navigation to review or modify the delivered schedules:

Chapter 5
[ 213 ]
As you can see, for an asset in its first period of first year of useful life, 62.5% of
its cost can be depreciated as an expense. In the second period, 57.29% can be
depreciated, and so on.
We usually don't need to make any changes to the delivered depreciation schedules.
Configuring depreciation limits
Depreciation limits are used to specify the maximum amount that can be claimed
as depreciation expense for a particular year. This limit can be set as an absolute
amount or as a percentage of asset cost.  The depreciation limit can be linked to the
asset profile, thus applying it to all the assets with that profile.
Follow this navigation to configure depreciation limits:

PeopleSoft Asset Management Module
[ 214 ]
The following screenshot shows a sample depreciation limit definition:
As you can see, based on this limit definition, there is a maximum amount defined
for first four years of asset life. Even if an asset's cost is high and its depreciation
amounts exceed the defined limits, the system doesn't allow that.  
Now that we have familiarized ourselves with basic asset management
configurations, let us discuss some of the important business processes.
Capital acquisition plans
As we briefly discussed earlier, capital acquisition plans are important to plan
future asset acquisitions. We link them to assets once they are acquired to track the
planned asset costs with the actuals. PeopleSoft allows us to create individual capital
acquisition plans as well as high-level plans with multiple subsidiary plans for
complex acquisitions.
Follow this navigation to create a new capital acquisition plan:

(CAP) Plan

Chapter 5
[ 215 ]
The following screenshot shows the Details tab of the page:
CAP Class: This field shows the PeopleSoft delivered options New,
Necessity, Cost Reduction, and Expansion. When we create a new plan, 
the status has to be New. 
CAP Details: As you can see, the given plan has more than one entry, as we
need to purchase two assets. 
Original/Adjustment Switch: When a new plan is created, the value
in this field must be Original. If we modify the existing plan, it will
need to be changed to Adjustment.
Scroll to the right to see additional information fields. 
Estimated Cost: Specify the approximate cost that we anticipate 
for an asset purchase.
Cost Limit: This field specifies the upper limit for the purchase 
cost. This is necessary as the asset costs can change by the time 
we purchase it. 
% Over Allowed: Instead of specifying the cost limit, we can also
specify the permissible % increase for the asset purchase cost.
The next four tabs (Financial Assets, Non- Financial Assets, Capital Lease
Payments, and Operating Lease Payments) show any assets belonging to these
categories that are linked to this plan.

Adding new assets
Recording an asset in the Asset Management system can be done in three 
different ways: 
Using online asset additions (manual)
Uploading assets details using Excel spreadsheets
Interfacing assets from external sources using Transaction Loader
Asset Management records two types of asset details: 
• 
Financial information: These details include all the elements needed for
accounting transactions of an asset, such as asset cost, books, depreciation
method, useful life, and so on.
• 
Physical information: These details include all the physical attributes such as
tag (serial) number, manufacturer, and so on.
An important feature offered by the AM module is the capitalization threshold.
Some organizations may need to capitalize their purchases as capital or non-capital
depending on the asset cost. We can specify an amount threshold beyond which
the system can automatically categorize the assets as capital. PeopleSoft offers the
following categories for the assets:
Capital assets: These are also known as financial assets. AM records the
financial as well as the physical information for these assets. All financial
details are stored in the COST table.
Non-capital assets: These are also known as non-financial or trackable assets.
For these, only physical information is recorded in the COST table. 
Expense assets: These are not tracked in AM system, as their cost is less than
the capitalization threshold. Such low-cost items are immediately expensed
rather than gradually depreciated like capital assets.
Online asset entry
PeopleSoft offers two different methods for online asset entry: Basic Add and
Express Add. Let's take a look at the basic asset add pages first.
Adding asset basic details

The asset entry component consists of various tabs that capture various asset details.
We'll discuss some of the important tabs now. 
The following screenshot shows the General Information tab of the basic 
add component:
CAP # and Seq #: These fields record the capital acquisition plan details.
Once we link an asset to the CAP, these details are automatically updated 
for the CAP. 
Asset Status: Choose the value In Service to indicate that the asset has been
put in use. If the asset is recorded now but is going to enter service later, we
can use the value Received.
Fair Value: We update the fair value of an asset on the Fair Value page. This
value is automatically displayed in this field. Click the Fair Value Details
hyperlink to update the details.
Parent/Child: This field determines the nature of this asset. Available options
are None, Child, and Parent. If the value None is selected, it means that this
asset is neither a parent nor a child. If we designate this asset as a Child, we
need to specify its parent asset in the Parent ID field.

Threshold ID: We discussed the concept of a capitalization threshold earlier.
If we define the threshold amounts, we can choose the threshold ID, so that
the system can automatically categorize the asset once it is capitalized. 
Profile ID: Assign an asset profile to the asset so that it inherits the 
profile attributes.
The asset can be capitalized by clicking the Capitalize button on the
Asset Acquisition Detail tab. We can record an asset and capitalize it
at a later point of in time if required.
Book Page: This hyperlink transfers the control to a new page that shows the
asset books to which this asset is assigned. Remember that we attach books
to the asset profile, from where they are inherited by the asset. The page
shows the same books and field values that we specified on the Asset Profile 
– Depreciation tab. However, if we wish to make any changes to the field
values at the asset level, we can. For example, if the useful life was specified
as 24 months for the asset profile, it is defaulted for the newly added asset as
well, but we can change it to, say, 36 months for this asset.
Operation / Maintenance, Asset Information, and Location/Comments/Attributes
tabs are used to record physical information details such as manufacturer
information, maintenance information, asset location, custodian information,  
and so on. 
Asset Acquisition Detail tab is used to record all the components of asset's cost 
that need to be capitalized. Note that when an asset is capitalized, it is customary 
to include freight charges, insurance charges, and so on to the asset cost. 
When we enter the basic asset information on the General Information tab  
and navigate to this tab for the first time, the asset is not yet capitalized. The fields 
on the Asset Acquisition Detail tab for a non-capitalized asset look like the
following screenshot:
•

Chapter 5
[ 219 ]
As you can see in the screenshot, the Amount field shows the asset cost, while other
fields such as Sales Tax, Use Tax, and so on show other cost components that need to
be added for capitalization. 
Capitalize: This dropdown menu shows the current asset status as To Be
Capitalized. If the asset should not be capitalized, we can choose the value To
Capitalize Later or Never Capitalize. 
Once all the cost rows are added, click the Capitalize button to capitalize the asset.
This makes the cost rows unavailable for modification and changes the Capitalize
field value to Already Capitalized. The following screenshot shows the changes to
the Asset Acquisition Detail tab after the asset is capitalized: 

PeopleSoft Asset Management Module

Adding express assets
Another way of quickly adding assets manually is by using the Express Add feature.
This feature allows the asset entry along with the accumulated depreciation. 
Follow this navigation to access the Express Add component to add assets:
Asset Management | Asset Transactions | Owned Assets | Express Add
The component consists of three distinct tabs for data entry. The following
screenshot shows the Cost/Asset Information tab:
Accum Depr in Current Pd: It is possible that the asset has already been in
use and was being tracked in some other system. As a result, it would have
already accumulated some amount of depreciation. This checkbox controls
how the accumulated depreciation of the asset being added is treated. If this
checkbox is selected, the accumulated depreciation is posted to the current
period, otherwise the system posts it to the previous period.
Asset Cost Information: This section is used to record the cost details. We
can add as many rows here to enter costs as needed. Click the Default Profile
button to automatically insert the lines based on the books attached to the
asset profile. 
The following screenshot shows the changes to the page after clicking the Default
Profile button:
•
•

Chapter 5
[ 221 ]
As you can see, the system populates the books which were assigned to the
COMPUTER asset profile. Enter the cost type and chartfield details. 
The Depreciation Information tab shows the depreciation parameters for each 
of the books associated with this asset. These are exactly the same as those on the
Depreciation tab for asset profile. If required, we can change any parameter for this
specific asset.
Tax Information tab is again similar to the Tax tab for the asset profile. The values
are inherited from the profile set-up and can be changed for this asset if needed.
Data entry on these three tabs is all we need as most of the details are automatically
defaulted from the asset profile.
Loading assets through interface
As a part of the Asset Management implementation, in most cases, we need to bring
in assets from an existing non-PeopleSoft system. Considering the huge volume of
assets involved, manual methods we saw previously are certainly not feasible. Also,
after the implementation, new asset details are regularly sent by non-PeopleSoft
systems as well as PeopleSoft Purchasing and Project Costing modules. PeopleSoft
offers a group of staging tables and a delivered interface program to load asset data
from these staging tables into the system.
The AM staging tables are as follows:
INTFC_FIN: This table stores the financial asset data
INTFC_PHY_A: This table stores the physical asset data
INTFC_PHY_B: This table stores the physical asset data.
•

PeopleSoft Asset Management Module
[ 222 ]
Loading the data into staging tables
If the source of asset information is a non-PeopleSoft system, we need to create a
customized program that can load the data into the given staging tables. If it is the
PeopleSoft module that sends the asset data, PeopleSoft delivers the program that
loads the staging tables.
Previewing/approving the staged data
PeopleSoft offers three pages where we can preview the data in each of the three
staging tables. The navigation for these pages is given in the following table:
Preview data in

Financial Information | Review
INTFC_PHY_A
Asset Management | Send/Receive Information | Approve
Physical Information | Review - A
INTFC_PHY_B
Asset Management | Send/Receive Information | Approve
Physical Information | Review - B
When the asset data is loaded into staging tables, we can decide to have the data to
be auto-approved, meaning it is loaded with its status as Approved. In case it needs
to be manually approved, transactions can be loaded with the Auto-Approved flag
set to No. In this case, each transaction needs to be manually approved so that it can
be loaded into AM.
The navigation for the approval pages is given in the following table:

Once the asset data is loaded into the staging tables, we need to validate it and
identify if there are any data errors.

The Run Control Parameters section on this page specifies the criteria to select the
data rows in the interface tables that need to be edited.
Interface ID, To Trans Load ID: Each time asset data is loaded into staging
tables all the transactions get a unique interface ID. This is helpful in
identifying each interface batch. Specify the interface IDs that should be
validated by the process.
System Source: Each data row in the staging table also carries the system
source information. Another way of filtering the data is by specifying the
system source that sent the asset data.
Interface Edit Options: This section lists the fields that need to be validated
by the edit process. If we don't use any of these fields, we can skip the
validation. Selecting the checkbox next to a field ensures that the system
validates the values in that field and logs error messages for any invalid
values. Uncheck the checkbox to prevent the validation of a field.

Processing depreciation
So far we have seen the basic configurations for performing depreciation and basic
depreciation concepts. Now let's see how PeopleSoft AM performs the depreciation
processing. PeopleSoft delivers the batch process Depreciation Calculation 
(AM_DEPR_CALC). This selects the assets based on the input parameters, refers to the
depreciation attributes specified for the asset, and calculates depreciation amounts. 
This process only populates values in the depreciation table. It does
not create any accounting entries.

asset is linked, along with the depreciation methods and conventions followed.
The next screenshot shows the next tab, Depreciation:

PeopleSoft Asset Management Module
[ 228 ]
This tab shows the year-wise depreciation amounts for the asset. 
The Net Book Value section shows the break up of cost and accumulated
depreciation for the CORP book as of a specific date. Net book value (NBV) is
essentially the difference between asset cost and accumulated depreciation so far. 
It indicates the remaining worth of an asset. In the given example, you can see that
the asset has been fully depreciated and its net book value is zero. 
Click the hyperlink for a year under the Year column to see detailed period-wise
depreciation amounts. The system automatically opens the Period Depreciation tab
and displays the depreciation amount for each period.
We can see the depreciation amounts for each of the books on this tab.
The next tab, Period Depreciation, contains the link Depr Accum Adjustment. 
This can be used adjust the accumulated depreciation for this asset. 
Clicking this link opens a new page where we can change the accumulated
depreciation amount. Let's say we find out that the total depreciation was incorrectly
calculated and we need to reduce the accumulated depreciation by $100.
After performing any such adjustments, we must run the Depreciation
Calculation process.
The following screenshot shows the adjustment made to the total depreciation:
We need to enter the adjustment amounts in the fields as shown and save the page.
This results in changes in the year-wise depreciation amounts and,  as a result, the
NBV of the asset. The following screenshot shows these changes:

Chapter 5
[ 229 ]
Understanding asset adjustments
An organization encounters various situations where changes need to be made to the
asset details. These changes can be related to the physical or financial data. Physical
asset details changes are limited to physical attributes such as color, weight, and so
on, and they don't affect the asset value or depreciation. On the other hand, changes
to financial data such as asset cost, category, depreciation convention, and so on
impact the depreciation calculations and have tax implications. 
PeopleSoft offers the following options for asset adjustments:
Addition: This option is used to make any additions to the asset cost. The
COST table in asset management tracks all transactions for an asset. This
option results in an additional cost line with the ADD transaction type in the
COST table. 
Adjustment: This option is used when a change (positive or negative) needs
to be made to the asset cost. Positive adjustment is similar to the addition
option given previously. However, the system adds a line to the COST table
with the ADJ transaction type.
Fixed price markup: This option is used while performing asset transfers to
apply a markup to the asset cost.
•

InterUnit transfer: This option is used to transfer assets from one BU to
another, where these BUs represent different legal entities. For example, an
organization decides to transfer a mainframe computer from its Chicago
office (business unit US001) to Paris operations (business unit FRA01). Note
that we can perform partial or complete asset transfers.
Recategorize: This option is used place an asset in a different category or
change its cost type. For example, we were using an asset category called
COMPUTERS. Now we decide to create a new category called LAPTOPS and
need to recategorize existing laptops and put them in this new category.
Revaluate: We discussed earlier the index for revaluing assets. According
to regulatory guidelines, assets need to be carried on company books at fair
value and need to be revaluated regularly. 
Transfer: This option is used for chartfield transfers within the same business
unit. For example, a truck that was being used by the Manufacturing
department needs to be assigned to the Field Service department. In this case,
the business unit remains the same, but we have to change the Department
chartfield value.

can be linked to multiple books. Thus, when we transfer or adjust an asset
in one book, the same needs to be performed in other books as well. These
fields offer the options Amount and Percent.
•

Chapter 5
[ 231 ]
Let's say that an asset is assigned to two books with costs as $1,000 and $800
and we adjust (increase) its cost by $100 in the first book, making it $1,100. 
If the Adjust Other Books By field contains the value Amount, the cost in
other book also increases by $100, making it $900. On the other hand, if the
Percent option is selected, the cost in second book increases by 10%, making
it $880.
Action: Select one of the options discussed previously from the dropdown
menu and click the GO! button.
The system opens the Cost Information tab where we can specify the changes to the
asset details.
The following screenshot shows the Cost Information tab when we select the 
value Addition:
Adjust All Rows By Percent, Quantity, or Cost: Use these fields to enter the
percent or amount by which the asset cost needs to be adjusted.
Let's say that we wish to increase the cost for the asset shown previously by $1,000.
So we need to specify the amount in the Cost field as shown next. Click the Apply
button to apply these changes. 
This automatically changes the asset cost from $50,000 to $51,000. Note that, even
if we see only one chartfield row in the previous example, there can be multiple
chartfield rows for an asset cost. For example, if the asset cost is being shared by 
two different departments in a 60:40 ratio, there will be two cost rows.
•
•

PeopleSoft Asset Management Module
[ 232 ]
One cost row will show $30,000 with department one and another with $20,000 with
department two. In this case, if we decide to adjust all rows by $1,000, the system
prorates the amount and adds $600 and $400 to these two rows respectively.
If we select the InterUnit Transfer option in the Main Transaction tab, the Cost
Information tab shows the following fields:
All other sections, such as Cost History and Edit Cost Information, are the same 
as given previously. In this case we need to specify the BU where this asset needs 
to be transferred. Enter a specific asset ID in the New Asset ID field or leave 
the default value NEXT as shown. The system will assign the next asset ID
automatically. This option is needed when we have to remove an asset from  
a BU and assign to another BU. 
Understanding asset retirements
Every asset needs to be retired at some point of its useful life. It can either serve 
its entire useful life and then retire or retire before completing its useful life.
Consider two scenarios to understand this. A laptop may be retired at the end of its
(hypothetical) useful life of five years. It is quite obsolete now and doesn't serve any
useful purpose. On the other hand, a truck (with a hypothetical life of 10 years) can
meet an accident just a year after its purchase and get completely damaged without
any chance of repair. Thus it needs to be retired prematurely. We'll later see various
methods by which we can dispose off the assets after retirement.
Just like asset transfers, we can retire assets fully or partially.
On the other hand, sometimes retired assets are brought back into service. This is
known as reinstatement.

Retire As: This dropdown menu lists various options by which an asset can be
retired. The available values are Abandonment, Auto-Retire Fully Depr Asset,
Cannibalize for Other Assets, Casualty Loss , Disappeared Assets, Disposal Due to
Theft, Donated to External Group, Expensed, Like Kind Exchange, Missing Asset,
Retirement by Sale, Returned to Inventory, Scrapped Assets, or Traded In for
Another Asset.
Based on the selected value, the page displays different fields. 
Removal Costs and Proceeds: These fields record the cost involved in
disposal of the asset and the income from the disposal respectively.
Convention: This option determines the date till which depreciation is
calculated for retired asset. Actual Day results in depreciation calculated till
the retirement date, Actual Month means depreciation is calculated till the
last day of the previous month, and Following Month results in depreciation
being calculated till the last day of the retirement month. 
Accum Depr: This field shows the accumulated depreciation for the asset
that has been calculated so far.

As you can see, the same page is used to reinstate a retired asset.
Auto-retirement of fully depreciated assets
PeopleSoft offers a batch process known as Auto-Retire (AMRETFDA) to retire 
multiple assets together. Note that this process picks up only those assets that 
are fully depreciated.

Cost Limit: We can specify a threshold for asset cost, so that the process can
retire only those assets with a cost of less than a specified amount.
Creating accounting entries
Because Asset Management is a part of financial applications, one of its important
functions is to maintain accounting entries for various asset transactions. We saw
that PeopleSoft offers the following delivered transaction types: ADD, ADJ, TRF,
RCT, DPR, PDP, RET, LPY, and INF. These represent various transactions for which
accounting entries are created. 
In PeopleSoft AM, there are two different processes that create accounting entries:
Accounting Entry Creation (AM_AMAEDIST), which creates accounting entries
for all non-depreciation transactions 
Depreciation Close (AM_DPCLOSE), which creates accounting entries only for
depreciation in an accounting period 
Every time a transaction such as asset addition, adjustment,
transfer, and so on is performed, the system creates an open
transaction. This transaction remains open till it is processed by
one of the previous processes. 
Accounting entry creation (AM_AMAEDIST)
process
When the Accounting Entry Creation process runs, it looks at the combination of
asset category, cost type, transaction type, and transaction code for each transaction.
Recall our discussion about the accounting entry template setup. Based on the given
combination, it selects the appropriate template and uses that information to create
accounting entries. This process can be executed as many times as needed. 
Follow this navigation to execute the Accounting Entry Creation process:

The following screenshot shows the run control page for the process:
The Business Unit and Book Name parameters (indicated by an asterisk) are
mandatory. Enter a range of asset IDs in the From Asset ID and To Asset ID fields
or leave them blank so that the process creates accounting entries for all assets for a
given BU and book. 
If assets in a BU are tagged to multiple books (which most probably will be the 
case), the process needs to be run for each BU and Book combination. In order to 
do that, add a new section by clicking the + button and specify all required  
BU and Book combinations.
We can review the asset's accounting entries after the accounting entry creation
process completes successfully. 
Follow this navigation to review accounting entries:
Asset Management | Accounting Entries | Review Financial Entries
The following screenshot shows the accounting entries generated for an asset:

Chapter 5
[ 237 ]
As you can see, this asset has five accounting entries with two lines each. The
transaction type ADD means that the entry was created during asset addition. The
remaining entries with DPR transaction type denote depreciation accounting entries
created at the end of each month.
Depreciation Close (AM_DPCLOSE) process
The Depreciation Close process creates the accounting entries for depreciation for an
open accounting period. It uses the DPR (Depreciation) and PDP (Prior depreciation
period) accounting templates. 
The Depreciation Close process should be run only once for each
accounting period. No transaction activity should be performed
after this process is run.
The process creates accounting entries as follows:
DR  
Depreciation Expense
CR  
Accumulated Depreciation
•
•

PeopleSoft Asset Management Module
[ 238 ]
The Depreciation Close process offers two run options: 
Rerun Deprecation Close: When this option is selected and no accounting
entries exist, the process creates the depreciation accounting entries. If the
entries are already created, no action takes place. 
Reverse Posted Entries: When this option is selected and journal entries are
already created, the process reverses these entries. 
Running the process with both of the previous options selected results in old
accounting entries being reversed and new depreciation accounting entries created
with new depreciation amounts.

Loading reporting tables
We already discussed how PeopleSoft calculates depreciation using the Depreciation
Calculation batch process. The AM module offers various delivered depreciation
reports such as Depreciation by Period, Depreciation by Fiscal Period, and
Depreciation Activity. In order to use these depreciation reports, we first need to
execute a batch process known as Load Reporting Table (AMDPREPT). 
Follow this navigation to run this process:
Asset Management | Financial Reports | Load Reporting Tables | 
Depr Reporting Table
The following screenshot shows the run control page used to specify the 
process parameters:
This process loads the depreciation details for assets in the Depreciation Reporting
table (DEPR_RPT). All of the depreciation reports derive their data from this table, so
it is important to load it using the batch process regularly. 
Use Open Trans: When this checkbox is selected, it instructs the system
to process only the new open transactions. Recall that we saw that open
transactions are created after any asset additions or adjustments. Leave 
this checkbox blank to specify the From Year and To Year values for 
asset depreciation.
Keep Other Fiscal Years: This option instructs the system to retain the
depreciation data for earlier years, which is loaded in the table. 
•

PeopleSoft Asset Management Module

Reviewing open transactions
As we briefly saw earlier, open transactions are created when we perform asset
additions or adjustments. Each asset open transaction can have multiple transaction
types, such as addition, retirement, reinstatement, and so on, associated with it. 
Open transaction review is important because it allows us to know the asset
processing status.
Follow this navigation to review open transactions for an asset:
Asset Management | Depreciation | Open Transactions | Review
The following screenshot shows the open transaction details for an asset for the ADD
(Asset addition) transaction type:
Depreciation Calc Status: This field shows the status of depreciation
performed for this asset. A status of Complete means that the depreciation
has been calculated.
Acctg Entry Creation Status: This field tell us if accounting entries have been
created and sent to General Ledger. 
Reporting Process Status: This field indicates if depreciation details 
for this asset have been loaded into the reporting table. A status of 
Pending explains that this asset has not been processed by the Load
Reporting Table process.

Chapter 5
[ 241 ]
 The OPEN_TRANS table in PeopleSoft Asset Management is crucial in maintaining 
the asset transaction history. All operations performed on an asset are recorded in 
this table. For example, an asset is added, its value may be adjusted, it may be 
re-categorized, or it may be transferred to another business unit. The system inserts 
a row in the OPEN_TRANS table for each transaction with one of the types that  
we discussed earlier.
Summary
The Asset Management module is used to maintain an organization's fixed assets.
These assets are characterized by the need to capitalize and depreciate them. New
assets can be added using online pages or loaded automatically using the delivered
interface program known as Transaction Loader. 
Assets can be linked to multiple asset books to ensure that they can be processed
differently according to different accounting regulations. An asset profile sets the
default rules for asset processing, such as the depreciation method to be used, which
are inherited by assets using that profile. This significantly reduces the new asset
data entry efforts. If needed, these default rules can be overridden for an 
individual asset. 
PeopleSoft delivers a set of transaction types that describe all possible actions 
(such as addition, adjustment, retirement, and so on) that we can perform.
Accounting templates define the accounts to be used for each combination  
of asset category, cost type, transaction type, and transaction code. 
Asset Depreciation is calculated for each accounting period. It indicates the 
amount of total asset cost that is recognized as expense in a period. The 
Depreciation Calculation process is used to calculate depreciation amounts 
for assets based on the rules defined for asset profile or asset. 
Assets need to be retired when they reach the end of their useful life or even earlier.
Retired assets can also be reinstated into service if required. 
The accounting entry creation process is used to generate accounting entries for all
non-depreciation transactions. The depreciation close process creates entries for
depreciation transactions. This is run once at the end of every accounting period.
The load reporting table process is used to load the depreciation reporting table.
PeopleSoft's depreciation reports are based on this reporting table.


PeopleSoft Accounts Payable
Module
PeopleSoft Accounts Payable module is one of the critical modules in the 'Procure 
to Pay' business process. In accounting terms, accounts payable means the amount
that we are liable to pay to others. Usually, it is the next piece of the procurement
activities after the PeopleSoft Purchasing module. A typical organization purchases
a large number of goods and services from many vendors. Handling payments for
these purchases in a timely manner is a critical task for the organizations. Accounts
Payable (or AP as it is commonly known) module records invoices sent by vendors
and tracks them to see when the payments for them are becoming due. It then issues
the payments for eligible vendor invoices at the appropriate time. It also creates
accounting entries for the vendor invoices and payments. In brief, AP is responsible
for tracking and managing vendor invoices and payments.
In this chapter, we'll discuss the following topics:

miscellaneous charge codes, and payment terms)

Understanding Accounts Payable
process flow
In PeopleSoft parlance, a vendor invoice is known as a voucher. We'll use this term
throughout the chapter. You may recall from our discussion of Billing and Accounts
Receivable modules, that an organization sells to its customers, sends an invoice
and then receives the payments at a later point of time. Similarly, when it purchases
something from a vendor, it usually receives the invoice along with the goods. The
invoice amount needs to be paid later depending on the purchase terms.
The following schematic shows the basic Accounts Payable process flow:
The Accounts Payable business process begins with the recording of a vendor
invoice as a voucher. PeopleSoft offers manual as well as automated methods  
to create vouchers. For automated voucher creation, a group of staging tables is 
used. A batch process known as Voucher Build loads the data from these staging
tables into AP to create vouchers. We can also upload voucher information from a
pre-configured spreadsheet template. Another way to create vouchers is from the
invoice details entered in PeopleSoft eSettlements module.
Once vouchers are created in AP system, there are various operations that may have
to be performed. A voucher may have to be approved before a payment is made to
the vendor; it may need to be deleted (say, due to incorrect entry) or closed (when
we need not pay it anymore). These activities are known as voucher maintenance. 

Chapter 6
[ 245 ]
Organizations need to have very strict controls in place before any vendor payments
are issued. It is critical to ensure that we don't simply rely on the vendor invoice and
pay the invoice amount. PeopleSoft offers four different methods where a voucher
can be matched against the purchase order, goods receipt, or inspection of received
goods. A batch process known as Voucher Matching performs the validation based
on pre-defined match rules. This ensures that we pay for only those things that we
ordered and actually received. 
Similar to other PeopleSoft financial modules, Accounts Payable module too creates
accounting entries for various transactions. Voucher Post process generates accounting
entries for vouchers that recognize the liability to the vendor. 
Vendor payment processing is one of the most important aspects of AP module.
PeopleSoft offers various payment methods by which we can create payments for
purchased goods or services. A batch process known as Pay Cycle automates the
selection of eligible vouchers and creation of payments through check printing, EFT,
ACH, drafts, and so on. It can also calculate any applicable discounts.
Payment Post process creates accounting entries for the payments. Once a voucher is
paid, it is closed in the system and the vendor liability is nullified. 
Withholding is a process by which appropriate taxes are calculated for vouchers 
and the tax amount is automatically deducted from the payment made to the 
vendor. Depending on the requirements, system can generate a withholding
payment to the tax authority while creating vendor payment. On the other hand,
if required, it can just record the liability for the tax authority and track the net
withholding amount payable. 
Understanding Accounts Payable
concepts
When organizations need to purchase something, they typically create a purchase
order (referred as PO) and send it to the vendor. For example, to purchase 10 file
cabinets from Furniture Inc. at the price of $500 each, an organization can create a
PO that specifies the required dimensions, delivery terms, payment terms, quantity,
price , and so on. When it receives this shipment, a goods receipt is created to
document how many of the ordered cabinets were actually received. These activities
are performed in PeopleSoft Purchasing module. 

PeopleSoft Accounts Payable Module
[ 246 ]
Now by this time Furniture Inc. would have sent the invoice for this purchase. This
invoice amount can include not only the purchase price for ten cabinets but probably
other expenses such as shipping costs, insurance charges, taxes, and so on. The
invoice also typically carries applicable payment terms (that specify by which date
we need to pay). It also may include any discounts if the payment is made before a
certain date. Most of the business transactions take place on credit basis. Therefore,
when we receive the file cabinets, we still haven't paid Furniture Inc. In accounting
terms, we have a liability to pay the seller (or to put it simply, we owe Furniture
Inc.). When we receive the vendor invoice, a voucher (which records the invoice
details) needs to be created in PeopleSoft. 
When this voucher is posted, the system typically creates an accounting entry 
as follows:
DR 
 
Expense (Storage equipment)  
$5000
CR 
 
Accounts Payable 
 
 
-$5000
Before we issue a check to Furniture Inc., it is important to verify that we are paying
for the right quantity. For example, we ordered 10 cabinets, but if the vendor sent an
invoice for 11, we should not end up paying $5500. Thus we need to carefully cross
check the invoice against the goods receipt and pay only $5000. Also, it is possible
that one of the 10 cabinets was completely damaged in transit or the vendor shipped
only 9 cabinets. In such cases, it is obvious that we should pay only $4500. This is
where we need to perform matching of the voucher with the original purchase order
and goods receipt before it is paid.
Let's assume that voucher passes the matching validations and can be paid. The pay
cycle process can evaluate the payment due date and checks if we can get any early
payment discount. When the payment is created (let's say by a check) and posted, the
system creates the following accounting entry:
DR 
 
Accounts Payable 
 
$5000
CR 
 
Cash 
 
 
 
-$5000
Thus, now the liability is eliminated and the voucher is closed. 
Note that this was a highly simplified example. In reality, the accounting entries may
include discounts, taxes, and so on. 

Chapter 6
[ 247 ]
Understanding common configurations
We will discuss some of the important configurations in respective sections such as
matching, payment processing, and so on. In this section, we'll take a look at some of
the common configurations that are applicable for the entire module.
These configurations include the following:
Configuring accounting templates
Configuring voucher origins
Configuring miscellaneous charges 
Configuring payment terms 
Configuring accounting templates
In the given sample accounting entries, we saw that the system needs the chartfield
values for cash, accounts payable, and expense accounts. While the expense account
is provided by the purchase order or manually specified on the voucher, values for
cash, and accounts payable are derived from accounting templates. 
Follow this navigation to configure accounting templates:

The following screenshot shows a part of the accounting template page:

PeopleSoft Accounts Payable Module
[ 248 ]
The system lists various accounting entry types for which we can specify the default
chartfield values.
Organizations typically use multiple accounts for Accounts Payable,
Discount , and so on. To address this requirement, we can configure
multiple accounting templates. As we'll see next, different templates
can be specified for different voucher origins. If needed, we can also
manually specify a template on the voucher as well.
We'll see how an accounting template is assigned to a voucher origin in the 
next topic.
Configuring voucher origins
Voucher origins identify the source of vouchers entering AP system. Vouchers can
be entered online manually or may be loaded from various external sources. Various
configuration options associated with origin help in specifying the ways in which
vouchers should be processed. Each voucher must have an origin.
In Accounts Payable system, the hierarchy for defaulting the processing options 
is as follows: 
Business Unit (at the top)
Voucher origin
Control group
Vendor
Voucher (at the bottom)
Any processing option at any level automatically defaults to all the levels below
(if no value is specified at the lower level). However a processing option value at a
lower level overrides the default value from level above. 
For example, let's assume that we specify USD as the default currency for the AP
business unit. If no currency is specified at any other level, system automatically
uses USD from the level above. However, if GBP is specified for a voucher origin, all
vouchers with that origin will inherit GBP and not USD as their currency (assuming
that no currency is specified for control group and vendor).

The following screenshot shows the Accounting and Pay Options tab of a sample
voucher origin:
Voucher origins are important to establish different processing rules for different
groups of vouchers. Even if all vouchers are processed similarly, we can still define
different origins to logically segregate vouchers. For example, if we enter vouchers
online, as well as receive through interface from two external systems, we can define
three origins to identify where vouchers came from. 
It is mandatory that at least one voucher origin be configured. 
Accounting Date Options: This section specifies the accounting date for
vouchers with this origin. Choose Default to use the option specified for AP
business unit. Choose Current Date option so that system automatically uses
the voucher entry date as accounting date. 
Accounting Template: Specify a template that we discussed earlier.
Vouchers with this origin will use the default chartfield values defined 
in the specified template.

Late Charges: This section is used to specify if late charges are calculated for
vouchers paid after their due dates.
The following screenshot shows the Vouchering Options 1 tab of voucher origin:
Voucher Approval: This field specifies if vouchers need to be approved after
they are entered. Available options are:
Default from higher level: This option instructs the system to use the
approval option specified at the AP business unit.
Pre-approved: This option ensures that vouchers with this origin are
approved as soon as they are created. There is no additional approval
process needed.
Approval framework: System uses business rules configured using
approval framework feature. These are pre-configured rules, which
can be modified if required.
Virtual Approver: This approval mechanism requires configuring
the approval rules using application designer by technical team
members. Selecting this option enable Business Process and Approval

The following screenshot shows the Vouchering Options 2 tab:
Duplicate Invoice Checking: This section specifies the options for 
ensuring that duplicate vouchers are not entered. From the given set of five
parameters, we can decide which parameters need to be considered. In the
previous example, the system checks the combination of invoice number,
vendor number and business unit to see if a voucher with this combination
already exists. If such a combination is found, we can instruct the system to
take appropriate action: Reject (which prevents the error voucher from being
saved), Recycle (which allows the voucher to be saved but not processed any
further) or Warning (which just shows a warning message but allows the
voucher to be saved and processed).
Chartfield Editing: This section is used to specify the action to be taken if a
voucher has an invalid chartfield combination. Selecting the No Edits option
prevents the system from performing chartfield combination validation. 
Voucher Balancing: This section specifies how the system should handle
out of balance vouchers (where sum of line amounts does not match total
voucher amount).
Tax Options: This tab specifies the sales tax and VAT options for this origin.
Note that similar configuration options exist for all the levels of hierarchy.

Configuring miscellaneous charges
When we receive an invoice from the vendor, there may be various costs and
charges that need to be recorded apart from the actual item cost (which is known
as merchandise amount). The invoice may include freight expenses (shipping
cost), insurance cost, various taxes , and so on. These are known as miscellaneous
charges. If we wish to record all these elements separately, we need to configure
miscellaneous charge codes.  
Follow this navigation to setup miscellaneous charge codes:
Set Up Financials/Supply Chain | Product Related | Procurement Options |
Charges/Costs | Misc Charge/Landed Cost Defn
The following screenshot shows a sample code defined for insurance costs:
We can define as many miscellaneous charge codes as required depending on
organization's requirements:
Type: Each code needs to be given a category from the following available
options: Freight Expense, Miscellaneous Charge Expense, Sales Tax
Expense, Use Tax Expense, and VAT Input Non-Recoverable.
Prorate: This checkbox if selected, results in miscellaneous charges to be
prorated (proportionately divided) among all voucher lines. Otherwise, the
charge amount is recorded separately on the voucher.
Calculation Method: This field specifies how the miscellaneous charge needs
to be calculated. For example, insurance cost can be a percentage of total
invoice amount (as shown) whereas the freight cost can be calculated on the
weight of the item.

Landed Cost Component: PeopleSoft Cost Management module calculates
the landed cost of purchased item. This checkbox (if selected) indicates that
the miscellaneous charge needs to be included in the inventory cost. Selecting
this option enables the Landed Cost Component Info section, where
additional options for Cost Management module can be specified.
Merchandise Vendor Charge: If selected, this field denotes that the vendor
is charging this particular cost. If it is not checked, it means that another 3rd
party vendor is charging for these services.
Configuring payment terms
Each credit sale transaction is accompanied by payment terms. The purchaser agrees
to pay the seller after a certain number of days. In addition, some times the seller
accepts to give a discount if the payment is made within a specific time limit.

In industry terms, Net 30, Net 60 , and so on, means that last day for the
payment is 30 days, 60 days , and so on respectively. 
Net Due Terms: This section specifies the last day of the payment. Timing
ID field indicates the number of days available for an organization to make
the payment. 
Discount Terms Available: Select this checkbox if vendor has agreed for any
discount for the early payment. This enables the Discount Terms section.
Discount Terms - Timing ID: Specify the number of days within which
discount can be availed.
Discount Terms Percent / Discount Terms Amount: Specify the discount 
as % of invoice amount or a flat amount in these fields.
Entering vouchers
PeopleSoft offers various methods of entering vouchers such as: manual entry,
spreadsheet upload and through automated voucher interface. As we have seen in
case of other modules, manual voucher entry is suitable for low volume scenarios,
while using the automated interface is ideally suited for bringing in vouchers from
external systems in large numbers. Let's familiarize ourselves quickly with these
different methods.
Manual voucher entry
PeopleSoft offers the following types of vouchers:
Regular vouchers: These are the most widely used standard vouchers.
Adjustment vouchers: These are used to make debit or credit adjustments to
an existing voucher.
Journal vouchers: These vouchers are used to modify accounting entries of
an already posted voucher.
Prepaid vouchers: If we have made any advance payments to a vendor, these
vouchers are used to record the same.
Register vouchers: In certain situations (such as VAT applicable purchases),
we may need to create and post vouchers without knowing the accounting
details. Register vouchers are used to record such transactions against
suspense (temporary) accounts. Once the chartfield details are known,
register vouchers are unposted and correct details are recorded.

Reversal vouchers: These are used to reverse accounting entries of an
already posted voucher.
Single payment vouchers: These vouchers are used to make a one-time
payment to a vendor, without defining that vendor in the system.
Template vouchers: In order to reduce data entry efforts, we can create
templates to be used for entering regular vouchers.  
Third party vouchers: These are used to record non-merchandise costs such
as shipping, insurance , and so on. 
The fields on the voucher entry pages are different for these different voucher types.
However, we will discuss only the regular voucher entry.

In the previous example, let's say that we purchased two mountain skis from a
vendor. They were priced $4500 each, while the insurance and freight costs came 
to $300 and $750 respectively. 
As you can see, we record the invoice number, vendor ID, payment terms,
miscellaneous charges, and freight charges in the appropriate fields. We can click 
the currency selector icon next to the Miscellaneous, Freight, Sales Tax, Use Tax fields
to enter the miscellaneous charge codes (that we configured earlier) and amounts. 
Voucher line details can be entered by adding multiple lines in the Invoice 
Lines section. In our example, we have a single invoice line where we have 
recorded the item ID (product number in our database), unit price, quantity 
and total merchandise cost.
Copy From Source Document: In the previous example, we manually entered all the
voucher details. We can also create it by copying the data on an existing voucher, a
voucher template, purchase order or a goods receipt, so that all voucher details are
automatically populated by the system. We can select the appropriate value from the
Copy From dropdown menu and click GO hyperlink to select a source document.
The following screenshot shows the Distribution Lines section where we enter the
accounting information for given invoice line.
The account value in this section is used for the Expense line of the
voucher's accounting entry.

The following screenshot shows the Payment tab of voucher.
Scheduled Due: This field shows the date when the voucher will be picked
up for payment. 
Net Due, Discount Due: These fields show the date when the voucher is due
for payment and the day before which discount can be availed. As can be
seen, the last date for paying the given voucher is 11th February, although
discount for this voucher is available if it is paid before 22nd January. 
Payment Options: This section contains fields such as the bank, bank
account, payment method , and so on. If we select the Hold Payment
checkbox, this voucher is not picked by the pay cycle process. This continues
until the checkbox is unchecked.
All these field values are automatically defaulted by the system based
on the values specified at the business unit / voucher origin / vendor
/ control group. However they can be changed at the voucher level if
necessary.
Schedule Payment: This section controls the payment action for the voucher.
When the Action dropdown menu contains the value Schedule, the pay
cycle picks it up when it is due and automatically creates the payment. If 
we decide to manually write a check and issue it, select the value Record in
this field. This enables other fields in this section where we can record the
payment date and check number, and so on.

Voucher creation through automated interface
As discussed earlier, AP vouchers can be created from various external sources.
Other PeopleSoft modules (such as Order Management, Purchasing) as well as
non-PeopleSoft systems can send the voucher data. PeopleSoft offers a group of
staging tables (VCHR_HDR_STG, VCHR_LINE_STG, VCHR_DIST_STG, VCHR_PYMNT_STG,
VCHR_MSCH_STG, VCHR_BANK_STG, VCHR_IBANK_STG, and VCHR_VNDR_STG) that can
store the interface data. In addition, an interface program known as Voucher Build 
(AP_VCHRBLD) loads the data from these staging tables into AP to create vouchers.
Voucher Build process can create vouchers from data stored in locations other than the
voucher staging tables. For example, ERS vouchers are created from the goods receipt and
purchase order data.

Understanding matching
As we discussed briefly previously, voucher matching is a critical feature for any
Payables system. It serves as an important business process control for organizations
to ensure that they pay only for those goods and services that they ordered and
actually received. PeopleSoft offers the following matching methods:
Two-way matching: Vouchers are compared against purchase orders
(created in Purchasing module) to ensure that we pay for what we ordered.
Three-way matching: Vouchers are compared against purchase orders
and goods receipts (created in Purchasing module) to ensure that we pay
for what we ordered and actually received. This is used when we order
something and make it mandatory to create goods receipts.

Chapter 6
[ 261 ]
Four-way matching: This method is used where receiving as well inspecting
the received goods is mandatory. Vouchers are compared against purchase
orders, goods receipts and goods inspections (created in Purchasing module)
to ensure that we pay only for what we ordered, actually received and
passed our quality control.
Receipt-only matching: This method is used when we receive goods 
without creating purchase orders. Vouchers are compared against 
non-PO goods receipts.
Each matching method is suitable for different scenarios and organizations choose
the method that is best suited for their business conditions. 
If a voucher fails the matching due to any inconsistency, it is flagged as an exception.
We can either override the match exception or correct the inconsistency and rerun
the matching process. If configured accordingly, a voucher with match exception
cannot be paid.
Some of the important steps involved in the matching process are as follows:
Configuring match rule types
Configuring match rules
Configuring match rule controls
Running the matching process
Clearing match exceptions on matching workbench
Configuring match rule types
PeopleSoft delivers a large number of match rules that can cover many diverse
business requirements. These rules are categorized into the following types: System,
Data entry, Merchandise – Quantity, Merchandise – Unit Price, Merchandise 
– Amount, and Summary/Global match only.

User List Source: This section is available only if the workflow flag is
selected. Here we specify which users should be notified in case of match
exceptions. The user group can be specified as those with a specific role or
through a SQL definition or a query.
Action: This field determines which action should be taken by a match rule
from this category. Available options are: Match (change the voucher line
status to Matched), Exception (mark a voucher line as Exception), Debit
Memo (create a debit memo for the difference amount where voucher
amount doesn't match), Override (change the status of a voucher line to
Matched without changing the underlying reason).

Each match rule needs to be assigned to a match rule type and
inherits the options specified for its parent match rule type.
Configuring match rules
A match rule is essentially a condition against which the vouchers are tested. 
If the voucher fails that condition, it is marked as an exception.

Use Tolerance at Rule Control: We can specify the tolerances for match
rules. For example, we can specify that the system should accept any
differences between voucher quantity and received quantity, as long as the
difference is less than 5% of voucher quantity. Select this checkbox to allow
such tolerances to be specified on match rule control (which we'll discuss in
the next section).
Configuring match rule control
A match rule control is collection of match rules that need to be used during the
matching process. An organization needs to use only some of the delivered match
rules depending on its requirements. Also, if necessary, tolerances can be specified
on the match control.

'S'. These cannot be deleted from the match rule control. 
Add any additional rules by clicking the + button.
If Rule is True, Take Action: This field specifies the action to be taken when
a match condition comes true (for example, voucher quantity is not equal

Post Voucher: The process posts the specified vouchers.
Maintaining vouchers
As part of regular business process, there are many situations where voucher
processing flow needs to be stopped. It can be due to incorrect data entry, disputes
with vendors, and so on. PeopleSoft AP module offers three different actions for
maintaining vouchers: Deleting, Closing, and Unposting. We'll briefly discuss 
these actions.
Deleting vouchers
A voucher can be deleted only if all the following conditions are satisfied:
It is not posted.
It is not selected for payment.
No part of the voucher has been paid.

When a voucher is deleted, it can't be accessed from any PeopleSoft page. 
To understand the voucher deletion, consider a scenario: A voucher for a vendor 
is entered. Before it is posted, it is found out that item shipped by the vendor was
defective and was returned with no return charges. As a result, we no longer need 
to pay the vendor and the voucher can be deleted.
Follow this navigation to delete a voucher: 
Accounts Payable | Vouchers | Add/Update | Delete Voucher
Closing vouchers
A voucher can be closed only if all the following conditions are satisfied:
It is posted.
It is not selected for payment.
It is not fully paid.
When a voucher is closed, the remaining liability amount is written off and the all
voucher processing is considered complete. Closing a voucher automatically creates
reverse accounting entries for the open liability amount (in other words, expense
account is credited, while the liability account is debited). Once closed, no changes
are allowed to the voucher.
Consider the earlier scenario once again where a purchased item was returned due
to a defect. However, by the time we discover the product defect, the voucher is
already posted. We have returned the item and decided not to pay the vendor. As
the voucher is posted, it can't be deleted. However we can close it, so that there is no
remaining vendor liability.
Follow this navigation to close a voucher: 
Accounts Payable | Vouchers | Add/Update | Close Voucher
Unposting vouchers
Unposting a voucher simply reverses the accounting entries that are created during
the voucher post process. Once unposted, we can change the chartfield information
for the voucher.

PeopleSoft Accounts Payable Module

Consider a scenario where we post a voucher and discover that a wrong value is
used for the Department chartfield. Technically speaking, we can close the voucher,
but then it'll need to be reentered with correct chartfield details. We can unpost the
voucher instead, correct the Department value and post it again.
Follow this navigation to unpost a voucher: 
Accounts Payable | Vouchers | Add/Update | UnPost Voucher
Processing payments
Creating payments for vendors and issuing them is one of the critical aspects of
PeopleSoft AP module. PeopleSoft offers a wide range of payment methods that can
be used to create payments: ACH (Automated Clearing House), System Check, Wire
Transfer, Electronic Funds Transfer, Drafts, Giro-EFT and Letter of Credit. A batch
process known as Pay Cycle (AP_APY2015) is used to select the eligible vouchers and
create payments for them. 
We'll discuss the following important steps involved in payment processing using
the Pay Cycle:
Configuring pay cycle steps
Configuring pay cycle step group
Specifying payment selection criteria
Executing pay cycle batch process
Configuring pay cycle steps
Pay cycle is a group of multiple steps, each responsible for a specific task. Each step
is essentially a different program. For example, if we are processing check payments,
it involves distinct steps such as Payment selection (where eligible vouchers with
payment method of 'Check' are selected), Payment Creation (where actual payment
records are created in the system), Printing checks (using pre-printed or blank check
stock), Creating a positive payment file (to be sent to the bank as a confirmation for
printed checks), and so on. 
The steps involved in a pay cycle are different for different payment methods. To
give another example, if we are processing EFT payments, it involves other steps
such as EFT Format (which formats the electronic payment file in the appropriate
format), Print EFT advices (which creates payment advices / records with details of
EFT payments). PeopleSoft delivers a set of pay cycle steps (that is, programs) for
handling all the required payment methods.

Chapter 6
[ 271 ]
We may not need to use all the given pay cycle steps (if we don't
use all the payment methods. On the other hand, depending on
the organization's requirements, we may need to create our own
customized steps.
Follow this navigation to access the pay cycle step page:

The following screenshot shows a step—Payment Selection:
Job Type: This field shows the nature of the process that is defined in 
this step. Available options are Info (which indicates that this step is not 
a process to be run on process scheduler) and Process (which means that
this step is an independent background process that we can see on process
scheduler for its completion).
Process Type: This field shows the PeopleSoft technology (such as SQR,
Application engine, and so on.) used to develop the process step. 
Process Name: This field shows the name of program used for the pay 
cycle step. 
Configuring pay cycle step group
A step group is a collection of required pay cycle steps. As we saw earlier, each step
has a unique objective. If an organization uses only Check as payment method, it is
obvious that it doesn't need steps such as EFT Format. 
A step group consists of relevant pay cycle steps along with their possible statuses
and run levels. We can create as many step group as needed for different scenarios.
The pay cycle process uses the specified step group and executes the steps in it.

The following screenshot shows a sample step group for check payments:
In the previous example, we have added the following required steps for check
processing: Payment selection, Payment creation, Print Checks, Confirm check
references (this step confirms the check numbers that will be used for the new
checks), Format positive payment (this step formats the positive pay file to be sent to
the bank as check confirmation) and Produce positive payment file.
Run Level Status: This field indicates all the possible pay cycle statuses when
a step can be started. 
Run level: This field specifies whether a step affects transactions for the
entire pay cycle run or an individual bank. Available options are Pay Cycle
and Bank.

Specifying payment selection criteria
Now we have built the structure of the steps that need to be followed for our pay
cycle. In addition to this, we also need to specify the parameters used to select
eligible vouchers for creating the payments. 
Follow this navigation to specify the payment selection criteria:
Accounts Payable | Payments | Pay Cycle Processing | Payment Selection Criteria
The following screenshot shows the Dates tab of the page:
Pay From Date, Pay Through Date: These fields specify the date range for
vouchers to be selected. All eligible vouchers with scheduled pay date in this
range are selected for payment. 
Payment Date: This is the date that is assigned to all the generated payments.
Change Selection Dates: Select the appropriate option (Days/Weeks/
Months) and use the Increment/Decrement buttons to automatically change
the date range. This is useful for reusing the pay cycle with only a change in
date range.

not and if approval is required, by whom. Available options are None (no
approval required), User and Certifier. If approval is required, the approver
needs to access the pay cycle on the Pay Cycle Approval page.
Step Group: Specify a step group to instruct the pay cycle which steps 
need to be executed. In this example, we are using the CHECK step group 
we configured earlier.

TR (Treasury settlements from Treasury modules), TRET (Treasury EFT
payments) and VCHR (AP vouchers).
Business Unit: Specify vouchers from which business units need to be
selected for paying.

and bilateral netting.
Thus, when the pay cycle is run, it selects only those vouchers that satisfy all the
specified criteria.

Check the selected vouchers using the Summary or Detailed hyperlinks.
Run the Payment Creation step.
Run the Trial Register report to see the payments that are created  
in the system.
Approve the pay cycle.
Run subsequent steps in the Pay Cycle Results section.
Note that this sequence is a generic one and may be different from the way your
organization processes pay cycles.
Posting payments
Payment posting process creates accounting entries for the payments (by debiting
the liability account on the voucher and crediting the cash/bank account specified
for the bank account). Of course this is the simplest form payment accounting entry,
as it may involve additional lines for withholding, discounts, and so on.

The following screenshot shows the Cancel Payment page:
The upper half of the page shows details of the payment that we wish to cancel. The
lower half shows various options available for canceling the payment.
Payment Status: This field controls the how the payment needs to be canceled. The
options and their description are given in the following table:
Payment Status
Description
Void
Void a payment if it is created but not yet released. For
example, when checks are printed and it is found that one of
them is incorrect, it can be voided.
Stop
Stop a payment when it is released. For example, after we print
the check and mail to the vendor, we discover that it was sent to
the wrong address. In such a case, stop the payment.
Undo Cancel
Use this option to reverse any cancelation that you already may
have done for a payment. For example, we cancel a payment
(by voiding or stopping) and then realize that it should not have
been done. 
We can undo a cancelation only if the canceled payment was
not posted. 

Chapter 6
[ 281 ]
Cancel Action: This field determines the corrective action after the current payment
is canceled. The following table explains the options and their objectives:
Cancel Action
Description
Re-Open Voucher(s)/Re-Issue
This option makes the voucher (associated
with the canceled payment) available for
paying when the pay cycle runs next time.
Thus, the payment can be reissued. 
Use this option when there is some problem
(such as some of the checks were damaged
during printing process) and the payment
needs to be reissued. 
Re-Open Voucher(s)/Put on Hold
This option puts the payment for associated
voucher on hold by automatically selecting
the Hold Payment flag on the voucher's
Payment tab. The payment is not processed
until this flag is not checked. In this case, the
Hold Reason needs to be selected.
Use this option where we cancel a payment
and need a manual review (such as incorrect
amount on the voucher) of the voucher
before it is reissued.
Do Not Reissue/Close Liability
This option ensures that the canceled
payment is no longer reissued. Any liability
for the voucher is closed.
Escheating payments
Sometimes, the payments created by the pay cycle are not claimed by their intended
vendors. For example, we create a payment but the vendor goes out of business and
there is no one to claim the payment. Another commonly encountered situation is
when mailed checks are returned due to incorrect addresses. In some countries, these
payments need to be handed over to the government authorities. This process is
known as escheating the payments.
Follow this navigation to access payment escheatment page:
Accounts Payable | Payments | Cancel / Void Payments | Escheat Payment 

PeopleSoft Accounts Payable Module
[ 282 ]
The following screenshot shows the Payment Escheatment page:
Payment Status: This field controls the escheatment action. The options and their
description are given in the following table:
Payment Status
Description
Escheated
Use this option to mark the payment as escheated. This
automatically selects the Cancel Action field value as
Escheated.
Stale Dated Payment
Use this option to mark the payment as stale dated instead of
escheated
Undo Escheatment
Use this option to cancel the escheatment that we may already
have done for a payment. This removes the Escheated status
of the payment.
Withholding
In many countries, organizations withhold (deduct) a percentage of the payment (as
a tax to the government) while issuing payments to their vendors. For example, our
organization purchases goods worth $10,000 from Computers Inc. Assume that this
purchase attracts 30% tax for the vendor. In this case, Computers Inc. (seller) is liable
to pay $300 on the sale of $1000. However, this tax amount is deducted by the buyer
while issuing the payment itself and directly paid to the government. In other words,
the purchasing organization will create a payment for only $700 for Computers Inc.
Remaining amount of $300 is directly paid to the government.

[ 283 ]
PeopleSoft AP withholding feature can be used to address withholding 
requirements of various countries. Although it is not possible to discuss 
the entire process and related configurations, we'll take a quick glance at 
some of the important configurations.
Withholding configurations 
Important withholding configurations are withholding rules (which specify the %
of voucher amount that needs to be deducted), types and classes (country specific
withholding needs), jurisdictions, and entities (organizations that govern taxation
for a country, such as Internal Revenue Service for the USA). Withholding entity is
a critical configuration, as this is where we specify the withholding remit vendor (to
whom we need to pay the deducted tax amounts), applicable withholding classes
and other controlling information.
Any vendor, for whom the tax amount needs to be withheld, needs to be designated
as a withholding applicable vendor. This is done by selecting the Withholding
checkbox for that vendor.
We also need to define the layout and contents for the withholding reports.
All the given configurations result in the withholding control details being populated
on the voucher for a withholding vendor. If required, these details can be overridden
and modified.
Processing withholding 
Processing vendor withholding consists of the following important steps:
Ente ring withholding vouchers: When a voucher is created for a vendor
that is setup as a withholding vendor, is automatically considered eligible for
withholding processing. However, a user can mark some or all voucher lines
as not withholding applicable.
Calculation of withholding amounts: Actual withholding tax amounts are
calculated during voucher posting or payment posting process, depending
on the setup.
Paying withholding vouchers: There are two ways in which withholding
payment can be created depending on the system setup. One possible way is
creation of two separate payments (one for the vendor and the other for the
withholding amount). The other way is creating only the vendor payment
and recording a liability for the future withholding payment.

PeopleSoft Accounts Payable Module
[ 284 ]
Posting withholding transactions: PeopleSoft offers a batch process 
(AP_WTHD) to post the withholding transactions. This process loads
the voucher and payment details into the withholding transaction tables.
Subsequent withholding reports are created from these tables. Note that
payment posting process must be run before this process. 
Performing withholding adjustments: After the withholding transactions
are posted and reviewed, sometimes they may need to be adjusted. This can
be done either manually or using a batch process (AP_WTHD_UPDT). 
Generating withholding reports: At the end of the accounting year,
statutory withholding reports need to be sent to the relevant tax authorities.
PeopleSoft can create withholding reports in various formats or a data file
that can be electronically transmitted.
Summary
Accounts Payable   module is an important part of the procure-to-pay process and 
is responsible for recording, tracking and processing of vouchers (vendor invoices).
It also performs the critical task of creating vendor payments.
Vouchers can be manually entered or brought through an interface using the
Voucher Build process. Vouchers maintenance process includes voucher deletion,
voucher closing, and voucher unposting. Voucher Matching is an important
process that validates the vouchers before they are paid. PeopleSoft offers four
different methods of matching, where vouchers can be validated against purchase
orders, goods receipts, or inspections. We need to configure match rule control that
determines which match rules need to be used for the matching process.
Pay Cycle process is used to create vendor payments. PeopleSoft supports a large
number of payment methods. A step group contains the payment steps required to
process and create payments for a specific payment method. Pay cycle process is
driven by the step group and executes the steps in it. Pay cycle manager is used to
process a pay cycle. 
Voucher posting creates accounting entries for vouchers, while Payment posting
process creates accounting entries for the payments.
Withholding processing enables an organization to automatically deduct the
applicable tax amount for vendor vouchers. We can address the withholding
requirements of various countries in PeopleSoft Payables module.

PeopleSoft General Ledger
Module
So far we have discussed the sub-modules in the PeopleSoft financial applications. 
As we previously saw, all these modules create accounting entries and send 
them to General Ledger. It would not be an exaggeration to say that General
Ledger is the heart of the PeopleSoft financial applications. This module performs
the critical function of consolidating the accounting information from various
sources (PeopleSoft modules as well as non-PeopleSoft systems) and performing
management reporting. We can generate important financial statements such as
the Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement from the data
consolidated by the module. We discussed most of the important building blocks
of General Ledger (such as chartfields, journals, and ledgers) in Chapter 1, PeopleSoft
Financials Fundamentals. 
In this chapter, we will discuss the following topics in greater detail:
Understanding journal entry methods (such as manual journal entry, using
the Journal Generator process, and flat file journal import)
Journal processing (the Journal Edit process, and the Journal Post process)
Understanding interim and year-end closing
Understanding allocations
Understanding journal processing
Journal is a mechanism to record accounting entries in a summarized form. There
are multiple ways in which journals are created in the General Ledger. In Chapter 1,
PeopleSoft Financials Fundamentals, we saw how we can configure accounting entry
definitions, accounting entry templates, and journal sources. Now we'll explore other
aspects such as journal creation, editing, and posting.

PeopleSoft General Ledger Module
[ 286 ]
���������������
There are four ways in which journals can be created: 
1. Manually from journal entry pages
2. Using the Journal Generator process to create journals from other PeopleSoft
modules as well as non-PeopleSoft systems 
3. Spreadsheet journal upload 
4. Flat file import 
Let's discuss these methods in detail.
Using the Journal Generator process
Journal Generator is used to create journals from PeopleSoft sub-modules as well as
accounting entries generated and sent by external non-PeopleSoft systems. As we
have previously discussed, each sub-module such as Billing, Accounts Receivable,
and so on, creates accounting entries for its transactions. Journal Generator uses
various configurations to create journals from the accounting entries. 
Follow this navigation to execute Journal Generator: 
General Ledger | Journals | Subsystem Journals | Generate Journals
The following screenshot shows the run control page for the process:

Chapter 7
[ 287 ]
In order to generate journals for a PeopleSoft module, the following important inputs
are needed:
Input
How it helps in creating journals
Ledger group
A ledger group specifies the various ledgers that are included in
it. This specifies the ledger where these journals are ultimately
recorded. Recall that a ledger group is linked with a Ledger
Template, which specifies the database tables to store the
journal and ledger data. Thus this field drives the destination for
journals that will be created. In the previous example, we have
specified that new journals should be posted to the ledgers in
the RECORDING ledger group. 
Accounting definition
An accounting definition specifies the source from which
journals need to be created. You may recall that an accounting
entry definition specifies the table that holds accounting entries
for a module. It also drives how journal summarization needs to
happen. In the example shown, we have specified that journals
should be created for the Billing module and it should select 
the accounting entries from the BI_ACCT_ENTRY table as
configured for the BIDEFN accounting definition.
Template 
A journal generator template specifies the type of transactions
in a module, for which journals should be created. It also
determines any prefix to be used for newly created journal IDs.
In our example, we are creating journals for billing invoice
transactions. These journals will have IDs such as BIXXXXXX, as
BI_BILLING template specifies that BI prefix be used for these
journals.
Application Business Unit: Depending on the accounting entry definition
that we enter, this field shows the list of business units for that module. For
example, if the value BIDEFN is used, this field prompt makes all Billing
business units available for selection. Select a BU to create journals.
Journal Processing Options: This section gives options to run additional
processes apart from the Journal Generator. Selecting Edit automatically
triggers the Journal Edit process which validates the new journals. Selecting
Budget Check automatically triggers the Commitment Control Budget
Processor which checks if sufficient budget is available for the new journals.
Selecting Post automatically triggers the Journal Post process which posts the
new journals to the ledger.
•
•

PeopleSoft General Ledger Module
[ 288 ]
Assuming that all process options are selected, the processes are executed
in this sequence: Journal Generator | Journal Edit | Budget Processor
(optional, used only with commitment control) | Journal Post. Before
running any process, all the previous processes must be executed.
The SetID, Accounting definition, and date parameters are mandatory. A value can
be specified in the remaining fields, or they can be left blank. 
Note that we can enter multiple sets of input parameters by using the + button to
add more sections.
Click the Run button to initiate the Journal Generator process.
Manual journal entry
While most of the journals are created from other modules through Journal
Generator, a significant number of situations need manual journal entry. A journal,
like many other transactions such as a Billing invoice or AP voucher, consists of a
header and one or more journal lines. Let's quickly see how it is done.
Follow this navigation to create a new journal: 
General Ledger | Journals | Journal Entry | Create/Update Journal Entries
The following screenshot shows the Header section of a journal:

Chapter 7
[ 289 ]
Ledger Group: Select a ledger group where this journal needs to be posted. 
Ledger: Specify a ledger value within the ledger group where the journal
needs to be posted. Note that a ledger group may contain multiple ledgers.
We can post this journal to all those ledgers by leaving this field blank or
only post it to a specific ledger by specifying it in this field. 
Auto Generate Lines: This checkbox is important if we need to post a journal
to multiple ledgers simultaneously in a ledger group. You may recall that the
Keep Ledgers in Sync option for a ledger group ensures that entries need 
to be posted to multiple ledgers. If this option was selected for the ledger
group (specified on this page), then the Auto Generate Lines checkbox also
needs to be selected. If the journal needs to be posted to a single ledger, this
checkbox can be left unchecked.
Adjusting Entry: Usually at the end of a period or a financial year, manual
adjusting entries are passed to close the balances of revenue and expense
accounts. This field identifies if the journal entry is adjusting or not. Select
from the available options of Adjusting Entry or Non-Adjusting Entry.
Once the journal header details are entered, enter the journal line details on the 
Lines tab. 
The following screenshot shows the Lines section of the journal:
As you can see, this journal has two lines: a debit line for $10,000 to account 500000
and a credit line for the equal amount to account 100000. Once we scroll to the right,
additional chartfields are visible. We record the amounts and chartfield details for
the journal in this tab.
The Totals section at the bottom of the page shows a summary of journal lines for
each business unit.
•
•
•
•

PeopleSoft General Ledger Module
[ 290 ]
A journal may contain lines for multiple GL business units.
A hyperlink in the Journal Status column shows if the journal has any errors. A
value of 'N' indicates that there are no errors. Clicking the status value opens the
Errors tab, which shows errors in the journal header as well as lines.
Process: We already briefly discussed some of the journal batch processes.
We can initiate these processes from the journal entry page itself to process
the current journal immediately. Select a value from the dropdown menu
and click the Process button to perform an action. The available options are
as follows:
Budget Check Journal: Runs the Commitment Control Budget
Processor.
Copy Journal: This option opens the Journal copy page used to create
a copy of the journal.
Delete Journal: The current journal is deleted.
Edit Journal: The Journal Edit process is triggered.
Edit Chartfield: This option initiates the Chartfield Edit process,
which validates if chartfield values are correct. It also validates if the
correct chartfield combinations are entered on the journal.
Post Journal: The Journal Post process is initiated.
Print Journal (Crystal), Print Journal (XMLP): This option initiates
the print process for the current journal using Crystal report or XML
Publisher, which are different reporting technologies used  
by PeopleSoft. 
Refresh Journal: All journal details are reloaded and refreshed.
Submit Journal: The journal is submitted for approval through 
the workflow.
Totals: This tab is used to enter any control totals for debit and credit sides.
This is useful to track any discrepancy between the sum of all entered line
amounts and control amounts. 
Approvals: This tab is used if journal approval workflow is used. This tab
shows the current approval status of the journal. An approver can select
the appropriate approval action and submit the journal. Available approval
options are Approve, Deny, and Recycle (send back to the previous user
without approving or denying).

Understanding intraunit and interunit journals
Let's consider two different scenarios to understand the concept of interunit 
and intraunit transactions. We'll then discuss the creation of interunit and 
intraunit journals.
Scenario 1
Assume that an organization has two business units (US001 and UK001) for its U.S.
and UK operations respectively. Now the US001 unit needs to purchase a critical
part of machinery from a UK-based vendor. Let's say that, due to certain business
reasons, the UK unit purchases this part and makes a payment on behalf the U.S.
business unit. Of course, the U.S. unit will need to reimburse the UK unit for the
purchase at a later point in time. 
Thus, when UK001 receives the purchased item, it creates a liability to pay the
vendor. At the same time, it creates another accounting entry to record a receivable
amount from the US001 unit. Such a transaction involving two or more different
business units is known as Interunit transaction.
Scenario 2
Assume that the U.S. operations of this organization (business unit US001) has two
departments (MFG and SALES) representing Manufacturing and Sales respectively.
Now a purchase of an item is made by the Sales department on behalf of the
Manufacturing department. As each of these departments may have their own
departmental spending budgets, they'd need to track such transactions for settling
(reimbursing) later. 
Similar to the previous scenario, the Sales department will create a receivable 
entry to record the amount due from the Manufacturing business unit. Such
transactions between two different entities (represented by chartfields such as FUND /
DEPARTMENT) from the same business unit are known as Intraunit transactions.
PeopleSoft automatically creates the balancing Receivable / Payable entries between
the involved entities.
PeopleSoft sub-modules such as Purchasing, Accounts Payable, and so on
automatically create interunit and intraunit accounting entries. We can
also manually create interunit and intraunit journals in General Ledger. 

PeopleSoft General Ledger Module
[ 292 ]
Creating an interunit journal entry is quite straight-forward. Recall that the business
unit value on the Journal-Header tab (called the Anchor Business Unit) is the
same (US001) as that on the Journal-Lines tab in our given sample example. If we
enter a BU value on the journal lines that is different from the anchor business unit,
PeopleSoft recognizes that journal as an interunit journal. The Journal Edit process
then creates the balancing journal lines. 
In order to create intraunit journals, we first need to identify the chartfield that needs
to be used as the balancing chartfield. Recall our discussion of the Ledger Group 
– Balancing tab from Chapter 1, PeopleSoft Financials Fundamentals where we do that.
If we anticipate departments in an organization to create intraunit transactions, 
the Department chartfield will be designated as the balancing chartfield. Similar to
creating interunit journals, if we enter multiple values for the balancing chartfield,
the journal is recognized as the intraunit journal. 
Understanding flat file journal entry
You may encounter many scenarios where PeopleSoft General Ledger needs to
import journals created in external non-PeopleSoft systems. Note that this option is
different from using Journal Generator for non-PeopleSoft systems. 
Journal Generator can be used to create journals only when external
non-PeopleSoft systems send accounting entries to the interface table
JGEN_ACCT_ENTRY. The flat file import feature is used when the
non-PeopleSoft systems send the actual journal header and lines data. 
PeopleSoft delivers a pre-defined layout for the journal data in a flat file format.
There are five possible types of records in the data file depending on the first
character in a data row. The following table lists those types:
Record type
Description
# (Comments)
This record type is used to record any comments. It should not be
used to record any accounting data.
H (Journal header)
This record type includes all the header details (such as Business
Unit, Journal ID, Journal date, and so on) similar to what we have
seen on the Header tab of the manual journal entry page.
L (Journal line)
This record type includes all the journal line details (such as line
number., chartfields, amounts, and so on) similar to the Line tab of
the manual journal entry page.

Chapter 7
[ 293 ]
Record type
Description
V (VAT line)
Includes the VAT details for the journal such as physical nature,
VAT amount and so on.
C (Control totals)
Contains control details such as the number. of journal lines, debit,
and credit control totals for each combination of Business Unit and
applicable chartfields.
Note that the journal data files need not contain all the record types.
However, it must have the Journal Header, Journal Line, and Control
Totals records at minimum.
Once the data file containing journal header and line details is ready, a batch 
process named Load Journals From a Flat File (GL_JRNL_IMP) needs to be
executed. This process reads the data from data file, loads them into PeopleSoft, 
and creates journals.
Follow this navigation to run the process:
General Ledger | Journals | Import Journals | External Flat Files
The following screenshot shows the run control page for the flat file journal 
import process:
Validate Chartfields: This field specifies the type of chartfield validation
that the system performs on the journal data in the file. The available options
are Account & Alternate Account (only these two chartfields are validated),
All Common Chartfields (the system validates all chartfields except Project
Costing related chartfields), and None (no chartfields are validated). 
•

PeopleSoft General Ledger Module
[ 294 ]
Journal ID mask: This field is used to specify the prefix for the journals that
are created from the flat file. This is used to identify journals from this source.
Note that this prefix is needed only if the flat file does not contain the journal
ID in the header record.
Add: Use this button to upload a data file. The attached file name is shown
on the page.
Click the Run button to initiate the process.
It is important to run the Journal Edit process to validate the journals
after they are created from flat file. This needs to be done before
accessing these journals from the online journal pages.
Using the journal edit process
Once journals are created in General Ledger, they must be validated using the Journal
Edit (GL_JEDIT) process. This process performs various validating actions to ensure
that all chartfield values and their combinations are valid and that the journal debit
and credit amounts are in balance. As we saw in the manual journal entry section, we
can initiate the Journal Edit process from the journal entry page itself. However, this
mode of running the process edits only a single journal. PeopleSoft offers another way
of running the process in batch mode to process multiple journals.
Follow this navigation to initiate the Journal Edit process in batch mode:
General Ledger | Journals | Process Journals | Edit Journals
The following screenshot shows the run control page for the process:
•
•

Chapter 7
[ 295 ]
As you can see, we can use various input parameters to select journals to be edited.
As the note on the page says, leaving a field blank results in the process selecting all
the values for that field.
Various checkboxes at the bottom of the page are used to instruct the system to
process additional steps such as Journal Post, Budget Check, and so on.
Note that Edit checkbox is always checked on the Journal Edit run control page.
Mark Journal(s) to Post: A journal must be marked for posting so that it can be
picked up by the subsequent Journal Post process. If this checkbox is selected, the
Journal Edit process marks the valid journals for posting. If this is not done, the
journals need to be manually marked for posting using a page. 
Click Run to initiate the process.
Using the journal post process
The final step in the journal processing is that of posting them to General Ledger.
When we post a journal using the Journal Post (GLPPOST) process, its amounts update
the final balances for appropriate chartfield combinations in the LEDGER table. A
journal must be validated by the Journal Edit process and not have any errors to  
be posted. 
Follow this navigation to initiate the Journal Post process in batch mode:
General Ledger | Journals | Process Journals | Post Journals
The following screenshot shows the run control page for the process:

PeopleSoft General Ledger Module

Again, as you can see, the page shows various fields to be used as the input
parameters for deciding which journals to select for posting.
Click Run to initiate the process.
Understanding interim and year-end
closing
Closing is an important process in the accounting calendar of an organization. 
Before discussing how PeopleSoft handles this function, we'll spend some time 
in understanding this important accounting concept. 
All accounts are categorized based on the financial statement they appear on. 
Thus all Revenue and Expense accounts are called Profit and Loss Accounts, 
as they appear on the Profit and Loss statement, while Asset, Liability,  
and Equity accounts are known as Balance Sheet Accounts. 
While the profit and loss statement, also known as the Income Statement, shows 
an organization's revenue and expense status at a particular moment in time, the
balance sheet shows the accumulated balance of its assets, liabilities, and owners'
equity. At the end of the financial year, all profit and loss accounts need to be closed
and their balances transferred to the balance sheet in the form of net profit or loss.
This net balance is transferred to a special purpose account known as Retained
Earnings. This process is known as Closing.
Although closing needs to be performed at the end of each financial year, many
organizations also do it at the end of every accounting period as well. This is known
as Interim Closing.
Let's consider an example to help us understand this process further:
Assume that an organization uses two revenue accounts and two expense accounts
for its operations. Let's say that it follows a financial calendar from January 1 through
December 31, with 12 accounting periods (corresponding to each month). The
accounts details are as follows:
Account ID
Type
Description
100000
Revenue
Software revenue
150000
Revenue
Hardware revenue
200000
Expense
Manufacturing expenses
250000
Expense
Advertising expenses
900000
Equity
Retained earnings

Chapter 7
[ 297 ]
Of course, this is a highly simplified example, as a typical organization uses
hundreds of different accounts. Now assume that these accounts have the following
balances on the last day of the financial year:
Account ID
Debit Balance
Credit balance
100000
- 20,000
150000
- 30,000
200000
25,000
250000
15,000
Revenue accounts always have a credit balance, while the Expense
accounts always have a debit balance. Asset accounts also always
have a debit balance, while Liability and Equity accounts always have
credit balance.
Now the profit and loss accounts are closed by passing an accounting entry and
transferring the balance to the retained earnings account (900000) as follows:
Debit/Credit
Account
Description
Amount
Accounting Entry 1
DR
100000
Software revenue
20,000
CR
900000
Retained earnings
-20,000
Accounting Entry 2
DR
150000
Hardware revenue
30,000
CR
900000
Retained earnings
-30,000
Accounting Entry 3
DR
900000
Retained earnings
25,000
CR
200000
Manufacturing expenses
-25,000
Accounting Entry 4
DR
900000
Retained earnings
15,000
CR
250000
Advertising expenses
-15,000

PeopleSoft General Ledger Module
[ 298 ]
As a result of these accounting entries, the balances of all the revenue and expense
accounts become zero, while the balance of the retained earnings account is as 
shown next:
Retained Earnings Account (900000)
Debit
Credit
-$20,000
-$30,000
$25,000 
$15,000 
Total debit: $40,000
Total credit: $50,000
Net balance: $10,000 credit (profit)
Unlike the revenue and expense accounts, which are closed every year, balance 
sheet accounts carry over their balance from one year to the next. They are never
closed. Thus, the retained earnings account, belonging to the Equity category, 
carries over its balance. When an organization makes a profit, a credit balance is
transferred to the retained earnings. If it incurs a loss, a debit balance is transferred 
to retrained earnings. 
The retained earnings account balance appears on the
balance sheet on the credit side.
System defined adjustment periods:
An accounting year consists of various accounting periods. If an organization follows
a 12-period accounting year, each period corresponds to a calendar month. On the
other hand, if it uses a four-period year, then each accounting period corresponds to
a quarter (three months). In most of the cases you'll encounter a 12-period calendar
with periods ranging from one to 12. Each accounting entry must be recorded in an
accounting period.
However, there are additional periods that are used to record adjustments to the
previous accounting periods. We can define additional adjustment periods (such
as 901, 902, and so on, for actual accounting periods one, two and so on). These are
the user-defined periods. In addition, the PeopleSoft system uses three adjustment
periods for the closing process. These periods are described in the following table:

Chapter 7
[ 299 ]
Period
Purpose
0
As we discussed earlier, balance sheet accounts carry forward their balances
from one year to the next. Period 0 is used to store the account balances from
previous year. For example, if the cash account contains a balance of $10,000
at the end of period 12 (the last period) of 2010, it is carried over to period
zero of 2011.
998
This is the default adjustment period for recording manual adjustment
entries. For example, at the end of the year, we may need to adjust the
accumulated depreciation of a particular asset. If no other user-defined
adjusting period is specified, the system records it to the period 998.
Recall the 'Adjusting entry' option on the journal header tab. It is used while
creating manual adjustment entries.
999
This period is used to record the accounting entries for the year-end closing.
In the previous example, when we transfer the balances from the revenue
and expense accounts to the retained earnings account, the entries use
period 999.
Offset accounts:
In the previous example, the profit and loss accounts were closed directly into the
retained earnings account. This can be done for the interim as well as year-end
closing process. However, PeopleSoft offers another option for interim closing. 
In this case, profit and loss accounts are closed to an offset account instead of
retained earnings account. 
Now that we are familiar with the concepts, let's see the relevant PeopleSoft
configurations and processes for the same. Let's assume that account 950000 is
defined as the Retained Earnings Offset. Thus when we want to close the revenue
account 100000, we close it as follows:
DR 
A/C 100000 (S/W Revenue)
20,000
CR 
A/C 950000 (Ret. Earnings
Offset)
-20,000
As a result, it is the offset account that holds the final account balances, and each
interim close process posts the balance to this account rather than the retained
earnings account. At the end of the financial year, another entry is passed to close 
the offset account as follows:
DR
A/C 950000 (Ret. Earnings Offset)
20,000
CR
A/C 900000 (Ret. Earnings)
-20,000

PeopleSoft General Ledger Module
[ 300 ]
Understanding the PeopleSoft configurations
for closing process
The following configurations are necessary to perform the closing process:
ChartField value sets: A value set identifies the chartfields that need to be
used for the closing process
Closing rules: These rules define various processing options that control the
interim as well as year-end closing processes
Creating chartfield value sets
A chartfield value set is nothing but a group of chartfields. As we saw earlier,
revenue and expense accounts need to be processed in the closing process. As there
are hundreds of accounts that need to be closed, using a value set greatly simplifies
the process. 
Follow this navigation to create a chartfield value set:
Set Up Financial/Supply Chain | Common Definitions | Design Chartfields |
ChartField Value Sets | Setup ChartField Value Sets
The following screenshot shows a sample value set for specifying various expense
accounts related to manufacturing costs:
•
•

Chapter 7
[ 301 ]
In the previous example, we assume that an organization uses many accounts, from
100001 to 110000, to record various manufacturing costs. Rather than specifying all
these accounts individually for closing, it is much easier to create a value set and
specify it.
Values by Chartfields – Field Name: We can specify as many chartfields as
needed. In the previous example we have used Account, which will usually
be the chartfield that must be specified.
How Specified: This field determines how the chartfield values are specified.
The available options are Selected Detail Values (where we can specify
individual chartfield values), Range of Values (where we can specify 'from'
and 'to' values, and all values between them), and Detail-Selected Parents 
(where we can use trees to specify required values).
Configuring closing rules
This is an important configuration that sets the rules to be used in the 
closing process.
Follow this navigation to create a closing rule:
General Ledger | Close Ledgers | Closing Rules 
The following screenshot shows a sample closing rule for interim closing: 
Closing rules for year-end closing and interim closing need to be defined
separately. Some of the configuration options for interim closing rules
are not seen on the year-end closing rules.

PeopleSoft General Ledger Module
[ 302 ]
Ledger Template: A closing rule needs to be associated with a ledger
template that we define for an organization's ledgers. It determines that the
chartfields are available for the closing process.
Closing Scope: This section is available only for interim closing rules.
Options in this section are used to define the scope of balance amounts that
need to be closed.
Scope: Available options are Incremental Current Period (account balances
for the entire current period are closed), Incremental Year to Date (account
balances entered since the last closing process till the close process run date
are closed), and Incremental Year to Curr Period (account balances created
from period one till the end of current period are closed).
Adj Periods Included: This field specifies the adjustment periods to be
closed during the interim closing. 
The following screenshot shows the Net Income/Retained Earnings tab. 
This tab specifies the source for closing process and the destination retained 
earnings account(s):
Close To Multiple Ret Earnings: We can decide to close the expense and
revenue account balances to a single retained earnings account or multiple
accounts. In other words, we can specify different retained earnings accounts
for different sets of source accounts. Selecting this checkbox allows the
system to use multiple retained earnings accounts. If it is unchecked, the
system uses the default account specified on the Closing Options tab.

[ 303 ]
Chartfield Value Set: Select a set of chartfields, as discussed in the previous
section, to close account balances from these accounts.
Retained Earnings: Specify the target retained earnings account where the
account balances need to be transferred.
Offset Chartfields: This option is available for interim closing only. Specify
the account to offset retained earnings accounting entries.
Journal Options: This tab, shown in the following screenshot, is used to
specify parameters for creation of journals containing the closing entries.
Journal ID Mask: This field specifies if the closing journals need to have a
prefix to identify them. If no prefix is needed, the value NEXT is used so that
the system automatically assigns the next journal ID.
Create Journal Entries: If selected, this checkbox instructs the system to
create journal entries for the closing process. This is optional for year-end
close, while interim close always creates journal entries.
Edit Journals, Budget Check Journals, Post Journals: These options 
are available only for interim closing. Select these checkboxes so that 
the system automatically runs the corresponding process for the newly
created closing journals.
Roll Forward Options: This tab shows options for carrying forward the
profit and loss accounts.
Configuring a closing process group 
A closing group is a collection of closing rules that we wish to execute. We can have
one or multiple closing rules in a closing group. 
Follow this navigation to create a closing process group:

The following screenshot shows a sample close group created for interim closing:
As you can see, the closing process group contains only one interim closing rule.
However, if needed, additional closing rules can be added by using the + button.
The Close process does not have an option to specify whether we
wish to run interim close or year end close. In order to do that, define
separate closing process groups containing interim and year end close
rules respectively. Whenever we wish to perform an interim close,
simply use a process group containing interim close rules. To perform
year-end close, use a process group containing year-end close rules.
Running closing process
Follow this navigation to run the Ledger Close (GLPCLOSE) process:
General Ledger | Close Ledgers | Request Ledger Close 
The following screenshot shows the run control page for the close process:

Chapter 7
[ 305 ]
Close Request Type: PeopleSoft offers the option of reversing the close
process in case of an error. Select a value in this field, either: Close to perform
the close process or Undo to reverse an already-performed close process.
Closing Group: Select an appropriate closing group in this field, depending
on whether we need to perform interim or year-end close.
The Interim close process is not mandatory, but most of the
organizations perform it at the end of each accounting period. This helps
in keeping the retained earnings account updated regularly. Interim
close is similar to the year-end close except for the fact that it does not
carry forward balance sheet accounts to period zero of the next year.
Check Only, Do Not Process: The Close process during its execution
performs various validations such as checking if all chartfields, chartfield
values, and retained earnings accounts are valid. Select this checkbox and
run the process to perform only these validations.
Click on the Run button to initiate the process.

Understanding allocations
Processing allocations is an integral part of accounting processes. An organization
incurs various expenses that later need to be allocated (distributed) among various
units using certain parameters. These expenses typically include, but are not limited
to, rent expenses, utility expenses, salaries for support functions such as human
resources and IT support, general expenses such as advertising, and so on. 
Let's consider a simple example to understand this concept. Assume that an
organization has 400 employees working in its two departments—hardware 
sales and software services. This organization also has an administration support
department. For the sake of simplicity, we'll assume that it uses only two chartfields:
Account and Department. Let's say the chartfield values are as follows:
Account 
Department
Value
Description
Value
Description
900000
Salary expenses
A300
Hardware sales
A400
Software services
A500
Administration
The salary for the administration staff is $100,000 for the year 2011. This would be
posted to the ledger as follows:
Account
Department
Debit
Credit
900000
A500
$100,000
administration salary expense is the pool.
As administration staff salary expense was incurred for the entire organization, it
needs to be allocated to the departments A300 and A400 based on some parameter(s).
We can use any parameter or multiple parameters to decide how this can be done. It
can be divided between the departments simply equally or based on their revenues,
headcount, and so on. Let's say that the headcount of these departments is used as
basis for allocation. Thus, if the number of employees in departments A300 and A400
are 100 and 300 respectively, then $25,000 of the administration salary expenses will
be allocated to A300, while $75,000 will be allocated to department A400.
There are three important terms related to PeopleSoft allocation process that we need
to remember:
Pool: This is the amount that needs to be allocated. In our example, the 
•

Chapter 7
[ 307 ]
Basis: This is the parameter that determines how the pool amount needs to
be allocated. In our example, the department headcount is the basis.
Target: This is the destination to which the pool amount needs to be
allocated. In our example, both departments A300 and A400 are the targets.
Note that there could be different instances of allocation basis. For example, we may
use staff headcount, area (for allocating rent expenses), number of months, and or
others so on. Such non-accounting entities are recorded using what is known as
statistical accounts. These accounts, although similar to regular accounts such as
revenue, expense, and so on, are not used to store financial data. 
Allocation configurations
There are two configurations we need to perform for an allocation process:
Allocation step
Allocation process group
The allocation process for an organization may contain only a single allocation step
or multiple steps for a complex scenario. An allocation process group contains one or
more allocation steps to be followed by the allocation process.
Configuring an allocation step
An allocation step specifies the rules for allocation such as defining the pool, basis,
target, and so on.
Implementation challenge
An organization wishes to allocate its rent expenses, paid by its administration
department, to all other departments. The allocation should be done by floor space
occupied by each of the departments.
Solution
Assume that this organization uses the same department values as shown
previously. It uses account 100000 to record rent expenses and statistical account
350000 to record the floor space of each department.
Thus, the ledger will have following entry for the rent expense:
Account 
Department
Debit
Credit
100000
A500
$100,000
•
•
•
•

PeopleSoft General Ledger Module
[ 308 ]
This will be the pool amount.
The ledger will have following entries for the statistical account (floor space):
Account 
Department
Floor Space (sq. ft.)
350000
A500
5,000
350000
A300
5,000
350000
A400
15,000
Note that statistical account entries do not have debit or credit balances. This will
serve as the basis.
Now, if we distribute the total rent expense in proportion of the floor area, A500 and
A300 should get 1/5 of total rent each, while A400 should be allocated three-fifths of
the rent expense. Thus the accounting entry would be as follows:
Account
Department
Debit
Credit
100000
A500
- $100,000
100000
A500
$20,000
100000
A300
$20,000
100000
A400
$60,000
Here the first line is known as the Offset, while the last three lines are the Target.
Follow this navigation to define an allocation step: 
Allocations | Define and Perform Allocations | Define Allocation Step 
We will discuss only the first five important tabs for this configuration.
The following screenshot shows the Type tab of an allocation step.
Note that the chartfield values used in our illustrative example and those in the
given screenshot may not match.

Chapter 7
[ 309 ]
In this example, we have to allocate the rent (pool) with floor area as the basis. 
Allocation Type: This field decides how the pool amount is allocated. The
available options are Spread Evenly (the pool amount is divided equally
among the target values), Prorata with Record Basis (the pool amount is
divided on the values in the basis amount), Allocate on Fixed Basis (the 
pool amount is divided among target values based on fixed percentage 
values that we specify), Copy (the pool amount is copied to the target 
with or without percentage changes), and Arithmetic Operation (we can
specify a mathematical formula between the pool and basis to derive the
allocation amount). 
Extension Opcode: This field is enabled when we select Arithmetic
Operation as the Allocation Type. It has following values to define the
formula: Add, Subtract, Multiply, and Divide.
The following screenshot shows the Pool tab of the allocation step:
Pool Record Type: This field is used to decide how pool amounts are
specified. The available values are Ledger Group (which indicates that 
the pool amount is stored in chartfields in a ledger group), Fixed Amount
(used if we wish to directly specify an amount to be allocated) and Any
Table (where we can specify a table where the pool amount is stored). 
Note that the last option is used for the Project Costing module.
•
•
•

PeopleSoft General Ledger Module
[ 310 ]
Time Span: This field determines the year and accounting periods for which
the pool amount should be considered. For example, if we wish to allocate
administration salary expenses for the entire year 2011, we need to specify
so. If this field is left blank, the system allocates the pool amount for all fiscal
years and periods. 
When we specify the pool record type as Ledger Group, the system
automatically uses the calendar used by the specified ledger group.
Pool Factor: We can specify what percent of the pool amount needs to
allocated, by using this field. A value less than or greater than 100% can 
be used.
Zero Pool Amount Option: This field is used to decide what should happen
if the pool amount retrieved by the system is zero. Available values are
Calculate This Pool, Select Next Pool, Stop Processing, and Calc No Rows
as Zero.
Pool Fields: This section is used to specify one or more pools. 
Field Name: This field specifies the chartfield parameters for selecting
the records for pool amount. For example, if we wish to allocate the rent
expenses of a particular department, we need to specify two parameters: 
the accounts that hold rent expense amounts and the department that
incurred the expense. 
Once we specify a chartfield, its values are specified using one of the following
methods: Selected Detail Values (where we list each individual chartfield value),
Selected Tree Node (where we specify a tree node and all the values below it), and
Range of Values (where we specify from and to values).
The following screenshot shows the Basis tab of the allocation step.
•
•
•
•
•

Chapter 7
[ 311 ]
Fields in the Basis Record section are again similar to those on the previous tab.
The Basis Fields section specifies the parameters for deriving the basis amounts. In
the previous example, the floor space is used as the basis. Thus, the system needs to
know the area of all the departments to which rent has to be allocated. In other words,
we need to specify two parameters as the basis fields: Account, which is the statistical
account that records the floor area, and the Department(s), whose area needs to  
be retrieved. 
The following screenshot shows the Target tab of the allocation step:

PeopleSoft General Ledger Module
[ 312 ]
The Target tab is used to specify the chartfields and their sources to create the 
target entries.
As we know, the target in our example is a group of departments among which the
rent expense is to be allocated. The Account values came from the Pool, while the
Department values came from the Basis. 
In this tab, we specify all the chartfields to be used for the target (Account and
Department) in the Field Name column. Also, we need to specify where the values
for these chartfields can be derived from in the Source column.
Target Record Type: This field specifies the database table that needs to store the
accounting entries for the Target. Available values are Journal Records (the system
uses the journal table for given ledger group) and Any Table (if we wish to specify a
different table).
The following screenshot shows the Offset tab for the allocation step:
This tab specifies the chartfields and the source for their values to create the 
offset for the pool entry. In our example, both the Account and Department 
values were derived from the Pool, so that is what we specify in the Field Name 
and Source columns.

Configuring an allocation group
An allocation group contains all the allocation steps (one or multiple) that need 
to be executed. 
Follow this navigation to define an allocation group: 
Allocations | Define and Perform Allocations | Define Allocation Group
The page need not be explained, as it is quite straightforward. 
Running the allocation process
The Allocation (FS_ALLC) batch process executes the allocation steps within an
allocation group. It uses the setup options in these allocation step(s) to create the
allocation journals.
Follow this navigation to execute the Allocation process:

The following screenshot shows the run control page for the Allocation process:
Output Options: This field has the following options: 
Create Calc Log - No Output: This option results in creating a log of all
allocation calculations without creating any journals or ledger entries.
PeopleSoft recommends using this option to run the process before
performing the actual allocation.
Create Calc Log and Output: The process creates a calculation log and
generates journals and ledger entries.
No Calc Log - Create Output: The process creates journals and ledger entries,
but no calculation log.

PeopleSoft General Ledger Module
[ 314 ]
Summary
PeopleSoft General Ledger is the central repository of all accounting information
created by accounting transactions. All other modules (such as Billing, AR, AP, and
so on) send their accounting details to the General Ledger in the form of journals.
Journals can be created manually using online pages, imported from non-PeopleSoft
systems as flat files, or uploaded using Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. Journal
Generator is an important batch process used to create journals from accounting
entries from other PeopleSoft modules. Journal Edit and Journal Post are other
important components of journal processing. 
Once journals are posted, they update the account balances in the LEDGER table. 
At the end of an accounting year, the balances of revenue and expense accounts need
to be transferred to the retained earnings account in the balance sheet. This process is
known as Closing. Organizations can perform interim closing (optional) apart from
the year-end closing. PeopleSoft uses the closing rules and the Ledger Close batch
process to perform closing. 
The Allocations process distributes expenses incurred by an entity, such as a
Department, to multiple entities. The Allocation batch process uses the rules set 
up in allocation steps to perform allocations. 
The General Ledger module acts as a source from which various management
reports can be generated. GL account balances are used to create financial statements
such as income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements.

PeopleSoft Expenses Module
In a large organization, the task of tracking and managing expense claims for
employees is quite effort-intensive. The PeopleSoft Expenses module is an important
self-service application used to automate and streamline the employee travel and
expense transactions. The PeopleSoft Expenses system features can be categorized
into four broad areas: cash advances, expense reports, timesheet data, and travel
authorizations. Usually cash advances are given to employees before going on
business travel. Expense reports are used to claim the reimbursement for business
expenses incurred by the employees. Travel authorizations are used to pre-approve
the estimated travel costs. The Expenses module can integrate with an external travel
reservation application to perform travel reservations. Timesheets are used to record
employees' working hours.
In this chapter, we will discuss following topics related to the most commonly used
system features: the processing of cash advances and expense reports. We will 
look at:

Understanding expenses processes
The following schematic describes the high-level processes in the PeopleSoft
Expenses module:
As this module is intended to be used as a tool by the employees in an organization,
it needs to maintain their employee profiles. PeopleSoft offers two different methods
to do this. Employee information stored in the Expenses module includes elements
such as address, bank account information, credit card details, default accounting
information, and so on. We can load all the necessary employee details from the
PeopleSoft Human Resources Management System (HRMS) using a delivered batch
process or we can create the employee profiles manually using the online pages.
The PeopleSoft Expenses module needs to create accounting entries for expense
reports and cash advances. The default chartfield information for creating these
accounting entries comes from the business units, employee profiles, cash advance
sources, and expense types.
The Expenses module provides a flexible approval workflow to route the Expenses
expense transactions through multiple levels of hierarchy. The number of levels of
approval and the roles involved can be configured depending on the organization's
requirements. We can design approval rules by specifying parameters such as which
transactions need to be routed through approval, which users can be approvers,
which transactions can be approved by an approver, and so on. PeopleSoft delivers
various pre-configured roles and transaction types, that can be used as needed,
significantly simplifying the approval rules design.
Cash advances are paid to employees to cover their business travel expenses. An
employee can submit a request for cash advance which, when approved by all
necessary approvers, can result in a payment. On the other hand, an employee can
withdraw cash from an ATM using his/her company credit card and the details

Chapter 8
[ 317 ]
can be automatically loaded into PeopleSoft to create a cash advance transaction. A
cash advance can be then applied to one or more expense reports submitted by that
employee. This is helpful to ensure that an employee is not paid twice.
Expense reports are used to record the business expenses incurred by an employee.
It can record each expense item and its relevant details. If these expenses were paid
with a company credit card, the expense details can be automatically imported on
the expense report, thus saving the data entry effort. Once submitted, the expense
report is routed through the approval hierarchy. As mentioned earlier, a report can
be linked with a cash advance. Once approved, the expense report is ready to be
paid. The payment to the employee can be made through the Accounts Payable pay
cycle or through the PeopleSoft Payroll module.
The Expenses module can create accounting entries for the cash advance and expense
reports before and after the report is paid. These entries can be passed to the General
Ledger module for creating journals.
Understanding cash advance and
expense report configurations
In order to use the cash advance and expense report features, we need to perform
various setups. In this section, we'll familiarize ourselves with some of the most
important configurations.

Per diem ranges
Per diem amounts
Maintaining employee profiles
The PeopleSoft Expenses module is intended to be used by an organization's
employees to create expense reports and get their business expenses reimbursed.
Therefore, it is important that the system maintains detailed information about
all valid employees. We'll quickly look at two different methods of maintaining
employee details in the Expenses module.

Manually updating employee data
This method is recommended when an organization does not use PeopleSoft 
HRMS applications. 
Follow this navigation to maintain employee information: 
Travel & Expenses | Manage Employee Information | Update Profile 
The Employee Data tab is used to record the name and address details of the 
employee and is not shown.
The following screenshot shows the Organization Data tab of the employee profile:
This tab stores some of the most important employee details needed for Expenses
Processing. The GL Unit and Department fields are important to create appropriate
accounting entries for this employee's expense transactions. 
The Supervisor Information section contains important details for routing the
expense transactions for approval.
Details entered in the Default Chartfield Values section are automatically populated
on this employee's expense reports and cash advances. However, they can be
changed on these transactions if needed.

Chapter 8
[ 319 ]
The Cash Advance Level option determines the maximum cash advance amount that
can be given to an employee. The possible options are Business Unit (the same
amount as is specified for Expenses business unit), Specific Amount (which can be
manually specified), or None (meaning this employee is not eligible for any  
cash advances).
The User Defaults tab is used to specify various default values that can be
automatically populated on this employee's expense reports and cash advances. 
This significantly reduces the data entry efforts.
The following screenshot shows the Bank Accounts tab:
This tab records the employee's bank account information used for expense
reimbursement. It is needed primarily for the electronic deposit of the expense
reimbursement amount directly into the employee's account. If an organization
issues checks for expense reimbursement, it may not be needed.
We can add multiple bank accounts for an employee by using the + button. Account
details can be added by clicking the symbol in the Bank Account column.
Hold Payment: If this checkbox is selected, no expense reimbursement can
take place for this employee.
Corporate Card Information: This tab is used to record any official credit,
debit or ATM cards that the employee may be using. Some organizations
issue corporate cards to employees for business expenses and directly
reimburse the amounts to card vendors. In such cases, it is important to link
expense report items to the card vendor payments using the card numbers.
•
•

PeopleSoft Expenses Module
[ 320 ]
Apart from recording basic details such as card number, expiry date, and so on, we
can control the card usage by the employee by specifying various details such as 
a maximum credit limit, a maximum amount that can be spent in a billing cycle, a
maximum amount for a transaction, and so on.
Loading employee data from PeopleSoft HRMS
If an organization is using the PeopleSoft Human Resources Management 
System, it is the primary source for storing employee information. The Expenses
module can simply subscribe to the information from HRMS. This can be done 
using a combination of PeopleSoft-delivered application messages and an interface
batch program.
A group of application messages load the Expenses staging tables with various
details such as an employee's personal information, e-mail addresses, phone
numbers, departments, and so on. A batch process known as Expenses Employee
Update (EX_EE_UPDATE) then loads these details automatically from staging tables
into the Expense module. 
Follow this navigation to execute the Expenses Employee Update batch process:
Travel & Expenses | Manage Employee Information | Load Employee Data
The following screenshot shows the run control page for the process:
There are four different process parameters that can be specified:
1. Load Organizational Data: This option is used to load employee information
such as hire date, business unit, department, supervisor information, and the
amount of cash advance that can be paid. Note that these are the same details
that we manually enter on the Organizational Data tab on the employee
profile page. 

Chapter 8
[ 321 ]
2. Load Employee Bank Data: This option is used to load employee bank
account data. Note that these are the same details that we manually enter on
the Bank Accounts tab on the employee profile page.
3. Validate Organizational Data: As the employee information is coming from
an external source, it is important to validate it before being used. This option
verifies if the departments and business units assigned to employees are
valid and defined in PeopleSoft Expenses.
4. Load Entry Authorizations: Each employee needs to have a user ID to access
and use Expenses module features. This option loads user IDs assigned to 
the employees.
Configuring cash advance sources
A cash advance source essentially determines how the advance amount is paid 
to the employee.
Follow this navigation to setup a cash advance source:
Set Up Financials/Supply Chain | Product Related | Expenses | Management |
Cash Advance Source
The following screenshot shows a sample cash advance source:
Note that we can have two different types of cash advances, depending on whether
a system needs to generate a payment or not. For example, in an organization, an
employee can withdraw an amount from an ATM using his/her corporate credit
card and use it as an advance for a travel expense. In this case, the system doesn't
need to issue a payment, it simply needs to record the fact that cash advance w
wwaaasss
paid through ATM. Another example of this type of cash advance is through
traveller's checks. On the other hand, an organization may issue a check or deposit
the amount directly in an employee's bank account after the cash advance request is
approved. In these cases, the PeopleSoft system needs to create a payment.

PeopleSoft Expenses Module
[ 322 ]
Generate Payment: As discussed previously, if a source, such as checks or
Electronic Fund Transfer, needs to create a payment through the Accounts
Payable or Payroll system, select this checkbox. Unchecking this checkbox
enables the Account field and Accounting Distribution section.
Account, Alternate Account, Accounting Distribution section: These fields
are used to enter chartfield information to be used for those sources that need
not create a system payment.
When a cash advance source generates system payment, its accounting
entry is as follows:
DR 
 
Cash advance account (specified on the accounting
entry template in Accounts Payable) 
CR 
 
Cash account
If a source does not create a payment, the accounting entry is as follows:
DR 
 
Cash advance account (specified on the accounting
entry template in Accounts Payable) 
CR 
 
Chartfields specified on this page (Account field and
Accounting Distribution section)
Click the Reimbursement hyperlink to specify who gets the advance amount. The
new page shows two options: Employee and Vendor. If we select the Vendor option,
additional details such as Vendor ID need to be specified. 
While it's easy to imagine that an employee is paid the cash advance, you may  
be wondering why we need to pay the cash advance amount to a vendor. In a
situation like ATM cash withdrawal, the employee will get a statement from the
credit card company that needs to be paid. If the organization pays that employee's
corporate card dues, the payment will need to be made to the vendor (that is, the
credit card company).
Configuring expense types
This is one of the most important configurations for processing expense reports. 
An expense type provides valid categories of business expenses that can be
reimbursed. It also drives the chartfield details for creating accounting entries. 
A typical organization may have various expense types such as airfare, hotel
expenses, Visa fees, taxi expenses, per diem (daily allowance), and so on. It 
should be noted that actual expense types to be configured entirely depend  
on an organization's requirements.

Set Up Financials/Supply Chain | Product Related | Expenses | Purchase |
Expense Type
The following screenshot shows the sample expense type Airfare:
Benchmark Threshold %: Some organizations use benchmark data for
expenses. We will discuss loading the benchmark data in a later section. This
field instructs the system how much an employee can exceed the expense
benchmark data. Let's consider an example to understand this. We may use
a benchmark that says the average hotel room cost in New York is $400 per
night. If we specify a threshold of 10% in this field, the system will allow
hotel expense claims by employees up to $440 per night. Any amount higher
than this will be flagged for review.
Required Fields: This section specifies various details that must be provided
by the employee while using a particular expense type. In the given example,
when an employee claims airfare expense, the system forces him/her to
provide a text description, the merchant (airline used for the travel) and a
preferred merchant. If these details are not provided, the expense report
cannot be saved.
•
•

PeopleSoft Expenses Module
[ 324 ]
Expense Type Edit: These are additional mandatory information elements
that must be provided by the employee. In the given example, we have
selected the Airfare option, which results in the system forcing the employee
to enter the air ticket number. If we configure an expense type for hotel
expense, select the Hotel option, which will result in the system forcing the
employee to enter number of nights spent at the hotel.
Items with Tax Implications: Certain expense reimbursements, such as club
membership expenses, are treated as taxable income by the tax authorities. If
an expense type is taxable, select this checkbox.
Gross Up Indicator: If the expense amount reimbursed to the employee is
taxable, an organization may decide to pay the tax amount in addition to the
expense amount. For example, an employee is paid an amount of $ 500, taxed
at the rate of 10%. In that case, he/she will receive only $ 450. To avoid this,
the organization may pay the employee the expense amount as well as its tax
amount (USD 550). Select this checkbox to enable this feature. 
The following screenshot shows the Expense Types 2 tab:
•
•

Chapter 8
[ 325 ]
This tab is used to specify accounting information for the expense type. 
Expense Type Group: If desired, we can associate an expense type with an
expense type group, which we would need to configure before the expense
type. This helps in automatically populating some of the information for the
expense type. It is not a mandatory step.
GL Chartfield Setup: This section records the chartfields to be used for
creating accounting entries for this expense type. PeopleSoft offers three
billing types: Billable (this expense was incurred for a project and can be
billed to a client), Internal (this expense was incurred for an organization's
own work) and Nonbillable (this expense was incurred for a project but
cannot be billed to a client). If we wish to record expense accounting entries
for billable and non-billable purposes to different accounts, we can do so.
The following screenshot shows the Expense Types 3 tab:
This tab is used to specify the preferred merchants for an expense type, although the
actual list of preferred merchants is defined on a different page. If an employee uses
a merchant other than these preferred merchants, the system flags that transaction
and forces him/her to provide a reason for non-compliance. In the given example,
we have specified two airlines as preferred merchants for air travel. This is an
important mechanism to enforce organization's expense policies.

Configuring expense location amounts
This is another important expense report configuration. An organization needs to
have some benchmark amounts for various locations depending on average level  
of expenses that are typically incurred. For example, when an employee submits 
a hotel expense with a rate of $400 per night in New York, there should be a
mechanism to decide if this is a reasonable amount. As you can imagine, the average
hotel room rate in New York will certainly be different from one in Houston. At the
same time, these rates may change due to seasonal factors. For example, a hotel room
in Orlando will cost much more during the holiday season compared to other times
of the year.
The parameters that need to be considered to make this decision are location,
expense type, and time of the year.  
Follow this navigation to set up expense location amounts:

The following screenshot shows benchmark data for lodging expenses for 
various locations:
Note that we need to define locations and location
groups before defining the expense location amounts.
Using this page, we can define benchmark amounts for an expense type and 
a currency. We can also specify amounts for various times of the year for a 
particular location.

Configuring per diem ranges
Employees travelling to a different location for business get daily allowances by
organizations. In some cases, the per diem rates have different slabs. Thus, per diem
amounts depend on the location as well as date ranges (number of days of travel).

The given screenshot shows the Active Amounts tab. These rates are used by the
expense reports to calculate the per diem amount depending on the number of days
that an employee stays in a location.
Understanding expenses approvals
For any organization that processes cash advances and expense reports, it is
extremely important that strict financial controls are in place to ensure that
fraudulent expenses are not claimed and paid. This is where the PeopleSoft Expense
module's flexible approval feature comes into picture. PeopleSoft delivers various
pre-configured approval rules and roles as part of the Approval Workflow Engine
(AWE). We can configure various approval and audit rules for expense transactions
by modifying these pre-configured objects.

Chapter 8
[ 329 ]
In this section, we'll discuss some of the important configurations for 
expense approvals:
Approver types
Transaction definitions
Refinement templates
Privilege templates
Approver profiles
Approver assignments
Approver routing lists
Defining approver types
The expenses approval hierarchy in an organization consists of various roles, that
perform different actions. For example, an expense report may go to the accounts
supervisor first, who checks if the accounting chartfields are appropriate for that
expense (that is, is the expense being charged to the correct department?). When it
passes that check, it may be routed to the department manager who will verify the
validity of that particular expense (that is, was this business expense justified?). It
may further be reviewed by an auditor to see if appropriate organization policies are
being followed (that is, has the employee submitted expense receipts, and are there
any violations of preferred merchant policies?).
The following table lists the pre-defined approval roles delivered by PeopleSoft:
Approver type
Description
EXAPPROVER
(Expense approver)
This role can be used by a department manager.
POSTPAYAUD
(Post Pay Auditor)
This role can be used by an auditor who reviews
payments that are already made.
PREPAYAUD 
(Pre Pay Auditor)
This role can be used by an auditor who reviews
payments before they are made.
PROJAPPRVR
(Project approver)
This role can be used by a project manager approving
project-specific expenses. This also needs to be set up in
Project Costing module. 
PROJSUPP 
(Project supplemental
approver)
This role can be used by a conditional approver for 
project-specific expenses.

Approver type
Description
REVIEWER
(Reviewer)
This role can be used by a reviewer to identify the policy
compliance of expenses.
SUPERVISOR
(Supervisor)
This role is used to denote the reporting manager of an
employee. If you are using the PeopleSoft HRMS modules,
the employee-supervisor details are recorded in it.
Note that we need not use all the approver types mentioned here. Also there could
be following scenarios which are quite straightforward:
Scenario 1: An expense approval needs an approval from the reporting
manger only. In this case, we need to use only the SUPERVISOR 
approver type.
Scenario 2: An expense approval needs an approval from the project manger
only. In this case, we need to use only the PROJAPPRVR approver type.
Follow this navigation to create or modify an approver type:

The following screenshot shows a sample approver type:

Approver Category: TTThis field defines the role of an approver type in the
approval process. The available values are EEExxxpppeeennnssseee AAApppppprrrooovvveeerrr,,, PPPooosssttt PPPaaayyy
Audit, Pre Pay Audit, Project Supplemental, Project Manager, Reviewer, and
HR Supervisor. Even if we create a new role, it still needs to be assigned to
one of the previous categories.
Routing Chartfield: This important field determines how the expense
transactions are routed to a given approver type. Assume that we need an
approval role that is responsible for approving expense reports on the basis
of Operating Units (that is, expense reports need to be routed to different
approvers based on the Operating Unit). In this case, we need to select the
Operating Unit chartfield in this field. We'll shortly see how this option
affects further configurations.
Defining transaction definitions
PeopleSoft delivers five transaction definitions that can be processed through the
approval hierarchy: cash advance, expense report, travel authorization, time report,
and time adjustment. We can decide to activate any transaction so that the Approval
Framework Engine can process it. Let's say that an organization uses cash advances
and expense reports. If it decides that all cash advances need to be automatically
approved but the expense reports need to be routed through necessary approvals,
we can simply deactivate the cash advance transaction and activate the expense
report transaction for workflow.
A transaction definition determines which approver types need to approve a
transaction along with the approval actions they can perform.
Follow this navigation to configure a transaction definition:

PeopleSoft Expenses Module
[ 332 ]
The following screenshot shows a sample transaction definition for expense report:
Transaction Unit of Measure: For cash advances, travel authorizations, and
expense reports, the unit of measure is Monetary Amount Based, while for
time reports and time adjustments, it is Hours Based.
Mapping: This tab shows the approver types that must approve this
transaction. 
Active: Select this checkbox for an approver type if that role needs to approve
the transaction. In the previous example, we have configured it in such a way
that all expense reports must be approved by an Expense Approver, Pre Pay
Auditor, and Post Pay Auditor. If we have defined our own approver types,
we can add them by clicking the + button. 
Amount Based: An organization may have a policy that transactions have to
be routed to different approvers depending on its amount. If this checkbox 
is selected, it instructs the system that amount-based routing rules are to be
used. In the given example, we are mandating that Pre Pay Auditor and Post
Pay Auditor approver types will not be covered by amount-based routing.
In other words, all transactions will be routed to them irrespective of their
amounts. We'll see how to configure these rules in a short while.

The following screenshot shows the options on Properties tab for expense report:
This tab shows which actions, such as Approve payment, Approve billing  
(of an expense to the client), and so on, can be performed by a selected approver 
type. Note that rows for only 'Active' approver types are enabled.
The following screenshot shows the Routing Rules tab:
This tab specifies the action to take if the transaction is not acted upon by an
approver within a specified time. 
Duration Days and Duration Hours: These fields specify the maximum time
allowed for a transaction to remain in queue for an approver type. 
Route to Supervisor: If this option is selected, the transaction is routed 
to the reporting manager of the employee after the time threshold. In the
given example, if an Expense Approver (the Department Manager in our
example) does not take any action for five days, the expense report will be
automatically routed to the employee's supervisor.
•
•

PeopleSoft Expenses Module
[ 334 ]
Route to Other Approver: If transactions need to be routed to a specific
person, specify that employee name in this field. For example, if the auditor
does not process the expense report in two days, we can route it to the
manager of the audit group—Darla Sullivan.
As you can see, transaction definitions can offer a lot of flexibility in terms of setting
up the approval rules to suit an organization's needs.
Defining refining templates
In some cases, an organization may not want each transaction to be audited and
approved, since it can result in huge overheads. A refinement template essentially
decides which of the transactions need to be routed through an approval process. 
We can decide to create refinement templates for all or some of the approver types
that we use.
Follow this navigation to configure a refinement template:
Set Up Financials/Supply Chain | Product Related | Expenses | Management |
Approval Setup | Refinement Template
The following screenshot shows part of a refinement template for Pre Pay Auditors:
•

wwsss vvvaaarrriiiooouuusss cccooonnndddiiitttiiiooonnnsss ttthhhaaattt w
wweee cccaaannn ssseeellleeecccttt sssooo ttthhhaaattt
only transactions satisfying any one of these conditions are routed for approval.
In the previous example, we are specifying that expense reports will be selected
for approval only they are not accompanied by valid receipts, or have not used a
preferred merchant, or are related to a project expense. 
The bottom portion of the page contains options to filter transactions on the basis 
of Business Unit, Department, User, Expense Type, or Time Code. Thus, if we wish
to force transactions from specific business units or users through approval, we can
do so.
We can assign this refinement template to any approver type. If we assign the 
given template to the Pre Pay Auditor approver type, only the selected transactions
will be audited.
Defining privilege templates
When an approver accesses a transaction, he/she may or may not need the rights to
review or modify some of the details of that transaction. For example, a Department
manager may find out that a chartfield value on an expense report submitted by an
employee is incorrect. Now, instead of rejecting that report and asking the employee
to resubmit it with the right value, it may be easier if the manager himself modifies
that value and approves it. Whether an approver should have these rights is of
course determined by an organization's policies. A privilege template specifies
various attributes that an approver can view or modify on a transaction.
Follow this navigation to configure a privilege template:
Set Up Financials/Supply Chain | Product Related | Expenses | Management |
Approval Setup | Privilege Template
The following screenshot shows a privilege template:

PeopleSoft Expenses Module
[ 336 ]
As you can see, we can specify the privileges for various attributes (such as chartfield
details, transaction lines, and so on) for a transaction. PeopleSoft offers the following
privilege values (actions that an approver can perform):
View: Approver can only see the attribute on the transaction without the
ability to modify or delete it
Modify: Approver can modify the attribute on the transaction 
Add: Approver can add this attribute on the transaction 
Delete: Approver can delete this attribute from the transaction 
Full: Approver can modify, add, or delete the attribute on the transaction
Hide: This attribute is hidden on the transaction when the approver opens it
Not all the privilege values are available for all attributes. For
example, for the Receipt Required flag, only the Hide and View
options are available.
Similarly to a refinement template, we can assign a privilege template to an 
approver type.
Configuring an approver profile
Each approver in the Expenses system needs to have an approver profile. It
determines the expense transactions that can be processed by an approver as well as
specifying applicable refinement and privilege templates.
Follow this navigation to modify or create an approver profile:
Set Up Financials/Supply Chain | Product Related | Expenses | Management |
Approval Setup | Approver Profile
The following screenshot shows a delivered approver profile for an expense approver:
•

•
•
•
•

Chapter 8
[ 337 ]
In the given example, we have defined a profile for an expense manager, a department
manager who is the first approver for cash advances and expense reports. 
Approver Type: Select the appropriate approver type from the available
options. We have already seen the approver types delivered by PeopleSoft.
Transaction Type: Select the transaction types that we set up as Active. In the
given example, we are assuming that that organization is using approvals for
only cash advances and expense reports.
Refinement Template: Attach a refinement template if we wish to filter the
transactions that are routed to this approver profile. If we need to force all
transactions to be approved, leave this field blank.
Privilege Template: Attach a privilege template to determine the details that
an approver can see and modify.
Risk Template: Attach a risk template in this field. A risk template defines
the financial risk levels for expense transactions. We will not discuss this
configuration, as it is not mandatory. 
To continue with our hypothetical requirement of using Department
Manager, Pre Pay Auditor, and Post Pay Auditor for approvals, we will
need to have three approver profiles. It does not matter what a profile is
named. We can modify existing profiles or create new ones if needed.
•

PeopleSoft Expenses Module
[ 338 ]
Assigning approvers to approver profiles
After all the given configurations are complete, we need to specify the actual
approvers to populate each approver profile. Once a user is assigned to a profile, 
he/she automatically inherits the approval rules that we have configured so far.
If an organization uses approvals by only HR Supervisor or the Project
Manager, it is not necessary to assign these approvers to a profile. The
system can find out the supervisor or project manager for an employee
from the HRMS / Project Costing module and route the transaction
directly to an appropriate approver.
Follow this navigation to assign users to an approver profile:
Set Up Financials/Supply Chain | Product Related | Expenses | Management |
Approval Setup | Approver Assignment
The following screenshot shows the approver assignments for an approver profile:
As you can see, we are specifying three approvers to function as Expense Manager
(Department Managers) depending upon the department value on the submitted
expense transaction. 
Note that the Department From and Department To columns are visible because we
specified Department as the routing chartfield for the EXAPPROVER approver type. 
If we had used a different chartfield there, it would have been reflected here.
In other words, all expense transactions submitted by employees belonging to
department ID 41000 to 43000 will be routed to Al Davis for first-level approval,
while those from employees from department IDs 51000 to 53000 will be sent to
Eugene Dallas.  

Chapter 8
[ 339 ]
Let's say there are only two Pre Pay Auditors in this organization. We can specify the
approver assignment and routing for this role as shown in the following screenshot:
Thus, after Al Davis approves any expense transaction, it will then move to Steven
Sherwood to be audited.
Configuring approver routing lists 
As we briefly mentioned earlier, an organization may have rules that need additional
approvals when expense transactions exceed a certain threshold. In our sample
example, all transactions need an approval from the Department Manager before
they go to an auditor. Let's say that a new policy change makes it mandatory that 
all transactions above $5,000 need to have an additional approval from the General
Manager as well. In this case, this is said to be a supplemental approval. 
We saw that project-related transactions can be approved by the Project Manager. 
If needed, we can have supplemental approval for project expenses as well. 
Approver routing lists are created for one approver type and expense transaction.
Note that amount-based routing rules are needed only if the approver type for
a transaction is set up for amount-based routing. Recall the Mapping tab for the
transaction definition set up.
Let's say we have three levels of amount based approvals: the Department Manager
for amounts up to $5,000, the General Manager for amounts up to $5,000, and the
Vice President for amounts more than $10,000. Thus, depending upon the transaction
amount, it'll move through one, two, or three different approvers. 
Follow this navigation to modify or create an approver routing list:

The following screenshot shows the approver routing list for expense reports and
expense approver role for the given scenario:
Submission Notifications: This field controls how the system notifications are
sent to these approvers: 
Notify First Approver: This option results in the system notifying the
first level approver first. After he/she approves the transaction, the
higher level approvers are sequentially notified. Thus approvals take
place in linear order.
Notify All Approvers: This option results in the system notifying and
routing transactions to all approvers in the list. Any approver can
access and approve the transaction at any time.
Approver Profile: Select the approver profiles in the order of the 
desired routing.
All Values: If this checkbox is selected, the From and To fields for the
chartfield values are disabled and all values are automatically selected 
by the system.
Amount From, Amount To: Specify the amount ranges for each level of
approver profile.
Putting it all together
By this time you may feel a little overwhelmed by the various steps you need to
complete to enable the approval framework. Let's summarize these steps to look at
the complete picture.

Chapter 8
[ 341 ]
Configuration
How it relates to organization's requirements
Approver types
Identify different roles in organization's approval process. Identify
if the organization needs simple approvals by Project Manager or
Supervisor (Reporting manager). Map required roles to delivered
approver types or create new approver types. Typical approval
roles are Expense Approver, Pre Pay Auditor, and so on. Identify
the chartfield (Department, Operating Unit, and so on by which
transactions need to be routed.
Transaction
definitions
Identify the expense transactions that need to be routed through
approval. Activate those transactions. Identify which roles need to
be involved in approval process for that transaction and activate
them. Identify the order in which the transaction needs to be routed
for these roles. Specify any parameters to reroute transactions in case
no action is taken.
Refinement
templates
(Optional)
Find out if all the expense transactions need to be approved. If not,
identify the conditions based on which transactions are selected for
approval.  
Privilege Templates
Decide on the information that approvers can access and/or modify
an expense transaction they need to approve. 
Approver profiles
Identify how many approver levels are needed for an approver
type. For example, Department Manager, General Manager, and
Vice President are the required approver profiles, all belonging to
EXAPPROVER type. Similarly there may be two levels of auditors,
needing two separate profiles belonging to PREPAYAUD type.
Thus, each approver level needs a profile. Assign the privilege and
refinement templates to the approver profile.
Approver
assignments
Decide which employees need to be assigned to an approver profile.
Approver routing
lists
Identify any business policies that dictate additional approvals
based on amounts or hours. Configure the routing lists by specifying
the profiles in the order of increasing amount limits. 
Create routing list for each transaction and approver type.
Interfacing external data with expenses
Now that we have familiarized ourselves with some of the important Expenses
configurations, we'll now move to another important area. The Expenses module is
capable of integrating with various external non-PeopleSoft entities to import  
data using delivered interface batch processes. In this section, we'll discuss  
two of the most widely used integrations: with credit card vendors and benchmark 
data organizations.

PeopleSoft Expenses Module
[ 342 ]
Importing credit card data
As we discussed earlier, organizations can utilize corporate cards to be used by
employees. When the card vendor sends the statement for expense transactions,
PeopleSoft can automatically load them into the Expenses module. Once loaded,
employees can be notified of the pending charges. They can copy these transactions
onto their expense reports. Finally, if so desired, the payment can be directly made to
the card vendor. 
PeopleSoft offers delivered integration with five different credit card vendors:
American Express, Diners Club, MasterCard, US Bank, and Visa. These vendors
provide credit card data in pre-defined formats specified by PeopleSoft, which can 
be readily imported into the Expenses system. 
Follow this navigation to execute the Expense Data Source Load 
(EX_DATA_LOAD) process:
Travel & Expenses | Corporate Credit Cards | Load External Data Sources
The following screenshot shows the run control page for the process;
Data Source: This field specifies the source of credit card data. We can select
one of the five card data sources as discussed previously.
File Name: Specify the file path and file name containing the data that need
to be loaded.
Load External Data: This checkbox must be selected if we wish to load the
data from the input data file specified in File Name field.
•
•
•

Chapter 8
[ 343 ]
Reload Corporate Card Errors: If the process finds any data errors (such as
incorrect card number, invalid expense code, and so on) in the data file, it
loads those error transactions into vendor specific error tables. We can review
them from online pages and make necessary corrections. This checkbox
needs to be selected to load the corrected transactions from the staging area
rather than the new data from input data file. 
Select the Reprocess Corporate Card Errors option alone if you wish 
to reload only the corrected transactions. Select the Load External Data
option alone if you wish to load only the new card data from the input
file. Select both the checkboxes if new transactions as well as corrected
transactions from previous run need to be loaded.
Importing benchmark data
In the configurations section, we discussed setting up of expense location amounts
which determine minimum and maximum expense ranges for different expense
types at different locations. If the number of expense locations is small, maintaining
them manually is not a problem. However, when we need to deal with a large
number of locations, it can become quite a challenge. 
PeopleSoft delivers three pre-configured integrations to automatically load the
benchmark expense data:
Expense data from Runzheimer International
Expense data from U.S. federal government for the continental U.S. (CONUS)
Expense data from U.S. federal government for foreign countries (OCONUS)
Importing benchmark data consists of two steps:
Specify the pre-configured file layout and application message
Execute the inbound file publish processing
Follow this navigation to specify file layout parameters:

We need not change any parameters for the file identifiers. Simply
change the status to Active to use a file identifier.
In order to load data into Expenses module using the pre-defined layout, we need to
execute the EOP_PUBLISHF process.

file identifier shown earlier.
File Identifier: Select the previously activated file identifier in this field and click Run
to execute the process.
This process loads the expense location amount page that we saw in the
configurations section with the appropriate source name in the Data Source column.
Creating cash advances
PeopleSoft Expenses offers a capability where an employee can create a cash
advance request, which can be routed through various levels of hierarchy before it is
approved. Depending on an organization's policy, an approved cash advance may or
may not result in a system-generated payment. Irrespective of payment creation,  
a cash advance must be created and approved to maintain an audit trail. 
Follow this navigation to enter a cash advance request:

The following screenshot shows a sample cash advance:
Business Purpose: This is a mandatory field where we can select a business
purpose (defined on a configuration page) for the cash advance.
Details section: This area is used to enter individual cash advance lines.
Select an appropriate cash advance source in the Source column along with
its description and advance amount. 
Import ATM Advances: This hyperlink is used to automatically populate
the ATM advance amounts withdrawn using the employee's corporate
card. When this hyperlink is clicked, the system opens a new page which
shows the employee's ATM transactions. Note that the integration between
PeopleSoft and the credit card vendor needs to be enabled first to be able to
use this feature.
Click the Submit button to submit it for approval or the Save For Later button to save
it for later modifications. 
Once it is submitted for approval, the system shows a confirmation message as
shown in the following screenshot:
•
•
•

Chapter 8
[ 347 ]
Once a cash advance is successfully submitted, the system generates a cash 
advance ID.
Reconciling cash advances
As we briefly discussed earlier, a cash advance can be applied to an employee's
expense reports. Let's assume that an employee gets a cash advance of $2,000 for 
a business travel. During the business trip, the employee incurs expenses totalling
$1,800. When he/she returns from the trip and submits an expense report, a link
on the expense report page allows the employee to associate the cash advance with
the expense report. In this case, as the employee spent only a part of the advance
amount, he/she needs to return the remaining amount to the organization. On the
other hand, if the expense report amount exceeds the cash advance, the employee
needs to be paid the excess amount. 
The cash advance reconciliation page is used to view the expense reports associated 
with an advance and record any payments from employee for the unused  
advance amount. 
Follow this navigation to perform cash advance reconciliation:
Travel and Expenses | Manage Accounting | Reconcile Cash Advance
Cash advance actions
The following actions can be taken on a cash advance:
Cash advance deletion
A cash advance can be deleted as long it is not active in the approval process (that
is, if it is not submitted for approval or if it has been denied by an approver). Once
it is deleted, it is no longer available on any of the cash advance search pages. No
accounting entries are created for a deletion.

PeopleSoft Expenses Module
[ 348 ]
Follow this navigation to delete a cash advance:
Travel and Expenses | Travel and Expense Center | Cash Advance | Delete
Cash advance closing
Some times, a cash advance may be already approved when we need to cancel it.
This is possible using the Cash Advance Close Feature, as long as it is not being
processed for payment. Closing can be done after accounting entries are created 
for the cash advance.
Follow this navigation to mark a cash advance for closing:
Travel and Expenses | Process Expenses | Close Expenses | Mark Cash Advance 
for Close
After marking a cash advance for close, the Close Liability process needs to be run to
create reverse accounting entries.
Processing expense reports
A typical expense report processing cycle consists of the following steps:
1. The employee creates an expense report to record all the expense
transactions, such as hotel, taxi, airfare, meals, and so on. If any cash
advances were taken, they are associated with the expense report.
2. An expense report is submitted for approval and is routed through as many
approval levels as needed. The approval rules can be configured based on an
organization's policies. If expense report details are found to be satisfactory,
it is approved by one or more relevant approvers.
3. The employee submits the receipts for all valid business expenses.
4. The expense department verifies the receipts and marks the expense 
report accordingly.
5. The expense reports are posted and accounting entries are created to
recognize a liability for future payment due to the employee.
6. Once all the approvals are in place and receipts are verified, the expense
report is staged for payment. The payment can be made through the
Accounts Payable pay cycle or Payroll module.
7. Once the expense report is paid, payments are posted and accounting entries
are created to record the payment and eliminate the earlier liability.

Chapter 8
[ 349 ]
Note that this is a generic process flow and a particular organization may use a
process with different steps. Now let's briefly discuss these processing steps.
Creating an expense report
It is important to create an expense report whether an employee needs to be paid by
the organization or not. It is an important method by which employee expenses can
be closely tracked to see whether they are following the organization's policies. Any
deviations from the policy, such as use of a non-preferred merchant or claims that
exceed prescribed expense limits, are automatically flagged by the system.

The Details section is used to record various expense transactions. For each of the
expense lines in the report, additional details are recorded in subsequent tabs such 
as Detail, Location, and so on.
The Total section shows the summary of expense report.
Depending on the expense type of a line, the details that we need to provide will
differ. For example, while location is a mandatory element for Hotel and Dinner
expense types, it is not relevant for Air Travel. We will not discuss all the tabs here.

Verifying receipts
Organizations mandate that all expense reports be backed up by relevant receipts for
each expense. The expense department verifies the receipts submitted by employees
and marks the report accordingly. 
Follow this navigation to verify receipts for an expense report:

Running the expense processes
The PeopleSoft Expenses module offers a common page to execute all batch processes. 
Follow this navigation to access the Expense Processes page:
Travel and Expenses | Process Expenses | Expense Processing
The following screenshot shows the run control page for the process:
As you can see, this page displays all of the batch processes in Expenses module. The
page also shows the number of transactions (such as expense reports, cash advances,
and payments) that will be processed by a batch process.
Publish to Payroll: This option creates an integration message to publish the
expense data to PeopleSoft Payroll module.
Post Liabilities: This option creates liability accounting entries for expense
reports and cash advances. These accounting entries are stored in the 
EX_ACCTG_LINE table from where they can be picked up by the Journal
Generator process to create journals.
Unpost Expense Report: This option creates reverse accounting entries to
nullify the original liability entries of an already posted expense report.

PeopleSoft Expenses Module
[ 352 ]
A posted expense report must be first marked for unposting before it
can be processed by this option.
Close Liability: We already discussed how to mark a cash advance for
closing. This option creates reversal accounting entries to nullify the liability
entries for selected expense reports and cash advances.
Stage Payments: This option loads the data for approved expense reports 
and cash advances to the staging table to be picked up by the AP pay cycle 
or Payroll module.
Unstage Payments: After a payment has been staged, if we wish to prevent 
it from being processed by AP or Payroll, this option can be used. It removes
the payment data from the staging area.
Cancel Payment: If a payment was created in AP and was subsequently
canceled, this option creates reversal accounting entries for the payment. This
option keeps the data in sync between AP and Expenses.
Post Payments: This option creates accounting entries for payments made in
AP or Payroll for expense reports or cash advances. These accounting entries
are also stored in the EX_ACCTG_LINE table.
Update Paid Statuses: After an expense report or cash advance gets paid, this
process option changes their status to Paid.
Advance Reconciliation: We discussed how cash advances are reconciled.
Once an advance is reconciled, this process updates the expense report data
with the respective cash advance details.
Stage Time to Project Costing: The Expenses module offers a feature by
which we can record timesheets for employees (we have not included this
feature in our discussion). This option moves the timesheet data to a staging
table from where it can be picked up by the Project Costing module.
Publish Elapsed Time: This option creates a message to publish the timesheet
data to the Time and Labor module.
Select one or more business units for which the expense transactions need to be
processed  on the Selected Business Units tab. Click the checkbox next to the desired
process and click the Run button to initiate it.
PeopleSoft recommends that some processes should not be executed
together. Please refer to the PeopleSoft documentation to know the
invalid combinations.

Payment processing
As mentioned in previous sections, payments for the approved expense reports 
and cash advances are handled outside the Expenses module, through the
PeopleSoft Accounts Payable or the PeopleSoft Payroll (part of the Human Resource
Management System) module.
If an organization wishes to use the Accounts Payable module, it is important to
establish the employees as vendors in the PeopleSoft system. Once the expense
reports and cash advances data are staged to the Accounts Payable module, we can
use the Pay Cycle process to create payments for them. Note that we must use the
values EXAD (Employee cash advances) or EXPN (Employee expense reports) for
such Pay Cycle. Recall our discussion from the Specifying payment selection criteria 
– Source / BU tab section in Chapter 6, PeopleSoft Accounts Payable Module. These
payments are then issued to the employees using the selected payment method.
On the other hand, if the approved expense reports and cash advances data 
are staged to the PeopleSoft Payroll module, the employee's payroll amount 
is adjusted accordingly.
Summary
PeopleSoft Expenses is an important module used to automate various employee
transactions such as requesting and issuing cash advances, recording and processing
expense reports for business purposes, recording time sheets, and reserving and
booking travel requests.
We can design a wide range of approval rules using the Approval Workflow
Engine (AWE). PeopleSoft offers various pre-configured options which can be
modified or new configurations can be created as needed. Based on an organization's
requirements, we can configure which expense transactions need to be passed
through an approval hierarchy, define various approval roles, specify chartfields for
routing, and set up approval amount thresholds, among other things.
PeopleSoft Expenses is capable of integrating with external entities to import credit
card transactions for employee expenses and benchmark data to establish expense
reimbursement guidelines.
Cash advances can be requested by employees and, if necessary, payments issued
for them. The Expense report is a flexible tool used to record employees' business
expenses. We can apply cash advances to expense reports to prevent duplicate
payments being issued to employees. Once approved, cash advances and expense
reports details can be staged so that they can be paid through a PeopleSoft Accounts
Payable pay cycle or PeopleSoft Payroll module.


PeopleSoft Commitment
Control
Commitment Control is an optional feature of PeopleSoft used for enforcing budget
control over an organization's spending. It enables an organization to perform what
is known as "encumbrance accounting", or commitment accounting. Using this
feature, organizations can define budgets for various categories of their spending
and track each spending transaction against available budget amounts. Although
commitment control configurations are part of the General Ledger module, it spans
many more modules such as Purchasing, Accounts Payable, Expenses, Billing,
Accounts Receivable, and so on, which are responsible for creating transactions for
spending as well as generating revenue. 
In this chapter, we'll cover the following important topics:
Understanding commitment control
Commitment control configurations
Entering and processing budgets
Handling commitment control exceptions 
Understanding commitment control
Before we proceed further, let's take some time to understand the basic concepts 
of commitment control. 
Commitment control can be used to track expenses against pre-defined control
budgets as well as to track recognized revenue against revenue estimate budgets. In
this chapter, we'll concentrate more on the expense side of commitment control, as it
is more widely used.

Defining control budgets
An organization may draw budgets for different countries in which it operates or
for its various departments. Going further, it may then define budget amounts for
different areas of spending, such as IT hardware, construction of buildings, and so
on. Finally, it will also need to specify the time periods for which the budget applies,
such as a month, a quarter, six months, or a year. 
In other words, a budget needs the following components:
Account, to specify expense areas such as hardware expenses, construction
expense, and so on
One or more chartfields to specify the level of budget such as Operating unit,
Department, Product, and so on
Time period to specify if the budgeted amount applies to a month quarter or
year, and so on
Let's take a simple example to understand how control budgets are defined. An
organization defines budgets for each of its departments. Budgets are defined for
different expense categories, such as the purchase of computers and purchase of
office supplies such as notepads, pens, and so on. It sets up budgets for each month
of the year. 
Assume that following chartfield values are used by the organization:
Department
Description
Account
Description
700
Sales
135000
Hardware expenses
900
Manufacturing
335000
Stationery expenses
Now, the budgets are defined for each period and a combination of chartfields 
as follows:
Period 
Department
Account
Budget amount
January 2012
700
135000
$100,000
January 2012
700
335000
$10,000
January 2012
900
135000
$120,000
January 2012
900
335000
$15,000
February 2012
700
135000
$200,000
February 2012
700
335000
$40,000
February 2012

135000
$150,000
February 2012
900
335000
$30,000
•

Chapter 9
[ 357 ]
Thus, $100,000 has been allocated for hardware purchases for the Sales department
for January 2012. Purchases will be allowed until this budget is exhausted. If a
purchase exceeds the available amount, it will be prevented from taking place.
Tracking expense transactions
Commitment control spending transactions are classified into Pre-encumbrance,
Encumbrance, and Expenditure categories. To understand this, we'll consider 
a simple procurement example. This involves the PeopleSoft Purchasing and
Accounts Payable modules. In an organization, a department manager may decide
that he/she needs three new computers for the newly recruited staff. A purchase
requisition may be created by the manager to request purchase of these computers.
Once it is approved by the appropriate authority, it is passed on to the procurement
group. This group may refer to the procurement policies, inquire with various
vendors about prices, and decide to buy these computers from a particular vendor.
The procurement group then creates a purchase order containing the quantity,
configuration, price, and so on and sends it to the vendor. Once the vendor delivers
the computers, the organization receives the invoice and creates a voucher to process
the vendor payment. As discussed in an earlier chapter, voucher creation takes place
in the Accounts Payable module, while creation of requisition and purchase order
takes place in the Purchasing module. 
In commitment control terms, Pre-encumbrance is the amount that may be spent in
future, but there is no obligation to spend it. In the previous example, the requisition
constitutes the pre-encumbrance amount. Note that the requisition is an internal
document which may or may not get approved, thus there is no obligation to spend
the money to purchase computers.
Encumbrance is the amount for which there is a legal obligation to spend in future.
In the previous example, the purchase order sent to the vendor constitutes the
encumbrance amount, as we have asked the vendor to deliver the goods.
Finally, when a voucher is created, it indicates the Expenditure amount that is
actually being spent. A voucher indicates that we have already received the goods
and, in accounting terms, the expense has been recognized.
To understand how PeopleSoft handles this, think of four different buckets: Budget
amount, Pre-encumbrance amount, Encumbrance amount, and Expenditure amount. 

PeopleSoft Commitment Control
[ 358 ]
Step 1
Budget definition is the first step in commitment control. Let's say that an
organization has budgeted $50,000 for purchase of IT hardware at the beginning 
of the year 2011. At that time, these buckets will show the amounts as follows:
Budget
Pre-encumbrance
Encumbrance
Expenditure
Available budget
amount
$50,000
0
0
0
$50,000
Available budget amount is calculated using the following formula:
Available budget amount = Budget amount – (Pre-encumbrance +
Encumbrance + Expenditure)
Step 2
Now when the requisition for three computers (costing a total of $3,000) is created, 
it is checked against the available budget. It will be approved, as the entire $50,000
budget amount is available. After getting approved, the requisition amount of $3,000
is recorded as pre-encumbrance and the available budget is accordingly reduced.
Thus, the budget amounts are updated as shown next: 
Budget
Pre-encumbrance
Encumbrance
Expenditure
Available
budget amount
$50,000
$3,000
0
0
$47,000
Step 3
A purchase order can be created only after a requisition is successfully budget
checked. When the purchase order i created (again for $3,000), it is once again
checked against the available budget and will pass due to sufficient available 
budget. Thus, once approved, the purchase order amount of $3,000 is recorded  
as encumbrance, while the pre-encumbrance is eliminated. In other words, the 
pre-encumbrance amount is converted into an encumbrance amount, as now there 
is a legal obligation to spend it. A purchase order can be sent to the vendor only after
it is successfully budget checked. Now, the amounts are updated as shown next:
Budget
Pre-encumbrance
Encumbrance
Expenditure
Available budget
amount
$50,000
0
$3,000
0
$47,000

Chapter 9
[ 359 ]
Step 4
When the voucher gets created (for $3,000), it is once again checked against the
available budget and will pass, as the available budget is sufficient. Once approved,
the voucher amount of $3,000 is recorded as expenditure, while the encumbrance 
is eliminated. In other words, the encumbrance amount is converted into actual
expenditure amount. Now, the amounts are updated as shown next:
Budget
Pre-encumbrance
Encumbrance
Expenditure
Available budget
amount
$50,000
0
0
$3,000
$47,000
The process of eliminating the previous encumbrance or pre-encumbrance amount 
is known as liquidation. Thus, whenever a document (purchase order or voucher) 
is budget checked, the amount for the previous document is liquidated.
Thus, a transaction will move successively through these three stages with the
system checking if available budget is sufficient to process it. Whenever the
transaction encounters insufficient budget, it is flagged as an exception. 
So, now the obvious question is how do we implement this in PeopleSoft? To put it
simply, we need the following building blocks at the minimum:
Ledgers to record budget, pre-encumbrance, encumbrance, and 
expenditure amounts 
Batch processes to budget check various transactions
Of course, there are other configurations involved as well. We'll discuss them in the
upcoming section.
Commitment control configurations
In this section, we'll go through the following important configurations needed to
use the commitment control feature:

Enabling commitment control 
Before using the commitment control feature for a PeopleSoft module, it needs 
to be enabled on the Installation Options page.
Follow this navigation to enable or disable commitment control for an 
individual module:
Setup Financials / Supply Chain | Install | Installation Options | Products
The following screenshot shows the Installation Options – Products page:
This page allows a system administrator to activate any installed PeopleSoft modules
as well as to enable commitment control feature for a PeopleSoft module.
The PeopleSoft Products section lists all PeopleSoft modules. Select the checkbox
next to a module that is implemented by the organization.

The Enable Commitment Control section shows the PeopleSoft modules for which
commitment control can be enabled. Select the checkbox next to a module to activate
commitment control and validate transactions in it against defined budgets.
Setting up system-level commitment control
options
After enabling commitment control for desired modules, we need to set up some
processing options at the system level.
Follow this navigation to set up these system level options:
Setup Financials / Supply Chain | Install | Installation Options | Commitment
Control
The following screenshot shows the Installation Options – Commitment 
Control page:
Default Budget Date: This field specifies the default budget date that is
populated on the requisitions, purchase orders and vouchers. The available
options are Accounting Date Default (to use the document accounting date
as the budget date) and Predecessor Doc Date Default (to use the budget
date from the predecessor document). For example, the purchase order
inherits requisition's budget date, and the voucher inherits the purchase
order's budget date.
•

PeopleSoft Commitment Control
[ 362 ]
Reversal Date Option: There are situations when changes are made to an
already budget-checked transaction. Whenever this happens, the document
needs to be budget checked again. This field determines how the changed
transactions are posted. Consider a case where a requisition for $1,000 
is created and successfully budget checked in January. In February, the
requisition has to be increased to $1,200. It will need to be budget checked
again. The available options are Prior Date (this option completely reverses
pre-encumbrance entries for January for $1,000 and creates new entries for
$1,200 in February) and Current Date (this option creates additional entries
for $200 for February, while leaving $1,000 entries for January unchanged).
BP Liquidation Option: We already saw that system liquidates the 
pre-encumbrance and encumbrance amounts while budget checking
purchase orders and vouchers. This field determines the period when the
previous amount is liquidated, if the transactions occur in different periods.
The available options are Current Document Budget period (liquidate 
the amounts in the current period) and Prior Document Budget period
(liquidate the amounts in the period when the source document was created).
Enable Budget Pre-Check: This is a useful option to test the expense
transactions without actually committing the amounts (pre-encumbrance,
encumbrance, and expenditure) in respective ledgers. We may budget 
check a transaction and find that it fails the validation. Rather than budget
checking and then handling the exception, it is much more efficient to simply
do a budget pre-check. The system shows all the potential error messages
which can help us in correcting the transaction data appropriately. Select the
checkbox next to a module to enable this feature.
Defining commitment control ledgers and
ledger groups
We have already discussed concepts of configuring the ledger templates, ledger
groups, and ledgers in Chapter 1, PeopleSoft Financials Fundamentals. These ledgers 
are used to record actual accounting transactions. We also need additional ledgers 
to record commitment control transactions similar to the illustrative example we 
saw previously.
We briefly mentioned that dedicated ledgers are needed to record amounts from
each bucket (that is, Budget, Pre-encumbrance, Encumbrance, and Expenditure).
Thus, in order to use commitment control, we need at least one ledger group
containing four commitment control ledgers. A sample ledger group may be
configured as shown next:
•
•
•

Chapter 9
[ 363 ]
As you can see, the CC_COMB_BD ledger will store the budget amounts, the 
CC_COMB_PR ledger will store any pre-encumbrance amounts, and the CC_COMB_EN
ledger will record encumbrance amounts, while the CC_COMB_EX ledger stores the
expenditure amounts.
Select the ledger value and its purpose in the Ledger and Commitment Control
Ledger Type fields respectively.
We have already discussed the configuration options on the Chartfield and Balancing
tabs in Chapter 1, so we'll not go through them again.
Ensure that the commitment control ledger group contains four ledgers
with the types as shown. The Ledger Group Type field value must be
Commitment Control Expense or Commitment Control Revenue as
the need may be. The Ledger template used must be the one specifically
used for commitment control.
Defining commitment control budget
calendars
Note that calendars are created irrespective of whether an organization uses
commitment control or not. They are mandatory for any PeopleSoft financial system.
However, PeopleSoft uses different pages to build budget calendars. Depending on
how an organization creates its budgets (monthly, bi-monthly, quarterly, and so on,
we need to create appropriate budget calendars. There are various ways in which an
organization may define its budgets. 

PeopleSoft Commitment Control
[ 364 ]
For example, an organization may define its budget of $1,000,000 for IT hardware
procurement for an entire year with no restriction on when this amount should be
spent. Or it may decide to budget $250,000 for each quarter of the year. Thus, in 
the first case, it may spend up to $1,000,000 in the first month of the year itself. On 
the other hand, in the second case, it can spend only up to $250,000 in the three
months of a quarter. 
Follow these navigations to create new budget calendars:

Budget Period Calendar Builder
Set Up Financials/Supply Chain | Common Definitions | Calendars/Schedules |
Summary BP Calendar
The following screenshot shows a sample quarterly budget calendar:
As you can see, we can specify the number of periods in a year, type of calendar
(Month, Bimonth, Quarter, and so on, and Begin Date and End Date for each budget
period. You can probably appreciate the fact that there will be 12 budget periods 
in a year if monthly budgets are defined, four budget periods in a year if quarterly
budgets are defined, and so on.

Chapter 9
[ 365 ]
Configuring tree definitions
Usually when budgets are set up, they are set up at a higher (summarized) level.
For example, when an organization decides to set up budgets on the basis of
departments, it may not establish budgets for each department. Instead, it may set
them up for a group of departments. This will need a hierarchical structure of a
desired chartfield known as Tree. 
Note that Department is just an example how budgets are defined. An
organization may decide to use any other chartfield or a combination of
chartfields to define its budgets.
Follow this navigation to create a tree:
Tree Manager | Tree Manager
The following screenshot shows a sample tree created for grouping Department
chartfield values:

PeopleSoft Commitment Control
[ 366 ]
As you can see, the tree has four levels of Department values. Thus, we can
specify budgets for the Administration, School of Medicine, Sales Admin, and
Manufacturing Support groups of departments. This approach greatly reduces the
manual configuration effort by summarizing the budget amounts at a higher level. 
When we budget check a transaction for department 15000, the system refers to
this tree definition and checks the available budget for its rolled-up value (that is,
Department group 14000) to decide if the transaction should go through or fail.
The creation and maintenance of trees is an exhaustive topic and will not be
discussed due to page constraints of this book.
Configuring control budget definitions
This is one of the most crucial configurations for commitment control which sets up
various processing options for a commitment control ledger group. Before discussing
this configuration, we'll take some time to understand a few concepts.
Ruleset: Budget definitions usually have multiple processing rules for
different scenarios. For example, in our sample budget determined by
Department value, we may have different processing rules for different
groups of departments. For example, budgets for Sales and Manufacturing
departments should be tracked by an additional parameter (Product) which
may not be needed for other groups. Thus, any transaction with Sales and
Manufacturing departments must have the Product chartfield value as
well, while it is optional for other departments. These subsets of processing
rules are known as Rulesets. The chartfield whose value determines which
processing options, or, in other words, which ruleset, should be used is
known as Ruleset Chartfield. In this example, Department will be the
Ruleset chartfield. 
Controlling options: PeopleSoft offers the following options to decide how
the expense transactions should be processed by the budget processor: 
Control: This option validates each transaction amount (such as
requisitions, purchase orders, vouchers, and so on) against budgeted
amounts. If transaction amount exceeds the budgeted amount, it is
flagged as an exception.
Control Initial Document: This option validates only the initial
document against budgeted amounts. If the amount of the initial
document exceeds the budgeted amount, error messages are issued.
If an initial document successfully passes the budget check, all
subsequent documents automatically pass the budget check. Thus, if
a requisition passes budget check, the resulting purchase order and 
•
•
°
°

Chapter 9
[ 367 ]
voucher will pass the budget check even if sufficient budget is not
available at that time.
Track with Budget: This option keeps track of all expense
transactions; however, it does not issue any error messages like the
previous option. All transactions for which a budget exists (even for
a zero amount) are passed. If the transaction amounts exceed the
budgeted amount, only warnings are issued but the transaction can
proceed. Note that the presence of a budget is necessary. 
Track without Budget: This option tracks transactions even if no
budget exists. If a budget exists and the transaction amount exceeds
the budgeted amount, warnings are issued. If no budget exists, no
warning is issued.
If necessary, we can specify that all transactions for some specific departments 
(or any other chartfield) should have an option of 'Control', while transactions 
from other departments should have an option of 'Control Initial Document'.  
A chartfield whose values control how the transactions are processed is known 
as a Controlling Chartfield.

As mentioned previously, we are essentially setting up the processing options for the
CC_COMBO commitment control ledger group in this configuration.
Budget Type: The system automatically displays a value Expense or Revenue,
depending on the Ledger Group Type selected for this ledger group.
Associated Expenditure Budget: If we are configuring a revenue budget, it
can be linked to an expenditure budget in this field.
Tolerance Percent: This field is used to specify a percentage by which
transaction amounts can exceed the budget amounts without triggering an
error message. 
Ruleset CF: This option specifies the ruleset chartfield as discussed earlier. The
value of this chartfield will determine which processing rules are to be used.
Tree Name, Level Name: This specifies the hierarchy tree details for the
ruleset chartfield that we discussed previously.
Control CF: This specifies the control chartfield as discussed earlier. The
value of this chartfield will determine how transactions with specified
chartfield values will be processed.
Commitment Control Options - Control Option: This specifies the
processing option for this budget ledger. The available options are the same
as we discussed previously: Control, Control Initial Document, Track with
Budget, and Track without Budget.
The following screenshot shows the Ruleset Chartfield tab:

Chapter 9
[ 369 ]
This tab is used to define one or more processing rules (rulesets) for different ranges
of values of the Ruleset Chartfield. As we specified Department as the ruleset
chartfield in the previous tab, we can specify various ranges of Department values 
to define different processing options for them. As you can see, we have defined two 
rulesets based on department values. Note that only one ruleset can be designated as 
the default.
In the next tabs, we'll define options to decide how we can process transactions
differently for these two groups.
The following screenshot shows the Keys and Translations tab:

PeopleSoft Commitment Control
[ 370 ]
This is the tab where we can specify various processing options for the different
rulesets. As you can see, the page shows two different sets of options for RULESET1
and RULESET2 that we defined on previous tab. Note that all of the options discussed
next can be set up differently for different rulesets. 
Enable Cumulative Budgeting: Let's say we use a budget calendar with 12
periods, one corresponding to each month. Thus we define budget amounts
for each period. Normally a transaction will be checked against budget
amount defined for the month in which it was created. However, PeopleSoft
offers an option to use cumulative periods using cumulative calendars to
determine budget amounts. Thus, if each month's budget amount is $1,000,
and we enable cumulative budgeting with a quarterly calendar, transactions
will be checked against the cumulative budget of $3,000 (for three months).
As a result, irrespective of the monthly budget amount, a transaction is
validated against the available budget for a quarter and not an individual
month. This is known as cumulative budgeting. Select this checkbox to use
this feature.   
Cumulative Calendar: Specify a cumulative calendar if cumulative
budgeting is used. This is a calendar with period larger than the regular
calendar. For example, if regular budget calendar is monthly, we can 
use quarterly, semi-annual, or any other calendar with period larger 
than a month.
Calendar ID: Specify the regular budget period calendar that we 
discussed earlier.
Keys and Translation: This section lists the chartfield keys that are needed
to track budget amounts. Thus, if we need to track Sales and Manufacturing
department transactions by product, add the Product chartfield as the
additional key to the appropriate ruleset. If a budget is defined at a higher
level for a chartfield, specify the details in Tree Name and Level Name fields.
The following screenshot shows a part of the Control Chartfield tab:

Chapter 9
[ 371 ]
Earlier, we discussed how budget control options work. In the first tab, Department
was specified as the control chartfield. Thus, this tab allows various ranges of
Department values to be defined and corresponding control options specified.  
As shown in the given screenshot, we can specify different control options for
different ranges of the Department value.
We'll not discuss the remaining tabs (Offsets and Excluded Account Types) in detail
but quickly get an overview of their purpose. 
The Offsets tab is used to specify the offset accounts for budget entry. Budget
amount entry is done through online budget journals, which we'll see in a short
while. This tab also records the offset account to be used for each source transaction
that is budget checked. 
The Excluded Account Types tab is used to specify which account types or specific
account values should be excluded from budget check. Recall that PeopleSoft
delivers the account types Assets, Liabilities, Equity, Revenue, and Expense.  
If we are using commitment control for tracking expense transactions, we can 
specify Assets, Liabilities, Equity, and Revenue account types for exclusion. If
required, we can also specify individual account values that need to be excluded 
from budget checking.

Linking the commitment control ledger group with actual
ledger group
So far, we have discussed various configuration options to ensure that all things 
are in place to record the budget amounts and track expense transactions against
them. You may recall from Chapter 1 that we define various ledger groups for a
business unit to track the actual accounting transactions. Now we need to establish
a link between the ledger group that records the actual transactions and the ledger
group that is used to track commitment control balances (budget, pre-encumbrance,
encumbrance, and expenditure). 
This is done on the 'Ledgers For A Unit' page.
Follow this navigation to access the page:
Setup Financials / Supply Chain | Business Unit Related | General Ledger |
Ledgers For A Unit
This page shows all the ledger groups used by a business unit. Open the
Commitment Control Options tab.
The following screenshot shows a ledger group RECORDING used to record actual
accounting transactions:
Enable Commitment Control: Select this checkbox to indicate that the 
actual transactions recorded in this ledger group need to be tracked 
against defined budgets.
Ledger Group: Select a commitment control ledger group against which
the transactions need to be checked. Note that we can select multiple
commitment control ledger groups here. This is relevant when an
organization is using expense as well as revenue budgets or if budgets are
defined for different levels.

Commitment Detail Ledger: We saw earlier that budgets are usually set
up at a higher (summarized) level by default. Therefore, when the budget
processor validates the transactions, pre-encumbrance and encumbrance
entries are recorded at the summarized level. If we wish to record these
entries at a detailed level with actual chartfield values, we need to use a
separate commitment control ledger group. Select this checkbox to indicate
that a ledger group will track detail commitment control activities. In the
given screenshot, the CC_COMBO ledger group tracks pre-encumbrance and
encumbrance balances at a summarized level, while the CC_COMBO2 ledger
group tracks them at a detailed level.
Let's consider our earlier example of Department tree to understand this. We
mentioned that departmental budgets will be set up at the higher level, that is, for
the following department values:
Department 
Budget amount
90200 (School of medicine) 
$1,000,000
14000 (Administration)
$1,500,000
20000 (Sales)
$2,000,000
42000 (Manufacturing)
$2,500,000
In the department tree, department 14000 contains various detail (child) department
values such as 15000 (Business Services), 10500 (Benefits), and so on.
Now, when a requisition for department 15000 is created and budget checked, the
pre-encumbrance ledger will record a balance for department 14000 (summarized or
parent value) and not the department 15000 (detail or 'real' department value). When
the purchase order is created from this requisition, again the encumbrance ledger will
record the balance for department 14000 (summarized value). We can use a different
ledger group to track detail department values by selecting its Commitment Detail
Ledger flag. The Pre-Encumbrance and Encumbrance ledgers in this group will record
balances for department 15000 for which the actual transactions are created. 
Using commitment detail ledgers is optional. Organizations may
decide to use it for better reporting. If tracking pre-encumbrance and
encumbrance balances at a summarized level is sufficient, this feature is
not required. Whether we use commitment detail ledgers or not, actual
transactions are still recorded at detail level in the actual ledgers.

Defining commitment control transactions
During our discussion so far, we have already seen that a requisition, purchase
order, or voucher are examples of commitment control transactions that get
validated against budgets. PeopleSoft delivers a group of transactions which are
recognized by the budget processor.

It is very rare that we would need to change the delivered definitions
of commitment control transactions. For most of the requirements, the
source transactions can be used as delivered.
Entering and processing budgets
Now that we have familiarized ourselves with the necessary configurations to use
commitment control, we'll now move on to the next stage. In this section, we'll
discuss how we can create, transfer, and process budgets. 
Entering budget journals
We already saw that the budget ledger in the commitment control ledger group
stores the budget amounts. These budget amounts are entered using budget journals.
In Chapter 7, PeopleSoft General Ledger Module, we saw how to create journals and post
them to the ledger. The process to enter and post budget journals to commitment
control ledgers is more or less similar.

PeopleSoft Commitment Control
[ 376 ]
Follow this navigation to enter a budget journal:
Commitment Control | Budget Journals | Enter Budget Journals | Budget Header
The following screenshot shows the Budget Header tab of the budget journal:
Ledger Group: Select the commitment control ledger group that should
record the budget amounts. Recall that we specified the CC_COMBO ledger
group to business unit US001. When this journal is posted, the budget
amount is posted to the ledger designated as 'Budget' in the CC_COMBO 
ledger group.
Budget Entry Type: This field has two possible options: Original, if this 
is a new budget entry, and Adjustment, if this is an adjustment to an 
existing budget.
Note that the journal ID shows as NEXT. When journal is saved, the system
automatically generates a journal ID.
The following screenshot shows the Budget Lines tab of the budget journal:
•
•

Chapter 9
[ 377 ]
This is the tab where we enter the planned budget amounts. Note that the options
we specified for the control budget definition (such as chartfields, calendar, and 
so on) determine the options on this page. In this example, we have specified the
budget amounts for the groups of departments as shown in the table on page 18 for
the year 2012. The reason we see only one budget row for 2012 is that the calendar
we selected for the CC_COMBO budget has only a single period (corresponding to the
whole year). If we had wanted to specify monthly budgets, we could have used an
appropriate calendar on budget definition and entered monthly budget amounts for
each department on this page.
Budget Header Status: This field shows the status of the budget journal. The
following table shows various status values that a budget journal can have:
Status
Description
N
None: The journal has been created and no processing has taken place
S
Security Error: The journal has encountered an error due to violation of
security rules
B
Balancing Error: The journal has encountered an error as it is not balanced
E
Error: The chartfield combination is invalid
P
Posted: The journal has been successfully posted
U
Unposted: The journal has been posted and then subsequently unposted
Totals: The section at the bottom of the page shows the summary of the
budget journal. Currently it has a credit total of $7,000,000. The balancing
debit line for this journal will be created using the offset account for the
budget entry that we specify on the Offsets tab of control budget definition.

in the top right corner of the page is used to specify the
processing options for this budget journal. The available options are Delete
Journal, Copy Journal, Refresh Journal, Edit Chartfields (which checks if
the chartfield combinations on this journal are valid), Budget Pre-Check
(which performs the budget checking without posting the amounts to the
ledger), and Post Journals (which edits the journal and, if valid, posts to the
ledgers in the specified ledger group). Select the appropriate option and click
the Process button to take that action.
Budget Errors: This tab displays any error messages related to security,
balancing, and so on for this journal.
Transferring budgets
Organizations may face situations where amounts need to be transferred from one
budget to another. Consider a scenario where a reorganization results in the merging
of two departments to create a new department. In this case, as the old departments
don't exist any more, their available budget amounts must be moved to the 
newly-formed department.
The PeopleSoft pages used to perform budget transfers are exactly the same as those
used for budget entry with very minor differences. 
Follow this navigation to enter a budget transfer journal:
Commitment Control | Budget Journals | Enter Budget Transfer
On the Budget Header tab, the Budget Entry Type field shows the options Transfer
Original (if this journal is to transfer an original budget amount) and Transfer
Adjustment (if this journal is a transfer of an adjustment made to an original 
budget amount).
The remaining pages are similar to what we have discussed previously.
Performing budget checking for transactions
In our illustrative example, we saw that transactions such as purchase requisitions,
purchase orders, vouchers, and so on are processed to check if a sufficient budget
amount is available. Depending on the result and the processing option specified,
the system passes a transaction, flags it with an error, or ignores it by simply
generating a warning message. 
•

•

Chapter 9
[ 379 ]
PeopleSoft offers a batch process called Commitment Control Budget Processor
(FS_BP) to perform these functions. As we discussed earlier, there are various 
source transactions from different modules that can be budget checked by the
Budget Processor. 
Each module enabled for commitment control provides the ability to budget check
its transactions. For example, the Expenses module gives an option to budget check
expense reports, while the Accounts Payable module offers an option to budget
check vouchers. 
The budget processor also liquidates any previous pre-encumbrance or encumbrance
balances for the transaction that it processes and successfully validates.
Handling commitment control exceptions
In this section, we will discuss the common solutions for resolving the transactions
that are flagged as exceptions by the Budget Processor.
Typically when a transaction fails budget check, there are two ways to resolve it:
adjust (reduce) the transaction amount or adjust (increase) the budget amount. 
Option 1: Adjusting the transaction
Scenario
Resolution
There is not a sufficient budget amount
available for the transaction.
Reduce the transaction amount sufficiently
so that it can pass the budget check.
There is not a sufficient budget amount
available for a given combination of
chartfields. Assume that budgets are set
up for different Department and Product
combinations.
Change the chartfields and perform 
a budget check. For example, we can
purchase a computer for a different
Department which has a sufficient budget
amount.
There is not a sufficient budget amount
available for a budget period. Assume that
an organization has monthly budgets.
Cancel the transaction, recreate it in the
next period and perform a budget check.

PeopleSoft Commitment Control
[ 380 ]
Option 2: Adjusting the budget
Scenario
Resolution
There is not sufficient budget amount
available for the transaction.
Increase the budget amount sufficiently so that
the transaction can pass the budget check.
Increase the budget tolerance limits so that the
transaction can pass the budget check.
Transaction failed because the budget
was closed.
Reopen the budget and perform the budget
check.
Option 3: Overriding the budget exceptions
This option should be evaluated carefully before giving the users the option to
override the budget exceptions. If it is granted, certain authorized users can override
the error messages and force a transaction to pass. 
Summary
Commitment control is a useful optional feature used by organizations to enforce
budget controls. PeopleSoft offers the ability to define budgets and track transactions
against these budgets. Budgets can be defined for both expense and revenue
amounts. Dedicated commitment control ledgers are used to track the various types
of commitment control transactions. 
Budget, Pre-encumbrance, Encumbrance, and Expenditure ledgers are required 
in a commitment control ledger group. Commitment control budget definition
determines the processing options for a ledger group. Rulesets specify processing
rules for various groups of designated chartfields. A commitment control ledger
group is linked to an actual ledger group for a business unit so that an association 
is made between the actual transactions and their corresponding budgets. 
Budget amounts for necessary chartfield combinations are entered using budget
journals. These journals are then posted to the appropriate commitment control
ledger group. The budget processor batch process is used to validate transactions
from various modules against defined budgets. 
Based on user preferences, a user can be given the ability to override commitment
control exceptions. Otherwise, the system prevents these transactions from
proceeding. Organizations can decide whether to use this feature or not. If it is used,
it can be enabled for select modules.
