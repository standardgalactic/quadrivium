About the Authors
Michele Tagliati, MD, is a movement disorders specialist with extensive
experience in the diagnosis and treatment of Parkinson’s disease. As Director
of the Parkinson’s Disease Center at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York,
he follows hundreds of patients at several stages of disease progression. He
dedicates his professional life to caring for PD patients and developing
research protocols that will ultimately improve their condition. In particular,
Dr. Tagliati is a leader in the field of deep brain stimulation for PD and dysto-
nia. He currently serves as teaching faculty at the annual courses given on
DBS programming at the American Academy of Neurology and the
International Movement Disorders Society. He has published over 40 peer-
reviewed articles and 20 book chapters. A medical graduate and neurologist
specialist from the University of Rome in Italy, he moved to New York in 1991
with a PD research scholarship. After completing a second neurology resi-
dency at Mount Sinai Medical Center, Dr. Tagliati served as a faculty member
at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and then moved back to Mount Sinai to
become Division Chief of Movement Disorders. He is currently Associate
Professor of Neurology at Mount Sinai School of Medicine and a diplomate of
the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology.
Gary N. Guten, MD, MA, is qualified to contribute to this book for three rea-
sons: He’s a sports medicine orthopedic surgeon, author, and Parkinson’s
patient. As an orthopedic surgeon, he specializes in sports medicine, exer-
cise, and nutrition. He was the founder of Sports Medicine and Orthopedic
Center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The center now has eight doctors. As an
author, he has published six books on sports medicine and 27 medical jour-
nal publications — 14 are on the Web site of the National Library of Medicine
accessible at www.pubmed.com. As a Parkinson’s patient, his insight and
understanding of Parkinson’s disease comes from the fact that he developed
PD in 1995. He had to stop doing surgery — but continues to actively do
office practice and consultations. Gary received his medical degree from the
University of Wisconsin, and as a lifelong learner received a Master of Arts
degree in 2005 in Bioethics from the Medical College of Wisconsin. His
master’s thesis subject was Placebo Surgery with a critical analysis of stem
cell surgery for PD.

Jo Horne, MA. Many factors came together to lead Jo to this project. After
receiving her master’s degree in communications from the University of
Cincinnati, she spent the early years of her career as a college lecturer. Later
as she began an eight-year journey as the long-distance caregiver for her par-
ents, she became aware of the need for a comprehensive guide for caregivers.
Over the next several years she wrote three such guides, all published by
AARP. At the same time, she left teaching to work with her husband as he and
others pioneered the concept of adult day care in the state of Wisconsin. She
was also a fellow of the Midwest Geriatric Education Center’s initial class and
was tapped to deliver the keynote address at the national meeting of the
Association of University Professionals in Health Administration for her work
in developing curriculum on professional/patient interactions in long-term
care. Her work as a communications manager in the dual corporate worlds of
long-term care insurance and later the pharmaceutical industry further pre-
pared her to research and write on the effects of Parkinson’s on patients and
their care partners. Finally when her sister was diagnosed with PD, Jo found
herself up close and personal with the impact PD can have. Her unique com-
bination of personal and professional experience has made her a popular
speaker and workshop leader as well as a guest expert for national television
and radio talk shows.

Dedication
Michele Tagliati, MD — In memory of my father, Silvano Tagliati, who suf-
fered with great dignity from Parkinson’s disease, and my beloved wife, Tracy,
who greatly inspired my life as a man and a doctor.
Gary N. Guten, MD, MA — This book is dedicated to the lasting memory of
my neurologist, Dr. Steven Park, who died in 2006 from a tragic accident. Not
only was he a Parkinson’s disease maven, but he was my medical mentor,
respected colleague, and golfing buddy.
Jo Horne, MA — Every book is for Larry, whose belief in me has never
wavered. This one is also especially for Patsy Horne DeBord — my sister and
friend — whose fight with PD brought our family closer in spite of the years
and miles separating us. It is also for my siblings, Betsy and Earle, and in-
laws, Tom and Carole, who took on the demanding role of care partner for
Patsy without hesitation and — learning on the job — performed it with love.
Authors’ Acknowledgments
Michele Tagliati, MD — I would like to thank Jo, whose enlightened spirit
envisioned and inspired this book, and all my patients, who teach me a great
deal about their disease every day. In addition, I would like to thank the
Department of Neurology at Mount Sinai Medical Center and the Bachmann-
Strauss Dystonia & Parkinson Foundation for their continuous support.
Gary N. Guten, MD, MA — One person stands out as being responsible for my
insight, knowledge, and fight against Parkinson’s disease. That person is my
piano teacher — Rita Shur. She has taught me to play the piano (or write) —
not with my fingers — but with my heart and my head.
Jo Horne, MA — Without the unique expertise and indefatigable dedication
of Michele and Gary, this project would still be on the drawing board. I am
indebted to both of them for their insights and humor as we made this jour-
ney. I am also deeply indebted to my agent Natasha Kern and everyone on
the project team at Wiley Publishing. But as Willie Loman said in the Arthur
Miller play Death of a Salesman, “Attention must (also) be paid” to the
dozens of PWP, their care partners, and healthcare professionals who con-
tributed to the work just by showing me what it means to live with PD. Finally
I am profoundly indebted to those fearless and tireless warriors at the foun-
dations and organizations who daily wage the battle to find a cure. My deep-
est wish is that they make this book obsolete in a very short time.

Foreword
A
diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease is a life-altering event. There is no one
way to deal with it. Everyone has a unique set of circumstances, and
every patient experiences Parkinson’s differently. That’s why one book on PD
can never be all things to all people. Whether you are living with the disease
or are a caregiver or friend to someone who is, you will come to rely on a
wide variety of high-quality books, manuals, Web sites, resources and tools.
You may be surprised by the voracity of your appetite for newer, better, and
just plain more information about PD. And since Parkinson’s is — for now, at
least — a disease that stays with you for life, your information needs may
evolve and change over time.
This book represents something incredibly important: a place to start. We
commend its emphasis on tenets that we at The Michael J. Fox Foundation
strive to incorporate into our work: an action orientation, a problem-solving
mentality, and the distillation of a great deal of complicated information into
clear, logical next steps.
Most importantly, the Foundation shares with the authors of this book a com-
mitment to keep patients front and center in every decision we make. As the
largest funder of Parkinson’s research outside the federal government, we
actively partner with scientists to innovate new funding mechanisms that can
maximize the quality, quantity and pace of PD research. With a comprehen-
sive view of the field and proactive management of the grants in our portfo-
lio, we are ideally positioned to bridge the gap between basic research and
the clinic. For years scientists have asserted that with sufficient research
funding, a cure for Parkinson’s is within reach. We are working urgently to
prove them right.
I am continually inspired by the patients I meet who are endeavoring to live
their lives beyond the potentially limiting effects of this disease, defining
themselves by their achievements, not their struggle with PD. But no one
who knows Parkinson’s would suggest that a positive outlook is achievable
all the time. Do everything you can to put the odds on your side: Find doc-
tors you trust and can build relationships with; eat well and exercise as much
as possible; appreciate and invest in your family and friendships; investigate
ways to reduce stress and practice what works for you.
And know that work is continuing aggressively to make this disease, finally, a
thing of the past.
Debi Brooks
President and CEO, The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research

Introduction
I
f the very idea of a Parkinson’s disease diagnosis scares the bejeebers out of
you, take a deep breath and pay attention. Although Parkinson’s is a chronic
and progressive condition with no cure (yet), the strides made in just the last
decade to control and manage symptoms are impressive and hopeful. Also the
number of national organizations (not to mention big-name celebrities) that are
placing the spotlight squarely on the need for a cure is unparalleled.
And we’re here to help: An experienced neurologist and lecturer on the treat-
ment of Parkinson’s disease (PD); another physician — not a neurologist but
rather one who has been living with his own PD (and finding new and innova-
tive ways to maintain control over his life) for over a decade; and a writer of
books on aging and giving care whose oldest sister has PD. Together we give
you the facts you need, resources you can rely on, and tips on how best to
structure your life so that — to paraphrase the popular slogan — you have
PD, but it doesn’t have you.
This book is your guide to understanding and living with PD. While you — the
person with Parkinson’s (PWP) are the primary audience — feel free to share
Parkinson’s Disease For Dummies with family, friends, and especially that
person who will most likely make this journey with you — your care partner.
We — the doctor-athlete who’s fought PD for over ten years, the writer who’s
seen dozens of people triumph over their PD, and the neurologist who’s not
in the business of giving up — wish you the strength to persevere, the will to
keep fighting for a cure, and the physical and emotional stamina for a long,
productive life.
About This Book
At first glance the idea of a For Dummies guide to Parkinson’s disease may
seem ludicrous or even downright insulting. But those of you who have used
these guides understand that the dummies reference indicates a guide that
presents its topic in simple, straightforward terms. Although PD doesn’t have
a cure, it can be well managed for years before a person faces its more chal-
lenging aspects. And that’s what this guide is about — practical ways you can
control and manage the symptoms of your Parkinson’s so you can get on with
your life!

Now, this is not some sugar-coated Pollyanna guide to living with PD. It’s a
realistic look at what you’re facing. It provides solid information and resources
to help you and your family come to terms with PD as a factor in all your lives.
It offers proven techniques and tips to help you prepare for the future without
projecting the worst. And most of all, it reminds you that living a full and satis-
fying life — in spite of PD — is definitely possible, even probable.
We designed each chapter of Parkinson’s Disease For Dummies to be self-
contained so that you don’t have to read the book sequentially or read the
first parts to understand any later chapters. You can dip in and out wherever
you please and concentrate only on what you need. The table of contents and
the index can help guide your search.
Conventions Used in This Book
The following conventions are used throughout the text to make the info con-
sistent and easy to understand:
 All Web addresses appear in mono font.
 New terms appear in italic and are closely followed by an easy-to-understand
definition. We also clearly define the terms in the handy glossary at the
back of the book.
 Bold is used to highlight the action parts of numbered steps.
 This book has several sidebars (shaded in gray). These aren’t essential
to your understanding of PD or your use of this guide, but we hope
you’ll find them interesting and, in some cases, even inspiring.
This guide has a few special conventions that are widely accepted by
Parkinson’s researchers and advocates as well as by people with PD and their
families:
 Parkinson’s disease is often abbreviated PD.
 A person diagnosed and living with PD is often referred to as PWP, or
person (or persons) with Parkinson’s.
 Because PWP are fully capable of making decisions and planning their
care for many years following diagnosis, we refer to their primary care-
givers as care partners. There may come a day when you need more
hands-on care and assistance. Should that day come, that’s when your
care partner takes on the additional role of caregiver.
2
Parkinson’s Disease For Dummies 

 Although we hope your family and close friends will read many portions
of this guide, some sections are do-not-miss for these folks. Several
chapters have a section titled “A Word for the PD Care Partner” at the
end. Be sure to share these sections with the person (or persons) most
likely to be your support and eventual caregiver.
Foolish Assumptions
In putting together this guide to living with PD, the three of us have assumed
the following about you:
 That you have (or suspect you have) PD yourself or are close to some-
one who does.
 That you want reliable information about PD, and you’re looking for
proven ways (techniques and resources) to treat and manage its 
symptoms.
 That you intend to take a proactive role in facing this challenge and not
simply (blindly!) do everything the first healthcare provider you see tells
you to do.
 That you’re open to lifestyle adjustments and complementary or alterna-
tive techniques that are proven to manage symptoms and prolong 
functions.
 That you realize PD is not just a physical condition that affects only you;
it has elements that impact you — and everyone who cares about you —
physically, mentally, and emotionally. You all need to be proactive in
preparing for and meeting those challenges head-on.
How This Book Is Organized
All For Dummies books are divided into parts and chapters. The goal is for
you to easily move from one part or chapter to another without having to
read a gazillion pages of information that aren’t essential at the moment.
Clever, right? The following sections describe each part.
3
Introduction

Part I: Understanding PD
The chapters in this part explain what PD is and isn’t. Chapter 1 gives an
overview: statistics and background information plus the differences
between primary PD and other conditions that can look like it. Chapter 2 gets
into the potential causes — genetic and environmental — that researchers
study to find new treatments and even a cure. You also find out who’s at risk
for getting PD. In Chapter 3 we take a closer look at the four major symptoms
and signs that distinguish Parkinson’s from related conditions. The chapter
concludes with the stages of the disease and why these stages have no clear
markers.
Part II: Making PD Part — 
But Not All — of Your Life
These chapters walk you through those initial steps following your suspi-
cions of PD. We begin with guidance on getting an accurate diagnosis, finding
a specialist, and understanding the tests and techniques that confirm your
diagnosis. We explain how to connect with other health experts — therapists,
counselors, and such — who will play a vital role in managing your PD. In
addition, you need to focus on sharing the news with people around you.
Chapter 7 gives you tips on how, when, and who to tell. The final chapter in
this part addresses the special needs of people with young onset PD (before
age 50).
Part III: Crafting a Treatment Plan 
Just for You
This is your guide to the current options for treating PD and managing symp-
toms over the long term. We look at prescription medicines, the possibility of
surgery, and proven complementary or alternative therapies that are viable
assets. The largest chapter is on diet and exercise, and that’s intentional. We
include a program of exercises specifically designed to enhance flexibility
and build muscle strength. We also insist that you show this program to your
physician and physical therapist before trying it on your own! Because PD is
a neurological condition (affecting the brain), we include a separate chapter
on depression and anxiety, which can be treatable symptoms of the condition
itself. Wrapping up this part is a chapter on clinical trials. We discuss how to
find such trials as well as the pros and cons of being a participant.

Parkinson’s Disease For Dummies 

Part IV: Living Well with PD
Because living with PD for many years — even decades — is not only possi-
ble but also likely, this part discusses special areas of your life (people, work,
and independence) that may need fine-tuning. We explain how people often
react differently to a person who now has a chronic and progressive condi-
tion and how it’s up to you to maintain normalcy with your family, friends,
and co-workers. We also address PD and the workplace: the issues you face
when you can work as well as the options you have when you can’t work.
Finally we cover ways to maintain independence and control over your life
despite changes in your mobility and mental prowess.
Part V: Coping with Advanced PD
As with any progressive condition, you’ll eventually delegate responsibilities
and rely on other people to keep you mobile, mentally alert, and emotionally
upbeat. This part of the book is as important for your primary care partner
as it is for you, so both of you need to read it. We cover important decisions
and planning processes that you should address early on, and we discuss the
onset of later-stage symptoms that can be incapacitating. We also address the
gradual shift of your partner’s role from care partner to caregiver, based on
ground rules the two of you make. Early discussions on housing, finances,
and legal issues are also covered in this part.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
Every For Dummies book includes a section of lists, that is, key information
that readers can use right away. In Parkinson’s Disease For Dummies, those
lists include ten ways to manage difficult feelings (anger, guilt, sadness, and
such), ten ways you (the PWP) can care for your care partner, and — possi-
bly the most important list — ten ways you and your care partner can
become active in the fight for a cure.
Part VII: Appendixes
Appendix A contains a glossary of Parkinson’s-related terms to use as refer-
ence. Appendix B summarizes the many PD resources we mention through-
out this guide: organizations, care partner resources, support groups, and
assistive devices for making life with PD easier.

Introduction

Icons Used in This Book
To make this book easier to read and simpler to use, we include icons that
help you find (and fathom) key information. Here’s what they look like and
highlight:
This icon flags essential information that cautions and protects you against
potential pitfalls and problems. Do not skip over these paragraphs.
This icon signals essential information that’s important enough to bear
repeating. It’s information you should keep in mind.
This icon identifies information that may save you time, offer a resource, or
show you an easier way of doing some task or activity.
Where to Go from Here
Where you open this book — Chapter 1, Chapter 18, or somewhere in
between — depends on where you are in your journey through Parkinson’s. If
you suspect PD is the cause behind some troubling symptoms, you may want
to start with Chapter 4 for tips on the best way to get an accurate diagnosis.
If you’ve already been diagnosed, then Part III, where we discuss treatment
options, may be your first stop.
The point is that this is a guide, a roadmap to help you on the path to living
with PD. We offer information and resources that you can trust — tools that
help you adapt to life with PD without making it your whole life. In the long
run, however, it’s your resolve to face each day with renewed strength and
energy that will see you through. And it’s your example that will set the stage
for those people who intend to partner with you in the fight.

Understanding PD

In this part . . .
You discover what Parkinson’s disease is and how it
differs from related forms of parkinsonism. We iden-
tify the current theories on causes for the onset of
Parkinson’s and the risk factors that may play a part for
some people. Finally you get a good idea of what symp-
toms to watch for and what signs doctors look for to diag-
nose and stage this condition.

T
he National Center for Health Statistics (a division of the Centers for
Disease Control) reports that approximately 1 percent of all Americans
over the age of 65 receive a diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Sixty thou-
sand new cases are diagnosed every year. But you didn’t pick up this book
because you’re interested in mass numbers. You opened it because you’re
only interested in one number — yours or someone you love. You opened it
because you’ve noticed some symptoms that made you think Parkinson’s,
or you just got a confirmed diagnosis and you’re wondering what’s next.
What’s next is for you to go into action mode — understand the facts (rather
than listen to the myths) about PD — what causes it, how it’s treated, and, of
huge importance to anyone diagnosed with PD, how to live with it. (Notice we
said live, not just exist.) In this chapter, you find the big picture of the rest of
the book and (more to the point) where to find the information that you need
right now.

Defining Parkinson’s — 
A Movement Disorder
Parkinson’s disease is a disease in a group of conditions called movement dis-
orders — disorders that result from a loss of the brain’s control on voluntary
movements. Dopamine (a neurotransmitter in the brain) relays signals from
the substantia nigra to those brain regions (putamen, caudate, and globus
pallidus — collectively named the basal ganglia — in the striatum) that con-
trol movement, balance, and coordination (see Figure 1-1). In the brain of
people with Parkinson’s (PWP), cells that produce this essential substance
die earlier than normal.
Although a whole group of conditions are known as parkinsonism, the one
that most people know is called idiopathic PD, a Greek word that means aris-
ing spontaneously from an unknown cause. As the term suggests, the jury is
still out as to the underlying cause (though theories do exist).

Part I: Understanding PD 

Go into a room filled with 50 people with Parkinson’s (PWP) and ask how
they first suspected they had PD. You’re likely to hear 50 different stories.
Take ten of those people who were diagnosed at approximately the same time
and you’re likely to see varying signs of PD progression — from almost no
progression to more rapid onset of symptoms. Similarly, you’re likely to expe-
rience a variety of attitudes and outlooks from the individuals dealing with
their PD.
When you’re diagnosed with PD, you set out on a unique journey — one where
your outlook, lifestyle changes, and medical treatment can be key directional
maneuvers along the way. In truth, this disease is one that you can live with,
surrender to, or fight with everything you’ve got. The road veers and curves
differently for each person. Some people may choose one path for managing
symptoms, and some people choose another. Sometimes the disease itself sets
the course. The bottom line? No clear roadmaps are available. But one fact is
certain: Understanding the chronic and progressive nature of PD can take you 
a long way toward effectively managing your symptoms and living a full life.
Accepting the chronic progressive factors
Chronic and progressive can be scary words when you’re talking about your
health. But keep the words in perspective. Any number of chronic conditions
occur with age — arthritis, high blood pressure, and cholesterol management
to name three. So, take a realistic look at the terms, accept them for what
they are (and aren’t), and move on.
Chronic — it’s part of you now
In medical terms, illnesses are either acute (develop quickly and usually go
away with treatment or time) or chronic (develop over time, may be managed
with treatment, but have no cure at this time). In short, a chronic illness like
PD (or arthritis or high blood pressure) is now part of you — a fact that can
help or hinder you in the fight.
If you refuse to accept that PD is a fact of life for you, then you’re wasting pre-
cious time and energy in denial. But, if you accept that most people get chal-
lenges in life and PD is yours, then you’re ahead of the game. Facing PD is no
different than facing any situation that changed the way you thought your life
would be.
Progressive — it will get more challenging
Progressive, advancing, worsening — more scary stuff. Here’s some good
news: For millions of PWP, the progression takes years, even decades. Many
PWP live relatively normal life spans following their diagnosis. However, two
11
Chapter 1: Parkinson’s Disease: The Big Picture

factors are essential for successfully containing PD’s progressive effects: your
attitude and your willingness to attend to lifestyle and medical therapy.
Throughout this book we address both factors in multiple ways, but for now,
remember:
 Your attitude — refusing to allow this diagnosis to color every part of
your routine and life — is a huge factor in coping with the management
of new symptoms through the years.
 Your willingness to take lifestyle changes seriously and get involved in
the fight to find a cure can make all the difference between you manag-
ing the disease or the disease managing you.
To figure out how you’re going to live with PD — if you have it — you first
need to understand the basics: what it is (and is not), how you get it, what to
look for, and how it progresses.
Distinguishing between Parkinson’s 
disease and related conditions
Several neurological conditions may appear to be idiopathic (without known
cause) PD at first, but they eventually trace back to known causes, progress
differently, and respond differently to therapy. (Chapter 3 has more on this.)
These other conditions include the following:
 Essential tremor (ET) is perhaps the most common type of tremor,
affecting as many as five million Americans. ET differs from the tremor in
idiopathic PD in several ways: ET occurs when the hand is active (as in
eating, grasping, writing, and such). It may also occur in the face, voice,
and arms. The renowned actress, Katherine Hepburn, had ET, not PD.
Differentiating ET from PD is very important because each condition
responds to completely different sets of medications.
 Parkinson-plus syndromes may initially have the same symptoms as PD.
But these syndromes also cause early and severe problems with bal-
ance, blood pressure, vision, and cognition and usually have a much
faster progression compared to PD.
 Secondary parkinsonism can result from head trauma or from damage
to the brain due to multiple small strokes (atherosclerotic or vascular
parkinsonism). Both forms can be ruled out through scans (CTs or MRIs)
that produce images of the brain (see Chapter 4).
12
Part I: Understanding PD 

 Pseudoparkinsonism can appear to be PD when in fact the person has
another condition (such as depression) that can mimic the inexpressive
face of PWP.
 Drug- or toxin-induced parkinsonism can occur from taking antipsy-
chotic medications (drug-induced) or from exposure to toxins such as
carbon monoxide and manganese dust (toxin-induced). Drug-induced
symptoms are usually (but not always) reversible; toxin-induced symp-
toms usually aren’t.
The subtleties of diagnosing idiopathic PD may lead your family doctor to
send you to a neurologist, a specialist in the treatment of neurological condi-
tions. If that happens, don’t panic. Getting the correct diagnosis, discussed in
Chapter 4, is the first step toward figuring out what comes next for you.
Debunking some commonly 
held myths about PD
It’s to your advantage to get a grasp on some of the more commonly held
myths about PD — what it is and what it isn’t.
 PD is not:
• Contagious
• Curable (at this writing, but research is hopefully getting closer!)
• Normal for older people — or impossible for younger people
• A reason to make immediate life-changing decisions (like assuming
you won’t be able to work or that you need to move)
• Bound to get you if you live long enough
 PD is:
• Chronic (when you have it, you have it — like arthritis or diabetes)
• Slowly progressive (over time — often years) even with treatment
• Manageable (often for years) with proper treatment and key
lifestyle changes
• Life-changing for you, your family, and friends (Whether that’s
good or bad is up to you and how you decide to face it.)
In many ways these debunkers are the key messages we want you to take
away from this book. If you have PD, you have an enormous challenge before
you, but tens of thousands of people successfully face it every day. You can
get through this — and we’re here to show you how.
13
Chapter 1: Parkinson’s Disease: The Big Picture

Recognizing symptoms 
that raise questions
First things first: Do you have PD? Although researchers may not yet have a
clear idea of the cause(s) for PD (see Chapter 3), they have established that
idiopathic PD starts on only one side of the body and includes one or more of
these four key symptoms:
 Tremor at rest (trembling in the hands, arms, feet, legs, or face when
that body part isn’t engaged in activity)
 Rigidity (stiffness in the limbs and trunk)
 Akinesia or bradykinesia (lack of movement or slowness of movement)
 Postural instability (impaired balance or coordination of movement)
Notice how the first letters of the symptoms spell out the handy acronym
TRAP to help you remember (like you need to be reminded!). You’ll have
times when the symptoms of PD make you feel trapped inside your body. In
this book, we work hard to show you a number of ways to fight back and
maintain control of your life in spite of the TRAP.
Chapter 3 discusses symptoms (what you report to the doctor) and signs
(what the doctor observes) in more detail.
Seeking the Care You Need
Perhaps more than any other chronic condition, managing PD is a team
effort. You’re going to be working with an entire front line of healthcare pro-
fessionals (doctors, therapists, and the like) as well as non-professionals like
your family and friends and other PWP that you’ll meet along the way.
From medical professionals
At least two doctors are likely to be intricately involved: your primary care
physician and a neurologist. In addition, you’ll possibly connect with several
other healthcare professionals along the way: your pharmacist; physical,
occupational, and speech therapists; counselors and advisors to help manage
any depression, anxiety, diet changes, and exercise regimens; advisors to
help manage financial, legal, housing, and other major decisions that’ll affect
you and your family over the long term. Chapter 6 offers more information
about this group.
14
Part I: Understanding PD 

From loved ones
You’ll also have a personal care team: your spouse or significant other; your
children (and possibly grandchildren); your close friends and (if you’re diag-
nosed with young onset Parkinson’s — YOPD) your parents and siblings.
Benchwarmers who may surprise you with their willingness to help out
include neighbors, co-workers, members of groups you belong to, and others.
In Chapters 7 and 16 we talk more about how to break the news and get these
folks involved. Chapter 8 covers questions and situations specific to YOPD.
As your PD progresses
One of the toughest truths you’ll face as your PD progresses is that you have
to rely on other people’s help to some degree. Years may pass before this
becomes a factor, but you and your loved ones need to plan for it. In Chapter
18 we discuss the symptoms that can crop up as your PD progresses. Every
case of PD is different though; symptoms that occur in another person may
never be a problem for you. Knowledge is good, but assuming that you’ll
have to endure every symptom in this book is just wrong on so many levels.
The more positive approach is to prepare without projecting. For example,
will you have swallowing difficulties? Maybe, but you can have a speech ther-
apist as a part your care team, as we talk about in Chapter 6. She’s there on
the bench, ready to get in the game if you need help. Will your spouse or sig-
nificant other have to dress you, feed you, bathe you? Chances are good that
he’ll need to assist you in these basic daily activities in the advanced stages
of your PD. We cover that step in Chapter 19.
Reaching decisions about advanced PD questions before they occur (such as
identifying a caregiver and having a family meeting to plan an extended net-
work of support) is just smart planning. (That’s in Chapter 19 too).
Treating Parkinson’s — Previewing 
Your Options
After you’ve educated yourself with facts (not myths or hearsay) and drafted
your care team(s), it’s time to get down to the serious business of treating
your PD and managing symptoms as they appear. In this book we cover the
options — in fact, a growing number of options — for treating and managing
your PD symptoms. In addition to medications (Chapter 9) and — in some
15
Chapter 1: Parkinson’s Disease: The Big Picture

advanced cases — surgery (Chapter 10), you can find relief in complemen-
tary treatments (such as physical and occupation therapies) and alternative
treatments (such as yoga or acupuncture). See Chapter 11 for more about all
of these.
In the beginning your doctor may want you to postpone a prescription-
medication regimen in favor of trying some lifestyle changes — for example,
diet and exercise (see Chapter 12) and counseling for your PD-related anxiety
and depression (Chapter 13). With today’s bright spotlight on research for a
cure, you may even want to participate in one of the many clinical trials for
new treatments (Chapter 14).
As new symptoms appear (usually years after your initial diagnosis), you’ll
want to check out Chapter 18 to understand the difference between symp-
toms that can be PD-related and symptoms that can be related to the aging
process or another condition entirely(such as high blood pressure).
Starting the Course, Staying the Course
Not surprisingly, for many people and their families, the diagnosis of PD
comes as a shock. Progressive and incurable are likely to be the words that
register in these early hours. But as the news begins to sink in, you have
choices to make. The following sections provide advice.
Dealing with the here and now
As Debi Brooks, President and CEO of the Michael J. Fox Foundation, notes 
in the foreword to this book, if you’re going to truly have a life with PD, you
need to do three things: develop an attitude of action, form a problem-solving
mentality, and possess the ability to take a great deal of information coming
at you from all directions and distill it into clear, logical next steps.
Here are some tips to get you on the road:
 Stay in the here and now — not the distant future. PD is a condition you
can successfully manage, perhaps for many years, before you must rely
on other people.
 Work with your healthcare team to focus on your PD and how you can
most effectively manage those symptoms.
16
Part I: Understanding PD 

 Do not compare your situation, symptoms, or ability to manage to other
PWP. This is not a contest and you are not those persons.
 Get organized. What are your questions? Write them down. Who are the
best medical professionals to treat your PD? If finding that doctor means
traveling to another community, at least consider it. This is your life,
after all.
 Maintain some sense of control over your destiny by educating yourself.
Use only reputable sources such as those we list throughout this guide
and in Appendix B.
 Use the lingo. Everyone else will — your doctors, the people in your sup-
port group, the authors of the articles you read. We define terms as we
go, but Appendix A is a glossary for your convenience.
 Be a team player by:
• Taking the time to prepare for doctor appointments with questions
and information about your current symptoms.
• Taking charge of your own health by making changes to your diet
and exercise routine as needed — and sticking with it.
• Understanding that, although you have every right to maintain
independence and autonomy over your decisions, you also have a
responsibility to care for the people who will care for and eventu-
ally speak for you.
• Encouraging innovation in your health team, your family and
friends, and yourself. (For example, if you used to love playing jazz
saxophone but your tremor makes that impossible, does that mean
you have to give up loving jazz?)
• Celebrating even the smallest victory and allowing yourself a decent
interval to mourn the greater losses.
• Remembering that your PD is not all about you. Other people are
affected, some of them in major, life-changing ways.
• Advocating for new and more effective treatments and a cure. (You
can’t be more effective than when you’re speaking out for those
60,000 PWP who are being diagnosed each year.)
 Learn as much as you can, lean on the support of other PWP who have
been there (done that), laugh with other people and at yourself, love in
return those people who offer love in their support and care, and LIVE
with the single determination that you won’t be reduced to a PD-only
identification (“That’s Jack Wilson — he’s really an amazing person!”).
17
Chapter 1: Parkinson’s Disease: The Big Picture

Working, playing, and having a life
Okay, the medical experts are in place, you’re on a regimen customized to
manage your symptoms. What’s next? How about getting a life — at least get-
ting back to some semblance of the one you had before the diagnosis?
Part IV of this guide is all about living with PD: keeping up with the relation-
ships that are so vital to you as an individual (Chapter 15), maintaining a job
(even continuing to build a career if that’s important for you; see Chapter 16),
and getting out and about — you know, living (Chapter 17).
Making plans for your future
Any diagnosis of a chronic and progressive condition — no matter how
slowly it progresses — is a wake-up call for attending to those financial and
legal matters everyone needs to address. For you, that time is now. You 
and your family need to get together with an experienced team of financial
and legal consultants and take steps to protect you and your loved ones in
the event that you become incapacitated.
If at some point you can no longer speak for yourself or make the complex
decisions in managing finances, your care partner must know your choices
and have the power to act on your behalf. This advice is just common sense
whether a person has PD or not. Chapter 20 offers guidelines and tips that
can save you and your family a lot of stress and worry in the future on these
matters.
If your current housing become an issue later on (for example bedrooms and
the only bath are on the second floor), Chapter 21 takes a look at the growing
range of options, including adapting your current residence so you can stay
there.
In the course of our individual careers and our collaboration on this book,
the three of us have seen case after case of people living full and satisfying
lives in spite of PD. We understand that it isn’t always easy, but we have seen
the incredible results when PWP succeed in living beyond their disease.
Although no single resource can provide all the answers, we believe that in
these pages you can find the information you need to make the best deci-
sions for living your life with PD.

Chapter 2
Considering Possible Causes 
and Risk Factors
In This Chapter
 Understanding theories behind the possible causes of Parkinson’s disease
 Determining risk factors
 Assessing your at-risk quotient
A
lthough James Parkinson described the disease nearly two centuries
ago and research has been ongoing ever since, the underlying cause —
the factor that sets Parkinson’s disease (PD) in motion — is still unknown. A
number of theories are under discussion and research, any one of which may
lead to the breakthrough in managing symptoms or even curing the disease.
The medical community has also made progress in assessing risk factors —
some more common than others. In this chapter we cover these potential
causes and risk factors so you can better understand them as the hunt for a
cure continues.
Considering Theories on Causes
The underlying event behind the onset of PD is a loss of neurons (nerve cells)
in the substantia nigra region of the brain. These neurons normally produce
dopamine, a neurotransmitter that helps the brain communicate with other
parts of the body, telling them to perform common movements (such as walk-
ing, handling objects, and maintaining balance) almost automatically.
PD is a little like diabetes because in both diseases
 You lose a vital chemical (insulin in diabetes; dopamine in PD).
 The chemicals are essential to the body’s ability to function properly.
 The chemicals can be replaced.

Of course, the diseases are more complex than that, but you get the idea. As
we age, all of us lose dopamine-producing neurons, which results in the slower,
more measured movements. But the decline of dopamine in people with
Parkinson’s (PWP) is not normal.
Why PD targets the substantia nigra at the stem of the brain remains a mys-
tery. But the damage results in abnormal protein deposits that can disrupt
the normal function of the cells in that area. These protein clumps are called
Lewy bodies, named for Freiderich H. Lewy, the German physician who dis-
covered and documented them in 1908. The presence of Lewy bodies within
the substantia nigra is associated with a depletion of the brain’s normal
supply of dopamine. For this reason, their presence is one of the pathological
hallmarks of PD (although Lewy bodies are present in other disorders).
In reality, Lewy bodies have been found in other parts of the brain affected 
by PD, which suggests that the problem may be more widespread. This more
extensive pathology may explain the occurrence of non-motor and levodopa-
unresponsive symptoms (see Chapter 9). Nevertheless, researchers still
don’t know whether Lewy bodies cause the damage to the nerve cells or are
a by-product of damage caused by another factor.
Theories on causes abound — family history, environment, occupation, and
so on. Today’s researchers generally agree, however, that the onset of PD is a
multi-factorial process; that is, several conditions are at play in the onset of
PD rather than one specific and single cause. But the true causes behind the
onset of PD in one person and not another — in one family member and not
another — are unknown.
Much of the research today focuses on environmental and genetic factors
that may contribute to the onset of PD. This section takes a look at those
environmental conditions and then considers genetic issues and other fac-
tors that scientists have identified as potential causes.
Taking a close look at 
environmental factors
According to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, PD is
the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder behind Alzheimer’s
disease. Of the three primary risk factors for PD (age, genetics, and environ-
mental exposures), a line of research that began in the 1980s shows an
increasing association between environmental factors and PD. The following
sections explore the variety of environmental exposures that may play a role
in triggering PD.
20
Part I: Understanding PD 

Location, location, location
For the overwhelming number of PD patients who get Parkinson’s, certain
environmental factors seem to put the person at higher risk for getting the
disease. Consider that family members share not only a genetic history but
also an environmental history — at least for a portion of their lives. They live
in the same house, drink the same water, eat the same food from the same
sources, have exposure to the same chemical compounds, and so on. There-
fore, researchers are studying geographic environmental factors as a possible
link to the onset of PD. These factors include living in a rural area and using
well water for drinking, cooking, and such.
Exposure to toxins
Toxins that people inhale or ingest can damage the body in many ways,
including cell function interference. Research shows that excessive exposure
to specific environmental or industrial toxic chemicals such as pesticides and
herbicides can increase the risk of developing PD. For example, the damage
by the pesticide rotenone is directed at the mitochondria (the power plant of
our brain cells) and can critically reduce the energy produced by the cell
until the cell dies. (See the “Free radicals — the internal battle” sidebar for
more on this topic.)
In some cases environmental toxicity and genetic factors may operate in
tandem. Scientists have discovered that the gene CYP2D6, when functioning
normally, produces an enzyme that breaks down the toxicity of pesticides.
21
Chapter 2: Considering Possible Causes and Risk Factors
Free radicals — the internal battle
Free radicals are unstable molecules that lack
one electron. In their quest to replace that miss-
ing link, they rub against other molecules, seek-
ing a connection that will stabilize them.
Even when the free radical doesn’t make a con-
nection, it keeps digging, damaging other mole-
cules in the cell in a process known as oxidation
or oxidative stress. Normally your body has
enough antioxidants to stabilize the free radical
and repair the damage, but if it doesn’t, then
those damaged cells die.
Key players in controlling oxidative stress are
the mitochondria (the part of the cell outside the
nucleus that converts nutrients into energy)
because they’re a potential source of free radi-
cals. In addition, several of the toxins associ-
ated with PD seem to damage specifically the
mitochondria. Researchers believe a connec-
tion may exist between oxidative stress and the
death of cells in the substantia nigra, which
causes PD symptoms. This theory is one of the
main reasons that some doctors recommend a
diet rich in antioxidants. (See Chapter 12 for
more on diets for PWP.)

But in some people the gene is less effective, leaving those people more sen-
sitive to the toxicity of pesticides. More studies are needed to verify whether
there may be a correlation between genetic predisposition to pesticide toxic-
ity and PD.
Links to viral problems
Although PD is not contagious, a viral factor may be associated with its
cause. This hypothesis is mainly based on the occurrence of post-encephalitic
parkinsonism after the influenza pandemic of 1918. More Americans died from
this flu in a single year than from the all the wars from World War I through
the Vietnam War.
To complicate matters, many patients developed the so-called sleeping sick-
ness (encephalitis lethargica), characterized by the progression from severe
headache to drowsiness to possible coma and death. Patients who survived
the encephalitis (brain infection) often developed symptoms of parkinson-
ism, including bradykinesia, rigidity, hypomimia, postural instability, and 
eye movement abnormalities (oculogyric crises). The memoir Awakenings by
Oliver Sacks (Vintage) and the 1990 movie by the same title starring Robin
Williams and Robert de Niro provide an insightful and accurate representa-
tion of this disease.
In reality, the relationship of a virus (such as influenza) and the brain degen-
erative lesions causing parkinsonism has not been proven. Furthermore, the
pathology described in the brain of patients with post-encephalitic parkin-
sonism is very different from PD and actually bears more of a resemblance 
to Alzheimer’s disease. So the possible viral link with parkinsonism remains
elusive.
Although these environmental factors and cellular interactions appear to sig-
nificantly contribute to the onset of PD, the Parkinson’s Disease Foundation
notes “no conclusive evidence that any single environmental factor, alone,
can be considered a cause of the disease.” (Go to the foundation’s Web site 
at www.pdf.org/aboutPD/ and click on Causes for more information on
this topic.)
Looking at possible genetic factors
Every human being plays host to a gazillion genes in their DNA molecules.
Genes determine everything from the color of your eyes to the possibility of
developing a certain disease or condition. Note the use of the word possibil-
ity. Because you carry genes in double copies, if one of your genes has the
propensity for a condition, the other copy may offset that vulnerability.
22
Part I: Understanding PD 

According to the National Human Genome Research Institute, evidence now
shows a genetic factor in the development of PD. People with a close relative
(parent or sibling) who has PD are slightly more likely to contract Parkinson’s
than someone who has no family history of the disease. But, according to the
Mayo Clinic, the link is a small one — less than 5 percent — and more common
when the onset occurs before age 30, which is also very rare. (For more infor-
mation on early onset PD, check out Chapter 8.)
So why waste time and money studying genes? Oddly enough, the very fact
that PD is one of the most typical nongenetic diseases makes the genetic
study of PD patients interesting. In other words, if PD is typically not inher-
ited, then what else is going on?
In the last decade, scientists have identified multiple genes with definite links
to the onset of PD in families where PD is present in multiple generations. 
An abnormality in one such gene, Parkin, may be a predictor of the onset of
Parkinson’s at a young age (before age 50). Because Parkinson’s is present
and progressing for several years before any symptoms become obvious, a
gene predictor can mean earlier diagnosis and earlier intervention.
Another recent discovery shows that a mutation (change) in the protein-
producing gene alpha-synuclein may change the gene’s amino acid composi-
tion and thereby contribute to the development of clumps (separate cells
bonding together) in dopamine neurons, eventually damaging or destroying
the dopamine-producing neuron. Interestingly, alpha-synuclein is part of the
Lewy bodies, the hallmark protein deposit in dopamine cells affected by
Parkinson’s disease. If researchers can find a way to break up those clumps
and get rid of the excess proteins, then they may have found a way to slow or
even stop the progression of PD. (See the section “Occupational causes” later
in this chapter for more about clumping.)
Keep in mind that less than 5 percent of PWP appear to have inherited it; at
this writing, any genetic factor seems limited to a relatively small number of
families. However, the study of genes enhances the ability to understand
which molecules a scientist may target for treatment. If you have a family 
history of PD or are interested in more information on genetic research, visit
www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/parkinsons_disease.
Checking out other possible causes
If it’s not family history and it’s not the environment, what caused your PD?
Unfortunately, that’s a difficult question to answer at this stage. And any time
a chronic illness has no definitive cause, theories will fly. At the moment, PD
has its fair share of such theories. The following sections describe instances
where the jury is still out regarding a link with the onset of PD.
23
Chapter 2: Considering Possible Causes and Risk Factors

Latent effects of war
Links between PD and Agent Orange (an herbicide used during the Vietnam
War) and chemical weapons during the Gulf War continue to be relevant
questions for PD researchers. For example, in 2003 the Salk Institute identi-
fied a gene (called neuropathy target estrase or NTE). In studies with mice,
scientists found that when NTE genes are exposed to organophosphate
chemicals (such as those used in the Gulf War), the gene’s normal activity
was inhibited and even changed. While this discovery has certainly opened
new doors (not to mention raised new questions), the evidence is far from
conclusive. Remember that age is a consideration in the onset of PD and
Vietnam vets are reaching the age that onset of PD is more common simply
because of their generation. Whether exposure to Agent Orange may also 
be a contributing factor is still not clear. The good news is that the Veterans
Administration (VA) is conducting ongoing research. If you’re a veteran of
either war, you can find out more information by contacting the U.S.
Department of Veterans Affairs online at www.va.gov.
Overmedication and drug use
Certain drugs taken to excess or over a long period of time may produce the
symptoms of PD. Some of the conditions and their drugs include
 Schizophrenia, major depression, or agitation in older people: haloperi-
dol (Haldol) and chloropromazine (Thorazine)
 Control of nausea: metoclopramide (Reglan) and prochlorperazine
(Compazine)
Side effects of such medicines usually subside after the medicine is out of the
body’s system. Note: Symptoms brought on by drug use commonly occur on
both sides of your body at the same time, unlike primary PD. The question
remains whether a drug reaction of this nature is a predictor for PD.
Illicit drug use may also be a factor. In one case, a group of young people
brewed up what they thought was a hallucinogenic drug called meperidine
and mistakenly produced a heroin-like drug. When injected, this drug, which
contained the toxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP),
headed straight for the substantia nigra, destroying dopamine cells in its
path and leaving the youngsters with signs of advanced PD. The tragedy has
led to more research on the possibility of a connection between illicit drug
use and the onset of PD.
Occupational causes
Many people have theorized that Muhammad Ali’s PD was brought on by his
years in the boxing ring. “Too many times getting hit in the head,” they
24
Part I: Understanding PD 

assert. Indeed some studies suggest an association between head trauma and
the development of PD. Possibly Ali’s years in the ring brought the underlying
presence of his PD to light.
Another class of work associated with onset of PD is the welding profession.
At this writing, an absolute connection doesn’t exist between prolonged
exposure to metallic fumes or dust and the onset of PD-like symptoms.
Nevertheless, researchers continue to explore the possibility of a link
because studies show that exposure to heavy metals and pesticides — each
already linked to a possible cause for onset of PD — can accelerate the
clumping of certain protein cells called alpha-synuclein. (See the earlier sec-
tion “Looking at possible genetic factors” for more on this gene.)
25
Chapter 2: Considering Possible Causes and Risk Factors
Sounds like sci-fi, but a word 
about neuroprotectors
The brain has two types of cells: neurons (nerve
cells) and glia (cells that respond to injury and
regulate the chemical composition surrounding
them, among other tasks). Although glia cells are
far more prevalent, the neuron cells do the heavy
lifting when it comes to brain work. According to
the National Institute of Neurological Disorders
and Stroke, the three classes of neurons are:
 Sensory neurons to carry information from
the senses (eyes, ears, and such) to the
brain
 Motor neurons to carry messages from the
central nervous system (comprised of the
brain, spinal cord, and network of nerves
running through the body) to the body’s
muscles and glands
 Interneurons that communicate only within
their immediate location
Within each category, hundreds of neuron types
operate with the very specific messaging abili-
ties that make each person unique. But the neu-
rons affected by PD control the body’s ability to
move. When those neurons die in large enough
numbers, the brain’s ability to signal the body to
move is compromised.
Researchers are working hard to understand
the death of these neurons and to develop treat-
ments and therapies that can protect them. One
potential value of stem cell research is that
neural stem cells may reproduce the variety of
neurons in the brain. Scientists could then
figure out how to maneuver these new neurons
to become
 A protector of healthy neurons (preventing
or at least slowing further damage or loss)
 A replacement for damaged or dead 
neurons
In addition, ongoing research considers whether
certain therapies — such as certain drugs, 
vitamin supplements, and rigorous exercise 
therapy — may act as a protector and slow the
loss of these vital neurons. For more information
on the role of neuroprotection in the battle
against PD, check out Chapters 11 and 12.

Oddly enough, in more than one occupational study, teachers and healthcare
workers showed a higher incidence of PD — as much as two to three times
higher than other professions. Researchers are puzzled because the com-
monality in the two professions seems to be exposure to infection, even
though PD is clearly not a contagious disease.
Weighing Your Risk Factors
Your suspicion that you have PD (or an actual diagnosis from your doctor)
can raise all sorts of questions starting with, “How did this happen to me?”
It’s perfectly normal to look back and consider the risk factors that were pre-
sent (although unknown at the time) as you also look forward to protecting
your children and others around you from those same risks.
Start with what is known for sure:
 PD is not contagious — you can’t get it from or give it to another person.
 Most cases (at least three-fourths) show up after age 60, and incidence
increases every decade after that.
 Head trauma (a serious fall or accident involving injury to the head) can
be a risk factor for PD.
 Men are more likely to get PD than women.
Your particular risk factors (or family members’ risks if you suspect you have
PD) are the life and lifestyle details that can increase the chances of develop-
ing PD. They may be multi-factorial. (You may be at risk from more than one
source or situation).
Considering your age and gender
The one concrete risk factor for developing PD is age. Most people develop
symptoms in middle age, but the risk for developing PD increases simply
because dopamine production declines with age. The average age for onset is
60, and risk increases until around age 75. Some research has shown a signifi-
cant decrease in the number of people who develop PD after age 75.
At least three studies have confirmed that men are more likely to develop 
PD than women — in some studies twice as likely. One theory suggests that
the production of estrogen may protect women. At the 2006 meeting of the
American Academy of Neurology, a research team from the Mayo Clinic 
26
Part I: Understanding PD 

presented evidence that points to a possible link between risk for contracting
PD and three genes that control the production of estrogen. Simply put, if the
presence of estrogen reduces the risk, a decrease in estrogen increases a
woman’s risk factor for getting PD. However, more studies are needed to con-
firm a protective role for estrogen in PD.
Taking a look at ethnicity
Studies have shown that non-white populations, such as African Americans
and Asian Americans, have a lower risk of developing primary Parkinson’s
disease but may be more vulnerable to other forms of parkinsonism such 
as essential tremor and multiple system atrophy (see Chapter 1). However,
whether this difference is tied to an economic and class-based imbalance in
the delivery of medical care — especially specialized medical care, like
seeing a neurologist —has not been fully considered.
Regarding other risk possibilities
Although they aren’t definitive causes, some factors we discuss in this chap-
ter may contribute to your risk for developing PD. In a world where pesti-
cides and herbicides have so many uses, it’s hard to avoid exposure to
chemicals that put you at risk for all sorts of health problems including PD.
Similarly, in an eat-on-the-run fast-food society, people may be denying their
body’s needs for key vitamins and nutrients. And what about the dangers of
such evils as smoking and caffeine? Can these all be factors that put people
at greater risk for getting PD?
Overexposure to herbicides and pesticides
Your everyday exposure to chemical toxins can range from the chemicals to
control weeds on your lawn to the unseen sprays that coat and polish fresh
produce from overseas. Because prolonged or consistent exposure to such
toxins is a possible cause of PD (check out “Taking a close look at environ-
mental factors” early in this chapter for more on toxins), take the following
precautions:
 Wash all fresh produce thoroughly — even those items like melons or
citrus where you normally discard the skin.
 Limit your exposure to the use of toxins such as pesticides and 
insecticides.
 Use all chemical materials in open areas and wear a protective mask.
27
Chapter 2: Considering Possible Causes and Risk Factors

If your job requires you to work with chemical compounds such as those in
industrial pesticides and herbicides, talk to your employer about precautions
to protect you and other employees from exposure and contamination.
Factoring in your weight
Face it: Being overweight sets you up for all kinds of health risks. A 2002
study showed that carrying excess weight during your middle and later years
can put you at greater risk for PD. A report in the May, 2003 issue of Psychology
Today magazine shows an increased rate of PD linked to dietary fat and sugar
intake. Although the association between weight gain and PD hasn’t been
proven, the benefits of a diet rich in antioxidants and a regular program of
exercise can’t hurt. (In some cases, these benefits have prolonged the time
before PD symptoms needed to be treated with medication (see Chapter 12).
Reduced levels of B6, B12, and folate
B6, B12, and folate are essential nutrients for maintaining many of the body’s
functions. Researchers are beginning to explore whether reduced levels of
these nutrients may be a factor in PD. Although studies are in preliminary
stages to verify any role the nutrients may play in the management of PD,
consider asking your doctor about increasing or supplementing your intake
of nutrients.
Regardless of the research and the nutrients’ potential for managing your PD,
people over age 50 are at increased risk for deficiencies of these three essen-
tial nutrients. A diet rich in these nutrients and a supplement (if your doctor
advises) may be helpful. However, these need to be carefully monitored by
your doctor. Too much B6, for example, can cause additional neuropathic
problems such as a profound inability to feel your legs.
Check with your doctor before taking any vitamin or herbal supplement.
Claims for these products often lack solid research. The overuse of such
products may do more harm than good.
Smoking and caffeine
Get this: As many as 50 published studies over two decades have shown 
that smoking cigarettes reduces the risk of Parkinson’s in people who have
smoked steadily most of their adult lives. Caffeine also appears to offer some
protection.
But these factors are not a guarantee (as Michael J. Fox noted in an NBC
Dateline interview in 2006). And the negative effects of these factors (such as
lung cancer from smoking) that can greatly shorten your stay on this planet
are way too grim to think a two-pack-a-day habit may be worth the risk.
28
Part I: Understanding PD 

Changing Don’t Know to Know
The more researchers tackle the problems of PD, the more complex the chal-
lenges become. This section takes a quick look at the unknowns of PD and
offers ways that PWP and the general public can help PD research move 
forward.
The need-to-know info
Questions for PD researchers abound, but one of the greatest challenges is
simply getting a good handle on the accurate numbers and extent of PD. For
example
 Scientists really don’t know how common Parkinson’s is.
 They don’t know whether the numbers are changing over time or simply
reflecting longevity and an aging population.
 They don’t know whether geographic cluster patterns exist (places in
the United States where PD is unusually prevalent or absent).
The Muhammad Ali Foundation has established a voluntary registry where
patients may record their PD diagnosis and information. (Register at www.
alicenter.org.) However, because this information is random and volun-
tary, it has limited practicality.
At this writing, PD has no national registry where doctors can report the diag-
nosis of PD in the United States. (California is the only state where doctors
must report cases of Parkinson’s.) A mandatory national registry for the diag-
nosis of PD would be an enormous step forward (a global registry would be
even better!) and one of the best ways to help researchers gather the knowl-
edge and data they need. This registry may seem an invasion of your privacy,
but information that allows researchers to track patterns is the best way to
gain vital knowledge that leads to new treatments and a cure.
The attitude that busts research barriers
At the 2006 World Parkinson’s Congress in Washington, D.C., Joan Samuelson
(founder of the Parkinson’s Action Network) said that when first diagnosed,
she believed her job was to be a patient patient. That attitude quickly changed
as Joan understood more about the known and unknowns of PD. Today her
motto is that patients need to be in the room — the PD patient community
needs to take a vocal and proactive role in helping research move forward.
29
Chapter 2: Considering Possible Causes and Risk Factors

You may not be ready to take on this larger fight, but keep it in the back of
your mind as you use this book. Note: In many ways you’ve taken a key first
step — you’re educating yourself about Parkinson’s and what a diagnosis
may mean for you and your loved ones. But getting involved with the greater
Parkinson’s community at a local, state, and national level is one of the most
empowering steps you can take to live a full and productive life in spite of PD.

henever you have a concern about your health, you’ve usually taken
note of certain troubling (and unexplained) symptoms. Perhaps you
seem more clumsy than usual or your joints seem unusually stiff and rigid. If
these symptoms are troubling enough, you’re likely to make an appointment
with your primary care physician (PCP) to have them checked out. After you
describe your symptoms, your doctor conducts a clinical exam looking for
signs that may explain your symptoms.
In this chapter, we describe the symptoms that can signal Parkinson’s disease
(PD) as well as the signs your doctor looks or to reach a diagnosis. Although
many chronic, progressive conditions move through defined stages, this
chapter stresses how progression in PD is unique for each patient.
Familiarizing Yourself with the Lingo
In the medical world, a symptom is
 What you feel or perceive before you see the doctor.
 The reason you ultimately decide to make an appointment.
 The details (vague or specific) you give when the doctor or nurse asks
why you’ve come in.

For example, you may say that you’re more tired than usual or moving more
slowly because you lack energy. Or perhaps you’re depressed or experiencing
dizziness or shaking.
In contrast, medical signs are what your doctor observes during the examina-
tion. The best doctors use their senses in addition to the data from the usual
medical imaging techniques and screening tools (see Chapter 4 for more
about these instruments). For example, a doctor’s touch may sense tightened
muscles, or his eyes may observe a fine tremor when your hand’s at rest, or
he may note a compromised balance or slight shuffle when you walk. His ears
may detect softer speech, a searching for words, or unusual sounds in your
lungs or intestines.
Simply put, symptoms make up your subjective report of your experiences,
and signs contribute to your doctor’s objective basis for a diagnosis.
Disease staging divides a chronic and progressive illness into levels that usu-
ally correspond to the advancement of symptoms and disease. Generally,
stages have the following labels:
 Early stage: The disease is manageable with little outside assistance.
 Moderate stage: The patient needs more assistance and lifestyle changes.
 Advanced stage: The disease has advanced to the point that can be diffi-
cult to manage; the patient may face the end of life.
The following sections take a closer look at symptoms (what you tell your
doctor), signs (what your doctor observes and discovers via tests and exami-
nation), and staging (where you are in the progression if you do have PD).
Symptoms — What You Look for
Let’s cut to the chase. You suspect that you or someone you love may have
PD or you wouldn’t be flipping through this book and you definitely wouldn’t
have turned to this chapter. Ask yourself what’s behind those suspicions.
 A slight shakiness in the hands? Does it occur in only one hand? If the
shaking occurs while the hand is at rest, does it stop when that hand
picks up a cup of coffee, a pen, or a tennis racket? If the shakiness is in
both hands and doesn’t stop when the person grasps something, then
PD probably isn’t the cause (but get it checked out anyway).
 A general slowing down of movement? Does it take longer to walk from
one place to another or to get in and out of the car? Has there been an
32
Part I: Understanding PD 

increase in stumbling, clumsiness, or loss of balance? Do you (or does
the person) feel tired, stiff, or just not yourself?
 A significant change in energy level or outlook? Everyone experiences
days when they’re tired or weaker than usual. And everyone has the
blues from time to time. But if you’ve been feeling unusually weak,
fatigued, depressed, or anxious for longer than two weeks, those symp-
toms need attention — even when you have a plausible cause (such as
an unusually busy week at work or the death of a loved one).
 Gastrointestinal problems (like constipation) or psychological prob-
lems (like increased nervousness or anxiety)? In some cases, patients
show none of the usual symptoms, so don’t stop with the more tradi-
tional PD symptoms.
These are the symptoms — the feelings, aches, and pains that have made you
think something’s not right. It may be PD or it may not. Either way, you owe it
to yourself to get your doctor’s assessment.
Signs — What Your Doctor Looks for
When you see your doctor, she’ll listen as you describe your symptoms and
then conduct an examination to determine what those symptoms indicate. As
you talk about your symptoms, your doctor begins a differential diagnosis if
your symptoms indicate several possibilities. For example, if your symptoms
are in keeping with PD, your doctor also looks for signs that indicate PD. But
any doctor worth her salt doesn’t offer a firm diagnosis before she’s seen the
results of several tests and a specialist has confirmed her suspicions.
In addition to four primary signs of PD (which may or may not be evident
when you first go to the doctor), your doctor considers several secondary
signs and symptoms. And because PD is a neurological condition, it doesn’t
just affect your physical movement; it can also trigger non-motor or cognitive
signs and symptoms. We discuss all of these signs and symptoms in the fol-
lowing sections.
Four primary signs
Although the actual causes and risk factors for getting PD are still mysterious
(see Chapter 2 for more on these factors), the primary signs that signal the
presence of PD are very clear. You may have noticed one or more of these
signs but then dismissed it as something slight, easily explained, or due to an
entirely different condition.
33
Chapter 3: Sizing Up Symptoms, Signs, and Stages

Several resources use the acronym TRAP to illustrate the four primary signs
of PD. And, because PD seems to trap your body with your brain’s compro-
mised ability to communicate, the acronym makes the top four symptoms
easy to remember.
T = Tremor at rest (uncontrolled shaking)
PD was originally called shaking palsy because the resting tremor (it goes
away as soon as the hand is engaged) rarely occurs in other illnesses.
Characteristically, the resting tremor begins in one hand and moves to the
other hand years later in the disease. The tremor may extend to the leg or
foot on the same side and sometimes to the lips and jaw — or you may have
no tremor at all. Tremor in the head and neck, however, is less common in
primary Parkinson’s disease.
Variations of the resting tremor include:
 Postural tremor (obvious when arms are extended to hold a position or
posture)
 Action tremor (present when certain tasks, such as holding, are 
performed)
 Internal tremor (the patient feels the tremor but can’t show it, almost as
if it’s coming from inside)
While tremor is the most obvious symptom of PD, it doesn’t have to be pre-
sent for diagnosis.
R = Rigidity (stiff muscles)
Rigidity is probably the most ignored and easy-to-explain-as-something-else
sign. In plain English, rigidity means stiffness. (Who doesn’t experience stiff-
ness in joints and limbs that makes movement more difficult as they age?) If
your doctor observes rigidity (without other signs of PD), he may first sus-
pect arthritis and prescribe an anti-inflammatory medication. But, if medicine
doesn’t relieve the stiffness, you need to let your doctor know.
A = Akinesia (absence or slowness of movement)
Especially early on, people with PD (PWP) may experience slight bradykinesia
(unusually slow movement). Much later in the progression, that slowed
movement may become akinesia (no movement).
Get to know these terms because, if indeed you or a loved one has PD, you’ll
hear these words again and again. Kinesia means movement in the sense of
knowing what you want your body to do. So akinesia and bradykinesia indi-
cate problems initiating or continuing an action. For example, to walk across
the room, you stand up and your brain tells your foot to step out — but with
bradykinesia, your body doesn’t move right away.
34
Part I: Understanding PD 

The problem can extend well beyond simply walking from here to there.
Bradykinesia can also affect
 Facial expression because it slows blinking eye movement and the 
ability to smile. Read more about this facial mask in the next section,
“Secondary signs and symptoms.”
 Fine motor movements, such as the ability to manage buttons or cut
food because the fingers lack the necessary speed and coordination to
perform these detailed actions. In addition, fingers may curl or stiffen
because of rigidity.
 The ability to easily turn over in bed because of lack of coordination
between the various parts of the body that need to move in sequence;
again muscle stiffness and rigidity may further complicate this normally
routine task. (See discussion of secondary signs and symptoms later in
this chapter.)
P = Postural instability (impaired balance)
In a healthy person, the natural movement is to alternately swing the arms and
step forward with assurance. For PWP, however, the swing slowly decreases; in
time the person moves with small, uncertain, shuffling steps. (PWP may adapt
by propelling themselves forward with several quick, short steps.) Other PWP
experience episodes of freezing (their feet feel glued to the floor).
Problems with balance (resulting in falls that can cause major injuries, hospi-
talization, and escalation of symptoms) are usually not a factor until later
stages in PD. In time, PWP may lose the ability to gauge the necessary action
to regain balance and prevent a fall. They may grasp at doorways or other
stationary objects in an effort to prevent the loss of balance. Unfortunately,
these maneuvers can make PWP appear to be under the influence of alcohol
or other substances.
Secondary signs and symptoms
Many of the following indicators — although not essential to a PD diagnosis —
are observable early on and can contribute to the diagnosis of PD. During your
appointment, tell your physician anything that is troublesome regarding these
secondary symptoms. They’re part of your symptomatic history that helps
your doctors see the total picture of your condition.
Facial mask
The mask (lack of facial expression) is a common sign of PD, and it can lead
people to assume that you’re not listening or not understanding the conver-
sation. The difference may simply be a change in your facial expression due
35
Chapter 3: Sizing Up Symptoms, Signs, and Stages

to decreased animation or emotion. Maybe someone has said, “You don’t
smile as often,” and you’re thinking, “I’m smiling just as often as before!”
Likewise, people may accuse you of staring, but the real problem is that the
number of eye-blinks has decreased.
Slowed or slurred speech
You (or other folks) may notice that your voice is softer or fades away after a
strong start. Your doctor may further note that your voice lacks normal varia-
tions of tone and emotion or that you sound hoarse but report nothing to
explain that hoarseness. In some cases you may have trouble saying a word
clearly; you slur it instead of enunciating.
As PD advances, other speech issues (such as stuttering or speaking very
rapidly) can appear; swallowing difficulties may develop later in the disease.
(See Chapter 18 for more info about advanced symptoms of PD.)
Small, cramped handwriting
Handwriting that once was free-flowing and smooth may appear increasingly
cramped and jerky. This micrographia typically appears as letters that become
progressively smaller (for example: Parkinson) and closer together.
Constipation and urinary incontinence
Most people (even some doctors) associate constipation with aging. But PD
can also slow the bowels (as it does the rest of the body), so mention any
unusual changes in bowel habits or routine to your doctor.
By the same token, urinary frequency (having to urinate often) and urinary
urgency (NOW!) are common sideshows in the aging process. Although these
problems may be signs of a totally unrelated condition, they are not uncom-
mon in PD. Definitely bring these symptoms to your doctor’s attention.
Increased sweating or oily skin
A sensitivity to heat and cold and excessively oily (or dry) skin are other
signs that may indicate PD.
Non-motor signs and symptoms
Although the TRAP signs (check out the earlier section, “Four primary signs”)
are often enough evidence to raise the possibility of PD, non-motor factors
may be present before those primary signs appear. Your doctor may ask
questions to discover underlying symptoms that you’ve been ignoring or
simply discounting.
36
Part I: Understanding PD 

It is vital that you keep an open mind and answer your doctor’s questions as
honestly and fully as possible. Any one of the following symptoms or a com-
bination of them may indicate a condition other than PD. Don’t jump to con-
clusions or try to self-diagnose. Trust your doctor on this!
Anxiety or depression
Anxiety and depression are such an integral part of PD that they get their
own chapter (Chapter 13) in this book. For now, remember that these feelings
may be some of the earliest symptoms of PD. Anxiety episodes can range
from a mild, underlying feeling of uneasiness to a full-blown panic attack.
Depression may disguise itself as a general lack of interest in normal activi-
ties, or it may be severe enough for you or your family to consider counseling
or medication.
Executive dysfunction and cognitive abnormalities
Do you have trouble balancing your checkbook, following directions, or
making decisions? In medical terms, these symptoms are examples of execu-
tive dysfunction. Another term, cue-dependent function, is also part of the non-
motor symptom package, and it means you need a reminder of some sort. 
For example, you may need an alarm that tells you to take your medicine or
attend a meeting. Or you have labels on cabinets and drawers to remind you
of their contents. Of course, many people use these reminders, especially
when their lives are jammed with multiple responsibilities and a calendar
brimming with appointments and commitments. But if you notice an escala-
tion in the need for such reminders, mention it to your doctor.
In addition as many as half of all PWP experience problems with memory,
thought processing, and word finding. These symptoms are usually more 
pronounced in later stages (see Chapter 18).
Dizziness or lightheadedness
In some cases dizziness or lightheadedness is due to a drop in blood pres-
sure when you stand up, especially in warm weather or over-heated rooms.
Although dizziness can be a factor in a number of conditions, don’t ignore
mentioning it to your doctor if it’s one of your symptoms.
Sleep disturbances
PWP usually have no trouble getting to sleep. The more common problems
are staying asleep, napping throughout the day, and moving restlessly when
asleep. In some cases, the PWP has intense dreams that add to the restless-
ness and disturbance of normal sleep.
37
Chapter 3: Sizing Up Symptoms, Signs, and Stages

Sexual dysfunction
As with many medical conditions, PD can adversely affect sexual desire 
and performance. The underlying causes may or may not be related to PD;
however, if the problem is part of your PD, it may be relieved with proper
medication and treatment.
Visual hallucinations
Visual hallucinations (seeing people or objects that really aren’t present) can be
a side effect of many medications. In the case of antiparkinsonian meds, hallu-
cinations are usually benign. Note: If a patient reports hallucinations before 
the PD diagnosis and before she begins taking PD meds, the doctor will look for
other medications or causes that may be at the root of the problem.
Stages — Understanding the 
Unique Path PD Can Take
The key to living with any chronic, progressive illness is taking responsibility
to maintain your life beyond that condition. We discuss this in much greater
depth throughout the book. For now, the significant question is: If this is PD
and it does progress, then how fast and to what extent?
Some chronic (long-lasting) and progressive (advancing or worsening) dis-
eases have clear-cut divisions between stages (obvious and even predictable
changes in the patient’s condition). However, PD isn’t one of those — it
affects each patient differently. In rare cases, PD can progress rapidly; the
person quickly becomes dependent on others for assistance with basic daily
activities. However, for most PWP the progression takes years. With proper
treatment and management of new symptoms, PWP can live independently
for quite some time before they need close care.
Don’t let yourself or others try to project the future. Prepare — plan for what
may happen — yes. Project — assume it will happen on a certain timetable —
no. Projecting only adds to your anxiety and may actually prevent you from
taking some measures that prolong the time between stages.
In spite of PD’s lack of clearly defined and timed steps, your doctor may
describe your condition in terms of stages. This breakdown is common prac-
tice in the medical profession because it permits doctors to use a common
and accepted language when making notes about your condition. If you need
to change doctors midstream, the new physician’s ability to understand the
previous doctor’s notes can save you valuable time and enhance the new
doctor’s ability to address your needs.
38
Part I: Understanding PD 

Although your PD takes a path unique to you and in response to your lifestyle
and medical choices, the disease does have some broad outlines of progres-
sion. For a fuller discussion of PD rating scales that determine its various
stages, turn to Chapter 4.
Early stage PD: When life 
can be fairly normal
You may have experienced (and ignored) certain warning signals from PD for
several years before you went to your doctor. Maybe you were constantly
tired or had a vague, don’t-feel-good sensation. As your general movement
slowed, maybe you dismissed it as getting older or lack of energy today.
Then you began to notice some troubling (not to mention, annoying!) symp-
toms: stiffness that was different from the not-as-young-as-I-used-to-be ver-
sion, shakiness, dizziness, or mood changes. You know the list.
If you have tremor, you may have barely noticed it at first, or maybe you dis-
missed it as a spasm. It may have appeared in one finger, so you noticed it
only when you were performing a certain task, like tying your shoe or button-
ing a jacket.
In early stage PD, the following conditions may occur:
 Symptoms are mild and often easily explained.
 Symptoms are annoying when they occur, but they don’t significantly
interfere with normal activity.
 Symptoms occur on only one side of the body.
 Tremor is present in one limb — usually the hand — and is most notice-
able when the hand is at rest.
 Other people may comment on changes related to appearance, posture,
energy, and facial expression.
In the early stages of PD, you can manage for some time with no pharmacologi-
cal intervention. In other words, you don’t need pills to control the symptoms.
Moderate stage PD: When 
you need to accept help
The defining signal of progression in PD is symptoms on both sides of the
body. However, even at this stage, the diagnosis of PD has been missed in
39
Chapter 3: Sizing Up Symptoms, Signs, and Stages

some cases simply because the symptoms (rigidity, gait change, tremor) were
taken as normal signs of aging.
Other factors that may signal the moderate stage include the following:
 Your posture becomes stooped; your head is more often bent forward
with your chin toward the chest.
 Movement of all body parts is significantly slower. When you walk, you
often experience freezing (your feet feel glued to the floor); your hand
tremor may now affect your entire arm, making activities such as shav-
ing or brushing your teeth more difficult.
 Cognitive and executive function (see “Non-motor signs and symptoms”
earlier in this chapter) is more impaired. Short-term memory, putting
thoughts into words, balancing a checkbook, and making decisions are
all more challenging.
 Late-moderate denotes increasing need for anti-dopaminergic medica-
tions. Problems with balance and risks of falls (which may result in
injuries that require hospitalization) can actually speed the onset of late
stage PD. (See Chapter 17.)
 PWP must rely on medicines as well as assistance from other people to
pursue many of the activities they took for granted before PD. Examples
of these activities are driving, getting in and out of a chair or bed, and
going to the bathroom.
As symptoms progress, the challenging task for you and your doctors will be
to manage your symptoms (see Chapter 9).
After you begin taking them, antiparkinsonian medicines can be amazingly
effective. But they also have some serious and unsettling side effects. (For
more about PD meds and their side effects, check out the discussion in
Chapter 9.) Balancing the dosages and timing is a constant challenge that
becomes more difficult as you move from the moderate to the late stage. The
good news is that new medicines become available every year, medicines
that — ideally — can be more effective without the frustrating side effects.
Late stage PD: When planning 
keeps you in control
When a PWP reaches the point of serious disability (that is, unable to lead a
normal, independent life without major assistance), the medical community
describes the stage as late or advanced. At this stage even the medications that
were working so well in the earlier stages start creating problems and compli-
cations, and unless the PWP is a candidate for deep brain stimulation surgery
40
Part I: Understanding PD 

(see Chapter 10), he may face unprecedented challenges. This is the stage (for
most patients, it’s years after the initial diagnosis) when all your planning and
preparing (that we preach about throughout this book) pays off for you and
your family. In spite of advancing frailty, you are still in control. You have made
the decisions necessary to see you through this time, and your family under-
stands and accepts your wishes. You can probably guess the signs:
 Walking is possible only with a walker and for short distances, if at all.
 The entire body is stiff and rigid; balance is significantly compromised.
 The PWP can no longer manage without considerable assistance.
 Cognitive impairments worsen; physical limitations increase.
 The benefits of medication wear off earlier between each dose.
 The PWP is usually confined to bed and requires round-the-clock care
(most advanced stage).
The length of each stage is unique to each PWP. With lifestyle and medical
therapies and even with certain interventions along the way, PWP can main-
tain the early-stage status quo for several years.
A Few Words for You and 
Your Care Partner
If you’re living with someone that you suspect has PD, encourage that person
to seek a definitive diagnosis. The symptoms may or may not be PD. Many
symptoms associated with PD are also factors in illnesses and conditions that
are treatable and curable. Neither you nor the other person should jump to
conclusions, but you shouldn’t ignore the warning signs either.
If the diagnosis is PD, then your first job is to understand that this person
you love can continue to live an independent and self-reliant life for some
time, even many years.
If you’re the person’s care partner:
 Don’t assume you need to be Super-Caregiver. Resist the urge to go into
full-on nurturing mode; encourage independence and self-reliance.
 Understand that adding PD to your already busy life can lead to prob-
lems if you aren’t proactive and don’t take the necessary steps to inte-
grate your new role into the rest of your life.
 Be aware that a decline in the PWP’s self-reliance and confidence may be
a sign of depression — a common symptom of PD.
41
Chapter 3: Sizing Up Symptoms, Signs, and Stages

If you’re the PWP:
 Maintain your independence and refuse to permit PD to rob you of the
normal roles you’ve always played in all your relationships.
 Understand that depression is perfectly normal when you first hear that
you have PD; however it is not normal for such depression to be pro-
longed to the point that it actually escalates the progression of your PD
and your need for hands-on care.
For each of you, the second task is to realize (and accept) that all the medi-
cines and physician advice in the world can’t be effective unless the PWP 
follows treatment recommendations, including changes in lifestyle. Self-
management (the ability to take responsibility through changes in attitude
and behavior) is the key to living with chronic illness of any type — and vital
for living with PD. If you’re the partner, consider what changes you can make
in your own routines and habits that support and encourage the PWP to fight
this disease.
The following tips may help both of you cope in these early stages:
 Find out everything you can — from reliable and respected sources —
about PD. (See Appendix B for many of the best resources.)
 Ask questions. Chapters 4 and 5 deal specifically with the diagnosis and
the steps immediately following it.
 Take an active role in partnering with the PWP and medical profession-
als to consider treatment options and manage symptoms (See Chapter 6
for teaming up with the pros and Chapters 9, 10, and 11 for more about
treatment options.)
 Maintain emotional balance as you each cope with your fears and anxi-
eties about the meaning of this diagnosis for you and other people 
close to the PWP. (Chapter 7 offers ideas on dealing with other people.
Chapters 15 and 19 address relationship questions you may be asking.)
 Remind each other of times when the PWP faced a difficult situation and
didn’t just cope, but triumphed in handling it.
 Whether you’re the PWP or the care partner, don’t wait to get help for
obvious anxiety and depression. (Chapter 13 covers this piece of PD in
more detail.)
If the diagnosis is PD, don’t panic. You and the PWP are now members of a
unique, extraordinarily proactive, well-organized community. If you open
yourself to that community, you’ll be richer for the friends you make, the
information you exchange, and the comfort you share.

diagnosis and why you should see a specialist — a
neurologist — to develop a plan for treating your PD and
managing your symptoms. You get the basics on how to
assemble the healthcare support team you’re going to

Getting an Accurate Diagnosis
In This Chapter
 Prepping for your primary care doctor
 Partnering with a neurologist
 Understanding the diagnosis process
 Looking for a second opinion
O
kay, perhaps you’ve checked out Chapters 2 and 3 to see the causes and
risk factors of Parkinson’s disease (PD) as well as its signs and symptoms.
And maybe the more you read, the more you worried that you (or someone
you care for) may actually have it. Before you freak out, get to a doctor and find
out for sure. Your imagination about PD and its consequences is far worse than
living with it. In reality, many people with PD live relatively normal and fully
active lives for many years after diagnosis. It’s your call, but you can set this
book aside right now and go bury your head in the sand, or you can take a
measured, proactive approach to checking out those symptoms.
Ah, you’re still here — great! (Okay, so the book’s a little sandy. No problem.)
The first step is to get an accurate diagnosis of your symptoms, starting with
an accurate list of your current symptoms and medical history. Follow that
with a visit to your primary care physician (PCP), who may recommend that
you see a specialist. No doubt, you’ll be prodded and tested, but you’ll finally
have a diagnosis. Last step? You want to get that diagnosis confirmed. Ready?
Here we go.
Bringing Up the Subject 
with Your Doctor
This isn’t going to be the usual appointment with your doctor. You’re not going
for an annual check-up or some routine test. You’re making this appointment
because you have symptoms that you can’t explain and that don’t seem to be

going away. And you’re making this appointment because you’re concerned
something is seriously wrong. An appointment for these reasons needs careful
planning all along the way, from scheduling the appointment to gathering infor-
mation to preparing questions you want to ask. All of this needs to happen
before the appointment.
Scheduling an appointment
When you call your doctor’s office to schedule the appointment, ask to speak
to the doctor’s nurse or assistant. Tell that person why you’re scheduling 
the appointment. (Yes, go ahead and say it, “I’m concerned that I may have
Parkinson’s disease.”) Then add that you want an appointment when the
doctor will have more time — especially if your suspicions are correct. Also
ask the nurse what information you should bring with you. When you do make
the appointment (usually through the office manager or receptionist), only you
can weigh the possible wait (perhaps several weeks until the doctor has this
extra time) against the earliest available appointment. Note: If you choose the
latter, consider booking that later appointment as well in case you want to
follow up in more detail with the doctor. In either case, ask to be on the call list.
In the event of a cancellation, you can then get to see the doctor sooner.
Preparing for your initial exam
Before seeing your PCP, plan to take the following steps to make that first
meeting as productive as possible.
Gathering your medical records
First, be sure that your PCP has copies of all medical records. For example, 
if you’ve been seeing a cardiologist, your PCP needs copies of any lab work 
or stress test results as well as that doctor’s notes on observations and 
treatment.
As soon as you schedule the appointment with your PCP, ask the office staff
of any specialist you’re seeing to fax copies of recent lab results to your
PCP’s office. Preparing and transferring such information can take time. So, if
time is short, call the clinic where the tests were done or the doctor who
ordered the tests and ask for a copy of the results. Then you can pick up
these reports and take them with you to your appointment.
Prioritizing your symptoms
Next, make a list of your symptoms and prioritize them. For example, maybe
the following is your list of symptoms:
46
Part II: Making PD Part – But Not All – of Your Life 

 Anxious and not my usual upbeat self
 Shaky — especially in my right hand
 Unusually fatigued — no get-up-and-go
 Not sleeping well
If you suspect PD because you’ve noticed a slight tremor, you may want to
move the second bullet (shaky) to the top of your list.
Keep in mind that the doctor’s staff may interview you first. When the nurse
asks you why you came in, the first words out of your mouth get her atten-
tion. So, if you say, “I haven’t been sleeping that well,” rather than “Over the
last few weeks I’ve noticed a slight shakiness in my right hand,” the nurse
writes that your primary issue is sleep disturbance. And that statement can
take matters in a whole different direction, wasting precious time.
Your doctor refers to the first symptom as your chief complaint. When she 
follows up on your answer with some form of “What makes you suspect
Parkinson’s?” then you can offer the rest of the symptoms on your list.
For heaven’s sake, if you suspect PD, don’t be afraid to introduce it into the
conversation right away. Life — and doctor’s appointments — are too short
to beat around the bush!
Compiling your medical history
Writing down your personal medical history helps you prepare for the many
questions along the way to your diagnosis. Preparing your history in advance
also gives you time to think carefully about the specifics instead of trying to
remember details on the spot.
If you’ve seen a doctor recently, you know that the questions are usually the
same — no matter how many times you give the information. First, one or
two members of the staff gather your information, and then the nurse or
physician assistant (PA) may ask the same questions. But, with a trusty print-
out of your history, you can provide a clean copy for their file and still have 
a copy in-hand (you made two copies, right?) to prompt you on dates and
details. This step saves everyone precious time during the appointment and
spares you the frustration of recalling every detail for every question.
Don’t let this multiple quizzing frustrate you. There’s a method to the mad-
ness of three different people asking you the same question — usually some
form of “Why have you come to see the doctor?” They know that the second
or third time a patient answers that question, he may provide additional
information without even realizing it.

Chapter 4: Getting an Accurate Diagnosis

Many doctors send a questionnaire to help patients gather essential informa-
tion about themselves and their medical histories. Even if you don’t receive
such a document, be prepared for your doctor’s questions by writing down
the following information and taking it with you to your initial exam:
 Patient’s legal (full) name and maiden name
 Date of birth
 Birthplace
 Parents’ names with dates and causes of death
 Current prescribed (Rx) medications, dosing routine, and purpose (exam-
ple: diazide, 10mg 1 x day for hypertension); list each Rx separately
 Current over-the-counter (OTC) medications taken regularly, including
vitamins, supplements, and such (example: calcium + D, 600 mg 2 x day);
list each separately
 Any medications (Rx or OTC) taken over the past year but not currently
taken
 Known allergies or adverse reactions to medications or common med-
ical equipment (example: latex gloves)
 Other physicians seen regularly (example: allergist, cardiologist) —
name, address, telephone
 Current health problems and dates of onset
 Dates and circumstances of past illnesses or medical events (example:
fractured rib, heart attack, accident)
 Dates and reasons for hospitalizations
 Dates and reasons for surgeries
 Recent changes in physical health
 Recent changes in mental or emotional health
 Current situations that may contribute to health changes (consider
family, work, and other factors)
Stepping through your initial exam
Okay, you have everything in order and today’s the appointment. Take some-
one with you. If you think you have PD (and it turns out that your doctor
agrees), you’ll need that extra set of ears to hear what you’re bound to miss
after you hear that you may have a chronic and progressive condition. Most
likely, this will be your care partner if the diagnosis turns out to be PD. The
role of this person is to take notes and listen during the appointment and
then help you digest and decipher that discussion after the appointment.
48
Part II: Making PD Part – But Not All – of Your Life 

Much of what happens at the doctor’s office is already familiar to you: the
wait (complete with dog-eared selections of last year’s magazines); the weigh-
in, blood pressure and updating of your medical history; the second wait
(this time in the exam room). Use this time to go over the information and
questions you’ve prepared. The doctor’s going to ask why you think you have
PD, and you need to be prepared to offer specifics (your symptoms, when
and how often they occur, when they began, what seems to relieve them, and
so on). If you’ve made a list, you’re ready and can just review it.
The doctor may be giving you extra time for your appointment, but that’s 
not the same as endless time. You need to use the time you have wisely by
coming to the appointment as well prepared as possible. For more tips on
knowing what to expect from a diagnostic appointment and getting the most
from that appointment, see “Working with Your Neurologist to Determine
Whether This Is PD” section later in this chapter.
Leaving with the answers you need
You’ll probably have a gazillion questions by the end of the initial appoint-
ment, and you’re just as likely not to be able to think of a single one. So once
again, be prepared. Prepare a list of questions in advance and use that list.
You may even want to hand a copy to your doctor.
If you’ve brought another person with you to listen and take notes, this is the
time she may want to speak up and ask questions also. You can use the fol-
lowing sets of questions as a guide during the appointment. But feel free to
add your own.
If the diagnosis seems pretty clear from the start
Although your PCP may believe the diagnosis is clear, he most likely will
deliver the news as possibly or likely Parkinson’s and recommend you see a
neurologist (a specialist in disorders of the central nervous system). Your
PCP may talk in lingo that’s unfamiliar to you (parkinsonism, bradykinesia,
postural instability, and such). Don’t be afraid to ask for a clear, layperson’s
explanation by asking the following questions:
 What is the diagnosis — in plain English?
 What is the prognosis (how quickly will the condition progress)?
 How will the diagnosis be confirmed?
 Does this diagnosis require me to see a specialist?
 Can you recommend a specialist and help set an appointment for me?
 In the meantime, what should I do?
49
Chapter 4: Getting an Accurate Diagnosis

If the doctor orders tests
Even if your doctor believes the diagnosis is fairly clear, she may want to rule
out other possibilities. For example, some of the medications you’ve been
taking may be interacting in a way that produces a slight shaking (tremor) in
your hand. Or, maybe your primary symptom seems to be depression and
apathy; the doctor may want to refer you to a psychologist for evaluation. If
she recommends these or other tests, ask the following questions:
 What are the tests and why are you ordering them?
 What is the procedure for each test?
 How quickly will you have the results?
 What will be the next steps after you have the test results?
If the PCP recommends treatment
Especially if you live in a small community or rural area, your PCP may be the
only name in town for treating a wide variety of complex conditions. Even if
you live in a larger community that has several specialists including neurolo-
gists, your doctor may be aware that your economic situation and lack of
adequate insurance may keep you from seeking these services. In any case, if
your PCP does not recommend seeking a specialist as a next step but does
recommend a plan of treatment, ask the following questions:
 What is the treatment?
 Why are you choosing this treatment option?
 What are the risks or possible down sides of taking these medicines or
following the recommended therapies?
 What is the cost and will this be covered by my insurance?
 What are the benefits?
 How quickly should the treatment work?
 How will you monitor and follow up on the treatment plan?
 What are the alternatives to this treatment plan?
If It Looks Like PD. . . Connecting 
with a Neurologist
The initial suspicions of you and your PCP will likely lead to an appointment
with a neurologist who can administer further tests to confirm the diagnosis.
(If your PCP has already diagnosed PD, then your neurologist helps manage
50
Part II: Making PD Part – But Not All – of Your Life 

your care.) The following sections suggest how to find a specialist in your
area and how to know whether you’ll make a good team.
Locating an experienced and 
qualified neurologist
If possible, look for a neurologist who specializes in movement disorders
(like Parkinson’s). If you’re very fortunate, you live in or near a community
that has a Morris K. Udall Parkinson’s Disease Research Center of Excellence
program. These programs — often in a medical university or institution —
are involved in clinical research specifically for the benefit of PD patients.
(See the “Morris K. Udall Parkinson’s Disease Research Centers of Excellence”
sidebar for more information.)
This section suggests resources for finding a neurologist who can help you
deal with your PD — now and down the road.
Surfing the Web
The Internet can be a huge help to locate a doctor. Several sites locate physi-
cians by specialty as well as by location, and the sites provide important
information about a doctor’s training, expertise, possible ethical or treat-
ment violations, and so on. Try an online search with the phrase neurologists
finding.
You can also get information by checking with the local or regional chapter 
of a national PD organization. (See the next section and Appendix B for the
national organization’s info.) Ask whether your area has a local PD support
group. If it does, ask for the name and contact information of the group’s
facilitator. When you call the facilitator, ask whether any members of the
group have been treated by neurologists that you’re considering. If possible,
contact those patients (preferably including patients who have changed doc-
tors) and ask about their experiences with those doctors.
Checking with the local chapter of PD groups
The following organizations have chapters and support groups in communi-
ties across the country. You can call them to get names of neurologists in
your area.
 National Parkinson’s Foundation (NPF): 800-327-4545
 American Parkinson’s Disease Association (APDA): 800-223-2732
 Parkinson’s Action Network (PAN): 800-850-4726
51
Chapter 4: Getting an Accurate Diagnosis

If you live in a small community, you may have to connect with the group in a
larger community nearby (or even at the state level), but the information
from these experienced groups is invaluable as you look for a neurologist
that’s right for you.
Asking your family doctor
Your PCP may be an internist or, if you live in a small community or rural area
with limited access to medical care, he may be a general practitioner. For
some women, an Obstetrician/Gynecologist (OB/GYN) is their PCP. Whatever
your doctor’s focus, he’s probably aware of local leading doctors in various
specialties.
A key question to ask your PCP is: Which specialist do you recommend for
working in tandem with you (the PCP) and me to manage my overall health
and PD? This question is important for many reasons, but mainly because it
is enormously important that your neurologist be consulted before any other
doctor prescribes medications or treatment that may adversely affect your
PD medication routine or worsen your symptoms.
When your town has no neurologists
Speaking of small communities, what are your options if the closest neurolo-
gist is some distance away? First, consider that you’re not going to see this
specialist weekly or even monthly after the diagnosis is confirmed and you
begin routine treatment. Second, assuming the neurologist and your PCP are
willing to work together, you have the emergency back-up of your PCP if you
need immediate attention.
Don’t be tempted to just let your PCP manage your PD for the sake of convenience.
At the very least, you want to have your neurologist reevaluate your treatment
and status two to four times a year depending on how much change you expe-
rience between visits. If you have questions between appointments, try the
phone and e-mail. But, taking a day every two to three months to see the neu-
rologist — the specialist in treating your PD — is time well spent. You’re worth
every minute of it!
Evaluating your neurologist
First things first. You can’t expect a neurologist to cure you because a cure
for PD doesn’t exist — yet. But you can and should expect a professional
partnership. You and your neurologist (as well as other team members that
we introduce in Chapter 6) will work together to manage your PD symptoms
and maintain your physical, mental, and emotional health to the highest pos-
sible levels during the years ahead.

Chapter 4: Getting an Accurate Diagnosis
Morris K. Udall Parkinson’s Disease 
Research Centers of Excellence
Morris K. Udall served in the United States
Congress for 30 years and was well-respected
by colleagues on both sides of the aisle. He also
lived with Parkinson’s disease from his diagno-
sis in 1979 until his death in 1998, serving in the
House of Representatives until 1991. In 1997,
Congress passed the Morris K. Udall Parkinson’s
Disease Research Act, and President Clinton
signed it into law in 1998. This legislation con-
tributed to the establishment of 12 Parkinson’s
research centers funded by the National Institute
of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), a
division of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
As a result, the legislation cast a national spot-
light on the need for collaborative, coordinated
research efforts for new treatments and a cure
for PD.
The 12 centers are:
 Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston, MA
 Columbia University, New York, NY
 Duke University, Durham, NC
 Harvard University (McLean Hospital), Bel-
mont, MA
 Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD
 Massachusetts General Hospital (Mass-
achusetts Institute of Technology), Boston,
MA
 Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL
 Northwestern University, Evanston, IL
 University of California Los Angeles (UCLA),
Los Angeles, CA
 University of Kentucky Medical Center, Lex-
ington, KY
 University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA
 University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA
The 1997 legislation was a good start, but more
work is needed. In 2005, Congressman Lane
Evans of Illinois, who also has PD, introduced
H.R. 3550, a bill to amend and further the work
of the original legislation. The new bill would
require NIH to hold a conference to review the
progress of the work at these Centers for
Excellence every two years and produce a
strategic plan (including a budget, expected
results, actual spending, and actual results) and
a report to Congress. H.R. 3550 was referred 
to a subcommittee in August of 2005. As of this
writing, that was the last action on the bill. 
The Parkinson’s Action Network (PAN) main-
tains a watch on this bill and other legislation
critical to the fight. The Web site is www.
parkinsonsaction.org.

Along with expertise, you’re looking for a certain quality of empathy — a chem-
istry between the two of you. (See more discussion on this relationship in the
next section.) You don’t want a godlike figure that makes decisions for you
rather than with you. After all, who has to live with this PD? Not the neurologist.
Preparing for that first visit
Use the following checklist as you prepare for meeting the neurologist:
 When you make the appointment, ask for the first or last appointment of
the day. This choice should assure additional time for questions.
 Make sure your PCP has sent copies of your records to the neurologist’s
office. Assuming that it was your PCP who referred you to the specialist,
you may think that the records are transferred automatically. Guess
again. You need to stay on top of this transfer and follow up with both
offices to make sure the transfer actually takes place.
 Take a copy of your personal medical history and the results of any
recent lab work with you. (Refer back to the section “Preparing for your
initial exam” earlier in this chapter for more about the history.)
 Be sure to update that history to include your medications with the
strength and dosage routine (or pack up the actual meds in a plastic 
bag — seriously!). Also list any vitamins, supplements, or other OTC
meds you take on a regular basis.
 A few days prior to the appointment, call the office to confirm the
appointment and ask whether they’ve received your records. If they
haven’t, follow up with your PCP. You may need to pick up copies of the
records and take them with you to the appointment.
 Arrive half an hour before your scheduled appointment so you can com-
plete their paperwork without cutting into your time with the doctor.
Interviewing the good doctor
Everyone wants the best neurologist out there. But, because of PD’s chronic
and progressive nature, you also need a neurologist who’s a good fit for you
and your care partner. Start with the basic nuts and bolts. The following list
contains the most essential factors you need consider:
 Of course the neurologist has a medical degree, but is he board-certified
(has he completed and passed nationally recognized exams to test his
expertise)? If he has special training in movement disorders (PD is one),
count yourself ahead of the game.
 What professional organizations and societies does he belong to?
54
Part II: Making PD Part – But Not All – of Your Life 

 How many people with Parkinson’s (PWP) are currently under his care?
 How long has the doctor been treating PWP? (If the good doctor is a
good older doctor, how long does he anticipate practicing?) If the doctor
is relatively young, check background and experience. Has this person
worked with more experienced PD specialists?
 Who are the partners in his practice, and what are their backgrounds?
No partners? Where does he send patients when he’s unavailable?
 What days and hours does he see patients? (If the doctor is well known
and sought after but has really limited office hours, that situation may
send up a red flag for getting appointments when you need them.)
 Are the office hours and location convenient for you? If not, is that a deal
breaker for you? Keep in mind that in the early stages of your PD (see
Chapter 3) you’ll probably see your neurologist infrequently, perhaps
every six to eight weeks. If the distance and schedule still seem inconve-
nient, you can look elsewhere, but please try not to sacrifice experience
and skill for convenience.
 If the doctor orders lab work, does his office provide the service? If not,
is the office part of a hospital-physician complex where labs are easily
available? If the answer is “No” to both questions, you’ll most likely go 
to your area hospital or walk-in clinic for the lab work.
 What’s the cost of an office visit?
 If you need to consult with him by phone, does he charge you for it?
 Does he accept your insurance? If you’re on Medicare, does he accept
assignment (charge only what Medicare assigns as the cost)? See Chap-
ter 20 for more help on those sticky insurance questions.
Reviewing your first impressions
Okay, the neurologist passes your basic tests. Now for the tough part: How
well will the two of you work together? First impressions can say a great deal,
so pay attention to details like the following:
 Does the doctor seem rushed or distracted when she meets you?
 Does she listen and ask questions that draw out additional informa-
tion, or does she cut you off making pronouncements rather than 
recommendations?
 What is her treatment philosophy on PD? Medication right away?
Medication only after symptoms start to interfere with life routines?
What about the use of new or proven surgical procedures?
The right answer, of course, includes a reminder that all patients
progress differently and under varying circumstances, so the treatment
regimen varies person to person.
55
Chapter 4: Getting an Accurate Diagnosis

 What is the doctor’s philosophy about partnering with the patient 
(and eventually, when your care partner becomes your advocate and
spokesperson, with the care partner)?
 Is there chemistry (we’re not talking magic here, just good vibes)? Do
you feel an intangible connection — where you can rely on this doctor’s
partnership to explore ways to manage symptoms and maintain func-
tionality as long as possible?
Moving forward if it’s a good fit
Finally, if this doctor seems a good fit, you have just a few more questions to
ask him:
 How does the doctor prefer that you prepare for an appointment? For
example, does he want you to e-mail questions or concerns in advance,
or can you bring written questions to the appointment? Can you bring a
tape recorder to tape the conversation so you can listen to it again?
 What is his preferred way of communicating with you between appoint-
ments: by phone or e-mail; through his nurse or physician assistant? (If
you’re to contact the nurse or physician assistant, be sure you meet this
person and get direct contact information.)
 What hospital does the doctor use for treating patients?
And what if, after all of this, the doctor just isn’t for you? No chemistry. Of
course, you can move on and start the whole process with another doctor. On
the other hand, if this doctor is considered the best in your area, perhaps you
should give the relationship a chance. After all, the two of you are relative
strangers. How well did you click with other professionals in your life on the
first appointment? Keep in mind that this is first and foremost a professional
relationship; you will rely on this expert to plot the course you’ll navigate
through the challenges of PD. This doctor may not be especially interested in
seeing pictures of your first grandchild, but if the treatment plan he puts
together clearly focuses on your individual journey through PD and helps you
enjoy that grandchild for years to come, do you really need anything more?
Working with Your Neurologist to
Determine Whether This Is PD
Neurologists use a variety of methods to make a definitive diagnosis of PD:
 The physical examination
56
Part II: Making PD Part – But Not All – of Your Life 

 An assessment of your function through mental and performance testing
 Sophisticated imaging equipment that permits a look inside your brain
Despite all these methods, your doctor may still need to rule out other expla-
nations for your symptoms before she’s prepared to state, without question,
that you have PD. 
This section takes you through the usual steps of that first visit.
Navigating the clinical exam
No single diagnostic test (like doctors have for measuring blood pressure or
cholesterol levels) can confirm a clinical diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease. So
your neurologist’s skill of observation and his experience in diagnosing and
treating PWP is key. Your initial appointment will probably include the follow-
ing three levels of examination:
History taking
The first level of examination is a discussion of your complete medical his-
tory. The printed copy you provide (see “Compiling your medical history”
earlier in this chapter for help with this step) can help, but you’ll probably
hear some questions two or three times in this first appointment. Be a patient
patient (pun intended). A good neurologist asks these questions not only to
review your symptoms but also to rule out less-typical types of parkinsonism
or other neurological conditions, which sometimes entail radically different
management. (See “Parkinsonism, But Not PD” later in this chapter.)
Physical exam
After recording your medical history, the doctor performs a physical exami-
nation that may include such standards as:
 Measuring your blood pressure (while you’re lying down and then again
standing up)
 Checking your pulses, heartbeat, lungs, and abdomen
The point of such routine observations is to make sure your symptoms aren’t
due to problems in other parts of your body.
Neurological exam
The final level is the neurological examination, which is largely a process 
of observation. The neurologist tests your coordination and balance while
observing you walk, stand, sit, turn, extend your arms and hands, and so on.
57
Chapter 4: Getting an Accurate Diagnosis

This exam may also include any of the following tasks:
 Opening and closing your fists or tapping your fingers several times
 Touching the doctor’s finger and then your nose with your index finger
(it looks silly but can give the neurologist a wealth of information)
 Recovering your balance after the doctor pulls you gently from behind
your shoulders as you stand with your eyes open or closed
 Answering several simple questions from the doctor to test your atten-
tion and memory
 Drawing a figure on a piece of paper and then duplicating it
Don’t be surprised by the apparent simplicity of these questions and tests;
they are all part of a standardized exam!
After the neurologist has completed the initial interview, the physical exam
and neurological observations, he (or an assistant) may use standard screen-
ing tools to further confirm the diagnosis or the stage or severity of your PD.
This next section covers those tools.
Establishing the severity and staging 
the progression of your PD
Your neurologist may use a variety of tools for establishing your PD’s progres-
sion through the various stages or levels. (See Chapter 3 for more about these
stages.) The rating scales in the next section are useful in setting a benchmark
for the doctor. Neuroimaging tools are also helpful in tracking progression and
ruling out other possibilities for symptoms you may experience.
Rating scales and neuroimaging tests are tools available to your doctor to
assist in establishing the progression of your PDC. They aren’t used in con-
firming the diagnosis.
Rating scales
In any major disorder like PD, neurologists may use standardized rating
scales to measure symptoms and stage the disease. (For a refresher on stag-
ing, flip over to Chapter 3.) These instruments are helpful in determining how
advanced your symptoms are and how best to address them. The scales also
form the basis for a more extensive medical history if a patient needs to
change doctors in the future. In addition, clinical researchers frequently use
these scales to monitor the effects of new and experimental therapies on
patients. (See Chapter 14, where we discuss the trials more completely.)
58
Part II: Making PD Part – But Not All – of Your Life 

 Hoehn and Yahr Rating Scale: This diagnostic tool stages the level of a
person’s PD by using broad measures of disability. This scale was origi-
nally devised by Melvin Yahr and Margaret Hoehn following a detailed
study of the natural progression of PD in the late 1960s. They observed
five general stages in PD, ranging from Stage 1 (unilateral disease, lim-
ited to one side of the body) to Stage 5 (wheelchair bound or bedridden
unless aided). However, as we mention often in this book, PD doesn’t
progress in neat, little, predictable stages. Therefore, the more complex
(and more informative) Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (see the
next section) usually accompanies and complements this tool.
 Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS): The UPDRS focuses
on several facets of PD’s disability, such as its effects on daily activities,
motor skills, and mental capacity (including behavior and mood). It con-
sists of a painless interview and a focused neurological exam, with a
score for each item from 0 (normal) to 4 (severe). Therefore, the higher
the UPDRS score, the greater the disability from PD.
The UPDRS — when administered correctly — is “an exquisitely sensi-
tive test for detecting early PD,” according to a Parkinson’s Disease
Foundation article. It may be the best tool for the neurologist to assess
symptom levels and design treatment plans. The UPDRS is currently
under revision by the Movement Disorders Society and will be soon
updated to better reflect the multifaceted reality of PD disability.
 Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living: This tool rates a
person’s ability to perform the normal routine activities of daily living
using a percentage rating. The patient usually rates himself with the help
of set definitions presented by the doctor.
For example, people who consider themselves to be completely inde-
pendent and functional qualify for a 100 percent rating. They can per-
form all activities without difficulty. In contrast, a person who takes
three to four times the normal time to perform a task (such as dressing)
has a 70 percent independence rating. And a person who can manage
only a few chores from time to time (and always with great effort) has 
a 30 percent rating.
Neuroimaging
A thorough neurological exam and the proper administration of the UPDRS is
usually enough to diagnose a new case of PD. However, neuroimaging tech-
niques now permit neurologists to pinpoint the diagnosis of PD and follow its
progression by observing the affected nerve cells.
Two recently developed imaging techniques, positron-emission tomography
and single photon emission computed tomography, can confirm the diag-
nosis of PD and distinguish PD from other Parkinson-like disorders. (See
“Parkinsonism, But Not PD” later in this chapter for more discussion on other
disorders.) Both scans use low levels of radioactive materials and pose little,
if any, risk for the patient. I describe both of these scans in the following:
59
Chapter 4: Getting an Accurate Diagnosis

 The positron-emission tomography (PET) scan uses a radioactive form of
levodopa (the drug that enhances dopamine production in the brain),
which is injected intravenously into the patient, to highlight the loss of
normal dopamine cells (the neurons primarily affected by PD ) in the
brain. As dopamine cells uptake levodopa, a reduced signal from labeled
(radioactive) levodopa is usually found in PD.
 The single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scan is another
imaging technique able to measure metabolic and physiological functions
of specific areas of the brain. When using radioactive markers able to link
to dopamine cells, SPECT scans can measure the progressive loss of these
neurons caused by PD.
A couple of factors limit the use of neuroimaging: cost and availability. At this
writing, some insurance companies consider such scans experimental and as
a result, don’t cover any of the costs. In addition, the equipment and exper-
tise for performing and interpreting the scans aren’t widely available.
Ruling out the red herrings: 
What else can it be?
What else looks like PD? That answer may depend on your presenting symp-
toms (the information you tell the doctor) or on other facts that the doctor
gathers through interviewing and examining you.
For example:
 If you don’t present with any of the TRAP symptoms (check out Chapter 3
for a quick review of these) but you talk about a loss of energy, the doctor
may want to explore that symptom more. After further questioning, your
doctor may see that depression plays a role in your loss of energy. If so,
is the depression associated with PD, or is it related to some other life-
changing event, such as the death of a loved one or the loss of a job?
 Even if a hand tremor was your reason for seeing a neurologist, is the
tremor confined to one hand or both? Does it stop after the hand is
engaged in activity, or does the tremor continue?
Don’t try to second-guess your symptoms. Is it PD? Maybe. Is it something
else — something easier to treat and cure? Possibly. Either way, you need to
know. Why postpone treating a curable condition simply because you think it
may be more serious? And if it does turn out to be PD, then you want to get a
jump on managing symptoms as early as possible — when you have the
greatest opportunity to maintain independence and flexibility.
60
Part II: Making PD Part – But Not All – of Your Life 

Parkinsonism, But Not PD
If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it’s a duck, right? So if it looks
like PD and acts likes PD, then it’s PD, right? Not always.
The same symptoms that indicate PD can also indicate other conditions, thus
parkinsonism is a generic term referring to slowness and mobility problems
that look like PD. Parkinsonism is a feature in several conditions that have
different (and perhaps known) causes, but those conditions don’t progress
like PD. As a result, years may go by before the differences between PD and
the other disorder are apparent; the PD diagnosis may then be reversed.
Taking antiparkinsonian medications (such as levodopa) may be the first
indicator that parkinsonism isn’t actually PD. By definition, PD promptly
responds to this medication, which improves its symptoms in a consistent
way, at least for a few years. But, in parkinsonism, improvement is often
erratic or nonexistent from the beginning. In fact, your neurologist will
always closely monitor your response to treatment in order to rule out the
possibility that your condition is a disorder other than PD.
Two categories of non-PD disorders are:
 Parkinson’s Plus syndromes: This group of neurodegenerative disor-
ders has parkinsonian features, such as bradykinesia (slowness), rigidity
(stiffness), tremor (shaking), and gait disturbances (balance). See Chap-
ter 3 for more about these PD symptoms. However, they are also associ-
ated with other complex neurological symptoms that reflect problems in
brain areas other than the dopaminergic system (the network of neurons
able to make and release the neurotransmitter dopamine). These condi-
tions progress more rapidly than PD and don’t respond as well (or at all)
to antiparkinsonian medications. The most common Parkinson’s Plus
syndromes are Multiple System Atrophy (MSA), Progressive Supranuclear
Palsy (PSP), Cortico-Basal Ganglionic Degeneration (CBGD), and Lewy
Body Dementia (LBD).
 Secondary parkinsonisms: The symptoms of these disorders relate to
well-defined lesions in the brain from strokes, tumors, infections, traumas,
or certain drugs. Like Parkinson’s Plus syndromes, these syndromes are
usually less responsive to levodopa. However, if the primary cause of
parkinsonism is controlled, these symptoms tend to be less progressive.
In addition to Parkinson’s plus and secondary parkinsonisms, Essential
Tremor (ET) is another source of possible confusion. As the most common
movement disorder — as much as 20 times more common than PD — ET’s
only symptom is a tremor that affects the hands (only while they’re moving)
61
Chapter 4: Getting an Accurate Diagnosis

but may also affect the head or voice. ET can run in families and is usually
benign and non-disabling. The much-admired actress, Katherine Hepburn,
may have suffered from ET — not PD.
This Is Your Life — Getting a Second 
(or Even Third) Opinion
Whatever the diagnosis, if you have concerns, questions, or doubts, then you
have every reason to get a second or even a third opinion. After all, you know
your body and its symptoms better than anyone else. So if you live within a
reasonable distance of a Udall Center (see the sidebar “Morris K. Udall
Parkinson’s Disease Research Centers of Excellence” earlier in this chapter) 
or a medical center with a reputation for excellent PD care and research, see
whether you can get an appointment and check out what those folks say. Even
if you have to travel some distance, the information will be worth the trip.
Another reason to seek a second or third opinion is to find a neurologist you
have chemistry with. The doctor who delivered the initial diagnosis may be a
fine neurologist with great credentials and experience, but maybe the two of
you had no connection and you don’t see a partnership with her. With PD,
you don’t want to be switching from one doctor to another. So, find a doctor
that you can build a real partnership with now — one with a proactive and
optimistic philosophy about meeting the challenges of living with PD.
The danger lies in seeking one opinion after another just because you didn’t
like the first (or second or third) answer — even though, in your heart-of-
hearts, you’re sure it’s true. That’s called denial. Because you may not want
to face the future, you keep running after more opinions, hoping some day
some doctor will say you don’t have PD.
After a doctor has confirmed the diagnosis (and perhaps another doctor has
reconfirmed it), you need to accept it and prepare yourself and your family
for the journey. Maybe you’ve already made significant progress by finding a
neurologist that you and your PCP can partner with to maintain and manage
your health for the long term.

Chapter 5
You’ve Been Diagnosed — 
Now What?
In This Chapter
 Facing your fears about Parkinson’s disease
 Establishing your long-term vision and short-term goals
 Caring for the future: Advice for your partner
O
kay, it’s official — you have Parkinson’s disease (PD). In these first days
following that blow, no doubt your emotions are rocketing. And like a
pinball, they’re bouncing moment to moment and hour to hour around those
Five Stages of Grief that Elisabeth Kubler-Ross introduced:
 Can’t be (denial)
 Shouldn’t be (anger)
 Don’t let it be (bargaining)
 Why me? (depression)
 IS! (acceptance or at least realization)
A sixth stage to consider in facing a diagnosis of PD is hope. You can find
some measure of control as you continue toward the future you had already
planned — one that did not include living with a chronic and progressive 
illness.
And that’s the purpose of this chapter — to help you move beyond those first
jumbled emotions of diagnosis toward a clearly focused, take-charge attitude
of this disease. In this chapter we first talk you through the emotional steps
and then guide you toward healthy goals and plans for coming to grips with
PD. We also address your care partner, the one who plans to walk that walk
with you, and offer advice for these early months after the diagnosis.

Sorting Out Your Emotions
Depending on your past awareness or experiences with PD, either you have
some idea of how your life is going to change or you have no idea at all. In
either case, your imagination can get carried away with all the what-ifs.
Stop! This is a new challenge, but it’s not so different from other challenges
that have taken your life in unexpected directions. Every day people face
unplanned events that change the course they thought they were on — job
losses, break-ups in relationships, unplanned moves to different locations,
the loss of a loved one, hurricanes, and floods. Life happens.
Take a breath. Any challenges that you faced (and survived) in the past (like
raising your children, building your career, caring for aging parents, and
such) gave you key building blocks and tools to face this new challenge.
Now, give yourself time to:
 Understand that a PD diagnosis is not a death sentence. You have a life
to live and choices to make about how you’ll face each day, probably for
years and even decades to come.
 Believe that past experiences have given you the tools you need to cope
with PD.
 Accept the difference between what you can and can’t control. Focus on
what you can.
 Connect with people who are positive and upbeat.
 Banish negative self-talk (“I can’t,” or “I won’t,” and such), and turn the
negative to a positive (“I can” and “I will”).
 Embrace the joys in your life — your partner, children, friends, work or
avocation, love of music, art, sports, and so on.
 Help yourself by helping other people — volunteer, get involved, make a
difference.
 Recognize the opportunities you have to educate others, advocate for
change (and a cure), make new friends, and know your deeper self.
Basically you have two choices: Define your life as a person with Parkinson’s
(PWP) or live that life to the fullest — the same as if you’d never been diag-
nosed with PD.
64
Part II: Making PD Part – But Not All – of Your Life 

Dodging denial and meeting 
your diagnosis head on
When you get the confirmed diagnosis, you and your family — especially
your partner — need time to digest the news and react. And the first reaction
for one or both of you may be denial. Your partner may become overprotec-
tive and treat you as if you’re gravely ill. Financial concerns may pop up; your
partner may wonder about the costs and sacrifices. Underneath your partner
may first feel cheated out of the life you had planned and then angry at such
a selfish thought when you’re facing a debilitating illness. (For more help in
dealing with such difficult feelings, see Chapter 22.)
Neither you nor your partner may admit any of these feelings initially. Big
mistake. Your fastest route to coping is to work through such feelings
together by openly communicating your fears and concerns and then work-
ing through possible solutions to each. Following the guidelines set forth in
the remainder of this chapter can help.
Denial can take two forms. First, many people who receive the diagnosis of
PD — or any other serious illness — soon realize that the early symptoms
have been there. Perhaps you dismissed those early warning signs for weeks
or even months because you were afraid or didn’t want other people to know
you had some troublesome symptoms.
The second form of denial comes after you’ve received the diagnosis. Now
the facts are out there. You’re human, and no doubt the actual news that you
have PD has come as a real blow. Initially refusing to believe this is happening
is your mind’s way of giving you time to gather the necessary strength to go
forward.
However, sustaining that denial takes an enormous amount of energy —
energy that can be much more valuable in facing the actual challenge.
Refusing to acknowledge the truth means you’re forcing yourself to keep a
secret from other people and yourself.
In spite of your denial, deep inside you know this diagnosis is real. You may
even be surprised to realize you have a slight feeling of relief because the
enemy has a name, and now you can begin to fight it. You can’t go back and
not have PD. But you can decide how best to move forward.
Allowing yourself to get angry
Anger is an understandable reaction to news like this. The question is: Who’s
on the receiving end of that anger? The world in general? Your friends and
65
Chapter 5: You’ve Been Diagnosed — Now What?

family who’ve never taken care of themselves like you always have? Your sig-
nificant other (who you fear — in your current, warped state of mind — may
leave you)? God? How about yourself?
Go ahead — rant, rave, and howl at the moon. A little healthy anger is good
for you, and certainly you deserve to indulge that anger — within reason. Try
these tips for giving anger your best shot:
 Keep the focus on the object of your anger — having PD. It’s easier than
you may suspect to broaden that focus until suddenly everything and
everyone makes you mad.
 Start figuring out ways you’re going to get back at this enemy that’s
attacked your perfectly good life (the same way you’d think of ways to
get back at the boss who passed you over for that promotion). For exam-
ple, you can say to your Parkinson’s, “I’ll show you that I can still lead
my life in spite of the challenges you throw my way!”
 Set limits. When you’re overwhelmed by your fury at the unfairness of
this diagnosis, set a kitchen timer for 10 minutes. When the bell dings,
you’re done — at least for today.
 Find the humor — black though it may be — in this unexpected and
unwanted situation and defuse your anger with that humor.
Anger (like denial and a bunch of other normal reactions to news of a chronic,
progressive illness) is non-productive unless it leads you to fight back. Permit
yourself some time to work your way through this news. (For some people,
this will be a matter of days; for others it’s a couple of weeks.) If the feelings
continue longer than that, you need to get some help to resolve the anger.
Throughout the course of your PD, you’re going to be upset and angry from
time to time. Your goal is not to dwell in that anger but to transform its
energy into determination to regain control and move forward.
Admitting you’re scared
Chances are good that you still don’t have a handle on the full impact of this
diagnosis. Getting your head around the concept of a lifelong, progressive ill-
ness is a pretty tall order, especially in the beginning. It’s enough to scare the
bejeebers out of anyone! You have so many questions and fears. How do you
deal with them?
There’s no shame in admitting you’re scared. The title song from the musical
Cabaret says, “Start by admitting from cradle to grave, it isn’t that long a
stay.” In other words, life is what we get — no promises and no guarantees.
The unknown can be intriguing, exhilarating, or frightening. And certainly,
66
Part II: Making PD Part – But Not All – of Your Life 

when that unknown is PD, you may find yourself even feeding that fear
through your responses to it.
Instead of further terrifying yourself by reading every case study, article, or
book you can get your hands on about PD, place limits on how much informa-
tion you need and can handle — especially at the beginning. Instead of smil-
ing politely as some well-meaning clerk or neighbor relates his horror story
about a fifth-cousin-twice-removed who had PD back in the dark ages, thank
him for his concern and leave. Instead of allowing other people to educate
you based on hearsay, observations from afar, and an article they read about
former Attorney General Janet Reno, educate yourself.
Using the reputable and frequently updated resources listed in Appendix B,
you can gather the information you need to become the true expert on what
is and isn’t possible with PD. Then, when people start telling you about your
condition and how to manage your life, quietly but firmly correct them. Trust
us; nothing silences a know-it-all like someone who really does know. And
nothing helps you get a handle on that gut-wrenching fear like educating
yourself on the realities, possibilities, and opportunities for expanding your
life — of living with PD.
Getting to acceptance
No one is denying that you need to work through a whole range of emotions,
but you can’t stay locked in those emotional prisons. When you move
through them, you free yourself to fully live your days.
You have a chronic and progressive illness, but
 You have years ahead of you.
 You’re still productive.
 You have time to pursue dreams and goals.
 You can live life on your terms if you accommodate PD as part of that
life, not all of it.
How to go about that? Start with these key steps:
 Get the best treatment you can after you have the diagnosis. Part III of
this book is all about treatment options, some that you may find surpris-
ingly easy to incorporate into your life.
 Deal with the emotional roller coaster of living with a chronic progres-
sive illness. Chapters 13 and 22 offer tips on facing the depression, anxi-
ety, and other difficult feelings that are part and parcel of living with any
chronic progressive conditions.
67
Chapter 5: You’ve Been Diagnosed — Now What?

 Manage your inevitable lifestyle changes and social adjustments with
family and friends (and theirs with you). Check out Chapter 7 for tips on
who, how, and when to tell about your PD; then look at Chapter 15 for
more in-depth advice on maintaining key relationships.
 Protect your unique sense of self-worth and identity. Well, we could just
remind you to read this whole book because our key message in every
chapter is that you can live with this condition. In fact, you can have a
full and satisfying life —it just won’t be the life you thought you were
going to have (but isn’t that true for most people?).
Sometimes acceptance comes most easily when you turn your attention to
the people who love you and have heard your diagnosis. They’re wrestling
with high anxiety too. Of course, their first concern is for you, but a part of
that concern is PD’s effect on their relationship with you. How will their lives
change with yours? When you acknowledge their fears (as well as your own)
and explore that with them, you create an environment of “we’re in this thing
together” that goes a long way toward sustaining everyone when times get
tough. (Tips for ways you can best communicate with other people are in
Chapters 7 and 15.)
By taking the lead in figuring out how to live with PD, in many ways you
become a mentor. You’re the person others look to and trust to show the best
way to face this life-changing situation. For many of us, actor Christopher
Reeve and his wife, Dana, were the poster couple for finding grace in the face
of unspeakable adversity. Think about it: If you built your career as Superman
and ended up unable to move much less leap over tall buildings, wouldn’t
you be tempted to feel sorry for yourself? Instead Christopher Reeve found
the will and the courage to use his adversity to inspire and motivate people
and make a real difference in the world. 
No one expects you to become a national icon now that you have PD. But you
can become that mentor for people closest to you. Through your attitude and
approach, you can set the tone for the way others interact with you and
incorporate PD into the relationship.
Taking charge and moving forward
Prepare but don’t project needs to be your mantra. The temptation to look
ahead and worry about the future can be overwhelming. Our advice: Fight
that instinct! Given a diagnosis of a chronic and progressive disease that has
no cure, a person’s natural tendency is to try and foretell the future. Major
mistake!
68
Part II: Making PD Part – But Not All – of Your Life 

With PD, every patient’s journey is unique, so projecting what may happen
can only increase your anxiety. You and your care partner can go crazy,
racing around and trying to cover all your possible challenges even before
they develop.
The point is that you have a disease that will require — like most health con-
ditions — changes to your lifestyle. For example,
 What will you do if you can no longer manage the stairs in your current
home, but the bedrooms (and the main bathroom) are all upstairs?
In Chapter 21, we explore many options for staying in your current resi-
dence in spite of obstacles such as this. For example, you may have a
room on the first floor that you can adapt as a bedroom; maybe you can
convert a half-bath into a full bathroom (with the addition of a shower);
or your stairway may be wide enough to accommodate an electric 
chair lift.
 As your ability to move decreases, how will you handle an emergency
such as getting out of the house in the event of a fire?
Even if you didn’t have PD, common sense should move every family to
have an emergency plan in place. So sit down with the family and figure
this one out — for you and everyone else in the household. One solution
is to talk to people at your local fire and police department and get their
suggestions.
Our guess is that throughout your life (and certainly as an adult) you’ve
planned for the possibility of unexpected changes or events. And even
though those plans may come in a year or not at all, you’ve still considered
the options and are prepared to act.
Taking Action
Think of PD as a 400-pound lineman constantly in your face. He’s there when
you wake up and when you go to sleep. He gets in your way, blocking you
when you try to work or play and when your friends come around. Some-
times he’s well-behaved, maybe even sitting on the sidelines for a while. But
mostly he’s charging, blocking, and even tackling to keep you from doing
what you want.
How do you get around this lineman? The answer is that sometimes you
won’t. But other times — most of the time —you can find new and innovative
ways to live life on your terms. Managing a chronic illness means you need to
69
Chapter 5: You’ve Been Diagnosed — Now What?

give up control over some parts of your life and take control in new ways.
Some of those new controls are:
 Educating yourself and your family about your PD
 Developing a long-range strategy for managing your PD
 Turning negatives into positives through creative problem-solving
 Being a real team player — with your healthcare team (see Chapter 6),
your care partners, and other PWP
Arming yourself with good information
The key to gathering information is making sure it’s trustworthy and evidence-
based. The Agency for Healthcare and Research (an agency within the
Department of Health and Human Services) recommends these resources:
 healthfinder (www.healthfinder.gov) is sponsored by the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services. The site includes links to gov-
ernment agencies, clearinghouses, non-profit groups, and universities.
 Health Information Resource Database (www.health.gov/nhic/
#Referrals or 800-336-4797) is sponsored by the National Health
Information Center. This site offers information on more than 1000 
organizations and government agencies that provide health information
on request.
 MEDLINEplus (www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus) is sponsored by the
National Institutes of Health (NIH). The site has extensive information
from NIH and other trusted resources on more than 650 diseases and
conditions.
 Non-profit organizations such as the National Parkinson’s Foundation
and The Michael J. Fox Foundation focus specifically on PD. For a com-
plete list and contact information, see Appendix B.
In addition, try checking with medical libraries in your area (but keep in mind
that this information is for physicians, medical students, and researchers —
the reading can get fairly technical).
Ignore information from
 Product advertisements that
• Make extraordinary claims, such as scientific breakthrough or secret
formula.
• Claim to work for a number of different conditions.
70
Part II: Making PD Part – But Not All – of Your Life 

• Claim the product is available from only one source or for a limited
time.
 Well-meaning friends who have
• Heard of some therapy but can’t recall the source.
• Had a relative who tried x-treatment. It worked for that person, so
it’s bound to work for you!
 Well-meaning strangers who, in their zeal to show sympathy for your
condition, rattle off several ideas about treatment.
Jotting down the questions you have
Chances are good that you were pretty numb as you sat in the doctor’s office
and received the news. (See Chapter 4, where we cover the initial visit with
the neurologist.) But now you realize you have all sorts of questions. Or per-
haps you asked questions at the time and your doctor offered information,
but you really didn’t take it in.
Schedule a second appointment (if you haven’t already) and let your doctor
(or the nurse) know that you want to be able to ask questions and discuss
issues that have come to mind since the diagnosis. At that appointment,
bring your list of questions (as well as your care partner for that second set
of ears) and be ready to take notes. The following questions are a sampling 
of some concerns you may want to cover.
 What’s the technical name of my condition, and what does that mean in
plain English?
 What’s the prognosis, my outlook for the future?
 How soon do I need to make a decision about treatment?
 Will I need additional tests? If so, what kind and when?
 What are my treatment options, and what are the pros and cons of those
treatment options?
 What changes will I need to make in my daily life?
 What resources and organizations do you recommend for support and
information?
 What resources can your office provide (books, pamphlets, audio or
videotapes, and such) that I can review right away?
 And, the question uppermost in your mind: Am I going to die from this?
71
Chapter 5: You’ve Been Diagnosed — Now What?

Establishing realistic and attainable goals
If PD is to be part of your life but not your entire life, then you need a game
plan. Fact: If you don’t have a plan for dealing with PD, then it will dominate
every facet of your life. This section takes you through specific steps toward
making and living that plan.
In the world of business, executive teams meet regularly. Their purpose? To
plan for the future success of their business. Their process usually follows a
three-step course:
1. Establish a long-term vision.
2. Set short-term goals toward achieving that vision.
3. Identify and prioritize tasks necessary to attain those goals. (This is
known as the Plan of Action, or POA.)
To apply these three steps to PD, the first step (the vision) is already estab-
lished: to live a productive and satisfying life for as long as possible in spite
of PD.
The second step (setting goals) requires you to set aside sentimentality. As
much as people wish otherwise, PD (as of this writing) has no cure. So, a goal
of being cured is neither realistic nor attainable. As you consider your real
goals, remember the following principles:
 Keep them simple.
 Keep them practical.
 Keep them specific.
The third step is the POA. Did you ever see a milk stool, the three-legged vari-
ety farmers sat on to milk cows? That three-legged approach is the way you
need to think about your POA over the long term because living with PD is
not only a physical challenge; it’s also a mental and emotional one. And, just
like the milk stool, if one leg is missing, the plan will topple.
The following sections provide examples of three goals and their POAs that
support a long-term vision for PD.
Goal 1: Maintain maximum physical function
PD has no magic pill. So, after confirming your diagnosis, your neurologist
will probably have a number of recommendations that may include manage-
ment of symptoms with proven medications, physical and occupational ther-
apy, and perhaps a program for diet and exercise.
72
Part II: Making PD Part – But Not All – of Your Life 

Although medications and traditional medical interventions may help mini-
mize your symptoms, you enhance your opportunity to achieve your long-
term vision when you maintain your best physical condition. On the other
hand, if you ignore the doctor’s prescription for changes in your lifestyle
(such as adjustments to your diet and activity routines or a specific timetable
for taking your medications), you compromise your overall vision. (See
Chapter 9 for more about the importance of sticking to your medication
schedule and Chapter 12 for a full discussion of exercise and nutrition.)
No one has all of the symptoms. Although PD is a chronic, progressive con-
dition, its path varies tremendously from one person to the next. You are
unique — as a person and as a PWP. You and your medical team need to keep
that in mind as together you select those options (medications, therapies,
and lifestyle changes) that have the greatest effect on maintaining your physi-
cal function for as long as possible.
Goal 2: Keep your mind sharp
You’re certainly going to have a lot on your mind in the days and weeks to
come as you and your medical team put together a viable plan for managing
your PD symptoms. And you’re going to hear a lot of new words — words
that PD specialists, PWPs, and their care partners throw around as easily as
apple or orange.
You can refuse to follow that technical PD jargon (and everything else about
this intruder), or you can become an expert, someone who actively seeks out
background information about PD, understands and uses the technical lingo,
and keeps up with the research and new treatment options.
This advice doesn’t mean PD has to become your life’s work. You have more
important (and fun!) ways to spend your time. But remember: Knowledge is
power, and seeking out that knowledge exercises your brain. Get started
using the resources listed in Appendix B. Getting a grip on PD (what it is and
isn’t) is a good place to start — but don’t stop there.
What are your interests and how did you challenge your mind before you had
PD? Are you a sports enthusiast who enjoys statistics and box scores? Do
you enjoy brainteasers, like crossword puzzles, jigsaw puzzles, or word
games? Do you love good music, art, and theater?
Continuing to engage your mind in enjoyable ways is as important to your
POA as pushing yourself physically. Don’t turn your back on the intellectual
life you enjoyed before PD.
73
Chapter 5: You’ve Been Diagnosed — Now What?

Goal 3: Embrace the power of emotional and spiritual well-being
Going through a range of emotions post-diagnosis is normal. But anxiety and
depression can be viable symptoms of PD as well as viable responses to its
diagnosis. Your doctor needs to know if you’re experiencing persistent
(longer than a couple of weeks) sadness or apathy. (See Chapter 14 for a full
discussion of the effects of anxiety and depression in PD.)
Although your neurologist or primary care physician (in consultation with
each other) can prescribe medication and professional counseling to help
you through these negative emotions, you can also be proactive by
 Acknowledging that these persistent negative feelings are abnormal.
 Finding a support group where you can discuss feelings with other
people who
Perhaps have similar emotions.
Recognize these emotions as part of the adaptive process in deal-
ing with PD.
 Accepting the support of family and friends as you come to terms with
PD and its effects on all your lives.
In concert with your medical team, you can address physical, mental, and
even emotional needs as part of your POA. However, one facet of your care
plan only you can develop is a plan for your spiritual health. This facet goes
beyond faith and religious rituals, although those resources certainly help.
Spiritual health means going inside yourself and coming to terms with your
illness day by day. For some PWP, coping comes through challenging activi-
ties: participating in sports, continuing to pursue a career, traveling, and so
on. If these challenges help you find inner peace and comfort, great!
Other PWP may find spiritual healing in quieter pursuits: a walk in the park or
along the beach; music; reading; sitting quietly in a secluded, deserted place.
These activities are also excellent choices for maintaining spiritual health.
Take care that your solitude doesn’t become a regular hiding place to wallow
over your losses. Be aware that seclusion can sometimes lead to depression.
Living your life to the fullest
You can perform a lot of actions to fight PD and its effects. But thousands of
PWP believe that a huge part of fighting PD is to approach it as only a piece
of their lives. The point is this: Those facets of your life that defined you
74
Part II: Making PD Part – But Not All – of Your Life 

before you were diagnosed are still there — at least for the most part. If you
were a parent before, you still are and your child (children) needs you as
much as before. If you had a career that you enjoyed (even loved), don’t
allow PD to become your new, full-time occupation. If you enjoyed sports,
music, and other leisure activities, get creative about finding new ways to
enjoy those pastimes. In short, LIVE!
The road will be challenging, but as actor and PD advocate, Michael J. Fox,
wrote in his biography, Lucky Man, “If you were to rush into this room right
now and announce that you had struck a deal — with God, Allah, Buddha,
Christ, Krishna, Bill Gates, whomever — in which the ten years since my diag-
nosis could be magically taken away, traded in for the person I was before, I
would, without a moment’s hesitation, tell you to take a hike.”
Next steps
Getting information you can trust so you can form the questions to ask so
you can establish some clear goals for managing this condition — pretty tall
order! Consider these three concrete steps that you can take right now to get
started:
1. Go online and bookmark the sites listed in Appendix B if you have
access to a computer.
These national organizations are your best resource for the latest
updates on treatments as well as tips for managing your PD symptoms.
Get into the habit of regularly checking in on the sites you find most
useful. If the site offers an e-list, sign up.
2. Call the toll-free numbers for the PD organizations if you don’t have
access to a computer.
Ask them to send you their printed materials and add you to the mailing
list for new materials in the future.
3. Keep reading.
Before you turn to the next chapter, take a moment to read through the fol-
lowing with your family — especially the person who is most likely to be your
primary care partner. Even though these sections (scattered throughout this
book) are labeled for the care partner, try to read them together. The informa-
tion applies to both of you because you have a responsibility to acknowledge
that your care partner has a life beyond helping you manage your PD. (You
may also want to check out Chapter 24 for more tips about how to give and
receive care and support.)
75
Chapter 5: You’ve Been Diagnosed — Now What?

A Word for the PD Care Partner
In many chronic, progressive illnesses (for example, Alzheimer’s disease),
family members must increasingly take charge. With PD, however, the PWP
can be in charge most of the way. As the care partner, you may want to take
over, especially as tasks become more difficult and decisions take longer for
your partner to process. But resist that urge. Partnering-in-care is not doing
for — it’s doing with.
But where does that leave you as you face your own fears and anxieties about
living with someone who has a chronic, progressive condition that won’t go
away but will color your lives for years to come? Go back and reread this
chapter. Everything we suggest for the PWP applies to you as well:
 Sort through your emotions; deal with the anger, the fear, and the reali-
ties of how life is going to change (see also Chapter 22).
 Adopt a take charge/move forward/don’t look back outlook and start
preparing for eventualities that may occur down the road. (You may
especially want to read Chapters 20 and 21 about housing options and
financial and legal matters.)
 Be proactive. Educate yourself; go to doctor and therapy appointments
with the PWP and take notes; become a combination of cheerleader and
coach as your loved one faces new challenges.
 Set goals that allow you to maintain a life and identity beyond your role
as care partner.
The best support you can offer over the long term is to be a fierce advocate
for your loved one’s autonomy and independence. The next best way to show
support is to take care of yourself and see that your needs are also met. By
working together — in partnership — the two of you can take something that
could have destroyed you and turn it into a life-experience that enriches you
in ways you cannot yet imagine.

Drafting Your Healthcare 
Team and a Game Plan
In This Chapter
 Recruiting your professional care team
 Prepping for unexpected scenarios
 Touching base with your care partner
K
nowledge may be power, but with today’s constant bombardment of
information, you need a team of experts that can answer questions and
address unexpected situations with the most-advanced procedures.
People with Parkinson’s (PWP), like people with other chronic-care needs,
must rely on the expertise of several different professionals throughout the
course of their illness. In this chapter, professionals and their roles in manag-
ing your Parkinson’s symptoms are defined. You also take a look at how best
to handle hospitalizations, emergency room visits, and other unexpected
medical predicaments and complications that are possible for PWP. Last, but
not least, your care partner gets ideas for building his own team.
Introducing Your Teammates
Each member of your professional Parkinson’s disease (PD) team has special
talents and expertise that can help you manage symptoms and maintain
normal function and quality of life, often for years following the initial diagno-
sis. In this section, you discover a list of professionals and their roles in your
care, and then you uncover your role in helping these pros perform at their
very best.

Lining up the doctors
At least two doctors will help set the course for your care after your PD diag-
nosis. In addition, you may have other specialists (or you may add them at a
later date) if you have other chronic conditions, such as arthritis, hyperten-
sion, and the like. The more doctors you have, the more vital it becomes for
one doctor (most likely your primary care physician) to take the role of quar-
terback to oversee and coordinate the plan to meet all your health needs.
Your primary care physician
Your primary care physician (PCP) may be a general practitioner (GP) who
focuses on family medicine or that person may be an internist who treats
adults only. You’ve probably been seeing this doctor for some time and have
built a trust and style of communication that works for both of you. Now that
you have PD, you need to talk with your PCP about two things: his willingness
to consult and communicate with your neurologist (who’ll take the lead on
treating your PD symptoms), and how your PD treatment can integrate with
your overall healthcare plan.
Your neurologist
Chances are good that your PCP referred you to a neurologist to confirm the
PD diagnosis. If so, these two professionals may already have a good working
relationship. However, if you went for a second (or even third) opinion and
chose another neurologist to oversee your PD care, be sure that these two
doctors meet and show a clear willingness to work together. It’s also helpful if
your PCP and neurologist are on staff at the same hospital in case you need
hospitalization or emergency treatment down the road. (For tips on locating
and choosing a neurologist, see Chapter 4.)
Other specialists
In the event you need to consult with other specialists (a cardiologist, urolo-
gist, or the like) for new medical situations that arise, these physicians must
work closely with your PCP and neurologist so they’re all communicating
from the same play book (to continue the sports analogy). Think of these
doctors as coming off the bench. When they get into the game, they need to
get up to speed on your game plan and their specific roles.
Before you keep an appointment with a specialist ask your PCP (and neurolo-
gist, if appropriate) to send the specialist(s) a copy of your most recent
records. After your visit with one of these doctors, ask that a copy of the
office visit report be sent to your PCP with a copy sent to you at the same
time. With this exchange of information between doctors — and by assem-
bling your own file of reports — you enhance the likelihood that everyone is
on the same page, working from the same information.
78
Part II: Making PD Part – But Not All – of Your Life 

Calling up the therapists
Because PD is a movement disorder that affects your ability to perform basic
movements, your physical, occupational, and (possibly) speech therapists are
very important. These professionals offer proven methods to enhance and pro-
long your control of symptoms, and improve your overall sense of well-being.
Their services may or may not be covered by insurance unless your doctor’s
prescription notes them as medically necessary to treat your PD.
Physical therapist
A physical therapist (PT) can teach you how to build muscle strength, increase
flexibility, and improve coordination and balance to prevent falls and serious
fractures. Techniques may include exercise programs (standard as well as
alternatives, like yoga), heat and cold packs, and water therapy (exercises in
water).
Your PT can design a program of exercises specific to your individual symp-
toms and abilities to preserve and even increase your muscle strength and
flexibility. 
Although exercise doesn’t appear to slow the progression of PD, recent stud-
ies indicate that exercise may help prevent the orthopedic muscular and
skeletal effects of akinesia (slowed or impaired ability to move) and lessen
rigidity (stiff muscles). Exercise helps you maintain balance and prevent falls.
Your PT can’t work miracles. If you only exercise when you go to a session
with your PT, you’re not likely to see ongoing or long-term benefits. When the
physical therapy sessions end (or when the time between sessions stretches
to two weeks or more), you need to pursue your own regular program of
stretching, strengthening, and aerobic exercises if you want the physical 
therapy to be successful in the long run. See Chapter 12 for a suggested pro-
gram of stretches and exercises.
Occupational therapist
Essentially, the occupational therapist (OT) helps preserve your sense of inde-
pendence and self-confidence by showing you new ways of performing simple
and routine tasks (known in the medical profession as activities of daily living
or ADLs) that may have become difficult for you. One significant benefit of
working with an OT is simply knowing that you can preserve your control
(with alternative techniques) when the loss of control seems a foregone con-
clusion. For example, she may teach you new techniques (such as a cueing or
a reminder system) and provide assistive devices (such as a special cane)
that help you perform certain movements and tasks.
79
Chapter 6: Drafting Your Healthcare Team and a Game Plan

For more information on ways to adapt to your changing symptoms, check
out the information in Part III on living with PD.
Speech therapist
Not every PWP needs speech therapy, but if you’re experiencing a softened
vocal tone, unintentional mispronunciations, or wrong word choices, a
speech therapist can help. These professionals can also help if you ever
develop swallowing or other throat muscle problems that can come with PD.
If a trained speech therapist isn’t available in your area, consider trying a
program especially for PWP called the Lee Silverman Voice Treatment or
LSVT. For more information about the LSVT Foundation, its programs, and
links to other PD groups, see www.lsvt.org.
Drafting other team players
As a PWP, you have your front-line defense consisting of your PCP, your neu-
rologist, and trained movement and speech therapists. But, have you consid-
ered the number of other professionals that can help you to manage your
symptoms and continue living a normal life as long as possible? Be sure that
you include the following care professionals and experts when you’re assem-
bling the team.
Pharmacist
Your pharmacist is in the business of knowing medications and their interac-
tions. She knows your current medications, their potential side effects, and
the possible impact of any new medication that your PCP or neurologist may
prescribe. And, because this is her area of expertise, she’s your best resource
for answering your questions after you’ve carefully read the printed informa-
tion on your prescriptions. (For more information about prescription medi-
cines, be sure to check out Chapter 9.)
Your job? Pick one pharmacy (or chain that shares information among all
branches) to fill all your prescriptions and stick with them. Then be sure the
pharmacist knows which over-the-counter (OTC) medicines you’re taking or
considering taking.
Psychologist or counselor
Anxiety and depression are part and parcel of having PD, and they’re per-
fectly normal reactions to hearing a diagnosis of a chronic, progressive 
condition. A trained and licensed counselor can be a key member of your
professional care team. Whether you see this person on a regular basis for
80
Part II: Making PD Part – But Not All – of Your Life 

talk therapy sessions (see Chapter 13 for more on this topic) or just now and
then for some emotional unburdening, go ahead and identify this counselor
shortly after your diagnosis is confirmed.
Support groups
Throughout this book we tout the benefits of joining a support group — for
you and your care partner. You may reject this idea in the early stages. “I
don’t want to sit around talking to a bunch of strangers or listening to them
complain about their PD. I’ve got my own problems.” Wrong! Well, sort of.
You definitely have your own problems. But, here’s the point you’re missing:
A support group can help you find ways to cope with those problems.
Many types of support groups are around for PWP and their care partners.
Some groups take a broader advocacy approach, while other groups focus
more on their members. All support groups should have a trained profes-
sional that leads or facilitates the discussions (someone with experience and
credentials). For more information, see Chapter 13 or to locate a group in
your area go to www.apdaparkinson.org.
Legal and financial advisors
Your PD may eventually affect your ability to make key decisions about
finances and legal matters, about the future of your family, and about your
own future. Although this problem may never arise, working with an expert
as early as possible after your diagnosis to put key documents and plans in
order is just smart planning — whether you have PD or not. (For a full discus-
sion of the legal and financial matters that need attention, see Chapter 20.)
Given the complexities of PD costs, drafting an insurance advisor for your team
is a wise maneuver. This person can guide you and your care partner through
the multitude of questions related to disability (short and long term), Medi-
care, Medicaid, Health Management Organizations (HMOs), Preferred Physician
Organizations (PPOs), Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), and any other 
alphabet-soup plans that will undoubtedly surface in the future.
Spiritual advisor
Taking a holistic approach — caring for yourself physically, mentally, and
spiritually — can give you a jump on managing your PD symptoms. Many
people focus on the physical and mental but figure the spiritual will take care
of itself. Remember: Your spiritual well being has just as many levels as your
physical and mental health. If you have a spiritual mentor that you can tap to
join your professional care team, do so early on. This person may be your
clergy, someone who’s mentored you through other passages, a practitioner
of alternative or complementary medicine, or even the counselor that’s men-
tioned in the “Psychologist or counselor” section of this chapter.
81
Chapter 6: Drafting Your Healthcare Team and a Game Plan

Making the cut
Drafting a team of experts in your battle against PD has benefits well beyond
the expertise of each member. When you choose them carefully and treat
them with respect, you find these men and women will go to great lengths for
you. They even become some of your most enthusiastic cheerleaders, offer-
ing support and encouragement, humor, and affection as you confront the
challenges of living with PD.
How do you evaluate each member of the team? The criteria are pretty 
standard — regardless of the profession:
 Does this person have the right stuff — the appropriate credentials and
experience — to handle the job?
 Is it a good fit — are you comfortable with this person? Can you talk
about anything or ask the silliest question without feeling intimidated?
 Does this person really listen? Is he open to ideas that aren’t his own?
 Does this person give you the time you need — especially when your PD
may slow your movements, thinking, and ability to put thoughts into
words?
 Is this person willing to admit limits to her knowledge and expertise and
refer you to someone more qualified to handle a specific issue?
 Will this person be there when you need him?
Working with Your Team to 
Manage the Unexpected
Stuff happens, and worst-case scenarios happen unexpectedly. Maybe you
fall or burn yourself while preparing dinner and end up in the emergency
room. Or, despite all precautions, you experience an adverse drug interaction
that requires a stay in the hospital. Nonmedical emergencies — a fire, a
weather event (such as a severe storm or tornado) — can also crop up. Our
advice throughout this book is this: Have a plan in the event something unex-
pected happens. This doesn’t mean you’re assuming the worst. You just want
to be ready — or as ready as possible.
82
Part II: Making PD Part – But Not All – of Your Life 

Establishing an emergency plan
Be prepared — the motto of the Boy Scouts of America is just as useful for
PWP and their care partners. You or your care partner may never need to dial
911, but what if . . . ? Why not think in the relative calm of your normal rou-
tine and prepare for that possible unexpected event? These next sections
provide specific recommendations to help you prepare and then deal with a
variety of emergencies.
The home front
Start your emergency plan with home safety by reviewing the tips for acci-
dent-proofing your home in Chapter 21. Then consider what to do in case of 
a medical emergency, such as an allergic reaction or a dislocated shoulder or
some other emergency beyond your control — a fire, a flood, a blackout. Who
do you call? Where do you go? What do you do?
Your home is unique, just like you, so the best way to prepare for a safety
emergency is to contact your local fire department. It may have a program
where a firefighter comes out, assesses your home for fire safety, and then
offers pointers for handling emergencies. Another resource that offers a
checklist for creating your own evacuation plan is available through the
American Red Cross at www.redcross.org. 
Personal records
Take advantage of the following tips that put you ahead of the panic if a med-
ical or safety emergency does arise:
 Gather this vital information:
• A list of all prescription and OTC medications and a list of any
allergies and chronic health conditions you have besides your PD
• Insurance or Medicare numbers
• Your medical history
• Names and contact numbers of your doctors and for an emergency
contact person, like your significant other, for example
 Date all this information and update it regularly, especially when you
add or discontinue meds.
 Make sure you and your care partner have copies of this info at all times
in your wallet or purse and in you car(s). 
 Let key others (your employer, a trusted neighbor who may respond to
an emergency) know where to find the information should you be unable
to direct them.
83
Chapter 6: Drafting Your Healthcare Team and a Game Plan

 Prepare a folder specifically for the emergency room. (People adminis-
tering care don’t have time to read old records.) Include the following
pieces of information in the folder:
• All information listed in the previous section, “Personal records.”
• A copy of your advance directive (a living will and a medical power
of attorney), even if the hospital and your doctor already have it
on file. If you don’t want the medical staff to provide certain inter-
ventions or extraordinary measures to save your life, you must
provide that information. (See Chapter 20 for more info on these
and other legal issues.)
 Prepare a fireproof box with copies of key documents: insurance and
Social Security cards; bank and credit card account numbers; wills,
powers of attorney (financial and medical), and photos of valuables in
case of a fire or weather catastrophe (such as a tornado or hurricane).
 Post critical emergency contact numbers near your home phone. Those
numbers include local hospital emergency room, fire department, police
department, utility company (for power outages), doctors, pharmacist
(in the event of an adverse drug reaction), and a relative or friend to
contact.
Easy access
You may never need emergency intervention, but you’re better off to be pre-
pared with information that an emergency team can readily access. Take the
following measures to prevent glitches when seconds count.
 Distribute duplicate house keys to trusted friends and neighbors.
 Be sure your care partner can access financial funds any time you may
not be able to take financial actions such as writing checks to pay bills
or transferring funds from savings to checking accounts as needed.
 If you live alone, get a medical alert system, which enables you to call
for help if you’re unable to get to a telephone. (Yup, we’re talking about
that classic TV commercial — “Help! I’ve fallen and can’t get up!”)
Decision time
In an emergency, don’t waste time worrying whether you should call for help.
Risking a little embarrassment rather than your life is always the wise move.
However, if you do need to call for an ambulance or go to the emergency
room, be realistic about your expectations. Keep in mind that the United
States has nearly 40 million people with no health insurance; for these folks,
the ER doctor is likely their doctor of choice. 
84
Part II: Making PD Part – But Not All – of Your Life 

Note: The Centers for Disease Control estimates the average waiting time in
the ER (if you’re not critically injured or ill) is three hours; in cold and flu
season the wait can be much longer.
Because of possible delays, you need to
 Speak up if you’re experiencing symptoms such as extreme pain, trouble
breathing, dizziness, and other signs of distress.
 Tell every ER person who examines or assists you that you have PD (and
any other chronic conditions such as diabetes or hypertension) even
though someone has taken your history and you know these facts are on
your patient information sheet.
 Be proactive. Make sure that the people who treat you are aware of your
medications and allergies.
If your situation is serious but not life threatening, call your doctor or the
nearest urgent-care or walk-in clinic for faster response and care. And if your
doctor does advise you to get to the ER, he can speed up your process by
calling the hospital and telling the ER staff that you’re on the way.
The hospital stay and its aftermath
If you need to be admitted to the hospital, the cause isn’t likely to be your
PD. The more likely reasons will be a serious injury (such as a hip fracture or
head trauma from a fall) or another heath condition (such as heart problems
or diabetes). Regardless, be prepared with the necessary information (see
the previous section for suggestions) to make the stay less stressful for
everyone.
Leave valuables (checkbook, credit cards, jewelry, and the like) at home. If
you must bring them because of an emergency and the haste in leaving for
the hospital, hand them off to a trusted family member or friend as soon as
possible. Or ask a staff member whether the hospital has a safe place to keep
the valuables until you can make arrangements for them.
The same suggestions outlined for an emergency (see the previous section
“Establishing an emergency plan”) apply for a hospital stay. But, because
you’ll likely be in the hospital for days rather than hours, you must monitor
the orders for your PD medications. The attending physician and the staff
may not realize the importance of your PD meds’ strict dosing and timing. For
example, your neurologist’s orders for medication at 8 a.m., noon, 4 p.m., and
8 p.m. may be interpreted by the hospital staff as four times a day over a 24-
hour period, or 8 a.m., 2 p.m., 8 p.m., and 2 a.m.
85
Chapter 6: Drafting Your Healthcare Team and a Game Plan

Sometimes your PD meds need to be suspended so new medications for the
condition that landed you in the hospital can work. Again, be vigilant about
your care. Have your care partner alert your neurologist (or the doctor man-
aging your PD care) as soon as you know you’re going to the hospital and
insist that the hospital on-call physician (or any doctor who orders the sus-
pension of your PD meds) consults with your neurologist before ordering any
changes in medication.
86
Part II: Making PD Part – But Not All – of Your Life 
I’m not fooling around and I’m not drunk — 
I have Parkinson’s disease
To offset any misunderstandings that may occur
during your hospital stay, consider packing a
copy of the following note in your bag and
showing it to the staff. In spite of its lighthearted
tone, the note provides critical information
about your care.
To whom it may concern:
First of all, let me say how much I appreciate
everything you’ll be doing to care for me while
I’m here. My care partner and I understand that
you have other patients to attend to besides me.
In return I ask that you understand some things
about me:
 You may have noticed that I’m moving pretty
slowly and I probably couldn’t walk a
straight line if my life depended on it. Am I
intoxicated? Nope. I’ve got this thing called
Parkinson’s disease.
 Other times you may notice that I seem to
be doing just fine — doing normal stuff like
brushing my teeth, washing my face, walk-
ing around on my own — and then my call
bell will light up, and I’ll be asking you to
please come help me get to the bathroom.
What gives? I have Parkinson’s, and the
medications I take to control it have these
on-off cycles. One minute I can perform
routine things, and the next I need all the
help I can get. 
 Speaking of meds, I really need for you —
and everyone involved in treating me while
I’m here — to know that certain medica-
tions commonly used in hospital settings
can really mess with my PD symptoms.
Please check with my neurologist, Dr.
__________ at __________, before order-
ing or administering any new medication —
especially antinausea or antipsychotic
meds.
 And finally, as long as the subject of
antipsychotic is on the table, please be
aware that my Parkinson’s may cause me to
experience confusion, disorientation, and
even some interesting misperceptions
about where I am and what you’re doing. I
may also start to hallucinate — fortunately
these visions I experience are usually
benign and silent, so no voices are sug-
gesting that I do you bodily harm. Again
please check with Dr. __________ before
administering any meds.
That’s pretty much it in a nutshell. Having PD
and being in the hospital can be a challenge for
both of us, but hopefully now that you under-
stand, we’ll both have an easier time of it.
Thanks for understanding and thanks for your
care and concern.
Sincerely,
(Put your name here)

Any time that your medications are being administered for you (as in a hospi-
tal setting) instead of you taking them yourself, be sure that you or your care
partner carefully examine the pills you get. If any of the meds look different
from those you take at home, question it. Also, since hospital staff is respon-
sible for administering medications to a number of patients with diverse 
conditions, there may be a delay in your getting your PD meds on time. If nec-
essary, have your neurologist contact the attending physician at the hospital
to discuss the correct medication regimen. Also, make sure the attending
staff knows which medications may be contraindicated (harmful) for PWP.
(Copy the list of red-flag medications provided on the Cheat Sheet at the front
of this book and ask the admitting doctor to add it to your file.)
In addition to monitoring your medications, you may have another battle to
wage: The hospital staff, even though they’re medical professionals, may have
limited or no experience with PD and may misinterpret your PD symptoms —
on-off cycles, dykinesias, confusion from the stress of a hospital environment,
and the like. For example, if a nursing assistant sees you up and mobile at 2:00
and comes back at 3:00 because you want assistance getting to the bathroom,
he may think you’re just looking for extra attention. For one good idea for head-
ing off any staff resentment or misunderstanding, see the nearby sidebar, “I’m
not fooling around and I’m not drunk — I have Parkinson’s disease.”
More tips for managing the unexpected
Emergencies arise for all kinds of people. But because you have PD, such
crises may carry the extra elements of stress and panic. You and your care
partner may want to consider taking a basic first-aid course through your
local Red Cross or YMCA to better prepare yourselves for unlikely emergen-
cies, such as bleeding, choking, medication reaction, falls, and so on.
If you need to call 911, be prepared to give the following information:
 Phone number you’re calling from
 Address and directions to help the ambulance get there quickly
 Description of the person’s condition (breathing? conscious?)
 Your name
In addition, follow these steps:
1. Don’t hang up until the emergency operator tells you to.
2. Be sure you unlock the door and turn on outside lights.
Even if it’s not night, the lit porch light makes locating the right house
easier.
87
Chapter 6: Drafting Your Healthcare Team and a Game Plan

3. If possible, have another family member or neighbor wait outside to
direct the emergency personnel.
4. Stay close so you can provide answers to key questions, but let the
emergency personnel do their jobs.
5. Gather the information you’ve prepared (see the earlier section
“Establishing an emergency plan”) and get ready to go.
Consider having only cordless phones so you can move around the house
(unlocking doors and turning on lights) while you’re talking on the phone
with the doctor or emergency operator.
A Word for the PD Care Partner
This book has a number of chapters that you may want to read and heed.
This is one of them. Putting together a network of professionals that you and
the PWP can call upon as issues crop up will make life easier for both of you.
Within this group of professionals, you need to find your own experts —
three people you can turn to with your concerns of managing and coping:
 Primary care physician: You may have the same general practitioner or
internist as the PWP. As long as this physician attends to your needs and
concerns when you’re the patient, that’s fine. However, you may want to
consider a PCP who isn’t involved in your PWP’s care. This is your deci-
sion, but remember: You need someone to focus on maintaining your
physical health and well being.
 Counselor or therapist: Being a partner in care can be extremely stress-
ful, especially as the needs escalate. But you’ll be better prepared to
cope with the unexpected twists and turns along the way if you take
time now to connect with a professional who counsels care partners.
Don’t be stubborn about this. You are at risk for episodes of anxiety,
panic, and depression as much as the PWP.
 Support group and spiritual advisor: Okay, so we cheated and lumped
two into one. But your spiritual health is a vital piece of your ability to
partner in care. A support group can provide a safe place to talk about
(and let go of) those bad feelings you may be wrestling with (see
Chapter 22 for more on this topic). And it has folks who can laugh and
share some of the black humor that comes with being a care partner —
they all know, understand, and feel your pain. As for a spiritual advisor,
you know yourself best. Your clergyperson, a trusted mentor, your coun-
selor or therapist, and your support-group leader are all good candi-
dates to fill this role.

to Share Your News

 Keeping the story straight: How to share the news with your family
 Sharing with your inner circle: That’s what friends are for
 Determining who else needs to know
 Taking the high road: People who overreact and folks who poke their noses in your 
business
L
iving with Parkinson’s disease (PD) can go well beyond the person diag-
nosed with PD. Day in and year out, the disease also affects the people
who live with, work with, care about, and love the person with PD (PWP). It
affects generations — children, grandchildren, and even aging parents (in the
case of young onset PD, see Chapter 8), who may be facing their own health
challenges.
Everyone has concentric circles of personal contacts. In the closest circles, 
we have our immediate family (spouse, partner, kids, parents) and perhaps a
couple of truly best friends. Next comes a little wider circle — friends we
socialize with, extended family, and perhaps a couple of professionals, like 
our doctor or clergyperson. Further removed from the core of our lives is
another group — our employer and co-workers, acquaintances, and neighbors.
Deciding when and how to tell each person or group about your diagnosis is an
individual decision, one that you have to base on the dynamics of your rela-
tionships and your comfort level in sharing this kind of news. But first . . .

Before You Start Spreading the News
Even if you initially share your diagnosis with very few people, you need to
plan how you want these people to react — both immediately and in the future.
Establishing your ground rules
Start by determining your ground rules and the level of support you want.
The following categories identify some of the more common PWP stances:
 Some PWP are fighters: They go on immediate offense, take charge, and
fight this enemy with every ounce of strength and all the resources they
can muster.
 Other PWP take a flight (or more defensive) position: In some ways they
choose to ignore the whole situation. Flight folks use their energy and
resources to assure everyone (and most of all themselves) that nothing
has really changed — life goes on.
 A third group of PWP falls somewhere in the middle, combining facets 
of fight and flight: Although they want life to continue as normally as
possible, they realize they have to fight back to keep their PD’s progres-
sion at bay.
Whichever group you’re in, you need to think about your ground rules for
living with PD. What kind of meaningful care and support can the groups of
people in your life offer as you face life with PD? Those who care about you —
family members, friends, neighbors, co-workers — naturally want to help. In
many cases, they’re not sure how to offer that support. You need to explain the
ground rules and indicate what will — and won’t — be helpful.
Preparing to state your needs
Think through now — alone, or preferably with your care partner (the person
who will most likely be with you for the whole journey) — how other people
can help. Initially you may need people to listen, to distract you when neces-
sary, and to give you the gift of normalcy just by being themselves.
As your needs become more specific and as you accept the hands-on help of
others, you also discover three really important outcomes:
90
Part II: Making PD Part – But Not All – of Your Life 

 You empower people by allowing them to contribute something truly
meaningful to you.
 You ease some of the responsibility that may have fallen on your care
partner’s shoulders.
 You prevent yourself from becoming isolated, and you actually increase
your ability to take control of situations as they arise.
Accepting help is not a sign of weakness; in fact, it’s a sign of strength.
Acceptance shows you haven’t surrendered to the challenges of PD. And
when you can’t fight the battle alone, you still win because you have people
willing to step up to the fight for you.
Meeting the challenge with good humor
We can’t say this too often: An upbeat, optimistic attitude is one of your most
effective weapons against PD. And right next to it is the ability to laugh —
with others, at yourself, and especially at your PD. We’re talking black humor
here, folks.
91
Chapter 7: Choosing How and When to Share Your News
Bill of Rights for people with Parkinson’s
Declarations of individual rights are nothing new.
Perhaps you’ve noticed rights lists posted when
you visit a hospital or care facility. But we think
it’s important that you — the person with PD —
know your own inalienable rights. Feel free to
edit and add your own ideas to the following list.
Then bookmark it and reread it regularly.
I have the right
 To take care of and make decisions for
myself for as long as I am capable and 
to expect my care partners to respect my
wishes, should the time come when they
speak for me
 To seek help from others as I recognize
limits to my own endurance and strength
 To maintain those facets of my life that were
part of my identity before my PD diagnosis
for as long as possible — even if each task
takes three times as long
 To occasionally (and humanly) get angry, be
depressed, and work my way through other
difficult feelings
 To reject any attempt by others (either con-
sciously or unconsciously) to limit my inde-
pendence because it’ll make life easier for
them
 To expect and receive consideration,
respect, encouragement, affection, and for-
giveness as long as I offer these same qual-
ities in return
 To take joy and pride in my accomplish-
ments — regardless of how small — and
the courage it takes to achieve them
 To speak out and demand that new
resources and eventually a cure be found —
if not for me, then for those who follow

For example, a diet-center leader famous for her wonderful sense of humor
inspired her feeling-sorry-for-themselves clients with the story of her father, a
large, barrel-chested man who had always been bigger than life. Then he got
cancer and started fading away — literally. One day toward the very end,
when he was but a shadow of his former robust self, he said to his daughter,
“You know I want to be cremated.” She nodded in agreement. “Well,” he
added, “if I keep dwindling away like this, I think you’ll be able to do the job
in the microwave!” His daughter was first stunned and then burst into laugh-
ter. That’s black humor, folks – and it works because it helps you keep your
perspective as you face the sometimes tough days of living with PD.
Breaking the News to Your Care Partner
Chances are your care partner was with you when the diagnosis of PD was
confirmed. If you learned the news together, then the telling part is done. But
the two of you still need to spend some time working your way through the
questions of how this diagnosis is going to affect your lives — individually
and together.
If your primary care partner is not your significant other (perhaps she’s a sib-
ling or an adult child who works, has a family of her own, and lives in another
community), give yourself a day or so to digest the diagnosis and think about
how you prefer to break the news.
When you’re ready (don’t wait too long; a day or week at most), try to have
the conversation in person and allow enough time to work through the dis-
cussion. If you can’t talk in person, choose a time when this person isn’t 
distracted by other activities and have the discussion by phone. When you
deliver the news, reassure this person that the diagnosis is not life-threatening
and you have no need for immediate action. Then set a time when the two of
you can discuss your present needs, your needs down the road, and her will-
ingness and capability for fulfilling those needs.
If you have to deliver the initial news by phone, urge your care partner to
check out some of the Web sites in Appendix B. Or call the folks at the
National Parkinson Foundation at 800-327-4545 and ask them to send copies
of their excellent (and free) booklet, Parkinson’s Disease: Caring and Coping 
to both of you. (In fact, while you’re at it, ask for copies of the entire series 
of booklets.)
During this sit-down conversation with your care partner, allow enough 
time to:
92
Part II: Making PD Part – But Not All – of Your Life 

 Share immediate emotional reactions — even if you’ve had a couple of
days or a week since you and your care partner heard the news.
 Be prepared for different responses. One of you may react with denial
and the other with anger. (Before this discussion, you may both benefit
by reading the section on personality differences in Chapter 5.)
 Set down in writing a list of steps to take. Include a tentative timeline for
each one based on the tips we offer in the next section.
Resist the urge (by you or your care partner) to leap ahead and take dramatic
and life-changing actions such as putting your home up for sale and moving
in with your daughter or assuming that you need to quit your job. You have
time. You are years — and perhaps decades — from needing to make these
lifestyle changes because of your PD.
Telling Your Family
When and how you deliver the news to your immediate and extended family
is an individual choice that’s influenced by
 The status of individual family relationships.
 Your personal feelings about how soon you want even close relatives to
know.
When you’re ready to talk to family members, the easiest way may be a family
gathering (if geography allows) where you tell all the adult members at once.
Everyone can hear the same version, and details won’t get distorted through
repetition. However, because families are so spread out in today’s world, a
family meeting may not be possible. In that case, consider arranging a confer-
ence call. Again, the goal is to deliver the news to all the adults at the same
time.
If you have children, find a place and time to share your news with them
before that larger meeting, especially if your PD is of the young-onset variety
and your children are still living at home. Your children will make this jour-
ney with you; they deserve to have the same time and privacy to digest this
news as your care partner had.
Give adults the facts
When you deliver the news to the adults in your immediate and extended
family, stick to the basics:
93
Chapter 7: Choosing How and When to Share Your News

 What PD is
 Whether others in the family are at risk
 How PD is treated
 What your prognosis is
Some family members may have suspected a serious illness of some kind;
others may be completely shocked at the news and take it hard. In either
case, a good first step is to educate and inform.
PD associations offer a number of basic educational and informational mate-
rials for fundamental questions about PD. These excellent materials are listed
in Appendix B. Handing out this printed information at a family meeting (or
e-mailing it if your family lives elsewhere) gives them a reference for ques-
tions after the initial shock wears off. By selecting the same material for
everyone, you lessen the chances of that information becoming distorted.
Set a positive tone
After you share the facts of PD with adult family members, consider setting
the tone for your emerging new relationships. For example, you can add,
“There’s a lot I don’t know, but I do know I can live a relatively normal life in
spite of my symptoms. The tough part is figuring out how to live it without
people feeling sorry for me or treating me differently.” With that simple state-
ment you’ve laid out the ground rules:
 You have PD, but you’re still you.
 Most important, you want other people to continue treating you the
same. (Okay, so Cousin Fred can let you win a few more poker games
and your mother may finally call someone else to get the cat out of the
tree each week.)
 How much you say beyond that — symptoms, research, no present
cures and such — is strictly up to you and your assessment of how
much information this group can handle at the first telling.
When that question of “What can I do to help?” comes up, perhaps the best
answer is to make these three points:
 Help me by being yourself and finding ways to continue our relationship
as normally and fully as before.
 Help me make sure my care partner maintains a life outside of mine.
94
Part II: Making PD Part – But Not All – of Your Life 

 Help me most of all by understanding that I’m still the same person
inside. Don’t let my PD symptoms scare you or make you treat me any
differently.
Don’t sugarcoat the situation for kids
Today’s children are bombarded with information from every possible angle.
Put another way, this generation is far savvier at a far younger age than most
adults can imagine. On some level, even very young children can understand
that something has changed in their environment. Don’t underestimate their
capacity for feeling stress and tension, especially when they can sense the
undercurrent in the household but no one’s talking with them about it.
 Teenagers can usually handle the same information you give the adults.
If your teen is especially sensitive or perhaps struggling with other emo-
tional challenges (the break-up of a relationship or not making the
sports team, for example), you may want to have the conversation with
that teen separately so you can focus on reassuring and comforting her.
 With younger children (or grandchildren), keep details as simple as 
possible. A terrific resource for telling young children (under age 12)
about PD is the book entitled I’ll Hold Your Hand So You Won’t Fall: A
Child’s Guide to Parkinson’s Disease by Rasheda Ali and her father,
Muhammad Ali.
 In some cases, children in their middle years (ages 9 to 12) are mature
enough to be included with the adults in the general family meeting. But
just because they seem to understand and accept the news, don’t
assume that they don’t have concerns or a gazillion questions about
how your lives are going to change.
 If the child is your grandchild, decide with the parents the best way to
deliver the news.
Regardless of the ages (or seeming maturity) of the children, never forget
that they’re children; they haven’t lived long enough to pile up the life experi-
ences and tools for coping that an adult has. Check in with your children and
grandchildren often through positive techniques such as:
 Seeking their help with innovative ways you can cope with certain limits
to normal tasks (like dressing) when your PD symptoms hinder you
 Continuing to pursue activities the two of you have always enjoyed —
even if you have to find ways to adapt, such as getting a recumbent bicy-
cle instead of riding your old one
 Providing the opportunity (place and time) for them to raise questions
and concerns about what your PD means for the future
95
Chapter 7: Choosing How and When to Share Your News

Giving Close Friends the News
Soon after you break the news to your family, consider how and when to tell
your closest friends. Again several issues are at play here, including the fact
that friends may have already noticed your symptoms and discussed their
concerns with each other. They may not have brought their concern to you
directly because they didn’t want to intrude.
How and when you choose to tell this group depends in part on the nature of
the group. In other words if your close friends are also close with each other,
then inviting everyone over to your house and telling them all at the same
time may be best. The advantage is that everyone hears the same words
(although they may process them differently) at the same time directly from
you. In addition, they can see your response to the diagnosis — hopefully
upbeat and optimistic — at the same time. And they can all hear the ground
rules for how you want them to respond to your diagnosis.
In cases where you have close friends who are not close with each other or
friends who live in other places, you may want to tell each individually. If so,
try to do it face to face (or at least by phone — not e-mail) so the person can
see and hear how you’re handling the diagnosis.
Consider providing the same helpful information (fact sheet and list of Web
sites) that we identify in the two previous sections so your friends can
pursue questions that may occur after you tell them.
Friendships can be critical to your overall sense of control and well-being
when you’re living with PD. Unfortunately, a lot of PWP make the mistake
when they get the diagnosis of pulling away from their friends or denying
their need for that support (tangible support like cutting the lawn or intangi-
ble support like just being there to listen).
When PWPs (or their care partners) react as if the support is an insult or a
statement of the PWP’s incapacity, they make matters worse. This reaction
can have a snowball effect because the friend who wanted to help feels
rejected (even embarrassed) at apparently adding to your stress. Before you
know it, those treasured friendships (along with the normalcy and pleasure
they brought your life) have disappeared.
As soon as you and your care partner are ready to go public with your news
to friends, take control and set the tone by doing the following:
 State your needs regarding your approach to PD. For example, tell them
you understand that they may want to rush in and start helping you
(preparing meals, handling the household and yard chores, and such),
but the best support they can offer is to help you maintain as normal a
life (and relationship) as possible for as long as possible.
96
Part II: Making PD Part – But Not All – of Your Life 

 Appreciate any offer of support and help (even if you shudder to think
that they believe you need that help).
 Be prepared to suggest alternate ways they can be a part of your net-
work of support and caring.
Another way to think of outside help is to consider your care partner and his
soon-to-be-filled-to-capacity schedule. By maintaining a normal routine with
friends and associates, you give your care partner a break to pursue life aside
from PD.
When you respond to your friends’ invitations to activities you enjoyed
before PD with “I can’t . . .,” they may stop offering and gradually get on with
their own lives. Instead, try an attitude of “I’d love to [play cards, bike, meet
you at the coffeehouse]. Help me figure out how we can make that happen.”
Then you can brainstorm options together.
As Lance Armstrong (the seven-time Tour de France winner and cancer sur-
vivor) has said, “C’mon, man. Everything’s an option.”
Widening the Circle: Informing Others
On the outer fringes of those concentric circles we describe at the beginning
of this chapter are those people who play a role in your life but not a vital or
intimate one (neighbors, community group associates, professionals you rely
upon, and so on). Breaking the news to this last circle of contacts (with the
possible exception of your boss and co-workers; see Chapter 16 for the
specifics on that special group) is not a responsibility that you need to feel
compelled to do right away — or ever. Basically, your condition’s really none
of their business.
On the other hand, don’t underestimate the unexpected support and manage-
ment resources that may come from one of these people. For example, your
barber or beautician may offer to make a house call as your symptoms
change. Or your neighbor may be happy to be on call for emergencies when
you’re alone and your partner’s at work.
When the timing seems right during the first months following your diagno-
sis, let these people know you have PD. Only you can decide how much infor-
mation they need or what kind of support and response they may provide.
But, as with anyone you tell, be prepared to set the tone for their response,
to correct misinformation they may have about PD, and to appreciate their
concern and support however they express it.
97
Chapter 7: Choosing How and When to Share Your News

Handling Sticky Conversations
Having said that, we need to get real here. Some people (and they may be in
your closest circles) are more hindrance than help when they hear you have
PD. One type simply can’t handle bad news of any sort, so you end up spend-
ing a lot of time and energy comforting and emotionally supporting their
(mostly unfounded) fears and anxieties. Another type believes they have all
the answers even though they have zero real knowledge about PD. They, too,
can use up your resources of energy and good humor as you try and educate
them to the realities of living with PD. Consider these tips for handling those
sticky situations:
 For people who simply can’t cope with difficult news, consider being
prepared with a specific request. You can ask, for example, “You’re such
an avid biker, would you be willing to bike with me once a week? My
doctor tells me that exercise, especially now in the early stages, is really
important, but I’d rather not go out alone.”
If this person is a close friend or family member, you may want to speak
with him separately and acknowledge his obvious fears and anxieties.
Then let him know that he can be most helpful by trying to remain
upbeat and positive — at least in your presence.
If all else fails, allow such people an initial period of mourning over your
news. Then insist that they get over it or else you’ll have to limit your con-
tact with them. This is not about these people. You’re the one with PD
and, bluntly stated, you just don’t need other people bringing you down.
 For the well-meaning folks (even strangers!) who see your tremor or
some other PD symptom and start telling you the story of their uncle’s
wife’s brother who also had PD, you need a different tactic. No doubt
such people mean well, but they’ll never be part of your care team. This
empathy and advice (or showing off!) is about them, not you.
Don’t allow unwanted advice or comments to upset you. Of the two of
you, you are the expert at PD. Acknowledge their effort to help, and then
walk away.

Special Advice for Those with
Young Onset Parkinson’s Disease
In This Chapter
 Noting similarities and differences of YOPD and traditional PD
 Fleshing out problems unique to YOPD
 Incorporating financial security into the plan
 Refining the PD care partner’s role
W
hen it comes to Parkinson’s disease (PD), no one’s more famous than
the popular actor Michael J. Fox. The twinkle in his eye and his leg-
endary self-deprecating humor — even about life with PD — make him less
the celebrity and more the national support-group leader for millions of
people with Parkinson’s (PWP) and their care partners.
In a 2006 interview in AARP, The Magazine, Fox reported that as many as 40
percent of the 60,000 new PD cases each year involve someone younger than
age 50. This figure alone blows holes in the myth that only old people get PD.
The fact that Fox was first diagnosed in his 30s shines an even brighter light
on the growing numbers of young and active people who face this challenge.
The cause of young onset Parkinson’s disease (YOPD) is as debatable as the
cause of traditional onset PD (see Chapter 2). But what isn’t debatable is the
fact that it hits people in their prime, plays havoc with their established roles
(spouse, parent, adult child of aging parents), derails rising careers, and over-
rides plans for the future.
In this chapter we take a look at the specific issues facing people diagnosed
with YOPD. When the information is the same for any PWP, we refer you to
other chapters in the book. But if you’re 30, 40, 50, or not yet 60 and have PD,
this chapter’s for you.

Comparing YOPD to Traditional Onset PD
The term onset age means when symptoms first appear — not when a diag-
nosis is made. If the onset age is earlier than age 50, the diagnosis is usually
YOPD. (In very rare cases, PD symptoms appear before a person reaches the
age of 21; the term juvenile Parkinson’s distinguishes it from traditional or
YOPD.)
Two excellent resources for information specially aimed at people with YOPD
are Young Onset Parkinson’s Association (YOPA) at www.yopa.org and The
Michael J. Fox Foundation at www.michaeljfox.org, where you can sign up
to receive regular Fox Flash e-mail bulletins. These periodic updates cover
upcoming foundation activities and provide valuable tips and information for
PWP and their care partners.
How they’re the same
PD is chronic, progressive, and (at least at this writing) incurable regardless
of your age and when you get it. On the positive side, it’s possible to live for
many years — in some cases a regular lifespan — in spite of having PD. It’s
possible to continue to work, to raise a family, to see children marry and
have children of their own, and to enjoy many of the same activities you
enjoyed before being diagnosed.
How they differ
YOPD and traditional onset PD differ in three basic ways:
 People with YOPD are less likely to experience the dementia (memory
problems) or balance problems that affect people whose PD begins
when they’re older. Part of the reason for the difference is that older
people are more likely to have multiple conditions (such as Alzheimer’s,
a series of small strokes, or adverse medication interaction) that affect
memory and balance.
 People with YOPD may experience a condition known as dystonia
(unusual muscle cramping, aches, or abnormal movement in a particular
area of the body such as a foot or shoulder). For reasons that still aren’t
clear, older patients seldom experience dystonia but tend to have tremor
(shaking), a symptom that’s less common for a person with YOPD.
100
Part II: Making PD Part – But Not All – of Your Life 

Although dystonia is well recognized as the possible first symptom of
YOPD, your diagnosis may be delayed if your doctor isn’t familiar with
such PD symptoms in younger patients. According to the Young Onset
Parkinson’s Association, the number of people with YOPD may be signifi-
cantly under-reported for the very reason that many people experience
early symptoms for years before they get to a doctor who considers PD
as a possible diagnosis.
 In general, people with YOPD appear to respond well to antiparkinson-
ian medications, yet side effects (such as dyskinesia — uncontrollable
movements) may affect them more quickly than older PWP.
In an article for the American Parkinson’s Disease Association, Lawrence
I. Golbe notes that people with YOPD experience two specific medica-
tion-related problems more than older PWP: early wearing-off of the
medication benefits and on-off fluctuations (when PD meds lose their
effectiveness so symptoms reappear before the next dose is due).
Many people with YOPD (and their doctors) elect to postpone treatment
with antiparkinsonian meds as long as possible to avoid some of these
escalated symptoms and side effects. Note: Research shows no clear evi-
dence that early withholding of therapy has long-term benefits.
Faster or slower? What’s the prognosis?
The jury’s still out on the pace of progression for people with YOPD. However,
more advanced therapies may eventually postpone the progression of symp-
toms for a longer time — perhaps adding years to the person’s relatively
normal life.
PD — regardless of the age of onset — affects each individual differently. As
with any health issue, your physical and mental health at the onset of PD
(and your fight to maintain that well being through a balanced diet and regu-
lar exercise program) can have an enormous effect on the prognosis. Nothing
is carved in stone regarding the progression of symptoms — no matter how
old or young you are when they start.
Facing the Special Challenges of YOPD
If you have YOPD, the most difficult challenge may be the very fact that
you’re young. You had planned a life packed with many goals, and one of
them was not living with a chronic and progressive condition!
101
Chapter 8: Special Advice for Those with Young Onset Parkinson’s Disease

Most people in their young adult years tend to see themselves as invincible.
They may take steps to ensure financial security for their family and them-
selves in the unlikely event that something bad happens, but they really don’t
consider it a possibility.
But, now it appears that the unlikely event has happened: You’ve been diag-
nosed with YOPD. And it’s standing directly in the way of the life you’ve
planned. At first you can see no way around it. But you know better. You
know something this scary, this bleak can enrich your life in many ways.
Stop for a moment and consider other times when you faced what seemed
like an impossible challenge. How did you respond to that challenge? Maybe
it was a basketball game when your team was down by a point with only sec-
onds to go and you were at the line for two free throws. Maybe it was a far
more serious situation like financial difficulties or the possibility of losing
your job. Maybe it was when you needed and wanted to prove yourself to
someone you admired and respected. Whatever the challenge, you took 
some mental steps early on to face the threat or achieve what you wanted.
In this section we give you the mental steps to help you get through this 
diagnosis and come out on top — again.
Getting an accurate diagnosis
The diagnosis of YOPD is based on the same cardinal signs used to diagnose
PD at any age:
 Tremor at rest (trembling when body part is not engaged in activity)
 Rigidity (muscle and joint stiffness)
 Bradykinesia (slowed or impaired ability to move)
 Postural instability (impaired balance)
Cases of YOPD tend to present less often with tremor and more often with
bradykinesia, rigidity, and abnormal muscle cramps (dystonia) that fre-
quently affect one foot.
When a person develops PD at a young age, the doctor must make sure that
the patient doesn’t have another disorder that can mimic parkinsonism (see
also Chapter 4). Your doctor should always check for two rare diseases in
particular: Wilson’s disease (which requires a different treatment) and Dopa-
responsive dystonia (DRD), which has a prognosis very different from PD.
102
Part II: Making PD Part – But Not All – of Your Life 

The genetic element (see Chapter 2) seems to be more prevalent in YOPD
than older PD patients. In some cases, the doctor may order a test for Parkin
mutation, which is more frequent in YOPD. If you agree to have this DNA test,
be sure you ask to see a certified genetic consultant in order to discuss all
the implications (emotional and practical) of this test for you and your
family.
Handling the diagnosis: A positive 
attitude is the best offense
Get ready for a ride on the emotional roller coaster after you get the diagno-
sis. Your initial reaction may range from disbelief to denial to anger to all of
the above and then some. Your mind may rocket from image to image — will
you see your kids grow up, graduate, and marry? Will you be able to work
and support yourself and your family? What about the dreams you had of
traveling, starting your own business, running that marathon? What about
those words no cure?
Give yourself some time to mourn the fact that your life does not — for the
moment — seem to be headed in the direction you had hoped. And then get
on with it. This is the life you’ve been given. Everyone has to deal with chal-
lenges and tough choices at some point in life. PD is yours.
Because you’re under 50 (even under 40), you have young onset PD, which
has no cure — yet. However,
 Researchers have already developed proven techniques and therapies
for managing and treating symptoms.
 You can maintain function and a relatively normal lifestyle over a period
of years and — in your case — possibly decades.
 You will not die from Parkinson’s disease
 Much of the life you imagined is still within your reach. The odds are
very good that you’ll
• See your children grow up, graduate, marry — and have children.
• Continue working for years to come and even realize the dream of
starting a second career.
• Travel. Why not? (The marathon may be a little trickier.)
• Get very good at finding ways to adapt PD to goals that are really
important to you.
103
Chapter 8: Special Advice for Those with Young Onset Parkinson’s Disease

And the best defense is a good offense
Okay, so you’ve taken time to digest the diagnosis and you have the attitude
thing going. Now what? Take a look at the following sections to keep moving
in the right direction.
Brain power
You initial response may be to run to the library or computer and look at
every statistic you can find on YOPD. What were the odds that you’d get PD?
What’s the likely prognosis in years? What percentage of PWP your age are
able to keep working, see their children grow up, have sex?
Mark Twain said there are three kinds of lies — lies, damned lies, and statis-
tics. You can choose to believe the statistics and project them onto the rest
of your life or you can refuse to be a statistic. You can determine that you’re
unique and that you’ll custom design (with your care team — see Chapter 6)
your PD management for you — and only you. But the immediate challenge is
to get to work educating yourself (and your family and friends) about this
diagnosis.
You’ve already taken a positive step by reading this book! It’s chock-full of
chapters offering information for anyone living with PD — young or not-so-
young. After you’ve read it (and, of course, shared it with people close to
you!), keep it handy. As you make this journey with PD, use this book as a
guide to the resources you’ll need along the way.
Carpe diem: Seize the day!
The overriding emotion you may feel early on is a sense that you’ve totally
lost control of your life. But you can only lose control if you surrender to 
it — if you choose to hand it over to someone else and simply follow other
people’s orders. There’s a better approach to PD for you and your care 
partner — one that gives you the best chance of living the life you planned
before the diagnosis.
Take charge of this thing — the same way you’d attack any other unlikely
event (like losing your job or your home being damaged by fire). Life can
hand you bigger problems than PD — really! Unlike people facing a terminal
illness, you have time and a reminder to be proactive and do what matters
most now, not some day.
Without going all the way to Pollyanna-mode, consider the advantages of a
can-do and optimistic outlook:
104
Part II: Making PD Part – But Not All – of Your Life 

 The very fact that time becomes more precious can instill the determi-
nation not to waste an hour or a day.
 Close relationships can be strengthened — marriages, parent-child con-
nections (yours as a parent and yours as the child of aging parents).
 Genuine and dedicated friends will stick; hangers-on will not (and you
may be surprised at who’s who in the bunch).
 New people — interesting and stimulating, understanding and fun —
come into your life.
 There’s nothing like a progressive illness to make you get off your butt,
take that trip, write that novel, or go back to school.
 You now have the opportunity to work with other people to make a real
difference in the lives of millions. How many people do you know who
can say that?
 In some ways you’re getting a fresh start — the chance to change you.
Suddenly you understand in a very real way that life is finite.
Staying on track in your career
A question that’s bound to be at the top of your mind is whether or not you
can continue working. On so many levels, your ability to pursue a career, run 
a business, or maintain financial security is integral to living the life you envi-
sioned. Be sure to read Chapter 16 for a full discussion of PD in the workplace.
One of the key messages you want to send to your employer, co-workers, and
yourself is that the prognosis of YOPD is good. With proper management of
PD symptoms through exercise, diet, and medications, your career can be
good to go for years to come. When your neurologist, physical therapist, and
nutritionist fully understand your job’s requirements, they can structure your
care plan (and timing of meds when you begin taking them) to provide opti-
mal function when you need it most.
Before you sit down with your employer to discuss your diagnosis and its
possible effects on your work, plan ahead by
 Exploring options such as flexible hours or telecommuting. If your
employer makes such options available to other employees (like new
parents or regular part-timers), then you’re not asking for special 
consideration.
 Thinking through the demands of your specific job and how to handle
them. Anticipate the questions (and doubts) your employer may have
about your ability to continue.
105
Chapter 8: Special Advice for Those with Young Onset Parkinson’s Disease

If you think it’s necessary, ask your neurologist to prepare a letter that
explains the status of your PD in relation to your work.
Stress can pack a double whammy when it comes to maintaining your job and
career because stress comes with the territory in many (make that most) jobs
and can do a real number on your YOPD symptoms. Take a look at Chapter 16
for ways to manage stressful situations in the workplace — this is a huge step
toward successfully maintaining your position for years to come.
Dealing with PD’s impact on relationships
Now that you have PD, your diagnosis can become the two-ton gorilla in the
room, sitting squarely between you and other people — if you let it. When
you fear that your lover, child, best friend, or co-worker can’t see you because
PD’s in the way, then take the initiative. Make sure these people remember
that you’re still you! By addressing PD issues that may affect your most
important relationships, you can remove that gorilla from the room.
Your role as a spouse or significant other
The roles you and your partner have settled into may undergo quite a make-
over as your PD progresses. Fortunately, this progression usually occurs over 
a period of years with ample time to adjust. But that delay doesn’t mean you
can’t or shouldn’t prepare for necessary changes. In other words, begin com-
municating now. Communication and patience are your best resources for
adapting later to these inevitable changes. These are some examples:
 If your tremor worsens and you’ve been chief handyperson for the
household, how’s that going to work out? Talk about ways that you can
manage the task with more time, or use this opportunity to teach a child
how to wield a hammer.
 If small, cramped handwriting is an early symptom of your PD and
you’re the lead check writer and bookkeeper, can that continue indefi-
nitely? Maybe you can pay bills online or install software to print out
checks that you only need to sign.
 If you’ve been the family’s gourmet cook but now you take hours longer to
turn out one of your signature meals, then you (and those around you)
need to practice patience by allowing for the extra time you need. Then
again, you may consider graciously (and willingly) accepting some help.
Don’t rush into changes before they’re necessary. Do take time to plan with
your partner the ways that you can adjust certain tasks or roles before you
give them up.

Part II: Making PD Part – But Not All – of Your Life 

As your symptoms progress and your medication timing switches unexpect-
edly into on-off mode, your spouse or significant other may find it tough to
believe you’re suddenly struggling with a task that you managed fine just a
minute earlier. Be honest about what’s going on. Acknowledge that it looks
like you don’t want to do this task, but — for now — you really can’t.
Communication and patience are paramount here!
Another common concern when you have YOPD is the question of intimacy.
Okay, to put it bluntly — you’re wondering about its impact on your ability 
to perform sexually. The answer: If you experience a change in your sexual
desire, performance, or pleasure, a host of underlying causes are possible.
Some of the more common ones are:
 Side effects of medications
 Effects of certain cardiovascular conditions (high blood pressure, circu-
latory problems, reduced blood flow, heart disease and such)
 Impact of other conditions such as urinary incontinence, menopause for
women, or prostate problems for men
 Effects of depression, stress, or anxiety
 Symptoms common to PD (tremor, stiffness, on-off episodes, dyskinesias
and such) that can affect movement (not to mention the mood!)
PD may cause sexual dysfunction, but this symptom usually occurs several
years into the progression of the disease, and other symptoms (including
those listed above) can play a role. Don’t simply assume that a change in
your desire for intimacy or ability to make love is a normal part of PD.
Solutions are available, so talk to your doctor and look at Chapter 19 for
more information on sexual dysfunction.
Intimacy means more than the act of making love. Think about the progres-
sion of your relationship. Maybe it began with flirting and progressed to the
sheer romance of the courtship before you two decided you were in this for
the long haul. Maybe you surprised your partner with an unexpected roman-
tic gesture — flowers for no reason, holding hands at the movies, the funny
card, or handwritten note. Rekindle those little moments that led to falling in
love and the commitment of a long-term (or even lifetime) relationship.
Maintain a sense of humor. Surely even at your healthiest you had those
moments — embarrassing, silly, laugh-out-loud times when it all went hay-
wire at a critical moment. Plan to roll with them. Shared laughter can be
incredibly sexy.

Your role as a parent
How life may change for you and your kids will depend on their ages when
you’re diagnosed. If they’re very young, you can keep the news simple and
guide your children as they grow up and your symptoms progress. By the time
they reach their middle or high school years, living with a parent who has PD
will seem so normal that it’ll be their friends’ parents who seem different.
If your children are older (middle or high school) when you’re diagnosed,
communication may be more difficult. At this age your children are dealing
with a lot already. They’re trying to locate their own sense of identity among
their peers and within the family unit, they’re trying to live up to adult expec-
tations, and they’re facing ever-escalating pressure to make the right choices.
No wonder they shut down sometimes!
Now you come along and deliver the news that you have PD — a disease they
may have heard about but one that they may have some real misinformation
on. Depending on their age and your relationship, your children may or may
not ask questions, but don’t assume that they have none. On the other hand,
dole out information carefully. You may hear “TMI!” (too much information)
from your teen when you start throwing around terms like bradykinesia, sub-
stantia nigra, and such.
If you have teens or middle-schoolers, you may want to ask for help in
researching information. They’re undoubtedly proficient on the computer. Give
them a focused PD topic to research and ask them to share it with the family.
For example, put them to work locating and bookmarking the best PD Web
sites for the family. What organizations can they find? What are the strengths of
each site? By proactively including your children in a management plan for
your PD, you take away a lot of their fear and distress that can come from
being left out of key discussions and decisions.
Your role as a friend
If you’re fortunate enough to have a network of close friends — even if that
network is only two or three people — you have a fabulous resource for
coping with your PD. Friends can listen when you really don’t want to burden
your spouse or significant other. And they can take your focus off PD to get
you back on the track of living the life you’d planned. Friends can make you
laugh and let you cry. They can push, shove, and irritate you until you’ll do
anything to get them off your case. They can admire your courage, wonder at
your ability to contain this beast, and celebrate each passage — just as they
did when you didn’t have PD, and just as you’ve done for them.
Friendship is a two-way street. Your friends can only be there if you let them,
and they’ll be there for the long term only if you let them know you’ll do the
same for them. For more ideas on PD and friendships, see Chapter 15.
108
Part II: Making PD Part – But Not All – of Your Life 

Your role as a co-worker/employee/employer
By some estimates, up to one-third of PWP (at any age) are actively employed.
As the news of your diagnosis spreads at work, your co-workers will probably
take one of two positions: Some will immediately come forward, express their
concern, and ask what they can do to help; others will pull back, take a let’s-
see-how-this-goes position.
As with all your relationships, this one is yours to manage. Frankly, your best
bet is to let people know that you have PD (after you’ve told your employer).
Otherwise the rumor mill is going to be the messenger. Consider sitting down
with members of your department (with your supervisor’s approval) to give
them some brief, basic facts about YOPD. You can then ask these co-workers
to use these facts to squelch rumors they may be hearing.
If you’re the employer (or department head), be aware of immediate
employee concerns for you and for themselves. What does your PD mean 
for the future of the business and their job security? Again carefully pre-
pare by anticipating questions and concerns (from good employees seeking
other positions or ambitious staffers eyeing your position) for you and your
business.
Whatever your job, you need to realistically assess (and reassess regularly
and frequently) your ability to handle the job. Your greatest barrier will be
stress, and the greatest stress comes when people around you clearly ques-
tion your ability to do the job. For ways you can address this problem and
the related challenges of PD in the workplace, see Chapter 16.
Your role in the community
Over time your PD becomes more and more difficult to disguise. Even if you
can manage the outward symptoms like a tremor or impaired movement, the
stress of trying to keep it a secret can drain you. But why expend so much
energy to keep people in the dark when they may become unexpected
sources for support and outright help?
Maintaining (or instigating) community relationships isn’t just about the per-
sonal returns. When you volunteer at your child’s school or join in for a char-
ity walk or bike event, you’re making a better world for others — and that’s
empowering. You’re not this poor PWP; you’re someone who chooses to take
advantage of an opportunity to make a real difference for yourself and the
community around you.
Speaking of community action, the Parkinson community — national, regional
and local — is well organized and a great place to get involved. By taking an
active role in advocating for more research dollars, better therapies, and
eventually a cure, you empower yourself and other PWP. Not a marcher or
109
Chapter 8: Special Advice for Those with Young Onset Parkinson’s Disease

the outspoken sort? Not a problem. Check out www.parkinsonaction.org
or any of the national organizations listed in the appendix of this book for
ways you can get involved behind the scenes.
The Dollars and Cents of YOPD 
Financial Planning
Definition of terrifying: The experience of a person in the prime of life getting
news that he has a chronic and progressively debilitating illness. Although
people with YOPD can hope for a cure in their lifetime, basing their financial
futures on such a pipedream is, unfortunately, unrealistic.
Realistically you’ll live with PD for many years to come, years that may
include getting married, raising a family, sending kids off to college, securing
the future for your partner, caring for aging parents — a host of emotional
and financial challenges. Our suggestion? Regardless of your economic status,
take your partner and get to a financial planner now (see Chapter 21 for tips
on choosing one) to help you plan for the future.
If you’re in debt now, you need a plan to manage that debt and end it as
quickly as possible. If you have plans for major financial commitments (such
as buying a car or home or sending your child to college), you need to ask
yourself whether such plans are still viable.
Financial planning is one of those tasks where preparing for the worst sce-
nario is the wisest move. You may ask, “But what if I never need to put the
plans in action?” The best answer is a different, more challenging question:
What if you do need to?
If you haven’t already done so, take time to ask the big questions:
 What are my current health insurance plan’s benefits?
 What hospitalization, disability benefits, and programs may be available
through my work?
 What are the benefits and limitations of the COBRA program if I have to
stop working?
 What long-term care insurance program can I (or my partner) benefit
from?
 Am I eligible for that program?
110
Part II: Making PD Part – But Not All – of Your Life 

If you have no insurance, talk to your financial planner immediately about
options that may be available in your state or through federal programs. If
the financial planner can’t answer your questions or provide information in a
timely manner, find another planner!
In addition to your financial planning, take the following measures to help
your medical providers:
111
Chapter 8: Special Advice for Those with Young Onset Parkinson’s Disease
Connecting with other YOPDers
“I have plenty of friends,” you say, “so I don’t
need to connect.” Oh, but you do. You have a
condition that usually strikes people decades
older than you. You have a chronic, progressive
condition that’s going to impact every facet of
your life. On top of that, you have this life — of
work and relationships and social events and
community functions and. . . . So, you’re going
to have times over the coming months and
years when the very person you need to talk
with is someone who understands what it
means to have YOPD, someone who’s been
there, who’s still there — someone who can tell
you to knock it off, stop wasting precious time,
and get on with your life when you start feeling
sorry for yourself.
So where can you find these people? If you’re
really fortunate, a YOPD support group is close
enough for you to conveniently attend meetings.
If it isn’t, then check with the facilitator of any PD
support group that meets in your area to see how
many of the participants have YOPD. If that fails,
ask your neurologist whether she treats other
YOPD patients. If she does, perhaps names and
contact information can be exchanged.
Your best resource may be the Internet. 
One established organization specifically for
YOPDers is Movers and Shakers at www.
pdadvocates.org The Parkinson Action
Network at www.parkinsonsaction.
org is another great place to connect with
PWP of all ages. The National Parkinson Foun-
dation at www.parkinson.org sponsors 
an annual conference for YOPDers and their
families. In addition, chat rooms and other sites
offer people with YOPD a chance to connect —
even in the wee hours of the morning. Two such
sites are www.braintalk.org and www.
plwp.org.
The point is that you (and your care partner) can
connect with others your age that understand
and have experienced or are experiencing
many of the same frustrations you are. Your
friends and family members may be terrific —
supportive and concerned — but how can they
possibly understand the full impact of YOPD?
Not even your neurologist can fully appreciate
what it means to have PD in the prime of your
life.
Connecting with YOPDers isn’t about giving up
on friendships that have sustained you (and that
still sustain you). But connecting with other
YOPDers can lessen your sense of isolation and
provide you with resources and news to
manage your symptoms in a variety of situa-
tions. Another person with YOPD may not
become your new best friend — but then again,
don’t rule out the possibility.

 Establish a durable power of attorney for healthcare decisions as well as
financial decisions.
 Write a living will or advance directive; make sure you distribute copies
to every doctor who treats you and carry a copy with you in case you
need to go to the hospital or emergency room.
 Be sure that the people you appoint to speak for you know what you
want them to say and do!
For a more detailed discussion of legal and financial concerns that need your
attention sooner rather than later, turn to Chapter 20.
A Word for the PD Care Partner
When you discover that someone you love has a condition that takes that
person’s functions and abilities, your instinct may be to go into full caregiver-
mode and take charge. Please resist that urge! The person you love is exactly
the same person that he was before the diagnosis. PD doesn’t change a
person overnight. In fact, the changes are gradual enough for the two of you
to take the time to adapt, prepare, and plan.
But you don’t want to run away either. Throughout this book we talk about
the fight-or-flight response to tough situations. If you’re a person who takes
flight (backs away and finds reasons to become disengaged), then you need
to reassess that instinct. The person you love and are devoted to needs 
you — your support and understanding — in the early going, and she may
eventually need more of you as her spokesperson and advocate.
If you’re a fighter (a person who takes charge or refuses to lose), you may
need to dial it down a notch or two. Although you’re the care partner, the
operative word is partner. You’re not in charge; you don’t have YOPD.
Contribute and discuss options — yes. Coax and encourage — absolutely.
Defend your right to a life beyond your partner’s PD — positively. But in the
final analysis, the person with PD has the right (as well as the ability) to
decide how she wants to face this challenge. It’s called patient autonomy and
it’s the very foundation of medical ethics.

Part III
Crafting a
Treatment Plan
Just for You

In this part . . .
You can explore the variety of options available to
treat your PD and help manage symptoms. These
include medications and surgery as well as complemen-
tary and alternative medical treatments. Our chapter on
diet and exercise includes an illustrated program of
stretching and strengthening exercises that you can take
to your doctor or physical therapist for review. Finally we
have a chapter on clinical trials where we discuss the pros
and cons of participating in such projects and what you
need to know before you make a commitment.

Chapter 9
Managing PD Symptoms with
Prescription Medicines
In This Chapter
 Grasping the lowdown on meds for PD’s motor symptoms
 Minimizing those non-motor symptoms
 Getting (and staying!) squared away on your meds
Your Parkinson’s disease (PD) diagnosis will include treatment options
for managing your symptoms. If you have no symptoms of functional dis-
ability at the time of your diagnosis (in other words, if the PD isn’t interfering
with your ability to live your normal life), then your doctor will most likely
prescribe programs like exercise and nutrition counseling, a support group,
and, of course, regular visits to his office to monitor symptoms and any signs
of progression.
As your symptoms begin to affect your work, social, and routine activities,
your doctor will likely add pharmacologic therapy (prescription medications)
to the treatment plan. In this chapter, we look at the most common medica-
tions for managing symptoms, some that have been around for decades and
others that are relatively new to the scene. We also pass along some sugges-
tions for staying on top of your medication regimen.
Because PD has no cure at this time and there is no means of preventing its
progression, the treatment goal is to manage the symptoms, postpone their
progression, and minimize the onset of new symptoms for as long as possible.
Managing Motor Symptoms with 
Proven Prescription Medication
In managing your symptoms, your doctor may prescribe a variety of medica-
tions to help prolong your current level of function. The medication may be

available only as a brand-name drug (meaning it’s still under patent protec-
tion), or it may be available in the generic form (meaning the patent has
expired). Brand drugs are usually newer, more expensive, and possibly more
beneficial than generics.
All medications for PD have one goal: to restore brain concentration of
dopamine to near-normal levels. To achieve this goal, your doctor may pre-
scribe one or more pills with different mechanisms of action (similar to differ-
ent foods that we routinely use to restore sugar levels in our body, such as
pasta, fruit, and sweets). The number of pills doesn’t necessarily correlate to
the gravity of the disease!
Almost 40 years after its introduction, the combination of levodopa and car-
bidopa (usually prescribed under the brand name Sinemet) is still the preferred
treatment for most people with Parkinson’s (PWP). The following sections
cover the components of this medication and the role each one plays.
L-dopa — The gold standard
The most effective prescription medication to date for controlling PD symp-
toms is levodopa (often abbreviated to L-dopa), which brain cells use to pro-
duce more dopamine, the neurotransmitter that PD reduces. Producing more
dopamine permits relief for PD symptoms such as stiffness, tremor (shaking),
facial mask, cramped handwriting, slow movement, and impaired gait 
(walking).
Historically, L-dopa was administered alone, which caused a whole list of side
effects including nausea, loss of appetite, vomiting, lowered blood pressure
(leading to dizziness and possible falls), and rapid heart rate. Because these
side effects were so significant, researchers almost dropped L-dopa from the
regimen before they discovered the advantages of prescribing it with its now-
conventional partner, carbidopa. Coupled with carbidopa, L-dopa can almost
completely control PD symptoms for a honeymoon period of two to eight years.
Unfortunately, 50 percent of PWP develop motor complications after 5 years
of levodopa therapy; virtually all of them experience a decline in the benefit
of levodopa after 10 to 15 years of therapy.
Carbidopa — L-dopa’s companion
Any time the treatment seems worse than the condition, researchers look for
ways to make the treatment more palatable for the patient. Carbidopa’s main
116
Part III: Crafting a Treatment Plan Just for You 

purpose is to offset the serious and uncomfortable side effects of levodopa
without causing side effects of its own. In addition, carbidopa
 Allows your system to absorb the essential vitamin B6
 Lessens the amount of levodopa you need to control symptoms
When your symptoms do require medication, the prescription will probably be
a low dose of carbidopa/levodopa. The prescription includes two numbers —
usually 25/100. The first number refers to the amount of carbidopa and the
second is the amount of levodopa. Your doctor monitors your symptoms on
this low dose (usually taken at regular intervals three to four times a day). If
you experience side effects, he can double the amount of carbidopa in your
prescription. As the symptoms of PD progress, your doctor may increase the
dosage and shorten the periods between doses.
Two other formulations for this medication are:
 The controlled-release (CR) form of Sinemet, which prolongs the effect
of levodopa
 The orally disintegrating tablet (ODT) form of carbidopa/levodopa
(brand name Parcopa)
With ODT delivery systems, you place the tablet on your tongue and it
melts (like a mint) in a matter of seconds without water.
Entacapone — Another 
bodyguard for L-dopa
Recently a new class of drugs, catechol-O-methyl transferase inhibitors 
(COMT-I), has been added to PD therapy. COMT-I blocks the enzyme 3-O-
methyldopa and allows even more levodopa to reach the brain. (Imagine lev-
odopa with two body guards — carbidopa and entacapone or tolcapone (see
the following paragraph) — to shelter it from dangerous enzymes on its jour-
ney toward the brain.) Other advantages of adding COMT-I to L-dopa are
 Longer duration of the L-dopa effectiveness
 Potential for reducing the dosage of carbidopa/levodopa
 The possibility of managing off times more effectively (See “Tracking the
on-off fluctuations of your meds” later in this chapter.)
Entacapone (brand name Stalevo) is a new L-dopa therapy that combines the
COMPT-I with carbidopa/levodopa. This three-in-one combination makes
117
Chapter 9: Managing PD Symptoms with Prescription Medicines

dosing easier because you take one pill, not two. Another COMT-I, tolcapone
(brand name Tasmar), is available but has some limitations associated with
liver toxicity.
Other effective prescription medicines
Your doctor may prescribe other medications in addition to your carbidopa/
levodopa to better manage your symptoms. We cover the most common
classes of these companion drugs in the following sections.
Dopamine agonists (DA)
Unlike levodopa, which is transformed into dopamine, dopamine agonists
(DA) imitate the characteristics of dopamine. Your doctor may recommend
that you try a DA before prescribing Sinemet as a first-line treatment in order
to delay the complications associated with the use of levodopa over the long
haul. (See the previous section “L-dopa — the gold standard” for more about
Sinemet.) DAs have been in use for two decades with proven effectiveness in
treating PD symptoms. But their use may be limited by troubling side effects,
such as daytime sleepiness, low blood pressure, edema (swollen feet), vivid
dreams, and, on occasion, hallucinations.
Four dopamine agonists are available. Older generation drugs (bromocriptine
and pergolide) are rarely used because of possible cardiac side effects. But
newer generations of DAs (including pramipexole and ropinirole) offer effec-
tive management of symptoms with relatively fewer side effects.
Of the four DA medications available, studies haven’t proven one to be more
effective than another. Therefore, if you have an unfavorable response to 
one DA, ask your doctor about trying a different one to see whether it’s more
successful.
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI)
This class of drugs works by interacting with monoamines, chemicals in the
brain that transmit messages between nerve cells. Of the three monoamines
(dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine), dopamine is the focus for PWP
because it controls messages related to movement.
Although MAOI has two subtypes (Type A and Type B), only MAOI-B is used to
treat PD. Its fundamental task is to inhibit the oxidation (burning) of dopamine,
which clears the dopamine from the synaptic space (the tiny space between
brain cells where chemical messages are exchanged). As a consequence, 
more dopamine is available and PD symptoms improve. Interestingly, MAOI-B
may provide an additional benefit by acting as a kind of neuroprotector (see
Chapter 2), possibly slowing the progression of PD and delaying the need for
carbidopa/levodopa therapy.
118
Part III: Crafting a Treatment Plan Just for You 

The original drug from this group is selegiline, which doctors still prescribe
for the early stages of PD because it provides some control of PD symptoms.
A new formula of orally disintegrating selegiline (Zelapar) has recently been
introduced with a lower incidence of side effects and a once-a-day dosing
schedule. The most recent drug in this class to receive FDA approval is rasag-
iline (brand name Azilect), also taken once a day for the treatment of early
PD. For PWP in the moderate to advanced stages, a combination of selegiline
and L-dopa can improve symptoms.
The downside to MAOIs is their potentially serious effect on blood pressure,
especially when the patient is taking other medicines that also affect blood
pressure. Take these precautions to avoid serious problems:
 Be sure all doctors know you’re on this medication and always check
with your pharmacist before using:
• Over-the-counter (OTC) products such as cold-cough remedies
(especially those including dextromethorphan) and diet supplements
• Prescription medicines such as antidepressants that increase sero-
tonin levels
 If you’re scheduled for surgery, be sure the anesthesiologist knows
you’re taking rasagiline because anesthesia combined with the MAOIs
can cause a dangerous drop in blood pressure.
 Be aware that MAOIs can cause abnormalities of blood pressure known
as tyramine (or cheese effect) when the patient is eating aged cheese or
drinking red wine.
Consult your doctor if you have additional questions about the serious side
effects of MAOIs.
119
Chapter 9: Managing PD Symptoms with Prescription Medicines
Transdermal patch — A new delivery system
In most cases, prescribed medications come in
a tablet or capsule form. But researchers are
working on other ways to get the drug into your
system with improved effectiveness, fewer side
effects, and a shorter waiting period before the
drug takes effect.
As one example of such research, at this writing
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is in the
process of reviewing a transdermal (skin) patch
for the delivery of rotigotine, a dopamine ago-
nist. You apply the patch to your skin (back,
shoulder, or abdomen) once a day. The advan-
tage of the patch is its consistent delivery of
medication throughout the day. Consistent
delivery of the dopamine agonist helps smooth
out the amount of medicine you receive unlike
the peaks and valleys that occur when taking
tablets or capsules multiple times each day.
This new method may improve symptom control
and reduce side effects. Patches for the deliv-
ery of levodopa are also under study.

Amantadine
Amantadine is another older medication that doctors occasionally prescribe
in early stages of PD because it can provide some benefit before levodopa is
needed. Exactly how amantadine helps relieve symptoms isn’t clear. In fact, it
was originally (and continues to be) a treatment for the flu, but scientists
serendipitously stumbled on its potential PD benefits. Most recently doctors
have noted amantadine’s benefits in managing dyskinesia (the writhing, twist-
ing of the body) that may occur after long-term levodopa therapy.
Keeping the names straight
Your doctor has a growing arsenal of medications with which to treat your PD
symptoms. Table 9-1 provides a handy reference for their generic and brand

Treating Non-Motor PD Symptoms
PWP must deal with a whole range of symptoms — only some of which
involve movement. In the chapters that follow, we discuss in detail the PD
symptoms of depression and anxiety and symptoms that may occur as your
PD progresses. (See Chapters 13 and 19.) However, if any of the following non-
motor symptoms become disruptive to your routine and life, talk to your
doctor about medications that may be helpful:
 Dizziness or changes in blood pressure when you stand after lying
down or sitting: Report this to your doctor! Treatment may include
changes in habits (such as increasing fluid intake or wearing support
stockings) or a change in medications.
 Increased saliva or swallowing problems: Again, your doctor needs to
know about this because it may be a side effect of a medication or it may
be the progression of your PD. Either way, don’t ignore it!
 Sleep disturbances: The disease itself and some of your antiparkinson-
ian meds can cause sleep disturbance. Ask your doctor whether a sleep
aid may be helpful. In some cases where sleep disturbances are espe-
cially troublesome, a more specific sleep study may be indicated.
 Pain, cramping, or dyskinesia: These symptoms are often worse at
night or bedtime. A change in your evening dose of Sinemet (higher 
or lower) may solve the problem, or ask your doctor whether anti-
inflammatories (such as ibuprofen), muscle relaxants, or dopamine 
agonists may help.
 Nausea, stomach upset, constipation, and heartburn: These symptoms
may be part and parcel of your medication routine. Talk to your doctor
about when, how often, and to what degree of discomfort these symp-
toms occur.
 Urinary frequency or urgency: Conditions other than your PD (such as
prostate hypertrophy) may be at play here. Talk to your doctor if you
experience any change in urinary habits, especially if you experience
pain or any sort of discharge with urinating.
121
Chapter 9: Managing PD Symptoms with Prescription Medicines

If you’re seeing another doctor or taking medication for high blood pressure
or another chronic condition, be sure your neurologist and all doctors con-
sult with each other before prescribing new meds for you.
Using Your Medication 
Safely and Effectively
As a person with PD, you need to pay close attention to your medication
timing and dosing. You also need to be aware of changes in performance and
function (mental or physical), especially if such changes seem to relate to
your medication routine. In short, you need to
 Take an active role in monitoring your medications and the results you
get (or don’t get) from them.
 Inform your doctor and pharmacist of any side effects, new symptoms,
or worsening of current symptoms.
This section covers the important ways you can work with your doctors 
and pharmacist to maintain a healthy regimen with your meds. We also pass
along some advice for keeping track of your meds and their effectiveness
with your PD symptoms.
Partnering with your doctor 
and pharmacist
Work with your neurologist to review all your medications from time to time.
Be sure to include any OTC products you take regularly. And remember to
pay special attention to any dosing changes or new prescription meds
another doctor may have ordered.
When your neurologist and other doctors write a new prescription for you,
ask the following questions:
 Why are you prescribing this medication at this time?
 What results should I expect after I begin taking this medication?
 How soon should I expect positive results?
 How should I take the medication — timing, dosing, with (or without)
food and so on?
 What side effects might I experience?
122
Part III: Crafting a Treatment Plan Just for You 

 What side effects should I notify my doctor about immediately?
 What side effects would require me to get to an emergency room or 
call 911?
 What does the medication cost?
 Can I get the same benefits a less expensive way?
For example, Stalevo is convenient but can be expensive. Taking Sinemet
and Comtan separately may save money.
 Are any interactions possible between the new medication and other
prescription or OTC meds that I’m already taking?
When you get the medication the first time, be sure the pharmacist prints out
and reviews the prescribing information sheet with you. (If you don’t have a
regular pharmacist, ask your neurologist to recommend pharmacies in your
area that she respects and communicates well with.)
Before you leave the pharmacy:
 Ask questions if anything on the information sheet raises a red flag
for you. For example, if a side effect of the new med is low blood pres-
sure and you’re taking medication to manage high blood pressure, how
will the new drug affect it?
 Check the label to be sure you can read it and that you have received
the right medication according to your doctor’s instructions. If a sub-
stitution has been made (a generic for the brand your doctor pre-
scribed, for example), ask the pharmacist to call the doctor to be sure
the switch is okay.
 Open the package and look at the medicine, especially if it’s a refill. If
the pill or tablet doesn’t look like the med you’ve been taking, immedi-
ately bring that question to your pharmacist’s attention.
123
Chapter 9: Managing PD Symptoms with Prescription Medicines
Keeping the costs of meds under control
If the cost of your medications is overwhelming,
you may be eligible to receive some of your pre-
scription medications for a reduced cost or
even for free. The American Parkinson Disease
Association (APDA) partners with a coali-
tion of health providers, pharmaceutical com-
panies, patient advocacy groups, and other
organizations to help you get the medicine you
need. Call 888-477-2669 or go online to www.
pparx.org for full details on eligibility. You
can also check with your state Office on Aging
or go to www.benefitscheckup.org or
www.needymeds.com for more information.

Mixing prescription and OTC medications
Pick up any magazine these days and you’ll likely find an article touting the
advantages of some herbal supplement or vitamin. Or maybe a friend recom-
mends some OTC product for your heartburn, headache, or cold symptoms.
The question is: How will these commonly used products interact with your
prescription meds — especially your antiparkinsonian meds?
Anyone who takes a prescription medication to manage or treat a chronic ill-
ness needs to vigilantly read labels on all OTC as well as prescription prod-
ucts for potential interactions. Call the primary care physician or neurologist
and talk to the pharmacist before taking the meds to let these professionals
help you decide if this med is right for you.
Common signs of potentially dangerous drug interaction include accelerated
or slower heart rate, diarrhea or constipation, heartburn, nausea or cramp-
ing, fever, skin rashes or unusual bruising, dizziness, confusion, loss of
appetite, or abnormal fatigue. If you experience any such side effects, contact
your doctor. If side effects are severe — or a doctor is unavailable — call 911
or get to an emergency room.
Note: Ask your doctor whether grapefruit juice can have an effect on your
medications. Studies have shown that grapefruit juice can interfere with the
liver’s ability to break down some medicines — especially prescription drugs.
Balancing the benefits of medications against their potential side effects is
delicate. In partnership with your doctor, determine what combination works
best for your lifestyle and quality of life. The goal is to keep you in control —
as opposed to under the control — of your meds and your PD.
Setting up a routine for 
managing your meds
Being human, we have a tendency to ignore or bend the rules, especially
when it comes to faithfully following a medication regimen. We skip doses,
miss the timing by a couple of hours, cut the dose to save money, and even
share prescription meds with other people (because it did so much good 
for us).
With PD, taking medicine and taking it in the prescribed and timely manner is
critical. And, because you probably take more than one medication for PD
(not to mention the meds you may take for other conditions such as high
blood pressure), timing is indeed everything.
124
Part III: Crafting a Treatment Plan Just for You 

As your PD progresses, you may experience memory problems, so it’s enor-
mously important that you figure out now how you’re going to remember to
take your meds. This section offers suggestions for both organizing your
medication regimen and remembering it.
Three keys to avoid problems with your medications:
 Make sure one (and only one) doctor (your neurologist is the best
choice) oversees all your medications, including OTC vitamins, supple-
ments, or herbal remedies.
 Choose one pharmacy (or one pharmacy chain that maintains your
records regardless of where you are) to fill all your prescriptions.
 Take a list — if not the actual meds — to every doctor’s appointment
(including dentists, podiatrists, and so on) and to the hospital or emer-
gency room if you need to go there. 
Hospitals use several medications to combat nausea following anes-
thetic that are contraindicated (or not to be used) for PWP. These drugs
not only worsen PD symptoms but can actually produce Parkinson-like
symptoms in people with no diagnosis of PD. For a complete list of these
drugs, see the Cheat Sheet in front of the book.
You also need to get organized at home — where you most likely take your
meds. You’ve probably seen or even used those plastic pill-containers that
organize meds by day (or even by dose throughout the day). Some of these
containers come with a beeper that signals the time for a dose. Other vari-
eties have large sections to accommodate several pills or larger pills.
Consult with your pharmacist on the best choice in medication organizers for
your purposes. Think about your daily activities:
 Are you home all the time?
If you are, then one large, multi-sectioned container may be a good
choice.
 Are you at work when one dose comes due?
Then a smaller pocket container or one with the reminder alarm is a
good choice for that dose.
Establish a regular time (the same time and day every week) for loading the
meds into the proper container. Then place the container(s) in the most obvi-
ous place to remind you. (For example, you may want your morning and bed-
time meds next to your toothbrush.)
125
Chapter 9: Managing PD Symptoms with Prescription Medicines

Tracking the on-off fluctuations 
of your meds
As if multiple motor, cognitive, and other symptoms of PD aren’t enough, the
common PD medications can also affect the course of the disease. Read any
PD article or get into a discussion with any PD patient or care partner, and
sooner or later you hear the terms wearing off and on-off.
The wearing-off effect may appear when the PWP has been on the same dosage
for some time. Over time, the positive effect of the med simply wears off before
the next dose. In that window between the end-of-dose benefit and the delivery
of the next dose, the PWP may experience heightened symptoms of PD, such as
tremors, difficulties with balance and coordination, and so on. Such incidents
commonly occur after a relatively long honeymoon, when the antiparkinsonian
meds effectively control the symptoms. The usual solution is to shorten the
time between doses, increase the dose, and/or add other meds. 
The on-off phenomenon (which is fairly unique to PD) refers to the PWP’s
ability to perform common physical activities one minute and then be totally
incapable the next minute, all within the same dosing cycle. Another way of
looking at this phenomenon is that the wearing off effect loses its predictabil-
ity so PD symptoms emerge without warning. Some PWP actually refer to the
sensation as someone flipping a switch. Usually this effect occurs when the
PD is in the advanced stages.
We recommend that you track your on-off fluctuations after they begin by
noting the following and reporting your findings to your doctor:
 The time the meds start wearing off in relation to your next scheduled
dose of medicine.
 The exact symptoms that reappear.
 The frequency of the off-period. Is it every dose or just now and then? If
it’s now and then, is there a recurring pattern?
Finally, dyskinesia (involuntary movements) is another treatment-related
symptom that may become apparent as the disease progresses. Movements
may range from dance-like to irregular and jerky motions, and they usually
occur when the medication dose is at its height.
For friends and family, this seemingly random ability of the PWP to act
normal one minute and need help the next minute may appear calculated, to
gather sympathy or manipulate other people. But the cause is simply not
known. Recent theories link the continued loss of dopamine-producing cells
and years of drug therapy as a possible cause. Both the PWP as well as family
and friends must understand that this on-off effect isn’t within the PWP’s con-
trol, isn’t a deliberate attempt to gain sympathy, and may not respond to a
change in the medication routine.

In This Chapter

 Checking out the advances in surgical options
 Stepping through the deep brain stimulation process
 R & R: Life with your DBS
A
s Parkinson’s disease (PD) progresses, medications often lose their
effectiveness; sometimes they cause, rather than alleviate, problems 
for the patient. In these instances, surgery may bring much-needed relief and
even restore some level of normalcy to the patient’s functions and life for
many years. In this chapter, we explore current surgical procedures and raise
the important questions for you to ask before deciding to proceed.
Deciding Whether You’re 
a Candidate for Surgery
First things first: Of the many people with Parkinson’s (PWP), which ones are
more likely candidates for surgery? The following questions are a general
guide to help you understand your chances for a successful outcome from
surgery.
 Have you successfully used antiparkinsonian medications (primarily 
L-dopa therapy) for several years?
 In spite of an optimal medication regimen, are you experiencing increas-
ing freezing episodes (sudden difficulty in moving), on-off fluctuations
(shortened time between response to meds and time for next dose), and
dyskinesia (twisting motion — a major side effect of taking the
antiparkinsonian meds)?
 Is your tremor so severe that medication can’t control it?

Of course, your age, past medical history, and general health are always con-
siderations before deciding to undergo surgery, but you’re more likely to ben-
efit from surgery if you answered “Yes” to all of the above questions.
Note: Unfortunately, PWP whose main issues involve cognitive loss, impaired
balance that doesn’t respond to L-dopa, poor speech (dysarthria), or swallow-
ing problems (dysphagia) are less likely to be helped by surgery.
Even if you appear to be a prime candidate, you have a great deal to consider
before deciding whether surgery’s right for you. Most importantly, remember
that you may experience relief — even significant relief — of some symptoms,
but your PD will progress. In particular, symptoms that surgery can’t address
(such as autonomic dysfunction or cognitive decline) may still be a factor in
the progression of your PD.
On the other hand, if certain symptoms (like tremor, bradykinesia, dyskine-
sia, rigidity, and on-off fluctuations) have begun to rule your life, surgery may
buy you some much-needed relief and time to enjoy a higher quality of life.
This isn’t a decision you or your doctor should make lightly.
Weighing Your Surgical Options
At this writing, surgical options for treating PD are virtually limited to deep
brain stimulation or DBS (see section below). But scientists continue to seek
new procedures that may prove more effective in controlling symptoms or
stopping them altogether, allowing the patient to remain symptom-free for a
period of time. (See the sidebar “Stem Cell Research: The Controversy” later
in this chapter.)
Deep brain stimulation (DBS)
The new standard for surgical treatment is a process called deep brain stimu-
lation. Since the FDA approved DBS in 2002, over 25,000 PWP have had the
procedure. In addition, DBS can effectively treat other neurological condi-
tions such as essential tremor and dystonia (See Chapter 4 for more informa-
tion.) Follow-up studies have shown consistent benefits for up to five years.
However given the relatively recent introduction of DBS to PD therapy, the
long-term safety and effectiveness of this procedure is still being studied.
According to a 2004 report from the University of Florida Movement Disorders
Center, of 174 PWP referred to the center as candidates for DBS, only eight
met the criteria that indicated they could benefit from the procedure. Proper
screening by a medical team experienced in DBS is essential.
128
Part III: Crafting a Treatment Plan Just for You 

During the DBS procedure, a specially trained surgeon implants a neurostimu-
lator (a battery-operated device similar to a pacemaker) to send electrical
stimulation to those areas of the brain that control movement. The proce-
dure follows these steps:
1. The surgeon drills a small hole in the skull and then inserts an electrode
(called a lead), positioning it in a targeted area of the brain.
2. The surgeon then inserts an implantable neurostimulator (sometimes
called a pulse generator or IPG), or battery pack, under the skin in the
area of your collarbone.
3. In a procedure that takes place two to four weeks after the implant of the
lead, a thin, insulated wire (called the extension) connects the battery
pack to the lead.
4. Your neurostimulator is then programmed to send signals appropriate to
your individual condition and symptoms. (Several sessions may be nec-
essary to get the programming right for you.)
Advantages of DBS include:
 The possibility to tune the device at any time in order to maximize bene-
fits and minimize side effects
 A significant reduction in the amount of medication you need
 Significant relief from the troublesome side effects (such as dyskinesia)
of those medicines
 The possibility of reversing the procedure in the future if a new, more
promising procedure becomes available
Downsides of DBS include the following:
 This is still brain surgery with potentially severe — though rare when
DBS experts perform the surgery — complications, including the poten-
tial for brain hemorrhage (bleeding).
 DBS isn’t intended to stop the progression of your PD, although long-
term studies are needed to clarify the long-term benefits of DBS.
 Two significant factors you must consider are cost and proximity to the
center where the procedure is performed.
Find out in advance whether your insurance covers the cost of DBS. Also
make plans for making the trips to and from the DBS center for follow-up
visits.
129
Chapter 10: When Surgery Is an Option

Lesion procedures
Procedures such as pallidotomy and thalamotomy were the earliest surgical
procedures to relieve PD symptoms.
 Pallidotomy destroys (or lesions) the globus pallidus (a part of the brain
that becomes overactive in PD) in an effort to restore movement control.
 Thalamotomy is a similar surgery aimed at controlling tremor by surgi-
cally destroying a selected portion of the brain’s thalamus.
Despite some encouraging results in the 1980s and 1990s, doctors recom-
mend these lesion surgeries much less frequently today because benefits
tend to regress after five years. In addition, serious side effects (such as diffi-
culty in speaking, poor balance, and cognitive dysfunction) are possible,
especially if the surgery is on both sides of the brain. Unlike DBS, these pro-
cedures are not reversible and will probably prevent the patient from taking
advantage of more effective surgeries in the future.
However, for a small number of patients, this procedure may be more appro-
priate. Candidates include patients with poor access to programming and
continued follow up after DBS, patients with higher risk of infections from a
foreign body, and patients that — for one reason or another — can’t have a
stimulator.
Gamma knife surgery
Gamma knife surgery is an alternative technique for pallidotomies and thalamo-
tomies in PWPs. Not a knife at all, the gamma knife is actually a machine that
uses powerful, focused beams of radiation to precisely target the specific area
of the brain. The procedure is usually on an outpatient basis, takes under an
hour, and uses only local anesthetic. According to a study from Emory Univer-
sity in Atlanta, although lasting benefits in some patients have been reported,
gamma knife surgery may have a higher complication rate than has previously
been indicated due to delayed onset and under-reporting of changes.
Looking to the future: 
Surgical possibilities
Scientists are working on improvements to DBS, focusing on such details as a
smaller and longer-lasting battery pack or a battery pack in the electrode so
everything operates as one unit in the scalp. Another possibility is providing
branch leads in the stimulator that network to various parts of the brain that
control movements.
130
Part III: Crafting a Treatment Plan Just for You 

Beyond DBS, researchers hope to prevent, stop, or even reverse the death of
dopamine-producing cells through advances in gene therapy and cell regenera-
tion. (See the sidebar in this section, “Stem cell research: The controversy.”)
Undergoing Deep Brain Stimulation
Brain surgery is pretty scary, but it certainly places a whole new light on
managing PD’s symptoms and living a full and functional life for as long as
possible. Keep in mind that this surgery is elective — it’s your call, not the
doctor’s.
Note: Because DBS has virtually replaced all previous types of surgeries to
treat PD, we focus on it in the remaining pages of this chapter.
131
Chapter 10: When Surgery Is an Option
Stem cell research: The controversy
Until scientists can prevent the loss of or repair
damage to dopamine-producing brain cells, PD
will continue to be a chronic and progressive
disease. This is where the controversial topic of
stem cell research comes into play. Actor
Christopher Reeve was an outspoken and tire-
less advocate for stem cell research, believing
it was the only hope for people with brain or
spinal injuries. Other spokespeople in favor of
stem cell research include former first lady
Nancy Reagan for Alzheimer’s disease, Mary
Tyler Moore for juvenile diabetes, and of course,
Michael J. Fox for PD.
The debate is not only scientific but ethical.
Scientists have ample evidence that cell trans-
plantation may be the key to curing or preven-
tively treating millions of people suffering from
various conditions. In a nutshell, stem cell
research focuses on transplanting renewable
cells to replace lost or damaged cells due to
problems such as chronic and progressive con-
ditions, brain or spinal injuries, and the like.
However, as researchers begin using human
subjects to test the cell-transplant models
already proven in animals, the need for a
renewable supply of stem cells from human
fetuses creates a heated debate.
Opponents’ primary argument is that these cells
are part of a viable fetus; therefore taking them
is the same as aborting a human life. Further,
they argue that scientists have no real evidence
that cell transplants will work, especially in 
diseases like PD, where the root cause is
unknown. People in favor of stem cell research
argue that stem cell research isn’t limited to
finding cures; it focuses on the larger arena of
understanding, preventing, and treating disease
more effectively.
Scott Stern, associate professor of manage-
ment and strategy at Northwestern University’s
Kellogg School of Management sums it up this
way: “To stop stem cell research now because
there are no immediate applications would be
like stopping work on transistors in 1947 when
their main application was considered as a
potential hearing aid.”

www.michaeljfox.org.

Asking the right questions before DBS
Regardless of what your doctor tells you, this decision is yours to make. So
take time to educate yourself (and your family), and consider this surgery
from all points of view.
Before making a decision, take advantage of the following suggestions:
 Read the literature your doctor offers, and educate yourself fully about
the procedure, the benefits, and the risks. Get written information about
possible complications and risks. A primary question to ask is, “Can DBS
make my PD worse?”
 Meet with your neurologist and the neurosurgeon. As with any potential
surgery, ask questions and expect definitive answers about the risks and
worst case scenario. (For example, less than 5 percent of patients will
experience serious complications, such as stroke or bleeding, from DBS
surgery, but a slightly higher percentage may develop an infection at the
implantation sites.)
 Ask the neurosurgeon what percentage of his total practice are DBS 
procedures. Also ask whether the surgeon has ever been sued for mal-
practice related to a DBS procedure and how many procedures he has
performed.
 Ask the neurosurgeon who will follow up with you after the implant.
Does he collaborate with an experienced programmer and movement-
disorder specialist to manage the settings on your neurostimulator? Is
he part of an established DBS program or does he work on his own?
 Ask your neurologist (or your support-group facilitator) to introduce
you to two other patients who have had the procedure — at least one 
of whom is a few years postsurgery. Talk to those patients about their
experiences before, during, and after the surgery.
If you decide to go forward after weighing all the pros and cons of surgery,
read on so you and your family know what to expect.
Passing the presurgical tests
Before your procedure can be scheduled, you need to pass several presurgi-
cal tests. These tests are fairly standardized and usually include a general
medical examination to be sure you’re healthy enough to endure the stresses
132
Part III: Crafting a Treatment Plan Just for You 

of surgery; neuropsychological testing to be sure you don’t have dementia
and are emotionally and mentally prepared; brain imaging tests (such as an
MRI or CT scan); and the usual blood tests, electrocardiogram, chest X-ray,
and such.
Ironing out the details
After successful preliminary testing, the next step is scheduling the proce-
dure. DBS is never an emergency, so the surgery date should be based on 
the surgeon’s schedule and availability but also on your (and your family’s)
convenience.
Before the doctors get to work on your brain, cover the following two issues:
 Everyone involved in the surgery and postsurgical care needs to be
aware of your medications (for PD and anything else). Be sure a clear
plan is in place for managing all your medications (including those for
other conditions, such as high blood pressure or diabetes) during post-
surgical care and throughout your recovery.
See the Cheat Sheet inside the front cover for a list of common post-
surgery drugs that can be a real problem for PWP in the postsurgical
recovery period.
 Make sure your family knows when and where they can expect to see
the doctor following surgery.
Knowing what to expect during 
and after surgery
Okay, everyone’s in place and ready to go. The day of surgery isn’t too pleas-
ant, but then surgery’s rarely a walk in the park.
For three to six hours, you’ll be under local (or possibly no) anesthetic, off
your medication, aware of your surroundings and the doctors, and experienc-
ing the full range of your PD symptoms. The good news is that you’ll be so
integrally involved in the procedure — answering questions from the surgeon
and other people as they work — that you’ll probably be less aware of the
discomfort than you imagine. (Prior to surgery, your doctor can provide
printed information and a full description of the procedure).
133
Chapter 10: When Surgery Is an Option

Because DBS requires precise work, your head will be in a helmet-like con-
traption that attaches to your skull and the operating table to ensure that
your head remains still throughout the procedure. (Sounds like something
out of a sci-fi or horror movie, but in most cases, the only complaint is a post-
surgery headache.)
The steps necessary to implant the neurostimulator are precise and demand-
ing. Fortunately modern technology has special brain-imaging equipment that
permits your surgeon to calculate the precise coordinates of the targeted area
deep in the brain. In addition, most centers proceed to map your brain activity
by recording the electrical activity of different groups of cells encountered
during the journey from the surface to the depth of the brain. In fact, every
area of the brain has a distinctive electrical language, which allows the surgeon
to match the initial coordinates with the proper area activity. (Someone has
compared this process to a tourist traveling blindfolded through Europe trying
to identify his position based on the local language.)
After the lead is in place (see the previous section “Weighing Your Surgical
Options” for more about this process), your surgeon may implant the battery
and extension wire at the same time or wait up to a week before connecting
the system.
Compared to implanting the electrode, connecting the system is child’s play:
1. While you’re under general anesthesia, your surgeon makes a small inci-
sion near your collarbone and inserts the implantable pulse generator
(IPG) in a pocket formed under the skin.
2. Next, he runs a small wire from the IPG under the skin up your neck and
behind your ear to connect the IPG to the DBS lead in your scalp.
3. Finally, your surgeon closes the incision with stitches or staples.
Hospitalization for DBS surgery is usually two to three days. For more compli-
cated surgeries (when postsurgery confusion, infections, or other complica-
tions occur), the stay may be longer. In most cases, however, recovery is a
matter of resting for a number of reasons: to get past the emotional and phys-
ical exhaustion that can be a part of any surgery; to rest after the possible
slight headache (because of the helmet apparatus); and, in some cases, to
reduce the mild confusion. Most DBS patients are able to leave the hospital
the morning following the procedure.
Most routine postoperative conditions clear up after the first day. The
stitches or staples in your scalp will be removed by your doctor a week or so
after your discharge. The IPG (battery pack), which is usually implanted two
to four weeks later, will be visible as a slight bump in your chest (especially if
you’re slender), but you don’t feel the wires or apparatus as they work.
134
Part III: Crafting a Treatment Plan Just for You 

Programming DBS into Your Life
Surgery of any type takes a lot out of you. There’s stress and anxiety from
anticipating the procedure, exhaustion from the procedure itself, and sus-
pense and concern about whether it worked, whether it was worth the trou-
ble. This section helps you anticipate your life after your DBS surgery.
Changes you can expect
Following DBS surgery, your neurologist determines the best time to begin
reducing your medication. But first, your neurostimulator must be pro-
grammed. This process may take one long session (initial programming 
session) and several outpatient visits, because just as you have unique
responses to medication, you may have unique responses to the stimulator.
You may not realize the benefits of DBS for weeks or even months, although
most people experience some effects the same day the unit is programmed.
Tremors and dyskinesias are usually the first symptoms to respond. Be
patient as your doctor works with you to balance the settings on your stimu-
lator with your medication regimen.
During this sometimes-exasperating process, you may have some temporary
discomfort, such as minor shocks or muscle spasms. These symptoms are
related to adjusting and programming the neurostimulator and should be
brief. Before you leave the office after a programming/adjustment session,
your doctor may want you to wait an hour or so, just to be sure you’re okay
with the new settings.
Warning signs you need to heed
Although you may experience some discomfort and unusual symptoms as
your neurostimulator is programmed, let your doctor know whether you
experience any of the following symptoms after implantation or between pro-
gramming sessions:
 Shocks or tingling sensations
 Numbness or spasms, especially in the face or hands
 Impaired balance or dizziness
 Slurred speech
135
Chapter 10: When Surgery Is an Option

 Blurred or double vision
 Depression
 Dykinesia-like movement
As you go about your normal routine, take these precautions:
 Ask for a hand-check when you go through security while traveling. If
the electromagnetic field of the security equipment causes your stimula-
tor to shut down, you can turn it back on with a handheld remote. Not to
worry: Airport security personnel are accustomed to travelers who have
implants such as a defibrillator or pacemaker.
 If you play sports, carefully rethink any high-level contact sports like
basketball. Repeated direct blows to the implant or connections can
cause harm or the need for replacement.
 At home, try to stay away from microwave ovens (while they’re in 
use) and be aware of the magnetic strip that keeps the refrigerator 
door shut. Swiping it near your chest may inadvertently turn off your
neurostimulator.
 Check with your neurologist before any doctor orders imaging tests
such as an MRI or CT scan for you. The test may be perfectly safe for
you, but it doesn’t hurt to be sure.
 Other common warnings are provided in the patient-information manual
you receive. Review them in detail with your treating physician or 
programming nurse.

Considering Complementary and
Alternative Medicine Therapies
In This Chapter
 Noting the distinctions: Alternative versus complementary therapies
 Grasping options for your mind and body
 Choosing the right CAM professional
 Spiriting the right approach
M
edication and surgical procedures are only two of the options for treat-
ment of your Parkinson’s disease (PD) symptoms. Increasingly the
healthcare profession is embracing the benefits of some complementary and
alternative medical treatments.
This chapter helps you understand the differences between complementary
and alternative therapies so you can sort through the various options and
weigh the potential benefits of each. It also helps put you in touch with rep-
utable practitioners if you decide to expand your treatment plan.
Don’t underestimate the importance of diet and exercise to your success in
managing your PD symptoms. These topics are so vital that they get their
own discussion (see Chapter 12). In this chapter, though, we look at thera-
pies you may have heard of but never considered as viable complements or
alternatives to the conventional plan you expect your doctor to recommend.
What’s in a Name? CAM 
Therapies Defined
Techniques, medicines, and therapies that take a holistic (mind, body, and
spirit) and unconventional approach to the treatment of disease are often
called complementary or alternative medicine (CAM) therapy.

Alternative medicine usually refers to approaches (yoga, T’ai Chi, acupunc-
ture, special herbal remedies, diets, and the like) that aren’t standard in
Western society but are quite common in Eastern societies.
Complementary therapies, on the other hand, include techniques and
approaches (physical, occupational, and speech therapy; modifications to
diet; regular exercise, and such) that are more familiar to Western societies.
Alternative treatments often replace more conventional treatments, and com-
plementary therapies augment conventional methods.
Although alternative and complementary treatments may work in tandem
with more traditional medical treatment, they usually haven’t passed (or
even been required to pass) the rigorous, scientific, evidence-based tests that
conventional medicines and treatments must navigate for the Food and Drug
Administration’s (FDA) approval.
However, in 1998 the National Institutes of Health (NIH) established the
National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM)
because of
 The growing popularity of alternative and complementary therapies.
 The need for establishing standards for practitioners.
 The need for a respected resource for validating information and con-
ducting research on their benefits.
NCCAM focuses on four key areas:
 Research
 Training and career development for researchers working on projects
related to alternative or complementary treatments
 Public outreach and education
 Integration of CAM treatments with conventional medicine
You can find information about specific therapies on the NCCAM Web site
www.nccam.nih.gov or by calling (888) 644-6226.
Before you consider any alternative or complementary therapy, talk with
your neurologist and make sure the therapy is from a licensed, certified prac-
titioner. (See the section “Finding the Best Practitioner” later in this chapter
for tips on determining the right practitioners.)
The following section explores the major categories of CAM treatments avail-
able today.

Introducing Your Options
The concept of any therapy other than traditional medical methods (medica-
tions and surgery) may be new to you. And one of the beauties of reading up
on these various CAM options before you talk to your doctor about them is
that you can do so in the privacy of your own home.

Chapter 11: Considering Complementary and Alternative Medicine Therapies
Debunking the myths about treating PD
PD treatment has a number of urban myths that
surface from time to time about what does and
doesn’t work. Often these falsehoods are from
credible sources (such as members of your sup-
port group or even articles in respected, usually
trustworthy publications). The Internet is
another prime source for such rumors. For
these reasons, remember to seek and confirm
information by asking questions of your doctor
or other trusted healthcare professionals (such
as your pharmacist). And use only reliable PD
information resources, such as those listed in
Appendix B.
The following are some of the more prevalent
myths floating around:
 Levodopa is toxic. (Actually it’s been work-
ing for PWP for over 40 years.)
 Levodopa will stop working after a while.
(No, but symptoms may escalate, causing
you to need stronger, more frequent dosing.)
 You die from PD. (How you’re going to die is
as much a mystery now as it was before
you were diagnosed — could be a car acci-
dent, lightening, a heart attack, and so on.)
 You’re definitely going to be in a wheelchair.
(Keep in mind that PD is unique to every
person. Your chances of being in a wheel-
chair are probably higher than some PWPs
and far lower than others’.)
 You’re definitely going to be demented — a
vegetable. (PD has no definites. As for being
a vegetable? Just focus on eating vegeta-
bles and stop predicting the future.)
 My children will have PD. (Go back and read
Chapter 3 — right now.)
 You can’t eat proteins while taking levodopa.
(Ah, the protein myth — see the section
“The protein factor” later in this chapter.
Meanwhile, eat your protein.)
 Surgery doesn’t work for PD. (Right, it may
not work for some people, but it does work
in combination with prescription medica-
tions for many others, and you may be one
of them.)
 You can cure PD with alternative therapies
such as glutathione and nicotinamide ade-
nine dinucleotide, NADH. (We’ve said it
before and we’ll say it again — PD doesn’t
have a cure yet.)
 And our personal favorite: You can cure PD
with foot massage. (We’re not even going to
comment on that one.)
As you can see, each myth has a little bit of
truth. Remember, somewhere along the way
you were told: If something sounds too good to
be true, it’s probably not true. So when someone
tries to sell you the snake-oil-of-a-cure, or a
concoction that reverses symptoms, or a plan
that halts PD’s progression, just walk away. Your
best weapons against this web of half-truths?
Be informed, keep up with new research, and
ask questions.

In this section, we introduce you to several of the more prevalent therapies.
Before taking any action, though, be sure you discuss with your neurologist
the potential of such therapies for helping your PD symptoms. (Then again,
maybe your neurologist has suggested one or more of these techniques, and
you’re reading this section because you [wisely] want to get a better idea of
just what you’re in for.)
East treats West: Acupuncture and 
other traditional Chinese medicine
For centuries Western medical experts considered Eastern medical tech-
niques to be experimental at best and quackery at worst. But much of that
attitude has changed dramatically in the last decade. Traditional Chinese
Medicine (TCM) is founded on the concept of qi (or chi), when the person’s
natural flow of energy is in balance. This system includes forms (such as
exercise, herbal remedies, acupuncture, and massage) that work with identi-
fied energy points in the body.
Perhaps the most familiar TCM is acupuncture. This therapy usually requires
a series of appointments by a trained and licensed therapist who inserts ster-
ile needles (about the size of a human hair) into a part of the body believed
to affect the area needing treatment. Although acupuncture has not been
shown to relieve PD symptoms, it may help persons with Parkinson’s (PWP)
who experience cramping, stiffness, pain, or sleep disturbances.
In 1997, the NIH noted the increased use of acupuncture by a growing number
of physicians and other medical professionals in the United States for relief
or prevention of pain.
Ohhh! Ahhh! Experiencing 
body-based CAM therapies
Treatments that manipulate or move various parts of the body (such as mus-
cles and joints) are considered body-based CAM therapies. Major examples of
this category are chiropractic and osteopathic therapy and body massages.
Chiropractic and osteopathic therapy
Chiropractors focus on the structure of the body as it relates to the function,
preservation, or restoration of various parts. Note: In chiropractic literature
you may find some poorly defined theories that relate PD to previous head
140
Part III: Crafting a Treatment Plan Just for You 

and neck traumas, which then suggest neck manipulations to treat (and
cure!) the disease. Given that these assumptions are criticized even within
the chiropractic profession, the role of chiropractic therapy in PD is unknown
at this time.
Osteopathic medicine is a more-conventional medical system based on the
principle that all the body’s systems work together. When one system is
affected, then other systems are likely to be affected as well. The hands-on
techniques of some osteopaths to manipulate various body parts are consid-
ered a CAM therapy.
Massage
Many people associate massages with a ritzy spa or salon. But many medical
professionals view regular massage therapy by a trained and certified thera-
pist an important complement to conventional medical care. Massage can
help relieve some of the stiffness and muscle contractions common in PD by
 Increasing blood supply to the muscles.
 Increasing range of motion.
 Stretching the muscles for greater flexibility.
The bonus to these physical benefits is the mental payoff: reduced stress and
anxiety. You and your care partner may find that regular sessions with a mas-
sage therapist are a great way to relieve stress, build a sense of well being
and calm, and improve circulation.
Massage is also a good form of relaxation. Under the right circumstances, it
offers an environment conducive to meditation and centering. See the next
section, “Exploring mind and body options to relieve tension, stress, and 
anxiety,” for more about these benefits. You can also check out Massage For
Dummies by Steve Capellini and Michel Van Welden (Wiley) for more info.
Therapeutic massage and other CAM therapies may be covered by your
insurance if your doctor prescribes them as medically necessary.
Exploring mind and body options to 
relieve tension, stress, and anxiety
Mind and body therapies rely on the mind’s ability to influence physical func-
tion and symptoms. They include meditation, creative outlets (as in music,
art, or dance), and so on.
141
Chapter 11: Considering Complementary and Alternative Medicine Therapies

Employing relaxation and meditation techniques
Living with a chronic and progressive illness takes a lot out of you. Combine
that reality with life’s thousand other pressures (like work, relationships,
financial security, crime, the weather, and such) and you have a prescription
for stress. So when you have PD, finding ways to eliminate tension from your
mind and body makes especially good sense.
You can have planned relaxation without going anywhere, hiring anyone, or
paying any money. It’s a simple matter of finding a quiet place to focus totally
on you for at least 15 minutes twice a day. At the end of that time, close your
eyes, hum a mantra, or sit cross-legged on a pillow — it’s totally up to you.
Start by being aware of your physical tensions. Slowly and softly breathe in
and out as you relax each muscle group one at a time: forehead, neck, shoul-
ders, arms, hands, fingers, torso, hips, thighs, calves, ankles, feet, and finally
toes. As you become more aware of your body relaxing, you have a better
idea of where you tend to store that stress and tension (for example in the
neck and shoulders, the fingers, or perhaps the jaw). Soon you’ll be able to
consciously relax those areas beyond your planned relaxation sessions.
Another tool is meditation, which you can use when your tension is not only
physical but also mental and emotional. It can take many forms; consider the
mantra-chanting practice of Zen meditation or the visualization techniques
that follow recorded prompts to imagine (visualize) a calm, peaceful setting.
If you’ve never tried meditation, the Mayo Clinic recommends these tips to
help you get started:
 Select a form of meditation that fits your lifestyle and daily routine and
works with your fundamental beliefs.
 Set aside the time. If 15 minutes twice a day seems too much, start with
5 minutes and work your way up to longer sessions.
 Forgive your slips. If your mind wanders, recognize it. Then come back
to your focus on relaxing and calming your mind, body, and spirit.
 Experiment until you find the timing and method that works best 
for you.
In combination with relaxation, meditation can reduce stress for mind and
body. But, like all complementary and alternative practices, meditation
should supplement — not replace — your doctor’s traditional therapies.
Getting in touch with your creative side
Quilting. Woodworking. Gardening. Knitting. Playing an instrument. Dancing —
by yourself or in a group. Writing poetry or stories. Journaling. Everyone has
a creative side. And, as one sage said, “If something is worth doing, it’s worth
142
Part III: Crafting a Treatment Plan Just for You 

doing badly.” You may not be Picasso or Mozart but you can find pleasure in
creating something unique. Who knew that such pleasure could be good ther-
apy as well?
At the 2006 World Parkinson Congress in Washington DC, one of the most pop-
ular areas was a wonderful art exhibition by dozens of PWP. To supplement
the display, there were delightful performances by musicians, poets, story-
tellers, and others. Some of the work was good enough to be in a fine gallery
or shop, but the real beauty was in the obvious joy and delight of the artist in
creating it. To see examples of the exhibit, go to www.pdcreativity.org.
Take these steps to get your creative side in gear:
 Find a new or return to a former hobby, art, or craft that appeals to you.
Establish a regular time to pursue it — an hour every evening or once or
twice a week if time is tight.
 Consider taking lessons at a local art center, community center, or shop.
You can enjoy the dual therapy of creativity plus socialization.
Letting those creative juices flow isn’t about being good. It’s about finding
pleasure, escape, and relief from the daily grind of managing your PD symp-
toms. Just say “Ahhh!”
Staying active via alternative exercise
Postural instability (the loss or impairment of your natural ability to hold
yourself upright and maintain balance) can be a major problem for PWP. The
greatest danger, of course, is falling. But a close second is the fear of falling
that causes you to overcompensate for these off-balance positions, further
jeopardizing your stability. One of the benefits of regular physical activity is
realizing that alignment, stability, and balance are vital to our overall well
being and independence.
For PWP, Eastern exercise programs may be as beneficial, if not more so, than
the traditional, strenuous Western types. Eastern exercise therapies tend to
be performed slowly and focus on stretching motions that can enhance flexi-
bility. These Eastern methods aren’t for everyone, but if you haven’t been off
the couch and gotten real exercise in a while, you may want to consider this
variation.
Check with your doctor before beginning any exercise program — conven-
tional or alternative.
143
Chapter 11: Considering Complementary and Alternative Medicine Therapies

T’ai Chi
This ancient, low-impact Chinese exercise combines measured breathing with
slow, dance-like movements that develop flexibility, enhance cardiovascular
well being, and improve balance. Although books and instructional visual
aids are available, the best way to get started is by working with a trained
professional to understand the proper moves and breathing combinations.
Check with your local community center, senior center, or health club for
classes in your area. T’ai Chi For Dummies by Therese Iknoian (Wiley) can
provide a solid introduction.
Yoga
Another exercise program that incorporates stretching and balancing exer-
cises in a slow, rhythmic pattern of movement is yoga. Forget the painful-
looking, pretzel-like positions you may have seen on television or in movies.
Yoga — properly done — combines stretching with breathing and meditation
to achieve a greater sense of physical, mental, and spiritual balance.
As with T’ai Chi, yoga classes have levels from beginner to advanced and 
different styles of teaching. For example, some instructors focus more on the
physical movement; others distribute the focus between the physical, breath-
ing, and mind exercises.
If possible, find an instructor who can and will modify the traditional yoga
positions and movements to accommodate your limitations. For example, if
getting up and down from a mat is difficult, perhaps you can do a modified
version of the movements while sitting in a chair. Yoga For Dummies by Georg
Feuerstein and Larry Payne (Wiley) is a great reference for beginners.
Delving into dietary, protein, 
enzyme, and vitamin options
Although Chapter 12 has a detailed discussion of diet and exercise, the sub-
ject of complementary therapies also involves dietary issues. Because each
person plays an active, participatory role in such therapies, this section pro-
vides information about CAM diets and diet supplements.
Diet — The usual rules apply
You know the drill. With or without PD, a healthy lifestyle includes a diet 
rich in fruits and vegetables but low in sugar, fats, and highly processed
foods (white foods like white bread, white flour, white rice, and such). You
also want to avoid foods that have been exposed to pesticides and other
toxins. (Stick with organic fruits and vegetables even though they’re more
expensive — you’re worth it!) As we mention in Chapter 2, overexposure 
to pesticides and herbicides (common in nonorganic farming) may be a 
144
Part III: Crafting a Treatment Plan Just for You 

contributing factor in the onset of PD. For additional help, consider asking
your doctor to recommend a trained nutritionist.
This professional may suggest a diet high in anti-oxidants (green leafy vegeta-
bles and the like) because ongoing studies indicate that such a diet may be
beneficial for PWPs. Another diet-specific concern is whether you’re getting
enough calcium (osteoporosis leads to softer bones, which lead to breaks
from falls). Finally, studies have shown that the intake of protein in combina-
tion with antiparkinsonian meds can be a problem for some PWP. For more
on the protein factor, see the next section.
The protein factor
A common PD myth is that protein in a PWP’s diet is not good. Although you
certainly don’t want to remove protein from your diet, your doctor or nutrition-
ist may recommend that you limit protein intake to particular meals and take
your anti-PD meds (in particular levodopa/Sinemet) on an empty stomach.
As your PD progresses, you may experience the on-off phenomenon (your
meds start to wear off sooner and symptoms reappear more rapidly between
doses) that’s common among PWP who’ve taken Sinemet for several years.
Some studies indicate that diets rich in protein may negatively affect the
brain’s ability to absorb Sinemet if meals and dosing aren’t properly coordi-
nated. In fact, levodopa is an amino acid (the building block of every pro-
tein); a high protein intake at the same time of your medication dose may
compete with the absorption of your precious medications. Taking levodopa
30 to 45 minutes before meals can avoid the problem.
CoQ10 and other over-the-counter supplements
CoQ10 (coenzyme Q10) is naturally produced by the body, but it decreases
with age and in people with certain chronic conditions such as PD. Available
as a dietary supplement, this enzyme may slow the progression of PD for
some PWP.
In 2006 the NIH announced plans to enroll recently diagnosed and early-stage
PWP in a study to determine whether exceptionally high doses of this over-
the-counter (OTC) enzyme may indeed affect the progression of PD. “We’re
looking for the aspirin of Parkinson’s disease,” stated Diane Murphy, head of
Parkinson’s research at NIH. Although some patients already take CoQ10
(with the guidance of their neurologist, we hope), the NIH dosing plan is
much higher than the recommended OTC dose.
Also under study are minocycline (an anti-inflammation antibiotic available
only by prescription), and creatine, an energy-boosting dietary supplement.
The fact that the federal government and medical community continue to
sponsor such studies is a clear indication of their willingness to consider the
possibility that PD may be better managed with the use of a combination of
therapies rather than a single magic bullet.
145
Chapter 11: Considering Complementary and Alternative Medicine Therapies

Vitamin supplements
Taking vitamins that maintain your recommended daily levels is important
for PWP. For example, a good multivitamin — one that includes the key B vit-
amins that are so important for brain and nerve health — is a good choice.
Calcium with vitamin D helps prevent osteoporosis, which is a common con-
cern for PWP, and calcium with magnesium can play a role in relieving muscle
cramps. After running some standard blood tests, your doctor may make 
specific recommendations. Be sure to ask your doctor about continuing the
vitamins and supplements you used before your diagnosis and about adding
new ones.
Several studies have looked at vitamin E as a way to prevent the onset of PD
or slow its progression. The most important was the DATATOP study, a ten-
year controlled trial that found no benefit in slowing or improving the disease
with the use of very high doses of vitamin E. Indeed, a recent report in the
American Academy of Neurology’s journal stated: “Vitamin E is probably inef-
fective in the treatment of PD.” Moreover a recent analysis of medical litera-
ture warned that high-dosage vitamin E supplementation may actually
increase mortality. In other words, too much of a good thing may not be a
good thing.
On the other hand, scientists have found some protective qualities in the vit-
amin E in foods such as green leafy veggies, whole grains, and nuts. Mahyar
Etminan, a lead researcher for the Centre for Clinical Epidemiology and
Evaluation at Vancouver Hospital in Canada cautions that “this is an interest-
ing hypothesis, but it needs to be validated.” Of course, eating a diet rich in
natural sources of vitamin E is always a good idea for your overall health.
In general, no regimen of vitamins has shown the ability to reduce or control
PD symptoms. However, because one theory about the cause of PD (see
Chapter 2) involves the oxidation of free radicals, it is possible that anti-
oxidants (like vitamins C and E) may reduce the levels of these free radicals
and, therefore, provide some benefit.
Interestingly, a trial that combined vitamin C and E supplements in people
with early PD showed a delayed need for drug therapy (L-dopa) by an aver-
age of two and a half years. However, more studies are needed to confirm
these findings. Similarly, because PWP can be prone to bone loss, your
doctor may prescribe (especially for women patients) a calcium supplement
or a prescription medication for preserving bone mass. See Osteoporosis 
For Dummies by Carolyn Riester O’Connor and Sharon Perkins (Wiley) for
more about this connection.
146
Part III: Crafting a Treatment Plan Just for You 

Finding the Best Practitioner
Keeping in mind that managing PD over the long haul is a team effort, be sure
you talk to your neurologist about the potential benefits and pitfalls of alter-
native or complementary therapies you’re considering. Your doctor may take
a “no harm, no foul” attitude and not actually support the idea. Or she may
suggest specific therapies for you to try or avoid.
Adding CAM therapy to your PD management plan requires you to carefully
choose the person who’ll administer that therapy. The following tips can help
you in that search:
 If your neurologist endorses the idea, ask for recommendations.
 Be sure this person has received training from a respected source and
passed the exams necessary to earn the appropriate degree or license.
 Acupuncturists and herbalists specializing in the use of herbs as medi-
cine should be licensed.
Consider adapting the checklist for finding a neurologist (we provide
this in Chapter 4) to guide your choice of alternative medicine 
practitioners.
After you’ve selected a practitioner, you still have a number of questions. On
your first visit, ask:
 What benefits can I expect from this therapy?
 What are the risks associated with the treatment?
 Does it have any special benefits or risks related to my PD?
 What are the side effects?
 How many sessions or how long will I need to have the treatment to
achieve the expected results?
 Does this treatment have any conditions that are contraindicated (to be
avoided)?
 What is the cost per session?
 Will insurance pay?
You’re not married to a specific practitioner. If you’re uncomfortable with the
treatment or the practitioner as the sessions proceed, then stop and talk the
problem out. If you aren’t satisfied with the response, move on.
147
Chapter 11: Considering Complementary and Alternative Medicine Therapies

Considering Your Approach to Life: 
It Too Can Help . . . or Hinder
You know the difference between the eternal pessimist (who always expects
the worst) and the forever optimist (who’s over the top, always anticipating
the best). Somewhere in the middle is the realist (as well as a bit of an ideal-
ist, philosopher, and activist) who accepts that bad things do indeed happen
to good people. This person faces adversity and then looks for ways to get
life back on track.
Celebrities like Lance Armstrong, Christopher and Dana Reeve, Michael J.
Fox, Muhammad Ali, and others come to mind. But chances are good that you
know people within your circle of family, friends, and co-workers who also fit
this positive profile. As a PWP, you’re going to benefit most from this glass-
half-full-and-things-could-be-a-lot-worse philosophy.
Three characteristics that most survivor-types have in common are
 A positive attitude.
 The ability to laugh even at the unfairness of life.
 A spiritual core that’s as well-tended as their physical or mental health.
The way you approach life — and all its joys and adversities — can play an
enormous role in how successfully you live that life. The very fact that you
bought this book and are reading it tells us that you’re a survivor and a
fighter. Our message to you is that we’re right here with information and
ideas that can help you successfully find ways to live a full and fulfilling life in
spite of having PD.
The therapeutic power of positive thinking
Life has no guarantees. But a lot of people live life more fully by rolling with
the punches and taking a positive, can-do approach.
So, how do you deal with a diagnosis like PD? How do you face the progres-
sive symptoms and side effects of the medicines? Believe it or not, the one
factor that remains in your control throughout this journey is your attitude.
You can expect the worst or you can fight back by choosing to live life fully
and positively — as if you had never heard that diagnosis.
148
Part III: Crafting a Treatment Plan Just for You 

As a matter of fact, for some people the diagnosis creates this shift in atti-
tude. Discovering that they have PD turns their world upside down, so now
they focus more intently on the positives. The realization that life is finite
after all can be a real turning point for you — if it comes with the determination
to live every day to the fullest. (And if your faith tells you that God doesn’t
test you more than you can endure, then you can start believing that higher
opinion and start honing those survival capabilities!)
Laughter — Still the best medicine
Face it: When you laugh, you feel better. Your outlook improves — if only
momentarily. You may even feel better physically. Consider the angry,
depressed man who had just gone through brain surgery. He told his wife he
didn’t want any visitors. But when she ran into several close friends at the
elevator and told them, “Not today,” the friends still insisted. “We’ll only stay
a moment,” they promised. Within moments the woman heard the welcome
sound of laughter — her husband’s. As the visit went on and the friends
worked their magic, that laughter couldn’t be repressed.
Open up to life — Physically, 
mentally, and spiritually
When you face a chronic and progressive illness day after day, you under-
standably have times when you just want to burrow under the covers and
hope it all goes away. Resist that temptation!
Because we address your physical and mental well being throughout this
book, this section looks at one other dimension, your spiritual needs, and
how meeting those needs can enhance your life.
Spirituality is that core inside you where your sense of well being and sur-
vival reside. For some people, organized rituals of religion can be a part of
this core, but rituals can’t be all of it; for other people, rituals and religion
play no part at all.
Your spiritual core is also where you store your self-identity. Your body may
shake and twist and your mind may play tricks with your memory and con-
centration, but your spirit is still there. A relative of a PWP who was in the
later stages said it well: “I just believe that he’s still in there somewhere, that
his spirit is still aware and fighting to let us know.”
149
Chapter 11: Considering Complementary and Alternative Medicine Therapies

Like your PD, spirituality is different for every individual. But one way to
begin focusing on your spiritual well-being is by using your senses to their
full effect. Consider the following suggestions:
 Listen — to a sermon, an inspirational reading, a concert, water flowing,
wind in the trees, rain on the roof, your innermost hopes and dreams
 Look — at the people who surround you, love you, and care for you
 Touch — by taking a friend’s hand; petting a dog or cat; hugging a loved
one; stroking a leaf, a rock, a child’s hair
 Smell — freshly cut grass, an autumn fire, cookies straight from the oven
 Taste — the bitter as well as the sweet
 Savor — the unique tastes, sounds, sights, scents, and feelings that form
the wonders of your life
Tapping into your spiritual side takes the same focused effort as your physi-
cal and mental needs. And your willingness to push yourself on all three
levels can pay off in ways you never thought possible.

Chapter 12
The Key Roles of Diet 
and Exercise
In This Chapter
 Eating to live versus living to eat
 Improving mobility through exercise and activity
 Getting (and staying) physical
 Empowering the mind and spirit
You’ve heard it since you were a child — eat right and exercise! But, for
people with Parkinson’s (PWP) and their care partners, the importance
of proper diet and a regular program of exercise can’t be overemphasized.
The benefits go well beyond physical fitness to bring relief from the general
stresses of living with a chronic, progressive disease. In addition, a good diet
and regular exercise help fight off the anxiety and depression that can accom-
pany Parkinson’s disease (PD). With or without PD, you owe it to yourself to
be as fit — physically, mentally and spiritually — as possible. How else are
you going to participate fully in life?
In this chapter we show you that good health isn’t about training for a
marathon or depriving yourself of foods you love. It’s about making the
choices that give you the best chance of living well and pursuing the plea-
sures of your life for many years — in spite of PD.
The Joy of Good Food — 
Diet and Nutrition
According to the National Institute of Aging, the combined effects of not
making the right food choices and not being physically active make up the
second largest underlying cause of death (behind smoking) in the United
States. Often the element most absent from the diets of Americans is

nutrition, foods that provide the proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals,
hydration, fiber, and — yes — fats that the body needs to operate at its best.
Add to that fact that PD medications and symptoms can significantly reduce
the pleasures of eating, and you have a situation ripe for disaster.
This section isn’t about losing that extra twenty pounds; it’s about making
the best food and nutrition choices to maintain optimal health as you fight
the progression of PD.
Balance is the key
As a PWP, you have to perform a real balancing act when it comes to your
diet. Along with the ready-made factors that impact nutrition and diet (like
age, gender, and physical fitness), you have to deal with the nutritional
sideshows of PD. For example, side effects of medications may include loss of
appetite or even nausea. As your PD progresses, swallowing and constipation
can become issues. And you may have side effects from medications for
other chronic conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or arthritis.
Finding the proper balance between a healthy diet and these PD issues may
require the help of a professional, so your neurologist may prescribe a con-
sultation with a nutritionist or dietician as part of your treatment plan. If not,
go ahead and ask him for a referral.
Keep in mind that timing the dosing of your medication (see Chapter 9) with
meals is very important, especially for meals that include significant servings
of protein. Protein — although essential for a balanced diet — can compete
with the absorption of your antiparkinsonian meds. The usual recommenda-
tion is to take medication at least 30 minutes before meals unless you experi-
ence nausea or dyskinesia (uncontrolled twisting writhing motions) after
taking your medications. If nausea is the problem, your doctor may recom-
mend you take a low-protein snack, such as juice or saltines, with your meds.
If dykinesia occurs, slowing the absorption by taking your anti-PD meds at
mealtime may be exactly what you need. Be sure you and your doctor dis-
cuss the timing of meals and medications to offset this problem.
Banishing the bad and embracing 
the good-for-you foods
No doubt you’ve seen the food pyramid — which is now a bar grid — recom-
mended by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. (See www.mypyramid.gov.)
And you probably know you should hold your intake of fats and oils (not to
mention desserts) to a minimum and spend most of your calories on fruits,
152
Part III: Crafting a Treatment Plan Just for You 

veggies, whole grains, and dairy. (By the way, a banana split does not count
in your fruit and dairy allowance!)
But this is your life, and presumably you’re prepared to fight this PD that’s
parked like a tank in your designated space. A nutritionist or dietician can be
a real help, showing you how to adapt your needs to your lifestyle. You tell
her how you normally eat — on the run, in your car, at home standing at the
kitchen counter, or seated with the family at the table, in fine restaurants, or
fast-food joints. You reveal your food weaknesses — hate veggies, love bread,
and such. Then the professional works with you to build a food plan that fits
your lifestyle and your likes and dislikes.
Focus on these key issues when you start rearranging your pyramid:
 Water, water, water! Flavor it with a slice of lemon or a little fruit juice if
you can’t take it straight, but six to eight big glasses every day. (And, no,
soda, coffee, and tea don’t count.) Caffeine beverages may increase
diuresis (your amount of urine output) and, as a result, cancel your
efforts to hydrate your body. Note: Some studies have shown that caf-
feine may reduce the risk of PD for some people, so caffeine in modera-
tion probably won’t hurt — and may help.
 Fiber (whole-grain breads — not the mushy white stuff — brown rice,
and whole-wheat pasta). In fact, stay away from white foods in general.
Green leafy vegetables, whole grains, and nuts are rich natural sources of
vitamin E that may have a protective effect against PD (see Chapter 11).
Whole grain breads must be refrigerated, but white bread isn’t. (White
bread is so devoid of actual nutrients that even bacteria won’t eat it.
That’s a pretty good clue.)
 Bone-strengthening nutrients (calcium, magnesium, and vitamins D
and K). Think dairy products and, believe it or not, exposure to sunlight
(a vitamin D source). Also, regular exercise (we discuss this later) can
help you keep bones strong, maintain balance, and prevent the falls so
devastating for PWP.
Although your doctor may recommend adding supplements (such as a daily
multivitamin, iron, or calcium pill) to your regular diet, the key word here is
supplement. Such products are no substitute for a nutritionally balanced diet.
But good-for-you foods can actually be more delicious and easy to prepare
than you imagined. One example is the fabulous fruit smoothie: Throw
berries, half a banana, a cup of fat-free yogurt, and some ice cubes in a
blender. Add a teaspoon of ground flax seed for fiber, turn the blender on
high, pour the milkshake-like concoction into your car mug, and you’re good
to go (Smoothies are also great for preventing the constipation associated
with PD medications.)

Food as celebration
If, like millions of Americans, you’ve fallen into a rut with the when, what, and
where you eat, think about spicing those meals up. The following is our list of
ideas for making meals more of a celebration than an afterthought:
 Choose your setting to match the menu, the mood, and the season —
dining room, kitchen table, inside, outside; at home or at a sidewalk café.
 Set the table, even if it’s just for one.
 Think S.H.E. when cooking at home — simple, healthy, and engaging.
 Try adding special (non-salt) seasonings and flavorings to spice up your
food and make it more enjoyable.
 Be adventurous and try new dishes you’ve never tasted when eating out.
Request a soup spoon when ordering items like rice or small veggies
(peas, corn, and such). A large spoon makes these foods easier to
manage if you have a tremor.
 Savor food with all your senses — the vision of healthy food presented
well; the smells, tastes, and textures; even the sounds of laughter and
conversation interspersed with clinking dishes and glasses.
Food is life — and as a PWP, you understand the importance of celebrating
every moment.
Use It or Lose It — The Healing 
Power of Exercise and Activity
Plenty of research backs up the fact that regular exercise can do wonders for
your health. Consider that
 Exercising regularly boosts the power of neurotransmittors in your brain
to enhance your mood and your ability to see life in a more positive
light.
 Exercise can relieve the muscle tension from your body’s natural instinct
to lock up in the face of challenges or battles.
 Exercise can enhance your self-image, which can lead to greater self-
assurance and confidence, which can lead to a greater ability to deal
with life’s stresses.
Talk about a win-win!
154
Part III: Crafting a Treatment Plan Just for You 

In addition, PWP who exercise regularly seem to experience a milder and
less-progressive disease process. In fact, exercise may be as good for brain
function as it is for heart and weight factors. Recent laboratory experiments
on animals have shown that physical exercise can potentially reduce the rate
at which brain cells die. Further studies are under way to see whether regular
exercise can actually slow the progression of PD.
Many exercise programs can benefit PWP. The Performance Centers of
Wheaton Franciscan Healthcare in Milwaukee, Wisconsin designed the follow-
ing exercises specifically to stretch and strengthen the key muscle groups for
optimal flexibility and balance. Your doctor and physical therapist may fine-
tune these exercises to match your specific needs, but this chapter gives you
a good starting point. Begin the routine with the stretching exercises and
repeat them during the cool-down period after the strengthening exercises.
The principles of a stretching/flexibility exercise program for PD are the same
as those for sports-medicine rehabilitation:
 Listen to your body.
 Avoid joint pain during exercise.
 Forget the Vince Lombardi adage: No pain, no gain.
 Remember, for joint or other pain after exercise, “Ice is nice; hot is not.”
Because PD frequently develops in a person’s later years, other bone and
joint conditions may already be present such as osteoarthritis (wearing of
joints) and osteoporsis (thinning of the bones). So before you begin any exer-
cise therapy, get the approval of your doctor and a prescription to work with
a trained, experienced physical therapist.
A stretching program to enhance flexibility
The following exercises are designed to enhance your flexibility. With your
doctor or physical therapist’s initial guidance and ongoing monitoring, do the
exercises every day, even twice a day.
If you also do strengthening exercises (such as the ones in the “A strengthen-
ing program to build muscle and stabilize joints” section later) or an aerobic
activity, such as walking, bicycling, swimming, or working out on a treadmill,
use these stretching exercises to warm up and cool down.
Stretching should be slow, smooth, and gentle. No bouncing allowed! And if it
starts to hurt, listen to your body and ease up.

A strengthening program to build 
muscle and stabilize joints
Although stretching is key to maintaining flexibility, don’t ignore the benefits
of strengthening your muscles — especially the muscles you need for main-
taining balance and postural stability. You can perform the following shoul-
der and leg exercises three to five times a week to help maintain strength in
these key areas.
Shoulder strengthening
The following exercises strengthen the shoulder area, especially the rotator
cuff muscles (where your shoulder and arm connect). Your physical therapist
can provide the stretchy exercise bands as well as help you adjust the tension
and size to your needs. Or you can purchase a five-foot length of rubber tubing
at a hardware store or athletic supply shop (they call it a sports cord). For some
of the exercises, you also need a large bath towel to stabilize your arm.
Internal Rotation
To perform the Internal Rotation Exercise:
1. Attach a band to a doorknob that’s even with your elbow, and be sure
the door is solidly shut.
2. Standing three feet from the door with your right side toward the
door, grasp the band with your right hand, bending your arm at the
elbow.
3. Place a rolled towel under your right arm, between your arm and
right side of your body to stabilize your arm (see Figure 12-18a).
4. Pull the band slowly across your body, rotating your arm and shoul-
der inward (see Figure 12-18b).
5. Slowly return your arm to its start position.
6. Repeat Steps 1 through 5 five to ten times.
7. Turn around so your left side is toward the door (move the towel
under your left arm), and repeat Steps 1 through 5, this time extend-
ing your left arm.
Repeat this exercise five to ten times.
External Rotation
To perform the External Rotation Exercise:
1. Wrap the ends of a sports band around each hand.
168
Part III: Crafting a Treatment Plan Just for You 

2. Place a rolled towel under your right arm (between your arm and
chest to stabilize your arm), and place your left hand on your left hip,
keeping your right hand close by (see Figure 12-19a).
3. With your right hand, slowly pull the band across your body, rotating
your arm and shoulder outward (see Figure 12-19b).
4. Slowly return your arm to its start position.
5. Repeat Steps 1 through 4 five to ten times.
6. Repeat Steps 1 through 5, this time extending your left arm. (Don’t
forget to place the towel under your left arm.)
Repeat this exercise five to ten times.
Extension Pull
To perform the Extension Pull Exercise:
1. Attach a band to a doorknob that’s even with your elbow, and be sure
the door is solidly shut.
2. Stand facing the door (about 3 feet from the door) with the band in
your right hand (see Figure 12-20a).
3. Starting with your arm straight and forward, pull the band back by
slowly lowering your straightened arm until it’s at your side (see
Figure 12-20b).
4. Slowly return your arm to its start position.

Other exercise programs that can help
After you’ve mastered the stretches and exercises in the preceding sections,
you may be ready for a program that’s more challenging and yet specifically
structured for PWP. Many national PD organizations consider regular exercise
so essential that they’ve created a variety of programs and tools to help you
get started. Some of these aids are listed below. For more options in pro-
grams and equipment, be sure to check out Chapter 23.
Two programs available through the Parkinson’s Disease Foundation 
(PDF) are:
 Motivating Moves for People with Parkinson’s: In this program developed
by movement specialist Janet Hamburg, participants sit while doing the
exercises. The program is available in either VHS or DVD format.
 The Exercise Program: This tool by Dr. E. Richard Blonsky and a team of
physical therapists specializing in rehabilitation therapy comes with
audio instruction tapes and a binder with illustrated exercise cards.
Call 1-800-457-6676 for more information on either program.
The American Parkinson Disease Association (APDA) has free booklets enti-
tled Aquatic Exercises for Parkinson’s Disease and Be Active: A Suggested
Exercise Program for People with Parkinson’s Disease. For information, call
1-800-223-2732 or look online at www.apdaparkinson.org.
Structured exercise is important in maintaining flexibility and physical func-
tion, but equally important is maintaining an active lifestyle. Read on for
ways that you can use daily physical activity to enhance your well being.
Beyond a Structured Exercise Program —
PD and Physical Activity
Finding ways to redefine ourselves — especially following life-changing
events such as career changes, retirement, the end of a relationship, or a
diagnosis of PD — is not new to most adults. But when circumstances change
the way we define our satisfaction and happiness, we either adapt or choose
a less-than-satisfactory mindset, which may include depression and self-pity.
Far better to work at rediscovering our identity with new resources for plea-
sure and purpose.
177
Chapter 12: The Key Roles of Diet and Exercise

The saying “Quality trumps quantity in life” may not resonate for everyone.
But if you have a PD diagnosis, then you have a choice: Bury your head in the
sand or get out there and live each day to the fullest.
Enjoying recreation
Physical activity, or recreation (see how that word is really re-creation?), dif-
fers from exercise because recreation usually provides an element of immedi-
ate pleasure, accomplishment, or revitalization that structured exercise may
not. For example, if you garden, think about the pleasure of seeing the results
of your hard work. In a similar way, biking and canoeing allow us to be physi-
cally active while taking in the fresh air and scenery.
But recreation goes beyond simple physical endeavors; it includes contact
with other people and opening ourselves to new experiences and informa-
tion. When we were kids, we called it playing. But adults can still play, even
when they’re facing grown-up stuff like PD.
Keeping up with routine 
roles and activities
Chances are good that you played multiple roles before getting the diagnosis
of PD. Take a moment to list them: son/daughter, spouse/lover, friend/com-
panion, parent/grandparent, employee/employer/co-worker, community
leader/volunteer. How about the roles you played at home? Cook, gardener,
decorator, financial manager, handyman/woman.
Ask yourself whether you think some of these roles are no longer possible.
For example, do you think you can’t keep up with your current job (see
Chapter 16) or do you withdraw from social functions because you don’t
want pity from friends and family (see Chapter 15)? Maybe you don’t cook
anymore because the tremors make a mess. Or maybe you’re afraid of making
a mistake in the checkbook, so you’ve handed over the finances to your sig-
nificant other.
Now take a good look at Chapters 2 and 3 to see whether you find a cause or
symptom of PD that says you have to start peeling away pieces of your life
and abandoning vital relationships. We’ll wait. . . .Did you see it? Ah hah! We
knew you wouldn’t!
178
Part III: Crafting a Treatment Plan Just for You 

This is a good time for you to re-evaluate those activities you may have
assumed were no longer possible — employment, volunteer work, and social
activities, such as card playing, sports, and the like. The harder you work to
maintain your normal routine and activities, the less likely your PD will domi-
nate your life.
True, you may need to make some adjustments in physical activities to
accommodate your PD. For example, you may find that sports requiring more
lateral (side-to-side) movement, such as golf and ping pong, are easier for
you. Or, if you were a marathon runner, think about race-walking or just plain
walking. One PWP, Parky, biked over 42,000 miles in a ten-year period by
switching to a recumbent three-wheel trike. (See www.inevergiveup.org.
for more about his story.) His motto: “Let’s take the PARK out of Parkinson’s.”
The point is that you do have choices and you can take charge instead of
allowing assumptions to dictate your routine. Work with your doctor and
other members of your professional health team to determine the right physi-
cal activities for you.
The same advice for physical activities applies to activities that engage you
mentally and spiritually. This next section suggests ways to incorporate
mental and spiritual activity into your daily life.
Exercises for the Mind and Spirit
Okay, you’re exercising regularly and maintaining an active and productive
lifestyle. Caring for the physical body is huge for you and for those people
who make this journey with you. But be sure you give attention to the mind
and spirit. What’s happening inside your head? For that matter, what’s going
on with your care partner — that person (or persons) who’s been with you
from the moment you were diagnosed with PD?
In fact, many PWP develop apathy, a condition defined by
 Reduced interest and participation in routine activities
 Lack of initiative
 Difficulties in starting or sustaining an activity
 Lack of concern for events and people around them
In other words, the mind and spirit seem to simply give up.
179
Chapter 12: The Key Roles of Diet and Exercise

Apathy in PD is more likely a direct consequence of physiological changes in
the brain than a psychological reaction to the disability. As a result, this con-
dition is different from the other psychiatric symptoms and personality
changes associated with the disease (such as depression and anxiety — see
Chapter 13). In addition, PD apathy can trigger major frustration for that
person’s care partner especially when the care partner sees that he’s working
harder at keeping the PWP active and involved than the PWP is.
Basically you can approach your life’s uncertainties in two ways: Devote your
efforts to worrying and trying to change the situation, or devote your energy
toward living the most fulfilling life you can. Although you can’t control the
progression of your PD, you can control your choices:
 To exercise or not
 To remain engaged in the community or not
 To set a tone for your friends and family that you may have PD but it
does not have you
 To wake up every morning and make good choices all over again or not
Choices for the person with PD
Just as proper diet and exercise are the best choices for maintaining your
physical health, they’re also your best weapons for maintaining the health of
your mind and spirit. People who walk, bike, or run often report that they do
their best thinking then; they’re working out mental and emotional issues as
well as physical ones.
These are some exercises you can make a part of your daily (or at least
weekly) routine:
 Take time out for daily spiritual renewal (see Chapter 11). Meditate,
pray, read inspirational books or poetry, take a walk, attend religious
services — whatever gives you a sense of renewal.
 Challenge your mind. Work a crossword or Sudoku puzzle, play along
with a TV game show (preferably one that actually requires some mental
effort), read a book.
 Learn something new. Take a class at the local college or community
center, ask a friend to teach you a craft or new sport, attend a lecture,
watch a documentary. Then share your new ideas with someone else.
 Get involved in your community by taking an active role in a cause or
organization that you think is important: the local library, a museum or
historical site, national projects with local chapters (such as Habitat for
Humanity).
180
Part III: Crafting a Treatment Plan Just for You 

 Create a legacy for your children and grandchildren. Write or record
your family history, research the family tree, organize photo collections
into albums that truly tell the story of your family’s past.
 Partner with your partner to find activities you both can participate in
and maintain the activities you both enjoyed before your diagnosis. Go
to that play, that ballgame, that festival.
 Join a support group — preferably one for PWP — where you can inter-
act with other people who fully understand the problems you and your
care partner are facing.
 Accept that life with PD has no more certainty than life before PD. Turn
to the Bill of Rights for the Person Living with Parkinson’s in the front of
this book. Tear it out, read it, and put it where you’ll see and read it
every day.
Choices for the PD care partner
As the care partner to someone living with PD, you also live with it. It affects
your daily life in ways you had never imagined or planned for. A person in
your shoes may want to abandon pieces of her own life to take care of the
partner. And the most likely piece to fall by the wayside is your own physical
health. You eat (or maybe don’t eat!) as a reaction to your worries rather
than as a source of nourishment. And when you add the responsibilities of
caring for someone with PD to your full calendar, something’s gotta give; the
most likely candidate is your own regular exercise. Stop!
Before you go any further, take a moment to consider the following:
 Someone you love has PD and will eventually need help.
 You partner is managing fine with the present treatment plan. You under-
stand that this plan can last for years by monitoring the disease and
using medications.
 You have a choice:
• Project the worst as you try and control the future by making life-
changing decisions right now.
• Make reasonable plans and preparations by educating yourself
about options and then living the life that’s still reasonably normal.
If you elect the second option, congratulations! Plan to familiarize yourself
with the information in other sections of this book, especially Parts 4 and 5.
181
Chapter 12: The Key Roles of Diet and Exercise

Now, about your body, mind, and spirit. Start by following the same guidelines
we suggest in the “Exercises for the Mind and Spirit” section. Then read the
Bill of Rights for the PD care partner in Chapter 19.
You don’t have PD. You have a life beyond caring for this person — just as
the PWP has a life beyond living with it. Mental and spiritual well being for
each of you depends on maintaining normalcy as long as possible. The great-
est danger is surrendering your potentially good and happy years to anxiety
and depression, which can be a major factor with PD. Check out Chapter 13,
where we address that concern in depth.

Chapter 13
Combating Anxiety and
Depression
In This Chapter
 Getting on top of the downside: Anxiety, depression, and apathy
 Looking for help in all the right places
 Thinking positively for you and your care partner
You’ve gotten some bad news: It’s Parkinson’s disease (PD). At the
moment, you don’t know a lot — about the disease, about its impact on
you and those you love, about so many questions. You’re trying to come to
terms with a diagnosis that means your life has changed and will keep chang-
ing as the years roll by. Of course, you have anxious moments — maybe some
full-blown panic attacks. And news like this doesn’t exactly put a smile on
your face or a lot of sunshine in your outlook. When reactions like these last
for a short time and then pass, that’s normal human behavior.
On the other hand, feelings of anxiety, panic, and depression that persist for
days, weeks, or even months are not normal. And for people living with
Parkinson’s (PWP), the anxiety and depression can be complicated by their
PD — a combination of living with a chronic, progressive illness and the neu-
rochemical changes occurring in the brain.
This chapter looks at the ways PD plays a part in the onset of anxiety and
depression, and we provide a host of proven solutions — some of them
admittedly a little unorthodox — that can bring you relief.
Recognizing the Mental Downside to PD
Anxiety and depression are serious — but treatable — medical conditions
that can affect your quality of life and ability to function as you adapt to
living with PD. And a number of circumstances (like stress, side effects of
meds, and lifestyle changes due to PD) can trigger an episode that sends you
reeling.

Don’t take the symptoms of anxiety and depression lightly, and — just as
important — don’t postpone getting to the appropriate professional for treat-
ment! (See the section “Finding and Accepting Help” later in this chapter for
specifics about professional help.)
Anxiety is normal — to a point
Some situations naturally warrant anxiety and worry (the meeting with the
boss, for example, or giving a major presentation or party). However, when
the panic, terror, and outright impending doom aren’t relieved by time,
accomplishment, or common sense, something’s wrong. Are you normally
easygoing, self-confident, and optimistic? If you suddenly (and regularly!) find
yourself dealing with dread or disproportionate fear, these feelings need
attention.
Research studies confirm the following facts about anxiety for PWP:
 It affects up to 40 percent of PWP.
 It can be one of the first symptoms that make the PWP seek a doctor’s
care.
 It often goes hand in hand with depression.
Identifying the source of that anxiety
Anxiety can be brought on by any number of circumstances and generally
takes one of several forms:
 Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD): A condition in which the person
lives day in and day out with an underlying sense of worry that some-
thing will go wrong, but the worry has no real basis.
 Social phobias: When that persistent worry focuses on a specific situa-
tion or circumstance related to the social environment (such as a fear of
failure or of interacting with other people).
 Panic attack: When anxiety strikes unexpectedly, suddenly, and hard.
Usually a panic attack comes complete with major physical symptoms
(such as a racing heartbeat, shortness of breath, and even chest pain).
In fact you may think you’re having a heart attack.
Circumstances leading to anxiety may include a particularly unsettling and
stressful event (such as a diagnosis of PD); personality traits (such as low
self-esteem and poor coping skills); or the presence of an additional mental
condition (such as depression).
184
Part III: Crafting a Treatment Plan Just for You 

One way to identify the circumstances that cause anxiety is to be mindful of
your own fight-or-flight mechanism. (Fight-or-flight is the most common reac-
tion when people face situations that bring on stress, anxiety, or outright
panic. In other words, they either stand and fight or take off.) Think of the
times when you faced that choice. For example, if your boss confronted you
about a missed deadline and you simply accepted his blame, that’s flight. But
if you listened and then explained exactly why the delay was unavoidable,
that’s fight.
So as a PWP, what sets off your fight-or-flight alarm? How persistent is it? Is
your first instinct usually to take action, find answers, seek knowledge?
(That’s fight.) Or do you wait for others to direct you? (That, of course, is
flight.) It’s perfectly understandable that you’ll have times when you just
want to crawl under the covers and let somebody else live with PD for a
while. But the more you adopt the fight mentality, the more likely you are to
maintain independence and control over your life.
Measuring your level of anxiety
Although doctors use professional tools to diagnose anxiety, a short self-
evaluation of your symptoms can help determine whether you should seek
professional help. Which feelings in the following list do you experience on
most days and for much of the day?
 Anxious or nervous
 Afraid (for self or others)
 Out of control
 Panicky or jumpy
 Short of breath or pounding heart
 Dizzy or faint
 Flushed or sweaty
 Unable to concentrate or take action
 Unable to remember
 Sensing impending doom
If you answered “Yes” to five or more of these symptoms, talk to your doctor.
You may be suffering needlessly from anxiety.
Anxiety disorder includes additional categories such as post-traumatic stress
disorder and obsessive-compulsive behavior disorder, but these are less
common among PWP.
185
Chapter 13: Combating Anxiety and Depression

Depression — More than just sad and blue
According to the National Institute of Mental Health, depression can strike
anyone, but PWP may be at greater risk. This section can help you consider
your symptoms and determine whether it’s time to take action.
Keep in mind that some PD symptoms (such as the masked facial expres-
sion, slow movement, and lack of energy) can actually be symptoms of
depression — and vice versa. But when these symptoms accompany anxiety,
apathy, or loss of interest or pleasure in activities and relationships, consider
the possibility that you have a treatable mental health condition.
Recognizing the symptoms
The National Institute of Mental Health lists the following as symptoms of
depression:
 Persistent sad, anxious, or empty feelings
 Feelings of hopelessness and pessimism
 Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, or helplessness
 Loss of interest and pleasure in hobbies and activities
 Fatigue, feeling slowed down, or decreased energy
 Difficulty concentrating, making decisions, or remembering
 Insomnia or oversleeping
 Appetite or weight gain or loss
 Restlessness and irritability
 Thoughts of death or suicide; suicide attempts
 Crying, especially over little, seemingly incidental issues
Ask yourself these questions
Although we definitely don’t recommend self-diagnosis or treatment, ask
yourself these ten questions if your feelings (mental and emotional) concern
you on a daily basis:
 Are you discouraged or sad?
 Are you moody or irritable?
 Are you feeling isolated or lonely?
 Have you lost interest in activities you can still do?
 Have you pulled away from interactions with friends and family?
 Is your outlook affecting your ability to work, make decisions, or make
choices?
186
Part III: Crafting a Treatment Plan Just for You 

 Has your mood affected your sleep (for example, sleeping more in the
day or not sleeping at night) or energy level?
 Have you experienced changes in appetite and weight?
 Have you lost interest in sex or intimacy with your partner?
 Have the people you trust suggested that you seem depressed?
If you’ve answered “Yes” to five or more of these questions, you need to raise
the possibility with your doctor that you may need treatment for depression.
Dealing with apathy and 
lack of motivation
Many PWP develop apathy, a condition defined by
 Reduced interest and participation in routine activities
 Lack of initiative; having difficulty starting or sustaining an activity to
completion
 Indifference or a lack of concern
 A flattening of affect (the mind and the spirit seem to give up on all 
emotions: good, bad, pleasant, or painful)
In addition to these symptoms, the PWP’s apathy can trigger frustration in
family, friends, and the care partner. When those around an apathetic person
begin to realize that they’re working harder at fighting your PD than you are,
the tendency is to think that the person suffering from apathy doesn’t appre-
ciate their efforts or help. The end result can be that family and friends grad-
ually go back to their own lives, leaving the person with apathy (and the care
partner) more isolated and in need of help than before.
Apathy can be associated with several neuropsychiatric illnesses (such as
Alzheimer’s dementia, PD, and stroke). In PD, however, apathy is more likely a
direct consequence of physiological changes in the brain and lack of
dopamine than a psychological reaction to disability. Although professionals
can distinguish apathy from psychiatric symptoms and personality features
(particularly depression and anxiety), it’s not an easy task. Consider these
subtle but distinguishing characteristics:
 Like people with depression, apathetic patients may be sluggish, quiet,
and disengaged. They may talk slowly or not at all.
 Unlike depressed patients, apathetic PWP deny being sad, feeling guilty,
or having suicidal thoughts.
187
Chapter 13: Combating Anxiety and Depression

Recognizing apathy and differentiating it from depression in PWP is impor-
tant because the medical treatment for the two conditions may be different.
Patients with apathy are not lazy and may respond to a series of strategies
that include gentle encouragement to initiate activities as well as schedules
and routines to keep them busy.
For example, consider a PWP who’s always loved going to the ballpark. When
his best friend invites him to a major league game for his birthday, he says he
wants to stay home in front of the television. But when the friend insists, they
go to the park, and the PWP has a good time all day. However, he immediately
turns the television back on when he returns home.
Ask your primary care doctor or neurologist about the differences between
apathy and depression and what symptoms you (and your care partner)
should watch for in either case.
Finding and Accepting Help
You may have experienced depression or anxiety before the onset of PD, or
your first episode may come after the diagnosis. But the chicken-or-the-egg
question doesn’t really matter. What does matter is that the symptoms (see the
previous sections) are unnecessary hardships when you’re dealing with PD.
Ask your doctor to recommend a consultation with a mental health profes-
sional who’ll work closely with your doctor to assess your depression in the
context of your PD.
Taking medication may help
In most cases, PWP tolerate antidepressant medications well. But medica-
tions can take weeks to have a real effect, and the right medication can take
trial and effort. As a result, many doctors recommend a combination treat-
ment plan that may include or take the place of antidepressants. Combo pos-
sibilities include
 Talk therapy (the services of a professional counselor)
 Changes in diet, exercise routines, and sleep habits
Before you take any medication (prescription or over-the-counter) to treat
symptoms of depression or anxiety, be sure your prescribing doctor is fully
aware of all your other medications. Some over-the-counter (OTC) supple-
ments can interact in a negative or even harmful way with your other 
medications.
188
Part III: Crafting a Treatment Plan Just for You 

Seeking a professional counselor
Your doctor may recommend a professional counselor who helps you talk
through the feelings and fears that are at the foundation of your depression
or anxiety. In looking for the right counselor, keep in mind the different 
categories:
 Psychiatrists: Medical doctors with training (at least four years) beyond
their medical degree. These doctors are board-certified by the American
Board of Psychiatry and Neurology and licensed in the state where they
practice. They can prescribe medications and coordinate a total care
plan for any mental or emotional health issue.
 Psychologists: Counselors with a master’s degree (MA or MS) or a doc-
toral degree (PhD or PsyD) in psychology and/or counseling. Psychologists
are board-certified by the American Board of Professional Psychology
and licensed by the state where they practice.
Psychologists are less focused on biological causes of depression and
anxiety and more focused on treating your symptoms.
 Clinical social workers: Counselors who are licensed or certified by the
state and usually hold a masters degree in social work and/or counsel-
ing. Some social workers have advanced training in psychotherapy and
may have the title of Licensed Clinical Social Worker or LCSW.
 Other counselors include
• Psychiatric nurses or clinical nurse specialists (CNS) who are reg-
istered nurses (RN), with additional training in psychiatry
• Family therapists who hold a title or degree but focus primarily on
counseling within the context of a family group
• Pastoral counselors who, in addition to religious training, have
training in counseling
Finding a counselor
Therapy to treat depression, anxiety, or a mental or emotional condition
should be a collaborative process. More than with any other healthcare pro-
fessional, you need to feel a real sense of trust and rapport with this person.
Keep in mind that your therapist will push you to examine and confront
sometimes unpleasant and even painful issues. She’s not trying to be mean,
but she is trying to get you past roadblocks that may hamper your ability to
accept PD in order to live a fuller, more satisfying life.
Any mental health professional has the ethical (in some cases, legal) respon-
sibility to keep your therapy discussions confidential unless you threaten to
cause harm to other persons or property.
189
Chapter 13: Combating Anxiety and Depression

Choosing the right counselor for you
In addition to checking his credentials and experience, take time to really
consider the connection you’ll have with this therapist or counselor. The fol-
lowing are key steps to follow:
 Be sure your primary care physician (PCP) has already ruled out med-
ical causes for your depression or anxiety symptoms.
 Consider specifics (such as the therapist’s age, gender, ethnic or reli-
gious background) that may be important to you and make those known
when you ask for referrals.
 Get at least two (and preferably three) referrals from your primary care
doctor, neurologist, or support group facilitator.
 Be sure to consider location. You’re going to see this person on a regular
(perhaps weekly) basis over several months. The last thing you need is
an inconvenient journey to and from the appointment.
 At your first appointment
• Ask the same questions you ask your other specialists. (See
Chapter 6 for these questions.)
• Be prepared to describe the symptoms that led you to seek help.
• Listen to the therapist’s possible plan for treatment (medications,
talk therapy, or both).
Listen for language like “in cases like yours . . .” that suggests a
generalized rather than a customized approach to therapy. If this
one-size-fits-all seems to be the therapist’s approach, keep looking.
 After the first appointment, keep in mind that a genuine trust and con-
nection with this person is key to successfully conquering your symp-
toms. Give yourself time to think about the first meeting — what went
well and what disturbed you — before keeping a second appointment.
Check with your insurance provider (or Medicare/Medicaid if appropriate) to
find out what services are covered. If your insurance provider doesn’t cover
mental health services (or only covers a portion), ask the therapist whether
he has a sliding fee scale based on income.
Sharing the emotional journey 
with a support group
A support group can be a real lifesaver for many people with a chronic, pro-
gressive condition (and their care partners). Through these gatherings, you
can hear about valuable coping skills and keep up with the latest myths and
190
Part III: Crafting a Treatment Plan Just for You 

bona fide medical advances. Generally, each group has a facilitator with pro-
fessional experience in working with PWP and their care partners. This objec-
tive, outside facilitator has the following responsibilities:
 Keeps the discussion moving
 Doesn’t allow a few outspoken participants to highjack the meeting so
quieter personalities fade into the background (and eventually leave the
group)
 Covers the logistics: Meeting place and time, special speakers or pro-
grams, and notices of meetings
The most successful groups determine their own personality and style. The
following are examples of group formats:
 Participants talk about PD news and personal updates. They support
one another emotionally and offer ideas for coping.
 A speaker presents a specific topic for discussion.
 The group has a political focus, such as getting Congress to allocate
research dollars that will put PD on the front burner for finding a cure.
(See information on the Parkinson’s Action Network in Appendix B.)
 Some groups include all of these formats, alternating support with spe-
cific programs and advocacy projects.
PWP and their care partners are indeed fortunate to have a number of
national organizations that offer support groups through their regional or
state chapters. To see whether such a group is available in your area, check
www.parkinson.org or www.caregiver.org.
Two other possible resources are the community education and outreach
department of your local hospital or the local PD exercise class we describe
in Chapter 12.
If your area has zero groups specifically for PWP or their care partners, con-
sider starting one. See the sidebar “Building a support group: From me to we
in five easy steps” to get started.
Whether you join an established group or start one yourself, support groups
can enrich your life beyond anything you can imagine because you
 Connect with people who truly understand the challenges of living 
with PD.
 Have the opportunity to laugh and cry together.
 Can advocate for better treatments and a cure.
 Can make an enormous difference for yourself and for those who love
and care for you.
191

Making lifestyle changes to 
improve your point of view
Two words: exercise and diet. (But you can check out Chapter 12 for a few
more words.) It’s no secret that research shows how regular exercise and a
properly balanced diet can work wonders for your health. But just in case you
need a refresher on some of those wonders, did you know that exercise can
 Boost the power of neurotransmitters in your brain to enhance your
mood and your ability to look at life more positively?
192
Part III: Crafting a Treatment Plan Just for You 
Building a support group: From me to we
in five easy steps
The steps for starting a PD support group are
relatively simple:
1. Ask your doctor or neurologist to tell other
PD patients and their care partners that
you’re interested in organizing a group.
Provide cards with your contact information
for the doctor to give to interested PWP.
These people can then contact you (not the
other way around).
2. Gather the following information:
 Ask your local hospital or home care
agency whether they have anyone qualified
and willing to facilitate the group.
 Find out whether your local library, book-
store, coffeehouse, or medical clinic has a
room available for 10 to 12 people for two
hours once a month at no charge.
3. Consider initially combining PWP and care
partners in the same group.
As the group grows, you may hold separate
meetings for the PWP and care partners.
4. When at least four people have expressed
interest, call an organizational meeting and
ask these people to invite other PWP or
care partners.
5. At the first meeting:
 Have 
nametags 
and 
perhaps 
light 
refreshments.
 Ask attendees to briefly introduce them-
selves and state what they’re looking for in
a support group.
 Establish the working details for the group:
when and where to meet; how often; for
how long; dues, if any, to cover cost of
refreshments or mailings; and programs or
format style of the group.
 If possible, ask an experienced support-
group facilitator to lead this meeting.
 If you don’t have a trained facilitator, con-
sider professionals speakers to lead the
first several meetings. Then alternate the
leader role and assign responsibilities
(meeting room, program, and participant
notifications) for the next three months.
 End the meeting by checking everyone’s
contact information and allowing time for
people to socialize and get to know each
other better.

 Relieve muscle tension when your body’s natural instinct is to tense up
in response to a challenge?
 Enhance your self-image, which leads to greater self-assurance and con-
fidence, which increase your ability to deal with negative stress?
Not a bad return on an investment of only 30 to 60 minutes a day!
As for diet, start with a simple choice like lessening stimulants (such as caf-
feine and chocolate) that can contribute to your anxiety. Ready to kick it up a
notch? Educate yourself about the mind-enhancing powers of certain food
groups. (For more information on diet and nutrition, see Chapter 12.) When
you combine these power foods with regular exercise, you have the right for-
mula to make an enormous difference in your emotional state of mind and
self-image.
Alternative therapies (such as relaxation and meditation) and mind-exercise
programs (such as T’ai Chi and yoga) can also be enormously effective in
relieving the symptoms of anxiety and depression. See Chapter 11 for more
info on each of these techniques.
Don’t worry — Be happy
No doubt you’d like to remind us that PD isn’t exactly humorous. But at least
one of us (the author with PD) knows all too well that finding humor in the
mishaps and misadventures with PD is no different from finding humor in
other life challenges (like the impossible in-law or the service people who
don’t show up and then don’t give much service when they do get there).
The following sections provide a few tips for ways you (and your partner)
can fight anxiety, depression, and apathy.
Just say the word
One PWP came up with the acronym S.O.F.A. (as in “Get off the sofa”) to
remind himself that anxiety, apathy, and depression were dangerous areas for
anyone with PD. Sadness can lead to Obstructions (of physical and mental abili-
ties) that lead to a Fall (the danger for any PWP), so the only cure is Ambition
(to get moving — physically, mentally, and spiritually). This acronym may not
work for you, but try one of your own — a password that empowers you and
your care partner when anxiety and depression start to rear their ugly heads.
The crème’ de la comedy
Renowned essayist and editor Norman Cousins pioneered the idea of laugh-
ter as medical therapy. In his book, Anatomy of an Illness, Cousins describes
how he watched hours of classics like the Marx brothers and I Love Lucy. As a
result of his and other researchers’ work, laughter is now a respected ther-
apy that supplements mainstream medicine.
193
Chapter 13: Combating Anxiety and Depression

Did you hear the one about . . .
At your next support group meeting, suggest the group indulge in some laugh
therapy for 15 to 20 minutes by sharing funny incidents. After all, who else
can understand the ridiculousness of trying to shave (if you’re a man) or
pulling on a pair of pantyhose (if you’re a woman)? Who else but PWP can
laugh out loud and not seem cruel when you describe yourself hurrying to
catch an elevator?
The humor you find in PD is, of course, bittersweet, but don’t permit the
bitter to overpower the sweet. Choosing to laugh at yourself — and the frus-
trations and mishaps with PD — offers a healthy dose of the absurd that’ll
work better than any pill. The ability to laugh can work miracles.
194
Part III: Crafting a Treatment Plan Just for You 
It’s not all about you: Ways to look beyond your PD
One sure way to get past the poor-pitiful-me
piece is to focus less on yourself and ramp up
your attention to other people. This simple
change can also remind other people to stop
viewing you as someone with an incurable con-
dition and start seeing you as the vital, loving,
and giving person you’ve always been.
Fresh out of ideas? Not surprising. But, hey,
that’s why we’re here. Pick any one of the fol-
lowing and see what happens:
 If a clerk or service person gives especially
good service, tell him and then tell his boss.
 Offer to trade seats on a bus, train, or plane
to let a family or couple sit together — even
if you end up with the dreaded middle seat.
 Find old pictures of family members, frame
them, and send them to the person with a
note that recalls what the photos mean 
to you.
 Look beneath the surface. When a friend’s
in a crummy mood, know that it probably
goes well beyond the surface. Acknowledge
that she seems to be having a bad day and
ask if there’s anything you can do to help.
 Pass along a good book you’ve just finished
or make special scrapbooks or family
recipe books for the children in your family.
 If you’re a gardener and need to divide your
perennials, offer the new neighbor some
plants from your garden. (They can do the
digging!)
 Put an extra coin in an expired meter.
 Call the clerks and other service people that
you regularly see by name.
 Take a treat to your co-workers, even if you
have to buy rather than bake it.
 Use the magic words, “Please” and “Thank
you,” and make a big deal out of someone
going the extra mile for you.
Focusing on other people — caring for and
about them — is possibly the simplest way to
move beyond your self-pity and angst about PD.
Of course, it’s not a cure for clinical depression
or anxiety, but caring for others is a major first-
step in changing your destructive, negative 
self-talk to something far more positive and life-
affirming. Bottom line? It is indeed better to give
(care and concern) than to receive (pity and
avoidance).

Tapping into the power of positive thinking
The ability to enjoy life — to be content — is often bound up in the need to
be in control. But how much can anyone really control? The next hour, day,
or year? Nope. The only control you really have lies in how you choose to
react to life’s circumstances and challenges. And when you choose to react
with a sense of humor and a positive life outlook, research suggests three
possible benefits:
 You’ll greatly reduce your physical and emotional stress and greatly
enhance your relationships with other people.
 Your outlook will be contagious. By setting the tone (as we suggest in
Chapter 5), you can help your care partners (professional and personal)
accept the diagnosis and move forward with you.
 You’ll have an aura of self-confidence that also inspires people around
you (who may be tempted to nurture or baby you) to step back and let
you take the lead. They’ll be more inclined to make decisions with you
than for you.
Your attitude can very well be the difference between taking control of this
disease and allowing PD to control you. How much better to hear people
marvel at your incredibly upbeat and positive attitude toward PD than to
hear them talk in tones of pity and sympathy!
So how can you change a glass that’s half-empty into a glass that’s half-full?
More to the point, is it even possible to change it, given your PD diagnosis?
Optimists tend to believe that good things do happen and bad things are just
temporary challenges. Fortunately, enhancing your optimistic side is within
reach. Check out these tips for becoming more optimistic:
 Find the joy — in work, in relationships, in everyday stuff like preparing
a meal, cleaning, repairing something, getting dressed, and meeting the
day head-on.
 Surround yourself with people who are positive, upbeat, and optimistic.
 Commit random acts of kindness (not original to us, but we like the
sound of it!) by looking beyond yourself to the needs of others (see the
sidebar, “It’s not all about you: Ways to look beyond your PD.”
 Accept and work through situations you can control; let go of those you
can’t. (Does the word serenity come to mind?)
 Be aware of your reactions. Banish negative self-talk (“I can’t,” or 
“I never . . .”), and look for underlying traits you admire (or even love) in
the family members and friends who irritate you.
 At the end of every day, write or tell yourself three good things (okay,
they can be really little) that happened that day.

Chapter 13: Combating Anxiety and Depression

As Garrison Keillor, author and host of the popular radio program, Prairie
Home Companion, once said, “They say such nice things about people at
their funerals that it makes me sad that I’m going to miss mine by just a 
few days.”
A Word for the PD Care Partner
Given the nature of depression, anxiety, and apathy, it’s most likely that 
you — not the PWP — will need to be vigilant about recognizing symptoms
and getting help to break the cycle. These are a few actions you can take:
 Pay attention. Look at the PWP’s body language. Listen to what she says
(or doesn’t say). Sure, that mask (lack of facial expression) or stooped
posture may be a result of PD, but is something else at work here? If the
person you love seems persistently uninvolved and disinterested in the
normal routine you two once enjoyed, those clues need your attention.
 Don’t be afraid to ask questions. Your PWP may have a logical but cur-
able reason for appearing to be depressed, apathetic, or anxious.
Through gentle questioning, maybe you can get him to admit his con-
cern so the two of you can talk about it (and address it with his doctor).
On the other hand, if his answer to all your questions is something like
“There’s nothing wrong,” he may have more troubling him than he can
manage. In that case, you can:
• Offer information from PD Web sites (see Appendix B) and books
like this one that clearly demonstrates how such feelings are
common for PWP and can be treated.
• Suggest that he talk to his neurologist about his emotions and ask
whether these unusual feelings are treatable.
 Talk to the experts. If the PWP refuses to address your concern that he
may be depressed or suffering from anxiety or apathy, contact the neu-
rologist yourself and ask for help. Or ask the care partners in your sup-
port group whether they’ve dealt with these issues. If they have, ask for
some suggestions on how you can follow through.
Don’t forget to take care of you
Being the primary care partner for a PWP will — over time — become a 
natural piece of your life. Before you realize it, the role is more than a daily
routine; it’s part of your identity. “That’s Joan Sutton. Her husband has
Parkinson’s,” someone may say, implying that your husband’s condition
somehow identifies you as well.
196
Part III: Crafting a Treatment Plan Just for You 

The processes of partnering in care and caregiving requires constant adjust-
ment. Understandably you’ll have days (and weeks) of exhaustion, frustra-
tion, and depression. But, interspersed will be moments of such high drama,
joy, and sharing that you find the will and energy to fight on. You make an
enormous difference for the PWP. The support and care you provide is vital,
important work.
The danger comes when you try to do it all (or at least more than you
should), and you burn out. The signs of burnout aren’t that different from
depression (see the earlier section, “Depression — More than just sad and
blue”). Decide now to watch out for these signs and give yourself permission
to take a break, hand off some of the responsibility to others, and most of all,
have a life of your own.
Positive steps you can take
We recommend the following ways to help you hang in there:
 Identify and nurture your personal support system. You need people
to be there just for you — to listen to and comfort you. You’re dealing
with a host of feelings including grief and bereavement. If you feel so iso-
lated that you can’t think of anyone to talk to, you need to consider
seeking some counseling. Ask your primary care doctor to recommend a
counselor, or perhaps your clergyperson is able to help.
 Join a support group! We can’t stress this enough. The underlying
cause of depression in care partners is a sense of isolation. The people
you meet in a support group don’t replace your best friends, but they do
give you a place to vent and share PD war stories.
 Give yourself a break — an actual physical break — every day if possi-
ble. Use your support network to come in and take over for an hour.
Take this time for yourself. Go for a walk, watch a movie, grab some
coffee. Don’t use your personal time for tasks like paying the bills or call-
ing the insurance company.
 Keep your priorities straight. Your health is vital to the PWP, so exer-
cise, eat a balanced diet, and maintain your own social interactions and
activities.

t’s one thing to say that a new drug or treatment works in a monkey or
mouse, but it’s quite another to take that next leap and declare the prod-
uct safe and effective for people. Research scientists make that leap by con-
ducting clinical trials (experiments) that use human volunteers.
Okay, interesting, you say, but not exactly a priority for you at the moment.
But maybe it should be. Why? Because you can make a difference — for your-
self and for those who follow you down this path of Parkinson’s disease 
(PD) — by getting involved. Want to know how? Read on.
What Is a Clinical Trial and 
Why Should You Care?
Clinical trials (also called clinical research studies) answer certain questions
related to a specific health condition. They’re also an important hurdle
before new therapies for the treatment, management, and cure of a disease
can be approved and marketed. Without such trials, therapeutic advance-
ment is impossible. But eventually these studies require human participation.
That’s where you and other people living with Parkinson’s disease (PWP)
come in.

Recently major PD organizations have formed an alliance to build awareness
of clinical trials among PWP. In addition to making more persons with PD
(and their physicians) aware of clinical trials for treatments — and even a
cure — these organizations offer some good reasons for participation:
 If more people living with PD volunteer to participate in a trial, the test-
ing and marketing periods (on average 12 to 15 years) can be cut in half,
a whopping 6 to 7 years shorter.
 If the testing and marketing periods can be cut, then new therapies can
be available sooner and at a lower cost. (For you curious souls, the aver-
age cost to bring a single new medicine to market is approximately $800
million.)
The statistics tell their own story. According to a presentation at the 2006
World Parkinson’s Congress, only 1 percent of PD patients participate in a
study compared to 5 percent of the total cancer community. Although both
stats seem small, the National Cancer Institute estimates that, if they can
double the number of participants in clinical trials for cancer, many studies can
be completed in one year (rather than the current three to five years). Simply
doubling the numbers can have an enormous effect on the researchers’ and the
industry’s ability to understand PD (its causes and course), find advanced
treatments, and make those treatments available sooner.
But, before you volunteer, you need to understand how clinical trials work as
well as their benefits and risks. The following sections explain this process.
Taking a Close Look at the Process
This section explains in a nutshell how the clinical trial usually unfolds. Like
most topics in the world of medicine and science, the subject of clinical trials
comes with its own unique vocabulary, so we clearly define each term when
we introduce it.
First, to get a clinical trial underway, a team of research scientists must deter-
mine the general category of their clinical trial. Their options include
 Interventional trials: Scientists test experimental treatments and drugs
or new ways of using existing therapies with groups of patients under
controlled conditions.
 Observational trials: Researchers study a specific health issue (such as
aging or stress) with a large group of people in their natural home, work,
or community setting.
Note: In this chapter we discuss only an interventional trial, but you may par-
ticipate in either type of trial for PD.
200
Part III: Crafting a Treatment Plan Just for You 

Next, the team applies for approval from an Institutional Review Board (IRB)
to conduct the clinical trial. The IRB is a group of physicians, statisticians,
researchers, community advocates, and others that meets independently of
the research group and ensures that the trial protocol is ethical and that the
rights of study participants are protected.
After the IRB approves the trial, the team follows the study’s protocol
(roadmap), which outlines the process, establishes timelines for completion
of each step, and describes the profile of participants. The research team
evaluates the safety and effectiveness of the trial drug, but the protocol spec-
ifies safeguards for monitoring the overall health of participants throughout
the trial.
Researchers conduct studies in phases.
 Phase 1 usually tests the therapy on a small group (20 to 80) of healthy
volunteers to assess potential side effects and risks.
 Phase 2 tests the therapy on a larger group of people (100 or more) who
have PD and evaluates the effectiveness and side effects of the therapy.
 Phase 3 tests the therapy on at least 500 volunteers with PD and com-
pares the new therapy with therapies currently available.
Although trials may go through several stages and take years to complete,
they’re still the fastest, safest way to discover and test any new treatment,
medicine, and medical device before these products are available to the gen-
eral public.
In every trial the research team establishes certain qualifiers for selecting
participants. These are the exclusion/inclusion guidelines for the study. For
example, the study may include people over the age of 60 but exclude anyone
under that age. Or, if liver problems are known side effects of the drug, then
individuals who already deal with liver problems are excluded. Criteria can
cover gender, age, even weight or geographical location. Such guidelines are
included in the trial’s description.
After participants are selected (that’s you!), they sign a document of
informed consent (which we discuss in more detail later in the chapter in
“Considering the Benefits and Risks Before Signing on”) and are assigned to a
treatment group (where everyone receives the same form of treatment). The
study may include one group for the experimental drug, one for an existing
drug that’s the current preferred treatment, and one for a placebo.
A placebo is a medicine with no active ingredients — no way of medically
effecting change either for better or worse — so your symptoms remain
unchanged. (You may have heard people talk about the placebo effect, mean-
ing the observed effects arise from the patient’s expectations rather than
from the treatment itself.) In clinical trials, researchers want to remove that
201
Chapter 14: Clinical Trials and Your Role in the Search for a Cure

placebo factor from the equation. However, as many as 30 percent of patients
who receive a placebo in a trial report improvement. This result seems to be
especially true in PD because the just the possibility of getting a better medi-
cine can create the expectation of a reward and liberate dopamine (the chem-
ical in your brain that controls movement). This placebo effect is one reason
that research for PD is so difficult and takes so long.
In other words, trial participants usually go into one of two treatment groups:
participants who receive the real treatment or drug and participants who
receive a treatment that only looks like the real deal but doesn’t have any of
the active ingredients.
Double-blind studies are the preferred design for testing new therapies today
because they assure objectivity throughout the study. In double-blind stud-
ies, participants don’t know which treatment group they’re in, and the
researcher doesn’t know which group is getting the test therapy. In single-
blind studies, only the participant or the researcher (but not both) knows
which group is receiving the placebo and which is taking the actual drug. In
open label studies, both the doctor and the study subject know what drug is
administered.
Clinical trial researchers must adhere to the strict standards of the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA), the government bureau that monitors trials and
approves research to move on to the next stage. After the trial progresses
through its stages and is successful, the FDA signs off, and the new treatment
(or medicine or medical device) becomes available to the general public.
(There’s a lot more red tape involved, but you get the gist.)
Considering the Benefits and 
Risks Before Signing on
By taking part in a clinical trial, you’re
 Taking that proactive role that we’ve encouraged throughout this book.
 Gaining access to new therapies before they become available to the
general public.
 Contributing to the cure for a disease that you wouldn’t wish on your
worst enemy.
 Getting the expert attention of scientists and healthcare professionals.
These benefits are fairly impressive but, of course, they come with risks, and
those can be major. Although major risks are rare, you still need to know
what you may be up against before you sign up. These are some possibilities:
202
Part III: Crafting a Treatment Plan Just for You 

 The treatment may have unforeseen side effects.
 The experimental treatment may not work for you.
 The trial may have costs associated with participating — travel to and
from the trial site, for example.
Before you decide to participate in a trial (assuming you meet the needs of
the study and have been invited to participate), you’ll be asked to sign a doc-
ument of informed consent. This document is your agreement that you’ve
received the key information about the clinical trial (its purpose, how long it
will last, what’s expected of you, and the names and contact information for
the research team). Your signature on this document also indicates that
you’re aware of the risks, potential side effects, and potential benefits of the
treatment. Take your time. Talk the document over with your family, your
doctor, and even your attorney to get a full picture of what you’re agreeing 
to. Note: If the document has way too much fine print, ask for a large print
version — literally and figuratively.
The informed consent is not a contract or legally binding document for you
or the company/institution conducting the trial. You have the right to with-
draw from the trial at any time you choose. But keep in mind that participa-
tion of people like you brings us closer to a cure — faster.
Although the informed consent is intended to protect the patient, you’re still
responsible for understanding all you can about the trial before agreeing to
participate. You must ask the important questions such as what happens (to
your body and brain) during the trial and, more importantly, what the risks
are and how the team handles any adverse reaction. Answers to these ques-
tions are especially important if you’re participating in a study for surgical
treatment of PD.
Taking the First Steps into Volunteering
To volunteer, you first have to know where to look. Clinical trials start all the
time all over the country. The key is to find a trial that’s convenient for you,
that’s actively enrolling participants, and that you and your doctor believe
may help your individual situation. Ready to get started? Read on.
Finding clinical trials for PD
The most efficient way to shop for clinical trials is the Internet. Two excellent
Web sites are www.PDtrials.org and www.clinicaltrials.gov. Both
sites give you important base information about locations of trials, exclusion/
inclusion criteria, and other facts that can help you rule out certain studies
203
Chapter 14: Clinical Trials and Your Role in the Search for a Cure

right away. If you don’t have access to a computer, ask a friend who has one
to help you, or go to your local library and ask the librarian to assist you in
browsing these sites.
Also you can call PD Trials at 800-801-9484 and request to be on the mailing
list for periodic information and updates related to PD trials and studies.
Volunteering to participate
Volunteering to participate in a trial is not as simple as volunteering at your
local library or school. Each study or trial works under a strict set of guide-
lines and standards, and participants must meet certain specific criteria.
These restrictions assure that new therapies are tested under the most
appropriate conditions to prove or disprove the study team’s theories.
Don’t get discouraged or take it personally if your application is denied. Keep
trying to participate because the future of new treatments (and perhaps one
day a cure) needs you!
These are the steps you need to take to be part of a clinical trial:
1. Find a trial through the resources we list earlier in this section.
2. Read the description and record the number that begins with NCT
(the official assigned trial number) and all contact details.
3. Call or e-mail the contact; include any initial questions you have and
request more detailed information about the study or trial.
4. Discuss your interest in volunteering for this trial with your neurolo-
gist and your family; if possible, talk with people who’ve participated
in past clinical trials.
5. If you don’t qualify for a certain trial (or the trial has the full quota of
participants), ask the coordinator to stay in touch.
The trial may need more participants as it moves forward, or the con-
tact person may become aware of other trials that better match your
profile.
6. Keep a record of your calls, e-mails, and conversations, noting dates
and responses. Make follow-up calls if you haven’t heard back from
the coordinator in a timely manner — within two to three weeks.
Trial coordinators are juggling many calls and details, so be patient about a
reasonable response time. On the other hand, be persistent and ask when
you can expect a response.
204
Part III: Crafting a Treatment Plan Just for You 

Never volunteer for a trial just because you think you may get free medicines
because you may end up in the placebo group. And always question any trial
that offers you significant monetary reward if you join. Payments for expenses
and medical care are one thing; pay-outs to get you in the door are something
else entirely and should raise a huge red flag. Similarly, if your doctor seems
overly anxious to sell you the idea of participating, you need to question the
doctor whether he’s receiving an incentive from the trial sponsor to recruit
patients.
Asking Important Questions 
Before Committing
An invitation to participate or an approval of your eligibility for a study doesn’t
obligate you to sign up. Before you make that decision, gather as much infor-
mation as possible. Address your questions directly to the research team
205
Chapter 14: Clinical Trials and Your Role in the Search for a Cure
Why prescription drugs cost so much
Unless you’ve been living on another planet for
the last decade or so, you already know that
prescription medications don’t come cheap. Of
course, we can assume that pharmaceutical
companies are not in business for the good of
mankind — at least not entirely. These compa-
nies are businesses and, by definition, they
want to make a profit. (“But do they need to
make such a large profit?” you ask. The answer
depends on who you ask. All we’re going to say
is that, in America, capitalism remains king.)
Seriously though, the journey to discover and
develop new therapies for treating disease is
long, costly, and fraught with uncertainties.
Nearly half of all new medicines and therapies
come from laboratories and clinical studies in
the United States. The system may be cumber-
some, but it works.
European countries often get bogged down by
each country having its own approval protocol;
a drug readily available in one country may be
years away from approval for distribution in a
neighboring country. That situation would be
like taking the approval process away from the
FDA in the United States and handing it over to
the individual states. In that case, the drug you
need may be approved for distribution in
California, but you live in Maine, where it’s still
three years away from final approval.
Think of it this way: Every purchase has a value
beyond its dollars and cents cost. Ask yourself
what the value of a new therapy for PD means
to you and your family. Ask yourself the value 
of finding a cure. Like those ads for the credit-
card company: a prescription that relieves
symptoms — $xx; a new medical device that
enhances movement — $xxx; a cure for PD —
priceless. Keep in mind that your health and
safety through the course of that journey is also
priceless.

even though many of the answers are in the informed consent document
(check the “Considering the Benefits and Risks Before Signing on” section
earlier in this chapter for more on this document). We suggest you ask the
questions in person, not over the phone or via e-mail, so you can judge for
yourself exactly how on board they are with the information in the informed
consent. Most people can’t imagine buying a car or home without meeting
the dealer or realtor face-to-face. Participating in a clinical trial can be far
more important than a car or a home.
For that meeting with the team, come prepared with your questions in writ-
ing. Bring someone along to act as scribe so you can focus on listening and
assessing the unspoken responses of the team. Better yet, bring along a tape
recorder and record the meeting so you can play it back later as you make
your decision.
In a face-to-face meeting, you want to ask:
 What’s the purpose of the study? According to the National Institutes of
Health, studies may be conducted for one or a combination of reasons:
• Testing experimental drugs or approaches to therapy
• Testing to determine ways to prevent disease
• Testing to discover new ways of diagnosing a disease
• Testing ways of detecting a specific disease
• Testing ways that patient comfort and quality of life may be
improved in chronic illness
 Who’s sponsoring the study? Sponsorship for a clinical trial can come
from a variety of sources including pharmaceutical companies, private
foundations, universities and medical centers, biotech companies, or
even the government. When you know the sponsor (read that as funding
source), you can better determine whether it’s a reputable and reliable
source with the funds necessary to see the research through in spite of
any glitches along the way.
 Who’s conducting the study? The members of the research team should
be well qualified to manage the study and safeguard the health and well
being of participants during the study. Because the study team has been
approved by the IRB (see the earlier section “Taking a Close Look at the
Process”), you may want to ask this question simply to better identify
the role of each member.
 Why does the research team believe the therapy or research question
will be helpful or effective in the treatment or management of PD?
The answer should cover information about previous studies. Perhaps
they’ve already tested animals; maybe researchers in another country
have tested (or even used) the therapy.
206
Part III: Crafting a Treatment Plan Just for You 

 In what ways does this therapy differ from the current treatment regi-
men for PD? The answer can help you gauge whether the difference
between your current therapies and the new drug or treatment is sub-
stantial enough to warrant your participation in the test.
 What tests and treatments will be performed in the course of the
study? With this answer you start to get specific information about their
expectations of you.
 Where will those tests and treatments be administered? The conve-
nience of the study site is important because you need to be there
during the course of the trial. An important follow-up question is, “How
often will I need to come to the site?”
 During the study, who will be in charge of my PD care and my general
healthcare? The answer should make it crystal clear that someone is
going to take charge of your general care during the trial.
 Will hospitalization be necessary at any time during the trial? If the
answer is yes, be sure to ask about the length of stay, where you’ll be
hospitalized, and who’ll pay the bill.
 What are the risks — potential side effects — of the treatment or
study? One of the primary reasons for the trial is to determine the risks
and side effects. Still, the team has some idea of what they anticipate,
and you should know these facts before you agree to participate.
 How will your current treatment be affected during the trial? You
need to know whether your current medication regimen for managing
your PD symptoms will be interrupted, changed, or stopped altogether
during the study.
 How long will the trial last? Trials can last for a matter of weeks,
months, or even years (usually the longer trials focus on quality-of-life
issues). The research team needs to be clear about the time this study
will take, but only you can decide whether the time is reasonable for you.
 What will it cost and who will pay? You can reasonably expect
expenses directly related to the study to be covered during the course
of the study. In addition, you may receive a stipend for some indirect
costs, such as mileage to and from the study site. You should not expect
the study to cover the costs of managing your general health. In other
words, a study for a new PD therapy probably won’t include payment for
that dental crown you’ve needed.
 Under what circumstances would the trial or study be stopped? Trials
may be stopped for any one of several reasons. In the most serious cir-
cumstances, the government can stop a trial because side effects and
risks become too common and serious. In another case, a company may
halt a trial because a competing drug has been approved and is coming
to market. Follow-up questions here are: “How will participants be noti-
fied if a trial is stopped?” and “What follow-up can participants expect?”
207
Chapter 14: Clinical Trials and Your Role in the Search for a Cure

For example, will there be regular (as in quarterly or annual) check-ups
to see how you’re doing and will you have a contact person in the event
of a change in your reaction to the medication or therapy down the
road?
 After the trial’s complete, will you still have access to the trial therapy
if it’s worked for you? Especially if you’re participating in an early
phase of the trial and the new therapy seems to make a difference for
you, you want to know that you’ll be able to continue taking the medi-
cine or receiving the treatment.
 What if you agree to participate but you change your mind after a few
weeks? You always have the right to leave a study. Ask this question to
understand how your decision to leave in the middle of a study may
affect the overall results.
As you collect the information and ask any follow-up questions, pay attention
to details such as how they refer to you and other participants; you want to
be the patient, subject, or participant and never the (heaven forbid!) number.
Following this interview, check with these people before you make your final
decision about volunteering:
 Your doctor(s) to discuss the potential benefits and risks of participation.
 Your family to discuss any reservations they may have.
 Your attorney to review the document of informed consent.
As you weigh your decision, remember that you’re a key stakeholder in this
process. Don’t be a passive participant; instead, take your place at this table
as an equal player. The research team may have the degrees and fancy titles,
but you’re the key to that treasure — finding new and more effective thera-
pies for PD and, one day, its cure.

Living Well 
with PD

In this part . . .
H
aving Parkinson’s disease may well change your
lifestyle, but it doesn’t have to be a life sentence. In
this section we explore ways that you can maintain the
relationships and activities that give your life meaning and
purpose. We also pass along ideas on the best ways to
manage your PD on the job. Last but not least, we take a
look at adapting and adjusting to the changes that a pro-
gressive condition can bring.

Chapter 15
Maintaining Healthy Relationships
In This Chapter
 Renewing your relationship with your significant other
 Keeping kids — young and old, near and far — in the loop
 Maintaining close ties with the grandchildren
 Accepting help from your first family
 Letting friends be friends
 Keeping your sense of self
Your relationships with family and friends (as well as those you’ll create
with healthcare professionals, support group members, and others along
this journey) can hold the key to successfully managing your Parkinson’s dis-
ease (PD) symptoms over the long haul. In sharp contrast, shutting yourself
off from people or permitting those who have loved and supported you to
drift away can only make matters worse — for you and for them.
But your relationships will change. The shifts you see in balance and roles
will be healthy for and vital to maintaining a full, productive life. In this chap-
ter, we take a more in-depth look at these key relationships. After seeing how
your PD can affect each of these relationships, we offer suggestions for bring-
ing those relationships back in line so that you (and the other people) under-
stand that your bond hasn’t changed just because you have PD.
Normal is a relative term in life. With any luck, it includes the people and
activities that bring satisfaction and contentment to your days. But having PD
doesn’t mean you need to start from scratch on a new definition of normal —
the fundamentals are still there. Although you do need to get creative as you
adapt your routines to PD, you don’t need to abandon those people and
activities that brought you happiness before your diagnosis.

Life, PD, and Your Significant Other
Your relationship with your significant other is likely your most important
and cherished relationship. This person is the one you can trust with your
deepest (and sometimes most unpleasant) feelings and thoughts; who’ll be
there in spite of your anger, fear, and bouts of self-pity; who’ll laugh with you
when your performance of some task borders on the ridiculous. This person
is the one who’ll act as your advocate when speaking for yourself is difficult,
who’ll remind you that you both have lives outside of PD, and who’ll affirm
that you’re the same person you always were. This person is your primary
care partner and, perhaps one day, your caregiver.
Sharing the journey
When one partner in a relationship gets a diagnosis of PD, that diagnosis may
seem to be for both of you. Both lives will be affected every day. But how the
two of you face that fact and prepare for the inevitable changes can be the
difference between strengthening your relationship and straining it to the
breaking point. The good news is that for most couples, facing a challenge
like PD as partners actually strengthens the relationship.
If this relationship is new and relatively untested by life’s normal challenges,
be sure each of you knows what living with PD will likely mean. And if the
relationship is longstanding but was beginning to show signs of wear and tear
before the diagnosis, both of you need to face that at the outset.
Sharing the PD journey is bound to put an extra strain on the relationship —
at least part of the time. In either case (that is, new but untested or estab-
lished but shaky), seek the counsel of a trusted and objective third party
before leaping into full-blown care-partner mode. If it’s not a good fit with
your significant other, you need to discuss what role your partner can
manage and then decide who else in the family or close circle (perhaps an
adult child, sibling, or extremely good friend) can step up.
When you get the confirmed diagnosis (see Chapter 5), each of you needs
time to digest the news and react. And the first reaction for one or both of you
may be denial. Or maybe your partner will become overprotective and treat
you as if you’re gravely ill. Underneath your partner may first feel cheated out
of the life you had planned and then angry at such a selfish thought when
you’re the one facing a debilitating illness. Financial concerns may pop up;
your partner may wonder about the costs and sacrifices involved.
Neither you nor your partner may admit any of these feelings initially. Big
mistake. (Again, check out Chapter 5 for more specific information about the
pitfalls of the early days after diagnosis.)

Part IV: Living Well with PD

Warning! Trouble ahead!
After you’ve both had time to let the diagnosis sink in, you need to prepare to
face some common pitfalls that can result when one partner has PD and the
other remains healthy. Here are three of the most common:
 Changes in the dynamics of your partnership: With PD in the equation,
roles can shift. For example, now that you have PD, your wife’s job is
more important than ever because your health insurance is through her
employer. Understand that this puts added stress on your partnership.
Not only is she facing a new role as your care partner, but she’s also
facing the stress of performing her best at work so her job (and that vital
insurance) is secure.
At the same time, your traditional role as the head of the house and
breadwinner (if you bring home the larger paycheck) is also stressed.
You both need that paycheck, but how will your PD affect your ability to
perform at work and for how long? (See Chapter 16 for a full discussion
of PD in the workplace.) Your best bet is to prepare for such role
changes by talking them through — with a counselor if necessary.
 Co-dependency (not a good thing): Co-dependency occurs when your
care partner is more invested in managing your PD than you are. The
danger here lies in your partner abandoning major pieces of his own life
in order to take control of the situation, to fulfill what he perceives to be
your needs and wishes. When his perception and your needs don’t jive,
resentment quickly follows.
He resents doing his best but not being appreciated (plus he’s surren-
dering pieces of his own life to offer you this unappreciated gift!). You
resent fighting as hard as you can to maintain independence and auton-
omy, and you feel guilty for adding to your partner’s anxiety and frustra-
tion by refusing — however gently — to accept his solutions.
 “But everyone else manages so well” syndrome: Remember Jackie
Kennedy after the assassination of JFK? In the face of this unspeakable
personal tragedy, she held a nation’s hand through the sheer force of
her grace, courage, attention to detail, and devotion to her children.
Spousal care partners may remind you of Jackie Kennedy and her
remarkable achievements. These men and women seem to do it all — and
do it with style. She works full-time, cooks, cleans, does the yard work,
manages the finances, provides the most complex level of personal care
for her partner, deals with the professionals, and maintains an active
family and social life. And the most annoying part is that she does it all
with an aura of serenity and calm that’s intimidating to say the least.
Beneath the most serene surface lie whirlpools of unspeakable pain, anxi-
ety, and even anger and resentment at the havoc PD is wreaking. Even
Jackie Kennedy’s calm façade cracked behind closed doors. Just like
super-partner, you and your partner do your best and that’s more than
enough in most cases to sustain the partnership during this difficult time.
213
Chapter 15: Maintaining Healthy Relationships

The next section offers a couple of concrete suggestions for avoiding the pit-
falls and getting on with living life.
Avoiding the pitfalls
In any life-partner relationship, certain passages come with the territory:
transitions, such as children growing up and going on to lives (and families)
of their own; lifestyle changes, like a bigger house, a better job, retirement,
and downsizing; and tough times, great times, chaotic times, and calm times.
Through it all, you and your partner have formed your own unique ways of
managing each passage. Now you face life with PD. It’s one more challenge —
but a big one, and one that’ll affect the rest of your lives.
Here are two keys to avoiding the pitfalls in your partnership while managing
the stresses and strains of living with PD:
 Communication and caring = coping: You’ll both have times when you
struggle to adapt to the changes caused by PD. Your partner may feel
stressed by all the extra responsibility. As the PWP, you may be
depressed and anxious for good reason. Take time to talk it out, to state
your needs, to listen to your partner’s concerns — even if you can’t
immediately solve the problem. If you’re seeing a counselor to manage
depression and anxiety (see Chapter 13), ask that person for tips for
improving communications during especially stressful times.
 Mutual respect — the foundation of successful relationships: Think
about all the reasons the two of you teamed up in the first place. You
loved her bubbly outgoing personality — so different from your shy,
quiet demeanor. She loved your take-charge-in-a-crisis style. The activi-
ties that gave you individual identities also strengthened you as a
couple. You aren’t clones; you complement (complete) each other. Now
one of you has PD and the other has been cast in this new role of care
partner. Just as you adapted in the past (when the kids came along or
one of you changed jobs), you can do that again.
Few relationships remain stagnant (at least those that survive and thrive
don’t). So chances are good that the dynamics of your partnership would
have changed and shifted whether or not you had PD. So, don’t permit your-
self (or your partner) to stress out about the possible changes you’ll face as
the years pass. And for heaven’s sake, don’t allow PD to keep you from enjoy-
ing the intimacy that comes with living in a loving partnership.
214
Part IV: Living Well with PD

Keeping the magic alive — Sex 
and intimacy in spite of PD
For some couples, one of the most challenging shifts can come in the area of
intimacy. You and your partner can either surrender to a loss in this area or
you can get creative and find new ways to share your love.
Humans take a certain amount of pride in their physical, mental, and even
emotional attractiveness. The diagnosis of a lifelong, debilitating condition
can play havoc with a person’s sense of self, and it can be especially devas-
tating for his or her sense of sexuality. The relationship you may have
enjoyed with your significant other for years — even decades — suddenly
comes under question. Can I adequately satisfy the needs of this person I
love? Is this person humoring me by pretending that nothing’s changed? Why
don’t I feel like being intimate even though I love this person? Doesn’t this
person deserve a whole lover?
Okay, just stop it. Take a moment to get the facts before you leap to unfounded
(and, in some cases, unnecessary) conclusions. These are the facts:
 When sexual needs and desires change, the root cause usually responds
to medication or other therapy. Check first with your primary care
physician to see whether the cause is treatable.
 If the change comes on the heels of the diagnosis — well, duh! You just
got some tough and depressing news. Talk about a mood crasher!
 As a matter of fact, depression and anxiety may well be symptoms of
your PD (see Chapter 13), so your sexual concerns may result from the
disease itself. And what about those prescription meds for depression?
Read the label. Most likely they list sexual dysfunction as a side effect.
 Certainly people with PD may experience performance anxiety, given the
facts that PD is a movement disorder, and good sex often involves coor-
dination and flexibility.
 Women’s fluctuating hormone balance in the perimenopausal years can
affect desire. Women with PD should be sure their gynecologist and neu-
rologist work together to regulate hormone replacement and antipark-
sonian medications.
 Unfortunately the effects of PD can play havoc with self-image. The mask
(inability to show facial expression) is one example. Struggling to
manage basic grooming (shaving your legs, styling your hair, putting on
make-up) can also make a woman feel less than desirable.
 If you’re male, you may experience episodes of erectile dysfunction —
another sideshow of PD — because the brain needs to work with the
body for you to maintain an erection.
215
Chapter 15: Maintaining Healthy Relationships

So what to do? Well, you don’t want to ignore any problem that may have a
solution. And sexual dysfunction is one of them. Let your doctor know
because treatments are available. For example, if depression is behind your
change in sexual interest, counseling may be the answer.
And for both your sakes, talk to your partner. Your partner may be having
problems as well. For example, when faced with a loved one’s diagnosis,
some partners leap light years ahead to the day (that may never come) when
the loved one can’t function at all. As a result, your partner goes into serious
protection mode and tries to avoid any activity that he or she thinks may
cause you more stress (and that includes sexual relations).
Yes, you and your partner may need to explore new ways of being intimate.
Gee — experiment with new ways to kiss, to hold each other, to touch, to. . . .
Sounds like a good thing!
Retaining personal space for each of you
Receiving a diagnosis of PD may draw the two of you even closer together,
but don’t make the mistake of abandoning your individual activities and con-
tacts. As much as you love and cherish each other, you still need some per-
sonal space from time to time. The richness of relationships is often rooted in
the fact that each has interests (and friends) that are unique. You may share
news about these activities and people with each other, but you both accept
that this is my activity or my friend and that’s okay.
In these early weeks, you have a lot to take in (tests, doctor’s appointments,
therapy sessions, and such). But if your partner has enjoyed a weekly card
game or volunteer activity for years and hasn’t been able to get back to it for
months now, this is a problem. And you need to lead by example. Take stock
of those individual activities and contacts you’ve let slide and get them back
on your calendar. Then insist that your partner do the same.
A second time that you and your partner are in danger of surrendering your
personal space occurs when your PD symptoms become more troublesome.
As your need for assistance and care escalates, your partner may become so
entrenched in caring for you that her own physical, mental, and emotional
well-being is jeopardized. Make it your job to prevent that problem from hap-
pening. Prepare in advance for ways each of you can protect your life beyond
PD. This strategy isn’t an act of selfishness; in the long run, this separateness
can bring the two of you closer and enrich the life you share. (Check out
Chapter 23 for more ways to care for your care partner.)

Part IV: Living Well with PD

PD and Kids — Adult or Younger
For people with Parkinson’s (PWP) who have children, the change in your
relationships will depend in part on the age of your children. A person with
young onset PD (see Chapter 8) may have very young children. But if your PD
was diagnosed later in life, your children may have children of their own
(your grandchildren) who will also need your attention. Regardless of their
age, children can become confused or alarmed when they hear that a parent
has PD. Some of that initial response comes from a knowledge base (or lack
of one) about PD and its progression. And some of the response can be
normal self-concern about life changes now that a parent is ill. In either case,
you need to reassure your children and include them as you and your care
partner make decisions that may affect their lives.
Addressing their fears about the future
“What if they need to use my college savings fund for Mom’s medical bills?”
“I thought we’d have more time before I needed to be there for my parents.”
You and your significant other need to discuss early on how to deliver the
news of your diagnosis to your children (see Chapter 7). After you tell them,
look for obvious and not-so-obvious reactions, such as withdrawal or slipping
grades when she was an honor student before the diagnosis. If you see mood
changes (such as increased irritability) or personality changes (your little
extrovert suddenly becomes quite the introvert), talk it out. You may con-
sider taking your preteen and teenage children with you to the next neurolo-
gist’s appointment so they can raise their own questions. Or consider going
with your child for some talk therapy with a counselor.
Regardless of your children’s ages, your positive outlook and sense of humor
will go a long way toward reassuring them that life won’t change much just
because you have PD. As time goes by (years — not weeks) and the PD
becomes more difficult to control, your children will adapt with you.
In the following sections, we give you some tips on discussing your PD with
your children, both young and adult.
When your children are young
If your children are very young (under age 10), keep your information simple.
But if young children ask questions or change their normal behavior toward
you, then those concerns need your attention. Just be careful not to blow
problems out of proportion. For example, your child’s very simple concern,
“Can I catch Parkinson’s like a cold?” may have an easy answer, “No.”
217
Chapter 15: Maintaining Healthy Relationships

Middle-schoolers (ages 10 to 13) need a more direct approach. Kids today
can get a lot of information through the Internet. The problem is when they
check sites that scare or worry them. Consider giving these children an
assignment; put them in charge of staying on top of and reporting the PD e-
news from the trusted sites listed in Appendix B. A specific assignment like
this can help a child feel a part of the solution. It’s vital that you avoid allow-
ing children of any age feel as if they’re being kept in the dark.
Teenagers (ages 14 to 19) are fully capable of participating in a family discus-
sion (see Chapter 7) and plan of action for managing household changes.
When included from the beginning, teens are more likely to take ownership
and responsibility for additional chores or tasks. Whenever you and your
partner reassess the plan and discuss necessary changes, include your teen.
A great way to empower children who are struggling with a parent’s illness is
to encourage them to raise funds for a national organization that’s searching
for a cure. Maybe your child can participate in a run or bike ride and ask for
donations. How about a lemonade stand? Kids like action. Help them take an
active (and proactive) role to raise awareness or money for research.
When your children are adults
Adult children may live at home, nearby, or miles away. They may be single,
married, have children of their own, have promising and demanding careers,
be in college or graduate school, or have a combination of these. The point is
that they’ve moved on (even if they’re still in your house) into lives of their
own. You’re a part of that life but not in the way when they were younger.
After your diagnosis, chances are good that your adult children feel (even if
you don’t) the roles have shifted; they may now consider taking care of you
instead of the other way round. Such ideas can make for some interesting
relational conflicts. Your best tactic is to clearly demonstrate through words,
actions, and — most of all — attitude that you do need their support and
concern but you’re still fully capable of deciding how you’ll live with PD.
If you don’t ask, they won’t help
Maybe your natural instinct as a parent is to protect your kids from worrying
about you. If you constantly respond to your children’s concern with, “We’re
doing fine,” then don’t be upset when your kids take that at face value and get
on with their lives. But here’s a news flash — they’re probably worrying
anyway and frustrated that you won’t let them help. Give them a chance to
help by stating your needs! (Check out Chapter 7 for more on this step.) The
worst result is that you’ll be disappointed by the reaction. The best result is
that your child steps up to the plate and delivers a solid hit by taking on some
chore, visiting more often, or bringing the grandkids to see you more often.
218
Part IV: Living Well with PD

When they live nearby
Adult children who live nearby can be a blessing for you and your care 
partner — especially when your PD progresses and you can use a little more
help. Establish some new family traditions, like potluck or ordered-in dinners
once a week for you, the kids, and grandkids. This ritual can
 Help your children and grandchildren adapt to the impact of your symp-
toms on your normal life
 Open the door to the more intense regular contact down the road
Because PD tends to progress slowly, you’ll probably read the signs that your
symptoms are getting worse. (For example, your meds may not work as well
and routine tasks become a struggle.) When you recognize these new limits
on your abilities, consider a family meeting (see Chapter 10).
The following suggestions can help you in that meeting:
 Offer specific ways your adult children (and older grandchildren) can
pitch in.
 Clearly demonstrate that you appreciate their busy schedules.
 Start small. For example, can your grandson cut the lawn? Can your
daughter cook up a casserole once a month for the freezer?
Ask yourself whether you would have been willing to commit to this responsi-
bility when you were your kids’ ages. Would you have cheerfully taken on
additional weekly tasks? Would you have put this ahead of everything else on
your schedule? If the answer to these questions is “No,” then perhaps your
ideas about what and how much responsibility your children can handle is
overly optimistic. Far better to start out with smaller, less time-consuming
tasks such as loading the dishwasher or taking out the garbage and then add
more responsibility as time (and your PD) progress.
The goal: Involve your adult children almost from the beginning so that, as
your needs escalate, they are already a part of the routine. Be sure you
include them in the decisions and planning. Ask for their opinion and input.
The decision is ultimately yours, but including your children in the discus-
sion permits them to feel a vital and valued part of the whole process.
If some adult children live nearby and some live farther away, don’t take the
assistance of nearby children for granted. In many families, visits from far-
away kids and grandkids are a cause for celebration, but in-town children
who provide regular hands-on help (at some personal sacrifice) also need to
feel appreciated. Call your in-town daughter specifically for the purpose of
thanking her after she’s rearranged her schedule to do something for you.
Comment on how much you appreciate something specific that each of your
children (in-town and out-of-town) does for you when you’re all together.
219
Chapter 15: Maintaining Healthy Relationships

When they’re far away
Adult children who live far away may suffer some guilt from not being avail-
able. When they visit, you may want to plan some major project (changing
the storms and screens, cleaning the basement, or painting the kitchen) so
they become a part of that hands-on care routine. You want them to realize
that they’re not your guests — they’re your children. Even though they can
only offer sporadic hands-on help, you still need them to come through for
you and your care partner.
Be sure to include these adult children in family meetings and conferences
(even if only by e-mail or phone). Ask for their input and include them as 
you come to a decision. In short, distance can shut down lines of communica-
tion even with today’s cell phones, computers, and such. Make a personal
commitment to keep all your adult children in the loop. They need to hear
your news, including major decisions or changes, from you (or your care
partner) — not from a sibling.
PD and Grandchildren
Your first step with your grandchildren is to consult with their parents before
you talk with them about your PD. How do the parents want you to handle
their children’s questions? What have the parents told your grandchildren
already, and how did they tell them? After you know those answers, show
your grandchildren through your interactions that nothing has really
changed. You are still Grandma or Grandpa. Keep your routine with them as
normal as possible.
If you’ve played games or gone apple-picking with them in the past, keep that
up. If those tasks aren’t possible for you now, find new activities. Perhaps
make a game of doing your exercises with your grandchild. Or go to the apple
farm and buy the apples, bring them home, and make applesauce with your
grandchildren. Most of all, reassure them with simple but honest answers to
their questions, and let their parents know whether you see signs that your
grandchildren are holding questions or concerns inside.
Children are wise beyond their years and extraordinarily tuned in to the
moods and vibes of the adults in their world. They may not fully understand
what’s going on, but they know when you’re upset, sad, depressed, or angry.
And more often than not, they mistakenly think they’re to blame or that your
mood has something to do with them.
We’re not suggesting you fake a happy-go-lucky attitude around the young
ones. But don’t sell them short. You’re the adult here. You know when your
frustration causes you to lash out or withdraw. Pay attention to your reac-
tions and to the reactions of the child you’re with and speak up. “Sorry I
snapped at you. Sometimes I just get so frustrated when I can’t do the things I
220
Part IV: Living Well with PD

used to do. Do you ever feel sad like that?” Now you’ve opened the door to a
dialogue with the child and perhaps to a conversation that can reveal some
of their own angst about your PD.
Children and grandchildren of all ages can be good medicine. Their curiosity
and sense of adventure can be contagious in a good way. Their belief that
they’re indestructible and immortal can be inspiring. The way that kids pack
40 hours of activity and energy into a single day can serve as an important
reminder: This is the day we get — live it or lose it!
PD and Parents and Siblings
If you have children of your own, you realize that nothing’s as terrible as dis-
covering that your child has an incurable and progressive condition.
Regardless of your age, you will always be your parent’s child.
If the parent-child relationship is such that you can confide in your parent,
allow your parent to play the role of mentor and counselor as you face this
new challenge. Seek advice for balancing the demands of PD with your other
life responsibilities. A good way to start this discussion is to remind your par-
ents of difficult challenges they’ve faced over the course of their lives.
However, if your parents are more emotionally fragile and thrown by the
news of your illness, your role may become one of reassuring them rather
than relying on them. But, because you really don’t need more emotional
responsibility at this time, consider asking a sibling to reassure Mom and
Dad. This arrangement can be especially helpful if your brothers or sisters
are looking for ways they can offer you support and tangible help.
Considering parents and siblings, remember that you have a longstanding
history with these people. If you never could please your mother or if your
brother always had to live up to your example, those facts have colored the
way your family interacts. Don’t make the mistake of expecting the founda-
tions of your relationships to magically change simply because you have PD.
Over the course of your life each of you has found ways to adapt to those
unique interactions. Perhaps you handle your Mom’s apparent disappoint-
ment in you by simply enduring her comments and moving on. Good choice.
Likewise your brother’s sense of insecurity (and inferiority) is his issue —
not yours. Be sympathetic but understand that he’s no more likely to step up
now than he has before.
If your sister or brother becomes your primary care partner, the two of you
need ground rules about the relationship just as if your care partner were
your spouse or significant other. For example:
221
Chapter 15: Maintaining Healthy Relationships

 You both need to acknowledge and then set aside the familial roles you
may have assumed throughout childhood. For example, if she always
played the big sister role and you followed her lead, that relationship
needs to change. The way you choose to handle life with PD is your deci-
sion, and she needs to be willing to follow your lead.
 You both need to face the fact that you’re adults, which means you’ve
probably gone in different directions philosophically and may have dif-
ferent approaches to a variety of issues.
Having said that, you need to focus on the reasons having your sister as your
care partner makes sense: She brings strengths to the table that you counted
on when the two of you were growing up. You’ve chosen her for those
strengths. She’s agreed because your history tells her that she can work with
you the same way the two of you faced challenges together as children.
For people diagnosed with young onset PD (see Chapter 8), the chances are
very good that your parents are still living. If your parents’ health is compro-
mised and you’re providing some care for them, you and your care partner
need to consider how best to incorporate your dual role as adult child with
PD and caregiver for aging parents into an already busy life.
PD and Close Friends
No matter what your friendships are like, there’s nothing like a chronic, pro-
gressive, and eventually debilitating condition for sorting out friends who’ll
be there from those who’ll eventually drift away. And discovering who’s who
in this process is usually surprising. The guy you thought would be there no
matter what may not handle the idea that you can’t enjoy the vigorous sports
activities the two of you have always shared. Even though you assure him
that it may be years before that happens, he doesn’t hear you. Meanwhile a
co-worker you’ve always seen as a casual acquaintance (nice to have a beer
with after work and such) steps up, intuitively understanding how to be help-
ful but not intrusive for you or your care partner.
The following suggestions help you make this transition with your friends as
smooth as possible:
 Tell it like it is: Friends may want to help but don’t know how. And, like
everyone else, they’ll take their lead from you. If you repeatedly assure
them that everything’s fine and reject their efforts to understand PD and
figure out how to help, then shame on you. And if you shut them out
with self-pity, depression, and a nobody-can-help attitude, don’t be sur-
prised when they drift away.
222
Part IV: Living Well with PD

 Treat me the same: Okay, you don’t want to lose your friends, but you
also don’t want them treating you any different. Tell them that. Be open
to their questions. Give them the facts. Seriously consider their sugges-
tions for treatments, doctors, and such before you reject them out of
hand. Let your friends know you’ll have good days and bad. And then
decide together how they can best support you.
 Lend me an ear: Friends are terrific at playing the role of confidante for
you and your care partner. And, by the way, we hope you and your care
partner have one really good friend (not the same one!) that you can
trust to hear you vent, whine, and feel sorry for yourself now and again.
 Know their strong suits: Recognize that some people are good listeners
and counselors and others need to offer hands-on help. Surely you know
these folks well enough to know the difference. So when the inevitable
question of “What can I do to help?” arises, be prepared with concrete
and specific ideas — just as you try to with your children and other
family members.
223
Chapter 15: Maintaining Healthy Relationships
It’s all in how you look at it
At the foundation of your ability to maintain
healthy relationships is your ability to maintain a
healthy sense of self. With respect to PD, you
certainly have an impressive roster of celebri-
ties to emulate (Muhammad Ali and Michael J.
Fox to name the most obvious). But, to under-
stand the importance of this sense-of-self on a
personal level, go to a PD support group meet-
ing and look around.
Joan sits over there in a corner. Diagnosed two
years ago, her symptoms are well controlled
with medication. Yet Joan is always looking for
the downside; her conversations project a dire
future. She likes to report disastrous cases, like
the person who fell, hit his head, and became
demented almost overnight. (Take this opportu-
nity to move on as quickly as possible!)
You notice Charlie in another part of the room.
He’s had PD for over a decade. His hand shakes
uncontrollably at times, he has trouble swal-
lowing, and you have to lean in close to hear
him. But you discover that he still runs his own
business, attends social functions with his wife,
and is an active volunteer in the fight to find a
cure for PD. He’s telling a story about his latest
doctor’s visit:
“Doc asked whether I had vivid dreams . . . and
whether I was in my dreams,” he says. “I told
him I was in my dreams, and I didn’t have PD —
just me moving freely with no tremor.”
You ask Charlie what the doctor said about that
and Charlie replies, “He said I must have one
whopper of a positive outlook!”
You can be Joan, you can be Charlie, or you can
be someone in between. The choice is yours.
No doubt Charlie has his bad days. But how he’s
chosen to get through those days is worth find-
ing out.

 Keep a balance: Beware of accepting too much help. Some people
(friends and family) may start strong, practically smothering you with
their help. But the odds are good that these people will over-promise and
under-deliver, eventually burning out. By the same token, the more you
permit other people to do for you — especially early on — the less you
push yourself to remain active and independent for as long as possible.
And Then There’s YOU
Having Parkinson’s is a life-changing situation — one that will continue to
affect you for the rest of your days. But are you a PD patient, or are you still
the same active, involved, in-charge person you were before you had PD? You
can choose to allow a diagnosis of PD to dominate your daily routine even in
the early stages or you can take the proactive approach — doing what it
takes to adapt PD to your lifestyle.
Consider these two questions: How many hours do you average each work-
week? Between what times do those hours occur? For most people, the
answer to the first question is between 40 and 60 hours, and the second
answer is between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. So, one way to look at adapting PD is to
focus on those daytime hours and how to use them in meaningful ways.
Although you certainly can’t schedule your PD symptoms, the basic idea of
adapting PD to fit your lifestyle has some merit. You’re still the same person
you were before you got diagnosed. Your life’s activities may need to change
over time — just as they do for everyone with or without PD. But for now,
your normal routine is probably still viable.
As a matter of fact, you may be able to get back to some activities you had
dropped when your PD symptoms went untreated. Perhaps your stiffness and
slowness can be partially relieved through physical therapy and a regular
exercise routine (see Chapter 12). Maybe those feelings of anxiety, persistent
sadness, and depression that you thought were job-related are treatable with
therapy and counseling (see Chapter 13). And maybe your hand tremor can
be managed with medication (see Chapter 9).
The point is that you and those around you had a life before you were diag-
nosed, and you still have that life. You may have to accept changes, but your
ability to participate in those activities that gave your life purpose and mean-
ing are still possible.

A
dapting to life with Parkinson’s disease (PD) works best when you can
partner with other people. We hope you’re already partnering with your
healthcare team (see Chapter 6) and your primary care partner (along with
your family and friends — see Chapter 15). The third angle of this partnering
triangle is your partnership with your employer and co-workers, a relation-
ship that permits you to stay on the job and takes into account your
employer’s need to run the business effectively. In this chapter, we offer some
ideas for delivering the news and building the workplace version of that
team-oriented partnership.
Don’t assume that our suggestions are exactly right for your situation. Every
employer-employee relationship is unique, just as your PD is different from
other people’s PD. You know the specific climate that surrounds your work-
place, and only you can decide the best approach for telling your employer
that you have PD.
Doing Your Homework
If there’s one message we pound home in this book, it’s this: Your best course
of action in all facets of managing your PD is to prepare, prepare, and then
prepare some more. That advice is never more true than when you’re about
to tell your employer that you have a chronic and progressive condition. And
those words are exactly (and probably only) what your boss is likely to hear.
Therefore your job is to prepare to fight that misperception with every
resource you can muster.

Before you tell your employer, you have homework — and yes, we do mean
you! In broad strokes (with details to follow), here are your assignments:
 Put together an honest assessment of your position requirements and
whether or not you can continue to fulfill them.
 Discuss your job responsibilities with your neurologist and get a medical
evaluation of your ability to perform those duties.
 Research what the company can offer to accommodate your changing
needs and has offered other employees in the past (such as a different
workstation configuration or a flexible schedule so you can work when
your symptoms are well managed or work from home).
 Familiarize yourself with options that may be available through the
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) or other government programs.
Honestly assess your ability 
to continue in the job
Before you start spreading the news that you have PD to your boss and co-
workers, decide how and if you’ll be able to continue working. To do this, you
first need a clear understanding of your job requirements and performance
demands. You and your neurologist both need this information so you can
honestly assess your ability to continue in the job as your PD progresses. For
example, if your job requires fine hand-work and you already have a signifi-
cant tremor in one hand, you can’t ignore this problem.
Keep in mind that PD progresses at different rates for different people and
neither you nor your doctor can really predict its course. However, two ways
to acquire the information you and your doctor need in order to make the
best possible assessment are:
 Reviewing the written job description from when you were hired
 Taking advantage of recent or upcoming performance review sessions
where your employer restates the expectations and requirements of the
position
If you didn’t receive a printed job description or your next performance
review isn’t in the near future, then consider asking for an informal conversa-
tion with your supervisor — especially if she’s not the same person who
hired you. Her expectations for your performance may not be the same as
your former supervisor’s were. Keep the meeting informal and conversa-
tional. If you say something like, “I wonder whether you’d give me a written,
detailed description of my position,” you’re going to raise all sorts of red
flags (especially if you’ve been working there for some time already).
226
Part IV: Living Well with PD

If you have no job description and can’t have a chat with your immediate
supervisor, take time to think through the tasks required of you — physical,
mental, and emotional (stress-related). Be as specific as possible.
This is the time — before you sit down with your supervisor to deliver the
news that you have PD — to be brutally honest. For now, no one else is
asking these questions or listening to your answers. But if you try and fudge
the answers when you know your PD’s already making some tasks difficult,
you’re only harming yourself.
Ask yourself the following questions:
 Do you have a desk job, a manufacturing job, or something more physical?
 How many hours a week are you scheduled?
 How much overtime or work at home do you typically have in a week?
 What are the physical demands of the job (Standing most of the time?
Sitting at a computer? Moving around — perhaps teaching small 
children — much of the workday? Traveling? Needing fine motor control?)
 What are the mental demands of the job? (Quick decisions? Complex
problem-solving? Coordinating the efforts of several other people?)
 What are the stressors of the job? (Bottom line expectations of
employer? Deadlines? Balancing several projects at the same time?)
 What are the emotional challenges of the job? (Supervisor is in over his
head, making your job harder? Working in healthcare with patients who
are ill or infirm? Balancing the demands of your job with your role as a
spouse or parent and your PD symptoms?)
 And finally, do you see your schedule getting less intense? More intense?
At your next appointment with your neurologist, discuss your job require-
ments and how to adapt your PD symptoms — those you’re experiencing
now and those that are most likely to occur over the next year or so — to the
demands of the job (and vice versa). Take notes. If you think your employer
may have safety concerns but your doctor indicates that you can continue
the job, ask your doctor for a letter stating that you’re capable of performing
the tasks in question.
Consider options that may be available
Depending on the size of your company, you may have an entire list of
options to help you stay on the job and perform effectively — or you may
have no options at all. If you work for a larger company, your employer may
be able to offer flexible hours, job-sharing, working from home one or two
days a week, or a reduced workload (which, of course, may have a reduction
in pay).
227
Chapter 16: PD in the Workplace

But even the small business owner may still have some options. For example,
if you work in a restaurant that’s busiest at breakfast and lunch, your
employer has little leeway for adapting your hours. But is it possible for you
to work a later shift when the restaurant has fewer customers to serve?
Think outside the box. Your employer’s not the only one responsible for
devising options for you. The employee who needs to be on the job by seven
but struggles with getting up, dressed and out the door in time to meet that
start time may need to get up an hour earlier and talk to his doctor about
adjusting the timing on his medication routine to accommodate his early
morning start time.
If you work for a larger company, you probably received an employee hand-
book as a part of your new hire information. As part of preparing to tell your
boss about your diagnosis, dig this employee handbook out and read it.
Better yet, go to the company’s internal Web site and get the latest version. If
your company (or the company your care partner works for) provides group
insurance for employees, read those policies. Make notes so that in the meet-
ing with your boss (and eventually the person from Human Resources, HR)
you have a firm understanding of the company’s policies regarding special
accommodations or coverage for short- or long-term disability.
Deciding When to Disclose Your Diagnosis
Although PD is progressive, it isn’t one of those you’ve-got-six-months-to-live
situations. You have some time to tell your employer about your PD. On the
other hand, you also want to choose the best time for your specific situation.
We help you make that all-important decision in this section.
From your perspective
Only you can decide the appropriate time to tell your employer. The goal is to
minimize the fallout from sharing this kind of news.
Consider the effects of these two scenarios:
 You rush in to your boss’s office within days of the diagnosis and
announce that you have PD.
 You withhold the news until your symptoms become more difficult to
control and begin to affect your performance.
In the first case, the danger lies in your employer (and co-workers) viewing you
and your performance differently. In other words, well before your PD symp-
toms have any effect on your ability, other people may perceive a problem and
228
Part IV: Living Well with PD

attribute it to your PD. Inadvertently you may be labeled and pigeon-holed
(possibly passed over for a better position) because of other people’s 
misperceptions.
In the second scenario, you may think you’re controlling your symptoms, but
your news comes as no surprise to your employer or co-workers. If your boss
has been aware of a change in your performance for some time, she may
wonder why you took so long to come forward. Worse, if facial mask (lack of
facial expression) is one of your symptoms, she may have interpreted that
symptom as disinterest or apathy and then attributed the decline in your per-
formance to that misinterpretation.
If your supervisor has expressed concern about your recent job performance
(via questions like “Is everything all right?” or “How’s everything going at
home?” or even at a more formal review of your performance), that’s a good
hint that he’s concerned about you and the work he needs from you.
Depending on your job, it may be years before your PD has any real impact.
In the meantime, make use of the initial days and weeks following your diag-
nosis to accept that you have PD and that it’s going to be a factor in every
facet of your life, including your work. (See Chapter 5 for more specific ideas
on getting through those first weeks after diagnosis.)
If you know that safety will eventually become an issue, stay ahead of the
curve by considering other positions within the company that you can
handle as your PD progresses. If training for such positions is available, take
it to maximize your options. Prepare and plan ahead.
From your employer’s perspective
Keep in mind that bosses can’t look at a situation in isolation. Employers
must consider how your situation affects other people and, yes, ultimately,
the bottom line. This fact of life may seem harsh, but the point of opening a
business is to make enough money to reinvest in the company’s future and
keep the business going. Most employers want very much to maintain good
employees. If you’re a person who delivers on the job and adds value to the
company, your employer will probably be eager to help you stay on the job
for as long as possible.
If safety is relevant to your position, your employer can’t put the company,
you, or your co-workers at risk. And in this case, the bottom line isn’t about
making a profit; it’s about security for you, your co-workers, and your families.
The first person to tell at work is your immediate supervisor (and then the
folks in your HR department). In rare circumstances, employers can be short-
sighted when it comes to supporting employees in tough personal situations.
Maybe you and your supervisor already have an adversarial relationship, so
you’re concerned your PD will tip the situation over the edge.
229
Chapter 16: PD in the Workplace

In such cases you may be tempted to go around your superior and seek out
someone in the company that seems more supportive. But this plan only
makes the problem worse and can actually backfire on you. Your supervisor
may resent being passed over and make it more difficult for you to convince
other people that you’re still a valuable asset to the company.
Telling Your Boss
Okay, the moment’s at hand. It’s time to deliver the news of your PD to your
employer. Here are some steps to consider:
1. Request a meeting.
This can be informal if you and your supervisor have a relationship that
permits you to say, “Do you have 20 to 30 minutes today or tomorrow? I
need to talk to you about something.” If the request needs to be more
formal, follow the company process for requesting and scheduling a
meeting with your supervisor or manager. Allow at least 30 minutes for
the meeting.
2. Prepare and practice your talking points — those key points you want
your boss to hear after you’ve said, “I have Parkinson’s.”
Keep the points short and simple. This is no time to try to educate your
boss about the intricacies of PD. Ideally, you’ll take a positive and proac-
tive approach. For example, you may say, “I’ve been diagnosed with
Parkinson’s disease.” (Allow time for a short response — hopefully a
sympathetic one.) You continue, “The good news is that progression is
slow and my doctor agrees that it may be some time — even years —
before symptoms really have an impact.”
3. Demonstrate that you’ve done your homework.
Your boss may hear very little after you say, “I have Parkinson’s.” And
inevitably he’ll start thinking of its short- and long-term impact on the
business. This may be a good time to offer him a simple fact sheet about
what PD is (and is not).
This is also a good time to produce a copy of any letter your neurologist
has provided that states your ability to continue in the job.
Follow up with a few simple comments that demonstrate the effort
you’ve already given the situation: You’ve reviewed the job description
and performance expectations set out for your position; you’ve met with
your doctor and gone over the demands of the job; and your doctor has
given you the letter. This is where all your homework and advance
preparation pay off, but keep it short and simple. You don’t want to inad-
vertently raise red flags by saying something like, “And as for the travel
230
Part IV: Living Well with PD

piece of my job, well, I’m pretty sure that won’t be a problem as long as
the travel doesn’t increase.”
Note: You don’t want to come off as threatening or adversarial at a time
like this; you don’t want the message to be, “I have PD, and I know my
rights.” Instead, say something like, “I know this raises all sorts of ques-
tions, but I’m confident that together we can find answers and solutions
that will allow me to continue to contribute effectively.”
4. Maintain a positive and can-do attitude throughout the meeting
regardless of the response you get from your manager.
Understand that your manager is going to need some time to take this all
in, so don’t agree to any firm offer or accommodation your supervisor
may offer off the top of his head at this initial meeting. Acknowledge any
such offer as a possibility but one that you should both discuss after
he’s had time to digest the news — the same way you needed some time
to digest your diagnosis.
You know that having PD is a challenge but not a deal-breaker when it
comes to your ability to contribute. Your job in this meeting is to
demonstrate through your can-do attitude that this is just one more
challenge you can conquer.
5. Address the subject of co-workers at some point in the meeting.
One suggestion is to meet with the members of your immediate depart-
ment and give them the news. Show your manager a brief fact sheet that
answers frequently asked questions about PD. (One excellent handout is
available online at www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/parkinsons_
disease.) Tell your employer that, with permission, you want to tell
these co-workers about your diagnosis, give them the fact sheet, and ask
them to help squelch rumors or misinformation as the news spreads.
6. Let your manager know that you’ll be contacting the HR department
to gather information about your benefits and options.
7. Thank your manager for his support and concern and ask whether the
two of you should set a time to meet again or you should wait to hear
from HR. Then get back to work.
Getting the Facts from HR
Your HR department can provide answers to most questions related to your
insurance options and work options if you’re no longer able to do your job.
But just as you prepared for your meeting with your manager, prepare a list
of questions for this meeting, and be ready to write down the answers (or get
printed materials that provide the information).

Part IV: Living Well with PD
The Americans with Disabilities Act — 
your golden parachute — maybe
According to the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC), the Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA) gives civil rights protec-
tions (similar to those for race, color, sex,
national origin, age, and religion) to individuals
with disabilities. The ADA prohibits discrimina-
tion in all employment practices: job application
procedures, hiring and firing regulations, promo-
tion opportunities, benefits, and compensation.
The broad protection given by the ADA sounds
very promising. But keep in mind the fine points
as well — points that can affect your rights
under the law. Examples are:
 If your workplace employs fewer than 15
people, you may not be covered under this
legislation.
 As a person with PD, your disability must
“substantially limit major life activities such
as seeing, hearing, speaking, walking,
breathing, performing manual tasks, learn-
ing, caring for oneself, and working.”
 You must be qualified to fill the requirements
of the job, and your employer maintains the
right to establish performance and produc-
tion standards that all employees must
meet, disabled or not.
The ADA further requires your employer to con-
sider whether you can continue to do your job
with certain “reasonable accommodation.”
Examples of this requirement include special
products (such as voice-activated computers),
changes that make your existing workspace
more accessible, or restructuring the job itself.
Because every disability and its effect on an
employee’s ability to do a specific job is slightly
different, keep the following suggestions in
mind:
 Your employer will rely on you to speak up
and suggest possible solutions. If you don’t
have a suggestion, do some research and
work with your employer to find one.
 Understand that the company is expected
to pay for any equipment or necessary
accommodation, but your employer isn’t
required to provide an accommodation that
causes an undue hardship on other employ-
ees or the business. If cost is a factor (and
you can afford it), you may consider offer-
ing to pay part of the cost.
 The ADA doesn’t give you a free ride. Your
employer can hold you to the same stan-
dards of performance and production as
people without disabilities. You have a
responsibility to be honest with yourself and
your employer about your ability to meet
those standards.
We strongly urge you to
 Become familiar with the pros and cons of
the ADA for your situation.
 Not assume an adversarial or threaten-
ing attitude with your employer when it
comes to applying ADA regulations to your
situation.
Managing your PD is a team effort between you
and your health team, you and your care-part-
nering family and friends, and you and your
employer.
For more information about ADA, call 800-514-
0301 (voice within USA), 800-514-0383 (TTY),
202-514-0301 (outside USA) or check out www.
ada.gov.

When you meet with your HR representative, you’re actually on a fact-finding
mission. You’re not necessarily going to act on any of the following factors
right away, but you need to clearly understand your employer’s policy
related to:
 Disability
 Early retirement
 Availability of any pension/401K funds
 Government programs, such as COBRA
 Health savings accounts (HSAS)
 Social Security disability benefits
 Medicare and Medicaid
 Any available state health insurance pools
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) can be a real resource of options
as your PD progresses. But be aware that the ADA doesn’t apply to all
employers, and it does have limitations. (See the sidebar, “The Americans
with Disabilities Act — your golden parachute — maybe.”)
Positioning the News for Co-Workers
The type of job you have and the people you work closely with will influence
what and how much you tell your co-workers. Here are two possible scenarios:
 You are in a management or supervisory position and have several
people who report directly to you. After you’ve told your boss (and
gotten his agreement that you need to break the news to your team), call
a meeting of your group. Keep it informal. (In some business settings,
this meeting is called a huddle, like a football team huddling to get the
play before going into action. The huddle’s a great analogy for the kind
of atmosphere you want to create for delivering this news.) Consider
taking these steps:
• Deliver the news. Do it with humor, if possible, but keep it direct
and simple.
• Hand out the simple fact sheet about PD (see the earlier section,
“Telling Your Boss”).
• Lay out the ground rules for what aspects may change, but empha-
size that it will be business as usual — you’re still a team.
233
Chapter 16: PD in the Workplace

• Offer some guidelines for how you expect your team to handle any
gossip or rumors they may hear about you or PD. (Remind them
that they can squelch any such nonsense using the simple facts
you’ve provided.)
• Let your co-workers know that they can come directly to you with
any concerns or questions, assure them that you are most defi-
nitely still you, and send them back to work.
 You’re part of a close-knit group whose ability to succeed relies on
everyone pulling her weight. Your teammates react to the news with one
of two attitudes: “Poor Mary. How will she manage? What can I do to
help her?” or “Poor me” (as in “This is going to end up meaning more
work for me.”). Be prepared for either reaction by:
• Maintaining that same upbeat, can-do attitude you demonstrated
when you told your boss
• Offering the fact sheet and stating outright that, according to your
doctor, you’re going to be around for years to come
• Assuring everyone that you’re not expecting special considera-
tions from them and you’ll continue to pull your weight on the
team
The manner in which you deliver the news of your PD to your manager and
co-workers forms their attitude as they carry that news forward. If you’re
positive and upbeat, they’re more likely to assure others that you have a 
real handle on it. And that image is exactly the one you want to project to
everyone.
Taking Steps to Protect Your Income
Working people have a variety of ways to protect themselves and their
dependents if they can no longer work. The following list describes the more
common methods.
Although this list provides general definitions of a variety of options, we
aren’t recommending any one of these programs. If you need to leave your
job and rely on other sources for your income, consult with a qualified finan-
cial planner or counselor (see Chapter 21).
 Income-generating plans:
• Employer Disability Plans: Such plans can be short- or long-term,
and eligibility requirements differ from one employer to another. 
In general these plans allow employees to purchase short- and
234
Part IV: Living Well with PD

long-term disability insurance as a part of their overall company-
sponsored benefit package. If you need to leave work because of a
disability, the plan pays you a percentage of your salary while
you’re disabled. Some plans pay that full percentage even if you’re
also eligible for and receiving benefits from Social Security (see the
next bullet); other plans may prorate their payments based on
what you receive from the government. (For specific information of
disability benefits, talk to your HR department.)
• Social Security Disability Plans: This segment of Social Security is
different from the more common retirement benefit payout. Two
programs are available: Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI)
and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). Both programs have strin-
gent eligibility requirements.
SSDI is for people with an established work history; the amount
received is determined by that history and specific earnings.
SSI is based on financial need and serves people with little work
history and very limited financial assets. (For more information on
becoming eligible for either program, call 800-772-1213 or go to
www.ssa.gov.)
 Insurance coverage options:
• The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA):
This option permits employees who lose their employer-sponsored
benefits to pay out-of-pocket for the same health insurance cover-
age they received while working. The normal period you can pay
for coverage is 18 months after you leave unless you’re determined
to be disabled, in which case you can extend coverage to a total of
36 months. (For more information, talk to your HR department.)
• Long-Term Care (LTC) insurance: LTC insurance plans provide
coverage for care necessary to help a person with the basic activi-
ties of daily living, such as bathing and dressing. Benefits are usu-
ally available for a range of settings — the home, an assisted-living
facility, or a nursing home.
A growing trend among employers is to offer an LTC insurance
option as a part of the employee benefit package. If your company
provides this option and you haven’t taken advantage of it, check
into it again. If you aren’t eligible, your care partner may be. (For
more information on LTC insurance, talk to your HR department or
call your state Office on Insurance.)
• Medicare: People under the age of 65 can qualify for Medicare (the
federal health insurance and drug coverage plan). For current
information on qualifying if you aren’t yet 65, call 800-633-4227 or
go to www.cms.hhs.gov. (For a more complete explanation of the
Medicare program, see Chapter 21.)
235
Chapter 16: PD in the Workplace

• SHIP Programs and Medicaid: Every state has some form of a
State Health Insurance Counseling and Assistance Program (SHIP)
to help its citizens find the best insurance options regardless of the
person’s financial or health situation. In addition, every state offers
Medicaid, the federally funded and state-managed program that
provides health services based on financial need. (For more infor-
mation on Medicaid in your state, go to www.hcfa.hhs.gov/
medicaid.)

n the early months after the onset of your Parkinson’s disease (PD) symp-
toms, you may be surprised how little accommodation your symptoms
require. In fact, if your doctor’s recommended regular exercise and a bal-
anced diet and you’ve followed her advice, you may be feeling better than
you have in some time. Your symptoms may actually be more of an annoy-
ance than any real concern. Now that you think about it, you may have
avoided going to see the doctor for that reason — the symptoms weren’t
really interfering with your routine.
As time goes by, however, your symptoms will become troublesome enough
to affect your life and routine — perhaps significantly. But this doesn’t mean
you can’t live a full and active life. In this chapter, we offer tips for managing
your symptoms — even as they worsen — without letting PD be the driving
force in your life.
You’re the same person you were before the diagnosis. You hold the same
importance to your family and friends and retain many of the talents and
skills you developed through your life. You may need to adapt — doing activi-
ties a different way, at a slower pace, or even with the help of others — but
nothing about your essential identity has changed.

Exploring Ways to Make 
Daily Activities Easier
You can take a number of positive and proactive steps to keep your daily rou-
tine from overwhelming you. In this section, we look at some key ways that
you can stay in control — as long as you’re willing to adapt and not dig in
your heels with a my-way-or-the-highway attitude!
Do not allow other people’s expectations or your own internal demands to
direct your activity. The added stress of trying to compete or live up to last
year’s successes (big and little) can have an adverse effect on your overall
health. Stress and performance anxiety can actually inflame your symptoms
and incapacitate you even more — at least momentarily.
Timing your activities
The main difference in your life now is timing — it can be everything. Your
ability to understand when you can and can’t do something may be the key
to continuing many (or most) activities you’ve always enjoyed. We’re not talk-
ing about timing your meds (which you and your doctor need to work out
together) or your activities for your on times (see Chapter 9). We’re talking
about accepting and understanding that everything is a matter of time. You
take longer to get ready to go places and longer to get from here to there. You
take longer to do a task (like dressing or brushing your teeth) that you used
to knock off in a matter of minutes.
Even if you take four or five times longer, you’re still independent. It’s impor-
tant that you continue to perform these basic activities with little (if any)
help for as long as possible.
Those around you — family, friends, employer, co-workers — also need to
understand this need for extra time. Working out an appropriate time sched-
ule for tasks you perform personally or on the job is important. Be realistic. If
you used to take 15 minutes to do something, you may now need an hour.
Reserving your energy
Accept that your energy is limited and must be conserved and used wisely.
This attitude can help protect your right to live independently and fully for as
long as possible. Some days you’ll just be downright pooped, unable to com-
plete the list of activities you’d planned. So what? Are you saying you never fell
short of completing an ambitious list before the onset of your PD symptoms?
238
Part IV: Living Well with PD

Yeah, right. Everyone overestimates the potential for accomplishment from
time to time. You’re just wise enough to say, “Okay, I’ll tackle that 
tomorrow — or the next day.”
Approach each day with an I-don’t-have-to-do-everything-but will-do-as-much-
as-I (and my PD)-can attitude. These are a few more tips to help you manage
your energy bank:
 Take the time to think through the demands on your schedule each day;
prioritize the list by what you need to tackle and what you can put aside
for later.
 Schedule important tasks for when you’re at peak-performance.
 Discuss with your doctor the advantages of regular exercise and diet
changes for improving your levels of energy; implement his suggestions.
Taking tips from other PWP
Your ability to manage basic tasks may vary greatly from hour to hour and
depend on where you are in your medication dosing cycle. But the ingenuity
of 1.2 million people with PD (PWP) in the United States and a history of
nearly two hundred years can provide you with more than a few tricks to
make your life with PD easier. The following sections share ways other people
with Parkinson’s (PWP) maintain independence in spite of their symptoms.
Your occupational therapist (OT) can offer ideas and explain proven 
techniques for adapting your routine to accommodate your symptoms.
Appendix B also recommends a number of resources and devices available 
to make life easier.
Strategizing
Your determination to be as independent as possible — no matter how long a
basic task takes — begins with curiosity and imagination. Take advantage of
these general tips to make each day run a little more smoothly:
 Try to approach each situation as a separate challenge and break each
task into individual steps. Focus on one step at a time. Try to start with
the simplest one; after you’ve conquered that, move on.
 Keep in mind that timing is everything — coordinate the timing of these
tasks with your medication routine to avoid off symptoms (see Chap-
ter 9) that can make each step even more frustrating.
 Let your partner know that the difficulties you face are as frustrating 
for you as they are for her, but it’s important that you continue to try.
Discuss ways she can help without taking away your opportunity to do
239
Chapter 17: Adjusting Your Routine as Your PD Progresses

as much as you can. For example, your partner can put toothpaste on
your toothbrush and leave it out for you. Or while you shower or bathe,
your care partner can remain nearby in case you need help; she can also
lay out your clothing for the day.
Grooming
Personal grooming is probably so much a part of your day that you barely
think about all the individual tasks. Brushing your teeth, washing your face,
shaving (if you’re a man), applying makeup (if you’re a woman), and combing
your hair are routines you’ve performed for decades.
But now your symptoms are making these simple tasks next to impossible
and even exhausting. Are you at the point where you need to ask for help?
Not necessarily. Give these proven techniques a try:
 Sit down instead of standing — you’ll not only conserve energy but also
lower the risk of losing your balance and falling.
 Prop your elbows on the counter to steady your hand and support your
shoulders as you shave or apply makeup.
 Use electronic appliances — razor, toothbrush, and so forth — that do a
lot of the work for you.
 Try a hairstyle that’s easier to manage and dries quickly without a hair
dryer. In a pinch, try one of the dry-shampoo products available at drug-
stores or beauty supply shops.
 Treat yourself to a weekly (or bi-weekly) shampoo and styling at a dis-
count hair salon or local beauty school. (This tip is also great therapy
for relieving stress!)
 Suggest a certificate for a professional manicure or pedicure when
people ask for birthday or holiday gift ideas. Or check with a local
beauty school for a less-expensive session with a student.
Other people respond more positively to the person who takes an interest in
the way she looks. And looking your best empowers and keeps you in control
of your own destiny. So make the effort — put your best face and foot for-
ward every day.
Dressing
Before your PD symptoms started getting in the way, you probably never
thought about the many balance and flex movements that are necessary just
to put clothes on.
Before you begin breaking down this task into manageable steps, take the
time to go through your closet and assess your wardrobe. Are the clothes
easy to put on and take off? Consider these suggestions:
240
Part IV: Living Well with PD

 Look for pieces with closures that are easy to manage. Try an elastic
waist in place of a button and zipper, for example.
 Consider replacing the buttons on a favorite shirt or blouse with mag-
netic snaps or Velcro closures.
 Consider having the buttons sewn closed when clothes are loose or
stretchy enough to pull on over your head.
 Use elastic shoelaces (or shoes with Velcro closings) to avoid tying your
shoes.
Avoid clothing items that only make life more difficult for you, no matter how
much you love them. For example,
 Stay away from fabrics that tend to cling or stick to other fabrics 
(flannel, velour, corduroy, and such).
 Avoid sweatpants that have elastic at the ankles.
 Get rid of bedroom slippers (use non-skid socks like hospitals have), and
avoid heavy-weight shoes (wingtips, for example).
 Women: Abandon pantyhose in favor of knee-highs or socks, and forget
the high heels.
Think through the steps of dressing — from choosing what to wear to putting
on each item — and allow plenty of time. These tips make the tasks easier:
 Prepare the night before: Choose your clothing and lay out all the pieces
(from underwear to accessories).
 Sit on a sturdy armchair (not a rocker or the edge of the bed) and use
the arms for support as you dress.
 Have a small footstool close at hand to provide support when you put
on socks and shoes.
 Lie down on the bed if that makes it easier for you to put on certain
items such as pants or socks.
Try to look your best — it can make a difference. When you look good, you
feel good — or at least better. Some days you may think, “What’s the point of
getting dressed? I’m not going anywhere and no one’s going to see me.” Yes,
you are going places — even if it’s just around the house. And your family
(and any friends who happen to stop by) are hardly nobodies.
Bathing and showering
Bathtubs and showers can be falls waiting to happen, so your first step is to
make them as safe as possible. Your OT can help assess the need for safety
bars, tub mats, shower chairs or stools, non-skid rugs, and such. (Read more
about OTs in Chapter 6.)
241
Chapter 17: Adjusting Your Routine as Your PD Progresses

The next step is to determine whether your normal bathing routine still
applies. For example, when you consider the extra effort a shower or bath
takes with PD, is your former daily routine realistic or even necessary? Note:
One symptom in the mid-to-later stages of PD is excessive perspiration. If this
is the case, at least a daily sponge bath is indeed necessary.
Because of the danger of falling, never attempt a shower or bath when you’re
home alone. Although you may want the privacy of managing this routine on
your own, your care partner or someone in the family should be close
enough that you can call for assistance if you need it. (Besides, what’s so bad
about having someone else wash your back?)
Whatever schedule you and your care partner decide is best, these additional
tips can make bath time less stressful:
 Cut down on trips that can drain precious energy by gathering every-
thing you need (soap, towels, shampoo, robe, and such) in one place —
perhaps a plastic container in the bathroom can keep it all together.
 Check that the bathroom is free of drafts and that the water temperature
is comfortable. Your bath time should be a pleasant, relaxing time, not a
time when water that’s too hot or too cold surprises you and can lead to
a dangerous loss of balance or a fall.
 Undress and, using the techniques you practiced with your OT, get into
the tub or shower. If your neurologist hasn’t prescribed occupational
therapy and you’re beginning to struggle with such movements as get-
ting in and out of the tub, ask for an OT referral. The OT can come to
your home to work with you. In the meantime, be safe. Let your partner
assist you in and out of the tub or shower, or plan to take sponge baths.
 Take your time — the sensation of washing yourself should be a pleasur-
able one. If holding onto a bar of soap is difficult, consider using a bath
mitt, which is a glove-like washcloth that’s available at most drugstores.
And speaking of soap, go easy on the bath oils. They can make the
shower or tub floor slippery (even with a rubber safety mat). Better to
rub on bath oil as part of the drying process after your bath.
 Dry yourself thoroughly when you’ve finished. Again, take your time.
Apply any lotion or cream to dry or chafed skin, and put on your robe. In
fact, a thick terrycloth robe is a super way to dry yourself when the flexi-
bility needed to towel dry becomes more difficult.
Don’t attempt to get even partially dressed in the bathroom; the danger for
falling as you attempt to dress in such close quarters is huge. Put on your
robe and go back to your bedroom to dress, following the guidelines in
“Dressing,” earlier in this section.
242
Part IV: Living Well with PD

Personal hygiene
One symptom PWP can develop as their PD progresses is urinary inconti-
nence (see Chapter 18 for a discussion on the impact incontinence may have
on your PD). This problem is not only a health concern but also a real
hygiene issue due to the potential for odor. Of course, your first step is to dis-
cuss these problems with your doctor. Also consider these tips:
 Try using one of the disposable products (such as sanitary pads avail-
able in varying degrees of thickness) on the market today. Many of these
are far more discreet than wearing an adult diaper product.
 Make certain that the pathway to and from the bathroom is well-lighted
and free of obstacles. Or ask your doctor to prescribe a portable com-
mode that you can place near your bed to avoid trips to the bathroom at
night.
243
Chapter 17: Adjusting Your Routine as Your PD Progresses
Thinking outside the box
You may have heard the old joke about the
patient who says to the doctor, “Doctor, if I
follow your treatment, will I be able to play the
piano?” When the doctor says, “I don’t see why
not,” the patient replies, “Great. I always
wanted to be able to do that.”
Dr. Gary Guten — yes, the guy whose name is
on the front cover — had battled PD over a
decade when it occurred to him that playing 
the piano may be a way to maintain flexibility
and coordination in his fingers and hands. Over
the years, Gary — an orthopedic surgeon,
marathon runner, and expert in the field of
sports medicine — has found several innova-
tive ways to meet the various challenges of his
PD. Taking up the piano is just one more ther-
apy he’s devised to deal with the advancement
of symptoms.
In the process, Gary and his teacher developed
various techniques — like placing 2-pound
weights on Gary’s wrists to help steady his
hands and creating a system for remembering
notes and reading music. After several weeks
of lessons and practice, Gary joined 20 other
students (average age of 13) to present his first
recital. As Gary said, “At my age and at this
stage of my PD, what else could I do to earn the
applause of 75 people?”
Early in his PD, Gary discovered that ski-
pole-like hiking sticks (available at www.
exerstrider.com) help him maintain an
even stride and balance, allowing him to walk
with rhythm and relative confidence. He also
discovered that lateral twisting movements
(from side to side) are easier than straight-on
movements. As a result, he plays golf and ping-
pong (which use a lot of lateral movement) to
remain active — and athletic.
You may not be an athlete or a musician, but
Gary’s advice is to remember the words of the
famous writer Gilbert Keith Chesterton: “If a
thing is worth doing, it is worth doing badly.”
Like Gary, you and your healthcare team can get
creative about what works for you in the fight to
maintain your balance, mental alertness, and
independence. By keeping a there-must-be-a-
way attitude while you hold onto your optimism
and good humor, you may have won half the
battle against advancing PD.

 Keep moist towelettes, disposable pads, and other products within easy
reach in your bathroom so you can clean yourself as needed.
 Keep a few pre-moistened disposable wipes and an extra set of clean
underwear and clothing in a plastic bag in your car, in a bag, or in a
backpack for whenever you go out, just in case.
Maintaining the Family Dynamic
Collaborative management is a relatively new term in managing the symptoms
of a chronic condition such as PD. In medical circles it applies primarily to
the healthcare team (see Chapter 6) that helps you plan for and manage your
PD symptoms. But it’s also a useful term for families that need to include a
chronic and progressive condition into their daily routines. The elements of
collaborative management within a family unit may include:
 Defining the issues to be managed (medical, mental, and physical
health) as well as the emotional impact of PD on the PWP and the family.
For example, if the PWP’s been the family’s chief financial manager, this
is a good time to train another family member in the details of managing
the finances, paying the bills, investing and saving, and so on.
 Targeting each issue by establishing realistic goals, achievable objec-
tives, and a satisfactory plan of action for the PWP and the family. Goals
can be simple and short-term such as planning a family trip. If the PWP
has always handled the planning, preparations, and details, then other
members of the family need to step up and define ways they can take on
some of those tasks.
 Supporting and encouraging the PWP’s autonomy and independence
through medical interventions, lifestyle changes, and emotional support
systems so the PWP and her family can maintain as normal a routine as
possible. Often a family member will respond to the PD diagnosis by
jumping in and trying to do everything for the PWP. Because that person
wants to deal with this challenge through action, find ways she can con-
tribute. For example, maybe she can prepare a salad or side dish for
dinner while the PWP — an accomplished cook — makes the rest of the
meal just as she did before PD.
 Monitoring (through ongoing and open communication) the status of
the PWP’s role within the family unit and the family’s ability to adapt to
the presence of PD. Regular weekly or bi-weekly family meetings (see
discussion of initial family meeting in Chapter 7) can accomplish this
goal and provide a safe haven for members to voice concerns. The
agenda starts with an update from the PWP. Then other family members
engage in a round of concerns and joys in which each person can talk
about possible needs or red flags and then mention something that is
working well or has brought special delight since the last meeting.
244
Part IV: Living Well with PD

As much as the challenge of living with PD may appear to be all about you, in
fact it affects every family member. Whenever you have these family gather-
ings, make sure that you listen to your family’s honest concerns (and some-
times outright frustrations). Acknowledge the concern, focus on the specific
issue rather than the emotional overtones, and, opening the discussion to
everyone, seek the best solution together.
Socializing with Friends
Every circle of friends has the person or persons who drive the social calen-
dars of getting together, going places, calling, e-mailing, and the like. Each
circle also has people who wait to be called, e-mailed, and the rest. Before
your diagnosis, which role did you play? Were you the extrovert or the intro-
vert? The social butterfly or the hermit?
If you’re an introvert by nature, maybe the friends you counted on to call and
set up get-togethers seem to have turned into a bunch of loners. If you were
the social cheerleader of the group, maybe you’ve dropped that ball now that
you have PD — not wanting to impose yourself and your symptoms on your
friends.
Get over it! If your friends are real, they’re waiting for you to show them the
way. If the usual extroverts seem to be hanging back, call them and clear the
air. Chances are they’ve been hanging back while trying to figure out what
you want. If you were the social leader, get back in the game. Call the old gang
together and have an open discussion about your PD, how you’re handling it,
and most of all, how you hope they’ll handle it. Then get back to doing what-
ever you did together before your diagnosis.
Whatever activity you decide on, do not make your PD the focus of (or reason
for) getting together. The purpose here is to bring the relationships back to
some semblance of normalcy. After your friends see you in action and enjoy-
ing the activities you’ve always enjoyed (maybe with a bit more effort and a
little less speed), they’ll relax and the friendship can move forward.
Going Out and About in the Community
You may as well get used to it. You’ll have times when total strangers stare at
you with pity (or worse, disgust), children point and snicker, and people even
cross to the other side of the street to avoid passing you on the sidewalk.
Some people will misread your balance symptoms as intoxication. Others may
read your facial mask and lack of expression as a sign of mental illness or not
being very bright. (This is fairly obvious because the person speaks ver-r-ry
slowly and loudly as if instructing a small child or a non-English speaker.)
245
Chapter 17: Adjusting Your Routine as Your PD Progresses

You can choose to take this ignorance and lack of good manners personally,
or you can choose to understand that this stranger is the one with the 
problem — and then get on with your day. In either case, what do you care
about the opinions of strangers? Are you going to permit people like that to
stop you from living normally? Aha! We didn’t think so. The following sections
provide some tips for maintaining your activity in the larger community.
Attending public events
Try to schedule your medication timing and dosing to your greatest advan-
tage during the planned outing. (Talk to your doctor about your plans and let
him suggest any modifications to your normal dosing routine). If you’re going
to a play, movie, concert, ballgame, or restaurant, some simple steps may
help:
 Call ahead to get answers about accessibility (ramps not stairs, seat on
the aisle if preferred, room for a wheelchair if necessary, and so on).
 Get plenty of rest before the event.
 Allow plenty of time to get ready.
 Arrive early so you can be seated and settled without rushing.
Social outings should be as enjoyable for your care partner as they are for
you. This is not the time for you to try and prove your independence. For
example, if helping you get ready (such as putting on your shoes for you)
allows more time for your care partner to get ready, accept the help — 
appreciate the help. If using a wheelchair makes life easier and the occasion
less stressful for your care partner, use a wheelchair. Think of this accep-
tance not as a surrender of your autonomy but as a gracious way of caring for
your care partner.
Traveling
Taking a trip requires careful planning to make the trip a pleasurable experi-
ence rather than a hassle. As with everything else, when you consider taking
a trip, break it down into more manageable steps:
 Choose where you’ll go. At this point in your PD journey, what’s realistic
(a theater tour of NYC?) and what’s not (scaling Mt. Everest?)? Talk to 
a travel agent about special tours available for folks traveling with a 
disability.
The Web site www.travelconsumer.com/disability.htm provides
links to special topics (such as recreational vehicles [RVs], tour groups
246
Part IV: Living Well with PD

for people with special needs, and cruises) and a link to Travelin’ Talk, a
network of people with disabilities around the world who are in regular
contact and gather firsthand information about accessibility in a particu-
lar area.
 Figure out the transportation. Plane, bus, car, train? Or maybe all of the
above? If you go by car, you and your travel companions are probably
well aware of your limitations and needs. If you’re taking a plane, train,
or bus, contact the company well in advance to discuss provisions they
offer special-needs travelers.
 Be very specific about your needs. For example, you may need your seat
to be close to the bathroom. On the other hand, navigating the entire
length of a jumbo jet as you board just so you can be close to the econ-
omy-class facility may be more trouble than it’s worth. Ask whether you
can have a seat closer to the front and permission to use the closer facil-
ity in business or first class. Note: If you’ll be using a wheelchair — not a
bad idea to conserve energy as you get from place to place within air-
ports and train stations — the carrier needs advance notice.
 Select your overnight accommodations carefully. You may love an old,
historic bed and breakfast, but is that realistic if you have to navigate
stairs (which in old buildings can be steep, winding, and narrow!)? If
you’re fine with a traditional hotel and it publicizes accessibility for
people with special needs, do not take them at their word. Call and ask
specific questions. For example, does the bathroom have grab bars and
a walk-in shower (not a shower in a tub)? Are the doorways wide enough
to accommodate a wheelchair or walker?
 Plan to get out and about. Most tourist attractions in major cities around
the world are well-prepared to accommodate visitors with special needs.
But often the trick is to locate those entrances, facilities, and other spe-
cial services. Call ahead and gather complete information about avail-
able services. Then on the day of your visit, call again and let the staff
on duty know that you’re on your way. (You may want to call the day
before to give advance notice.)
If you or your traveling companion holds a membership in the museum
or site, call the member-services department and let them know you’re
planning a visit. They may be able to offer you and your party more than
the standard accommodations for special-needs visitors.
 Be prepared — just in case. Emergencies happen even on vacation, so
take the following suggestions seriously:
• Always hand-carry your medications, don’t put them in your 
baggage.
• Always take along an extra supply (two to three days’ worth) of
your medications and their prescriptions in case you have to
replace medications.
247
Chapter 17: Adjusting Your Routine as Your PD Progresses

• Always carry a list of your medications (including over-the-counter
products) and the emergency information listed in Chapter 9.
• Ask your neurologist to recommend a colleague in the place you’re
visiting (or check online at www.aan.com for a complete listing of
certified neurologists worldwide).
Volunteering — The double blessing
Giving back to your community and making a real difference in the lives of
other people pays double dividends. Not only are you contributing to the bet-
terment of society — locally, nationally, or globally — but you’re permitting
yourself to turn your attention away from your own problems.
Whether you were an active volunteer before your PD or never had the time
because of work and family responsibilities, now is the time. When you give
of your time and energy in spite of your own challenges, you inspire other
folks and give them hope. If you can manage your PD and mentor a troubled
teen or manage the volunteer program for the blood drive or coordinate a
fundraiser for your church, then you move other people to action. And that’s
something. As one song says, “You can hang a life on that.”
And speaking of getting involved, don’t overlook this golden opportunity to
really make a difference for yourself and other PWP. See Chapter 24 for ways
you can build awareness of and increase knowledge about PD locally or even
nationally. The national PD community is active, organized, and inspiring —
not to mention a great deal of fun.
Taking a Breather — 
Respite for the Weary
Living with a chronic, progressive condition (and living with someone who
has such a condition) can become stressful and even overwhelming as the
months and years go by. The warning signs are right there:
 Communication problems, like increased frustration, irritability, short
tempers
 Physical symptoms, like stomach upset, shortness of breath, headache
 Unhealthy lifestyle behaviors, such as overeating or not eating enough,
increased smoking or alcohol use, sleeping too much or too little
 Emotional symptoms, such as depression, anxiety, feelings of deep anger
or sadness
248
Part IV: Living Well with PD

The trick is not to lose control of these symptoms before you take action. But
the real trick is to plan regular respite for yourself and your care partner —
separately and together — as part of your daily routine. (Even the lowest-
paid laborer gets fifteen-minute breaks a couple of times a shift!) In addition,
you and your care partner need to consider the following:
 Your diagnosis doesn’t require the two of you to be joined at the hip.
You had separate activities before (and probably enjoyed telling your
partner about the experience). That arrangement shouldn’t change
simply because one of you has PD.
 You both need to identify (in some cases, remember) the ways you indi-
vidually relaxed and found respite before PD. Perhaps your partner
spent an afternoon with the grandchildren. Maybe you had a regular
card game. Maybe each of you gave time to a favorite charity.
 Try to plan vacation-type respites together. You’d be surprised how the
travel industry has begun to accommodate the special needs of travel-
ers like you. Check out the Web sites we list in the “Traveling” section
earlier in this chapter.
If long-distance traveling becomes more stressful than fun, then perhaps
going on vacation in your own community is a possibility. Ever notice
how much you enjoy the special sites and events of your community
when you have out-of-town company? Treat yourself — move to a hotel
or accessible Bed and Breakfast for a few days; eat meals out at restau-
rants you’ve been meaning to try; visit a tourist attraction such as a con-
cert, play, or sporting event, and buy souvenirs for the grandkids. Just
remember to pace yourself and get the rest you need to enjoy the trip.
 As your PD progresses, you may find that you don’t have the freedom to
physically get away. Respite for you may come in the form of alternative
and complementary therapies such as meditation or yoga, which we dis-
cuss in Chapter 11. And you may be surprised to discover how regular
exercise can also be a respite therapy (see Chapter 12).
A Word for the PD Care Partner
Watching your loved one struggle to perform simple tasks can be frustrating
and even emotionally painful for you. You may instinctively want to do what-
ever you can to make the task easier. That compassion certainly isn’t bad,
but you really need to fight the follow-through.
Managing the symptoms of PD means the PWP must fight to maintain as
much movement, flexibility, and independence as possible for as long as pos-
sible. If you permit yourself or your loved one to give up on an activity that
she can still do, you’re actually (in a small but significant way) accelerating
the process for real hands-on care.
249
Chapter 17: Adjusting Your Routine as Your PD Progresses

Instead, discuss ways you can help without taking away her ability to manage
on her own. For example, show your complete confidence in her ability by
assuming she will be the one behind the wheel (as usual) when the two of
you go out. At the local coffeehouse, if the PWP’s tremor makes you shudder
every time she tries to transport a cup of coffee from the counter to the
table, ask if you can carry it for her. If she refuses, accept that.
Respite is vital for you and the PWP as you face the progression of current
symptoms and the onset of new ones (see Chapter 18). Take advantage of
available support so you can care for yourself without guilt. You have every
right to do this. Those supports may include:
 Family and friends who assume the role of primary care partner for brief
periods while you take a break
 In-home or respite care or adult day care programs (see Chapter 20)
when care partnering becomes caregiving

O
ver the years you and your care partner will con-
tinue to adapt your lifestyle to the demands of PD.
So it’s wise to prepare and plan for circumstances that
may come in the later stages. The chapters in this part
help you do just that. In this part we look at the financial
and legal matters that everyone (even people who don’t
have PD) needs to work through. We give you information
that helps you remain in your home for as long as possi-
ble, and we set out options for the time when staying at
home may no longer be a good idea. Perhaps of most
importance, this part includes a chapter about a care
partner’s role shift to caregiver.

In This Chapter

 Slaying the dragons (eight of them anyway): Handling those new or increasing 
symptoms
 Refining your offense: Stay in control
S
ooner or later the time will come for you to accept that a progressive dis-
ease like Parkinson’s disease (PD) is reluctant to remain in the back-
ground of your life. In this chapter, we tackle the symptoms that may be
brand new for you — perhaps even unexpected. Or maybe you’ve been deal-
ing with some of them already. Our suggestion? The best defense is a good
offense: Decide to fight back by:
 Discussing any changes in your condition with your neurologist
 Exploring options for additions to your current treatment or therapy
 Preparing for lifestyle changes that may become necessary (such as
relying on a cane or walker or changing your living space arrangements)
On the follow pages, we look at PD symptoms that usually occur later and we
also suggest some realistic ways to combat these symptoms.
Noticing Changes Caused by Your Meds
You may face a couple of challenges after you’ve been on meds that control
your PD symptoms for a while.
The first medication-related challenge is wearing-off, which occurs when your
medication can’t control symptoms over several hours. In this case,

 Symptoms simply return earlier than usual, initially on a predictable
basis (for example, you notice the symptoms return half an hour or an
hour sooner than they used to).
 An unfortunate evolution (the on-off syndrome discussed in Chapter 9)
occurs where you can’t predict the length of symptom control from one
dose to the next. Some people with PD (PWP) get to know the pattern
and may elect to simply live with the off times rather than increase 
medication.
Another challenge brought on by the meds is dyskinesia, that twisting,
writhing movement (see Chapter 9). Dyskinesia is the result of a complex
interaction in the brain between the disease progression and the chronic
administration of dopamine medication. As a result, dyskinesia
 Usually appears after you’ve been on the meds for some time (some-
where between two and ten years)
 Affects PWP in varying degrees that range from mild to severe, depend-
ing on the progression of their disease and their dose of levodopa
Your neurologist may be able to lessen or control your dyskinesias through a
change in your medication routine. If the situation becomes intolerable, your
doctor may suggest DBS surgery. (See Chapter 10.)
The best way to help your doctor control your symptoms is to keep a diary
of the symptoms, including the time of medication intake and the time you
feel the symptoms begin to return.
Doctors treat on-off problems in a variety (or combination) of ways:
 Prescribe medication doses closer together
 Add a second medication
 Increase the dose to reduce wearing-off or reduce to control dyskinesia
Whenever you notice a different reaction to your antiparkinsonian medica-
tions, talk to your neurologist before making any changes in your dosing rou-
tine on your own.
When Communication Becomes Difficult
For PWP, dysarthria (problems with speaking clearly, understanding, reading,
writing, telling time, or using numbers) can be especially disheartening.
These problems in communicating can become downright depressing and
frustrating. The following sections break down two major problems: vocal
and written communication.
254
Part V: Coping with Advanced PD 

The challenge to vocal expression
You can recognize changes in your normal communication by paying atten-
tion to the dynamics of a conversation. Consider the following scenarios:
 People (not just your significant other) seem to be leaning in or straining
to hear and understand what you’re saying. They do a lot of nodding and
smiling but don’t appear to comprehend your ideas.
 People often ask you to repeat what you just said or to speak up.
 People seem to be talking over you or finishing statements for you.
 You’re frustrated from a normal conversation because you’re asked to
repeat yourself, or worse, you’re ignored.
Do these situations seem all too familiar? Try to minimize these frustrations
by asking your family and friends to do the following:
 Be patient and look directly at you when the two of you are talking.
 Try to conduct conversations away from background noises such as
televisions, car radios, or other competing conversations.
 Keep in mind that your mask (lack of facial expression) doesn’t reflect
your level of interest in the conversation. (See Chapter 3 for an earlier
discussion of this symptom.)
You can help yourself, too, by taking care of your voice:
 Take a deep breath and project, without straining or shouting.
 Allow time to rest your voice.
 Slow down if your words come out too fast.
 In any case, use it (talking, reading aloud, and singing). Use it or lose it!
As symptoms progress, you may want to seek help outside of yourself and
your care partner. We help you explore your options in the following sections.
Speech pathologists
Speech pathologists (specially trained speech therapists) have the training
and tools to improve symptoms or delay their worsening by using therapy in
conjunction with your medication regimen. Your therapist can assess your
needs, design a program of exercises to help strengthen your voice, and offer
tips for making communication a more productive and pleasant experience.
If you have no speech professional in your area, consider ordering one or
more of the following tools:

 LSVT (Lee Silverman Voice Treatment) Alive!: An interactive vocal exer-
cise video. (Available at www.lsvt.org or call 888-606-LSVT [5788].)
Special devices
Several devices (such as message boards or more complex voice-activated
software for your computer) can also help by amplifying your voice or
making communicating easier. Note: These devices can be expensive and
awkward to carry around and use. Your speech professional can advise you
on these tools or you can contact the American Speech-Language and
Hearing Association (ASHA) at www.asha.org or 800-638-8255.
Amplifiers that you wear to facilitate communication are also available. Also,
to improve communication via telephone, phone companies offer special
equipment at very low prices and at no cost for customers who qualify. For
more information, contact your phone provider.
Handwriting — Telling the 
story of your on-off cycles
Micrographia is characterized by writing that starts out normal-size but
becomes increasingly smaller and more cramped. This symptom may appear
early in the progression of your PD, later, or not at all. When medications are
managing symptoms well, handwriting may appear normal. But as medica-
tions wear off and the PWP gets closer to the next dose, the fine motor skills
may be compromised. When this happens, your writing may start strong and
normal but quickly trail off into small, cramped letters and words.
Consider these tips to help you compensate for the writing challenges:
 Ask your neurologist to have you write a sentence and then repeat that
exercise at each check-up to see how much (or whether) your micro-
graphia is progressing.
 Talk to your occupational therapist (OT) about tips to help you manage
this symptom.
 Use an electric typewriter or computer for your written communications.
 Use lined paper that’s sold with school supplies (several sizes are avail-
able) to help your pen stay in line.

Part V: Coping with Advanced PD 

Swallowing: You Can’t 
Take It for Granted
In some PWP, dysphagia — swallowing difficulties — becomes a problem as
PD progresses. You may try to write the symptoms off to an unrelated condi-
tion, but these need to be evaluated by a doctor, speech therapist, or speech
pathologist. Don’t ignore the onset of swallowing difficulties. Watch for these
symptoms:
 Difficulty in eating and the need for a beverage to wash food down
 Episodes of food going down the wrong way or food seeming to get
stuck in the throat
 Coughing or throat-clearing during or immediately after consuming food
 Unexplained weight loss
 Refusal of food or drink because swallowing is too difficult and eating
has become an unpleasant experience
 Fever due to aspiration in the lung
 An increase in saliva or thickened mucous-like saliva
 Drooling — a little or a lot
Problems you may have with both saliva and drooling are likely due to your
lack of regular swallowing. Two tips to prevent drooling and control saliva
include the following:
 Keep your head up and your mouth closed when you’re not talking or
eating.
 Take frequent sips of water throughout the day. Doing this not only
reminds you to swallow and keeps you hydrated but also waters down
that thicker saliva.
Your doctor or speech professional may perform an X-ray procedure using
barium to assess the swallowing muscles in action. You may be asked to eat 
a sample of various foods and beverages so that the doctor can evaluate how
different foods and drinks affect your ability to swallow. And you may be
tested at various times in your dosing cycle to determine how your medica-
tions may be affecting your swallowing.
257
Chapter 18: Facing the Progression of PD Symptoms

After the evaluation, your doctor can recommend ways to ease your swallowing
difficulties and make eating and drinking easier. Possible suggestions include:
 Timing your meals during the on cycle of your PD medications
 Cutting food into small bites, chewing thoroughly, and taking a sip of
water before the next bite (yup, the old dieter’s trick)
 Blending fruits and veggies to create a drink — the popular smoothie
that may be easier to swallow.
These may sound like simple solutions, but don’t attempt to self-diagnose a
swallowing problem. It could be a condition completely unrelated to your PD.
Your Vision: A Bump in the Road
Another significant problem that can crop up as your PD progresses is the
potential for changes in your vision — blurred vision, difficulty focusing (and
reading), dry eyes, and such.
Some of these conditions are frequently a part of the aging process and have
easy solutions. For example, your doctor may prescribe a special eye drop or
suggest an over-the-counter (OTC) product for dry eyes. Blurred vision may
also be nothing more than the need for a change in your lens prescription.
On the other hand, your dry eyes may result from the decreased number of
times you blink due to your PD. Fortunately the irritation and discomfort
respond to the same artificial tears product your doctor recommends for
similar problems related to aging.
Other vision problems that can affect PWP are spasm of the eyelid or exces-
sive blinking (blepharospasm) and double vision. Interestingly, the popular
cosmetic injection, Botox, can treat the problem of excessive blinking. Double
vision may be the result of the slowed and uncoordinated movements of your
eyes, and it can be controlled by special lenses (prisms). Wearing a patch
over one eye can help while you wait to see the eye doctor.
As with any health issue, do not attempt to self-diagnose or treat. See your
eye doctor, describe your symptoms, and let the expert prescribe a solution.
To Drive or Not to Drive
Changes from the progression of your PD have the potential to seriously
impair your ability to safely operate motorized vehicles, and that can be huge
for a PWP. Added to vision problems is the potential for
258
Part V: Coping with Advanced PD 

 Wearing off of your meds at inopportune times
 The possible worsening of your rigidity that impairs the coordination
necessary to operate a motor vehicle
 Slowed reaction timing — hazardous for any driver
What to do? How to continue to drive in spite of your PD? How to know when
it’s no longer an option? Follow these suggestions to assure your safety (not
to mention the safety of other people) before you get behind the wheel:
 Be smart about when you drive. Consider limiting (or eliminating) dri-
ving after dark. This isn’t solely a PD issue; lots of people struggle with
night driving as they age.
 Don’t drive if another driver’s available to take the wheel. This includes
public transportation when it’s available.
 Don’t drive after consuming even the smallest amount of alcohol. You
really can’t predict the effects of combining a drink with your meds.
 If you (or your partner) question your ability to drive, play it safe by asking
your occupational therapist (OT) to refer you to a Driver Rehabilitation
Specialist (also an OT but with expertise in this area). Let that person
assess your ability and, if possible, recommend changes (such as not
driving at night or for long distances) that permit you to keep driving.
 For legal reasons, if your PD isn’t a factor in your driving ability, have
your doctor note in your chart that you’re capable of driving — day or
night. This written verification can protect you if an accident occurs and
you’re not at fault.
Especially for men, driving is a mark of independence — that macho thing.
Get over it. If the end of your driving days isolates and depresses you
because you refuse to consider alternatives, that’s on you. You have choices,
including asking a friend or family member (who just happens to be looking
for a concrete way to help) for a lift.
Freezing and Rigidity: When Your Head
Says “Go,” but Your Body Says “No”
Advanced PD often affects your ability to walk safely. What used to be uncon-
scious, easy maneuvers that you took for granted are now major hurdles, just
waiting to trip you up. This section discusses three of the most common
problems: freezing, festination, and rigidity. Also, it includes suggestions to
minimize the greatest concern — your risk of falling.
259
Chapter 18: Facing the Progression of PD Symptoms

Freezing and festination: 
It’s all in the legs
You’re walking along fine and then — Bam! — like the cartoon character who
steps in glue, you’re stuck! Freezing is the sudden inability to step forward,
and it typically happens in three situations:
 As you step out: Start hesitation classically occurs when you attempt to
take the first step forward. The feet are glued to the floor and you may
feel like you’re walking in place. While the feet are stuck, the rest of the
body may lurch forward, placing you at great risk for falling.
 In mid-stride: Even after you get started, freezing often happens in door-
ways or when you need to take a step as you perform another action,
like turning the doorknob.
 When stopping or turning: Freezing and hesitation can really compli-
cate the act of turning around or changing direction — another circum-
stance that’s ripe for a fall.
A growing number of products are designed specifically to address the prob-
lem of freezing, such as some of the walking aids listed in Appendix B. In addi-
tion, exercise videos and booklets offer programs specifically for PWP. Check
out Appendix B as well as Chapter 12.
Another typical walking problem in advanced PD is festination (from the Latin
word festinato or haste) where you take several short, almost running steps in
an effort to regain your balance. This usually occurs as you break out of an
episode of freezing.
You can use several tricks to maintain the rhythm of your walking:
 March in place or hum a marching tune.
 Take a step to the side before attempting to move forward. (This change
in direction seems to interrupt the freezing sensation and allows you to
continue your forward movement.)
 Step over an imaginary line on the ground.
 Visualize your foot moving through space three feet forward.
Rigidity: When your whole body locks up
Rigidity (stiffness in the muscles and limbs) as we discuss in Chapter 2 may
first become evident in a reduced arm swing when walking or as the mask,
loss of animated facial expression (see “When Communication Becomes
260
Part V: Coping with Advanced PD 

Difficult” earlier in this chapter). As PD progresses or if medication becomes
less effective, the severity of rigidity can escalate. Rigidity can also result in
muscular pain. In normal movement, activating one muscle (the agonist) is
offset by relaxing the muscle that performs the opposing action (the antago-
nist). In rigidity, the opposing muscle fails to relax.
Your doctor can determine the degree of rigidity by gently moving the arm,
leg, torso, or shoulder while you’re standing or sitting in a relaxed position.
One classic type of rigidity is known as cogwheel, where the arm, for example,
can move only in short, jerky, or ratchet-like movements. Cogwheel rigidity is
usually associated with resting tremor (tremor is present only in times of
inactivity). Another common type of rigidity is lead pipe, when the muscles
feel heavy and weak and using them causes fatigue.
A program of regular exercise and stretching (see Chapter 12) can be the
most effective weapon to fight increasing stiffness and rigidity. Many commu-
nities offer special exercise programs through the local YMCA or hospital for
people with conditions that cause muscle stiffness, weakness, and rigidity.
Talk to your physical therapist (PT) or support group about the availability of
such a program in your area (or about getting a program started).
PD and Falling — A Tricky 
Balancing Act
The greatest risk as PD advances is the danger of falling. By some estimates,
two-thirds of all PWP experience falls in the mid-to-later stages. This percent-
age is significant because falls are the number one cause of hospitalization
for the PWP due to fractures or head injuries, and because they’re the pre-
cipitant factor in worsening of symptoms or even death due to onset of 
pneumonia.
Your PD symptoms contribute enormously to your possibility of falling. Think
about the following scenarios:
 Your shuffling gait practically begs for the opportunity to trip over a rug
or uneven pavement.
 Your general stiffness and slowness affect reaction time, so you can’t
stop yourself from falling by grabbing onto something.
 Your tendency to overcompensate for impaired balance by swaying
backward when you turn or stand compromises your balance.
As a PWP, you’re at risk to fall from four sources. The following sections cover
those sources and the steps you can take to reduce your risk of falling.
261
Chapter 18: Facing the Progression of PD Symptoms

Mind those meds
Most medications to manage PD symptoms have side effects, including “may
cause dizziness.” Medications for other health conditions (such as high blood
pressure) can add to the problem. If you experience any change in maintain-
ing your balance (stumbling, dizziness, lightheadedness, overcompensating
to stay upright, and so forth), report these changes to your doctor immedi-
ately. And if you’re experiencing new symptoms of dizziness or imbalance
and you’ve had a recent change in meds, the change may be contributing to
the problem. Don’t try to guess — call the doctor.
Anything you can do to prevent a fall is worth the effort. The following sug-
gestions may help:
 Ask your doctor to order an assessment of your current status by a PT
and OT. (See Chapter 6 for info on these specialists.) Ideally the thera-
pist(s) can compare this assessment to one you had shortly after your
diagnosis to evaluate the amount of change.
 The therapist can evaluate your movements and risks for falling and
then suggest changes in your home environment to prevent falls. (See
Chapter 21 for tips on making this home survey yourself.)
 Ask your doctor whether your meds come in a dissolving tablet (you
take them without water) so you can take a dose before you get up. At
some point, you may want to ask your doctor to prescribe a hospital
bed that you can raise and lower for greater assistance.
Steady as she goes
Training and adaptive devices (including the proper cane or walker) can help
you move safely and independently. Please don’t just assume that Uncle Dan’s
old cane is right for you. Ask your therapist to properly fit a device to you.
Falls (and possible injuries that require hospitalization) can lead some people
to pull back on activity. If your fear of falling limits your activity, you may be
doing more harm than you think because staying active — physically and
mentally — goes hand in hand with staving off PD symptoms (and thus pre-
venting more falls). Talk to your doctor about the possibility of a PT or OT
assessment and therapy that helps you adapt and get active again.
Make adjustments along the way
Impaired balance can be part of your PD’s progression (due to your increas-
ing muscle stiffness, rigidity, a stooped posture, and more frequent episodes
of freezing). See the earlier section “Freezing and Rigidity: When Your Head
262
Part V: Coping with Advanced PD 

Says ‘Go,’ but Your Body Says ‘No.’” Never is your team of professional care
partners more important than now. Your doctor, PT, and OT can assess your
needs and make recommendations to help you maintain your balance. In the
meantime, this short list of suggestions can help you prevent a fall:
 Use that cane or walker that your doctor or PT ordered and customized
for your needs.
 Avoid footwear with rubber soles that may stick to the floor. Ask your
PT to suggest the best footwear for you.
 Use a recommended trick for maintaining a rhythm as you walk (see
“Freezing and festination: It’s all in the legs” earlier in this chapter).
 Focus on walking rather than distractions. For example, don’t try to talk
on a portable phone and walk around at the same time.
 Take time to turn (TTT). Walking a few extra steps to make a wide turn is
far better than pivoting suddenly and losing your balance.
Overcoming Sleep Disturbances
Anything that causes a disruption of normal sleep on an ongoing basis and
prevents you from getting the rest you need is considered a sleep disturbance.
Disturbances may have a number of causes: genetic or environmental factors
(such as shift work), age, medications, and diet.
PWP are particularly prone to develop sleep disturbances for a wide variety
of symptom-related reasons:
 Difficulty turning in bed or medication-induced dyskinesias may disturb
the level of muscle relaxation necessary to sleep.
 Urinary urgency and frequency may force you to visit the bathroom sev-
eral times during the night.
 Medication to treat your PD symptoms, if taken too close to bedtime,
may cause vivid dreams or agitation that awakens you.
 Anxiety and depression, which frequently affect PWP (see Chapter 13),
can make falling asleep difficult (anxiety) and can cause you to wake
early or sleep too much (depression).
In addition, PWP may experience a number of specific sleep disturbances.
The most important one is rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disor-
der, a condition that makes you act out your dreams, unknowingly talk out
loud, move your limbs, and sometimes even hit your bed partner! All of these
actions can create a state of chronic sleep deprivation that leads to fatigue,
excessive daytime sleepiness, and visual hallucinations.
263
Chapter 18: Facing the Progression of PD Symptoms

However, keep in mind that many sleep disturbances can be improved simply
by developing better sleep habits. The American Academy of Neurology
offers the following tips:
 Sleep only when drowsy and only in the bedroom.
 Keep lights and noise low when trying to sleep, but keep a night light on
to prevent falls if you need to get up in the night.
 Limit your intake of tobacco products, caffeine (chocolate, coffee, non-
herbal tea, and such), and alcohol.
 Don’t eat a heavy meal or participate in strenuous exercise for four to
six hours before bedtime.
 Make use of relaxation and stress relief techniques (see Chapter 11).
Of course, like any new or troublesome symptom, discuss a sleep distur-
bance with your neurologist. The problem may be a side effect of your med-
ications or a signal of a more serious condition such as sleep apnea
syndrome, which requires specialized management.
Those Embarrassing Constipation
and Urinary Issues
The good news: Although a nuisance for PWP, urinary and bowel issues are
often treatable and manageable even with the progression of PD.
As we note in Chapter 17, never automatically dismiss urinary or bowel prob-
lems as unrelated to your PD. If incontinence or constipation becomes a
problem as your PD progresses (or you’ve had issues in the past but they
seem to be worsening), tell your doctor. While both conditions are common
side effects of many medications (even common OTC meds), simply stopping
or changing meds may not relieve symptoms.
In some cases PWP may suffer from an overactive bladder and feel an urgency
to get to the bathroom as soon as possible, especially at night. Other PWP
may experience an inability to fully empty the bladder, so they need to go
again within a short time. Malfunction of the bladder isn’t uncommon in PD. If
you’re experiencing such symptoms, you need to tell your doctor. In males,
the problem can be an enlarged prostate gland; in women it may be an infec-
tion (called a urinary tract infection or UTI). In either case, your doctor may
recommend that you see a urologist to rule out other causes.
The slowed movement that is a core part of PD can make constipation a rela-
tively common problem for PWP. Because of other issues that can crop up
with the progression of PD (swallowing difficulties that lead to a poorer diet,
264
Part V: Coping with Advanced PD 

not drinking enough liquids, and infrequent exercise due to increased impair-
ment to movement and balance control), constipation can become a recur-
rent problem for many PWP.
Let your doctor know of any changes in your normal bowel or urinary habits.
In the meantime, you know the routine (your mother probably drummed it
into you when you were a kid):
 Drink plenty of water: Yes, even if you need to go all the time.
 Eat your roughage: Also known as fiber (fruits, veggies, and whole
grains). See www.mypyramid.gov.
 Get daily exercise: No, reaching for the remote doesn’t count!
Dealing with the Big “D” — Dementia
Dementia may be one of the most frightening and unsettling words in the
English language. Just to be very clear, the term means
 A person’s intellectual function is impaired to the degree that it affects
normal and routine activities (such as decision making, balancing a
checkbook, and such) and relationships with other people.
 Possible changes occur in behavior and personality. A person with
dementia may experience delusions or hallucinations.
 At least two normal functions of the brain (including memory, reasoning,
perception, judgment, and such) are affected. Memory loss by itself is
not dementia.
Dementia — senile or otherwise — isn’t a normal part of aging.
Probably the question uppermost in your mind is: Is dementia part of PD’s
progression? The answer is: It may be, but it may not necessarily be true for
you. In general, dementia seems to more frequently affect patients over the
age of 70 and those in the late stages of the disease.
Everyone experiences the progression of PD in a unique way. So learn what
you can about dementia and consider how you and your care partner may
handle its possible onset. Then get back to living your life.
PD is not Alzheimer’s disease
Today Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most commonly recognized con-
ditions associated with dementia. A person with AD faces a progressive loss
265
Chapter 18: Facing the Progression of PD Symptoms

of intellectual and mental function. Dementia in AD is a primary dementia.
This means it doesn’t result from any other disease or condition.
In contrast, for people with conditions that affect movement or other func-
tions (such as PD), dementia is a secondary dementia. That is, it appears to
arise from a separate source. For example, a person with PD may also have
high blood pressure or other cardiovascular conditions and may develop
symptoms of dementia related to those conditions. This form is then termed
vascular dementia.
PWP may develop AD in their later years, or they may develop Lewy body
dementia, a disturbance of their cognition characterized mainly by fluctua-
tions in attention and alertness, executive dysfunction, and recurrent visual
hallucinations. (When dementia occurs very early in PD, the term Lewy body
disease indicates a separate disease in its own right.) But whether the onset
of the secondary dementia is linked to PD or simply co-exists (like PD plus dia-
betes) is currently unknown. Recent studies of brains at different stages of PD
suggest that dementia may be the very last pathological stage of the disease.
The point is this: The onset of dementia in a PWP isn’t a foregone conclusion,
and it isn’t the same as AD. You need to report any sign of cognitive malfunc-
tion to your doctor, because your sudden hallucinations or excessive sleepi-
ness and dull mind may have a perfectly logical (and treatable) explanation.
Reviewing those cognitive symptoms
Although Chapter 3 has a full discussion of cognitive symptoms, a quick
review is helpful in this chapter’s context of PD progression.
Having some cognitive symptoms doesn’t necessarily mean you’re headed
for full-blown dementia. Don’t panic, but do talk to your doctor if you’re expe-
riencing any of the following:
 Anxiety or depression are part and parcel of PD. Focus on the fact that
they’re treatable. If you ignore or refuse to acknowledge these symp-
toms, shame on you. (If you haven’t read Chapter 13, do it soon.)
 Executive dysfunction can include troubles with balancing your check-
book, following directions, making routine decisions, and such.
Fortunately, you can strengthen and exercise your mind and possibly
keep this problem at bay. (See the following section “When Medical
Treatments Are Limited.”)
 Hallucinations (seeing objects that really aren’t there — perhaps a child
or animal passing quickly by your door or simply feeling the presence of
266
Part V: Coping with Advanced PD 

a person without actually seeing that person) can be a side effect of
your medications. But as your PD advances, these visual (and usually
harmless) hallucinations maybe associated with a cognitive disorder. As
with everything that seems out of the norm, you (or your care partner)
need to let your doctor know. Simple medication changes or adding
others medications to block hallucinations may help.
When Medical Treatments Are Limited
Identifying the various symptoms that may worsen or appear as your PD
advances is only one piece of the puzzle. Another piece is addressing those
changes. What options do you have when medical treatments can’t provide
the answer?
You have a number of resources — all within your grasp — for fighting back if
you have to face the onset of new symptoms or the progression of your pre-
sent symptoms. The following guidelines can help you stay the course:
 Continue to eat a healthy diet rich in antioxidants (see Chapter 12).
 Continue your daily exercise program (also discussed in Chapter 12).
 Continue to exercise that mind! Mental activities (no, TV doesn’t count)
can help to keep your mind agile.
 If possible, consider taking a class or starting a new hobby.
 At the very least, remain socially active and engaged in the world and
the community around you.
Yes, you may be approaching the point where you rely on other people more.
But this doesn’t mean you have to surrender all decisions and control. Your
lifestyle and life choices can play an enormous role in your ability to post-
pone your PD’s progression. Keep fighting! Keep moving! Keep living!
A Word for the PD Care Partner
As your partner’s PD progresses, you may face some tough challenges like
having to persuade him to give up driving or acknowledge that he’s showing
more and more signs of cognitive impairment that can impact his safety. Such
challenges can seem even more difficult because you’ve both been living with
PD for a number of years. Obvious symptoms that the PD is getting worse can
267
Chapter 18: Facing the Progression of PD Symptoms

add strain to the relationship. The following tips may help you hold it
together as you and your PWP enter this new phase of living with PD:
 Acknowledge changes as they come and seek the advice of the neurolo-
gist especially if you notice any unusual progression of symptoms (like
sleep disturbances or onset of visual hallucinations) or recurring behav-
ior (excessive eye-blinking or increased urinary urgency).
 Continue to prepare for potential lifestyle changes that may become nec-
essary (such as a change in living accommodations) and check out avail-
ability of options in your community.
 Let someone else be the villain when it comes to taking away driving priv-
ileges. If you’re concerned, let the PWP’s doctor know. The doctor can
order a driving evaluation and make recommendations based on that.
 If the doctor doesn’t respond to your concerns about your partner’s dri-
ving, contact a representative in your state motor vehicle department
and ask her to require a road test as a step in renewing the license.
 If you begin to feel overwhelmed with more and more of the responsibili-
ties (financial, physical, emotional), talk to your support group contacts
or facilitator, your clergyperson, or the counselor you found when you
and your PWP set up the healthcare team (see Chapter 6); ask for some
concrete tips for coping.
 Realize that you’re in danger of burning out. Attending to your needs for
regular short-term breaks and an occasional long-term respite are keys
to keep on keeping on. Plan for these breaks and consider them as vital
to living with PD as your partner’s timely medications.
If you and your partner have prepared for this day, you’ve already discussed
some difficult decisions. Your partner now needs to accept and appreciate
that you’re simply carrying out those decisions you made months or years
ago. If your partner is incapable of understanding (or appreciating) that fact,
remind yourself that he’s still in control. But you need to remember: Having
made the choices together, you’re now simply carrying out his wishes. (For
more advice on coping with progressing care, read Chapter 19.)

 Lining up the secondary team
 Caring words for the caregiver
You’re likely to live for many years in spite of your Parkinson’s disease
(PD). The prognosis is hopeful and every day brings us all closer to a
cure. But as your PD progresses, the day may come — most likely following a
fall and maybe a fracture that requires hospitalization — when you’ll need
more hands-on, direct care.
We hope you’ve had a care partner as you’ve made your PD journey to this
point. But that can be good and bad news. The good news is that this person
is the most likely candidate to become your primary caregiver, and he or she
is probably very familiar with you and the path your PD has taken. The bad
news is that you’ve gotten pretty used to being in charge. Handing off that
control will take some adjustment.
As your need for care increases, you’ll almost certainly be surrounded by dif-
ferent tiers of care. Your primary caregiver is the person who takes the lead,
manages your care day-to-day, and acts as your spokesperson if you can’t
speak for yourself. But you’ll also need secondary caregivers. These people
(usually other family members and friends) take on a specific role, like han-
dling your finances or doing the grocery shopping.
In this chapter, we consider that transition from partnering to receiving the care
of another person because of your symptoms’ progression (see Chapter 18
for more on these). This chapter covers specific changes in your caregiver’s
new role and how your relationship with that person may adjust. We also

offer alternative arrangements that may be necessary over time, give you a
heads-up on the biggest challenges of this transition, and suggest ways to
develop your secondary caregivers. Finally, we offer straight talk and impor-
tant suggestions for your care partner.
Understanding Your Primary 
Caregiver’s Role
By definition, caregivers provide some type of hands-on assistance to other
people. That assistance may be in the area of handling finances, managing
legal affairs, providing emotional support, attending to routine chores,
administering personal care, or any combination of these categories.
According to the Family Caregiver Alliance, as many as 52 million family care-
givers in the United States provide care for an adult (age 20 and over) family
member or friend. Most caregivers (75 percent) are women, and about half of
all caregivers are employed elsewhere full-time.
Your caregiver is the person who takes primary responsibility in providing
more intensive home and personal care assistance. This person is who you
trust to abide by your wishes — the ones you made clear in better times —
and to speak for you if you’re unable to speak for yourself.
Your caregiver isn’t the person with PD. Life will go on for this person after
the time for giving care has passed. And he deserves to attend to that life
while still attending to your needs. As your relationship adjusts to a new bal-
ance of roles, remember that this is the same person who’s been right there
with you as your partner. He’s well aware of the emotional and psychological
impact these challenging times have on both of you.
Giving care versus partnering in care
Your roles are changing now. More and more it’s your care-partner-turned-
caregiver who must take charge of decisions and actions that affect your welfare
and safety. Decisions that once focused on your needs must now increasingly
focus on your caregiver’s needs, abilities, and emotional strength in order to
deliver what you need when you need it without sacrificing her normal routine.
Never will it be more tempting to give in to the anger and resentment that this
widening chasm can create. Never will your care-partner-turned-caregiver
need your love, appreciation, and emotional support more.
And yet an important element of partnering remains. If you and your partner
have prepared for this day, discussed the difficult decisions that you knew
you might face, and explored options to address your increasing needs, then
270
Part V: Coping with Advanced PD 

your partner is simply carrying out the decisions you both made months or
even years ago.
Is your care partner a novice 
or a natural caregiver?
Some people are natural nurturers. Others are not. Some come to the role of
caregiver with years of experience already under their belts. Other folks who
are new to the role may find themselves entering a strange world that they’re
not prepared to tackle. But most caregivers have one fact in common: The
need to step in sneaks up on them. One day their loved one is managing fairly
well, and the next day the caregiver suddenly needs to intervene. The ongo-
ing care becomes not only necessary, but essential.
Keep in mind that not everyone is up to the job. Just because a person is your
spouse or adult child and the most obvious candidate, this doesn’t mean that
he’s physically and emotionally prepared to take on increasingly complex care-
giving duties. You and your care partner need to keep an open mind and be will-
ing to creatively decide how best to meet your needs as your PD progresses.
It’s called the 36-hour day for a reason
Jus how long the need for care will continue is hard to estimate. It can be any-
where from a year to decades. But if the caregiver devotes 20 to 40 hours a
week (as statistics indicate) to giving care in addition to the other roles she’s
juggling, then the idea of a 36-hour day fits.
In addition to selecting the best caregiver for the job, you and your care part-
ner need to get real about how much time it’s going to take and where that
time will come from. Two lives are at stake here — yours and your caregiver’s.
At this stage (as in the earlier stages), each of you has the right to maintain
some semblance of a lifestyle that fills your physical, mental, emotional, and
spiritual needs. (For more ideas on how to make your priorities a reality, check
out Chapters 7 and 15 for your relationships and Chapters 6, 13, and 17 for
physical, emotional, and spiritual suggestions.)
Considering How Your Relationships 
May Change
If you’ve prepared for this day, you and your significant other (or adult child
or other care partner) have discussed the what-will-happen-when questions.
271
Chapter 19: When Care Partners Become Caregivers

And you’ve thought about how to address your increasing need to rely on
other people. The most likely candidates for caregiver are pretty obvious, but
each situation comes with a history that can affect this shift in roles.
When you rely on your spouse or 
significant other: A balancing act
“Grow old along with me . . .” the old saying goes.
In a marriage or union between two people, each person settles into a role.
She pays the bills and manages the day-to-day budget. He handles their finan-
cial and healthcare security. She’s the gardener; he’s the cook. She’s the social
butterfly; he prefers staying home with a good book. Through the years, they
develop ways of compromising, moving out of their comfort zones, and rein-
venting themselves individually as they find their way as a couple.
So, what happens if everything shifts? He has advanced PD and can no longer
safely prepare the meals. She takes this on. When going out becomes more
difficult for him, she adapts by staying home to be with him. He feels guilty
that his PD impacts her life so much; she reassures him but can’t deny a
sense of mourning at how their lives have changed. As the caregiving
becomes more intense, perhaps she abandons more and more of those activi-
ties that gave her identity.
When one partner becomes the caregiver, both partners need to maintain
balance as their duties and responsibilities shift. The best way you and your
care partner can accomplish this shift is through your willingness to accept
the help of other people. This help can free your partner to pursue (in moder-
ation) her life, and (if she accepts this help as your contribution to the rela-
tionship) it can relieve her guilt for wanting a life beyond your PD.
When your adult child steps 
up: You’re still the parent
Sometimes the relationship that comes from an adult child caring for a parent
has been called parenting our parents. Wrong! Roles may shift as you turn to
your child for advice on finances or assistance with daily chores, but the rela-
tionship between you and your child has a history. There’s no reversal here.
(See Chapter 15 for more discussion on this relationship.)
If your adult child becomes your primary caregiver, your history influences
the relationship you forge. Although the ways you’ve communicated (or not)
272
Part V: Coping with Advanced PD 

through the years may have mellowed, the base of your relationship doesn’t
change just because you now need help. And this reality may be good, or it
may cause some rough moments.
The key for this caregiving relationship is one of mutual respect. As an adult,
your child deserves the same trust and respect that you would extend to any
person of maturity and experience. At the same time, that child needs to
accept that — regardless of your frailties and even childlike dependencies —
you’re still a grown-up with a history of managing your own life.
When your sibling comes to 
your aid: Rivalries remain
Family history plays a part with siblings too. Your position within the family
order (eldest, middle, youngest) continues to impact the relationship. “Mom
always liked you best” isn’t forgotten, although someone may mention it in
jest these days. Old jealousies, wounds, and slights that you never addressed
as adults can still fester. Labels from when you were small can linger. “Mary
was the smart one.” “Jim was the family comedian.”
If a sibling seems the most likely candidate to become your caregiver and
spokesperson, the time to mend fences is way before that day arrives. You
also need to set ground rules about the way you live your life and interact
with other people. If your sibling can’t respect your ways and expects you to
adapt to his, the relationship may be under stress from day one. And, trust
us, the last thing you need in your life is more stress.
When your friends offer to help: 
Are they in it for the long haul?
If you’re single and have no family member close enough (geographically or
emotionally) to consider as your caregiver, you may turn increasingly to a
long-time friend for help and support. Although this pattern can and does
work for many people, take care. A lifelong friendship can be destroyed if
both sides aren’t absolutely upfront about giving and receiving care.
Identify the specific ways you anticipate needing help. Start with one task —
perhaps transportation to and from doctor appointments or a daily call or
visit to be sure you’re okay. Friends are usually quite willing (even anxious)
to step up, but they need direction. Bottom line: If they need to back off, they
need to know you’ll understand and can find another source for help.
273
Chapter 19: When Care Partners Become Caregivers

Exploring Alternative Arrangements
If you’ve been living alone, you may need to look outside your immediate
home for the care partner who’s willing to take on caregiving as your PD pro-
gresses. In fact, you may want to split the job up and enlist more than one
caregiver.
When the most obvious caregiver 
lives far away
In today’s world, family members often scatter across a wide area. The most
obvious caregiver may be someone living miles away. Short of you or this
person making a major move, what are your choices?
Making a long-distance arrangement
One caregiver in Wisconsin managed care for her parents in Virginia over an
eight-year period without anyone having to move. When long-distance care-
givers take care of loved ones, the keys are knowledge and preparation.
Take these two steps:
1. Know ahead of time what programs and services your community has
for support and care.
2. Prepare for the day that your needs increase:
• Establish contacts within those community programs.
• Identify emergency caregivers who can step in for a short time
until the long-distance caregiver can arrive.
Establishing an emergency backup
Emergency caregivers are people who are available to step in when some-
thing unforeseen arises. Their role is temporary but important.
Your emergency caregiver may be a neighbor who’s home during the day
(while your primary caregiver works) or a friend who’s agreed to assume this
key role. It may be your clergyperson who can marshall the forces of the con-
gregation to step in until more permanent help arrives.
Whoever you identify for this role, you — and especially your long-distance
caregiver — need to establish a plan for emergency action sooner rather than
later. If you fall and your primary caregiver is miles away, who will come to
your aid?
274
Part V: Coping with Advanced PD 

When no one applies
In rare cases, no single person can step in and assume the role of primary
caregiver. When that happens, don’t despair. You have at least two options
for preparing for the day when you need more hands-on care.
The first option
Assess how you can remain in your home and get the help you need. Some
aspects of this plan are easier than others. For example,
 Many pharmacies and grocery stores offer a delivery service for medica-
tions and food.
 You can address safety issues by installing a phone service and wearing
a pager. If you don’t contact the service within a specified time each day
(or even twice a day), then the service contacts someone to come and
check on you. Or if you fall and need help, you can activate the pager.
The second option
Other facets of care are more complex. How are you going to manage routine
tasks such as showering, shaving, or shampooing? How are you going to manage
financial matters if you begin to experience diminished mental capacity?
Consider a change in residence sooner rather than later. At the very least,
community services can be a lifeline for you. Or you may consider an actual
move. Options such as assisted living facilities and so-called step communi-
ties are two possibilities. For a full discussion of care and housing options
and how to manage the costs, see Chapters 21 and 22.
Making the Transition
When the transition from partnering to caregiving begins in earnest, you and
your caregiver need to be ready for the learning curve. Consider these new
challenges:
 Moving from independence to the need for assistance
 Rapidly shifting from partner to caregiver, a seemingly full-time job
 Moving from blind stubbornness to acceptance
 Consciously recognizing the emotional roller coaster you’ve boarded —
right when your physical and emotional defenses are down
275
Chapter 19: When Care Partners Become Caregivers

Your best tactic is to acknowledge the difficult feelings (see Chapter 24) that
come with those challenges and deal with them head on. Get professional
help to deal with the transition if you need it.
Just make sure that you understand that accepting help from others —
regardless of how independent and self-sufficient you’ve always tried to be —
is simply one more tool you and your primary care partner have. Allowing
others (friends, extended family, the community) to provide assistance gives
you much needed support in preserving your energy to live life as fully as
possible for as long as possible.
Learning to accept help
Humans are by nature fiercely independent and perhaps never more so than
when that autonomy is threatened by illness or other circumstances beyond
their control.
One of the concepts we try to instill throughout this book is that fighting PD
is a team effort. If it takes a village to raise a child properly, it takes a contin-
gent of healthcare professionals, family, and friends to maintain a life with PD.
You may be the quarterback, but you need every one of those other players
to help you run those plays and live on your own terms.
There’s no shame in accepting the help of other people. As a matter of fact,
you’re often helping them! You empower them by needing them. And you
enrich their lives by giving them a way to tangibly demonstrate their love and
respect for you.
You know how much you hate this PD being all about you — the glances, the
murmured comments when people think you’re out of earshot. You have just
one way to change that: Take control, and accept the help you need.
Still not convinced the time has come to seek additional help? Think again.
Maybe you’re reading this chapter because you already suspect you and your
care partner can no longer manage totally on your own. But refusing to
acknowledge it (and then make the necessary changes and accept help) can
result in serious setbacks for both of you. Some of these can be:
 A toll on your relationship
 Financial costs associated with emergencies brought on by your refusal
to accept help
 Isolation that comes from managing your PD to the exclusion of every-
thing and everyone else
 Confusion from managing alone, trying to protect your independence
276
Part V: Coping with Advanced PD 

 Ignored warning signs (such as anger, depression, guilt, and other diffi-
cult feelings)
 Damaged health (physical, mental, emotional) and financial well-being
for you and your care partner
Whether you enlist the help of other people or make a more permanent
change (like moving to a different residence where support and care are read-
ily available), don’t be stubborn about this. Don’t toy with your life and the
life of your beloved, devoted care partner. Snap out of it!
Take charge by establishing a routine for daily, weekly, and long-term breaks
(be sure you read the section “Dealing with burnout” later in this chapter)
and by accepting the help and support that’s within your reach.
Remembering that your PD isn’t 
your caregiver’s fault
The song says you always hurt the one you love. And it happens fairly inno-
cently. Your care partner knows you aren’t always at your best and doesn’t
expect you to be. You can let go of the brave façade, the “I’m doing great”
demeanor, with this person.
But avoid going too far with this. The dark side of being yourself comes out
when you start taking out your anger and frustration on that person. This
emotion may come in the form of a short temper, snappish comments, or
actual physical lashing out. It may also come in more subtle ways, like shut-
ting the person out through silence or isolating the person from his own life
by your neediness.
Your care partner has surrendered a piece of his life to continue this journey
with you. Just how great that sacrifice turns out to be may be up to you.
Dealing with burnout
If you or your care partner were not dealing with the terrible situation, if both
of you were living normal lives, wouldn’t you make room for regular breaks
from routine? Consider how most jobs include breaks, holidays, vacation
time, and personal days. You deserve at least that same consideration!
Review your current situation
Burnout is common in the workplace and even more so among caregivers.
However, rarely do you hear about burnout in the person with PD (PWP) or in
277
Chapter 19: When Care Partners Become Caregivers

people with other chronic, progressive conditions that require constant
adjustment and adaptation. Ask yourself and your care partner the following
questions:
 Is it becoming increasingly difficult for each of you to face the daily chal-
lenges of your PD?
 Is your care partner showing signs of health changes — sleeplessness,
under-eating or overeating, headaches, or vague complaints of aches
and pains?
 Do you or your care partner react to good news or complaints with irri-
tation, cynicism, or sarcasm? (In other words, has your ability to show
interest in or concern for other people been compromised?)
 Are the two of you often irritable and impatient with each other?
 Are you seeing signs that you or your care partner is becoming increas-
ingly isolated, sad, lonely, or resentful of others?
Then ask these big questions and be brutally honest in answering:
 Do you or your care partner reject suggestions and offers of help
because you believe other people just don’t get it? (They haven’t been
through this, so they can’t possibly understand!)
 Do you honestly believe that only your care partner and you can make
this work?
If you answered “Yes” to two of the first five questions for yourself or your
care partner, think burnout. If you answered “Yes” to one or both of the last two
questions, you need a break, possibly some counseling, and you need it now.
Ask for additional help
Ideally, sit down with your care partner and consider the following ideas
together:
 Identify your personal support network and your care partner’s. Note:
They’re not necessarily the same people. To do this, list the one or two
people that each of you would call if you just needed to vent. Then add
the names of three or four people you’d call for specific help or the
occasional favor.
 Of these people, have you or your care partner turned down help from
one or more of them?
 If you’ve rejected their support, how can you reopen the door and wel-
come them back as active partners in care?
278
Part V: Coping with Advanced PD 

If the person accepts your overture and asks what you need, be prepared
with specifics. For example, “Can you just stop by for a visit while my care
partner goes to the store? It’s getting harder for her to take me along, and,
frankly, the break does us both good.”
Consider counseling to get your head and spirit straight
Depending on how far you’ve distanced yourselves from other people, profes-
sional counseling may be necessary. But you have other choices that carry
built-in benefits of community and social interaction. Check out these three
possibilities:
 Support group: Okay, you may have resisted this option up until now,
but get over it — if not for yourself, then for your care partner. Properly
facilitated support groups can be a real source of new ideas, local infor-
mation and updates, and even inspiration for managing your PD more
effectively.
You may need to visit more than one group to find a good match, but
smaller communities may not have a group specifically for PD. To find sup-
port groups in your area, go to the National Parkinson Foundation Web site
(www.parkinson.org), or, for more general information, go to the Web
site of the National Family Caregivers Association (www.nfcacares.org).
 Community: Every community has counseling resources for low or even
no cost. For example:
• Religious communities have one or two clergypersons well known
for providing comfort and counsel. The clergyperson doesn’t need
to be yours (or even of your faith).
• Hospitals, your local library, and civic groups may offer commu-
nity programs with experienced speakers addressing topics of loss,
aging, living with chronic illness, and so forth.
• Funeral homes often offer grief counseling by a professional who’s
trained in helping people work through a loss. Certainly you and
your care partner have suffered loss as your PD’s progressed.
 Professional: At some point you or your care partner may benefit from
the guidance of a professional. There’s no shame in this. Your physician,
hospital or home care social worker, and local Office on Aging are good
resources for referrals.
Plan for the healing power of R&R
Good news: You can avoid much of the damage caused by burnout if you
build regular respite into your routine — early on. This means planning daily
279
Chapter 19: When Care Partners Become Caregivers

and weekly breaks as well as the occasional (but just as regular) longer
hiatus, as we describe in the following:
 Daily short-term respite means at least two timeouts — separately or
together. Perhaps your care partner takes a walk while you watch a
sports event on television, or you call a friend while she takes a long,
hot bath, or the two of you order takeout from a favorite restaurant, or
you watch a favorite movie together. Whatever the respite, be sure you
plan it, schedule it, and don’t cancel it (okay, short postponements are
acceptable).
 Weekly breaks may include trips to the beauty salon or manicurist, card
night, choir practice, a movie, or a club meeting. These breaks last a
couple of hours, and support group meetings don’t count because respite
means getting away from everything to do with PD. Plan the breaks, write
them on the calendar in ink, and make them non-negotiable — unless the
house is on fire.
 The longer hiatus can take many forms but usually lasts several hours
to several days. Only you and your care partner can best identify the
rest and relaxation you need. It may be a trip to the city for shopping,
dining out, and seeing a play. It may be a place without a phone that
gives you time to unwind with a book, take a walk in the woods, stroll
along a beach, and so on. Such breaks take careful planning but they’re
doable. And the pay-off can be enormous for you as individuals and for
your relationship.
If your care partner receives vacation, holiday, and personal time from work,
it’s not respite if he spends it catching up with a household, a family, and your
PD. Respite isn’t about labeling time; it’s about how time is used. It’s taking a
break and getting away from everything to do with giving or receiving care.
Recruiting Secondary Caregivers
Okay, your chronic PD has progressed. Little tasks that once were doable are
now nearly exhausting — and frankly not always worth the effort. Spending
the day in your pj’s is easier than the hassle of getting dressed. Brushing or
styling your hair is a joke, and shaving or trying to apply make-up? Forget it!
Now you carefully time your appointments or activities to your on-off cycles.
Your concentration isn’t what it once was, and you’re beginning to worry that
you may be letting important details (like paying the light bill) slip.
On top of all this, you’re seriously worried about your partner — the worry
lines around her eyes and mouth, the constant exhaustion, and the lack of
attention to personal needs, activities, and grooming. Your partner needs
some help — and so do you.
280
Part V: Coping with Advanced PD 

Calling another meeting
We hope you and your family met soon after your diagnosis to talk about the
ways PD was likely going to impact your lives (see Chapter 7). Now, as the
symptoms worsen and new symptoms seem inevitable, you need to gather
the troops once again. This time the agenda is different.
In some cases your adult children may bring everyone together. This family
meeting may take on the trappings of an intervention if your family believes
that you and your care partner are being overly stubborn about asking for
and accepting help. Far better for you to acknowledge early on that you need
additional help and take charge of the meeting on your terms.
Extending the invitation
Woody Allen once said that 80 percent of success is simply showing up. And
that comment is especially true when you have a family meeting to discuss
help and support — you need the family to actually show up. Their good
intentions just won’t cut it. Although we don’t suggest subterfuge for getting
family members on board, you need to do what you can to gather the family
in one place at one time. If that plan’s next to impossible, then choose a
family holiday when you plan to be together — Thanksgiving or a major
birthday for you or your care partner.
Consider these suggestions to help organize this meeting:
 Make it clear to family members that the day will include a discussion of
the future for you and your care partner.
 If the gathering involves young children, make plans to occupy them for
two to three hours. Ideally, arrange for them to be at another site so
they don’t interrupt the meeting.
 If a family member refuses to attend the meeting, assure the other family
members that you’ll speak with this person privately about a commit-
ment to your care. And if that person clearly isn’t on board with this
arrangement, then drop it for now. Perhaps down the road (maybe when
someone else is burning out) this person may step up.
Preparing the agenda
For this meeting, you have three goals:
 You and your roster of care partners need to face facts. Your PD has
advanced, and your spouse, significant other, adult child, or other rock
you’ve been leaning on can’t do it all.
281
Chapter 19: When Care Partners Become Caregivers

 You now need more hands-on and supportive care for you and your pri-
mary care partner.
 Everyone needs to understand the situation and figure out how to make
some definitive contribution.
Initially you and your care partner will approach family for this care and sup-
port. But in some situations the family is either unwilling or unavailable. In
that case you can follow a similar guide for a meeting with friends and neigh-
bors who have expressed a desire to help. Just keep in mind that your friends
and neighbors aren’t family — they don’t owe you anything.
The meeting will outline the following details:
 Help that you need now (chores, bathing, transportation, and so forth)
• Specifically name the task; quantify how often you need the help
and when you need it. (Some tasks are seasonal, like putting up
screens and cleaning out gutters; others are regular, like helping
you shower or staying with you once a week while your care part-
ner is out.)
• Indicate community services (and their costs) that can provide the
assistance
 Help that you’ll likely need within the coming year
• How often and when
• Availability and cost of community or paid services
You probably won’t need help with everything — at least not all at once. But
identify all the areas you may need assistance as your PD progresses. The fol-
lowing is a partial list to get you started:
 Hygiene: Bathing or showering, oral hygiene, dressing, personal groom-
ing (hair, nails, and so on), other personal hygiene such as odor due to
urinary incontinence
 Medications: Organizing and storing, dispensing, refilling prescriptions
 Transportation: To and from medical appointments, to and from com-
munity or social events, to and from shopping
 Exercise and recreation: Prescribed exercise for flexibility and strength-
ening, personal exercise preference such as yoga or T’ai Chi, pursuit of
hobbies and leisure time activities
 Basic nursing tasks: Ambulation (walking from room to room), transfer-
ring (from bed to chair to car and such), care of medical equipment such
as a catheter
 Emergency care (prepare every caregiver in basic first aid): Wound
care, falls, fractures, fainting, choking, adverse reactions to medications
282
Part V: Coping with Advanced PD 

 Household chores: Exterior home maintenance (regular like grass cut-
ting; seasonal like snow-shoveling), interior home maintenance (regular
like weekly cleaning; occasional like changing the furnace filter), errands
(like grocery shopping and trips to the post office), meal preparation
 Financial tasks: Bill paying (like utilities or medical and household
bills), taxes (preparing, filing), money management (like investments
and pensions)
As you prepare these lists, don’t be too quick to surrender a task (such as
grocery shopping) if it gives you or your primary care partner a break from
confinement to the house. In this case, the opportunity for socialization and
being out in the world may have greater value than the assistance. Perhaps
someone can stay with you while your partner shops. Then that secondary
caregiver can assist in bringing in the groceries and putting them away.
Turning over the meeting
Surprise! We suggest that you open the meeting, lay out the agenda (see the
previous section) . . . and then leave. Why should you do this when you and
your life are under discussion? Simple. Family members may find it difficult
to admit limitations and aversions to giving care; saying this to your face can
be even more difficult. When you leave, let your primary care partner take
over the facilitation of the meeting, or, better yet, you may want to ask a third
party (such as your support group leader or clergyperson) to conduct the
meeting. The point is to create an environment where those in attendance
feel free to express concerns and limits without hurting your feelings.
Especially in families with a history of discord, asking an objective third
party to direct the entire meeting is a good move. A trusted clergyperson,
counselors, and the facilitator of your support group are possible candidates.
In this case, both you and your primary care partner leave the meeting after
the opening.
Getting everyone talking and committing
Open the meeting by stating that you fully intend to manage as much as you
can for as long as you can. But you do need their assistance (not control) and
patience to accept that tasks may take you longer and require more effort.
Distribute printed copies of the agenda that includes your list of tasks (see
the earlier section “Preparing the agenda” for ideas). Then excuse yourself
(see the previous section “Turning over the meeting”). Your care partner or
third party then facilitates the meeting as follows:
283
Chapter 19: When Care Partners Become Caregivers

1. Give everyone time to consider the list and their emotional commit-
ment (10 to 15 minutes should do).
Note: Don’t try to limit any part of this meeting to a specific schedule.
You want to make this meeting an open discussion, not one constrained
by time.
2. Ask everyone to mark tasks that they’ll consider taking on.
Explain that people won’t have to take on every task they mark. You’ll
use the results of this process to assign specific tasks, establish back-up
help for a task, and identify gaps that may need outside help.
3. Open the floor to questions, discussion, and additional suggestions for
the list.
4. Go through items one by one and identify coverage (or lack thereof).
5. Tally the cost of outside help for the apparent gaps. Ask family mem-
bers to indicate (in writing for your care partner’s eyes only) what
amounts they’re willing to contribute to that total each month.
6. Finally, adjourn the meeting with the assurance that you’ll plan a
follow-up meeting after you and your care partner have gone over the
information and made a tentative schedule.
After the meeting, you and your care partner can review the information and
get actual commitments for hands-on help and financial contributions.
Accepting aid with appreciation 
and gratitude
Now that you have the commitment of family members, you and your primary
care partner have an important task: You need to accept their willingness to
help by making specific assignments.
The division of contributions will not be equal or fair. Everyone needs to face
that fact from the outset. The physical and emotional toll for a family member
living nearby can be very different from a member who lives at some distance.
Similarly, one family member may not be able to accept that you need help
with such personal tasks as combing your hair, taking a shower, or going to
the bathroom.
You and your primary care partner must not pass judgment but must try to
find ways each personality can contribute. If hands-on care is beyond a
person’s capacity, assign them to outside tasks, such as home maintenance,
shopping, finances, taxes, and so on.
284
Part V: Coping with Advanced PD 

Some individuals are just naturally more nurturing. One of your adult chil-
dren or siblings may mark practically everything on the list. Resist the urge
to take him up on that. The last thing you need is for these secondary care-
givers to burn out when you need them most.
Teen-aged children, grandchildren, extended family members, close friends,
and other people may welcome the opportunity to help you and your care
partner in concrete ways. Don’t leave them out of the discussion, although
you may want to approach them separately. If so, do that shortly after the
meeting with adults in your family — perhaps that same afternoon.
You and your care partner probably have a realistic idea of the time and
effort each task takes (especially the ones involving personal, hands-on care).
You also understand the emotional toll of dealing with PD better than these
relative newbies. Keep all these concerns in mind as you consider who may
be the best provider for each task.
Whatever the contribution, as long as the provider gives it with love and the
best of intentions, accept it and say “Thank you.”
A Word for the PD Care Partner
You didn’t ask for this, but here you are. Now you need to find a way to
attend to the needs of the PWP in addition to other facets of your life. Many
of those facets may be (probably are) vital to the situation. For example, your
work may be the prime source of income these days. It also may provide the
insurance that both you and the PWP need.
Your health is also a factor. You can hardly manage the escalating tasks of a
caregiver if your own health is compromised. So, good eating habits, daily
physical exercise, and adequate rest are more than good ideas — they make
a huge difference in your overall ability to tackle this new challenge.
Get real about the time 
this is going to take
The Family Caregiver Alliance estimates that the average caregiver spends 18
to 20 hours each week giving care. One-fifth of family caregivers provide 40 or
more hours of care per week. Even if you don’t work outside the home or
work part-time, you have other facets of your life that need your attention.
You have you that needs and deserves your attention.
285
Chapter 19: When Care Partners Become Caregivers

You don’t have PD — your partner does. And you won’t have PD after your
partner moves beyond your ability to provide full-time, hands-on attention.
You’ll have a life — and we hope it’s still filled with the people and activities
that have sustained you since before PD became a part of it.
Consider the roles you play now: spouse or significant other, adult child,
parent, sibling, employee (or employer), homemaker, civic or community
leader (in your town, religious community, or such), volunteer. Add to these
official roles a list of the activities you enjoy, such as reading, biking, travel-
ing, gardening, and so on. Finally, add any additional hobbies you enjoy (and
don’t necessarily share with the PWP), such as needlework, photography,
sports, playing cards, and such.
Wow! When you write it all down, chances are good that you have a life that’s
pretty full. Add one more item: Besides the PWP, do you have other family
members, such as an aging parent or in-law, who will likely need your care
and support in the next few years?
The big question is: How are you going to fit caregiving into that busy life?
Put another way, what will you have to put aside or give up altogether to be
an effective caregiver over possibly several years?
Get creative about finding the time
Time management experts advise you to look at time as blocks. Start with your
five weekdays — that’s five 24-hour blocks. Block out the non-negotiables:
work (hours per day) and sleep (at least 7 hours a night). What’s left on a
normal weekday? Full-time work and sleep account for 15 hours, leaving 9
hours available. Okay, so far.
Now add time to get ready for work, travel to and from work, shopping and
errands, laundry and other housework, and meals. Whew! Chances are you
just knocked off another two hours a day and you still have to find time for
meal preparation, eating those meals, laundry and housework, checking up
on other family members, catching up with friends, making time for choir
practice or a workout — and oh yes, partnering in care. Where does the time
go? Better question: Where will the time come from?
America as a society has gotten very good at multi-tasking, and that practice
may save you time in a few places. For example, can you make phone calls
while preparing a meal or doing the laundry? Can you work part of your week
from home so you can do the actual job in the evening and open up the day for
something like a doctor’s appointment, grocery shopping, and that workout?
How about taking advantage of available community services such as adult
day care (see Chapter 21)? Can they provide the PWP some of the care you
currently give (such as a hot meal or hair care) in order to free up time for you?
286
Part V: Coping with Advanced PD 

The options are out there. You and the PWP just have to be willing to accept
the help and accept the fact that it may not be done your way or as well as
you do it. But if these options can give you back the time you’ve surrendered
to mundane tasks so you can once again enjoy a quiet evening of television or
visiting with friends, then they’re certainly worth considering.
Be prepared to delegate
The temptation in giving care is to simply do it yourself. Maybe it seems
faster and easier than trying to explain what you need. And maybe you get
energy from the praise and admiration you receive when you handle every-
thing on your own.
The world has its super-moms. Are you becoming super-caregiver, trapped
into believing (and convincing other people) that you and the PWP are man-
aging fine? Are you sending signals that these people can go about their lives
with no guilt or concern? Whoa!
In the early and mid-stages of PD, you and the PWP managed for some time
without relying on others. Then one day you realize that the PD, its physical
demands, and its mental and emotional demands are falling squarely on your
shoulders.
The point is:
 If you haven’t already opened the door (and your mind) to accept the
help of other people (see the previous section “Recruiting Secondary
Caregivers”), this is the moment.
 If you haven’t held a family meeting, do it now.
 If you’ve had the meeting, call the family together and let them know the
need for help and support has reached another level.
Review what else they can do and what they can add to their present
financial contributions.
In the process of taking on more care responsibilities, don’t make the mistake
of ignoring the PWP. Ask yourself these questions:
 Are you (or others) assuming that the PWP can’t perform tasks or make
decisions that are in fact still possible?
 Are you making sure that the PWP is still part of the discussion and deci-
sion-making?
 Are you keeping in mind that, for your loved one, this is another loss in
the battle to maintain autonomy and independence?
287
Chapter 19: When Care Partners Become Caregivers

This isn’t about you. Presumably you have years ahead of you, but your PWP
faces a progressive decline. And you still have choices that the PWP no longer
has. On the other hand, no one expects you to martyr yourself in the cause of
giving care. That’s where respite comes in — for you and your loved one. If
you haven’t read it yet, be sure you check out the earlier section “Dealing
with burnout” for specifics on healthy respites.

Part V: Coping with Advanced PD 
Bill of Rights for the PD care partner
As the care partner for someone with PD, you
perform an incredibly valuable and loving serv-
ice. Anyone willing to put his life on hold in order
to make the life of another better deserves the
respect and appreciation of everyone involved.
Just in case you have days when you feel as if
that respect is not forthcoming (and you will
have such days), make a copy of the following
Bill of Rights for care partners, carry it with you,
and take it out now and then to read through.
I have the right
 To take proper care of myself because
doing so will make me a better care partner
for the PWP
 To seek the help and support of others and
to have the PWP accept that such support
is necessary
 To maintain certain facets of my life beyond
the PWP, just as I would have if that person
didn’t have PD
 To occasionally (and humanely) express
anger, sadness, and other difficult feelings
 To reject any attempt by others (including
the PWP) to manipulate me (either con-
sciously or unconsciously) through guilt
 To receive respect, appreciation, and accep-
tance for the support and care I provide,
knowing that I am giving it my best possible
effort
 To take pride in my efforts and to recognize
the courage and sacrifice required to pro-
vide that support and care
 To protect my individuality and my right to
make a life for myself beyond the support
and care the PWP needs
 To expect and demand that, even as new
strides are made toward the treatment and
cure of PD, similar strides be made toward
aiding and caring for those of us who part-
ner in care

M
anaging long-term illnesses like Parkinson’s disease (PD) has more
than a physical, mental, and spiritual price tag. The financial cost is
also significant. And closely related to financial considerations are the legal
issues that need your attention throughout the journey.
As with the rest of this book, in this chapter we preach planning and prepara-
tion. Chances are good that before receiving the PD diagnosis, you had made
financial plans for your future, so you already have a lot in place. If not, you
need to attend to these matters sooner rather than later because PD can pro-
gressively affect your capacity for decision-making. The information in this
chapter gets you through the financial and legal red tape of protecting your
assets and the futures of loved ones.
Gathering Important Information
The first step in managing your financial and legal affairs is to gather all the
information and documents in one place. Some people are already terrifically
organized; they can put their hands on key documents from three years ago
in a flash. But a lot of people don’t do as well. Some of these folks think noth-
ing of showing up at the tax auditor’s office with shoeboxes stuffed with
receipts, cancelled checks, and handwritten notes; they dump it all on the
poor auditor’s desk and then assume that the auditor can make sense of it.

Whichever group you fall into, set aside some time, get a notebook and pen
(or work off your computer if that’s preferable), and find a place to work on
this important piece of preserving your security.
Inventorying legal and 
financial documents
You need a clear inventory of key identity information, like Social Security
number, insurance numbers, bank account numbers, and so on. Also, if
you’ve appointed a power of attorney for legal or health matters, that docu-
ment (and copies of it) must be readily available. Your health history is also a
vital piece of this inventory. In fact, everything that may be needed — when
you’re unable to provide it or give its location — needs to be a part of this
inventory.
Prepare a document in your computer files or make a list in a notebook with
the following information. Then carefully store this information where it’s
secure from theft or fire (such as in a home safe) and be sure your care part-
ner and others you trust can readily access it.
 Access to personal information: For each of the following include pin
number and password clue (or actual password); contact name and
phone number for technical support; online addresses as appropriate:
• E-mail account
• Voicemail
• Personal and business Web sites

tronic transfer accounts [ETA], or bills paid automatically or
online)
 Personal documents: Record the location of each of the following:
• Medical history and records
• Family history
• Birth certificate

documents — especially if you pre-pay)
• Name of your favorite charity (for donations in lieu of flowers)
 Information for dependents: List their names, birth dates, and contact
information.
 Inventories: List all of the following items. In addition to this list, con-
sider taking photos of the items. Store the list and photos in an online
file and keep a copy in your safe deposit box. For especially valuable
items, get appraisals and keep the appraisals with a photo of the item in
your safe deposit box.
• Home inventory including fixtures, furnishings, appliances, equip-
ment, and so on
• Personal valuables including jewelry, artwork, antiques, books,
clothes, mementos, and so on
• Business inventory including fixtures, furniture, stock, and so on
 Personal bank and credit union accounts: For each of the following
entries include name of company or institution; contact name and phone
number; account or file identity number(s); name(s) on the account and
location of documents.

inventories (see these categories earlier in this list)
• Appraisals and photos of especially valuable items
• Original documents and files
• Original Social Security card
• A copy of your driver’s license
• A copy of your health insurance and Medicare cards
• A copy of other insurance (life, disability, long-term care, home-
owner’s, renter’s, business, liability, valuables, and so on)
 Miscellaneous: Record the location of each of the following:
• Storage units’ contracts (including location of unit; name and phone
number of company; unit number; location of key or combination)
• Home and business safe (including key or combination)

Part V: Coping with Advanced PD 

Getting the info into the right hands
You aren’t finished yet. In addition to completing the inventory, you need to
tie up these other loose strings:
 Make sure your care partner and other trusted family or friends are
aware of this inventory and how to access it.
 Place all of the documents and files in a safe deposit box (keeping a
copy at home) or in a fireproof file container at home.
 Be sure someone other than you and your care partner knows where you
store the documents and files. As an alternative, file a copy of key docu-
ments with your physician, attorney, or financial advisor as appropriate.
 Make sure that your care partner and one other trusted family member
or friend has copies of your medical information (your Social Security
number, insurance cards, list of medications, and so on).
 Be sure that your checking and savings accounts are accessible (if you’re
incapacitated) by putting your care partner’s name on the accounts.
 Be sure your safe deposit box is accessible by putting your care part-
ner’s name on the account (especially if you’re going to store key docu-
ments like your will or living will or the originals of your power of
attorney documents there).
 Make sure you give your doctor(s) copies of any advanced directives
(like Do Not Resuscitate [DNR] orders); also, have a copy available to
hand to the admissions representative any time you check in to the hos-
pital or the emergency room.
 Give your doctor(s) written permission to discuss your health with your
care partner.
Assessing Your Financial Health
Your ability to orchestrate your healthcare and solid financial future for you
and your family is tied to your ability to understand the complexities of
healthcare in America today. In many cases, the decisions that insurance
companies and government programs make are based on generalizations, not
your specific situation.
So, getting a handle on your specific economic well-being is a wise move. The
information you put together in the following sections can provide a better
293
Chapter 20: Putting Your Financial and Legal House in Order

idea of your financial health at this stage of your life, and this understanding
can help you and your care partner make the best decisions to protect your
futures.
Tracking income and out-go
In addition to an inventory, you need a clear idea of your resources versus
your expenses. In your notebook or on your computer, set up a table with two
columns, one titled Resources and the other Expenses. The information you
enter under each column is pretty self-explanatory. Under Resources, list:
 Cash on hand (in checking and savings accounts as well as literal cash
on hand)
 Annual income (from salary, trusts, royalties, dividends, property rental,
and so on)
 Pay-outs due you (from pensions, investments, and so on)
 Property value (home, car, antiques, jewelry, land, and so on)
For Expenses, enter annual data for:
 Standard household expenses (food, utilities, rent or mortgage, insur-
ance payments, payments on loans, and so on)
 Medical expenses (doctor visits, medications, medical equipment, ther-
apy sessions, and so on)
 Occasional but regular expenses (clothing, household items, service for
the car, and such)
Projecting costs over the long term
You have a condition that is progressive and will change over time. Predicting
how that will translate into dollars and cents is difficult, to say the least. But
you do know that costs will increase as your income decreases. What to do?
Yep, you need to make another list. So get out your trusty notebook or open a
file on your computer and enter your best estimates for the following addi-
tional expenses you can anticipate as your PD progresses. Estimate the cost
per month for each item.
 Lost wages
 Lost benefits
 House changes or remodeling
294
Part V: Coping with Advanced PD 

 Transportation expenses
 Medical expenses
• Medications
• In-home assistance (aides)
• Medical equipment (walker, wheelchair, hospital bed)
• Therapy not covered by insurance (physical, occupational,
speech)
• Medical bills not covered by insurance
 Respite costs (for you and your care partner)
• Day care
• Vacation care
• Weekly in-home relief
• Counseling
Using your assets to cover 
medical expenses
A home or other real estate can be a financial asset to cover the escalating
costs of medical care. If you’re still making payments on your home, you may
be able to get a second or a refinanced mortgage. If you own your home out-
right, a reverse mortgage may be an option.
With a reverse mortgage, you receive monthly payments from a lender (usu-
ally the bank) while you continue to own and live in the property. The
amount of cash you receive is based on your equity in the home, your age,
current interest rates, the value of the property, and its location. You can
receive payments in one of three ways:
 Term plan: Fixed monthly payments over a specific time period
 Tenure plan: Fixed monthly payments for as long as you continue to live
in the house
 Line-of-credit plan: Cash advance withdrawals from a fixed total sum
Eligibility requirements for a reverse mortgage don’t include income limits but
 You must be at least age 62.
 You must own the home outright.
 The home must be your principal residence based on voter registration
information.
295
Chapter 20: Putting Your Financial and Legal House in Order

Do reverse mortgages have a downside? Yep. Two of the significant downers
are the following:
 Up-front fees can be steep for insuring and administering the reverse
mortgage.
 If you choose to use part of your cash advances from the reverse mort-
gage to pay those fees, those sums plus interest are added to the bottom
line of those fees.
How do you repay the loan? After the borrower moves out of the home or
dies, the home can be sold to repay the loan, or family members can retain
the home and repay the loan in other ways.
The good news? The total of the reverse mortgage loan can never be greater
than the value of the home at the time the loan is repaid, even if the loan bal-
ance is greater than the home’s value at that time.
Deciding to take a second or reverse mortgage isn’t as simple as it may
appear. Before you take such a step, engage the services of a professional
counselor (such as your financial planner, your attorney, the bank’s reverse
loan officer, or all three).
For more information, check out the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) Web site at www.hud.gov.
Understanding the Intricacies 
of Insurance
With the seemingly gazillion insurance products on the market, figuring out
which product best meets your needs can be a full-time job. For people diag-
nosed with young onset PD (YOPD) or people with PD (PWP) who are still
working and receiving employee benefits, check out the section on insurance
in Chapter 8.
Before choosing an insurance policy of any type, go online to www.ambest.
com, the Web site of A.M. Best, a company that rates insurance companies.
You want to see a rating of at least A+, preferably A++. A high rating assures
you that this company is financially stable and likely to be around when you
actually need the benefits.
296
Part V: Coping with Advanced PD 

You also want to check whether the company has raised premiums on exist-
ing policies. When an insurance company’s management has to make this
move, one or two reasons are behind the raise:
 They didn’t do their homework before setting the premium.
 They’re planning to raise rates on a regular basis; unfortunately, just
when a person needs the benefits, he drops the policy because he can’t
afford the high premiums any longer.
For most people 60 years and over, the insurance game is a little more
straightforward. Although you may have trouble taking out certain types of
insurance because of your PD, other options exist. For example, if you’re a
veteran, you may qualify for veterans’ benefits that include insurance. Or
your state may offer a special state health insurance plan to cover people
with pre-existing conditions that aren’t covered by other insurers.
Whatever your options, your goal is pretty clear: You want to work with your
insurance advisor to protect you and your family against the ravages of long-
term illness on your financial security.
Qualifying for federally funded programs
This is the good news: Federally funded healthcare programs provide health
insurance for some Americans; Medicare and its sister program, Medicaid,
are the two most prominent. But as the section below explains, all federally
funded programs aren’t created equal, and although they’re certainly a big
help, they’re simply not going to pay all your healthcare costs.
Be sure your doctors accept Medicare — not every doctor does.
Medicare
Medicare is a federally funded and administered national health insurance
program available to any American citizen who is age 65 and older or who is
eligible for Social Security disability benefits. Enrollment is automatic regard-
less of health, income, or political persuasion.
But all is not rosy. The original Medicare program was designed in 1965, when
the goal was to provide financial help for seniors due to the rising costs of
acute (immediate) care. In other words, the program was intended to help
pay for care following a catastrophic event such as a heart attack, a fall that
297
Chapter 20: Putting Your Financial and Legal House in Order

results in a hip fracture, and so on. Unfortunately, the program can be confus-
ing in terms of what it covers and what it doesn’t cover. (See the sidebar,
“Medicare: A primer.”)
The Medicare program works on a system of assignment, which means the
government assigns the number of days you can be hospitalized and the pay-
ment levels for each service. So, if your final hospitalization bill reads
$75,247.63 and Medicare has assigned only $50,000 to the procedure, a
$25,247.63 shortfall exists. Whoa! What happens then? (See “Medigap” in this
section for more info on this equation.)
For more information on Medicare coverage, you can call 800-MEDICARE
(800-633-4227) or go to www.medicare.gov and request publication #CMS-
10050-28, the annual update on Medicare programs and coverage.
Medigap
Medigap is the slang expression for Medicare supplemental insurance poli-
cies. You need one of these policies if you’re receiving Medicare benefits
because — drum roll, please — a gap (sometimes a cavern) exists between
the cost of medical care and Medicare’s payments. A gap also exists between
the services Medicare covers and the services you need.
As a minimum, you need a Medigap policy to cover the 20 percent remainder
of charges that Medicare covers at 80 percent. But beyond that, look for a
policy that covers what Medicare doesn’t cover at all:
 Hospitalization expenses for a year or more past the Medicare allowance
 Coverage for most excess charges not covered by Medicare (such as
doctor bills beyond allowable fees)
 Coverage for care received outside the United States or Canada
Fortunately, several policies are available, and these companies must accept
anyone who’s eligible for Medicare. The concept of pre-existing condition is
not part of their vocabulary and you have no wait period. For more informa-
tion on selecting a policy, call 800-MEDICARE (800-633-4227) and ask for CMS
publication #02110, “Choosing a Medigap Policy.”
Medicaid
Medicaid is another federal healthcare program with a twist. Although the
funding comes from the federal government, each state runs its own pro-
grams. And the rules can vary wildly. However, all programs base eligibility
on income, and that amount is very close to the federally determined poverty
level. Income is the only factor in Medicaid; age doesn’t affect eligibility.
When you’re at a certain level of income (and remain there), Medicaid covers
care costs for the rest of your life. What’s the catch? Most states get to decide
where, when, and from whom you receive that care.
298
Part V: Coping with Advanced PD 

For more information about your state’s requirements for Medicaid eligibility,
contact your state Office on Aging.
Looking into long-term care insurance —
Not just for old folks
We hope you’ve already looked into a long-term care (LTC) policy well before
being diagnosed with PD (either because you’re reaching the age where
people consider such issues or because your employer offers a plan). In
some cases, pre-existing conditions (such as PD) can disqualify you automati-
cally (or seriously limit your options). If it’s too late for you, definitely look
into a long-term care policy for your care partner because it may have sec-
ondary benefits that help you if your partner becomes unable to provide the
care you need.
Although many people can benefit from LTC coverage, two instances where
LTC insurance isn’t essential are:
 When your income is low (or you’re willing to spend down your assets
as discussed in the earlier section “Medicaid”)
 When you will likely qualify for Medicaid
At the other end of the spectrum, perhaps you’re in the Fortune 400 crowd of
multimillionaires, in which case your assets are such that you can afford to
cover the costs of your care without seriously impacting your lifestyle. Just
remember: Some estimates place annual costs of managing healthcare with a
chronic progressive condition between $65,000 and $100,000. Did you catch
that? That’s the per-year cost. If your assets need to stretch to cover 10, 15,
or 20 years, you do the math.
Using private health insurance, disability
benefits, HIPAA, and COBRA
For many people, health insurance is a benefit offered by their employer, but
too many people fail to examine the actual benefits of their coverage until
they need it. Don’t make that mistake. Take a look at your current coverage
and identify where it may be leaving you exposed. For example, does it
include coverage for medications? If not, is there a rider or supplemental
policy you can add to help cover those costs? Review the following discus-
sion of health insurance basics; then you (or your partner if she has the
policy) may want to sit down with someone in Human Resources and review
the gaps in your coverage.
299
Chapter 20: Putting Your Financial and Legal House in Order

 Private health insurance comes in two forms:
• Individual policies that you purchase on your own give you choices
and coverage that last until age 65. These policies can’t be can-
celled, and premiums can’t increase on the basis of your health
condition.
Coverage can be expensive, and at the outset, you can be turned
down or denied coverage for treatment for PD or other pre-existing
conditions.
• Group policies are funded at least in part through your employer.
You may have little or no choice on features, but the coverage is
usually available with no penalties for pre-existing conditions when
you start a job.
 Long- and short-term disability coverage is available through many
employers or as an individual product. The ground rules are essentially
the same as for health coverage:
• For individual policies, you need to be in good health when you
apply.
• The group policy may require a period of employment (typically 6
to 12 months) and a waiting period of several months during which
the employee has not sought treatment for the condition before
being eligible for disability benefits.
Benefits are based on a percentage of base salary, but that salary is
still taxable. No adjustments are available for inflation or cost-of-
living increases. For more information on disability benefits, see
Chapter 8.
 HIPAA is a government acronym for the Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act, a relatively new program designed to protect
working people.
In a nutshell, HIPAA requires states to make all health insurance
portable. This means that if you leave one job for another or to start
your own business, you can’t be denied coverage regardless of health as
long as you’re under age 65. Each state decides which carrier provides
this portable product, but you can’t be denied coverage. For a fact sheet
on HIPAA check out www.dol.gov/ebsa/newsroom/fshipaa.html.
 COBRA, another federal government alphabet-soup acronym, stands for
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act. This program pro-
tects and benefits the employee, giving you the option to continue your
employer’s group insurance for up to 18 months at your expense after
leaving your job.
This option guarantees that your coverage isn’t interrupted. You pay the
group rate (including what your employer was contributing on your
behalf), which is usually far less expensive than the same coverage in an
individual policy (if you can even get an individual policy).
300
Part V: Coping with Advanced PD 

Relying on other resources to pay for care
As the government continues to wrestle with the issue of affordable health
insurance, Congress and many states continue to enact legislation that par-
tially addresses the problem.
For example, a growing number of states have established health insurance
co-ops or pools for people who are denied coverage (usually due to a pre-
existing condition). Note: Such programs usually have a residency require-
ment, and the cost of coverage runs higher than similar coverage if you were
completely healthy. To find out whether your state offers such a program,
contact your State Insurance Department.
301
Chapter 20: Putting Your Financial and Legal House in Order
Check that medical bill before you pay up
How many times have you gotten a statement
from your insurance provider that shows the
name of a doctor you never saw or heard of?
How many times has payment by your insurer
been denied because the billed service dupli-
cates coverage already paid? How many times
have you called the hospital or lab and been told
the strange doctor was the one who read the
results? Since when is reading the results not
part of the lab work? Your insurance carrier is
likely to catch such double-billing practices and
decline to pay. Not to worry. The purpose is to
try and get a higher insurance payment. If that’s
declined, the provider usually drops the matter
rather than bill you out-of-pocket.
According to Medical Billing Advocates of
America (an advocacy organization), every hos-
pital Web site and lobby proudly posts a list of
patient rights. Included in that list is the right to
request an itemized statement or explanation of
items on your bill that you don’t understand or
believe you didn’t receive. Unfortunately most
patients never take advantage of this right, so
medical billing errors go undetected. Either the
insurance company pays them (adding to the
spiraling costs of health care across America)
or the patient pays.
An itemized bill may be overwhelming at first
(some can run on for 20 to 30 pages), but every
time you catch an error, you put the billing office
and the insurance company on notice. For
example:
 Administration of oxygen may be a common
protocol for the procedure you had, but if
you didn’t need or didn’t received that
oxygen, you shouldn’t pay for it.
 Maybe your doctor ordered a pain medicine
on an as-needed (or as-requested) basis.
You know you never requested that medi-
cine, yet it’s on the bill.
 A scan through an itemized bill may reveal
outlandish charges such as $10 for a cotton
swab. Go to the discount store and buy a
package of a thousand swabs for a couple
of bucks. Take them with you when you go
to question the bill. It’ll make your point.
Managing your medical costs is one way you
can maintain control as your PD progresses.
Requesting an itemized statement and ques-
tioning services you didn’t receive or were 
overcharged for delivers the message loud 
and clear: You may have PD, but you’re still 
in charge. By the way, the billing office isn’t
allowed to charge you for making a copy of 
the bill even if it runs into a couple hundred 
of pages.

In 2004, Congress created Health Savings Accounts (HSA) for people who 
purchase a government-approved, high-deductible health plan (HDHP). The
buyer pre-funds a substantial percentage of the deductible each year in a tax-
deductible savings account similar to an IRA. Funds deposited in the account
can be used to
 Pay the deductible
 Cover the costs of medical and dental services not covered under your
policy including alternative medical treatment
Any part of the deposit not used in a given year carries forward. As your PD
progresses, you’re likely to meet or exceed the deductible in any given year,
but this plan may be an option for your care partner.

Making Sure Your Wishes Are Sacrosanct
One key to good long-term-planning is to put certain documents in place well
before you or your care partner needs to access them. These documents
include:
 A will, of course
 Trusts in your children’s names if you have children to protect
 A durable power of attorney for finances and healthcare if your state has
provisions for them
 Your end-of-life wishes
 Advance directives (make sure you’ve shared those wishes in writing
with your doctor[s] and your family)
Durable power of attorney
Appointing someone to act on your behalf is the purpose of a power of attor-
ney or simple POA. The standard document allows you to assign someone the
right to manage financial and personal matters for you. The catch is that this
person’s appointment only lasts as long as you remain capable of making
those decisions yourself.
302
Part V: Coping with Advanced PD 

For the time when you can’t make decisions known, you still need a
spokesperson you can trust to move forward as you want. At this point, the
durable POA comes into play. Two types exist:
 Durable power of attorney: You appoint someone to speak on your
behalf for financial and other non-healthcare matters when you no
longer can.
 Durable power of attorney for healthcare: You appoint someone to
make medical and healthcare decisions for you when you’re unable to
make them yourself.
Not all states recognize the same documents. Check with your attorney to
understand your state’s laws on these issues. If these documents are avail-
able, don’t put off officially naming your non-healthcare and healthcare 
representative.
Whether you’re living with PD or you’re perfectly health, stuff happens and
none of us can guarantee that we won’t end up unconscious in an emergency
room, unable to make our wishes known.
Advance directives and living wills
The trend in medical care today has moved away from the paternalistic
model where the doctor made decisions for the patient. Today the patient
has the autonomy to state medical and end-of-life choices and to expect that
those choices will be honored. But what happens when you can’t speak up
for yourself?
Give advance consent to all your doctors as well as your lawyer to talk with
your care partner as needed. The rules and forms for doing this will vary
from one state to another, so ask your lawyer to make sure this consent is a
part of your legal portfolio.
Advance directives and living wills are tools for stating your desires regard-
ing decisions the doctors and your family are facing when you’re unable to
participate in the decision. This concept has dual benefits:
 You take the pressure off your doctors and family members from making
emotional and tough decisions when they’re under enormous stress.
 You can make your exact choices clear in a legally binding document.
For example, the choice of terminal sedation is legal in most states. Terminal
sedation isn’t considered assisted suicide or euthanasia because the goal is
303
Chapter 20: Putting Your Financial and Legal House in Order

to ease suffering, not to induce death. You (or your healthcare power of attor-
ney) can ask the doctor to order medication at the end of your life to ease
pain or difficult breathing.
Another specific to consider is whether you want an autopsy that can help
researchers understand more how PD affects the brain. If terminal sedation,
autopsy, or a procedure equally specific is part of your decision, you need to
state this in your living will and make sure that a copy is on file with each
doctor likely to treat you.
Last will and testament
A will states your choices regarding the distribution of your property and
mementos after you die. This is a legal document, and although you may
believe writing down your wishes (or telling them to your care partner) is
enough, you can save everyone headaches (and probably a good measure of
trauma) after you’re gone if you take the time to create a legally witnessed
and signed document that makes your wishes binding for your survivors. To
help you in that, the Funeral Consumers Alliance offers a packet of materials
entitled Before I Go, You Should Know available through their Web site at
www.funerals.org.
Tough stuff, but even the healthiest of people need to address these seem-
ingly gloomy issues. Getting on top of them early on is just one more way you
can take control and move forward with your life — on your terms.

n times of personal crisis, home often becomes a synonym for refuge or
safe harbor. It’s the one place most people can go and be themselves with-
out feeling the need to keep up appearances or a brave front. It’s also the
place where people surround themselves with items that bring back memo-
ries of good times, successes, and even trials endured through the years.
The day will come when you and your care partner need to reassess your
current living situation in terms of its safety and practicality. As time and
your Parkinson’s disease (PD) progress, you may develop balance problems
that result in falls and fractures. In many cases, you can make adjustments to
your present home that allow you to remain there in comfort. However, you
may eventually need to choose between a building that represents your past
and a place where you have the assistance you need for a productive and sat-
isfying future.
And in the spirit of our mantra — prepare, don’t project — you can get to
work on these housing issues well before the need is imminent. This chapter
helps you do just that. We first guide you through the safety issues of your
present home and cover the community services that enable you to remain
there. Then we take you through the tough steps of deciding to move. Finally
the chapter breaks down the variety of residences you can choose from when
you’ve decided the time is right.

306
Part V: Coping with Advanced PD 
Making Your Home PD User-Friendly
Your first step in thinking through this whole nest quest is to take a good look
at your current residence. You may be surprised to discover how even small
changes can give you additional months, if not years, to enjoy your current
home.
Safety first: Assessing your home
Accidents in the home are one of the most common causes of injury and
death in America. With your PD and the meds that can make you more prone
to falling (see Chapter 18 for more on this), a check of your home is impera-
tive. You may want to schedule one as often as you check the batteries in
your smoke detectors — which is at least once a year, right?
Your local fire or police department may offer a home safety assessment at
no cost. If so, take advantage of this great community service. There are also
home safety assessments offered by trained nurses, and this service is usu-
ally covered by Medicare and some insurance companies. If neither of those
professional surveys is available for you, you can also go through the follow-
ing checklist to get started on your own home safety assessment:
 Oh say, can you see?
• Make sure lighting is adequate both inside and outside the home.
• Pay special attention to lighting in stairways and hallways.
• Place nightlights in the bathroom and along the path from bed-
room to bathroom.
• Check lamps and electrical appliances. Do the cords and wiring
show wear and need for repairs?
• Avoid using extension cords if at all possible; when they’re
absolutely necessary, anchor them to the wall (not the floor) to
prevent tripping.
• Bundle and tie up excess footage on computer and other electron-
ics cords; then anchor them safely under the desk or along the
baseboard.
 Underfoot stuff can be dangerous!
• Get rid of all scatter rugs (even those with rubber backing) and
carefully check for worn carpeting or edges that are coming free of
their tacking; make necessary repairs.
• Make sure floors (tiled, wood, or uncarpeted flooring) aren’t slippery.

Test floors in a pair of socks. If you can do the slide, the floors
need to be stripped of the wax or compound that’s making them
slippery.
• Remove any raised threshold strip that separates one room from
another; make the transition smooth.
• Install nonskid runners on uncarpeted stairways. Each stairway
needs a sturdy handrail on at least one side and light controls at
the top and bottom of the stairway. Use bright neon tape to mark
stairs in especially dark places.
• Shop for shoes with nonskid soles and no laces, the kind boaters
prefer.
 Two key spaces are accidents waiting to happen.
• In the kitchen: Standard safety rules apply. Keep curtains or flam-
mable materials away from the stove and make sure all appliances
are in good working order. Assess whether items in the kitchen are
convenient for you. For example, are glasses better on a lower
shelf? Can you move the skillet from the drawer under the oven to
a hook or a higher cabinet?
• In the bathroom: Place nonskid strips in the bathtub and shower;
install grab bars wherever they make life easier — bathtub,
shower, and toilet. Set the hot water heater at 110 degrees or lower
to prevent accidental burning.
 Don’t forget:
• Place emergency and other medical contact numbers next to every
phone.
• Install smoke detectors (or check present ones) in every stairway
and in the kitchen; place fire extinguishers in an accessible place
on every floor level including the basement; determine an escape
route in the event of fire.
• Check for needed repairs to sidewalks and driveways: broken
asphalt or concrete, uneven brickwork in paths and sidewalks, and
so on. Consider installing ramps for the time when managing even
a few stairs becomes difficult.
• Double-check your house’s security. Are all locks on windows and
doors working properly? Be sure screens, storm windows, and doors
are properly and securely installed. Get to know your neighbors and
let one or two trusted neighbors know who to contact if they have
concerns about your safety or the security of the property.
307
Chapter 21: It's Just Bricks and Mortar: Housing Options You Can Live With

Got your to-do list ready? Great. Time to get busy!
If possible, make this a family project. List everything that needs attention
and then subdivide that list into large and small jobs. Tackle any fairly exten-
sive changes for improving movement (such as removing threshold strips)
first. Such structural barriers — usually in multiple places in your home —
may put you in the greatest danger for falling.
De-cluttering and hazard-proofing
Take a good, long look at the contents of your residence. Address the clutter
that may be hazardous and clean out unnecessary stuff. For example, does
your son still play that drum set, or could it be moved into the attic or better
yet sent to his house for the grandkids to use?
Rearranging to go with the (traffic) flow
You’ve de-cluttered your living space, so now you’re ready to consider reposi-
tioning your furnishings. You want to create the best traffic flow, meet your
needs for comfort, and still have some design appeal. (Wedging your televi-
sion in the far corner may offer more space, but not a whole lot more!)
Some people seem to have an eye for positioning furnishings for maximum
convenience and visual appeal. The rest of the world needs help — a decorator,
a particular family member, a friend, or a friend of a friend who has a real
knack.
But you can do a little preliminary evaluating on your own. What suggestions
can you incorporate from your assessment (see the previous section, “Safety
first: Assessing your home”) and from the safety check by the police or fire
department? For example, would a simple change in the placement of the sofa
make it easier to access the doorway in the event of a fire or other emergency?
How can you put the rooms of your home to better use — not just because
you have PD but because they may serve everyone better? Forget those room
labels and think outside the box. If you’re going to be spending more time on
the computer — checking out information and staying in touch with —
maybe that little-used guest room could become your headquarters. Even if
you didn’t have PD, chances are the rooms of your home could be far more
user-friendly for the real life you lead. Besides, change and playing around
with new ideas can be fun!
308
Part V: Coping with Advanced PD 

Taking Advantage of Community 
Care Programs
If you choose to remain in your own home for as long as possible, you have
some options for extending that timetable even after your PD begins to put
you at risk for falls or other traumas. But staying at home and bringing in
care services has financial considerations. Most services — even if your
insurance or Medicare covers part of them — are for a limited period of time
and focus on a higher level of care, such as the services of a nurse or physi-
cal therapist. The following sections help you weigh your options.
In-home services
In-home help may be your first line of defense against moving because it can
provide two significant services:
 Household help, such as meal preparation, shopping, and home 
maintenance
 Personal and medical assistance, such as help with personal hygiene,
dressing, or medications
Most large communities have agencies that offer in-home care-assessment
services at no cost. They can suggest support options for you and your care
partner. Smaller communities or rural areas likely have a well-known network
of independent contractors — people experienced in offering the elementary
services you may need at some stage of your PD.
To find independent contractors and community services, consider the fol-
lowing strategies:
 Talk to neighbors, friends, and the nurse or office manager in your physi-
cian’s office for references.
 Check with your local librarian or search your telephone directory’s
business listings for agencies offering services.
 Call the local hospital’s social services department or your regional Office
on Aging (in the phone book under state or county government offices).
 Use a computer to check out several sites that may be helpful such as
www.eldercare.gov. Search the Internet using key words like home
care and your community’s name.
Expand your search to the county level and surrounding communities if
you live in a smaller community.
309
Chapter 21: It's Just Bricks and Mortar: Housing Options You Can Live With

Even if these people can’t offer the answers you need, don’t stop there. Ask
them for other people to contact. Thank them for their help and follow their
suggestions for that next contact.
Consider exploring the types of services in Table 21-1 for your area and file
the information for when you may need it down the road.

seniors can provide not only a hot, nutritious meal but also the opportunity
to get out and interact socially with other people.
310
Part V: Coping with Advanced PD 

On the other hand, some services may come with sticker shock that has you
reeling and saying, “Are you kidding? I’ll do it myself,” or “If I can’t, my care
partner will!” But take care not to burn those bridges too quickly. What hap-
pens when you can’t manage some tasks on your own? What happens when
your care partner is ill, needs to go away, or has to work overtime and can’t
be there when you need the help? What about your escalating need for care?
Are you really prepared to ask your care partner to assume all the household
and personal care tasks that the two of you may have shared up to now?
Don’t be stubborn about accepting care from other people — even when you
have to pay for it. If the service provides help for you and extra time for your
enjoyable activities (not to mention independence!), it may seem downright
priceless.
Home healthcare services
Home healthcare is a higher level of medical assistance that isn’t part of the
normal services offered through either your doctor’s office or the hospital. At
the same time it includes services that your doctor or the hospital’s social
worker and discharge planner might prescribe for you (such as a visiting
nurse to come to your home and check up on you after you’ve had a fall).
The good news: If your physician orders or prescribes professional in-home
care, your insurance or Medicare pays most, if not all, of the bill. After the
professional (a nurse or physical therapist, for example) is approved, you
may also become eligible for personal-hygiene care and housekeeping serv-
ices you’ve needed.
The not-so-great news: Such home health-services are finite — they continue
for as long as medically necessary. After the need for professional service is
over, the personal care also ends. Likewise, when you can reasonably travel
to the site of the professional services (like physical therapy), the home
delivery ends.
The most common situation for home healthcare is following a hospitaliza-
tion, often because of a fall that causes a hip fracture or other broken bones.
Check out Chapter 6 for a full discussion on what to expect (and do) if you’ve
been discharged from the hospital and still need extra care. Such services —
whether they follow a hospitalization or another scenario — are finite and
short-term, but they are available. Note: The downside is that you have to
demonstrate your knowledge of them and then ask for them.
311
Chapter 21: It's Just Bricks and Mortar: Housing Options You Can Live With

Adult day care
Adult day care is relatively new in the United States and therefore not as geo-
graphically widespread as the need is. Day care programs for adults can offer
an array of services in a variety of settings — from community rooms in reli-
gious or senior centers to free-standing facilities.
In most cases, day care programs focus on socialization rather than health-
care services. Still, they offer more health support than traditional senior
centers because day care programs have staff trained to provide nursing
assistance and routine medical support (such as overseeing medication
dosages, assistance with transferring from one position to another, and, in
some instances, personal care services such as bathing and barber or beauti-
cian services).
Day care can bridge an important gap in the continuum of care services.
When your PD symptoms keep you from safely getting out and about on your
own or when your care partner needs to work, day care offers an opportunity
for you to be with other people and remain active.
Keep the following facts in mind:
 Not all states license or certify day care centers for adults. This means
safety, cleanliness, and regular reviews of staffing and program stan-
dards aren’t regulated.
 Because programs can vary greatly, be sure you understand what services
are included in the fee and what services you pay for on an as-needed
basis.
 Some centers may offer a free trial day; if they don’t, then visit the
center (if possible, more than once) before making your decision.
Adult day care isn’t for everyone and may not be right for you if you’re still
an active participant in other social and community circles. But it’s an option
to consider as your PD progresses. Adult day care can lengthen the time
you’re able to remain in your own home, and it can provide occasional
respite for your care partner.
Respite care
The concept of respite isn’t just for your care partner. (Review Chapter 19 for
this discussion.) When you have a chronic, progressive condition like PD, you
too need time off. Trying to keep up that brave and optimistic demeanor can
be enormously exhausting. Managing symptoms and fighting for every bit of
function and independence can sap the energy of even the strongest PWP.
312
Part V: Coping with Advanced PD 

You deserve a break — a regular timeout from thinking about PD at least once
a week. (Although we cover this more completely in Chapter 19, the routine’s
important enough to reinforce here.) You also need (and deserve) the occa-
sional longer R&R to
 Take a deep breath and be cared for without feeling as if you’re imposing
on your family or under their watchful eye
 Come to terms with the progression of your PD
Believe it or not, such places exist. In the early stages of your PD when your
symptoms are well managed by your treatment plan, consider traveling to:
 A retreat center that offers rejuvenation, often at a reasonable cost.
 A cabin or lodge in a state park where you can spend a few days or a
week for a reasonable cost in settings that inspire introspection.
 A major city if you really can’t deal with all that quiet time. Treat your-
self to a stay in a hotel, tickets to a play or sporting event, shopping,
dining (as opposed to simply eating), and letting strangers pamper you.
As your PD progresses, options for respite are available in an environment of
safety and care appropriate to your needs. For example,
 Adult day care programs (see the earlier section “Adult day care”) can
give you and your care partner a few hours of respite.
 Hospitals, step-care communities (see the section “Communities of care”
later in this chapter), rehabilitation centers, and dedicated Parkinson’s
centers on medical-center campuses may offer overnight, weekend, or
vacation respite care.
Even if you’re not ready to make use of such programs right now, gather
information about the ones in your area. You may find that such a service is
handy when an emergency arises (such as your care partner’s mother needs
help in another state) and your care partner worries about leaving you.
Deciding When It’s Time to Move
One day in the future, your current residence may simply not work for you.
(Frankly that day comes for a lot of folks who aren’t even dealing with PD!)
Certainly you’ve had other life passages when change wasn’t necessarily wel-
comed, but required. You managed then — and perhaps you even thrived in
the new setting. You can certainly do it again — especially if the move simpli-
fies your care and frees you to enjoy other activities.
313
Chapter 21: It's Just Bricks and Mortar: Housing Options You Can Live With

Bidding your abode adieu
The truth is that you’re going to know in your heart of hearts when your
home is no longer practical. You can’t climb the stairs. Your bathroom — in
spite of its maze of grab bars and safety features — is too small or difficult to
use. Your wheelchair doesn’t fit through the doorways or roll easily across
the carpeted floors. You and your care partner are becoming isolated from
friends, family, and the community activities you love.
The only problem is if you refuse to admit that the time is right. If you’ve pre-
pared for this day (as we’ve been known to preach), the struggle can be far
less distressing. The decision won’t be easy, but you can skip the panic and
anxiety of not knowing where to turn because you already know your
options. You’re ready to pick one and get on with your life.
Weighing the pros and cons of moving
Certainly you don’t want to move before you’re ready, but you do need to let
go of any fantasies about the future and face reality. Is it practical and safe to
continue living in your home? More to the point, can your life, routine, and
ease of functioning improve if you move?
One person with Parkinson’s (PWP) didn’t leave his home without a fight.
Before he was willing to admit it was time, he tried everything — an alert neck-
lace so he could call for help if he fell (which he did frequently), a hospital bed
for his living room so he didn’t have to go to the upstairs bedrooms, a portable
commode next to the bed so he didn’t have go to the bathroom during the
night, and a private-duty aide at night so his wife could get her rest.
One day he looked around the house and realized that it wasn’t the refuge he
had loved for so many years. The memories it held had been pushed aside to
make room for the trappings of his illness — his home had become one giant
sick-room. And he didn’t want that for himself or his wife.
Moving is 90 percent attitude
However you come to the decision — willingly or kicking and screaming —
moving day is tough. It’s tough on you and on the people who love you and
share the memories that made your house a home.
Further, this is a major step in the progression of your PD — the admission
that you need to (rather than choose to) move. This is the time to talk about
your feelings with a counselor or trusted friend — one who has no stake in
314
Part V: Coping with Advanced PD 

the emotional real estate of the home itself. In short, you need to take the
time to grieve this passage the same way you mourn any major passage in
your life. Talking about your sadness and regrets eventually leads to accep-
tance and even (perhaps) anticipation of the next step.
Redefining Your Castle
Leaving the old homestead is the end of the world only if you say it is.
Remember the discussion of your coping style — the old fight or flight sce-
nario? (Check out Chapter 7 for a refresher if you need one.) Well, in this
case, flight is turning your back on the positive possibilities of housing
opportunities. Fight, on the other hand, is taking charge of this new challenge
by considering the options you’ve researched and by choosing the best one
with your care partner.
Weighing your options
You may be surprised at the possibilities after you begin to consider solu-
tions for moving to a place that will permit you to continue to have as much
independence and control over your routine as possible. The following sec-
tions describe some of the more common choices.
Moving in with a family member
Okay, stop shuddering. Moving in with a family member can work as long as
both parties work through the details of the living arrangements and routines
before making the decision to share living space. In every household there
are routine chores and schedules. What’s yours and what’s the schedule for
the rest of the household? If you’re moving in with an adult child, are there
also grandchildren in the house? Then their schedules (and rights to privacy
and socializing with friends) must also be taken into consideration. Ideally
you will have a specific space of your own in the house — your room (hope-
fully furnished with your things) and possible (hopefully) your own bath-
room. And the rules for you? Keep in mind that this is your relative’s home —
not yours. By all means, state your needs at the outset, but then settle in and
do your part to become a welcomed member of the household.
Considering a more practical apartment, condo, or house
Some options aren’t as drastic as moving to a care facility. If you’re having
mobility problems in your current residence, what can make that easier?
Perhaps your home is multi-level, or the doorways are too narrow, or the
rooms are too small to accommodate a wheelchair or the safe use of your
315
Chapter 21: It's Just Bricks and Mortar: Housing Options You Can Live With

walker. In such cases, consider a house, condominium, or apartment that’s
on one level and constructed for an aging population. Much new construction
today offers wider doorways, smooth thresholds, and safety features in bath-
rooms as standard fare. Several other options are also available:
 Accessory dwelling units (ADUs): ADUs are living spaces within an
existing home or on the same property. (Remember the concept of the
mother-in-law apartment?) Can you remodel your present (and beloved)
home to include a small apartment where you can live comfortably and
safely while your adult child moves into the main house? Can you use
the ADU as a residence for a live-in caregiver who, in exchange for room
and board, provides care services for you?
An alternative is to move into an ADU within the home or on the prop-
erty of your son or daughter whose been encouraging you to move in.
An ADU gives you (and your child) privacy and autonomy while relieving
the stress of living some distance apart.
Check local zoning ordinances and assess the practicality of construct-
ing an ADU. If you’re determined to stay in your home for as long as pos-
sible, the ADU can help lengthen that stay.
 Subsidized senior housing: In many communities, apartment or housing
complexes use state and federal funding to accommodate middle- or
low-income senior citizens. In such facilities, rents reflect a percentage
of income.
 Board-and-care homes: If you have no live-in care partner, a board-and-
care home may be an option. Also referred to as group homes, these
facilities are usually large homes that have been converted to serve
people who can no longer manage on their own but who don’t need a
higher level of care. These homes are in residential neighborhoods, and
residents have their own bedrooms and share common areas of the
house. Sometimes the makeup of the residents revolves around a
common factor such as age, gender, or disability. A paid staff prepares
meals, assists with some care, and may engage residents in group activi-
ties. Note: Such facilities aren’t eligible for public funding such as
Medicare or Medicaid.
Communities of care
In response to the aging of America (and the rest of the world), the options
for long-term care have grown in the last several decades. Today the most
common types of services are grouped according to client-ability: indepen-
dent, needs some assistance, needs major assistance, and end-of-life. The
facilities may have different names in different states, and the services and
costs vary widely.

Medicare covers costs on the same basis as medically necessary services in a
resident’s private home (for example, if the doctor orders physical therapy for
you, Medicare might cover such skilled home-care with some possibility of
personal care as long as such services aren’t already provided by the facility).
This section breaks out five basic types of long-term care facilities along with
their specific features, pros, and cons.
Continuing care retirement centers (CCRCs or step-care communities)
These facilities offer levels of care from independent through nursing care.
The primary advantage is that you don’t have to research new facilities, make
a major move, or leave behind friends and staff as your needs change. You
and your significant other can live together; if one partner needs a higher
level of care, the other can remain nearby.
Services, levels of care, and admission procedures and requirements can
vary widely in such facilities. Get all the rules up front before you choose.
Also, remember that should the time come when you need a higher level of
care, you want to be sure that the nursing part of any step community is cer-
tified as a skilled-care facility (meaning they’re qualified to accept Medicare
payment for skilled rehabilitative services). The facility should also be certi-
fied for Medicaid (see Chapter 20 for more on this federal program). To be
thorough, you may want to check their state inspection record. For more
information, check out www.carf.org/aging.
Some communities may not include a nursing care facility. If this is the case,
ask whether they have an association with a nursing facility in the commu-
nity and whether residents of the CCRC get preferential consideration if the
nursing facility has a waiting list. The same words of caution apply: Be sure
this facility is certified to ensure you receive the best possible care.
Independent apartment with services
Many step-community residents begin by residing in an apartment or cottage
with their personal belongings. Such units may tie into the overall community
through safety features (such as call bells in bathrooms), activities (such as
field trips or book discussion groups), and meals in a common dining room.
317
Chapter 21: It's Just Bricks and Mortar: Housing Options You Can Live With

Note: This level is similar to traditional freestanding apartment or condo-
minium complexes. Residents come and go as they please, manage their own
healthcare, and maintain roles of choice in the larger community.
Assisted living
These facilities can vary greatly in terms of standard services and those ser-
vices offered at an extra cost. Be sure you ask for the specifics regarding both
of them. In general, such facilities include assistance with activities of daily
living (ADLs), such as bathing, dressing, and transferring from chair to bed
and back.
Standard services may also include the management and administration of
medicines, transportation to and from doctor appointments, and most meals.
Residents usually live in their own efficiency or one-bedroom apartment
within a building or complex of buildings that also houses common areas
such as a dining room, chapel, activity room, and library. Most assisted living
facilities have a standard monthly fee and then additional services that you
can purchase on an as-needed or as-wanted basis.
On the downside, if the facility isn’t part of a step community with its on-
campus skilled nursing facility and you fall and need extended rehabilitation,
that will mean another move (plus having to pay for two places if you intend
to return to the assisted living facility).
Skilled nursing facility (SNF) or rehabilitation center
Skilled nursing facilities or rehab centers are facilities that provide skilled
care and must be specifically licensed to provide these professional rehabili-
tative services. Nursing facilities that aren’t licensed for skilled care (as well
as those that are) also offer what is called non-skilled, custodial, or mainte-
nance care. These non-skilled wings of the facility serve people in the
advanced stages of illness or life with a wide range of support, personal care,
routine health services, and social opportunities.
SNFs can serve a variety of populations — people of all ages who may reside
there for varying lengths of time, including:
 People recovering from surgery may spend several weeks in a nursing
home or rehabilitation center before returning to more independent
living.
 People who suffer from dementia, such as Alzheimer’s, often live in nurs-
ing home care centers when the community or their family can no longer
manage the person’s care. Often the care centers have special units that
maintain the safety and dignity of people suffering from dementia.
318
Part V: Coping with Advanced PD 

 People whose care needs exceed the family’s or community’s ability to
meet those needs may live in this type of facility. Many facilities have
special units where people who are frail but alert and relatively active
can be safe and secure while taking part in the facility’s activities and
social opportunities.
 People in need of care occasionally stay here on a short-term basis to
give the caregiver a much-needed break.
The best nursing homes have full occupancy, so visit early on and get your
name on the wait list if this is the place you want to be for any future rehab
or residency services. Note: When your name comes to the top of the list, the
administrator calls you. If you’re not ready to move to the nursing home, you
can request that your name stay on the list.
Hospice
Hospice care is becoming an increasingly preferred option for patients who
are clearly coming to the end of life. Hospice programs provide personal care
for the patient and also offer counseling for the families and friends. The pro-
gram may be in a special facility, a hospital, or a nursing home, but in many
cases hospice services are also available in your own home. After the pro-
gram accepts you, a team of doctors, nurses, home health aides, social work-
ers, counselors, and even trained volunteers help you and your family cope
with the final days of your illness.
To find a program in your area, ask your hospital social worker, and remem-
ber that while Medicare may cover some costs, it won’t cover round-the-
clock care at home.
Assessing for a perfect fit
Only you and your care partner can describe in detail the needs you have as
individuals and as a care team. But as you make that list together and use it
to evaluate various housing options, keep these key factors in mind:
 Be realistic about your possible future needs and the ability of you and
your care partners to meet those needs every day over what could be
several years.
 List residential care options in your area and in the area of an adult
child, friend, or close relative where you may consider moving. Then
assess and compare similar facilities for quality and consistency of care.
 Visit those facilities (at all levels) that meet your criteria and assess
them using the checklist at the end of this chapter.
319
Chapter 21: It's Just Bricks and Mortar: Housing Options You Can Live With

 Talk to people — staff and clients at the facility, people in the commu-
nity, neighbors, and friends. Ask what they’ve heard, what they know,
and what their Aunt Millie’s experience was.
 Always choose on the basis of which facility best meets your needs.
Making a list, checking it twice:
Evaluating the facilities
When you visit a facility, focus on the people in the program and note their
interactions with staff. Two words of caution:
 Don’t let the window dressing (beautiful furnishings, plantings, free
lattes, treats for prospective clients, and other such details) sway you.
 Don’t be taken in by an unusually warm welcome or excesses of flattery
and interest by your tour guide.
These folks are in business to sell a product and a service. And you, dear
reader, are their target audience.
Following is a checklist for your tours of various facilities. In a notebook,
record the number of each item and then any notes you have about that serv-
ice (use a separate page for each facility). Consider placing a numeric value
next to each service to reflect your overall observation (for example a 5 is
excellent and a 1 is very poor). Not all items apply to every location, and serv-
ices offered by one facility and not others may influence your final decision
depending on your current idea of what you will need and the reality of what
might be needed down the road.
 Entrance is user-friendly and attractive.
 Staff welcomed and was prepared for appointment or tour.
 Light, doorways, and hallways adequate to accommodate people with
wheel chair or walker.
 Facility is free of any noxious or unpleasant odor; clean and attractively
furnished.
 Grab bars are in bathrooms and handrails in hallways.
 Temperature is comfortable for clients.
 Smoking is either not permitted or allowed only in clearly marked, desig-
nated areas.
320
Part V: Coping with Advanced PD 

 Exits are clearly marked; smoke detectors and sprinklers are throughout
the facility.
 Furnishings are sturdy and appropriate for people with movement 
disorders.
 If meals are served, clients have choices and special diets are available.
 Staff interacts with clients and treats every client as an adult and with
respect.
 Staff members are certified (where appropriate) or receive ongoing
training; hiring includes background checks.
 Tour guide calls residents by name and is clearly known to them.
 If appropriate, a registered nurse is on staff in addition to the facility
administrator.
 The ratio of staff to client is reasonable.
 Staff takes a team approach with the client and family in developing a
plan of care.
 The administrative team has been in place at least one year.
 Ownership of the facility has not changed more than once in five years.
 In a residential facility, residents may bring personal furnishings.
 Resident living spaces have adequate and personal closet and dresser
space even if room is shared.
 If rooms are shared, residents have a voice in choosing a roommate.
 Tour guide offers copies of resident-rights documents and any reports of
state or facility inspections for review.
 Activities are age-appropriate and conducted with respect to the experi-
ence and history of the clients.
 The facility has an outdoor area for client use; staff is available to assist
the residents in accessing that area.
 Facility has an emergency evacuation plan that includes plans for
unusual events such as tornadoes, hurricanes, and so on if appropriate.
 Services alluded to in promotional materials are indeed included in the
base cost; extra services and their cost are clearly spelled out.
Certification and licensing isn’t a requirement in all states or for all types of
care facilities, but facilities that must meet such regulations (either state or
federal or both) undergo regular (and unannounced) inspections to ensure
compliance.
321
Chapter 21: It's Just Bricks and Mortar: Housing Options You Can Live With

Certainly any facility that accepts Medicare or Medicaid or both must be
licensed and inspected. The results of such inspections are a matter of public
record. If you’re considering a setting that provides full residential care and is
licensed for payment through Medicare or Medicaid, you can view the results
of the most recent inspection results online at www.medicare.gov/
NHCompare.
A Few Words for You and
Your Care Partner
The day may come (or it may never come) when your PD progresses to the
point where you need constant round-the-clock care that is beyond the limits
of what can be provided to you at home or in a semi-independent setting
(such as an assisted living facility). Should that day come and you decide to
move to a full-care facility, you and your care partner need to be prepared for
some changes.
For example, the PWP must be prepared to accept help from strangers for
even his most basic needs including dressing, bathing, getting to and from
the bathroom, and such, and he may need to rely on someone else to speak
for him and make his wishes known. And the care partner will need to down-
shift her role from caregiver back to care partner (Chapter 19 explains the dif-
ference), which will involve monitoring the way care is provided by others
instead of providing that care herself. The care partner also will need to
advocate for the PWP, making sure that the PWP’s final wishes are followed.
If the facility isn’t used to caring for PWP, the care partner may also need to
be firm about the importance of timing in the delivery of medications — even
if that means the care partner must lobby for the staff to deliver meds out-
side of their normal routine rounds. Care partners, be prepared to have these
tough conversations and stand your ground.
For both of you, this doesn’t have to be a time of sadness. Instead it can be a
time to let go of the stresses of the last many years and look back instead to
the triumphs of having maintained a full life in spite of having PD.

Chapter 22
Ten Ways to Deal with 
Difficult Feelings
In This Chapter
 Recognizing feelings that can do real damage
 Coping with difficult times and moving on
C
oping with feelings has no hard and fast rules. Just like the wild elation
of falling in love may seem impossible to control, the bouts of intensely
negative feelings that can accompany Parkinson’s disease (PD) may also
appear beyond your control. Because of the depression, anxiety, and other
symptoms of your PD, you may find these feelings more of a challenge over
time. To top it off, other people don’t easily recognize when you’re upset,
which only requires more of your limited patience at these troublesome
times. Here are ten ideas that may help you begin coping with these feelings.
Banishing the Concept of “Bad”
Placing some sort of value system on feelings is a no-win situation, yet people
do it all the time. “I feel bad” doesn’t mean that someone’s physically ill but
rather that he’s wrestling with one or more emotions that make him feel out
of sorts. By taking the time to examine and name this feeling, a person’s more
likely to find relief — and minimize the guilt. So, whenever you recognize
you’re in a funk, consider these two tips:
 Name the feeling (do not judge it as good or bad) by completing this
statement: “I am (angry/jealous/sad) because ______________.”
 Do not resort to artificial comforts and cover-ups for the pain (like
binge-eating, popping a pill, or drowning the feeling in a stiff drink).

Halting the Isolation
Any chronic, progressive illness carries a measure of isolation — for you and
your care partner. You get so tired of having to admit that you can’t go here
or do that. As your illness progresses and you truly have more trouble getting
out and about, that sense of isolation can become overwhelming. Heal the
feeling by:
 Meeting regularly with other persons with Parkinson’s (PWP).
 Encouraging (and accepting) the offers of people to come to you to
share an hour, a meal, or an entire evening.
 Connecting through e-mail and phone calls.
 Exercising — take a walk or take part in a sport like golf.
 Tapping into whatever spiritual therapies work for you.
Corralling the Anger
Anger at your PD is one issue, but anger at those who love you and are
attempting to meet your needs is quite another. On its own, anger is a com-
pletely normal response to living with a condition like PD that hampers your
control and freedom. And getting really ticked off once in awhile can even be
healthy. But generalized and unidentified anger that festers can do some real
damage. So get a handle on your anger from the outset by:
 Recognizing that your mask-like facial expression may compromise your
efforts to convey your frustrations and anger.
 Naming the cause and then seizing the moment — rant and rage for a
couple of minutes, punch a pillow, or count to ten.
 Putting your anger in perspective — talk it over with someone to look
for the actual underlying causes for the outburst.
Taming the Guilt
Guilt is sneaky. It creeps up on you after a jealous, frustrated, or angry reac-
tion. It chafes as you perceive people putting their lives on hold for you. Like
anger, guilt can build on other difficult feelings. But, just as you do with anger,
you need to name the guilt and nip it in the bud by:
326
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

 Asking yourself whether you’re being fair to people around you by
accepting and appreciating their efforts.
 Taking stock and reassuring yourself that you’re doing all you can to
maintain your function in the face of your PD.
Subduing Your Fears
Face it. We live in a pretty scary world, mostly because of the uncertainties
that surround us — planes flying into buildings, pandemic threats of famine
and contagious disease, and then some. As a PWP, your fears may be far more
specific than these world events. You’re concerned that you may have passed
this disease on to your children; you worry that your PD will incapacitate you
before you can achieve certain milestones, such as seeing your daughter
married or holding your first grandchild. Face your fears by:
 Reviewing the information on anxiety and depression in Chapter 13.
 Accepting that life is uncertain. The best anyone can do is to live each
day to its fullest and not wait to celebrate and appreciate.
Venting Your Frustration
Frustration can arise from many situations. You may get frustrated with your
inability to hold a comb or toothbrush. Or you may grit your teeth when you
perceive your care partner’s taking over tasks you can do for yourself. Or
maybe you gag with the lack of straight answers to your questions about PD
and its progression. And on and on. Here’s an excellent solution: Call or
e-mail one of the people in your support group (or go to an online group such
as brain.hastypastry.net/forums) and vent! Then get back to life.
Cooling the Jealousy
Jealousy is such a normal human reaction. You’ve dealt with it your entire life —
when a friend got a bigger house or a better car; when a co-worker got the pro-
motion you wanted; when your sister lost 30 pounds without trying (or so she
said!). As a PWP, odds are good that your green monster rears its jealous head
when your family and friends are free to go and do as they please without even
thinking about it. You, on the other hand, have to plan and time activities. Life is
not fair. You know this one. Face it by:
327
Chapter 22: Ten Ways to Deal with Difficult Feelings

 Reminding yourself of your successes. Could that co-worker handle the
challenge of PD with the kind of grace and humor you do (most of the
time)?
 Expressing (in a kind and gentle way) your feelings of jealousy to the
person. Chances are good that you’ll discover the person is equally jeal-
ous of you.
Stopping the Spirals of Sadness
There’s a little sad and then there’s a lot sad. A little sad is when you feel
sorry for yourself but the feeling passes quickly — usually within a few
hours. A lot sad is when sadness spirals into full-blown mourning or grieving,
the way you’d feel if you suffered some life-changing event such as the death
of a loved one or the break-up of a relationship.
For PWP, intense sadness may be connected to the life they had planned
before they heard they had PD. Left to its own devices, sadness of this magni-
tude can spiral into full-blown depression. You need to nip it in the bud by
first acknowledging your right to mourn the life that will no longer be and
then by embracing the possibilities that are before you now.
If working your way through the sadness becomes overwhelming, seek pro-
fessional support by talking to your clergyperson or the counselor you put
on your care team to help you through tough times (see Chapter 6).
Caring About Apathy
“I just don’t care anymore.” “Nothing’s going to change.” Answers? You care
or you wouldn’t have made it this far. So start by discussing these feelings
with your doctor. If you’re not already engaged in some form of talk therapy
with a counselor, this is a good time to consider that option.
Dumping Depression
Short spurts of sadness can be healthy reactions as you adapt to life with a
chronic and progressive condition. But when such feelings last weeks with no
let-up, you may be facing depression. You need to treat it the way you’d treat
any physical symptoms that don’t go away after a short time. If feelings of
helplessness, hopelessness, escalating apathy, or spiraling sadness persist
beyond a few days, get help. Start by reading Chapter 13; then talk to your
neurologist about treatments for handling depression in PD.

Chapter 23
Ten Ways to Care for 
Your Care Partner
In This Chapter
 Understanding your care partner’s life
 Making life a little easier for your care partner
 Recognizing the simple pleasures
L
ife turned an unexpected corner the day you were diagnosed with
Parkinson’s disease (PD) for at least two people — you and your primary
care partner.
Your care partner is your champion — speaking up when you can’t, making
sure that the medical community focuses on you as an individual and not just
as another case, and performing the thousand and one tasks that keep life
running for both of you. Your care partner deserves not only your empathy
and understanding but also your support and attention.
This chapter gives you ten ways to acknowledge the sacrifice and encourage
a healthy form of selfishness for your care partner.
Honor the Partnership
A partnership is a two-way street. It’s not all about you and your needs. You
and your partner honor your partnership by recognizing it as a mutual
exchange of ideas as you find your way together through this change in
lifestyle. Initially the focus is on you, and that’s only right. But eventually you
need to get a grip on your own reaction to PD and take a long, hard look at its
effect on people around you, especially the person next to you, your partner
in care. These are some ideas for doing just that:

330
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 In any discussion about adapting to your needs, be sure you address (via
words and actions) how those needs will impact your partner’s routine.
 Be open to the idea of getting support and assistance from someone
other than your care partner. For that matter, suggest calling in rein-
forcements yourself. Perhaps your sister (who’s offered to help in the
past) can drive you to the hairdresser so your care partner has an after-
noon to himself.
 Listen to what your partner is really saying. For example, in a discussion
about your care partner doing tasks that you can still manage (although
it may take you longer), maybe she admits that doing the tasks herself is
just easier instead of waiting because of all she has to do. That answer
may be a good clue that she’s feeling overwhelmed, and you need to dis-
cuss ways to get her some help.
Acknowledge Life beyond PD
When every waking moment seems to focus on doctor’s appointments, med-
ications, maintaining function, and fighting depression, you need to stop and
take a moment to really consider how much of your (healthy) care partner’s
life has been given over to your PD. How many of your conversations begin
and end with PD? How much of your day and your care partner’s focus on
managing symptoms and maintaining your independence? What facets of
your relationship before PD are beginning to slip through the cracks?
Address that imbalance right now before it’s too late. Talk through just how
you can work together to make sure PD doesn’t become your and your care
partner’s life.
One way to remind each other that there’s more to life than your PD is to
declare certain times of day no-PD zones. For example, agree to talk about
topics other than your PD during and after dinner. You’ll both sleep better if
you spend the evening discussing lighter topics and catching up in general.
Accentuate the Positive
Care partners may actually resist talking about pleasurable experiences in
their lives. For example, because you can’t ride any longer, she may avoid
discussing the amazing bike ride she just completed. Or she may feel uncom-
fortable talking about some political infighting at work because she fears that

the details seem so petty and silly to you. Or she may worry that if she talks
about a friend’s impending vacation, it may just remind you that you’ll proba-
bly never make that trip to Paris you dreamed of. You have a responsibility to
encourage such sharing by making it clear that your partner is in some ways
your extended eyes and ears, bringing you news and funny stories that have
always entertained you.
Strike a Balance in Caregiving
Surely one of the most exhausting tasks for any care partner is trying to guess
how much care is enough and how much is too much. How is your care partner
supposed to know whether you’re too exhausted to do something for yourself
or you’re determined to complete a task, even if you take all day? Care partners
have many talents and they develop new ones over time, but mind-reading will
never be on that list. If your care partner seems to be doing rather than helping,
let that imbalance go for the moment, but find a time later to talk through the
problems it may be causing.
Ask, Don’t Demand
Listen to yourself. When you need help, do you begin the request with a
verb? “Get me the remote.” “Come here.” “Button this.”
Your care partner is not a private in your war against PD. Your care partner is
right there in the trenches with you. Show some respect. This advice is not a
request — it’s a demand!
Use the Magic Words Often
Surely you learned them as kids: please and thank you. Never have they had
more power. In the grown-up version, you need to move beyond simple state-
ments — you need to show as well as tell. The smile, the touch of the hand,
the small surprise that focuses just on your care partner are all magic in their
own way. And the true magic is that you feel a little more like your old self if
you can take care of your partner now and then.
331
Chapter 23: Ten Ways to Care for Your Care Partner

Get Over Yourself
Yes, you’ve been dealt a really bad hand, but you’re still here. For now you
have a life that includes this person who has put his life on hold to take this
journey with you. You also have a choice: live each day thinking about all the
problems you may face as your PD progresses, or live each day!
Accept Services as a Gift for 
Your Care Partner
Asking other people to take care of needs that you once managed is depress-
ing, especially if that person’s a stranger who’s paid to deliver a service. (And
especially if that service is so personal and private that you find it difficult to
accept, such as bathing you or helping you to the bathroom.) Try to accept
this help as one way of caring for your partner. Does this service free your
partner to attend to some other task or simply enjoy a break? Does the help
save time that both of you can put to better use?
Find Joy in Life
Caring for someone whose outlook is positive and hopeful — in spite of set-
backs — is far less stressful than trying to bolster the spirit of someone con-
stantly seeing the dark side. Your care partner has gone through all of the
emotions you have: anger, fear, depression, the gamut. True, PD isn’t attack-
ing your care partner’s ability to function, but PD is attacking both your lives.
Remember, you set the tone for how people respond to your PD. If you’ve
shivered in the shadows for a while, try crossing over to that sunnier side of
the street, and take your care partner with you.
Encourage Laughter and Dreams
Your care partner deserves a life beyond your PD, a life as full of pleasure and
promise as possible under the circumstances, a life that keeps dreams alive.
You can encourage and nurture that life for your partner. Start by flipping to
the “Bill of Rights for the PD Care Partner” in Chapter 19. Post the list where
you and your care partner see it every day. And when your care partner
resists nurturing and caring for herself, ask her to read the list aloud. Then
talk about issues that can and must change so you can help care for your
partner — physically, mentally, and spiritually.

Michael J. Fox, Muhammad Ali,
and YOU: Ten Ways to Make a
Real Difference
In This Chapter
 Using your power of one
 Getting out and speaking up
T
he Parkinson’s community is unique in that most PD organizations at the
national level are super-organized, well-connected, and have earned the
respect of the powerbrokers who can affect change. Think of the benefits
people with PD (PWP) have gained from the efforts of Michael J. Fox and
Muhammad Ali, for example, and then multiply that by 1.5 million — the
number of PWP in the United States alone. Wow! There’s power in those num-
bers! But you don’t have to be a celebrity to make a huge difference. Here are
ten ideas to get you started.
Read More About It
Start by making yourself a local expert on PD. Check out the resources in
Appendix B — especially those that offer information to share with other
people. Get them on board for a specific issue that needs attention. (See “Get
to Know Your Local Officials” a little later in this chapter.)

334
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Vote Early and Often
The shocking fact is that Americans are becoming increasingly apathetic
about voting. How often have you heard someone say, “It doesn’t matter —
politicians are all the same”? Well, if you as a PWP don’t care, who is going to
care? Your elected officials’ support for dollars for research and adequate
care options is vital for the future of treating and curing PD.
Absentee voting is always an option if getting to the polls is too difficult.
Get to Know Your Local Officials
Local elected officials work for you and often live in your community. Don’t
hesitate to talk directly to them about key issues that could impact you or
others with a chronic progressive condition like PD. For example, if a zoning
law is preventing a rehabilitation clinic from locating in your community, let
your elected officials know why this clinic is important for you and other
people with chronic conditions.
If the issue is a state or national matter, consider making contact (by phone,
e-mail, or letter) with an official’s senior staff person. Locally or nationally,
build relationships with your elected officials — not one of checking up but
one of informing that can lead to a difference for many people in the commu-
nity (and votes for re-election).
Never underestimate the power of a single note or phone call. And don’t
forget to follow up! If you’ve written or called an elected official and been told
someone will get back to you, but no one has, call again.
Don’t Just Be Informed — Pass It On
Okay, you don’t want to overdo this but carpe diem — seize the day! Say
you’re at dinner with friends and the conversation has settled on politics.
You know a key bill’s coming up for a vote that can really impact PD research.
Talk about it! Relate its importance to facts that will stick in people’s minds
and perhaps lead them to contact their congressperson to cast a key vote.
A less in-your-face way to inform people as you go about your daily routine is
to stay involved and talk about projects and interests you’re involved in even
if they’re not PD related. Why? Because this is your opportunity to show that
PWP can be contributing members to society in spite of PD.

Support Your Local Support Group
Attend meetings and consider getting more involved in the group’s effort to
influence community leaders (or even national politicians). Even if the sup-
port group isn’t specifically for PWP, you can find power in numbers. Signing
a petition, participating in a charity event, or raising money for research are
all ways you can help build a better future for PWP.
Rally Local Support
Consider ways you can build awareness through your local library, employer,
and community organizations. For example, encourage your librarian to
invest in informative books, videos, and CDs for people with chronic, pro-
gressive conditions and their care partners. Ask your employer and commu-
nity organization leaders to offer literature and seminars that help people
with these conditions and their families to manage their time and caregiving.
Employers benefit from less absenteeism and a more focused and productive
work force, and community groups become more engaged in the needs of the
community. (Get things started by ordering a set of the excellent booklets
from the National Parkinson Foundation listed in Appendix B.)
Pitch Your Story to Local Media Outlets
People who put together the local news (print, radio, and television) are
eager to hear from you. Can you imagine how they would delight in a story
about a 60-something doctor with PD performing his first piano recital with a
group of kids? What about the young onset Parkinson’s disease (YOPD)
person’s care partner who also works fulltime, cares for their school-aged
children, and volunteers?
Before you call your local news desk, check with the person whose story you
plan to offer (even if that’s your care partner). In telling the story, include:
 A local angle — the story is about a person in your community
 The key that makes it unique and not just another health story — as in
the piano-playing doctor mentioned earlier
 The visuals (for print and television; for example, is there a photo op at
the recital so a photographer can attend along with the journalist?) 
Never forget that your story could help others struggling with chronic illness.

Chapter 24: Ten Ways to Make a Real Difference

Join the Parkinson’s Action Network
Advocacy requires conviction and passion for a cause. The national PD com-
munity has banded together (for the most part) and named the Parkinson’s
Action Network (PAN) to speak in Washington DC for the entire PD commu-
nity. You can be a part of that national call to action by logging on to the PAN
Web site at www.parkinsonsaction.org or calling 800-850-4726 to find a
local or area chapter or to get on their mailing list for updates.
Raise Money for Research
Of course, if politics isn’t your gig, you can raise awareness as well as dollars
for research several other ways. For example, some events (such as a
marathon or walkathon) require quite a bit of organization and teamwork.
Sign up to volunteer and get your friends and family on board as well.
You also can be effective on your own. How many times have you read of
someone biking or walking across America and collecting donations along the
way to raise awareness of some cause? Personally taking action doesn’t mean
you need to plan a trek across America, but what else can you do on your
own to raise awareness and financial support? Try holding a yard sale with all
the money going to PD research or ask family and friends to make a monetary
contribution in your name to a PD organization in lieu of gifts on holidays,
birthdays, and other gift occasions. (After all, do you really need another
book, t-shirt, or CD?)
Celebrate National PD Month in April
PD gets its own month for national awareness — April (think springtime,
renewal, and hope). How appropriate! How can you and your care partner
mark this special month? The following are some easy ideas:
 Donate a copy of this book (or another on PD) to your local library.
 Plan to schedule one of the events suggested earlier in this chapter
during the month of April.
 Go to New York City and take part in the annual Parkinson’s Unity Walk.
(Check out www.unitywalk.org for full information.)
 Buy a couple dozen red tulips (a floral symbol of the fight against PD)
and pass them out to your friends, family, and everyone on your health-
care team to thank them for making the journey with you.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Part VII
Appendixes

In this part . . .
I
n Appendix A you find a glossary that defines terms fre-
quently tossed around in the world of Parkinson’s dis-
ease. These are terms you should get to know because
your doctors, other people with PD, and even the journal-
ists who report the latest PD news use them.
Appendix B is a collection of resources that we introduce
throughout this guide. The list includes national PD orga-
nizations with Web sites that can help in everything, from
locating a neurologist or support group to updating you
on the latest advances in medicines and treatments. We
also include a list of programs and assistive devices that
can make your life easier. Even if you don’t have access to
a computer (or don’t know how to use one), get your
child, grandchild, or the local librarian to help you dis-
cover these resources for enhancing your life.

propulsive gait: Also called parkinsonian gait; walking that is characterized
by a stooped, rigid posture with head and neck bent forward; shorter and
faster steps propel the person forward, placing him at risk for falling. See 
festination and retropulsive gait.
PWP: Abbreviation for “person (people) with Parkinson’s disease;” some-
times appears as “PLWP” for “person (people) living with Parkinson’s.”

tion for treating PD symptoms.
speech therapy: Rehabilitative techniques that help restore or strengthen
speech and swallowing muscles affected by PD.

globus pallidus and subthalamic nucleus.
345
Appendix A: Glossary

substantia nigra: The small area of the brain that houses cells that produce
the neurotransmitter dopamine; specifically affected by Parkinson’s disease.
subthalamic nucleus: One of the small groups of cells in the basal ganglia pri-
marily affected by PD; the most frequent surgical target for DBS. See deep
brain stimulation.
support group: A gathering of people with a common connection (such as
